# Chandra steers clear of senate meeting
## 
### Mas Harntha Staff writer 
Despite concern on the part of
some University officials that
unregistered Medical School stu
dent Ravi Chandra had threat
ened violence if he were not
allowed to address Friday's Medi
cal School Faculty Senate meet
ing, no violence occurred.
Security was beefed up for the
meeting, but Chandra, who was
recently suspended as the presi
dent of the Stanford Medical Stu
dent Association, did not attend.
Medical School Dean David
Korn said that students came to

him with concerns that Chandra
might act violently.
Chandra said this allegation
was "absurd" and contended that
he was barred from campus due
to political differences with Korn.
Korn said the matter was not
political, and that he was con
cerned about the possibility of
"disruption, or maybe more."
Chandra said he had wanted to
attend the meeting so he could
"address some issues I felt were
being ignored."
Medical School Asst. Prof.
Phyllis Gardner said she believed
Chandra wanted to speak on the
sexual harassment issue.
Chandra said he did not attend
the meeting because security offi
cers at the Medical School told
him he was barred from the meet
ing and "would be arrested for

trespassing if he came onto the
Medical Center premises without
permission."
Medical School officials said last
week that Chandra was not allowed
to attend the meeting because he is
not a registered student and is no
longer the acting president of the
student association.
Chandra was forced off campus
Thursday morning by Medical
School security guards.

Chandra said he had been told
last week that he could not come
on campus without expressed per
mission from a Medical School
dean. He said no one had
informed him yet how he could
obtain full entrance rights, and
added that he has a meeting with
several deans today.
"I'm hoping they let me come
in and go about my business and
studv as a student," he said,

adding that he needed to come to
campus in order to study for
make-up exams he must take.
Chandra was suspended from
the Medical School on Aug. 20 by
the Committee on Student Perfor
mance. He was not a registered stu
dent by the beginning of fall quar
ter, so he was ineligible to continue
as student association president.
According to Chandra, he was
suspended because he had delayed

a makeup exam last spring quar
ter. Medical School officials would
not comment on the reasons for
his suspension, saying student
academic records are confidential.
Chandra said he has three exams
to make up, and he intends to take
all three before next quarter.
Neither Chandra's forced exit
off campus Thursday morning
nor his suspension was discussed
at Friday's Medical School Facul

ty Senate meeting, which focused
primarily on the Medical School's
procedure for reporting sexual
harassment and the development
of a women's program within the
Medical School.
Gardner added that she was
glad nothing had happened, but
that she also wanted to have
Chandra back in the student gov
ernment. "We're all on his side,"
she said.
