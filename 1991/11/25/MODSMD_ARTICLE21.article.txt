# Big Game 1991 Stanford 38 Cal 21
## Cult of the Offensive 'Now Boys' act with guts, class 
### Amy Howard Staff writer 
Perched on a table in the locker room following
Saturday's Big Win of 38-21 over California, senior
fullback Tommy Vardell had the look of a soldier
returning from battle. The right sleeve of his jersey
was ripped in shreds, allowing his shoulder pads to
poke through, and his uniform was covered by a
blend of blood and grass stains. Swigging sips of
Gatorade, he calmly faced his final challenge of the
night, a swarm of media pinning him in from all
sides.
As usual, everyone was quick to point out his awe
inspiring performance and the records he had broken.
A Big Game-record 39 carries for 182 yards and three
touchdowns. 1,084 rushing yards on the season, a
Stanford record surpassing Darrin Nelson's prior
mark of 1,069 in 1977. His seventh 100-yard game
and record 20th touchdown this season.
"Touchdown Tommy" listened to it all, smiled a
little, and then put it into perspective for them. "I was
surprised (by the 182-yard performance). But, I guess
if you get the ball 39 times, you're bound to get some
yardage. I certainly didn't expect to break any records
— it's a great feeling. I'm just really grateful and I
want to say thank you to my teammates, especially
the offensive line."
And that was that. In spite of an hour of interro
gation by the press, nothing but positive statements
could be pulled from Vardell. In fact, he even praised
a Cal player for his gentleman-like behavior. "Num
ber 55 (defensive tackle Ryan Peery) kept helping me
up and saying 'good job,'" he said.
In this way, Vardell represents something larger
than himself, something that permeates a large por
tion of the Cardinal football team and oflen sets it
apart from its opjxments, as it did Saturday. That
something is class.
As the majority of the Bears (No. 55 excepted) "bad
mouthed, bullied, and bossed their way around the
field, the Cardinal dug in its heels and got to work.
Cal only managed to shake themselves. "Their
style of play has always been the taunting, talking
type, but I think it really backfired on them," wide
receiver Chris Walsh said. "I think they were frus
trated. They expected us to roll over, but we didn't."
A few comments even backfired on the individuals
who made them. Prior to the game, Cal wide receiver
Brian Treggs had said he wouldn't leave Palo Alto if
his team lost the game. Junior cornerback Darrien
Gordon, who had seven tackles and one interception,
was ready to hold him to it.
"Treggs can stay with (sophomore cornerback)
Vaughn (Bryant) and me," Gordon said, laughing. "We
have a nice room, cable TV. We'll set up a cot for him."
With California managing to rack up 11 penalties,
including five personal fouls, the Cardinal could
almost step back and watch its opponent self
destruct.
As the game wore on, the players managed to turn
the Bears' psychological warfare against them.
"When they started talking, that really lit our fire,"
junior outside linebacker Hon George said.

Sophomore quarterback Steve Stenstrom, who
completed 21 passes for 213 yards and two touch
downs, agreed. "They tried to talk a lot, but we were
confident in ourselves. We let our pads do the talk
ing," he said.
"We have an identity as a team. We're 'The Now
Boys,' and 1 think we'll be remembered for that,"
coach Denny Green said.
Indeed, The Now Boys will be remembered for
transforming a 1-3 start into an 8-3 record, earning
Stanford a bowl bid for the first time in five years.
They will be hailed for playing hard-nosed football
with determination and discipline.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, they will
be remembered for keeping the Axe in its rightful
place and the Bears in theirs for vet another vear.

In this way, Vardell represents something larger
than himself, something that permeates a large por
tion of the Cardinal football team and oflen sets it
apart from its opjxments, as it did Saturday. That
something is class.
As the majority of the Bears (No. 55 excepted) "bad
mouthed, bullied, and bossed their way around the
field, the Cardinal dug in its heels and got to work.
Cal only managed to shake themselves. "Their
style of play has always been the taunting, talking
type, but I think it really backfired on them," wide
receiver Chris Walsh said. "I think they were frus
trated. They expected us to roll over, but we didn't."
A few comments even backfired on the individuals
who made them. Prior to the game, Cal wide receiver
Brian Treggs had said he wouldn't leave Palo Alto if
his team lost the game. Junior cornerback Darrien
Gordon, who had seven tackles and one interception,
was ready to hold him to it.
"Treggs can stay with (sophomore cornerback)
Vaughn (Bryant) and me," Gordon said, laughing. "We
have a nice room, cable TV. We'll set up a cot for him."
With California managing to rack up 11 penalties,
including five personal fouls, the Cardinal could
almost step back and watch its opponent self
destruct.
As the game wore on, the players managed to turn
the Bears' psychological warfare against them.
"When they started talking, that really lit our fire,"
junior outside linebacker Hon George said.

Sophomore quarterback Steve Stenstrom, who
completed 21 passes for 213 yards and two touch
downs, agreed. "They tried to talk a lot, but we were
confident in ourselves. We let our pads do the talk
ing," he said.
"We have an identity as a team. We're 'The Now
Boys,' and 1 think we'll be remembered for that,"
coach Denny Green said.
Indeed, The Now Boys will be remembered for
transforming a 1-3 start into an 8-3 record, earning
Stanford a bowl bid for the first time in five years.
They will be hailed for playing hard-nosed football
with determination and discipline.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, they will
be remembered for keeping the Axe in its rightful
place and the Bears in theirs for vet another vear.
