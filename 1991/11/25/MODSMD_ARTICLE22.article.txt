## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
The Rice Owls knew they had
to stop Adam Keefe, but they
didn't know they had to stop him
from shooting three-pointers.

Pro scouts watching with glee,
Keefe drained a 20-foot trey with
1:19 left, locking up a 68-64 victo
ry and the Stanford-Apple Invita
tional title Saturday at half
empty Maples Pavilion.
"I'm delighted," said Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery. "Rice is
a very solid, experienced basket
ball team and they presented us
with a lot of problems. I honestly
wasn't sure if we could play to
that level of intensity so early.
But the pleasant thing is we can
play a lot better."
Stanford demolished Loyola
(Baltimore) 98-56 in the season
opener Friday, as three starters

scored in double figures. Rice
swamped Pacific 88-79 in the first
round and Pacific defeated Loyola
90-82 Saturday in the consolation
final. Stanford's 42-point victory
over the Greyhounds was its
largest since a 90-45 trouncing of
Cornell in 1988.
Keefe's third career three
pointer helped earn him most
valuable player honors and gave
the Cardinal a confidence-boost
ing 2-0 start to the season.
"I don't think I'm going to
shoot a lot of threes, because I'm
usually inside," said Keefe, who
scored 23 points in the final and
29 points in 23 minutes against
Loyola. "That (outside shooting)
is a result of my summer's activi
ties (Pan Am games)."
Heading into a Saturday show
down with Colorado, Stanford
has a seven-game winning streak
dating back to last year and a
burst of adrenaline after beating
a Rice team that is projected for
the NCAA tournament.
"We didn't look so young, so
inexperienced and intimidated,"
said Montgomery. "This was a
good win."
The Owls returned all five
starters from last year's 16-14
National Invitational Tourna
ment team, including monstrous
6-foot-10 center Brent Scott, the
Southwest Conference's best
center and leading rebounder.
But Stanford's Jim Morgan,
who scored a career-high 17
points Friday, held Scott to just
two first-half points by playing
behind him. Scott finished with
10 points and nine rebounds, but
was overshadowed inside by
Keefe, Morgan and and junior
forward Paul Garrett.
Garrett is Stanford's early
season surprise. The former
pine-shiner was 9-of-13 from the
field and 4-of-5 from the line in
two games, illustrating increased
confidence and agility.

Stanford point guard Marcus
Lollie effectively managed the
floor in both games, controlling
the tempo and feeding the ball to
open men inside. Lollie tallied a
career-high nine rebounds and
seven assists against Loyola, and
came back with six assists
against the quicker Owls to earn
all-tournament honors.
Lollie's two free throws with
50 seconds left gave Stanford a
67-62 lead, and a Keefe rebound
with 13 seconds left iced the win.
After Stanford took a 60-55
lead with an alley-oop from Gar
rett to Kenny Hicks, Rice's pesky
Chase Maag buried two jump
shots and a free throw to tie it
60-60 with 2:35 left.
But as he so often does, Keefe
came to the rescue in clutch
time. After nailing a seven-foot
baseline jumper to give Stanford
a 62-60, he took a pass just to the
right of the top of the key, faced
up and fired away for the decisive
trey.
