Cardinal wins
Apple invitational

Pro scouts watching with glee,
Keefe drained a 20-foot trey with
1:19 left, locking up a 68-64 victo
ry and the Stanford-Apple Invita
tional title Saturday at half
empty Maples Pavilion.
"I'm delighted," said Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery. "Rice is

Cornell in 1988.

valuable player honors and gave
the Cardinal a confidence-boost

"I don't think I'm going to
shoot a lot of threes, because I'm
usually inside," said Keefe, who
scored 23 points in the final and
29 points in 23 minutes against
Loyola. "That (outside shooting)
is a result of my summer's activi
ties (Pan Am games)."
Heading into a Saturday show
down with Colorado, Stanford
has a seven-game winning streak
dating back to last year and a
burst of adrenaline after beating
a Rice team that is projected for
the NCAA tournament.
"We didn't look so young, so
inexperienced and intimidated,"
said Montgomery. "This was a
