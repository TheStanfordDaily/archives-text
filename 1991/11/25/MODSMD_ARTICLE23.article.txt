# Spikers notch wins, records
## 
### George Malone Staff writer 
It may not have been pretty
this weekend, but No. 1 Stan
ford women's volleyball won,
and set several milestones in
the process.
The Cardinal defeated Ari
zona State on Friday 15-10, 15-
10, 15-13 and crushed Arizona
on Saturday 15-4, 15-12, 15-9.
Stanford improved to 27-0
overall and finished the Pacific
10 Conference season unde
feated (18-0) for the first time
in school history.
The win Friday night was
head coach Don Shaw's 200 th
career victory, raising his
record to 200-44. The Cardinal
defense gave Arizona State fits
as the Lady Sun Devils had

more errors than kills in the
first game. Despite holding it's
opponents to a low .080 hitting
percentage, Stanford senior
captain Kristin Klein didn't
feel that the match was one of
the team's best.
"We played a little sloppily,"
Klein said. "We didn't just go
out and dominate them and
play like the No. 1 team."
The Cardinal had its bright
spots, too, though, she said.
"We served them real tough
so they couldn't get their
offense going," Klein said. "We
also passed really well."
Klein led the team with 15
kills and 20 digs, and junior
Bev Oden contributed 10 kills
and 6 blocks. Senior Nicole
Appleman added 9 kills, 10 digs,
and a team-high .500 hitting per
centage. Senior Amy Cooper also
tallied 8 kills and 5 blocks.

Arizona, Saturday's opponent,
presented even less of a challenge
to the Cardinal. The Lady Wild
cats, winless in Pac-10 play this
season and 4-24 overall, didn't
stand a chance. Stanford over
whelmed the hapless 'Cats from
start to finish to seal the confer
ence title outright for the first
time since 1987.
"We didn't just go out and
dominate them, but we played
pretty well and got the win,"
Klein said. "We were pretty much
in control the whole time."

Klein felt that the team's
upcoming two-game road trip to
play No. 4 Hawaii over Thanks
giving was probably in the back of
everyone's minds.
"I think we were probably
looking ahead a little bit," she
said. "They're going to be real
tough over there."
Klein once again led the Cardi
nal with 18 kills while Appleman
had a phenomenal .667 hitting
percentage. Oden added 10 kills
and a match-high 10 digs.
With her last kill against Ari
zona, Klein became the Pac-10
all-time career kill leader with
1815. She passed both the second
place Lisa Arce and first-place
Tiffany Rochelle (both former
California Bears) Saturday night
to garner yet another conference
record.
Stanford closes out its season
with Wednesday and Friday night
matches at Hawaii. Sunday the
NCAA tournament pairings will
come out. The Cardinal should
host a first-round game here at
Maples Pavilion Dec. 6, and will
probably also host the West
Regionals Dec. 12-13.
