# 'Polo loses Big Splash, NCAA bid
## 
### Aden Fine StafF writer 
. It wasn't the best of weekends for the
Stanford water polo team.
As if losing to rival California in the annu
al Big Splash Saturday morning by a score of
11-6 was not bad enough, things got even
worse yesterday morning. The NCAA Rules
Committee informed the Cardinal that it
would not be invited to the NCAA Champi
onships.
Only five teams from California are
allowed to be in the eight-team tournament,
and the Committee decided that Long Beach
State, not Stanford, deserved the final spot.
Despite the Cardinal's early season strug
gles, the team had been playing exceptional
ly well lately and had come through with sev
eral key wins over top 10 squads. Neverthe
less, the Committee chose Long Beach for
the final position, most likely basing its deci
sion on the 49er's early-season 7-5 win over
Stanford.

Indeed, except for this head-to-head Long
Beach victory, Stanford appeared to have the
advantage because of its better record
against the teams that are going to be in the
championships.
As could be expected, the Stanford team
was not too happy with the selections.
"I don't see how they [the Committee]
could take Long Beach over us," coach Dante
Dettamanti said. "Our season had so many
games in it, and to base it on just one game
is not fair."
Sophomore Antonio Busquets was also a
little bit surprised by the news. "I'm pretty
sad and disappointed, because we really
thought we'd be going to the tournament,"

he said. "I think we're a much better team
than Long Beach is, and I think we would
have done a lot better than them in the tour
nament."
Nevertheless, as goalkeeper Larry
Bercutt noted, "We kind of put ourselves in
a hole by letting the Committee decide our
fate for us. I still believe we should have
gone, but I guess our early season troubles
came back to haunt us."
The Cardinal could have kept control of
its fate if the team had managed to beat
defending national champion and top
ranked Cal, but the Golden Bears were too
much for Stanford and emerged with the 11-
6 victory.
"They beat us on size and speed," Detta
manti said. "Our effort, by and large, was
there, but they just outmuscled us and
outswam us."
Nowhere was this more evident than in
the second quarter when Cal obliterated
Stanford's 1-0 first quarter lead by
scoring a remarkable seven goals
to take a 7-2 halftime lead.
The Cardinal staged a come
back in the third quarter, cutting
the lead to 7-5, but with eight sec
onds left in the period, the Bears

got a cheap goal to take the
momentum — and eventually the
game — away from Stanford.
"We really played with Cal for
three quarters, but we had a men
tal lapse for one quarter and that
just killed us," Bercutt said.
But the dead have been known
to rise, and with the entire starting
team back for next season, things
should be looking brighter for
Stanford this time next year.
