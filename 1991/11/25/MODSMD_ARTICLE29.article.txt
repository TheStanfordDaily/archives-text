# Curious students drawn to Ouija Society

The humming stops and silence
sets upon the room. The candle-lit
shadows continue their haunting
waltz with the darkness. All hands
lie transfixed on the Ouija board.
"Spirits, we await you," freshman
Sadat Huq chants, "please bless us
with your presence. ..
This scene surely strikes a
familiar chord with residents of
West Lagunita where a rapidly
increasing number of people are
experimenting with the mystical
Ouija board.
"I used to be a non-believer,
but now I just don't know,"
Adelfa freshman Joe Cervantes
said. "Some pretty weird stuff
happens in that room."
With headquarters in Eucalyp
to, the recently established Ouija
Society is operating in high gear.
Huq, one of the more active mem
bers, claims to have had direct
contact with several spirits.
"Last Wednesday night I was
contacted by a spirit named Cathy
who used to be a paper carrier in
Cerritos," Huq said. "She had
been killed in a hit-and-run by a
Mitsubishi Eclipse while biking
late at night. Incidentally, I drive
an Eclipse.
"Last spring, while I was in a
drunken stupor, a friend took my
car out for a spin," he continued.
"This was the only time that any
one else has ever driven my car.
Cathy not only said that the driv
er had black hair, but she also
stated that date."
Sophomore Delia Lopez said,
"Sometimes they take it too far.
The one time I entered the circle,
the board started to spell out D . . .
E . .. V ... then someone blurted
out, 'Are you the devil?' I panicked
and screamed. The board was
knocked over before it could

answer. The Society is toying with
some dangerous powers."
Why do they do it? What com
pels students to enter the Ouya
circle? For Eucalypto freshman
Philip Ortiz, it's "straight-up
curiosity." Ortiz said he was
recently contacted through the
board by a girl named Lisa.
According to Ortiz, Lisa's spir
it told the Ouija circle that she
had been raped and killed last
summer in Philadelphia by a man
she identified by name — who
had used Ortiz's switchblade.
"I remembered now that [a
man] had stolen my knife and
some money out of my room the
night of my graduation party, and
the next day he had left for
Philadelphia," Ortiz said. "[The
man], who had spent two years in
a mental hospital, strikes me as a
prime candidate for such an
offense."
Many students may have diffi
culty believing the validity of the
Ouija, but Eucalypto freshman
Arun Paul claims to have a ratio
nal theory. "When people congre
gate in a dark room and hum
themselves into a trance they cre
ate the perfect setting to channel
the subconscious," he said.
Using Paul's theory, Huq, for
example, might have had subcon
scious fears that his friend had
hurt someone with his car. These
fears might have crystallized into
a specific situation that developed
into the "Cathy" account.
Eucalypto Resident Assistant
Bill Candelaria said, "Using the
Ouija board is risky business.
Playing with subconscious emo
tions can have real debilitating
effects on people.
"These fears aside, however,
the Ouija Society has been an
excellent source of dorm bond
ing," Candelaria continued.

spirits already.
