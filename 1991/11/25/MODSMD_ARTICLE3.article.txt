# U.S. trade rep. pledges to open trade markets

### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
When Carla Hills was con
firmed as U.S. trade representa
tive in 1989, she pledged to open
markets "with a handshake â€”
and, if necessary, with a crow
bar."
Friday, Hills told a packed
audience in Bishop Auditorium
that she is using both as she tries
to open the world's markets to
free trade.
"Trade is a win-win situation,"
she said. "We press for open mar

kets in every form available to us."
Hills said the most recent
round of Uruguay trade talks
between 108 nations failed "for
lack of critical participation" and
blamed the the nations involved
for their reluctance to confront
the domestic constituencies that
lobby for economic protection.
"If we're going to get at this,
there are going to have to be very
tough political choices for every
nation at the table," she said.
The Bush administration has
had some success in reaching
bilateral and regional trade agree
ments, such as the North America
Free Trade Agreement, Hills said.
She added that success on this
continent won't stop the adminis
tration from seeking worldwide
agreements on lowered tariffs,
abolition of quotas and rules to
protect intellectual property.
"We have no intention of sup
porting an inward-looking trading
block," she said. "Our goal is to
reduce trade barriers whenever
and wherever we can."

Responding to questions from
audience members, Hills dis
agreed with the claim that small
er or less developed countries are
disadvantaged by free trade.
"Protection impedes innova
tion, it insulates business from
competition and it denies the joys
and luxuries of trade to con
sumers," she said.
Hills said U.S. protectionist
policy in the automobile industry
in the early 1980s led to the indus
try's inefficiency and eventual
failure against foreign competi
tion. The policy "set our industry
back and back badly," she said.
Hills said the Bush administra
tion will continue to pressure
Japan to open its economy to fair

competition. "The problem with
Japan is that we don't have parity
of opportunity," she said.
"We can choose together to open
up our markets and increase global
prosperity or sow the seeds for
geopolitical instability," she added.
Hills said increased interna
tional trade would help the U.S.
economy recover from its reces
sion. She cited the increase in
U.S. exports during the last four
years. "We've got to look to our
trade potential for the health of
our economy," she said.
In an interview after the speech,
Hills said she will not be a candi
date to be Stanford's ninth presi
dent. Hills said she is now at her
"ideal job" as trade representative.
