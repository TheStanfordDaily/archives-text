# Stanford fined $186,000
## EPA penalizes for past waste violations 
### June Cohen Mas Harntha Staff writers 
Stanford has been fined $186,000 for 25
violations of state regulations concerning
storage of hazardous waste.
The violations, which were identified dur
ing 1988 and 1989 inspections of Stanford's
hazardous waste storage facility, were all
corrected soon after they were reported,
according to Thomas Mcßride, director of
Environmental Health and Safety.
Stanford received notification of the penal
ty last week. Mcßride said he did not know
why the California Environmental Protection
Agency took two years to levy fines.
The inspection was conducted by the
state Department of Health Services and
centered primarily on Stanford's Environ
mental Safety Facility.
"None of the violations were for situations
posing imminent health or environmental

hazards," according to Harvey Chock, associ
ate director of Health and Safety.
Most of the violations were administra
tive, involving record-keeping, training and
other procedural deficiencies. Other viola
tions concerned improper waste storage
and labeling, Chock said.
"It seems to me somewhat irresponsible
and questionable that the Environmental
Protection Agency would decide two or
three years later that such stale, technical
violations called for a fine," Mcßride said.
Mcßride added he was meeting today
with representatives from the Legal Office
to discuss whether or not the University
would appeal the fine.
Chock said the center was suffering at
that time from a backlog of toxic and chem
ical waste. University officials were unable
to process materials as fast as they were
coming indue to unprecedented volume of
toxic waste being submitted for
disposal.
Mcßride said the unusual vol
ume of toxic and chemical waste
was due to the amount of publici
ty given to environmental health
and safety issues on campus in
1988, when an extensive audit
inspired many researchers to
clean out their laboratories and
workplaces.
Mcßride said the waste received
in 1988 was "far and away" the
heaviest volume of waste the facil
ity has ever received.
The vast majority of waste
received at the center is generat
ed by campus research, Mcßride
said. This waste is processed on
campus at the safety facility on
Oak Road. Some of it is recycled,
but most is packaged and shipped
to a licensed agency for disposal.
Mcßride said the center usual
ly deals with about 250,000
pounds of waste per year and
spends $1.5 million annually on
storage and disposal.
