Environmental Health and Safety.
Stanford received notification of the penal

state Department of Health Services and
centered primarily on Stanford's Environ

Most of the violations were administra

other procedural deficiencies. Other viola
tions concerned improper waste storage
and labeling, Chock said.
"It seems to me somewhat irresponsible
and questionable that the Environmental
Protection Agency would decide two or
three years later that such stale, technical
violations called for a fine," Mcßride said.
Mcßride added he was meeting today
with representatives from the Legal Office
to discuss whether or not the University
would appeal the fine.

to process materials as fast as they were
coming indue to unprecedented volume of
