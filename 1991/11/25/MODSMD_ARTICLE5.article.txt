# Judicial Board to discuss 'lethal' frat party decor
## 
### Julia Sobrevilla Staff writer 
Some members of the Judicial Board for
the Greek system will meet today with rep
resentatives of the Sigma Chi fraternity to
discuss disciplinary actions the University
may take after a Nov. 16 party was deemed
a fire hazard by Stanford Police.
Assoc. Dean of Residential Affairs Diana
Conklin, after inspecting the house after
the party, called the "Robin Hood" decora
tions "elaborate and creative and absolute
ly lethal."
Today's meeting will be an informal one,
according to Tresidder Asst. Director Nanci
Howe, who declined to comment on what
will be discussed. Howe is a member of the
Judicial Board.
"It is not intended to be a public process.
It is not a court case," Howe said.
Howe said she expects a judgment to be
reached by the end of this quarter, but that
"it is important to understand that we are
only at the beginning of the process. It
might take some weeks."
Sigma Chi President John Arrillaga said,
"We will basically work with the University
and clear the mess up as fast as we can."
Earlier this quarter a new Judicial Board
was established, replacing the previous
Interfraternity Council review panel. The
new board incorporates a broader cross-sec

tion of people, including staff members, and
was designed to grant students more self
determination over judicial matters within
the Greek system.
The board comprises 11 members, with a
six-member executive committee. The execu
tive committee includes Howe, Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson, Interfraternity Coun
cil Vice President Chris Flanagan, Intersoror
ity Council Vice President Aimee Meisenzahl,
Intersorority member Allison Berry and
Interfraternity member Steven Apfelberg.
The Judicial Board has not been recog
nized officially by the University. Howe said
she hopes that will happen early next quarter.
The ad hoc committee, established to
review the report of the Sigma Chi party,
includes ail the executive committee mem
bers except Jackson. This committee is also
reviewing allegations against the Theta Xi
fraternity.
However, the process surrounding this
case is not clear. The report may not go
through the Judicial Board, and instead
may be forwarded directly to Jackson.
According to ad hoc committee member
Apfelberg, this is a possibility because the
University wants to make a quick decision
regarding the case.
Jackson would not comment on the
issue. Arrillaga declined to say which fra
ternity members will meet today with the
ad hoc committee.
