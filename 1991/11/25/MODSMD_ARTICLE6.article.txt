"The Court is not a repair
shop for broken statutes."
Discussing the relationship
between the Supreme Court
and Congress, Supreme Court
Justice Anthony Kennedy col
orfully explained that while the
Court is the final arbiter of
constitutional issues, Congress
has an obligation to rewrite its
statutes if it doesn't like how
the Court treats them.
In particular, the Court's
so-called narrow interpreta
tions of 19th-century civil
rights legislation that prompt
ed new legislation this year,
Kennedy argued, were not
narrow, but simply reflections
of the obsolescence of that leg
islation and of the need for
Congress to rewrite it.
Before a full house in Kres
ge Auditorium Friday after
noon, Kennedy passionately
related his opinions on this
and other issues facing the
Court in the 19905.
The Stanford Federalist
Society was instrumental in
bringing him to campus.
Kennedy began his speech
humorously by referring to Big
Game, noting that he regards
his annual bet on Stanford as a
"good investment."

of the Constitution to everyone's
life. Calling it "one of the great doc
uments of Western thought," he
said the "Constitution isn't just the
province of judges and lawyers. It's
for everyone."
Using a chalkboard as if teach
ing a class, Kennedy explained the
structural mechanisms of the
Constitution. He discussed the
concepts of separation of powers,
checks and balances, judicial
review and federalism.

Still, he urged his listeners to
remember that the Constitution
shows "new truths to each gener
ation," noting each generation has
the right and duty to put its own
stamp on the destiny of a people.
Following his speech, Kennedy
answered questions from an
inquisitive audience. When asked
about the dynamics of the Court
after a new justice takes the
bench he said, "The Court is very
changed after a new appointee."
Kennedy, a Reagan appointee,
also discussed the year's first con
ference of the justices â€” the first
in decades without either William
Brennan or Thurgood Marshall.

Kennedy acknowledged their
tremendous contributions and
emphasized the "obligation" pre
sent justices still have "to repre
sent their voices" while in confer
ence.
Some questions addressed cur
rent issues, and one alluded to the
confirmation of recently appointed
Justice Clarence Thomas. Com
menting on the confirmation pro
cess, Kennedy said, "I liked my
own."
Kennedy also urged students to
think about philosophical issues of
justice and government while
striving to do something that
"gives your existence meaning."
