Nathanson proposed marriage
to Leslie Hamilton, Class of '89,
through a crossword published in
the Image magazine insert of last
Sunday's edition of the San Fran
cisco Examiner.
The Merl Reagle puzzle, titled
"Terms of Engagement," was
designed to have the words "DEAR
LESLIE, WILL YOU MARRY ME
— NEIL" written in the center.
Hamilton said she did not sus
pect anything, even when the
answers had something to do with
her. "I just told him, 'Hey, this
puzzle is made for me,' " she said.

"I only realized what it was when
I got to the part about the mar
riage proposal. I said yes, and we
didn't finish the puzzle — in fact,
it's still not done."
Nathanson said he had written
to Reagle several months ago, ask
ing him to create a puzzle that had
three themes running through it.
"There was a general marriage
theme, the proposal and then
things about Leslie." he said.
The clue for "Leslie" was
"Actress Caron," and the clue for the
marriage was "a modest proposal."
According to Nathanson, the
couple met two years ago and
began dating a few months later.
He came up with the idea for the
crossword puzzle marriage pro
posal because the two always did
the Reagle puzzles together on
Sundays, he said.
"That was how we first started
courting — because we had to sit

so close together when we did the
crossword puzzles," he said.
Nathanson got a special copy of
the puzzle from Reagle on Satur
day. "The squares about Leslie
were highlighted lightly in pink,
and the ones with the proposal
were in blue," he said.
"He brought the Chronicle over
on Sunday," Hamilton said. "He
read a few sections and was acting
very casual. I was reading for a
while, until he said, 'Let's do the
crossword puzzle.'"
Nathanson said he was very
nervous. "It took her 20 to 30
minutes to do the puzzle, and my
heart was beating really fast the
whole time. The last part of the
proposal she got was her own
name," he said.
"It's definitely something to
tell the kids," Hamilton added.
The wedding date has not yet
been set.
