# Citizen Biddle plans to play larger role in politics
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
These days Paul Biddle is
beginning to sound like a man
running for public office. Unsure
about whether to begin a cam
paign, he jumps at the chance to
discuss why accountants such as
himself have a responsibility to
fight for the taxpayer and should
play a larger role in politics.
"There are very few people in
California, or even the United
States, that have had the impact
on containing waste and abuse in
the federal government that I have
had in universities," the on-cam
pus Office of Naval Research regu
lator said in an interview with The
Daily last week. "A lot of people
who are frustrated with waste and
abuse in government cleave to the
Paul Biddle personality."
Biddle announced last week
that he is contemplating a cam
paign for the U.S. Senate in next
fall's election. If he were to run,
the outspoken regulator would

likely challenge Sen. John Sey
mour in the Republican primary
for the two-year seat created
when Gov. Pete Wilson resigned
last year.
"With the Seymour seat, I could
set the trend and benchmark in a
two-year public service role with
high visibility," said Biddle, who
promised to make a decision some
time in January. "And at the end
of two years, I can get out.
"I like the idea of going in and
getting out," he added. "There are
many people in the public sector
who have never worked a day in
their life in business. But we
should not have career bureaucrats
in government who have no experi
ence in the real business world."
Biddle, who is also considering
taking a regulatory position with
in another administrative agency
or creating a foundation to assess
government's performance, said
he wants to weigh his "responsi
bility to the taxpayers" against
the personal drawbacks of life in
Washington, D.C.

"I don't really know if I would
enjoy living in Washington, D.C.,"
Biddle said. He cited the cold
weather and the need to find a
new school for his son as reasons
against running for Senate.
"The personal dynamics of
running for office are not encour
aging. But on a citizenship level, it
is much more compelling," he
said.
Biddle said he has received a
lot of support from many people
within government as well as out
side businessmen, including old
clients from his days as an
accountant.
For instance, Biddle said a citi
zens group in California has
approached him about becoming
the first "elected audit czar" if the
position were created in a ballot
initiative in the next election.
"My integrity is communicat
ing very positively. Not that I am
pure, because everybody makes
mistakes. . . . But the average cit
izen thinks that Paul Biddle has
integrity," he said.

Biddle added that his experi
ence in promoting fiscal responsi
bility is something needed in gov
ernment.
"I have a different emphasis
versus most people in political life.
I don't dispute the humanity side,
but my emphasis is in quantitative
analysis," he said. "People who
are not wrapped up in the num
bers don't communicate the mes
sage that numbers can provide.
"Conservatives like me for that
reason," he added.
Although he is "not thinking in
terms of great social impact," Bid
dle said "a lack of fiscal responsi
bility has screwed over the entire
system by not focusing on the sig
nificance of the family."
He said he believes family
housing and "stabilized retire
ment settings" for the nation's
elderly are two issues that must
be addressed now, or "it will be
too little, too late."
Biddle said that as an accoun
tant, he "can quantify and mea
sure the impact of proposals, such

as a tax credit" to promote retire
ment savings and provide capital
for low-cost loans to first-time
home-buyers.
"These are the things that
accountants think about â€” sim
plistic, fundable proposals that
take the decision-making process
out of government," he added.
Using his "bully pulpit," Biddle
predicted that he "could be hell on
wheels" for just about everyone.
"I don't feel much affection for
government oversight of my life
and the lives of others, and I also
don't feel much respect for people
in the private sector who suck our
blood through government inter
face," he said.
"My dad was always so busy
protecting the integrity of his
family that he never took on chal
lenges outside of the family. ... I
know that my dad regretted that
he hadn't done more ... to try to
change the system," Biddle said.
"I have always tried to live my life
so that at the end I can say that I
did, and I did."
