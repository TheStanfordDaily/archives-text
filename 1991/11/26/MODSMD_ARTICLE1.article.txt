# Police: No molestation of child at care center
## 
### Holly Hacker Editorial staff 
A three-week investigation has con
cluded that no child molestation occurred
at the Children's Center of the Stanford
Community, Stanford Police announced
yesterday.
"Our investigation showed that there
was no criminal molestation," said Detec
tive Sgt. Del Bandy.
Bandy said the police conducted inter
views with people involved, including the
little girl and teacher, brought in a mental
health professional, gave the child a medi
cal examination — which revealed no
signs of molestation, according to Sgt.
Hilary Karp — and administered a poly
graph test to the teacher. The investiga
tion ended Friday.
The polygraph test, which the teacher
volunteered to take, "showed he was being
truthful" about his innocence, Bandy said.
While the teacher did not intentionally
hurt the child, Bandy said, "I do believe
something occurred" at the center.
According to Bandy, the girl could have
been injured "from any number of

sources," such as playing with the teacher.
Her parents are "relieved that she
wasn't molested," Bandy said, although
he noted that they too "believe some inci
dent did occur."
However, "The teacher has no idea how
anything could have occurred," Bandy
added.
The investigation began after the cen
ter's director, Nancy Golden, notified the
police and Santa Clara County Child Pro
tection Services on Oct. 31 of allegations
that a teacher had molested a child at the
center. The child's parents brought the
allegations to the center the day before.
Police are withholding the child's age.
The parent- and teacher-run day-care
cooperative on the Stanford campus cares
for 220 children ranging from infants to
five-year-olds.
Last week, police announced they
would try to find out why the child com
plained to her parents. But yesterday,
Bandy said it is "probably impossible to
determine for sure" what prompted the
child to make the allegation.
