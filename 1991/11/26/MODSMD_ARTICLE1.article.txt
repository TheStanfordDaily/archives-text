# Police: No molestation of child at care center
## 
### Holly Hacker Editorial staff 
A three-week investigation has con
cluded that no child molestation occurred
at the Children's Center of the Stanford
Community, Stanford Police announced
yesterday.
"Our investigation showed that there
was no criminal molestation," said Detec
tive Sgt. Del Bandy.
Bandy said the police conducted inter
views with people involved, including the
little girl and teacher, brought in a mental
health professional, gave the child a medi
cal examination — which revealed no
signs of molestation, according to Sgt.
Hilary Karp — and administered a poly
graph test to the teacher. The investiga
tion ended Friday.
The polygraph test, which the teacher
volunteered to take, "showed he was being
truthful" about his innocence, Bandy said.
While the teacher did not intentionally
hurt the child, Bandy said, "I do believe
something occurred" at the center.
According to Bandy, the girl could have
been injured "from any number of

sources," such as playing with the teacher.
Her parents are "relieved that she
wasn't molested," Bandy said, although
he noted that they too "believe some inci
dent did occur."
However, "The teacher has no idea how
anything could have occurred," Bandy
added.
The investigation began after the cen
ter's director, Nancy Golden, notified the
police and Santa Clara County Child Pro
tection Services on Oct. 31 of allegations
that a teacher had molested a child at the
center. The child's parents brought the
allegations to the center the day before.
Police are withholding the child's age.
The parent- and teacher-run day-care
cooperative on the Stanford campus cares
for 220 children ranging from infants to
five-year-olds.
Last week, police announced they
would try to find out why the child com
plained to her parents. But yesterday,
Bandy said it is "probably impossible to
determine for sure" what prompted the
child to make the allegation.
The teacher was put on paid
administrative leave after the center
reported the incident to the police.
In a letter sent to parents and
staff at the center yesterday,
Golden and Laurie Schofield, pres
ident of the center's board of direc
tors, said the teacher will remain
on leave until the board meets next
month with him, the child's family
and other teachers and parents to
determine what action to take.
Schofield declined to comment
on why the center is keeping the

teacher on leave despite the out
come of the investigation.
One employee said no parents
had removed their children from
the center because of the allega
tion and investigation.
While the letter said that "the
past three weeks have been filled
with stress and frustration for all of
us," it added that "the emotional
climate at the center has remained
calm and essentially unchanged."
Bandy said the police have not
received any other allegations
from parents at the center.
The board of directors will meet
early next month with parents who
want to discuss the events of the
past three weeks, the letter noted.
