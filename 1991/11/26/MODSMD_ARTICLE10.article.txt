# Libertarian VP candidate calls for scaling-back of government
## Lord opposes speech codes, supports drug legalization 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Derisively calling America's
two major political parties the
"Demopublicans," Nancy Lord,
vice-presidential candidate for the
Party of Libertarian Opportunity,
is seeking attention as a thorny
alternative to the status quo.
"The Republicans and the
Democrats may have different
raps, but what they do is actually
the same," Lord said in an inter
view yesterday.
Lord is running with Andre
Marrou, the Libertarian presiden
tial candidate. She said her party
hopes to get a million votes in the
1992 presidential election, "which
will send a message that cannot
be ignored."
The Libertarians' proposals,
she said, are based on the idea
that people solve their own prob
lems better than the government
ever could.
"When the government gets
involved, they interfere on behalf
of the rich and wealthy, not the
poor and struggling," Lord said.
Lord said her libertarian phi
losophy leads her to oppose speech
regulations, like Stanford's inter
pretation of the Fundamental
Standard, that outlaw discrimina
tory harassment. She asserted
that speech codes force people to

be politically correct in their state
ments, adding that women and
minorities can defend themselves.
"The idea that women and
minorities have no power in con
versation" is more insulting than
any verbal insult, Lord said.
She received her medical degree
in 1978 from the University of
Maryland and her law degree in
1990 from Georgetown University.
She has run her own medical and
legal consulting business in
Washington, D.C. since 1983.
Lord said to protect individual
freedom, Libertarians oppose gun
control and the welfare state, but
support industrial deregulation

'When the govern
ment gets involved,
they interfere on
behalf of the rich and
wealthy, not the poor
and struggling.'

and drug legalization.
The medical industry is proof
of the problems of regulation,
Lord said. Mandatory insurance,
regulation of new drugs and pre
scription requirements conspire
to cause unnecessary procedures
and unnecessary prices, she
added.
Government enforcement of
industry regulations also tends to
reinforce monopoly by assisting
mainly the largest companies, she
said.
According to Lord, the govern
ment's drug war is "spilling over
to the point where kids are get
ting shot over a jacket." Although
she said she does not condone the
abuse of substances, Lord believes
the drug war should be ended.
According to Lord, social pro
grams should be abolished.
Welfare is set up to reinforce
bureaucracy and "not let anybody
out of the system," Lord said.
