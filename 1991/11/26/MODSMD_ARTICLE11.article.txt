Trial date set for Thomas
Senior Stuart Thomas was arraigned in
Santa Clara County Court yesterday afternoon,
and the trial date was set for Dec. 23.
Yesterday's proceedings were a formality to
transfer the case from Palo Alto Municipal
Court to county court in San Jose, where all
alleged sex crimes are tried. Thomas is charged
with unlawful sexual intercourse with a female
minor, a felony, and providing alcohol to a
minor, a misdemeanor, in connection with an
alleged Sept. 22 sexual assault in Stern Hall.
The attorneys will meet with a judge in cham
bers Dec. 18 to say whether or not they will be
ready by the trial date.
Deputy District Attorney Linda Condron said
it is unlikely that a trial would actually begin on
Dec. 23. Instead, she said the court would prob
ably schedule a trial for a later date, depending
upon availability of courtrooms.

Former regulator retires
Robin Simpson, the director of the West Coast
regional office of the Office of Naval Research,
retired from government service on Nov. 15.
Before taking the position in the Monterey
office, Simpson was the on-campus regulator at
Stanford — the position now held by Paul Biddle.
Biddle has alleged that many of the indirect
cost agreements signed between the govern
ment and the University while Simpson was in
charge were "too cozy" and should be reviewed.
Simpson was disciplined last May for his han
dling of Stanford, and he retired instead of
accepting a reassignment in Washington, D.C.,
at a lower pay grade, according to Office of
Naval Research spokesman Norm Hanson.
The University declined to comment on the
matter.
