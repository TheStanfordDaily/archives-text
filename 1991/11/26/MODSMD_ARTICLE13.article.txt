## Encina Gym must stay 
### 
THE DEPARTMENT OF Ath
letics must cut $700,000 from
its operating budget next
year. In order to meet these goals,
the department has to reduce its
support for educational and recre
ational programs by $400,000.
Despite these numbers, Encina
Gym or an equivalent facility must
remain open amid the paring from
the budget.
Encina Gym is probably the most
used athletics facility at Stanford.
Students frequently use the facili
ties to take a break from studies in
order to pursue some degree of
physical fitness. To these students,
Encina is an invaluable asset.
The University recently built the
Ford Center to fulfill a "targeted
student need." It would be bitterly
ironic to see the Ford Center and
the money it represents stand next
to a vacant Encina Gym, closed in
order to trim a small amount from
the Athletics Department budget.

Merging Roble and Encina Gyms
would be unacceptable unless Roble
Gym were greatly expanded. Cur
rently, Roble Gym could not begin
to accommodate the equipment nor
the people of Encina.
If a user fee must be levied in
order to save the gym, so be it. While
such a solution would be undesir
able, as athletes who are serious
about recreation and physical fit
ness, many Stanford students would
be willing to pay a nominal user fee.
The other proposed cuts in the
Athletics Department, while hard
to take, are acceptable. The student
golf-round subsidy can be cut, sav
ing a quick $25,000. The physical
education subsidy can also be
reduced along with the club-sports,
martial-arts and dance subsidies.
The reduction of Athletics Depart
ment subsidies will make student life
harder, but in the wake of the bud
getary problems, life cannot be as
easy as it once was.
