CHANGES IN IMMIGRATION
and labor laws that make it
harder for international stu
dents to obtain off-campus employ
ment took effect Oct.l.
A new law stipulates that employ
ers who consider hiring internation
al students must post their job offer
ings to American students for at
least 60 days before they may actual
ly hire an international student.
These changes affect the 1,440 Stan
ford students who hold F-l visas.
The 60-day advertisement rule is
a xenophobic law that makes inter
national students' lives significantly
harder. It should be repealed.
No reason exists to save jobs for
American students if a more quali
fied international student can do the
job. Clearly, the basic arguments
against any kind of protectionism
apply. International students who
have superior skills can only help
the American economy thrive.
America should set the standard
for bringing down all kinds of barriers
to international work and trade. Cer

tainly we wouldn't want our overseas
students subjected to hiring practices
that are biased against them.
International students have a
hard enough time adjusting to a
new setting; they should not have
to deal with artificial, government
created barriers.
The 60-day advertisement rule
is also a significant obstacle for
international students when sum
mer jobs are considered. Valuable
summer jobs may be out of reach
for international students because
many firms do not advertise for a
long period of time. Thus the req
uisite 60 days may not pass in
order to enable the hiring of an
international student.
Indeed, many jobs are not adver
tised at all, thus cutting cfT a range
of opportunities for many interna
tional students.
The federal government should
repeal the new law in favor of legis
lation that would provide equality
of opportunity for international
students.
