Retirees also getting short end of insurance stick

IN REFERENCE TO PAUL Stiles'
Nov. 12 letter to The Daily, I'd like to
"speak up" not as a single non-union
employee without dependents, but as a
single retiree without dependents who was
formerly a member of United Stanford
Workers and who is no longer covered by
the Union contract.
I am being unjustly burdened by Stan
ford's medical cost-cutting efforts also!
I am just amazed that Stanford can
forget so soon. At the retirement semi
nars I attended, it was my understanding
that, as a single person without depen
dents, if I took out Medicare part "B," the
premium for the medical plan of my

choice would be paid in full by Stanford.
I am now paying for Medicare part "B"
from my "fixed income," and guess what?
Now Stanford wants me to pay a premi
um — not solely to benefit me or others
like me but to accommodate employees
with dependents.
I will be required to pay at least $59.90
per month each and every month until such
time as the $29.90 for Medicare or the
$26.00 for Take Care is increased. I feel this
is unfair because in paying for Medicare part
"B" I am fulfilling Stanford's term as stipu
lated above, and as of April 1992 they will no
longer be willing to pay the full premium for
me. So much for "planning for your retire-

ment years." Nothing is for certain any
more, and this is only the beginning!
I'd also like to point out another
inequity as I see it. When I was an active
employee, why didn't Stanford provide me
with additional medical benefits? They are
paying considerably more in dollars for
medical insurance premiums for employ
ees with dependents than they were for
singles with no dependents.
I didn't think it was fair for one
employee to reap more in dollar cost
value in benefits no matter how many
dependents he or she may have.
An article I read recently stated that
employees with dependents are provided

educational benefits for their dependents
if they wish to take advantage of them. I
know of nothing of equal or even of simi
lar value that is offered to a single
employee without dependents.
I agree that help is definitely needed to
pay the premiums for medical coverage
for employees with dependents, but Stan
ford is the one who started paying addi
tional benefits for them, and the financial
burden should continue to be Stanford's
and Stanford's alone and certainly not
that of the single employee/retiree with
not even one dependent.
