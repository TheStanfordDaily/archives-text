# Homophobia still felt at University — pitiful state of affairs indeed
## 
### 
As a freshman this year at Stanford, I
have had some amazing experiences that
I've been very thankful for. Until last
night, all of them had been positive.
Last night, as I was sitting in the
lounge of my dorm, I heard a small
group of guys talking about going out to
fight a pair of homosexuals they had
seen outside just a few minutes before.
The only reason they could give for this
was that they wanted to "take care" of
the "fags" outside.
Here I am, listening to this at Stan
ford University. By any standard, I
attend one of the world's greatest uni
versities. Stanford attracts people of the
highest caliber, and yet I discover com
plete ignorance in some areas. Is there
any hope for us?
Those who would harm people for
being of a different sexual orientation
are no different than the slave owners
who felt that they had the right to buy
and sell human beings like animals, or

the Nazis who oversaw the slaughter of
the Jewish people in World War 11.
The ignorance never goes away — it
just seems to change forms, and this
ignorance only leads to hatred and fear
on both sides. When I see this happening
in an environment that supposedly has
the best and the brightest, I can only
shake my head and wish that what I wit
nessed was a rare incident, but I don't
think it was.
Can there be any hope in a society
that clings to its prejudices with vio
lence? Perhaps someday people will look
beyond the exterior and truly see people
for who they are. But tonight I can only
be ashamed of the world I live in.
