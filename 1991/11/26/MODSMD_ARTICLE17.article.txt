# Too many stereotypes already face Arabs for letter's negative images
## 
### 
I find Marco Schuffelen's Nov. 19
letter on the Palestinian-Israeli con
flict highly questionable. His neglect
ing to address the torture, detainment,

house demolition, deportation, land
confiscation, employment deprivation,
periodic massacres and weekly air
bombings (in southern Lebanon) of
Palestinians creates a significant flaw
in his argument.
However, Schuffelen's arguments
about the nature of the conflict do not
disturb me as does his propagation of
racist attitudes toward Arabs.
He describes the Palestinian struggle
for what the Palestinians see as their
homeland as a "vain attempt to have the
Holy Land revert to its pre-Zionist stu
por." Arabs in general are "intolerant
and imperialist."
He recognizes that there is a stereo
type in America of Arabs being "warlike
and uncompromising," and then he calls
the Palestinians "hooligans."
This sort of analysis is not only use
less, but abhorrent. Arabs living in
America see enough discrimination,
racism and hate every day.
The conflicting claims to the land of
Palestine/Israel may be solved one day,
but people like Schuffelen only make the
achievement of this goal harder by prop
agating hateful messages.
