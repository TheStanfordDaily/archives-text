# Sunday Flicks offers apology for overflow at last Sunday's show
## 
### 
To anyone turned away at the Nov.
24 Sunday Flicks: I want to offer my sin
cere apologies for not being able to
accommodate you. I wish I could have
let everyone in, but the auditorium was
filled to capacity, and letting more peo
ple in would have resulted in a violation
of fire codes and the possible shutdown
of Flicks.
ASSU Sunday Flicks is a fun and
long-standing Stanford tradition.
However, we can only seat 1,700 peo
ple per show. I would stress that there
were and always have been plenty of
seats available at the 7 p.m. show. If
you are ever in question of seat avail
ability at Flicks, I recommend attend
ing the 7 p.m. show or arriving at
least 15-20 minutes before the 10 p.m.
show.
Again, my apologies for the inconve
nience. See you at the Flicks.
Jonathan Hoekstra
Manager, ASSU Sunday Flicks
