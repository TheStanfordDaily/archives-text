# The
						child of Webb Ranch
## ... who's now at Stanford

Sophomore Jorge Solis ended up going to
college two minutes from his birthplace.
That fact is impressive when you consider
that the school is Stanford University and the
place was Webb Ranch.
The 273-acre plot of land, leased to the
Webb family by the University since 1922, is a
vegetable and berry farm that employs many
Mexican immigrants. It is located off Alpine
Road near Highway 280.
"I grew up at Webb Ranch because my parents
used to work there when they emigrated from
Mexico," said Solis, the co-chair of MEChA a Chi
cano/Latino student group. "I lived there until I
was five, and then my parents moved to Redwood
City to look for better working conditions."

Fellow Cecilia Burciaga.
Having grown up economically disadvan

School in Redwood City — didn't think he

university.
"I didn't see myself going to college," he
said. "First of all, I couldn't afford it. Second of
all, I didn't have the grades. Third of all, I
wasn't motivated."
Solis attributes his turn-around to his fami

tions such as Migrant Education. "I was helped
a lot. Mr. Martinez, the vice-principal of my
high school, took me in and helped me become
involved and empowered. I got the confidence
to do different things," he said. "Also the fact
that my parents took the chance to come from
another country and learn a different language
is really inspiring."
Roberto Martinez, who is the principal of
the Sequoia District Adult School, said, "When
I first met Jorge I knew he had these natural
