# The 						child of Webb Ranch
## ... who's now at Stanford 
### Carrie Chang Staff writer 
Sophomore Jorge Solis ended up going to
college two minutes from his birthplace.
That fact is impressive when you consider
that the school is Stanford University and the
place was Webb Ranch.
The 273-acre plot of land, leased to the
Webb family by the University since 1922, is a
vegetable and berry farm that employs many
Mexican immigrants. It is located off Alpine
Road near Highway 280.
"I grew up at Webb Ranch because my parents
used to work there when they emigrated from
Mexico," said Solis, the co-chair of MEChA a Chi
cano/Latino student group. "I lived there until I
was five, and then my parents moved to Redwood
City to look for better working conditions."
For years, the workers at Webb Ranch
sought fair compensation and improved living
facilities, Solis said. In December 1989, the
workers voted to join the United Stanford
Workers, and a contract signed the following
April ended a year-long stalemate between the
Webbs and the USW.
"To my knowledge, Jorge is the first and
only student to have lived in Webb Ranch and
come to Stanford," said Casa Zapata Resident
Fellow Cecilia Burciaga.
Having grown up economically disadvan
taged, Solis — as a sophomore at Sequoia High
School in Redwood City — didn't think he
would end up attending Stanford or any other
university.
"I didn't see myself going to college," he
said. "First of all, I couldn't afford it. Second of
all, I didn't have the grades. Third of all, I
wasn't motivated."
Solis attributes his turn-around to his fami
ly, individuals at his high school and organiza
tions such as Migrant Education. "I was helped
a lot. Mr. Martinez, the vice-principal of my
high school, took me in and helped me become
involved and empowered. I got the confidence
to do different things," he said. "Also the fact
that my parents took the chance to come from
another country and learn a different language
is really inspiring."
Roberto Martinez, who is the principal of
the Sequoia District Adult School, said, "When
I first met Jorge I knew he had these natural
leadership abilities that made him
want to succeed in classes but also
go beyond that He wanted to
help people around him."
Solis has not only been involved
on campus as co-chair of MEChA,
but has also managed to stay in
touch with the Chicano/Latino
community in Redwood City and
East Palo Alto through tutoring
and mentor programs.
"Jorge is not only active on
campus, but he is very well

known in his hometown of Red
wood City," Burciaga said. "I'm
amazed at how he balances his
commitment to school with his
outside activities."
She added, "He mentors chil
dren. You watch him live out his
beliefs."
Although Solis no longer
lives at the ranch, he still keeps
in touch with his relatives who
work there and remembers the
changes that took place in 1989.
"I remember my uncles talk
ing about the union coming and
trying to create better benefits
for the people," said Solis, who
worked on the ranch when he

was 14. "For the first time, I
saw people being angry, work
ing for self-empowerment and
going out there and demanding
better working conditions."
Solis said that although
workers now receive better pay
as a result of the new contract,
production has been cut back,
and working conditions haven't
changed that much.
"There were some improve
ments, but the fact is that peo
ple didn't really follow up. A lot
of people at the ranch felt like
they were being exploited as an
issue because people were com
ing from all over the state
because of Stanford's involve
ment, and as time passed people
lost interest," he said.
Although Solis said he
believes that Stanford has many
resources, such as El Centro
and Casa Zapata, that have
helped create a sense of commu
nity among Chicanos and Lati
nos, he believes the administra
tion's commitment to multicul
turalism could be stronger.
"The 1989 [University Com
mittee on Minority Issues]
report recommends more Chi
cano faculty, more staff at theme
houses," Solis said. "They spent
$2 million on this report, and it's
just sitting there, with no
progress being made. There is
the problem with the budget
cuts, but the commitment that
should be there isn't there."
Solis first became involved
with MEChA toward the end of
his freshman year, when he
joined a committee to bring
United Farm Workers Presi
dent Cesar Chavez to campus.
"We were thinking, 'How are
we going to greet this person?
He's going to have a delegation or
send someone,'" Solis said.
"Instead he came by himself. We
walked out and there was this
older man. He looked like my dad
or something. He was a common
person. He seemed really humble.
Even though he's become a
national Chicano leader, he's kept
in touch with the community."
"Humble" and"in touch with
the community" are words often
used to described Solis. Said
Burciaga, "He's never self
aggrandizing. He barely knows
the word 'I' or the word 'me.' He
works with a humility and quiet
strength."
