## Let's not jump the gun

I FIND IT IRONIC THAT MANY peo
ple on campus who claim to suffer
from blind stereotypes will themselves
apply blanket labels to others in particu
larly sensitive situations. Such action can
hinder our ability to engage in open-mind
ed communication, the most important
element of interpersonal understanding.
An acquaintance's reaction to my last
column — on political correctness — high
lighted the difficulty groups face when
open-minded communication is not used.
I found out in a roundabout way that
my column on political correctness had
offended an African-American I've
known for three years as well as a few
other people of color with whom she had
spoken. I was quite bewildered.
Yes, I'm a person-absent-of-color
with-a-penis. (That's PC for white male.)
Last week I satirized the extremes to
which the objectives of the PC movement
have been taken, and I poked fun at
potential reconstructions of words based
on unrelated similarities.
Apparently, she and others miscon
strued the column as ridiculing both the
National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People and the importance of
racial equality. I was perplexed as to how
they could have interpreted it that way.
She told me I had a lot of nerve criti
cizing an organization that I know little
about. I answered that it never occurred
to me that the column would be inter

preted in that way, given the well-known
important achievements of the NAACP.
She said she laughed about everything in
my column until the last paragraph, which
mentioned the abbreviation NAACP. I
asked if that was because it involved the
group about whom she feels most strongly.
Apparently, she interpreted the last two
words, "How appropriate," as commentary
on the NAACP. She assumed I was ridicul
ing its objectives and associating it with the
silliness I was characterizing.
I explained that when I wrote "How
appropriate," I meant that it's a humorous
coincidence that the NAACP would become
the NAAPC after proper substitutions. It's
amusing because "people of color" is one of
the most widely-known PC terms, and
therefore it's "appropriate" that when
applying it to the name of an organization
founded and named by people of color, the
abbreviation ends up as it does.
As I was simply pointing out humor
ous examples of semantic manipulations
to which PC, when allowed to run ram
pant, might lead, I was surprized by how
quickly this intelligent person threw me
into the "white male oppressor" category.
Certainly, writing is open to interpre
tation. But the fact that someone — espe
cially someone I know — would ignore
the opportunity to discuss it with me —
and instead shove me into a category of
enemies — was sort of scary.
I felt as though there was a precon

ceived classification in which I was sup
posed to fit, and any action or speech of
mine that could be construed as consistent
with that stereotype would serve as confir
mation that I belonged in that group.
Fortunately, we were able to discuss it
enough to realize that we didn't really
disagree all that much. I was able to learn
something about her feelings and about
how my writing might be construed in
ways different from what I intended. She
was able to realize that perhaps she had
been a bit eager to condemn me without
giving me an opportunity to speak.
But I have a feeling that when it comes
to the most sensitive personal issues, such
a scenario does not usually have this type
of resolution. So I hope we will all take the
time to ask the next "bad guy" what he
really means before we write him off,
because true understanding cannot exist
without open-minded communication.
Automatically thrusting people into cat
egories is not open-minded in anybody's
book and does not contribute to the neces
sary understanding of each other that is
prerequisite for peaceful coexistence.
