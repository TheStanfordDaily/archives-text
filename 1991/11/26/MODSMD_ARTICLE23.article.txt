## Men's swimming team forges lead in Pac-10s 
### Tish Williams Staff writer 
The Stanford men's swim team makes
the Pacific 10 Conference look like the Paly
High swim team. After only two days of
competition, the Cardinal leads California
and UCLA, who are tied for second place, by
200 points in the Conference Champi
onships.
Stanford annihilated the competition
assembled in Long Beach, bringing the Car
dinal ever closer to its eleventh straight
Pac-10 title. The multi-talented squad dom
inated several events while toppling records
throughout the day.
"The team is doing a great job competing
internally. They swim very well against
each other," asst. coach Ted Knapp said.
Brian Retterer, who set an American
record in the 100-yard backstroke Sunday
night in the lead-off leg of a relay, broke his
record yesterday in the individual 100 back.
Retterer lowered his mark to 46.50,
breaking teammate Jeff Rouse's NCAA
record of 46.63. Rouse came in second in the
event, even though he was competing
unshaved.
"Rouse is still on target to be the first
man under 46 (in the 100 back)," Knapp
said of the world-record holder.
Josh Mikesell came in third to complete
a Cardinal sweep of the event.
Chas Morton, who set a Pac-10 record
Sunday in the 200 Individual Medley, won
the 400 IM yesterday, setting a new Pac-10
meet record. Morton's time places him sec
ond on Stanford's all-time 400 IM list.
Tyler Mayfield, one of the other
unshaved Cardinal swimmers, won the 100
yard breaststroke, amazingly beating the
shaved competition.
"Tyler's time was one of the fastest

unshaved ever (in his event). He's one of
only a few athletes ever to win a conference
title unshaved," Knapp said.
J.J. Freitag took third in the event, after
sitting out last season with a broken back.
Both Freitag and Mayfield beat the defend
ing NCAA champion in the 100 breast
stroke.
Stanford finished strongly in the 100 fly
as well, with Trip Zedlitz coming in second
in 47.85, placing him at fifth on Stanford's
all-time 100 fly list, behind three
Olympians.
Brad Budney, Kevin Henderson, Bill
Schell, Clay Tippins and Ray Carey also
swam in the 100 fly, and all came in below
the NCAA consideration standard.
Stanford exhibited its strength in the
relays as well, as Rouse, Mayfield, Zedlitz
and Retterer combined to win the 200 med
ley relay in an NCAA qualifying time.
Stanford came in third in the 800 free
relay as well, even though the Cardinal
was one of only two teams to have no
individual finalists competing in the 200
free. Tippins led off for Stanford, achiev
ing a personal record by a second, fol
lowed by Eddie Parenti, Dan Kanner and
Retterer.
Today is the final day of swimming com
petition, although the results will be unoffi
cial until the diving championships take
place in February. The Cardinal is geared
up to set more Pac-10 records today and get
more swimmers qualified for the NCAA
championships in March.
"Maybe we can set a new scoring record
today, or a margin of winning record,"
Knapp speculated.
Stanford is competing amazingly, con
sidering four of its best swimmers are
swimming unshaved and are concentrating
instead on the Olympic Trials in March.
