Last Friday, Stanford's wrestling

north to unfriendly confines at UC-

Davis. The Mustangs were tamed, how
ever, as the Cardinal emerged victorious
24-19.
Stanford coach Chris Horpel expected
a challenging match from Davis and
knew the Mustangs would be very up for
the meet. Since Davis is the only UC
school with a wrestling team, the Mus
tangs view it as quite an event.
"To them, it was kind of like 'Big
Meet'," Horpel said. "They had a real
home advantage, and their crowd was
very excited. Their whole team was real
ly into it. We had to get equally
pumped."
And that they did. The spirit was
taken out of the feisty Mustangs quickly,
as the first four matches went to the Car
dinal. Phil Nowick (118 pounds) and
Dave Nowick (126 pounds) started the
match with respective wins of 17-5 and
17-7. Jay Jackson (134 pounds) then got
in on the action by scoring a 15-3 win,
and, not to be outdone, Lance Johnson
(142 pounds) defeated his opponent by a

score of 14-6.
"Our lightweights offer immediate
spark," Horpel said. "They dominated
this time as they usually do."
Victories were also garnered by cap
tains Matt Topham (167 pounds) and
Mark Graham (190 pounds) by scores of
11-3 and 13-3, respectively. The heavy
weight match was forfeited by Stanford,
as the meet was clinched following Gra
ham's major decision, and hence was not
necessary for the second meet in a row.
Jeremy Friedman (150 pounds) lost
his match 5-13 to Davis' Dwight Weevie,
and Stanford's Bob Becker (158 pounds)
lost by the narrow margin of 2-6. In the
177-pound weight class, the Card's Greg
Green lost by a fall.
It is the second consecutive meet that
these three weight classes have lost.
While Horpel does see these bouts as
something to be worked on, the domi
nance of the other weights may be
enough to give these three classes time to
catch up. And it is matches such as the
one against Davis which will give the Car
dinal valuable opportunities to better
itself.
"Their coach did a good job," Horpel
said. "They were in good shape physical
ly and technically. It was a hard-fought
match â€” Davis was really out for the
win. We wrestled well. IThe Stanford
wrestlers] did a good job neutralizing
[Davis'l enthusiasm."
The next challenge for the men of the
mats will come Friday, Nov. 29. They will
travel even farther north to Eugene to
take on the Oregon Ducks and will hope
to continue their early season success.
