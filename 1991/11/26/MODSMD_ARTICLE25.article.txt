# Big Game reflections
## 
### 
A potpourri of ponderings fol
lowing such a Big Week in
Stanford sports:
• Birth of a legend: the Now
Boys. Who'd a thunk it? A victory
sure, but 38-2171
• I'd just like to point out that
there are only so many one-sylla
ble words that rhyme with "Ow!"

in the English language.
• You'd think after last year's
spirit-crushing loss that the Gold
en Bears would have learned that
personal fouls are counter-pro
ductive.
• Concerning all the on-field
talking between the teams, Chris
Walsh was quoted as saying, "As
long as it's not to the extent that
you're getting a penalty or letting
it take you out of your game,
you're okay." Weenies probably
should read that sentence one
more time, slowly, while concen
trating.
• Oak Grove High School prob
ably has a number of future Bears

on its football roster. The Eagles
were hit with six unsportsman
like-conduct penalties in their
California Central Coast Section
playoff loss on Saturday.
• Stanford coach Dennis Green
knew where it was at; he kept giv
ing the ball to "Touchdown"
Tommy Vardell — 39 times, to be
exact. You don't mess with suc
cess.
• Cal coach Bruce Snyder
messed with success. Why didn't
Russell White get the ball 39
times?
• Good thing for Snyder that
Cal is not Alabama. He'd be fired
for losing to Stanford. While
building a powerful program at
Cal, Snyder has gone 0-4-1
against the Cardinal.
• Although almost none of the
pre-game taunting was based on
legitimate argumentation, my
favorite fallacious taunt was one
by a Cal player: "When I heard
that Stanford beat Cornell, I
knew they were a real football
powerhouse." First, it's kinda
funny on its own. Second, the
irony kills me. A Cal player is
making fun of Stanford's sched
ule?!!
Hey if we had played Cal's
schedule, we would have ranked
No. 6, too. As it was, our strong
schedule probably helped us pre

pare better to face the Bears.
• It also will help us defeat the
other defending national champi
on on Christmas day.
• It seemed like on some plays
Bob Whitfield blew his man so far
off the line that he was ten yards
downfield. Hmmm. There's an
idea for the Aloha Bowl. Hey,
Denny, how about giving Whit
field the ball? Just once.
• I've already heard a ton of
"WouldaCouldaShoulda" quotes
from the Bears. Quit your whin
ing, weenies. Accept reality. You
lost. Period.
• This is it for the women's vol
leyball team. They are women
with a mission. Regardless of
what happens in Hawaii, they are
out to show the country that they
are no longer the NCAA's brides
maids.
• How 'bout that women's bas
ketball team! If the Cardinal can
trounce the nation's No. 4 team
by 26 points in a hostile gym, who
knows what this "rebuilding

year" has in store for the team?
Another national championship,
perhaps?
• Of particular note in the
cagers' early-season success is
redshirt junior Chris MacMur
do. In the exhibition victory
over the South Australian All-
Stars, MacMurdo scored a
career-high 22 points and
grabbed nine rebounds. She has
proven now that these figures
were no fluke. She hit for 18
points against Georgia and 22
against Notre Dame. She is
shooting 80 percent from the
charity stripe and an unbeliev
able 70 percent from the field.
MacMurdo, who was injured her
freshman year, is finally show
ing the form that once earned
her the title of the Converse
National High School Player of
the Year.
• The men's hoops squad has
also performed well in its first
couple of games. If the athletes
play to their potential and suc
cessfully navigate a brutal Pac-10
schedule, the question will not be
"will they go to the postseason?"
but "which postseason tourna

ment will they go to?"
• Finally, Marcus Lollie and
Brent Williams are getting the
playing time they deserve. Pos
sibly the two most athletic play
ers on the basketball team, they
are sure to become major play
ers in the Cardinal's success.
And with opponents preoccupy
ing themselves defending Adam
Keefe, these two are sure to
light it up.
• The quicksilver Lollie, who is
a consummate ball-handler, has a
confidence in his abilities that
manifests itself in sure, steadfast
leadership on the court. That
translates into steady, consistent
team play — something not nor
mally associated with young
teams — and that translates into
wins.
• No contest — 11th consecu
tive Pac-10 title for the men
swimmers.
• Take heed, NCAA: Dante
Dettamanti's troops shall return.
• Go Card!

Thanks to the Now Boys, Tyson
Vaughan will graduate without
ever having lost the Axe.
