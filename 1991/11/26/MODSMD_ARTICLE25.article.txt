# Big Game reflections
## 
### 
A potpourri of ponderings fol
lowing such a Big Week in
Stanford sports:
• Birth of a legend: the Now
Boys. Who'd a thunk it? A victory
sure, but 38-2171
• I'd just like to point out that
there are only so many one-sylla
ble words that rhyme with "Ow!"

in the English language.
• You'd think after last year's
spirit-crushing loss that the Gold
en Bears would have learned that
personal fouls are counter-pro
ductive.
• Concerning all the on-field
talking between the teams, Chris
Walsh was quoted as saying, "As
long as it's not to the extent that
you're getting a penalty or letting
it take you out of your game,
you're okay." Weenies probably
should read that sentence one
more time, slowly, while concen
trating.
• Oak Grove High School prob
ably has a number of future Bears

on its football roster. The Eagles
were hit with six unsportsman
like-conduct penalties in their
California Central Coast Section
playoff loss on Saturday.
• Stanford coach Dennis Green
knew where it was at; he kept giv
ing the ball to "Touchdown"
Tommy Vardell — 39 times, to be
exact. You don't mess with suc
cess.
• Cal coach Bruce Snyder
messed with success. Why didn't
Russell White get the ball 39
times?
• Good thing for Snyder that
Cal is not Alabama. He'd be fired
for losing to Stanford. While
building a powerful program at
Cal, Snyder has gone 0-4-1
against the Cardinal.
• Although almost none of the
pre-game taunting was based on
legitimate argumentation, my
favorite fallacious taunt was one
by a Cal player: "When I heard
that Stanford beat Cornell, I
knew they were a real football
powerhouse." First, it's kinda
funny on its own. Second, the
irony kills me. A Cal player is
making fun of Stanford's sched
ule?!!
Hey if we had played Cal's
schedule, we would have ranked
No. 6, too. As it was, our strong
schedule probably helped us pre
