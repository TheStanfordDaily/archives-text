## 
### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
As the season wears on, the Stanford
women's swimmers are making one
thing perfectly clear — they'll be the
team to beat when the NCAA Champi
onships roll around in March.
Although physically worn down from
a period of intense training, the squad
still found a way to dominate a field of
some of the best competition in the
country last weekend, swimming
strongly at the Texas Invitational in
Austin.
"We swam extremely well overall,"
said junior Janel Jorgensen, who quali
fied for NCAAs in four events. Jor
gensen qualified in the 100-meter but
terfly, the 100 and 200 freestyle, and
the 200 individual medley. In the 100
fly she finished fifth overall with a time
of 1 minute 2.03 seconds.
Stanford swept the top five collegiate
places in the event with Jenny Thomp
son and Angie Westerkrieg taking sec
ond and third overall."We had to be
tough mentally because we were so bro
ken down physically," Jorgensen said.
The meet had no official winner, as it
was not scored. However, unofficial
scoring kept by Stanford had the Cardi
nal dominating the competition, easily
outdistancing its opponents by over 100
points midway through the three-day
event. "Hopefully, this will be a good
indicator of how we do at NCAAs," Jor
gensen said.
The talented field included the
defending NCAA champion Longhorns

'We did a great job. Even outside the pool, our
team was the best on the deck, when it came to
backing each other up, and getting into each
other's races.'

Texas A&M, Rice, and Indiana.
"We did a great job," Jorgensen said.
"Even outside the pool, our team was
the best on the deck, when it came to
backing each other up, and getting into
each other's races."
Not to be outdone by Jorgensen,
teammates Lori Heisick, Summer
Sanders, and Lea Loveless also quali
fied for nationals.
Sanders beat former teammate, and
now Texas asst. coach, Janet Evans in
the 400 IM. She won the 200 fly in
2:13.67. Freshmen Julie Kole and
Becky Crowe finished fifth and sixth,
respectively. In the 200 IM Sanders
edged Jorgensen.
Sanders finished second to Heisick in
the 100 fly. Loveless, a former Florida
Gator, garnered a first place for the
Cardinal in the 100 backstroke. Love
less placed second in the 200 back and
Sanders took fifth.
Thompson won the 50 free, defeat
ing Leigh Ann Fetter, a former Texas
sprinter. Fetter, a 1991 Longhorn grad
uate, won the NCAA title in the 50 free

four years in a row.
The Cardinal relay teams also did
well. Stanford's 400 medley relay team
of Loveless, Heisick, Sanders and

The diving contingent was led by
sophomore Eileen Richetelli, who
placed in the top five of both the one

both events.
With another convincing perfor
mance against Texas, the Cardinal has
shown that it deserves the title of
favorite in the NCAA Championships.
Stanford had already defeated Texas in
a season-opening dual meet.
Next in line for the women swim
mers is the U.S. Open, which will be
held Thanksgiving weekend in Indi
anapolis.
