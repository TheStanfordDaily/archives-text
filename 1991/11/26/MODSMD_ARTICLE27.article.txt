# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
With every season, turn, turn, turn .... In
no situation is that phrase more appropriate
than in describing this week's Athletes of the
Week.
Garnering the honors are football's
Tommy Vardell and basketball's Chris
MacMurdo.
After starting the season 1-3, Vardell
helped the Cardinal win seven straight
games.

With 182 yards on 39 carries, Vardell
spearheaded the Cardinal offensive attack in
the Big Game 38-21 victory over Cal. The
Bears could not stop Vardell all day as he
scored three Stanford touchdowns. The
fifth-year senior sealed Cal's fate with the
Cardinal's last score, a 13-yard rumble late
in the fourth quarter.
Vardell not only ran but also made sever
al drive-saving catches. Quarterback Steve
Stenstrom found Vardell out of the backfield
four times for 42 yards.
"He had an unbelievable game — he tore
them apart," wide receiver Chris Walsh
said. "He's a man among boys. He loves the
game and he just went out there and took
charge today."
In the process, Vardell set several single
season school records. Big Game was his sev
enth 100-yard game of the year, and in it he
scored his 20th touchdown. "Touchdown
Tommy" rushed for 1,084 yards in 1991,
breaking Darrin Nelson's record of 1,069 set
in 1977.
❖ ❖ ❖
While Vardell was ending his regular sea
son on a high note, Chris MacMurdo was
beginning hers with strains of the same
melody. The junior forward, who redshirted
freshman year due to back injury, led all
Cardinal scorers in season-opening victories
over No. 4 Georgia and Notre Dame.
Against the Bulldogs, she was 7-of-10
from the field and 4-of-5 from the free throw
line for an 18-point total. She also keyed the

transition game with eight defensive
rebounds. The Cardinal won, 92-66.
The Irish fared no better as MacMurdo
tallied 22 points, 18 from the Held. In the
88-76 victory, she shot 80 percent from the
charity stripe, mirroring her performance
against Georgia.
Earlier this year MacMurdo scored 22
points and snared nine rebounds in an exhibi
tion win over the South Australian All-Stars.
