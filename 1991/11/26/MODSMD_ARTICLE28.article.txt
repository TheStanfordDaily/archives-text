# Fencers stab Bears in the neck

### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
It may not have been Big Game, but the Big
Fence, a dual meet between the Stanford and Cal
ifornia fencing teams Friday, was important indi
cation of things to come when the season resumes
in the winter.
In their first home appearance this fall, the
Cardinal men's and women's teams earned a
sweep over their archrivals by scores of 19-8 and
12-4, respectively.
On the men's side, the Card took two of three
weapons from the Bears. The sabre events were
swept by senior Leonard D'Amico and juniors Keith
Early and Glen Wong, who led a 9-0 Stanford rout.
Epee competition saw seniors Tim Yee and Dave
Brody, juniors Jeremy Nelson and Adrian Klein and
freshman Robert Weisz post a 6-3 mark in the
Card's favor. But with Stanford's top Olympic
prospect, senior Nick Bravin, sitting the meet out
for training, Stanford fell short 4-5 in the foil.
In spite of a losing effort in the final discipline,
coach Zoran Tulum reserved his highest praise for
freshman Geoff Donaker and sophomores Ryan
Kaltman and Sam Kim, the young foil squad that
battled without its leader. "It was a good way to
take a good look at everyone and see how they

stand up under pressure," Tulum said.
However, any expectations for the men's foilers
could not have matched the pressure placed upon
Stanford's four women. Coach Sherry Posthumus
saw her group of foilers pull off a huge victory
despite the absence of the only team member with
any experience in intercollegiate events, injured
junior Lana Kane.
Sophomore Thea Wojtkowski and freshmen
Anna Cummins, Cherise Melton and Allison Lee
ensured that Stanford did not miss a beat without
Kane they showed signs that a tradition which has
seen Cardinal women take nine consecutive West
ern Intercollegiate Championships may easily be
upheld in the upcoming campaign.
"It was neat to be able to hold Lana out and let
the other girls stand on their own two feet and
fence," Posthumus said.
Both teams will make their next appearance in
a six-way meet featuring MIT, UC-San Diego, UC-
Santa Cruz, Cal State Fullerton, and Cal Jan. 11,
with the Western Intercollegiate and NCAA
Championships to follow in March.
With a pair of big wins in the Big Fence already
notched, though, Stanford's youthful fencers appear
poised not only to "stand on their own two feet and
fence" in 1992, but also to make a serious dent in their
foes' armor right now and for several years to come.
