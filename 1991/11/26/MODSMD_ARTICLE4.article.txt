# Many concerned about future of UCMI goals

The current round of budget cuts
has many faculty and staff worried
about the future of the University's
plans to build a more diverse, multi
cultural community.
Many of these concerns were raised in
a recent review of Stanford's progress in
implementing the recommendations of
the 1989 University Committee on
Minority Issues.
Members of the review panel and
other faculty and staff have recom
mended further action in certain areas
— changes that may be more difficult
to make given Stanford's financial
problems.
Black Community Services Center
Director Keith Archuleta said, "Two
years ago, the initial round of budget
cuts left the centers frozen, underfund
ed and understaffed. We're limping and
they want to cut off the other leg."

According to Direc
tor of Multicultural
Development Sharon
Parker, "Budgets cuts
could impact all of us
who care. We are
watching and talking,
trying to figure out
what's essential.
There's not a lot of L
consensus."

Jim director of the Native
American Community Center, said that
because "the student body is more
diverse than anytime in the Universi
ty's history," the community centers
are needed more than ever and the Uni
versity "needs to take this into
account."
The increased diversity of the stu
dent body has forced the community
centers to "stretch dollars and
resources," said Asian American Activ
ities Center Director Rick Yuen.
"We're really getting squeezed."

Archuleta, said, "The population is
changing and the institutions are hav
ing a hard time adapting to the new pop
ulation. We are, in essence, being cut.
We're being asked to do more with less."
Another problem is the fact that the
UCMI recommendations for the com
munity centers have not been fulfilled,
directors say.
"Three full-time staff members
were recommended," Yuen said. "We
never lobtained] the third staff posi
tion, which there is a definite need for."
Members of the recent review panel
also suggested that the needs of other
groups — including women and dis
abled people — should be examined.
"The discussion this year expressed a
lot of concerns about expanding the area
looked at to include other groups that
have been subject to affirmative action
and anti-discrimination laws," said Asst.
Linguistics Prof. Gregory Guy, a UCMI
review panel member and member of the
disabled staff forum.

Guy said he is concerned about "the
issue of disability, where the University
has its poorest record." Although "the
University is supposed to be committed
by affirmative action plans and its stat
ed policies to try and increase the num
ber of disabled employees, those fine
words don't seem to have been imple
mented in practice," he added.
Assoc. Dean of Memorial Church
Diana Akiyama, also a UCMI panel
member, expressed concern about the
status of women in the University fac
ulty and staff. "Even though UCMI
was specifically designed to look at the
race, gender dynamics and sexism are
still issues," she said.
The 1989 UCMI report examined
diversity in five areas: undergraduate
curriculum, faculty, admissions and
financial aid, student life and staff.
The UCMI recommendations, which
focus on racial minorities, are a "first
