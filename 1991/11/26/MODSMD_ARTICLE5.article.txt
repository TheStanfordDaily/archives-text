# Group aims to fight 'PC' influences here

Has P.C. Hammer, the char
acter in this year's Gaieties who
advocated politically correct
speech by singing "Can't say
this," finally met his match?
The National Association of
Scholars might have implicitly
answered that question when it
opened a Stanford chapter last
week.
The association, a conserva
tive group of about 2,000 mem
bers around the country, was
formed to oppose what they call
"political correctness," which
they define as orthodox political
views which lead to restricted
speech and academic rights.
John Bunzel, a senior
research fellow at the Hoover
Institution and a member of the
Stanford chapter, said a growing

number of faculty members and
graduate students want "code
words" such as "diversity,"
"multiculturalism" and "educa
tion equality" to be better
explained and debated.
The Stanford chapter has
already welcomed more than 20
faculty members in its first week.
Its creation was inspired by the
association's success at Duke
University, according to French
Prof. Robert Cohn.
Cohn, the "convenor" of the
Stanford chapter, said political
correctness has considerably
undermined academic freedom
on campus through its "politi
cization of learning." According
to Cohn, strong abuses of political
correctness have corrupted the
legitimacy of renowned literary
works and ways of teaching them.

German Studies Prof. Gerald Gillespie is a member of Stanford's new chapter of the
National Association of Scholars. He accuses the University administration of set
ting up the "Trojan horse" of multiculturalism to teach the Stanford campus how to
"think right."
"Some students are afraid of
being called racist," Cohn said,
referring to students shying away
from classes in his department
because of their supposedly "un-
PC" content.
Cohn will retire from the Uni
versity at the end of the quarter
because he claims the political
atmosphere of the campus has
contributed to poor attendance
for his classes and seminars.
Cohn is an authority on French
writer Stephane Malarm§.
Sharon Parker, director of the
Office for Multicultural Develop
ment, agreed with Bunzel on one
point. People in the Stanford
community have an "erroneous
notion [of] code words" such as
"affirmative action," she said.
She argued, however, that
political correctness is only a "red
herring," a side issue distracting
people from the main issue of
racial and cultural diversity.
But for Gerald Gillespie, Ger
man professor and courtesy pro
fessor in the Comparative Litera
ture Department, political cor
rectness is right at the center of
the controversy.
Gillespie, a member of the
Stanford chapter of the associa
tion, warned that political correct
ness is setting up "Trojan horses"
on campus. He said one of them
clearly appears in the "Affirma
tive Action Plan For Stanford
University 1989-1991," a 24-page
brochure prepared by Parker and
approved by University President
Donald Kennedy.
The brochure was issued on
Oct. 16 and presents various Uni
versity policies and data on the
multicultural diversity program
set up by the administration and
organized by Parker's office.
Gillespie dismisses most of the
brochure content as "empty and
too idealistic." But what frightens

him, he said, is a paragraph on the
future role of multiculturalism at
the University that recommends
"a transformation to ensure that
multiculturalism is infused into
(not appended) to all aspects of
teaching, research, planning, poli
cies, practices, achievements and
institutional life."
Gillespie said he strongly
opposes the predominance and
omnipresence of multiculturalism
at the University as it is stated in
the brochure.
Whoever has the control and
power of defining multicultural
ism, Gillespie explained, would
have political control of the whole
University.
"This is not diversity, this is
conformity," Gillespie warned. The
University will soon turn into a
parochial and quasi-totalitarian
institution if teaching fellows from
all over the world have to pledge
allegiance to a common social doc
trine, he said.
Gillespie said he blames
Kennedy for wasting time and
energy on "his grandiose plan of
social transformation" when
"starved" departments crumble
in the "crisis-ridden" University.
The Kennedy administration
has introduced a "Trojan horse"
called multiculturalism and will
use it as a pretext to teach the
Stanford campus how to "think
right," Gillespie said.
Gillespie also said graduate
students often ostracize distin
guished scholars in small depart
ments such as French and Italian
because students disagree with
the treatment of academic materi
als on political grounds.
For instance, Cohn is criticized
for not studying Malarm6 with a
deconstructionist paradigm.
In small departments with few
graduate students or resources,
such as German Studies and
French, Gillespie said, students
pressure their peers not to choose
certain classes.
Social influence is powerful
enough to dissuade some graduate

students from taking classes that
do not fit the predominant political
norms of the student body of the
department, Gillespie said, com
paring these student political
groups to "thought police."
But Russell Berman, German
professor and chair of the Ger
man Studies department, said he
does not think student pressures
are responsible for the under
enrollment of certain classes in
his department.
In his entire career at Stan
ford, Berman said, no student has
ever complained to him of unfair
treatment due to "political bully
• _ W
ing.
Gillespie declined to reveal
names of graduate students who
he says have been targets of pres
sure, for fear of "betraying" them
and having them "threatened" by
their peers.
Gillespie noted that Berman has
more than 20 dissertation students
in his class, a significant number
for the size of the department,
because he is a "neo-Marxist."
Berman argued that politics
play no part in the choice and size
of classes. He said he wishes Gille
spie were "more cautious" about
political labels and that he regrets
that Gillespie has never talked to
him before about this problem.
Gillespie said he has attempted
to appeal to the Office of the Dean
of the School of Humanities and
Sciences, but it has been "hope
less" because no one wants to talk
about the situation.
Cohn said he first realized stu
dents were deliberately avoiding
his class when Ronald Garwood, a
black graduate student, became
interested in the professor's writ
ings and decided to take Cohn's
seminar on French writer Charles
Baudelaire ten years ago.
But, according to Cohn, the
graduate student was advised by
his peers not to enroll in the course
because Cohn did not hold "politi
cally correct" views. Since that
first incident, Cohn said, the trend
has continued.

acter in this year's Gaieties who

right," Gillespie said.
Gillespie also said graduate
students often ostracize distin
guished scholars in small depart
ments such as French and Italian
because students disagree with
the treatment of academic materi
als on political grounds.
For instance, Cohn is criticized
for not studying Malarm6 with a
deconstructionist paradigm.
In small departments with few
graduate students or resources,
such as German Studies and
French, Gillespie said, students
pressure their peers not to choose
certain classes.
Social influence is powerful
enough to dissuade some graduate

students from taking classes that
do not fit the predominant political
norms of the student body of the
department, Gillespie said, com
paring these student political
groups to "thought police."
But Russell Berman, German
professor and chair of the Ger
man Studies department, said he
does not think student pressures
are responsible for the under
enrollment of certain classes in
his department.
In his entire career at Stan
ford, Berman said, no student has
ever complained to him of unfair
treatment due to "political bully
• _ W
ing.
Gillespie declined to reveal
names of graduate students who
he says have been targets of pres
sure, for fear of "betraying" them
and having them "threatened" by
their peers.
Gillespie noted that Berman has
more than 20 dissertation students
in his class, a significant number
for the size of the department,
because he is a "neo-Marxist."
Berman argued that politics
play no part in the choice and size
of classes. He said he wishes Gille
spie were "more cautious" about
political labels and that he regrets
that Gillespie has never talked to
him before about this problem.
Gillespie said he has attempted
to appeal to the Office of the Dean
of the School of Humanities and
Sciences, but it has been "hope
less" because no one wants to talk
about the situation.
Cohn said he first realized stu
dents were deliberately avoiding
his class when Ronald Garwood, a
black graduate student, became
interested in the professor's writ
ings and decided to take Cohn's
seminar on French writer Charles
Baudelaire ten years ago.
But, according to Cohn, the
graduate student was advised by
his peers not to enroll in the course
because Cohn did not hold "politi
cally correct" views. Since that
first incident, Cohn said, the trend
has continued.
Has P.C. Hammer, the char
acter in this year's Gaieties who
advocated politically correct
speech by singing "Can't say
this," finally met his match?
The National Association of
Scholars might have implicitly
answered that question when it
opened a Stanford chapter last
week.
The association, a conserva
tive group of about 2,000 mem
bers around the country, was
formed to oppose what they call
"political correctness," which
they define as orthodox political
views which lead to restricted
speech and academic rights.
John Bunzel, a senior
research fellow at the Hoover
Institution and a member of the
Stanford chapter, said a growing

number of faculty members and
graduate students want "code
words" such as "diversity,"
"multiculturalism" and "educa
tion equality" to be better
explained and debated.
The Stanford chapter has
already welcomed more than 20
faculty members in its first week.
Its creation was inspired by the
association's success at Duke
University, according to French
Prof. Robert Cohn.
Cohn, the "convenor" of the
Stanford chapter, said political
correctness has considerably
undermined academic freedom
on campus through its "politi
cization of learning." According
to Cohn, strong abuses of political
correctness have corrupted the
legitimacy of renowned literary
works and ways of teaching them.

German Studies Prof. Gerald Gillespie is a member of Stanford's new chapter of the
National Association of Scholars. He accuses the University administration of set
ting up the "Trojan horse" of multiculturalism to teach the Stanford campus how to
"think right."
"Some students are afraid of
being called racist," Cohn said,
referring to students shying away
from classes in his department
because of their supposedly "un-
PC" content.
Cohn will retire from the Uni
versity at the end of the quarter
because he claims the political
atmosphere of the campus has
contributed to poor attendance
for his classes and seminars.
Cohn is an authority on French
writer Stephane Malarm§.
Sharon Parker, director of the
Office for Multicultural Develop
ment, agreed with Bunzel on one
point. People in the Stanford
community have an "erroneous
notion [of] code words" such as
"affirmative action," she said.
She argued, however, that
political correctness is only a "red
herring," a side issue distracting
people from the main issue of
racial and cultural diversity.
But for Gerald Gillespie, Ger
man professor and courtesy pro
fessor in the Comparative Litera
ture Department, political cor
rectness is right at the center of
the controversy.
Gillespie, a member of the
Stanford chapter of the associa
tion, warned that political correct
ness is setting up "Trojan horses"
on campus. He said one of them
clearly appears in the "Affirma
tive Action Plan For Stanford
University 1989-1991," a 24-page
brochure prepared by Parker and
approved by University President
Donald Kennedy.
The brochure was issued on
Oct. 16 and presents various Uni
versity policies and data on the
multicultural diversity program
set up by the administration and
organized by Parker's office.
Gillespie dismisses most of the
brochure content as "empty and
too idealistic." But what frightens

him, he said, is a paragraph on the
future role of multiculturalism at
the University that recommends
"a transformation to ensure that
multiculturalism is infused into
(not appended) to all aspects of
teaching, research, planning, poli
cies, practices, achievements and
institutional life."
Gillespie said he strongly
opposes the predominance and
omnipresence of multiculturalism
at the University as it is stated in
the brochure.
Whoever has the control and
power of defining multicultural
ism, Gillespie explained, would
have political control of the whole
University.
"This is not diversity, this is
conformity," Gillespie warned. The
University will soon turn into a
parochial and quasi-totalitarian
institution if teaching fellows from
all over the world have to pledge
allegiance to a common social doc
trine, he said.
Gillespie said he blames
Kennedy for wasting time and
energy on "his grandiose plan of
social transformation" when
"starved" departments crumble
in the "crisis-ridden" University.
The Kennedy administration
has introduced a "Trojan horse"
called multiculturalism and will
use it as a pretext to teach the
Stanford campus how to "think
right," Gillespie said.
Gillespie also said graduate
students often ostracize distin
guished scholars in small depart
ments such as French and Italian
because students disagree with

als on political grounds.
