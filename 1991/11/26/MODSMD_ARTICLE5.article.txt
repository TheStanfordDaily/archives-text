Has P.C. Hammer, the char
acter in this year's Gaieties who
advocated politically correct
speech by singing "Can't say
this," finally met his match?
The National Association of
Scholars might have implicitly
answered that question when it
opened a Stanford chapter last
week.
The association, a conserva
tive group of about 2,000 mem
bers around the country, was
formed to oppose what they call
"political correctness," which
they define as orthodox political
views which lead to restricted
speech and academic rights.
John Bunzel, a senior
research fellow at the Hoover
Institution and a member of the
Stanford chapter, said a growing

number of faculty members and
graduate students want "code
words" such as "diversity,"
"multiculturalism" and "educa
tion equality" to be better
explained and debated.
The Stanford chapter has
already welcomed more than 20
faculty members in its first week.
Its creation was inspired by the
association's success at Duke
University, according to French
Prof. Robert Cohn.
Cohn, the "convenor" of the
Stanford chapter, said political
correctness has considerably
undermined academic freedom
on campus through its "politi
cization of learning." According
to Cohn, strong abuses of political
correctness have corrupted the
legitimacy of renowned literary
works and ways of teaching them.

German Studies Prof. Gerald Gillespie is a member of Stanford's new chapter of the
National Association of Scholars. He accuses the University administration of set
ting up the "Trojan horse" of multiculturalism to teach the Stanford campus how to
"think right."
