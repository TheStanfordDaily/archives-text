# Months after ASSU approval, amendments are still unsigned
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
The three amendments to the ASSU
Constitution passed in last spring's gen
eral election have not yet taken effect
because they have not been signed by
University President Donald Kennedy.
The amendments deal with the scope
of the ASSU's powers to represent stu
dents and make minor procedural
changes in the way the Senate operates.
Robert Hamrdla, assistant to the pres
ident, has been on vacation and said he

did not see the amendments until yester
day. Hamrdla said the amendments prob
ably reached his office sometime after
Oct. 31.
Hamrdla said that while he did not
know when Kennedy would sign the
amendments, action is "not going to take
very long."
One possible reason this year's
approval process is slower than last
year's is confusion over whether the
amendments must pass through the
Dean of Students' Office before reaching
the president.

Hamrdla said Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Jackson must review the amend
ments so that he can advise Kennedy on
whether to approve them.
However, Solina Kwan, last year's
senate chair, said the amendments from
the election before last were sent directly
to Kennedy.
Officials in the dean's office could not
be reached for comment yesterday.
ASSU Senate Deputy Chair Neil Crellin
said ratification of the amendments has
taken a "considerably longer time" than in
previous years.

For a proposed amendment to be
passed, it must be approved by two-thirds
of students who vote in a campus-wide
election. An amendment is in force only
after it is signed by the president.
Crellin said he was told to send the
amendments through Jackson's office.
He added that he does not think Jackson
intentionally held up the amendments
but was busy with "all the other interest
ing things that have been going on in the
University."
One amendment limits the senate's
"right to represent the entire Stanford

student body in non-University affairs"
to matters "directly affecting Stanford
students."
A second amendment states that the
senate and Council of Presidents
"should not make blanket statements
claiming to represent every Stanford
student on state, national or interna
tional issues."
The third amendment, written by
Kwan, changes the language of several
largely administrative sections of the
constitution "to reflect existing policy
and procedure" of the senate.
