Pentagon may help Haitians
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon is
prepared to build an emergency camp for
refugees on the U.S. Navy Base at Guantanamo,
Cuba, to help contain Haitians still fleeing their
island nation by boat, administration sources
said yesterday.
Word of the plan came as the crisis in Haiti
deepened. Hopes for a political settlement suf
fered a setback and the flood of refugees
increased dramatically.
A Marine general would be placed in charge
of the effort and a military police detachment
sent to keep order, according to one source.
The State Department reported 815 Haitians
were rescued by the Coast Guard on Sunday, the
largest single-day total since the exodus began
almost a month ago.
Bush snubs anti-crime bill
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush
threatened Yesterday to veto the anti-crime leg
islation heading for a final vote in Congress,
accusing Democrats of producing a bill that
actually would weaken law enforcement.
Democrats who rammed the bill through a
weekend House-Senate conference countered
that Bush was looking for an excuse to scuttle
the package because it would impose a waiting
period for handgun purchases.
Communist wins election
MOSCOW (AP) — Rakhman Nabiyev, the
old-line Communist leader in Tadzhikistan, won
57 percent of the vote in the presidential elec
tion for the Central Asian republic, according to
preliminary results Yesterday.
Reformer Davlat Khudonazarov, Nabiyev's
main challenger, claimed Sunday's vote was rigged
and demanded the election be declared invalid.
