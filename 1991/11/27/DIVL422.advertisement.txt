It took Galileo 16 years to master the universe.
You have one night.
It seems unfair. The genius had all that time. While you have a few
short hours to learn your sun spots from your satellites before the
dreaded astronomy exam.
On the other hand, Vivarin gives you the definite advantage. It helps
keep you awake and mentally alert for hours. Safely and conveniently. So
even when the subject matter s dull, your mind will stay razor sharp.
If Galileo had used Vivarin, maybe he could have mastered the solar
system faster, too. _ _
