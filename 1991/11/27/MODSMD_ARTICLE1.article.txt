# A 						cold warrior in a new world order
## Scaled-down SDI proposed; many still object 
### Alain Dalva Staff writer 
President Reagan publicly
introduced physicist Edward
Teller's most controversial
brainchild, the Strategic Defense
Initiative, in a 1983 speech.
Teller's system, dubbed "Star
Wars" by its detractors, was to
include both a nationwide and a
space-based defense system that
would block a massive nuclear
attack of Soviet intercontinental
ballistic missiles.
Today, despite the dwindling
Soviet threat, Teller still advo
cates a space-based defensive
shield — but he says its objectives
must be different from those orig

inally proposed for SDI. He
acknowledges that the present
changes in the Soviet Union are
"so thorough and unexpected"
that the problems are different
from 10 years ago.
To meet the changing situa
tion, President Bush proposed a
new role for SDI in his January
State of the Union address. The
program's new directive, called
Global Protection Against Limit
ed Strikes, is designed to empha
size defense against a missile
attack from any part of the world,
rather than just the Soviet Union.
"It's a change in concept in
terms of scope and purpose," said
Mike Doble, chief of SDl's news
branch. "It would be protection

against a limited strike, rather
than the thousands (of missiles)
we had been talking about before."
He explained that GPALS, the
friendly Pentagon acronym for
the system, would counter threats
such as accidental launches or
one-time strikes from a Third
World dictatorship.
Teller agrees with the adminis
tration's logic in redirecting SDI.
"From the point of view of a nucle
ar conflict," he said, "the change is
from a very terrible catastrophe
with a very small probability to
something less terrible but with a
bigger probability. But again, in a
few months, it could change."

Physicist Edward Teller, the inventor of the hydrogen bomb and a main architect of the "Star Wars"
defense system, argues that despite the reduced Soviet threat, the system is still a sound concept.
One reason a system like
GPALS is necessary, Teller said,
is because of the uncertainty of
who controls the numerous nucle
ar weapons in the Soviet republics
outside Russia.
According to Doble, GPALS is
planned to protect against 200
missiles at the maximum — the
number usually at the disposal of
Soviet submarine and battlefield
commanders.
Questions on SDI
Experts have questioned the
technical and strategic validity of
SDI, a program that has so far
cost $23 billion. And many are
still not sold on the necessity of
the GPALS system.
Sidney Drell, deputy director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, noted the "unrealistic"
role of SDI on the domestic as well
as the international political
stage.
SDI, he said, "would [have
been] a roadblock for arms control
when we were trying to establish
a constructive dialogue with the
Russians at a time of great dan
-99
ger.
During the Cold War, Teller
often compared the Soviet threat
to the Nazi threat of the 19305.
He perceived the deployment of
an ABM defense system around
Moscow in 1965 as a significant
leap in Soviet nuclear prepared
ness.
But Drell doubted the effec
tiveness of the Soviet defensive
system. Any defense system, he

said, is likely to act counter to its
intentions — it merely stimulates
the other side to build a stronger
offense.
"Because of those lousy one
hundred defensive missiles
around Moscow, we increased our
offensive forces by thousands of
warheads," he said. "This is an
extreme example of a futile arms
race."
Teller: GPALS more effective
But Teller still believes in the
value of a defense system. The
SDI of the 1980s, he said, is a
sound concept with outdated
political objectives.
According to Teller, GPALS —
because of the more limited threat
it faces — would be even more
effective than the 1980s version of
SDI.
That concept of SDI had recog
nized that if an all-out nuclear
attack was launched against the
United States, the shield could
not provide a complete defense.
Now, with GPALS, Teller said a
total defense is possible "because
instead of thousands of attacking
missiles, we are talking about
dozens."
He noted that GPALS could
still use SDI technology through
the deployment in orbit of numer
ous Brilliant Pebbles, the laser
guided satellites designed to
smash into incoming missiles.
Drell approves of GPALS
research, as long as the new sys
tem is consistent with the Anti-
Ballistic Missile Treaty. But he
disagrees with the use of Brilliant
Pebbles in GPALS on both a tech
nical and political level.
"Thousands and thousands of
[Brilliant Pebbles] circulating in

the sky is hardly the path to a
peaceful, stable and sensible
world," Drell said, stressing that
the ABM Treaty does not allow
militarization of space.
The 1972 treaty requires the
two superpowers to limit their
nuclear defense to one land site
on each side and a maximum of
100 antiballistic missiles.
President Bush said in a Sept.
27 speech that he wants to negoti

ate with the Soviet Union on
changes in the treaty that would
allow the United States to install
non-nuclear anti-missile batteries
at several sites.
Congress on Nov. 13 approved
a plan to deploy a non-nuclear
ABM system at one site by 1996.
The plan calls for continued
research on the feasibility of
using Brilliant Pebbles in a defen
sive system.

Drell said there are practical
alternatives to using Brilliant
Pebbles. Space-based sensors on
geo-synchronous satellites still
have room for upgrading, he
explained. These early-warning
satellites were already used in the
Gulf War and could be linked to
ground-based interceptors in a
limited strike defense system.
Unlike Teller, Drell does not
perceive any impending threat
necessitating a SDI defense
against enemy ICBMs. A country
such as North Korea, he said, still
has a long way to go before
acquiring both nuclear warheads
and an ICBM system to deliver
them.
In the meantime, "what we
saw in the Gulf War is that short
range missiles pose a threat,"
Drell said. He explained that the
present technology should focus
on protecting soldiers on the bat
tlefield and shielding neighboring
cities from tactical missiles.
The Patriot missile "has been
oversold in terms of its military
effectiveness but it was politically
quite effective and that shows
that people want some kind of
(tactical) defense," he said.
Teller's advocacy of a defense
system is not limited to protecting
countries — the earth itself may
be a target, he said. A massive
meteorite heading for the earth
could be deflected by "a nuclear
explosion of an appropriate size,"
sparing humanity a catastrophe
possibly far worse than a nuclear
conflict, he said.
As minute as this threat may
seem, Teller takes it seriously.
"The last sizeable meteorite came
the year in which I was born," he
said.
