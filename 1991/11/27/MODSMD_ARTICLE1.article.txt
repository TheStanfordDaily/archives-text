## Scaled-down SDI proposed; many still object 
### Alain Dalva Staff writer 
President Reagan publicly
introduced physicist Edward
Teller's most controversial
brainchild, the Strategic Defense
Initiative, in a 1983 speech.
Teller's system, dubbed "Star
Wars" by its detractors, was to
include both a nationwide and a
space-based defense system that
would block a massive nuclear
attack of Soviet intercontinental
ballistic missiles.
Today, despite the dwindling
Soviet threat, Teller still advo
cates a space-based defensive
shield — but he says its objectives
must be different from those orig

inally proposed for SDI. He
acknowledges that the present
changes in the Soviet Union are
"so thorough and unexpected"
that the problems are different
from 10 years ago.
To meet the changing situa
tion, President Bush proposed a
new role for SDI in his January
State of the Union address. The
program's new directive, called
Global Protection Against Limit
ed Strikes, is designed to empha
size defense against a missile
attack from any part of the world,
rather than just the Soviet Union.
"It's a change in concept in
terms of scope and purpose," said
Mike Doble, chief of SDl's news
branch. "It would be protection

against a limited strike, rather
than the thousands (of missiles)
we had been talking about before."
He explained that GPALS, the
friendly Pentagon acronym for
the system, would counter threats
such as accidental launches or
one-time strikes from a Third
World dictatorship.
Teller agrees with the adminis
tration's logic in redirecting SDI.
"From the point of view of a nucle
ar conflict," he said, "the change is
from a very terrible catastrophe
with a very small probability to
something less terrible but with a
bigger probability. But again, in a
few months, it could change."

Physicist Edward Teller, the inventor of the hydrogen bomb and a main architect of the "Star Wars"
defense system, argues that despite the reduced Soviet threat, the system is still a sound concept.
