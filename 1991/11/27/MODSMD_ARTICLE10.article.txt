# Bills in Congress could improve students' prospects for federal aid
## 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
Students on financial aid may have an
easier time getting federal grants, if bills
awaiting debate in Congress are passed.
The bills, which are necessary to reautho
rize — and revise — the federal Higher Edu
cation Act, could increase funds for federal
grant and loan programs, simplify the appli
cation process for aid programs and guaran
tee Pell grants to all eligible students.
The bills have been approved by both
House and Senate committees for floor
debate.
Students lobbying for increases in finan
cial aid expressed mixed reactions to the
bills, which may not affect Stanford stu
dents significantly. Some say the proposed
increase in federal funds could make it eas
ier for students to obtain financial aid,
while others contend the increase would
merely keep pace with inflation.
Stanford undergraduates received near
ly $9 million in federal aid in 1990-91,
roughly the same amount they received a
decade ago. This sum represents less than

-20 percent of total financial aid Stanford
students currently receive.
The bills are "a victory for students in
that (they) included many of the proposals
by the [United States Student Associa
tion]," said senior Vince Ricci, who is the
director of the ASSU Financial Aid Advoca
cy Office. The USSA is a national student
group that lobbies Congress for financial
aid.
"If the pie is bigger . . . then Stanford
has a chance to get more money," said
Ricci, adding that the increase in funds
could make it easier for students to obtain
financial aid.
But Brian Hooker, a senior who testified
before Congress in March on what students
want in financial aid legislation, was less
optimistic. "I don't see a tremendous
increase (in allocations) first of all. Second
ly, whatever increase there may be — (I
don't see) that it's going to affect Stanford
that much," he said.
Selena Dong, legislative director at the
student association lobbying office in
Washington, D.C., said the proposed
increase in allocations to federal aid pro

grams merely compensated for inflation
since 1980.
Both the House and the Senate bills pro
pose the phasing out of several loan pro
grams.
The House bill would eliminate the
Perkins loan program and replace it with
federal direct loan programs, which would
bypass banks. The Bush administration
has threatened to veto any bill that calls for
direct loans, according to Associated Press
reports.
Both bills also propose a single needs
analysis to determine eligibility for aid pro
grams. This would simplify the application
process for students, as need is currently
evaluated separately for different aid pro
grams.
Both bills would raise the maximum
amount for Pell grants and make them an
"entitlement," like Social Security, obligat
ing Congress to fund grants for all eligible
students. The House bill would establish
this by 1993, the Senate bill by 1996.
Under the Higher Education Act, Pell
grants are available to students on the
basis of financial need. The neediest stu

dents are supposed to receive the maxi
mum grant amount. Other low and middle
income students receive smaller awards.
The House bill would set the maximum
Pell grant at $4,500, the Senate bill at
$3,600. The current maximum is $3,100.
"Pell grants are the cornerstone of fed
eral financial aid," said Ricci. "This is our
key concern for undergraduates — that
they make Pell grants an entitlement."
The ASSU Financial Aid Advocacy
Office reported that no students received
more than $2,400 in Pell grants this year
and many eligible students received noth
ing.
Some students expressed concern that
the bills may be modified as a result of
debate in either chamber.
"What we have to worry about now is
where they've pulled the money out from
to give us that increase," Hooker said. "If
that money is coming from a source where
there is a stronger lobby, then it's not going
to pass."
Dong agreed that political lobbying is an
issue, saying, "That is why students have
to work so hard to pass this bill."
