Homelessness among
children has become
a true national crisis

Homelessness among
children is one of the most
unacknowledged but truly
saddening ills in today's society.
At universities such as George
town and Columbia, located in
cities, homelessness i$ wit
nessed every day. But here
fortable Palo Alto, only the occa
sional trip to San Francisco or the
rare sighting at Safeway or the
Caltrain station brings this prob
lem to our attention.
Nevertheless, homelessness,
particularly among children, con
tinues to spiral out of control.
Because of our infrequent con
tact with the homeless, many in
the Stanford community are quite
unaware of what it means to be
homeless and of the kinds of trials
a homeless child must go through.
However, several Stanford stu
dents have helped in the struggle to
raise awareness of homelessness and
actually do something to help those
who have no place to call home.
Two such students, Elizabeth
Barclay and Mike Simon, received
a grant from the Haas Public Ser
vice Center to continue a school for
homeless children through the
summer. They developed a unique
program to provide these children
with a place to learn and grow.
The children weren't the only
ones doing the learning, however.
Barclay and Simon, along with the
other students who volunteered
countless summer hours, learned a
lot about how homeless children
think and act and about their inter
personal relationships and attitudes
about their place in life.
This knowledge is crucial in
understanding how homelessness
is perpetuated from generation to
generation and how this pattern
can be broken.
The grant amount for this sum-

mer project totaled $1,500 — a large
figure at face value, but for a project
typical of its kind, truly paltry. What
these two students were able to
accomplish with this money is wor
thy of the Dean's Award for Service.
Also, a msgor study of homeless
children has been completed recent
ly by Stanford sociologists and stu
dents. The focus of this study was
the cycle of homelessness among
children and adolescents.
During the study, some 35 stu
dents including junior Todd Rubin
conducted extensive interviews
with homeless children. These stu
dents will carry their experiences
with them throughout their lives.
Remarkably, this was the first
study of suburban homelessness.
As the problem gets worse, the
need for understanding increases
so we can find a way to reverse the
frightening trend.
The few currently implemented
bandage-like responses to this
societal disease are not sufficient.
The problem must be attacked
from its roots, and before this can
happen, its root causes must be
thoroughly understood.
What is needed now is to get
others thinking about the problem
and doing something about it.
Many more important and more
comprehensive studies need to be
carried out.
Those who commit their time
and energy to this cause should be
rewarded, and those who claim to
care about this grave issue need to
start to give a little more toward
its eventual solution.
Helping fellow human beings
should be enough motivation for
people to take action, especially
now that homelessness threatens
and effects a greater percentage of
our population than ever before.
Barclay and Simon — two indi
viduals who developed an innova
tive and desperately needed public
service program — and the many
other Stanford students involved
in finding a solution to this devas
tating problem are a true inspira
tion; their initiative should serve
as a model.
