## Football from row 79 
### 
Dear uncle yu : recently, i
had the opportunity to observe a
football game. Now I know you will
automatically recall images of men passing
a round ball and kicking it into a net. But
this is not at all what I am talking about.
This game is played with an olive
shaped ball and by people of gigantic pro
portion both vertically and laterally. The
playing field is at least four times as large
as our village square, where all 500 of us
routinely sit and watch movies on sum
mer nights. Many white lines are striped
on this field, and several big metal bars
are erected at both ends in the general
shape of a fishing spear.
I obtained a very nice seat at row 79,
where I had a great view of the entire sta
dium and beyond. I could see that mam
moth satellite dish sitting majestically on
top of the ridge. I was standing shoulder
to shoulder with Hoover Tower. I must
be very lucky to have gotten a ticket in
such a prime location.
The game was played between a red
team and a blue team. The players were
all wearing shiny helmets, like soldiers at
combat. The backs of their jerseys were
inscribed with large letters. I think these
are probably names of their guardian
angels or something.
The teams lined up on opposing sides.
There were usually four or five people
parallel to the white stripes, two or three
people standing behind them and three

or four people stretched out to the sides.
Sometimes they played throw and catch;
sometimes they just sent one man run
ning through the middle holding the ball
and his dear life tightly in his chest.
Each pass caught and each meter
gained by the runner usually sent the
spectators into an uproar. They all leapt
from their seats, liquid spilling out of the
cups they were holding. Even one well
dressed and distinguished man was
rather unruly. I was told that his name
was Kennedy or something.
There was one throw and catch play
that particularly impressed me. The red
team lined a man up just next to the side
of the field. His jersey was marked with
the letters PINCKNEY. He flew like a
ball of flame into the end region, trailed
by a crawling blue player, moving like a
fat ugly bear. There, he was met by the
olive ball that had flown over Hoover
Tower and into his outstretched hands.
The spectators rose up as the ball was
coming down. These people were obvi
ously not very fashion conscious since all
of them were wearing red clothing. But
their lack of fashion sense did for a
moment decorate the stadium with a
pretty cardinal forest.
On another occasion, the blue team
sent their runner into the red -line. He
was instantly met by a ferocious red man,
whose jersey was marked with the letters
PARKER.

That colossal collision created an instant
vacuum in the immediate vicinity by shoot
ing air straight up and breaking up the
gathering clouds in the sky. The vacuum
just sucked the wind out of the blue player.
This again sent the crowds up from
their seats, and all the people engaged in
the ritual of hand slapping.
There was one particular red player who
looked especially impressive. His jersey was
stamped with the letters VARDELL. He
ran through and over the blue players like
our commune's newly acquired farming
machine cutting down fields of rice.
Comparing him to the blue players
would be like comparing our tough vil
lage stucco man to those diaper children
who always admiringly follow him. That
VARDELL angel must be really looking
out for this guy.
With such domination and punish
ment, frankly I didn't understand why
the blue team showed up at all. Merciful
ly the game ended after four periods. The
big screen flashed the final score.
Good guys: 38, Weenies: 21.
