Student learns hard lessons on 'the Stanford streets 9

After reading the article
on homelessness in The Daily
(Nov. 9), I thought I would share
my brief homeless experience.
This past summer, due to uncertainty
in funding, I began to question the
necessity of spending money on rent.
Having just spent a month in spring
traveling abroad, I was accustomed to
living with few material possessions and
sleeping in unfamiliar places.
I thought if I could store some personal
belongings in my car, shower at the gyms
and sleep in my office or car, I could do
away with housing, and my lifestyle would
not be that different from the lifestyle of a
traveler, which was not all that unpleasant.

So when my lease expired, I decided
not to seek alternative accommodation,
and I became temporarily homeless.
Things went generally as planned,
except for the sleeping arrangements.
My office had too much chalk dust and
my car was too small, making neither a
desirable bedroom. But that did not mat
ter. With a sleeping bag and a mat, it
was easy to find a place on campus to
spend the night.
To avoid suspicion and for the sense
of adventure, I decided to stay at a dif
ferent place every night. My accommo
dations included tennis courts, parking
lots, staircases, the Rodin Sculpture
Garden, the Oval, the Mausoleum, etc.

The sleep was usually poor. Besides
the physical elements such as the
mosquitos, the cold — the temperature
dropped quite a bit at night — and the
late-night and early-morning traffic that
made a sound sleep difficult, it was the
fear of unknown danger and of the
authorities that kept me awake at nights.
I had thought this was only a tran
sient psychological phenomenon and
that the fear would subside with experi
ence and time. It never went away. The
fear stayed with me every night. I just
learned to live with it.
This made me think twice about my
previous conceptions about homeless
people. I was under the impression that

they had somehow grown accustomed to
their lifestyle, that they had become
oblivious to their harsh environment
and had become immune to fear. Now I
know this is not true. They are constant
ly aware of their hardship, and they suf
fer continuously from it.
Those two months of homeless expe
rience did not inspire me on how to solve
the homeless problem, nor did they
reveal to me the true extent of the suf
fering of the homeless people. But now I
feel I know them better, and I under
stand how secure and fortunate I am in
comparison.
