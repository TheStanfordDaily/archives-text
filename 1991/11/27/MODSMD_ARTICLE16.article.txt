# Wagonfeld's column highlights ignorance around 'PC' debate
## 
### 
In his Nov. 26 column, Joel Wagon
feld claims he finds it "ironic that many
people on campus who claim to suffer
from blind stereotypes will themselves
apply blanket labels to others."
I find it ironic that he would make
this statement after applying blanket
descriptions to people and groups in his
previous column. The "feminist profes
sor" of Wagonfeld's Nov. 19 article is
dismissed, by his mockery, into the blan
ket stereotype of a "ridiculous, male
bashing, ultra-feminist."
He does not bother to present the
professor's case or the reasoning behind
her actions. Wagonfeld claims he is sati
rizing political correctness, but he makes
no attempt to understand the profes
sor's point or to explain what he means
by political correctness.
Instead, he dismisses a person who
probably has strong convictions and
valid, well-reasoned arguments.

Wagonfeld also makes the blanket
assumption that no Asians are insulted
by the label "Oriental" based on the fact
that he knows of no Asians who are
insulted by it. I find it ironic that he
wants to be better understood when he
makes such a statement based on virtu
ally no information.
Wagonfeld wishes his readers would
make an effort to understand him, but
he himself makes no effort to under
stand why many Asians are offended by
the term "Oriental."
If he does not want to be "automati
cally thrust into categories," he should
stop shoving others into them. If he
wishes people would keep their minds
open about him, he should keep his own
mind open. If he wants to be better
understood, he should make an effort to
understand.
