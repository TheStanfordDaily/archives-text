# A 						special' Thanks'
## 
### 
I just wanted to take a minute to say
how nice of a time everybody at the Casa
Olga retirement home had at the annual

Thanksgiving dinner hosted by Sigma
Chi on Nov. 20 for our residents.
Because they do this every year, many
of our residents were really looking for
ward to it. The reputation for good food
and pleasant company is unsurpassed.
One of our residents says that there is
still hope for the world when people like
that exist.
So again, our most sincere "Thanks."
We thank them for their kindness and
consideration, which make them a credit
to the community.
