# Let the truth be told: 'Eucalipto' is spelled with an 'i' not a 'y'
## 
### 
Monday's article on the growing num
bers of Ouija Board players brought up
another nasty spirit: the constant mis
spelling of "Eucalipto."
Since most Eucalipto residents know
that the dorm's name is spelled with an

"i"and not with a "y," the fact that
most here at Stanford misspell the name
poses a serious problem.
For those who doubt that Eucalipto is
indeed spelled with an "i," I encourage
them to pick up a copy of any Spanish-
English dictionary. In it they will find
that "eucalipto" is the Spanish word for
"eucalyptus," referring of course to the
tree.
Most would shudder if people began
to spell Roble as Robly or Kimball as
Kymball. Likewise, such misspelling
annoys Eucalipto House residents nearly
all of the time.
What is perhaps most interesting is
that in Lagunita's first 50 years (way
before the days of multiculturalism)
people were sensitive enough to the
differences between Spanish and
English that they spelled Eucalipto
with an "i."
Remnants of this seemingly bilingual
community can still be seen at the
entrance to our house where the name is
spelled correctly. I am confident that
Stanford students can regain this lost
sensibility and spell Eucalipto right.
