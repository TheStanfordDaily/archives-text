He is either the last Cold
Warrior, valiantly rallying his
country behind an anti-missile
shield — or a Don Quixote of
the nuclear age, pursuing an

Whatever definition one

Edward Teller, the inventor of
the hydrogen bomb and the main
architect of the "Star Wars"
defense system, is witnessing his
own expectations implode in an
ever-changing world.
For the Warrior, the ice has
melted. For Don Quixote, the
Soviet windmills have gone

Throughout all of his scien

the Strategic Defense Initiative
— Teller has remained a highly
controversial figure.
A member of the Hoover
Institution since 1975, he has
been one of the most staunch
supporters of SDI — a fact that
has rankled his scientific col
leagues, who say his stubborn
advocacy has ignored the practi
cal limitations of erecting an all
encompassing missile shield.
Now, SDl's goals have been
scaled down to recognize a
reduced Soviet nuclear threat —
