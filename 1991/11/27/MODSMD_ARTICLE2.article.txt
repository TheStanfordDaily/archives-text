# Teller adapts to diminished Soviet threat
## 
### Alain Dalva Staff writer 
He is either the last Cold
Warrior, valiantly rallying his
country behind an anti-missile
shield — or a Don Quixote of
the nuclear age, pursuing an
unrealistic dream.
Whatever definition one
accepts, it is clear that physicist
Edward Teller, the inventor of
the hydrogen bomb and the main
architect of the "Star Wars"
defense system, is witnessing his
own expectations implode in an
ever-changing world.
For the Warrior, the ice has
melted. For Don Quixote, the
Soviet windmills have gone
out of control.
Throughout all of his scien
tific work — which has includ
ed the Manhattan Project that
developed the atomic bomb and
the Strategic Defense Initiative
— Teller has remained a highly
controversial figure.
A member of the Hoover
Institution since 1975, he has
been one of the most staunch
supporters of SDI — a fact that
has rankled his scientific col
leagues, who say his stubborn
advocacy has ignored the practi
cal limitations of erecting an all
encompassing missile shield.
Now, SDl's goals have been
scaled down to recognize a
reduced Soviet nuclear threat —
and to accommodate a Congress
unreceptive to the system as it
was originally planned.
But Teller, by no means
backing off from his support of
SDI, says he still believes in
the value of a defensive sys
tem, and supports the Bush
administration's proposal to
redefine SDl's mission (see
related story).
Born in 1908 in Hungary,
Teller studied quantum mechan
ics in Germany and obtained his
doctorate in 1930. Fleeing after
the Nazis came to power, he soon
joined the Manhattan Project and
helped design the first atomic bomb
at Los Alamos, N.M.
After World War 11, he became
a leading figure in the creation of
the hydrogen bomb. Since it was
first detonated in October 1952,
he has been called "the father of
the hydrogen bomb."
Teller's only regret of his
involvement in atomic research is
that he didn't speak out against the
use of the atomic bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A mere

demonstration of their power
would have sufficed, he now argues.
But according to Teller, Presi
dent Truman was never told he
did not have to drop the bomb,
"because the information chan
nels went through" J. Robert
Oppenheimer, the leader of the
Manhattan Project.
Teller said Oppenheimer sup
ported dropping the bombs imme
diately, without a demonstration.
Teller noted in his 1988 book,
"Better a Shield than a Sword,"
that it was ironic Oppenheimer
and the pro-bomb scientists
became pacifists after the war,
while Teller and those who
opposed its use promoted further
nuclear research.

Teller said that if the war had
ended with a demonstration —
rather than the tragedy of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki — the
unrestrained nuclear race "would
never had developed in as strong a
manner as [it has] in fact devel
oped."
In his book, Teller said he
supervised the creation of the
first hydrogen bomb for fear that
Soviet researchers, led by Andrei
Sakharov, would overtake the
United States during the nuclear
buildup of the 19505.
Throughout his career, Teller
drew attention to the anti-ballis
tic missile research the Soviets
began conducting in 1956. He
believed that the Soviet Union

was developing an elaborate mis
sile defense system — and unless
the U.S. replied by erecting its
own shield, Western countries
would be at the Soviets' mercy in
a nuclear confrontation.
An ominous trend
Today, at 83, Teller still wor
ries about nuclear issues — but he
is also concerned about what he
sees as an ominous trend eroding
U.S. scientific competitiveness.
According to Teller, the public
now sees only the negative aspects
of science, which discourages
competent young people from tak
ing over the research of their
elder counterparts.
Teller puts the blame on the

press, which he said spreads fear of
scientific progress by focusing too
much on its detrimental effects.
"Progress is (supposedly) hurting
the environment and dehumaniz
ing," he said. "Our young people
hear it. Why should they work
hard to get dehumanized?"
Teller's plans for the future are
"to get old," he said with a smile.
He is now working on his mem
oirs. He hopes it will dispel some
misunderstandings about his
views, but he does not know
whether anything new will be in
it. "What I do know is that a lot of
incorrect statements have been
made about me," he said, his hand
sweeping away an imaginary flock
of journalists.

sile defense system — and unless
the U.S. replied by erecting its
own shield, Western countries
would be at the Soviets' mercy in
a nuclear confrontation.
An ominous trend
Today, at 83, Teller still wor
ries about nuclear issues — but he
is also concerned about what he
sees as an ominous trend eroding
U.S. scientific competitiveness.
According to Teller, the public
now sees only the negative aspects
of science, which discourages
competent young people from tak
ing over the research of their
elder counterparts.
Teller puts the blame on the

press, which he said spreads fear of
scientific progress by focusing too
much on its detrimental effects.
"Progress is (supposedly) hurting
the environment and dehumaniz
ing," he said. "Our young people
hear it. Why should they work
hard to get dehumanized?"
Teller's plans for the future are
"to get old," he said with a smile.
He is now working on his mem
oirs. He hopes it will dispel some
misunderstandings about his
views, but he does not know
whether anything new will be in
it. "What I do know is that a lot of
incorrect statements have been
made about me," he said, his hand
sweeping away an imaginary flock
of journalists.
