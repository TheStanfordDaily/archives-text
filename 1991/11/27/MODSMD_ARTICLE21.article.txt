## Eine 						Kleine Nachtmusik Six-foot senior Kristin Klein hopes to end season on high note 
### George Malone Staff writer 
Senior Kristin Klein, Stanford
women's volleyball team captain, is a
leading candidate for Pacific 10 Confer
ence and NCAA Player of the Year this
season. She leads the No. 1 Cardinal in
kills and hitting percentage and has
been Pac-10 Player of the Week twice
this year. She is certainly one of the
greatest women's volleyball players to
wear the Cardinal uniform.
The thing that might just set her
apart from other great players, howev
er, is her awareness of how truly impor
tant everyone else on her team is.
"I see in order for us to win, the team
is so important," Klein said. "As far as I
am concerned, we could have the best
player in the world on our team, but if
the other five people don't help and con
tribute, or if those people don't get
along and play together, they won't win.
I just think the aspect of the team is
very important."
In this context Klein sees her higher
level of play this year as part of an over
all team improvement.
"I think I've been having my best
year so far at Stanford," she said. "Each
person on our team has jumped up a
level. When you take every person get
ting that much better it really helps.
And that includes people coming off the
bench too. We have a lot of depth.
"We have a really good team that
meshes together and plays together.
That's one of our big strengths ....
There may even be another team in the
country that some people would say had
more talent than us, but I don't think
that someone could say that they played
together better than we do. That's dif

ferent from the past."
The fact that the team is much more
experienced this year has made a huge
difference in Klein's eyes. She and her
teammates have moved beyond simply
working together, she said.
"A lot of times, especially in the back
row, [Kathy Jurgens] and I or [Laurie
Sawin] and I — we just know what ball
the other person is going to get. You
don't just know that after playing with
someone for six months. It takes a cou
ple of years or a couple of seasons."
Another reason for Klein's improve
ment of her all-around game was her
experience on the U.S. National B Team
this summer. Klein, along with team
mates Amy Cooper and Oden, played
against top international teams in the
Pan Am Games and the World Universi
ty Games. The experience helped her
tremendously and taught her even more
about team-play.
"I played a different role on our team
this summer," she said. "I played a lot
of back row. I was one of the shorter
people on my team so I passed almost
the whole court and played lots of
defense .... It's really satisfying to pass
the ball and play defense too.
"When I did get set, I was hitting
against a right-side middle blocker that
was six-foot-three and a top interna
tional player, so I had to find a way to
put the ball down. I think that's where I
learned to vary my attack."
Klein said that she felt her hitting per
centage has improved so much because
she isn't simply pounding away at the ball
anymore. Now she is a much more dan
gerous player because she alternates
between booming spikes and perfect dinks
right over the opposing blockers.
Even when discussing how she keeps her

composure when she's making mistakes,
Klein turns the focus towards the team.
"I really don't show [my frustration]
because Denise, Don, and Wendy (the
Stanford coaches) always say that if I
show my emotion or if I show that I'm
getting down then it affects the rest of
the team and spreads to the rest of the
team," Klein said. "It's not very good
from a team standpoint. What are my
teammates going to think of me if they
see me chucking balls into the stands
and swearing and yelling at them?
That's just not part of the team-thing
that I think we're good at."
"We just feel like all the practice
we've done for the past three-and-a-half
years is pretty much relying on the next
month," Klein said. "Either we're going
to win a national championship or die
trying. All you can do is try your hard
est. Towards the end of the season in
order to win we're going to need to be
playing our best."
The No. 1 Cardinal will have to be
playing its best to defeat its opponent
this weekend. Tonight Stanford faces
the No. 3 Hawaii Rainbows in Hawaii
and will play them again on Friday night
to bring the regular season to a close.
If the team can sweep this weekend, it
will be the first undefeated team in school
history heading into the tournament.
"The notion of being undefeated
sounds great but it just makes me a lit
tle nervous because once playoffs start
we can't lose," Klein said.
The NCAA Tournament pairings will
be announced this Sunday. The Cardinal
will host a first-round game Friday, Dec.
6, at Maples Pavilion. Stanford has also
applied to host the West Regional, which
would take place on Thursday, Dec. 12,
and Friday, Dec. 13, also at Maples.
