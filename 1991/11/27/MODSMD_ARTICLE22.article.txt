Men's basketball The Stan
ford men's basketball team
hosts Colorado Saturday at 3
p.m. in a battle of NIT tourna
ment teams.
The Cardinal (2-0) defeated
Rice Saturday to win the Apple
Invitational, while the Buffaloes
(1-0) topped Towson State 93-83
in their season opener.
Colorado returns two
starters from a 19-14 team that
reached the NIT Final Four.
Stealthy swingman James
Hunter and point guard Billy
Law lead the Buffalo charge,
while freshman guard Donnie
Boyce scored a team-high 21
points against Towson.
Last year in Boulder the Buf
faloes buried Stanford 89-79,
despite 20 points and a career
high 15 rebounds from Adam
Keefe. Keefe, the most valu
able player in the Apple Invita
tional with 52 points in two
games, sprained his thumb in
practice Monday, but is expect
ed to play against the Buf
faloes.

Women's basketball Tara
VanDerveer, Stanford's women's
basketball coach, has fond mem
ories of Las Vegas. Last Spring
Break she visited the glitter capi
tal and came away from the slot
machines over $ 1,000 richer. But
that's not where the rosy recol
lections come from.
VanDerveer was not on vaca
tion. She was hard at work, and
so was her team. Las Vegas was
the site of last year's NCAA
Western Regional, where the
Cardinal upset Georgia in the
final to earn a trip to the Final
Four in New Orleans.
This weekend the hoopsters
will once again try their luck in
a Glitz City, in the 7-Up UNLV
Desert Classic. No. 5 Stanford
faces the host team, the No. 25
Lady Rebels, in the first round
Friday at 7:30 p.m. The winner
of that contest will then face the
victor of the matchup between
No. 10 Texas and No. 26 George
Washington at 5:30 p.m. Satur
day. Stanford's games will be
broadcast on KZSU.
