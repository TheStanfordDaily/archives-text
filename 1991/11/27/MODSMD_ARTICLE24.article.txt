# Life in the trenches: Ref tells his war stories
## 
### Sarah Morisseau Editorial staff 
The crowd, for once, fell silent. Each one of the
86,019 fans in the sold-out Stanford Stadium stood
precariously perched in a small spot on the bleach
ers, leaning forward in anticipation, waiting for the
verdict.
A yellow penalty flag emerged from the crowd at
the sideline. "Pass was incomplete .. . dead ball. .
. unsportsmanlike ... defense ... 15 yards ... first
down," Jim Sprenger announced with a blow of his
whistle.
And with that, Stanford proceeded to score
another touchdown, bringing the score to 24-14 in
favor of the Cardinal.
Sprenger, the referee in last Saturday's Big
Game, did not leave the football field when he
graduated from Whitman College. Instead, the for
mer defensive linebacker for the Fighting Mission
aries became an official. Since 1964 he has been
making calls on the field, not plays.
Sprenger, like most officials, took on the job
because he liked the game. "I'm not a particular
fan of watching football, but I wanted to stay with
the game and I didn't want to coach," he explained.
The first step on the way to the Pacific 10 Con
ference was little league football games. After that,
Sprenger worked his way to the junior varsity high
school level, through the junior high level and
finally became a varsity high school official, a posi
tion which he says is "a big deal."
If becoming a varsity high school official is a big
deal, the working the Pac-10 would be a huge deal.
There are only 51 or 52 Pac-10 officials.
The main objective of those 50 odd men is to
make fair calls. "There's no one that wants to be
more right than an official. We want to be right —
that's our job."
According to Sprenger, on the average there are
between 7,000 and 8,000 decisions made per game.
"Only one or two of those are controversial — so
the percentage is pretty good."
Of course, it is those controversial calls that
make refereeing a game exciting. A few years ago,
Sprenger was refereeing a game between No. 2
Southern California, and No. 1 Alabama. The
game was at Alabama and on national television,
which Sprenger says "always makes the game
more fun."

"Alabama was not doing very much, USC was
ahead 7-1. Alabama had the ba11... and the runner
was hit on the half yard line. I decided it was dead
on the six-inch line and another official went up
with the touchdown signal. It was third down on
the half and I'm wondering, 'Boy, I sure hope I'm
right.' I knew they were playing it over and over on
TV.
"On the fourth down USC stopped it on the one
yard line. They took the ball down and kicked a
field goal. USC won by three points, so I was quite
anxious to see the films. I was absolutely right," he
said with a smile.
"Sometimes, after the reaction from the crowd
and the coaches you have doubts. We certainly
aren't perfect. We're human, we make mistakes,"
Sprenger said.
"But it's rare," he added, smiling.
"One of my pet peeves is when people think the
officials are the bad guys. An official never makes a
call unless he's right at the time," Sprenger said.
Sprenger attributes trust and cooperation
among the officials as being the key, since the same
seven officials work with each other for the entire
year. Each Friday night before the game, they
meet to watch films of the game they worked the
previous week. For two or three hours they cri
tique their work and go over the "mechanics" of
the game and of officiating.
"We are also a team," Sprenger explained. "If
we don't officiate as a team, we're going to miss a
call."
For the three hours prior to kickoff on Satur
day, while the teams are on the field stretching out
and warming up, the officials are in a room going
through mental preparation. They talk through
different play situations and consider unusual
plays that could come up.
"In the Stanford-Cal game, there's always
something like that," he said.
All this is done so the officials will be ready for
whatever the players may throw their way. "We
need to be ready . . . and able to act immediately.
We have to know the rules so we don't have to
think, we just make the call," Sprenger said.
But the work isn't done when the final buzzer
sounds. After the game, the team of officials sits
down with a retired official who has been watching
their work from the press box to critique how the
game went.

"On the fourth down USC stopped it on the one
yard line. They took the ball down and kicked a
field goal. USC won by three points, so I was quite
anxious to see the films. I was absolutely right," he
said with a smile.
"Sometimes, after the reaction from the crowd
and the coaches you have doubts. We certainly
aren't perfect. We're human, we make mistakes,"
Sprenger said.
"But it's rare," he added, smiling.
"One of my pet peeves is when people think the
officials are the bad guys. An official never makes a
call unless he's right at the time," Sprenger said.
Sprenger attributes trust and cooperation
among the officials as being the key, since the same
seven officials work with each other for the entire
year. Each Friday night before the game, they
meet to watch films of the game they worked the
previous week. For two or three hours they cri
tique their work and go over the "mechanics" of
the game and of officiating.
"We are also a team," Sprenger explained. "If
we don't officiate as a team, we're going to miss a
call."
For the three hours prior to kickoff on Satur
day, while the teams are on the field stretching out
and warming up, the officials are in a room going
through mental preparation. They talk through
different play situations and consider unusual
plays that could come up.
"In the Stanford-Cal game, there's always
something like that," he said.
All this is done so the officials will be ready for
whatever the players may throw their way. "We
need to be ready . . . and able to act immediately.
We have to know the rules so we don't have to
think, we just make the call," Sprenger said.
But the work isn't done when the final buzzer
sounds. After the game, the team of officials sits
down with a retired official who has been watching
their work from the press box to critique how the
game went.

Referee Jim Sprenger makes the call in Saturday's Big
Game. The heated rivalry has historically provided the
officials with unusual plays and situations.
