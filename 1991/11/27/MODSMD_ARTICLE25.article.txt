# To go pro or not to go pro
## 
### 
When the NFL draft rolls around, two ath
letes who will almost certainly be select
ed in the first round will are Bob Whit
field and Russell White.- These two underclass
men will probably forego their last year of college
eligibility for a pro contract and a lot of bucks.
The decision to go pro early or not to go pro early
is an extremely tough one for college athletes,
because the risks are so great either way.

To decide to go pro early is to risk not graduat
ing from college. The time constraints of life as a
professional athlete are such that even during the
offseason, players do not have muchfree time.
To complete a year of college while compet
ing on the professional level takes intense dedi
cation and effort, and most players just won't
want a degree badly enough. Many of them will
need it, however, when their playing careers
end.
But some players won't need the degree,
because their success on the field will translate
into enough money upon which to retire and,
should they choose to work, a cushy job.
And to stay in school is to risk getting hurt
and never being able to play in the pros. Pro
bound players who are seriously hurt in their
last year of college will potentially lose millions
of dollars, and perhaps more importantly will
never get to realize the dream of playing profes
sional sports, which they may have wanted to
do since they were little kids.
But some of these players are still just little
kids in highly-skilled bodies. They are often just
20 years old, and they are suddenly expected to
be able to handle life on the road with team
mates who are older, saltier and more mature
than they are. And in coming out early, these
kids have lost years in college during which they
could have matured into individuals better
capable of handling the pro lifestyle.
Yet sometimes the money is too important.
Many players' families have sacrificed a lot to
develop their kids athletically and need the
money in order to live. Regardless of whether
or not a player's family applies pressure,
many athletes will feel an obligation to pro
vide for their families and will leave college
regardless of whether or not they are emo
tionally ready.
Players also leave before they are athletically
ready, before they have learned enough skills to
compete on the professional level. Without
those skills, which are much harder to learn
while in the pros, the player will never fulfill his
potential and will never make as much money
as he could have.
Furthermore, no one really knows how good
a college player will be in the pros. The drafts
the pro leagues hold are basically just educated
guessing about who will succeed against pro
competition. First round picks can be huge
busts and eleventh round picks can turn into
All-pros. Consequently, it's hard for players to
know how good they will be and how much
money they will make.
