"What makes us gay or
straight?"
Neuroscientist Simon LeVay
asked Stanford students this
question last Thursday night as a
part of the "Branner Presents"
series.
A researcher at San Diego's
Salk Institute for Biological Stud
ies, LeVay recently reported that
gay peoples' brains are physically
different from straight peoples'.
LeVay said he had decided it
was time to stop just talking about
the origin of homosexuality and
study '"the nuts and bolts — the
biology of the system"
LeVay, who is gay, said he
believes that environmental
upbringing is not a major factor,
but one of many possible expla
nations. Out of curiosity, he
said, he has always been inter
ested in the aspect of his nature
that makes him gay.
"There's a lot of mental trau
ma associated with being gay,"
he said.
In past years, the common
view has been that being hetero
sexual was normal, and being
homosexual was a sick behavior
caused by defective parenting,
according to LeVay.
More recently, homosexuali
ty was seen as "variant behavior
caused by variant parenting,"
he said. Being homosexual was
seen less as a sickness, accord
ing to LeVay.
Now, LeVay is taking popu
lar beliefs to a new level by look
ing at physiological differences
that may determine sexual das
tiny.
In his study, he examined
nerve cell tissue from 41 brains
of men and women who had
died. The gay men in the study,
19 in all, had died of AIDS, as
did six of the 16 presumed het
erosexual men and one of the six
women. LeVay deduced the sex
ual orientations of the subjects
according to their medical
charts.
LeVay's study focussed on
certain nerve cell groups
referred to as interstitial nuclei
of the anterior hypothalamus
(INAH). This area in the brain
is known to regulate male sexu
al behavior. He examined four

specific cell nuclei: INAH 1, 2, 3
and 4. In all but one group,
INAH-3, the nuclei sizes
remained constant.
INAH-3 studies showed the
gay men to be grouped apart
from the straight men. The
INAH-3 clusters were found to
be noticeably smaller in gay men
than in the heterosexual men
and about the same size as in
women.
In his study, LeVay was
unable to include lesbians as he
had hoped to, but he hypothe
sizes that they would have larg
er nuclei, more like heterosexu
al men.
One opposing hypothesis has
been that the cluster size may be
AIDS related, but LeVay said
this can't be so. First, he said,
there is no obvious pathology to
lower the density of the nerve
cells in INAH-3. Second, he had
a comparison group of hetero
sexuals who died of AIDS and
these subjects did not have
smaller clusters.
In addition, the brain of a gay
man who did not die of AIDS,
but rather of lung cancer, came
through with the same smaller
cluster result.
In the future, LeVay would
like to perform further research
on live subjects using more
advanced imaging techniques
that will enable him to study the
nerve cells in a living brain.
Although LeVay said he
thinks this "progress in under
standing our bodies and mind" is
a positive side to his study, he
fears that there are potential neg
ative ramifications to the study.
The military might use scanning
to weed out gay people, or parents
could check their babies' brains,
since LeVay said these hormonal
cells form in the very early stages
of development.
LeVay also expressed con
cern that his research would be
used by some people to label gay
men as victims of a chronic dis
"•ease.- However* «LeVay noted
that if this were the case,
women too could be classified as
"sufferers" of this infliction.
LeVay said that his study
shows that homosexuality is not
a "chosen lifestyle." As such,
homosexuality "should be part of
the diversity of the human race,
and it should be preserved."
