# MRI can clearly show what's inside

I think; therefore I am.
â€” Rene Descartes (1637)
At the time Descartes was philosophizing,

human physiology was studied through dissec
tion. About two centuries later, X-rays were a

invented. And nuclear magnetic resonance,
discovered in 1946, is the newest technology
used to examine the body's innards.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
considers the body at the atomic level. It
is based upon a concept called nuclear
spin resonance. Certain atoms act as
magnets because their nuclei contain a

net charge spinning about an axis.
The sac of seawater that is you con
sists partly of hydrogen atoms, which
exhibit this phenomenon. When you
are placed in a strong magnetic field,

these atoms will align themselves
along this field.

When these atoms are subjected I
to another magnetic field at a par
ticular radio frequency, they will pre-

cess, or wobble, around their axes. As <
they return to their original state, the
change in the atoms' magnetic fields gen
erates a signal. These signals are fed into
a computer and converted into images.

By varying the strength of the magnetic
field over a given surface, it is possible to pro-

duce three dimensional images. MRI images
show high levels of contrast among different

types of tissue and are used to examine the brain
and the spine.
The Magnetic Resonance Research Laboratory at

Stanford has been in operation since 1985. It houses a nine-ton
magnet made of superconducting wire. The strength

of the magnet is 15,000 gauss; by contrast, the
earth's magnetic field is about half a gauss.

The laboratory is investigating new
uses for MRI. One technique in develop
ment is MR spectroscopy, which would
enable the study of the metabolic func-
Vtions of the body.

Researchers at the lab are also
refining a process of fast imaging.
MR scans currently take several
minutes, but many parts of the
body do not stay still for that
length of time. Using fast imaging,
researchers can take a series of
scans and then recreate processes
such as the heart's beating.
Another application of MRI is the
imaging of blood vessels. This tech-

nique may replace X-ray angiography,
a very invasive procedure currently
used.
"MR created a revolution (and

' promises) long and fruitful research,"
according to Dwight Nishimura, assis
tant professor of electrical engineering
and co-director of the lab.

It seems Descartes was something of
a prophet. In his "Discourse" he forwarded
the theory that the living body was subject

entirely to the laws of inanimate matter. In a
sense, that is the general principle of MRI.
Had Descartes been able to see the delicate

112 folds of his brain and the amazing intricacy of his
whole head, he might have been a little more con
vinced of his existence.
