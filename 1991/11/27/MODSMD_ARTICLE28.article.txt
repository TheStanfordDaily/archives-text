When I was a kid, my grandma had
turkeys that didn't quite look like their cute
caricatures. Their heads were bald and
had lumpy things hanging off them. What
are those lumpy things for?

important in attracting female turkeys.
The turkey's bald head is white and blue,
and the appendages are red. I guess
Franklin was right — the turkey is a
patriotic bird.
The red thing that dangles between the
turkey's eyes is a wattle. When a male
turkey is sexually aroused, the wattle

expands to about five
times its usual length.
(Deja vu?) The crin
kled red neck also
expands. Besides being
attractive to females,
this spongy tissue on
the neck fills with a
reservoir of fat that
provides energy dur
ing the mating season.
The gobble-gob
ble turkey noise that

innocent young children love to imitate is
the male turkey's call to action. Gobbling
accompanies wattle swelling, strutting and
tail fanning. The goal of this behavior is to
attract as many females as possible.
There are usually five or six females in a
turkey harem, but "studly" males have as
many as 14. The gobbler will copulate with
every female in his harem every day —
here's where that energy reservoir comes in
handy.
A male turkey is very possessive of his
harem. An encounter between two male
turkeys during mating season often results
in a fight to the death.
