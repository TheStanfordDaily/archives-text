# Difficult balancing acts confront Financial Aids
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Like many high school seniors, Maria
Arrillaga has two things on her mind as she
works on her Stanford application.
"I want to get accepted," says the
straight-A student at Lincoln High School
in San Francisco. "But even if I get in, I'm
not sure my family will be able to afford it."
Stanford financial aid officials are facing
twin concerns of their own during the Uni
versity's budget crisis: how to meet a
reduction target of $2.5 million without
keeping students like Arrillaga away.
"Financial aid is a major concern of stu
dents as they look at institutions, particu
larly in California where we compete with

the University of California system," said
Dean of Admissions James Montoya.
"In the past we've had a very competitive
financial aid program at Stanford," said
Financial Aids Director Robert Huff. "I hope
that we can continue, despite the Universi
ty's financial woes, to do precisely that."
Huff, Montoya and the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial
Aid will decide on a package of budget
reductions by mid-January and submit it
to the University Cabinet.
Huff described the committee's priori
ties in deciding how to reduce financial aid.
Preserving the diversity of entering
classes will be a primary concern. "We
don't want to do anything that
will injure the successes that
we're achieving in creating a mul
ticultural university," he said.
Stanford seeks to remain com
petitive with top universities in
offering financial aid packages to
prospective freshmen. "We cannot
take steps that are going to put us
at a disadvantage in recruiting
undergraduates," he said.
Changes in financial aid will be
phased in over the next four
years, so that current undergrad
uates will not be affected.
Families will pay more
The committee will almost defi
nitely modify the formula used by
the University to compute families'
ability to pay. Huff described three
changes that are on the table.

First, Stanford could begin to
seek a contribution from the non
custodial parent when a student's
parents are divorced or separated.
Faculty members have expressed
concern that the change would hurt
students from single-parent fami
lies. Huff said financial aid officials
will try to be sensitive to cases
where the non-custodial parent
refuses support.
"We're certainly going to have
to look at each case individually,"
he said.
The committee is also consider
ing a revision that would result in
less financial aid for students whose
siblings attend public universities.
Under the proposal, Stanford
would consider the actual educa
tional cost of a student's siblings
in determining how much the stu
dent's family should pay Stan
ford. The current formula merely
divides the expected parental con
tribution by the number of family
members in college.

A third proposal would require
students with substantial assets of
their own to use more of those
assets.
Revisions like these shouldn't
make Stanford less competitive
with other institutions, according
to Huff, because some other top
schools already have less gener
ous policies.
Montoya said the changes would
probably "have a more profound
effect on segments of the middle
class" and would not threaten the
diversity of enrolling classes.
Looking for money elsewhere
Another item on the table is
the self-help expectation — the
amount that students are expect
ed to borrow or earn.
Stanford's self-help expectation
is already higher than that
required by most Ivy League
schools. In 1990-91, Stanford
asked freshmen to contribute
$5,450, as compared to $4,100 at

Harvard and $4,000 at Yale.
"The self-help expectation
could conceivably go up modest
ly," Huff said.
The Financial Aid Office will
also encourage students from Cal
ifornia to apply for Cal Grants,
awards of $5,250 that the state
makes to students with demon
strated financial need. Many eligi
ble students currently do not
apply, Huff said.
"We're going to pressure, even
to the point of insisting, that stu
dents follow through on the pro
cess," he said.
The University may also begin
reducing grants by the entire
amount of a student's outside
scholarships. Currently, the Uni
versity takes half that money from
the student's self-help expectation
and half from the grant.
Also, students who go overseas
may no longer be awarded travel
grants to help with the added
expense.

Reducing staff size
The Financial Aids Office faces a
5-percent reduction in staff, on top
of a 10-percent cut two years ago
that Huff said has already slowed
down many of the office's activities.
Huff and Montoya said they
are troubled by the fact that a
smaller staff will be required to
take on increasingly labor-inten
sive activities.
For example, the consideration
of non-custodial parent income
"would probably create some of
the most difficult problems that
we have to deal with," said Huff.
Staff will also spend time help
ing students navigate the Cal
Grant application process.
"We'll need people to intervene
in Sacramento on behalf of the
individual student," Huff said.
Huff and Montoya said they
hope students will provide input
and suggest improvements in the
system.

Stanford financial aid officials are facing
twin concerns of their own during the Uni
versity's budget crisis: how to meet a
reduction target of $2.5 million without
keeping students like Arrillaga away.
"Financial aid is a major concern of stu
dents as they look at institutions, particu
larly in California where we compete with

the University of California system," said
Dean of Admissions James Montoya.
"In the past we've had a very competitive
financial aid program at Stanford," said
Financial Aids Director Robert Huff. "I hope
that we can continue, despite the Universi
ty's financial woes, to do precisely that."
Huff, Montoya and the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial
Aid will decide on a package of budget
reductions by mid-January and submit it
to the University Cabinet.
Huff described the committee's priori
ties in deciding how to reduce financial aid.
Preserving the diversity of entering
classes will be a primary concern. "We
don't want to do anything that
will injure the successes that
we're achieving in creating a mul
ticultural university," he said.
Stanford seeks to remain com
petitive with top universities in
offering financial aid packages to
prospective freshmen. "We cannot
take steps that are going to put us
at a disadvantage in recruiting
undergraduates," he said.
Changes in financial aid will be
phased in over the next four
years, so that current undergrad
uates will not be affected.
Families will pay more
The committee will almost defi
nitely modify the formula used by
the University to compute families'
ability to pay. Huff described three
changes that are on the table.

First, Stanford could begin to
seek a contribution from the non
custodial parent when a student's
parents are divorced or separated.
Faculty members have expressed
concern that the change would hurt
students from single-parent fami
lies. Huff said financial aid officials
will try to be sensitive to cases
where the non-custodial parent
refuses support.
"We're certainly going to have
to look at each case individually,"
he said.
The committee is also consider
ing a revision that would result in
less financial aid for students whose
siblings attend public universities.
Under the proposal, Stanford
would consider the actual educa
tional cost of a student's siblings
in determining how much the stu
dent's family should pay Stan
ford. The current formula merely
divides the expected parental con
tribution by the number of family
members in college.

A third proposal would require
students with substantial assets of
their own to use more of those
assets.
Revisions like these shouldn't
make Stanford less competitive
with other institutions, according
to Huff, because some other top
schools already have less gener
ous policies.
Montoya said the changes would
probably "have a more profound
effect on segments of the middle
class" and would not threaten the
diversity of enrolling classes.
Looking for money elsewhere
Another item on the table is
the self-help expectation — the
amount that students are expect
ed to borrow or earn.
Stanford's self-help expectation
is already higher than that
required by most Ivy League
schools. In 1990-91, Stanford
asked freshmen to contribute
$5,450, as compared to $4,100 at

Harvard and $4,000 at Yale.
"The self-help expectation
could conceivably go up modest
ly," Huff said.
The Financial Aid Office will
also encourage students from Cal
ifornia to apply for Cal Grants,
awards of $5,250 that the state
makes to students with demon
strated financial need. Many eligi
ble students currently do not
apply, Huff said.
"We're going to pressure, even
to the point of insisting, that stu
dents follow through on the pro
cess," he said.
The University may also begin
reducing grants by the entire
amount of a student's outside
scholarships. Currently, the Uni
versity takes half that money from
the student's self-help expectation
and half from the grant.
Also, students who go overseas
may no longer be awarded travel
grants to help with the added
expense.

Reducing staff size
The Financial Aids Office faces a
5-percent reduction in staff, on top
of a 10-percent cut two years ago
that Huff said has already slowed
down many of the office's activities.
Huff and Montoya said they
are troubled by the fact that a
smaller staff will be required to
take on increasingly labor-inten
sive activities.
For example, the consideration
of non-custodial parent income
"would probably create some of
the most difficult problems that
we have to deal with," said Huff.
Staff will also spend time help
ing students navigate the Cal
Grant application process.
"We'll need people to intervene
in Sacramento on behalf of the
individual student," Huff said.
Huff and Montoya said they
hope students will provide input
and suggest improvements in the
system.
