# Getting a taste of America
## Student group hosts Czechoslovakian visitors 
### Matti Bunzl Staff writer 
Watching Big Game with a group of
Maderans made Karolina Zalisova appreci
ate student life in America.
"Dorm life at Stanford is great," said Zal
isova, a visiting Czechoslovakian student.
"Back home we don't have a campus."
Zalisova, who plans to enter the Prague
School of Economics upon her return,
quickly realized which team to side with in
the football game. "Of course I was rooting
for Stanford," she said.
Over the last two weeks, Zalisova and
three other Czechoslovakian students got
their first taste of the United States on a

visit to Stanford organized by Students for
Eastern European Democracy.
Junior Juhn Maing, a member of SEED,
said a high point of the visit came at a sym
posium in Branner Hall where the Czech
students discussed their experiences dur
ing the 1989 revolution.
All four Czech students are members of
the Student Information Agency, an organi
zation that formed after the overthrow of
the Communist Czechoslovakian govern
ment. The agency was founded to establish
contacts between Czechoslovakian and for
eign students, said Jan Michal, one of the
Czech students.
Hosted in dormitories around
campus, the students said they
immediately felt like a part of the
Stanford community. "I really
love Madera," said Zalisova, who
said she hopes she can return to
Stanford to study.
Freshman Alma Chung, who
hosted Zalisova in her room, said
she was thrilled to have her as a
guest. "Her English is so good.
We just hung out and talked all
the time. She's like a Maderan."
Zalisova said she found that

"Stanford stu
dents are very
interested to
learn about East
ern Europe."
Before arriv
ing at Stanford,
the students
traveled across
the country on a
Greyhound bus.

Once in the Bay Area, they visited
the East Bay and Santa Cruz.
The students also spoke at local
high schools to educate youth
about Eastern Europe, according
to Zalisova.
The students were invited to
visit Stanford in appreciation for
their assistance in organizing a
teacher exchange last summer.
The program was initiated by
SEED members
SEED was formed two years
ago in the aftermath of the revo
lutions in Eastern Europe, Maing
said. Since its inception, the
group has worked on a number of
different projects, he added.
Immediately after the revolu
tion SEED sent uncensored text
books to Czechoslovakia. "We
sent English books on economics,
political science and medicine,"
Maing said.
The group also works on stu
dent exchange programs. Last
year the organization brought 10
Yugoslavian students to Stan
ford. "Right now, we are trying to
establish contacts with students
in the Baltic countries and
Poland," Maing said.
Contact with the Czech Stu
dent Information Agency devel
oped in 1989, when students at
the Stanford campus in Berlin
visited Prague, Maing said.
Last summer, SEED orga
nized a teachers' exchange that
sent 30 Stanford students to
Czechoslovakia, Maing said.
