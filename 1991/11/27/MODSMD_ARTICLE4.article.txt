Watching Big Game with a group of
Maderans made Karolina Zalisova appreci
ate student life in America.
"Dorm life at Stanford is great," said Zal
isova, a visiting Czechoslovakian student.
"Back home we don't have a campus."
Zalisova, who plans to enter the Prague
School of Economics upon her return,
quickly realized which team to side with in
the football game. "Of course I was rooting
for Stanford," she said.
Over the last two weeks, Zalisova and
three other Czechoslovakian students got
their first taste of the United States on a

visit to Stanford organized by Students for
Eastern European Democracy.
Junior Juhn Maing, a member of SEED,
said a high point of the visit came at a sym
posium in Branner Hall where the Czech
students discussed their experiences dur
ing the 1989 revolution.
All four Czech students are members of
the Student Information Agency, an organi
zation that formed after the overthrow of
the Communist Czechoslovakian govern
ment. The agency was founded to establish
contacts between Czechoslovakian and for
eign students, said Jan Michal, one of the
Czech students.
