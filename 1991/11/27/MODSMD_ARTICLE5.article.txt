# New policy draft on sexual assault sent to Kennedy
## 
### Holly Hacker Editorial staff 
Students who deliberately use
alcohol to coerce others sexually
will be in violation of a new sexu
al assault policy, if University
President Donald Kennedy puts
his pen to a draft that was recent
ly delivered to his office.
The staff committee that sub
mitted the most recent draft of
the sexual assault policy on Nov.
18 has also asked Kennedy to
write an overarching statement
on unacceptable sexual conduct
that links the sexual assault poli
cy with the existing harassment
policy.
The committee has asked
Kennedy to review the 11-year
old sexual harassment policy to
see if it needs to be updated.
In addition, the committee
members have requested that
Kennedy commission them to work
on a more comprehensive list of on-

campus resources
and reporting
procedures.
Kennedy has
not yet approved
the sexual assault
policy, according
to Assistant to
the President Bob
Hamrdla. Due to
what he called a

"bureaucratic delay," Hamrdla
said the policy has not reached
Kennedy's desk but is expected to
soon.
The staff committee initially
comprised Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole, Deputy Director of
Employee Relations for Human
Resources Doug Dupen and Legal
Counsel Susan Hoerger. It grew
in early November to include a
representative from the Office of
Multicultural Development and
Linda Shortliffe, an associate pro
fessor of urology who chaired a
Medical School committee on sex
ual harassment this summer.
In January 1991, a new Cali
fornia law required all colleges to
implement sexual assault policies

detailing the
resources avail
able to students,
staff or faculty
who are sexually
assaulted.
Another impe
tus for the com
mittee's work was
the Sexual Assault
Task Force, which

requested last year that the Univer
sity adopt a policy on unacceptable
sexual conduct.
The assault and harassment
policies, resource list and overar
ching statement will be included
in a package on unacceptable sex
ual conduct that will be distribut
ed early next year.
"The real work has to do with
completing the package," said
Sally Mahoney, acting vice presi
dent for student resources, who
co-authored the original policy
with Vice President for Human
Resources Barbara Butterfield.
"We have to do a thorough job of
working on the procedural aspects
and making sure they are up-to
date and clear," Mahoney said.
Mahoney said the package
should be complete by January
for review by the University Cab
inet and Operations Council,
which advise the president on
University-wide policy changes.
Last month, the committee
submitted a draft of the sexual
assault policy to the Operations
Council and the University Cabi
net, but the Cabinet returned the
policy for revision.
Using feedback from the Cabi
net, the committee made two
minor changes to the policy.
The previous draft defined sex
ual assault as including "coercion
through the use of alcohol."
Responding to concerns about the
vague wording, the committee
changed the definition to read
"deliberate coercion through the
use of drugs or alcohol."
The committee also expanded
the resource list to include Santa

Clara Valley Medical Center, the
only hospital in the county with a
trained sexual assault response
team.
In addition, the committee has
requested that Kennedy call for a
detailed list of resources for vic
tims of sexual harassment or
assault that is "much more local
ized" than the list printed in the
sexual assault policy, according to
Dupen.
Dupen said reporting options
and procedures within the Uni
versity differ depending on the
relationship between a victim and
a harasser, and the office or
school in which the incident takes
place.
For example, an undergradu
ate assaulted by a peer would fol
low a different reporting process
than a student harassed by a pro
fessor at the Law School.
Administrators at the Medical
School began to review the sexual
harassment policy this summer
after neurosurgeon Frances Con
ley's resigned because of "perva
sive sexism."
Cole said since Shortliffe and
other Medical School faculty have
a "head start" in studying the
problem, the committee will draw
