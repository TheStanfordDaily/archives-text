# Deans deciding Chandra status
## Questions remain on why he was ejected from Med Center 
### Mas Harntha Staff writer 
Medical school deans yesterday continued dis
cussing the status of Ravi Chandra, the medical stu
dent on academic suspension who was forced off cam
pus last Thursday for allegedly making violent threats.
Charlotte Jacobs, senior associate dean for stu
dent affairs at the Medical School, said she will give
a letter to Chandra today that outlines the guide
lines and restrictions he must follow when visiting
the Medical Center.
She said she could not discuss the letter until she
had spoken to Chandra.
Chandra said he will get the letter somewhere on
main campus. "The deans won't allow me to pick it up
from the Medical School mailboxes," Chandra said.
"Either they're really scared or they really want
to punish me," he added.
Spyros Andreopoulos, director of the Medical
School office of communications, said last week
Chandra was forced off campus because students
had warned administrators that he threatened pos
sible violence if he were not allowed to address last
Friday's Medical School Faculty Senate meeting.
According to Chandra, he is currently allowed on
Medical Center grounds only if he gets consent of
either Jacobs or Patricia Cross, associate dean of
Medical School admissions. "I run the risk of being
arrested if I do otherwise," he said.
Most Medical School administrators refused to
comment on Chandra's situation, saying his records
and status are confidential.
Andreopoulos said that in the 29 years he has
been here, he could not recall another situation in
which a student was ejected from the campus.
Medical School Asst. Prof. Phyllis Gardner
agreed that most people were
unclear about why Chandra was
forced off campus last week. "Peo
ple need to be as open as possible
about this," she said.
University Counsel Margaret
Eaton said the procedure in these
cases "depends on the circum
stances."
"If someone's activities are dis
ruptive to functions on campus,
the person is told that their behav

ior is disruptive," she said. "If the
action continues, then the person
is made to leave the campus."
Eaton added that Chandra's
case is different because he is
unregistered. In his case, "It
depends on what reasons he had
for being on campus," she said.
Jacobs said Chandra "should
have known" that unregistered
students are not allowed to use
certain parts of the campus.
However, Chandra said forcing
him off campus was an overreac
tion. "They didn't even try to assess
whether the supposed threat I was
posing was true," he said. "There

were numerous opportunities for
them to contact me."
Jacobs admitted that adminis
trators did not "fully communi
cate" with Chandra before Thurs
day and "action was taken before
we could talk to him."
But she said, "We had talked to
several students, and several
other people had called us about
Ravi, so we had a significant con
cern. When there's a significant
concern, you don't always have
time.
"In retrospect, one can always
think of a better way to do
things," she continued, "but we

do not regret putting the safety of
the students and the faculty
first."
Chandra said he had been
attending classes this quarter,
although he was unregistered. "I
have to take three exams to be
registered," he said, adding that
he hopes to complete them by
early January.
"I've got to take care of my aca
demics," he said, "but the issues
are more important to me," refer
ring to his concern about the
progress of measures to combat
sexual harassment at the Medical
School.
