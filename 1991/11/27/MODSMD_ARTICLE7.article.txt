# Deans deciding Chandra status
## Questions remain on why he was ejected from Med Center 
### Mas Harntha Staff writer 
Medical school deans yesterday continued dis
cussing the status of Ravi Chandra, the medical stu
dent on academic suspension who was forced off cam
pus last Thursday for allegedly making violent threats.
Charlotte Jacobs, senior associate dean for stu
dent affairs at the Medical School, said she will give
a letter to Chandra today that outlines the guide
lines and restrictions he must follow when visiting
the Medical Center.
She said she could not discuss the letter until she
had spoken to Chandra.
Chandra said he will get the letter somewhere on
main campus. "The deans won't allow me to pick it up
from the Medical School mailboxes," Chandra said.
"Either they're really scared or they really want
to punish me," he added.
Spyros Andreopoulos, director of the Medical
School office of communications, said last week
Chandra was forced off campus because students
had warned administrators that he threatened pos
sible violence if he were not allowed to address last
Friday's Medical School Faculty Senate meeting.
According to Chandra, he is currently allowed on
Medical Center grounds only if he gets consent of
either Jacobs or Patricia Cross, associate dean of
Medical School admissions. "I run the risk of being
arrested if I do otherwise," he said.
Most Medical School administrators refused to
comment on Chandra's situation, saying his records
and status are confidential.
Andreopoulos said that in the 29 years he has
been here, he could not recall another situation in
which a student was ejected from the campus.
