Doctors won't see AIDS patients
CHICAGO (AP) — Almost one-third of gener
al-care doctors see nothing wrong with declining
to treat patients who have the AIDS virus, a new
study indicated.
Physicians who refuse to treat such patients
should be candidates for disciplinary action, includ
ing the possibility of having their licenses revoked,
American Medical Association spokesmen said.
A survey of 1,121 randomly selected general
care physicians nationwide last year indicated 75
percent had treated at least one patient with the
HIV virus, which causes AIDS.
"A majority (68 percent) believed that they
had a responsibility to treat people with HIV
infection, yet half (50 percent) indicated that they
would not, if given a choice," researchers said.
Spy tales printable, court says
LONDON (AP) — After five years and millions
of dollars in legal fees, Britain's battle to prevent
publication of a former intelligence agent's mem
oirs ended Tuesday in a victory for press freedom
over government secrecy.
The European Court of Human Rights said the
government violated the rights of three newspapers

by forbidding them to print extracts of "Spycatcher."
It ordered the government to pay about
$180,000 each to The Guardian, The Observer
and The Sunday Times to cover legal costs.
Less insurance OK'd for AIDS
NEW ORLEANS (AP) - A federal appeals
court has ruled that employers who provide self
insured health plans for their workers have the
right to substantially reduce medical benefits to
those with AIDS-related illnesses.
The Nov. 4 decision by the U.S. sth Circuit
Court of Appeals could hurt patients with other
illnesses, lawyers involved in the issue said in
interviews this week.
"If this ruling stands, it's a question of any ill
ness that an employer decides to exclude from
their health plan, not just AIDS," said Thomas
Stoddard, executive director of Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund in New York City.
It was the first federal appeals court ruling of
its kind and becomes law in Louisiana, Texas and
Mississippi, states in the sth Circuit's jurisdic
tion, unless overturned by the U.S. Supreme
Court. A decision on whether to ask the high
court to review the ruling will be made by Dec. 5,
Stoddard said.
