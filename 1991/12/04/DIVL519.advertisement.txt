THE SISTINE CHAPEL
The recent
restoration of
Michelangelo's
Sistine Chapel
ceiling frescoes has
astonished the
world. Centuries of
varnish and grime
were painstakingly
removed, and the
briliantly colored,
powerfully
modeled figures
were revealed in
all their original
radiancc. Now, in
two magnificent
volumes, we see Michelangelo's
creation in all its splendor, in 600 full
color photograhs taken from the
restorers' scaffolds. Panoramas re
create the overarching grandeur of
each bay of the ceiling. Nearly life
size closeups (many in gatefolds)
By FREDERICK HARTT and
GIANLUIGI COLALUCCI
fl
illuminate the
intricacies of
Michelangelo's
working methods and
technique, and the
sheer painterly beauty
of the images
themselves. The
iconography of the
fresco cycle is
explained by the art
historian Frederick
Hartt, and
Michelangelo's
practices and the
history of the ceiling
arc discussed by the
head of the restoration team,
Ciianluigi Colalucci.
A stunning and sumptuous objet de luxe
— magnificently produced — that will
stand unequaled in its presentation
of this unique monument
of Western art.
