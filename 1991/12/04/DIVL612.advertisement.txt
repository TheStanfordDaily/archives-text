HOW Wise IS DIFFERENT FROM MOST OVERSEAS PROGRAMS:
• Accepted students receive admissions letters (and later transcripts)
directly from an Oxford (or Cambridge) college.
• Students are directly enrolled as full students of the Oxford college.
• Qualified early applicants may share a co-ed Student Residence
associated with St. Catherine's College, Oxford (fully Integrated with
British students).
• Students accepted before November 1 (for the Winter Term) or before
May 1 (for next year) are guaranteed housing with British students.
• Students will NOT be taught In (and receive transcripts from) an
American college operating In Oxford. WISC is one of the few completely
Integrated (academically arid In housing) overseas programs in the UK.
• Previous students in your fit Id will speak to you on the phone.
