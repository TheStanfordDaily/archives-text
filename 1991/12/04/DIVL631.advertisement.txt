INTERESTED IN GETTING AWAY?
EVER THINK ABOUT POLAND?
YOU SHOULD!
There are still spots open for the Spring, 1991 Stanford program in Krakow, Poland. Applications
will be accepted thru January 17, 1992. There is no official language requirement for the program.
What does it mean to study in Krakow?
—Live in a socicty of rapid economic and social change, and take
courses that arc relevant to what is happening around you.
—Meet people who arc actively involved in the current
transitions, and eager to share their knowledge with you.
—Complement classwork with ficldtrips to places such as
Warsaw, the Tatra mountains, and the Baltic Sea.
—Spend springtime in a beautiful medieval European city.
Budget reductions mean that continuation of the program in its current configuration in Krakow
beyond Spring 1992 is uncertain; if you' re interested in studying there with Stanford, you should
consider applying now.
So, come! Pick up an application at the Overseas Studies Center in Sweet Hall. Questions? Call
Carolyn Frazier at 497-4046 or Mike Perozck at 497-6047.
