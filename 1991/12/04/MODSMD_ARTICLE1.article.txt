# An investment in others' lives
## Junior gives trust fund to Chinese youth 
### Mike Laris Editorial staff 
He was thousands of miles
away from the warm sandstone
of Stanford in the bustling
trading metropolis of Ningbo,
China. In the crowd, students,
teachers, government officials
from the Beilun district and
generations of his family all
peered forward, quiet.
In late October, Patrick
Chang was struggling to con
summate the boldest decision
of his life. Every 15 seconds he
would break, take several
deep breaths, and say a few
more words.
Since the accident four and
a half years ago, he hasn't been
able to use his chest or abdom
inal muscles. His reduced lung
capacity makes speeches diffi
cult.
In broken Mandarin, Chang
gave away his $200,000 trust
fund, a safety net from his par
ents, to the youth of China. The
money, he said, would be used
to endow 600 education schol
arships and awards to improve
education for Beilun's youth.
Chang, a junior majoring
in economics, was par
alyzed from the chest
down practicing starting
dives, leaving him with limit
ed use of his limbs. While he
smoothly negotiates the Stan
ford campus with an electric
wheelchair, getting to Beilun
for the gift ceremony was a
different story.
In China, there are no gen
tle ramps to board airplanes.

carried him up and down the
stairs on their backs, bringing the
wheelchair up next.
"Traveling is more or less very
difficult for me," Chang said.
A long car-ride to Beilun gave
Chang a chance to reflect on his
decision to use his trust fund to
endow scholarships in China.
"I was basically speechless," he
remembered. "I just watched as
people biked by and I hoped what I
was doing would have an impact on
their lives a few years from now."
Earlier this year, when Chang
thought of the idea to dedicate
his trust fund to Chinese edu
cation, he knew he would need a
well thought-out plan before
approaching his father. He also
knew he didn't have control of the
money until he turned 18, so he
kept it to himself until his birthday.
"It's really hard to keep such a
secret for so long," he said.
Not as difficult, though, as the
moment he told his father.

"He basically didn't say any
thing during the whole thing,"
Chang said.
"He just listened. He just sat
there speechless."
His father's first response was,
"Are you sure?"
"I was really shocked," said
Tung Ping Chang, Patrick's father.
"After that I calmed down."
"That night we had a very long
talk," his father remembered. "I
had to make very clear to him: If
you give it to them, there is no
way to get it back."
The elder Chang, though, had
himself to blame for his son's
audacity. Since Chang's birth,
and especially after his diving
accident, Tung Ping had been fill
ing his son's mind with Chinese
parables.
Patrick Chang remembered one
story: A general crosses the ocean
with his soldiers to fight a battle.
Upon arrival, he sinks his ship.
"Then his soldiers know if they
don't win, there is no return," he
said. "They'll do their best."
"If you always have an extra
cushion, you can live pretty com
fortably without extra work," he
said. But now, "I can't fail, or other

wise I will end up living homeless."
Said Chang's father, "He really
thinks he can do better without
this money."
The scholarship program tar
gets elementary and high
school students in general,
and has a separate component for
disabled students. The money was
placed in a Chinese bank, with the
interest given as the awards, so
the fund will be perpetual.
Teachers nominate outstand
ing students who show academic,
moral and physical excellence for
awards that range from 50 to 100
yuan, the equivalent of the aver
age monthly salary in Beilun.
The education fund also offers
awards for high school graduates
who go into the low-paying and
unpopular job of teaching. Excel
lent teachers are also recognized.
Outstanding disabled students
in middle school are given a large
award of 500 yuan. A disabled stu
dent who enters college, or who
scores in the top three on district
wide, high school subject exams, is
given twice that amount.
Disabled students in Beilun face
the poverty-plagued Chinese edu

cation system with added obsta
cles, including low academic expec
tations.
One student from Beilun still
grips Chang's mind. The teen-age
boy was one of four disabled students
at a question-and-answer forum.
Chang asked the young man,
who had a "deformed" arm, about
college and future plans. The stu
dent stood in uneasy silence.
"He said he wanted to go to col
lege, but his grades weren't so
exceptional," Chang remembered.
"I told him: 'You have to look
inward, see what your talents are,
and what your comparative advan
tages are, then you can decide
what you want to accomplish in
your future. Your disability should
not hamper you, but assist you in
this inward looking process.' "
"He just sat down and quietly
looked down at his arm for a
while. And that was it."
Even though Chang's grand
parents were born in Beilun,
and members of the Chang
family still live there, local officials
first balked at the idea of accept
ing money from Patrick Chang,
whose father earned his fortune as

a cement tycoon in Taiwan where
he fled the Communists in 1949.
Pan Zhao Yang, the district mag
istrate, said in a telephone interview
that he was worried that Chang
himself might need the money.
Pan also doubted the propriety
of accepting the scholarship fund.
In fact, he told Chang and his
family "no."
"We think maybe it is not
appropriate to get money from an
individual to fund education in
this district," he said.
Hoover research fellow Fu Mei
Chen explained Pan's actions as
the vanity of a Party official who
doesn't want to admit that his dis
trict is poor, and that the money
is badly needed.
"It's losing their face," she said.
But, it turns out, pride can be
swallowed for $200,000.
"Both Patrick Chang and his
father insisted, and because they
were sincere, we decided to take
the money and build up the (edu
cation! foundation," Pan said.
The scholarships are "very
important for training intellectuals
and general education. The whole
community is grateful," he added.
Chang and his father also had to

insist, at the slight protest of Mag
istrate Pan, that there be a compo
nent of the fund especially for dis
abled students. Pan suggested that
no disabled students in his district
are among the top few students, so
there would be few winners.
The compromise was an addi
tional set of symbolic awards of 20
yuan for disabled students who
"continue and make progress" in
their education.
Chang called his paralyzing
accident a physical crisis,
but a mental opportunity.
Many people, he said, never
search deeply into themselves to
find a purpose.
"When the doctor said I may
never walk again, it kind of pound
ed my heart," Chang said. But, "If
I didn't have the injury, I wouldn't
place so much emphasis on educa
tion and I probably wouldn't have
started the scholarship fund and
gone back to my home town and
met all the people there."
Chang said he plans to spend
his life helping China develop eco
nomically.
"Hopefully I can contribute a lit
tle to move China ahead," he said.

no disabled students in his district
are among the top few students, so
there would be few winners.
The compromise was an addi

yuan for disabled students who
"continue and make progress" in
their education.
Chang called his paralyzing
accident a physical crisis,
but a mental opportunity.
Many people, he said, never
search deeply into themselves to
find a purpose.
"When the doctor said I may
never walk again, it kind of pound
ed my heart," Chang said. But, "If
I didn't have the injury, I wouldn't
place so much emphasis on educa
tion and I probably wouldn't have
started the scholarship fund and
gone back to my home town and
met all the people there."
Chang said he plans to spend
his life helping China develop eco
nomically.
"Hopefully I can contribute a lit

He was thousands of miles
away from the warm sandstone
of Stanford in the bustling
trading metropolis of Ningbo,
China. In the crowd, students,
teachers, government officials
from the Beilun district and
generations of his family all
peered forward, quiet.
In late October, Patrick
Chang was struggling to con
summate the boldest decision
of his life. Every 15 seconds he
would break, take several
deep breaths, and say a few
more words.
Since the accident four and
a half years ago, he hasn't been
able to use his chest or abdom
inal muscles. His reduced lung
capacity makes speeches diffi
cult.
In broken Mandarin, Chang
gave away his $200,000 trust
fund, a safety net from his par
ents, to the youth of China. The
money, he said, would be used
to endow 600 education schol
arships and awards to improve
education for Beilun's youth.
Chang, a junior majoring
in economics, was par
alyzed from the chest
down practicing starting
dives, leaving him with limit
ed use of his limbs. While he
smoothly negotiates the Stan
ford campus with an electric
wheelchair, getting to Beilun
for the gift ceremony was a
different story.
In China, there are no gen
tle ramps to board airplanes.
Chang's father and brother

carried him up and down the
stairs on their backs, bringing the
wheelchair up next.
"Traveling is more or less very
difficult for me," Chang said.
A long car-ride to Beilun gave
Chang a chance to reflect on his
decision to use his trust fund to
endow scholarships in China.
"I was basically speechless," he
remembered. "I just watched as
people biked by and I hoped what I
was doing would have an impact on
their lives a few years from now."
Earlier this year, when Chang
thought of the idea to dedicate
his trust fund to Chinese edu
cation, he knew he would need a
well thought-out plan before
approaching his father. He also
knew he didn't have control of the
money until he turned 18, so he
kept it to himself until his birthday.
"It's really hard to keep such a
secret for so long," he said.
Not as difficult, though, as the
moment he told his father.

"He basically didn't say any
thing during the whole thing,"
Chang said.
"He just listened. He just sat
there speechless."
His father's first response was,
"Are you sure?"
"I was really shocked," said
Tung Ping Chang, Patrick's father.
"After that I calmed down."
"That night we had a very long
talk," his father remembered. "I
had to make very clear to him: If
you give it to them, there is no
way to get it back."
The elder Chang, though, had
himself to blame for his son's
audacity. Since Chang's birth,
and especially after his diving
accident, Tung Ping had been fill
ing his son's mind with Chinese
parables.
Patrick Chang remembered one
story: A general crosses the ocean
with his soldiers to fight a battle.
Upon arrival, he sinks his ship.
"Then his soldiers know if they
don't win, there is no return," he
said. "They'll do their best."
"If you always have an extra
cushion, you can live pretty com
fortably without extra work," he
said. But now, "I can't fail, or other

wise I will end up living homeless."
Said Chang's father, "He really
thinks he can do better without
this money."
The scholarship program tar
gets elementary and high
school students in general,
and has a separate component for
disabled students. The money was
placed in a Chinese bank, with the
interest given as the awards, so
the fund will be perpetual.
Teachers nominate outstand
ing students who show academic,
moral and physical excellence for
awards that range from 50 to 100
yuan, the equivalent of the aver
age monthly salary in Beilun.
The education fund also offers
awards for high school graduates
who go into the low-paying and
unpopular job of teaching. Excel
lent teachers are also recognized.
Outstanding disabled students
in middle school are given a large
award of 500 yuan. A disabled stu
dent who enters college, or who
scores in the top three on district
wide, high school subject exams, is
given twice that amount.
Disabled students in Beilun face
the poverty-plagued Chinese edu

cation system with added obsta
cles, including low academic expec
tations.
One student from Beilun still
grips Chang's mind. The teen-age
boy was one of four disabled students
at a question-and-answer forum.
Chang asked the young man,
who had a "deformed" arm, about
college and future plans. The stu
dent stood in uneasy silence.
"He said he wanted to go to col
lege, but his grades weren't so
exceptional," Chang remembered.
"I told him: 'You have to look
inward, see what your talents are,
and what your comparative advan
tages are, then you can decide
what you want to accomplish in
your future. Your disability should
not hamper you, but assist you in
this inward looking process.' "
"He just sat down and quietly
looked down at his arm for a
while. And that was it."
Even though Chang's grand
parents were born in Beilun,
and members of the Chang
family still live there, local officials
first balked at the idea of accept
ing money from Patrick Chang,
whose father earned his fortune as

a cement tycoon in Taiwan where
he fled the Communists in 1949.
Pan Zhao Yang, the district mag
istrate, said in a telephone interview
that he was worried that Chang
himself might need the money.
Pan also doubted the propriety
of accepting the scholarship fund.
In fact, he told Chang and his
family "no."
"We think maybe it is not
appropriate to get money from an
individual to fund education in
this district," he said.
Hoover research fellow Fu Mei
Chen explained Pan's actions as
the vanity of a Party official who
doesn't want to admit that his dis
trict is poor, and that the money
is badly needed.
"It's losing their face," she said.
But, it turns out, pride can be
swallowed for $200,000.
"Both Patrick Chang and his
father insisted, and because they
were sincere, we decided to take
the money and build up the (edu
cation! foundation," Pan said.
The scholarships are "very
important for training intellectuals
and general education. The whole
community is grateful," he added.
Chang and his father also had to

insist, at the slight protest of Mag
istrate Pan, that there be a compo
nent of the fund especially for dis
