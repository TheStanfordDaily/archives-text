# An investment in others' lives
## Junior gives trust fund to Chinese youth 
### Mike Laris Editorial staff 
He was thousands of miles
away from the warm sandstone
of Stanford in the bustling
trading metropolis of Ningbo,
China. In the crowd, students,
teachers, government officials
from the Beilun district and
generations of his family all
peered forward, quiet.
In late October, Patrick
Chang was struggling to con
summate the boldest decision
of his life. Every 15 seconds he
would break, take several
deep breaths, and say a few
more words.
Since the accident four and
a half years ago, he hasn't been
able to use his chest or abdom
inal muscles. His reduced lung
capacity makes speeches diffi
cult.
In broken Mandarin, Chang
gave away his $200,000 trust
fund, a safety net from his par
ents, to the youth of China. The
money, he said, would be used
to endow 600 education schol
arships and awards to improve
education for Beilun's youth.
Chang, a junior majoring
in economics, was par
alyzed from the chest
down practicing starting
dives, leaving him with limit
ed use of his limbs. While he
smoothly negotiates the Stan
ford campus with an electric
wheelchair, getting to Beilun
for the gift ceremony was a
different story.
In China, there are no gen
tle ramps to board airplanes.
