# Starting from scratch: Drug may cure chicken pox

Oatmeal baths may be a thing of the past for chil
dren with chicken pox, thanks to a drug researchers
say may alleviate telltale itching and other symp
toms of the virus.
A recent study, conducted jointly at 10 institu
tions, including Stanford, determined that acyclovir,
a drug primarily used to treat herpes, is a "safe and
effective treatment for chicken pox in normal chil
dren," according to a report released in the Nov. 28
issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
Children from two to 12 years old entered the
study within 24 hours of developing the rash charac
teristic of chicken pox. Half of the 815 otherwise
healthy children were treated with acyclovir and half
received a placebo.
More than 95 percent of the children who received
acyclovir started healing by the third or fourth day of
treatment. Of the children who received a placebo,
20 percent had not begun healing by the sixth day of
observation.

Acyclovir is now under consideration by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration for approval as a
chicken pox treatment, according to Pediatrics Prof.
Ann Arvin, a lead author of the study.
Arvin said the FDA will most likely base its deci
sion on the results of the new study, rather than con
ducting further research. She did not speculate on
how long this approval might take.
Researchers were led to believe acyclovir, which
has been used to treat herpes in adults for about six
to eight years, may be an effective treatment for
chicken pox because of an enzyme found in both the
herpes virus and varicella-zoster virus, which causes
chicken pox, accordingtoArvin.
The enzyme is inhibited by acyclovir in both
viruses, she said.
Researchers confirmed in a laboratory that vari
cella-zoster virus was sensitive to acyclovir before
initiating the study, according to Arvin.
No other drugs that treat chicken pox are cur
rently available, and according to Arvin, this is the
only one researchers "had reason to predict might be
developed into a treatment."

The next question, according to Arvin, is
whether all children with chicken pox should be
treated with acyclovir. Chicken pox does not cause
life-threatening complications in most children,
Arvin said, and physicians must now examine
whether "it is of enough concern to warrant treat
ment in all cases."
Arvin speculated that the Academy of Pediatrics'
infectious disease committee is likely to review their
study and make recommendations for when treat
ment is appropriate.
Physicians would be more likely to recommend
treatment if a patient is at risk for a severe case of
chicken pox. Some of the variables that worsen
symptoms are already known, Arvin said.
"With age, the virus tends to be worse," Arvin
said, adding that a 14-year-old who gets chicken pox,
for example, would tend to develop a more extensive
rash and remain sick longer and than a 7-year-old.
Chicken pox affects 3.5 million Americans annu
ally, mostly children, and about 4,500 children are
hospitalized due to the virus annually, researchers
report.
