# Kennedy quizzed by ASSU senators

### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
Topics ranging from budget cuts to police
brutality were discussed during University
President Donald Kennedy's State of the Uni
versity address at last night's ASSU Senate
meeting.
Rather than deliver a speech on the status of
the University, Kennedy decided instead to pro
vide ample time for questioning.
In response to Graduate Senator Maureen
Porter's question on merging school and
departments, Kennedy said that he doubts this
type of reorganization will be recommended.
He emphasized the difficulty of organization
al restructuring without intense faculty and
administrative consultation. "Department reor
ganization might be accomplished, but only
through a school-by-school basis," Kennedy said.
Concerns about the behavior of police offi
cers after Big Game were also brought to
Kennedy's attention. When questioned about
the purpose of the officers' riot gear, Kennedy
said, "I personally didn't see any problems or
anyone being clubbed."
"No one wanted to spend money fixing up
the football field after Big Game," Kennedy
continued. "So we prevented it reasonably."
Kennedy also addressed the issue of elevator
installation for new residences as a means of pro
viding upper floor access for disabled students.
Senator Russell Calleros said providing ele
vators in dorms would cost close to $200,000,
but that he was willing to use ASSU discre
tionary funds to help aid in this project.
Kennedy, in response, mentioned the compli
cations involved with installing elevators in
Manzanita 11, which is already under con
struction.
"We might be able to push architects on esti
mates for elevators, but at this point in the con
struction of Manzanita, we are too far along to
ask for something else," Kennedy said. "It's
being looked into at this point. We just need
cost estimates."
Environmental concerns were also brought
up at the meeting. Senators asked about energy
consumption, and what role the ASSU could
play in campus energy management.
Kennedy said the University is currently
metering utility use in campus buildings. How
ever, the dorms are not as thoroughly regulat
ed, because it would be too costly to employ
energy managers for all residences.
Upon Kennedy's departure, senators passed
a bill lending $9,500 to the Graduate School of
Business for a conference being held next May.
Revenue received by corporate, student and fac
ulty participants at the Stanford University
Manufacturing Conference would serve as the
basis for repayment of the loan.
