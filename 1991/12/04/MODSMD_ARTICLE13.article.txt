Society must break free
from its prudish attitudes
and accept facts about sex

LIKE AWKWARD teen-agers
groping in the dark, we are a
nation uncomfortable with sex.
But let's face it: The sexual rev
olution has long passed. So has our
flirtation with a return to tradi
tional values. Both have left in
their wake a legacy of unaddressed
social problems.
As demonstrated by the spread
of sexually transmitted diseases
and the emergence of millions of
unwanted babies, sex happens.
And it's not just for procreation —
some people do it for fun.
Last month, Fox became the first
major television network to
announce it would show condom
commercials. But permission was
only granted with the strict and non
sensical stipulation that these com
mercials only mention condoms as a
means of preventing AIDS, not as a
method of birth control.
And last week, New York public
schools became the first in the
nation to distribute free condoms
— a laudable act. But where have
school administrators been for the
last few decades?
Premarital sex has become as
common as bread. Sex is a rite of
passage for many teen-agers
nationwide. And while early sexual
activity should by no means be a
goal — hormones invariably pre
cede maturity — it is a reality, one
that must be confronted, not
denied.
Because of this reality, an open,
honest and comprehensive discus
sion of sex must become the issue of
the '90s.
Plastered on billboards and
alluded to in commercials selling
everything from greeting cards to
soap, sexual imagery has a firm grip
on American society. But these
images provide only half the picture
— the glamour and exhilaration of

sex. The consequences are left for
the unlucky to face alone.
The repercussions of ignorance
and denial are steep. Eighty-five per
cent of women who do not use birth
control get pregnant within their first
year of sexual activity. Lack of com
munication and understanding also
results in sexual coercion and abuse.
And now there is the added threat
of AIDS, a reality brought home for
the first time to heterosexual Ameri
cans by Magic Johnson's announce
ment that he is HIV-positive.
AIDS has provided us with a
tangible reason to initiate discus
sion and education about sex —
particularly safer sex. We can no
longer afford to remain silent.
As a nation, we must move past
the naive notion that by withhold
ing information, we can prevent
young people from having sex.
Sex education should start in ele
mentary school. By teaching chil
dren at younger ages and fostering
open discussions about sexual
issues, we can provide them with the
information to make mature deci
sions and the tools to resist outside
pressures — before it is too late.
The understanding kids acquire
will also go a long way toward fos
tering communication between the
sexes and preventing dysfunctional
relationships later in life.
Many have argued that the solu
tion to this country's social ills
rests in a return to traditional val
ues. While these efforts are doubt
less well-intentioned, they are
hopelessly misdirected.
Morality and celibacy are no
longer linked in the eyes of most
young people. And the desirability
of such a return is suspect anyway,
for freer attitudes toward sex can
only pave the way to healthy sexu
al relationships, something shame
and denial can never do.
Through innovative education —
in the school system and the media
— our nation can begin to break the
embarrassed silence that has long
surrounded sexual issues.
And maybe when our children
ask where babies come from, we
won't be afraid to tell them.
