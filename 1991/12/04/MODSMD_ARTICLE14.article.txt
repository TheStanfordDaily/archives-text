Changes in visa laws create ridiculous bureaucracy

Thank you to the daily for
its editorial concerning the recent
changes in the federal law con
cerning off-campus work permission for
international students.
The changes pertaining to F-l students
are only part of a serious restructuring of
many aspects of federal immigration law.
Some changes, for example in the hiring
of foreign-born faculty, will benefit uni
versities; other aspects, such as the one
concerning F-l students, will increase the
bureaucratic element involved in dealing
with federal agencies and, in reality (if not
in intent), will also reduce the options
open to international students.
We have been aware of these proposed
changes for some time and have worked
with other universities to try and miti-

gate some of the effects the editorial men
tioned. Unfortunately, we have not been
very successful; the proposed legislation
changed only in detail, not in substance.
What has worried many who advise
international students is the removal of
the regulation that allows international
students to apply for off-campus work
permission in the event that changed
circumstances in their home country
affect their economic status in the Unit
ed States. To replace this regulation
with the chance to obtain off-campus
work permission through a labor attes
tation is not a measure that will readily
help a student whose home country
faces sudden and dramatic changes.
There have also been significant
changes in the H-l visa process, again

involving a labor attestation, as well as sig
nificant penalties for institutions that are
found to have completed the attestation
form in error. Stanford, on average, sub
mits more than 100 applications for H-l
visas a year — such visas being used to
hire short-term researchers, faculty, etc.
If this weren't enough, on Monday,
the Unites States Information Agency
announced its long-awaited, proposed
changes to the program that allows uni
versities such as Stanford to issue docu
mentation for international students
and scholars to study and conduct
research in the U.S. on J-l visas.
Currently, there are 656 students at
Stanford on J-l visas, and each year
approximately 700-800 scholars use this
visa to visit the University. The new reg

ulations will mandate significant record
keeping burdens on institutions that
issue documentation for J-l visas.
Many of these changes were legislated
through the 1990 Immigration Act. The
changes, other than those applying to J
visas, came into effect on Oct. 1. On that
date, not one federal agency concerned with
the changes had written regulations avail
able or even new forms that could be used.
That doesn't exactly help when it
comes to advising students. New forms
are now available, but even so the F-l
changes will indeed have serious and
harmful effects on F-l students, and I
appreciate The Daily's bringing this to
the community's attention.
