# University should use some Big Game funds for removal of litter
## 
### 
On Monday, Nov. 25, my weekly walk
around Stanford Stadium sent me into a
state of shock and disgust. Tailgate
partiers had left uncontained mountains
of garbage, apparently at the very spot
where they ate, drank and made merry.
The contents of this garbage included
a very large amount of easily recyclable
materials. The number of plastic cups,
plates and utensils, all of which can be
re-used, was evidence of the purchasers'
lack of education, or concern, about the
inability of the material to decay in our
overloaded garbage dumps.
I asked myself: How could the two
finest universities in northern California
produce such environmentally irrespon
sible students, alumni and guests? How
could the institutions, with a reputation
for high standards, condone and allow
such a disgusting display of ill-manners?

Students and alumni of these Univer
sities supposedly hold a deep respect and
concern for the world they inhabit. The
"trashing" of the environment around
Stanford Stadium raises doubts about
their respect and concern.
When I commented on the situation to
a coach in the stadium he declared, "The
school is so glad to get 85,000 seats filled
they're happy to put up with the mess."
The implication was that the income from
the crowd was worth the environmental
pillage — shades of the Alaska oil spill.
Maybe next time, a Sunday morning
guided tour could be led by University
President Donald Kennedy's successor,
and a few active alumni could experience
the full impact of the Big Game aftermath.
One person can not solve all of our
planet's problems. For each of us to be
responsible for the garbage we produce is
a small step that can lead to big results.
The University needs to take some of the
revenue from the game to provide ade
quate garbage containers and recycling
bins around the stadium grounds.
