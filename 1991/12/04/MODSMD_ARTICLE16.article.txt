# Scientists must know their work's effect on Earth's environments

In the Nov. 27 article on Edward
Teller's changing views, Teller expressed
his dislike of an overly negative press. I
suppose the press doesn't always agree
with his views of progress. I value a
press that allows me to identify and
avoid mistakes of the past.
I, like many of my peers, recognize
that a mountain of nuclear waste, a
weapons-lab clean-up bill of $200 billion,
a national debt in the trillions, a rapidly
depleting ozone layer and a dozen other
major environmental problems have
been passed on to us in the spirit of
progress.
Teller wanted to demonstrate, in Alas
ka, that hydrogen bombs could be used
to blast a harbor into the tundra. Envi
ronmentalists stopped this demonstra
tion before it contaminated the northern
tundra, but the proponents of Peaceful

Nuclear Explosions were convinced of
the acceptability of the small risk.
I have a suggestion that may help
usher in a new view of progress. I sug
gest that all new physical science and
engineering students be required to
attend a class in biodiversity. They
should learn that one should not
attempt to simplify the environment as
one might do with a complex mathemati
cal equation.
