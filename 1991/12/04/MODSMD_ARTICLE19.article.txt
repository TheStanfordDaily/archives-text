## The 						triumph of capitalism 
### 
4 X "T TE CAN NO LONGER LIVE like
\l\l this." With these words, Soviet
V V President Mikhail Gorbachev
began to loosen the rigid nuts and bolts of
the Soviet political and economic system.
Little did he realize that the fluids of
that system — so long contained by high
pressure — would simply gush out and
break open the fragile Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.
The cold war is finally over. The iron
curtain has been lifted. The specter of
communism has been vanquished. After
a parade of victory declarations from
politicians, media personalities and
think-tank gurus, there is now talk of
new opportunities. Vast new markets are
opening up; vast amounts of cheap labor
are becoming available.
Surprisingly, there seems to be little
talk about the lessons of history. No one
seems to be willing to pause for a moment
in the busy pursuit of happiness and
reflect upon what the recent past means.
The initiators of communism thought
bourgeois society stifled personal and eco
nomic development because it pitted
groups or classes of people against each
other. They thought the establishment of a
communist society would unleash the true
potential for economic and human devel
opment; such a society would prove its
superiority in a very short time, and the
rest of the world would soon follow its lead.
However, 80 years of Soviet commu

nism proved that a system that champi
ons communal and societal development
without individual advancement is sim
ply unworkable.
I suppose this is what we are all cele
brating — the correctness of Western ide
ology. However, walking along this parade,
I am somehow ambivalent. I always
thought that there was something beauti
ful about the communist ideal — a society
of brothers and sisters. In such a society,
one works with other people instead of
working for someone. People cooperate
rather than compete with each other.
Resources are no longer monopolized by a
minority of the population — instead, they
are shared by all members of the society.
I understand that these are rather
naive thoughts. They will not stand up to
the economic reality of scarcity. I guess I
am one of those cowardly people who
dare not acknowledge the reality of the
human condition.
I suppose that must be why I have
always been somehow sympathetic to the
Soviet Union. I wished that the Soviets
would be at least moderately successful. I
wanted proof that human beings were
capable of working cooperatively and liv
ing as brothers and sisters.
The grand experiment has now finally
come to an end. I have no choice but to
acknowledge what must be a trivial
understanding for most people — that we
the people are basically selfish creatures.

We are not brothers and sisters. All things
are produced through the drive of self
interest and the threat of competition.
I guess many people have taken this
for granted. To them, it is as natural as
breathing. However, for those of us with
high hopes for humanity, it is a sad real
ization. I sometimes wonder if there are
other people who are as blind as I am.
Opening to any page of a history book,
one will invariably find lessons about
greed for power and wealth. Somehow I
didn't learn from them.
Economists from Adam Smith to John
Maynard Keynes all wrote about the power
of self-interest, but somehow I didn't
remember their teachings. Politicians
from Ronald Reagan to Margaret Thatcher
all warned us about the evils of commu
nism, but somehow I didn't listen to them,
either. The mass media gave us daily com
parisons of the merits of the two systems,
but somehow I didn't notice them.
It required the great triumph of capi
talism for me to realize the basic nature
of my own kind. I guess I must be a slow
learner. I suppose I must be quite naive.
