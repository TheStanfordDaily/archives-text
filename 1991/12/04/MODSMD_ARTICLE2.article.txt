# Ethnic centers worried that budget cuts will halt progress
## 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Directors of the four ethnic community
centers are concerned that upcoming budget
cuts may stretch already limited resources
and make it difficult to accommodate Stan
ford's growing minority population.
The number of minority students at
Stanford has "increased dramatically
since 1986," said Asian American Activi
ties Center Director Rick Yuen. As a
result, since 1989 the center's funding
per student has declined by 17 percent.
Jim Larimore, director of the Native
American Community Center, said, "Our
services ought to recognize the differ

ences (in the current student body)
rather than approach the next 10-20
years of University history with the same
approach we have had the last 20 years."
"I don't want to come off like we (the
community centers) are just looking out
for our own interests," said Keith
Archuleta, director of the Black Commu
nity Services Center. "I'm just looking
out for what is best in the University. I
feel like I'm on the Titanic and someone
has to say that if we run into this iceberg,
it's going to hurt.
"We need to support things that will
benefit the University in the long run,"
he added. "A $25,000 cut for the four cen
ters will be devastating and defeat any

progress we've made, but it wouldn't be a
lot for other areas in the University that
already have billions of dollars."
Archuleta said he was also concerned
that the retention rate of black students
may be threatened by dwindling
resources. Stanford has a 90 percent
retention rate for black freshmen, which
is substantially above average for predom
inantly white universities, he said. In
1989, UC-Berkeley's retention rate for
black freshmen was 48 percent, compared
to 69 percent for the class as a whole.
By working with various academic and
student service departments, such as
Residential Education, the Office of
Financial Aids and the Undergraduate

Advising Center, "the centers have, over
time, created an overall atmosphere
which is more positive for people of
color," he added.
The effects of budget cuts on reten
tion rates will "be seen over time,"
Archuleta said. "It's going to be hard to
measure the resources that are threat
ened now in terms of retention rates."
He predicted that fewer black students
"would want to come to Stanford, which
would lead to a domino effect that will
not just affect the centers."
Directors also said the University has
not taken the expanding population into
account. For example, the community
centers have not received the staff and

funding increases called for in the 1989
University Committee on Minority
Issues recommendations.
"The recommendations for a mini
mum of three staff members in each of
the centers have not been met," Larimore
said. "The irony is that with the budget
cutting we may be needing to reduce staff
to pre-UCMI numbers."
The recommendation for "base-fund
ing for activity program and support" has
also not been fulfilled, Larimore added.
"Some centers have zero dollars or only a
couple thousand dollars available for pro
grams."
Both Larimore and Archuleta
expressed concern over a proposal
that would have center directors
take on some of the responsibili
ties of residence deans.
"The initial proposal, which is
going through a metamorphosis,
was to reduce the six residence
deans to one full-time position,
and have the community center
directors cover the role," Archule

ta said. "It's not clear why that
recommendation was made."
The proposal is either based on
"the assumption that we (direc
tors) sit around twiddling our
thumbs or that we should take on
other responsibilities and not do
things for black students,"
Archuleta said.
The community centers
receive funding through the Dean
of Students Office, which falls
administratively under the Vice
Presidential area of Student
Resources. Student Resources
must cut 12.6 percent from its

operating budget.
Residence deans receive fund
ing through Housing and Food
Service, which operates on an aux
iliary budget separate from the
University's main operating bud
get. Housing and Food Service
faces budget cuts of about 10 per
cent, so that money can be divert
ed to the central operating budget.
Director of Multicultural Devel
opment Sharon Parker said mem
bers of the staff and faculty are cur
rently working to "identify the com
ponents" of University multicultur
alism that need to be preserved.
