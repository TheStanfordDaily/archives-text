# Two Californias? It's possible
## 
### Michelle Duran 
Someday, California may split
in half. And California voters, not
Mother Nature, might be the
cause.
Some Stanford students laugh
at the idea of two Californias, but
others contemplate the proposal
with typical Stanford seriousness.
And well they should, according to
Stan Statham, a Republican
assemblyman from Shasta County.
Statham recently authored a
bill to split the state in two, creat
ing a rural Northern California
and an urban Southern Califor
nia. Statham's split lumps San
Francisco with Los Angeles in
Southern California, because both
are major metropolitan areas.
He will introduce the bill to the
state assembly in January. Voters
would eventually be required to
decide on the issue directly.
Supporters of the proposal
argue that southern California
holds too much political power
because of its high population,
allowing it to dominate the affairs

of the entire state.
One southern California
native, sophomore Cici Wang,
said she sympathizes with those
who support the idea. "I'm sure
northern Californians would
rather pay for their own commu
nities' affairs, like their kids' edu
cation, rather than paying for
social problems that are hundreds
of miles away."
Statham says in his bill that
northerners pay taxes for public
transportation projects in the Bay

Area and air pollution control in
Los Angeles.
But detractors say southern
California's enormous tax base
raises the standard of living of all
Californians.
Stanford students from Cali
fornia expressed mixed opinions
on the proposal. Jeff Sneller, a
Fresno native, said the bill is "not
totally outlandish," and may even
have some benefits.
Senior Marty Smith agreed. "A
Northern California state could
use market mechanisms to pres
sure the Southern California
state to conserve water and pre
sumably reduce agricultural pro
duction," he said.
However, as a southern Cali
fornia native, Smith said he
doubts voters, the majority of
whom live in the south, would
agree to the secession.
Other Californians take the
proposal less seriously. Staff
member Robert Merithew, a San
Jose native, said, "I think the
state has too much inertia to
allow this split."
