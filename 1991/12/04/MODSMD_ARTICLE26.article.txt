# 'Less leather, more R.E.M.' in Friday show
## 
### Val Masters Staff writer 
There are a lot of similarities
between guitarist Steve Morse
and bassist Stu Hamm: Both are
primarily instrumental artists;
both are classically trained musi
cians with jazz underpinnings;
and both end their current tours
with a final show at Stanford's
Memorial Auditorium on Friday.
"University gigs that are open
to the public are the best of all,"
Morse said. "If I had a choice, I'd
do just these gigs."
Morse, who has been on the
road since August in support of
"Southern Steel," a finely-craft
ed, instrumental rock album in
the Joe Satriani/Steve Vai vein,
says he's played universities fre
quently throughout his 20-year
career.
"Students are at a time in
their lives where they're just
more open. I know it's a general
ization, but it's true," he says,
laughing.
It was at the University of
Miami in the early '70s where
Morse, a jazz major with a focus
in classical guitar, started playing
on campus with his progressive,
instrumental group, the Dixie
Dregs.
After college, the Dixie Dregs
(later the Dregs) toured exten
sively and released a half-dozen
critically acclaimed albums before
breaking up in 1982, at which
time Morse joined Kansas.
Two albums later, Morse decid
ed to concentrate on a solo career,
and recorded several instrumen
tal albums including 1989's
Grammy-nominated "High Ten
sion Wires."
Not only is it something of an
honor being invited to play a uni
versity, it also allows Morse the
chance to show off his first love,
what he calls "the real stuff:"
classical guitar.
"I'll probably do a piece by
Bach, if they're into it, then four
or five pieces of my own, stuff I've

never recorded, then to keep peo
ple from fidgeting I'll get into
some electric stuff," Morse said.
"I love that imposed pin-drop
ping silence, that formal air. In
small doses, I think everyone likes
classical music. You get so much
more emotion across. I can touch
more people in a deeper way," he
said.
"Most people, given choices,
will take something different.
People like variety, whether they
know or admit it."
Bassist Stu Hamm is inclined
to agree with Morse's opinion
that people like variety.
"The great thing is that the
general public has a wider range
of taste than the record execu
tives give tbem credit for," Hamm
said.
Like Morse, Hamm brings a
formal classical/jazz training to
his brand of instrumental rock,
and admits to alternating his
rocking nights with classical days,
when he listens to Bach and
Debussy —"music with such emo
tional impact."
Yet, if Hamm's slapping, pop
ping style of bass playing, and his
driving songs tap that same Satri
ani/Vai vein, rather than Stanley
Clarke or Jaco Pastorius, there's
good reason for it.
In the late '70s, while at the
Berklee College of Music, Hamm
was persuaded by classmate Steve
Vai to move to California to work
on Vai's album "Flex-ible." There
Vai introduced Hamm to guitarist
Joe Satriani.
Hamm's exuberant style soon
proved an active counterpart to
Satriani's guitar acrobatics and
highlighted Satriani's "Surfing
with the Alien" and "Flying in a
Blue Dream" albums. Satriani
returned the favor by contribut
ing to Hamm's "Radio Free Albe
muth" (1988) and "Kings of
Sleep" (1989).
It was during Satriani's live
shows, however, that Hamm
began making himself known.
Given a 15-minute bass solo every

night, Hamm soon began
astounding audiences with "Qua
hogs Anyone?" an epic bass solo
featuring Vince Guaraldi's "Linus
and Lucy," which can be found on
Hamm's latest album "The
Urge."
"I started out being known as
the guy who played on Steve Vai's
"Attitude," then the guy who
played with Joe, then the guy that
plays "Linus and Lucy," Hamm
said.
Though Hamm says his "jazzy

influence" keeps him from sound
ing like Hon Jovi, he promises his
Stanford show will be hard-rock
ing, but with "less leather — more
R.E.M. stickers" than a non-col
lege show.
"I'm getting the band together
for a last fling. We're a very ener
getic outfit out to have a good
time, and some of the S.F. charac
ters may show up, maybe Steve
[Vail, Joe ISatriani), or Alex
[Skolnick of Testament]," Hamm
said.

Bach, if they're into it, then four
or five pieces of my own, stuff I've

never recorded, then to keep peo
ple from fidgeting I'll get into
some electric stuff," Morse said.
"I love that imposed pin-drop
ping silence, that formal air. In
small doses, I think everyone likes
classical music. You get so much
more emotion across. I can touch
more people in a deeper way," he
said.
"Most people, given choices,
will take something different.
People like variety, whether they
know or admit it."
Bassist Stu Hamm is inclined
to agree with Morse's opinion
that people like variety.
"The great thing is that the
general public has a wider range
of taste than the record execu
tives give tbem credit for," Hamm
said.
Like Morse, Hamm brings a
formal classical/jazz training to
his brand of instrumental rock,
and admits to alternating his
rocking nights with classical days,
when he listens to Bach and
Debussy —"music with such emo
tional impact."
Yet, if Hamm's slapping, pop
ping style of bass playing, and his
driving songs tap that same Satri
ani/Vai vein, rather than Stanley
Clarke or Jaco Pastorius, there's
good reason for it.
In the late '70s, while at the
Berklee College of Music, Hamm
was persuaded by classmate Steve
Vai to move to California to work
on Vai's album "Flex-ible." There
Vai introduced Hamm to guitarist
Joe Satriani.
Hamm's exuberant style soon
proved an active counterpart to
Satriani's guitar acrobatics and
highlighted Satriani's "Surfing
with the Alien" and "Flying in a
Blue Dream" albums. Satriani
returned the favor by contribut
ing to Hamm's "Radio Free Albe
muth" (1988) and "Kings of
Sleep" (1989).
It was during Satriani's live
shows, however, that Hamm
began making himself known.
Given a 15-minute bass solo every

night, Hamm soon began
astounding audiences with "Qua
hogs Anyone?" an epic bass solo
featuring Vince Guaraldi's "Linus
and Lucy," which can be found on
Hamm's latest album "The
Urge."
"I started out being known as
the guy who played on Steve Vai's
"Attitude," then the guy who
played with Joe, then the guy that
plays "Linus and Lucy," Hamm
said.
Though Hamm says his "jazzy

influence" keeps him from sound
ing like Hon Jovi, he promises his
Stanford show will be hard-rock
ing, but with "less leather — more
R.E.M. stickers" than a non-col
lege show.
"I'm getting the band together
for a last fling. We're a very ener
getic outfit out to have a good
time, and some of the S.F. charac
ters may show up, maybe Steve
[Vail, Joe ISatriani), or Alex
[Skolnick of Testament]," Hamm
said.
