## Spikers shoot for NCAAs after losing to Hawaii 
### George Malone Staff writer 
Hawaii may have spoiled Stanford's
perfect season in women's volleyball last
Wednesday night, but the Cardinal got
the last laugh two days later and served
notice that it is still the team to beat
going into the postseason. Friday night
No. 1 Stanford defeated No. 3 Hawaii in
a thrilling five-game match that Cardi
nal coach Don Shaw called "one of the
best wins we've had since I've been at
Stanford."
After a disheartening loss on Wednes
day 15-8, 15-12, 15-11 to the Rainbow
Wahines, Stanford came back on Friday
and showed why it is the top-ranked
team in the country, winning a three
hour marathon match, 15-13, 14-16, 10-
15, 15-8, 16-14. Stanford finished the
season at 28-1, while Hawaii fell to 24-4.
Hawaii's Klum Gym was rocking on
Friday night with far more people than
the listed 1,800 in attendance. After a
seesaw match over the first four games,
the Wahines jumped ahead in the fifth
game and served for match point at 14-9
to seal their second upset. The Hawaii
crowd was screaming in anticipation of
another Wahine victory, but junior Bev
Oden made a great dig to save the point
and junior Kristi Paaso hit an off-speed
shot for a kill and sideout for Stanford.
Paaso then served an ace to make it 14-
10 before Hawaii got a sideout and
served for its second match point.
But the Cardinal was not about to let
this one get away. Senior Kristin Klein
(the 1991 Pacific 10 Player of the Year)
got another sideout for Stanford with a
monstrous spike, and then recorded two
more kills and a block with Oden to
make it 14-13. Oden slammed a quick
set from junior Carrie Feldman off the
blockers to tie the match, and then
Oden stuffed Hawaii's middle hitter to
give the Cardinal match point.
Hawaii answered with a kill for the
sideout, but senior Nicole Appleman put
the ball down to give Stanford the serve
for the match, and Oden and senior Amy
Cooper promptly roofed Hawaii's fresh
man hitter Brandi Brooks to win the
match.
Unlike the Pac-10 Conference, the
Big West (Hawaii's conference) does not
use rally-scoring in the fifth game, so
the final game was played by regular
scoring rules.

"It was an absolutely great victory for
us under those circumstances," Shaw
said. "It was like a sauna in there — we
were in there for three hours. The
Hawaii crowd was such a zoo."
The exhausting victory was especially
sweet coming on the heels of a crushing
loss on Wednesday.
"IHawaii| clobbered us in the first
match," Shaw said. "It is really tough to
play in Hawaii, and we weren't ready for
that. We weren't ready for the intensity
of the crowd. We just weren't getting
the job done. . . . Players were upset
that we didn't come to play."
The loss broke their 27-match win
ning streak, including 16 consecutive
road wins. Stanford reacted well to its
first setback of the season, however,
regrouping mentally and figuring out
ways to beat the Wahines, Shaw said.
"We played really well on Friday
night, and Hawaii did too," he said.
"When we came out and played tough,
Hawaii did not back down, and it was
just a great match. It was great for our
confidence. The bottom line is you walk
away with an incredible win."
Stanford hit just .200 against Hawaii
on Wednesday night, led by Klein's 14
kills and eight digs. Cooper added 11
kills and four blocks. Friday the Cardi
nal was led by Oden's third triple-double
of the season. She had 24 kills, 20 digs
and 13 blocks on the night. Klein had 25
kills, 19 digs, and four blocks, while
Cooper had 15 kills and 10 blocks, and
Appleman had 10 kills, 11 digs and
seven blocks.
"Everyone played really well. (Sopho
more setter) Piper Hahn and Paaso
came off the bench and were tremen
dous," Shaw said.
Hawaii was led by sophomore Kee
Williams' 31 kills and 10 blocks and
senior Malin Fransson's 22 kills and 18
digs.
Shaw feels that the tough road
matches will be good experience for the
team in the postseason.
"The NCAA Tournament can't be
any tougher than playing in Hawaii,"

Shaw said. "It was good for us to see
how we matched up against a good team
on the road. Hawaii will definitely be a
factor in this year's tournament. They
are playing really well."
Speaking of the tournament, the
NCAA Tournament pairings were
' announced on Sunday. Stanford is the
top seed in the tournament and the top
seed in the West Regional. The Cardinal
will host the Rhode Island Rams (19-11)
this Friday night at 7:30 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion. Tickets are $6 for adults and
$4 for students. The Rams won the
Atlantic-10 Tournament and gained an
automatic berth in the NCAA Tourna
ment.
Stanford and Rhode Island have
never faced each other and only have
one common opponent for this season,
USC. The Cardinal defeated the Trojans
twice, 3-1 in Los Angeles and 3-0 at
Maples Pavilion, while the Rams lost to
USC in four games in a tournament at
the beginning of September. Rhode
Island is 0-4 against teams competing in
this year's NCAA Tournament, while
Stanford is 12-1.
Rhode Island is led by senior hitter
Kengy Gardiner, who is third in the
nation in kills and also has 385 digs for
the season. Gardiner is the Rams'
offense: she receives almost one-third of
her team's sets and will certainly figure
prominently in Friday night's match.
Shaw said that he doesn't know any
thing about Rhode Island, but they
don't know much about the Cardinal
either.
"I personally prefer to play a team
we've never seen before because after
you've played a team once, they have
that much more information about
you," he said.
Should Stanford defeat Rhode Island,
it will host the West Regional on Thurs
day, Dec. 12, and Friday, Dec. 13. The
games will also be played at Maples
Pavilion. Tickets will go on sale and
times will be announced for those
matches at this Friday's match.
This weekend Klein was announced
as the Pac-10 Player of the Year for this
season, and coach Don Shaw was award
ed the Coach of the Year. Klein, Cooper
and Oden were named to the all-confer
ence team as well. Klein is the first four
time all-conference selection in confer
ence history, and this is both Cooper's
and Oden's third time to make the team.

the final game was played by regular
scoring rules.

matches with Wahines

"It was an absolutely great victory for
us under those circumstances," Shaw
said. "It was like a sauna in there — we
were in there for three hours. The
Hawaii crowd was such a zoo."
The exhausting victory was especially
sweet coming on the heels of a crushing
loss on Wednesday.
"IHawaii| clobbered us in the first
match," Shaw said. "It is really tough to
play in Hawaii, and we weren't ready for
that. We weren't ready for the intensity
of the crowd. We just weren't getting
the job done. . . . Players were upset
that we didn't come to play."
The loss broke their 27-match win
ning streak, including 16 consecutive
road wins. Stanford reacted well to its
first setback of the season, however,
regrouping mentally and figuring out
ways to beat the Wahines, Shaw said.
"We played really well on Friday
night, and Hawaii did too," he said.
"When we came out and played tough,
Hawaii did not back down, and it was
just a great match. It was great for our
confidence. The bottom line is you walk
away with an incredible win."
Stanford hit just .200 against Hawaii
on Wednesday night, led by Klein's 14
kills and eight digs. Cooper added 11
kills and four blocks. Friday the Cardi
nal was led by Oden's third triple-double
of the season. She had 24 kills, 20 digs
and 13 blocks on the night. Klein had 25
kills, 19 digs, and four blocks, while
Cooper had 15 kills and 10 blocks, and
Appleman had 10 kills, 11 digs and
seven blocks.
"Everyone played really well. (Sopho
more setter) Piper Hahn and Paaso
came off the bench and were tremen
dous," Shaw said.
Hawaii was led by sophomore Kee
Williams' 31 kills and 10 blocks and
senior Malin Fransson's 22 kills and 18
digs.
Shaw feels that the tough road
matches will be good experience for the
team in the postseason.
"The NCAA Tournament can't be
any tougher than playing in Hawaii,"

Shaw said. "It was good for us to see
how we matched up against a good team
on the road. Hawaii will definitely be a
factor in this year's tournament. They
are playing really well."
Speaking of the tournament, the
NCAA Tournament pairings were
' announced on Sunday. Stanford is the
top seed in the tournament and the top
seed in the West Regional. The Cardinal
will host the Rhode Island Rams (19-11)
this Friday night at 7:30 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion. Tickets are $6 for adults and
$4 for students. The Rams won the
Atlantic-10 Tournament and gained an
automatic berth in the NCAA Tourna
ment.
Stanford and Rhode Island have
never faced each other and only have
one common opponent for this season,
USC. The Cardinal defeated the Trojans
twice, 3-1 in Los Angeles and 3-0 at
Maples Pavilion, while the Rams lost to
USC in four games in a tournament at
the beginning of September. Rhode
Island is 0-4 against teams competing in
this year's NCAA Tournament, while
Stanford is 12-1.
Rhode Island is led by senior hitter
Kengy Gardiner, who is third in the
nation in kills and also has 385 digs for
the season. Gardiner is the Rams'
offense: she receives almost one-third of
her team's sets and will certainly figure
prominently in Friday night's match.
Shaw said that he doesn't know any
thing about Rhode Island, but they
don't know much about the Cardinal
either.
"I personally prefer to play a team
we've never seen before because after
you've played a team once, they have
that much more information about
you," he said.
Should Stanford defeat Rhode Island,
it will host the West Regional on Thurs
day, Dec. 12, and Friday, Dec. 13. The
games will also be played at Maples
Pavilion. Tickets will go on sale and
times will be announced for those
matches at this Friday's match.
This weekend Klein was announced
as the Pac-10 Player of the Year for this
season, and coach Don Shaw was award
ed the Coach of the Year. Klein, Cooper
and Oden were named to the all-confer
ence team as well. Klein is the first four
time all-conference selection in confer
ence history, and this is both Cooper's
and Oden's third time to make the team.

Hawaii may have spoiled Stanford's
perfect season in women's volleyball last
Wednesday night, but the Cardinal got
the last laugh two days later and served
notice that it is still the team to beat
going into the postseason. Friday night
No. 1 Stanford defeated No. 3 Hawaii in
a thrilling five-game match that Cardi
nal coach Don Shaw called "one of the
best wins we've had since I've been at
Stanford."
After a disheartening loss on Wednes
day 15-8, 15-12, 15-11 to the Rainbow
Wahines, Stanford came back on Friday
and showed why it is the top-ranked
team in the country, winning a three
hour marathon match, 15-13, 14-16, 10-
15, 15-8, 16-14. Stanford finished the
season at 28-1, while Hawaii fell to 24-4.
Hawaii's Klum Gym was rocking on
Friday night with far more people than
the listed 1,800 in attendance. After a
seesaw match over the first four games,
the Wahines jumped ahead in the fifth
game and served for match point at 14-9
to seal their second upset. The Hawaii
crowd was screaming in anticipation of
another Wahine victory, but junior Bev
Oden made a great dig to save the point
and junior Kristi Paaso hit an off-speed
shot for a kill and sideout for Stanford.
Paaso then served an ace to make it 14-
10 before Hawaii got a sideout and
served for its second match point.
But the Cardinal was not about to let
this one get away. Senior Kristin Klein
(the 1991 Pacific 10 Player of the Year)
got another sideout for Stanford with a
monstrous spike, and then recorded two
more kills and a block with Oden to
make it 14-13. Oden slammed a quick
set from junior Carrie Feldman off the
blockers to tie the match, and then
Oden stuffed Hawaii's middle hitter to
give the Cardinal match point.
Hawaii answered with a kill for the
sideout, but senior Nicole Appleman put
the ball down to give Stanford the serve
for the match, and Oden and senior Amy
Cooper promptly roofed Hawaii's fresh
man hitter Brandi Brooks to win the
match.
Unlike the Pac-10 Conference, the
Big West (Hawaii's conference) does not
use rally-scoring in the fifth game, so
the final game was played by regular
scoring rules.
