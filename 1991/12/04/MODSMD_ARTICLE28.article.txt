# Georgia on their minds — gridders prepare to bowl

### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Georgia Tech has both the
national championship pnd
respect, and if Stanford can't have
one, it will take the other. The Car
dinal will head to the Aloha Bowl
and face the Yellow Jackets (7-5) in
hopes of its second victory over a
current national champion, con
tinuing the season-long search for
the respect the team feels it is due.
"In the overall scheme of
thi. gs, the main thing a win over
Georgia Tech would equal is
respect," halfback J.J. Lasley
said. "Nobody has given us any
respect all year, from Oregon to
Washington State. If we beat
Georgia Tech, people will have to
respect us."
The Yellow Jackets were co
national champions with Colorado
last year. The Buffaloes were the
top choice of the Associated Press,
while Georgia Tech was the No. 1
with United Press International.
After starting 0-2, Stanford
recorded its first win of the season
with a 28-21 victory over Col
orado. Stanford now stands at 8-3,
ranked No. 17 by AP, and has a
chance for its last victory of 1991
to be like its first — a win over a
national champion.
"We have a chance to beat both
national champions in the same
year, and that's important to us,"
Stanford head coach Denny
Green said. "I don't think there
are many teams who have accom
plished what we can."
The Aloha bowl will mark the
Cardinal's 15th bowl appearance,
