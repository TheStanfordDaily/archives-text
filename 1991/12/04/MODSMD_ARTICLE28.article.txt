# Georgia on their minds — gridders prepare to bowl

### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Georgia Tech has both the
national championship pnd
respect, and if Stanford can't have
one, it will take the other. The Car
dinal will head to the Aloha Bowl
and face the Yellow Jackets (7-5) in
hopes of its second victory over a
current national champion, con
tinuing the season-long search for
the respect the team feels it is due.
"In the overall scheme of
thi. gs, the main thing a win over
Georgia Tech would equal is
respect," halfback J.J. Lasley
said. "Nobody has given us any
respect all year, from Oregon to
Washington State. If we beat
Georgia Tech, people will have to
respect us."
The Yellow Jackets were co
national champions with Colorado
last year. The Buffaloes were the
top choice of the Associated Press,
while Georgia Tech was the No. 1
with United Press International.
After starting 0-2, Stanford
recorded its first win of the season
with a 28-21 victory over Col
orado. Stanford now stands at 8-3,
ranked No. 17 by AP, and has a
chance for its last victory of 1991
to be like its first — a win over a
national champion.
"We have a chance to beat both
national champions in the same
year, and that's important to us,"
Stanford head coach Denny
Green said. "I don't think there
are many teams who have accom
plished what we can."
The Aloha bowl will mark the
Cardinal's 15th bowl appearance,
and first since the 1986 season
when it went to the Gator Bowl.
Named the "Now Boys" by Green
in an effort to reaffirm the fact
that big-time football has
returned to the Farm, Stanford
has put together an impressive
seven-game win streak after start
ing the season 1-3. Included in the
streak are convincing victories
over UCLA and California, but the
Cardinal still finds itself trying to
shed the reputation that it can
only win one or two big games a
year.
"We have always been known

to have a couple big games—beat
Notre Dame, beat Cal, then have
the season end," punter Paul
Stonehouse said. "The players
want more. We got respect for
those wins, but that type of
respect is not that great. We are
a more powerful team now, and
we want the respect that comes
with that."
That respect will come from
the play of Stanford's talented
personnel. Three Cardinal were
named this week to the first
team All-Pacific 10 Conference,
fullback Tommy Vardell and
offensive lineman Bob Whitfield
on the offensive team, and
linebacker Ron George on the
defense. Halfback Glyn Milburn
and wide receiver Chris Walsh

were named to second team All
Pac-10.
Vardell, certain to be some
body's All-American this year,
used a 182-yard, 39-carry perfor
mance in Big Game to become
only the fourth player in Stan
ford history to rush for over
1,000 yards. Vardell finished the
1991 regular season with 1084
rushing yards, breaking Darrin
Nelson's single season record of
1069 yards set in 1977.
Known as "Touchdown
Tommy" due to his propensity
for scoring, Vardell is the
nation's second leading scorer
with a 10.91 points-a-game aver
age. The 20 touchdowns he has
scored this year are a Stanford
single-season record.
