# Retterer races to two American records
## 
### Tish Williams Staff writer 
Brian Retterer entered the Pacific 10
Conference swimming championships with
the goal of proving he wasn't a victim of the
sophomore slump. He came out of the three
day competition with American records in
the 100- and 200-yard backstroke.
There is not much doubt in the
nation's eyes that Retterer is swimming

better than ever in his second year at
Stanford.
"Brian Retterer had one of the most
incredible performances I've ever seen,
breaking records four times, as well as lead
ing off our relay and swimming the 50 free,"
said Cardinal head coach Skip Kenney.
"My goals were all under the American
records," Retterer said, "but it's so differ
ent when you look at something on paper
and when you just do it."

What is most surprising is that Retter
er wasn't feeling his all-time best.
"I definitely had not trained enough,"
said Retterer of his thoughts going into
the meet. "I wasn't feeling very good in
the water."
Not exactly what you'd expect to hear
from a person who broke two American
records.
But with Pac-lOs moved up from
March to November this year, due to the
Olympic Trials, the Cardinal's ability to
turn in impressive individual perfor
mances at Pac-lOs was questioned.
That would all change as the meet pro
gressed. Several Stanford swimmers had
outstanding finishes, including Retterer,
who took third in the 50 free.
"It helped to have the 50 free as my
first event. There's no strategy in a 50
free. I got a really quick time that really
set the meet off," Retterer said, "plus my
teammates . . . with Chas (Morton) going
incredibly fast and Trip (Zedlitz) going so
fast... it was a total team performance."
"I was surprised at how well the team
did so early," coach Kenney said, "and
we're just starting to scratch the surface
of our potential."
Retterer broke his first record on the
first day of the competition, swimming
the lead-off leg on Stanford's "B" Medley
Relay team.
"I just got in and went all out. We were
all fired up," Retterer said.
Retterer finished his 100-yard back
stroke leg in 46.70 seconds, unknowingly
breaking the American record. Stanford
swimmer Jeff Rouse held the NCAA
record in the event, with 46.63, but due to
national rules, Rouse's mark couldn't be
counted as an American record.
Retterer thought he hadn't broken the
record, comparing his time to Rouse's.
"After the race, I didn't know it was a
record. (After I found out) I was very
excited at how fast I was swimming. It
was exhilarating," Retterer said.
The next day Retterer would better his
mark, breaking the NCAA record in
46.50. He got his second try in the indi
vidual 100-back, a swim Retterer claimed
was less stressful than the first.
"There probably was a lot of pressure,
but I didn't notice it. There were three
Stanford guys in the race. It was like rac
ing in workout," Retterer said.
The most impressive of Retterer's
swims came on the final day of competition,
as Retterer broke the American record in
the 200-back by nearly half a second.
. After two American records, and sever
al other events, Retterer and his team
mates didn't have the energy with which
they started the competition. The swim
mers had to swim preliminary and finals

'That was my best
swim, learning-wise. I
was mentally able to
move away from peo
ple. I think I have a lot
of potential to drop (in
the 200 back).'

neats in every event.
"There are a lot of swims in that meet.
I didn't think I physically had two strong
200's in me. I just planned on cruising
and punching in," Retterer said.
In the preliminary heat, Retterer had
some competition in the middle of the
race, and refused to give up his lead,
sprinting the remaining 75 yards. When
he looked up to see his time on the score
board, he was greeted by record-breaking
swim number three.
"I'd only swum 75 yards of hard swim
ming. I was shocked," Retterer said.
Going into the finals heat of the 200,
Retterer got a little nervous, remember
ing last season's conference champi
onships. Last year Retterer narrowly won
the 200, competing as one of an outstand
ing freshman class.
"Last year there was a lot of pressure
on me for that swim. I was a huge
favorite, and they'd already interviewed
me, but I choked and almost lost," Retter
er said. "But going into this year's race I
thought to myself, 'You've already done
it. Swim your own race.'"
This year Retterer had no trouble in the
finals, easily gaining the Pac-10 title, as
well as breaking his American record again.
"That was my best swim, learning
wise. I was mentally able to move away
from people. I think I have a lot of poten
tial to drop (in the 200 back). I can think
of so many different places where I can
improve. It was a highlight swim," Ret
terer said.
"What's great is to get a globe, look at
the U.S. and to say that this kid's the best
of all this. He's a future superstar in
American swimming. He's got talent, and
his head is on straight," Kenney said.
Stanford ended up winning the swim
ming portion of the meet by 270 points
over second-place California.
