# D.C. hearing on costs postponed
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
New indirect-cost allegations — which were
expected to be revealed in Washington, D.C. next
week — will remain behind closed doors a little longer.
The House Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations — chaired by the powerful Michigan
Democrat John Dingell — has postponed a hearing
updating government investigations that was origi
nally scheduled for Dec. 12.
"We will probably reschedule it, but we do not
know when," a subcommittee staff member said.
Indirect costs are expenses associated with
research but not attributed to any specific research
project, such as utilities, building maintenance and
administrative costs.
The hearing will likely occur in late January or
early February. No official reason was given for the
delay, but one possibility is that investigators from
the subcommittee and the regulatory agencies need
more time to prepare.
Expected to testify next week were representatives
from the Office of Naval Research and the Defense
Contract Audit Agency as well as the inspector gen
eral and other regulators from the Department of
Health and Human Services.
No officials from Stanford
have been asked to testify.
The hearing would not have
focused "completely on Stanford,"
but the University "certainly
would have come up," said anoth
er subcommittee staff member.
He added that the hearing might
have revealed "a few new allega
tions," but the main purpose was
"to provide an update on where
we are with the audits."
The subcommittee's investiga
tion into the indirect-cost billing
practices at Stanford and other
universities nationwide contin
ues, according to the staff mem
ber, and "things are moving
along."
"We haven't exactly found any
other 'Stanfords,' but we will
save the government a lot of
money," he said.
For instance, an audit at the

University of California revealed
that items such as flowers, enter
tainment and airline travel had
been charged as indirect costs,
and the University of Pennsylva
nia recently returned approxi
mately $1 million to the federal
government for improper billings.
Chief Financial Officer Peter
Van Etten has said the revelations
of improper indirect costs at other
universities has demonstrated
that Stanford was "not alone."
In a hearing last March, sub
committee members blasted
Stanford for expenses such as a
wedding reception and the depre
ciation of a yacht that were
included as indirect costs.
The subcommittee has not yet
examined the practice known as
tuition remission, in which the
University receives reimburse
ment for the tuition of graduate
students involved in government
sponsored research. But staff
members say their indirect-cost
investigation may expand into
that area as well as other charges
of abuse.
