For thousands of years, blacksmiths
have known that heat-treating metal
makes it stronger and harder. Swords
formed of tempered steel can afford to be
lighter while still being stronger than
those made of lesser metals.
Stanford women's basketball coach
Tara VanDerveer is a blacksmith. Her
weapon is the No. 3 Cardinal, tempered
by the fire of a brutal schedule. Her quest
is to capture the Pacific 10 Conference
title and the NCAA Championship.
An alloy with a strong youthful com
ponent, the Cardinal team has proven its
mettle so far, going 4-0 on road trips
against top-30 teams. The most recent
victory, a 74-71 decision over George
Washington last Saturday afternoon,
garnered Stanford the first-place trophy
in the 7-Up/UNLV Desert Classic.
Friday night the Cardinal dispatched
the hpst Runnin' Rebels 96-85.
George Washington gave Stanford its
toughest test of the young season. At the
end of an altogether ugly game, it came
down to two Cardinal freshmen sinking
four clutch free throws and a missed

Colonial three-pointer at the buzzer to
clinch the victory.
That the Colonials were there at all
was something of a surprise. Then
ranked No. 26, George Washington faced
then-No. 10 Texas in the first round. But
the Lady Longhorns had lost their All-
America candidate center Vicki Hall to
injury and the Colonials executed like a
top-10 team to send the Longhorns to the
consolation game.
Against Stanford, George Washington
proved that the previous night had been
no fluke. The Colonials held the Cardinal
to an ice-cold 27-percent field-goal per
centage in the first half. But, due in large
part to the outside shooting of Christy
Hedgpeth, Stanford clung to a three
point halftime lead.
That lead soon evaporated in the sec
ond half and the Cardinal found itself
down by as much as five points. But as

Hedgpeth continued her solid play, Val
Whiting began to assert herself inside
and Stanford was up by six points with
43 seconds left.
The Colonials then went into their
bomb-and-foul mode and almost sent the
game into overtime. A successful three
pointer brought George Washington with
in three, and then the Colonials fouled
Tanda Rucker. They hoped that the fresh
man would crack under the pressure.
No go. Rucker calmly sank both shots.
A few seconds and another George
Washington basket later, the Colonials
tried their luck with Rachel Hemmer,
another freshman. The results were the
same, however, and when George Wash
ington missed a trey at the buzzer, Stan
ford acquired its fourth "W."
"We came out in the second half with
the attitude that we were going to keep at
it," Kelly Dougherty said. "There are two
ways of playing," she said. "One is to play
to keep from losing. The other is to play
to win. We play to win."
The Runnin' Rebels also looked for a
while like they might give the Cardinal a
run for its money, as they hung close for
most of the first half. But an 18-0 run in
the waning minutes gave the Cardinal an

playing. One is to play to
keep from losing. The
other is to play to win. We

insurmountable 54-35 lead.
"I thought the last 10 minutes of the first
half we ran very well," VanDerveer said.
"But in the second half, I thought we left
our defensive intensity in the locker room."
Indeed, Stanford allowed 50 second
half points. The Cardinal will have to
improve its defense as it begins its home
schedule Dec. 7 at Maples Pavilion against
No. 40 Long Beach State at 7:30 p.m.
Fortunately for Stanford, the 49ers
like to play the Cardinal's up-tempo run
ning game. The final score is likely to be
high for both winner and loser.
But most fortunately for Stanford, the
Cardinal will finally be playing at home.
"Oh, man, lemme tell ya," Dougherty
said with a huge sigh, "it's good to be

home. It seems like we haven't been on
this campus since Lord knows when. It'll
be good to get Maples filled."
Stanford will have plenty of chances to
get Maples filled during the next month.
On Dec. 14 at 7:30 p.m. Tennessee comes
to town. On Dec. 19-20 Stanford will host
the Cardinal Classic_The Cardinal wili
face Oral Roberts at 8 p.m., right after a
North Carolina State-Southern Illinois
matchup at 6 p.m. Stanford will take on
San Diego Dec. 28 and Santa Clara Jan
3. Both games are at 7:30 p.m.
But, since most of these games are dur
ing winter vacation, it seems likely that only
two contests will really pack the pavilion.
The first is the Long Beach State
game. The second is the matchup against
No. 1 Tennessee.
The annual Stanford-Tennessee game
has taken on mythic proportions. When
the Lady Volunteers trounced Stanford
in the first game of the series late in
1988, VanDerveer said, "I don't know if
we'll ever beat them."
Tennessee went on to win the national
crown.
The following year Stanford achieved its
