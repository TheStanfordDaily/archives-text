The No. 1 women's swim team,
which has excelled in all of its
meets thus far this season, will be
hitting the pool often during win
ter vacation in preparation for
two big meets in January.
The Cardinal will journey
south Jan. 10-11 to take on both
USC and UCLA. Save Lori
Heisick, who participated in the
U.S. Open last weekend at the
Minnesota Aquatic Center in
Minneapolis, the team has not
raced since its convincing perfor
mance at the Texas Invitational
two weeks ago.
At the U.S. Open Heisick
swam the 100-meter breast
stroke, finishing fifth in a time of
1 minute 12 seconds.

Coach Richard Quick is more
than satisfied with his team's per
formance thus far thus season. "I'm
real pleased with where the team is
at this point," he said. "We swam
very well at the Texas Invite. I'm
very excited over the season and
with where we are now."
The team is poised to recap
ture the NCAA crown, which it
has not won since 1989, Quick's
first season as Cardinal women's
swim coach.
The women's team will remain
on the Farm until Dec. 20, then
will return to Stanford Dec. 27 to
prepare for the UCLA and USC
contests. Both teams sport
extremely strong swimming
teams and should further test the
Cardinal as the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships and NCAAs
draw near.
