# Beavers and Ducks pin wrestlers
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Excuse the Stanford wrestling team if the
grapplers wince slightly when you mention
the state of Oregon. The Cardinal squad
encountered some very tough competition in
its travels north last weekend. Against Ore
gon, Stanford fell by a final score of 25-10.
The Cardinal was then flattened by Oregon
State, 37-3.
The Oregon schools "were a little more
skilled, and a little more prepared than we
were," said coach Chris Horpel.
In addition, Stanford does not have a true
177-pound wrestler, which makes competi
tion in the heavier divisions difficult. In
order to fill that weight class, someone has
to wrestle in a weight class which is heavier
or lighter than that which he is used to. If
the former, then whoever happens to be
wrestling has to face someone who is natu
rally a heavier weight. If the latter, the
wrestler has to sweat off a lot of weight and
compete weak.
To make things worse for the Cardinal,

Stanford wrestled without a heavyweight,
which resulted in a forfeit for that class.
It seems that a combination of all these
problems led to a steady demise for the Car
dinal. Nevertheless, Horpel was pretty satis
fied with his wrestlers' performance against
the Ducks.
"We pretty much did all we could have
done against them. Maybe we could've got
ten one more win," Horpel said. "They were
just more prepared."
However, coach Horpel was not as
pleased with the performance of his team
against Oregon State. The lone win came
from Lance Johnson in the 142-pound
weight class. Horpel thinks that the Cardi
nal could have done much better against the
Beavers.

"I was disappointed. There were several
matches which could've gone either way,
and none of them went ours," Horpel said.
"At 167 and 190 (pound weight classes), we
were capable of getting the win."
Even though Stanford did come up short
in these early-season meets, the step up in
competition is a good thing for Horpel and
the Cardinal.
"These meets show us where we need
work," Horpel said. "We need to work more
on our skills, our conditioning and our men
tal toughness."
This weekend should prove to be an
excellent opportunity to show improve
ment in these areas. The Cardinal will
send wrestlers to the Las Vegas Invita
tional, which can be considered a preview
of the NCAAs Championships. Over 40
schools, mostly from the West and Mid
west, will be represented.
"Usually the team that wins [the Las
Vegas Invitational) also ends up winning
NCAAs," Horpel said. "We have some guys
that could place, but they'll pretty much be
dark horses."
