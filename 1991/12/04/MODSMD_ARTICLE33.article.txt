# Basketball team tramples over Buffaloes despite several injuries to Keefe
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Stanford defeated Colorado 71-
58 Saturday, but a string of
injuries to preseason Ail-American
Adam Keefe eclipsed the victory.
Keefe couldn't straighten his
left arm after the win, and X-rays
disclosed bone chips in his elbow.
He was able to straighten his arm

Monday and plans to play with
the injury.
Both Keefe and Stanford train
er Dake Walden downplayed the
significance of the injury, saying
it would not limit Keefe's play. No
surgery is scheduled, and the
injury is not career-threatening.

tice sprained his left thumb and

strained a hip muscle against Col
orado. He can expect to spend
Dead Week in the whirlpool, with
coach Mike Montgomery nearby
feeding him aspirin. Stanford
does not play again until Dec. 14.
Despite his ailments, Keefe tal
lied his usual 22 points and 10
rebounds, and Brent Williams
and Peter Dukes scored career
highs as the men's basketball
team subdued the Buffaloes.
After shooting 37 percent from
the field in the first half, the Car
dinal improved to 3-0 by playing
determined defense and hitting
nine straight free throws down
the stretch.
"I'm very encouraged," said
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery.
"We did a good job on defense, and
any time you play good defense
you can win the game.
"Our decision making was not
very good, and we needed to make
more of a push at the end. They
were a little quicker to the ball
than some people we'd seen. They
had pretty good athletes — big
kids. But the bottom line is we
won, we were in control the whole
way, and we got good bench play."
After a David Harbour layup,
Stanford led 50-32 with 10:15 left
in the game, but the Buffaloes did
not pack it in. Sparked by 12 sec
ond-half points from guard Billy

Law, Colorado cut Stanford's lead
to 59-53 with 2:57 remaining.
Stanford turned the ball over a
season-high 18 times, but was
able to hold onto the ball and
make 10 of 12 free throws in the
critical final two minutes, avert
ing a Colorado comeback.
"An experienced team probably
would have put that game out of
reach," said Keefe, trying to
define Stanford's young team.
"Of course, an inexperienced
team might have lost it."
"I was responsible for most of
the bone-headed plays at the end
of the halves," said Keefe, who
had zero field goals and four
turnovers the last six minutes of
the game.
Point guard Marcus Lollie sank 5
of 6 free throws, while Keefe and
Williams added two each to give
Stanford a 68-56 lead with 35 sec
onds left. One free throw from
Dukes and a driving layup from Har
bour added insurance at the end.
Dukes, who scored a career
high 13 points, drained three
three-pointers in a 2:28 stretch of
the first half, giving Stanford an
early 17-9 lead. Freshman for
ward Andy Poppink gave Stan
ford a lift off the bench with two
points, an assist and an offensive
rebound in five minutes of action.
Colorado never got closer than
six points and trailed 34-26 at the
half, although Stanford shot a frigid
10-of-27 in the opening stanza and
turned the ball over 10 times.

career-high 16 points with

"My confidence came back," said
Williams, who tied his career high
with 10 rebounds. "What I did
today should be my average work
day."

NIT semifinals last year, fell to 1-

"Stanford has another good
team this year," said Colorado
coach Joe Harrington, whose
team beat Stanford 89-79 last
year in Boulder. "They're not as
young as you think they are, and
when you have a Keefe to build
around, it's a good place to start."
