CARD NOTES — Stanford so far has equaled its hot start of 1989-90, when it
shot off to an 8-0 record before losing at Kansas .. . Brent Williams and
Peter Dukes scored career highs against Colorado.
KEEFE KORNER — Keefe is a perfect 21-for-21 from the free-throw line, and
with 672 career attempts is on pace to break Sean Elliott's Pacific 10 Con
ference free-throw-attempt record of 786. The Stanford consecutive streak
is 40, set by Todd Lichti in 1988-89 ... Keefe is also on mark to set Stan
ford's career scoring and rebounding records ... if he can stay healthy.
