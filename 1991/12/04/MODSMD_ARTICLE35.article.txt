# Seattle native Marcus Lollie leads youthful pack of Cardinal hoopsters
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
When point guard Marcus Lollie fired
down a two-handed slam dunk in Stan
ford's season-opening 98-56 victory over
Loyola College, it meant a lot more than
two points.
Lollie's first career jam gave Stanford a
32-point lead and Lollie his only points of
the game, but more importantly it drove
home a leadership point to the Stanford
team.
Lollie will not be backing down from
any challenges this year, and as the floor
leader for the Cardinal he'll expect the
same from his teammates.
"I was so fired up, I didn't even think
about it," said 6-foot Lollie, who stole the
ball at midcourt and soared off two feet
for the dunk. "Later on when I came to
the bench, I realized what I had done and
I got a little scared. If I had missed, coach
would have killed me."
After playing a reserve role his first
two seasons, the Seattle junior is sudden
ly the team leader, expected to show the
new guys how things are done, whether it
be dunking or defensive drills.
"We have a lot of young guys right
now, and they're looking up to me," said
Lollie, who was voted by his teammates to
be co-captain with Adam Keefe. "If I can
get people fired up and I do my job, that
makes their jobs that much easier."
Lollie has scored just 14 points in Stan
ford's first three wins, but he was named
to the Apple Invitational all-tournament
team because of his leadership and team
play.
In Stanford's 68-64 defeat of Rice, Lol
lie sunk both halves of a one-and-one free
throw situation with 50 seconds left to
give the Cardinal a 67-62 lead. He
grabbed eight defensive rebounds in the
first half against Loyola and has dished
out 20 assists in the first three games.
Montgomery isn't concerned about
how many points Lollie scores, he just
needs him to run the team and get the
ball to Keefe, the ail-American in the mid
dle. Behind Keefe, Lollie is the most expe
rienced player on the team.
"I'm very, very impressed with Mar
cus," Montgomery said. "When you get
good point-guard play, the team looks
good. When you get bad point-guard play,
other players often get the blame. Marcus

has done a really good job."
"I can't tell him to run the club, con
trol the floor, and cover Harold Miner
for 40 minutes too," Montgomery said.
"Defensively, if he's healthy and not
tired, he can pressure and defend any
body. But we have to have him at the
end of the game with a few brain cells
left."

'Defensively, if he's
healthy and not tired, he

anybody. But we have to

Lollie relishes his new leadership role
and plans to make some noise on the
floor. When Kenny Hicks came off the
bench a step slow against Rice, Lollie let
him know he wasn't playing up to speed.
"What I didn't want was for us to get
complacent. It looked like Kenny was get
ting a little too relaxed," Lollie said.
"There will be a lot more yelling — there
are 25 games left."
Lollie fashions his game after Tim
Hardaway of the Golden State Warriors, a
leadership role model Montgomery would
love to see cloned in his backcourt.
"I like his style of play," Lollie said.
"He has a certain flair and cockiness, just
like a defensive back in football. You have
to have an edge."
The "edge" for Lollie is dunking when
a layup scores just as many points. And if
the team will follow him, Lollie will edge
the Cardinal right into postseason play.
Pac-10 Notes
Four Arizona State starters have been sus
pended from the team by coach Bill Frieder for
making illegal telephone credit card calls at
school expense. The players, including Jamal
Faulkner, last year's Pac-10 Freshman of the
Year, will miss at least four games. The Sun
Devils were ranked No. 25 before the suspen
sions.
