Women's soccer For several weeks Stanford
midfielder Julie Foudy traded in her Cardinal uni
form to represent the red, white and blue. Foudy,
a starter on the United States National team,
helped the American squad to victory in the inau
gural women's World Championships.
The 12-nation tournament, hosted by China,
involved competition in three four-team pools.
The Americans emerged unscathed from group-B
play, sweeping Sweden, Japan, and Brazil.
In the quarterfinals, Foudy tallied a score as
the U.S. trounced Taiwan, 7-0. Michelle Akers-
Stahl led the Americans with five goals in the con
test.

The Germans fared slightly better in the semi
finals, but lost 5-2. Carin Jennings spearheaded
the U.S. attack with three first-half goals. April
Heinrichs notched two in the second stanza to put
the game out of reach.
The U.S. captured the title with a 2-1 victory
over Norway in the final. Both goals came from
Akers-Stahl.
Rugby The Cardinal ruggers host the annual
Stanford Tens tournament Dec. 7. At least 30-40
teams are expected in the invitational competi
tion, including California and a Stanford alumni
squad. Play begins at 8:30 a.m. on the intramural
fields.
