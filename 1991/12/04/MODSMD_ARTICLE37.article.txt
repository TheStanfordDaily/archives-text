## Danger in the air: Study investigates pilots and alcohol 
### Joelle Linder Staff writer 
It's said that fly
ing is endless
hours of bore
dom, inter
rupted by
moments
of sheer

terror. But with a little alcohol thrown in, those
moments of terror can become deadly.
In a comprehensive study of pilot memory profi
ciency, a research group at the Veteran's Adminis
tration Hospital in Palo Alto is examining the way
alcohol limits pilots' flying capabilities.
The study began more than 12 years ago as a way
to look at the effects of marijuana on pilot memory.
Since then, the project has passed through several
phases, all examining brain memory capacity and its
effect on aviation safety.

Currently, the research team is examining the
effects of blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) levels of
0.08 percent and 0.10 percent on pilots' memory
abilities.
In 1985, the Federal Aviation Administration cre
ated a rule prohibiting anyone from flying or acting
as a crew member when having 0.04 percent BAC or
higher. This rule, coupled with the eight-hour bot
tle-to-throttle rule, was supposed to make the
increasingly crowded skies safer.
Dolhert works directly with the study's partici-

pants — pilots. Currently, young
pilots (ages 20 to 34) and older
pilots (50 and over) are being stud
ied.
All participants are licensed
pilots who have logged between
100 and 10,000 hours of flying
time, and they vary in skill. The
program uses an airplane simula
tor programmed by Psychiatry
Prof. Jerome Yesavage, who is
also a pilot.
According to Dolhert, the
research group is looking at "pro
cessing and memory while a per
son is under a severe overload of
tasks." After several training ses
sions on the simulator, the pilots
are tested for memory capacity
while flying under severe turbu
lence and while dealing with
engine failures or oil pressure
drops.
During the 80-minute
experimental sessions, pilots are
given an overwhelming amount of
tower control instructions. Every
three minutes, the pilots receive
new instructions in order to test

for memory overload.
Dolhert said the group is trying to ascertain the
point "where their ability to deal with things falls
apart."
An average set of instructions given to the pilots
is: "Cessna l-niner-5-7-yankee, turn left heading 2-
7-0 degrees. Climb and maintain 5,000 feet. Contact
Oakland Center l-2-7-point-8." In fact, such
instructions are typical of instructions a pilot might
receive at the nearby Palo Alto airport — one of the
busiest small airports in the country, according to
Dolhert.
In order to prevent disasters, air traffic con
trollers may speed up their instructions to pilots
when the skies become crowded. Controllers must
keep in contact with all the planes flying in the vicin
ity as well as those trying to take off. As the pilots in
the study get used to the simulator, the instructions
are sped up to match and go beyond this accelerated
speech level.
In addition to rapid instructions, the researchers
throw in oncoming traffic that needs to be avoided,
turbulence, oil pressure drops and more. The pilots
are not allowed to write the changes down or ask for
a repeat. They must memorize and repeat back all
information while dealing with traffic and general
problems.
Sound difficult? Try adding a few drinks to bring
the pilots up to 0.08 percent or 0.10 percent BAC.
Now how do the pilots deal with all the normal
stresses of flying?
"People change their priorities when they're
drinking," Dolhert said. Some pilots, she said, even
thought they flew better drunk. She said that
"because they're devoting their attention to fewer of
the variables, they could actually fly better on those
variables."
They might make it on a routine flight, she said,

but they could easily miss a drop
in oil pressure, or something
worse.
During some of the sessions,
several pilots forgot to check on
their altitude and "crashed." Dol
hert said a big problem was that
they "can't simulate panic."
Ninety-one passengers on a
Northwest Airlines flight got
lucky in March 1990 when their
plane's drunk crew landed their
plane safely. The crew was arrest
ed for drunken flying.
Even though hours had passed
from the time the crew had
stopped drinking the night before
to the time they landed the jetlin
er, their blood-alcohol levels still
tested dangerously high. The
plane's captain, Norman Prouse,
had a 0.13 percent BAC, the copi
lot, Robert Kirchner, had a 0.06
percent BAC and the flight engi
neer, Joseph Balzer, had a 0.08
percent BAC.
"At 0.10 percent BAC, every
thing across the board is affect
ed," according to Joy Taylor, a
research psychologist. She said
high BACs especially affect the
approach, landing, radio commu
nications and emergency avoid
ance.
At 0.08 percent BAC, memory
capacity for communication will

be "hardest hit even when some
of the other aspects of flying have
already started to recover. Still,
the approach and landing are
hardest at the end of a long
flight," Taylor added.
When all of these factors are
added to a pilot's age — the focus
of another part of the study — the
researchers found that memory
tends to decline with age and that
there is a slowing in reaction
time.
Dolhert said that pilots have
told her they may have a drink
and be tired when they go to drive
their car, but they would never fly
a plane in the same condition. She
said that it's because "every
thing's happening in 3-D. You
can't pull over on a cloud."
One participant in the study,
"Richard," is 67 and has 30 years
Naval Aviation experience with
over 600 aircraft carrier landings
and 8,400 hours flying time.
Pilots "have to pay strict atten
tion to detail," Richard said.
While he was in the Navy, he said
the pilots took no chances and
regulations were more strict than
FAA regulations. Pilots waited
anywhere from 12 to 24 hours for
alcohol and hangover fatigue to
wear off.
The study is being funded by
the National Institute of Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism, and the
researchers hope their studies on
hangover effects and aging will be
used bv the FAA.

ed," according to Joy Taylor, a
research psychologist. She said
high BACs especially affect the
approach, landing, radio commu
nications and emergency avoid
ance.
At 0.08 percent BAC, memory
capacity for communication will

be "hardest hit even when some
of the other aspects of flying have
already started to recover. Still,
the approach and landing are
hardest at the end of a long
flight," Taylor added.
When all of these factors are
added to a pilot's age — the focus
of another part of the study — the
researchers found that memory
tends to decline with age and that
there is a slowing in reaction
time.
Dolhert said that pilots have
told her they may have a drink
and be tired when they go to drive
their car, but they would never fly
a plane in the same condition. She
said that it's because "every
thing's happening in 3-D. You
can't pull over on a cloud."
One participant in the study,
"Richard," is 67 and has 30 years
Naval Aviation experience with
over 600 aircraft carrier landings
and 8,400 hours flying time.
Pilots "have to pay strict atten
tion to detail," Richard said.
While he was in the Navy, he said
the pilots took no chances and
regulations were more strict than
FAA regulations. Pilots waited
anywhere from 12 to 24 hours for
alcohol and hangover fatigue to
wear off.
The study is being funded by
the National Institute of Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism, and the
researchers hope their studies on
hangover effects and aging will be
used bv the FAA.
It's said that fly
ing is endless
hours of bore
dom, inter
rupted by
moments
of sheer

terror. But with a little alcohol thrown in, those
moments of terror can become deadly.
In a comprehensive study of pilot memory profi
ciency, a research group at the Veteran's Adminis
tration Hospital in Palo Alto is examining the way
alcohol limits pilots' flying capabilities.
The study began more than 12 years ago as a way
to look at the effects of marijuana on pilot memory.
Since then, the project has passed through several
phases, all examining brain memory capacity and its
effect on aviation safety.

Currently, the research team is examining the
effects of blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) levels of
0.08 percent and 0.10 percent on pilots' memory
abilities.
In 1985, the Federal Aviation Administration cre
ated a rule prohibiting anyone from flying or acting
as a crew member when having 0.04 percent BAC or
higher. This rule, coupled with the eight-hour bot
tle-to-throttle rule, was supposed to make the
increasingly crowded skies safer.
Dolhert works directly with the study's partici-

pants — pilots. Currently, young
pilots (ages 20 to 34) and older
pilots (50 and over) are being stud
ied.
All participants are licensed
pilots who have logged between
100 and 10,000 hours of flying
time, and they vary in skill. The
program uses an airplane simula
tor programmed by Psychiatry
Prof. Jerome Yesavage, who is
also a pilot.
According to Dolhert, the
research group is looking at "pro
cessing and memory while a per
son is under a severe overload of
tasks." After several training ses
sions on the simulator, the pilots
are tested for memory capacity
while flying under severe turbu
lence and while dealing with
engine failures or oil pressure
drops.
During the 80-minute
experimental sessions, pilots are
given an overwhelming amount of
tower control instructions. Every
three minutes, the pilots receive
new instructions in order to test

for memory overload.
Dolhert said the group is trying to ascertain the
point "where their ability to deal with things falls
apart."
An average set of instructions given to the pilots
is: "Cessna l-niner-5-7-yankee, turn left heading 2-
7-0 degrees. Climb and maintain 5,000 feet. Contact
Oakland Center l-2-7-point-8." In fact, such
instructions are typical of instructions a pilot might
receive at the nearby Palo Alto airport — one of the
busiest small airports in the country, according to
Dolhert.
In order to prevent disasters, air traffic con
trollers may speed up their instructions to pilots
when the skies become crowded. Controllers must
keep in contact with all the planes flying in the vicin
ity as well as those trying to take off. As the pilots in
the study get used to the simulator, the instructions
are sped up to match and go beyond this accelerated
speech level.
In addition to rapid instructions, the researchers
throw in oncoming traffic that needs to be avoided,
turbulence, oil pressure drops and more. The pilots
are not allowed to write the changes down or ask for
a repeat. They must memorize and repeat back all
information while dealing with traffic and general
problems.
Sound difficult? Try adding a few drinks to bring
the pilots up to 0.08 percent or 0.10 percent BAC.
Now how do the pilots deal with all the normal
stresses of flying?
"People change their priorities when they're
drinking," Dolhert said. Some pilots, she said, even
thought they flew better drunk. She said that
"because they're devoting their attention to fewer of
the variables, they could actually fly better on those
variables."
They might make it on a routine flight, she said,

but they could easily miss a drop
in oil pressure, or something
worse.
During some of the sessions,
several pilots forgot to check on
their altitude and "crashed." Dol
hert said a big problem was that
they "can't simulate panic."
Ninety-one passengers on a
Northwest Airlines flight got
lucky in March 1990 when their
plane's drunk crew landed their
plane safely. The crew was arrest
ed for drunken flying.
Even though hours had passed
from the time the crew had
stopped drinking the night before
to the time they landed the jetlin
er, their blood-alcohol levels still
tested dangerously high. The
plane's captain, Norman Prouse,
had a 0.13 percent BAC, the copi
lot, Robert Kirchner, had a 0.06
percent BAC and the flight engi
neer, Joseph Balzer, had a 0.08
percent BAC.
