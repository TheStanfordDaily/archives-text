# A new lease on life
## Infant winning fight for life after unprecedented lung transplant 
### Joanne Adams 
A first in lung-transplant surgery
occurred at the Medical Center a little over a
month ago — and history is still in the mak
ing.
That's because Jacqueline Reed, who was
just 17 days old when she received a new lung
on Oct. 27, continues to make progress.
The transplant was performed by a team
of surgeons led by Dr. Vaughn Starnes, head
of Stanford's heart and heart-lung trans
plant programs. Reed received the new lung
to increase her chances of surviving a life
threatening abnormality called a diaphrag
matic hernia.
She is the first infant with such a defect to
receive a lung transplant.
The defect in her respiratory diaphragm
caused the protrusion of her abdominal
organs into the chest area — essentially pre
venting her right lung from developing and
resulting in an inadequate left lung.
When she arrived at the Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital in October, she
was immediately put on extra-corporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to treat her
respiratory failure.
Pulmonary hypertension — high blood
pressure in her left pulmonary circuit — was
causing a high resistance to blood flow
through her left lung. Therefore, she wasn't
able to get enough oxygen in her blood to sus
tain life on her own.
Reed's first major surgery was to repair
her hernia, which was "very difficult from a
technical standpoint," according to Dr.
Stephen Shochat, an associate professor of
Surgery who performed the operation.
Shochat explained Reed was on ECMO
throughout her hernia operation and there
fore was being treated with anti-coagulants
to keep her blood from clotting. This caused
the doctors to be particularly concerned
about the potential for profuse bleeding dur
ing the surgery.
In addition, because she had so very little
native diaphragm on her right side, Reed
needed a synthetic graft to make her
diaphragm big enough to separate her
abdominal and chest cavities.

Shochat said, "She did amazingly well
after her hernia repair," after which she was
taken off ECMO and put on a ventilator.
When she failed to improve, however, it
became more obvious that she wasn't likely
to make it without a lung transplant.
Despite her very tough start, Reed did
manage a little luck. Marguerite Brown,
transplant coordinator, said she was contact
ed about a potential lung donor within only
two weeks of placing Reed on a nationwide list
— The United Network for Organ Sharing.
"A lot of adults wait for months or years,"
Brown said. Though there is not a big
demand for single lungs, "lung donors are
difficult to acquire," she added. That's
because the lungs are usually the first to
deteriorate due to their high susceptibility to
infection in donors who are brain dead.
With a successful patient-donor match,
the stage was set for the very first lung trans
plant into an infant with a diaphragmatic
hernia.
About 350 lung transplants are expected
in the United States in the coming year,
Starnes said, with fewer than 10 or 15 to
children.
Of course, there is no precedent for the
long-term care of a child with a lung trans
plant who has such a severe underlying
defect.
Rejection of the transplanted lung is a
major concern. To reduce the chances of
rejection, Reed received immunosuppres
sants. These drugs reduce the chances of her
immune cells "recognizing" the transplanted
lung as foreign tissue and rejecting it.
For her lung transplant, Reed benefited
from the development of the immuno
suppressants cyclosporine and OKT3. By
administering these drugs at the outset, doc
tors could at least temporarily hold off on using
traditional steroid immunosuppressants.
The surgical wounds in her airway would
not have been able to heal in the presence of
steroids.
At the same time, because her immune
system is suppressed for the sake of the
transplanted lung, she will always be vulner
able to infection.
"Rejection can occur at any time in her

life," DeCampli noted.
The transplanted lung essentially buys
Reed some very precious time. "There's noth
ing that the right lung is doing directly to
help her left lung," DeCampli said. But it is of
invaluable help "because the baby can
thrive," he said.
The transplanted right lung may serve as
a bridge to give her native left lung a chance
to grow. The underlying hope is that her left
lung will become fully functional so that her
life wouldn't be threatened should she even
tually reject the transplant.
Her day-to-day problems stem from the
primary defect in her diaphragm. "She
doesn't have the strength to draw in the air
and exchange gases," explained Helen
Luikhart, a nurse at the hospital and one of
Reed's care-givers.
It's the up-and-down movement of the
diaphragm that enables the lungs to inflate
with air to let oxygen be taken up by the
blood cells and then deflate again to be ready
for another cycle. Luikhart said Reed has
insufficient motion from her diaphragm. As a
result, secretions that can normally be
removed by coughing accumulate primarily
in her right lung.
She needs to be intubated periodically
with a tube in her trachea — a "pulmonary
toilet" — used to clear her lungs out. Starnes
believes "she will eventually overcome (the
need for the tube)."
DeCampli said, "There is considerable
death associated with congenital diaphrag
matic hernia to begin with. Regardless of the
problems we are having, we feel this attempt
(at a lung transplant) is fully justified for dra
matically increasing the survival of these
severe cases of diaphragmatic hernia. . ..
"So far, we have certainly learned a lot and
hope to apply (this approach) to other cases
in the future."
Reed's parents, Chris and Teresa Reed of
San Jose, have found the waiting to be the
most difficult part for them. "It's hope,"
Chris said, that gives him the strength to deal
with these trying times. With any luck at all,
Reed has inherited some of her parents'
resilience to help her continue making
progress.
