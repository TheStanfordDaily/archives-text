# He's in the money
## Foundation awards promising prof. 500K to study whatever he wants

Who would have thought that
a science fair participant from
Blue Mountain High School in
the small town of Schuylkill
haven, Penn., could end up a
Stanford professor and the win
ner of an award giving him
$500,000 for research over five
years?
Yet Eric Shaqfeh, a professor
of chemical engineering, is just
such a person.
Recently, he was named a
Packard Award recipient by the
Packard Foundation, which is
trying to encourage young scien
tists. This year, the foundation
awarded 20 such grants to
promising young scientists
between the ages of 25 and 36.
"What is great about the
money is that it is not tied to a
specific project or idea. I can use
it to develop my lab and an exper
imental part of my research,"
Shaqfeh said.
Shaqfeh was selected on the
basis of his overall reputation,
not for a specific research project.
Stanford had the opportunity to
nominate two people, and senior
faculty members nominated him
based on his promising work in
many areas including fluid
mechanics.
After receiving a B.S. in chem
ical engineering at Princeton,
Shaqfeh continued his education
at Stanford. Here, he received an
M.S. and a Ph.D. in chemical
engineering.
After receiving his degrees, he
studied in Cambridge, England,
and worked for Bell Laboratories.
"The academic life has given
me more opportunities than I
would have had in industrv. A lot

more ideas that I've had can be
brought to fruition through
working with my graduate stu
dents," Shaqfeh said.
The enthusiastic professor
adds, "I also enjoy teaching!" He
teaches Chemical Engineering
150 for undergraduates.
"I feel that American society
as a whole does not support
American science," Shaqfeh said.
"I can't help but feel that now . . .
science in this country is starting
to get such a bad name.
"I feel that American society
on the average does not want
their sons and daughters to be
scientists or engineers. These are
not chosen professions."
Shaqfeh observed that in dif
ferent countries, science and
engineering are supported and
that students are exposed to
these fields at an earlier age,
resulting in more discipline.
