# At the sound of the beep, it's horripilation!

Q. When I hear my voice on my
• answering machine, 1 am
startled because my voice sounds
so different. Why does my voice
sound so strange when I hear it
on tape ?
A. It's a sad fact of life — the
• way you hear your voice on
tape is the way other people hear
you as well.
The reason for this difference
is bone conduction. When you
hear other people speak, you are
hearing the sound as it passes
from their vocal cords, through
the air and your eardrums. But
when you hear yourself speak,
you also hear sound as it passes
from your vocal cords through
your thick skull.
The sound conducted through

your skull vibrates at a
lower frequency. These
low-frequency sound
waves make your speech
dynamic and powerful.
Too bad you're the only
one who hears your voice
this way!
It is important to be
able to hear your own
voice. As you listen to
yourself speak, you con
stantly adjust the ten-

sion of your vocal cords to make
correct sounds.
It is possible to disturb this
feedback loop. If your voice is
played back to you through ear
phones with a time delay, your
pronunciation and accent will
change. If the delay is made long
enough, you will not be able to
speak at all. Wouldn't this be an
excellent prank to play on a bor
ing lecturer?
While hearing your own voice
is necessary to speak properly,
you can get too much of a good
thing. Since you are closer to your
own vocal cords than anyone else,
your voice would be quite loud to

your own ears, were it
not for two tiny mus
cles. Within 100 mil
liseconds of speaking,
these muscles contract
to muffle the low-fre
quency sounds in your
voice. Without these
muscles a baby's cries
would reach its own
ears with the same
intensity as a train
passing.

Q, Why do we get goosebumps?
A # Goosebumps are also known
• as gooseflesh, goosepimples,
cutis anserina, piloerection or
horripilation. Like the appendix,
goosebumps do not have an obvi
ous function in humans.
Each place on your skin where
a hair grows, called a follicle, has
the capacity to create a goose
bump. Each follicle is equipped
with an extremely tiny muscle,
the arrector pili muscle. One end
of the arrector pili muscle is
attached underneath your outer

most skin layer. The other end
attaches to the base of the follicle,
which lies deeper in the skin.
With the proper stimulus this
muscle contracts, pulls on the
base of the follicle, allows the hair
to stand up and creates a ripple at
the other point of attachment.
Cold temperatures cause con
traction of the arrector pili mus
cles. This raises the hairs of furry
animals. Raised fur traps air,
which is warmed by the body and
aids in thermal insulation.
The pili muscles are also sensi
tive to the hormone adrenalin,
which is dumped by glands into
your blood when you are excited or
scared. This hormone primes your
body for action in case you'll need
to fight or flee. Adrenalin is what
makes a playful "Boo!" a hair-rais
ing experience. (Literally!)
Animals show the same response
to adrenalin. When a small animal
is confronted by a big animal, the
small animal's hair stands on end,
making him appear larger to the big
animal. But, even a very hairy per
son will not be able to save himself
from a bully via piloerection.
