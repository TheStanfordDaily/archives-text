The Stanford Men's Ultimate
Team ventured to windy Santa
Cruz for a Thanksgiving tourna
ment Nov. 30-Dec. 1. Twelve
teams competed, including Santa
Barbara, Humboldt State, Oregon
State, Caltech, UC-San Diego and
Santa Cruz. Although missing
two thirds of its 50-man squad,
the Cardinal traipsed through
pool play with an authoritative 5-
0 sweep.
"We were beautiful in the larg
er sense of the word," said acting
co-captain and team astrologer
Pepper Williams.
In game five of pool play, the

indefatigable Cardinal squared off
against the Black Tide of Santa
Barbara, which had taken the
national title three consecutive
years from 1988-90. Stanford
won 13-7.
"The Black Tide knocked us
out of Regionals last year on a
very questionable call, otherwise
there is a good chance we would
have made nationals," Bob
Anderson said. "It was sweet
vengeance to beat them."
The Cardinal coasted through
the semi- and quarterfinals with a
13-2 win over San Diego and a 13-
8 win over national champion
Santa Cruz. In the finals, Stan
ford faced the Oregon Ducks.

The Cardinal lost the final, 11-
7. "The Ducks sported a highly
experienced team, while we
donned a pastiche of experience
among our players," acting co
captain Jim Staib said. "But we
were very pleased with our rook
ies. They've come a long way in
just a few months."
"Stanford has a huge roster of
50 players. We will split into A
and B teams next quarter,"
Williams said. "Our A team, along
with Oregon and Santa Barbara,
is a major contender for the
national championship. Our B
team will also be highly competi
tive, and we expect it may well fin
ish in the top five in the region."
