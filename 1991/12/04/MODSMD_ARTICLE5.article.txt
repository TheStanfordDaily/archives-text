# Some H&S profs fear across-the-board cuts
## Deans urged to target weakest programs

Einstein once said the laws of science
can't be determined by popular vote. Nei
ther can good budget cuts, some faculty
members argue.
Many Humanities and Sciences faculty,
dissatisfied with the school's current budget
reduction process, say the school's deans
should take the lead in making strategic
decisions to meet its $5 million target.
They fear that committees composed of
faculty members from many academic disci
plines will decide on more general or across
the-board cuts instead of targeting weak or
inefficient programs.
"The consensus decision in this case
would be the wrong decision," said Chem
istry Dept. Chair Harden McConnell, a
member of the school's natural sciences
planning group, "Someone higher up in the
University will ultimately have to make a

lot of these choices."
The school's three ad hoc planning
groups, which have studied the effects of
cuts on the humanities, social sciences and
natural sciences, met Monday for the last
time. Next week a schoolwide planning
group will decide on final recommendations.
Humanities and Sciences Dean Ewart
Thomas and Assoc. Deans Carolyn Lougee,
Roger Noll and Alexander Fetter will study
and possibly modify the proposal before
submitting it to the Cabinet Committee on
Budget and Strategic Planning by the Jan.
17 deadline.
Faculty members said they welcome the
inclusive and consultative process the
school is using to reduce its $58-million
general funds budget. But they added that
they're looking to the deans for leadership
in making some of the more controversial
budget decisions.
The general funds budget
includes everything but money
specifically earmarked by donors.
"At some point someone has to
say, we're going to cut our top
flight departments by this amount
and our weaker departments by
some larger amount," said Politi
cal Science Dept. Chair Stephen
Krasner. "The problem is that no
faculty committee can do that."
Lougee said the deans share
that concern and are prepared to
exert leadership in making the
school's final decisions. "We'll
take the advice of the planning
groups seriously, but ultimately
they are just advisory," she said.
The deans will have to make
the decisions that "won't be as
politically palatable," she said.
For example, reductions will like
ly be different for each of the school's
three academic areas, she added.
Faculty in the humanities,
social sciences and natural sci

ences have argued that cuts of
much greater than 8 percent
would significantly damage their
programs, Lougee said.
But giving the areas roughly
equal reductions wouldn't solve the
problem. Fetter said level cuts
might have a more traumatic effect
on the "tighter" natural science
programs, which he said haven't
grown as rapidly as humanities
programs during the last five years.
"I think if you go beyond (a
reduction of) 6 percent in the sci
ences, you would do some serious
damage," Fetter said.
Several department chairs said
they fear losing many of their fac
ulty if Stanford's strongest
departments aren't spared.
Krasner said, "People are more
likely to leave from the best
departments" because they receive
lucrative offers from other institu
tions.
"The bottom line for cutbacks
should be to try and do the least
damage you can to the quality of
the faculty," he added.
Lougee said faculty departures
are "a very strong concern."
