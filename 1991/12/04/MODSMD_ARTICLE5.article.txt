# Some H&S profs fear across-the-board cuts
## Deans urged to target weakest programs

Einstein once said the laws of science
can't be determined by popular vote. Nei
ther can good budget cuts, some faculty
members argue.
Many Humanities and Sciences faculty,
dissatisfied with the school's current budget
reduction process, say the school's deans
should take the lead in making strategic
decisions to meet its $5 million target.
They fear that committees composed of
faculty members from many academic disci
plines will decide on more general or across
the-board cuts instead of targeting weak or
inefficient programs.
"The consensus decision in this case
would be the wrong decision," said Chem
istry Dept. Chair Harden McConnell, a
member of the school's natural sciences
planning group, "Someone higher up in the
University will ultimately have to make a

lot of these choices."
The school's three ad hoc planning
groups, which have studied the effects of
cuts on the humanities, social sciences and
natural sciences, met Monday for the last
time. Next week a schoolwide planning
group will decide on final recommendations.
Humanities and Sciences Dean Ewart
Thomas and Assoc. Deans Carolyn Lougee,
Roger Noll and Alexander Fetter will study
and possibly modify the proposal before
submitting it to the Cabinet Committee on
Budget and Strategic Planning by the Jan.
17 deadline.
Faculty members said they welcome the
inclusive and consultative process the
school is using to reduce its $58-million
general funds budget. But they added that
they're looking to the deans for leadership
in making some of the more controversial
budget decisions.
