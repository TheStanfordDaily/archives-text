# Officials want Chandra to get psychiatrist's OK

Unregistered medical student Ravi
Chandra cannot use Medical School facili
ties until a psychiatrist establishes that he is
"not in jeopardy of doing harm," according
to a letter delivered to Chandra last week.
But Chandra, who was escorted from the
Medical School last month, said he does not
plan to have a psychiatric evaluation any time
soon because he is studying for the academic
exams he missed last year that led to his sus
pension.
According to Senior Assoc. Dean for Stu
dent Affairs Charlotte Jacobs, who signed
the letter, Chandra will have to get psychi
atric clearance in order to use the Medical
School even after he takes the exams and
becomes a registered student.
Chandra said he is permitted to come onto

Medical School grounds if
he has an appointment with
a dean, or if he is scheduled
to take an exam.
He said the psychiatrist
will probably be chosen by
Counseling and Psycholog
ical Services at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center. Jacobs
said, "Cowell Health
always assists us."

Alejandro Martinez, the director of stu
dent health services, said he knew of cases
of medical holds, though he did not know
about the Chandra situation specifically.
"When a student experiences a psycho
logical crisis . . . they can be put on medical
hold until they show evidence that they're
ready to return to campus. Usually, they

need a letter from a therapist and
will then have an interview with one
of the [CAPSJ staff," Martinez said.
According to Jacobs, Chandra
was escorted off campus Nov. 21
because Medical School deans had
received "numerous calls by peo
ple concerned about Ravi."
Jacobs declined to characterize
the nature of these concerns, say
ing only that they were sufficient

basis for the deans to take action.
The day Chandra was led from
campus, Medical School Dean
David Korn said he was concerned
about "potential violent reac
tions" from Chandra.
Medical school spokesperson
Spyros Andreopoulos said stu
dents told administrators that
Chandra had threatened violence
if he were not allowed to speak to
the Medical School Faculty Senate.
Chandra denies ever threaten
ing violence. He said he still does
not know specifically what the
student concerns were about.

"People were worried that if I
spoke at the Faculty Senate meet
ing, it would be hazardous to my
career and damaging to the issues
(of sexual harassment)," he said.
Chandra said he is not angry
about the allegations that he
threatened violence. "I was being
stubborn," he said. "I can't be
angry â€” basically, it was just a
huge misunderstanding."
Jacobs said Chandra had been
suspended by the Committee on
Student Performance because of
his academics, not because of his
outspoken political views.
