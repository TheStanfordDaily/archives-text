# Pearl Harbor's legacy remains
## Alums recall day of 'infamy' 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Setsuo Dairiki remembers the morning of Dec. 7,
1941, as being "very quiet" — until he heard a radio
announcement that Japanese forces had attacked a
U.S. naval base in a place called Pearl Harbor.
"I guess we were all lounging around, but it sure
came as a big shock to everybody," the 1942 Stan
ford graduate said. "It came so suddenly that hardly
anybody expected anything like that. We were all
glued to the radio."
Marvin Greene, Class of '47, said, "I was thumb
ing a ride down Palm Drive to Palo Alto to get some
thing to eat" when news of the attack came over a
car radio. "No one knew where Pearl Harbor was. I
said 'Where's Pearl Harbor and who bombed it?' "
"I heard it on the radio as I was studying" during
dead week, said Marcia Good, Class of '45. "I got up
and ran out in the hall, and other people were
already there. ... It was unbelievable. I think I was
pretty naive at the time about world affairs."
Fifty years ago Saturday, Japanese bombers led a
sneak dawn raid on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Har-
bor in Hawaii. The attack brought
the United States into World War
II and drew reactions of shock and
anger from around the country.
Charles Bull, then editor of
The Daily, said there were fears
that the next Japanese attack
would strike closer to Stanford,
especially after reported subma
rine sightings off the coast.
"There was stuff coming in [on
the Associated Press wire] about
the possibility of bombing attacks
against the Pacific coast, and peo
ple got scared pretty damn quick
ly," he said.
The attack changed many
facets of campus life, according to
students attending the University
at the time. A special "defense
extra" tabloid issue of The Daily,
published Dec. 11, 1941, urged
each student to "become a 'saver.'
Collect string, paper, rags, tin
foil." The issue also stressed the
importance of frugal use of gaso
line and the telephone, and said
female students should "knit like
mad."
"Before the war, it was consid
ered proper dress for a woman to
wear silk stockings on the Quad.
And if they didn't, they were
improperly dressed," Greene said.
But once the war — and rationing

— began, silk stockings were sel
dom seen, he added.
According to Greene, the
attack led many male Stanford
students to consider military ser
vice. "Everybody was really gung
ho," he said. "Many of us joined
the Enlisted Reserve Corps. A
large portion of the male students
on campus enlisted in the ERC
were called up on April 5, 1943,
and the campus was just desert
ed."
Although female students gen
erally did not enlist in the mili
tary, they were asked to support
the war effort in many ways,
including rationing, Good said.
"In the springtime, they asked
everyone who could to come and
pick vegetables in the field," she
added.
Bull said, "One of the earliest
and major defense jobs was the
erection of submarine nets" made
of heavy chain across San Fran
cisco Bay in an effort to protect
the area.
Dan Oishi, Class of *42, was
president of the Japanese Student
Association of Stanford at the
time. He said there was little or no
overt hostility toward Japanese-
American students on campus.
However, all Japanese-Ameri
can students were ordered into
internment camps by the govern
ment.
"We all went directly from
school to the internment camps,"

he said. "It must have been about
May. A lot of us were seniors, and
we had to take our finals at the
camps. Our diplomas were mailed
to us there."
The attack changed student
attitudes as well as student rou
tines. "I think there was a fair
amount of bitterness among the
general population around the
school, because (the attack] was
all pre-planned," Bull said.
Bull said the attack on Pearl
Harbor should teach us to be cau
tious in world affairs. "The whole
situation today is totally differ
ent. I think that today we are
really much more trusting," he
said.
"I don't know what is learned
from an attack," Greene said. "I
certainly think it changed the
course of the U.S. It took the
country out of isolation."
Good said, "I think keeping
[the United States] safe," is the
lesson to be learned. "I think
being prepared. That's important.
It was a terrible thing."
