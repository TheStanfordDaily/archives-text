# Employees plan to grill University on benefits
## 
### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
Members of Stanford Employees for
Equity plan to attend a town meeting
on recent staff health-benefits changes
today "in full force" with a detailed list
of questions for administrators,
according to spokesperson Glenn Pea
cock.
Vice President for Human
Resources Barbara Butterfield sent a
letter Nov. 22 to all University employ
ees responding to outcry over the new
benefits system and announcing
today's town meeting to discuss the
issue.
In the letter, the University
promised to "step back and take
another look" before implementing
the program, but some employees say
they are not convinced that changes
will be made.
Over a month ago, the University
announced that beginning next
March, single employees will pay part

of the monthly cost of their health
benefits, while payments for married
employees will be reduced.
At a meeting yesterday, members of
the employees group drafted a list of
questions for administrators to answer
at today's town meeting. Staff from
the Office of Human Resources and
members of the University Committee
on Faculty/Staff benefits will be in
attendance.
"We're skeptical," said Peacock, the
MedNet Network Manager at the Med
ical School. "The University has said it
will get more input from a more
diverse part of the community, and
that's great. But whether or not they
will actually listen to that input, who
knows?"
Billed as part of the solution to the
budget problem, the new plan aims to
reduce the cost of benefits by eliminat
ing coverage of employees who are also
covered under a spouse's plan, and by
creating competition among the orga
nizations that offer coverage through

the University.
According to a copy of the questions
made available to the press and to But
terfield yesterday, group members
plan to question the basic assumptions
underlying the proposed changes.
The group plans to ask administra
tors for:
• Information supporting Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy's state
ment that the present benefits are
"over-generous" and "unreasonably
favorable to single subscribers";
• Numerical proof that the new ben
efits plan will save the University
money by screening out staff members
who are double-covered by a spouse's
health policy;
• An explanation of how members
will be chosen for a proposed "broadly
representative" group that will "exam
ine alternatives for one-party sub
scribers"; and
• Assurances that decisions like the
ones on staff benefits will include con
sultation from staff advisory groups.

"The town meeting could be pro
ductive," he said. "Hopefully Ithe Uni
versity! will meet our needs."
But Peacock said his group is wary.
"We don't want the meeting to be a
forum where the University just talks
down to us and explains that they
think the changes are right."
Rather, he said, he hopes the Uni
versity will present actions that can be
taken "to fix the problem."
"We're not ready to declare this a
victory and walk away," he said. "We
have something of a wait-and-see atti
tude at this point."
Accusations that the new plan
favors traditional married family
lifestyles arose immediately after the
changes were announced. The contro
versy peaked two weeks ago when
Stanford Employees for Equity deliv
ered an ultimatum to the University
calling for a delay in the implementa
tion of the new plan.
Butterfield could not be reached for
comment.
