URGENT MEDICAL PROBLEM?
COWELL CAN SAVE YOU
MONEY!
Visits to the Stanford Emergency
Department by students are not covered by
Cowell. Insurance will often pay only after
the deductible ($2OO for Stanford's plan) has
been satisfied, and only up to 80% of the
total (again, Stanford's plan).
During the weekday 9-5 hours Cowell is
open for regular care.
"After hours", urgent care is available at
Cowell for students (5-1 lpm weekdays,
7am-1 lpm weekends). Nurses are present,
and a doctor is called in when necessary.
Many of the ED visits represent problems
which can be easily handled at Cowell:
colds, sprains, urinary infections, bruises,
abrasions, lacerations, conjunctivitis, etc.
Thus, Cowell can handle many of the
problems for which students have sought
ED care, and at no charge to the student.
