# Edmonds chosen as VP for student resources
## Despite committee leak, student choice honored 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
Mary Edmonds, a Bowling Green State
University administrator, was chosen last
week over Stanford veteran Sally Mahoney to
serve as vice president for student resources,
following a rocky selection process in which
members of a student advisory panel leaked
their support of Edmonds to The Daily.
The vice president for student resources,
who ranks below the provost and president,
oversees many important University func
tions ranging from admissions to Residen
tial Education. The student resources unit
has an annual budget of $25 million.
Mahoney, who was formerly the Univer
sity's registrar, has been the vice president
on an acting basis since administrators cre
ated the position in 1990 as part of Stan
ford's bureaucratic restructuring program.
She has not announced her future plans and
was unavailable for comment yesterday.
Edmonds officially begins her new job
March 1, but has already begun meeting
with the student resources administrative
staff to smooth the transition and will be

closely involved in the current round of
budget cuts affecting her new office.
"I'm surrounded by mounds of paper
already," she said in a phone interview
from her Ohio home.
She said that in addition to meeting bud
get-reduction targets, her first months on
the job will be spent "getting to know
everybody. My style is to find out what
everyone is thinking and how we can work
together to accomplish our goals."
Edmonds stressed she puts students
high on her list of advisers. "I certainly will
be soliciting student input — what stu
dents are thinking and needing."
In her current position as vice president
for student affairs at Bowling Green,
Edmonds has been responsible for a budget
of $17.5 million and managed a staff of 200.
Members of the four-person student advi
sory group charged with making a recom
mendation to the search committee told The
Daily in November they thought Edmonds
was best for the position because of her non
bureaucratic, personable approach.
The public revelations by the
students of their preference for
Edmonds sent University officials
into a fury since the recommenda
tions of the advisory committee
were expected to be kept confi
dential.
"In chairing the committee, I
did my best to set that aside and
not pay any attention to it and to
try to insulate the committee
from the impact of the publicity,"
Provost James Rosse said. "We
wanted advice. We didn't want
publicity," he added.
Rosse said that often candi
dates will withdraw their applica
tions from searches if there are
leaks. "We were lucky this time."
News of Edwards' appoint
ment was met with enthusiam by
administrators whose jobs will
fall under her supervision.
"I am very excited," said Dean
of Students Michael Jackson. "I
look forward to working with
her." He said their two offices will
work very closely together in set
ting policy.
Since the administrative reor
ganization of the student re
sources unit, Jackson has report-

Ed directly to Mahoney, rather
than to University President
Donald Kennedy. He will now
report to Edmonds, but said that
he will "still work closely with
President Kennedy on some
things."
Jackson added that Mahoney's
25 years at Stanford should not
be forgotten in the rush to wel
come Edmonds. "I want to thank
Sally Mahoney for all that she has
done in helping to pull together
the student resources area. The
institution owes her a real debt of
gratitude."
Edmonds will become the
highest ranking black woman
administrator in the University.
She will be one of three women in
the University Cabinet, joining
Vice President for Human
Resources Barbara Butterfield
and Vice President for Adminis
trative Resources Susan Schaffer.
Before being named vice presi
dent at Bowling Green in 1983,
Edmonds was dean of the univer
sity's College of Health and Com
munity Services.
She also chaired the Depart
ment of Health Services at Cleve
land State University from 1976
to 1981 and was director of the
Physical Therapy Program there
from 1972 to 1981. She has been a
physical therapist since 1954.

25 years at Stanford should not
be forgotten in the rush to wel
come Edmonds. "I want to thank
Sally Mahoney for all that she has
done in helping to pull together
the student resources area. The
institution owes her a real debt of
gratitude."
Edmonds will become the
highest ranking black woman
administrator in the University.
She will be one of three women in
the University Cabinet, joining
Vice President for Human
Resources Barbara Butterfield
and Vice President for Adminis
trative Resources Susan Schaffer.

Edmonds was dean of the univer
sity's College of Health and Com
munity Services.

ment of Health Services at Cleve
land State University from 1976
to 1981 and was director of the
Physical Therapy Program there
from 1972 to 1981. She has been a
