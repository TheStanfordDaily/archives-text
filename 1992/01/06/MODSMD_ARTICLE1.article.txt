# Edmonds chosen as VP for student resources
## Despite committee leak, student choice honored 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
Mary Edmonds, a Bowling Green State
University administrator, was chosen last
week over Stanford veteran Sally Mahoney to
serve as vice president for student resources,
following a rocky selection process in which
members of a student advisory panel leaked
their support of Edmonds to The Daily.
The vice president for student resources,
who ranks below the provost and president,
oversees many important University func
tions ranging from admissions to Residen
tial Education. The student resources unit
has an annual budget of $25 million.
Mahoney, who was formerly the Univer
sity's registrar, has been the vice president
on an acting basis since administrators cre
ated the position in 1990 as part of Stan
ford's bureaucratic restructuring program.
She has not announced her future plans and
was unavailable for comment yesterday.
Edmonds officially begins her new job
March 1, but has already begun meeting
with the student resources administrative
staff to smooth the transition and will be

closely involved in the current round of
budget cuts affecting her new office.
"I'm surrounded by mounds of paper
already," she said in a phone interview
from her Ohio home.
She said that in addition to meeting bud
get-reduction targets, her first months on
the job will be spent "getting to know
everybody. My style is to find out what
everyone is thinking and how we can work
together to accomplish our goals."
Edmonds stressed she puts students
high on her list of advisers. "I certainly will
be soliciting student input â€” what stu
dents are thinking and needing."
In her current position as vice president
for student affairs at Bowling Green,
Edmonds has been responsible for a budget
of $17.5 million and managed a staff of 200.
Members of the four-person student advi
sory group charged with making a recom
mendation to the search committee told The
Daily in November they thought Edmonds
was best for the position because of her non
bureaucratic, personable approach.
