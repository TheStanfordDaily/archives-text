Injury in Escondido fire
Graduate student Morgan March
banks was cooking in her Escondido Vil
lage apartment on Dec. 15 when a skillet
filled with oil caught on fire. In an
attempt to extinguish the flames,
Marchbanks spilled the grease on her
feet, sustaining severe burns and start
ing a small fire.
Graduate student Bruce Wallace,
Marchbanks' neighbor, recalled hearing
Marchbanks shrieking "Fire! Please
help me" over and over again.
Wallace said his wife assisted the
woman while he called 911. He then
removed the skillet from the burning
oven and extinguished the blaze, which
was beginning to creep up the walls, by
holding a wet blanket over the oven
door, he said.
The Palo Alto Fire Department
arrived in a few minutes and set up fans
to clear out the remaining smoke, Wal
lace said.
Marchbanks was brought to Stanford
Hospital where she was treated for sec
ond-degree burns.
Stanford police and firefighters who
responded to the call were not available
for comment this weekend.

Hoover economist dies

Former basketball star dies
Howard Dallmar, one of the greatest
basketball stars to ever wear a Stanford
uniform, died in his sleep in his Menlo
Park home last month.
Dallmar gained stardom at Stanford
by leading the then-Indians to the 1942
NCAA title.
Known as one of the most powerful
rebounding forwards in the history of the
game, Dallmar went on to a two-year
stint with the Philadelphia Warriors. He
was named all-league in 1949 after lead
ing the NBA in assists.
He then coached at the University of
Pennsylvania, and later accepted a head
coaching position with Stanford.
Dallmar's Stanford teams won one
league co-championship and finished sec
ond six times.
"Dallmar was a great gentleman and
educator," said Stanford athletic director
Ted Iceland. "He helped establish the ath
letic and academic values that are so impor
tant to the Stanford program today."
Dallmar was 69 when he died. A
scholarship fund has been established in
his name, and his family requests dona
tions be directed to the Howie Dallmar
Memorial Scholarship Fund.
