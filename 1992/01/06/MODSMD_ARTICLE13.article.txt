## Reporting a century 
### 
The Daily s commitment
to truth more important
than individuals' feelings

YOU'RE HOLDING HISTORY
in your hand.
A century ago this quarter,
The Stanford Daily — then The
Daily Palo Alto — was born to stu
dents who understood and
believed in a newspaper's mission
to serve the truth.
The mission is the same, but some
things have changed over the years.
We're no longer housed in the
"Daily Shack." We're fully comput
erized. And more important, we're
independent of the University and
the ASSU, financially and editorially.
What you read is what we think
is important, not what they might
want you to hear.
We take seriously our responsi
bility to seek the truth intelligently,
objectively, accurately and fairly.
At times, particularly over
intensely personal issues such as
rape and suicide, our decisions are
questioned, by ourselves and by
our readers.
The scrutiny, though welcome,
is painful, and often frustrating.
I have been asked, by intelligent,
well-meaning but short-sighted
people why The Daily doesn't strive
to be a community newspaper — in
other words, a feel-good, family
style publication.
Rather than being a nice news
paper, The Daily is a good newspa
per, in which information is more
important than personal interests.
Sometimes, the truth hurts
individuals. But the public's right
to know is only meaningful when
journalists fulfill their obligation
to seek the truth.
Silence, fear's handmaiden, is
anathema to reporters. It is our
business to learn other people's
secrets when such information
affects this community Reporters,
who often have to fight for the
smallest scraps of truth, know the

value of information and discussion.
People who never have to strug
gle for information take it for
granted, and are quick to trade in
their right to know for temporary
protection of personal interests.
Those who supported tighter
control over the media during the
Gulf Warcome to mind as a partic
ularly grating example.
And locally, so do critics of our
Nov. 5 story that revealed that the
student committee did not recom
mend Sally Mahoney, then acting
vice president for student resources,
for the permanent position. In that
instance, the selection process and
the student voice were more impor
tant to reveal than Mahoney's feel
ings were to protect.
Good journalists know that the
public's need to be informed out
weighs the risk of enraging individ
uals.
It is often difficult for students to
trade in school pride for objectivity,
and even skepticism, when they
join the Daily staff. In time, though,
school pride matures into love for a
flawed institution that can be
improved with open discussion, or
at least the pressure of scrutiny.
Thomas Storke, Class of '98,
donated funds for the building
that houses The Daily His words
sum up the staffs commitment to
the community:
"Keep the news clean and fair.
Play no favorites; never mix busi
ness with editorial policy.
Do not let the news columns reflect
editorial comment.
Publish the news that is public
property without fear or favor of
friend or foe.
Accept no charity and ask no favors.
Give 'value received' for every dollar
you take in.
Make the paper show a profit if you
can, but above profit, keep it clean,
fearless and fair."
As we step into our second cen
tury, we invite you to walk with
us. Write letters when you have a
bone to pick. Join the staff if you'd
like. Most important, read The
Daily, every day Stanford will be a
better place for it.
