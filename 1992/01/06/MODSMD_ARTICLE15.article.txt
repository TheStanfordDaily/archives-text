## Touchy-feely, kissy-kissy 
### 
Before classes start, while
you still have some free time, go to
the library and check out the article
on religion and science in the Dec. 23 issue
of U.S. News and World Report. The article
was about science and religion's conflicting
views of our origins and nature, and how
the members of these two communities
bridge the gaps that separate them. But
this was not the interesting part.
You can only read so many quotes
from popes and Nobel laureates extolling
the wise lessons science and religion can
teach each other. After the fourth or fifth
platitude it is time to trade U.S. News for
People's annual Top 25 issue. The story
of Julia Robert's love life is a much juici
er read than a tale of ministers and
molecular biologists making kissy-kissy.
So why do 1 recommend it? The article
was interesting because it championed a
viewpoint which I will call touchy-feely tol
erance. Adherents of this school of thought
believe that in any conflict or argument, the
truth surely lies somewhere in the middle
of the debate, where it combines the best
aspects of both sides. Its goal is not really
the understanding of truth, but of reconcil
iation.
The writers of the article bemoan the
fact that the "conflict between religious
and scientific explanat ions of creation has
left a centuries-old legacy of suspicion and
outright acrimony that in modern times
has erupted in open warfare in the

nation's courtrooms and classrooms."
The subtext here is that the issues the
debaters discuss are much less important
than ending the debate altogether. The
writers report the results of a poll which
classifies Americans into one of three
groups: strict creationists, centrists or nat
uralists. Take one guess as to which group
represents the reasonable view.
Offending others is the mortal sin of
the touchy-feely tolerators. Those who
hold strong opinions about an issue are
considered radicals and extremists. They
are dangerous rabble- rousers willing to
go to war, at least at school board meet
ings, to defend their beliefs.
But debating whether science or cre
ationism should be taught in the public
school systems hardly seems equivalent
to open warfare.
Are we all so sensitive that we cannot
voice strong opinions about important
issues without being labeled as rude and
intolerant?
Tolerance of thought is one of the great
achievements of Western liberalism. The
real war between science and religion has
been fought over this point, with science
demanding that it not be forced to follow
religious dogma.
But tolerance does not mean that you
have to agree with everybody.
When the topics at hand are human
nature, morality and the origins of the
universe, whv in the world should the

average of all available opinions be
extolled as the truth?
These questions are so important and
yet we shy away from debating them in the
fear that we will offend our friends with our
opinions. Shying away from debates is a
terrible habit in a democracy. You offer up
all your power onto the Altar of Niceness. It
also makes for boring dinner parties.
We can get away with our touchy-feely
tolerance when the topic is religion in
America because here our religious
beliefs do not guide our daily lives. We
keep these beliefs at home and in church.
Capitalism and liberalism rule the public
world. If we don't debate beliefs which
are confined to our private lives, we don't
immediately pay too heavy a price.
But there are other topics besides reli
gion and science. Imagine that this US
News article began with the line, "The
conflict between dictatorship and democ
racy has left a centuries-old legacy of sus
picion and outright acrimony." Would
the article end with the hope that both
sides would calm down and compromise
on, perhaps, oligarchy?
