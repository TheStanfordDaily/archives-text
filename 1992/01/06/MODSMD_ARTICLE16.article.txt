Drama department crucial to future of social change

I CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT I am
hearing. I have always taken great
pride in my Stanford degree. Now
the Board of Trustees wants to cut the
entire drama department! The trustees
must recognize they would not only be
depriving future Stanford students, but
the community as well.
It is a misconception that somehow
drama is an extra. Having the opportu
nity to see theater on campus is integral
to the other branches of the humanities.
By ousting the drama department, Stan
ford would also strip members of the art
and music departments of invaluable
experience in their fields. How often do
students get to enlarge a painting to full
stage size or to compose someone else's
ideas into something of their own?
Along the same lines, a great many

people who work in the drama depart
ment utilize that experience even if they
do no intend to go into theater. People I
meet are continually amazed I know
people with such a variety of careers —
doctors, lawyers, engineers — and I met
them in the drama department.
The trustees are proposing to dismantle
a very well-respected program. When I
returned to school for my Master of Fine
Arts in Directing, I discovered that my the
ater background was far superior to virtu
ally everyone else's in the MFA programs.
People were repeatedly stunned by the play
analysis of which I was capable (courtesy of
Eleanor Prosser among others).
What kind of example is being set for
the drama departments of the country?
The minute a university with the size and
reputation of Stanford disbands its drama

department to cut costs — especially
when it is well-known that costs must be
cut for reasons outside the drama depart
ment — a message is sent. Smaller
schools will decide that if Stanford cuts its
drama department, they can do the same.
This is not pessimism, it is reality.
What does theater give people that
they will spend money for, even in tough
economic times? Hope for better times
and for the chance to fulfill dreams. And
how about escape? When life is bad, we
all need an outlet, and escape hatch to
take our minds away for a few hours.
And societal change. People may not
intend to see and understand someone
else's point of view when they go to the
theater, but that is often what happens.
From Athol Fugard in South Africa to
Lorca and the Greeks, even Shakespeare

showed people what the world was like,
and often how to improve it.
I leave you with a quote from Presi
dent John F. Kennedy: "I look forward
to an America which will not be afraid of
grace and beauty. I look forward to an
America which will reward achieyement
in the arts as we reward achievement in
business or statecraft, and I look for
ward to an America which commands
respect throughout the world not only
for its strength, but for it civilization as
well. And I am certain that after the
dust of centuries has passed over our
cities, we, too, will be remembered, not
for victory or defeat in battle or in poli
tics, but for our contribution to the
human spirit."
