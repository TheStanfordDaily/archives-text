# National Association of Scholars â€” a smoke screen for intolerance
## 
### 
At the end of last quarter, on the same
day that The Daily reported the convening
of a Stanford chapter of the National Asso
ciation of Scholars, the Associated Press
reported the alarm of black and Jewish
educators over the growing acceptability of
racial intolerance on American college
campuses. "Bigotry has come out into the
open," observed the Associate Dean of the
Simon Wiosenthal Center. "Using code
words like 'freedom of expression,' they're
trying to but their way into legitimacy."
These concerns were occasioned by a
full page ad calling for "open debate of the
Holocaust" that appeared this fall in the
student newspapers at Cornell, Duke,
Northwestern and the University of
Michigan. They are heightened by the
celebrity of ex-Klansman David Duke in
Louisiana (defeated, the pollsters tell us,

because of fears that he would damage the
state's business climate!); by the
lamentable popularity of Dinesh
D'Souza's tirade against the liberal acade
my; and by the tempered rhetoric of the
National Association of Scholars, which
claims to represent the voice of embattled
reason against the tide of "politically cor
rect" thinking that has allegedly swept
across the academic landscape.
To the local sympathizers of the
National Association of Scholars I would
say: If you are sincere in your desire to
protect our freedoms, then you are on
the wrong side. You do not belong on a
continuum that includes the Ku Klux
Klan and the Committee for Open Dis
cussion of the Holocaust.
The true enemies of an open and demo
cratic university are not programs that
seek to redress the demons we have inher
ited from our past, but those who cynicaj
ly appeal to democratic principles in their
campaign to perpetuate those demons.
