# Citizens should thank Teller, admit their mistaken conceptions
## 
### 
Your recent piece depicting Edward
Teller as a cold warrior disoriented by
the end of the cold war made about as
much sense as would a book about
George Marshall depicting him as robbed
of his mission in life by the allied victory
over the axis powers in World War 11.
Teller stands for the view that the
free world confronted an evil, menacing
Soviet empire, and that victory by this
empire in the technological race for mili
tary superiority would have been a disas
ter for the free world. This view has
been as vindicated by history as any
political judgment can be.
Therefore, anyone with a brain in his
or her head should turn to Teller and say:
"Sir, I admire you. I'm grateful to you.
Those of us who criticized, ridiculed and
hated you over the years were wrong."

There's nothing so terrible about being
wrong sometimes. I'm sure Teller has
been wrong a fair number of times.
What's wrong and depressing is an
intellectual too dishonest or stupid to
know when he or she has been wrong
and too small-minded to admit it.
What's hilarious — yet still depressing
— is the intellectual who not only is too
small-minded to admit a mistake also
tries to cover up the mistake by patron
izing the person who was right. At that
point we are dealing with a shameless
person who says:"The hell with the
Socratic tradition of intellectual hon
esty." But then I forgot, Socrates was a
white male whose opinions no longer are
on the required reading list at Stanford.
