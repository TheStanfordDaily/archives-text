# Feds ring up $230 million indirect-cost overcharge
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Defense Department auditors have con
cluded that Stanford may have over
charged the government by $230 million in
indirect costs between 1980 and 1988,
according to a study released Friday.
A congressional investigator with the
House Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations estimated that the total fig
ure could reach $310 million when the
Defense Contract Audit Agency concludes
its examination of Stanford's records from
the past three years — the first complete
studv since 1980.

But University officials emphasized that
the findings are only advisory. The Office
of Naval Research is ultimately responsible
for negotiating indirect-cost recovery rates
with Stanford and will decide how to treat
the findings of the audit.
The agency's study assumed that thr
more than 100 memoranda of understand
ing between Stanford and the federal gov
ernment were retroactively canceled for
the last decade. The MOUs were the con
tracts that established how Stanford would
be reimbursed for indirect costs.
"We knew that if thev did not audit
according to the contracts, we
would get this aberration," said
Larry Horton, associate vice pres
ident for public affairs. "This
audit puts Stanford's (indirect
cost recovery) rate substantially
below any university of compara
ble quality and size."
The study apparently conclud
ed that Stanford had overbilled
the government because the Uni
versity could not provide docu
ments substantiating many of the
charges. But Horton said some of
the "progressive" MOUs signed in
the mid-1980s were designed to
allow Stanford to keep fewer
records and reduce the adminis
trative costs to the government.
The congressional investigator
acknowledged that because of the
MOUs, the University was not
required to maintain extensive
billing records.
"Because the DCAA audit did
not recognize the MOUs and
Stanford did not have the neces

sary billing records to substanti
ate the costs, the study concluded
that Stanford owes about $230
million for fiscal years 1981
through 1988," he said.
The University has already
appealed the retroactive cancela
tion of the MOUs for fiscal year
1991 to the Armed Services Board
of Contract Appeals. Stanford's
indirect-cost recovery rate was
reduced to 55.5 percent by the
Office of Naval Research last
April, costing the University more
than $20 million per year.
Although Horton would not
speculate on possible legal
actions, it is likely that the Uni
versity would fight any retroac
tive cancelation of the MOUs for
the 1980s either with the appeals
board or in federal court.
"The MOUs represent binding
agreements, and it is not permis
sible for one party to cancel them
10 years later," Horton said.
But Paul Biddle, the on-cam
pus representative for the Office
of Naval Research, has argued the
agreements are invalid due to the
"cozy" nature of the relationship
between the University and previ

ous Navy negotiators, all of whom
were either demoted or forced to
retire.
The Office of Naval Research
was responsible for overseeing the
indirect-cost recovery practices at
Stanford and several other uni
versities. At last March's congres
sional hearing, the subcommittee
chair Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
criticized the lack of oversight bv
the government agency.
The congressional investigator
said the validity of the MOUs will
likely be a legal issue that may not
be resolved for some time.
"It would put Stanford in an
interesting position to keep the
money based upon legal technical
ities because a couple of bureau
crats did not do their jobs," he
said. "Stanford may win the bat
tle but lose the war."
Although they are only adviso
ry, the agency's findings match
Biddle's claims of the magnitude
of Stanford's alleged indirect-cost
overcharges — at least for now.
"When Biddle suggested that
Stanford had overcharged the
government by $200 million,
everyone scoffed at it,"the con

gressional investigator said. "But
now people are starting to get an
idea of what his numbers were
based on, and the dollar figure is
staggering.
"Biddle underestimated the
actual problem," he added.
In a brief written statement
Friday, Chief Financial Officer
Peter Van Etten said the Univer
sity would prepare "detailed docu
mentation on factual errors and
misinterpretations by DCAA."
The study was released only
days after a statement from Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
and James Gaither, president of
the Board of Trustees, defending
the MOUs while acknowledging
that government auditors might
ignore them in their studies.
"We are concerned that the
government auditors may be dis
regarding the MOUs and that, as
a consequence, auditors' findings
could allege that Stanford was
overpaid during the 1980s by sev
eral hundred million dollars," the
statement said. "We believe the
MOUs are binding contracts and
that such audit findings would be
incorrect."

The statement will appear in
the upcoming issue of the Stan
ford Observer, a bimonthly maga
zine distributed to all alumni.
Meanwhile, the House Sub
committee has announced a new
date for its next hearing on indi
rect costs — Jan. 30. The hearing,
which had originally been sched
uled for Dec. 12, will allow offi
cials from the Office of Naval
Research and from the Depart
ment of Health and Human Ser
vices to update the investigation.
Although the situation at Stan
ford will be discussed, the subcom
mittee is likely to focus on many of
the other schools hit by revela
tions.
The subcommittee is not
expected to call on any university
officials to testify.
Stanford also renewed its
objection to the conflict of interest
presented by Biddle's qui torn suit
against Stanford by filing another
appeal to the government. A qui
tarn suit allows a person to sue a
government contractor for
defrauding the government and
collect up to 30 percent of the
damages.
