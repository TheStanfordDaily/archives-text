### George Malone Staff writer 
This wasn't how it was supposed to
end for the Stanford women's volleyball
team. A magical season where every
thing had gone right suddenly ended in
one match where everything went
wrong.

West Regional final

Bruins defeat Cardinal
15-2, 15-12, 16-14

UCLA ended the Cardinal's champi
onship dreams with a stunning 15-2,
15-12, 16-14 win in the final of the West
Regional at Maples Pavilion on Dec. 13.
Instead of Stanford continuing on to
win its first NCAA women's volleyball
title, the Bruins rolled to their second
consecutive championship the next
weekend, defeating Ohio State and then
Long Beach State in the finals. The Car
dinal players were left shocked and
wondering what happened to their
dream season.
"We finally thought we got rid of (the
UCLA jinx], but. . . ." senior Nicole
Appleman's voice trailed off in disap
pointment.
Stanford, the top-ranked team in the
country for most of the season and the
No. 1 seed in the tournament, entered
the match with high expectations. The
Cardinal was coming off a thrilling, five
game, come-from-behind win over a
tough USC squad in the West Regional
semifinal and an easy victory over the
University of Rhode Island in the tour
nament's opening round.
But the regional final belonged to
UCLA. The Bruins jumped all over
Stanford in the first game, using great
passing, tremendous serving, and rock
solid blocking to shut down Stanford's
potent offense throughout the match.
UCLA ran out to a 6-0 lead and never
let up.
"Emotionally we were pretty ready to
play but [UCLA| set the tone early
when they served us out of the first
game," said a subdued Stanford coach
Don Shaw.

The Bruins looked like an entirely
different team from the squad that the
Cardinal crushed Nov. 15 at Maples.
"We went out and put together our
best performance of the year to win this
game," said Bruin head coach Andy
Banachowski.
The Cardinal regained its poise and
game two seesawed back and forth, with
hitters for both teams trading powerful
kills. With the score knotted at 12, how
ever, UCLA's defense held and the Bru
ins reeled off three quick points to win
the game and go ahead 2-0 in the match.
"When [UCLAI keeps the ball in
play. . .they're as good as any team in
the country," Shaw said. "They made
the plays when they had to and we
didn't."
Game three was filled with long ral
lies and streaks by both teams. The Bru
ins seemed to be in command as they
served strong to begin the game, rocket
ing out to a 7-1 lead. But then the Car
dinal began hitting on all cylinders, with
everyone on the court contributing, and
reeled off ten straight points. However
UCLA regrouped and hit consistently,
taking advantage of Stanford errors to
build a 14-11 lead and serve for the
match.
The Cardinal refused to quit, though.
After senior Amy Cooper went out with
a sprained ankle at 14-12, freshman
Anne Wicks took her place. At 14-13
Wicks served, and Bruin star Natalie
Williams pounded the ball off a set from
Julie Bremner for a potential kill. As the
crowd of over 4,800 held its breath,
Stanford senior Kristin Klein dug the
blistering ball and sent a perfect pass to
sophomore setter Piper Hahn. The fans
were screaming and the Maples rafters
were ringing with noise as Hahn set the
ball to junior Bev Oden, and as Oden
and the ball went up, the crowd gasped
for breath again. Then the stands erupt
ed into cheering as Oden slammed the
ball down to tie the match at 14.
But that was the last that Stanford
had to give, and it wasn't enough that
night. After a service error gave the ball
back to UCLA, the Bruins hit for a 15-
14 lead. Williams' final jump serve spun
toward the Stanford side, and redshirt
senior Jennifer Jackson seemed unde
cided as to whether the ball was heading

in or out. She pulled back her arms a
fraction of a second too late and the ball
glanced off her arms and out for the
Bruins final point.
As the UCLA squad swarmed the
court in celebration, the Cardinal play
ers could only stand in shock—their
dream was suddenly over.
Coach Shaw seemed stunned as well.
"We came up against a team that
played very well tonight," Shaw said in
a quiet voice. "They were well-prepared,
they were playing their best volleyball
when they needed to, and I have to give
UCLA a lot of credit. They did a much
better job than we did tonight."
Stanford, which had been hitting
.274 as a team for the season, was held
to a .100 hitting percentage and was led
by Klein's 10 kills and 11 digs and
Oden's 9 kills and .217 hitting percent
age. Williams had 15 kills, 13 digs, and
hit .343 while junior Elaine Youngs hit
.360 with 10 kills for the Bruins.
Just a week earlier, the Cardinal's
fortunes had looked so promising. The
team started the playoffs with a con
vincing win over an overmatched Rhode
Island squad. Stanford was in another
universe compared to the Lady Rams,
who could only muster two blocks and
hit .152 for the entire match. The Car
dinal stomped Rhode Island 15-1, 15-2,
15-11.
Klein led the way with 17 kills and a
.593 hitting percentage while Oden had
12 kills, a .579 percentage, and 5 blocks.
Appleman, Cooper, and Jackson all hit
over .350. Rhode Island was led by
senior Kengy Gardiner's 17 kills on .444
hitting.
Next Thursday in the West Regional
semifinal Stanford won a sensational
victory against a scrappy USC team,
coming back to win 12-15, 15-6, 9-15,
15-10, 15-9 in a two-and-a-half hour
match. The Cardinal rose to the occa
sion in the final two games after a slug
gish start against the Trojans.
"We were very fortunate to be the
winning team tonight," Shaw said.
"Fortunately for us we found a way to
win."

had a career match against the
Cardinal with 24 kills. USC
seemed to carry the momentum
into the fourth game. The Tro
jans went ahead 5-2, but Stanford
mounted a furious comeback with
powerful hitting by Klein, Apple
man, Oden, and junior Kristi
Faaso. As the crowd got more and
more into the game, the Cardinal
was able to come up with key
blocks and shots to get the victo
ry. The game was filled with long
rallies and clutch defensive plays
by both squads, and Stanford was
happy to come out on top.
"It was just a battle to the
end," Shaw said.
The fifth game was played
according to rally-point scoring
rules, which means that every
serve is for a point. Although the
Cardinal had only played in one
rally-scoring match previously,
the Stanford players seemed less
tentative than the Trojans during
the final game.
The crowd of 2,500 was on its
feet and was an intimidating fac
tor for most of the game, especial
ly when a group of students went
behind the USC bench to heckle
the Trojans from close range. The
Cardinal served tough and was
swinging hard at the ball, while
USC appeared to hesitate and fal

ter. Stanford won 15-9.
"Once you get cautious you get
off-track," Paaso said. "I think
coming out after pushing through
the fourth game we didn't want to
have a let-off in the fifth."
The Cardinal's victory was high
lighted by Klein's 28 kills and 17
digs, Oden's 19 kills, 14 digs, and 10
blocks, and Paaso's eight digs. Per
haps the greatest performance of
the match was turned in by Apple
man, who had 17 kills, seven digs,
eight blocks, and led the team with
a .382 hitting percentage.
"They had great performances
obviously by their top two players
and also by Nicole Appleman who
sided out for them at key times
and in key rotations," said USC
coach Lisa Love.
"Not only Kristin but Nikki
Appleman had a tremendous
night tonight too," Shaw said.
"She was bombing from the right
side which we needed desperately.
. . . And then Bev came in at the
end of the match."
No one from Stanford felt that
the Trojans would be a walkover.
"I think they're very good
defensively. . .but I expected
that," Klein said.
After the loss to UCLA, coach
Shaw said he and his team could
still hold their heads high.
"We're pretty proud of the fact
that we've been |to the NCAA
tournament) a hell of a lot more
than just about every team in the
country," Shaw said.
