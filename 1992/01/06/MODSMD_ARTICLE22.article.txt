# Georgia Tech stings Card in Aloha Bowl
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Honolulu, Hawaii — For
Stanford, the confidence that
had produced a seven-game
winning streak ended with con
fusion that helped create a loss.
Defensive miscommunication
enabled Jimmy Lincoln to run
virtually untouched into the
endzone for the two-point con
version that sealed Georgia
Tech's 18-17 Aloha Bowl win.
The 34,433 people who came
out Christmas morning joined
a national TV audience in
watching a Cardinal club that
was much different from the
team who went 8-3 during the
regular season and attained a
No. 17 national ranking.
Unable to slam the door on its
opponents as the team had
done for the last part of the sea
son, Stanford instead let the
game go down to the wire.
"I felt we played so hard and
to have it taken away on a play
we all weren't communicating
on is hard to take," linebacker
Tom Williams said. "It was a
mistake on our part, and they
capitalized on it."
With 14 seconds left in the
game Georgia Tech decided to
go for the win with a two-point
conversion attempt after scor
ing on a one-yard quarterback
keeper from Shawn Jones.
Stanford took a timeout to
decide what would be the best
way to defend the goal and pre
serve what was at that time a
one-point lead.
Cardinal head coach Denny
Green went with zone cover
age, but after Georgia Tech
came out on the field, the
coaches in the press box saw
something they didn't like and
called down for a change.
Linebacker Dave Garnett got
the signal and reversed the call
to blitz, yet the message did not
seem to get to everybody sears.
"Dave Garnett made the
change and I tried to echo it to
the rest of the team," Williams
said. "I don't think the defen
sive backs heard the whole call,
so that it appeared to be that
some of us were playing on
defense and some were playing
another."
Instead of charging the play

as he would on a blitz, corner
back Albert Richardson hung
back as if in zone coverage and
found himself flatfooted when
Lincoln approached, a situation
the freshman exploited with a
quick fake.
"Had we all been on the
same page," Williams said, "we
would have stopped the play for
a loss."
Instead, the only loss of the
day that mattered fell on the
shoulders of the Cardinal, fin
ishing the season at 8-4 and
dropping to No. 22 in the
national rankings.
"My hats off to Georgia
Tech. They played a perfect
game," Green said. "Both
teams hung in there until the
end, but they made a two-point
conversion and we didn't make
a first down and I think that's
what it's all about."
With the Stanford defense
limiting the Yellow Jackets to
three plays and punt on consec
utive possessions in the fourth
quarter, the Cardinal's 17-10
lead looked in good shape.
Stanford had the ball with 4:45
left, but with Tommy Vardell
out with a bruised collar bone
he sustained in the third quar
ter, the Cardinal was not able
to secure what seemed to be a
victory that was their's to take.
In a gutsy move Vardell
came in to get one first down,
but he was too hurt to go on.
The fifth-year senior ended the
game with 104 yards on 21
caries and was forced to watch
as Stanford failed to move the
chains and run the clock out.
Without Vardell the Cardinal
found itself coming up short,
and with 1:41 left had to punt
from the Georgia Tech 45.
"The game took a different
perspective when it was 17-10,"
Green said. "We had a lot of
opportunities to get it on — we
missed a field goal, missed
another drive late in the game
when we crossed the 50-yard
line. The game was never
under control. We could not
slam the door shut and we had
many opportunities to do that."

Paul Stonehouse, Aaron Mills
