# Women cagers edge Vols in nailbiter
## Unbeaten Stanford squad climbs to a No. 2 national ranking 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
"I hope history repeats itself."
Coach Tara VanDerveer spoke
those words after Stanford's
women's basketball team pulled
off one of the most thrilling come
from-behind victories ever
achieved by a Cardinal team in
Maples Pavilion.
If history is any indication, the
96-95 overtime win over then No.
1 Tennessee points toward a
1991-2 national crown for the
Cardinal. The winner of the Stan
ford-Tennessee regular season
match-up has gone on to claim
the NCAA title in each of the past
three years.
The heart-stopping triumph
on Dec. 14 was not the only indi
cator that the young Cardinal has
set its sights higher than you
might expect for a "rebuilding"
team.
While most students were
relaxing over the break, Stanford
was extending its unbeaten
streak and winning its own tour
nament, the Cardinal Classic.
Cardinal 100, 49ers 59
A long boniest and for Van-
Derveer's troops began on Dec. 7
against Long Beach State. By
that time Stanford was 4-0 and
had climbed from No. 7 to No. 3
in the Associated Press poll.
The 49ers, on the other hand,
had been forced to alter their
schedule and as a result were
playing their season opener in
Maples.
Christy Hedgpeth scored the
first two points of the game, en
route to a near-perfect perfor
mance — 8-of-9 from the field, 1-
of-1 from a three-point land
and 4-of-4 from the charity
stripe, for 21 points. It was a
career-high scoring night for
Hedgpeth.
After a game in which Stan
ford was rarely even forced to set
up a half-court offense, Van-
Derveer said, "This is the style of
basketball I want to see us play."
Cardinal 9<> Lady Volunteers 95
Given the intensity of this
game, the fact that no one in the
arena suffered cardiac arrest is a
miracle.
More than 5,500 fans packed
into Maples to watch not a game,
but an event. They got it.
The first half was close the

whole way, complete with eight
lead changes and a halftime score
of 39-37, Cardinal.
The second half was similarly
close for the first seven minutes.
By that time the Stanford fans
were expecting their team to go
on a run and put the game away.
But it didn't happen. Instead,
with just over 13 minutes to play,
the Vols went on a run.
After three-and-a-half min
utes, Tennessee had their largest
lead of the game at 13 points, 71-
58. Now, Stanford fans were
expecting their team to slowly
climb out of the hole of over the
next nine-and-a-half minutes.
But it didn't happen. Instead,
the game resumed its deadlock
status. With only 3:17 left on the
clock, the Vols led by 12. When
the clock read 2:25, they led by
11. The fans had almost lost
hope.
But in the next minute and 15
seconds of play, Stanford center
Val Whiting scored nine points.
And as a rocking Maples Pavilion
erupted triumphantly with mind
bending noise, Chris MacMurdo
hit a layup to tie the game at 87
with 1:10 left.
During that stretch, Ten
nessee missed the front ends of
three one-on-one free throw
opportunities, as the fan's noise
pressure practically registered on
the Terman Engineering seismo
graph. In addition, three of the
Vols' four centers fouled out dur
ing the same time period.
Neither team could score for
the remainder of regulation. The
Vols' frosh phenom Tiffany
Woosley just missed a three
pointer at the buzzer.
For most of the overtime peri
od, the teams exchanged a one
point lead back and forth. The
Vols' last center fouled out of the
game early in the period.
So it was that, with 0:27 left,
Tennessee's All-America candi
date guard Dena Head sank an
open 15-foot jumper to give the
Vols a one-point lead.
Stanford called time out with
0:14 left. The ball was inbounded
to Whiting at the top of the key.
She passed the ball to Hedgpeth.
Hedgpeth was well-guarded. She
passed back to Whiting. The
junior was also well-guarded.
With 0:04 left, Whiting shot over
he defender from 18 feet out.

Swish.
Three seconds later a Hedg
peth steal sealed and victory, as
the crowd exploded.
Whiting, who scored 11 of
Stanford's last regulation points
and five of the team's nine over
time points, had scored only two
points in the first half. She fin
ished with 26, tying a career high.
She also grabbed a game-high 14
rebounds, after only three in the
first half.
"In the first half," Whiting
said, "I wasn't posting up aggres
sively enough or strong enough. .
. . After halftime I was ready to go
out and kick butt."
Whiting also said that she man
aged to stay in the game despite
picking up some fouls early.
That was something that Ten
nessee's centers obviously did not
do. But the Vols did not seem to
be concerned until late, perhaps
relying too much on their depth,
as VanDerveer suggested.
"I can't think of a team that
deep ever in women's basketball
— period," VanDerveer said of
the Vols.
Yet against a larger, deeper
opponent, Stanford won the game
at the free throw line. The Cardi
nal made 31 of 42 attempts, as
opposed to the Vols' 17 of 28

attempts.
Cardinal 112, Lady Titans 74
Stanford opened the Cardinal
Classic with a blowout of Oral
Roberts, 112-74. For the third
game in a row the Cardinal scored
over 90 points, with Chris Mac-
Murdo leading the team with 19
points. Anita Kaplan led the team
in boards with 12.
Cardinal 82, Salukis 63
The championship game
proved a bit more competitive as
Stanford beat Southern Illinois
by 19 points. Whiting led the
team in points with 17 and
rebounds with 15. The Cardinal
cooled off from the field, hitting
43 percent. The hoopsters were
able to cash in at the charity
stripe, shooting a near-perfect 25-
of-28.
Cardinal 103, Toreras 68
In front of 2,500 fans in
Maples freshman Anita Kaplan
led Stanford to a rout of San
Diego. Kaplan scored 21 points
and pulled down 10 rebounds.
The Cardinal were ice cold from
three-point range, making only
one trey in 15 attempts.
Cardinal 86, Broncos 71
The Santa Clara Broncos stuck
close to the Cardinal until midway
through the first half, when a 15-
point Stanford run broke the
Broncos. In winning their 10th
game this season the Cardinal
women shot 61 percent, but were
held scoreless from three-point
range.

match-up has gone on to claim
the NCAA title in each of the past
three years.
The heart-stopping triumph
on Dec. 14 was not the only indi
cator that the young Cardinal has
set its sights higher than you
might expect for a "rebuilding"
team.
While most students were
relaxing over the break, Stanford
was extending its unbeaten
streak and winning its own tour
nament, the Cardinal Classic.
Cardinal 100, 49ers 59
A long boniest and for Van-
Derveer's troops began on Dec. 7
against Long Beach State. By
that time Stanford was 4-0 and
had climbed from No. 7 to No. 3
in the Associated Press poll.
The 49ers, on the other hand,
had been forced to alter their
schedule and as a result were
playing their season opener in
Maples.
Christy Hedgpeth scored the
first two points of the game, en
route to a near-perfect perfor
mance — 8-of-9 from the field, 1-
of-1 from a three-point land
and 4-of-4 from the charity
stripe, for 21 points. It was a
career-high scoring night for
Hedgpeth.
After a game in which Stan
ford was rarely even forced to set
up a half-court offense, Van-
Derveer said, "This is the style of
basketball I want to see us play."
Cardinal 9<> Lady Volunteers 95
Given the intensity of this
game, the fact that no one in the
arena suffered cardiac arrest is a
miracle.
More than 5,500 fans packed
into Maples to watch not a game,
but an event. They got it.
The first half was close the

whole way, complete with eight
lead changes and a halftime score
of 39-37, Cardinal.
The second half was similarly
close for the first seven minutes.
By that time the Stanford fans
were expecting their team to go
on a run and put the game away.
But it didn't happen. Instead,
with just over 13 minutes to play,
the Vols went on a run.
After three-and-a-half min
utes, Tennessee had their largest
lead of the game at 13 points, 71-
58. Now, Stanford fans were
expecting their team to slowly
climb out of the hole of over the
next nine-and-a-half minutes.
But it didn't happen. Instead,
the game resumed its deadlock
status. With only 3:17 left on the
clock, the Vols led by 12. When
the clock read 2:25, they led by
11. The fans had almost lost
hope.
But in the next minute and 15
seconds of play, Stanford center
Val Whiting scored nine points.
And as a rocking Maples Pavilion
erupted triumphantly with mind
bending noise, Chris MacMurdo
hit a layup to tie the game at 87
with 1:10 left.
During that stretch, Ten
nessee missed the front ends of
three one-on-one free throw
opportunities, as the fan's noise
pressure practically registered on
the Terman Engineering seismo
graph. In addition, three of the
Vols' four centers fouled out dur
ing the same time period.
Neither team could score for
the remainder of regulation. The
Vols' frosh phenom Tiffany
Woosley just missed a three
pointer at the buzzer.
For most of the overtime peri
od, the teams exchanged a one
point lead back and forth. The
Vols' last center fouled out of the
game early in the period.
So it was that, with 0:27 left,
Tennessee's All-America candi
date guard Dena Head sank an
open 15-foot jumper to give the
Vols a one-point lead.
Stanford called time out with
0:14 left. The ball was inbounded
to Whiting at the top of the key.
She passed the ball to Hedgpeth.
Hedgpeth was well-guarded. She
passed back to Whiting. The
junior was also well-guarded.
With 0:04 left, Whiting shot over
he defender from 18 feet out.

Swish.
Three seconds later a Hedg
peth steal sealed and victory, as
the crowd exploded.
Whiting, who scored 11 of
Stanford's last regulation points
and five of the team's nine over
time points, had scored only two
points in the first half. She fin
ished with 26, tying a career high.
She also grabbed a game-high 14
rebounds, after only three in the
first half.
"In the first half," Whiting
said, "I wasn't posting up aggres
sively enough or strong enough. .
. . After halftime I was ready to go
out and kick butt."
Whiting also said that she man
aged to stay in the game despite
picking up some fouls early.
That was something that Ten
nessee's centers obviously did not
do. But the Vols did not seem to
be concerned until late, perhaps
relying too much on their depth,
as VanDerveer suggested.
"I can't think of a team that
deep ever in women's basketball
— period," VanDerveer said of
the Vols.
Yet against a larger, deeper
opponent, Stanford won the game
at the free throw line. The Cardi
nal made 31 of 42 attempts, as
opposed to the Vols' 17 of 28

attempts.
Cardinal 112, Lady Titans 74
Stanford opened the Cardinal
Classic with a blowout of Oral
Roberts, 112-74. For the third
game in a row the Cardinal scored
over 90 points, with Chris Mac-
Murdo leading the team with 19
points. Anita Kaplan led the team
in boards with 12.
Cardinal 82, Salukis 63
The championship game
proved a bit more competitive as
Stanford beat Southern Illinois
by 19 points. Whiting led the
team in points with 17 and
rebounds with 15. The Cardinal
cooled off from the field, hitting
43 percent. The hoopsters were
able to cash in at the charity
stripe, shooting a near-perfect 25-
of-28.
Cardinal 103, Toreras 68
In front of 2,500 fans in
Maples freshman Anita Kaplan
led Stanford to a rout of San
Diego. Kaplan scored 21 points
and pulled down 10 rebounds.
The Cardinal were ice cold from
three-point range, making only
one trey in 15 attempts.
Cardinal 86, Broncos 71
The Santa Clara Broncos stuck
close to the Cardinal until midway
through the first half, when a 15-
point Stanford run broke the
Broncos. In winning their 10th
game this season the Cardinal
women shot 61 percent, but were
held scoreless from three-point
range.
"I hope history repeats itself."
Coach Tara VanDerveer spoke
those words after Stanford's
women's basketball team pulled
off one of the most thrilling come
from-behind victories ever
achieved by a Cardinal team in
Maples Pavilion.
If history is any indication, the
96-95 overtime win over then No.
1 Tennessee points toward a
1991-2 national crown for the
Cardinal. The winner of the Stan
ford-Tennessee regular season
match-up has gone on to claim
the NCAA title in each of the past
three years.
