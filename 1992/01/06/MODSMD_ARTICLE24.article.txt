# The 						Agony of Defeat
## Cardinal offense stalls without explosive back 
### T. C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Sometime in the third quarter of the 1991 Aloha
Bowl the engine of the Stanford seven-game win
streak express broke down and the offense sputtered
to a halt.
Tommy Vardell, the man who produced a majori
ty of the Cardinal's drive all season, suffered a col
larbone injury. Without him, the team was shut out
the rest of the game.

"We missed Tommy
obviously," understat
ed head coach Dennis
Green. "He played
something like four
plays in the second
half, maybe more, but
not much when we
needed him."
Stanford had a 17-
10 lead from Vardell's
21st and 22nd touch
downs of the season,
but then the offense
began to sputter,
putting the pressure on
the Cardinal defense.
After Georgia Tech's
initial drive in the sec
ond half, the Cardinal
defense settled down
and shut down the Yel-

low Jackets. Ron George rushed Georgia Tech quar
terback Shawn Jones into throwing an errant pass,
which lineman Tyrone Parker scooped up and thun
dered back for 17 yards. The defense continued to
hold the Yellow Jacket offense to three plays and out
until the last drive which produced the game-win
ning points.
Until the very end, it seemed the Aloha Bowl was
a game for Stanford to take. "We played hard but we
did not take them out of the game," Green said.
"The game was never under control. Seventeen
points is not a lot, especially in a bowl game.We
could not slam the door shut."
The Cardinal had many opportunities to slam the
door in the second half, but Vardell's absence cou
pled with horrendous field position helped the Tech
defense stifle the Stanford offense.
The Yellow Jackets thwarted the Cardinal's first
drive of the second half. Parker's interception gave
the offense the ball at midfield. Five plays later Tech
linebacker Eric Fry picked off a Steve Stenstrom
pass.
Stanford started the next four possessions at the
Cardinal's own four, five, one and 10 yard line. Stan
ford was unable to grind out yardage consistently.

When everyone was look
ing for answers after the
game, Miiburn softly
voiced the one that made
the most sense. 'We have
to execute when we don't
have our top players,' said
the halfback, 'and I don't
think we did that.'

Third-down plays that would have gone to Vardell
went to the air instead. On a day when Stenstrom
was not his sharpest, this spelled doom for the Car
dinal.
"Tommy Vardell does a lot for our offense. We are
a different team when he is out there," Green said.
"He is a man who is a big part of us controlling the
ball in the fourth quarter, which is what we've been
able to do when we have had success."
Control of the ball in the final stanza did indeed

dictate Stanford's suc
cess, or lack thereof.
With just under five
minutes left, Stanford
had the ball and the
seven-point lead. A sus
tained drive would kill the
clock and bring home the
victory.
Yet with Vardell out,
Green had to go with
either Glyn Milburn or
J.J. Lasley. Both running
backs had enjoyed spo
radic success during the
day, but were not the con
sistent ground gainers
the Cardinal needed.
Going with experience,
Milburn got the ball,
barely reaching the line of
scrimmage. On the next
play Milburn spurted

through the line for eight yards.
On third and two Vardell decided the pain below
his neck was not as great as the pain of losing. He
came in for a six-yard gain.
"I had to go in there on that third down in the
fourth quarter," said Vardell, who would finish the
day with 104 yards on 21 carries. "It could have
decided whether we won the game or not."
However, the first down did not do the trick.
Lasley ran over left tackle for four, but Milburn got
stuck for a yard loss. With 2:03 left the Cardinal
faced third and seven.
The Stenstrom to Walsh connection that had
worked well all year, misconnected. On the subse
quent punt the Yellow Jackets executed a 63-yard
return. They punched the ball in the endzone for the
touchdown and converted on the two-point attempt.
Green would say after the game that his team
needed a field goal, a touchdown, or a first down —
and the Cardinal got none of the above.
When everyone was looking for answers after the
game, Milburn softly voiced the one that made the
most sense. "We have to execute when we don't have
our top players," said the halfback, "and I don't
think we did that."


Only an injury to his collarbone
could keep Tommy Vardell from
once again carrying the Cardi
nal to victory. He managed to
secure one first down late in
the game as Stanford clung to a
17-10 lead, but he could do no
more, and victory slipped away.
