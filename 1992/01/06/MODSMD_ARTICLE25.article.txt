## Men's basketball team proves it is no joke with 8-1 record 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Many scoffed and most chuckled in Octo
ber when the men's basketball team was
unbelievably ranked No. 24 in Street and
Smith's preseason poll.
But with the pre-league schedule complete,
coach Mike Montgomery and his 8-1 Cardinal
are trying to suppress a triumphant giggle of
their own.
Sparked by a 74-60 lambasting of previous
ly No. 24 Virginia, Stanford tallied a surpris
ing 5-1 record during winter break.
"I'm pleased with the way we've played,
but now the price of poker goes up," Mont
gomery said. "We're learning about ourselves
and improving."
Twelfth-ranked Michigan State handed
the Cardinal its only defeat of the season 72-
62 in the championship game of the Spartan
Classic, but Stanford won easily against
Santa Clara 75-59, Siena 94-72, Southern
Utah 89-71 and Cal State-Northridge 80-59.
As expected, senior forward Adam Keefe
carried most of the load, setting career highs
with 36 points against Virginia and 21
rebounds against Southern Utah. Stanford's
all-evervthing senior is averaging 25.8 points
and 12.6 rebounds per game.
While Keefe has played up to his All-Amer
ican expectations, the development of junior
jump-shooter Peter Dukes and 6-foot-9 center
Paul Garrett has been a critically important
surprise.
Dukes, who starts at shooting guard, blos
somed during the break. During a three-game
stretch he nailed 16-of-23 three pointers (69
percent), and is shooting treys at an uncanny
60 percent clip for the year.

Garrett worked his way into the starting
lineup and complemented Keefe inside. In his
first collegiate start, Garrett scored 14 points
and grabbed 10 rebounds against Southern
Utah.
Point guard Marcus Lollie hasn't gotten
too much attention, which is good news for
Stanford. Lollie scored a career-high 14 points
against Siena, but more importantly has effi
ciently directed the Cardinal attack. When he
got into first-half foul trouble against Michi
gan State, Dukes had to play the point and
Stanford's offense stuttered.
A wrap-up of the holiday games:
Stanford 75, Santa Clara 59
Keefe went berserk at Santa Clara's Toso
Pavilion Dec. 14, scoring 30 points and grab
bing 19 rebounds against the Broncos and
soft-bodied 7-1 center Ron Reis.
"We have a program to fill out and (one
question is) who's the best player you've ever
played against. Right now there's no doubt in
my mind," said Santa Clara forward Rhea
Taylor, who led the Broncos with 25 points.
"Adam Keefe is the best player I've played
against since I've been here."
Stanford 74, Virginia 60
Ditto for Keefe. The Atlantic Coast Confer
ence challengers, who won 21 games last year,
played in the NCAA tournament and were
ranked No. 24 this year after beating George
town, could not stop Keefe.
Playing before an ESPN audience and 11
pro scouts, Keefe ran a clinic for the Cava
liers, scoring 36 points on 13-of-21 shooting.
Meanwhile, Stanford held Virginia presea
son All-American Bryant Stith to 19 points on
6-of-13, utilizing a box-and-one defense
applied vise-like by Brent Williams and Andy
Poppink.

Stanford 94, Siena 72
Stanford routed the pesky Saints in the
first round of the Spartan Classic, but the win
could not erase the measle-filled memories of
Siena's first-round upset of Stanford in the
1989 NCAA tournament. Keefe is the only
Cardinal to play on both teams.
Michigan State 72, Stanford 62
Despite a courageous comeback, Stanford
lost in front of 15,138 Michigan State fans.
After trailing by 11 at intermission, Stanford
cut the lead to 57-56 with seven minutes left.
Dukes destroyed the Spartan zone, draining
6-of-9 treys to get Stanford back in the game.
But Keefe committed a career-high 10
turnovers and Stanford couldn't convert
down the stretch, as the Spartans pulled away
in the final two minutes.
Stanford 89, Southern Utah 71
Another night of Keefe and Dukes domi
nating , as Stanford downed the tough Thun
derbirds (8-4). Keefe scored 25 points and
pulled down 21 rebounds, as Stanford blew
the game open in the first half.
Stanfoixl 80, Cal State-Northridge 59
Stanford tediously subdued the road
weary 1-12 Matadors, who wouldn't quit
despite being over-matched at every position.
"I think this game will come back to haunt
us somewhere down the road," said Keefe.
"The final score was fine, but coach wasn't
planning to play me 36 minutes in this one."
Card notes
Stanford is wearing a black stripe on its uni
forms in memory of basketball great Howie Dall
mar, who passed away Dec. 18. Dallmar coached
basketball at Stanford for 21 years and was the
Most Valuable Player of the 1942 NCAA tourna
ment, as Stanford beat Dartmouth for its only
men's basketball championship.
