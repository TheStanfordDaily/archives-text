# Continuing Studies 'explodes with excitement'
## Nontraditonal students add new dimension

Phoebe Olcott and her class
mates don't sit in lecture watch
ing the clock.
"We've debated, argued,
fought, yelled and insulted each
other. It's so exciting," said the
49-year-old Palo Alto resident
when describing the discussions
in her Continuing Studies classes.
"It's so much fun to be in a
classroom again at my age,"
Olcott added. "I was never this
enthusiastic as an undergrad."
For three years the Continuing
Studies Program has been offer
ing classes for people outside the
normal spectrum of Stanford stu
dents — ranging from recent
graduates to retired professionals.
"There has long been a feeling,
a demand in the community, to
gain access to classes," said Hoover
senior fellow Gerald Dorfman,
who teaches a Continuing Studies
course on foreign policy. Continu
ing Studies "gives people the
chance to be more involved."
Professors agree that Continu
ing Studies students are more
attentive and energetic than
many undergraduates. "I taught
at the beginning of the program
and have seen the dramatic
change," Dorfman said. "The pro
gram has just exploded with
enthusiasm and excitement.
These students are some of the
best I've ever seen."
Dorfman, who occasionally
teaches at Stanford, UC-Berkeley
and San Jose State, said, "Contin
uing Studies has a great mix of
students — accomplished people
from a variety of professions who
have experience in world affairs
and therefore add a dimension to
(he class by virtue of their experi
ence. . . . Traditional students,
however bright they may be, don't
have that."
Perhaps Dorfman was refer
ring to J. Burke Knapp, a student
in his class last quarter. Knapp
who is a retired senior vice presi
dent of the World Bank and was
involved with the American mili

tary government in Germany in
1945 — has first-hand knowledge
to supplement many classes.
Knapp said he took a political
science class because "I've closely
followed the conflicts we're now
covering — (the class) gives me
the opportunity to exchange my
ideas." He added, "I'm also here
for general personal education
and development."
Students seem to enjoy the
timeliness of the classes. Palo
Alto resident Karen Brown said
she decided to take Foreign Policy
in the New World Order after the
Soviet Coup last August.
Olcott — who took a European
Communism class the quarter
after the Merlin Wall came down
said she enjoyed the focus on
current events, which "has led me
to become a newspaper junkie."
Dorfman said, "I get a lot of
freedom to teach what I want and
when." He added, "The world is
so exciting with all the changes
going on. ... I can mold my cours
es to touch upon relevant topics."
Former English Prof. Bill Chase
developed the idea for the program
in May 1988. It opened the follow
ing fall quarter with seven courses
and 180 students; this fall there

were about 20 classes available,
and enrollment was around 700,
according to JefT Wachtel, associate
dean of the program.
"We don't try to compete with
similar programs at other col
leges," he said. "We can offer dif
ferent things. Our goal is to have
a unique assortment of classes."
The variety last fall included
subjects such as Music of Vienna,
Topics in Philosophy and Women
in Colonial America.
Some people, like Emile Pan
sky, a retired engineer and a resi
dent of Hillsborough, take classes
"for fun." Me added, "I travel too
much to be in a strict program."
Staff member Lucy Kohlmeier,
who graduated in 1984, is also a
continuing student for pure enjoy
ment. "I don't really do the read
ing or like poli sci all that much,
but the professors are incredibly
enthusiastic and make it so inter
esting and worthwhile," she said.
Stephanie Landau, another
1984 graduate, said, "Before Con
tinuing Studies, there was no way
to further my education at Stan
ford without enrolling in a day
grad program." She emphasized
that "the exposure to different
professors and departments is

tremendous."
A few classes are available off
campus at the Palo Alto Senior
Center. "Those classes aren't just
for people over 65," Wachtel said.
"They're more accessible to peo
ple who can't make it to campus
at night."
Last quarter marked the start
of the program's Master of Liber
al Arts degree. Wachtel described
the idea as "a natural progres
sion" in Continuing Studies,
adding, "There was interest on
the part of the students to have
something to work toward beyond
personal satisfaction."
Administrators describe the
degree program as "a flexible,
interdisciplinary approach to
enable adults to seek a broad edu
cation." The application process is
competitive because so many
qualified people apply. "We had to
make some tough decisions,"
Wachtel said.
Many professionals in special
ized fields such as medicine or
computer science are attracted to
the program because they "had a
taste of it (liberal arts) as under
grads but were too busy filling
major requirements," Wachtel
said.


Hoover senior fellow Gerald Dorfman lectures in his Continuing Studies course on foreign studies to non
traditional students, "accomplished people from a variety of professions who have experience in world
affairs." According to Dorfman, Continuing Studies "gives people the chance to be more involved."
