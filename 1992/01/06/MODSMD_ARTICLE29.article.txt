# Brainpan mandate: New state law requires helmets for motorcyclists
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Windblown hair may soon be just a
fond memory for many Stanford stu
dents.
California State Law now requires
drivers and passengers on motorcycles
and motorized scooters to wear safety
helmets — a regulation that met with
great opposition from motorist groups
statewide and will likely change the
habits of many Stanford students.
Motorcycles and especially scooters
are common on campus, but few stu
dents who drive scooters wear helmets
on a regular basis.
The new helmet law went into effect
Jan. 1 and will be strictly enforced on
campus, according to Stanford Police
Sgt. Tim Hanrahan. Despite the fact
that many students are not California
residents and may not be familiar with
the new state law, no grace period will
be granted on campus, he said.

Motorists should be aware of the
law, since it has been well-publicized
through the media, he said, adding
that the Special Services Unit of the
Stanford Police Department has pro
duced and distributed fliers explaining
the new law.
Sophomore Jason Cohen, who is
from New Jersey, said he had heard of
the law, but did not know it had been
passed. Cohen said that until now, he
only wore a helmet when riding on his
friend's motorcycle, but he now plans
to wear it on his scooter as well.
The strict enforcement policy on
campus mirrors the stance taken by
the California Highway Patrol. In the
past, a conditioning period of 90 days
has been allowed after the institution
of a new law, during which time offi
cers issued warnings instead of cita
tions.
The new helmet law, however, took
effect immediately, and first-time vio
lators will be cited and charged up to

$100. Additional court and processing
fees are tacked on to this amount.
Both the driver and the passenger
of a motorcycle, moped or motor scoot
er can be cited for failure to wear a hel
met. And the driver may be cited for a
helmetless passenger, even if the driv
er is wearing one, Hanrahan said.
Helmets must be approved by the
U.S. Department of Transportation,
the American National Standards
Institute or the Snell Foundation. An
acceptable helmet will carry a sticker
indicating the organization that
approved it.
Based on the experiences of other
states that have enacted universal hel
met laws, the California Highway
Patrol expects the law to save from 150
to 200 lives in 1992.
There were about 842,000 people
registered to drive motorcycles in Cali
fornia in 1990. That year, 569 people
were killed in motorcycle accidents,
and 18,578 were injured.

Sophomore Laura Gandrud and senior Dede Trimble ride carefree — sans helmets
— despite a new state law that requires drivers and passengers of motorcycles and
scooters to wear safety helmets. Campus police say they will strictly enforce the
law. Tickets for first time offenders will cost about $100.
