# The
						Rhodes to success
## Stanford scholar-athletes garner prestigious scholarship at Oxford 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
When Robert Sternfels got
the big thumbs-down from the
Stanford-in-Oxford program,
he didn't just lie down and
wallow in self-pity.
Instead, he chose to follow a
different path to the prestigious
English university. He applied
for a Rhodes scholarship.
And now Sternfels is among
three Stanford students chosen
as Rhodes Scholars for 1992.
A senior majoring in eco
nomics and history, Sternfels
and Cory Booker, Class of '91,
were among 32 Americans cho
sen for the award this year.
The other Stanford student,
senior Omphemetse Mooki,
was chosen to represent his
native country, South Africa.
The Rhodes scholarship
requires applicants to excel in
"academics, leadership, athlet
ics and the ability to fight the
world's fight," Sternfels said.
Each of the final applicants
goes through three stages of
day-long interviews, during
which academic, personal and
ethical questions are asked bv
a panel of former scholars.
Sternfels, a water polo play
er, started a business with his
roommate during the summer
because he needed to find local
employment in order to stay
on campus for workouts. The
company, Litigation Support
Services, hires out Stanford
students to summarize deposi
tions for local law firms.


Senior Omphemetse Mooki stands comfortably in his laboratory
where he is investigating the possible effects of the drug
ofloxacin on the HIV virus. He was one of the three Stanford
Rhodes Scholars chosen this year.
