# The 						Rhodes to success
## Stanford scholar-athletes garner prestigious scholarship at Oxford 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
When Robert Sternfels got
the big thumbs-down from the
Stanford-in-Oxford program,
he didn't just lie down and
wallow in self-pity.
Instead, he chose to follow a
different path to the prestigious
English university. He applied
for a Rhodes scholarship.
And now Sternfels is among
three Stanford students chosen
as Rhodes Scholars for 1992.
A senior majoring in eco
nomics and history, Sternfels
and Cory Booker, Class of '91,
were among 32 Americans cho
sen for the award this year.
The other Stanford student,
senior Omphemetse Mooki,
was chosen to represent his
native country, South Africa.
The Rhodes scholarship
requires applicants to excel in
"academics, leadership, athlet
ics and the ability to fight the
world's fight," Sternfels said.
Each of the final applicants
goes through three stages of
day-long interviews, during
which academic, personal and
ethical questions are asked bv
a panel of former scholars.
Sternfels, a water polo play
er, started a business with his
roommate during the summer
because he needed to find local
employment in order to stay
on campus for workouts. The
company, Litigation Support
Services, hires out Stanford
students to summarize deposi
tions for local law firms.


Senior Omphemetse Mooki stands comfortably in his laboratory
where he is investigating the possible effects of the drug
ofloxacin on the HIV virus. He was one of the three Stanford
Rhodes Scholars chosen this year.
Booker, like Sternfels, was a
division-one athlete, playing tight
end for the Stanford football team
during his four years here.
He said he was surprised to dis
cover he was one of the few football
players nominated for the award.
"Football enabled me to get a
Rhodes scholarship. It gave me
the discipline," he said.
Although football took up
much of his time, Booker became
heavily involved in community
service and student government,
earning himself the J. E. Wallace
Sterling award for public service
last year.
Booker, who was a senior class
president, also devoted much of
his time to the Bridge, the campus
peer-counseling center, where he
spent last year as a live-in coun
selor.
"The Bridge has been the back
bone of my college career. It gave
me an opportunity to find out

things about Stanford that I oth
erwise wouldn't have seen."
After finishing a master's in soci
ology this year, Booker will enter an
Oxford master's program in politics,
philosophy and economics, in order
to "fill in the one hole in my tran
script — economics."
Booker said he is looking for
ward to the international experi
ence the Rhodes scholarship will
afford him.
"I've never been out of the
country — well, I went to Tijuana
once when I was 10. I really have
a very Americana perspective."
Eventually, Booker, like Stern
fels, hopes to go to law school,
where he said most Rhodes schol
ars end up. Afterward, he intends
to work full time at a public ser
vice organization and then possi
bly work in the government.
"I'm no genius. I'll never claim
to be a genius. The most impor
tant thing I can do with my edu
cation is to apply it. I'll never be a
Nobel laureate physicist. I just
want to take my degree and help
people," Booker said.
Mooki, 23, a senior majoring in

microbiology and immunology,
divides his time between his stud
ies, his lab work and his member
ship in the Stanford Running
Club.
After finishing his high-school
equivalency test, Mooki left his
home in Mmabatho, South Africa,
to attend Milton Academy in
Boston for a year through a schol
arship aimed at black South
Africans established by the
preparatory school.
While he was there he complet
ed a research paper about AIDS,
which propelled him into the
research he has conducted for the
last three years at the Center for
AIDS Research at Stanford.
Of the nine South Africans
chosen to receive the scholarship,
Mooki was the only one to have
studied abroad, he said.
Working with the drug
ofloxacin and the HIV virus in the
laboratory, Mooki has helped
investigate the possible effects of
the yet-untested drug on humans.
Although in direct contact with
the virus, Mooki said fear never
deterred him from his research.

"It never scared me so much
that I'm freaked out by it. I don't
have nightmares or anything. .. .
There's always an element of risk
in this type of work. I guess
there's an element of risk in just
about everything."
After completing the Human
Biology core, Mooki decided to
major in microbiology and
immunology, a small major that
has since been discontinued.
Mooki said he will use his
scholarship to further study
microbiology, possibly using the
grant to get a doctorate in the
subject. Afterward, he said, he
will return to South Africa to
teach.
"I feel that it is important for
me personally to return to my
country," he said.
Each of the Rhodes scholars
will continue his academic and
non-academic pursuits until the
end of spring quarter, when they
will take time off before heading
to Oxford.
"I'm going to have a good time
the rest of this year," Sternfels
said.

Mooki was the only one to have
studied abroad, he said.
Working with the drug
ofloxacin and the HIV virus in the
laboratory, Mooki has helped
investigate the possible effects of
the yet-untested drug on humans.
Although in direct contact with
the virus, Mooki said fear never
deterred him from his research.

"It never scared me so much
that I'm freaked out by it. I don't
have nightmares or anything. .. .
There's always an element of risk
in this type of work. I guess
there's an element of risk in just
about everything."
After completing the Human
Biology core, Mooki decided to
major in microbiology and
immunology, a small major that
has since been discontinued.
Mooki said he will use his
scholarship to further study
microbiology, possibly using the
grant to get a doctorate in the
subject. Afterward, he said, he
will return to South Africa to
teach.
"I feel that it is important for
me personally to return to my
country," he said.
Each of the Rhodes scholars
will continue his academic and
non-academic pursuits until the
end of spring quarter, when they
will take time off before heading
to Oxford.
"I'm going to have a good time
the rest of this year," Sternfels
said.
When Robert Sternfels got
the big thumbs-down from the
Stanford-in-Oxford program,
he didn't just lie down and
wallow in self-pity.
Instead, he chose to follow a
different path to the prestigious
English university. He applied
for a Rhodes scholarship.
And now Sternfels is among
three Stanford students chosen
as Rhodes Scholars for 1992.
A senior majoring in eco
nomics and history, Sternfels
and Cory Booker, Class of '91,
were among 32 Americans cho
sen for the award this year.
The other Stanford student,
senior Omphemetse Mooki,
was chosen to represent his
native country, South Africa.
The Rhodes scholarship
requires applicants to excel in
"academics, leadership, athlet
ics and the ability to fight the
world's fight," Sternfels said.
Each of the final applicants
goes through three stages of
day-long interviews, during
which academic, personal and
ethical questions are asked bv
a panel of former scholars.
Sternfels, a water polo play
er, started a business with his
roommate during the summer
because he needed to find local
employment in order to stay
on campus for workouts. The
company, Litigation Support
Services, hires out Stanford
students to summarize deposi
tions for local law firms.


Senior Omphemetse Mooki stands comfortably in his laboratory
where he is investigating the possible effects of the drug
ofloxacin on the HIV virus. He was one of the three Stanford
Rhodes Scholars chosen this year.
Booker, like Sternfels, was a
division-one athlete, playing tight
end for the Stanford football team
during his four years here.
He said he was surprised to dis
cover he was one of the few football
players nominated for the award.
"Football enabled me to get a
Rhodes scholarship. It gave me
the discipline," he said.
Although football took up
much of his time, Booker became
heavily involved in community
service and student government,
earning himself the J. E. Wallace
Sterling award for public service
last year.
Booker, who was a senior class
president, also devoted much of
his time to the Bridge, the campus
peer-counseling center, where he
spent last year as a live-in coun
selor.
"The Bridge has been the back
bone of my college career. It gave
me an opportunity to find out

things about Stanford that I oth
erwise wouldn't have seen."
After finishing a master's in soci
ology this year, Booker will enter an
Oxford master's program in politics,
philosophy and economics, in order
to "fill in the one hole in my tran
script — economics."
Booker said he is looking for
ward to the international experi
ence the Rhodes scholarship will
afford him.
"I've never been out of the
country — well, I went to Tijuana
once when I was 10. I really have
a very Americana perspective."
Eventually, Booker, like Stern
fels, hopes to go to law school,
where he said most Rhodes schol
ars end up. Afterward, he intends
to work full time at a public ser
vice organization and then possi
bly work in the government.
"I'm no genius. I'll never claim
to be a genius. The most impor
tant thing I can do with my edu
cation is to apply it. I'll never be a
Nobel laureate physicist. I just
want to take my degree and help
people," Booker said.
Mooki, 23, a senior majoring in

microbiology and immunology,
divides his time between his stud
ies, his lab work and his member
ship in the Stanford Running
Club.
After finishing his high-school
equivalency test, Mooki left his
home in Mmabatho, South Africa,
to attend Milton Academy in
Boston for a year through a schol
arship aimed at black South
Africans established by the
preparatory school.
While he was there he complet
ed a research paper about AIDS,
which propelled him into the
research he has conducted for the
last three years at the Center for
AIDS Research at Stanford.

chosen to receive the scholarship,
Mooki was the only one to have
