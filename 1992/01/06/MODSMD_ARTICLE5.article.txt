# Thomas changes plea to guilty
## Sentence for misdemeanors expected Jan. 30 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Senior Stuart Thomas pleaded
guilty Dec. 18 to misdemeanor
charges of statutory rape and pro
viding alcohol to a minor in con
nection with a Sept. 22 incident in
Stern Hall.
Thomas changed his plea from
not guilty in return for having the
statutory rape charge reduced
from a felony to a misdemeanor.
If found guilty of the felony,
Thomas could have been sen
tenced to up to three years in jail,
while the misdemeanor carries a
maximum term of one year in jail.
Thomas is slated to be sen
tenced Jan. 30, but it is unclear

whether he will have to serve time
in jail. Santa Clara County
Deputy District Attorney Linda
Condron said thejudge "indicated
that there would be substantial
public service" and a fine, but
"did not indicate whether there
would be jail time."
Thomas will probably have to
do community service work
"maybe in the area of the crime,"
Condron said. She suggested that
work in a rape crisis center or a
similar organization might be
part of the sentence.
Condron said Superior Court
Judge Thomas Hastings reduced
the statutory rape charge because
Thomas lacked a prior record and
because the victim was only a

month away from her 18th birth
day.
"He took into consideration her
level of maturity" demonstrated
by the fact that she is a student at
Stanford, Condron said.
"We are always glad when a
defendant acknowledges respon
sibility for his crime" and the vic
tim does not have to face the
ordeal of testifying, she said.
"However, we were prepared to
try the case."
Thomas was scheduled to go to
trial Dec. 23.
The victim, a freshman who was
17 when the incident occurred, told
Stanford Police Detective Tim
Frecceri that she had intercourse
with Thomas after he gave her
alcohol in his dormitory room. She
said if she had not consumed the
alcohol Thomas gave her she would
never have had intercourse with
him, according to the police report-
She also said that Thomas did
not physically threaten her but
that she felt a "certain coercion" in
his presence, the police report .said,
Frecceri's initial conclusions
were that Thomas should be
charged with forcible and statutory
rape as well as six related charges.
However, the district attor
ney's office decided to charge
Thomas with statutory rape, a
felony, and providing alcohol to a
minor, a misdemeanor.
Thomas was scheduled to
graduate at the end of last quar
ter. But Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole has said the University
"routinely places a degree on
hold" if questions about possible
misconduct exist.
