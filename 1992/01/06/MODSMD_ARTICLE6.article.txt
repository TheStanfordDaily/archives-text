# Sexual assault policy under fire
## Offenders could face expulsion for coercion 
### Holly Hacker Editorial staff 
After 11 months of deliberation and revisions, the
University's sexual assault policy was signed last
month by University President Donald Kennedy.
But not everyone is satisfied with the final product.
David Frazee, a member of both the Rape Educa
tion Project and the Sexual Assault Task Force
which recommended the policy — called the new pol
icy "weak" and said it narrowed the range of what
constitutes sexual assault from what was intended
by the Task Force Report.
"It's a hollow response to a very solid (Task
Force) proposal," he said.
The sexual assault policy comes more than two
years after the now-defunct Task Force called for it,
and a year after a California state law was passed
requiring universities to institute policies and create
procedures to help vict ims of sexual assault.
Under the now policy, students who commit sexu
al assault could face expulsion, and staff or faculty
violators could be fired According to Kennedy, viola
tors of the policy would still face "any prosecution the

district attorney may undertake through the courts."
The policy states that " 'sexual assault' includes,
but is not limited to, rape, forced sodomy, forced oral
copulation, rape by a foreign object, sexual battery
or threat of sexual assault."
The Task Force Report called for a broader policy
on unacceptable sexual conduct, which would address
such acts as obscene phone calls that wouldn't meet
the new policy's definitions of sexual assault.
A forthcoming Univeristy package on unaccept
able sexual conduct ma\ address objectionable
behavior that does not fall under the categories of
assault or harassment, according to Doug Dupen,
deputy director of employee relations for human
resources.
The new assault policy declares that "sexual
assault bv force or coercion, including deliberate
coercion with drugs or alcohol, is absolutely unac
ceptable at Stanford University."
The last draft of the policy defined sexual assault
as including "coercion through the use of alcohol,"
but the final policv was revised to include the word
"deliberate." Several administra
tors and staff suggested the
change because they felt the orig
inal wording was vague.
Not everyone is satisfied with
the modification, however. Arnold
Beichman, a research fellow at
Hoover Institution, said he sees
problems with the inclusion of alco
hol as a means of coercion. "You
can be raped forcibly," he said, "but
can you be forced to drink?"
California state law defines
rape as an act of sexual inter
course under various circum
stances, including those where a
person is prevented from resist
ing by any intoxicating substance
administered by or with the privi
ty of the accused.
Beichman said the Universi
ty's new sexual assault policy
"really robs individuals of individ
ual responsibility," because a
woman should be responsible for
accepting or refusing a drink from
a man. "Unless someone puts a
gun to your head . . . how can you
coerce someone to drink?"
Beichman also noted that peo
ple have different levels of toler
ance for alcohol. "How are you
going to judge what is the legal
limit you can offer before you're
accused of trying to seduce?"
"I would not dare offer a girl a
drink today if that [policy] goes
into effect," he said.
Frazee challenged Beichman's
statements.
"The acceptance of a drink is
not an acceptance of sexual activ
ity. ... It doesn't matter whether
you got her drunk. Without clear
and conscious consent (of the
woman) then you're playing
dice," he said.
Kennedy prefaced the sexual
assault policy with a memoran
dum announcing his intentions to
redistribute the University's cur
rent policy on sexual harassment.
Both the sexual assault policy and
the current harassment policy
appeared in the Dec. 11 edition of
the Campus Report.
Keith Smith, a manager for the
University's human resources ser
vices, said both policies will be

printed in The Daily to better reach
students. The policies were mailed
to all staff members last month.
The policy is accompanied by a
list of resources providing emer
gency and ongoing treatment for
victims of sexual assault.
In signing the policy, Kennedy
has cleared the way for a staff
committee to develop a compre
hensive package addressing a
broad spectrum of unacceptable
sexual conduct at Stanford, from
rape to harassment. The package
will include the sexual assault
policy, the sexual harassment pol
icy and a statement from
Kennedy linking them and reaf
firming the University's position
on sexual misconduct.
The staff committee working
on this package, originally com
prised of three members, expand
ed to six and now includes Susan
Epstein, the student coordinator
of sexual assault prevention edu
cation and referral.
Other members include Dupen,
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole,
Legal Counsel Susan Hoerger,
Assoc. Urology Prof. Linda Short -
liffe and a representative from the
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment.
Kennedy has asked the com
mittee to complete a draft pack
age early this year.
Shortliffe said the committee
is in the process of writing a draft
package and hopes to have it com
pleted by its next meeting on Jan.
16.
Shortliffe is also working to
develop procedures specific to the
Medical School. She said the com
mittee needs to address how sexu
al misconduct applies to relation
ships unique to the medical
school, such as those between
patient and physician or patient
and medical student.
However, Shortliffe added,
that does not mean the medical
school has a higher incidence of
sexual misconduct than the rest
of the University. "The problem
is universal," she said.
Once the draft package is com
plete, Shortliffe said she hopes
people throughout the University
will have a chance to review and
critique it. For the package to be
good, she said, "we need input
from a lot of different people.'

accused of trying to seduce?"
"I would not dare offer a girl a
drink today if that [policy] goes
into effect," he said.
Frazee challenged Beichman's
statements.
"The acceptance of a drink is
not an acceptance of sexual activ
ity. ... It doesn't matter whether
you got her drunk. Without clear
and conscious consent (of the
woman) then you're playing
dice," he said.
Kennedy prefaced the sexual
assault policy with a memoran
dum announcing his intentions to
redistribute the University's cur
rent policy on sexual harassment.
Both the sexual assault policy and
the current harassment policy
appeared in the Dec. 11 edition of
the Campus Report.
Keith Smith, a manager for the
University's human resources ser
vices, said both policies will be

printed in The Daily to better reach
students. The policies were mailed
to all staff members last month.
The policy is accompanied by a
list of resources providing emer
gency and ongoing treatment for
victims of sexual assault.
In signing the policy, Kennedy
has cleared the way for a staff
committee to develop a compre
hensive package addressing a
broad spectrum of unacceptable
sexual conduct at Stanford, from
rape to harassment. The package
will include the sexual assault
policy, the sexual harassment pol
icy and a statement from
Kennedy linking them and reaf
firming the University's position
on sexual misconduct.
The staff committee working
on this package, originally com
prised of three members, expand
ed to six and now includes Susan
Epstein, the student coordinator
of sexual assault prevention edu
cation and referral.
Other members include Dupen,
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole,
Legal Counsel Susan Hoerger,
Assoc. Urology Prof. Linda Short -
liffe and a representative from the
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment.
Kennedy has asked the com
mittee to complete a draft pack
age early this year.
Shortliffe said the committee
is in the process of writing a draft
package and hopes to have it com
pleted by its next meeting on Jan.
16.
Shortliffe is also working to
develop procedures specific to the
Medical School. She said the com
mittee needs to address how sexu
al misconduct applies to relation
ships unique to the medical
school, such as those between
patient and physician or patient
and medical student.
However, Shortliffe added,
that does not mean the medical
school has a higher incidence of
sexual misconduct than the rest
of the University. "The problem
is universal," she said.
Once the draft package is com
plete, Shortliffe said she hopes
people throughout the University
will have a chance to review and
critique it. For the package to be
good, she said, "we need input
from a lot of different people.'
After 11 months of deliberation and revisions, the
University's sexual assault policy was signed last
month by University President Donald Kennedy.
But not everyone is satisfied with the final product.
David Frazee, a member of both the Rape Educa
tion Project and the Sexual Assault Task Force
which recommended the policy — called the new pol
icy "weak" and said it narrowed the range of what
constitutes sexual assault from what was intended
by the Task Force Report.
"It's a hollow response to a very solid (Task
Force) proposal," he said.
The sexual assault policy comes more than two
years after the now-defunct Task Force called for it,
and a year after a California state law was passed
requiring universities to institute policies and create
procedures to help vict ims of sexual assault.
Under the now policy, students who commit sexu
al assault could face expulsion, and staff or faculty
violators could be fired According to Kennedy, viola
tors of the policy would still face "any prosecution the

district attorney may undertake through the courts."
The policy states that " 'sexual assault' includes,
but is not limited to, rape, forced sodomy, forced oral
copulation, rape by a foreign object, sexual battery
or threat of sexual assault."
The Task Force Report called for a broader policy
on unacceptable sexual conduct, which would address
such acts as obscene phone calls that wouldn't meet
the new policy's definitions of sexual assault.
A forthcoming Univeristy package on unaccept
able sexual conduct ma\ address objectionable
behavior that does not fall under the categories of
assault or harassment, according to Doug Dupen,
deputy director of employee relations for human
resources.
The new assault policy declares that "sexual
assault bv force or coercion, including deliberate
coercion with drugs or alcohol, is absolutely unac
ceptable at Stanford University."
The last draft of the policy defined sexual assault
as including "coercion through the use of alcohol,"
but the final policv was revised to include the word
"deliberate." Several administra
tors and staff suggested the
change because they felt the orig
inal wording was vague.
Not everyone is satisfied with
the modification, however. Arnold
Beichman, a research fellow at
Hoover Institution, said he sees
problems with the inclusion of alco
hol as a means of coercion. "You
can be raped forcibly," he said, "but
can you be forced to drink?"
California state law defines
rape as an act of sexual inter
course under various circum
stances, including those where a
person is prevented from resist
ing by any intoxicating substance
administered by or with the privi
ty of the accused.
Beichman said the Universi
ty's new sexual assault policy
"really robs individuals of individ
ual responsibility," because a
woman should be responsible for
accepting or refusing a drink from
a man. "Unless someone puts a
gun to your head . . . how can you
coerce someone to drink?"
Beichman also noted that peo
ple have different levels of toler
ance for alcohol. "How are you
going to judge what is the legal
limit you can offer before you're
accused of trying to seduce?"
"I would not dare offer a girl a
drink today if that [policy] goes
into effect," he said.
Frazee challenged Beichman's
statements.

ity. ... It doesn't matter whether
