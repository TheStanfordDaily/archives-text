# SRI explosion kills one, injures three
## 
### Julia Sobrevilla Staff writer with AP wire reports 
A 33-year-old scientist was killed and
three others were injured in an explo
sion Thursday morning while the team
was conducting research related to cold
fusion at SRI International in Menlo
Park.
The explosion occurred after an auto
matic pressure-release valve failed on a
sealed canister in a second-floor lab, but
the exact cause of the accident is still
unknown. "Fifteen different things
could've happened," SRI spokesperson
Dennis Maxwell said.
Fire officials sealed off the lab and
evacuated about 60 people from the
building after the explosion. No radioac
tivity or toxic chemicals were released in
the explosion, fire officials said.
According to Maxwell, the building
sustained no structural damage. The
explosion was described by company
officials as a sharp blast that sounded
like a single rifle shot.
Although SRI began as the Stanford
Research Institute, it is no longer affili
ated with the University.
James Riley, who died in the acci
dent, suffered massive head and upper
body injuries, according to Steve
Hortin, San Mateo County chief deputy

coroner. Hiley had worked at the now
defunct National Cold Fusion Institute,
affiliated with the University of Utah,
before coming to SRI.
Riley and Steven Crouch-Baker, who
received minor wounds in the explosion,
were contract scientists with Electric
Power Research Institute of Palo Alto
(EPRI), one of the largest financial
backers of cold fusion research in the
country.
The other researchers injured in the
explosion were Stuart Smedley, 48, and
Michael McKubre, 43. Both suffered
face and arm injuries and were released
Thursday afternoon from Stanford
Hospital.
Maxwell said that after police and
fire officials conclude their investiga
tions, SRI will conduct its own investi
gation into the causes of the explosion.
Meanwhile, research on the project has
stopped.
"We won't proceed with any type of
research until we know what caused the
explosion," Maxwell said.
Fusion is the force that powers stars
and hydrogen bombs through merging,
not splitting, atoms. Small explosions
have occurred in prior cold fusion exper
iments, but no injuries were reported.
Three years ago, cold fusion created a
national stir when University of Utah
electrochemist B. Stanley Pons and his

British colleague Martin Fleischmann
declared that energy could be created in
ajar at room temperature by using very
basic laboratory equipment.
Their findings were received with a
heavy dose of skepticism by the scientif
ic community, and the results could not
be reproduced in many labs, including
those at Caltech and MIT.
A Stanford research team supported
the cold fusion findings at the time and
reproduced the Utah experiments
obtaining similar results. Turgut Gur,
now technical director for the Center
for Materials Research and a research
associate at the time, said the program
studying cold fusion at Stanford ended
in March 1990 because funding was ter
minated.
EPRI funded both the Stanford and
SRI programs, and researchers from
both institutions held weekly meetings
to compare findings and share results,
Gur said.
"There is enough evidence in pub
lished materials to show this [topic]
needs to be looked into," Gur said.
Because of the widespread skepti
cism and negative publicity cold fusion
received when the original findings
were questioned, funding has been lim
ited, Gur said. He added that this explo
sion might have further negative effects
on funding.
