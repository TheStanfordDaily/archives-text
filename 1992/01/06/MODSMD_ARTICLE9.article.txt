Baby born after sexual assault
MILWAUKEE (AP) — Two men sexually assaulted a
woman who was nine months pregnant, police said. She
gave birth less than 48 hours later, and she and her daugh
ter were reported in good condition yesterday.
Two men were arrested in the attack, police said.
The victim was headed home from a store late Thursday
when a man approached her and pushed what she said was
a gun into her back, police detective Lt. James Ardis said.
The woman told police the man forced her to walk to an
apartment building where he and another man sexually
assaulted her several times.
The men, who apparently used cocaine and marijuana
during the assault, freed the woman Friday morning, Ardis
said. Police believe the men didn't know the woman.
Teenager suspected in football murder
FRESNO, Calif. (AP) — A 16-year-old boy has surren
dered to police investigating the shooting deaths of a Fres
no State football star and his girlfriend.
The youth was booked into Fresno County Juvenile Hall
Saturday night for investigation of murdering Melvin

Johnson, 21, and Lisa Kelly, 19, police said.
The Fresno Bee identified the suspect as Eric Phelps
and published an interview with his older brother, Tony
Phelps, 26, on Saturday.
Police refused to identify the suspect because he is a
minor.
Tony Phelps told the newspaper one of his two younger
brothers killed Johnson during an argument over Kelly. He
did not specify which one, but said Kric had dated Kelly in
the past.
Naked gunman surrenders
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) — A gunman who

a white towel above his head."
Kent Maynard, 40, was booked for investigation of
attempted murder on a police officer and for shooting at an
inhabited dwelling. He was being held at the Huntington
Beach Police Station in lieu of $250,000 bail.
