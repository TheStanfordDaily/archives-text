Proposed Cuts to Student Resources
Student Resources has an overall reduction target of
• $2,500,000 or 10% for undergraduate financial
aid awards,
• $2,250,000 or 12.7% for its general funds (GF) programs,
• $584,000 or 15% for its rent-funded (RF) programs
(i.e, Res Ed, Grad
Residences, part of Housing Center).
A minimum of 65% of these cuts should be implemented in 1992-93.
At this time, C-UAFA, the Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid, has not finalized its recommendations. For this reason,
recommendations for financial aid award cuts will be announced at a
later date.
The following proposals for cuts were recommended by individual offices
after consultation at the local level. They have also been reviewed by
faculty, staff, and students on the Ad Hoc Student Resources Advisory
Committee.
For each area, the total budget is given, followed by a dollar figure and
description of changes we are proposing, and a dollar figure and
description of possible changes where we still believe there is
considerable choice. Very likely cuts are marked with a bullet (•); other
potential cuts are marked with a question mark (?).

-Are the likely cuts reasonable?
-Which additional cuts do you prefer?
-What is your view of the one-time Pre-Matriculation Fee in lieu of
separate, fee for service charges by the Registrar and CPPC?
-What is your view of the Cowell special fee, in lieu of much higher
costs billed to some students who need after hours care or referral to
specialists? Are other health service cuts preferable to these two
reductions in service?
-Can you think of anything this document does not discuss which is
relevant to the matter at hand?
