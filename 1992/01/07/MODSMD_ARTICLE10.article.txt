Bush takes on trade barriers in Tokyo
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — President Bush, heading for a
trade showdown in Tokyo, said Yesterday that political foes were
trying to trip him up with unrealistic expectations. Automakers
back home reported big sales declines, underlining a mtyor sore
point Bush is sure to address in Japan.
With pressure building in both Tokyo and Washington, there
were fresh signs that Japan was readying trade concessions to try
to make Bush's trip a success. He has billed his visit as a bid to
find jobs for Americans by tearing down Japanese trade barriers.
Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Yesterday that
his country must be a "friend in need" to an economically strug
gling United States and that he would do everything he could to
help U.S. automakers improve their sales in Japan.
Letters reveal new twist in old crisis
WASHINGTON (AP) — Contrary to the popular view of the
time, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev considered the outcome of
the 1962 Cuban missile crisis a significant Soviet victory because
he elicited a pledge from President Kennedy not to invade Cuba.
Khrushchev's thoughts were outlined in an extraordinary
exchange of post-crisis letters with Kennedy that the State Depart
ment made public yesterday after keeping them secret for more
than 29 years.
The letters highlight the hopes, fears and deep mistrust of the
two leaders as they sought to come to grips with the aftermath of
the most dangerous nuclear crisis the world has confronted.
The disclosure of the letters ended a four-year campaign for
their release by the National Security Archives, a private foreign
policy research group based in Washington. All told, 15 letters
between Oct. 30 and Dec. 19, 1962, were released.
Murder tally highest ever in U.S.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of murders nationwide
last year topped 24,000 for the first time, an increase of 580 over
1990, according to an estimate yesterday from the Senate Judi
ciary Committee.
"A year which saw the rest of the world become safer for Amer
icans saw this nation become less safe for its own citiens," said the
committee chairman, Sen. Joseph Biden Jr., D-Del.
