Stanford has coordinated previously sepa
rate courses on children's issues in a new pro
gram called "Children and Society," bringing
together classes which are taught in depart
ments as diverse as psychology, economics,
biology and law.
Students who take the three core courses:
Children and Society; Children and the Law;
and Children and Public Policies: Strategies for
Change, will study topics such as children of
divorced families, the abuse and neglect of chil
dren, labor-force participation and child care.
If the program succeeds, "students will
learn to be able to apply their experiences in
future roles as citizens, civic leaders and par
ents," said Project Coordinator Shen Nagel.
Hands-on experience is an important part
of the program, as students will be encouraged

to participate in service-related and public
policy internships as well as research.
"Through internships, students will be able
to experience real policy-making and become
involved in the research community," said
Sociology Prof. Sandy Dornsbush, who is
teaching Children and Society this quarter
within the Sociology Department.
The program will rely most on private
sources for funding in its first two years. But
its coordinators intend to use existing classes
and resources to put together a lasting pro
gram at the University.
"It will involve a re-allocation of funds and
time on the part of the faculty. It will be an
attachment to old programs. Some courses
may have to be updated and others dropped to
make room during the reprioritization of
classes," said School of Education Prof.
Michael Kirst.

The program will include 20 professors
from various departments who are now a part
of the curriculum planning group. The cur
riculum will integrate the perspectives of var
ious fields including psychology, sociology,
anthropology, biology, education, political sci
ence and economics in its study of children's
issues.
Children and Society will not be a separate
meyor. Instead, it will offer students in various
majors an area of specialization. Students
completing the core classes of the curriculum
will receive a certificate upon graduation.
Dornsbush is confident the program will
prove popular. "There seems to be a large
interest in the study of children's issues
among Stanford students," Dornsbush said.
The new curriculum is currently run
through the Family Studies Center, an inter
disciplinary research center.
