## Person of the year 
### 
Prof. Frances Conley
has shown Stanford
she is 'larger than life'

IN MANY RESPECTS 1991 WAS
larger than life at Stanford.
The University was awakened
to the here-today, gone-tomorrow
nature of federal funding said pub
lic favor through the antics of the
rough-and-tumble, campus-based
navy regulator Paul Biddle.
And the resignation of Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy —
who has been one of the most pop
ular yet beleaguered leaders in
Stanford history — left a commu
nity anticipating the end of a seem
ingly endless spate of Stanford
bashing and fiscal uncertainty.
In many ways, the University that
left 1991 was a different one than the
Stanford that began the year.
But one player stands out as the
person who affected Stanford in
the most meaningful way during
1991. Neurosurgery Prof. Francis
Conley, who made sexual harass
ment a national issue with her
June resignation from the School
of Medicine, wins The Daily's
"Larger than Life" award.
Conley resigned from Stanford
in June because of 25 years of "per
vasive sexism" and the promotion
of Prof. Gerald Silverberg to perma
nent department chair. Although
declining to mention him by name,
Conley said Silverberg "devalues
" women and . .. anyone who he per
ceives to be his inferior."
Instantly, the widely respected
Conley became a national symbol
for the prevalence of sexual
harassment in the workplace. She
had a lot to lose in coming forward,
but her stature in the medical
community lent the dramatic step
even more weight.
Although the sexual harass
ment spotlight later shifted to
Anita Hill, who took the stand
against Clarence Thomas before
his confirmation to the Supreme

Court, Conley remains a hero for
many because of her courage and
strength of conviction.
Soon after Conley walked away
from what she called the "hostile"
Medical School environment,
Kennedy filed harassment charges
against one of Conley's colleagues
at the school. Additionally, other
women at the Medical School have
stepped forward to allege similar
incidents.
In response, administrators have
worked to ease the situation, in
what Conley described as "a mono
lithic institution [struggling) with
internal conflict, with its values, its
image — with its very identity."
Conley returned to Stanford in
the fall because of the steps the
University had taken, and because
she wanted to keep the issue alive.
She was welcomed back like a
Vietnam veteran — treated both as
hero and pariah. Yet she has
accepted this with grace. Her
return is further testimony to her
commitment to fair treatment.
Unlike Hill, Conley came for
ward independently with her
charges. She put her rights before
her reputation and, in the end,
emerged as a source of strength
and wisdom for many.
The independence of her action
is inspirational for women whose
lives are blighted by harassment,
but whose livelihoods depend on
tolerating the injustice. And it is
educational for men who think this
behavior is acceptable, or some
thing imagined by a "disturbed"
accuser.
For Medical School students and
the Stanford community, the
lessons they learned from Conley
will be more important than any
they learn in the classroom.
In her quiet, dignified way, Con
ley has taught us that courage can
overcome injustice and that
demeaning treatment is not a priv
ilege that comes with power.
Although the problem of sexual
harassment is ongoing, Conley has
taken an important first step.
We will look to her leadership in
the future.
