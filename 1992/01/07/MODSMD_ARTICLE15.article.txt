## Ode to a palm – '91 in review 
### 
WHAT A HOMECOMING. Still
reveling in the decadence and
debauchery of winter break, I
stepped into my room. I glanced around
with fond memories of the year gone by
and looked forward to the good times that
lay ahead. Then I saw it.
Over in the corner of my room, my
palm tree stood dying. Neglected and for
lorn, its leaves were brown with age and
wilting under the burdens they bore.
I rushed over, clearly too late. This one
was history. My first casualty of the year
was upon me.
My mind was plagued with guilt.
Maybe bad sunlight had killed it. Maybe
its soil had not been fertile enough. Per
haps it was allergic to its plastic pot.
But it got worse. Maybe it died of loneli
ness because I hadn't spoken to it enough.
Maybe I had spoken to it too much. Maybe
it was all the Barry Manilow and Bee Geet>-
albums that I had subjected it to.
Or maybe it was something as simple as
not having been watered for three weeks.
I'm pretty sure it was the Bee Gees.
Well, I wallowed in despair until I real
ized that my New Year's resolution was
staring me in the face — I had not made
one yet. In tribute to my dying tree, I
decided to turn over a new leaf: This year
I'd look at the proverbial cup as half full
rather than half empty.
I thought of all the possibilities. Now I
could enjoy my tree's passing — surely it

was better this way. There was no doubt
— it was going to tree heaven, where
there's clean air, ridiculous quantities of
fertile soil and no urinating dogs. So my
tree was actually getting a great deal. I
had done it a favor.
No doubt I would emerge stronger
from the experience, able to continue the
tradition of excellence and fortitude that
my little tree had begun. Now I began to
understand how Leland might have been
so inspired by a pine (or whatever our
mascot is).
This looking-on-the-bright-side stuff
really worked. All of a sudden, 1991
started to look a lot different:
No longer did Saddam Hussein's sur
vival pose a threat to peaceful stability,
but rather it promised to provide yet
another opportunity for the United
States to prove its military superiority.
Our "recession" (the higher-ups finally
acknowledged it as such) would no doubt
result in greater strength. After all, from
adversity emerges excellence, right?
The tragic infection of one of basket
ball's greatest stars at least shed some
needed attention on what can be accu
rately called an epidemic.
The budget crisis caused Stanford to
re-prioritize its agenda, temporarily get
ting rid of that terribly useful room of
typewriters at Meyer.
Losers and underdogs the world over
were inspired by 1990s two worst major

league baseball teams playing one of the
best World Series ever.
Speaking of losers and athletes, Geral
do made it through another season with
out getting hit by a chair or catching any
social diseases (as did Wilt Chamberlain).
View-telephone service took one more
step toward becoming a reality, so that
now all your friends could see how horren
dous you looked when they woke you up.
In a half-hearted effort to negotiate
peace, the Arabs and Israelis made it all the
way into the same hall. (Did we dare dream
of something as ludicrous as their sitting at
the same table, or even in the same room?)
The wave of expressive intolerance
that swept over campuses and art muse
ums ensured that no one's feelings would
be hurt. (Who cares about freedom of
expression?)
We got Clarence Thomas on the
Supreme Court. (Take that one as you will.)
And, at least David Duke did not get
elected, although he'd probably have a
pretty good shot if he ran for office in
Europe right now.
Wow, what a difference your perspec
tive makes. May my tree rest in peace.
