## Mark Clayton Stanford must shift burden of proof for sexual assault 
### 
RECENT CONTROVERSIES re
garding sexual harassment and
sexual assault, both nationally and
at Stanford, have focused attention upon
these important issues. It is encouraging
to see Stanford officials and committees
working to frame meaningful policies
regarding sexual harassment and
assault.
I would urge the Stanford community
to recognize that sexual misbehavior is a
violation of honor and should be prohibit
ed by the Honor Code.
Although it may be impossible to
achieve a conviction of rape in the court
system, it may still be very obvious that
someone accused of sexual assault has
behaved dishonorably. Stanford has no
obligation to tolerate such an individual
as part of its community.
Honorable behavior is not difficult to
describe. An honorable sexual relation
ship is one of respect, trust, compassion
and love. Exploitation, abuse, domination
and coercion have no place in such a rela

tionship. If it can be shown that a man
exploited, abused or coerced a woman,
then a violation of honor has occurred. A
pattern of such actions should be taken
as sufficient evidence of dishonorable
behavior.
In the Stuart Thomas case, the fact
that several people could corroborate the
accused's modus operandi of plying
potential victims with alcohol should be
proof enough to warrant disciplinary
action by the University.
In addition, the testimony of the vic
tim should be given great weight. After
all, the only person who can possibly
know whether an individual gave consent
to sex is that individual. Everyone else is
merely speculating. Although the stan
dard of "innocent until proven guilty" is
important, it is absurd to promulgate the
status quo that says the victim is
assumed to be lying unless proven to be
telling the truth.
If a woman says she has been raped,
then she has been raped unless it can be

proven she is lying. If a man has sex with
her, then that can be demonstrated by
objective medical testing. If she says that
she did not give her consent, then he
raped her. It should be up to the accused
to prove that she gave her consent.
Such a policy would place a great deal
of responsibility on men. No doubt, some
people will argue that men could be
exposed to an undue risk of a false accu
sation. In reality, the risk is small if a
man behaves in an honorable fashion.
The way for men to minimize their risk
is to avoid sex with people they don't
know. If there is no mutual trust, com
passion and respect, don't go to bed
together.
The attitude that a woman is merely a
sexual object to be conquered and that a
man may use any ruse or deception in her
conquest is itself despicable. Stanford
need not tolerate such attitudes.
In these times of faltering confidence
and tarnished reputations, Stanford has
the opportunity to take a position of

national leadership on this issue. Our
Honor Code makes a difference. Let's not
reduce it to merely a matter of not violat
ing the law.
As it exists, our Honor Code sets a
high standard for academic honesty, one
that goes far beyond federal, state or local
statutes. We have a higher standard. If
Stanford decides to define and enforce
honorable sexual and social conduct in its
community, it could have influence far
beyond the borders of our campus. Such
a code could serve as a model for behavior
on other campuses.
Stanford could help heal the perverse
and exploitative sexual attitudes that are
pervasive across our nation.
Let's define at Stanford a code of hon
orable sexual and social behavior. Stan
ford can be a place of not only scholastic
excellence, but also of high ethical stan
dards and honor.
