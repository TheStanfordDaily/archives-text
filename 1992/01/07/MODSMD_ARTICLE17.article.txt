# The
						Washington Post blasts Biddle's 'Qui Tam Scam'
## 
### 
Editor's note: The following is a
reprint of a Dec. 26 Washington Post edi
torial concerning federal regulator Paul
Biddle.
SHOULD A FEDERAL EMPLOYEE
who does his job well be able to col
lect a couple of hundred million dol
lars as a reward? It sounds preposterous,
but it very well may happen in California,
where a Navy auditor stands to recover
up to 30 percent of the money that Stan
ford is expected to have to repay to the
government for overcharges it made.
Paul Biddle, the auditor, has filed legal
action little used until recently, called a
qui tam claim. The Latin phrase means
"Who, as well as . .because the plain

tiff sues for himself, as well as for the
government, to recover money fraudu
lently obtained from government.
The idea of these suits is to provide an
incentive for members of the public to
give information about abuses and assist
in recovering government funds. But tra
ditionally, this kind of reward is not
available to public servants who are
already being paid to do this work.
A policeman, for example, cannot
claim a reward for capturing a criminal
because that's his job. Why should Bid
die, who is already being paid to audit
Stanford's books and who has been able
to obtain information, question universi
ty officials and rely on public support ser
vices only because he is working for the

federal government, be able to claim this
additional bonanza?
The answer lies in a drafting error in
the 1986 revisions of the False Claims
Act, which federal courts have ruled
allows federal employees to file qui tam
actions. In the wake of these cases, the
Justice Department has asked Congress
to correct the error and close this loop
hole immediately.
Meanwhile, Stanford has a terrible
problem that two of its alumni, Rep. Don
Edwards, D-Calif., and Sen Jeff Binga
man, D-N.M., are attempting to sort out.
While there is little sympathy for Stan
ford's long-term cooking of books, it is
obvious that this continuing investiga
tion should not be in the hands of the

very man who stands to make a whopping
personal profit if the government recov
ers.
The legislators have asked the Navy to
reassign Mr. Biddle, but inexplicably the
Navy is dragging its feet, "monitoring"
the situation and avoiding the step that,
in fairness, must be taken immediately.
The conflict of interest here is as clear
as it would be if judges were empowered
to set fines and keep a percentage of
everything they collect. There is no justi
fication for allowing government employ
ees to file these actions for recovery.
Present law creates a stunning loop
hole, and the Stanford case presents a
spectacular conflict of interest. Both
should be corrected â€” fast.
