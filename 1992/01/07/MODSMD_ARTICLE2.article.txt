# Earth Systems a major possibility
## Faculty Senate to vote on making program degree-granting 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
While some students are concerned
their might be eliminated in the
next few months, those planning to
study the environment are hoping
theirs will be created.
This Thursday, the Faculty Senate
will vote on whether to recognize Earth
Systems, an interdisciplinary program
that began in October, as a degree
granting program.
A number of students already plan to
major in Earth Systems — 100 students
took the first segment of the three-course
core last quarter. About 20 plan to major
in it, according to visiting Geology Lec
turer and Program Director Dan Orange.
Earth Systems has been in the works
for several years and was first presented
to the Faculty Senate Committee on
Undergraduate Studies last February.
According to Committee Chair David
Freyberg, several concerns were behind
the long wait for approval, including the

question of whether enough money was
in place and whether sufficient interde
partmental planning had occurred.
The committee has approved the pro
gram and passed the proposal along to
the full Senate for debate. If approved,
the program will be instituted as a
three-year pilot project that will be eval
uated for effectiveness.
"The decision has been delayed, I
think rather too long, " said Gary Ernst,
dean of the School of Earth Sciences. "1
really feel badly that it hasn't been
authorized as a major yet. Students are
a little worried."
Junior Tish Clark who has planned
to major in Earth Systems since she
heard about the program as a freshman,
said, "The worst part is just not know
ing if it's going to pass — not knowing if
I'm going to have a major."
Last month she declared a geology
major to satisfy registration require
ments. She hopes to switch to Earth
Systems as soon as possible.
For senior Brendan Moorehead,

however, Earth Systems came a little
too late. A human biology major inter
ested in tropical agriculture systems,
Moorehead said he "absolutely" would
have majored in Earth Systems had it
been available a few years ago, but at
this point, he was "too far along to do
the undergraduate program."
Moorehead, who is taking an Earth
Systems core class this quarter, said he
would co-term if the program were
available on a graduate level.
Ernst takes charge
Ernst's arrival two years ago from
UCLA catalyzed the program's creation.
"People here were already beating
the drums when I came, but I started
beating harder," said Ernst.
The program is designed to grant
students the background necessary to
approach environmental problems from
an interdisciplinary angle. Coursework
includes biology, geology, chemistry and
