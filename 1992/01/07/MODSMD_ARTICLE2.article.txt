# Earth Systems a major possibility
## Faculty Senate to vote on making program degree-granting 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
While some students are concerned
their might be eliminated in the
next few months, those planning to
study the environment are hoping
theirs will be created.
This Thursday, the Faculty Senate
will vote on whether to recognize Earth
Systems, an interdisciplinary program
that began in October, as a degree
granting program.
A number of students already plan to
major in Earth Systems — 100 students
took the first segment of the three-course
core last quarter. About 20 plan to major
in it, according to visiting Geology Lec
turer and Program Director Dan Orange.
Earth Systems has been in the works
for several years and was first presented
to the Faculty Senate Committee on
Undergraduate Studies last February.
According to Committee Chair David
Freyberg, several concerns were behind
the long wait for approval, including the

question of whether enough money was
in place and whether sufficient interde
partmental planning had occurred.
The committee has approved the pro
gram and passed the proposal along to
the full Senate for debate. If approved,
the program will be instituted as a
three-year pilot project that will be eval
uated for effectiveness.
"The decision has been delayed, I
think rather too long, " said Gary Ernst,
dean of the School of Earth Sciences. "1
really feel badly that it hasn't been
authorized as a major yet. Students are
a little worried."
Junior Tish Clark who has planned
to major in Earth Systems since she
heard about the program as a freshman,
said, "The worst part is just not know
ing if it's going to pass — not knowing if
I'm going to have a major."
Last month she declared a geology
major to satisfy registration require
ments. She hopes to switch to Earth
Systems as soon as possible.
For senior Brendan Moorehead,

however, Earth Systems came a little
too late. A human biology major inter
ested in tropical agriculture systems,
Moorehead said he "absolutely" would
have majored in Earth Systems had it
been available a few years ago, but at
this point, he was "too far along to do
the undergraduate program."
Moorehead, who is taking an Earth
Systems core class this quarter, said he
would co-term if the program were
available on a graduate level.
Ernst takes charge
Ernst's arrival two years ago from
UCLA catalyzed the program's creation.
"People here were already beating
the drums when I came, but I started
beating harder," said Ernst.
The program is designed to grant
students the background necessary to
approach environmental problems from
an interdisciplinary angle. Coursework
includes biology, geology, chemistry and
physics, as well as economics.
Some critics worry that the
program will not provide enough
focus.
The problem, Ernst said, is
that "You can't just tackle one
aspect of an environmental
issue," and "no single discipline
can treat the whole problem."
"This a very exciting time," he
said. "We are shaking ourselves
our of our traditional disciplines."
Currently, students who wish
to major in Earth Systems will
take a three-course core, offered
for the first time this year, in
addition to basic requirements in
physics, chemistry, biology, geolo
gy and math, before focusing on
one of five specialized tracks:
Earth Science, biological science,
economics, land use planning and
engineering systems.
Program coordinators expect to
eventually attract about 45 majors.
"The best thing about Earth
Systems," said Moorehead, "is
that it allows you to dabble and
gives you enough breadth to find
out what's interesting, but also
forces you to specialize."
A new course, "Introduction to
Earth Systems," will be taught by
Ernst and a number of guest pro
fessors — including University
President Donald Kennedy — this
quarter. The course attempts to
weave together different fields
involved in environmental stud
ies, including biology, geology and
economics.
The introductory class fea
tures several field trips — such as
a visit to the San Andreas fault
line in Hollister — to "show how
civilization impinges on nature,
sometimes in an unfortunate
way," Ernst said.
Ernst said one challenge faced
by program coordinators is inte
grating the lectures to create a
comprehensive curriculum. "It
won't be seamless the first time,
but we're making sure the link
ages are there," Ernst said.
Out with old, in with new?
When the proposal for Earth
Systems comes to the floor this
week, it may face opposition on
the grounds of University budget
constraints.
Orange said it was difficult for
him to gauge the amount of oppo

sition the proposal might face
because he is usually surrounded
by enthusiasts of the program.
However, he said, any resis
tance encountered "will most like
ly come from departments that
are likely to be cut" in the current
round of budget cuts.
Orange said the start-up
money for the program has come
entirely from funds outside of the
general operating budget, so that
it will not take away from other
departments in the short-term.
The first three pilot years of
Earth Systems will be funded by
gifts, including a $120,000 anony
mous gift guaranteed by Donald

Kennedy, a $50,000 grant from a
NASA environmental education
institute, and $60,000 from the
Bing gift fund, provided by Dean
of Humanities and Sciences
Ewart Thomas.
The School of Earth Sciences
will also provide the program with
$75,000 over three years.
Coordinators of Earth Systems
said they were concerned that it
might be difficult to initiate a new
major during a time of belt tight
ening, but felt the program
marked a significant and neces
sary step forward for Stanford,
due to the growing importance of
global environmental issues and
the need to produce professionals
equipped to deal with all aspects
of these problems.
"I can't say there is no cost,
but this is a program whose time
has come," Ernst said.
Provost James Rosse, in a let
ter of support for Earth Systems
distributed to all Faculty Senate
members, said he believes "the

day Stanford ceases to be respon
sive to changes in the focus of the
internal and external intellectual
environment is the day that we
begin to lose our vitality and lapse
into institutional mediocrity."
To preserve Stanford's excel
lence in a time of limited
resources, "some existing pro
grams will have to be eliminated
in order to preserve our capacity
to support new opportunities and
innovation," he continued. "The
proposed Earth Systems program
is a grass-roots initiative reflect
ing the considerable interest and
concern of our local intellectual
community and an ever-increas
ing circle world-wide."
Clark agreed with this assess
ment, saying, "A strong environ
mental program is critical to any
University looking to attract peo
ple in the long-term," because
more and more people are enter
ing environmental fields.
If rejection comes
If Earth Systems does not
receive approval as an official
major, Ernst said the School of
Earth Sciences will assist stu
dents in declaring an individually
designed major in earth systems,
using the program's core and
other predetermined, recom
mended classes to form a compre
hensive academic program.
But Orange said students have
expressed concern over declaring
an individually designed major,
fearing their degree might lack
credibility.
Not all students share this con
cern, however. Sophomore Eric
Selman plans to in Earth
Systems whether it receives
approval or not.
Selman said the structure of
the program will facilitate declar
ing an individually designed
major, and that the academic pro
gram is well-suited to his tenta
tive future plans to enter environ
mental consulting, law or politics.
And though some professors
from more traditional disciplines
were skeptical about the depth of
training provided in an interdisci
plinary program, Ernst said he
doesn't foresee any difficulty plac
ing students in jobs after gradua
tion. He said he has already been
approached by several oil compa
ny executives interested in hiring
trained people with interdisci
plinary environmental back
grounds to oversee their drilling
activities.
