## Young netters see great opportunity in new year Johnson leads women to Milwaukee while Willens, Poruri head to desert 
### Gretchen Atwood Editorial staff 
Coming back from winter break you
might expect the Stanford women's ten
nis team to be a bit rusty. So does coach
Frank Brennan.
"At this point, the goal is to get the
girls some matches," Brennan said. Pro
viding the competition this week will be
the Milwaukee Tennis Classic and
National College Classic in Palm Springs.
Play starts today in the Cheese State.
Kylie Johnson, Emma Woodhouse, Amy
Chiminello and Mario Carruth are com
peting in singles and doubles. Johnson is
the tournament's No. 3 singles seed
behind California's Lisa Albano and Min
nesota's Jackie Moe.
Johnson, a senior from Salt Lake City,
is No. 28 in the fall Volvo Tennis colle
giate rankings. Unranked in the presea
son poll, she moved up the charts with a
second-place finish in the Rolex Regionals
in November.
Johnson is also on a roll in doubles. She
and Woodhouse won the Rolex Regionals
and are the No. 2 seed in Milwaukee.
"It's a good solid tournament. This one
is deeper and bigger but [the National
College Classic] is slightly higher caliber,"
Brennan said.
Making the trek to Palm Springs are
Heather Willens, Laxmi Poruri, Kim
Shasby and Kristine Kurth. Willens leads
the pack with a No. 5 national ranking, up
four notches after making the finals of the
Riviera All-American Championships in
October. The junior All-American has
made consistent improvement, impress
ing Brennan.
"Just when I think she's used up all
the talent she has, she gets better," he
said. "Matches which we used to call great
wins for Heather are now routine."
The progress of Poruri has also gained
praise from the coach. "She is extremely

talented and has now settled in and gotten
comfortable." And Poruri has improved
even more mentally than she has physi
cally. "She has had a confidence crisis for
a number of years, but now her confi-

dence is back," Brennan said.
Poruri's improved all-around play led
to a win over Johnson in the Rolex
Regionals final and a current No. 18 rank
ing.
Besides Poruri and Willens, Brennan
likes what he sees with the doubles tan
dem of transfer Kristine Kurth and fresh
man Kim Shasby. "They are very good
and very dangerous," he said. "The
results have not been super so far, but
they've gotten to know each other very
quickly."
The tournaments kick off a busy Win
ter Quarter for the netters, as dual match
es start at the end of January and Pacific
10 Conference showdowns begin mid-
February. Not only will the tournaments
prepare the Cardinal for national compe
tition, but also for the intra-squad chal
lenge matches which Brennan slates for
the end of the month.
"It's nice to have two tournaments.
Only the top eight teams get invited to
Palm Springs so it gives us a double
whammy. We get to play our top eight
players," Brennan said. "Everyone will

get a chance to play some match
es. This will create an even play
ing field entering the challenge
matches."
The Cardinal faces the next
few months of competition with
a look new to many Stanford
fans. In the past, the Cardinal
dominated the upper echelons of
collegiate tennis. Often the top
three players on the Stanford
squad were ranked in the top five
or ten nationally. The lineup was
also dotted with NCAA Champi
ons. Last year's team included
two former singles winners and a
doubles titlist.
Gone are the superstars and
much of the experience. Only
two players rank in the top twen
ty and no one has won an NCAA
title. But Brennan seems confi
dent. "Everyone's still working
hard. The only difference is that
everyone feels like they can move
up. There's renewed enthusiasm
because people see a window of
opportunity."
