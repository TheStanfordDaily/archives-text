ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Academic stan
dards will grab most of the attention at this
week's NCAA convention. It may be a couple
of measures designed to reduce the dominance
of major athletic powers that will be remem
bered, though.
"If they get passed, then you can bet there
will be some very, very unhappy people in
Division I-A," said Chuck Neinas, executive
director of the College Football Association. "I
would predict a lot of provocative quotes."
Said another observer, who asked not to be
identified, "The I-A schools bring in the
money. They are what makes the NCAA tick.
If these proposals get passed, then there's
bound to be a lot of talk about the I-A schools
just going out and forming their own associa
tion. This is a dangerous trend."
The two proposals to reduce Division I-A
representation on the policy-making NCAA
Council and Presidents Commission are
expected to come to a vote on Wednesday,
about midway through the four-day meeting
that begins on Tuesday. More than 2,300 dele
gates will deal with more than 140 items,
including a package of proposals by the Presi
dents Commission which would greatly
strengthen academic requirements for fresh
men and upperclass athletes.

The 106 Division I-A schools are the major
football schools. But they also make up the
bulk of the nationally competitive Division I
basketball programs. Under a proposal intro
duced by the Metro Atlantic Athletic Confer
ence, the Council and Presidents Commission
would include a representative of every men's
basketball conference.
Another proposal, sponsored by the North
east Conference, would apportion Division I
representation on the two policy-making bod
ies according to geographic region.
Both would necessarily reduce Division I-A
representation, which is currently set at 12
members on the 44-member Council and
Presidents Commission.
NCAA president Judy Sweet and executive
director Dick Schultz have been working
behind the scenes against the proposals.
"I think the Council operates very effec
tively in the current structure," said Sweet,
who is from Division 111 California-San Diego.
"I think there will be some healthy debate on
the proposal," Sweet added. "I don't sense
that there's a lot of strong support."
If either measure wins passage, Sweet said,
"I think there would be some strong uneasi
ness."
Sweet, named as the first woman president

of the NCAA last year, will be presiding over
her first convention as the organization's
chief elected officer. Because of the highly
charged academic issues, it could be one of the
most heated meetings in years. Proposed by
the Presidents Commission, the measures
would greatly toughen the academic require
ments for prospective and enrolled athletes.
Under the present freshman eligibility rule
known as Proposition 48, freshman to be eli
gible their first year must have a 2.000 — or C
average — in 11 high school "core" or college
prepatory courses. They must also make a
minimum score on the ACT or SAT college
entrance exams.
The new rule would raise the number of
core courses to 13 and hike the minimum
grade point in the core from 2.00 to 2.500.
There would also be a sliding index where a
higher grade point in the core offsets a lower
test score.
In addition, the Presidents Commission is
seeking to toughen the continuing eligbibility
requirements, forcing an athlete to complete a
progressive percentage of courses in a specific
degree program. In their third, fourth and
fifth years, athletes would need to have com
pleted 25, 50 and 75 percent of the require
ments for graduation.
