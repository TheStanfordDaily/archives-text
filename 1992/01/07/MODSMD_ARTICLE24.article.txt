While most Stanford students were at
home sleeping in and hanging out with
friends, the men's and women's basketball
teams were sinking shots and snagging
rebounds in an impressive fashion. Two
juniors in particular, Val Whiting and Peter
Dukes, put in key performances for the Card.
Whiting sunk a phenomenal nine points
in 75 seconds during the fourth quarter of
Stanford's hair-raising victory over Ten
nessee on Dec. 14. However, her perfor

mance was not enough as the Cardinal went
into over time against the tough Lady Vols.
Whiting came through again in over-time by
nailing a shot from 18 feet out over a tough
defender. The Stanford women won, 96-95.
Whiting hit a game high 14 rebounds and
26 points, which tied her career high. She
also led the team in points and rebounds
against Southern Illinois with 17 and 15,
respectively.
Friday night the No. 2-ranked Cardinal
took on Santa Clara and Whiting had her
seventh double-double in 10 games. She
scored within two points of her career high
and came within one rebound of her career
high.
She is shooting an impressive .508 from
the field so far this season. Whiting leads the
team in scoring (17.4), rebounds (10.9) and
blocked shots (1.4).
❖
In men's hoops action, Dukes pulled out
all the stops during the Cardinal's six winter
break games. The six-foot-five-incb Seattle
native starts at shooting guard where he has
hit 18 three-pointers in the last four games.
In three games, he hit 16 of 23 three-point
ers. All together, he was 9of 11 from the
floor.
Dukes also has been shooting treys at an
incredible 60 percent this season. After red
shirting his freshman year he was plagued
by injuries ranging from broken ribs to shin
splints. However, he spent last summer con
centrating on three-point shots.

This sudden burst of energy and accuracy
gave him a career high 23 points against
Southern Utah, where he also shot five of
five three-pointers. This was a single game
three-point record for Stanford.
For his efforts, Dukes was also named to
the All-Tournament Team in the Spartan
Classic where Stanford defeated Santa
Clara, Siena, Southern Utah and Cal State-
Northridge before falling to No. 12-ranked
