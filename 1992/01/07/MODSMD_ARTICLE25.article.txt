(AP) â€” Joan Bonvicini has
never been on the losing side in
the Long Beach State-Arizona

Arizona when she coached
Long Beach State, and after
Sunday's 66-56 victory she's 1-
0 against Long Beach State as
the coach of Arizona.

for me," Bonvicini said. "If I
could have canceled it, I would
have. But we owed a return
game."

rebounds, while Kellie Bennett
had 22 points for the 49ers,

total of last season.

games because we're playing
hard," Bonvicini said. "At the
beginning of the year we were
the worst team in America, but
we're playing OK right now."
