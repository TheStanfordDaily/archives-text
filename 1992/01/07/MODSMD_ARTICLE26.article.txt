### 
STANFORD, Calif. (AP) - Dennis Green's foot
ball success at Stanford has caught the eye of at least
two NFL teams.
Green has interviewed for the Minnesota Vikings
head coaching job and has a meeting Tuesday in Dal
las with Tom Donahoe, director of football develop
ment for the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Green is in Dallas this week to attend the annual
American Football Coaches Association convention.
Stanford, meanwhile, has discussed a contract
extension with Green in hopes of retaining him.
"Negotiations are ongoing," said Gary Migdol, a
school spokesman.
Green has three years remaining on his contract at
Stanford but does not have a buyout clause and is free
to leave at any time, according to Stanford Athletic
Director Ted Leland.
A onetime assistant to former San Francisco 49ers
coach Bill Walsh, Green guided the Cardinal to an 8-
3 record, finishing the regular season with seven
straight wins before an 18-17 loss to Georgia Tech in
the Aloha Bowl.
"He has interviewed with some other places and
some other folks — the Pittsburg Steelers and Min
nesota Vikings — he has had conversations with
those two organizations," Migdol said. "We obviously
don't know the status of all that. But what we do
know is that Denny has indicated he's very happy at
Stanford and we have every reason to believe he will
be back next year."
