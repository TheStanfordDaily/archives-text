# Dorm mascot sends home pictures, letter
## Sources say Soto to return soon 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
Soto, the cement dog that for
years served as faithful mascot to
the Wilbur Hall dorm that shares
his name, has apparently written
yet another letter chronicling his
Pippi Longstocking-esque adven
tures.
Soto, the namesake of Leland
Stanford Jr.'s childhood pet, was
abducted from his Wilbur Hall
home in November. The 100-
pound statue has written several
letters to his former owners
since his capture.
Stanford police officials had
no leads at the time of the heist.
Postmarked from San Fran
cisco, the most recent letter
included four snapshots of the
cement dog. One pictured him on
the San Francisco bridge wear
ing a 49er's hat. Others showed
him boarding a train to Fremont
at a BART station terminal.
The recent letter contains vit
riolic attacks aimed at his past
owners, specifically Soto Resi
dent Assistant Dev Patnaik.
Near the end of the letter, Soto
outlined his complaints in har
rowing detail.
"I have tried to tell you that I
am your equal, and as such I
should be given a room, not a
chain, but there is a huge com
munication barrier between us."
Soto went on to accuse Pat
naik of verbal and physical abuse.
Patnaik said he was surprised
by the direct accusations leveled
under the good name of the once
docile, human-loving, cement dog.
"The first two [letters] were

written by a different person
because they were funny. The
third one is pretty mean-spirit
ed. There is obviously a group of
people who have done it," Pat
naik reasoned.
He said Chris Hiller, a resi
dent assistant at Arroyo, leaked
some recent information about
the cement dog's whereabouts
— hinting that a letter concern
ing a recent trip to Los Angeles
will soon arrive.
Patnaik said the Soto staff is
looking forward lo the cement
dog's imminent return, but feels
a bit betrayed by his actions and
letters.
"We have the attitude of a
parent toward an unruly child
now. We still care about him but
he's gone a bit astray."
Unconfirmed reports place
the cement dog in a student's
trunk in a parking lot on Escon
dido Road. These reports also
claim the abductors will return
the statue within the next few
weeks, as soon as a safe method
of return is found.
"They're getting sick of hav
ing it," said a source who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
"They're also getting sick of not
having trunk space."
Patnaik said the dog requires
at least two people to lift it, or
one strong person and a hand
truck. He suspects the perpetra
tors will return it soon, but if
not, he said the residents of Soto
will get along without the mas
cot.
"If they want to cart around a
cement dog for their whole life,
they can go right ahead."
