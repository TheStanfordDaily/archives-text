The University's financial troubles are taking
their toll on faculty and staff nerves, according to
Stanford Help Center Director Leah Kaplan.
"People are worried about their jobs like they
never were before," said Kaplan. "It is quite devas
tating."
The Help Center, located in Galvez House, is a
free service providing workshops and individual
counseling for faculty and staff. The center has five
part-time counselors.
Kaplan said the large increase in the number of
managers seeking counseling during the past year is
one indication of increased stress. During 1991, 81
of the center's clients were managers, compared to
50 in 1989.
"Managers find it very stressful to take good work
ers .. . and have to let them go, not because of their
performance, but because of the budget," she said.
Because of last spring's "repositioning," the $22
million reduction in administrative services, Kaplan
said she believes some members of the faculty and
staff are experiencing burnout. With fewer employ
ees, "the remaining people have to pick up the slack
and work harder," she said.
According to the center's annual report for last
year, 169 clients received counseling for job stress, 25
percent for stress specifically related to repositioning.
