The University's financial troubles are taking
their toll on faculty and staff nerves, according to
Stanford Help Center Director Leah Kaplan.
"People are worried about their jobs like they
never were before," said Kaplan. "It is quite devas
tating."
The Help Center, located in Galvez House, is a
free service providing workshops and individual
counseling for faculty and staff. The center has five
part-time counselors.
Kaplan said the large increase in the number of
managers seeking counseling during the past year is
one indication of increased stress. During 1991, 81
of the center's clients were managers, compared to
50 in 1989.
"Managers find it very stressful to take good work
ers .. . and have to let them go, not because of their
performance, but because of the budget," she said.
Because of last spring's "repositioning," the $22
million reduction in administrative services, Kaplan
said she believes some members of the faculty and
staff are experiencing burnout. With fewer employ
ees, "the remaining people have to pick up the slack
and work harder," she said.
According to the center's annual report for last
year, 169 clients received counseling for job stress, 25
percent for stress specifically related to repositioning.
"We see many faculty and staff
who have already been cut from
their jobs," Kaplan said. These
clients will be able to use the Help
Center's services for several
months while counselors help
them adjust.
Appointment cancellations also

tripled last year, and the reason
given was likely to be "'We're too
short-staffed. There's nobody
there to cover the office,"' Kaplan
said. "We have never had this
problem before."
In the past, clients would only
cancel when they were sick or had
another commitment, Kaplan said,
but now they say they fear leaving
the office during the day will reflect
negatively on their job performance.
The Help Center will increase

its after-work appointment hours
to deal with the problems, accord
ing to the annual report. Kaplan
said it will also continue to offer
workshops such as "Surviving
Stanford's Repositioning."
But with an additional $43 mil
lion being sliced from the Univer
sity's operations, Kaplan is not
optimistic.
"I think it is going to get
worse," she said. "As long as cuts
go on, it will be very difficult."
