# New fee, service cuts may help ease deficit
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
The Office of Student Resources is considering
adding a new student fee, reducing administrative
services and residence staff, and cutting advising and
academic support services to help meet the unit's
deficit-reduction target, according to a proposal
released yesterday.
Student Resources officials will hold three open
forums this week, starting tomorrow, to gauge stu
dent reaction to the proposed changes before final
decisions are made, according to Acting Vice Presi
dent for Student Resources Sally Mahoney.
Student Resources encompasses everything from
the Office of Residential Education to the Financial
Aids Office.
The plan, written by the ad hoc committee
charged with proposing budget cuts for Student
Resources, had proposed two new student fees: a
$100 one-time pre-matriculation fee and a quarterly
$14 "partial health fee."
But Mahoney said last night that the $14 health
fee was rejected yesterday by the Cabinet Committee
on Budget and Strategic Planning, the University's
top budget cutting body. (See related story.)
The Cabinet Committee has already tentatively
approved the $100 fee, but Mahoney said adoption
of the fee will depend on the student reaction she
receives this week.
The $100 fee would be charged
upon initial enrollment to most
undergraduates and graduate
students and would replace a
number of small fees that stu
dents currently pay out-of-pocket,
Mahoney said.
Those small fees include
charges for transcripts and
charges the Career Planning and
Placement Center makes for
keeping and sending records to
prospective employers. However,
Acting Registrar Jack Farrell
admitted that the new fee is larg
er than what students tradition
ally pay for those services.
The $100 fee would be waived
for current students, according to
Farrell.
The "partial health fee" was
less clear, but the committee's
report suggested it would have
been used to preserve counseling
and after-hours and weekend care
at the Cowell Student Health
Center, along with payment for
specialty referrals.
Council of Presidents member
John Overdeck, who was also a
member of the student resources
budget committee, criticized new
fees, calling them an attempt "to
transfer the University's budget
problem to students."
Mahoney had defended both
fees, saying they would replace
numerous small charges that are
expensive to administer and keep
track of.
Budget cuts
In suggesting other budget
reductions, the student resources
budget committee identified two
levels of cuts: "very likely" cuts
and "potential" cuts that may or
may not be implemented after
officials receive student feedback
this week.
In Res Ed, the largest "very
likely" cuts affect administrative
staff and the residence offices,
which would be combined and
reduced. The plan also proposes
eliminating four resident assis
tants from Sterling Quad, four
ethnic theme associates and one
resident fellow.
The RF would very likely be
removed from Manzanita Park or
Mirrielees Apartments, Overdeck
said.
"Potential" cuts in Res Ed
include further reduction in RFs
and RAs.
The CPPC would reduce coun
seling and programming services
and cut 10 student positions.

A proposed $100
one-time fee would
replace smaller out
of-pocket fees.

The Registrar's office would
cut $140,000 from its classroom
improvement budget, which
includes funds for painting, car
peting and audiovisual equip
ment.
"Potential" cuts in the Regis
trar's Office include the elimina
tion of simulated leather diploma
covers, which Farrell said cost the
University roughly $17,000 each
year.
The plan does not propose bud
get reductions in Stanford's eth
nic centers.
"We are already behind where
we want to be in our support of
them," Mahoney said.
"Potential" staff reductions
were recommended in the Finan
cial Aids Office, amounting to as
much as $55,000.
Financial Aids Director Robert
Huff and Dean of Admissions
James Montoya have expressed
concern that the office could not
take significant staff reductions
at the same time as it assumes
additional tasks related to
extracting support from non-cus
todial parents and helping stu
dents apply for outside scholar
ships.
Significant reductions were
also recommended in services at
Tresidder Union and the Bechtel
International Center. The I-Cen
ter would take an $87,000 cut.
Student Resources has been
assigned a budget-reduction tar
get of $2,250,000 (12.7 percent)
for its programs that draw money
from general funds and $584,000
(15 percent) for those programs
like Res Ed and Graduate Resi
dences that are funded by student
rent charges.
The University's current bud
get plan would decrease such
rental charges and increase
tuition by the same amount,
allowing more money to flow into
the operating budget.
Mahoney said Student
Resources officials are concerned
about students opinions on the
additional fees. The deadline for
student input is Jan. 10, she said.
Student Resources, like the
University's other administrative
units, must submit a memoran
dum detailing proposed budget
reductions to the Cabinet Com
mittee on Budget and Strategic
Planning by Jan. 17.

charged with proposing budget cuts for Student
Resources, had proposed two new student fees: a
$100 one-time pre-matriculation fee and a quarterly
$14 "partial health fee."
But Mahoney said last night that the $14 health
fee was rejected yesterday by the Cabinet Committee
on Budget and Strategic Planning, the University's
top budget cutting body. (See related story.)
The Cabinet Committee has already tentatively
approved the $100 fee, but Mahoney said adoption
of the fee will depend on the student reaction she
receives this week.
The $100 fee would be charged
upon initial enrollment to most
undergraduates and graduate
students and would replace a
number of small fees that stu
dents currently pay out-of-pocket,
Mahoney said.
Those small fees include
charges for transcripts and
charges the Career Planning and
Placement Center makes for
keeping and sending records to
prospective employers. However,
Acting Registrar Jack Farrell
admitted that the new fee is larg
er than what students tradition
ally pay for those services.
The $100 fee would be waived
for current students, according to
Farrell.
The "partial health fee" was
less clear, but the committee's
report suggested it would have
been used to preserve counseling
and after-hours and weekend care
at the Cowell Student Health
Center, along with payment for
specialty referrals.
Council of Presidents member
John Overdeck, who was also a
member of the student resources
budget committee, criticized new
fees, calling them an attempt "to
transfer the University's budget
problem to students."
Mahoney had defended both
fees, saying they would replace
numerous small charges that are
expensive to administer and keep
track of.
Budget cuts
In suggesting other budget
reductions, the student resources
budget committee identified two
levels of cuts: "very likely" cuts
and "potential" cuts that may or
may not be implemented after
officials receive student feedback
this week.
In Res Ed, the largest "very
likely" cuts affect administrative
staff and the residence offices,
which would be combined and
reduced. The plan also proposes
eliminating four resident assis
tants from Sterling Quad, four
ethnic theme associates and one
resident fellow.
The RF would very likely be
removed from Manzanita Park or
Mirrielees Apartments, Overdeck
said.
"Potential" cuts in Res Ed
include further reduction in RFs
and RAs.
The CPPC would reduce coun
seling and programming services
and cut 10 student positions.

A proposed $100
one-time fee would
replace smaller out
of-pocket fees.

The Registrar's office would
cut $140,000 from its classroom
improvement budget, which
includes funds for painting, car
peting and audiovisual equip
ment.
"Potential" cuts in the Regis
trar's Office include the elimina
tion of simulated leather diploma
covers, which Farrell said cost the
University roughly $17,000 each
year.
The plan does not propose bud
get reductions in Stanford's eth
nic centers.
"We are already behind where
we want to be in our support of
them," Mahoney said.
"Potential" staff reductions
were recommended in the Finan
cial Aids Office, amounting to as
much as $55,000.
Financial Aids Director Robert
Huff and Dean of Admissions
James Montoya have expressed
concern that the office could not
take significant staff reductions
at the same time as it assumes
additional tasks related to
extracting support from non-cus
todial parents and helping stu
dents apply for outside scholar
ships.
Significant reductions were
also recommended in services at
Tresidder Union and the Bechtel
International Center. The I-Cen
ter would take an $87,000 cut.
Student Resources has been
assigned a budget-reduction tar
get of $2,250,000 (12.7 percent)
for its programs that draw money
from general funds and $584,000
(15 percent) for those programs
like Res Ed and Graduate Resi
dences that are funded by student
rent charges.
The University's current bud
get plan would decrease such
rental charges and increase
tuition by the same amount,
allowing more money to flow into
the operating budget.
Mahoney said Student
Resources officials are concerned
about students opinions on the
additional fees. The deadline for
student input is Jan. 10, she said.
Student Resources, like the
University's other administrative
units, must submit a memoran
dum detailing proposed budget
reductions to the Cabinet Com
mittee on Budget and Strategic
Planning by Jan. 17.
The Office of Student Resources is considering
adding a new student fee, reducing administrative
services and residence staff, and cutting advising and
academic support services to help meet the unit's
deficit-reduction target, according to a proposal
released yesterday.
Student Resources officials will hold three open
forums this week, starting tomorrow, to gauge stu
dent reaction to the proposed changes before final
decisions are made, according to Acting Vice Presi
dent for Student Resources Sally Mahoney.
Student Resources encompasses everything from
the Office of Residential Education to the Financial
Aids Office.
