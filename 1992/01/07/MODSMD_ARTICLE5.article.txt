# Cutbacks at Cowell to hit student wallets
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
The Cabinet Committee on
Budget and Strategic Plan
ning has already rejected the
$14 quarterly health-services
fee Student Resources offi
cials suggested in a proposal
released yesterday, forcing
Cowell officials to find other
ways to meet their 15 percent
budget-reduction target.
But many of the alterna
tives may pass even greater
costs along to students, said
Biology Prof. Craig Heller,
chair of the external budget
committee examining Cow
ell's budget.
Such measures would
almost certainly include reduction
in after-hours care, Heller said.
That would force students who
are seriously ill at night or on
weekends to go to the emergency
room at Stanford Medical Center.
Such visits cost them $200
upfront and more if bandages or
special treatment are needed,
Heller said.
Council of Presidents member
John Overdeck and ASSU Senate
Deputy Chair Neil Crellin, mem
bers of the Student Resources and

Cowell budget committees, said
yesterday that such cuts would be
devastating to students.
Another likely cut would be the
elimination of free referral to spe
cialists for students who need
additional care.
Under Cowell's current con
tract with the School of Medicine's
Faculty Practice Program, stu
dents can, upon referral from a
Cowell physician, visit faculty spe
cialists free, and receive the neces
sary lab tests and scans. The con
tract costs Cowell about $315,000,
Heller estimates.
Under the change being consid
ered, students would be billed by
the doctors for treatment, lab tests

and scans, at the market rate.
That could cause student
health insurance premiums to
increase from $110 to $125 a
year, Crellin said. Heller con
firmed that figure last night.
The Cabinet committee "was
disinclined to the (quarterly) fee
and told us to look at other
options," Acting Vice President
for Student Resources Sally
Mahoney said last night. Cabinet
officials were skeptical because
the charge would increase the bot
tom-line amounts students pay to
attend Stanford, she said.
However, Crellin and Overdeck
said students would pay the costs
anyway, through the shifting of

the burden for medical care to
insurance premiums and stu
dents' pocketbooks.
Overdeck said students would
be better served by a tuition
increase, for which the more
needy students would still be
compensated under financial-aid
and graduate tuition-remission
programs.
Heller said Cowell will already
be reducing its Counseling and
Psychological Services and Health
Prevention Program. "But those
little things don't add up to
much," he said, "and when you
have to make cuts in emergency
care, students have to pay for it
anvway."
