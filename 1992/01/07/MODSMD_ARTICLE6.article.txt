# Budget, race relations top agenda of new VP
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
Mary Edmonds knows what it's like to
be a student.
The experienced administrator, who will
become the new vice president for student
resources March 1, has earned five degrees
at as many universities.
Edmonds earned a bachelor's at Spelman
College in biology, a degree in physical ther
apy at the University of Wisconsin, a medical
degree in Health Studies at Western Reserve
University, a doctorate in sociology at Case
Western Reserve, and a post-doctoral degree
at the University of Michigan.
As she went from graduation to gradua
tion, she came to realize that "especially for
minorities, education is really the key to suc

Edmonds brings her love of learning and
diverse educational history to her new
position as Stanford's highest ranking stu

Office of Residential Education. She will be
the highest ranking black woman adminis

In an open meeting that was held last
fall, Edmonds talked mainly about the
importance of establishing a good rapport
between the students and the faculty. "Out
of-classroom experiences are very impor
tant, as students spend two-thirds of their
time outside the classroom. We have to try
to involve the faculty (in these experiences).
"It's important to try to understand stu
dents, and focus on their needs and values.
We should graduate whole individuals, pro
ductive on both a personal and profession
al level," she said.
But Stanford's well-publicized budget
problems are what Edmonds says she will
have to focus on initially. "It is the best of
times, it is the worst of times," she said.
"It's bad in terms of media, but good in that
there's room for change. It's a challenge."
Edmonds said she will try to make the bud-
