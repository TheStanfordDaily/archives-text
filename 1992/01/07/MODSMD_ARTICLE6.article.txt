# Budget, race relations top agenda of new VP
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
Mary Edmonds knows what it's like to
be a student.
The experienced administrator, who will
become the new vice president for student
resources March 1, has earned five degrees
at as many universities.
Edmonds earned a bachelor's at Spelman
College in biology, a degree in physical ther
apy at the University of Wisconsin, a medical
degree in Health Studies at Western Reserve
University, a doctorate in sociology at Case
Western Reserve, and a post-doctoral degree
at the University of Michigan.
As she went from graduation to gradua
tion, she came to realize that "especially for
minorities, education is really the key to suc
cess."
Edmonds brings her love of learning and
diverse educational history to her new
position as Stanford's highest ranking stu
dent-services official.
And she couldn't be happier. Though she's
been nominated for the presidency of several
universities, she says she's not interested.
"I'd rather work with the students. I'm
not interested in the fund-raising aspect
that a president must deal with."
"I just got to a level that I felt comfort
able with" at Bowling Green University,

Edmonds continued. "I wasn't actively seek
ing a new position. Then Stanford called me
in July and asked me if I was interested."
The vice president position ranks above
the dean of students and below the provost
and president. Edmonds will oversee areas
such as the Financial Aids Office and the
Office of Residential Education. She will be
the highest ranking black woman adminis
trator in the University.
In an open meeting that was held last
fall, Edmonds talked mainly about the
importance of establishing a good rapport
between the students and the faculty. "Out
of-classroom experiences are very impor
tant, as students spend two-thirds of their
time outside the classroom. We have to try
to involve the faculty (in these experiences).
"It's important to try to understand stu
dents, and focus on their needs and values.
We should graduate whole individuals, pro
ductive on both a personal and profession
al level," she said.
But Stanford's well-publicized budget
problems are what Edmonds says she will
have to focus on initially. "It is the best of
times, it is the worst of times," she said.
"It's bad in terms of media, but good in that
there's room for change. It's a challenge."
Edmonds said she will try to make the bud-
get cutting process "very productive
pruning with as little bloodletting as
possible."
She said she wasn't sure of the
specifics, though, adding that she
would be more sure of her plans
in a few months. "I just know I'm
going to be working very closely
with the deans. It's a larger scope
— but not much larger — for me,"
Edmonds said.
At Stanford, Edmonds will be
managing a $25 million budget
and a staff of 300, while at Bowl
ing Green she was responsible for
a budget of $17.5 million and a
staff of 200.

"I'm just looking at the whole
structure right now, and trying to
build sturdy bridges between stu
dent resources and all the other
components of the University,"
she added.
Edmonds had been the vice
president of student affairs at
Bowling Green since 1983, after
two years as the Dean of the Col
lege of Health and Community
Services.
Cliff Boutelle, the director of
public relations at Bowling Green,
said, "We're sorry to see her
leave. She's been a strong figure
at Bowling Green since 1981, and
we'll miss her.
"Her strongest trait is her ability
to deal with race relations. She
helped develop the office of multi

cultural affairs, and has been a driv
ing force in the black history month
observance here," Boutelle added.
Edmonds herself has also spo
ken frequently about her "total
commitment to minority stu
dents." She said she was very
impressed with Stanford's com
mitment to multiculturalism,
especially the ethnic centers. "It
was one of the reasons I came to
Stanford," she said.
Bob Arrowsmith, an associate
vice president at Bowling Green
who has worked closely with
Edmonds, said that Edmonds'
departure is "bittersweet — we're
pleased she got the position, but
sorry she's going to leave. She is
really a Renaissance person, who
contributed in numerous areas."
