# Food Service revises 'wasteful' point system
## Some prices are raised; new meal plan possible 
### Scott Handleman Staff writer 
To ensure that last month's parade of students
hauling mountains of candy, juice and chocolate
chip cookies out of campus cafeterias does not hap
pen again, Food Service officials are taking steps to
modify the point system launched this fall.
Last quarter, many students accumulated a
bevy of unused points and — realizing that they
were not refundable or transferrable — bought
large quantities of nonperishable food items such
as candy and canned beverages in December.
This quarter, University Food Service raised
the prices of some selections by up to 15 cents per
item, according to Shirley Everett, associate
director of Food Service. Also, a new meal plan
with fewer points is being contemplated.
"We're not making drastic changes," Everett
said. "Students will still be able to eat nutritiously."
Sophomore Jeff Shelby had more than 300
points (equivalent to $300) leftover at the end of
fall quarter. "I spent a lot of it on junk food and
we gave a lot of it to a homeless shelter," he said.
Hilary Desmond, also a sophomore, said the
plethora of points was "a waste of money," as did

quarter with unused points, Food Service officials are modifying the system.
Derrick Suny, who said a scaled
back meal plan would "save us
money and waste less food."
Other students protested the
fact that food service was charg
ing more for the same food. "It's
disgustingly blatant," said sopho
more Carleen Chou.
Point systems were instituted
in several dorms this year, includ
ing Kimball and Stern Hall.
Virginia Varkonyi, manager of
Food Service in Stern Hall, attribut
ed the glut of remaining points to

students' cautious behavior early in
the quarter. She said students prob
ably "began to save money, not real
izing they could spend more."
Varkonyi hopes to redress this
problem by encouraging students
to use more points earlier in the
quarter, communicating to them
about the number of points
remaining on their meal cards.
Still, Varkonyi supports the hike
in prices this quarter. She says she
is reducing labor costs and operat
ing more efficiently before "passing
on a higher price" to students.
Everett elaborated, saying
prices were too low last quarter
because they often failed to
account for labor and other costs

of prepared food. In fact, she said,
Food Service could have lost
money last quarter if students
had been permitted to forward
their excess fall quarter points to
winter quarter.
Food Service prices will now be
comparable to prices at Tresidder
Union, Everett said.
Due to accounting delays, Food
Service officials will not be certain
whether they broke even for fall
quarter until the end of this month.
Another idea under considera
tion is the creation of an alterna
tive a la carte meal plan offering
fewer points than any now in exis
tence. This meal plan may be
offered spring quarter or next fall.
