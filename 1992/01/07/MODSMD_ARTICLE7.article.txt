# Food Service revises 'wasteful' point system
## Some prices are raised; new meal plan possible 
### Scott Handleman Staff writer 
To ensure that last month's parade of students
hauling mountains of candy, juice and chocolate
chip cookies out of campus cafeterias does not hap
pen again, Food Service officials are taking steps to
modify the point system launched this fall.
Last quarter, many students accumulated a
bevy of unused points and — realizing that they
were not refundable or transferrable — bought
large quantities of nonperishable food items such
as candy and canned beverages in December.
This quarter, University Food Service raised
the prices of some selections by up to 15 cents per
item, according to Shirley Everett, associate
director of Food Service. Also, a new meal plan
with fewer points is being contemplated.
"We're not making drastic changes," Everett
said. "Students will still be able to eat nutritiously."
Sophomore Jeff Shelby had more than 300
points (equivalent to $300) leftover at the end of
fall quarter. "I spent a lot of it on junk food and
we gave a lot of it to a homeless shelter," he said.
Hilary Desmond, also a sophomore, said the
plethora of points was "a waste of money," as did

Rene Magana tallies up students' meal points at Stern Hall. Because so many students ended last
quarter with unused points, Food Service officials are modifying the system.
