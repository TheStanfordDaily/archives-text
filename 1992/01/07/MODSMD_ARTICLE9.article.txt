taught fabrication to students in the physics
department machine shop for 26 years.
Kuhn has worked her way up from clerk to man

Chalkboard bomb threat at Meyer
Many people may dream of blowing up Meyer
Library, but only one has actually threatened to do
so. In the final days of fall quarter, a late-night
bomb threat added to the chaos that is Meyer dur
ing exam week.
Library employees found the anonymous threat
scribbled on a chalkboard in a second-floor class
room shortly before closing on Thursday, Dec. 12.
According to Head Librarian Michael Miller, the

room is left unlocked during library hours and is
often used as a study lounge in the evening.
The message warned that a bomb would
explode in Meyer at 10:23 p.m. on Friday, Dec. 13.
Although Miller said library employees
thought the threat was "probably a hoax," they
called the Stanford Police to the scene Thursday
evening for an exhaustive search.
Meyer opened two hours late Friday morning so
police could make a second search. Neither search
produced any bombs, and the police have no leads.

Book mixes law and poetry
Poetry can illuminate the workings of the law,
according to a new book on American poet Wal
lace Stevens by Stanford Law Prof. Thomas Grey.
Grey argues that Stevens, who was also an insur
ance lawyer, tried to separate his poetry from his
profession without success.
Although on the surface there appeared to be
little connection between the two parts of
Stevens' life, Grey says in"The Wallace Stevens
Case" that poetry can provide a unique instru
ment for scrutinizing the thought processes of
lawyers and judges.
