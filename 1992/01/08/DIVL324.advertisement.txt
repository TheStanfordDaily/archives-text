Cadet Lindsey Lack, Stanford University
"MY ARMY ROTC SCHOLARSHIP
IS PAYING OFF TWICE."
"The reason I joined ROTC was to get financial help
and to acquire practical leadership skills. The ROTC
experience has benefited me in many other ways. I
have made good friends, been motivated to stay in
good shape, improved my self-confidence, and had a
great time during training exercises. The scholarship
pays for 80% of my tuition plus books, lab fees and a
stipend of $100 per month. It's worth over $39,000."
