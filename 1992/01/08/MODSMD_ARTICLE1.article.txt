# H&S budget cuts expected to hit faculty, lecturers
## Fewer professors doing more teaching, expanded master's programs proposed 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
More teaching by fewer faculty, Fresh
man English classes led only by graduate
students, faculty-centered Cultures, Ideas
and Values courses and new master's pro
grams are among the budget ideas being
"most seriously considered" by the School
of Humanities and Sciences, Senior Assoc.
Dean Carolyn Lougee said yesterday.
Officials are finalizing plans to meet a
deficit-reduction target of $5 million in the
school's $60-million operating budget.
The school's budget planning group will
meet Friday. Next week the deans will
finalize the school's budget decisions in
consultation with a liaison team of the
Cabinet Committee for Budget and Strate
gic Planning.
"There are going to be some really sig
nificant losses — a lot of pain," Lougee
said. "But I'm very encouraged by our abil
ity to identify where it is best to make the
cuts without doing too much damage."
Lougee emphasized that final decisions
have not yet been made. But she said a num
ber of broad initiatives have emerged as very
likely candidates for implementation.
They include:
• Using faculty members to teach Cul
tures, Ideas and Values sections. "We're

working very strongly on using faculty in
CIV," Lougee said.
History Prof. Paul Seaver, chair of the
CIV program, explained that groups of fac
ulty are currently proposing new tracks
that rely on more faculty interaction.
Unlike the Great Works program,
which is almost entirely based on lecturer
taught sections, new tracks would contain
more faculty lectures, as the history and
philosophy tracks already do.
"The proposals I have seen are extreme
ly interesting. . . . Because they involve
more faculty teaching, they would save
money," Seaver said. "And the big gain will
really involve the increased faculty
involvement."
School officials had considered using
fifth- and sixth-year graduate students to
replace lecturers in the courses. But that
idea "just doesn't save a great deal of
money," Lougee said.
• Undergraduates in general may find a
larger percentage of their classes taught by
faculty members, Lougee said.
While the school will not mandate an
increased teaching load, it will probably
change the procedures under which facul
ty teaching loads are determined.
Under one of those rules, a professor

ation for cutting the Humanities and Sciences budget is a measure that would replace lecturers with graduate students in
the Freshman English program.
who teaches a course in an inter
disciplinary program currently
can have his or her departmental
teaching load lightened.
Ending that procedure proba
bly wouldn't threaten the inter
disciplinary courses, said Ted
Mitchell, special assistant to the
president and provost, because
the courses would be offered by
the departments themselves.
Lou gee said the departments
might also request that faculty
who teach some of the smaller,
more focused classes do so in addi
(ion to their regular load. "It will
require a lot closer planning of
curriculum by the faculty," she
said.
Faculty members in the school
are currently required to teach
four courses per year. The load
was changed from five to four
courses several years ago.
• Cancelling appointments of
faculty to vacant positions or to
positions that become vacant over
the next few years.
"It's inescapable that we're
going to have to leave some posi
tions vacant," Lougee said. She
said officials are studying by how
much faculty size will be reduced.
The school already has many
more faculty members than it has
billets, the result of a procedure
known as "mortgaged billeting."
Departments that have wanted to

secure a promising scholar but did
not have a billet open have made
tenure offers nevertheless, plan
ning to transfer a billet to the new
professor when another faculty
member retired.
The school has planned for
some time to bring the numbers
of billets and faculty into line, said
Mitchell. This round of budget
cuts, combined with an early
retirement program offered to
senior faculty, will accelerate that
process, he said.
In a way that process has

already begun.
Dean Ewart
Thomas said the
school has made
half as many fac
ulty appoint
ments this year
as in a typical
year.
Philosophy
Prof. Michael

Bratman, chair of the Faculty
Senate Task Force on Undergrad
uate Education, said the faculty
size is "the big issue. That is what
we are all worried about.
"It is hard to know in the short
run or the long run what the
effects (or shrinking the size of
the faculty) might be," he said.
• Using graduate students to
teach Freshman English classes.
Both lecturers and graduate stu
dents now teach the 18-student
classes.
Lougee said she does not antic
ipate terminating lecturers in
Freshman English or CIV, largely

because they have short-term
contracts. "We will try in so far as
possible to simply phase out posi
tions," she said.
Many of the teachers in Fresh
man English are already graduate
students.
"With proper supervision and
proper training, advanced gradu
ate students can do a good job,"
Bratman said.
But Ann Watters, the acting
director of the program, said she
feared Freshman English will be
"affected a great deal" because
there will be an "increased per
centage of inexperienced teachers
in the program."
Watters said it will be "difficult
to maintain the quality of the pro
gram" because there will be few
experienced teachers and"the
continuity that lecturers provide
will be lost."
Allowing graduate students to
teach more courses in the pro
gram carries the added budget
benefit of helping finance those
students' tuition.
• Offering master's programs
in many social science depart
ments. "We'll probably see a lot
more graduate students walking
around this place," Lougee said.
Several departments would
offer more professionally-oriented
training, she said.
The Communication Depart
ment has proposed the expansion
of its journalism program. The
Psychology Department may take
on more coterms.
Such master's programs have

been cited as a good way for the
University to increase revenue
because they impose few addition
al costs and typically enroll stu
dents who are paying full tuition.
In addition to the more central
initiatives Lougee described, the
school will very likely implement
significant reductions in the per
forming arts and music.
Lougee would not say whether
the Drama Department would be
closed, nor would she say whether
the Music Department would con
tinue to offer its performance-ori
ented Doctor of Musical Arts pro
gram.
But a faculty member close to
the decision said the D.M.A. pro
gram is "very, very likely" to be
eliminated.
Student music lessons will be
preserved. "They're no longer on

the table," Lougee said.
The school has used a broad
based process of consultation with
faculty, staff and students to
work on devising a budget plan by
its Jan. 17 deadline.
Three planning groups, study
ing potential reductions in the
humanities, social sciences and
natural sciences, submitted
detailed proposals to a central
school planning group in Decem
ber.
The deans and the central
planning group are preparing a
final proposal for the school.
All the schools have been
ordered to submit a comprehen
sive memorandum outlining pro
posed budget reductions to the
Cabinet Committee on Budget
and Strategic Planning by Jan.
17.

Lougee said the school's com
prehensive process of self-study
did produce many valuable bud
get-reducing ideas.
She said a school committee
produced a tentative list of possi
ble cuts in the fall. "The damage
on that list far surpassed the dam
age that we'll have with the cuts
we'll make," she said.
Still, the school's $5 million
target is "larger than I hoped it
would have been," Thomas said.
He said that although the Uni
versity Cabinet may adjust the
tentative deficit reduction targets
it assigned the schools in October,
he and the assistant deans are
assuming that theirs will not be
reduced. "It's good to take that
position, to make sure that we our
doing our level best," he said.
Thomas and the associate
deans will then face the challenge
of selling the package of budget
cuts to faculty. "It could be diffi
cult," Thomas predicted. "I'm not
underestimating that."
Thomas said he disagrees with
the criticism some faculty mem
bers have made that the school's
budget process is too dependent
on consensus.
"It is very important for facul
ty to participate in this and to
build a broad consensus,"
Thomas said. More top-down
decision-making structures have
encountered strong opposition at
other universities, he added.
