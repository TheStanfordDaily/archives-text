# H&S budget cuts expected to hit faculty, lecturers
## Fewer professors doing more teaching, expanded master's programs proposed

More teaching by fewer faculty, Fresh
man English classes led only by graduate
students, faculty-centered Cultures, Ideas
and Values courses and new master's pro
grams are among the budget ideas being
"most seriously considered" by the School
of Humanities and Sciences, Senior Assoc.
Dean Carolyn Lougee said yesterday.
Officials are finalizing plans to meet a
deficit-reduction target of $5 million in the
school's $60-million operating budget.
The school's budget planning group will
meet Friday. Next week the deans will
finalize the school's budget decisions in
consultation with a liaison team of the
Cabinet Committee for Budget and Strate
gic Planning.
"There are going to be some really sig
nificant losses — a lot of pain," Lougee
said. "But I'm very encouraged by our abil
ity to identify where it is best to make the
cuts without doing too much damage."
Lougee emphasized that final decisions
have not yet been made. But she said a num
ber of broad initiatives have emerged as very
likely candidates for implementation.
They include:
• Using faculty members to teach Cul
tures, Ideas and Values sections. "We're

working very strongly on using faculty in
CIV," Lougee said.
History Prof. Paul Seaver, chair of the
CIV program, explained that groups of fac
ulty are currently proposing new tracks
that rely on more faculty interaction.
Unlike the Great Works program,
which is almost entirely based on lecturer
taught sections, new tracks would contain
more faculty lectures, as the history and
philosophy tracks already do.
"The proposals I have seen are extreme
ly interesting. . . . Because they involve
more faculty teaching, they would save
money," Seaver said. "And the big gain will
really involve the increased faculty
involvement."
School officials had considered using
fifth- and sixth-year graduate students to
replace lecturers in the courses. But that
idea "just doesn't save a great deal of
money," Lougee said.
• Undergraduates in general may find a
larger percentage of their classes taught by
faculty members, Lougee said.
While the school will not mandate an
increased teaching load, it will probably
change the procedures under which facul
ty teaching loads are determined.
