Attacks on Stanford
deflect attention from
Navy mismanagement

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS
well into year two of its
attacks on Stanford's indi
rect-cost recovery practices.
Defense Department auditors now
allege that Stanford overcharged
the government by $230 million
between 1980 and 1988.
Investigations by the represen
tatives of an elected government
are justified. But the zeal with
which the Office of Naval Research
is trying to recoup money also
serves the expedient purpose of
cloaking the military's own
responsibility for this debacle.
Thus far, the government has
successfully portrayed itself as the
unwitting victim of nefarious uni
versities like Stanford. Harping on
items real — the infamous yacht
— and imagined — the $7,000
sheets — the investigation begun
by Paul Biddle has painted a
tawdry picture of a university
milking the government's cash
cow. This approach effectively
turns attention away from the real
issue, the manner of allocating
indirect costs.
It is important to clarify what
indirect costs are. On a research
project, an outside party cannot
simply pay for the marginal cost of
a professional researcher. That
researcher can generally only
accomplish her objectives by draw
ing on the resources of the univer
sity, which are costly.
Part of the price of any research
project is derived from indirect
costs. Figuring indirect cost is a
highly nebulous and variable cal
culation, but one which is used in
every producer organization,
whether the product is disposable
diapers or SDI.
What the government prefers to
ignore is that it formally agreed to
the indirect-cost rate used by Stan

ford — not just once, but close to
100 separate times, as evidenced in
memoranda of understanding that
it now seeks to cancel. Indeed, the
$230 million Stanford allegedly
owes is the difference between the
indirect-cost percentage agreed to
by the federal government in the
past and the percentage it would
like to impose retroactively now.
(Stanford has already repaid the
government for the disallowed
items.)
To justify walking away from
the government's contractual
agreements, Biddle claims that the
"cozy" relationship between Stan
ford and past Office of Naval
Research officials inhibited the
government's control of the pro
cess. The demotions and forced
retirements of those previously in
Biddle's position are supposed to
be evidence for this allegation.
If the government wishes to
charge corruption, it should do so
openly. But using the alleged
incompetence of individual mili
tary officials to smear Stanford is
scurrilous.
The government was not a naive
customer of Stanford's research ser
vices — a yokel stuck buying over
priced goods. It did not simply pay
whatever the university asked. Far
from it. It has, instead, been a high
ly sophisticated contractor for ser
vices for which it can bargain with a
number of academic institutions.
One purpose of contracts is to
make commerce possible, by
ensuring that parties stick to their
agreements. Changing the rules of
play mid-game is unfair to institu
tions, like Stanford, which honest
ly and openly entered into those
agreements.
At a time when the end of the
Cold War has made our country's
defense budget appear absurdly
bloated, complaining about uni
versities taking advantage of the
government is a way for the mili
tary to cover its own assets.
Passing the buck to Stanford
may serve the navy's short-term
interest, but it helps no one in the
long run.
