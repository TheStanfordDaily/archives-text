Media should report on new religious ideas, not dogma

The media seems driven
recently to burden the minds of
America with outdated religious
intolerance. In the past year, Time,
Newsweek and U.S. News & World
Report have published cover stories deal
ing with topics such as evil, prayer, sex
and religion, and the existence of God.
Why these magazines cover their
pages with outmoded philosophical
inquiries rather than the news they
claim to report is an important question.
These magazines seem to be hoping they
can effect changes in America by giving
such articles the importance they have.
It is well known that over the last few
decades people have grown much freer
in their religious beliefs. People have
been able to see past the dogma that has
kept them prisoner for so long and to

recognize that spirituality need not
always be in the form of hierarchies and
commandments.
It has become evident that guilt-based
religions cannot fulfill one spiritually,
and that to achieve harmony with those
around you, open-mindedness is crucial.
The media should strive to foster this
kind of open-mindedness, but they have
not.
The moods of the articles currently in
the media are not in keeping with the
times. The articles are very concerned
with questions such as "What will God
do to me if I sin?" This may have been
an appropriate query when people were
still trapped in cages of dogma, but
today people should be encouraged to
free themselves from these modes of
thought and be allowed to express them

selves without fear of offending some fic
titious deity in the clouds.
Increasingly, it has become the real
ization that to help fellow human beings
and to give of yourself to the community
is what true "religion" is all about, and
that it is not necessary to count up khar
ma points, or constantly seek forgiveness
for the supposed sins of Adam and Eve.
The media should strive to keep up
with these realizations and keep from
getting bogged down in old-fashioned
moralistic debates such as the definition
of evil. Discussions of that nature belong
in the early parts of the century, not in
this time of budding enlightenment.
Likewise, running a cover story on
praying is no longer interesting. Educat
ed people of today should be less con
cerned with how to debase themselves in

front of some omnipotent being than
with how they might grow spiritually by
communicating meaningfully with other
people.
It is evident that these magazines are
striving to return America to its stricter,
more confining modes of religious
thought. I hope they are unsuccessful.
News magazines should either stick to
the news, and let philosophical journals
take care of God, or they should be truly
at the forefront of religion, reporting on
the changes in America from worries
about sin and evil to hopes for all human
ity working together in the realization
that we are here now, and that we may as
well do what we can to make the here and
now as beautiful as possible.
