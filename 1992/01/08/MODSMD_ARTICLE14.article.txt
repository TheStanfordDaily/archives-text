# Jewish Studies thrive at Stanford, exciting opportunities abound
## 
### 
As the new director of Stanford's
Jewish Studies Program, I want to
thank The Daily for the story about our
program in its Nov. 18 issue. I wanted to
express concern, however, about the
notion that Stanford's Jewish Studies
Program — which The Daily acknowl
edges is impressive academically — is
sadly short of students. It "thrives
despite obstacles," the article
announces.
The fact is that student enrollment in
Jewish Studies courses this fall — most
of them in the History and Religious
Studies Departments — was, in fact,
quite impressive: A total of some 150
students enrolled in "Introduction to
• Judaism," "Jewish History from 1492 to
the Present," "Beginning Hebrew,"

"Intermediate Hebrew" and "History of
Zionism."
We estimate that over the last three or
four years more than 1,000 students have
taken Jewish Studies courses, including
the survey of American Judaism that, if
past patterns hold, will probably draw
more than 100 students this spring.
I should note, in conclusion, that our
graduate student population of 10 is by
no means meager, as The Daily implied,
but quite impressive given the lack of
designated fellowships and the fact that
most of the faculty likely to attract grad
uate students arrived at Stanford only
within the last year.
The story well captured the excite
ment we all feel at our new and interdis
ciplinary venture. Let me urge any stu
dents interested in joining us to contact
me or other faculty members. We are
still a small enough program to encour
age in-depth interaction with our stu
dents. I hope we always will be.
