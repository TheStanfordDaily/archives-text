## Buchanan — Duke rerun 
### 
I HAD A DREAM THE OTHER DAY. I
saw Patrick Buchanan going into a
phone booth, and out came David
Duke, with costume and all.
David Duke claims to be a born-again
Christian, and Patrick Buchanan wants
prayer in school; Duke is against the civil
rights movement, while Buchanan intends
to put an end to affirmative action; Duke
blames all evils of society on welfare, where
as Buchanan would like to reduce taxes and
cut social spending; Duke thinks black, Jew
ish and Asian people are the source of Amer
ica's trouble, and Buchanan proposes the
building of a 200-mile-long trench along the
U.S-Mexico border.
One shouts "America First," the other
proclaims "First America." With all those
similarities, no wonder I have trouble
telling them apart.
All Duke's blatant slogans and
Buchanan's evasive reasoning really boil
down to are a couple of very basic ques
tions. It is about the who and what of
America. Namely, who belongs to this
country? What future does she hold?
When asked to justify his ideas on
immigration, Buchanan replies that
America has a predominantly white
Christian heritage; tht-T f ore, it is only
natural for America to have an immigra
tion policy that prefers European set
tlers, instead of Asian, African or Latin
American ones.
Although African- and Asian-Ameri

cans have made enormous contributions to
the growth of America, one cannot deny
the basic accuracy of Buchanan's premises.
America was indeed founded upon West
ern ideals and Western institutions. Amer
icans excel at Western endeavors whether
it is art, science or sports. However,
Buchanan also assumes that America will
continue to be uniformly dominated by
Western civilization, and to many that
remains an open question.
To the Dukes and Buchanans of this
world, the situation in the '90s has obvious
ly gotten too un-American and un-Western.
With rapid growth of the Asian and Hispan
ic populations, there is a perceived threat to
the purity of American heritage.
As Buchanan once so eloquently stat
ed, if you had but one Zulu immigrant, he
would soon blend into the native popula
tion, but if one million Zulu people immi
grated, you would end up with a Zulu
colony.
The question of who belongs to Amer
ica is one to be answered by her citizens.
In the past few years, many ethnic
groups have become more aware of their
own unique identities and cultural her
itages. Many are wrestling with the ques
tion of to be or not to be melted. They are
beginning to explore the possibility of a
nation with multiple cultural compo
nents, coexisting with and absorbing from
each other.
Those alternative choices have thus far

been generally tolerated and even wel
comed. American people understand very
well the explosiveness of the issues of race
and cultural difference. That knowledge
comes not only from her own history of
tumultuous racial conflict and confronta
tion, but also from the daily drama being
played in ethnically divided Yugoslavia.
As the structure of the population
changes — due to both the composition of
immigration waves and the differing birth
rates of existing groups — whether that
general attitude of tolerance will continue
during times of economic difficulties
remains to be seen.
David Duke advocates racial intoler
ance, and he is not without his support
ers. In fact, it took a multimillion dollar
television barrage, appeals from many
Louisiana celebrities and the threat of
possible ruin to the state's tourist indus
try to keep David Duke out of the
Louisiana governor's mansion.
Now it is Patrick Buchanan's turn.
With no burden of the past and a more
positive image, what reaction will he
draw from the American people?
