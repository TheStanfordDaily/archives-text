## Leaders of the Pac Bruins, 'Cats are tops in conference 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
If the men's basketball team isn't
exactly sure how good they are after an 8-
1 pre-league schedule, the treacherous
Pacific 10 Conference season will certain
ly tell them.
The young Cardinal has defeated
NCAA tournament hopefuls Rice, Col
orado and Virginia, and narrowly lost to
No. 12 Michigan State — but with 19
games left an NCAA tournament bid is too
far down a winding road to see.
Stanford opens its 18-game Pac-10
schedule Thursday at Oregon State, with
hopes of topping last year's 8-10, fifth
place performance. A winning league
record should get the Cardinal into the
NCAA tournament.
"The league is very good and has gotten
better every year," coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "Oregon has had some bad
luck with injuries, but everybody else is
improved over last year.
"UCLA is extremely talented and play
ing very well right now, and everybody
knows how strong Arizona is. Obviously,
those two teams stand out at this point."
In a preseason coaches poll, five picked
both Arizona and UCLA, while Stanford
was selected eighth behind Arizona State,
USC, Washington State, California and
Oregon State.
"Everybody knows where each other
stacks up. We won't sneak up on any
body," guard Peter Dukes said.
A preview of the Pac-10 conference
with predicted order of finish:
1. UCLA (23-9 overall, 11-7 and second in
the Pac-10 in 1990-91). Most of John
Wooden's championship teams at UCLA
had less talent than last year's Bruins, yet
they lost to 13th-seed Penn State in the
first round of the NCAA tournament.
The most talented team in the nation,
the Bruins and coach Jim Harrick are
fighting to avoid becoming the most
underachieving team in the nation for the
second year in a row. UCLA returns all
five starters from last year, and is ranked
second in the nation with an 8-0 record
with wins over Indiana and Georgia (not
to mention Fullerton, Long Beach and
San Diego State).
Returning All-Pac-10 performers Don
Mac Lean (23.0 points, 7.3 rebounds per
game last year) and Tracy Murray (21.2
points) are a high-octane offensive tan
dem at forward, while Darrick Martin
brings quickness and experience to the
point guard position.
Off-guard Gerald Madkins is most
acclaimed for being underrated, but he
complements the flashier Bruins with
tenacious defense and solid zone-busting
shooting.
The most dangerous Bruin, 6-foot-8 Ed
O'Bannon, is questionable after re-injur
ing his knee. O'Bannon, who plays basket
ball like he came from Michael Jordan's
planet, not Earth, sat out his first year
with a serious knee injury.
With swingman Mitchell Butler and
All-Pac-10 freshman Shon Tarver coming
off the bench, the Bruins may legitimate

ly have more talent on the bench than
most Pac-10 teams do on the floor. If
UCLA doesn't win the Pac-10 with this
much talent, Harrick should think about
working for the government.
2. Arizona (28-7 overall, 14-4 and Pac-10
champs in 1990-91). The Wildcats and sil
very coach Lute Olson seek their fourth
consecutive Pac-10 crown, returning
seven of their top nine scorers from a year
ago.
Power forward Brian Williams went
pro, but the Tucson Skyline still towers
over the Pac-10. Center Sean Rooks (11.9
points, 5.7 rebounds per game last year)
could be a first-round NBA pick, and he
gets a lot of help inside from seven-footer
Ed Stokes and 6-8 Wayne Womack.
Sophomore point guard Khalid
Reeves and junior Chris Mills give the
top-10 Wildcats almost as much talent
as UCLA. Even though guard Matt Oth
ick looks like Ricky Schroeder, he can
shoot treys better than the Silver
Spoons star.
The Wildcats have a nation-best 64
game home win streak dating back to
1987, but will be challenged this weekend
at the McKale Center by USC and UCLA.
3. Arizona State (20-10, 10-8 and tied
for third in the Pac-10 in 1990-91). Coach
Bill Frieder has turned the Sun Devil pro
gram around in two years. His talented
unit has hopes of a second-straight NCAA
tournament appearance.
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year Jamal
Faulkner (15.4 points per game) typifies
the young, high-tempo team. Faulkner
was one of four starters suspended in the
early season for telephone credit card mis
use, and the team struggled, losing to Rice
and Kentucky.
Barkleyesque center Isaac Austin and
guard Tarence Wheeler are gone, so the
Sun Devils may be a year away from
greatness. But with Faulkner back, mak
ing his phone calls collect, the Devils may
ring up some big charges on the slower
Pac-10 competition.
4. USC (19-10, 10-8 and tied for third in
the Pac-10 in 1990-91). Can anyone stop
guard Harold Miner? Fifth-ranked Ohio
State couldn't, as the major Miner beat
the Buckeyes from all over the floor.
With just one loss, the Trojans are
ranked No. 22 and looking for another
NCAA visit. Miner, the Pac-10's leading
scorer a year ago, has extended his range
to the outlying areas of Orange and San
Bernadino Counties.
Miner, like Adam Keefe, will be triple
teamed in the Pac-10, and the Trojans
don't have the horses inside to run with
Arizona and UCLA.
5. Stanford (20-13, 8-10 and tied for fifth
in the Pac-10).Stanford was picked to fin
ish eighth in the preseason coaches poll,
but Keefe has been even better than
expected, Marcus Lollie has been flawless
at the point and Dukes has emerged as the
much-needed outside threat.
If Stanford can get some inside help
and relief for Keefe, the Cardinal could
finish as high as third. But if Keefe wears
down and the outside shooting fades,
Stanford could fade toward the bottom.

Fifth place, a 10-8 record, should get
Stanford into the NCAA tournament.
6. Washington State (16-12, 8-10, fifth).
The Cougars piled up a perfect 11-0 record
in the early going, beating powerhouses
like Central Connecticut State and Okla
homa Baptist, but don't expect them to do
any better than last year, when they lost
six of their last seven.
The Cougars return all five starters
and ten lettermen including Cardinal
killing sharpshooter Bennie Seltzer, but
with dough-boy center Brian Paine, they
are soft inside.
7. Oregon State (14-14, 8-10, fifth). The
Beavers always seem to play better than
they look on paper, but new faces will
have to get the job done in coach Jim
Anderson's third year.
Top scorers Will Brantley and Teo
Alibegovic graduated, leaving senior

swingman Leßoy Jackson (11.7 points,
5.1 boards in 4990-91) and a quintet of
solid players behind. The Beavers will be a
tough team to beat, especially at home.
8. Da Bears (13-15, 8-10, fifth). They've
got lots of fabulous freshmen and Brian
Treggs as a flamboyant spokesman, but
California doesn't have the muscle to
make it through the Pac-10 schedule.
Their trash-talking Big Game defeat will
haunt the Bears through the basketball
season, and they've jinxed themselves by
moving two home games to the Oakland
Coliseum.
Tied for last. Washington and Oregon
(27-29, 9.5 th place in the Pac-10 last
year). Washington returns no starters
from last year's cellar squad, while the
Ducks and colorful coach Don Munson,
the only Pac-10 team with a losing record,
have been decimated by injuries.


Al Green — Daily file
More spine-tingling shots like this Adam Keefe dunk may help the team challenge the
top squads in the Pacific 10 Conference. UCLA and Arizona State are favored to win
the Pac-10.
