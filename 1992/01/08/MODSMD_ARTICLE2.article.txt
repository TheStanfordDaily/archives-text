# Employees to examine health benefits
## New groups will advise administrators on rate-structure change 
### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
Responding to widespread dis
satisfaction over the new rate
structure for employee health
benefits, the University will form
temporary focus groups and a per
manent employee roundtable to
look at the issue.
Glenn Peacock, spokesperson
for Stanford Employees for Equi
ty, said his group was pleased
with the development.
"Soliciting employee input is
revolutionary at Stanford," he
said. "It's wonderful."
Over winter break, Human
Resources administrators an
nounced the formation of 13 tem
porary focus groups to specifically
address the health benefits
change and a permanent employ
ee roundtable "that will provide
ongoing input on a consultative

basis" to Human Resources,
according to Benefits Manager
Jim Franklin.
The groups are part of a Uni
versity promise "to step back and
and take another look" at the con
cerns of faculty and staff before
implementing the health benefits
change in March.
Last fall, the University
announced that health benefit
rates would be decreased for mar
ried employees and raised for sin
gle employees, who previously
paid nothing. The change, officials
said, was made to lower the cost of
benefits and to improve the bene
fits program by fostering competi
tion among companies providing
health plans.
Campus outcry was immediate.
Employees protested what was
seen as the University favoring
the married lifestyle over others.
In response, Barbara Butter

field, vice president for human
resources, circulated a letter to all
employees announcing her inten
tion to rethink the changes and
promising to include employees in
the decision-making process.
Over the next week, the 13
newly-formed focus groups will
consider the initial plan announced
in October as well as five other
methods of changing the health
benefits rates while still meeting
the University's original goals.
Randomly selected staff and
faculty members comprise most of
the groups, while a few are com
posed of staff and retirees who had
expressed their concerns to admin
istrators, according to Franklin.
Their recommendations will be
passed along to the roundtable,
which will consider them and
report to the Committee on Fac
ulty/Staff Benefits, Franklin said.
The Committee on Faculty/

Staff Benefits then passes their
recommendations along to the
president and the provost, who
will make the final decision,
according to Jeremy Warren, act
ing director of human resources.
Despite the new developments,
Peacock said his group still has
some reservations.
"The cynic in me says that there
are so many layers that no one will
be saddled with the blame for the
final decision," he said. "They
could just stick with what they
announced in October, and it will
be a lot harder to point fingers."
Peacock said he was also con
cerned that the new employee
roundtable has no actual power
and serves only in an advisory
capacity.
According to Warren, the
roundtable will provide employee
input to Human Resources on a
permanent basis. The University,
he said, is committed to main
taining a diverse cross-section of
staff members on the roundtable.
"We also looked more toward
the middle and lower ends of
administration for nominations,"
he said, citing the need to avoid
staff members who already had
decision-making capacity within
the University.
