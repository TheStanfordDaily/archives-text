### George Malone Staff writer 
Kristin Klein capped off one
of the greatest seasons (not to
mention careers) in Stanford
women's volleyball history on
Monday with her most presti
gious award yet, the 1991
Asics/Volleyball Monthly Divi
sion I Player of the Year.
The 6-0 hitter from Pacific
Palisades, Calif., had her best
year at Stanford as she broke
the Pacific 10 Conference all
time kill mark and led the 30-2
Cardinal in kills, digs, aces and
hitting percentage. She was
named the Pac-10 Player of the
Year and became the career
digs leader at Stanford.
"Kristin had a heck of a year
â€” the kind of year worthy of
this type of honor," Stanford
head coach Don Shaw said.
"She really stood out, and not
just in terms of statistics. She
had a lot to do with getting play
ers motivated and leading the
team in practice and during
games. She's a special athlete."
Volleyball Monthly called
Klein "the heart and soul of the
Cardinal."
Klein spent last summer
playing for the U.S.National
"B" team at the World Univer
sity and Pan American Games,
gaining international experi
ence and improving her game.
The extra work made a differ
ence as she captained Stanford
to 27 consecutive wins to start
the year, including an 18-0
record in Pac-10 play. She hit

.323 for the season with 510
kills and 372 digs.
Junior Bev Oden was also
named a first team Ail-Ameri
can by Volleyball Monthly, and
both Klein and Oden were
selected first team Ail-Ameri
cans by the American Volley
ball Coaches' Association. Oden
hit .291 for the year and aver
aged 1.5 blocks per game. In
addition both players were
invited to work out with the
National "A" Team with a
chance of joining the 1992
Olympic team.
Klein and Oden were joined
on the first team All-American
by Antoinette White of Long
Beach State, Pauline Manser of
New Mexico, Monique Adams
of LSU, Melanie Beckenhauer-
Heller of Pacific and Natalie
Williams of UCLA.
