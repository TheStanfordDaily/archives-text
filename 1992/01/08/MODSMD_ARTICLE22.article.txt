# From Golden to Bad News — ex-Bear head coach bungles decision to leave
## Cardinal coach Denny Green handles options professionally 
### 
Ex-California coach Bruce Snyder is 0-3
against Denny Green, and though the
football season is finished, he continues to
lose. The bowls now over, attention turns to
the wooing season, that special time of the
year when "Hot" college coaches are
approached by needy programs. Both Green
and Snyder have been contacted for other
jobs. Green is undecided, Snyder has left.
In a surprising and bungled move, Snvder
has become the new coach at Arizona State.
The decision is surprising because it came so
suddenly; bungled because he let it become a
surprise. Sure there were rumors, but Snyder
brushed them off, and it all seemed moot:
Coach Snyder, what about the ASU job?
"Not gonna do it,"the man's actions
replied.
But Coach we hear there is an awful lot of
money involved.
"Not gonna do it," his silence on the matter
seemed to say, "not gonna."
Wouldn't be prudent, huh Bruce? Last year
he was the Pacific 10 Conference Co-Coach of
the Year after leading the Bears to a 7-4-1
record and a victory in the Copper Bowl, Cal's
first since 1979. This year the Bears were even
better and everything seemed pretty rosy (pun
intended) up in Berkeley. The students loved
him, the media loved him and the players
loved him. Everyone seemed happy with
Bruce Snyder as the head coach, excpect per
haps the guy who had the job.
"Coach, your team just capped off a suc
cessful 10-2 season with a decisive Citrus
Bowl victory and a top-10 national ranking.
What are you going to do now?"
Expecting to hear Disney World, Bear
backers got Tempe instead. Even Goofy could
have been more responsible.
A surprise to even his players and coaching
staff, the Bruce Snyder show moved to ASU.
Can't really blame the guy — a half million

dollar salary and vast expanses of ultra mod
ern facilities are hard to turn down. The fact
that the Sun Devils consistently draw 50,000
fans win or lose isn't bad either. What is bad is
the way in which the man went about his busi
ness. Hush-hush turned out to be a no-no in
terms of public relations. The people who
loved him scant weeks ago, now feel betrayed.
The papers are filled with criticism and Cal
students are pissed, and not because he decid
ed to leave the school. In college coaching, as
in any profession, trying to find a better job is
natural.
"The environment of college athletics is
tenuous at best," said Stanford sports infor
mation director Gary Migdol. "People have no
problem with a coach seeking other options."
No problems unless it is carried out the
wrong way, which brings us to our own back
yard. Though the Aloha Bowl loss failed to
raise his Stanford record to .500 (he is 16-18
on The Farm), Green is very much in
demand After completing his 1989 inaugural
season at 3-8, Green has guided the team to
an 8-4 record this year that included the bowl
birth and a No. 22 ranking in the final polls.
Under his control the Cardinal is 11-4 in
their last 15 games going back to the 1990
season. It's not a mountain, but the old Stan
ford molehill is starting to peak and people
have noticed. Turnovers are more common
on NFL sidelines than on the field, and that

regeneration has the pros knocking on
Denny's door.
But unlike the man he opposed in the 94th
Big Game, Green is handling himself in a
manner that seems to be pleasing all involved.
In the wake of the Snyder decision, Stanford
Athletic Director Ted Leland sent out a press
release to that effect:
"Stanford University and the Stanford
Athletic Department have been very
impressed with the professional nature in
which Denny Green has handled his current
situation," Leland wrote. "Denny has been
up-front, fair and straightforward in his
actions and conversations with professional
organizations and other universities. I have
no problem whatsoever with the way Denny
has handled this situation. He has kept me
informed the entire way."
Leland went on to say that college sports
exist in an uncertain atmosphere, and that he
believed coaches should be able to seek other
opportunities. Talking to students and players
no one seems to hold a grudge, they are all just
interested in what the outcome will be.
Will he go or not is a matter of debate.
Denny might take the prestige and money of
the NFL or he might stay and keep building
the program he revived. Leland said in his
release that he thinks Green will stay, an atti
tude that many in the athletic department
share. Yet, others seem to think that he has
been looking for a promotion to the pros since
the day he first stepped on campus.
Whatever the case may be, at least Snyder
has taught us that anything can happen. If
Denny Green does decide to leave, the Cardi
nal faithful may be sad, but they won't feel
deceived in the process.
Denny 4, Bruce 0.
