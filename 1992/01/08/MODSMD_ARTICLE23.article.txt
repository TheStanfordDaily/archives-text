## Kennedy says he will pursue science after stepping down 
### Julie Makinen Editorial staff 
Editor's note: This is the first of a two
part interview with University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy.
QNow that you 're stepping down
from the chair of University president,
what will you do next ? Will you return to
"hard-core" science or do something
else?
Al For the past 12 years, the only
pro bono activities outside Stanford
that I've done while I've been president
have been involved in creating and help
ing non-governmental organizations
that work between government and
industry on questions related to envi
ronment, health and safety.
So, for example, I worked to help form
an organization called the Health Effects
Institute, which has been a broker of uni
versity research on mobile sources of
emissions and their health effects —
ozone, diesel particulates, etc. . . .
Basically, that activity has involved
building institutions to deal with prob
lems when government and industry
seem to be at odds. . . .
Now, having come to the end of this
passage in my life, I had to do some hard
thinking about what I cared most about
in the world and where I could make
some use of my training and experience
and talents.
And I decided that I wanted to go
back to doing more biology but more the
kind of biology I did earlier, that focused
more on natural history and related
issues, including biodiversity and
preservation, but not limited to those
things because I'm also concerned about
environmental problems, toxic sub
stances, acid rain.
I think that if I concentrate in the
area where environmental biology and
public policy come together, that com
bines the things I know most about with
the problems I think are the most
important to solve if the world is going
to be the kind of world we want to live
in. So, that's what I'm going to do.

I'm going to be on sab
batical next year, to
develop some of my
teaching skills and read
myself back into compe
tence and do some arm
twisting and schmoozing
with faculty people that
I'd like to get involved.'

Q: Specifically, does that mean
you're going to be here, doing what?
A!That means I'm going to be here.
I think that you've got to have — as part
of a successful program to change the
way we deal with these problems — a
good education component.
I've been invited to develop a piece of
this new Earth Systems course, and I'm
going to do that.
The first year I'll have some teaching
role, and I'm thinking of developing a
course of my own, and I will work over
in the Institute for International Stud
ies trying to put together a group ... of
people with an interdisciplinary interest
in environmental policy.
I hope that will include biologists,
people from the Center for Conserva
tion Biology, chemists, engineers, earth
scientists and above all economists and
other social scientists who will worry
about how to get organized on how to
solve these problems.
I'm going to be on sabbatical next
year, to develop some of my teaching
skills and read myself back into compe
tence and do some arm-twisting and
schmoozing with faculty people that I'd
like to get involved.
Ql In your life, you've worn many
different hats — you've been a research
scientist, a teacher, head of the Food
and Drug Administration and universi

ty president, just to name a few of your
pursuits. What have you learned from
these various roles? Have they each sat
isfied different aspects of your personal
ity?
A. I Yes, but it's hard to say explicit
ly. I can tell you that in the mid "70s as
I became more engaged with my teach
ing in the Human Biology Program, I
got more and more interested not only
in policy, but also with what you could
do with students, especially in
approaching problems . . . and a little
bit less interested in what I was doing in
the laboratory.
From there it was a relatively short
er step to saying, "Gee, I really think it
would be good for me to try something
different from academic life, to get into
the policy-making arena and see what
it's like and then perhaps carry back to
my teaching a better knowledge and
understanding of what it's like at the
applications end.
People thought it was a little odd that
I took the FDA job because that's a very
down and dirty job. It's not like being
director of the National Science Foun
dation or White House Science Adviser.
Those are sort of imperial, "clean" jobs.
This one involved a lot of give and
take with Congress, a lot of regulatory
controversy . . . and lots of management
challenges. A lot of the constituency for
that organization was out in the agri
cultural parts of the country.
So, I would find myself at a whole
hog barbecue in Lemars, lowa, explain
ing our policy about sulfur residues in
swine, or touring a chicken rendering
plant in North Carolina . . . listening to
people complain about regulation of the
poultry industry.
It was really good to get out of this
wonderful place and get into some of
those places; it really changes your view
of the world. (The experience) gave me
exactly what I wanted, a change of scene
— it was refreshing, and I think I
learned a lot more about how difficult it
is to apply good ideas that win all the
time in the seminar room to real situa
tions.
