# NASA scientists teach 'Life in Space'
## Course marks 20th year of exploring everything from astronauts to E.T.

Does extraterrestrial intelligence exist?
What would it be like to be stuck in a gigan
tic tin can for a whole year with only two other
people to talk to?
Are U.S. colonies on Mars merely science
fiction?
These are some of the questions that are
studied in "Life in Space," an innovative collo
quium being offered this quarter by scientists
from NASA's Ames Research Center at Mof
fett Field.
"This class tends to take snapshots of all
the different interesting areas of life in space
where there is research going on," according
to Ames scientist John Billingham, who has
done extensive research on extraterrestrial
intelligence and is the chief organizer of the
course.
"We include in the course people who are
intimately involved in researching various
aspects of life in space," explained Billingham,
who has taught the course for the last 20

years. "It's very interdisciplinary. 'Life in
Space' permeates all subjects."
The course covers group interaction in
space, including astronaut training on over
coming the psychological strain of being con
fined in a space vehicle. Examining the space
program from biological, physiological and
psychological angles, the course also includes
material on space biology, habitability in space
and the origin of life on earth.
According to Alan Hargens, the course
gives students an overview of life on earth and
how it has evolved under the influence of grav
ity, then focuses on what happens when peo
ple go into space and that influence.
Hargens teaches the sections on cardiovas
cular and musculo-skeletal effects of micro
gravity. "It examines what the physiological
and psychological problems are for people who
go into space and what needs to be done about
them."
Sophomore Jeff Ota, who took the course
last winter, spent his summer doing research
for Hargens at Ames. "It's just an amazing
course," said Ota, who declared aero

nautics/astronautics after taking the class.
Throughout the years the course has
changed to reflect shifts in government policy
and breakthroughs in research. Billingham
said, "In the last five years, the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence became a reality
instead of just a concept. We were approved
three years ago, and now we're building
machines which look into the microwave
region of the radio spectrum for signals that
might be transmitted by other civilizations in
the galaxy.
Although the colloquium is primarily com
posed of undergraduates, "We have students
ranging from freshmen to post-doctorates,"
according to Aeronautics/Astronautics Prof. I-
Dee Chang, the Stanford coordinator for the
course. "Professors often sit in."
"People are explorers. There's something
in us which says we want to know more" said
Billingham, explaining the universal appeal of
space exploration. "Space is a challenge. . . .
It's an immense arena that's so big that it's
very hard to imagine here from this little, tiny
planet."
