# Female RCCs are few and far between
## 
### Lida Chaipat Staff writer 
Only four of this year's 27 res
ident computer coordinators are
female. Last year only one was.
Only 20 percent of Stanford's
computer science majors are
women.
At a school where equality of
the sexes is trumpeted, these
statistics may sound surprising.
Is it discrimination? Are women
less suited for the job? According
to the people involved in comput
er science, the answer seems to be
cultural.
The notion that women gener
ally aren't as good as men in tech
nical subjects "has been beaten
down so long that it is just accept
ed," Madera RCC Stephanie
Cawthon said.
Many people feel that women
are less interested in technical
fields than men. Cawthon
believes it's a case of a self-fulfill
ing prophesy. "It's the old stereo
type at work," she said. "A lot of
people are really surprised to find
that I am an RCC.
"It's not normal; it's some
thing completely different," she
continued. "I went to an all-girls
Catholic school where there are
no computers at all. I don't think
that would have happened if
there had been boys."
Nick Parlante, a lecturer in the
Computer Science Department,
said, "I don't think that there is
anything innately different
(between men's and women's abil
ities). It's more of a social custom."

Seth Pollack, a teaching assis
tant for Computer Science 106 X
agreed. "Young women aren't
encouraged to get interested in
math, and it's even more so for
computer science because at least
math is required in high school."
Pollack added that once
women get into computer science
classes "they usually do equally
well. They tend to answer their
fair share of questions."
This cultural phenomenon
seems to be reflected in the num
ber of applications submitted last
year for the position of RCC. Only
seven out of last year's 67 appli
cants were women.
But, the female applicants may
be of higher quality than the men:
While four out of seven women
(57 percent) received the job, only
23 out of 60 men (38 percent)
received positions.
Special efforts are being made
to find women interested in being
RCCs. "Last year, we targeted the
Women's Society for Engineering
and Computer Sciences," said
Diane Thomasson, programmer
analyst for Residential Computer
Resources. At the presentation
that she gave to the society,
Thomasson was surprised to find
that "a good number didn't even
know that our program existed.
"I was so shocked. Even
though they used the clusters,
they didn't know what an RCC
was," Thomasson said. Even
those women who did know
"didn't make the connection that
they could do it."
Thomasson, who is responsible

for coordinating RCC selection,
said, "Departments that are tech
nically based need to make an
extra effort to recruit women."
Nevertheless, Okada RCC
Michelle Lin foresees a brighter
future. "There is a growing num
ber of women in computer sci
ence," she said. Lin noted that in
her computer science classes
"there is a differential based on

your ability (not on gender)."
Cawthon believes that "if we
could just get more women to be
TAs in computer classes," more
female students would be encour
aged to study computer science.
As for her reasons for becoming an
RCC, Cawthon said she wanted
"to help people get started" and
"especially to get the girls not to
rely on other people all the time."
