# Bug checks out pink ooze, cordless phones

You define a good flight by
the negatives: You didn't get
hijacked, you didn't crash, you
didn't throw up, you weren't
late, you weren't nauseated by
the food. So you are grateful.
— Paul Theroux
Q. Before my plane left the
• airport in New Jersey (It
was coooold!) they rinsed the
plane with a pink liquid. What
is this stuff?
A .Without the pink stuff,
• you wouldn't be grateful
for your flight! Because ice and
functional aircraft are not com
patible, airlines use de-icing
agents to remove the ice.
De-icing agents are similar
to the chemicals in automobile
antifreeze. These chemicals
remain liquid at freezing tem
peratures, are noncorrosive and
evaporate quickly.
Unfortunately, ice often
accumulates when the plane is
airborne and de-icing agents
can't be used. If enough ice
builds up on an airplane wing,
it will turn your flight into a
ride that makes Great America
seem like an amusement park
for the geriatric set.
Mechanical rather than
chemical means dislodge ice in
flight. One of the more promis
ing ways was invented locally at
NASA's Ames Research Center.
This de-icer consists of conduc
tive material encased in thin
plastic strips. When an electric
current passes through the
strip, it causes the strip to
bulge, which dislodges the ice.
Q, Why do 1 sometimes hear
• the radio on my portable
phone?
A .This is not at all an
• unusual occurrence for an
owner of a cordless phone.
Besides being a regular phone,
your cordless phone contains
the added design features of a
walkie-talkie.
Your voice follows a cir
cuitous path as it "reaches out
to touch someone." First, the
sound of your voice vibrates a
diaphragm in the handset.
These vibrations are then con
verted into electrical signals.
With a corded phone, the
electrical signals zip through
the wall cord and are transmit
ted by fiber optic cables or

microwave links. With a cord
less phone the electrical signals
are converted into radio signals
that fly through the air over to
the phone receiver, where they
are converted back to electrical
signals that continue on the
same path as for a corded
phone.
The radio signals from a
cordless phone are like any
other radio waves. The Federal
Communications Commisions
assigns shortwave radio chan
nels to cordless phones. With
the proper receiver you can
tune in these channels just as
you would any radio station.
This is why when conditions
are right, you can hear FM
radio channels on a cordless
phone and vice versa. When the
phone channels become crowd
ed you may even hear other
conversations.
Cordless phones do not
afford the same privacy as cord
ed phones. All somebody needs
to eavesdrop on a conversation
is a scanner and an antenna.
Both of these can be made by
vour local, sociopathic, amateur
electronics enthusiast.
In fact, some unscrupulous
individuals make a "living" lis
tening in to cordless phone con
versations. They gather infor
mation useful in planning bur
glaries. And probably many
more perverts get their cheap
thrills through eavesdropping.
Newer cordless phones offer
increased protection from
eavesdroppers with devices that
scramble the radio waves and
buttons that allow users to
switch from noisv channels.
