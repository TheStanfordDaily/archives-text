# Thomas still faces Judicial Affairs probe
## 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Although senior Stuart Thomas pleaded guilty
Dec. 18 to misdemeanor charges of statutory rape
and providing alcohol to a minor, his graduation sta
tus is entirely dependent upon the conclusions of a
separate University investigation.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole would not com
ment specifically on Thomas' case because the details
of University investigations are confidential, but she
said her investigation of the case will be "indepen
dent of what goes on external to the University."
A Stanford student accused Thomas of raping her
Sept. 22 in Stern Hall. He was charged by the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's office with a felony
count of illegal sex with a minor, as well as the alco
hol charge. Thomas plea bargained the felony count
to a misdemeanor.
If a judicial affairs investigation determines that
Thomas is guilty of misconduct, his degree could be
placed in jeopardy.
Thomas probably earned enough units to gradu
ate at the end of fall quarter. Thomas' lawyer,
Melvin de la Motte, had said in an October court
statement that Thomas was one quarter away from
graduation and planned to attend law school next
year.
The registrar's office had listed Thomas with 176
units, or four units fewer than required for gradua
tion, before fall quarter began. His current status is
being withheld, a staff member at the office said.
