# Thomas still faces Judicial Affairs probe
## 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Although senior Stuart Thomas pleaded guilty
Dec. 18 to misdemeanor charges of statutory rape
and providing alcohol to a minor, his graduation sta
tus is entirely dependent upon the conclusions of a
separate University investigation.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole would not com
ment specifically on Thomas' case because the details
of University investigations are confidential, but she
said her investigation of the case will be "indepen
dent of what goes on external to the University."
A Stanford student accused Thomas of raping her
Sept. 22 in Stern Hall. He was charged by the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's office with a felony
count of illegal sex with a minor, as well as the alco
hol charge. Thomas plea bargained the felony count
to a misdemeanor.
If a judicial affairs investigation determines that
Thomas is guilty of misconduct, his degree could be
placed in jeopardy.
Thomas probably earned enough units to gradu
ate at the end of fall quarter. Thomas' lawyer,
Melvin de la Motte, had said in an October court
statement that Thomas was one quarter away from
graduation and planned to attend law school next
year.
The registrar's office had listed Thomas with 176
units, or four units fewer than required for gradua
tion, before fall quarter began. His current status is
being withheld, a staff member at the office said.
Although students' credits are
typically public record, Thomas
probably requested that the infor
mation not be released, the staff
member said.
According to Cole, when a stu
dent is academically eligible for
graduation but is possibly guilty
of misconduct, it is "typical" for a
student's degree to be placed on
hold "until the questions are
answered." Cole would not say
whether Thomas' degree was
being withheld.

In determining whether to bring
charges, Cole said she will interview
the people involved and examine
the evidence to decide whether to
initiate a formal judicial process.
She conducts investigations by her
self, but said she is sometimes
assisted by the Legal Office.
If Thomas is accused of miscon
duct by the University, he will
have a choice between admitting
or denying the truth of the charge.
If he denies it, the case will go to an
on-campus attorney for a formal
evaluation of factual evidence.
In cases where the investigation
leads to the conclusion of no mis
conduct, the degree will be granted
retroactive to when it was earned.

However, if the investigation
supports the presence of miscon
duct, the degree may be continual
ly held for a designated number of
quarters. In misconduct cases, the
University president makes the
final decision and sets the time
period for which the degree is held.
Degrees are oflen held in lieu
of suspension when a student no
longer needs to be registered
because he or she has enough
units to graduate, Cole said.
After the hold period, the
degree is not conferred retroac
tively. Cole said that "transcripts
and records will reflect the
imposed delay." A degree can also
be revoked, she added.
