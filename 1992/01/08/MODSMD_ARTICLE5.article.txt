# Museum receives donation of $5M
## Gift to fund earthquake repairs 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
The Stanford Museum,
severely damaged by the 1989
Loma Prieta Earthquake, is $5
million closer to reopening
thanks to a gift from an anony
mous donor.
The gift marks the largest to
date for the museum, which
needs such extensive repairs
that the University is calling
major donors "re-founders,"
according to Ewart Thomas,
dean of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences.
An estimated $26 million is
needed before the museum can
re-open, divided into two build
ing phases of $20 and $6 mil
lion each. To date, $2 million
has been pledged by other
donors, and a volunteer group
called the Committee for Art
has promised to raise $1 mil
lion — totaling $8 million of
the required amount.
Other funding will come
from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, although
the amount is still being negoti
ated. Museum Director Thomas
Seligman said the University
will not contribute to the repairs
from its operating budget.

The date for the repairs has
not been scheduled yet, but
Seligman said he is hoping the
first phase will be completed by
1995, allowing the museum to
reopen then. He added that he
is pushing to have both phases
done at the same time.
Reconstruction plans call for
retaining the museum's original
marble foyer and large galleries,
and rebuilding the splintered
octagonal rotundas. Two new
galleries may be built that are
intended to lend seismic stabili
ty and enhance the connection
to the adjoining B. Gerald Can
tor Rodin Sculpture Garden.
Seligman said rebuilding will
make Stanford a cultural center
and enhance academic opportu
nities for art and history stu
dents and faculty. "This individ
ual and other recent donors will
make it possible for Stanford to
attract really outstanding gifts
of art," Seligman said.
Security, lighting and cli
mate control will be modified to
increase the safety of works on
display, he added. The renova
tions will improve access for
the disabled and eliminate
asbestos.
The final result "will be a mod
ern museum in the old building,"
an improvement over the "anti
quated" museum of the past, Selig
inan said.
The 30,000 items in the muse
um, a collection Seligman said is
valued in the hundreds of millions
of dollars, are now being cleaned
and packed. "We are working on a
full physical inventory," he said.
Private collection donated
Besides these pieces, one of the

largest private collections of con
temporary art in the country will
find a home in the museum when
it reopens.
The works are a gift of Harry
"Hunk" and Margaret "Moo"
Anderson and will be displayed in
a 2,000-square-foot gallery slated
to be built during the renovation.
The collection is a significant
contribution to Stanford's art col
lections. University President
Donald Kennedy called it "one of
the most important gifts to the
museum since it was founded by
the Stanfords."
Artists featured in the 650-
piece collection include Jennifer
Bartlett, Richard Diebenkorn,

Sam Francis, David Hockney,
Jasper Johns, Elizabeth Murray,
Robert Rauschenberg, Frank
Stella and Wayne Thiebaud. Sev
eral of the artists, including
Diebenkorn, have Stanford ties.
The Andersons have contribut
ed in other ways to the arts at
Stanford, including works from
their collection on loan to the
museum and scholars, and an
internship for graduate students.
They have also given $200,000
toward a $600,000 fund to be
used to build the collection.
The exhibit will be lent to the
Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation
at Quadrus in Menlo Park until the
museum repairs are complete.
