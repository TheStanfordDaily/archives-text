# Construction behind Mem Chu nears end

Trudging through mud, jump
ing over trenches and navigating
around equipment has become
standard procedure when passing
behind the Quad near Memorial
Church.
It won't be long now, however,
before the area will be quiet and
clean, with no sign of the mess
that has resided there since early
November.
The project had been scheduled
to be completed by Jan. 1, before
students returned from winter
break, but the rains of the past
several weeks have delayed the
project's final stages, according to
Facilities Engineer Lew l^ane.
As soon as the ground dries

out, it should take about one week
to finish the resurfacing and
clean up of the area.
The purpose behind the project
is two-fold. In conjunction with
the earthquake reconstruction
taking place in buildings 300 and
310, the project will install new
telephone and data lines in that
area of campus, Lane said.
The power distribution of the
entire Quad is also being upgraded.
The Quad, being very old, has had
a primary power of only 4160 volts.
The current project will upgrade
that of the Quad's to 12,000 volts,
consistent with the rest of the cam
pus. Primary power is a measure
ment of electrical capacity.
During both projects —
installing the new communica
tion lines and upgrading the
power lines — the necessary
wiring was encased in plastic
pipes in the trenches that stretch
between buildingß 300 and 310.
Then, red concrete was poured
over the piping to hold it into
place.
Backfilling the trenches, or
putting the dirt back in to restore
the ground to its original level,
was the next step. However, the
rains interrupted the backfilling
just before it was complete. After
the backfilling is finished, the
trench and paved areas will be
resurfaced and the area will be
cleaned up.
Working in the rain is not pro
ductive, Lane said, because the
heavy equipment sinks into the
wet, muddy ground, creating ruts
in the surrounding landscaping
and tracking mud everywhere as
it gets stuck in the grooves of
tires and students' shoes.
