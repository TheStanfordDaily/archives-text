Welfare may lose in budget battle
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Gov. Pete Wilson is beginning his sec
ond year in office facing a deficit of over $6 billion, and his annu
al state-of-the-state address today is expected to include his pro
posal for deep welfare cuts.
Wilson enacted $7 billion in tax increases last year to help
close a $14.3 billion deficit. But he faces another huge revenue
gap in the 1992-93 fiscal year, as the recession has cut deeper into
tax receipts than state economists had predicted.
This year, he has promised to veto additional taxes. That
means the entire deficit, estimated at $6.6 billion by the non-par
tisan legislative analyst, must be balanced exclusively through
spending cuts.
Wilson is scheduled to submit his detailed budget bill to the
Legislature tomorrow.
ACLU goes to bat for Duke
PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — The American Civil Liberties
Union went to court yesterday to force Rhode Island's secretary
of state to put former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke's name
on the Republican presidential primary ballot.
"Access to the ballot is a fundamental right," said attorney
Michael Dißiase said who filed the suit in federal court. It said
the decision to keep Duke's name off the ballot was based on his
political views.
