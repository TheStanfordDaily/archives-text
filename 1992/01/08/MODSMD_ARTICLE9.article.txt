# Computer failure disrupts services
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
A failure of the University's mainframe computer
yesterday morning shut down many student services
in Old Union, frustrating students and employees on
one of the busiest administrative days of the year.
According to Paul Beirne, Director of Operations
at the Data Center, a broken power-distribution unit
caused the breakdown of the mainframe in Forsythe
Hall. "There was no power to the mainframe," he
said.
The Data Center supervises and maintains the
mainframe computer.
Beirne said computer links were severed from 3
a.m. until around 9:30 a.m. Workers from two com
panies, Emmerson and IBM, labored to fix the sys
tem during those hours.
Employees in some of the offices located in Old
Union said the failure hindered their ability to serve
students. Margaret De La Cruz, registration and
records supervisor in the Registrar's office, said the

system was down until 10 a.m., during which time
the Registrar could not process any students.
"We were sending students away because we
couldn't handle them," she said.
Kate Gompert, a receptionist in the Bursar's
office, said some but not all students had to be sent
away.
She said that while the Bursar's office opened
yesterday at 8:30 a.m. to help facilitate early-quarter
business, it normally opens at 10 a.m., so few stu
dents were at the office during the time of the mal
function.
Beirne said the part that caused the failure will
not be in use in the future, because the University is
installing a new mainframe.
The present mainframe was not being replaced
because of any past equipment failures, he said, but
"primarily because of increased load" due to greater
computer use. The installation of the new computer
will disrupt mainframe services from 3 a.m. until
noon Jan. 20, the national holiday commemorating
the birth of Martin Luther King, Jr.
