Proposed Cuts to Student Resources
Student Resources has an overall reduction target of
• $2,500,(XX) or 10% for undergraduate financial aid awards,
• $2,250,000 or 12.7% for its general funds (GF) programs,
• $584,000 or 15% for its rent-funded (RF) programs (i.e, Res Ed,
Grad Residences, part of Housing Center).
A minimum of 65% of these cuts should be implemented in 1992-93.
At this time, C-UAFA, the Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid, has not finalized its recommendations. For this reason,
recommendations for financial aid award cuts will be announced at a later
date.
The following proposals for cuts were recommended by individual offices
after consultation at the local level. They have also been reviewed by
faculty, staff, and students on the Ad Hoc Student Resources Advisory
Committee.
For each area, the total budget is given, followed by a dollar figure and
description of changes we ace proposing, and a dollar figure and description
of possible changes where we still believe there is considerable choice. Very
likely cuts are marked with a bullet (•); other potential cuts are marked with
a question mark (?).

ONE TIME PRE-MATRICULATION FEE: A new fee covering
services now billed individually by the Career Planning and
Placement Center and the Registrar has been tentatively approved.
It would be a one-time pre-matriculation fee of $100 for all
undergraduates and for graduate students in H&S, Education,
Engineering, and Earth Sciences, and $50 for all other students who
use only the transcript service of the Registrar This fee would yield
$150,000 more than is currently charged to students and alumni for
these services, and credit toward the Student Resources target has
been tentatively approved for this figure, enabling each office to
reduce expenses associated with collecting numerous small fees.

QUESTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION
- Are the "likely cuts" reasonable?
- Which additional cuts do you prefer?
- What is your view of the one-time Pre-Matriculation
Fee in lieu of separate, fee-for-service charges by the
Registrar and CPPC?
