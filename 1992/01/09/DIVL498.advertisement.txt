If you never thought
anything that started with
IBM could be easy to use, an IBM
Personal System will change all that.
With preloaded, user-friendly software
like Microsft® Windows™ 3.0, just turn it
on and you'll be ready to work
polishing off tearm papers, moving text
and graphics with the click of a mouse.
Work can be-fun. IBM offers a variety of
Selected Academic Solutions** - a range
of PS/2* models to choose from. And
with special student prices and
affordable loan
payments,** they're even easy to buy.
You probably didn't expect that,
either. Well, you learn something new
everyday. After all, isn't that what
college is all
about? Visit your
campus outlet to
find out how to
make an IBM
Personal
System click
for you.
