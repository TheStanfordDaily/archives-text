## After dog attack, a leash-snapping incident 
### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
When Stanford Mathematics Prof. R.
James Milgram's dog Pooky hit a child biker
last May, his problems were just beginning.
Yesterday, Milgram was found guilty in the
Palo Alto Municipal Court of misdemeanor
assault and battery, violating a leash law and
using words that could provoke a fight during
an altercation in which Milgram hit a man
with a leash and sicked his dog on him.
Around 10:15 a.m. on May 25, the 51-
year-old Milgram was jogging near Lake
Lagunita with his 68-pound German shep
herd when they came upon Mark Woodside,
his two young sons and another boy riding
bikes, according to the police report.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul

Neimeyer, the dog bit one of the boys, Adam
Brumm, on the ankle, causing three punc

Woodside then asked Milgram for his
name and address, according to Catherine
Pozos, the depOty district attorney who han

"Woodside was afraid that the dog might
have rabies and wanted to give that informa

Mateo County Health Inspector," she said.
Milgram refused to give his name and
began to walk away. Then Woodside told his
son Nathan to go call the police, but the boys
remained there.
According to Pozos, Milgram then became
"aggressive, and took out his leash and
began snapping it at (Woodsidel, several
times, hitting him on the head once. He also

sicked the dog on him."
Although the leash had a metal lead, Wood
side was not harmed, as he was wearing a
bicycle helmet. He again told his son to call the
police, and this time he obeyed, Pozos said.
At this point, "Milgram turned and ran,"
said Pozos. "Mr. Woodside tried to chase him
on the bike, but he couldn't catch him."
When the police arrived, they took state
ments from Woodside, the three boys and
two other witnesses. The police picked up
Milgram a little while later, near Interstate
280 where he was still jogging.
According to Pozos, "Milgram's defense
was self-defense. He thought he was being
threatened â€” even though there was no evi
dence that he had been threatened.
"He also said that (in this case) he was
being singled out by the police for a prior
