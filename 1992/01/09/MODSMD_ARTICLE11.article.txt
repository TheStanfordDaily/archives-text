# Stanford water management improves
## 
### Helen Song 
After every period of rain, hopes are
raised that our drought worries are over.
However, University water managers
say that will probably never be the case,
even though 1991 saw increased rainfall
and more efficient water use on campus.
Changes in irrigation on campus
saved 172 million gallons of water last
year, and the University actually has a
credit applied to its water bill, according
to Julie Hardin, an energy analyst in
the Energy System Management office.
Since December, 1990, two of Stan
ford's lakes have provided enough water
to irrigate athletic fields and lawns
throughout campus. This reduced the
amount needed from the Hetch Hetchy
reservoir in Yosemite, which provides
most of Stanford's drinking water.
The maneuver eliminated a $302,360
fine Stanford faced last year because it
exceeded the water limit dictated by the
San Francisco Water District. Stanford's
account at the water bank was also credit
ed with 288,000 additional cubic meters.
However, that figure has been steadi
ly dwindling. As of December, the Uni
versity had a credit of only 136,000

cubic meters. Instead of paying fines for
exceeding the water amount it is allot
ted, the University has been draining
the credits earned last year.
But University water managers
expect their task of saving water will be
less difficult this year, now that improve
ments have been made in the system.
"Last year was the big year for
change on campus," Hardin said. "That
makes it a little easier for this year."
Susan Kulakowski, conservation pro
grams coordinator at the Housing Ener
gy Conservation Center, agreed. She said
that planting drought-tolerant plants,
installing low-flow showerheads in new
residences and posting stickers recom
mending shorter showers were just a few
subtle examples of a large conservation
effort.
However, "There is a constant need
to raise awareness and propose new
methods and plans to reduce water
use," Kulakowski said.
She noted that "the network of envi
ronment representatives" in each dormi
tory is "very strong this year. It's more
comprehensive and active than ever."
The representatives have been par
ticularly important in organizing con

servation programs for their own hous
es, Kulakowski said. "It helps when stu
dents who live in the house propose
plans to cut water use rather than an
outsider," she said.
The Housing Energy Conservation
Center plans to sponsor another conser
vation competition between residences
this year. Last year the office gave
prizes to the houses that showed the
most improvement in saving water.
The amount of water Stanford is
allotted for each quarter varies from
180,000 to 300,000 cubic meters per
quarter, depending on patterns of
usage, Hardin said. Only 144,000 cubic
meters is allotted for winter quarter
because water managers anticipate rain
to take the place of irrigation.
One recent conservation project,
Hardin said, is the installation of a new
cooling system in the Mudd Chemistry
Building. Using a "mud single-pass
cooling retrofit" system, the water
usage there has been reduced 35 per
cent, she said.
Instead of "going down the drain,"
Hardin said, the water which cools the
lasers and equipment travels in a closed
loop which is cool mechanically.
