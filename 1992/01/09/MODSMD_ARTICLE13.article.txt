## Let's save the Earth 
### 
For years, students
have found Stanford sorely
lacking in the field of envi
ronmental studies.
Interested students have had to
scramble blindly from department
to department looking for classes
pertaining to the environment
that they might be able to combine
into a coherent, self-designed
major.
Last year, the University finally
began listing all relevant courses
under the heading of Environmen
tal Studies in Courses and
Degrees. Yet there is still no
degree-granting major in the
realm of environmental studies.
All this could change, however,
if the Faculty Senate approves the
proposed Earth Systems major
this evening.
Earth Systems is an interdisci
plinary program that will give stu
dents a background in such sci
ences as biology, geology, chem

istry and physics, in addition to
economics. Students will then spe
cialize in one of five areas, con
cerning various aspects of the
environment.
The Faculty Senate should
accredit Earth Systems.
Opponents of the proposed
major cite the University's cur
rent fiscal quagmire as simply too
grave to implement new majors.
However, this should not be used
to block passage by the full senate.
Start-up costs for the first three
years of the program have been
raised outside of the operating
budget, and although the major
has not been officially approved,
nearly 100 students attended the
first part of an experimental Earth
Studies core. Student demand for
this major is high.
And given the plight of today's
environment, so is the need for the
capable individuals this major
would produce.
