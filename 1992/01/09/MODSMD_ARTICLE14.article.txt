# Eating their points
## 
### 
IN TIMES SUCH AS THESE,
when fiscal responsibility and
careful cost analysis are needed
most at the Farm, Food Service has
wasted both the University's and
students' money and time. Now
they are playing catch-up, trying
to rectify a situation they let get
way out of hand last quarter.
When Food Service expanded
their points-based meal plans to
several residences this fall, no one
suspected that the relationship
between food and points would
turn out to be so arbitrary. This is
mostly the fault of Food Service,
which should have been much
more careful in their studies of stu
dent eating habits and food costs.
Students who had large surplus
es of points left over last quarter
realized those points could not be
carried over and thus spent them on
huge amounts of junk food and
soda. This obviously caught Food
Service unprepared, and now they

are trying to cope with the after
math.
Now that the error has been
made, and the Food Service budget
will surely feel it effects, corrections
must be made. The solution that
Food Service has chosen is to
increase the point values of food.
While this may look like a scam on
the surface, it is probably the most
feasible option Food Service has left.
The true problem that faces
Food Service, however, is the relia
bility of the new food prices. Obvi
ously, whatever method was used
last quarter to determine food
prices was not sufficient. If similar
reasoning is being used for this
quarter's new prices, there will be
equal hell to pay next quarter.
Food Service must utilize com
petent, professional and possibly
expensive means of statistical
information gathering to save
their own and their customers'
money in the future.
