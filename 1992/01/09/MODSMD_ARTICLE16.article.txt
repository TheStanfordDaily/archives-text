## Home sweet home 
### 
IT HAD BEEN A LONG time since I had
been back in Texas. As I descended from
the airplane, I realized that it had been
nearly a full year since I had been back to
my hometown of Houston. I listened to the
twangs, watched the ladies tease their hair
into beautiful bouffants and noted that the
fashion style was still 10-gallon hats and
ropers. I knew I was home.
In the fullness of the year I had been
away, I had become an upperclassman. I
had lived on my own in the crime-filled,
dangerous metropolis of Washington,
D.C. I had paid my own bills and made all
of my own decisions. In two weeks 1
would be on my way to another country
far across the ocean, another cosmopoli
tan component to add to my persona.
But for now I was returning to the old
days. I was coming back to the people and
the society that had raised and nurtured
me. I was going home to a way of life
where I didn't have to question or ana
lyze, but just be.
I would go see Grandma and help her
feed the chickens. I would go to church,
real baptist church, where a hymn could
start quietly as a hum in the back row
and swell to a shout heard across
Jerusalem. I'd drown myself in Mommy's
southern cooking and spend my nights
with friends that were real and timeless.
I did spend the night at Grandma's,
and it was great to hear her tales of when
Houston wasn't more than a few buildings

and fields. But Grandma doesn't move as
quickly as she used to, and sometimes
when she goes back in time it is hard for
her to come back to the reality she left.
I went to church, and it was like
returning to a favorite doll or a storybook
that's been put away for a while. It was
good to take part in the fellowship and
hear a good song, but I realized how much
of the extras I didn't believe in anymore.
I didn't believe that there was a huge
God-ordained distinction for what a
woman should say, do, think and act. I
don't know what to think about homo
sexuality, but I don't think mistreatment
and hatred is justified behavior.
I didn't speak up or rock the boat, but
I did remember a time when I wouldn't
have been at all conscious of these inter
nal differences of thought.
Mommy cooked breakfast the first
day, but most mornings she was at work.
With two of her children gone, she decid
ed to spend here time doing something
creative and fulfilling. That meant no hot
cookies and cold milk in the afternoons,
made only the way a mommy can. When
I got home the house was still quiet
because I was waiting for my sister, the
freshman, to come home from college.
I know that in future holidays, some of
my siblings won't even be there and when
they do arrive they'll bring miniature
look-alike people with them. In a strange
way I would have given all the worldly,

adult, meaningless significance of grow
ing up away for five minutes of hide-and
seek and "I'm going to tell Mom."
My friends, the ones that even both
ered to come home, have remained
understanding and amazing individuals.
But some of them came home talking
about marriage and real jobs. Others
talked about life plans and goals that
would separate us for a long time, maybe
even for good.
The zaniness and childishness I
remembered fondly and had expected to
return to had been replaced with maturi
ty and adulthood. I can't say I felt good
about it; I just felt old.
As I left home, I wondered how changed
I would find it the next time I returned. I,
too, had been one of those people who spoke
about coming home next year for only a few
days, if at all.
But, I know I'll always return because
I'll have no choice. I'll reach for the
phone and make those reservations,
because in my heart, the trip I'll be trying
to book won't be to Houston, but to a
place somewhere on memory lane.
