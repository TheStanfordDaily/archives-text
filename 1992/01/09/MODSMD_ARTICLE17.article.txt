Green has made important contributions to Stanford

I WRITE TO CONGRATULATE
Coach Dennis Green for providing
Stanford students, faculty, alumni
and general fans in the Bay Area, across
the nation and around the globe with a
memorable season of stunning victories.
Green "didn't make a single tackle,"
as he modestly said after the big upset
over Notre Dame during the 1990 sea
son. Yet the magnitude of Green's
achievements as coach is remarkable.
Small wonder he is in demand. But
success inspires envy. Because other
university and professional teams have
understandably expressed an interest in
Green, a growing number of Bay Area
reporters and columnists have become
his detractors. They become more vitri-

olic as the weeks go by.
They have called him sarcastic
names: "a music critic," "a Polynesian
poet," "an unemployed actor." In a Jan.
5 column in The Peninsula Times Tri
bune, John Marvel, who appears to have
an obscure ax to grind, falsely and
ridiculously accuses him of holding Stan
ford "hostage" and worse — engaging in
"blackmail." This is because the Pitts
burgh Steelers had reportedly expressed
an interest in Green.
It would be a big loss if Green left
Stanford and the NOW Boys. And I
would hate to see him go. However, he,
like any faculty member, senator, dish
washer or gravedigger, should be enti
tled, at least in America, to consider a

more attractive job opportunity. That's
the American way, the American dream.
Whether he goes or stays Green
deserves to be congratulated for bringing
so much positive attention to Stanford at
a time when the University is being
blitzed and nationally publicized scandals.
For seven consecutive weeks, Green,
Steve Stenstrom, "Touchdown" Tommy
Vardell, Glyn Milburn, Bob Whitfield,
Seyon Albert and the rest of the NOW
Boys demonstrated that football can be
played at the highest level at a world
class university. This particular fact
alone distinguishes Green among all col
lege and university coaches.
Even more noteworthy than the Car
dinal's dazzling defeats of Colorado, USC

and, of course, California was Green's
"class operation." Cardinal players were
never arrested for assault, drug abuse or
rape. If I were Athletic Director Ted
Leland or University President Donald
Kennedy, I would do everything I could
to make sure Green retires on the Farm.
So thumbs up for the Coach! When
and whether he stays and despite his
detractors, the 1991 Cardinal season —
including a top-25 national ranking, the
Centennial defeat of Colorado, the
thrilling Big Game victory and the ago
nizing Aloha Bowl defeat — is all his: his
public and private trophy to cherish and
keep forever.
