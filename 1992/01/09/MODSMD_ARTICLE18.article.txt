# Dismissal of religious beliefs should not be dependent on novelty

God is dead. Laughed out of exis
tence. Thus spake Zarathustra.
God is dead. Got old and died. Thus
spake Thomas Van Wees.
"Increasingly," he says, "it has
become the realization" that the tradi
tional religions of this world had it all
wrong. Being a traditional religious per
son myself, I was nervous. Had I missed
something over the break? A scientific
break-through? A new proof for the non
existence of God, perhaps?
Alas, no. According to Van Wees, the
beliefs of Christian and Jews and Hin
dus are false because they are "outdat
ed," "outmoded," "not in keeping with
the times," and "old-fashioned." Not
because they are logically inconsistent,
not because they are historically inaccu
rate, but because they are old.
Now milk, when it gets old, goes bad.
Ideas, on the other hand, do not come

with expiration dates. You must find out
why they went "out of date." Were they
ever refuted? If so, by whom, and how
conclusively? Were they malignant, or
just unfashionable?
We would not be constrained to a single
cultural perspective, to what white males
think; why then be bound to a single tem
poral perspective, to what today thinks?
Education is about liberation, not mere
ly from the preconceptions of the West,
but from the preconceptions of our centu
ry. "New" is not a synonym for "true,"
and Van Wees is a chronological bigot.
