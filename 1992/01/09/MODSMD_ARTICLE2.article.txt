# Advising services could be curtailed
## 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
Only juniors and seniors will
be able to receive academic advice
from the Undergraduate Advis
ing Center beginning next year if
proposed cuts are implemented.
With a current budget of
$531,000, the UAC is targeted for
a $90,000 cut this year with an
additional potential cut of $20,000
for the following year. The UAC is
subject to Student Resources bud
get cuts.
If the proposed cuts are real
ized "no sophomores, freshmen,
alumni, faculty and faculty spous
es" will be eligible for UAC ser
vices next year, said Verity Pow
ell, one of two premedical advising
consultants. She added that the
center probably would have to say
no to graduate students as well.
UAC Director Hector Cuevas
said 85 percent of UAC's budget
goes to salaries. Powell said the
reductions translate into elimi
nating student workers and cut
ting her own salary in half.
"I don't panic that I'm going to
miss mortgage payments, but I
really feel the [students] are
going to miss out," said Powell.
She said she is concerned that
by being reduced to part-time, it
would greatly affect her ability to
advise students.
The cuts would affect all
students who use the UAC for
pre-professional, pre-graduate
school advice and other academ
ic aid. Cuevas said the UAC sees
2,500 students confused about
their major per year. He said
that the cuts would "reduce ser
vices drastically."
Powell said that next year
potential advisees would not be
seen as often and would mostly be
seen in group meetings.
Alifa Dance, a premedical stu
dent, said that in a group meeting
students would be less likely to
discuss "GPAs, MCAT scores, get
ting accepted or rejected at a
school, and disclose any personal
information" such as "having
trouble in a class."
Students who cannot use the

UAC may have to turn to academ
ic departments for advice.
But Dance said no matter how
great the professors are, they are
"not going to have the expertise to
tell me when I should take my
tests and how I should organize
my schedule."
Allie Shown, a senior in psy
chology, said "the faculty are
already so busy, I don't see how
they could help everyone."
Cuevas said the reduction in
services will affect Stanford's
retention rates. "We won't be able
to do as much preventive advising
and keeping students on track."
Senior Richard Chen, a com
puter science major and head of
the Stanford Premedical Associa
tion, expressed concern for the
freshmen and sophomores who
will not receive preprofessional
advice after the cuts.
"Even though juniors and
seniors need advice, the freshmen

and sophomores are the ones who
will be making this life-changing
decision" to go to medical school
he said. "This decision needs to be
made with intelligence and guid
ance."
Danny Hsiau, a resident assis
tant in Roble and a senior in biol
ogy, said that although freshmen
have been assigned faculty advis
ers, they may not always be help
ful in specific areas.
"There is no one person who
can advise the frosh because
advisers usually aren't well
versed on the med school [applica
tion] process," he said.
Dandre Desandis, academic
adviser at the UAC and a member
of the Student Resources Adviso
ry Committee, said the UAC "is a
safe place for a student to go to
talk about their academic prob
lems without having to feel like
there is something terribly
wrong." Desandis said it is impor

tant for students to seek advice
when facing academic obstacles.
He added, "Advisers help stu
dents put failure into perspec
tive. "
John Overdeck, a member of
the Council of Presidents and a
graduate student in statistics, is a
member of the committee making
recommendations. He said cut
ting the UAC will "create a vacu
um. Some people will fall through
the cracks."
Overdeck said he does not see a
way out of the cuts. He said Stan
ford could look at other universi
ties to see how they already deal
with the reduced advising ser
vices.
An open forum on these cuts
will be held tonight at 7 p.m. in
Kresge Auditorium.
Cueves said "students aren't
going to realize the impact [of
these cuts] until they are the ones
denied service."

these cuts] until they are the ones
denied service."
Only juniors and seniors will
be able to receive academic advice
from the Undergraduate Advis
ing Center beginning next year if
proposed cuts are implemented.
With a current budget of
$531,000, the UAC is targeted for
a $90,000 cut this year with an
additional potential cut of $20,000
for the following year. The UAC is
subject to Student Resources bud
get cuts.
If the proposed cuts are real
ized "no sophomores, freshmen,
alumni, faculty and faculty spous
es" will be eligible for UAC ser
vices next year, said Verity Pow
ell, one of two premedical advising
consultants. She added that the
center probably would have to say
no to graduate students as well.
UAC Director Hector Cuevas
said 85 percent of UAC's budget
goes to salaries. Powell said the
reductions translate into elimi
nating student workers and cut
ting her own salary in half.
"I don't panic that I'm going to
miss mortgage payments, but I
really feel the [students] are
going to miss out," said Powell.
She said she is concerned that
by being reduced to part-time, it
would greatly affect her ability to
advise students.
The cuts would affect all
students who use the UAC for
pre-professional, pre-graduate
school advice and other academ
ic aid. Cuevas said the UAC sees
2,500 students confused about
their major per year. He said
that the cuts would "reduce ser
vices drastically."
Powell said that next year
potential advisees would not be
seen as often and would mostly be
seen in group meetings.
Alifa Dance, a premedical stu
dent, said that in a group meeting
students would be less likely to
discuss "GPAs, MCAT scores, get
ting accepted or rejected at a
school, and disclose any personal
information" such as "having
trouble in a class."
Students who cannot use the

UAC may have to turn to academ
ic departments for advice.
But Dance said no matter how
great the professors are, they are
"not going to have the expertise to
tell me when I should take my
tests and how I should organize
my schedule."
Allie Shown, a senior in psy
chology, said "the faculty are
already so busy, I don't see how
they could help everyone."
Cuevas said the reduction in
services will affect Stanford's
retention rates. "We won't be able
to do as much preventive advising
and keeping students on track."
Senior Richard Chen, a com
puter science major and head of
the Stanford Premedical Associa
tion, expressed concern for the
freshmen and sophomores who
will not receive preprofessional
advice after the cuts.
"Even though juniors and
seniors need advice, the freshmen

and sophomores are the ones who
will be making this life-changing
decision" to go to medical school
he said. "This decision needs to be
made with intelligence and guid
ance."
Danny Hsiau, a resident assis
tant in Roble and a senior in biol
ogy, said that although freshmen
have been assigned faculty advis
ers, they may not always be help
ful in specific areas.
"There is no one person who
can advise the frosh because
advisers usually aren't well
versed on the med school [applica
tion] process," he said.
Dandre Desandis, academic
adviser at the UAC and a member
of the Student Resources Adviso
ry Committee, said the UAC "is a
safe place for a student to go to
talk about their academic prob
lems without having to feel like
there is something terribly
wrong." Desandis said it is impor

tant for students to seek advice
when facing academic obstacles.
He added, "Advisers help stu
dents put failure into perspec
tive. "
John Overdeck, a member of
the Council of Presidents and a
graduate student in statistics, is a
member of the committee making
recommendations. He said cut
ting the UAC will "create a vacu
um. Some people will fall through
the cracks."
Overdeck said he does not see a
way out of the cuts. He said Stan
ford could look at other universi
ties to see how they already deal
with the reduced advising ser
vices.
An open forum on these cuts
will be held tonight at 7 p.m. in
Kresge Auditorium.
Cueves said "students aren't
going to realize the impact [of
these cuts] until they are the ones
denied service."
