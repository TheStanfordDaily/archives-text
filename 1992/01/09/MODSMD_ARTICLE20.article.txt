# Students must realize where, when campus crimes are happening
## 
### 
I applaud The Daily for publishing
crime statistics on Monday. I hope that
it is just the beginning of such reports.
For comparison, the Palo Alto Weekly
reported 53 bicycle thefts and 28 other
thefts at Stanford for the first three
weeks of November. Students need the
geographic data as to where thefts and
assaults are occurring.
I believe students would be appalled
and change their habits if they knew the
number of weekly burglaries on this
campus. True, the Police Department
does not refuse to release these num
bers, but no one on campus publishes
them.
I feel the Police Department does not
actively release these numbers because
the administration fears the cost of a
true security system, i.e. more lighting.
