## Dukes enters Danger Zone 'Stick' hits three-pointers with deadly accuracy 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
His friends still call him
"stick." Now, however, his nick
name applies not only to his
appearance, but also to his execu
tion of jump shots.
With Marcus Lollie as Coach
Mike Montgomery's probable
choice at point guard, a preseason
battle took place between Dukes
and Kenny Hicks for the shooting
guard position. A key factor for
Montgomery was trying to find a
consistent long range shooter to
replace guards Kenny Amman
and John Patrick.
This summer, Dukes shot any
where from 150 to 200 shots a
day, five days a week — all from
three-point country. The hard
work paid off, as Dukes earned
the starting off-guard spot in the
lineup this fall.
"I wanted to start — that was
my goal," said the Seattle, Wash,
native. "I knew we had to have
someone out there who could

shoot the three. I didn't have
much confidence in pulling up for
three, and the only way you're
going to get confidence is to keep
shooting them."
Of late, Dukes has been more
than confident. He has been on fire,
hitting 28 of 48 (.583) three-point
ers this season. Against Southern
Utah last Thursday, Dukes was 9
for 11 from the field, including a
perfect five-for-five from the three
point line which set a school record.
In the Spartan Classic Tournament
at Michigan State, Dukes tallied
eleven three-pointers and was
named to the all-tournament team.
"So far, things are going a lot
better than expected," he said.
"The Michigan State game gave
me a lot of confidence, playing a
ranked Big Ten team at their
place. . . .There's always the ques
tion of 'can 1 do it?' That game
kind of set it down for me that I
can play at this level."
Montgomery said, "Dukes is
not a major surprise to us. Com
ing into the year we (the coaches)

were saying that Pete might be
the key to the whole season."
This season is a refreshing
change for Dukes, because so far,
he has remained injury-free, a
sharp contrast to years past. In
his freshman year, he broke sev
eral ribs, subluxed a shoulder
(took it out of the socket) lifting
weights and sprained his ankle. In
his sophomore season, he saw lim
ited action in a reserve role. Last
year, the injury bug struck again.
He had tendonitis in his knee,
shin splints in his left shin and, at
the end of the season, the bursti
sac came out of his elbow.
"I keep asking the man
upstairs if I can have one season
here without an injury," he said.
Montgomery knows Dukes'
abilities have been hampered by
injuries, and is pleased to have the
six-foot-five-inch guard at 100
percent. "During the past three
years, he's been one of our best
guards sometimes," he said.
Dukes' shooting touch has
taken some of the pressure off of
the Cardinal's All-American for
ward Adam Keefe. Dukes loves
nothing more than when his man
drops down to double-team Keefe
in the post.
"If I can get the ball to Adam,
my man will guard him, so why
shouldn't I benefit from that?" he
commented.
Off the court, Dukes is a very
low-key person. He keeps his
hand-eye coordination in check
between practices by playing
Tecmo Bowl on Nintendo.
This weekend, Stanford begins
Pacific 10 Conference play on the
road at Oregon, and it will be a big
test for the Cardinal. "The students
are back, so it should be noisy, espe
cially in Eugene," Dukes said.
With the way Dukes is shoot
ing though, the crowds should be
silenced quickly.

Peter Dukes' quick reflexes serve him well whether he's playing basketball in Maples or Tecmo Bowl on
Nintendo.
