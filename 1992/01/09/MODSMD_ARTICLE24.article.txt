# Cardinal basketball hero fondly remembered
## Dallmar's integrity, sincerity set him above others both on the court and off 
### 
While the Cardinal did battle on Hon
olulu's sun-baked gridiron and contested
the likes of Tennessee and Michigan State
on the hardcourt, members of the Stan
ford athletic community mourned the loss
of a legendary sports hero.
Howie Dallmar, a man whose name
was synonymous with Stanford basket
ball for three decades, passed away
December 19, leaving behind him a legacy
of achievement on the Farm which includ
ed Final Four MVP honors in Stanford's
only NCAA championship season and
more wins than any coach in Stanford his
tory.
That 1942 NCAA title season marked
just the beginning of Dallmar's storied
career. He was named All-Conference in
his junior year before jumping to the pro
fessional ranks. After three seasons as a
point guard with the NBA's Philadelphia
Warriors, he returned to his alma mater
in 1954 and guided the (then) Indians to
264 wins in 21 seasons at the helm. Even
after stepping down as head coach Dall
mar continued his commitment to Stan
ford athletics, directing the school's intra
mural program from 1975 until his death.
Just recently Dallmar took his place
alongside Bill Walsh, Jennifer Azzi and
Jim Plunkett in the Centennial Celebra
tion's "Line of Legends" — clearly his
contributions to Stanford athletics speak
for themselves. But it seems that he is
remembered by former teammates, play
ers and rival coaches less for his on-court
achievement than for his off-court
demeanor. In their reminiscence of the
late player/coach, "modesty" and "integri
ty" are oft-spoken words.
Jim Pollard, a teammate of Dallmar's

on the club that breezed past Final Four
opponents Colorado and Dartmouth on
the way to the national title, recalled a
modest, likable team leader.
"Howie was one of the best teammates
I ever had," said Pollard. "He was never a
great shooter, but he was a very versatile
player—he switched positions, from cen
ter to guard, during his first year. And as
our point guard, he became a great leader
on the floor."
Pollard thought one of the keys to the
1942 title run was the lack of jealousy
and in-fighting among the players, and he
credited the stature of coach Everett
Dean for the harmony. Pollard described
Dean as a coach whose players "all liked
and respected him." When you hear simi
lar phrases echoed by former Dallmar
players and colleagues, you sense that
Dallmar gleaned more from his coach
than what lay between the covers of the
playbook.
In his 21 seasons as Stanford head
coach, Dallmar tallied eight 15-win sea
sons and tutored a number of future
ABA/NBA stars, including Art Harris,
Claude Terry and Rich Kelley. The length
of Dallmar's tenure is likely attributable
not as much to his record (an even .500

'If you asked him about something, he'd talk
about it with you. That was typical of his nature
— he wanted to make sure he wasn't intrusive.'
— Head coach Mike Montgomery

for his career) as to the disciplined nature
of his teams and the fact that he avoided
the personality conflicts that often plague
today's coaches.
"You knew a Howie Dallmar team
would play hard, smart and always be
under control," said UCL/ 4 , legendary
coach John Wooden. "Howie's*teams were
never blessed with a lot of talent, but his
style of play seemed to get the most out of
what he had.
"When you coached against him, he
gave you a feeling of honesty and integri
ty. I think players had respect for him not
only as a coach, but also as an individual."
Kelley, who played on Dallmar's final
team in 1974-75, appreciated his coach's
unique, non-intrusive relationship with
his players. "Howie was notorious for
being a very 'hands off" coach — maybe
the last one in the history of the NCAA,"
he joked.
"He was a great coach of big men. He
was excellent at teaching the skills of foot
work and rebounding inside," Kelley said.
Indeed, Kelley still holds the Stanford
records for career and season rebounds
per game. Still he added that he was espe
cially grateful to have picked up Dallmar's
calm, rational composure.

Pollard wasn't surprised that Dallmar
came back and spent his entire career on
the Farm. "Howie was in an ideal place at
Stanford. There's an emphasis on being
competitive, but it's not taken to the
extreme that it is at other schools," he
said.
Dallmar remained a part of the Stan
ford athletics, taking over intra murals
after he stepped down from his coaching
position. But as an ex-head coach still in
the department, he was careful never to
step on the toes of his successors.
"If you asked him about something,
he'd talk about it with you. That was typ
ical of his nature — he wanted to make
sure he wasn't intrusive," commented
current head coach Mike Montgomery,
whose team is paying tribute to Dallmar
this season with a black uniform band.
"The thing about Howie ... is I don't
think you'll ever find someone who didn't
like him," he said, speaking for a genuine
consensus.

ence/economics major who feels that
Denny Green, to the misfortune of Cardi
nal fans, deserves to be the next head coach
of the Minnesota Vikings.
