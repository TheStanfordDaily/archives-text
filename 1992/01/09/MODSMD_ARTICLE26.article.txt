# Sailors flounder in rough weather, tough competition
## 
### Laurie Wackier Staff writer 
Sailing coach Blake Middleton can
probably relate to Michigan's Rose Bowl
woes. Although the sailors finished
fourth in a field of 17 teams, Middleton
describes last weekend's performance at
the Rosebowl Intersectional as disap
pointing. "We didn't sail anywhere near
as well as we could have," Middleton
said.
UC — Irvine and Hawaii clearly domi
nated the regatta, which was hosted by
USC. Currently, Irvine is ranked sec
ond in the nation; Hawaii is ninth.
Unranked California contributed the
most frustrating factor of the weekend.
The Golden Bears sailed to a third place
finish, beating 13th ranked Stanford for
the first time in ten regattas.
Skipper Matt Sanford joined crew
Kristen Sidell in the B division to con
sistently place in the top five in each of

their six races. It earned them a
respectable third place finish, but the
team as a whole, the Cardinal coach felt,
did not perform up to potential.
"In both divisions we were capable of
more," said Middleton. "It was frustrat
ing."
Scott Sellars and Andi Guerrero com
peted in the A division of the round
robin-style regatta, finishing sixth.
Rusty Lhamon replaced Gurerro as
crew for one race.
The weather played a significant fac
tor in the weekend's races. Light winds
prevailed throughout most of the regat
ta, making for poor sailing conditions.
At one point on Sunday this "light air"
combined with rain to cause a two hour
postponement in competition.
As a result, many races had to be
eliminated. Ideally, each division would
have competed in 17 races, but due to
weather conditions, there were only six
races for each division.

Despite Middleton's disappointment
in the their performance, Stanford still
managed to place above Boston Univer
sity and Connecticut College, who are
both ranked in the top 20 nationally.
The team will next set sail in the first
weekend of February when they begin
the North Series and South Series. Both
competitions serve as preliminaries for
the Pacific Coast Championship. The
team also travels to Charleston, S.C. for
their Spring Invitational in February.
Charleston is the sight of the National
Championships and Middleton hopes
the Invitational will be a preview of
another appearance there.
Stanford has gone to the national
team racing championship each of the
past seven years.
"There is a certain amount of expec
tation that we will qualify," said the
Stanford coach. "We are definitely com
petitive, we just have to bring it up
another level."
