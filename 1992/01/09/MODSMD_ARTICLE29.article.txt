# Poll: Kids are high priority
## Children's issues top wishes for tax spending 
### Judy Hsu Staff writer 
A majority of Californians
consider children a top priority
and are even willing to pay more
taxes in support of children's
issues, according to a state poll
released yesterday at the Lucile
Salter Packard Children's Hos
pital at Stanford.
Guaranteeing that all chil
dren receive adequate health
care and a quality education,
live in safe neighborhoods and
have economic security topped
the list of how voters want their
tax dollars spent. Twenty-five
percent of those polled consid
ered children their first priority
over other issues such as
national health insurance,
lower taxes and the fight
against crime and drugs.
Lorraine Zippiroli, president
of Packard Children's Hospital,
said she was surprised at Cali
fornians' show of concern for
children because it "does not
match what's actually happen
ing in society."
California ranks 30th in the
nation in overall status of our
children, Zippiroli said. "If the
current trends continue, one
third of our children will live in
poverty by the year 2000," she
said.
Currently, one-fifth of the
children in California live in
poverty and a quarter of the
state's children have no access
to health care, she said.
Ninety-three percent of those
polled said it is important for
candidates to have a platform
focusing on children's issues.
Moreover, 69 percent said they

would be more likely to vote for
a candidate who supports
increased spending for chil
dren's programs even if it
means an increase in taxes.
Voters would support reallo
cation of tax monies to give chil
dren top priority, the survey
found. The survey also found
support among Californians for
increasing taxes for the wealthy
and corporations and on alco
hol.
The poll was part of a larger
national poll commissioned last
November by children's advoca
cy groups and the National
Association of Children's Hospi
tals, to which Packard Chil
dren's Hospital belongs.
Over 6,000 interviews were

conducted nationwide to deter
mine how Americans feel about
the health, education, safety
and security of our children.
Of the problems facing chil
dren, Californians ranked
equally the safety of neighbor
hoods, poverty among children
and declining education as the
most pressing dilemmas,
according to the poll. The
expense of a college education
was also a big concern.
"Stanford students are in the
perfect positions to let politi
cians know that they want
something done for kids," said
Zippiroli. She encouraged stu
dents to lobby law makers, and
vote for candidates who support
children's issues.
