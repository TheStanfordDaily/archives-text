Two years after the implemen

refund system caused a significant
drop in requests, student partici

have had the reverse effect. The
number of students applying for
fee refunds dropped from over
4,000 in fall quarter two years ago
to about 2,400 last quarter,
although that number may still

caused by the change. He predict-

again when students became
familiar with the process.
Mike Risch, ASSU Financial
Manager, could not be reached for

Besides the drop in applica

made the transition to computers
less than smooth.
Students have already encoun
