# Fee-refund requests down despite change
## 
### Katie Mauro Staff Writer 
Two years after the implemen
tation of a computerized fee
refund system caused a significant
drop in requests, student partici
pation still has not returned to its
previous level.
The system, intended to facili
tate the request process, seems to
have had the reverse effect. The
number of students applying for
fee refunds dropped from over
4,000 in fall quarter two years ago
to about 2,400 last quarter,
although that number may still
increase because the - extended
deadline has not passed.
About 2,700 students applied
in fall quarter, 1990, the first
time the new system was used.
Former ASSU Financial Man
ager Torrence Boone, who super
vised the switch, said last year
that he attributed the low appli
cation level to the confusion
caused by the change. He predict-

Ed that the numbers would rise
again when students became
familiar with the process.
Mike Risch, ASSU Financial
Manager, could not be reached for
comment yesterday.
Before the system was comput
erized, students filled out request
forms by hand and turned them
in individually. Now students
complete applications on comput
ers in Meyer Library and AlR
port, the Macintosh computer
cluster in Tresidder.
Any student who voted in the
last ASSU election or was not a
registered student at the time can
apply for a refund of all or some of
the quarterly fee they paid to
finance student groups.
Besides the drop in applica
tions, technical problems have
made the transition to computers
less than smooth.
Students have already encoun
tered two problems with the com-
puter program.
First, almost 500 files were
deleted after a mix-up at Meyer
Library. Amy Tzon, the computer
manager at Meyer library, deleted
the files which were supposed to
have been collected by the ASSU.
According to Risch, 300 people
reapplied for refunds, and he
expects even more before the dead
line. "Considering we still have
two and a half weeks left for the
application period, it seems that
not many people were discouraged
from reapplying," he said.
In order to avoid similar prob
lems this quarter, all the fee
refund files are now being saved
and processed in the ASSU offices.
Another obstacle to computer
izing fee refund files arose before
winter break. Differences in data
formats caused a crash in the new
computer system while files were
being transferred from the
ASSU's Macintoshes to the IBM
system of Bank of America, delay
ing the checks by two weeks.
