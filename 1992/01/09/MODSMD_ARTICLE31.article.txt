## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Ticket to Ride Biker's-eye view of area's best roads 
### Mark Byer Staff writer 
Biking . . whose effect
Holds such an enmity with
blood of man
That swift as quicksilver it
courses through
The natural gates and
alleys of the body,
And with a sudden vigor it
doth posset
And curd, like eager drop
pings into milk,
The thin and wholesome
blood. So did it mine,
And a most instant tetter
about,
Most lazar-like, with vile
and loathsome crust,
All my smooth body."
— William Shakespeare

Bicycling and Stanford go hand-in
hand, spoke-to-spoke. If you pay your
money to attend this esteemed scholarly
institution, gosh darn it, you should have
one of these contraptions.
But a bicycle is more than just a way to
get across campus — it is a "ticket to ride,"
a ticket to the many beautiful rides that
abound off-campus.
The first thing to consider is the basic
gear — forget the spandex and cleats, I
mean basic. At the top of the required list
is a helmet. No one in his or her left or
right mind should go on a ride off-campus
without a helmet. Light helmets are best
even a light helmet will feel like a piano
after four hours of riding.
Besides the helmet, you will need a
patch-kit for even the shortest of rides.
They don't cost much, but they'll save you
a long walk or a hitchhike with some scary
stranger in the back of a pick-up truck.
A pump is ideal but not necessary, espe
cially since the rides described here are

well-traversed. A few dollars is necessary
for emergencies and food. Sunglasses and
gloves are both items that fall between lux
ury and necessity. The only other things
needed are a bicycle . . . and somewhere to
go-
The Loop
"The Loop" is a ride for everyone.
Senior Coulter Richardson calls it"the
base (ride) upon which all the other rides
originate." The Loop can be taken clock
wise or counter-clockwise. Clockwise, the
ride starts at Alpine Road. To reach Alpine,
take Campus Drive to the Golf Course, a
right on Junipero Serra and then a left on
Alpine at the light. Alpine is a long, steady
uphill ride until it reaches Portola, which is
a distance of about two or three miles.
A right turn on Portola Road will lead to
a nice series of hills. At Sand Hill Road
you'll pass Jasper Biological Preserve and
find yourself facing a 30-mile-per-hour
downhill prior to a terrifying uphill.
Another nice long 40-mile-per-hour
downhill will take you across Interstate
280 and introduce you to "Anti-gravity

Hill," where with a tail-wind you will
effortlessly (this is the truth) float to the
top.
Now it is the time to pass cars on the
downhill to Junipero Serra, and then
HOME! Another word of caution: there is a
street sign here that I have come to love
over the years: "Bikes Merge With Autos."
Look for it.
There are many extensions to The Loop.
What begins as a basic 15-mile ride that
takes a little over 45 minutes can be
lengthened by adding such extensions as
the Page Mill-to-Arastredero-to-Alpine
route. There's even the Portola-to-Wood
side-to-Whiskey Hill extension that is
equally absorbing. And remember — there
is nothing wrong with getting lost. Part of
the joy of bicycling is discovering new
places at a self-made pace.
Hut if you're not interested in taking off
on your own, there are two biking groups
you can join. The Stanford Cycling Club
meets in front of the Post Office at 3:30
p.m. Monday through Friday.
Beginners are welcome anytime, but
you might want to start on a Monday or

Friday. These are the slower days when the
pace sometimes drops as low as 14 miles
per hour. Also Monday through Friday,
there is a group of racing-caliber bicyclists
that meets at the corner of Page Mill and
Junipero Serra at noon.
Flatland rides
The area surrounding campus is not
known for being linear. After all, Einstein
did show that space is curved, and Stanford
is no exception. In other words, there real
ly aren't a lot of flatland rides in the area.
One of the well-traversed flatland rides
is Foothill Expressway. This is not a specif
ic route like The Loop — ride Foothill until
your legs begin to ache, at which point stop
at some deli and grab some chow before
heading back.
Another flatland ride consists of taking
Junipero Serra north until it turns into
Alameda De Las Pulgas (which translates
to "Avenue of the Fleas," bv the way). Con
tinue on this road until you get tired and
pull a turn-around.

Canada Road is highly recom
mended. The amazing thing about
riding Canada is that every Sunday,
June through October, from 11
a.m. until 4 p.m., the road is closed
from Edgewood Road to Route 92
and open only to non-motorized
forms of traffic. Ryan Harris
described this time as an opportuni
ty to "mow down little children who
are on their tricycles."
All three of these rides are on
well-paved roads with ample bike
lanes, and cars are not a problem.
Skyline Ridge
Skyline Ridge, a.k.a. Route 35,
is an ideal road for bicycling.
Excellent road conditions, easy
turns and the Ansel Adamsesque
scenery make Skyline the bike
ride in the Bay Area.
The roads are a little narrow,
so there often isn't room for both
you and the many cars. Two
extraordinary vista points are
found 10 minutes south of King's
Mountain and five minutes north
of Page Mill. Don't stop too long
— excellent 40-mile-per-hour
downhills await you.
The natural beauty of the place
is enough to boggle our urbanized
minds. Smells and colors abound,
and the moist fingertips of fog
tickle the hairs on your skin. The
clear, clean air on top of Skyline
Ridge is a privilege granted only
to those pledges who initiate
themselves with the hour of rid
ing to reach the top.
Stanford Bicycling Club cap
tain Sacha Henchman said the
view of Stanford and the Bay Area

from the Ridge "feels like, WOW!
I go to schoolhere. Then I chuck
le at friends who go to schools on
the East Coast."
Bicycling up on Skyline gives
one an opportunity to "get to see
Stanford in perspective. It's just a
little dot," according to senior
Rebecca Wiggles worth.
A few things should be kept in
mind before making the ascent to
Skyline Ridge. First, be aware of
the weather. When it is foggy it
will be cold and windy, so wear
long sweats and a jacket. Even so,
don't forget your water bottle.
There are basically seven ways
to tackle the climb to Skyline. I
will proceed to describe each one
of them from North to South, wich
is only logical since the Union beat
the Confederacy in the Civil War.
• Route 92 is a main thorough
fare that those fuzzy beach bun
nies and grizzly beach bums trav
el in order to get to Half Moon
Bay. Because of the traffic and the
fact that the bike lanes are gener
ally small and badly paved, Route
92 is recommended only on week
ends when the traffic jams make
it safe. Leaving Stanford around
10 a.m. will allow you to time it
just right so that, as Richardson
puts it, "You get to flip your nose
at all the cars stuck in traffic.
"I actually derive a great deal
of enjoyment from that," he
added.
The ride there takes a little
over 30 minutes at a decent pace
and the climb about equally long.
• Next on the list is King's
Mountain. King's Mountain is a
relatively even climb that rises to
one of the highest elevations on
Skyline. Most of the climb is in
the shade of redwood trees, and
the smell is just wonderful!
The climb itself takes about 30

minutes at about six miles per
hour, which tends to be a com
fortable to medium-hard pace.
There are some great views on the
way up, where one can see over
the entire Bay Area.
An added bonus comes with
the knowledge that King's Moun
tain makes an awesome downhill
ride. Its quick, darting turns with
periods of intense braking and
adrenaline anguish make it one of
the preferable descent routes. The
pavement is smooth, and the
banking on the turns is right for
maximum G-forces.
• Route 84, otherwise known
as La Honda, is another good
ascent and descent combination.
Although it is a main thorough
fare, Route 84 does not have what
one could call "heavy traffic." It is
also a ride among the redwoods
and is a particularly awesome
downhill.
One of the reasons that it is a
comfortable downhill is that the
majority of tight turns are
marked with suggested speeds. So
if it is your first time on that road
you'll be able to judge the turns
better. Also, since most of the
time the cars can go no faster
than the bicyclists, you are passed
fewer times. Route 84 is directly
off of Woodside.
• Old La Honda is the uphill of
choice. The shade provided by the
redwood forest that surrounds
this one-lane windy uphill makes
it nice and cool on the hotter days.
An added bonus to this road's
respectability is that there are no
cars to worry about.
However, I would not recom
mend Old La Honda for downhill
riding pleasure — thrills maybe,
but not pleasure. The pavement is
rather uneven, not a factor con
siderable in the ascent, but

painful for the family jewels on
the descent. Also, one must take
into consideration that a one-lane
road, typically with a few wet
spots, potholes and tight blind
turns is not recommended by
your chiropractor.
• Alpine Road, otherwise
known as the "Superhighway" by
mountain-bikers and even a few
road-bikers, turns into a dirt fire
road about a mile after it inter
sects with Portola. Wigglesworth
says the dirt-road ride is possible
on a road bike.
• Page Mill Road is a brutal,
eight-mile ascent to one of the
higher points on Skyline. During
the course of the climb, there are
some level sections, downhills and
even some uphills that resemble
Mt. Everest in grade.
The pounding that the upper
thighs take is well worth the
view. Since the ride is more than
90 percent unshaded, expect it to
be uncomfortably warm. Howev
er, once cresting the top, there
will be substantial winds that
work to dry the sweat in no time,
chilling the body down uncom
fortably.
Keep in mind that turning
back on Page Mill is merely self
induced defeat. Don't even stop
for a break, just keep on pounding
the thighs. To put it simply, as
Richardson did, "It's going to
hurt, it's going to hurt, it's going
to hurt."
The descent is a little more
risky than the ascent. However,
"Any good descent is a gnarly
one," Richardson says, "Because
the more you concentrate on your
form the faster you go, and the
better it gets." Because Page Mill
isn't banked to the highest of
standards, and because there are
some hairpins that seem to come

out of nowhere, I would think
that Page Mill definitely qualifies
for the classification of a gnarly
descent. Cars are generally not a
problem on this road.
• Route 9 is the last way to get
up to Skyline. Wide bike lanes and
an even grade make the six-mile
long Route 9 worth it. The cars
are sparse, but existent — not
that it matters, for the ride itself
is so nice.

It will take some time to get to
the top, but it will be well worth
the pain and suffering that the
gluteus maximus will go through.
Route 9 brings you to one of the
highest peaks up on Skyline and
does it in the shade. What more
could someone beg for? Route 9
also makes a fine descent at an
even pace with most cars, where
the tight turns are well marked
with signs.
