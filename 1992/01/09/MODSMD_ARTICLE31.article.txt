## THE
						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Ticket to Ride Biker's-eye view of area's best roads 
### Mark Byer Staff writer 
Biking . . whose effect
Holds such an enmity with
blood of man
That swift as quicksilver it
courses through
The natural gates and
alleys of the body,
And with a sudden vigor it
doth posset
And curd, like eager drop
pings into milk,
The thin and wholesome
blood. So did it mine,
And a most instant tetter
about,
Most lazar-like, with vile
and loathsome crust,
All my smooth body."
— William Shakespeare

Bicycling and Stanford go hand-in
hand, spoke-to-spoke. If you pay your
money to attend this esteemed scholarly
institution, gosh darn it, you should have
one of these contraptions.
But a bicycle is more than just a way to
get across campus — it is a "ticket to ride,"
a ticket to the many beautiful rides that
abound off-campus.
The first thing to consider is the basic
gear — forget the spandex and cleats, I
mean basic. At the top of the required list
is a helmet. No one in his or her left or
right mind should go on a ride off-campus
without a helmet. Light helmets are best
even a light helmet will feel like a piano
after four hours of riding.
Besides the helmet, you will need a
patch-kit for even the shortest of rides.
They don't cost much, but they'll save you
a long walk or a hitchhike with some scary
stranger in the back of a pick-up truck.
A pump is ideal but not necessary, espe
cially since the rides described here are

well-traversed. A few dollars is necessary
for emergencies and food. Sunglasses and
gloves are both items that fall between lux
ury and necessity. The only other things
needed are a bicycle . . . and somewhere to
go-
The Loop
"The Loop" is a ride for everyone.
Senior Coulter Richardson calls it"the
base (ride) upon which all the other rides
originate." The Loop can be taken clock
wise or counter-clockwise. Clockwise, the
ride starts at Alpine Road. To reach Alpine,
take Campus Drive to the Golf Course, a
right on Junipero Serra and then a left on
Alpine at the light. Alpine is a long, steady
uphill ride until it reaches Portola, which is
a distance of about two or three miles.
A right turn on Portola Road will lead to
a nice series of hills. At Sand Hill Road
you'll pass Jasper Biological Preserve and
find yourself facing a 30-mile-per-hour
downhill prior to a terrifying uphill.
Another nice long 40-mile-per-hour
downhill will take you across Interstate
280 and introduce you to "Anti-gravity

Hill," where with a tail-wind you will
effortlessly (this is the truth) float to the
top.
Now it is the time to pass cars on the
downhill to Junipero Serra, and then
HOME! Another word of caution: there is a
street sign here that I have come to love
over the years: "Bikes Merge With Autos."
Look for it.
There are many extensions to The Loop.
What begins as a basic 15-mile ride that
takes a little over 45 minutes can be
lengthened by adding such extensions as
the Page Mill-to-Arastredero-to-Alpine
route. There's even the Portola-to-Wood
side-to-Whiskey Hill extension that is
equally absorbing. And remember — there
is nothing wrong with getting lost. Part of
the joy of bicycling is discovering new
places at a self-made pace.
Hut if you're not interested in taking off
on your own, there are two biking groups
you can join. The Stanford Cycling Club
meets in front of the Post Office at 3:30
p.m. Monday through Friday.
Beginners are welcome anytime, but
you might want to start on a Monday or

Friday. These are the slower days when the
pace sometimes drops as low as 14 miles
per hour. Also Monday through Friday,
there is a group of racing-caliber bicyclists
that meets at the corner of Page Mill and
Junipero Serra at noon.
Flatland rides
The area surrounding campus is not
known for being linear. After all, Einstein
did show that space is curved, and Stanford
is no exception. In other words, there real
ly aren't a lot of flatland rides in the area.
One of the well-traversed flatland rides
is Foothill Expressway. This is not a specif
ic route like The Loop — ride Foothill until
your legs begin to ache, at which point stop
at some deli and grab some chow before
heading back.
Another flatland ride consists of taking
Junipero Serra north until it turns into
Alameda De Las Pulgas (which translates
to "Avenue of the Fleas," bv the way). Con
tinue on this road until you get tired and
pull a turn-around.
