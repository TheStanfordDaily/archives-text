# The
						unavoidable truth — becoming your parents
## 
### 
Never make love to your
own past. Don't even flirt.
At best you'll wind up with
that photo-album glue all over
your body. And that's just fooling
yourself.
Going home for break, I got a
glimpse of the person I once was.
And, to be perfectly honest, I was
kind of attracted. Almost as
attracted as 1 am to some of those
in-between, multicultural faces at
the end of the new Michael Jack
son video.
Driving myself through my
ever-popular, self-guided narcis
sus tour, each stop seemed more
vibrant and dashing than the last:
the house that held the only
Sweet 16 I ever threw up at, the
alley from which I stole my first
bowling pin, the first place I ever
made money betting someone I
could make my nipples hard with
out touching myself.

None of that was me anymore.
A successful Saturday night now
simply entails spending more
time watching the movie than
walking around Blockbuster.
And right in my own house,
juxtaposed with the memories of
the old me, was the ghost of the
future me: my parents.
Now too lazy to eit her go to the
movies or drive to Blockbuster,
my parents sit at home and dream
of a day when pay-per-view will

offer them a viewing selection
beyond the World Wrestling Fed
eration. It's all they talk about.
"One day, son ..."
"Yeah, Dad?"
"One day, your mother and I
will be able to lie right here on
this bed, call up the cable compa
ny, punch a few buttons into the
telephone and watch whichever
volume of 'I Claudius' we damn
well please."
"You think so, Dad?"
"You can bet on it, son."
I walked away, perplexed by
my father's Shatneresque fanta
sy. I couldn't help but compare it
to my own Christmas break diet
of MTV, Nintendo, and portions
of badly dubbed, "Showtime
Afterhours" movies.
1 was becoming my parents.
My future was bleak. I needed no
shades. I saw visions of myself
coming home from work, taking

off my cardigan and dress shoes,
and reminding whoever happened
to be in a five-mile radius of the
house to "call grandma."
Even over the short weeks of
Christmas break the frightening
transformation had already
begun. I had lost my verve, my
vim, my natural zest for life.
But I'm not going to worry
about it. Until the day I actually
become so much like my parents
that I order coffee after meals just
so I can sit there for hours and
talk about Oliver Stone movies —
well, until then I'm just going to
try to do whatever it is I feel like
doing, whether it's sending
friends blurry photocopies of
enormous cysts or just sitting
around and talking about lower
back pain.
