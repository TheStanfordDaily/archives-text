# SCREEN
## A 						brief glimpse at several L.A. stories 
### Ari Richter Editorial staff 
Increase the peace, find the
one thing and maybe life will
work out.
Often gripping, sometimes
corny, Lawrence Kasdan's
newest film, "Grand Canyon,"
recounts the lives of six Los
Angeles residents with striking
echoes from three of last sum
mer's movies.
From "Boyz 'N the Hood"
comes the omnipresent police
helicopter hovering over the
senseless violence of South Cen
tral Los Angeles. From "City
Slickers" comes the therapeutic
power of a majestic landscape —
the Grand Canyon itself. And
from "Barton Fink" comes a pal
pable absurdity preying on all the
characters' lives.
What these parts add up to is a
very realistic portrayal of life —
from its most tragic moments to
its most laughable, from its most
anxious to its most ridiculous.
Thus Kasdan, who also
directed "Body Heat" and"The
Big Chill," tells a story that is at
once rivetingly disturbing and
ludicrously hokey. And because
of the latter, some audiences
will doubtless scoff at the
movie's seemingly trivial solu
tion to the weighty problems
evident in all strata of L.A. life.
But "Grand Canyon" succeeds
because of its realism; life is
sometimes hokey.
A variety of characters woven

into Kasdan's screenplay con
tribute to the realism of "Grand
Canyon." Between them, they
cover a wide spectrum of person
ality types, speaking and acting
like real people in their respective
walks of life.
Danny Glover gives a strong
performance as a tow-truck oper
ator who saves Kevin Kline and
his Lexus when the car breaks
down on Kline's way home from a
Laker game. Kline, whose life was
saved once before by a complete
stranger, wants to make sure he
doesn't let his savior vanish from
his life this time around and
forges a friendship with Glover.
Once this connection is made,
their lives move closer and closer
together, intermingling not only
these two representatives of the
blue- and white-collar worlds, but
also their acquaintances and rela
tives.
Mary McDonnell, Mary-Louise
Parker, Alfre Woodard and Steve
Martin, all of whom play their
roles very well, fill the rest of the
movie's marquee.
Made by people from the
wealthy part of Los Angeles,
"Grand Canyon" is necessarily
more insightful in its examina
tions of Kline's world than it is
when looking into Glover's. Yet
"Grand Canyon" is even honest
about its limitations and succeeds
as a result.

"Grand Canyon" opens tomorrow
at Century Cinema 10 in Mountain
View.
