# 'Lunch' does more than regurgitate
## 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
When the main character's
wife started shooting bug-exter
minating powder into the vein in
her left breast, I knew this was a
strange movie.
When a giant insect asked to
have the powder rubbed onto an
anal-looking aperture on his
back, I was pretty sure the mush

rooms in my Beef Negimaki
weren't Shitake.
But when a typewriter meta
morphosed into an android with
an enormous phallic protrusion
and then leaped off the table to
engage in a menage-a-trois with
two human characters, I knew
this was an art film.
David Cronenberg, the direc
tor who brought you psychotic,
identical-twin, gynecologists in

"Dead Ringers" and exploding
minds in "Scanners," has
achieved a surrealism with both
a major budget and a contiguous
storyline. Like many art films,
"Naked Lunch" may jump spas
tically between psychadelic and
sardonic, but the movie never
becomes so self-absorbed that it
strays from the point at hand —
the pyschoanalysis of the artist
as a young junkie.

Declining to embark upon the
impossible task of translating
William Burroughs' 1959 liter
ary classic "Naked Lunch" to the
screen — it would necessitate the
violation of many rules of first
order logic, as well as several
child pornography laws — Cro
nenberg decides instead to draw
upon several Burroughsian texts
as well as biographical events.
The movie chronicles Bur
roughs' creative process in writ
ing the novel and includes such
documented events as the
author's "William Tell" murder
of his wife and his drug addic
tions. And the movie particularly
concentrates on his interaction
with Paul and Jane Bowles and
her vodoo-wielding companion
Cherifa in the International
Zone of Tangier, a place where
expatriates in the '50s — such as
Kerrouac, Ginsberg and Bur
roughs — went to escape laws
concerning narcotics and homo
sexuality, as well as their own
pasts.
Wielding a healthy dose of
artsy metaphor, Cronenberg is
able to delve into the expunging
nature of the writing process. He
creates his own creatures and
exotic drugs and thereby forces
the viewer to deal with the issues
he is presenting, leaving no liter
al level to investigate.
Nevertheless, the movie never
employs metaphor or symbolism
to such an extent that the movie
loses its believability or enjoya
bility — allowing the film, like
Joel and Ethan Coen's "Barton
Fink," to remain accessible to
the mainstream without losing
its avant-guard nature.
