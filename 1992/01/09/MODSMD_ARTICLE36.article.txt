# 1960s throwbacks with 1990s toys

If you happen to be cruising through
White Plaza when the time is right and the
circle is complete, you might get a look at
them, baggin' to the blues. The radio is blar
ing the tunes of Walter "Wolfman" Wash
ington, and the footbag is flying from one
foot to the next.
The unofficial Stanford Footbag Club
congregates at White Plaza every Tuesday
from 3 p.m. to sundown and most Sundays
at 2 p.m. — rain or shine. It doesn't matter.
This seemingly obscure club was founded
by Steve Goldberg, who received his mas
ter's in computer science from Stanford in
1988. Since its establishment, the Stanford
Footbag Club has increased in size, reaching
25 to 30 alternating participants. The mem
bers range from undergraduate to graduated
students — from alumni to local footbag
worshipers.
The basic idea behind the sport is to make
sure the footbag (a small, loosely bean-filled
bag best known as the hackey sack) does not
bounce. It thus becomes the sole responsibil
ity of those making up the circle to keep the
bag from hitting the ground.
"It's not working together," one member of
the group explained. "It'splaying together."
Everyone is encouraged to join in if they
pass by and are interested. "Often people
just sit and stare and say how cool that looks
and don't join because they think that we
don't want to be bothered by beginners,"
according to Goldberg. This, however, is
hardly the case, he said. The group is always
willing to work with beginners, and they
enjoy having new people join the group, even
if it's just for an afternoon.
Some of the terminology that is common
ly tossed around is truly amusing, consisting
of words like "spaunch," which means to
mess up a trick or to miss a footbag passed to
you; "death spiral," which means a series of
tricks doomed for failure; and "shredder,"
which means one who "jams" well and
doesn't spaunch.
The phenomenon of footbags has spread
to such a degree that there is an organiza
tion known as the World Footbag Associa
tion (WFA), which holds international tour
naments every year.
The tournament events can be broken
down into four categories: Net, a game simi
lar to badminton but played with the feet;
Freestyle, which is a routine choreographed
to music; Golf, self-explanatory; and Consec
utives, a category that tests how long one can
keep the bag in the air and how many times
it is kicked.
Two of the regular White Plaza kickers
are Jody and Brent Welch. Jody, a graduate

of UC-Berkeley and a third-grade teacher at
Los Altos, is now the No. 1 WFA Women's
Overall Champion. Her husband, Brent, also
a Berkeley graduate, holds the No. 3 position
in the men's division.
Watching Jody in action is so impressive
that she remarked teasingly, "The women
that the guys stare at are all looking at me."
This was quickly responded to by fellow kick

er, Brent Stewart, with: "We're saying, 'Hey
look at us!' and the girls are saying, 'Wow!
She's got some legs.'"
So feel free to stop by any time you see
them and "kick off some steam," as club
member Brian Land put it. They are espe
cially eager to teach beginners, and they
even managed to have me kick a few. Unfor
tunately I spaunched fairly quickly.

Jody Welch flies high in pursuit of the ever-elusive footbag. The Stanford Footbag Club
invites anyone to join them any afternoon in White Plaza.
