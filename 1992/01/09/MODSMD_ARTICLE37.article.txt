# Rounding up a year of musical diversity
## 
### 
Iwas looking at my list of
1991'8 10 best albums — jour
nalists just love year-end lists,
whether it's rating albums,
movies, books or flamingoes —
and I began to wonder what Bill
Graham and Miles Davis would
have thought of it.
Both men died in 1991 at a
time when their personal visions
about diversity in music were
needed more than ever. Through
Graham's Fillmore shows in the
'60s, which would freely team
rock and jazz acts, and Davis'
fusion projects, which decimated
the wall between rock and jazz,
the success of these two giants
proved audiences didn't fit into
neat, segregated musical cate
gories.
Thirty years later, the music
industry still hasn't received
either Graham's or Davis' wake
up call: trade magazines like
Rolling Stone still follow the sta
tus quo to the exclusion of every
thing else; MTV still segregates
its videos depending on whether
they're "rap," "metal" or "alter
native." Most radio stations still
only play Led Zeppelin IV.
The artists on my list chal
lenged music stereotyping by
blending musical styles and
threatened the process of pigeon
holing music as either rap or
rock, thrash or dance, reggae or
country.
With marquee artists like Pub
lic Enemy and tours like Lolla
palooza chipping away at the
huge, monolithic stereotyping
machine, maybe music, like
Berlin, can break down some of
its own archaic walls.
Public Enemy — ApocaJypse '91
... The Enemy Strikes Black
Though this list is in no partic
ular order, P.E.'s new album once
again takes the Palm d'or.
Despite strong releases by Ice-T,
3rd Bass and L.L. Cool J, rap was
still maligned by charges that
artists like N.W.A. and Ice Cube
are misogynists and anti-Semitic.
I suspect even this album suf
fered from the ol' PC standard.
Though the album was gener
ally praised, it was also somewhat
dismissed by the press as not

measuring up to 1990's "Fear of a
Black Planet," and hard stances
on volatile race issues alienated
some. Yet seen as a reply to
"Black Planet" (hence the
album's title), this album and
group continue to examine the
harsh realities of today's society.

Natalie Cole — Unforgettable
I took offense at one critic who
called this album a yuppie sensa
tion. Did baby-boomers with
beamers really buy this album?
Fine. Good.
Her faithful interpretations of
her father's legacy are outstand
ing. While this album stands
proudly on its own, it probably
wouldn't hurt for some of us
under 50 to pull out a Nat King
Cole album from our parents' col
lection.
Metallica
The group that basically creat
ed and defined 'thrash' metal
finally made it accessible to rock
fans, while still creating the most
sonically heavy album of their
career. Singer/songwriter James
Hettfield revealed new-found
depth and maturity in his song
writing, and the band's first true
ballad, "The Unforgiven," is
amazing. Time will prove this
album one of metal's finest.
Ziggy Marley — Jahmekya
1991 marked the 10th anniver
sary of Bob Marley's tragic death
and saw everyone affiliated with
him, from his mother to his ex
band The Wailers, release albums.
Like solid albums by Rita Mar
ley and former I-Three Judy
Mowatt, Ziggy's seamless blend
of traditional reggae, rap and hip

Rambler
hop brings his father's music into
the '90s while his voice and pres
ence as an artist and performer
blooms gloriously. Like his father,
Ziggy seems destined to be one of
a handful of third-world artists to
reach global popularity.
Nirvana — Nevermind
Though the single "Smells Like
Teen Spirit" is not my personal
mantra (I prefer the Anthrax/P.E.
collaboration "Bring tha Noise."),

there's no denying the sheer
force and energy of the song and
the entire album. This Seattle
trio with punk sensibilities
made metal-heads sit up and
take notice, and thanks to MTV
exposure so did the rest of the
nation.
George Winston — Summer
The man who put Windham
Hill on .hi map may be bloated
with pretension as his critics
claim, but this collection of solo
piano pieces is simple in its pre
sentation and exquisite in its exe
cution. Maybe I'm getting old, but
this one soothes as it coats.

Guns 'n' Roses — Use Your
Illusion II
Though Skid Row's "Slave to
the Grind" was just as good and
only took 50 minutes, G 'n' R has
to get the nod if only for the fact
they actually delivered another
harrowingly raw album after all
the hype. In fact, they delivered
two.
An edited combination of both
"Illusion" albums would
undoubtedly have been best, but
this album may be the sloppiest,
most pleasing rock album since
the Stones' "Exile on Main
Street." Guitarist Izzy Stradlin's

contribution to both albums
makes his departure from the
group troubling; especially when
he's a better singer/songwriter
than Axl Rose. Get rid of Axl, and
bring back Izzy.
John Prine — The Lost Years
Winner of this year's John
Hiatt singer/songwriter award,
this California songwriter who's
been kicking around for years,
recorded this upbeat, folkish
album in Nashville with the help
of Tom Petty and the Heartbreak
ers, Bruce Springsteen, Bonnie
Raitt and John Mellencamp and
outdid them all. His wrv humor

and warm delivery contrast with
last year's best Nashville album,
Rosanne Cash's stark "Interiors."
Dire Straits — On Every
Street
Roundly and soundly panned
by all, including myself, the subtle
country flavoring of this album
shows the impact of Knopfler's
collaboration with country great
Chet Atkins on last year's "Neck
& Neck." The rhythm in his songs
is more fluid than ever, and
frankly I'm tired of hearing that
"Making Movies" is the end-all in
Dire Straits albums. This album
is true to the direction Knopfler

has always been headed.
Garth Brooks — No Fences
Personally, I don't like this
album. U2's "Achtung Baby" is
probably better, but it was dis
qualified for the Hollywood,
"let's-slip-it-in-under-the-wire
for-Oscar-consideration move."
Prince's album was also better,
but he should have been this good
throughout the '80s. In the end I
can't ignore the fact that this
country album stayed atop the
pop charts longer than any other
album in 1991 and reminded
everyone that country isn't just
for s—t kickers.

writing, and the band's first true
ballad, "The Unforgiven," is
amazing. Time will prove this
album one of metal's finest.
Ziggy Marley — Jahmekya
1991 marked the 10th anniver
sary of Bob Marley's tragic death
and saw everyone affiliated with
him, from his mother to his ex
band The Wailers, release albums.
Like solid albums by Rita Mar

of traditional reggae, rap and hip

Midnight
Rambler
hop brings his father's music into
the '90s while his voice and pres
ence as an artist and performer
blooms gloriously. Like his father,
Ziggy seems destined to be one of
a handful of third-world artists to
reach global popularity.
Nirvana — Nevermind
Though the single "Smells Like
Teen Spirit" is not my personal
mantra (I prefer the Anthrax/P.E.
collaboration "Bring tha Noise."),

there's no denying the sheer
force and energy of the song and
the entire album. This Seattle
trio with punk sensibilities
made metal-heads sit up and
take notice, and thanks to MTV
exposure so did the rest of the
nation.
George Winston — Summer
The man who put Windham
Hill on .hi map may be bloated
with pretension as his critics
claim, but this collection of solo
piano pieces is simple in its pre
sentation and exquisite in its exe
cution. Maybe I'm getting old, but
this one soothes as it coats.

Guns 'n' Roses — Use Your
Illusion II
Though Skid Row's "Slave to
the Grind" was just as good and
only took 50 minutes, G 'n' R has
to get the nod if only for the fact
they actually delivered another
harrowingly raw album after all
the hype. In fact, they delivered
two.
An edited combination of both
"Illusion" albums would
undoubtedly have been best, but
this album may be the sloppiest,
most pleasing rock album since
the Stones' "Exile on Main
Street." Guitarist Izzy Stradlin's

contribution to both albums
makes his departure from the
group troubling; especially when
he's a better singer/songwriter
than Axl Rose. Get rid of Axl, and
bring back Izzy.
John Prine — The Lost Years
Winner of this year's John
Hiatt singer/songwriter award,
this California songwriter who's
been kicking around for years,
recorded this upbeat, folkish
album in Nashville with the help
of Tom Petty and the Heartbreak
ers, Bruce Springsteen, Bonnie
Raitt and John Mellencamp and
outdid them all. His wrv humor

and warm delivery contrast with
last year's best Nashville album,
Rosanne Cash's stark "Interiors."
Dire Straits — On Every
Street
Roundly and soundly panned
by all, including myself, the subtle
country flavoring of this album
shows the impact of Knopfler's
collaboration with country great
Chet Atkins on last year's "Neck
& Neck." The rhythm in his songs
is more fluid than ever, and
frankly I'm tired of hearing that
"Making Movies" is the end-all in
Dire Straits albums. This album
is true to the direction Knopfler

has always been headed.
Garth Brooks — No Fences
Personally, I don't like this
album. U2's "Achtung Baby" is
probably better, but it was dis
qualified for the Hollywood,
"let's-slip-it-in-under-the-wire
for-Oscar-consideration move."
Prince's album was also better,
but he should have been this good
throughout the '80s. In the end I
can't ignore the fact that this
country album stayed atop the
pop charts longer than any other
album in 1991 and reminded
everyone that country isn't just
for s—t kickers.
Iwas looking at my list of
1991'8 10 best albums — jour
nalists just love year-end lists,
whether it's rating albums,
movies, books or flamingoes —
and I began to wonder what Bill
Graham and Miles Davis would
have thought of it.
Both men died in 1991 at a
time when their personal visions
about diversity in music were
needed more than ever. Through
Graham's Fillmore shows in the
'60s, which would freely team
rock and jazz acts, and Davis'
fusion projects, which decimated
the wall between rock and jazz,
the success of these two giants
proved audiences didn't fit into
neat, segregated musical cate
gories.
Thirty years later, the music
industry still hasn't received
either Graham's or Davis' wake
up call: trade magazines like
Rolling Stone still follow the sta
tus quo to the exclusion of every
thing else; MTV still segregates
its videos depending on whether
they're "rap," "metal" or "alter
native." Most radio stations still
only play Led Zeppelin IV.
The artists on my list chal
lenged music stereotyping by
blending musical styles and
threatened the process of pigeon
holing music as either rap or
rock, thrash or dance, reggae or
country.
With marquee artists like Pub
lic Enemy and tours like Lolla
palooza chipping away at the
huge, monolithic stereotyping
machine, maybe music, like
Berlin, can break down some of
its own archaic walls.
Public Enemy — ApocaJypse '91
... The Enemy Strikes Black
Though this list is in no partic
ular order, P.E.'s new album once
again takes the Palm d'or.
Despite strong releases by Ice-T,
3rd Bass and L.L. Cool J, rap was
still maligned by charges that
artists like N.W.A. and Ice Cube
are misogynists and anti-Semitic.
I suspect even this album suf
fered from the ol' PC standard.
Though the album was gener
ally praised, it was also somewhat
dismissed by the press as not

measuring up to 1990's "Fear of a
Black Planet," and hard stances
on volatile race issues alienated
some. Yet seen as a reply to
"Black Planet" (hence the
album's title), this album and
group continue to examine the
harsh realities of today's society.

Natalie Cole — Unforgettable
I took offense at one critic who
called this album a yuppie sensa
tion. Did baby-boomers with
beamers really buy this album?
Fine. Good.
Her faithful interpretations of
her father's legacy are outstand
ing. While this album stands
proudly on its own, it probably
wouldn't hurt for some of us
under 50 to pull out a Nat King
Cole album from our parents' col
lection.
Metallica
The group that basically creat
ed and defined 'thrash' metal
finally made it accessible to rock
fans, while still creating the most
sonically heavy album of their
career. Singer/songwriter James
Hettfield revealed new-found
depth and maturity in his song
writing, and the band's first true
ballad, "The Unforgiven," is
amazing. Time will prove this
album one of metal's finest.
