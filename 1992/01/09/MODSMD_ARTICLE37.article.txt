# Rounding up a year of musical diversity
## 
### 
Iwas looking at my list of
1991'8 10 best albums — jour
nalists just love year-end lists,
whether it's rating albums,
movies, books or flamingoes —
and I began to wonder what Bill
Graham and Miles Davis would
have thought of it.
Both men died in 1991 at a
time when their personal visions
about diversity in music were
needed more than ever. Through
Graham's Fillmore shows in the
'60s, which would freely team
rock and jazz acts, and Davis'
fusion projects, which decimated
the wall between rock and jazz,
the success of these two giants
proved audiences didn't fit into
neat, segregated musical cate
gories.
Thirty years later, the music
industry still hasn't received
either Graham's or Davis' wake
up call: trade magazines like
Rolling Stone still follow the sta
tus quo to the exclusion of every
thing else; MTV still segregates
its videos depending on whether
they're "rap," "metal" or "alter
native." Most radio stations still
only play Led Zeppelin IV.
The artists on my list chal
lenged music stereotyping by
blending musical styles and
threatened the process of pigeon
holing music as either rap or
rock, thrash or dance, reggae or
country.
With marquee artists like Pub
lic Enemy and tours like Lolla
palooza chipping away at the
huge, monolithic stereotyping
machine, maybe music, like
Berlin, can break down some of
its own archaic walls.
Public Enemy — ApocaJypse '91
... The Enemy Strikes Black
Though this list is in no partic
ular order, P.E.'s new album once
again takes the Palm d'or.
Despite strong releases by Ice-T,
3rd Bass and L.L. Cool J, rap was
still maligned by charges that
artists like N.W.A. and Ice Cube
are misogynists and anti-Semitic.
I suspect even this album suf
fered from the ol' PC standard.
Though the album was gener
ally praised, it was also somewhat
dismissed by the press as not

measuring up to 1990's "Fear of a
Black Planet," and hard stances
on volatile race issues alienated
some. Yet seen as a reply to
"Black Planet" (hence the
album's title), this album and
group continue to examine the
harsh realities of today's society.

Natalie Cole — Unforgettable
I took offense at one critic who
called this album a yuppie sensa
tion. Did baby-boomers with
beamers really buy this album?
Fine. Good.
Her faithful interpretations of
her father's legacy are outstand
ing. While this album stands
proudly on its own, it probably
wouldn't hurt for some of us
under 50 to pull out a Nat King
Cole album from our parents' col
lection.
Metallica
The group that basically creat
ed and defined 'thrash' metal
finally made it accessible to rock
fans, while still creating the most
sonically heavy album of their
career. Singer/songwriter James
Hettfield revealed new-found
depth and maturity in his song
writing, and the band's first true
ballad, "The Unforgiven," is
amazing. Time will prove this
album one of metal's finest.
Ziggy Marley — Jahmekya
1991 marked the 10th anniver
sary of Bob Marley's tragic death
and saw everyone affiliated with
him, from his mother to his ex
band The Wailers, release albums.
Like solid albums by Rita Mar
ley and former I-Three Judy
Mowatt, Ziggy's seamless blend
of traditional reggae, rap and hip
