# Another plan for Cowell fee
## Officials call for lower bill than one rejected this week 
### Cecilia Tom Senior staff writer 
Cowell officials whipped out another plan for
budget cuts yesterday afternoon that calls for a
quarterly fee of $8 after the Cabinet Committee
on Budget and Strategic Planning rejected a high
er fee proposal on Monday.
Both the original and current proposal would pre
serve the specialty referral service offered by Cowell
Student Health Center, which annually costs about
$300,000 — about half ofCowell's budget-reduction
target. If the fee is rejected, Cowell officials said they
would be forced to raise health insurance premiums
to meet their budget cutting target.

A rise in premiums would adversely affect stu
dents on the Stanford-sponsored insurance plan,
a group that includes 70 percent of all graduate
students, said Cowell Director Harvey Weinstein.
The new fee would distribute health care costs
among all students with minimal effect on insur
ance premiums, Weinstein said.
Weinstein spoke during an open meeting in
Tresidder Union last night to gauge student opin
ion on budget cuts. Only one student who does
not belong to the committees involved attended,
but Cowell staff members and University and stu
dent committee members seized the opportunity
