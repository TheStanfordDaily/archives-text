# Another plan for Cowell fee
## Officials call for lower bill than one rejected this week 
### Cecilia Tom Senior staff writer 
Cowell officials whipped out another plan for
budget cuts yesterday afternoon that calls for a
quarterly fee of $8 after the Cabinet Committee
on Budget and Strategic Planning rejected a high
er fee proposal on Monday.
Both the original and current proposal would pre
serve the specialty referral service offered by Cowell
Student Health Center, which annually costs about
$300,000 — about half ofCowell's budget-reduction
target. If the fee is rejected, Cowell officials said they
would be forced to raise health insurance premiums
to meet their budget cutting target.

A rise in premiums would adversely affect stu
dents on the Stanford-sponsored insurance plan,
a group that includes 70 percent of all graduate
students, said Cowell Director Harvey Weinstein.
The new fee would distribute health care costs
among all students with minimal effect on insur
ance premiums, Weinstein said.
Weinstein spoke during an open meeting in
Tresidder Union last night to gauge student opin
ion on budget cuts. Only one student who does
not belong to the committees involved attended,
but Cowell staff members and University and stu
dent committee members seized the opportunity

Members of the Cowell staff and the Cabinet Committee on Budget and Strategic Planning discuss
budget cutting at an open forum iast night. Cowell officials yesterday proposed a new student fee,
lower than one rejected earlier this week, to help the health center survive budget cuts.
to further discuss the plan.
Sally Mahoney, acting vice pres
ident for Student Resources, said
the case for a fee is compelling and
that she hopes the Cabinet com
mittee would be convinced this
time. The committee rejected a
$14 quarterly fee proposal because
students would have to pay more,
whether the fee is charged as an
increase in tuition or as a separate
item, Mahoney said.

Cowell's new proposal differs
from the original one in that it pre
serves after-hours care, in a scaled
down operation, to reduce emer-
room usage and costs while
cutting more of Cowell's core ser
vices. Among the targets are the
fitness/injury prevention specialist
and the clinical nutritionist.
The new proposal would create a
leaner Cowell, so the fee would not
need to be as high, Weinstein said.
Mahoney said she is not con
sidering adjusting the 15 percent
budget cut target for Cowell.
"A compelling financial case
has been made in the context of a

reduced Cowell program," and
since Student Resources has a
firm reduction target of $2.25 mil
liqn, changing Cowell's target
would mean adjusting the budgets
of other departments, she said.
Council of Presidents member
John Overdeck, a member of the
Student Resources budget com
mittee, disagreed. He said he sup
ports lowering the reduction tar
get to five or six percent because
Cowell cannot sustain more cuts.
Various committee members
urge students to offer their opin
ions tonight at 7 p.m. in Kresge
Auditorium.
