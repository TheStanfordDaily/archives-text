# Green to disclose career plans soon
## He's one of two finalists for NFL job 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
After two interviews with the
Minnesota Vikings about a possible
head coaching job, Cardinal foot
ball coach Denny Green will reveal
his plans for the future sometime
today or Friday, according to Ath
letic Director Ted Leland.
"Denny and I discussed a time
line about a week and a half ago,"
Leland said yesterday in a phone
interview from Anaheim. "We
hope to have the matter cleared
up before the weekend."
Green met with Viking presi
dent and CEO Roger Headrick in
Dallas on Tuesday during the
American Football Coaches Asso
ciation convention.
A Minnesota source familiar
with the discussions told The
Daily it is 50-50 whether the
Vikings will offer the job to Green
or New York Jets defensive coor
dinator Pete Carroll, the other
finalist. The source said after
talking with Headrick seemed to
have that Green the inside track
on the position.
Leland said he is confident
that Green will make his decision
known according to their agree
ment.
"If you know Dennis Green,
you know he keeps to his time
lines," Leland said.

The timeline
was established
because "this is a
big recruiting
weekend for
Stanford." With
the football sea
son over, the Car
dinal is now con
centrating on the
future, and about

15 of the Cardinal's top recruits
are expected to be on campus Fri
day, Saturday and Sunday decid
ing their collegiate choice before
the Feb. 5 national letter of intent
deadline.
Leland admitted that though
recruiting is going well, a resigna
tion from Green could prove
detrimental to the 1996 football
class.
After the Cardinal's Aloha
Bowl loss to Georgia Tech it has
been reported that Green was
contacted by five NFL teams —
the Vikings, Chargers, Bucca
neers, Steelers and Rams. Green
canceled an interview with the
Steelers and wound up interview
ing with Minnesota twice.
If he is offered the job and
accepts it, Green would become
only the second black head coach
in the history of the National
Football League, joining current


Green
Los Angeles Raiders coach Art
Shell.
Throughout the interview pro
cess, Green has kept in close con
tact with Leland. The Athletic
Director admits he does not know

what the outcome of the situation
will be, but has high hopes that
Green will stay.
"We sincerely hope that Denny
stays," said Leland. "It has been a
tough year for Stanford and one
of the bright spots has been foot
ball and Denny Green."
The Minnesota source said
Headrick should make a decision
some time in the next week.
