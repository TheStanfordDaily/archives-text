# Cuts mean changes face Frosh English
## 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
In these difficult days of dollar
deficits, programs and people once
thought essential to Stanford's
operation are suddenly put in the
position of justifying their exis
tence. Yesterday, it was the Uni
versity's 14 Freshman English
lecturers.
The jobs of the lecturers, a
group of non-tenured teachers
who are not part of the faculty,
hung in the balance as the campus
learned of a proposed Humanities
and Sciences money-saving
scheme that would replace some
portion of lecturers with graduate
students.
The ratio of lecturers to grad
uate students teaching Freshman
English, now approximately 40-
60, would swing in the direction
of more graduate students. The
degree of this shift is still on the
drawing boards, according to Car
olyn Lougee, dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences. She

insisted last night that lecturers
would not be eliminated com
pletely.
The School of Humanities and
Sciences is being squeezed from
two sides. It must implement $5
million in budget cuts, and at the
same time find a way to spread a
shrinking pool of aid money
among its graduate students.
This fall, the responsibility for
doling out graduate student
financial aid moved from Gradu
ate Studies to Humanities and
Sciences. "The budget is not suffi
cient to continue the kind of grad
uate aid policies we now have,"
Lougee explained. "We have to
redefine the teaching expectation
that comes with fellowships."
She acknowledged that Fresh
man English has already made a
big contribution to the -school's
budget reductions. The program
implemented cuts of $75,000 —
around 8 percent of its budget —
this fall.
"As for any further changes,
we have some things on the draw
ing board but we're a long way
from any decision," Lougee said.
"The balance between lectur
ers and grad students has been
one of the strengths of the pro
gram," Lougee said. But that is
"not to say there aren't other
approaches," she added.
One proposal has freshman
writing courses being taught
through other humanities depart
ments besides English. For exam
ple, graduate students in history
or political science might teach
sections of the course. This plan
would meet the dual goal of
increasing graduate teaching and
decreasing spending.
"It's an interesting idea,"
Lougee said. She said a small pilot
program might be implemented
next year.

Lecturers displeased
The proposals have sent waves
of anger throughout the Fresh
man English lecturer community.
Ann Watters, acting director of
Freshman English, said the pro
posals were "driven by the bud
get, not by good pedagogy."
"Stanford doesn't recognize
composition or writing as a disci
pline," said Richard Holeton, a lec
turer in Freshman English for the
past five years. "The assumption
behind this is that anyone can teach
writing and that isn't the case."
"I wouldn't presume to go TA a
section in political science or clas
sics. It's not my field."
He added that graduate stu
dents would probably be reluctant
to teach since there would be neg
ligible professional benefit from
teaching in another discipline.
"You do get teaching experience,
but it doesn't help a political scien
tist to get a job by having taught
Freshman English," Holeton said.
Lougee said that since the pro
posals were still on the drawing

board, graduate students had not
yet had a chance to discuss it.
Susan Wyle, a lecturer since
1980, coordinates the Community
Service Writing Program, a three
year old program in conjunction
with the Haas Public Service Cen
ter in which students complete
some of their assignments by
writing articles for the newslet
ters of non-profit agencies such as
the Sierra Club.
She said the program, which
has been almost entirely run by
lecturers, is in danger under the
new proposal.
But Lougee maintained that
no final decisions have been
made. "This is something that
will have wide discussion," she
said. "We don't make unilateral
changes anyway."
The sting of yesterday's news
produced even more frustration over
the University's budget cuts. "At
some point the students are going to
have to ask if some things are too
important to be judged solely by dol
lars and cents," Holeton said.
