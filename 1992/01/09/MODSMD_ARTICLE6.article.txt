# Cuts mean changes face Frosh English
## 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
In these difficult days of dollar
deficits, programs and people once
thought essential to Stanford's
operation are suddenly put in the
position of justifying their exis
tence. Yesterday, it was the Uni
versity's 14 Freshman English
lecturers.
The jobs of the lecturers, a
group of non-tenured teachers
who are not part of the faculty,
hung in the balance as the campus
learned of a proposed Humanities
and Sciences money-saving
scheme that would replace some
portion of lecturers with graduate
students.
The ratio of lecturers to grad
uate students teaching Freshman
English, now approximately 40-
60, would swing in the direction
of more graduate students. The
degree of this shift is still on the
drawing boards, according to Car
olyn Lougee, dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences. She

insisted last night that lecturers
would not be eliminated com
pletely.
The School of Humanities and
Sciences is being squeezed from
two sides. It must implement $5
million in budget cuts, and at the
same time find a way to spread a
shrinking pool of aid money
among its graduate students.
This fall, the responsibility for
doling out graduate student
financial aid moved from Gradu
ate Studies to Humanities and
Sciences. "The budget is not suffi
cient to continue the kind of grad
uate aid policies we now have,"
Lougee explained. "We have to
redefine the teaching expectation
that comes with fellowships."
She acknowledged that Fresh
man English has already made a
big contribution to the -school's
budget reductions. The program
implemented cuts of $75,000 —
around 8 percent of its budget —
this fall.
