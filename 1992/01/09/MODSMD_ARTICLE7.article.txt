# 'Getting a life'
## Woman recovers quickly following surgery for cyst 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
The woman who had a 303-pound ovarian cyst
removed last October at Stanford Hospital has
recovered and is "doing well," according to oper
ating surgeon Katherine O'Hanlan.
"Her recovery was really uneventful," O'Han
lan said. "As she gets her strength back, she gets
more and more excited all the time."
The 35-year-old woman, who wishes to remain
anonymous, lay on the operating table for six
and-a-half hours while six surgeons at Stanford
Hospital removed the huge mass from her right
ovary. After the operation, the 5-foot-6-inch
woman weighed about 210 pounds, about two
fifths her previous weight.
A biopsy showed the cyst to be benign.
The patient had been bedridden for the two
years preceding the operation, and was cared for
by her relatives. Now, however, she is living at
home, undergoing physical therapy and is walk
ing again, O'Hanlan said. In addition, a biopsy

showed the patient's left ovary to
be healthy, and she can bear chil
dren. Currently, the patient is
unmarried and has no children.
O'Hanlan said the patient
would probably have to spend two
more months in physical therapy,
after which time she will be fully
functional.
"It's exciting to watch her blos
som," O'Hanlan said. "It's getting
a life, that's what she's doing."
The growth, officially called a

"benign cystic teratoma," was "mul
ticystic," or made of about 50 indi
vidual smaller cysts joined together
in one huge mass, O'Hanlan said.
During the operation, the
patient and cyst were supported
by separate tables, and after
removal the cyst was taken from
the operating room on it's own
gurney, O'Hanlan said.
Tests showed the cyst to be
made largely of fluid, although
solid tissue, including teeth and
hair, had grown in the cyst, she
said. In addition to the growth, sur
geons had to remove a 3-by-5-foot,
15-pound patch of skin, including
the patient's belly button, from the

patient's abdomen, O'Hanlan said.
O'Hanlan said she believes the
growth to be the "biggest ovarian
mass" ever documented, and plans
to contact the Guiness Book of
World Records about the cyst. Pre
viously, O'Hanlan said, the largest
ovarian cyst she had ever removed
weighed about 35 pounds.
O'Hanlan, who led the team of
gynecologic cancer surgeons in
the operation, said that while the
operation "took a long time," she
found it to be "great fun."
According to O'Hanlan, the
cyst was drained of fluid and "dis
posed of after the biopsies were
completed.
