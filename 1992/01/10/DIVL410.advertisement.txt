OUR WORKSTATIONS HBP YOU MASTER
EVERYTHING FROM MATH TO SCIENCE TO MUSK.
BUT COME FEBRUARY, OUR DISCOUNT
WILL BE HISTORY.
NeXTstatiorf computers are extremely fast and powerful workstations. But you'll
have to be fast yourself to take advantage of our special holiday savings, because they
end January 31st.
Even without savings, the price/performance of these workstations is unequaled
anywhere in the industry. They offer features like an easy-to-use graphical interface,
BMB of RAM, enormous disk storage, a standard UNIX® operating system, true multi
tasking, and a 15MIPS CPU. They also have built-in Ethernet networking, a large
monitor with true display PostScript® and a built-in DSP chip for
CD-quality sound.
They're ideally suited to every kind of academic work - from
computation-intensive math and science projects to report
writing, complicated research, in depth analysis-and yes, even
composing music.
That's partly because the best versions of many industry
leading software products are the ones written for NeXTstations.
These products include WordPerfect® Adobe Illustrator® Lotus®
Improve Soft PC? and a great many more. Mathematical the
acclaimed numeric-processing software, is even included free.
Given all this, about the only way we could improve the price/performance
of a NeXTstation is to make the price lower. Which is just what these
special savings do.
We recommend you visit your campus reseller today-before
this offer becomes ancient history.
