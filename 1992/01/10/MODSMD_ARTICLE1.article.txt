# Vikings snap up Green; acceptance expected
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
The Minnesota Vikings have officially
offered their head coaching position to
Dennis Green, who will announce today
that he is seizing this opportunity to
jump to the National Football League,
ESPN reported last night.
Cardinal players believe Green will
publicly announce his intentions at a spe
cial team meeting scheduled for 7 a.m.
today.
Though it was rumored among team
members that Green would use last
night's team banquet to make a state
ment concerning the issue, Green skirted
the topic entirely. The matter was
instead broached by Cardinal players
Dave Garnett, Steve Stenstrom, John
Lynch and J. J. Lasley, who came for
ward as team representatives.

In an emotional moment, each player
gave remarks on Green's impending deci
sion, with Lynch telling the audience that
one thing Green had taught him was to
make the most of opportunities. Lynch
said he understood the Viking job would
be a great opportunity, but said that
Green also had opportunities at Stanford.
All the players said that they hoped
Green would stay.
But after the banquet, other players,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said
they believed Green's silence on the mat
ter meant he had made the decision to
leave Stanford.
The players said that if Green was
going to stay, he would not drag the issue
out and instead would have used the ban
quet to announce he was staying.
The fact that the meeting was called
for this morning, coupled with Green's
lack of action at the banquet, convinced

many players that he
has made up his mind
and is leaving for the
NFL.
Stanford Athletic
Director Ted Leland told
The Daily Wednesday
night that Green said he
would make up his mind
before recruits arrived
on campus this weekend.

One player said he appreciates that
Green will make his first explicit state
ment of his intentions to the team.
"As a football player I would like to
hear first because we are the closest to
him," said the team member. "I wouldn't
like to hear the news like Cal had to,
through the paper. It means more to hear
(the decision) face to face."
Green has stated that his decision
rested on the amount of control the

Vikings would give him over the team.
ESPN reported that the final details of
Minnesota's offer were to be negotiated
throughout the night.
The other frontrunner for the position
had been Pete Caroll, the defensive coor
dinator for the New York Jets.
Though Pete Caroll once served as a
Viking assistant coach and was reported
in Minnesota papers to be the players
choice, Green was said to have the inside
track because of his connections within
the NFL club.
In 1980 Green served as offensive
coordinator for former Stanford coach
Paul Wiggin, who is now an assistant
coach with the Vikings. Frank Gilliam,
Minnesota's director of player personal,
also coached Green while he was a tail
back/flanker at lowa State.
Leland has said that the search for the
new head coach will start within the pro

gram, a process that will probably begin
immediately in order to regain stability
before the crucial recruiting period.
The two leading candidates are defen
sive coordinator Willie Shaw and offen
sive coordinator Ron Turner. Shaw is
credited with impressive defensive play
calling skills, but could go to Minnesota
as a member of Green's staff. Shaw came
to Stanford from the Detroit Lions,
where he served as an assistant coach for
fours years (1985-88). His resume
includes assistant coaching positions at
Arizona State, Oregon and Long Beach
State.
Turner is credited with recruiting cur
rent Stanford Ail-American Bob Whit
field, and has a long list of collegiate posi
tions. Coming to Stanford from Texas
A&M, Turner also coached at USC, the
University of Pittsburg, Northwestern
University and the University of Arizona.
