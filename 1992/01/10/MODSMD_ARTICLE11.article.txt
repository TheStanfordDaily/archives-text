## The
						diploma dilemma 
### 
The University must
now decide whether
to graduate Thomas

The criminal justice
system is closing the books on
the alleged Casa Zapata rape.
In exchange for senior Stuart
Thomas' guilty plea to two misde
meanor charges, the Santa Clara
County district attorney agreed to
drop a felony statutory rape charge.
In that plea-bargain, Thomas
admitted to having had sex with a
minor, as well as having provided
her with alcohol illegally. On the
surface these crimes seem common.
After all, for minors in this country,
having sex and drinking have
almost become a rite of passage,
and certainly things many people
would not believe to be criminal.
But despite the perceived nature
of the crimes to which Thomas
pleaded guilty, the University must
nevertheless launch a full investi
gation into the incident. Stanford
administrators will ultimately have
to decide whether Thomas, who
has likely completed his graduation
requirements, should receive a
Stanford diploma. Prior to fall
quarter, Thomas needed but four
units to be eligible for graduation.
The question that Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole will need
to answer is whether a reasonable
person would believe beyond a rea
sonable doubt that Thomas coerced
the alleged victim into having sex.
If so, Stanford should not count
Thomas among its alumni; if not,
then he should graduate.
The district attorney's decision
to accept a guilty plea to a reduced
charge should not be an indicator of
the University's determination.
The case proves far more complicat
ed than that.
The police firmly believed that
Thomas should have been charged
with forcible rape; the district
attorney, though, only pressed a
felony statutory rape charge

(along with the alcohol charge);
and then through plea-bargaining,
the charge was further reduced to
a misdemeanor charge.
The case never even went to
trial, where an impartial jury could
determine just what crime was
committed, if any.
Whether justice has been served
by the district attorney may never
be known. This does not imply
that Thomas is in fact guilty of
something more than the crimes to
which he admitted.
Nor does it mean that the Uni
versity is obliged to concur with the
district attorney's decision to accept
a misdemeanor plea-bargain.
A 17-year-old Stanford student
was traumatized enough by the
events that transpired in an on-cam
pus dormitory to endure a lengthy
and painful criminal process.
This alone merits a full-fledged
investigation by the University
into the events that transpired
Sept. 22. Only the two people
involved know what really hap
pened that night; it will be the
University's responsibility to
attempt to determine, if possible,
which story is true.
Last quarter the ASSU Senate
properly rejected the proposed
changes to the University Judicial
Charter to lower the burden of proof
from beyond a reasonable doubt to
clear and convincing evidence.
Thus it could well prove difficult
to convict Thomas even if he is
believed to be guilty. As it should be.
The University will have to use
the vaguely worded Fundamental
Standard, which reads: "Students
at Stanford are expected to show
both within and without the Uni
versity such respect for order,
morality, personal honor and the
rights of others as is demanded of
good citizens."
Should Cole find beyond a rea
sonable doubt that Thomas in fact
used alcohol with the express pur
pose of coercing the woman into
having sex with him, then Thomas
should be denied the privilege of
graduating from Stanford.
Justice would be served.
