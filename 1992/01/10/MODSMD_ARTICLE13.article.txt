## Ronald Hilton Breaking the lecture monopoly 
### 
THE CORE OF THE OXFORD edu
cational system in which I was
trained was solid reading, made
possible only because much of it was done
by prescription during summer vacation.
The tutor's job was to make sure that one
had done the reading and could write
intelligently about it. Lectures were much
less important than the reading. One
struggled privately with the printed text
of the original work, not with textbooks.
I first encountered the American sys
tem at UC-Berkeley. It had many advan
tages, but I was appalled by the stress on
classes, which seemed like a prolongation
of high school. Many famous professors
were dismal lecturers.
My academic life has been marred by a
plethora of bad lectures, a universal phe
nomenon. At the Sorbonne I sampled
numerous lectures and found they were
very poor. At a lecture on surgery in the
Faculty of Medicine, students stood in
the balcony looking down on an operation
being performed. All they could see were
the backs of their professors.
The solution to the teaching problem
has been provided by audio-visual tech
nology. The traditional lecture course is
an anachronism. Stanford Prof. David
Bassett revolutionized the teaching of
anatomy with a series of slides, but since
his time, technology has made enormous
strides. It involves much more than sim
ply making tapes of lectures. An effective,

professional video requires a team of spe
cialists of different kinds and, incidental
ly, a lot of money.
As a boy, I studied Roman history
from a dull book under a dull teacher. It
came to life later when I toured the
ancient monuments of Italy. However, it
did not achieve vitality until I saw the
series "I, Claudius," based on the work of
a distinguished classical scholar.
The TV series was gripping, but when
I tried to discuss it with a classics profes
sor, he responded with ill-concealed dis
dain. He should have welcomed the series
and the enthusiasm it aroused and pro
ceeded from there, not to traditional lec
tures but to a discussion of the classical
texts on which it was based.
My second example involves Nazi Ger
many, where I lived as a student. The series
"Biography" includes films on Hitler and
Goebbels. No book or lecture can recreate
the horrors of that period for students who
were not alive at the time. Again, this should
be followed by reading and discussion.
Finally, let me come to one of the great
intellectual experiences of my career. For
more than 20 years I have spent endless
hours each day poring over printed materi
als from the Soviet Union, trying painfully
to make sense out of the data. I realized the
need for a more careful analysis of the doc
uments available to understand the role of
the Soviet Union in the world.
The Gorbachev years are still full of

mysteries. Illumination has been provid
ed by the series "The Second Russian
Revolution," a co-production of the BBC
and The Discovery Channel. The series is
the work of an extraordinarily able team
In addition to using newsreel films, they
succeeded in getting many of the leading
figures in the Soviet government to give
their accounts of events.
Individuals who up to then had been
just names to me suddenly came to life.
Realizing that they were speaking for his
tory, they chose their words carefully. The
whole story was put together with such
skill that many things which had been
puzzling me suddenly came to light.
In response to my enthusiasm, some
Sovietologists have said airily that they
never watch TV; they prefer to read. I
read too, but I prefer these films to their
lectures. This is the way teaching is going.
The change does not affect small class
es devoted to training and discussion.
Traditional lectures should be reserved
for those few and constantly fewer fields
in which films are unavailable. This
would include advances in courses on the
cutting edge of knowledge.
Stanford's undertakings in the new
teaching technology deserve every encour
agement.
