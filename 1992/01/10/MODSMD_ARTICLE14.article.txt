Graduate senator rebuts reader's definition of rape

IAM WRITING IN RESPONSE TO
Mark Clayton's viewpoint, which
appeared on Jan. 6 in The Daily.
Clayton stated that if a woman says
she is raped, then she is raped, since she
is the only person who can know if she
gave her consent. I will assume that
Clayton is not sexist and he would con
cede that, although unlikely, it is possi
ble that a woman can rape a man, per
haps, for example, by coercion through
the use of alcohol.
With these facts in mind, consider a
situation that might occur using Clay
ton's interpretation of the Honor Code.
Jane has an appointment with the
Judicial Affairs officer. She states that
John used alcohol to coerce her into hav
ing sex with him at a party on Friday
night. She wishes to file a complaint.

A creative solution to
Stanford's budget woes:
pocket change donations
Ever since the news of the budget cri
sis at Stanford, various schools, depart
ments and programs have been scram
bling to press and preserve their special
interests. The situation is divisive and
depressing. In an effort to do something
constructive and celebratory and to build
community, I offer two suggestions.
The first is that every week, every
person — student, faculty and staff —
contribute one dollar (those who make
more should contribute more, and
besides it would be tax deductible) into a
"communal pot." This could be strategi
cally placed, for example, at the center of
the Quad, so that visitors could also con
tribute. This would amount to at least
$26,000 per week or $100,000 per
month (plus interest).
The second idea is similar but much
riskier; let each student, faculty and staff

The Judicial Affairs officer says that an
investigation will be initiated. The Judi
cial Affairs officer now only needs to get
John in the office and have him admit
that he had sex with Jane, and it's an
open-and-shut case since she said she
was raped.
The next day the officer contacts the
secretary and asks that John be contact
ed for an interview concerning this mat
ter. Coincidentally, the secretary
informs the officer that John is already
in the lobby and has an appointment to
see the officer. John relates a story in
which he claims that Jane used alcohol
to coerce him into having sex with her at
a party on Friday night. He wishes to
file a complaint.
The officer now has a real dilemma.
Using the Clayton interpretation of the

buy a $1 lottery ticket and before the
results are announced, donate it to the
same fund. The risk is greater, but so too
is the potential return. Since a percent
age of the lottery benefits California edu
cation, we would still be contributing to
something we all value highly.
Clearly these measures will not
resolve the crisis, but they would help to
mitigate it. More importantly, they
would provide us with an opportunity to
develop community spirit, to demon
strate our concern for the University
and to feel that we are doing something
positive to help.

Undergraduates must be
better informed if they
wish to pursue research
In the past year there has been much
discussion about how to bring under
graduate education and university

Honor Code both individuals are telling
the truth. The officer concludes that
both parties must have initially intended
to coerce the other but changed their
minds the instant before they became
intoxicated enough to prevent rational
decision-making. Both are guilty, and
both are expelled from Stanford.
Justice has been served.
Although it is clear in the above situa
tion that one party must be lying, Clay
ton says that these situations will be few
and far between if men (and I assume he
means women as well) behave honorably
and do not have sex with individuals
they do not know well.
This amounts to making it an Honor
Code violation to have sex with someone
you do not know well enough to know
that he or she would not lie. While I per-

research closer together. The key to this
unification is making undergraduates
aware of the research resources available
to them. The most important of these
are the specialty libraries containing
field literature.
It is a given that the undergraduates
who wish to pursue a research program
are willing to place themselves in a posi
tion of direction with the assistance of
faculty and staff rather than relying on a
faculty or staff member to direct their
involvement.
The primary step in pursuing such
a program is becoming familiar with
the literature in one's field. It is
important that undergraduates first
become familiar with their field jour
nals and make certain to keep up to
date with new contributions in their
field.
In doing this, they can have a better
level of communication with faculty,
staff and graduate students with whom
they are working.

sonally feel that this is indeed the honor
able thing to do, I do not believe that
violating this principle is grounds for
expulsion from a university.
So to Jane or John, whichever is
telling the truth, Clayton would merely
state that expulsion was his or her own
fault for not behaving honorably and for
having sex with someone he or she did
not know. I do not wish to attend a uni
versity that holds this policy.
That is why, as an ASSU senator, I
voted against the Committee of Fifteen's
recommended changes to the Judicial
Charter and will continue to oppose any
changes that resemble Clayton's inter
pretation.

Congratulations to the
University for naming
Edmonds vice president
I would like to be among the first to
congratulate the University — and
Provost James Rosse — for selecting a
person of color to be the new vice presi
dent for student resources.
Mary Edmonds' appointment makes
her the first person of color to hold a full
vice presidential position in Stanford's
100-plus-year history.
This vice presidential area is now
more culturally diverse in its manage
ment than any other executive office of
the University, whether administrative
or academic. You need only look at the
Faculty Senate and its Advisory Board.
The achievement of cultural diversity
in management must not fall on one or
two offices of an institution that is pur
suing decentralization.
