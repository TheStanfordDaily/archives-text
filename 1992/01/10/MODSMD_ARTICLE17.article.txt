## Card beats Beavs at buzzer, 67-64 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Stanford has comfortably
won eight games this year with
intelligent, controlled play, but
last night at Oregon State they
won their ninth with raw guts.
With the Beavers leading 64-
63 with 29 seconds to play,
guard Peter Dukes confidently
hammered home a 23-foot
three-pointer from the right
wing to cap a courageous Stan
ford comeback.
"I knew they were going to
be denying the ball to Keefe
inside," Dukes said. "OSU gave
me a couple of feet to work
with, I shot it and I was fortu
nate it went in."
Adam Keefe added a free
throw with two seconds left,
giving Stanford a 67-64 victory
and a momentum-building 1-0
start in Pacific 10 Conference
p!ay
"This is really a big win for
us," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery. "We were a little
tense, but Dukes hung in there
and shot the ball real well."
After being bottled up early
by the Beaver zone, Keefe
exploded for a game-high 27
points (10 of 13 from the field,
7 of 8 from the line) and 8
rebounds.
The Beavers led 57-51 with
seven minutes left, but Stan
ford put on a determined 7-0
kick in the end to win a seesaw
Pac-10 opener before 9,433
fans at Gill Coliseum.
Stanford, which lost its
league opener last year at Cor
vallis 73-66, improved to 9-1
overall, while the gritty
Beavers are 8-6. It was only

Oregon State's fourth loss at
home in the past three seasons.
Oregon State played without
leading scorer Chad Scott, who
was declared academically inel
igible for the season 30 minutes
before the game.
The Beavers led 57-51 with
seven minutes left, but a three
point play the old fashioned
way from Keefe launched Stan
ford on a 7-0 run.
With the Beavers laying
back in their zone, Williams
scored on a backdoor alley-oop
dunk to give Stanford a 58-57
lead. Scott Haskin put the
Beavers back on top with a
three point play of his own and
two free throws, as OSU led 64-
61.
A Keefe score over a triple
team and a steal with 49 sec
onds left set the stage for
Dukes' fantastic finish.
The Beavers had a chance to
tie, but spindly freshman Brent
Barry, starting his fust colle
giate game, lost the ball in traf
fic as he tried to pass off in the
lane with 10 seconds left.
Barry, son of Golden State
Warrior great Rick Barry, fin
ished with five points.
Keefe wound up with the
ball and was fouled, sinking
one free throw to ice the game.
Oregon State stifled Stan
ford in the opening eight min
utes by rotating between man
to-man and quick-shifting
match-up zone defenses. The
Beavers led 19-14, limiting
Keefe to four points and Dukes
to three.
Haskin (21 points, 8
rebounds) scored eight points
rebounds) scored eight points in
the opening 10 minutes, but
when the 6-foot-10 center picked
up his third personal foul 14 min
utes into the game, Keefe took
charge inside.
! An offensive foul induced by
sparkplug freshman David Har
bour and a 40-foot alley-oop-and
jam pass from Dukes to Brent
Williams (12 points) started
Stanford on a 14-6 run and a 38-
33 halftime lead.
Each of Dukes' three treys
came at crucial moments. His
first tied the game 19-19 after
the Beavers had led from the tip
off, his second locked it at 51-51
and his third won the game. He
finished with 11 points and five
assists.
With Stanford visiting injury
decimated Oregon Saturday and
hosting young California
Wednesday, the Cardinal has an
opportunity to gain both victo
ries and confidence before facing
conference heavyweights UCLA
and Arizona.
