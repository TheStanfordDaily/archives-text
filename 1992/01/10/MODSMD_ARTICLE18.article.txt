# Women to beat Cal in Bear country
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
At 7:30 p.m. tonight, Stan
ford's women's basketball team
will begin a long and treacherous
journey through the Pacific 10
Conference as it takes on Califor
nia in Harmon Gym.
The Pac-10 may well be the
fastest improving conference in
the country, and none of the
games will be cakewalks. The Pac
-10 has accrued a collection of
coaches rivalled in prestige only
by the powerful Southeastern
Conference.
This week, fully nine of the
teams received votes in the Asso
ciated Press poll, with two ranked
in the top 25 — Stanford (No. 2)
and Washington (No. 13). Califor
nia received three votes, good for
a No. 45 ranking.
The Golden Bears definitely
have upset potential. Picked to
finish eighth in the conference in
the preseason coaches' poll, the
Bears picked up two unexpected
recruits at the beginning of this
season and will probably exceed
their previous expectations.
The biggest surprise was the
addition of point guard Vukadi
novic, who happens to be the
starting point for the Yugoslavian
National Team.
"She is totally the key to their
team," Stanford coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "She handles the
ball very, very well.
Vukadinovic presents major
match-up problems at 6-foot-l,
especially against the 5-6 Molly
Goodenbour, Stanford's "1."
Although Goodenbour's quick
ness may offset the size differ
ence, VanDerveer is prepared
to adjust her defense if neces
sary.
The Bears create other match
up difficulties with a quick three
guard lineup. Any of the three can
play point, and they have bal
anced scoring with a driving

guard in Monica Wiley (last year's
starter at "1") and a three-point
shooter in Jennifer Self, another
returning starter.
The Bears' quick perimeter is
complemented by two physical
posts. Senior forward Trisha
Stafford is their big gun, averag

ing 20 points and nine rebounds
per game. Senior center Kesha
Martin is aggressive on the offen
sive boards.
Like Stanford, California likes
to run, and — assuming the
match-ups are worked out —
that should work to the more tal

ented Cardinal's favor.
Card notes
KZSU will continue its season
long coverage of the Cardinal with the
soothing voices of Jamie Zaninovich
and Rob Johnstone gracing the air
waves.
