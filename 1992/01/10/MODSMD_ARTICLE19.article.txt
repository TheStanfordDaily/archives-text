# O'Brien leads foursome in Palm Springs season opener

### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
In the past, the Cardinal men's tennis coach,
Dick Gould, has downplayed the importance of the
National Collegiate Tennis Tournament, a tourna
ment that pits four players from each of the top
eight teams in the country against one another. And
once again, he is keeping to form as he and four of
his top players from his No. 3 Cardinal squad gear
up for the three-day extravaganza beginning today
at the Radison Hotel in Palm Springs.
"If I had to rank this tournament on a scale of
one to ten in terms of importance to me, I would
give it a one," Gould said.
"This tournament has been going on for about
20 years and at first I never even went down there
because I thought it was a farce to send guys down
after a month of not really practicing. But the guys

like the tournament, and in the past few years I've
been looking at it as a kind of kickoff for the rest of
the season," Gould added.
Alex O'Brien, the Cardinal's No. 1 player and
the top-ranked player in the nation, leads the Car
dinal foursome of Chris Cocotos, Robert Devins
and Jason Yee down South in the singles competi
tion, while O'Brien and Cocotos will also team up
for doubles, as will Devins and Yee. However, the
Cardinal will be without Mike Flanagan, ranked
No. 12 in the country, who returned from winter
break with tendinitis of the wrist.
"We are not ready to peak or prime in this tour
nament," Gould said. "We just want to get a feel for
the competition after having not really practiced
since Thanksgiving."
Next week the Cardinal heads up to Seattle,
Wash, for the Pacific 10 Conference Indoor Cham
pionships.
