# Hashing, staff cuts on Food Service menu
## 
### Adam Stein Staff writer 
Lagunita Court food service will be
closed on weekends and Row house
residents will have to hash for free if
the University implements recom
mendations in a report released yes
terday by Housing and Food Service.
The report also proposed other food
service cutbacks, including staff
reductions, the discontinuation of Fri
day food service in Branner Hall and a
slight decrease in the amount of
money spent on food.
At a budget forum held last night,
several students expressed anger over
the proposals. "It will be a incon
venience for the Lag residents who have
to travel to Flo Mo or Ricker for their
weekend meals," said one student.
However, according to Housing
Management Director Keith Guy, the
closure of Lagunita would pose only a
minor nuisance.
"Because of the lower participation
on weekends, existing facilities in
other dorms will be adequate, provided
their hours are extended," Guy said.
According to Assoc. Director of Res
idential Education Diana Conklin, the
proposal to provide each Row House
with a cook supported by voluntary
student labor is a compromise be
tween student desires and budget
necessities.
"It would be cheaper to get rid of
the cooks altogether [and bring in food
from other dorms], but the cooks were
retained in response to students'
wishes," Conklin said.
Graduate student John Overdeck, a

member of the Council of Presidents,
strongly disagreed with the proposal.
"I'm amazed that they're expecting
Row House residents to pay full board
and do their own hashing. The propos
al only saves $100,000, and its going to
destroy those six houses," he said.
He also objected to the unan
nounced release of the report. Last
night's town meeting was originally
scheduled to be a forum for discussion
of cuts to the Office of Student
Resources, but the new proposals were
unexpectedly added to the agenda.
"Housing and Food Services didn't
think that they needed student input.
. .. Their lack of concern is reflected
by the fact that they released the
report just three hours before the
meeting," Overdeck said.
But according to Guy, "Not every
thing is cast in stone.We're talking to
faculty and staff to see if this is an
attractive option. I can see from the
reaction tonight that people are
uncertain."
The report also recommended
changes, mostly reductions in custodi
al and maintenance services, that
would cut a combined $1,692,000
from housing operations and housing
maintenance.
Jan. 17 is the deadline for all bud
get proposals to be turned in to the
Cabinet Committee on Budget and
Strategic Planning.
Housing and Food Services officials
have been asked to cut 15 percent from
their budget as part of a University
wide attempt to end Stanford's $40-
million operating budget shortfall.
Although Housing and Food Ser

vices is not included in the operating
budget, University officials plan to
decrease student room-and-board
charges by cutting expenses in Hous
ing and Food Services, and increase
tuition charges by the same amount.
Tuition revenue flows into the operat
ing budget.
During last night's forum, many stu
dents also voiced their support for the
Undergraduate Advising Center, which
is facing large staff reductions that
would restrict the advising center's ser
vices to juniors and seniors only.
In particular, premedical and

transfer students praised the enthusi
asm and usefulness of the advising
center staff.
"If the UAC hadn't been there, I
would have felt left out in the cold. As
far as I'm concerned, advising is one of
the most valuable services," said one
transfer student.
"It would be very difficult for stu
dents to plan their premedical tracks
without contact with premedical
advising before their junior year," said
another student.

Junior Mary Lemke voices her opinions at the budget forum held last night.
A University report released by Housing and Food Service drew fire from
many students.
Several students expressed dis
satisfaction with their freshman
advisors and said the advising cen

ter provided necessary guidance.
"My adviser was a wonderful
woman, but she didn't know the
first thing about academics here.
She wasn't a member of the facul
ty," said one student. "I needed
the personal, one-on-one atten
tion I received from the UAC."
