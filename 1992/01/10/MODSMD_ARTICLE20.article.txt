# Spikers should shine tonight, tame Tigers

Although they haven't even
played their first official match,
the men's volleyball team already
garners some impressive accom
plishments. Three team members
top Stanford's all-time records
lists. Two played for the U.S.
National team at the Pan Am
Games last summer. And, in the
season's first poll, Volleyball
Monthly ranks Stanford third in
the nation.
When they open their season
tonight at Pacific, the squad has a
chance to demonstrate the
dynamics behind their statistics.
With five returning starters, as
well as others who have seen
extensive playing time, the Cardi
nal lineup is impressive and expe
rienced.
"Experience will be one of our
strengths. Last year, we were rel
atively inexperienced," comment
ed Coach Ruben Nieves on last
season's 5-11 finish. "We're hop
ing it will make the difference in
close matches and pressure situa
tions," Nieves said. Stanford has
the personnel to make a big dif
ference.
Senior Duncan Blackman, a
four-year starter, leads the team
in several aspects, including expe
rience. Blackman, a 6-foot-5 out
side hitter, was second on the
team last year in both kills and
hitting percentage. His play
earned him second team All West
ern Intercollegiate Volleyball

Association) honors.
Another outside hitter, Bob
Hillman, plays a key role for the
Cardinal. "Hillman is our best
and most consistent player, game
to game and match to match,"
Nieves said. Hillman played in all
of last seasons matches, and led
the team with 138 digs.
Assisting Blackman and Hill
man is sophomore Canyon
Ceman. With one season under
his belt, Ceman is considered one
of the top setters in the country.
Ceman led the United States B
Team this summer to a silver
medal at the World University
Games. As a freshman, Ceman
set a single-match record for
assists at 106.
The whole roster has compara
ble statistics. "This is not going to
be a team with one or two all
stars and a supporting cast,"
Nieves said. "It's a very balanced
squad."
You don't have to take his
word for it; last weekend's infor
mal tournament at Santa Cruz is
evidence enough. Stanford
entered two balanced teams in
the competition, and came home
with both first and second place
honors. Stanford was the only
varsity team at the tournament;
other schools were represented
by club teams. Most schools in
the region only have club pro
grams. Although the competition
last weekend was not as strong as
that found in the NCAA, Nieves
was satisfied with his squad's
performance.
Southern California is the
breeding ground for strong varsi
ty programs. With the exception
of Stanford, the top-ranked
teams, including No. 1 Long
Beach State and No. 2 UCLA,
come from the Southwest.
Stanford steps on the court
tonight at 7:30 in Stockton.
Although Pacific is a club team,
they have made a commitment to
compete at the varsity level start
ing next year. On Saturday,
Stanford travels to Sacramento
State for a 6 p.m. match. Two
time defending national club
champion California comes to
Burnham Pavilion on Tuesday,
Jan. 21 for Stanford's first home
match.
