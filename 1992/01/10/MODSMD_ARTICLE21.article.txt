# Chiminello advances to semis
## Women netters playing well in Milwaukee tourney 
### Gretchen Atwood Editorial staff 
Amy Chiminello is not one of the top seeds at
the Milwaukee Tennis Classic, but maybe she
should be.
The Stanford freshman survived a close fourth
round match with Texas' Carla Cossa and breezed
through her next contest to earn a berth in the
semifinals. Chiminello edged the fourth-seeded
Longhorn 6-3, 3-6, 7-5.
"I just played really tough, went for some shots
and made them," Chiminello said, describing how
she saved six match points at 4-5 in the third set.
"She also missed some shots. After I made those
points I knew I'd win. She got down on herself
after that."
Despite the upset, Chiminello's biggest chal
lenge may come today. She faces California's Lisa

Albano, the No. 1 seed and a finalist in the 1991
NCAA Championships.
"She's really fast. I can't let her control me. If
we get into long points she'll just run everything
down," Chiminello said. "I've got to attack and
take advantage of every short ball."
Chiminello wasn't the only Cardinal to see
action in the last two days. Third-seeded Kylie
Johnson beat San Diego State's Nicole Storto in the
fourth round but lost in the quarterfinals to the No.
6 seed, Indiana's Stephanie Reece. The Hoosier
senior won the match in straight sets 6-4, 7-5.
Mario Carruth strung four victories in a row in
the consolation bracket to reach today's final. Car
ruth teamed up with Chiminello for the doubles
competition.
The tandem was knocked out of the tourna
ment by top-seeded Susan Hawke and Nicole Stor
to from San Diego State 6-3, 6-1.
