# No. 1 Cardinal takes on Trojans, Bruins
## 
### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
The undefeated, No.l Cardinal
women's swimming team tackles
two of its fiercest rivals this week
end as the swimmers journey
south to take on perennial
national powers UCLA and USC.
The team is finishing a stretch
of over six weeks, in which it has
not competed. After scoring deci
sive victories over then-No. 1
Texas and UC-Santa Barbara, the
swimmers went on to excel at the
Texas Invitational in Austin. In
this meet, Stanford once again
outshone the Longhorns, a team
believed to be the Cardinal's
toughest competition for the
national title when NCAAs roll
around in March.
Since then, the Stanford swim
mers have spent their time
preparing for the upcoming dual
meets and the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships, to be held
on Feb. 7, 8, and 9.
Coach Richard Quick believes
that this weekend's meets will
serve as excellent indicators of
where the heralded swim team
stands.
"We have had a very good fall
quarter of training and prepara
tion," he said. "We have a very
good team. The next two or three
months will determine how good.
USC and UCLA are the first steps
in this process."
The team took advantage of
the winter break to heighten
their training intensity. "We

'Because there
were no classes
and fewer applica
ble NCAA restric
tions, we were
able to practice
harder over the
vacation.'

trained at a high level over the
break," Quick said. "Because
there were no classes and fewer
applicable NCAA restrictions, we
were able to practice harder over
the vacation."
The team remained at school
until Dec. 20, then returned on
the 27th to resume their prepara
tion for the assault on the nation
al title.
The No. 10 Trojans should
prove no contest for the Cardinal.
However, they do boast several
individual athletes who will give
the Cardinal a race.
Junior breastsroker Tara
Schreiner, who swam on the
United States team at the World
University Games last year, will
be USC's greatest hope for a race
victory. Also expected to swim
well against the Cardinal are
junior Sheri White in the back
stroke and freshman Elizabeth
Rarnhardt in the butterfly.

should fuel them to plenty of wins.
