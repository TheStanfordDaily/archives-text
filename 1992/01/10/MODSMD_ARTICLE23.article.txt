## 
### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
They're young, they're hun
gry, and they're looking to start
1992 on a positive note.
The Stanford Cardinal
women's gymnastics team will
begin its campaign Saturday
evening in Southern California
with a dual meet against the Cal
State Fullerton Titans, a chal
lenging opener which third-year
head coach Breck Greenwood
feels will give him "an idea of
what this team is like."
That Greenwood would have
no clear indication at this point
as to exactly how good his squad
is may be attributed to the pres
ence of four freshmen with no
collegiate competition under

their belts. Adding a bit more
experience to the team, four
sophomores and a junior — who
have competed previously but
have been plagued by nagging
injuries in the ofT-season — are
returning.
In fact, the Card — which is
ranked 18th in the NCAA pre
season poll — will be represent
ed in the all-around by two of
last year's recruits, Jene Elzie
from El Cerrito, Calif., and
Katie Clancy from Phoenix,
Ariz. Sophomore Laurie West
will also compete in the all
around against the No. 20-
ranked Titans.
Notably not at midseason
form this weekend will be two of
the stars of Stanford's 1991
team. Sophomore Kerrie Kelley

is recovering from strep throat
and a case of the flu, while sopho
more Kerri Kanuka had ankle
surgery last fall. Both will partic
ipate Saturday, but neither fig
ures to equal or better the school
recofds they set last year.
"We realize that we're not at
full strength, and we want to do
as well as we can, but we're real
ly training through this meet,"
Greenwood said. Until the
Card's conference schedule
begins on Jan. 31, this figures to
be his strategy.
"Our goal is to crack the top
12 nationally and make the
NCAA meet [in Aprill, but we're
in the toughest conference in
the nation. Six of our Pac-10
opponents finished in the top 15
last year," Greenwood said.
