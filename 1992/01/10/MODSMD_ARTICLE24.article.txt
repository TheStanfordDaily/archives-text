# Wrestlers have high hopes for UC-Davis' Aggie Open

The Stanford wrestling team will begin
the winter quarter in full swing by travel
ing north to UC-Davis to take part in the
Aggie Open. The tournament will feature
several teams and should give the Cardinal
some valuable competition. Even though
Stanford has won the Aggie Open three out
of the last four years, coach Chris Horpel
does not see it to be a victory taken for
granted anymore.
"This is an open tournament, which
means everyone can compete, including
redshirts, coaches and other older
wrestlers," Horpel said. "The addition of
this competition makes it difficult. I don't
know quite what to expect."
But the grapplers should not be counted
out for lack of practice. Over winter break,
nearly all of the team's wrestlers were pro
vided opportunities to wrestle in tourna
ments or opens, and some exciting results
were gained.
In the very competitive Las Vegas Invi
tational, generally looked at to be a verita

ble precursor of the NCAA tournament
itself, senior Matt Topham (167 pounds),
senior Mark Graham (190) and sophomore
Lance Johnson (142) competed at an
"NCAA qualifying level," according to Hor
pel. All three came close to placing, with
Graham coming the closest by beating
some great wrestlers to finish in the top 12.
In the Oregon Classic, sophomore Jay
Jackson (134) finished third, and Johnson
and Topham each repeated excellent per
formances by finishing second in their
respective weight classes. In fact, Johnson
was ahead in the championship bout when
he lost by injury default because he dislo
cated his shoulder. Johnson hopes to be
back in time for Stanford's next dual meet
on Jan. 18.
Promising for the future, lightweight
redshirt freshman Jimmy Aquirre took a
third place finish in the Fullerton Open. In
the Sunshine Open in Florida, Dave Now
ick and Dave Sacks finished just shy of plac
ing. Assistant coach Dave Let; even got in
on the vacation's tournament action when
he won his weight class in the Midlands
Open.
