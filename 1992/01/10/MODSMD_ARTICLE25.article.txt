# Men's journey to top begins this weekend

The Stanford men's gymnas
tics team is a group that won't
settle for second-best, or in their
case, fifth-best.
The squad was the No. 5 team
in the country in the final NCAA
standings last year but came
away a little disappointed with
their finish.
"Our goals were unfulfilled last
year because we wanted to win it
all," said senior co-captain Steve
Hutchins. "This year we not only
have a lot of talent but desire too.
We want to win Nationals."
The team takes its first step
toward that goal this weekend
when they travel to San Jose
State for the Spartan Invitational
Meet for their first competition of
the season. The competition,
which begins tonight and runs

through tomorrow afternoon,
will include several other Califor
nia collegiate teams as well as
some top individual performers.
"This is a pretty intense year
for college gymnastics because
everyone is preparing for Olympic
tryouts," Hutchins said.
Stanford gymnasts are looking
at this meet as an opportunity to
preview the season ahead and
make their first impressions on
the coaches, Hutchins said.
"It's a pretty high pressure
meet because of the competition
within our own team," Hutchins
said. "Eveiyone competes, so in
that respect it's a chance for
everyone to put points on the
board and see how they're doing."
The Stanford team is led by
junior Jair Lynch and senior Tim
Ryan, and has several gymnasts
who will compete for spots on the
Summer Olympic team.
