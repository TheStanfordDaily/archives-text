# Fencers to foil their foes at Roble tonight

### Brian Egan Staff writer 
The Stanford men's and women's
fencing squads open their 1991-92 sea
sons this weekend, hosting a seven-team
tournament at Roble Gym. Both Stan
ford teams are favorites in the event, a
two-day invitational featuring squads
from Cal State-Long Beach, Cal State-
Fullerton, UC-Santa Cruz, UC-San
Diego, California and MIT. The Cardinal
begins action tonight by facing MIT at
5:30 p.m, with the remainder of the tour
nament taking place Saturday at 8 a.m.
According to team manager Anthony
Jones, the real strength of the Stanford
men's team this year lies in its returning
upperchssmen. "We have lots of new
faces," Jones said, "but we are a more
experienced team than last year."
The men's squad will be greatly bol
stered by the return of senior Nick
Bravin to the foil position. Bravin, NCAA

champ at foil two years ago, has been
competing independently in national cir
cuit events for the past few months in the
hopes of qualifying for the Olympic team.
Bravin will be joined at foil by promising
freshman Jeff Donaker. The sabre team
is also in capable hands, headed by senior
captain Leonard D'Amico.
If experience will carry the Cardinal
men's fencers, then new blood will be the
key to the success of the women's team.
Only junior captain Lana Kang and
sophomore Tea Wojtkowski return from
last year's club, and three freshmen will
see action tonight and tomorrow.
After this weekend, the fencers travel
to State College, Pa., on Jan. 24 to com
pete in the Penn State Invitational. The
meet should be a good test for Stanford;
the Nittany Lions were last season's team
overall NCAA champs. However, Stanford
should be competitive in the event. "We're
working pretty hard," Jones said. "I think
that we can do well in both meets."
