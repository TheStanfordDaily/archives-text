# Sea gulls explode
## 
### 
Dear Bug Me,
My brother swears that if you
feed Alka Seltzer to a sea gull, its
stomach explodes. He says it's
because a sea gull can't burp. Of
course, my brother hasn't actually
done this, so I kind of have my
doubts. Is this even possible?
Concernedly,
Jonathan Livingston
Dear Jonathan,
Hmm. Thoughts of exploding
sea gulls worry me. I don't see
how I could watch out for broken
glass and jellyfish on the ground
while simultaneously dodging sea
gull debris from above. Exploding
sea gulls would definitely destroy
the atmosphere at any shore
resort.
However, being skeptical, I
decided to do some investigation.
Yes, I must admit, I did think
about experimenting with a sea
gull and a few teaspoons of Alka
Seltzer. But since I like to avoid
bloody messes, I instead called
the Audubon Society of Santa
Clara Valley. The woman who
answered the phone had never
heard of exploding sea gulls, but
she had read a story that was sur
prisingly similar in that day's San
Francisco Chronicle.
Sure enough, there was an arti
cle about a man who claims he
took baking soda as an antacid.
So what? Well, the baking soda
caused an explosion in his stom
ach that nearly killed him. You
might think this guy is just some
kook who heard the sea gull story
and is out to make a quick buck
off Arm & Hammer. But the man
with the incredible exploding
stomach is William Graves, the
editor of National Geographic!
And if the editor of National Geo
graphic says that common
antacids can blow up your insides,
I say this whole sea gull question
deserves some serious research.
Picking up a box of Alka
Seltzer and a box of baking soda, I
noted that they both contain sodi
um bicarbonate. So hoping to kill
two birds with one stone, I called
the handy 800 number for Arm &
Hammer.
Of course, the consumer rela
tions lady at Arm & Hammer
couldn't comment on the case, but
when I asked her about sea gulls,
she was absolutely positive that
Alka Seltzer caused sea gulls'
stomachs to explode. With the
authority of John James
Audubon, she pronounced that
this happens because sea gulls
cannot throw up. But when 1
asked her how she knew this
amazing fact, she replied that it
was just something she had
learned along the way.

With this new discovery, I
eagerly telephoned Miles Inc., the
maker of Alka Seltzer. Eventually
I got through to Greg Decker, who
put my question to the regulatory
staff. While most of them had
heard the story about sea gulls
and Alka Seltzer, none of them
could say with any authority why
or even if it happens. Possibly
their gastrointestinal systems
aren't set up to release that kind
of gas?
Apparently, the testing at the
Alka Seltzer company is exten
sive, but not that extensive.
Watch for a future lawsuit:
"Exploded Sea gull vs. Alka
Seltzer."
I decided it was time to go to
the sea gull experts themselves.
Jan Dierks of the San Francisco
Bay Bird Observatory has actual
ly studied what sea gulls eat, and
her only pronouncement on Alka
Seltzer was, "It can't be good for
them."
Wildlife Rescue Inc. represen
tative Ginny Becchine was at least
able to tell me that sea gulls are
quite capable of throwing up, so
there went that theory, although
she had never actually seen a bird
burp. But she figured that if gas
built up in a gull's stomach it
would come out one end or the
other. While she and the staff at
Wildlife Rescue considered feed
ing Alka Seltzer to sea gulls a
pretty reprehensible thing to do,
they guessed that the story about
exploding sea gulls was just "an
old wives' tale."
Unfortunately, my efforts to
reach Graves, the National Geo
graphic editor with the volatile
stomach, were unsuccessful.
Having called all these people
and still unable to document a sin
gle case of exploded sea gull stom
ach, I say this is just some urban
legend. As for Graves, maybe he
should have used Alka Seltzer.
And as for your brother, tell him
he's got egg on his face.
