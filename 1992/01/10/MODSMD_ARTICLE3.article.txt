# Faculty pans plan to make grads teach

### Steve McCarroll Howard Libit Senior staff writers 
In a contentious Faculty Senate meeting yes
terday, many professors criticized a Humanities
and Sciences budget proposal to use more grad
uate students as teachers in the Freshman
English Program.
"This is a very bad idea," said English Prof.
Nancy Packer. "It is wrong to think that we can
expect to staff the program with reluctant and
coerced graduate students and maintain the
quality of the program."
Several faculty members said they agreed
with Packer's criticism. English Prof. Ronald
Rebholz said too many teaching demands are
already imposed upon graduate students in
English, slowing their own academic progress.
Using more graduate students to teach Fresh
man English would cause "a disastrous dimin
ishing of the quality in both graduate and under
graduate education at Stanford," Rebholz said.
The proposal has gained serious considera
tion not only because it saves money on teach
ing salaries, but because it aLo provides much
needed funding to graduate students.
The Senate Committee on Education and
Scholarship at Stanford, the faculty committee
representing faculty opinion in the University's
budget crisis, included the Freshman English
proposal among further recommendations it
presented to the senate at yesterday's meeting.
It also recommended that graduate students
in departments other than English be used to
help freshmen fulfill the writing requirement,
perhaps as part of modified Cultures, Ideas and
Values tracks.
In addition, the faculty committee recom-
mended that the University con
sider bolder budget proposals that
would restructure programs with
in and across schools and units. Its
statement was not specific as to
what such changes might entail.
But Chemistry Prof. Richard
Zare, chair of the committee, said
last night that the University
should consider everything from
consolidating vice presidential
areas such as legal affairs and
public affairs to combining
departments in different schools.
"I think everybody is trying to
make budget cuts to minimize pain
in their particular areas without
trying to restructure the Universi
ty in a more positive way," he said.
For instance, Zare said that
consolidating the chemistry and
chemical engineering depart
ments, which are in different
schools, could "create a very
dynamic tension which is very
valuable" and simultaneously
save on administrative costs.
"I think we're missing an oppor
tunity to really grow as an institu
tion from this process," he said.
In other senate business, Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy spoke publicly for the
first time on the Defense Con
tract Audit Agency study —
leaked to the press last week —
claiming that Stanford over
charged the government by $230

million in indirect costs between
fiscal years 1981 and 1988.
Emphasizing that the results
are "only advisory" and that
Stanford has not yet had its
opportunity to submit a reply to
the Office of Naval Research,
Kennedy said the audit agency's
estimate puts Stanford's indirect
cost recovery rate at approximate
ly 37 percent for the period in
question — about 30 points below
the average of the 10 comparable
leading research institutions.
Last week's revelations will not
affect the budget process, Kennedy
said, because the DCAA study
results were "not unexpected" and
the University does not believe it
overcharged the government.
"I feel confident that the
Armed Services Board of Contract
Appeals will rule the memoranda
of understanding to be contracts
for fiscal year 1991," Kennedy
said, referring to the University's
appeal of the Navy's abrupt reduc
tion of its indirect-cost recovery
rate to 55.5 percent last April.
The validity of the MOUs,
which are the contracts that
establish reimbursement prac
tices, is the most important issue
to be addressed. The DCAA found
that the alleged indirect-cost
overcharge was $230 million
because the study assumed that
the more than 100 MOUs from
the 1980s were invalid.
Upon questioning from a facul
ty member, Kennedy said it was
"impossible to tell the legal costs"
from the indirect-cost battle.
