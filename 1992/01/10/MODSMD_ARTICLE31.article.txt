# Having your wisdom teeth pulled? Well, it could be worse...
## 
### Ken Wharton Staff writer 
Over break my parents lovingly gave
me my most costly Christmas present
ever, which would have been great if it
didn't involve slicing open my gums and
forcibly removing my wisdom teeth.
But it had to be done sometime. I knew
this because the doctor had shown me
this picture that he claimed was an x-ray
of my head, but looked more like a con
glomeration of the Bubble Yum that has
been slowly digesting in my stomach since
junior high.
Anyway, he explained to me that
unless removed, my wisdom teeth would
probably wiggle past my jawbone and

become lodged in my hrain, which could
seriously impair my ability to pay large
dental bills.
So, one general anesthetic and several
gallons of blood later, I awoke with a
mouthful of gauze and a lower lip approx
imately the size of Fargo, North Dakota.
Of course, the whole thing probably
wasn't necessary in the first place. My
theory is that some doctors just have an
irresistible urge to cut people open, and so
they resort to removing random objects
from perfectly healthy people.
I can see them now, poring over my
medical records with trembling fingers,
saying, "LOOK! This one's 21, and he's
NEVER HAD SURGERY!! Hmm, too old
for tonsils . .. too young for an appendix...

how about a prefrontal lobotomy?"
But I guess it could have been worse.
They could have decided to implant some
foreign object. I became painfully aware of
this possibility when my ever-alert
premed buddy showed me a list of more
than 120 different metallic objects that
have been designed to be surgically placed
in human bodies â€” and that's not even
taking into account stuff like breast
implants.
But anyway, the scary thing about this
list of metal objects was not the sheer
number, or even that it included an artifi
cial urinary sphincter, but rather that it
listed 10 different penile implants.
This was news to me. I was unaware
that such things existed, let alone that any

sane American male would willingly sub
mit to such an operation. I asked several of
my friends about this, and they all
responded with very similar shudders. I
guess we just felt that there were some
places that technology should just stay out
of, and, well, this was one of the big ones.
But these things do indeed exist and
come in various styles, including (and I
swear I am not making this up) the Flexi-
Rod 11, the Mentor Inflatable and of
course the Malleable 600. I called up
American Medical Systems in Minneton
ka, Minn., one of the companies that
makes these devices, and tried to get some
of my questions answered.
I talked with Denise Ulrich, a very nice
lady who told me that her company had

sold more than 100,000 penile implants
over the last 20 years. She wouldn't tell
me how expensive they were, but I did
find out that the Malleable 600 was their
only model with no mechanical parts.
She then went on to explain how the
other designs work, describing the pumps
and reservoir systems, as well as giving
me valuable technical advice, such as
"You always put two cylinders in the
penis."
Well, that's it for my investigative
reporting this week, boys and girls. Stay
tuned 'till next time when we examine
Chronic Bazooka Barfing Syndrome.
