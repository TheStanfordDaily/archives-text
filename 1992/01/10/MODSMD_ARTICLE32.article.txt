A transnational technical society
has awarded its Taylor L. Booth
Education Award for 1991 to Prof.
Edward McCluskey, director of the
Center for Reliable Computing, for
his pioneering work in combining
computers and engineering.
The award was given by the
Institute of Electrical and Elec
tronics Engineers (lEEE) Comput
er Society for what the society
called "outstanding service as a
computer science and engineering
educator and for inspiring students
and educators alike through his
prolific contributions as a teacher,
author, curriculum developer and
graduate research supervisor."
"Back in the old days there
wasn't any digital stuff" in electri
cal engineering, said McCluskey, a
professor in both electrical engi
neering and computer science. He

was one of the first people who set
about changing this when he
established the computer engi
neering curriculum at Princeton
University in 1959.
"The big thing was to start from
nothing and get reasonable
resources," said McCluskey, noting
faculty have to compete for common
resources in their departments.
McCluskey faced a different
problem when he came to Stanford
in 1966. When he started the Digi
tal Systems Laboratory as a joint
activity between the Electrical
Engineering and Computer Sci
ence Departments, he said "nobody
was turning out good faculty."
There was, however, much coop
eration between the chairs of the
two departments.
In 1967, when the laboratory
was established, this was not a
common arrangement. In fact,
Stanford's Computer Science
department — established two

years earlier — was only the sec
ond in the nation and there were
only a handful of universities
offering computer-related courses
at all.
