# Earth Systems major finally gets approved
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The Earth Systems major was
approved by the Faculty Senate
yesterday afternoon with less
opposition than supporters had
initially feared.
"This marks a great moment
for Stanford undergraduates and
for environmental research
nationwide," said Biology and
Geophysics Prof. Jonathan
Roughgarden, chair of the Earth
Systems steering committee.
"This innovative program will
attract a lot of attention."
The interdisciplinary program
is a response to "scholarly inter
ests that are paralleled by societal
interests" and will "look at large,
complex problems," said Civil
Engineering Assoc. Prof. David
Freyberg, chair of the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies.
The committee had originally
approved the Earth Systems
major last year, but the full sen
ate postponed consideration of
the proposal until concerns about
funding and planning could be
addressed.
Earth Systems, like all other
interdisciplinary programs, will
undergo periodic reviews of the
curriculum by the senate. The ini
tial review will examine the pro
gram's funding as well as the
quality of the courses offered.
Although supporters of the
new program had feared opposi
tion in the senate from faculty
who questioned beginning new
programs at a time when the bud
get crisis is forcing significant
cuts on existing programs,
Roughgarden said faculty opposi

tion was less than he had feared.
Several faculty argued that
regardless of the current fiscal
problems, important new pro
grams must continue to be creat
ed.
"We must not stifle faculty
innovation in this time of budget
crisis," said Political Science
Assoc. Prof. Terry Karl.
English Prof. George Dekker
said that despite his concerns
about the budget, he does "not
want us to go into a period when
we are no longer willing to sup
port curricular advancements."
In addition to the support of
several faculty, Roughgarden said
that University President Donald
Kennedy's statements were
"extremely helpful" during the
debate.
Kennedy told the senate that
start-up costs for Earth Systems
were "modest compared to other
interdisciplinary programs." He
also emphasized that the outside
funding was "non-competitive" —
meaning that the money for the
program will not come from
sources that would otherwise
have donated funds for another
area of the University.
"The environment is an area
that has attracted unique sup
port" from a variety of organiza
tions, Kennedy said when further
pressed on the funding issue.
With the approval of the Earth
Systems program, students can
now declare the major they have
been waiting more than a year for.
"Twenty-five students will
sleep better tonight knowing that
they have a major," said Geology
Lecturer and Program Director
Dan Orange.
