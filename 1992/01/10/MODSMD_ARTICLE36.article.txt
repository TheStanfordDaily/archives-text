# Group to evaluate services for gays
## 
### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
A task force is working this
quarter to evaluate how effec
tively the University is address
ing the needs of gay, lesbian
and bisexual students.
Formed under the auspices of
Dean of Students Michael Jack
son, the task force will examine
issues such as health, self
esteem and experiences with
homophobia to make recom
mendations on how the student
resources offices on campus can
better serve these students.
"It's a difficult group to get
information from," said Troy
Gilbert, program coordinator
at the Office of Student Activi
ties and a member of the task
force. "So we're looking at a lot
of different ideas."
The services being examined
include financial aid, Residen
tial Education, Cowell Student
Health Center, the community
centers and others, he said.
The goal, Gilbert said, is to
determine which services are
good, and then "see how others
can be improved."
According to task force chair
Bobbi Braden, who is assistant
dean and director of Tresidder
Memorial Union, "years of con

cerns from the students and
the community that we heard
expressed" sparked the forma
tion of the new group.
"But it's hard to comment on
the exact nature of those con
cerns until we have finished
gathering information," she said.
Elizabeth Feingold, a gradu
ate student on the task force
and the coordinator of the Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual commu
nity center, said students have
wanted better services for some
time, but that "administrators
feel they need more evidence."
For instance, Feingold said,
gay students need financial aid
options if their "parents cut
them off when they come out."
She also said students have
sought help dealing with "the
problems that people in the
residences, especially under
graduates," have with homo
phobia.
One option for gathering
information, Braden said, is to
conduct a survey of gay, lesbian
and bisexual students. One-on
one interviews are also being
considered.
Braden said her group hopes
to spend the next month gath
ering the necessary informa
tion, for a preliminary report
due April 1.
