# Researchers blast tunes to find hearing danger

It felt like another earthquake, but it was just
the stereo in Gunn High School senior Sean Jones'
black '83 Mustang.
Jones and seven other students converged on
the school parking lot yesterday with their car

stereos booming to participate in a Stanford Med
ical Center study on hearing loss produced by lis
tening to loud music in the car.
A host of the high school students' friends and
other curious onlookers gathered as Medical School
Surgery Prof. Blair Simmons measured the decibel
level of the music, mostly rap, pouring from the cars.

Simmons, an ear, throat and nose specialist,
explained that this type of music has high bass lev
els, which do not harm the ear. On the other hand,
Simmons said, "If you blast classical music, you
can produce (hearing) damage. I wouldn't listen to
Beethoven in there."
Simmons said he actually found the students'
heavy bass rather soothing. "It's a good body mas
sage. You get in there and it's pretty relaxing."
While some participants, like Jones, said they
showed up just to find out how strong their system
was, others were genuinely worried about hearing loss.
Senior Mike Evans, who was once "busted by
some cops" for his loud stereo, complained that on
some mornings he wakes up and has trouble hear
ing out of his right ear. "I don't want to be deaf
when I'm 25 or 30," he said.
Jones' only problem with his stereo seems to be
that his rear-view mirror falls off sometimes when
he turns the volume up too loud.
The students who participated in the study
were first asked various questions ranging from
their previous hearing problems, if any, to the
type of music they listen to.
Then students were taken to a separate room to
have their hearing tested while Simmons or his
colleague, Kent Ramsey, a resident at Stanford
Hospital, read the decibel levels of the car stereos.
Simmons and Ramsey concluded that most of the
students played their stereos at about 110 to 120
decibels, which causes hearing damage only if a per
son listens to it for more than three hours at a time.
Although this type of noise level is typical at
many concerts, it is more dangerous in the car,
where the sound is concentrated. "Being in the car
is like being inside the speaker cabinet at a small
club," Ramsey explained.
None of the students tested showed any signs of
hearing damage, even though the vibrating park
ing lot may have suggested otherwise.
