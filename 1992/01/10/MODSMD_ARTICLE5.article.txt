# Search update: 350 nominated to lead Stanford
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
The Presidential Search Committee has produced
350 nominations after advertising, writing letters
and talking with leaders in education.
"The nominations are coming from across the
spectrum," said Jean Fetter, the committee's execu
tive vice chair. "And they keep arriving every day."
The committee has announced a Jan. 17 deadline
for nominations. It meets today to begin evaluating
the candidates for whom it has received nominations.
Some 20 to 30 candidates have had more than a
dozen letters sent on their behalf, Fetter said. "The
rest are mostly one-shot nominations," she added.
Most of the candidates were nominated by col
leagues, Fetter said, but a few applied for the position.
The committee has planned a series of open meet
ings with students, faculty and staff for early next
week. Subgroups of committee members will conduct
the sessions.
James Sheehan, the committee's vice chair, said
the forums will "help inform the committee mem
bers of what various members of the University com
munity see as the problems facing the institution,
and the qualities we should be look
ing for in the next president."
The nominations were produced
by an extensive outreach process
the committee conducted in
November and December.
That process included:
• Letters to every Stanford
alumnus, numbering about
150,000. The letters solicit
"thoughts about the criteria that
should be used for the selection"
and "nominations of individuals
you think should be considered
for the presidency."
• Letters to all Academic Council
members, Hoover Senior Fellows
and the presidents, provosts and
deans of other major universities.
• Advertisements in the New
York Times, Wall Street Journal,
Washington Post, the Chronicle
of Higher Education and severai
national academic publications
with largely minority audiences.
Committee members have also
conducted some 40 telephone
interviews with the nation's aca
demic leaders, Sheehan said.
The mailings cost the commit
tee about $70,000 and the adver
tisements totaled nearly $20,000,
Fetter confirmed. She added that
they are "a worthwhile invest
ment because it is an appoint
ment of such importance to the
whole Stanford family."
Harvard sociologist David
Riesman, who has written exten
sively about higher education and
whose book, "Choosing a College
President," is widely used by
presidential search committees,
said one thing that distinguishes
the Stanford committee's work so
far is its extensive outreach.
"A mistake many committees
make is in passively accepting and
reviewing applications rather than
actively seeking candidates," he
said.
Every nomination is acknowl
edged by a return letter, Fetter
said. Committee staff have also cre
ated a file on every nominee.
The committee is composed of
six faculty members, six trustees
and single student, staff and alum
ni representatives.
It is charged with identifying
and nominating a candidate to the
Board of Trustees by June. The
board has final responsibility for
the decision.
