Stanford's international en
rollment hit a record high in 1991
for the sixth year in a row, accord
ing to an annual report released
by the Bechtel International Cen
ter.
This increase, however, has
not been across the board. The
number of students from the Mid
dle East and Africa has dropped
dramatically, while the represen
tation from Asian countries has
increased.
This fall, international students
comprised 3.1 percent of under
graduates at Stanford, as com
pared with 2.7 percent last year.
International students also
make up 21 percent of graduate stu
dents and 42 percent of post-doctor
al students. There are now 2,114
international students overall, com
pared to about 2,000 last year.
The number of students from
Asian and Pacific Rim countries
has seen the most growth over
the last decade. About 49 percent
of Stanford's international stu
dents come from Asia.
China squeezed out Japan as
the country with the most stu
dents at Stanford in 1991, with
206 representatives as compared
with Japan's 185. In 1979, there
were only two Chinese students
at Stanford.
"The change in relations
between the U.S. and China is
certainly a cause of this increase,"
said John Pearson, director of the
I-Center.
There have also been increases
in the number of students from
the former Soviet Union. When
Gorbachev visited campus in
June, 1990, there was only one
Soviet student on campus, where
as today there are 14 from the for
mer Soviet Union.
"I expect to see a lot more
applications from the Iformer
Soviet republics! during the next
few years," Pearson said.
In contrast to the growing
number of Asian and Soviet stu
dents, representation from the
Sub-Saharan African countries,
Latin American and the Middle
East has been falling dramatically.
"The number of international
black students has decreased over
the last few years. The number of
students from the oil-producing

countries of the Middle East have
also drastically gone down due to
the economy and the drop in the
oil prices," Pearson said.
Political upheaval in the Mid
dle East has also played a role.
The number of Iranian stu
dents, for example, has gone from
91 in 1980 to only 13 in 1991.
About 6 percent of Stanford's
international students come from
the Middle East, about 2 percent
from Africa and 2 percent are
from the Pacific Basin.
Nearly one-fourth of the inter
national students are from
Europe, said Pearson. However,
"The number of students from
Western Europe is experiencing
only a slow to steady growth."
The Americas, including Cana
da, Mexico and all of South Amer
ica, comprise about 15 percent of
the total.
The increases in the number of
international students at Stan
ford is representative of a nation
wide increase at many other uni
versities, Pearson said.
"Stanford is ranked among the
top 20 universities in the U.S.
according to the number of for
eign students," he said.
The School of Earth Sciences
has the highest percentage of non
immigrant international students,
both graduate and under gradu
ate, with 39.4 percent. The School
of Engineering is second, followed
by the School of Business.
The most popular major for
international students is electri
cal engineering, and about 40 per
cent of all the international stu
dents are registered in this or the
other engineering fields.
Because Stanford followed a
nationwide change this year in the
criteria for counting international
students, "The number of inter
national students that is reported
to federal agencies has actually
gone down," Pearson said.
"Some of the students not
counted as international students
.. . may have only lived in the U.S.
for only a short time," he said.
Non-U.S. citizen students who
are permanent residents were
previously counted along with the
non-immigrant students. The
total number of non-immigrant
and permanent resident students
has gone up from 2,534 last year
to 2,660 this year.
