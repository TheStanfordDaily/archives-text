ning jobs for Americans.
But executives from the auto industry, the supposed beneficia
ry of trade concessions squeezed from Japan after arduous nego

Japan's huge trade surpluses.

Gates, under pressure, eyes mayor's job
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Embattled Police Chief Daryl Gates,
pressured to leave office since the police beating of a black
motorist, said yesterday when he retires he may consider running
for an opponent's job — mayor.
"If I do not find someone to have confidence in, I probably will
run," Gates said in an interview broadcast on NBC-TV's "Today"
morning talk show.
Some of the loudest criticism since the March 3 videotaped
beating of Rodney King has been launched by Gates' political
opponent Mayor Tom Bradley.
