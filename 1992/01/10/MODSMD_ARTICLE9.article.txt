# 1-900 numbers back
## Pay-per-call services billable to PACs

Stanford students frustrated
by their inability to access 976 and
900 numbers from campus resi
dences may have their desires ful
filled within the next few months.
According to Jan Thomson,
director of Communication Ser
vices, a pilot program is being
developed that will allow students
with personal access codes to dial
these pay-per-call information
and entertainment services.
Thomson expects the service to
be available to students by "late
winter."
When student phone service
was transferred to the University
system in September 1990, student
access to 976 and 900 numbers was
cut off. Although Communication
Services has received requests to
reinstate access, the switch isn't as
easy as it might seem.
The hang-up, said Thomson, is
in the billing procedure.
While these calls can be incred

ibly expensive — bills upward of
$50 per call are not uncommon —
Thomson's main concern is the
delay that often elapses between
the call's placement and the
arrival of the bill.
In some cases, billing can lag as
much as three months behind the
initial call. This complicates
billing procedures for the Univer
sity, which must wait to receive
charges from individual services
before billing the students.
Stanford does not stand to gain
anything from reinstating access
to these services, she said. In fact,
Thomson added, "What I'm
afraid of is that we're going to
lose money."
Stanford currently allows fac
ulty, staff and students access to
only two 900 numbers — help
lines for Microsoft and Lotus
computer companies. These par
ticular lines are available, Thom
son said, because Communication
Services officials felt people need
ed these services.
