Statistical Software that's
easy to use and easy to afford
Learning statistics is difficult
enough. Why should you have
to struggle with your statistical
software as well?
You don't have to.
Abacus Concepts has been
designing easy to use, yet pow

ware since 1984. In fact, our
StatView® line has won the Mac
world World Class Award for
Best Statistics Software four
times. No other Macintosh
statistics program has over won
this award.
Now there's a student version of
StatView. We worked with pro
fessors and instructors all over
the country to arrive at the
proper combination of statistics
and graphing features for stu

with was StatView Student.
