"My first case at Cornerstone Research was a multi-million dollar securities case.
As a Summer Analyst, / produced a comprehensive report detailing short interest
selling in the case. I presented my findings to the project team, the faculty expert on
the case, and our attorney clients. Since joining full-time, I have analyzed insider
trading, failed S&Ls, dividend cuts in the electric utility industry; and competitive
forces within the disk drive industry. Because each case is unique, the process of
learning and developing never ends."
