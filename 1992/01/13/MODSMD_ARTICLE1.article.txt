# 'Major' cuts face Meyer
## Staff layoffs looming 
### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
Roughly 10 percent of the University's library
staff may be laid off and Meyer Library's reference
services suspended, if the recommendations of
library task groups are accepted.
The budget-cutting recommendations also sug
gest that Meyer be eliminated as an undergraduate
library by merging its book collection with those of
other libraries.
"We can only save money by cutting jobs," said
Michael Miller, the head of Meyer. "We can't just
reduce slightly. Major restructuring is necessary."
Miller is a member of one of the four task groups
charged with making recommendations to reduce
the library system's budget by $3.1 million.
Staff cuts make up the largest share of that total
in the proposal. The libraries' other main expendi
ture — the materials budget, which includes order
ing subscriptions and buying books — is scheduled
for a $450,000 reduction.
The task groups' final recommendations will be
forwarded to Provost James Rosse Jan. 17. The
Cabinet Committee on Budget and Strategic Plan
ning will review them and announce the final Uni
versity-wide reductions in mid-April.
Miller said it is likely the recommendations for
library cuts "may just be accepted as is" by the cab
inet committee because they meet the reduction
target for the library system.
The staff cuts will not be "across the board,"
Miller said. "Some areas will have their staffs cut 20
percent and others will be untouched."
If the recommendations are followed, Meyer will
be hit especially hard. The reference desk and some
of Meyer's other services will be eliminated, accord
ing to Karen Nagy, the director of Meyer and chair
of the task group on curriculum support.
However, not all of Meyer's reference staff will
be laid off. Some staff members will be shifted to
Green and other libraries, Nagy said.
In another likely cut, much of Meyer's book col
lection may be merged into the overall library sys
tem, Miller said.
"We got a lot of input from the students, and we
found that undergraduates used all the libraries on
campus," Nagy said. "The artificial distinction [of
campus," Nagy said. "The artifi
cial distinction [of Meyer as a sep
arate undergraduate library!
wasn't that important."
However, Meyer as a library
would not disappear. "The media
center, the language lab, the com
puter cluster and the reserves will

still remain in Meyer," Nagy said.
Other staff cuts may be made in
the libraries' cataloguing depart
ments. Karen Kalinsky, the co-chief
of the catalog department and the
chair of the task group on levels of
bibliographic access, said it will be
possible to catalog the library collec
tions with a much smaller staff.
"We could buy the (catalogu
ing) service from independent
vendors or shift to automation,"
Kalinsky said. "The services will

be the same, although we may
have to catalog some (of the col
lection) less fully."
Although Nagy said a great
effort will be made to make sure
services and support remain the
same, Miller emphasized that the
libraries face substantial change.
"The services and resources
will be there, but they may look
different," Miller said. "Reposi
tioning — when everything took a
16 percent cut — will be impossi

ble to do again. We have to
restructure and cut everywhere
that we can think we can spare."
Miller said that "both clerical
workers and librarians will be cut."
However, he added that the
task groups have not yet recom
mended which specific staff mem
bers should be cut. "That's not
official yet," Miller said. "What
we have figured out is, for exam
ple, that a certain department
needs to lose two people."
