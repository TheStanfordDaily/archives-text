# Campus shuttle service uses larger buses
## Improvement results from contract switch aimed to reduce costs 
### Clea Shannon 
A change in contractors for the Marguerite
Shuttle Service — primarily aimed at saving
money — has had the happy result of produc
ing new and improved buses as well, according
to a University official.
Diego Terneus, program manager for the
Marguerite Shuttle Service, said the larger
Marguerite buses now circling the campus
resulted in part from University budget cuts.
The new contract with Industrial Passen
ger Service, which became effective in Septem
ber, included several improvements and saved
money without cutting services, Terneus said.
The new shuttles are the most obvious

changes. "When we set up the new contract, we
requested buses of a little larger size than
before," along with some other changes,
Terneus said.
The buses hold up to 25 passengers, and all
of the seats face forward. The shuttles also
have clocks installed in them, a move Terneus
hopes has the effect of helping "the drivers
and the passengers to monitor the 'on-time'
performance."
The free shuttles are used by almost 1,100
riders each day, transporting students and
faculty to downtown Palo Alto, the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, Stanford Shopping
Center and two local train stations, among
other destinations.

Terneus said, "There were some com
plaints" when the new contract became effec
tive. As a result of widespread construction on
campus, as well as detours for the Centennial
celebrations, "many riders complained that
the shuttles were running late or that the
drivers didn't know the routes," he explained.
However, since the Centennial events and
some of the construction came to an end, the
Marguerite shuttles have been running
smoothly, he said.
Faced with budget cuts, "our other plans
have been put on the backburner," said
Terneus, who hopes to run morning shuttles
to downtown Palo Alto and open up new
routes "when the budget situation improves."
