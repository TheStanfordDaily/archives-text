Democrats leap on trade issue
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush went to Japan hoping
to bury the trade issue, but his trip gave it new life on Capitol Hill,
where Democrats are preparing for an election-year session.
"Not only has the president done himself political harm, he has
done the country economic harm," said Rep. Thomas Downey, D-
N.Y., who said that "the worst elements of protectionism" were
gaining because Bush "opened that Pandora's box."
Some Democrats, like Downey, warn of protectionism, while
others say Bush must do more to fight Japanese imports. Some
Democrats want to raise tax rates for the rich, while others push to
plow some of the defense spending cuts back into people's pockets.
The Democrats' leaders in Congress must figure out how to
keep the divisions within the party from dissipating any advan
tage that might be won.
Yeltsin threatens to grab military control
MOSCOW (AP) — Russian and Ukrainian officials haggled
Saturday over a joint military and Boris Yeltsin threatened to
seize control of all troops in the commonwealth until Ukraine and
other states agree to a unified force, Russian media said.
Yeltsin apparently was trying to ease Western concern about
military fragmentation and force Ukraine and other states either
to accept control by the Commonwealth of Independent States or
face a new adversary in Russia.
But the maneuver appeared to be falling on deaf ears. Belarussian
lawmakers on Saturday gave more power to their Defense Ministry.
Algerian president resigns
ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — Like Mikhail Gorbachev, Chadli
Bendjedid planted the seeds of democratic reform that brought
his own party and political career to an impasse.
Algeria's president since 1979 and a loyal member of the ruling
party since independence in 1962, Bendjedid announced his res
ignation Saturday night on national television.
He leaves his National Liberation Front on the brink of humil
iation as the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front heads
toward likely control of Parliament after run-off elections on
Thursday.
