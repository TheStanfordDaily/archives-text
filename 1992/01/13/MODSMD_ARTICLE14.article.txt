## Hoovers and shakers 
### 
The hoover institution
on War, Revolution and Peace
has often been under fire at
Stanford for its sometimes controver
sial personnel and their ideas. But
recently, Hoover has been one of the
few positive points of light in Stan
ford's national image.
In a time when the media are hav
ing a field day with Stanford's budget
woes, Hoover is busy getting interna
tional kudos from The Economist,
which rated the institution No. 1 in
its world-wide review of think tanks.
Hoover, respected globally for its
crack faculty and extensive libraries,
has long deserved this honor.
During the past year, Hoover
economists have been advising
Soviet leaders in their transition to
a free-market economy.
Not only does this growing rela
tionship — instigated by Russian
President Boris Yeltsin — repre
sent a major academic coup for the
institution, it enhances the de
tente between the United States

and the fledgling commonwealth.
When the dust of transition set
tles, the Hoover economists will be
recognized as important partici
pants in the rebuilding process.
In addition to its international
activities, Hoover's archives fea
ture an outstanding collection of
historical texts, including many
original Soviet documents, as well
as a large hunk of the Berlin wall.
With such noted scholars and
dignitaries as George Shultz, Mil
ton Friedman, Robert Conquest
and Edward Teller — among many
others — Hoover routinely attracts
world leaders to campus. In the last
year, the Prime Ministers of both
Israel and South Korea have visit
ed Hoover, and the former Foreign
Minister of Chile is currently there.
Without a doubt, this "best of
times" for Hoover has made Stan
ford's "worst of times" a lot more
bearable. Hoover's distinguished
international stature is a major
asset to this University.
