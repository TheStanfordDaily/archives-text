# Minnesota goes Green
## 
### 
Coach dennis green
has transformed the rubble
that we knew as the Stan
ford football team into a well-oiled
machine that shines at the top of
its division.
With success like that, it's no
surprise that the Minnesota
Vikings lured him away. Green
was a plum ripe for picking.
While his departure will be a
great loss to the entire Stanford
community, it is an impressive
achievement for the winning coach.
Some detractors claim Green
has no loyalty to Stanford for
making this choice. They insist he
should turn down the lucrative
offer from Minnesota and contin
ue to build on the Cardinal's suc
cess. But this attitude is unfair.
Green wasn't a student here; he
was an employee. If successful staff
members get offers for more attrac
tive positions, no one calls them dis
loyal when they leave. It's career

advancement, plain and simple.
Green's collegiate success has
opened well-deserved national doors.
Many attribute his success to the
family-style atmosphere that helped
make players comfortable with each
other. Whether this psychology will
work with a bunch of 30-year-olds
who have families of their own will
be seen next season â€” but this
should not be the only measure of
his success in the coming months.
Green's appointment makes
him the second black NFL coach in
modern history, a mark that
should have been reached long ago,
considering that 65 percent of NFL
players are black. Now, Green has
the opportunity to level the playing
field for other minorities who are
qualified to become coaches.
Instead of being sad or bitter at
his departure, we should celebrate
his legacy at Stanford, and the
powerful message it sends about
an individual's ability to succeed.
