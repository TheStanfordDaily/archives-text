Fiscal belt-tightening of Drama Dept. threatens suffocation

ONE MORNING LAST WEEK I
received a letter from a fellow
alumnus and long-time theater
collaborator informing me that the Stan
ford Drama Department is in danger of
being drastically reduced or eliminated.
That afternoon I attended a board
meeting of a local arts organization, at
which we discussed whether to disband
the organization, due to funding short
falls.
That evening a theater company
which has commissioned me to write a
play was deciding whether it can afford
to remain in existence.
To face such a cascade of tumbling
arts institutions — and all in one day —
makes me wonder whether I should not
just pack up my playwriting files, the
saurus, slang dictionary, rhyming dictio
nary and assorted theater books and

store them in mothballs until the reces
sion is over.
I will not give up so easily.
Yet in these difficult economic times,
I would hope to find a better role model
in Stanford. Now, more than ever, there
is a need for leading institutions such as
Stanford to demonstrate their commit
ment to the preservation of the dramatic
arts.
I transferred to Stanford in 1981
from the University of Washington, a
school with an excellent drama program.
I was then toying with being a drama
major, and would not have transferred
but for the fact that Stanford also had a
top-notch drama department.
At Stanford I took many classes in
drama and worked on numerous student
productions — both within and outside
the department. In my senior year I

directed the Gaieties spring musical,
"Hello, Dolly!"
I subsequently chose Stanford Law
School over Yale because I wanted to
continue working within the drama com
munity I had come to know and love.
Even while in law school, I directed,
acted in and wrote plays performed on
campus and helped administer theater
organizations.
My drama experience at Stanford
gave me the primary guiding force and
passion in my life, and directly fueled my
decision to pursue a dual career as an
arts attorney and playwright.
Already I have had encouraging play
writing success. But playwriting is hard
stuff, and I am certain that I would not
have had my success to date — nor the
perseverance to continue — were it not
for the education, and inspiration I

received at Stanford.
The Stanford Drama Department
makes an essential contribution to intel
lectual life on campus and to the vibran
cy of the artistic community. The effect
of the department cannot be measured
by the number of drama majors alone.
The department as a stimulus to
creative endeavor throughout the Uni
versity; its faculty and graduate stu
dents serve as excellent teachers to all.
I recognize this is a time for belt
tightening, but a belt tightened in the
wrong place can impair one's ability to
breath. Without access to the full range
of great arts and literature, campus life
slowly, and surely, would suffocate.
The proposed cuts must be reconsid
ered and the Drama Department saved.
