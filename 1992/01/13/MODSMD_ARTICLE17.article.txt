# Athletics Dept.'s Aloha Bowl scandal: Where was the Band?
## 
### 
Replays of the Aloha Bowl show that
Stanford actually won, 20-18! The
deciding points came on a last minute
field goal by the Stanford Band. As a
result of the re-examination, Stanford's
record will be changed from 7-4 to 8-3.
This is not true because it turns out
that the Stanford Band did not go to the
Aloha Bowl. The Band was invited to the
game, but the Stanford Department of
Athletics decided that the Band did not
deserve to travel with the team like any
other school's band.
Winning teams always bring their
bands. Scott Morris, whose University of
Washington Huskies are now National
Champions, states simply, "We never
leave our band behind." And Georgia
Tech certainly brought its musicians —
brought them nearly twice as far, in fact,
as Stanford had to travel.
Georgia Tech, on the other hand,
didn't spend money on some of the things

that Stanford did; for instance there was
the six-day paid vacation in Hawaii,
including scuba diving lessons. The Stan
ford Athletics department's official
excuse for not sending the Band was that
it could not afford it. If that is so, then
there is a question of what it could afford.
Stanford was given two-thirds of a
million dollars for the bowl, and no mat
ter how you add it up, there is either
money left over or someone is trying to
attract Paul Biddle's attention.
The compelling issue here really isn't
money, but Stanford spirit and team
support. The Band's official charter —
yes, there is one — states that the
Band's purpose is "to provide quality
music and entertainment for the Univer
sity and the greater Stanford communi
ty." And they do an admirable job of it.
The football team gets a huge amount
of support from the Band. Great rock 'n'
roll music, shows and not a little bit of

craziness are an integral part of any good
Stanford game, and every home game.
And for anyone who thinks the Band is
still not enthusiastic enough about the
football team, there is a way to change
things. It only seems fair to have the
Band's fate tied to the fate of the team.
As it is, if Cardinal football has a lousy
year, the Band gets to stay home and
wish for better days. If the Stanford
team has a banner year, the Band gets to
stay home and wish for better days. The
Band is always there; it is as much a part
of ball games as the team itself. But we
can't expect Band members to get really
excited about the team when they're
spurned by the Athletics department.
Let's be fair. The Band was invited. It
is chartered as "a representative of Stan
ford." And it should have traveled to the
Aloha Bowl.
Most people, watching the game at
home, were unaware of the Band's

absence. Those who learn of this fact are
often confused or surprised, and in a few
cases amazed or angry. The Athletics
department made a big mistake in leav
ing its biggest supporters behind.
We could have won that game.
