# Ex-coach Walsh mulls return
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
The missing piece in Stan
ford's football jigsaw puzzle will
snap into place this week — and
that piece might be one that
Stanford lost more than a
decade ago. Former Cardinal
head coach Bill Walsh could
paint the picture of Stanford's
football future.
ESPN reported last night
that Walsh had been contacted
by Stanford, a report that Ath
letic Director Ted Leland would
not confirm or deny.
"I am not going to comment
on any candidates at the pre
sent time," Leland said in an
interview last night. "We are
going to look at the present staff
first and look at other options
later. I will say we have gotten
many phone calls and it is not
like we are going to stick our
heads in the ground."
Walsh coached at Stanford for
two years, accumulating a 17-7
record and leading the Cardinal

to consecutive bowl berths — the
Sun Bowl in 1977 and the Blue
bonnet Bowl in 1978. Stanford
has appeared in only two bowls
since Walsh left to coach the San
Francisco 49ers. While at San
Francisco, he led the team to
three Super Bowl victories.
Although sources say the new
coach is likely to come from
inside, even Iceland acknowledges
that Stanford's 30th head football
coach could be almost anyone.
"We are very uncertain for
coaches right now," Leland said
at a press conference Friday,
"but are open to look at anybody
as quickly as seems prudent."
Insiders say Cardinal defen
sive coordinator Willie Shaw
and offensive coordinator Ron
Turner are the two leading can
didates. Asst. Athletic Director
Tom Beckett said that informal
talks with the two have gone on,
but the official process will not
begin until this week.
The school would like to get a

new coach quickly in order to regain the sta
bility that was lost with Green's departure.
This past weekend 17 recruits visited Stan
ford. According to Shaw the visits were not
adversely affected by the changeover.
"It went as well as it could go," Shaw
said. 'The recruits understood that Stan
ford University did not go to Minnesota."
According to Leland, 11 recruits have
already verbally committed to Stanford.
Shaw, who has been dubbed the front
runner, said that although he would like to
become head coach at Stanford, his loyalty
remains with Green. "If Denny Green
offers me a job, I'll go with Denny Green,"
he said
Still, it is uncertain how much control
Green will have in choosing his staff in Min
nesota, or whether he wants Shaw to join
him. In lieu of this, Shaw is keeping his
options open.
"I feel I could be an excellent coach at
Stanford," said Shaw, whose son David is a
receiver on the team. "I have a close associ
ation with the school. . . . This is a job I'd
love to have."
Though Leland said the final decision
would be between himself and University
President Donald Kennedy, according to
Beckett the selection process will involve

many different people.
"It is a whole process that will take a
number of people through meetings with
candidates," Beckett said. "There is a pro
cess established with more than just
[Leland] talking to people."
Though Leland announced Friday that
no formal search committee would be
formed, he maintained that different voices
would be heard. Beckett said in an inter
view yesterday that current players would
also be consulted.
"I think it's important that the players
have a voice," Beckett said. "There will be a
part of the process where the players will be
asked to be involved."
Leland said in the press conference that
looking internally for a coach could help
maintain stability in the program. This is a
viewpoint current players share.
"I think the most important thing is to
try to maintain some kind of continuity,"
offensive lineman Brian Cassidy said. "It is
a young program, only three years old; we
are definitely moving up, and we wouldn't
like to take any steps down."
Cassidy could not say whether Shaw or
Turner would get the job, but said he want
ed to keep attention focused on the current
coaching staff.
"They know the systems and we have
great respect for the entire staff," Cassidy
said. "That's one of the great things that
Coach Green brought to the Uni
versity. He assembled one of the
better coaching staffs in the coun
try — no question. There are peo
ple here with the qualifications."
Leland said Stanford was a
unique place to coach and Green's
successor would have to conform
to certain expectations.
"We need someone who is sym
pathetic to the kind of athletic
program we have here — the bal
ance between the institutional
mission and athletic imperatives,

the desire to win but win within a
certain context," he said.
"We also need someone with a
vision to take us to the next level.
We are happy where we are, but
we need to take the next step."
Stanford finished the 1991 sea
son second in the Pacific 10 Con
ference (6-2) with an 8-4 overall
record and a berth in the Aloha
Bowl. It was the Cardinal's best
season since 1986, when the team
went 8-4 and played in the Gator
Bowl.
"We have had a good year, but
not really as good as it will be next
year," Leland said. "It will be dif
ficult to carry on (without Green),
but I think we can pick up and not

feel it."
After the press conference the
players did not express bitterness
toward their former coach,
instead lauding his contributions
to the program.
"We are disappointed that
Coach Green has left, but we have
to understand that what he has
left behind is something great,"
halfback Glyn Milburn said. He
"will be missed, but I think the
person who fills the job will be
able to have success."
Though he admitted it was
ambitious, Leland said he hoped
to name a new head coach within
the week because Stanford is deep
within the recruiting period.

sent time," Leland said in an
interview last night. "We are
going to look at the present staff
first and look at other options
later. I will say we have gotten
many phone calls and it is not
like we are going to stick our
heads in the ground."
Walsh coached at Stanford for
two years, accumulating a 17-7
record and leading the Cardinal

to consecutive bowl berths — the
Sun Bowl in 1977 and the Blue
bonnet Bowl in 1978. Stanford
has appeared in only two bowls
since Walsh left to coach the San
Francisco 49ers. While at San
Francisco, he led the team to
three Super Bowl victories.
Although sources say the new
coach is likely to come from
inside, even Iceland acknowledges
that Stanford's 30th head football
coach could be almost anyone.
"We are very uncertain for
coaches right now," Leland said
at a press conference Friday,
"but are open to look at anybody
as quickly as seems prudent."
Insiders say Cardinal defen
sive coordinator Willie Shaw
and offensive coordinator Ron
Turner are the two leading can
didates. Asst. Athletic Director
Tom Beckett said that informal
talks with the two have gone on,
but the official process will not
begin until this week.

new coach quickly in order to regain the sta
bility that was lost with Green's departure.
This past weekend 17 recruits visited Stan
ford. According to Shaw the visits were not
adversely affected by the changeover.
"It went as well as it could go," Shaw
said. 'The recruits understood that Stan
ford University did not go to Minnesota."
According to Leland, 11 recruits have
already verbally committed to Stanford.
Shaw, who has been dubbed the front
runner, said that although he would like to
become head coach at Stanford, his loyalty
remains with Green. "If Denny Green
offers me a job, I'll go with Denny Green,"
he said
Still, it is uncertain how much control
Green will have in choosing his staff in Min
nesota, or whether he wants Shaw to join
him. In lieu of this, Shaw is keeping his
options open.
"I feel I could be an excellent coach at
Stanford," said Shaw, whose son David is a
receiver on the team. "I have a close associ
ation with the school. . . . This is a job I'd
love to have."
Though Leland said the final decision
would be between himself and University
President Donald Kennedy, according to
Beckett the selection process will involve

many different people.
"It is a whole process that will take a
number of people through meetings with
candidates," Beckett said. "There is a pro
cess established with more than just
[Leland] talking to people."
Though Leland announced Friday that
no formal search committee would be
formed, he maintained that different voices
would be heard. Beckett said in an inter
view yesterday that current players would
also be consulted.
"I think it's important that the players
have a voice," Beckett said. "There will be a
part of the process where the players will be
asked to be involved."
Leland said in the press conference that
looking internally for a coach could help
maintain stability in the program. This is a
viewpoint current players share.
"I think the most important thing is to
try to maintain some kind of continuity,"
offensive lineman Brian Cassidy said. "It is
a young program, only three years old; we
are definitely moving up, and we wouldn't
like to take any steps down."
Cassidy could not say whether Shaw or
Turner would get the job, but said he want
ed to keep attention focused on the current
coaching staff.
"They know the systems and we have
great respect for the entire staff," Cassidy
said. "That's one of the great things that
Coach Green brought to the Uni
versity. He assembled one of the
better coaching staffs in the coun
try — no question. There are peo
ple here with the qualifications."
Leland said Stanford was a
unique place to coach and Green's
successor would have to conform
to certain expectations.
"We need someone who is sym
pathetic to the kind of athletic
program we have here — the bal
ance between the institutional
mission and athletic imperatives,

the desire to win but win within a
certain context," he said.
"We also need someone with a
vision to take us to the next level.
We are happy where we are, but
we need to take the next step."
Stanford finished the 1991 sea
son second in the Pacific 10 Con
ference (6-2) with an 8-4 overall
record and a berth in the Aloha
Bowl. It was the Cardinal's best
season since 1986, when the team
went 8-4 and played in the Gator
Bowl.
"We have had a good year, but
not really as good as it will be next
year," Leland said. "It will be dif
ficult to carry on (without Green),
but I think we can pick up and not

feel it."
After the press conference the
players did not express bitterness
toward their former coach,
instead lauding his contributions
to the program.
"We are disappointed that
Coach Green has left, but we have
to understand that what he has
left behind is something great,"
halfback Glyn Milburn said. He
"will be missed, but I think the
person who fills the job will be
able to have success."
Though he admitted it was
ambitious, Leland said he hoped
to name a new head coach within
the week because Stanford is deep
within the recruiting period.
The missing piece in Stan
ford's football jigsaw puzzle will
snap into place this week — and
that piece might be one that
Stanford lost more than a
decade ago. Former Cardinal
head coach Bill Walsh could
paint the picture of Stanford's
football future.
ESPN reported last night
that Walsh had been contacted
by Stanford, a report that Ath
letic Director Ted Leland would
not confirm or deny.
"I am not going to comment
on any candidates at the pre
sent time," Leland said in an
interview last night. "We are
going to look at the present staff
first and look at other options
later. I will say we have gotten
many phone calls and it is not
