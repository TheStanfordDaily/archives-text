# Ex-coach Walsh mulls return
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
The missing piece in Stan
ford's football jigsaw puzzle will
snap into place this week — and
that piece might be one that
Stanford lost more than a
decade ago. Former Cardinal
head coach Bill Walsh could
paint the picture of Stanford's
football future.
ESPN reported last night
that Walsh had been contacted
by Stanford, a report that Ath
letic Director Ted Leland would
not confirm or deny.
"I am not going to comment
on any candidates at the pre
sent time," Leland said in an
interview last night. "We are
going to look at the present staff
first and look at other options
later. I will say we have gotten
many phone calls and it is not
like we are going to stick our
heads in the ground."
Walsh coached at Stanford for
two years, accumulating a 17-7
record and leading the Cardinal

to consecutive bowl berths — the
Sun Bowl in 1977 and the Blue
bonnet Bowl in 1978. Stanford
has appeared in only two bowls
since Walsh left to coach the San
Francisco 49ers. While at San
Francisco, he led the team to
three Super Bowl victories.
Although sources say the new
coach is likely to come from
inside, even Iceland acknowledges
that Stanford's 30th head football
coach could be almost anyone.
"We are very uncertain for
coaches right now," Leland said
at a press conference Friday,
"but are open to look at anybody
as quickly as seems prudent."
Insiders say Cardinal defen
sive coordinator Willie Shaw
and offensive coordinator Ron
Turner are the two leading can
didates. Asst. Athletic Director
Tom Beckett said that informal
talks with the two have gone on,
but the official process will not
begin until this week.
