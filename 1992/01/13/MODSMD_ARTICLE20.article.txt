## Arnold Beichman Graveyard socialism of Western academia 
### 
An UNOFFICIAL global plebiscite,
underway for decades, has cli
maxed with an historic result:
Utter repudiation of Marxist socialism
and Marxism-Leninism by an almost
unanimous vote among hundreds and
hundreds of millions of people, victimized
for generations by these baneful doc
trines. In no sense has this global refer
endum been formally organized.
Marxism or its derivative, Marxism-
Leninism, has few friends anywhere. Who
in the USSR boasts about the joys of liv
ing under this doctrine? How many peo
ple in the anti-People's Republic of China
would disagree with Frederick Hayek's
memorably descriptive phrase, "the road
to serfdom" as describing their existence?
What is too little realized about the
meaning of this daily plebiscite is that it
has been a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic,
international phenomenon visible and
measurable among the peoples on every
continent regardless of race, religion,
color, language, or previous condition of
servitude.
Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Bud
dhists, Hindus, Muslims, Confucians,
believers and nonbelievers, industrial
workers, farmers and peasants, literates
and illiterates alike have voted to be left
alone by their governments.
Where, then, does "graveyard Marx
ism" or "scientific socialism" exist, its
managers oblivious to the global

plebiscite? In North Korea, Cuba, China,
Vietnam, dictatorships of blood and iron,
borders sealed by the Marxist-Leninist
chastity belt of electrified barbed wire.
Nowhere one looks is there a country
where people have by a free vote adopted
Marxist rule. Nowhere. Today, the last
remaining supporters of the Marxist
myth outside of the remaining reposito
ries of "graveyard socialism" are to be
found in American, British and West
German universities represented by the
coelacanth social science academics.
As Hayek once wrote, "The higher we
climb up the ladder of intelligence, the
more we talk with intellectuals, the more
likely we are to encounter socialist con
victions." As if to confirm Hayek, Walter
Laqueur recently said, "there are more
Marxists in our universities than in the
whole of the Soviet Union."
It is luminously clear, as men like
Hayek and Milton Friedman have been
saying for decades, that the enemy of
freedom is a centralized economy with
decision-making concentrated in the
hands of an unrepresentative, self-per
petuating, unelected minority.
The global vote against Marxism and
its heirs has occurred not only because of
the economic disasters which follow from
Marxist economic programming, but also
because in every case where Marxism
rules through a single party, imbedded
human rights are non-existent.

And yet there are still intellectuals,
particularly in the United States and
Britain, who — despite the evidence of
Marxist-Leninist catastrophe and car
nage before their very eyes — look upon
Marxism as salvation and redemption,
still engage in what has been called "irra
tionalist prophetism."
Professor Gertrude Himmelfarb has
pointed to Marx's major misprophecies
which alone should consign his teachings
to the dustbin of history. Marx, she
writes, predicted the pauperization of the
proletariat, the proletarianization of the
petty bourgeoisie, the collapse of capital
ism and worldwide revolution. And yet
these pass as valid? Doctrines are being
taught by social science faculties as eter
nal verity.
What would we say if the teachers of a
great university were to teach alchemy as
the New Chemistry, Lysenkoism as the
New Genetics and Ptolemaic astronomy
as the New Astrophysics? What should
we say to teachers who deplore the perva
siveness of "Western culture" Great
Books in college curricula?
To remain a Marxist today or Marxist
fellow traveler when the whole world has
voted against the malice of Marxism rais
es the most profound questions as to the
rationality of the true believer.
