day at Oregon.

Men's basketball

Cardinal 78

Ducks 57

Dukes drained three straight
three-pointers and Williams
added four of a career-high 22
points in a decisive 15-2 second
half run as Stanford clobbered
Oregon 78-57 at McArthur
Court.
With the victory the Cardinal
swept the Oregon schools for
only the third time in the past 25
years. Stanford, which beat Ore
gon State 67-64 Thursday, is 10-
1 overall, 2-0 and tied for first in
the Pacific 10 Conference.
The injury-weary Ducks,
playing without leading scorer
Jordy Lyden and starting center
Bob Fife, are 5-6, 1-1 in the Pac
-10.
Keefe was limited to 17
points, nine short of his season
average, but dominated the
paint with a career-high 22
rebounds.
"You have to get your enjoy
ment out of freeing up the out
side shooters, and the way to
look for points is off the outside
boards," Keefe said.
The collapsing Duck defense
left the perimeter open for
Dukes, Williams and point guard
Marcus Lollie, and they respond
ed with torrid outside shooting.
Stanford shot 57 percent

from the field and 5-for-8 from
three-point territory in the sec
ond half.
"I thought Adam played a real
good game overall," said Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery.
"The points weren't there, but
he kept his head in the game,
and obviously did a great job on
the boards. He passed the ball
well and didn't get selfish or
overly concerned about shooting
the ball."
Stanford played stingy
defense in the opening stanza to
take a 33-24 intermission lead,
but the Ducks excited the Mac
Court crowd by nailing six of
their first eight shots in the sec
ond half and drawing even 40-40
with 14:39 remaining.
"We didn't shoot the ball par
ticularly well early on, but we
were playing well," Montgomery
said.
"We were aggressive and were
doing basically what we wanted
to do defensively. We were get
ting good shots, but the ball
wasn't going down."
Lethal perimeter shooting
averted a repeat of 1991, when
the Cardinal led by 17 points in
the second half at Oregon, only
to lose in overtime.
Dukes, who was 2-for-8 in the
first half on three-pointers, sud
denly knocked down three in a
row and knocked the wind out of
the Ducks:
Stanford had been swept at
Oregon and Oregon State each
of the past two seasons.
In 1988-89 the Cardinal
swept the state on the way to a
26-7 record and a NCAA tourna
ment berth.

6, 0-2) Wednesday at 9 p.m. in a

Cardinal 78

Ducks 57

Dukes drained three straight
three-pointers and Williams
added four of a career-high 22
points in a decisive 15-2 second
half run as Stanford clobbered
Oregon 78-57 at McArthur
Court.
With the victory the Cardinal
swept the Oregon schools for
only the third time in the past 25
years. Stanford, which beat Ore
gon State 67-64 Thursday, is 10-
1 overall, 2-0 and tied for first in
the Pacific 10 Conference.
The injury-weary Ducks,
playing without leading scorer
Jordy Lyden and starting center
Bob Fife, are 5-6, 1-1 in the Pac
-10.
Keefe was limited to 17
points, nine short of his season
average, but dominated the
paint with a career-high 22
rebounds.
"You have to get your enjoy
ment out of freeing up the out
side shooters, and the way to
look for points is off the outside
boards," Keefe said.
The collapsing Duck defense
left the perimeter open for
Dukes, Williams and point guard
Marcus Lollie, and they respond
ed with torrid outside shooting.
Stanford shot 57 percent

from the field and 5-for-8 from
three-point territory in the sec
ond half.
"I thought Adam played a real
good game overall," said Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery.
"The points weren't there, but
he kept his head in the game,
and obviously did a great job on
the boards. He passed the ball
well and didn't get selfish or
overly concerned about shooting
the ball."
Stanford played stingy
defense in the opening stanza to
take a 33-24 intermission lead,
but the Ducks excited the Mac
Court crowd by nailing six of
their first eight shots in the sec
ond half and drawing even 40-40
with 14:39 remaining.
"We didn't shoot the ball par
ticularly well early on, but we
were playing well," Montgomery
said.
"We were aggressive and were
doing basically what we wanted
to do defensively. We were get
ting good shots, but the ball
wasn't going down."
Lethal perimeter shooting
averted a repeat of 1991, when
the Cardinal led by 17 points in
the second half at Oregon, only
to lose in overtime.
Dukes, who was 2-for-8 in the
first half on three-pointers, sud
denly knocked down three in a
row and knocked the wind out of
the Ducks:
Stanford had been swept at
Oregon and Oregon State each
of the past two seasons.
In 1988-89 the Cardinal
swept the state on the way to a
26-7 record and a NCAA tourna
ment berth.
Stanford hosts California (6-
6, 0-2) Wednesday at 9 p.m. in a
