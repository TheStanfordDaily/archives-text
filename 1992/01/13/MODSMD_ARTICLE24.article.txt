Bears 74

Cardinal 65

Missed. Rebound California.
Such were the fortunes of a Cardinal
team that never could get its act togeth
er against a not-to-be-denied Golden
Bear squad, as the Bears clawed the
Cardinal 74-65. Stanford, at No. 2 in
the country, became the highest ranked
team California has ever defeated.
The Bears executed their game plan
with perfection to accomplish the victo
ry. A team that usually prefers to run,
Cal slowed it down against Stanford.
The Bears shut down the Cardinal
perimeter attack using a quick three
guard lineup.
"Their perimeter defense was very
good," Stanford coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "They made us do things
we didn't want to d 0.... We were never
able to up the tempo; the game was

always at their pace."
When asked if one particular Cal
player hurt Stanford the most, Van-
Derveer replied, "Take a guess. What
game were you at?" She referred to Mil
ica Vukadinovic, the Bears' 6-foot-1
point guard who shredded the Cardinal
defense with six assists and 18 points,
including three treys.
VanDerveer, calling Vukadinovic a
"Magic Johnson" of the women's game,
said, "She gives Cal a different dimen
sion than anyone else in the country.
She makes everyone else [on Cal's
team] look better."
But she was not the only Bear to do
damage. Center Kesha Martin and for
ward Trisha Stafford combined for 36
points and 21 rebounds. Guard Jen
nifer Self hit three-pointers at crucial
moments in the game, stifling Cardinal
runs.
"Those three-pointers break your
back," Stanford center Val Whiting
said.
Meanwhile, every Cardinal player
seemed to have an off-night, including
Whiting, who scored a career-high 33
points — over half of Stanford's total.
Whiting grabbed only six rebounds and
shot below her season .508 percentage.
Goodenbour was the only other Cardi
nal to score in double figures, tallying
11 points.
"We were totally out of sync all
night," VanDerveer said.
The game began with a 6-0 Califor
nia run, but Stanford crawled back to a

six-point lead of its own at 27-21 with
6:15 left in the first half. By halftime
the momentum had swung the other
way again, with Cal leading 36-35 at
intermission.
Neither team looked particularly
sharp in the first half, but in the second
half, California put it together while
Stanford fell apart.
Whereas, in the first half the Bears
beat the Cardinal on the boards, for the
last 20 minutes they did it with defense
and efficient shooting. The Bears held
the Cardinal to a .263 field goal per
centage (including 0-for-3 on treys),
while shooting .652 themselves (includ
ing 4-for-5 on treys).
In contrast to the Tennessee game,
in which Stanford came back with
twelve points in the last three minutes,
the Cardinal was held scoreless during
the final three minutes against the
Bears.
"We are finally going to get some
respect," said Cal's All-America candi
date Stafford with a fiery look in her
eye. "For some reason Cal hasn't been
given the respect it deserves. Now peo
ple have to respect us."
VanDerveer hopes that now her
squad will have to respect other Pacific
10 Conference teams as well, especially
on their home courts. "This loss should
help us in the long run," she said. "I
hope it serves as a wake-up call."
