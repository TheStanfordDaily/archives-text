# Men spikers thrash Pacific, Sac State
## 
### Laurie Wackier Staff writer 
Senior Bob Hillman considered last
weekend's matchups against club
teams from Cal State-Sacramento and
Pacific "a good way to fine tune before
we play the top notch teams." But the
team's decisive victories in both
matches indicates that the Stanford
men's volleyball squad is definitely in
tune.
In its season opener Friday, the team
soundly thrashed UOP at Stockton, 15-
7, 15-9, 15-5. The squad continued its
wrath at Sacramento State on Satur
day, also beating the Hornets in three
games, 15-13, 15-3, 15-7.
"We should do really well against
these teams. That's what we expected,"
said coach Ruben Nieves of the con
tests. According to Nieves, the high
light of the weekend was the Cardinal's

opportunity to display its depth. The
matches featured two different starting
teams.
Hillman led the attack for the Cardi
nal on Friday, amassing 18 kills and a
.652 hitting percentage.
"My personal goal was to not make a
lot of errors," Hillman said. The 6-foot
swing hitter didn't leave much room for
errors.
As Nieves would attest, Hillman met
his goal. "When a player of Bob's cal
iber plays against a club team, he
should clearly dominate. He did that in
all aspects of the game, including serv
ing passing, defense, blocking, and

especially hitting."
Nieves was also pleased with the con
tribution of David Fischer. The 6-foot
-3 sophomore came off the bench in the
third game with a strong, all-around
performance.
Stanford faced a tougher opponent
in Sacramento State. Last year, the
Hornets won their conference, and Fin
ished third at Club Nationals. But they
weren't tough enough Saturday.
Seniors Dave Goss and Ryan Moos
teamed up to form a forbidding attack.
The duo hit .400 and .462 respectively
in the victory.
The volleyball team heads to Malibu
next weekend for the Pepperdine Tour
nament, where it will find plenty of
competition. The tournament features
varsity teams, including Pepperdine,
the No. 5 team in the nation. In an exhi
bition game earlier this year, Stanford
defeated the Waves.
