# Stanford fencers dominate grueling home tournament
## Card beats MIT, UC and Cal State squads 
### Larry Liu Staff writer 
The Stanford men's and women's fenc
ing teams started the new year on a positive
note by dominating this weekend's Stan
ford Collegiate Open at Roble Gym. While
the women dropped only one match, the
men went undefeated during the two-day
tournament.
Competition began Friday night with
both squads facing MIT. While the men
rolled to a 22-5 victory, the women lost 7-9
in a highly contested match.
On Saturday, both teams proved to be
unstoppable as they swept their remaining
matches. The men defeated UC-San Diego,
Cal State-Fullerton, UC-Santa Cruz, Cal
State-Long Beach, and MIT by a score of
22-5 in each face-off.
The women performed nearly as well,
beating the same schools by scores of 9-7
(UCSD), 14-2 (Fullerton), 12-4 (Santa
Cruz), 13-3 (Long Beach), and 10-6 (MIT).
The victory over MIT was especially sweet,
for it avenged the loss they had suffered the
night before.
Individually, three Cardinal fencers
went undefeated.
Captain Lana Kang turned in a perfect
performance in women's foil. Senior
Leonard D'Amico, the men's team captain,
went 16-0 in men's saber, and Olympic
hopeful Nick Bravin finished 18-0 in men's
foil.
In addition, freshmen Geoff Donaker
compiled an impressive 16-2 record in foil.
"Overall, we fenced really well," said
team manager Anthony Jones. "Though
Saturday was a long and exhausting day —

match in home tourney

'The Penn State tourna
ment will be much like
ours, except the teams

we fenced from 9:30 in the morning until
about 9:30 at night — we were able to stay
relaxed and controlled and turn out a
respectable outcome."
Jones believes that the grueling schedule
Saturday served as a good preparation for
the squads' next competition at State Col
lege, Pa.
"The Penn State tournament will be
much like ours, except the teams from the
East are much stronger and more estab
lished. [Our success) this weekend will help
give us the momentum to do well next
week."
The Cardinal men are led by fifth-year
coach Zoran Tulum, and the women are
headed by Sherry Posthumus, also in her
fifth year as head coach.
