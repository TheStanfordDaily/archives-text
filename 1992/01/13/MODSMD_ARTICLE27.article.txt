# Card gymnasts edged by Titans

### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
So, Coach Breck Greenwood, your Stanford
Cardinal women's gymnastics team has just suf
fered a close, yet encouraging, defeat in its open
ing meet and has some extra time in Southern
California. What are you going to do now?
"We're going to spend the day at Disneyland,"
was Greenwood's all-too-expected response when
interviewed yesterday.
Greenwood has several reasons to be happy
despite his 18th-ranked Card's 185.10-184.05 loss at
the hands of the 20th-ranked Cal State-Fullerton
Titans before 3000 spectators in Southern California.
"I think that we did a good job, that we per
formed well, and that we had great energy,"
Greenwood said.
The highlight of the meet came in the balance
beam, where the coach witnessed an "excellent
performance, one of the highest team scores I've
ever seen" compiled by three of Stanford's finest
athletes. Freshman Katie Clancy, who hails from
Phoenix, scored a 9.65, tying a school record.
Sophomore Kerrie Kelley, who established that
school mark a year ago, garnered a 9.60 while
sophomore Laurie West gave the Card a third
score of nine-and-a-half or over in earning a 9.50.
With its best vaulter, Meagan Lannin, sitting
the meet out with an injury, the Cardinal per
formed decently in that discipline, as sophomore

Kerri Kanuka led the way with a 9.65.
The floor exercise competition, according to
Greenwood, was "difficult, and we lost some
major points," yet he saw freshman Jene Elzie
from El Cerrito, Calif., come up big in her first
intercollegiate meet with a tally of 9.50.
In the all-around competition, sophomore Mol
lie Brown placed second overall with a total of
36.35 in the bars, beam, floor, and vault.
While Stanford did not come away from their
"SoCal swing" with a victory, Greenwood said
that his squad's 184.05 was "the highest score for
a first meet that we've put up in my three years
here. By the end of the season, we should be scor
ing 188 or 189, which is just about what you need
to compete nationally. We're going to be a great
team."
That expected greatness will be tested early, as
Stanford will have a chance to earn revenge
against Fullerton Friday at 7:30 p.m. at Burnham
Pavilion. And if the Card does come through for
Greenwood?
How about a trip to Great America?
