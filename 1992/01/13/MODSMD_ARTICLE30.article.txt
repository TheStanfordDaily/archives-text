# Self-defense workshops to meet surplus demand
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
Stanford women who have
been turned away from the popu
lar SWOPSI class "Issues in Self
Defense for Women" can now
learn similar techniques at one of
several self-defense workshops
being offered throughout the
quarter.
Tresidder Union will sponsor
20 three-hour weekend work
shops featuring physical self
defense technique training,
assertiveness training and discus
sions on sexual abuse and vio
lence.
Students, staff and faculty can
attend the workshops for $10,
while the general public will be
charged $15.
A total of 240 women will be
able to participate in the classes,
which should be encouraging to
the scores of women who get
turned away each quarter from
the self-defense class offered
through Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues.
Every quarter, as many as 60
women vie for 12 spots in each of
two or three sections. Some
women must try three times
before being accepted.
While the workshops are not
sponsored by the women's collec
tive that teaches the SWOPSI
classes, participants will learn
many of the same techniques and
attitudes, according to workshop
founder Susan Epstein, Stan
ford's student coordinator of sex
ual assault prevention education
and referral.
However, the workshops will
have "less of an emphasis on spe
cific techniques and more on phi
losophy," according to Epstein.
Senior Shira Wohlberg, one of
the instructors, said the workshops
will stress strategy, assertiveness
and mental preparation. She said
she also hopes to instill "pride in

yourself and the belief that you are
worthy of defending."
All 20 workshop instructors
have taken the SWOPSI self
defense class, Epstein said. All
but one are Stanford students,
though Epstein said she hopes
other women will want to teach
spring workshops.
Wohlberg said the SWOPSI
self-defense class, which she took
last year, "is one of the best class
es at Stanford. It was realistic in
that it shows you there is a lot of
abuse. Most people you know
have been abused at one point or
another."
Wohlberg said she looks for
ward to teaching others what she
has learned. Although the work
shops "aren't going to cover
everything, you're going to
become more aware," she said.
Epstein first thought of insti
tuting the workshops two years
ago after petitioning the Univer
sity to increase the number of
self-defense classes on campus.
In the process, she said she dis
covered the main obstacle was a
lack of instructors. The collective
that teaches the SWOPSI classes
accepts only a handful of new
members each year and requires a
year-long commitment from each,
which deters some women from
joining.
Epstein then suggested a series
of workshops similar to ones she
had given on campus and learned
she might be able to run them
through Tresidder, which spon
sors several classes each quarter
for Stanford students, staff and
faculty and the general public.
The workshops give more
women the chance to teach since
they only need to have taken the
SWOPSI class or a similar self
defense course.
Workshops will run each week
end from Jan. 25 through Mar. 1.
Tickets can be purchased at the
Tresidder ticket office.
