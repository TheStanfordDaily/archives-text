# All 'PINs,' no needles
## On-line access to records could shrink long lines at Old Union 
### Michael Cassell 
A new computer system that
allows students direct access to
their University records may soon
make long lines at the Registrar's
Office a thing of the past.
The new system, called Student
Access, is being piloted this quar
ter by a group of 507 students.
According to Elizabeth Hodge,
systems development analyst for
the Registrar's Office, participat
ing students can currently submit
and update their study lists, view
all of their courses and grades,
update their addresses, check
their transcripts and declare or
change their majors via computer.

"We hope that the new system
will take the University out of its
role as a middleman and signifi
cantly cut down on the lines at
Old Union," Hodge said.
If the pilot run proves success
ful, Hodge said the system will be
available to all students by spring
quarter. She also said the Univer
sity hopes to expand the access
options to include other adminis
trative offices, providing students
with on-line access to financial
aid, housing and University
account information.
Hodge said that every effort has
been taken to make the system as
secure and user-friendly as possible.
In the interest of securing pri

vacy, she said that students will be
given personal identification num
bers (PINs) to prevent others from
gaining access to th.nr records.
"The system works in the same
manner as the University's cur
rent administrative accounts and
should be extremely secure,"
Hodge said. "But students should
not share their PINs with others
and should take care to change
them often."
Hodge said that most of the feed
back that she has received from the
pilot group has been positive.
"In the long run, I think that
Student Access will be a much bet
ter system than the current one,"
said Gerardo Teran, a master's

student in political science and a
member of the pilot group. "My
only concern is that there are some
people on campus who are not very
familiar with computers and may
find the system confusing."
The system will be available
through Folio, and students will
be able to reach it through any on
or off-campus computer with
access to Folio from 7 a.m. to mid
night Monday through Friday
and 9 a.m. to midnight on week
ends and holidays.
Although Hodge admits the
University may have to shorten
the system's hours of operation in
order to keep costs down, she said
she hopes the pilot run will show
that the program can provide stu
dents with more convenient
access to their records.
This is especially important in
the wake of staff layoffs and
shorter office hours in the Regis
trar's Office as a result of the
University's budget deficit, she
said.
Hodge said her greatest con
cern about the new system is
that it might place strain on the
Forsythe mainframe and replace
long lines at Old Union with long
waits at terminals across cam
pus. However, she said the Uni
versity is installing a new com
puter over the Martin Luther
King holiday that should put an
end to the problem before it
starts.
The system was developed by a
team staffed by members of the
University's Network for Student
Information and the Office of the
Registrar.
