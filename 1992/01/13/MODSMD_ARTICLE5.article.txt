# 'Samaritans' hope to assuage Russian winter
## Responding to pleas for help, local doctors airlift medical supplies

Stanford Hospital lent the former Soviet
Union a hand last month, donating 20,000
pounds of medical supplies to the troubled
country.
Responding to former Soviet Foreign Min
ister Eduard Shevardnadze's urgent plea for
pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to help
his people survive this winter, the hospital
sent materials and equipment to three Soviet
hospitals.
Stanford Hospital provided a variety usable
items, from bandages and bedpans to syringes
and tubing. Redwood City physician William Lee
coordinated a joint U.S.-Soviet airlift of the
materials and accompanied them to hospitals in
Moscow, St. Petersburg and Omsk, a Siberian
city of 1.5 million people. All three cities are in
the Russian republic.
Last November Lee formed the group
Samaritan Friends "to help people in need
throughout the world." He subsequently met
an economic adviser to Russian President
Boris Yeltsin at the Hoover Institution, from
whom he learned that "their needs this winter

were enormous in medical supplies."
According to Materials Management Direc
tor Nick Gaich, three more airlifts are planned
this winter. Lee said the next one will be in
early February, and the majority of donations
will come from Bay Area hospitals and relief
organizations.
According to Lee, a doctors' revolt in Omsk
was narrowly avoided because the essential sup
plies arrived in time. He added that their requests
were modest considering their needs: The hospi
tal possessed no wheelchairs and requested only
two. The wheelchairs arrived Dec. 18, along with
intravenous tubing and other basic items.
Gaich and Director for Environmental and
Support Services Louis Saksen secured addi
tional donations from Bay Area medical equip
ment distributors and hospitals. Gaich said
they "are trying to enhance the Bay Area net
work of suppliers" to any country in need.
Other sponsors and organizers included the
San Francisco-based International Foreign
Policy Association, Project Hope, United Way
and the Russian Winter Campaign, which is
the umbrella organization coordinating the
airlift of materials to 15 hospitals in the for

mer Soviet Union.
Jim Garrison, executive director of the
International Foreign Policy Association, said
the Stanford airlift had three goals: halting
the spread of infectious diseases in the Soviet
Union, easing the transition from commu
nism to democracy this winter and stimulat
ing further local relief efforts.
The supplies from Stanford went to Omsk
Hospital, the All Soviet Union Hematology and
Oncology hospital in Moscow and the Institute
of Advanced Medical Studies in St. Petersburg.
Lee has also initiated a letter exchange
between Stanford Hospital President Bloem
and Rector Semvon Simbirtsev, the president
of the institute in St. Petersburg. According to
Lee, the two hope their hospitals can develop a
relationship where they assist each other. The
institute is a teaching hospital that gives
refresher courses to 20,000 doctors every year.
Lee said he will return to St. Petersburg in
April to set up a program between the hospital
and Merck & Co., a U.S. drug and equipment
manufacturer. The hospital will receive proto
type equipment and conduct trials with new
drugs from the company.
