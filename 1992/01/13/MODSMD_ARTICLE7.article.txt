Senior Carlos Lerner, a public policy major, has been named
one of 40 American Marshall Scholars.
Lerner, Stanford's 38th Marshall Scholar, will receive fees
and living expenses for up to three years of graduate study in
Britain.

Next month: putting the Cold War to rest
What to do with the military machine has been on the minds
and tongues of politicians nationwide since the Cold War's melt
down.
Now, Stanford is getting in on the act with "Redefining
National Security: Moving Beyond the Military," the theme of
this year's You Can Make a Difference conference Feb. 1.
On the agenda is the individual's role in understanding the
new generation of national security risks.
According to conference co-director Laurence Chang, "Since
World War 11, U.S. national security advisers have directed for
eign policy almost exclusively toward a single end: the contain
ment of communism."
He added, "The United States has a unique opportunity to
reshape national security policy to address more pressing threats
to the country, both international and domestic."
A panel discussion will feature television anchor Anna Chavez;
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice, President Bush's
former special assistant for national security affairs; Hoover
research fellow Joseph McNamara, former San Jose chief of
police; and Radiology Prof. Herbert Abrams, co-founder of Inter
national Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, an orga
nization that won the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize.
Experts will lead small group workshops on lobbying and
grassroots organizing, as well as working for change through the
media and through political office.
