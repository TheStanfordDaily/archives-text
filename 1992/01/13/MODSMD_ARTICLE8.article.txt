# Setting an example:
## Friends for Youth aim to be role models 
### Julia Sobrevilla Staff writer 
Leevonne Harris, 13, had been
missing school before he was
matched up with senior Jon
Hawkins as part of a local pro
gram called Friends for Youth.
But since he's had Hawkins as a
"senior friend," Leevonne has
stopped skipping school and is
even talking about a college career.
"I want to become a lawyer to
get my friends out of jail,"
Leevonne said.
Friends for Youth is a Redwood
City-based group that matches at
risk youths with "senior friends,"
who act as positive role models.
Thirty Stanford volunteers take
part in the program.
"I think senior friends can just
gain so much from it," Hawkins
said. "The sense you're helping
someone is just a great feeling."
The youths — called junior
friends — and students are
matched according to their prefer
ences and interests. "They try to
pair you up with someone you'll
have a good time with," said
junior Rip Waters, who is matched
up with 10-year-old Fred Lippins.
The idea is for the senior
friends to be people the youths
can spend time with, have fun
with and talk to, not an authority
like a teacher or a parent.
"I have mostly brought
[Leevonne] to school," Hawkins
said. "At dinner time, we play some
basketball. He loves sports, so I take

him to Stanford sports events."
Playing touch football, basket
ball or tennis are some of the
things that Hawkins and Waters
usually do with their junior
friends. Yesterday was the first
time Leevonne and Fred had
played tennis.
But Hawkins, a senior, said he
also tries to "encourage school
and the things I find important."
Cassandra Grady, a volunteer
coordinator for the organization,
said the program has been suc
cessful in making the junior
friends more interested in school.
"We've seen that it improves the
child's self-esteem and school
attendance," Grady said.
Youths who join the program
come from underprivileged back
grounds and have problems at
school, at home or socially.
Fred has a twin brother,
Cedric, who is also in the pro
gram. Cedric is Waters' official
junior friend, but since Fred is on
the waiting list for a partner,
Waters "shares" the brothers.
They "have been in the wrong
track, and Cedric and Fred know
that," Waters said.
"It's frustrating because the
kids have so many bad influences
around them," Hawkins said. "You
learn that there are these other
people in the community that
aren't nearly as well off as us."
Senior friends meet once a
week with counselors who help


Rip Waters, Fred Lippins, Leevonne Harris and Jon Hawkins take
five on the tennis court. Hawkins, a participant in the Friends for
Youth program, said, "I think senior friends can just gain so much
from it. The sense you're helping someone is just a great feeling."
