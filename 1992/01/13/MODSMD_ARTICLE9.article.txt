# Martin Luther King celebration begins
## Diversity, racial conflicts to be explored in 10-day series 
### Marie Save de Beaurecueil 
Stanford's 10-day celebration
of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birth
day kicked off last night with a
Black Church at Stanford service,
the first of 10 scheduled events
and presentations.
"Stanford students are about
as aware as (those) at any other
campus, but less aware than we
should feel comfortable with,"
said Rev. Floyd Thompkins, asso
ciate dean at Memorial Church
and a keynote speaker in this
week's events.
One of the principal objects of

the commemorative activities,
Thompkins said, is to create an
awareness in the Stanford com
munity of King's importance and
of how his message applies to con
temporary society.
According to Bacardi Jackson,
chair of the Black Student Union,
such awareness is vital to end the
prejudice and racism that come
from ignorance.
About 20 campus groups —
including the Black Church at Stan
ford, the Black Student Union, the
ASSU Speakers Bureau and cam
pus ministries — have been
involved in organizing the activities.

Both Thompkins and Jackson
said they have been impressed
with student support of the cele
bration. "With classes and cam
pus activities, it is often difficult
for students to raise their heads
and be aware," Thompkins said.
The activities will continue
tomorrow with a program — sched
uled for 4 p.m. in Tresidder's
Cypress Lounge — focusing on
diversity in the workplace. The pro
gram is sponsored by the Career
Planning and Placement Center.
Sharon Parker, director of the
Office for Multicultural Develop
ment, is the keynote speaker and

will address the topic "Affirmative
Action: Past, Present and Future."
The centerpiece of the 1992
celebration at Stanford will be a
program in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um — scheduled for Wednesday
at 7 p.m. — titled "Inspiration for
Troubled Times." Thompkins,
the featured speaker, will outline
his ideas on the difficulty of
adhering to our ideals during
these troubled times.
"It's easy to talk about dreams
and goals when things are going
well," he said, "but it is in times of
scarcity that these ideas and our
ability to carry them through are
tested."
Scholars and community lead
ers will also speak at the Wednes
day program. The other speakers
include Jackson; Oscar Rios, the
first Latino mayor of Watsonville,
Calif.; Althea Miller of the local
Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'i;
and Jim Larimore, assistant dean
of students.
Jackson said that in her speech

she will give a black student's per
spective of what King represents,
as well as of racial conflict at Stan
ford and in society as a whole.
She will show that these are
still troubled times, she added, for
as a black student, "you have to
create an environment for your
self and teach others about your
self, all while keeping up with aca
demics."
Wednesday night's festivities
will also include performances by
Talisman, Kuumba Dance Ensem
ble and the Stanford Gospel Choir.
Several religious services will
also be held as part of the com
memorative activities.
