THE ASSU NEWS
BUDGET CUTS
Big budget cuts are still coming. On January 17
proposals for exactly where each unit expects to cut
are due to the central administration.
Some groups have willingly subjected their propos
als to public screening. On January 9 the Vice Presi
dent for Student Resources sponsored an open forum
attended by over 100 students. From the large groups
expressing the need for pre-professional and transfer
advising to the graduate student who communicated
the strain that University proposals are putting on
graduate housing and life, students articulated their
concerns. Students also challenged proposed fees
and changes to Food Service in U-Ops.
Before the meeting on the 9th, plans for University
Food Service cuts were released. They have not been
widely published. They call for:
• 3.5% reduction in money spent for food ($125k)
• Only continental breakfast at Flo Mo ($66k)
• Closing Lag on the weekends ($89k)
• Closing Branner on Fridays ($40k)
• No weekend service at Kimball ($162k)
• Making students in Row U-Ops hash for free ($110k)
• Additional revenues fromsnack bars, etc. ($90k)
• Other administrative stuff ($229k)
Comments can be sent to Keith Guy, Director of
Housing and Food Services (ar.klg@forsythe).
The undergraduate financial aid proposals have
not been released as of press time. They are expected
out this week.
Humanities and Sciences released a partial plan to
The Daily last week. More detail is expected including
which departments are to be cut and which programs
eliminated. Hopefully, the University will encourage
open discussion of these plans when they are an
nounced.

( AN EDITORIAL J
Current budget reduction proposals for the Cowell
Student Health Center call for either a modest quar
terly fee on student bills or the elimination of specialty
referrals resulting inlarge out-of-pocket expenses and
insurance premiums. So, I support the modest fee,
right? Wrong! I don't support either plan.
This quarterly fee would not be needs tested. On
the other the increase in insurance would be
even more financially damaging to the 6500 students
who rely on Stanford's insurance. In short, these
proposals aren't budget reductions, but rather cost
transferrals.
This off-tuition fee threatens to start Stanford down
a slippery slope. Harvard collects $1100 in mandatory
fees each year. It would be convenient to slide things
off the budget whenever they grow uncomfortably
large. This, however, is not the answer.
Stanford must be honest in its budget cutting. It
should cut all it can, everywhere it can. If in the final
analysis Stanford needs to raise revenue, it should do
so fairly by raising tuition. This way, students who
need aid can receive it and TAs and RAs will have
these costs paid from their tuition remission, rather
than their scant stipends.

Student Groups:
Interested in presenting a program of your own?
Apply for cosponsorship funds and other resources
from the Speakers Bureau. Over $8000 is reserved for
such programs each quarter. The Speakers Bureau is
always happy to help organizations with planning
logistics and publicity.
This quarter's applications are available in the
ASSU Business Office and are due on Friday, January
17th. If you have any questions, please contact Ralph
Ermoian at 723-2880.
WHAT IS THE ASSU?
Stanford student government is composed of four
separate units: executive, legislative, administrative,
and financial.
This issue will highlight the administrative branch.
The Administrative Office runs under the direction
of Sophia Shing (725-1464), the administrative man
ager. Her staff includes a deputy administrative
manager, several assistants, and the heads of the
various service projects.
The administrative unit oversees the operation of
the ASSU offices and the service projects: SURE Es
corts, Nominations Commisssion, Program Board,
Publications Board, Speakers' Bureau, and the Elec
tions Commission.
The Program Board and Publications Board allocate
funding for student groups on a quarterly basis.
These Boards make reccomendations to the Senate
about how the special fee monies should be divided
among groups. The deadlines for this quarter were
Monday, January 13. If you have any questions
please contact Pat Bowlin (Program Board Director)
or Ruben Garcia (Pub Board Director) at the ASSU.
LEADERSHIP SUMMIT
Student leaders are coming together once again to
look at some of the problems facing this campus and
how to find creative solutions to those problems. The
Summit will take place in February at a location to be
announced soon.
The Council of Presidents will be soliciting applica
tions from students who would like to particpate as
at- large members. The COP will also be contacting
many organizations on campus for their ideas and
participants.
If you are interested in planning the Summit, come
to an organizational meeting on Wednesday, January
15 at 8 pm in Tresidder's Sequoia room.
FEE REFUNDS
Obviously, the new computerized fee refund system had some major glitches last quarter. Most checks
were finally mailed on January 2. So if you applied, you should have received yours by now. Sadly, some
requests -- including many made at Meyer and those made by students at Stanford-in-Washington last
Spring— may not have been correctly processed. If you did not receive a check or received one for an incorrect
amount, please visit the ASSU Business Office.
Since everything went wrong last quarter, the system will work perfectly this quarter. If you do nothing,
you will receive money back from the same groups you did last quarter. Winter quarter requests may be
changed or new requests may be made in the ASSU Business Office. The deadline is January 24.
SENATE VOTING RECORD
UNDERGRAD SENATORS
GRADUATE SENATORS
To Protect Students' Constitutional Rights
Bill XXII-AR-18
PASSED 12-8: 19 November 1991
Author: Douglas Bone, Graduate Senator
Co-Sponsors: Steve Apfelberg, Undergraduate Senator
Casey Lynch, Undergraduate Senator
Beth Morgan, Council of Presidents
James Vera, Graduate Senator
Action Requested: Approval, requires a simple majority,
Whereas Article IV, Section 2, paragraph 9 of the ASSU Constitution states that The accused person
shall have the right... to be considered innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and the
supremacy of this document over Stanford student judicial bodies was recognized by President Pitzei
on his 1969 Letters of Acceptance of the ASSU Constitution,
Whereas the Stanford Judicial Charter explicitly states in Section III, A, 1 that Amendments of these
articles ... shall go into effect when such proposals are approved by the Senate of the Associated Students, the
Academic Council, and the President of the University,
Whereas the Rhode Report of the Committee of Fifteen has formally called for supplanting the
present beyond a reasonable doubt standard with the clear and convincing evidence standard in
cases of student prosecutions under the honor Code or Fundamental Standard,
Whereas although the ASSU Senate is keenly aware of the problems associated with prosecuting
sexual assault cases with the Judicial Affairs Office, insufficient evidence has been advanced to
justify the Committee of Fifteen's recommendation to lower the burden of proof,
Whereas supplanting the beyond a reasonable doubt standard with a clear and convincing evidence
criterion might risk increased conviction of innocent people,
Whereas this standard will likely remain in force into the next millennium and we cannot predict the
course of the University-student relations confidently enough to allow substantial abnegation of our
hard-won rights,
THEREFORE BE IT ORDERED BY THE SENATE OF THE ASSOCIATION
That the proposed changes to the Stanford Legislative and Judicial Charter in sections F and L as
described herein are unconstitutional and unwarranted and are hereby rejected,
That if the changes rejected herein were to be implemented by the University in direct contravention
of Article III, Section A, 1 of the Stanford Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968 as amended, the
ASSU in accordance with its constitution will thereby cease recognition of the Stanford Judicial
Council and all other judicial bodies that follow the Stanford Legislative and Judicial Charter.
BACKGROUND: The relevant proposed changes to the Charter are as follows: (New text is under
lined. deletions are in bold)
F. Proceedings of the Hearing Officer
3. Conduct of proceedings before a Hearing Officer
c. Facts alleged in the formal charges must be established by the
charging party beyond a reasonable doubt bv clear and convincing
evidence.
L. Rights of the Person Charged
9. To be considered innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
by clear and convincing evidence.
The Committee of Fifteen is reconsidering its recommendations. If you have
comments or ideas about how to improve the judicial system at Stanford,
please contact the Council of Presidents.
