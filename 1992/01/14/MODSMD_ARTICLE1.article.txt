# Audits reveal Stanford not alone in boat

Stanford may be the only school with a 72-foot
yacht in its closet, but other schools do have their
share of skeletons.
A federal audit revealed that universities nation
wide inappropriately billed the government for
items such as a trip to the Grand Cayman Islands by
the University of Pittsburgh's president's wife.
In the wake of Stanford's indirect-cost contro
versy, the office of the inspector general at the
Department of Health and Human Services studied
a sample of 14 universities and found unallowable
costs totaling $20.3 million, according to Judy
Holtz, spokesperson for the office.
The questionable charges ranged from just
$8,913 at USC to $8.2 million at the University of
Michigan, Holtz said.
According to Holtz, some of the other inappro
priate charges found by the study include:
• Crystal decanters purchased from Neiman
Marcus by the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center at Dallas;
• French lessons for the president of the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh and Christmas cards and station
ary purchases for his wife; and
• Some expenses for a trip to the 1989 Rose Bowl
by officials at the University of Michigan — an unal
lowable expense that was previously reported.
The universities will probably not actually pay
the government back for all of the unallowable
charges, but will instead negotiate reduced future
reimbursements. Last May, Stanford wrote the gov
ernment a check for $929,517 as reimbursement for
inappropriate charges.
"Based upon this study, we are especially con
cerned about travel, both domestic and internation
al," Holtz said. "The reviews will continue."
The agency recently sent letters to more than
200 of its top universities asking for specific infor
mation in a further attempt to study the items
billed as indirect costs, Holtz said.
