# Audits reveal Stanford not alone in boat
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Stanford may be the only school with a 72-foot
yacht in its closet, but other schools do have their
share of skeletons.
A federal audit revealed that universities nation
wide inappropriately billed the government for
items such as a trip to the Grand Cayman Islands by
the University of Pittsburgh's president's wife.
In the wake of Stanford's indirect-cost contro
versy, the office of the inspector general at the
Department of Health and Human Services studied
a sample of 14 universities and found unallowable
costs totaling $20.3 million, according to Judy
Holtz, spokesperson for the office.
The questionable charges ranged from just
$8,913 at USC to $8.2 million at the University of
Michigan, Holtz said.
According to Holtz, some of the other inappro
priate charges found by the study include:
• Crystal decanters purchased from Neiman
Marcus by the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center at Dallas;
• French lessons for the president of the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh and Christmas cards and station
ary purchases for his wife; and
• Some expenses for a trip to the 1989 Rose Bowl
by officials at the University of Michigan — an unal
lowable expense that was previously reported.
The universities will probably not actually pay
the government back for all of the unallowable
charges, but will instead negotiate reduced future
reimbursements. Last May, Stanford wrote the gov
ernment a check for $929,517 as reimbursement for
inappropriate charges.
"Based upon this study, we are especially con
cerned about travel, both domestic and internation
al," Holtz said. "The reviews will continue."
The agency recently sent letters to more than
200 of its top universities asking for specific infor
mation in a further attempt to study the items
billed as indirect costs, Holtz said.
Stanford Assoc. Vice President
of Public Affairs Larry Horton
said that based upon the most
recent study, it is "fair to say that
in the general and administrative
costs pools (at most universities),
there were . . . some sensitive and
inappropriate costs."
Stanford and approximately 20
other schools negotiate with the
Office of Naval Research. The
Department of Health and
Human Services is responsible for
setting the indirect-cost rates
with most other universities.
Unlike the Navy, which had
not conducted a complete audit of
Stanford's books in 10 years,

Holtz said her agency has audited
their schools "on a routine and
continual basis" but that the pub
licity surrounding Stanford's sit
uation "prompted our attention
and surfaced the problem."
She added that "front-end
audits done while the two sides
are negotiating an indirect-cost
rate resolve problems prior to the
beginning of a fiscal year.
"But there are always going to
be problems in certain areas, and
the Office of Management and
Budget guidelines allow that to
be," Holtz said.
But Health and Human Services
does not plan to question the valid
ity of past indirect-cost recovery
rate contracts as the Navy is doing
at Stanford, according to Holtz.
A recent study by the Defense
Contract Audit Agency concluded

At most universi
ties, 'there were ...
some sensitive
and inappropriate
costs.'
— Larry Horton

that Stanford overcharged the
government by $230 million for
the period of fiscal years 1981 to
1988 assuming the invalidity of
the memoranda of understanding
— the contracts between the gov
ernment and Stanford establish
ing the reimbursement practices.
University qfficials have said
they believe the MOUs are valid
contracts, but they also acknowl

edge specific instances of inappro
priate billings, such as the depre
ciation of the yacht.
The most recent audit, in addi
tion to other studies done by the
audit agency and the General
Accounting Office, will be pre
sented at an indirect-cost hearing
scheduled for Jan. 30 in Washing
ton, D.C.
The House Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations,
chaired by Rep. John Dingell, D-
Mich., expects to hear testimony
from the various agencies regulat
ing indirect-cost reimbursement
for universities, as well as the
inspector general from Health
and Human Services Richard
Kusserow, according to congres
sional investigators.
No officials from any universi
ties have been asked to testify.
