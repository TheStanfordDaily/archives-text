# Cowell director to be selected
## 
### Kristina Aberg 
The search is on for a new director of Cowell's
Health Promotion Program.
Former Dean of Student Affairs Norman Robin
son is chairing the nine-member search committee,
which includes two students. The committee is in
the final stages of selecting a candidate and is
expected to make a recommendation next week to
Dr. Harvey Weinstein, director of Cowell Student
Health Center, who will make the final decision.
The tasks facing the new director include restruc
turing the program to accommodate recent budget
cuts and coordinating its existing projects.
The Health Promotion Program serves Stanford
students through a variety of projects, including aer
obics classes; Project RISC, an alcohol awareness
program; a sexual assault prevention program; HIV
awareness and prevention; CPR training; and nutri
tion counseling.
Many of the programs — such as the sexual
assault prevention program — are student-run.
"We see people before they get sick and try to
move them to a higher state of wellness," said Elise
Lenox, acting director of the program. "We try to
increase community awareness and changes in
behavior by going to the dorms and educating the
students."

The four finalists for the position are Carol
Pertofsky, Darryl Burnett, Kathleen Roach and
Karen Calfas. All have had experience working with
students and health promotion.
Pertofsky, who is from the Bay Area, currently
acts as a consortium coordinator for Healthy Kids,
Healthy California, a school-based health program.
She was the health promotion director for a local
hospital and an Army hospital, and has also taught
programs for exceptional children in the Oakland
School District.
Darryl Burnett is a health educator at the Uni
versity of Maryland in Baltimore County. He also
does work for Planned Parenthood and is involved
with volunteer work dealing with AIDS and rape.
Kathleen Roach is the Director of Health Promo
tion at the University of Wisconsin. She has previ
ously worked with the California Chapter of the
Arthritis Foundation and has served as a Health
Promotion specialist for a private firm.
Karen Calfas is a psychologist at the health pro
motion Service at San Diego State University and
was a psychology intern at Brown University.
The program's previous director, Pat Fabiano,
resigned in August to accept a position as coordina
tor of the Wellness Program at Western Washington
