# Captors set to return lost dorm pooch
## 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
Soto, the cement dog that for
years stood as faithful mascot to
the Wilbur Hall dorm that shares
his name, will return from his
three-and-a-half-month sabbati
cal tomorrow, according to his
captors.
Six of the captors, who chose
to appear in ski hats and fake,
Minkmanesque schnozzes, said
the canine statue will be sent "in
style" to the Soto Resident Fel
low cottage at 3:30 p.m.
The cement dog, namesake of
Leland Stanford Jr.'s childhood
pet that once saved the young
boy's life, was taken from the
Soto lounge at about 4 a.m. Sun
day, Sept. 29, according to the
abductors.
His disguised captors said
they were among 15 Stanford
students involved in Soto's
adventures since his departure
from the dorm lounge, where he
had been chained to a staircase.
Claiming to be brothers, each
going by the name of Daryl, the
captors said they took the
cement dog to San Francisco,
Los Angeles and a local sports
bar, where it enjoyed watching
Big Game.
"Soto couldn't go to the game
himself, though he wanted to,"
said the tallest Daryl. "It's the
price of fame."
Over winter break, the
cement dog traveled to Los
Angeles, where he rode on a
roller-coaster at Magic Moun
tain, said the ski-masked Daryl.
Besides his many trips, the
cement dog has spent most of his
time in one of the Daryls' par
ent's homes on the Peninsula,
where Daryl said it lived much

more luxuriously than it had in
the dorm lounge.
The only damage done to the
cement dog was the loss of the
tip of the statue's nose, which
was smoothed out in L.A. by a
"plastic surgeon," according to
the deep-voiced Daryl.
The brothers said they were
surprised by both the attention
and the wild speculation that
Soto's adventures have elicited.
They said they did not get
involved with the cement dog for
the sake of getting attention.
"They're way off. There's
nothing really exotic about har
boring a 150-pound statue," said

the bulky Daryl.
However, the brothers Daryl
said they were happy with the
publicity the cement dog has
received in The Daily and the
San Jose Mercury News.
"I thought The Daily's arti
cles were a lot better written
than the Merc ones," yipped the
scruffy Daryl.
The brothers Daryl said they
would like Soto to get a proper
homecoming upon his return
tomorrow. Top on the list of pri
orities is a "Soto's Back" dorm
party to be held as soon as possi
ble, they said. The brothers also
expressed concern that the dog

would be returned to his unfed,
fettered state of being chained to
the staircase.
The brothers Daryl said they
hope Soto residents will treat
the statue with more respect in
the future.
"It's a universal message you
can take away from this whole
thing," said the tall Daryl. "Take
better care of your cement dogs."
None of the brothers said
they knew anything about the
500-pound, $25,000 statue of
the Greek god Bacchus, which
was stolen from Crothers Hall
last year.
