Freshman writers need
English lecturers, not
busy graduate students

The university has
moved dangerously close to
turning the Freshman
English curriculum into a service
industry of financial convenience.
A School of Humanities and Sci
ences proposal to eliminate certain
Freshman English lecturers and
replace them with graduate stu
dents would be disastrous.
Stanford places much emphasis
on ensuring that all its graduates
are, at minimum, competent writers.
Currently, every student enter
ing the University must take a
core Freshman English course for
at least one quarter. Weekly papers
in Freshman English are the
norm. For many students this is
their first exposure to any serious
level of writing.
This is supposed to give stu
dents a solid foundation in writing.
While this may be a bold claim, it is
a vital one. Freshman English is
one of the most fundamentally
important courses at this universi
ty. Every student at Stanford, male
or female, scientist or artist, uses
the skill of writing on a daily basis.
The budget-cutting proposal is
designed as part of the $5 million
school-wide cuts which Humanities
and Sciences must come up with by
Jan. 17. However, Freshman
English has already been whittled
away with $75,000 in cuts last fall.
The proposal would use money
now paid to lecturers as desperate
ly needed funding for graduate
students. In return, the recipients
would have to teach a Freshman
English course. Some of the new
teachers, besides being inexperi
enced, would come from depart
ments outside of English.
A political science doctoral stu
dent specializing in labor economics
could wind up being responsible for
teaching 30 novice writers the diffi

cult skills of composition.
Clearly, something is wrong
with this idea. The University
must not undermine the one
course that takes the time and
effort to walk freshmen through
the complicated — and sometimes
agonizing — process of writing.
Understandably, given the Uni
versity's fiscal woes, all things
must be considered. Nothing
should be sacred. Nor should the
cuts be careless either.
Freshman English is not a
world-renowned department; none
of the lecturers is a Nobel laureate.
But they are competent profes
sionals who have devoted their
lives to teaching others how to
write. Replacing them with
already overworked graduate stu
dents would destroy the program's
integrity and only hurt those it
was designed to help — students.
If cuts must be made and lectur
ers let go, then rather than replac
ing them with reluctant graduate
students, the program should be
cut back. Any student with a
demonstrated writing ability
should be allowed to exempt out of
Freshman English.
A score of five on either of the
Advance Placement English tests —
Composition or Literature — should
be a good indication of who should
qualify for exemption. A score of
four should place incoming students
into the one-quarter section.
This would ensure that medi
ocrity is not spread throughout all
Freshman English courses. The
best lecturers would be preserved
to continue what they are good at
doing — teaching students how to
write competently and cogently.
If the University decides that it
cannot justify the expense of main
taining a strong Freshman
English curriculum, then it should
abolish it all together, not water it
down to insignificance.
Compelling all incoming stu
dents to take an intensive writing
course taught by a mediocre teach
er would be a waste of everyone's
time. Freshman English should be
freed from the cutting block.
