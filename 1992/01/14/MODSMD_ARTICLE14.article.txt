## The
						Balancing Act 
### 
1 REMEMBER IT LIKE YESTERDAY.
I was sitting in the computer cluster,
typing away, when all of a sudden the
fire alarm went off. It's a pretty annoying
siren, so it got my attention. As I finished
typing my sentence, I looked up, expecting
to see smoke and fire rising to the heavens.
Of course, there wasn't any. But when
I looked around me, the rest of the people
in the room, not to my surprise, were still
busy typing diligently away. Not a stir. It
never occurred to them that it might be
worth interrupting their work for 10 pre
cious seconds to investigate whether
their lives were in danger.
They didn't realize that, although there
wasn't a fire, their lives were already in
danger — in danger of slipping away from
them, without them ever having felt like
they really lived or did anything they felt
was rewarding or worthwhile.
This is not a Carpe Diem sermon, nor
do I fashion myself a philosopher or a
hypocrite. So I will admit that I too spent
more than my share of college hours wor
rying about grades and assignments that
I can't even remember anymore.
But now that my official academic
career has ended at Stanford, I can safely
step back and reflect a bit.
The first thing I realize is that I'm not
alone. Regrets over having spent too
much time on things I did not particular
ly value simply because I thought they
were the "right" things to do are surely

shared by others here.
And the struggle between spending
time doing fun things and spending time
on academics continues, although
progress has been made. I've begun to
realize that absolute sacrifice for the
future is flawed in the manner that many
Stanford students apply it to their lives.
Obviously all of us have made sacri
fices in order to succeed — there's no
problem there. Some sacrifices have to be
made to ensure that we achieve and
secure for ourselves the future we desire.
Hedonism isn't the answer.
But the premise that underlies the
typical Stanford mindset is that if we
know where we want to get and if we
know how to get there, then it's worth
making sacrifices now in order to succeed
down the road. It's got a few problems for
students, to say the least.
For starters, who really knows exactly
where they want to end up in 10 years?
Who would really want to know? Every
experience in our lives shapes our inter
ests and aspirations, so most likely we will
not end up where we now think we will
later want to be. Ask any adult you know,
and I'll bet nine out of 10 will tell you they
didn't envision themselves where they are
today when they were younger.
And say we did know exactly where we
wanted to be in 10 years. Who knows how
to get there? Aside from a few rare cases,
there are usually many different paths

leading to the same destination. Most
likely, if we do the things that we enjoy
and are interested in, we will end up at
the most logical place in the end because
there will be other people there who have
interests similar to ours.
Now say that we knew not only where
we wanted to be, but also how to get
there. Even so, is it worth the sacrifice in
the meantime? Is such absolute sacrifice
even necessary to get what we want?
Here's where things get a bit grayer.
Since we don't have an equation for it all,
each of us must discover our own unique
equilibrium between making sacrifices
for the future and gratifying our present
desires.
This, then, is my metaphor for life —
one huge balancing act, in which each of
us must define for ourselves where we
want to draw the line. Inevitably we will
regret certain decisions that we feel were
excessive in either direction, but in the
end it is only by learning from our own
individual mistakes that we can each
achieve the happiest balance for our
selves. When we stop trying to balance is
when we lose.
