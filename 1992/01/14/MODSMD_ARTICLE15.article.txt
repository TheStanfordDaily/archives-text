£ "D ORIS ' GIVE US BREAD! " reads
title of an article in the
J—J Moscow weekly magazine
Ogonek. Russian President Yeltsin
assured Russians that they would not
starve this winter.
At the same time, former Soviet Pres
ident Mikhail Gorbachev had been press
ing the West for billions of dollars to
prevent famine. Indeed, the U.S. Air
Force flew in 75 tons of excess military
rations from the Gulf War, adding to 18
million tons of regular American food
sent by ship last year. The European
Community is providing $240 million
worth of food over the next two months.
The facts suggest that Yeltsin is cor
rect, although delivery of Western food
to Russia this winter may deprive him of
an opportunity to destroy a particularly
dangerous part of the former Soviet
infrastructure.
Over the last 11 months, Germany,
the United States and the European
Community have provided almost $8 bil
lion in food credits; six other countries
gave $2 billion more. Ivan Silayev, then
chairman of the Interrepublic Economic

Committee, announced that those funds
would buy some 50 million metric tons
(mmt) of grain from the West.
In addition, the central government
purchased 42 to 43 mmt of domestic
grain during 1991. The latter amounts
to approximately eight or nine mmt
above annual consumption by the popu
lation in all 15 republics of the former
Soviet Union.
There are even more compelling rea
sons to believe that Russia may be over
flowing with grain. Recent estimates
suggest that the "granaries of the moth
erland" could hold in reserve up to a full
year's average harvest of grain.
Accumulated stock, periodically
renewed, comprises the Strategic Grain
Reserves. Most of it has come from
Western imports over the past 20 years.
A large part is stored in underground
shelters designed to withstand full
nuclear blast and fallout. It has been
asserted that these supplies could feed
the entire population of the former Sovi
et Union for three years. This estimate
may actually be low.
Then there are special military-relat-

Ed peacetime stocks. Silayev revealed the
existence of a Centralized Food Fund.
Last year, almost 14 mmt of grain were
added to the Fund for the armed forces,
Moscow and the so-called closed cities,
where nuclear weapons and their compo
nents were manufactured.
According to the most recent Soviet
Military Encyclopedia, state reserves •
include — apart from food — fuel,
material, capital equipment, spare parts
and other supplies maintained to mobi
lize for, fight and recover from a war.
Vitaly Shlykov, the deputy chairman
of the Russian Defense Council, said
that if all material was transferred from
such state reserves to defense plants,
industrial production would increase by
50 percent. This could mean that these
stockpiles totaled more than 200 billion
rubles, or one-fourth of last year's gross
national product.
Did Gorbachev know about these vast
"expenditures"? Such huge reserves
would have permitted the Red Army to
fight 90 days in Western Europe or 180
days in China, according to senior
defense analyst William Lee. As com-

mander-in-chief, Gorbachev certainly
had this information. The more impor
tant question now is whether Yeltsin has
access to these stockpiles.
The existence of these stocks may be
the reason why Yeltsin seems so certain
that the Russians will not starve — pro
vided that grain can be taken away from
the military-industrial complex. He
attempted to convince the former
Supreme Soviet that this should be done
and failed more than a year ago. Yeltsin
will find it easier to open these granaries
and thereby demolish a vital part of the
war machine, if the grain actually is
needed.
Should the West continue to send
food, it will only help the Red Army mili
tary threat to survive the death of the
Soviet Union. The foregoing ought to be
considered by American and West Euro
pean diplomats when they meet in
Washington on Jan. 22, at a conference
for coordination of aid to the former
Soviet republics.

such state reserves to defense plants,
industrial production would increase by
50 percent. This could mean that these
stockpiles totaled more than 200 billion
rubles, or one-fourth of last year's gross
national product.
Did Gorbachev know about these vast
"expenditures"? Such huge reserves
would have permitted the Red Army to
fight 90 days in Western Europe or 180
days in China, according to senior
defense analyst William Lee. As com-

mander-in-chief, Gorbachev certainly
had this information. The more impor
tant question now is whether Yeltsin has
access to these stockpiles.
The existence of these stocks may be
the reason why Yeltsin seems so certain
that the Russians will not starve — pro
vided that grain can be taken away from
the military-industrial complex. He
attempted to convince the former
Supreme Soviet that this should be done
and failed more than a year ago. Yeltsin
will find it easier to open these granaries
and thereby demolish a vital part of the
war machine, if the grain actually is
needed.
Should the West continue to send
food, it will only help the Red Army mili
tary threat to survive the death of the
Soviet Union. The foregoing ought to be
considered by American and West Euro
pean diplomats when they meet in
Washington on Jan. 22, at a conference
for coordination of aid to the former
Soviet republics.
