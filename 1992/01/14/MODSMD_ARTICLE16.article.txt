Modernization needed
for Stanford's unfair
dorm housing policies
Let's abolish sexual intercourse as the
basis of Stanford's residential policy.
Married students' housing was an out
growth of the G.I. Bill after World War
11, when unprecedented numbers of men
with ready-made dependent families
enrolled in college.
Veterans' educational benefits no
longer support the veteran, let alone his

or her family, and the assumption
underlying discrimination in favor of
"families" — that all jobs of higher
than-subsistence level would go to men
— is no more.
It's no longer fair, if it ever was, to
make single students pay more to get an
education so that couples can double
dip: combine the income from two free
standing jobs with the benefits predicat
ed on the assumption that one spouse is
prevented from earning because she is a
full-time mother.
Why can't couples , if they want uni
versity housing, have a room like any
other two students who draw together,

and not involve the University in their
sex life at all?
If the University made the subsidized
apartments available to members of the
Stanford family — junior faculty,
researchers, nurses, gardeners, students
— who have dependent children, the dif
ference between the subsidy and the
market rate of the housing might equal
an across-the-board salary cut of 20 per
cent, far preferable to cutting staff posi
tions by 20 percent. Students might take
on foster children — there are plenty in
need of homes — as their public-service
project.
The graduate students would rather

be given kitchens than be subject to the
University's dictatorial food policy —
who wouldn't? But that may inspire
much-needed reform.
