### Amy Wusterbarth Editorial Staff 
Mission accomplished. The
men's tennis team hoped to use
the National Collegiate Tennis
Classic in Palm Springs to deter
mine how they stack up against
other schools. That is exactly
what they did last weekend.
"We wanted this tournament
to give us an indication of where
we are and it did just that," said
head coach Dick Gould.
"At this point USC and
UCLA are clearly the top two
teams in the nation but that
doesn't mean that we can't get
better. We will get better."
The No. 3 Cardinal made a
formidable showing down in the
desert. Alex O'Brien handled his
first two rounds in a masterly
fashion before falling in the quar
terfinals to Louisiana State's
Tamer el Sawy 7-6, 5-7, 6-4. El
Sawy, the tournament's fifth
seed, is a member of the Egyptian
Davis Cup team.
"Alex did an outstanding job.
He competed well and adapted

his game to his opponents,"
Gould said.
Another player who showed
great improvement was sopho
more Robert Devens. Devens
defeated the seventh-seeded
Mario Pacheco in the first round
3-6, 6-0, 7-5.
Pacheco went on to win the
consolation round while Devens
fell in the second round to the
Bruins' Robert Janecek 6-1, 6-3.
Sophomore Chris Cocotos and
junior Jason Yee lost tough first
round matches 7-5, 7-5 and 6-1,
6-0, respectively.
"Those two had a real up and
down time in singles. They both
needed matches really badly,"
Gould said. The twosome lost in
the semifinals of the consolation
round.
In doubles, however, Cocotos
fared much better. Cocotos and
first-time partner O'Brien, seed
ed fourth, trounced a Pepperdine
duo 6-4, 6-1 in the opening
round.
After their UCLA opponents
defaulted in the quarterfinals,
the Cardinal team lost to

Jonathan Leach and Brian Mac-
Phie, a powerful USC pair, 3-6, 6-
2, 6-2.
"They reached the semifinals
and had three close sets. Chris
did a great job," Gould said. "Alex
is one of the premier doubles
players in the nation. He keeps
improving every day."
Devens and Yee also paired up
for doubles. Considering they
had never played together before,
they did well.
"I was pleasantly pleased with
their doubles play," Gould said.
They won in three sets, defeating
a Waves duo, before slipping to
No. 2-seeded Andres Lanyi and
David Ekerot of USC 6-2, 6-4.
"Overall I was very pleased.
We had a good, solid match all
around," Gould said.
