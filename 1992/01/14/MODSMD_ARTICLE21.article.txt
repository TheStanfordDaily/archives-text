# Total domination marks Card's performance at Aggie Open
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Total domination, an excellent and
objective way to describe the fortune of
Stanford's wrestling team in the Aggie
Open last Saturday at UC-Davis, for of
the 10 weight classes in the tournament,
the Cardinal wrestlers placed first in
seven.
"We wrestled really well," said coach
Chris Horpel. "The competition was
lighter than expected, but it was great
that we dominated like we did."
And this domination came with
injuries to three of Stanford's usual con
tributing starters. At 118 pounds, junior
Phil Nowick was out with a shoulder
injury. However, redshirting freshman
Matt Cano filled his vacancy ably, taking
first in the weight class.

pounds would have been an all-Stanford
affair, pitting Cardinal regular junior
Dave Nowick against redshirting sopho
more Ramy Saad. Unfortunately, Nowick
hurt his knee, yielding an injury default
win for Saad. However, Saad's just getting
to the title match is impressive, especially
when considering that he normally wres
tles at 118. Redshirting freshman Tod
Surmon also contributed with a fourth
place finish in the same weight class.
Perhaps the most outstanding perfor
mance of the meet was by sophomore Jay
Jackson, who won the 134 pound division
— beating a Division II All-American

along the way. Jackson also bested Stan
ford redshirting freshman Jimmy
Aguirre — a three-time California state
champ in high school — in the champi
onship match. Redshirting sophomore
Jesse Lindow added a fourth place finish
in the division.
At 142 pounds, the Cardinal was with
out one of its best wrestlers in sophomore
Lance Johnson, who is currently out with a
shoulder injury. Substitute freshman Eric
Lister failed to place in the tournament.
"He isn't quite there yet," Horpel said.
In another show of Stanford's depth,
redshirting junior Dave Sacks won the
150 pound class, while the Cardinal's vet
eran in this division — junior Jeremy
Friedman — placed fourth.

At 167 pounds, senior Matt Topham
turned in another of what are beginning
to seem like routine wins. "[He] looked
impressive," Horpel said.
Senior Mark Graham had a big win in
taking first in the 190 pound class. In the
championship bout, Graham clobbered
his opponent, Don Zeman. What makes
this victory so great is that Zeman, for
merly of UC-Davis, was a two-time Divi
sion II All-American, and Graham
defeated him by a final score of 15-2.
In the heavyweight class, Stanford

assistant coach Erik Duus — who usual
ly wrestles at 198 pounds — took first
place, defeating bigger and possibly
stronger wrestlers by virtue of superior
technique and skill.
"Although the competition wasn't up
to the Division I Pac-10 level, we were
really able to shine. And it was great for
us to be able to check on our skills," Hor
pel said.
In all, 12 Stanford wrestlers placed,
including six redshirts — and of these six,
three took first place honors.
The main concern of the wrestling team
at the moment, beyond the obvious holes
at 177 pounds and heavyweight, is to get
the team healthy. The No wicks and John
