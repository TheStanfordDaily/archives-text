Can they be stopped?
The women's swimmers have continued
the dominance they have shown all season
long this weekend on a successful trip to
southern California, as USC and UCLA
became the Cardinal's latest victims.
Although the team fell short of their own
lofty standards in crushing UCLA 175-84 on
Friday, Stanford came back with an excep
tionally solid performance in their 183-108
demolition of No. 10 USC.
"We didn't swim as well as we could have
against UCLA," said freshman Jenny
Thompson, who established her best
unshaved times in the 50 and 200 freestyle
against Southern Cal with a 25.91 and
2:02.60 respectively. "We all did much better
on Saturday, against USC. Everyone
improved their times the second day."

The UCLA contest was the first in over
six weeks for Stanford, who last competed in
the University of Texas Invitational in late
November. The victory pushed the Cardi
nal's record to 4-0 in dual meets this season.
The team's other two victories came over the
Gauchos of Santa Barbara and the Texas
Longhorns in the season opener.
As the Cardinal swimmers score rout

after rout in dual-meet play, it becomes
increasingly apparent that Stanford will be
the team to beat when the NCAA Champi
onships begin in March.
Stanford did not lose a single race against
USC, with Thompson and Summer Sanders
each winning three individual events, and
Lea Loveless and Lori Heisick emerging vic
torious in two events each.
Against a more competitive USC team,
the Cardinal turned its intensity up a notch
with victories in all of the individual swim
ming events. However, USC managed to eke
out victories in the 1-meter diving event as
well as the 400-meter individual medley and
the 400 freestyle relay. Thompson again won
three events with wins in the 50, 100, and
200 free, and Loveless and Heisick repeated
their winning efforts in the 100 and 200
backstroke and the 100 and 200 breast
stroke, lowering their times substantially in
the process.
