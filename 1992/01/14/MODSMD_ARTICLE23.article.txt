# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Whether young or old, Stanford athletes
continue to accomplish amazing feats at
every stage of their Cardinal careers. This
week marked the beginning of freshman
swimmer Jenny Thompson's potentially
huge college career, while senior (athletic
junior) Nick Bravin's performance this
weekend was just one more entry on his
lengthy and impressive resume of fencing
feats.

Thompson had "just an incredible meet at
USC," according to head coach Richard Quick.
The freshman sensation won the 200 meter
free in 2:02.60, two seconds ahead of Stan
ford's top-notch Janel Jorgensen. Then, four
events later, Thompson won the 50-meter free
in a lightning-quick 25.91. This time was only
.41 seconds off the American record.
"That was an incredible time in midsea
son," Quick said. "She had excellent times."
She went on to win the 100-meter free
with another unusually fast time and then to
anchor the Cardinal's first-place 400-meter
free relay.
The day before, at UCLA, Thompson had
multiple victories in the 200 and 50-meter
free and the 100-meter fly.
"I definitely expected this type of perfor
mance from Jenny," Quick said. "She's a
great athlete."
❖
Another great athlete is perennial fencing
star, Nick Bravin. This weekend at the Stan
ford Collegiate Open, he demolished all his
opponents in foil and tallied a final score of
18-0. The Cardinal men's team swept this
season-opening tournament.
Bravin, a Los Angeles native, was the
NCAA Champion in foil two years ago and
also led the team to a Western Regional title.
He stopped out last year to train for the
Olympics, according to team manager
Anthony Jones. This venture seems to be
paying off, as Bravin needs only to perform
well in two of his next three big tournaments

to garner an official invitation from the U.S.
Olympic team. Jones believes he has an
excellent chance.
In addition to collegiate level fencing,
Bravin competes on both the national and
international circuit. He participated in the
Pan American Games where he captured
third in individual foil — the team's lone
medal. His performance did, however, help
the American team capture a silver medal.
