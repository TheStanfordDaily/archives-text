# Poruri, Card sizzle on court in desert's heat
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Editorial staff 
Laxmi Poruri clinched the sin
gles title at the National College
Tennis Classic with a 6-0, 6-3 vic
tory over UCLA's Mamie Ceniza,
but she may have won the tour
nament in the quarterfinals.
In that match, Poruri faced
Arizona State's Krista Amend.
The Cardinal sophomore was
expected to win — and she was
up a set — but she was not play
ing the way she wanted to.
"I was tentative, up and
down. I was aggressive at times
but not often enough," Poruri
said.
Women's tennis coach Frank
Brennan was also concerned, and
talked to her at 2-1 in the second
set.
"She was playing chicken. I
told her that I'd rather she lose
and play the way she's capable of
playing than (win) playing defen
sively," Brennan said. "I told her
that (her play) was embarrassing
and to do something she's proud
of."
Poruri was just as blunt. "He
told me to hit the damn ball —
and I did until the end of the
tournament."
"She hit the ball 20 percent
harder (in the second set) and
she killed the girl," Brennan
said. Poruri cruised to a 7-5, 6-1
win.
With Poruri on a roll, her next
opponent — teammate Heather
Willens — met a similar fate. The
Cardinal junior lost a grueling
three-setter 6-2, 2-6, 6-2.
"With three matches a day —
in the heat and with little rest in
between matches — we were
both tired," Poruri said.
"Heather was a little more wind
ed than I was and I moved her
around, which made her more
tired."
Although Poruri and Willens
duelled across the net in singles,
they combined their efforts in
doubles. They reached the semi
finals before succumbing to the
Bruin tandem of Ceniza and
Iwalani McCalla 7-6, 6-4.
"I was not surprised at all
(with their success)," Brennan
said. "They have been a good
team ever since we put them
together."
However, the Cardinal coach
was a bit surprised by the results

of freshman Kim Shasby and
sophomore transfer Kristine
Kurth. They also made the semi
finals before getting trounced by
Arizona's Danielle Scott and
Banni Redhair 6-1, 6-3.
"They haven't quite clicked,"
Brennan said. "They finally
started to, and it was wonderful.
They looked a little flat later, but
now we know they can do it."
Despite falling in the early
rounds, Shasby and Kurth
showed sparks of improvement
in singles.
"Kristine played a few good
matches. She is working with a
new racquet so she hasn't hit on
all eight cylinders yet," Brennan
said.
"Kim has shown streaks of
brilliance, but she needs to focus
more in between matches. She
has a tendency to drift around."
Poruri, however, was the dom
inant player in the competition.
She adds this title to her victory
in the Rolex Regionals to create
an impressive portfolio thus far.
"The last three years my con
fidence took a dive. Last year I
switched from a two-handed
backhand to a one-handed and I
was getting beat by people I
shouldn't have lost to," she
said.
"Now, I'm not scared to lose
and I'm not afraid of criticism. I
take it a lot better than I used
to."
A change of attitude has also
helped Poruri improve her game.
"I'm concentrating on progress
ing as a player and, if I do that,
the results will come.
"I like the results but I'm even
more happy that I stuck with
[the one-handed backhand.] It
makes me more versatile and
harder to read," Poruri said.
"It is still my weakness but I
think [the switch] will prove to
be to my advantage. The one
handed backhand is fun because
I can be more creative with it."

more happy that I stuck with
[the one-handed backhand.] It
makes me more versatile and
harder to read," Poruri said.
"It is still my weakness but I
think [the switch] will prove to
be to my advantage. The one
handed backhand is fun because
I can be more creative with it."
Card notes
While Poruri was starting her
trek to the NCTC title Amy
Chiminello, Kylie Johnson and
Emma Woodhouse were wrapping
up the Milwaukee Tennis Classic.
Chiminello fell to California's Lisa
Albano 6-1, 6-1 in the semifinal.
Sakolawn Kacharoen and Julie McK
eon beat the team of Johnson-Wood
house 6-3, 6-3 in the semifinal.
Laxmi Poruri clinched the sin
gles title at the National College
Tennis Classic with a 6-0, 6-3 vic
tory over UCLA's Mamie Ceniza,
but she may have won the tour
nament in the quarterfinals.
In that match, Poruri faced
Arizona State's Krista Amend.
The Cardinal sophomore was
expected to win — and she was
up a set — but she was not play
ing the way she wanted to.
"I was tentative, up and
down. I was aggressive at times
but not often enough," Poruri
said.
Women's tennis coach Frank
Brennan was also concerned, and
talked to her at 2-1 in the second
set.
"She was playing chicken. I
told her that I'd rather she lose
and play the way she's capable of
playing than (win) playing defen
sively," Brennan said. "I told her
that (her play) was embarrassing
and to do something she's proud
of."
Poruri was just as blunt. "He
told me to hit the damn ball —
and I did until the end of the
tournament."
"She hit the ball 20 percent
harder (in the second set) and
she killed the girl," Brennan
said. Poruri cruised to a 7-5, 6-1
win.
With Poruri on a roll, her next
opponent — teammate Heather
Willens — met a similar fate. The
Cardinal junior lost a grueling
three-setter 6-2, 2-6, 6-2.
"With three matches a day —
in the heat and with little rest in
between matches — we were
both tired," Poruri said.
"Heather was a little more wind
ed than I was and I moved her
around, which made her more
tired."
Although Poruri and Willens
duelled across the net in singles,
they combined their efforts in
doubles. They reached the semi
finals before succumbing to the
Bruin tandem of Ceniza and
Iwalani McCalla 7-6, 6-4.
"I was not surprised at all
(with their success)," Brennan
said. "They have been a good
team ever since we put them
together."
However, the Cardinal coach
was a bit surprised by the results

of freshman Kim Shasby and
sophomore transfer Kristine
Kurth. They also made the semi
finals before getting trounced by
Arizona's Danielle Scott and
Banni Redhair 6-1, 6-3.
"They haven't quite clicked,"
Brennan said. "They finally
started to, and it was wonderful.
They looked a little flat later, but
now we know they can do it."
Despite falling in the early
rounds, Shasby and Kurth
showed sparks of improvement
in singles.
"Kristine played a few good
matches. She is working with a
new racquet so she hasn't hit on
all eight cylinders yet," Brennan
said.
"Kim has shown streaks of
brilliance, but she needs to focus
more in between matches. She
has a tendency to drift around."
Poruri, however, was the dom
inant player in the competition.
She adds this title to her victory
in the Rolex Regionals to create
an impressive portfolio thus far.
"The last three years my con
fidence took a dive. Last year I
switched from a two-handed
backhand to a one-handed and I
was getting beat by people I
shouldn't have lost to," she
said.
"Now, I'm not scared to lose
and I'm not afraid of criticism. I
take it a lot better than I used
to."
A change of attitude has also
helped Poruri improve her game.
"I'm concentrating on progress
ing as a player and, if I do that,
the results will come.
"I like the results but I'm even
more happy that I stuck with
[the one-handed backhand.] It
makes me more versatile and
harder to read," Poruri said.
"It is still my weakness but I
think [the switch] will prove to
be to my advantage. The one
handed backhand is fun because
I can be more creative with it."
