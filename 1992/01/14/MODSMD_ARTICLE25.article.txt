overall finish, behind champion Brigham Young
University.

"This was definitely the highest scoring event
ever, as an opening meet. Even though we finished
behind BYU, we weren't trying to beat any teams,"
said coach Sadao Hamada.
Stanford succeeded in coming out strong in its
season opener with outstanding individual perfor
mances, as well as a strong team effort against a
host of California schools including California and
UC-Santa Barbara.
"(The 1992 team) is the best team I've ever had at
Stanford, after twenty years of coaching. The team
has outstanding athletes and more depth than
ever," Hamada said.
Leading the Cardinal in the all-around was junior
Jair Lynch, finishing third overall, with senior team
mate Tim Ryan coming in fifth in the same event.
Lynch won the vault with an impressive 9.90,
leading teammates Jason Cohen in second (9.70)
and sophomore Chris Sey in fourth (9.50).
Sey won the floor exercise, winning the event
with a score of 9.7. Cohen came in third with a 9.40,
followed by Josh Stein in fourth with 9.30 and Evan
Wells in fifth with 9.20.
Jeff Bender took first in the parallel bars, win
ning the event with a score of 9.60, while Lynch
came in third.
Cohen and Lynch tied on the rings, coming in
fourth for the Cardinal, scoring 9.55. Lynch also
took second on the pommel horse with a 9.70.
Cohen took third on the high bars, scoring a 9.25,
with Mark Booth finishing in sixth.
Stanford gave a strong performance in the Spar
tan Open, but will need to continue to have strong
performances in order to win the NCAA title.
"We still have a long way to go," Hamada said,
"and the key to winning the NCAA Championships
is to stay healthy."
