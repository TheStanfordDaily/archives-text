Israel, Palestine finally sit down to talk
WASHINGTON (AP) — Israelis and Palestinians are getting
down to their first-ever direct peace talks after eliminating a pro
cedural impasse that mired the negotiations for weeks.
The talks, which began with a brief exchange yesterday, will
begin their first full day today. Their goal is to provide self-rule to
the 1.7 million Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
The way for the historic talks was cleared yesterday when the
Palestinians dropped their demand to deal with Israel without
Jordanian participation and agreed to a compromise formula.
Under the agreement, Israel is meeting separately with Pales
tinians and Jordanians — with occasional three-way sessions to
discuss procedure and issues pertaining to all three.
Strep ihroat virus causes immune disorders
GALVESTON, Texas (AP) — Bacteria that cause only mild dis
ease in most people can cause others' immune systems to misfire
and produce heart disease, arthritis and other immune disorders,
a researcher says.
Malak Kotb, an immunologist at the University of Tennessee in
Memphis, has found that streptococcal bacteria carry proteins
that can activate immune system cells to attack the body's organs
rather than invading organisms.
In most people, streptococcal bacteria cause nothing worse
than a strep throat. But in some people the disease-fighting white
blood cells called T cells are stimulated by a particular strain of
bacteria to attack the heart, Kotb said.
The result is rheumatic heart disease, a severe disorder in
which the cells attack and destroy the heart's valves, she said.
Other immune-system diseases that can be caused by this kind
of misfiring include rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile diabetes, multi
ple sclerosis and lupus, Kotb said.
