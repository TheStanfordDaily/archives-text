# Class of '95 adds to Stanford melting-pot
## Survey comparisons find frosh here are more ethnically diverse 
### Chris Brazell Staff writer 
An extensive look at the demo
graphics of the national freshman
class confirmed Stanford's repu
tation for an ethnically diverse
student body interested in public
service.
The American Council on Edu
cation and the Higher Education
Research Institute at UCLA sur
veyed entering freshmen at Stan
ford and 430 other colleges and
universities nationwide.
About 57 percent of the Stan
ford respondents described them
selves as white, compared with an
average of 74 percent of students
at similar universities. And almost
25 percent of the new Stanford
students said they frequently
spoke a language other than
English' at home compared with
16 percent at similar institutions.
But racial harmony doesn't
always follow ethnic diversity,
according to multicultural educa
tor Greg Ricks. "A critical mass of
students of color is needed to
make their demands loud enough
to be heard and addressed.
"Racial conflicts arise at an
ethnically diverse university such
as this because the experience of
fewer whites and more people of

color is a new one for many peo
ple," Ricks continued.
When asked about the activities
they had engaged in during the
previous year, 89 percent of the
Stanford students had performed
volunteer work, compared with 84
percent at similar institutions.
Black Community Services
Center Director Keith Archuleta
said he has noticed "an increase in
community service in the black
community over the years. There
has been a lot more volunteer
tutoring and other forms of public
service."
Other notable statistics:
• 13 percent of Stanford stu
dents said they had attended par
ties more than six hours a week in
their senior year of high school,
compared with 26 percent at sim
ilar institutions;
• Only 1 percent of the Stan
ford freshmen smoked cigarettes,
compared with 6 percent at simi
lar institutions; and
• 14 percent estimated their
parental income at less than
$30,000; 19 percent at $150,000
or more per year.
Kjetil Larsen, a freshman from
Norway, said "What surprises me
the most is the smoking percent
age. I expected a much higher per
centage. The income distribution

is also unexpectedly low consider
ing Stanford's reputation of hav
ing affluent students."
Larsen said the survey left
much to be desired. "What the
questionnaire lacks is a test for
nonconformity. It seems to me
that many people like making
themselves heard when the same
thing has been said 30,000 times
before."

The survey tallied the respons
es of 210,739 freshmen entering
431 two- and four-year colleges in
the fall of 1991.
Of the 1,526 Stanford fresh
men who enrolled last fall, 1,422
returned questionnaires. Their
responses were compared to stu
dents enrolling at other highly
selective private universities
nationwide.
