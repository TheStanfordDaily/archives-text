# Bill may axe campaign expense ceiling
##

The sky will be the limit on campaign
expenses, and runoff elections will be elimi
nated if a bill that will be discussed at
tonight's ASSU Senate meeting passes.
Hearings Officer Jason Moore, who co
wrote the measure, said it was designed to
"weed out the unnecessary rules and limita
tions in the election process ... to clear up the
chain of commands for the ASSU."
Since election declarations are due in four

weeks, the months-old bill must be discussed
tonight, Moore said.
"We have sort of hit a deadline here, " he said.
All campaign expense limitations would be
erased if the measure passes. Graduate sena
tor Doug Bone, a co-author, said existing limi
tations are unenforceable. He said if students
aren't told how much money to spend, they
might use less and create fewer fliers.
Previously, senate candidates could spend
$60 on no more than 500 fliers; COP slates
could spend $'200 with no more than 750
fliers; and Student Conduct Legislative Coun

cil candidates could spend $48 on no more
than 400 fliers.
To eliminate the possibility of runoff when
no candidate receives a majority, senate candi
dates and COP slates will be listed on a pref
erential ballot. If no one gets a majority on the
first try, the candidates who receive the high
est votes are put back into the computer. Sec
ond and third choices are calculated until win
ners emerge.
Several responsibilities would also be added
