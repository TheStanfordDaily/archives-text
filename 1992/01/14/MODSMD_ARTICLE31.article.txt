# 'Kooky' Hoover gets top ranking
## 
### Helen Song 
The Hoover Institution
recently received the highest
overall score in an analysis of
think-tanks the world over,
ranking among the most
"clever," "cushy" and "kooky"
institutions.
Distinguished Hoover Fellow
and former Secretary of State
George Shultz said, "Rankings
are always a pleasure when
you're at the top."
The rankings, which
appeared in the Jan. 3 issue of
The Economist, were based on
five tongue-in-cheek cate
gories:
• Cleverness (intellectual
depth);
• Connectedness (political
influence);
• Canniness (a flair for pub
licity);
• Cushiness (comfortable
surroundings); and
• Kookiness (a streak of
eccentricity).
These standards were
weighted against their opposite
qualities: pedantry, irrelevance,
obscurity, poverty and conven
tionality. Think tanks received
between one and five points for
each category, depending on
how close they were to the ideal.
Hoover scored 19 out of a
possible 25 points, receiving
perfect scores for cleverness
and cushiness. The think tank
received threes in the other
categories.
According to The Economist,
no other institution could
match Hoover's "sheer intellec
tual firepower."
Senior Hoover Fellow Robert
Conquest credited Hoover's
high standing with its roster of
"many distinguished people. . ..
Diversity is important, and
we're pretty well-covered."
Conquest, who The Econ
omist called the "clearest-eyed
historian of the Soviet Union,"
was tickled that Hoover received
a higher score than most think
tanks in "kookiness."

"We're not dull," Conquest
said. "We hold individuality in
our scholars to be a virtue. Our
worthiness stems from our rep
utation as humanists as well as
economists."
Although Hoover scored
higher than most other institu
tions in this category, the think
tank fell short of a perfect
score, receiving only a three.
Conquest said, "Perhaps we
should create a search commit
tee for eccentric people."
Conquest also agreed with
Hoover's high score on the
cushiness scale, saying that
"Our climate probably has
something to do with fit]."
The Economist wrote more
than just a climate appraisal of
Hooyer's location, however.
According to the magazine,
Hoover's location "detaches
IHoover) from the hurly-burly
of every-day politics," providing
the think tank with perspective.
Shultz also ranked location
among Hoover's strengths.
Although the think tank "cannot
be as directly involved as some
other institutions in Washing
ton," its distance allows it "to be
more reflective," he said.
The Economist described
Hoover as a "congenial hang-out
for disputatious academics
untroubled by liberal thoughts,"
but it also noted that Hoover
has outgrown its past image of
conservatism.
Unlike other organizations,
Hoover has successful adjusted
into the post-Cold War Era by
"mellowing out," according to
The Economist.
The magazine also mentioned
the emergence of "closet
democrats on the staff," and sug
gested that tension between the
"politically correct" camps at
Stanford and more conservative
Hoover fellows may be easing.
Conquest predicted that
Hoover scholars will soon begin
to interact more with the rest
of the University, instead of
just being "scholars who write
their own papers."
