# 'Open meetings' bar press
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Members of the presidential
search committee held two "open
meetings" for staff and students
yesterday. Press members were
admitted only if they agreed not
to report comments made during
the meetings.
About 20 staff members attend
ed the staff meeting; two students
were at the student meeting.
The search committee decided
on the "off the record" restriction
after a long discussion at its meet
ing Friday, said Executive Vice
Chair Jean Fetter.
Committee members felt that press
coverage of either meeting would cre
ate a "chilling effect," she said.
"The committee wants to be
able to hear what people have to
say about the search in an atmo

sphere in which people feel per
fectly free to express themselves,"
she said.
The University's "General
Statement of Policy Governing
Public Events Held on the Stanford
Campus" states that programs are
considered "public events" if they
are held in University buildings or
on University property and are
open to the public or to all students.
The meeting for staff was led
by committee members Jim Lari
more, director of the Native
American Cultural Affairs Cen
ter, and Peter Bing, a trustee.
The student discussion was led
by Fetter and graduate student
Kasi Fuller.
Committee members have
planned a faculty "open meeting"
for this afternoon and three more
student meetings for this and
next week.
