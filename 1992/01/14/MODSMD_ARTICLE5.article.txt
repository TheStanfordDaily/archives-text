# Plea evokes reactions
## 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Senior Stuart Thomas' guilty
plea to misdemeanor charges of
statutory rape and providing alco
hol to a minor evoked a variety of
reactions from members of the
Stanford community.
A freshman woman accused
Thomas of raping her in a Sept.
22 incident in Stern Hall. He was
subsequently charged with a

felony count of illegal sex with a
minor by the Santa Clara County
District Attorney's office.
The charge was reduced to a mis
demeanor in a plea bargain and
Thomas pleaded guilty to the
reduced charge, as well as the misde
meanor alcohol charge, on Dec. 18.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Harrington said the police "felt the
outcome was positive in that the
case was resolved without going to
trial." He said he believes if the
case had gone to trial the results
would have been the same and
Thomas would have been found
guilty of the two charges.
Student Coordinator of Sexual
Assault Prevention Education
Susan Epstein said although she is
"not familiar enough with the case
to say there was any legal wrong
doing," she was disappointed about
certain aspects of the process.
She said plea bargaining is
"very subjective" and the prose
cuting lawyer's acceptance of it
"may have had to do with privi
lege — the fact that Thomas is a
Stanford student and an athlete."
Cowell Sexual Assault Re
sponse and Recovery Team Coor
dinator Gail Prichard noted that
"the community may feel a lot of
outrage regarding the plea bar
gain." However, she said she "can
see the situation from the judge's
viewpoint" — that the case could
be resolved without a trial
because Thomas was not a prior
offender, and the crime was not
one of physical endangerment
with deadly weapons.
Thomas' plans to practice law
made the reduction in charges
from felony to misdemeanor signif
icant because the Bar Association
does not allow convicted felons to
practice law, Epstein noted.
"I'm not sure what the victim
had to gain from"the plea bar
gaining, Epstein added. "Some
times [victims] don't want to tes
tify in a trial because they feel
embarrassed or intimidated. But
typically survivors want to testify,
to tell their story."
Epstein expressed frustration
that the original 13 charges rec
ommended by the Stanford police
— including forcible rape — and
the initial felony charge from the
DA resulted in a plea bargain to a
misdemeanor.
"I was saddened that the
charge of forcible rape had been
dropped," Epstein said.
She also criticized statutory rape
law as "ridiculous for teenagers" as
well as "patriarchal" and "sexist."
California state law defines statuto
ry rape as "unlawful sexual inter
course with a female under 18."
Harrington said the police rec
ommended any charge that

"might have been applicable" and
for which there was probable
cause. The District Attorney, he
said, is responsible for narrowing
these recommendations down to
charges that "can stand in court."
Epstein acknowledged stan
dard police procedure, but said
the Thomas case was "extreme"
because "so many . . . severe
charges were continually lowered
during the legal process."
Harrington, however, did not
think the Thomas case was excep
tional in this regard. "In the press,
(reducing the charges] is blown
out of proportion," he said, adding
that few "cut and dry" cases of
alleged sexual assault exist, so all
charges for which there is proba
ble cause are recommended.
He said there was "nothing
unusual" about the prosecution,
but the case itself was "unusual
in the respect that the victim
came forward and there was an
investigation, prosecution and an
outcome."
Harrington said the victim was
a "very strong young lady" for
going through a difficult process.
"I look at that as a very positive
sign," he said. "Unless a victim
can come forward and go through
the process, [the police] can't do
very much."
He said he thinks the example
will make it easier for victims to
"come forth" in the future.
Prichard agreed, saying the
"relatively swift and final out
come" will encourage victims to
report sexual assault.
"These situations can be night
mares for the survivors as they get
dragged through the system," she
said, adding that she felt a "sense of
pride" in the way campus resources
saw the need for an efficient pro
cess and followed through.
Prichard emphasized the
importance of encouraging vic
tims to report sexual assault. "As
painful as the process is, the vic
tim gains tremendous empower
ment by walking through the pro
cess," she said.
She said she was saddened that
there was a lack of "dialogue with
the accused" and "no ownership or
responsibility of any of [the guilt]."
Prichard said she felt the case
presented "an opportunity for
growth" for Thomas, but that the
defense's attitude was "defensive
and self-righteous."
Melvin de la Motte, Thomas'
lawyer, could not be reached for
comment.
