### Kimberly Chrisman Staff writer 
The Sigma Chi fraternity has
been placed on social probation
following a Nov. 16 incident in
which their elaborate "Robin
Hood" party decorations were
declared a fire hazard by Stanford
Fire Marshal Ray Gamma.
According to Director of Stu
dent Affairs Nanci Howe, the fra
ternity must refrain from hosting
parties until it reviews its alcohol
policy and institutes an internal
fire safety program, to be present
ed to other members of the Greek
system. In addition, each Sigma
Chi member will be required to
complete two hours of community
service before the fraternity's
social privileges are reinstated.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson approved the measure
last week, based on the recom
mendation of Howe and the new
Greek Judicial Board, which
devised the punishment.
"The whole purpose of the
judicial board is to identify prob
lems within the Greek system and
work together with the adminis
tration to resolve those prob
lems," Howe said.
The board, consisting of Howe,

a total of three representatives
from the Inter fraternity and Inter
sorority Councils, two alumni and
one unaffiliated student, was
established last quarter to recom
mend disciplinary action in cases
that involve Greek organizations.
Due to the timing of the inci
dent, the Judicial Board deferred
its recommendation until stu
dents returned from winter break.
"The issue was to make sure
that we made a good decision and
not just a quick one," Howe said.
"We were trying to be sensitive to
a lot of competing demands, like
finals. The Sigma Chis were
aware of the process, and I don't
think it was a problem for them."
"There are some things we
have to take care of, and we plan
to take care of them as soon as
possible," said Sigma Chi Presi
dent John Arrillaga. He added
that the fraternity voluntarily
canceled some social events
scheduled for last quarter, pend
ing the Judicial Board's recom
mendation.
The Judicial Board is also con
tinuing its investigation of an
alleged bike-theft incident at the
Theta Xi house Nov. 9. The board
is expected to make a recommen
dation to Jackson next week.
