the cuts uniformly across depart
ments," according to Assoc. Dean
Kenneth Down, chair of the
school's task force.
The specific proposals, accord

• Higher tuition for graduate
students. Engineering graduate
students, whose tuition is already
slightly higher than undergradu
ates, will receive an increase

above and beyond any University
wide actions. The tuition hike will
likely be "a few hundred dollars,"
Down said.
• Increased number of mas

school will likely add between 65
and 100 graduate students, and

determine which will admit the
additional students.
• Decreased number of faculty.
Engineering "will return a relative

removed through attrition.
