# Engineering school aims to up revenues
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The School of Engineering has
apparently taken the road less
traveled — aiming toward revenue
enhancement rather than signifi
cant cuts to meet its budget-reduc
tion target.
To reach its $2.4-million target,
the school "picked three chunks to
focus on . .. rather than spread
the cuts uniformly across depart
ments," according to Assoc. Dean
Kenneth Down, chair of the
school's task force.
The specific proposals, accord
ing to Down, include:
• Higher tuition for graduate
students. Engineering graduate
students, whose tuition is already
slightly higher than undergradu
ates, will receive an increase

above and beyond any University
wide actions. The tuition hike will
likely be "a few hundred dollars,"
Down said.
• Increased number of mas
ter's level graduate students. The
school will likely add between 65
and 100 graduate students, and
Down said the school "will be
working with its departments" to
determine which will admit the
additional students.
• Decreased number of faculty.
Engineering "will return a relative
ly small number of faculty billets
(to the University) and the funds
associated with them," Down said.
He declined to speculate on the
number of faculty billets to be
removed through attrition.
Down said he and the task
force have heard "nothing but
positive reactions" to the plan
after consulting with the dean,
students and representatives
from the departments.
"People prefer this plan over
potentially shutting down entire
programs or spreading the hurt to
everyone," he said. "These are the
best set of alternatives."
Elisabeth Browne, the gradu
ate student representative on the
task force, said she believes the
task force will continue to meet
with the departments to assess
the impact of the proposals.
She added that students have
not been directly told about the
small tuition hike, but that it will
"mostly affect incoming master's
students."
As the school considers
increasing the number of stu
dents while reducing its faculty,
Down said the task force's main
concern has been to "maintain
the high quality" of engineering.

But "the general feeling is that
the increase will be less than 5
percent — representing noise in
the system that will have no sig
nificant effect," he said.
Down acknowledged that los
ing faculty billets might decrease
the school's research volume, but
said the "numbers are not signifi
cant enough to hurt us in the long
run."
Down said it is also possible
that "increased collaboration
across and among departments"
may relieve some budget prob
lems by cutting down on adminis
trative costs, among other things.
He cited the Center for Integrated
Facilities Engineering as an
example of worthwhile collabora
tion.
Both Browne and Down
acknowledged that the winter
break reduced student input into
the process.
"It has been real rushed and
there has not been a lot of student
input, but they have treated me
well," Browne said. "I am work
ing [to increase student input]
now as we look at the impacts of
this proposal."
