Imagine the chance to live in
Great Britain — all expenses
paid — for up to three years.
Senior Carlos Lerner will soon
have that opportunity as a recip

The national scholarship is
awarded each year to those stu

experience England's culture
and education system while at
the same time allowing them to
contribute to life at British uni

the scholarship this year.
Lerner, a senior, earned the
award through his work as a
public policy major, and his
extracurricular activities, includ
ing playing trumpet in the Stan
ford Band and being a resident
assistant in Mirlo.
Lerner also serves as coordi
nator of Stanford volunteers for
a day-care program in East Palo
Alto. The day-care program at
McNair Elementary School puts
volunteers to work caring for of
about 40 underprivileged kids.

he considers his RA job to be
invaluable, adding that he has

always considered his dorm "a
center of social and intellectual
activity."
Although he intends to study
medicine and become a pediatri
cian, Lerner said he first hopes

to complete his master's degree
in health economics at the Uni
versity of York.
Lerner said his overriding goal
is to learn enough to "find some
way to help change the American

health system." A degree in
health economics would be useful
because of its interdisciplinary
nature, combining medicine,
