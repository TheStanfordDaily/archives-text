# Marshall Scholar earns chance to learn
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Imagine the chance to live in
Great Britain — all expenses
paid — for up to three years.
Senior Carlos Lerner will soon
have that opportunity as a recip
ient of the Marshall Scholarship.
The national scholarship is
awarded each year to those stu
dents who demonstrate intellec
tual ability and character through
both their academic transcripts
and extracurricular activities.
The goal of the scholarship is
to allow American students to
experience England's culture
and education system while at
the same time allowing them to
contribute to life at British uni
versities. Forty students received
the scholarship this year.
Lerner, a senior, earned the
award through his work as a
public policy major, and his
extracurricular activities, includ
ing playing trumpet in the Stan
ford Band and being a resident
assistant in Mirlo.
Lerner also serves as coordi
nator of Stanford volunteers for
a day-care program in East Palo
Alto. The day-care program at
McNair Elementary School puts
volunteers to work caring for of
about 40 underprivileged kids.
Open and friendly, Lerner said
he considers his RA job to be
invaluable, adding that he has

always considered his dorm "a
center of social and intellectual
activity."
Although he intends to study
medicine and become a pediatri
cian, Lerner said he first hopes

to complete his master's degree
in health economics at the Uni
versity of York.
Lerner said his overriding goal
is to learn enough to "find some
way to help change the American

health system." A degree in
health economics would be useful
because of its interdisciplinary
nature, combining medicine,

economics and statistics, he added.
The most serious current prob
lem for the health community is
the "lack of a system," Lerner
said. "We are spending more

money (on health care) than any
other country in the world, yet we
still have 37 million people with
out health insurance and limited
access to health care," he added.
Lerner said he does not see a solu
tion to the health-care crisis in the
near future. "At thus point, there is
no political consensus for any sort of
radical change," he added.

Lerner said he believes most
segments of the population would
benefit from a change in the
health care system. He added that
the poor would get health services
and the middle class would have
to bear less of the costs.
Given the power to change
anything about the U.S. health
care system, Lerner "would find

some way so everyone has access
to medical care," including creat
ing equal incentives to treat all
the ill, he said.
Lerner said he views his time in
Great Britain as a chance to "gain
personally and academically."
"I want to be in Europe to wit
ness first-hand all of the
changes," he added.
