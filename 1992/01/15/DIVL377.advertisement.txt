"MY ARMY ROTC SCHOLARSHIP
IS PAYING OFF TWICE."
"Honestly, the financial benefits ROTC offers were a big
incentive to join the program. Looking beyond money,
however, one of the main reasons I joined ROTC was for
the challenge. After only one quarter, I learned not to
establish limits for myself because I know I will keep
stretching them. ROTC has also helped me begin to
develop leadership skills that will be especially valuable
in my future career. It's a great place to start!"
