See one of the natural wonders of California and the world. Come
ride a boat from Monterey and see the whales frolieking in the ocean.
Whales arc guaranteed (well, at least we arc pretty confident that we
will see them.) Wc have reserved spaccs on a trip led by an cducator
and trained naturalist. The trip is two hours long, and returns to
Monterey Harbor at sunset.
Wc will NOT provide transportation to Monterey. Wc will provide
maps at the prc-trip meeting. You arc responsible for your own travel
and parking expenses. This can be a great day trip, go early and have
lunch in Monterey or visit the aquarium. Allow 2 hours for the drive
cach way.
I here is A PRE-TRIP MEETING, which you arc encouraged to
attend. Wc will hand out maps to Monterey, and try to facilitate
carpooling. If you have room in your car, wc will try to match you with
someone who needs a ride. Please remember that we do not
guarantee you a ride to Monterey. Ann Bushnell will also offer a slide
show on whales, and will provide information on appropriate dress.
