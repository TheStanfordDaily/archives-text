# Exploring links between King, Malcolm X
## Views of leaders often concurred, two scholars say 
### Cheo H. Coker Staff writer 
Malcolm X and Martin Luther
King are often put on opposite
sides of the political spectrum.
But in an Ujamaa program last
night, two civil rights scholars
tried to bring the messages of the
slain leaders closer together.
"King once asked, 'After the
civil rights bill passed, where do
we go from here?' Malcolm X said
we can't answer that question
unless you can answer (as African-
Americans) who we are," said His
tory Prof. Clayborne Carson,
senior editor of the King Papers
Project.
He was joined by Stewart Burns,
an associate editor of the project.
Carson, a popular Civil Rights
lecturer and author of the recent
book, "Malcolm X: The FBI files,"
focused his discussion on the mil
itant leader.
Burns focused his energies on
Martin Luther King's non-violent
legacy and the his subsequent
grasp of other social issues before
his assassination in 1968.
Both scholars agreed that King
and Malcolm X's political objec
tives and philosophies concurred
more than they conflicted.
Following his trip to Mecca,
Malcolm X's message began to con
verge with that of the larger black
freedom struggle, Carson said.
"Had Malcolm X lived longer,
there is no doubt that both lead

ers would have met again," said
Carson. "Malcolm at that period
had viewed himself as an internal
critic beneficial to the national
movement rather than the exter
nal critic he had been during his
tenure with the Nation of Islam."
Carson also said about the one
time separatist that "any thinker
who keeps his eyes open is going
to evolve."
Burns was more concerned
with the way King's message has
been "white-washed" to give legit

imacy to programs which go
against the human rights leader's
overall beliefs.
"The image of King in 1963
and his message at that particular
time is frozen in people's minds,"
said Burns. "It was the five years
after (the March on Washington)
where King really developed and
addressed such issues as the Viet
nam War and the growing mili
tancy in the inner city."
Burns covered the period in
which King widened his focus

beyond civil rights to encompass a
more "multisocial approach to
social change."
"The powers that be really try
to manipulate King's message (of
a color-blind society) for their
own interests," Burns said.
He said black and white con
servatives use King's comments
on judging people on the content
of their character rather than on
the color of their skin "to work
against preferential programs like
affirmative action."
