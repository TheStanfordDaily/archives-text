# Shadow program targets minorities, women
## 
### Connie Lo Staff writer 
A program that encourages minorities and
women to shadow "someone who's similar"
through different careers is expanding after
being given $15,000.
The program, run by the Career Planning
and Placement Center, has been in place for
several years.
Particularly targeting minorities and
women this year, the program allows interest
ed students of any ethnic background and gen
der to shadow alumni or other professionals
for a day, providing students with "a great
opportunity for students to .. . follow some
one who's similar to them," said Laura
Dominguez, community outreach coordinator
at the CPPC.

By shadowing a professional with a similar
background, students will hear a perspective
relevant to them, Domiguez said.
Such matching will prompt students to dis
cover experiences they themselves might
expect, said A 1 Levin, the CPPC's assistant
director for career resources.
The program will also encourage minority
and female students to explore career fields in
which they are normally underrepresented.
For example, black professionals are rare in
investment banking firms and there are rela
tively few disabled individuals in law or busi
ness fields.
The CPPC was one of three collegiate
career-centers nationwide awarded a $15,000
grant from the Bankers Trust Company this
year for an innovative new program.
With the grant money, the CPPC will cre

ate a computer database with the names and
occupations of alumni and professionals.
To participate in the shadow program, stu
dents will access the database, fill out an appli
cation and rank their preferences. Levin and
Dominguez will review and match the partici
pants.
The ranking system allows students to
have greater control of who they will shadow.
The CPPC has received names of potential
shadow sponsors from the Alumni Associa
tion. According to Levin, at least 160 alumni
have expressed interest in the program.
Levin and Dominguez have also been in
contact with ethnic centers and alumni clubs
within Stanford, including the Chicano Alum
ni Club, American Indian Center and Disabili
ty Resource Center. They hope to gain a num
ber of sponsors from such areas.
