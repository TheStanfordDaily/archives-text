# Lectures highlight alternate viewpoints
## 
### Sara Skinner 
Tonight the Dofflemyer Lec
ture series will offer the first of
its winter quarter lectures, which
aim to bring "dynamic, thought
provoking people" to campus.
The intentionally controver
sial lecture series, which is spon
sored by Ronald Howard, director
of the Decisions and Ethics Cen
ter, seeks to expose students to
alternative ideas about politics
and economics.
Stanford alumnus Robert Dof
flemyer, who funds the series,
said his main motivation for
starting the lectures three years
ago was his belief that students
are not always given the opportu
nity to see all sides of issues in
their classes.
He said he hopes the series,
which is subtitled "Visions for a
Free Society," will inspire thought
and encourage participants to for
mulate their own opinions.
"These speakers were selected
because they are dynamic, thought
provoking people," organizer Rick
Giarrusso said. "I want people to go
to the lecture and have fun."
Historical commentator Otto
Scott will kick off the series
tonight with a speech and discus
sion titled "The Beltway's View of
Business."
Tonight's lecture focuses on
the changing relationship of busi
ness and government. According
to Scott, "Most people think it's
not possible to have business
without regulation. Rules are nec
essary. But there is a limit on how
many rules we need to function."
Thomas Moore, Senior Research
Fellow at the Hoover Institute, will
moderate.
The second lecture features
David Boaz, Executive Vice Presi
dent of the Cato Institute, who
will speak on "Liberating Schools,
Liberating Children: the Chal
lenge of Educational Choice" on
Jan. 28.
Boaz advocates educational
choice as a means of improving
inner-city education and break
ing the poverty cycle.
Don Kates of the Pacific
Research Institute, will follow
with a Feb. 11 lecture titled "Gun
Control: Criminological Solution
or Cultural Bigotry?"
An attorney, Kates said he
believes gun control "deprives
people of the ability to use guns
for self-defense without disarm
ing criminals." He said he's espe
cially interested in the use of
guns by women.
The March 3 lecture, "Telling It
Like It Isn't: Federal Government
Propaganda," features University
of Tennessee Economics Prof.
Thomas DiLorenzo.
The final winter quarter lec
ture on March 10, presented bv

eign Policy Studies at the Cato
