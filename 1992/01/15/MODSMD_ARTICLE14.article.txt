# For international students, the lessons are cultural

Ignorant questions, different concepts
of privacy and the emphasis on gender
issues can send international students
reeling, but many say they have learned
to adapt to life at Stanford.
Many of the international students at
Stanford don't want to call their experi
ence here culture shock. But even though
they knew what to expect, they still say
they were not completely prepared to deal
with American students.
In the process of adapting, some stu
dents say they have started to change
their habits: They are buying Filofaxs,
keeping the door open, eating junk food,

watching their words and not taking first
meetings very seriously.
"Americans have different priorities in
their relationships," said freshman Abhi
Katyal, a student from India. "When you
first meet them, they are very friendly as
if everybody is everybody's best friend.
They even talk about very personal
issues." But, he added, Americans are
slower to choose their "real friends."
One Japanese student noted that at
first meetings many Americans call each
other by their first name, regardless of
age — an action which would be consid
ered rude in Japan. But when the hyper
bolic friendliness fades away, some inter
national students say they feel deserted.

"Americans are very easy to make
friends with because they don't have any
barriers" like many Europeans, Italian
freshman Keith Toh said.
However, a lack of barriers can cause
misunderstandings, some international
students say.
For example, German freshman
Michael Witt noted that some interna
tional students consider their dorm room
private, and only allow close friends to
visit.
But, he said, people who don't leave
their doors open at Stanford are consid
ered unfriendly.
Some of the students also have to deal
with inane questions.

Anna Magewska, a freshman from
Poland, said she was asked, "Is there ice
cream in Poland?"
Another "shocking" experience is the
importance of using the right words, said
Greek freshman Amalia Protopapas.
"Things are taken much more seriously
here — you have to watch every word you
use in order not to start a discussion or
pull people's anger at you." Students cite
the he/she usage problem, and oversensi
tivity to gender issues.
Also, "People live too hectically here,"
said freshman Nabeel Amudi, a native of
Saudi Arabia. "Everybody is either com
ing or going all the time and all their lives
are scheduled."
