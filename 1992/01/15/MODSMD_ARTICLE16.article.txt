Committee's press ban
will end up hurting, not
protecting, community

4 TT COULD TELL YOU,
\/\/ but we'd have to kill
V Y you."
For spies, inventors and 6-year
olds, secrets are the stuff of life.
Lately, it seems as if the same is
true for the members of the Presi
dential Search Committee, who
held "open meetings" about the
process for all community mem
bers — and then prohibited the
press from reporting what went on.
This ban on press coverage vio
lates University policy, which
states explicitly that "any meeting
not specifically declared to be
closed, both in the request for use
of the University facility and in all
announcements, is an open meet
ing, and all who wish to do so may
attend."
The meetings were advertised as
open. Reporters, therefore, should
have been able to attend and, in
their capacity as journalists, cover
the event. Regardless of what its
members say, the committee has a
responsibility to toe policy line as
the University does enforce it.
State universities do as much.
This apparent breach of policy is
disturbing, but nowhere near as
enraging as the rationale.
According to Jean Fetter, execu
tive vice chair of the search com
mittee, press coverage of the meet
ings would create a "chilling effect"
on speech. That notion, however
sensitively concocted, is absurd.
Would anyone speak at an open
meeting if he or she truly feared
the repercussions of free speech?
Probably not. But if employees are
afraid of expressing their opinions, it
is incumbent on the University to
build an environment in which hon
esty is welcomed — and not relegat
ed to stuffy conference rooms.
At any rate, if someone actually
fears the repercussions of public

exchange, he or she may write a
letter to the committee.
In prohibiting press coverage,
the committee devalued free
speech and the individual's respon
sibility to bear the consequences.
This flies in the face of the Univer
sity's commitment to the open
exchange of ideas — exchange that
is the bedrock of institutions dedi
cated to the pursuit of knowledge
and understanding.
Blocking press coverage of pub
lic events is as sure a way as any of
freezing speech altogether. It rein
forces the sad misperception that
speech is dangerous.
And, ironically, it opens the door
to rumor, a far more genuine danger.
Anyone who has played "tele
phone" knows that statements get
garbled when they are whispered
from person to person.
First-hand access to information
is far more valuable than gossip
picked up at the water cooler. It is
only fair to the participants of the
open meeting to have their com
ments recorded accurately by
reporters, who are trained to listen.
Committee chair John Lillie said
the point of the meetings was to
gather information for the search
committee — and not The Daily.
Unfortunately for his commit
tee, the information members were
able to gather will not extend
beyond the handful of people who
attended the meetings. Very few
know what was actually said
because The Daily did not report it.
Honest discussion is severely lim
ited when the campus' only inde
pendent source of information isn't
allowed to do its job. In the long run,
it wasn't The Daily that was hurt by
the prohibition on press coverage —
it was the people the committee is
supposed to serve: Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff.
It is extremely patronizing that
a University committee would
attempt to protect people from
their own ideas. One can only hope
that Stanford's next president has
more respect for the community
and for free speech than the com
mittee making the selection.
