University ignores importance of liberal education

WHILE I AM NOT A STANFORD
graduate, I am an attorney and
the product of a liberal arts edu
cation. It is in the latter role that I write
today.
I have seen the various articles in the
press concerning the possible decision by
Stanford to disband the Drama Depart
ment as a cost-cutting measure.
While I understand the need for cost
cutting in the midst of a recessionary
economy — not to mention Stanford's
other more recent monetary problems,
which were not, by the way, caused by
the Drama Department, so why they
should have to pay for them is beyond
me — I am particularly concerned about
the tenor of the comments from the Uni
versity concerning the cuts.
The comments give the impression
that this particular cut is being consid
ered because drama is not "necessary" to
the education of Stanford students, not
"central" to Stanford's academic pro
gram. Unfortunately that attitude
smacks of the old argument, which
seems to raise its ugly head most perva

sively in recessionary times, that a
broad-based, liberal arts education and
the courses attendant thereto — such as
drama, music, philosophy, etc. — are not
"necessary" because they do not train
people to work in the outside world.
As the product of such a liberal arts
education, I cannot stress strongly
enough the importance of that education
in getting me where I am today. While in
college, I took a wide variety of courses
from economics and political science to
calculus and physics to drama and art.
After college I went on to law school
where I received the remainder of the
"technical" training I needed to practice
law. In most professions graduate work
is necessary to complete the introducto
ry work that was started as an under
graduate.
If that graduate work is necessary
anyway, it makes sense to use college to
emphasize a broad-based liberal arts
education that can supplement the tech
nical knowledge gained later in graduate
school. Even for those who are not going
on to graduate school, liberal arts educa

tion will provide a basis to enter the
working world.
Stanford's threatened cut of the
Drama Department is the first step away
from offering a true liberal arts educa
tion. How much easier will it be the next
time to cut the Art Department or Music
Department and, later, any other depart
ment that does not literally prepare one
for a specific job after college?
Without these departments and pro
grams, Stanford becomes merely anoth
er technical institution — a first rate
technical institution, but a technical
institution nevertheless. As an under
graduate, I watched Caltech make some
of these same decisions over the years.
Today Caltech is known for producing
a particular type of student — excellent
in the sciences, but not the well-rounded
student that Stanford and other liberal
arts institutions have always prided
themselves on graduating.
It is that choice that I see before the
University this month: Will Stanford be
known as an outstanding institution that
produces well-rounded, well-educated

human beings who know more about
their job, care about the world outside
their office and understand arts and phi
losophy as well as science and technology?
Or will Stanford choose to dilute its
history and reputation as a premier lib
eral arts educator with pride in the
diversity and breadth of its student body
by cutting where it is easiest?
Just once I would like to see a football
program have to live through the same
kinds of cuts. I doubt that anyone would
argue that football is more important
than a Stanford education. Or that
knowing a touchback from a touchdown
is more important than the public speak
ing skills honed in a drama class or the
analysis necessary in literary criticism.
I urge the University to find another
way to save the necessary money. The
liberal arts education that Stanford
offers is too important to chip away at in
this manner. It is simply too hard to
recreate that reputation, not to mention
the department, once it is destroyed.

The time has come to stop Stanford's time thievery

Every year the University plays the
role of time bandit by setting its starting
date for the very end of September or
the beginning of October. Luckily, jus
tice has usually prevailed, and the Uni
versity is forced to push the date back a
week or two.
Hopefully, this year will be no differ
ent, although so far it looks as if things
might take a turn for the worse. Accord
ing to the Time Schedule, fall quarter
1992 will start on Sept. 30, an entire
month later than most schools.
As a result, winter break will be a
week shorter, and we will get out our
usual month later than anyone else.
The problems with this schedule are

many. Most Stanford students have
friends or family who are also in school.
Due to this ridiculous schedule, it is prac
tically impossible to coordinate visits
with these people during the school year.
Also, summer jobs are next to impos
sible to find, since all the other college
help can start working a full month
before you and fill up the already reces
sion-shrunken summer work force.
And who wants to arrive home from a
grueling week of finals just before the
start of Christmas? It would seem quite
simple if classes were to begin in the
middle of September, rather than the
end. I enjoy my summer break as much
as anyone, but I wouldn't mind missing

some of September.
The University could even start earli
er — say the first week of September —
so that finals end at Thanksgiving, as
they do at some other schools. That way
students could take advantage of the
many work opportunities available at
Christmas-time because they would have
nearly six weeks of winter vacation.
Stanford is on a trimester schedule,
and I am not suggesting we change that.
Three sets of exams can be trying, but
no one wants to take statistics for a
whole semester anyway.
However, as students we shouldn't
have to submit ourselves to the time
thievery of the administration. There

have to be ways that the University can
still deliver a scholarly message to its
flock, without leading it to temporal
slaughter.
