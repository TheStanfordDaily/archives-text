## A 						tale of two lives 
### 
WHAT FOLLOWS IS THE record
ing of a dream. Resemblance to
any occurrence within actual
political or economic systems is purely
coincidental.
I took a final look back as I crossed the
border. I knew that I was about to plunge
into a completely different world, but I
was determined not to repeat the lives of
my father and grandfather, who toiled the
soil from year to year with little in return.
I would be back one day. I would
become somebody.
I bounced from job to job until one day
I saw an ad for a marketing position. I
knew that I normally wouldn't qualify for
this kind of prestigious job. People
attended school for many years just to
prepare for things like this; however, this
ad required no experience or education at
all. This was simply too precious an
opportunity to pass up.
I called the number listed in the ad. A
very friendly female voice answered my
ring. I was nervous initially, but she
wasn't at all concerned about my qualifi
cations. She simply invited me to visit
their facilities.
I was elated. I immediately ripped
apart the sofa cushion and took out all
the money that I had saved up. I bought
myself a nice suit and a tie. This just
might be my big break.
My taxi stopped in front of a tall glass
building. As I entered through the revolv

ing door, my eyes were struck by a blind
ing brightness. It came from the hun
dreds of diamond earrings and necklaces
of the crowd gathered in the room.
I had arrived at a crystal palace. The
men were all wearing shiny suits, and the
woman were all wrapped in silvery dresses.
Just as I was wondering what to do, a
woman rushed out and greeted me by my
first name. She shook my hand. While we
walked toward her office, she asked me
about my family, my hobbies, my favorite
food and music .
We were frequently interrupted by
other people passing by. She invariably
introduced them to me. She would say,
"This is Bill. He is the 15th top money
earner of this company," or "Meet Sally.
She broke the company earning record
for a second-year saleswoman."
These people then would say, "This is
a great company. You look like the kind
of guy who will stay with us. You are
going to have a great future."
I felt a sense of excitement. Was des
tiny finally knocking at my door?
We finally arrived at her office on the
10th floor. "I feel that I have known you
for a long time. You are my kind of guy,
energetic and dynamic," she said. She
pushed some kind of button. The cabinet
door slid open, and a giant TV set
appeared. She patiently explained their
sales concept to me while a promotional
video was being shown.

I finally understood that I was going to
buy bottled water from this kind and lov
ing woman at a low wholesale price and
then supply it to the general public. I
gave her only a small percentage and
could keep the rest of the profit.
Meantime, I could also recruit my own
people into the company, who would in
turn buy water from me and contribute
their percentages. As more and more peo
ple worked for me, I would be able to
drive my own Mercedes and purchase my
own hill-top villa.
She led me back into the crystal
palace. Someone was now making a
speech on a podium. The woman told me
that the lecturer was Mr. Green, founder
of the company. The crowd frequently
punctuated his lecture with cheers of
approval. "Oh yes, oh yes," they shouted.
It was indeed a religious experience for
me. As the lecture ended, we lined up one
by one to hug Mr. Green. What a close
knit family. As Mr. Green wrapped his
arm around me, 1 knew that I had found
my shelter and my future.
