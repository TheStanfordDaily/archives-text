# Help for undergrads might be lost in cuts
## Meyer staff fears effects on students 
### Julia Sobrevilla Staff writer 
A proposal to eliminate
Meyer's reference desk endangers
one of Stanford's means of teach
ing research skills, Meyer librari
ans said yesterday. But some
librarians in Green said they are
willing to pick up the teaching
slack.
Reference librarians can either
point to what you need, or make
you learn how to find it yourself,
the Meyer librarians said.
"Our philosophy is teaching
(students] how to find informa
tion rather than giving it to
them," said Sandy Ward, refer
ence and science librarian at
Meyer.
She added that even though
reference services will still be
available to students in other
libraries such as Green, the time
and attention devoted to students
will not be the same as is given in
Meyer.
But not everyone agrees that
the change will result in dimin
ished reference services.
Roberto Trujillo, curator and
acting director of the reference
services at Green, said the volume
of students who will use Green's
reference services will increase
significantly if cuts are approved,
but he also expects "quality to
increase."
Still, the number of support
personnel in Green library, main
ly graduate students, may de
crease next year because of cuts,
Trujillo admits.
The plan to disperse Meyer's
reference services to other

libraries, which now deal mostly
with graduate students and facul
ty, is an attempt "to make the
rest of the libraries more friendly
to undergraduates," said Kathy
Kerns, coordinator for library
instruction and reference librari
an at Meyer.
Currently Meyer's reference
desk has three librarians plus
both graduate and undergraduate
students as support personnel.
If the cuts are accepted, two of
the librarians will be reassigned,
probably to the Green reference
desk, where the bulk of questions
are expected to go.
Green's desk usually receives
more specialized requests than
Meyer's desk, according to Trujil
lo.
"The students that come here
are people that come here doing
more in-depth research," he said.
Ron Nakao, a member of the
support staff at the reference
desk at Green and a graduate stu
dent in education, said he often
feels like a detective helping stu
dents search for information.
"The library is more than just
books and materials; it is the peo
ple, too," he said.
Nakao's job is to answer ques
tions ranging from, "How many
angels fit on the head of a pin?" to
"How many volcanoes are there
in the Ring of Fire on the Pacific
Rim?"
"In Green, the reference desk
people are posed more demanding
sorts of questions than at Meyer,"
Ward said. When questions are
too simple, Ward said, "I think
there's been a tendency to say 'go
to Meyer.' "
Freshmen, who pose many of
the questions to the Meyer librar
ians, may still have a place to go
in Meyer for assistance. A work
shop designed to teach them how
to use the library's resources
apparently will not be eliminated,
Ward said.
