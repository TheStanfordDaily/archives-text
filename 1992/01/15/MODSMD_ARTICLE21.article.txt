## Adam the Barbarian Punishing power forward Adam Keefe leads Cardinal against conference foes 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Pacific-10 Conference basketball coaches are
hastily writing their own script for Terminator 3,
and it calls for the immediate neutralization of
Stanford power forward Adam Keefe.
In a blockbuster adventure acted out on the
courts of the Pac-10, Keefe will be relentlessly
hunted by defenses for the next 16 games. The
coaches (minus rebel writer Mike Montgomery)
would love to go back in time and transform Keefe
from a basketball stud into the world's greatest
bungee-cord jumper or a majestic redwood tree,
but these plots will have to be saved for the sequel.
For now, every game Stanford plays the defense
targets Keefe, the omnipotent 6-foot-9 man in the
middle for the Cardinal. The All-America candi
date faces double-teams, box-and-ones, sagging
zones and Schwarzenegger-style defenders sent
into the game commando style to attack until

defeated.
But through 11 games, only Michigan State has
found a way to slow Stanford's predatory power
forward. Keefe added a lethal offensive arsenal in
the off-season and has gunned the surprising Car
dinal to a 10-1 record overall, 2-0 in the Pac-10.
"In the Pac-10 it's going to be harder, because
the referees can't call every foul," Keefe said, who
is averaging 25 points and 13 rebounds per game,
despite being hunted baseline to baseline.
Keefe has taken the defensive attention and
twisted it to his advantage. When teams muscle
him inside, he buries outside jumpers, passes to
open teammates or waits patiently to score off
rebounds. If allowed to get the ball inside, he
scores.
"Adam has really had his head in the game as
far as knowing what he needs to do to help us
win," Montgomery said. "How many of Brent's
(Williams) and Pete's (Dukes) 40 points (against
Oregon) came because of what they were doing to
stop Keefe?"
Keefe — who, at 240 pounds, is 10 pounds
stronger than last year — spent the summer
preparing for the vicious Pac-10 onslaught. He
worked on his outside game as a starter for the
Pan American team, then worked on his inside
toughness with the Yoda of centers, former
UCLA and NBA great Bill Walton.
"We talked basketball for a week and it was a
really good experience," said Keefe, who stayed at
Walton's home for a week. "He taught me some of
the mental aspects of playing the post, as well as
some new skills. He gave me a sense of what it
takes to go to the next level and be successful."
Playing power forward—instead of center as he
did last year— has allowed Keefe to score from the
perimiter and escape some of the banging inside.
And when teams try to wear Keefe out by fouling
him, he is punishing them with an 86 percent free
throw rate.
"Teams like USC and Arizona will just keep
sending guys to foul me," said Keefe, who is ready
for the challenge. "Fortunately, coach has given
me the opportunity to step away from the basket
and shoot the ball, and that should help me."
Despite the constant defensive attention, Keefe
has been not just great or consistent, but consis
tently great. If forced to pick his worst game of the
year, it was a not-so-shabby 18 point, 12 rebound
performance against Michigan State in which he
had a career-high 10 turnovers.
In a 78-57 Pac-10 win at Oregon Saturday, the
Duck zone smothered Keefe, so he turned into a
passing and rebounding machine. While limited to
a season-low 10 shots, Keefe snagged a career-high
22 rebounds, left lots of room for Peter Dukes and
Brent Williams to shoot from the perimeter, yet
still wound up with 17 points of his own.
"I kind of have to (focus on things besides scor
ing), but it's not by choice," Keefe said. "You have
to do something out there so you don't feel like a
stiff. I get adrenaline out of watching other people
hit open jumpers."
Dangerous Don Mac Lean of UCLA and Sean
Rooks of Arizona are on the Pac-10 path of
destruction, but so far in 1992 Keefe has been too
tough to terminate.

middle for the Cardinal. The All-America candi
date faces double-teams, box-and-ones, sagging
zones and Schwarzenegger-style defenders sent
into the game commando style to attack until

defeated.
But through 11 games, only Michigan State has
found a way to slow Stanford's predatory power
forward. Keefe added a lethal offensive arsenal in
the off-season and has gunned the surprising Car
dinal to a 10-1 record overall, 2-0 in the Pac-10.
"In the Pac-10 it's going to be harder, because
the referees can't call every foul," Keefe said, who
is averaging 25 points and 13 rebounds per game,
despite being hunted baseline to baseline.
Keefe has taken the defensive attention and
twisted it to his advantage. When teams muscle
him inside, he buries outside jumpers, passes to
open teammates or waits patiently to score off
rebounds. If allowed to get the ball inside, he
scores.
"Adam has really had his head in the game as
far as knowing what he needs to do to help us
win," Montgomery said. "How many of Brent's
(Williams) and Pete's (Dukes) 40 points (against
Oregon) came because of what they were doing to
stop Keefe?"
Keefe — who, at 240 pounds, is 10 pounds
stronger than last year — spent the summer
preparing for the vicious Pac-10 onslaught. He
worked on his outside game as a starter for the
Pan American team, then worked on his inside
toughness with the Yoda of centers, former
UCLA and NBA great Bill Walton.
"We talked basketball for a week and it was a
really good experience," said Keefe, who stayed at
Walton's home for a week. "He taught me some of
the mental aspects of playing the post, as well as
some new skills. He gave me a sense of what it
takes to go to the next level and be successful."
Playing power forward—instead of center as he
did last year— has allowed Keefe to score from the
perimiter and escape some of the banging inside.
And when teams try to wear Keefe out by fouling
him, he is punishing them with an 86 percent free
throw rate.
"Teams like USC and Arizona will just keep
sending guys to foul me," said Keefe, who is ready
for the challenge. "Fortunately, coach has given
me the opportunity to step away from the basket
and shoot the ball, and that should help me."
Despite the constant defensive attention, Keefe
has been not just great or consistent, but consis
tently great. If forced to pick his worst game of the
year, it was a not-so-shabby 18 point, 12 rebound
performance against Michigan State in which he
had a career-high 10 turnovers.
In a 78-57 Pac-10 win at Oregon Saturday, the
Duck zone smothered Keefe, so he turned into a
passing and rebounding machine. While limited to
a season-low 10 shots, Keefe snagged a career-high
22 rebounds, left lots of room for Peter Dukes and
Brent Williams to shoot from the perimeter, yet
still wound up with 17 points of his own.
"I kind of have to (focus on things besides scor
ing), but it's not by choice," Keefe said. "You have
to do something out there so you don't feel like a
stiff. I get adrenaline out of watching other people
hit open jumpers."
Dangerous Don Mac Lean of UCLA and Sean
Rooks of Arizona are on the Pac-10 path of
destruction, but so far in 1992 Keefe has been too
tough to terminate.
