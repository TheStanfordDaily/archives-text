# Men's Basketball vs. California
## 
### 
TONIGHT - 9 p.m. tip-off at Maples Pavilion, with live
nationwide television coverage on ESPN. No Dick
Vitale, but Barry Tompkins and Dan Belluomini will
announce the game. Courtside listeners can tune
their Walkmen to KZSU (90.1 FM).
RECORDS — Stanford (10-1, 2-0 and tied for first in the
Pacific 10 Conference), California (6-6, 0-2 and dead
last in the Pac-10, generally ranked lower in every
thing).
PREVIOUS MEETINGS — California leads the series 130-
87, but the teams have split their past 12 games. Last
year the teams both won at home, with Stanford tri
umphing 90-72 at Maples Pavilion and losing 75-70 at
Harmon Gym. Senior All-America candidate Adam
Keefe scored 24 points and grabbed nine rebounds,
while Cal forward Brian Hendrick tallied 24 points and
13 rebounds in the game last year at Stanford. Of
course, Stanford has the Axe.
CROWD KEYS — Cal freshman point K.J. Roberts is
easily rattled and may be convinced to throw passes
into the stands... No fans have tested the springs in
the floor of Maples recently.. . When fans merrily
jumped up and down at the women's Tennessee
game, the referees didn't respond.
DA BEARS — California has been sporadic in its first 12
games, but the Bears are stacked with talent for the
future. The Bears have their haunches to the wall after
an unimpressive 0-2 trip to Oregon and Oregon State.
Junior power forward Brian Hendrick (15.3 points,
10.4 rebounds per game) anchors the team, but has
been in a shooting slump. Senior guard Bill Elleby
(14.2 PPG) plays a stabilizing role for unpredictable
freshmen Al Grigsby (10.4 PPG, 7.1 RPG) and point
guard K.J. Roberts. Roberts has been the main culprit
in Cal's giveaway offense that committed 17 first half
turnovers in the loss at Oregon State.
CARDINAL CORNER — When Stanford blitzed Oregon
State (67-64) and Oregon (78-57) to open the Pac-10,
it was only the fourth time it had swept a conference
road trip since the formation of the Pac-10 in 1978...
Stanford has not won three games to open the con
ference since 1966-67, when the Cardinal beat Ore
gon, Oregon State and USC. .. Stanford opponents
are shooting just 40 percent from the field.. . The Car
dinal is 66-13 in the last five seasons at Maples Pavil
ion and has a modest eight-game home win streak on
the line.
