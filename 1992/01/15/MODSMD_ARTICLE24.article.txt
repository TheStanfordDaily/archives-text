# Shaw, Turner are leading contenders to fill position of football head coach
## 
### 
Last Friday at 2 p.m. Minnesota
time the last grain of sand fell
through the Denny Green hour
glass and an era came to an end.
Green's departure deprived the Stan
ford football program of its soul, but
luckily for the Cardinal, the body still
lives and is something that Stanford
Athletic Director Ted Leland is trying
to save from decomposition.

Leland has been preaching continu
ity these days because Green gave rise
to a winning program and the AD (and
the rest of us) does not want to see it
fall. Leland knows it is unwise to mess
with a good thing, so he is looking
within the program first. New blood
could mean new plays, new people,
maybe even a new attitude. I'his is
bad say the players:
"It took us three years to get to
this offense scheme and this defen
sive scheme and we are ready to keep
it going forward," safety Jimmy Klein
said last Friday. "If you bring in a guy
with a new philosophy, you turn vet
erans into rookies because guys have
to learn new schemes and play new
positions."
Stanford would like to think its
rookie years are behind it. Klein
thinks the team has shaken the 3-8
reputation, but it will take a few
more 8-4's before that happens.
Everybody loves a winner, and Leland
has wisely decided to try to keep
things in the family so as not to dis
rupt the fine work that Green has
done.

Stanford track coach Brooks John
son will tell you that "what got you
there will keep you there," but the
problem with the football team is that
most of the "what" is now collecting
checks from the Vikings.
Yet Green was far from a one man
show. During his tenure with the Car
dinal he assembled a fine staff, and it
is some of these men who may be next
in line for the football throne.
The front runner is Willie Shaw,
which is good and bad all at the same
time.
The Good: Shaw will tell you that he
will make a good head coach, and you
can't fault the guy's credentials. Start
ing with the near loss to Colorado in
1990 and continuing all the way
through this season's seven-game win
ning streak, Shaw demonstrated his
defensive wizardry. His experience with
the Detroit Lions taught him some
great plays and Stanford absorbed
them well.
The Bad: Well, he is not exactly what
you would call the most popular guy on
the team. Word on the street is that
Stanford players are a little worried
that Shaw will get the job because his
yelling and cursing tirades could get
worse if he is the head guy.
Talk to Shaw yourself and you can
ascertain that his personality is about
as rosy as Stanford's financial future.
College coaches need to make friends
with a lot of people: media, alumni,
school officials and students just to
name a few. Denny Green's personality
was a big reason he was popular with
the above list. Sorry Willie, but talent
alone does not a good coach make.
Which brings us to . ..
Ron Turner. Here we have the
reverse problem: Turner is more of an
outgoing personality, yet his coaching
talents are a little unclear.
Sure, Stanford's offense was one of
the most potent in the Pac-10 this year,
but whether it was Green or Turner
who did most of the work is unclear to

'It took us three years
to get to this offense
scheme and this
defensive scheme
and we are ready to
keep it going forward.'
— Jimmy Klein

everybody, including Cardinal players.
Some say Turner was hindered by
Green and would do more if he were
named head honcho, which is probably
true. At any rate, it is not like Green
took all the playbooks with him, so the
Cardinal would not be that bad off if
Turner got the job.
So who is the guy?
Who knows. Shaw said he would go
off with Green if he got the chance,
which he very well might. That would
leave Turner, yet he is anything but a
shoe-in.
Choosing a new Division I-A head
football coach is not a thing to rush,
and Leland says he still has a long list of
interested people.
If Memorial Church gets re-opened
soon enough maybe people can pray for
the hand of God to touch the Universi
ty and deliver Bill Walsh, but of course
that is only speculation.
The fact is that Stanford has this
empty hourglass that they don't want
to get rid of. It is up to Ted Leland and
Co. to find the right sand to keep it
working.

Chip Hall is a senior history major who
realizes the allusion to Denny Green as
an hourglass is about as oxyrnoronic as
jumbo shrimp. Slim Fast could have its
newest pro coach poster boy — move over
Lasorda . . .
