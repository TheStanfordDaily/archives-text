## Molecular triad may unlock mysteries of immune system 
### Joanne Adams Staff writer 
What has three parts, is smaller than the head of
a pin and may be the next place to target in the quest
to cure immune diseases?
It's called a molecular triad, and understanding
how it works may shed new light on the workings of
the immune system and offer novel therapeutic
approaches for autoimmune diseases including mul
tiple sclerosis (MS), according to a Stanford research
team. The findings were recently published in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Dr. Dawn Smilek and her colleagues in Dr. Hugh
McDevitt's microbiology and immunology lab have
been studying a disease induced in mice called exper
imental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) that
is a useful model for MS. They had previously shown
that introducing a particular mutation in the dis
ease-inducing molecule turns it into a disease-pre
venting agent.
What's impressive, said Smilek, is that the altered
molecule can prevent rather than induce EAE, even
after the immune cells responsible for disease onset
have been activated.
Autoimmunity is a condition marked by the fail
ure of immune signals that usually prevent the
destruction of "self," or the body's own tissues. For
as yet unknown reasons, in MS, natural disease

fighting immune cells are signaled to begin attacking
a structure on the body's own central nervous sys
tem called the myelin sheath.
The loss of myelin, or demyelination, disrupts the
transmission of electrical signals between cells.
Effectively, the wiring in the central nervous system
gets short-circuited.
According to Dr. Leslie Dorfman, professor of
neurology, about one in 1,000 people have MS. It
tends to manifest itself in 20- and 30-year-olds and is
slightly more prevalent in women.
The course of the disease is extremely variable.
Once MS is diagnosed, "it's very difficult to predict
what's going to happen. You can't predict the level of
disability," Dorfman said. Moreover, the course of
the disease is typically episodic over many years and
characterized by relapses and remissions.
Symptoms of MS include visual problems, numb
ness in a limb, bowel dysfunction and paralysis.
There is currently no effective treatment, though
cortisone derivatives "tend to quiet down the acute
flare-ups of the symptoms," according to Dorfman.
Chronic EAE with relapses and remissions can be
induced in certain strains of mice with a fragment of
the protein MBP (myelin basic protein). However, it
is not known what induces MS in humans. In that
respect, chronic EAE "is a very contrived model (for
human MS)," Smilek said.
Nonetheless, many aspects of EAE are compara

ble to the human disease. For example, "lesions in
the nervous system (of an EAE mouse) are similar to
human lesions in many respects," Dorfman said.
Studying the animal model has given researchers
novel ideas that could potentially be applied to the
treatment of MS.
Immune cells known as T-helper cells (T-h cells)
are the primary disease-inducing agents in EAE. T
h cells normally respond to a foreign protein (anti
gen) that has invaded the body after the antigen has
been taken up and presented by specialized cells of
the immune system called antigen-presenting cells.
A receptor on the surface of the T-h cells recog
nizes the foreign antigen only when it is associated
with a particular protein, known as an MHC
molecule, that is found on the surface of the antigen
presenting cells. This molecular triad, formed by the
foreign antigen, the "self' MHC molecule and the T
cell receptor is critical to the immune response by T
h cells. Once this triad is formed, T-h cells are stim
ulated and they signal scavenger cells and antibodies
to start feasting on the invader.
In autoimmune disease, scavenger cells strike out
against the body's own tissues because the T-h cells
have mistaken a "self' protein for a foreign invader. In
the case of EAE, this "self' protein is MBP and substi
tutes for a foreign antigen in the molecular triad. The
T-h cells consequently signal scavengers to strike out
at the myelin sheath of the body's own central nervous
system as though it were a foreign entity..
Investigators regard this molecular triad as a
good target for immune intervention. They reason
that it should be possible to prevent the onset of
autoimmune disease by knocking out the formation
of a functional triad in any number of ways.
The approach taken by Smilek and colleagues is
based on the strategy of designing an altered MBP
fragment that could bind the MHC molecule more
tightly on the antigen-presenting cell and yet fail to
stimulate the T-h cells in the triad.
The rationale is that such a mutated fragment
would antagonize the recognition of the "self MBP
by competing with it for binding to the same MHC
molecules. Because it would bind more tightly, the
altered MBP could effectively monopolize the MHC
sites. In this way, the T-h cells would not get stimu
lated, and no attack against the native MBP would
be launched.
Smilek and collaborators were successful in identi
fying the part of the MBP molecule that binds the
MHC site.They capitalized on that knowledge by
making changes in the MBP molecule that they pre
dicted would increase its affinity for the MHC
molecule. Their prediction proved true; the altered
molecule out-competed the original for MHC binding.
Pretreating the laboratory mice with the altered
molecule prior to disease induction prevented the
onset of EAE. In addition, administering the altered
MBP near or even at the time of disease prevented
its progression. The disease-causing T-h cells were
effectively stopped dead in their tracks.
Further study indicated to the investigators that

conventional ideas about the workings of the
immune system could not explain their observations
with the altered MBP molecule. In addition, their
data did not support the idea that the altered MBP
prevents disease by calling on other specialized,
inhibitory ceils to the rescue.
The intriguing model put out by Smilek and her
colleagues is that the altered MBP molecule acts
directly on the T-h cell itself to cause it to stop the
"self," or native MBP, from being damaged. This
idea that an antigen, or protein fragment, can some
how directly turn on a switch in the T-h cell to make
the cell unresponsive is a very novel proposition.
This working hypothesis will be the basis of their

future investigations.
MS is probably a more complex and heteroge
neous disease than EAE, and the causative agent
remains unknown. In fact, perhaps one of the
biggest questions in the field is whether MS is even
caused by a faulty immune system. Conceivably, the
observed immune system abnormalities are simply a
consequence of this demyelinating disease, and not
its cause. The leading working hypothesis is certain
ly based on immune system abnormality, although
scientists have also expressed the notion that MS
may be of viral origin.
Dorfman commented that it is important to
understand that a cure is not necessarily just around
the corner because a new discovery at the basic sci
ence level may have been made. There is room for
optimism, but "people must be sort of critical and on
their guard," he added. He cautioned against raising
false hopes on the basis of potential cures.
It may be difficult to transfer these basic discover
ies to MS treatment in human beings because of the
nature of the disease. Dorfman explained that the
extremely variable course of MS makes it more diffi
cult to evaluate the performance of any treatment.
In addition, improvement of MS symptoms expe
rienced by one patient does not necessarily mean
that it is due to the actual treatment the patient
underwent. It may just have been the natural course
of the disease in that particular person.
If the reported findings turn out not to be anec
dotal, they would have considerable implications for
such other diseases as juvenile-onset diabetes and
rheumatoid arthritis.
