# Science isn't same old game, Kennedy says
## 
### Julie Makinen Editorial staff 
Editor's note: This is the second of a two-part
interview with University President Donald
Kennedy.
Q: Recently, many people have criticized
American science, saying it's slipping
behind that of other countries. People are
concerned about the increasing number of
foreign graduate students occupying spaces
in U.S. schools. Some people have quoted
enrollment rates of international students at
50 percent and 75 percent. Do you, as a sci
entist and a university official, think these
are valid criticisms?
A: I think that's just wrong. In the first
place, let me say that I do not believe that
basic research training, as it is conducted in
U.S. universities, has a lot to do with our
international economic competitiveness.
At one time, that was quite a popular
argument, but as a matter of fact, invest
ment patterns, the cost of capital, manage
ment techniques, corporate relations with
government — all of those are factors that
count for more, I think, in terms of interna
tional competitiveness than the strength of
basic research.
The fact is, it's impossible to keep secrets
any more. Nobody's going to "lock up" inno
vative technology. The "new world order" is
just too nimble for that. Communication is
too good. You can't protect a national econo
my of ideas any more than you can protect a
national monetary system in this new world.
1 think the great problems that we face,
that our technology faces, are world prob
lems. They're transboundary problems. In a
way, our international security depends upon
improving the competence of those (develop
ing) countries.. . . So, it's a small contribu
tion that we can make to alleviating a serious
maldistribution. I don't think that we should
worry about the number of foreign graduate
students in our graduate schools.
Now, let me examine the argument itself.
I think the numbers (that people quote) are
quite high. In some engineering disciplines,
the numbers may be as high as 50 percent. II
you look around Stanford, you do not find
any programs that have (even) 30 percent
foreign enrollment, particularly, very few
Ph.D. programs.
If we're wasting all this money and all this
time educating foreign graduate students,
then how come the number of scientists
doing research in this country is growing
faster than the number of taxpayers to sup
port it?
We really are producing scientists at an
unusually high rate. It can t continue for
very long that the number of people doing
publicly supported science increases at a
faster rate than the number of people who
are paying taxes to support it.

Q: Along those lines, how do you feel
about publicly supported science versus pri
vately supported science? There are many
issues, such as restricting technologies,
patenting them, withholding them from peo
ple who can't pay premium prices for them,
etc.
A: In the old days — the '60s and early
'70s — basic research mostly lived in the uni
versities. It was open, it was 95 percent pub
licly supported. The idea was then that good
ideas would emerge from this vast, publicly
supported idea factory, and then industry,
peering over the churning mass, would say,
"Ah, that looks worth developing" and would
pump a lot of private-risk capital into prod
uct development. And that was fine; every
body won.
The people who put in the risk capital
and developed the product would get
return on their risk capital, and the public
would get return because the whole inno
vation cycle works and the public gets bet
ter products. That was the idea. It made a
lot of sense.
What's happened? Well, the venture capi
tal boom in the '70s. The fact that there was
lots of growth in value during early cycles of
private investment made it profitable to try
to capture the ideas earlier in their history,
when they were still basic, so that a company
could lock up a few scientists and start a lit
tle scale-up research project.
Before you knew it, it looked as if they
were going to be able to make (for example)
a genetically engineered interferon.
All of a sudden, people were saying,
"Company X has got interferon" and then in
the next round of investment, more venture
capital would come in, these guys who were
there at the start up would make money and
then it would go public and those guys

'The fact is, it's impossi
ble to keep secrets any
more. Nobody's going to
"lock up" innovative tech
nology. The "new world
order" is just too nimble
for that.'

would make more money, all without a
product. All, just with the promise of an idea
that was going to be "big time" someday.
And so, private money got mixed up with
public money in the early phases. It was
something that people generally didn't
expect to happen. So now there really are
some conflicts — some conflicts of commit
ment on the part of university faculty who
do basic research but who also may get
caught up in the commercial incentives.
There are conflicts for universities,
which may have to sort out issues of open
ness, because the companies that have some
interest in these ideas are interested in
putting some shielding around them.
It never used to be a problem because the
segmentation of the history of an idea had a
publicly supported segment and a privately
supported segment that made sense. Now
that they're getting mixed up, there's a chal
lenge.
So, I feel wary, but I believe it will be
sorted out. There will be more private sup
port of basic research — both because pri
vate players have an interest in doing it and
because people won't say no to large
amounts of money and because the govern
ment support is trailing off.
Q: Finally, do you have any advice for
budding scientists?
A: Oh, it's just as exciting and just as ter
rific as it ever was. There's many good rea
sons for wanting to go into science. I think
that it is no longer an activity that is rela
tively uncrowded and in its dramatically
growing phase, as it was when I entered it. It
is now a complex, heavily occupied area of
human endeavor, with strong but stable or
slightly diminishing public support.
Part of the problem today is that today's
mature scientists — people my age to 10 to
15 years younger — have grown up with sci
ence growing in double digits per year in real
terms and have been given everything.
Nobody can expect that any more. Part of
the reason for a kind of "crisis of the spirit" in
American science is that a lot of people used to
having it all their own way are suddenly find
ing out what the rest of the world has known
for some time — that it isn't that easy.

public money in the early phases. It was
something that people generally didn't
expect to happen. So now there really are
some conflicts — some conflicts of commit
ment on the part of university faculty who
do basic research but who also may get
caught up in the commercial incentives.
There are conflicts for universities,
which may have to sort out issues of open
ness, because the companies that have some
interest in these ideas are interested in
putting some shielding around them.
It never used to be a problem because the
segmentation of the history of an idea had a
publicly supported segment and a privately
supported segment that made sense. Now
that they're getting mixed up, there's a chal
lenge.
So, I feel wary, but I believe it will be
sorted out. There will be more private sup
port of basic research — both because pri
vate players have an interest in doing it and
because people won't say no to large
amounts of money and because the govern
ment support is trailing off.
Q: Finally, do you have any advice for
budding scientists?
A: Oh, it's just as exciting and just as ter
rific as it ever was. There's many good rea
sons for wanting to go into science. I think
that it is no longer an activity that is rela
tively uncrowded and in its dramatically
growing phase, as it was when I entered it. It
is now a complex, heavily occupied area of
human endeavor, with strong but stable or
slightly diminishing public support.
Part of the problem today is that today's
mature scientists — people my age to 10 to
15 years younger — have grown up with sci
ence growing in double digits per year in real
terms and have been given everything.
Nobody can expect that any more. Part of
the reason for a kind of "crisis of the spirit" in
American science is that a lot of people used to
having it all their own way are suddenly find
ing out what the rest of the world has known
for some time — that it isn't that easy.


Donald Kennedy
Editor's note: This is the second of a two-part
interview with University President Donald
Kennedy.
Q: Recently, many people have criticized
American science, saying it's slipping
behind that of other countries. People are
concerned about the increasing number of
foreign graduate students occupying spaces
in U.S. schools. Some people have quoted
enrollment rates of international students at
50 percent and 75 percent. Do you, as a sci
entist and a university official, think these
are valid criticisms?
A: I think that's just wrong. In the first
place, let me say that I do not believe that
basic research training, as it is conducted in
U.S. universities, has a lot to do with our
international economic competitiveness.
At one time, that was quite a popular
argument, but as a matter of fact, invest
ment patterns, the cost of capital, manage
ment techniques, corporate relations with
government — all of those are factors that
count for more, I think, in terms of interna
tional competitiveness than the strength of
basic research.
The fact is, it's impossible to keep secrets
any more. Nobody's going to "lock up" inno
vative technology. The "new world order" is
just too nimble for that. Communication is
too good. You can't protect a national econo
my of ideas any more than you can protect a
national monetary system in this new world.
1 think the great problems that we face,
that our technology faces, are world prob
lems. They're transboundary problems. In a
way, our international security depends upon
improving the competence of those (develop
ing) countries.. . . So, it's a small contribu
tion that we can make to alleviating a serious
maldistribution. I don't think that we should
worry about the number of foreign graduate
students in our graduate schools.
Now, let me examine the argument itself.
I think the numbers (that people quote) are
quite high. In some engineering disciplines,
the numbers may be as high as 50 percent. II
you look around Stanford, you do not find
any programs that have (even) 30 percent
foreign enrollment, particularly, very few
Ph.D. programs.
If we're wasting all this money and all this
time educating foreign graduate students,
then how come the number of scientists
doing research in this country is growing
faster than the number of taxpayers to sup
port it?
We really are producing scientists at an
unusually high rate. It can t continue for
very long that the number of people doing
publicly supported science increases at a
faster rate than the number of people who
are paying taxes to support it.

Q: Along those lines, how do you feel
about publicly supported science versus pri
vately supported science? There are many
issues, such as restricting technologies,
patenting them, withholding them from peo
ple who can't pay premium prices for them,
etc.
A: In the old days — the '60s and early
'70s — basic research mostly lived in the uni
versities. It was open, it was 95 percent pub
licly supported. The idea was then that good
ideas would emerge from this vast, publicly
supported idea factory, and then industry,
peering over the churning mass, would say,
"Ah, that looks worth developing" and would
pump a lot of private-risk capital into prod
uct development. And that was fine; every
body won.
The people who put in the risk capital
and developed the product would get
return on their risk capital, and the public
would get return because the whole inno
vation cycle works and the public gets bet
ter products. That was the idea. It made a
lot of sense.
What's happened? Well, the venture capi
tal boom in the '70s. The fact that there was
lots of growth in value during early cycles of
private investment made it profitable to try
to capture the ideas earlier in their history,
when they were still basic, so that a company
could lock up a few scientists and start a lit
tle scale-up research project.
Before you knew it, it looked as if they
were going to be able to make (for example)
a genetically engineered interferon.
All of a sudden, people were saying,
"Company X has got interferon" and then in
the next round of investment, more venture
capital would come in, these guys who were
there at the start up would make money and
then it would go public and those guys

'The fact is, it's impossi
ble to keep secrets any
more. Nobody's going to
"lock up" innovative tech
nology. The "new world
order" is just too nimble
for that.'

would make more money, all without a
product. All, just with the promise of an idea
that was going to be "big time" someday.
And so, private money got mixed up with
public money in the early phases. It was
something that people generally didn't
expect to happen. So now there really are
