# Bug: Dioxin's deadly, but mailman's benign

White paper is the most environ
mentally harmful paper to pro
duce because of the bleaching pro
cess. Please recycle it. Dioxins
produced during bleaching are
the most deadly toxins known,
besides plutonium.

Q t How true is this flier? Are
• we all going to die of dioxin
poisoning and render Earth an
uninhabitable ball of mud as the
result of our academic pursuits?
Or is this just more eco-terrorist
hype from the same well-meaning
people that bring us spiked trees'?
A. Don't expect too much from
• the Bug on this one. There
are more than 17,000 studies on
the health effects of dioxin, and
the issue is far from resolved.
Except for a couple of really
nasty chemical warfare agents,
dioxin is the most deadly man
made chemical. Dioxin is 1,000
times more toxic than arsenic,
7,000 times more deadly than the
active ingredient in rat poison
and 50,000 times more lethal
than malathion (the stuff we
spray on neighborhoods to kill
fruit flies).
Plutonium is about as toxic as
dioxin. Ricin, the James Bond of
poisons, is 30 times more deadly
than dioxin, but it occurs natural
ly in castor beans (the beans that
give you more than just gas).
Most studies of dioxin toxicity
have used animals. At lethal
doses, dioxin causes a slow
painful death. However, no
humans have died from acute
dioxin poisoning. This is because
dioxin doesn't have a use.
Dioxin was never purposefully
made in large quantities. Our
planet is contaminated with diox
in because it is a by-product of
many chemical reactions. Along
with herbicides, transformer oils,
refuse burning and paper bleach
ing, we generate dioxin.
The main concern these days
is that at sub-lethal doses, dioxin
promotes cancer and birth
defects in laboratory animals. In
humans, the data are difficult to
interpret. Only workers with

The
Science
Bug

much higher exposure levels than
the general population show an
increased risk of cancer.
Part of the problem in statisti
cal analysis is the high back
ground cancer rate. One quarter
of Americans will develop cancer.
How many of these cancers are
due to dioxin? There's no precise
way of knowing.
Scientists are diligently trying
to determine how dioxin exerts
its toxic effects. Maybe once we
know what makes dioxin toxic,
we'll be able to set accurate expo
sure limits.
Until then, speaking as some
one who has already accumulated
10 pails per trillion dioxin into
her fatty tissues, I can say we
probably should try to curtail
dioxin release into the environ
ment. Does it really matter if toi
let paper is bleached pristine
white?
Q. / have brown eyes, and my
• parents both have blue eyes,
l am secure in my knowledge that
I am my parents' biological son,
but this doesn't seem to stop rela
tives from teasing me. They say I
am a genetic impossibility. How
did this happen ?
A. I can imagine a lifetime of
• milkman jokes would make
someone feel frustrated. While
two blue-eyed parents with a
brown-eyed kid is more rare than
the reverse, it is not genetically
impossible.
The pigment that colors eyes,

hair and skin is melanin. Melanin
protects against ultraviolet light
damage. Dark brown or black
eyes have lots of melanin. Green,
light brown and hazel eyes have
some. Blue eyes have very little.
Because blue eyes have only
tiny amounts of melanin, the eye
cells are essentially colorless.
These colorless cells scatter light
just as particles in the sky scatter
light. Blue eyes are blue for about
the same reason the sky is blue.
It is commonly thought that
blue eyes completely lack melanin,
and therefore, it is impossible for
two parents without melanin to
have a child with melanin.
However, only albinos com
pletely lack melanin in their eyes.
In some blue eyes, the melanin is
present in clumps of cells appear
ing as brown or yellow splotches.
This situation is analogous to
freckles — the uneven distribu
tion of melanin in skin.
Tell your relatives you don't
need to be the milkman's son to
preserve the laws of heredity.

the issue is far from resolved.
Except for a couple of really
nasty chemical warfare agents,
dioxin is the most deadly man
made chemical. Dioxin is 1,000
times more toxic than arsenic,
7,000 times more deadly than the
active ingredient in rat poison
and 50,000 times more lethal
than malathion (the stuff we
spray on neighborhoods to kill
fruit flies).
Plutonium is about as toxic as
dioxin. Ricin, the James Bond of
poisons, is 30 times more deadly
than dioxin, but it occurs natural
ly in castor beans (the beans that
give you more than just gas).
Most studies of dioxin toxicity
have used animals. At lethal
doses, dioxin causes a slow
painful death. However, no
humans have died from acute
dioxin poisoning. This is because
dioxin doesn't have a use.
Dioxin was never purposefully
made in large quantities. Our
planet is contaminated with diox
in because it is a by-product of
many chemical reactions. Along
with herbicides, transformer oils,
refuse burning and paper bleach
ing, we generate dioxin.
The main concern these days
is that at sub-lethal doses, dioxin
promotes cancer and birth
defects in laboratory animals. In
humans, the data are difficult to
interpret. Only workers with

much higher exposure levels than
the general population show an
increased risk of cancer.
Part of the problem in statisti
cal analysis is the high back
ground cancer rate. One quarter
of Americans will develop cancer.
How many of these cancers are
due to dioxin? There's no precise
way of knowing.
Scientists are diligently trying
to determine how dioxin exerts
its toxic effects. Maybe once we
know what makes dioxin toxic,
we'll be able to set accurate expo
sure limits.
Until then, speaking as some
one who has already accumulated
10 pails per trillion dioxin into
her fatty tissues, I can say we
probably should try to curtail
dioxin release into the environ
ment. Does it really matter if toi
let paper is bleached pristine
white?
Q. / have brown eyes, and my
• parents both have blue eyes,
l am secure in my knowledge that
I am my parents' biological son,
but this doesn't seem to stop rela
tives from teasing me. They say I
am a genetic impossibility. How
did this happen ?
A. I can imagine a lifetime of
• milkman jokes would make
someone feel frustrated. While
two blue-eyed parents with a
brown-eyed kid is more rare than
the reverse, it is not genetically
impossible.
The pigment that colors eyes,

hair and skin is melanin. Melanin
protects against ultraviolet light
damage. Dark brown or black
eyes have lots of melanin. Green,
light brown and hazel eyes have
some. Blue eyes have very little.
Because blue eyes have only
tiny amounts of melanin, the eye
cells are essentially colorless.
These colorless cells scatter light
just as particles in the sky scatter
light. Blue eyes are blue for about
the same reason the sky is blue.
It is commonly thought that
blue eyes completely lack melanin,
and therefore, it is impossible for
two parents without melanin to
have a child with melanin.
However, only albinos com
pletely lack melanin in their eyes.
In some blue eyes, the melanin is
present in clumps of cells appear
ing as brown or yellow splotches.
This situation is analogous to
freckles — the uneven distribu
tion of melanin in skin.
Tell your relatives you don't
need to be the milkman's son to
preserve the laws of heredity.
