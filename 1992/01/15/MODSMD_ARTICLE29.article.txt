# Estrogen therapy can cut women's heart disease risk
## 
### Joanne Adams Staff writer 
It's a myth — and a dangerous
one at that — that coronary heart
disease (CHD) is an affliction of
men and not women.
This myth has largely been per
petuated by the attention paid to
the fact that CHD generally has
an earlier onset in men. However,
CHD is the number-one killer of
women older than 55, and it's
what most women die of.
In fact, the difference in the
CHD rate between the sexes 10
years after women experience
menopause is about zero, and "90
percent of women will live 20 to 28
years past menopause," according
to Cynthia Clinkingbeard, assis
tant professor of medicine,
endocrinology, gerontology and
metabolism at the Medical Center.
It has been well established
that menopause increases the risk
of heart disease in women. Clink
ingbeard explained that the loss of
estrogen due to menopause (or
due to oophorectomy, the removal
of the ovaries) is associated with

as much as a 15 percent rise in
total cholesterol levels. High total
cholesterol is one of the major risk
factors for heart disease for both
men and women.
Women can, however, signifi
cantly benefit from hormone
replacement therapy at men
opause. Epidemiological data that
indicate estrogen replacement
therapy in menopause reduces
CHD mortality by 50 percent to 60
percent. Studies show that much,
if not all, of the reduction in risk is
due to favorable changes in
cholesterol levels.
It's alarming, however, that
"less than half of the women who
could benefit from estrogen thera
py actually get it," commented
Clinkingbeard.
Estrogen therapy is used to
treat the acute symptoms of
menopause, which may include
hot flashes, mood swings, painful
urination or painful intercourse
due to estrogen deficiency. Estro
gen therapy is also beneficial for
the more chronic condition of
osteoporosis.
Importantly, estrogen therapy

provides cardiovascular protec
tion. Clinkingbeard added that
women don't usually feel a sense
of immediacy with respect to CHD
— they are not usually experienc
ing any symptoms at the time. As
a result, she said, women are not
likely to recognize the value of
estrogen therapy for the reduction
of their CHD risk.
Fear of side effects is also a fac
tor that keeps many women from
considering estrogen therapy.
Though it has been controversial,
the prevailing wisdom is that

"estrogen therapy probably does
not increase the risk of breast can
cer," Clinkingbeard said.
According to Clinkingbeard,
women have a 2.8 percent risk of
uterine cancer, a 2.8 percent risk
of osteoporosis and a 30 percent
risk of cardiovascular heart dis
ease. Considering the odds, it's
obvious that the benefits of thera
py outweigh the risk.
"Women have got to demand
estrogen therapy. They have to be
smart," Clinkingbeard said. Physi
cians may be reluctant to prescribe
estrogen therapy, opting for the
"sins of omission" rather than the
"sins of commission," she explained.
For example, a physician might be
hard-pressed to push for estrogen
therapy if her or his patient is very
fearful of side effects.
Total cholesterol levals are a
helpful measure in assessing dis
ease risk. However, the levels of
particular cholesterol-containing
lipoproteins, like HDL-C ("good"
cholesterol) and LDL-C ("bad"
cholesterol), are more significant
indicators.
What's more, HDL-C has actu

ally proven to be a far more pow
erful predictor of heart disease in
women than in men. These valu
able lipoprotein levels can only be
determined through a fractionat
ed lipid profile, Clinkingbeard
said, which is not what you get
from a run-of the-mill massive
screening program. Triglyceride
levels are also telling — and a high
level of triglycerides has been rec
ognized as an independent risk
factor more for women than for
men.
Though there are general stan
dards of what constitutes "nor
mal" total cholesterol and triglyc
eride levels, assessment of cardio
vascular risk "needs to be individ
ualized," Clinkingbeard stressed.
When it comes to heart disease,
it is true that a woman's biological
clock ticks a little more slowly
than a man's. But there is no
doubt that being a post
menopausal woman counts as a
coronary heart disease risk factor.
The apparent good news is that
estrogen therapy can significantly
reduce that risk — and that's an
option to live by.
