Stanford's Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center is
launching several new programs
this quarter, that will focus more
on women and bisexuality.
Rachel Maddow, organizer of
the new Tuesday Night Events
series, said it was planned "so
that people of the entire Stan
ford community would know
there was a regular, established
place to go."
The series of eight programs
include a massage workshop, a
"Beginner's Guide to Queer
Clubs and Bars" and a presenta
tion on homophobia in the media
featuring national leaders of the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance
Against Defamation.
The meetings will be held
every Tuesday at 8 p.m. in the
community center.
Also, new programs geared
towards lesbian and bisexual
women kicked off last Thursday
and will continue every week.
"Last quarter we had a lot of
programs for men, but people
felt that there wasn't enough
programming for women,"

explained Troy Gilbert, adviser
to the community center.
Maddow said she hopes these
Thursday night socials, titled
"Girls' Night Out," will encour
age more women to get involved
in the community center's activ
ities. The traditional Thursday
night socials have been very
men-oriented, she said.
"There was a general feeling
that there should be more
women there to make women
feel more comfortable," Maddow
said. "So we decided to encour
age more women to attend the
Thursday night socials and
increase the women's program
ming on the whole."
Gilbert also said, "There was
a definite need for programs
addressing bisexuality," and a
new discussion group for bisexu
als will start Jan. 28.
This discussion group will
meet Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. in the
community center.
The center's Monday night
movie series will also continue
this quarter. Featured films
include "La Cage Aux Folles,"
"The Word Is Out" and"The
Times of Harvey Milk."
