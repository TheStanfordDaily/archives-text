Overseas Studies officials will pro
pose to the Cabinet's budget committee
Friday a plan to close Stanford's Sala
manca campus, redesign the program in
Florence and create new overseas cam
puses in Russia, Eastern Europe and
Latin America.
A faculty Overseas Studies program
committee decided on the recommenda
tions at its meeting Monday.
The Florence program will continue
for two years on a trial basis, said Hans
Weiler, the committee chair, but offi
cials plan to make the program more
academically rigorous, integrating it
more closely with students' study of art
and history and increasing language
requirements.
"It will be increasingly a cultural
studies program, as opposed to a general
introduction program," said Overseas
Studies Director Tom Heller. The

increased language re
quirements would not
be implemented until
fall 1993, he added.
In addition, the cam
pus will become small
er, perhaps supporting
only 15 to 25 students.
About 40 students now
attend the program.
But the Florence

campus would be closed in fall 1994 if the
changes are not successful, Weiler said.
The program in Krakow will likely be
eliminated in three to five years, Heller
said, depending on Stanford's ability to
create another program in Eastern
Europe.
"We will maintain a presence in East
ern Europe," Heller said. "However, we
would prefer to be in other places" than
Krakow, he said.
Stanford's other major overseas pro
grams — Oxford, Paris, Berlin and
Kvoto — "will continue in substantially

the same form," Heller said.
Friday's proposal will also include
the possibility of opening several new
campuses.
Potential sites include Moscow and St.
Petersburg in Russia, Budapest, Hun
gary and Mexico. The campuses could
open as early as fall 1993, Heller said.
In addition, the Santiago program
will likely be reinstated by next fall.
"The odds are very high that we will
have a program in Santiago by then,"
Heller said.
The new campuses would be finan
cially self-supporting and would not
drain operating funds from the Univer
sity, he said.
Overseas Studies' can develop new
programs in the wake of severe budget
cutbacks because it costs the University
much less to house and feed students in
low-income countries in Eastern
Europe and Latin America than on the
