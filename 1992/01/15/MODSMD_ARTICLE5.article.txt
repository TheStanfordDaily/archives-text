## Proposals on runoffs, spending limits to be considered again 
### Andy Dworkin Katie Mauro Staff writers 
The ASSU Senate last night voted
down a bill which included the elimina
tion of campaign spending limits and
run-off elections, but said they will
reconsider the bill at the next meeting.
After nearly three hours of debate,
largely over a small section of the bill
removing limits on the number of fliers
used in campaigns, the senate rejected
the election reform proposal by a 14-6
vote.
However, in the closing minutes,
undergraduate senator Raphe Beck,
who proposed a major amendment to
the bill, moved to reconsider the mea
sure at the next senate meeting.
In order to move for reconsideration
of a bill, a senator must have previously
"voted on the prevailing side," accord
ing to the ASSU bylaws.
The bill was authored by graduate

senator Doug Bone, Council of Presi
dents member John Overdeck and
Hearings Officer Jason Moore.
Discussion centered largely around
the Beck Amendment, which sought to
retain the existing campaign expense
limits. The Beck amendment was reject
ed by a vote of 12-8.
Currently, candidates for the Senate
may spend up to $60 on their campaigns
and distribute up to 500 fliers. Council
of Presidents candidates may spend
$200 per slate and distribute 750 fliers.
Candidates for senior class president
and the Student Conduct Legislative
Council can spend up to $80 and $48
and distribute up to 500 fliers and 400
fliers, respectively.
Senators argued that, by eliminating
expense limits, "whoever has the most
money will win the election," said Beck.
Proponents of spending limits argued
that if limits were eliminated as the bill
proposed, independent candidates
would not have enough money to com

pete with better-funded campaigns by
the two large parties â€” People's Plat
form and Students First.
Undergraduate senator Jason Sny
der said eliminating spending limits is
"sort of a frightening concept" which
would result in a "battle between the
haves and the have-nots."
But some senators voiced concern
that spending limits are too easily cir
cumvented or, as Bone said, "limits are
the manifestation of all evil."
Undergraduate senator David Hyatt
said regulations are useless because vio
lations are too difficult to detect.
"Campaign regulations are a
spaghetti-like mass," Hyatt said. "I
never filed a financial disclosure state
ment last year. I am an example of how
the rules are not enforced."
Council of Presidents member Beth
Morgan agreed that flier limitations are
unenforceable. Morgan said that during
last year's election, after she
photographed fliers in the
Quad in violation of campaign
rules, no penalties were levied
because the Hearings Officer
could not prove the candidate
himself was responsible for the
violation.
At times the debate became

heated, as some senators became
frustrated with the lack of fruit
ful action. Graduate senator Neil
Crellin seemed most disturbed by
the debate, arguing heatedly with
Senate Chair Kevin Warsh and
exclaiming he was "absolutely
flabbergasted by the behavior of
this body."
"Why is the ASSU Senate an
inconsequential body in the
minds of the students?" Crellin
asked. "It's because you have
these silly debates."
