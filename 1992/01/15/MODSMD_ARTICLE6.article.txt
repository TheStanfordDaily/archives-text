# Juggling: not just for clowns
## 
### Liesl Olson 
Juggling may be the cure for
any student who has thought
about clubbing their computer
after long hours in front of the
glaring screen.
"A lot of computer majors get
into juggling," said Nancy Wag
ner, who juggles with clubs.
These clubs, however, actually
look more like bowling pins
than like the caveman variety.
"Sitting at a computer all

alone makes them want to get
out in the open and do some
thing social," she said.
Wagner, a member of the
noontime Stanford Court Jug
glers, said clubs are more fun to
juggle than balls "because you
can really wing them at some
one else."
She and her tossing troupe
can be found pitching their pins
in intricate patterns almost
daily in the Quad to the amaze
ment of onlookers.

For 12 years, this voluntary
student organization has enter
tained the lunchtime crowd as
well as invited interested people
to try their hand at this skill.
"I could teach a lot of people
to juggle in about five to 10 min
utes," Wagner said. "After
learning the basic pattern, you
then need to practice to build
your skill."
