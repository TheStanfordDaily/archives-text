# Juggling: not just for clowns
## 
### Liesl Olson 
Juggling may be the cure for
any student who has thought
about clubbing their computer
after long hours in front of the
glaring screen.
"A lot of computer majors get
into juggling," said Nancy Wag
ner, who juggles with clubs.
These clubs, however, actually
look more like bowling pins
than like the caveman variety.
"Sitting at a computer all

alone makes them want to get
out in the open and do some
thing social," she said.
Wagner, a member of the
noontime Stanford Court Jug
glers, said clubs are more fun to
juggle than balls "because you
can really wing them at some
one else."
She and her tossing troupe
can be found pitching their pins
in intricate patterns almost
daily in the Quad to the amaze
ment of onlookers.

For 12 years, this voluntary
student organization has enter
tained the lunchtime crowd as
well as invited interested people
to try their hand at this skill.
"I could teach a lot of people
to juggle in about five to 10 min
utes," Wagner said. "After
learning the basic pattern, you
then need to practice to build
your skill."

Quad. Frost, a systems program coordinator in the Computer Science Department, started the
group in 1980.
tin Frost, a systems program coor
dinator in the Computer Science
Department. Influenced by the folk
dance fairs and Renaissance festi
vals that flourished in the late
19705, Martin was inspired to try
the art himself. He then started the
Stanford Court Jugglers in 1980.
"Juggling is a very good stress
reliever. It's almost like meditat
ing because it's so rhythmic,"
Wagner said. "It's also a nice
social thing, almost like a team."
The Stanford group is an affili
ate of the International Jugglers
Association, which, according to
Frost, exists "to enhance juggling
worldwide." Frost writes a column
in the magazine published by the
association, which also holds a fes
tival in North America each year.

On Saturday the Stanford
Court Jugglers will present the
"Third Seemingly-Annual Stan
ford Juggling Festival." Taking
place in Roble Gym, the free pro
gram will consist of a variety of jug
gling demonstrations open to all.
The Festival will be followed by
"A Juggling Affair" at 8 p.m. in
Cubberly Auditorium. This pro
gram will feature performances by
Bay Area jugglers, and the proceeds
will benefit the Child Advocacy
Council, an group working to pre
vent child abuse in the community.
"Since we are going to have all
of these jugglers in the Bay Area,
we thought it would be great to
put them on the stage and raise
some money," said Wagner, who
is producing the show.
The Stanford Court Jugglers
encourage others to try the sport.
Frost says that he has taught
many students on the Quad who
watch the jugglers perform.
