# NCAA changes won't hit Stanford
## 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Propositions passed by the
NCAA last week raising academic
standards for student athletes
will increase the pressure for
Stanford athletes to complete
course requirements, but will not
have an affect on admissions.
The NCAA ruled that athletes
must complete 25 percent of their
course requirements by the
beginning of their third year, 50
percent by their fourth year and
75 percent by their fifth year.
The proposition will encourage
students to "maintain a steady
pace" in accumulating units
towards a major, according to fac
ulty representative Jerry Porras,
who attended the convention
where the new standards were
set. Porras is associate dean of
the Graduate School of Business.
Stanford Athletic Director Ted
Iceland and Asst. Athletic Director
Cheryl Levick also attended the
convention, held in Anaheim, Calif.
Another change will raise the
NCAA minimum freshman eligi
bility requirements from a 2.0
GPA and a 700 SAT score to a 2.5
GPA and 700 SAT score or a 2.0
GPA and a 900 SAT.
However, the freshman eligi
bility change "won't affect Stan
ford's programs at all," since the
University's admissions requirements are
considerable higher than NCAAs, said Sue
LemMon, assistant to the athletic director.
"Stanford's criteria are Stanford's crite
ria regardless of whether they apply to
drum majors, football players or engi
neers," she said.
The new regulations also requires stu
dent athletes to earn 90 percent ol the
grade point average required to graduate
from their schools by the beginning of their
third year, and 95 percent by their fourth.
The collective NCAA proposals were dis
cussed in conferences taking place Jan. 7-

10, and a consensus opinion was submitted
as a vote. LemMon said Leland, Stanford's
voting member at the convention, support
ed the proposals.
Porras said he is "very supportive" of
the legislation. Student athletes "need to
keep in mind that the main reason they are
in school is to graduate," he said.
"Unfortunately, some are only in school
to create an academic career in hopes of
becoming professional. \ number of people
play out their eligibility, don't get degrees
but don't make it to become professional
either. These people are eventually exploit
ed by .. . the institution."
Although national graduation rates for
student athletes are "drastically low,"
Stanford maintains a "substantially high"
rate in all sports, Porras said.
