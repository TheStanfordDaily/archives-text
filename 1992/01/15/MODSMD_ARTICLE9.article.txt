Israeli-Jordanian peace talks begin
WASHINGTON (AP) — Israel and Jordan began yesterday
their first-ever formal peace talks, and Jordan said Israeli with
drawal from the West Bank would not be a precondition to peace.
As the Mideast negotiations gained momentum, Secretary of
State James Baker intervened by calling in top negotiators.
Without announcement, Baker met separately with senior
Syrian and Lebanese officials and asked the heads of the Israeli
and joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegations to come to his office
Wednesday morning "to touch base," said a U.S. official who
requested anonymity.
Antibodies may prevent AIDS in babies
BOSTON (AP) — Encouraged by new research in chimps, doc
tors plan to start a major study soon to see whether high doses of
antibodies can prevent the spread of AIDS from mothers to babies.
The chimpanzee studies show that purified doses of antibodies
taken from people who are infected with HIV can prevent the ani
mals from getting the infection, even when they are exposed to
large doses of the AIDS virus.
