University Statement on Sexual Misconduct
This is the text of a December 6, 1991 memorandum from
President Donald Kennedy to the Stanford community on
unacceptable sexual conduct at Stanford.
This memorandum reports to the Stanford community on
our procedures for dealing with unacceptable sexual behavior
at Stanford.
First, I want hereby to announce that I have approved as
University policy the following statement on Sexual assault.
Second, I want to redistribute the University's current
policy on sexual harassment. This long-standing policy,
reformulated as Administrative Guide Memorandum 23.2 in
May, 1987 and its procedures are currently being reviewed for
clarity and improvement.
Third, a staff committee is developing a comprehensive
package addressing unacceptable sexual conduct in the
broadest sense. This package is planned (1) to include an
overall statement on unacceptable sexual conduct, (2) to
incorporate the two policy statements, and (3) to provide
detailed information on resources for victims. We hope to
have drafts available in early 1992.1 will report on the results
of these efforts then.
Meanwhile, let me reiterate what I said on this subject last
September: It ought to be understood by everyone in this
community that sex by force or coercion, including deliberate
coercion through the use of drugs or alcohol, is absolutely
unacceptable here. Those who are found in violation of
University policy in this regard will face maximal
institutional sanctions, in addition to any prosecution the
District Attorney may undertake through the courts.
POLICY ON SEXUAL ASSAULT
BACKGROUND. Stanford University's policy
and procedures on sexual harassment are
published in Administrative Guide Memo 23.2
and republished annually in the Information
Bulletin and elsewhere. This statement

ONGOING CASE MANAGEMENT
PROCEDURES. Both informal procedures and
formal grievance procedures for case
management of sexual assault charges are given
in the University's Policy on Sexual Harassment
appearing as Administrative Guide Memo 23.2
and published annually in the Information
Bulletin. Victims are to be kept informed by
those responsible for those procedures of the
status of any disciplinary proceedings and the
results of any disciplinary action or appeal,
providing that the victim agrees in advance, in
writing, to treat this information as confidential.
The offices of the Dean of Students are available
to help student victims deal with academic
difficulties that may arise because of the
victimization and its impact.
INFORMATION REQUESTS AND
CONFIDENTIALITY. The University offices
responding to charges of sexual assault have
established protocols for protecting
confidentiality and for handling inquiries from
the press, concerned students and parents.
INFORMATION ABOUT OPTIONS. The
University offices responding to charges of
sexual assault will inform victims, at a
minimum, of the options of: criminal
prosecution, civil prosecution, the disciplinary
process, the appropriate grievance procedure, the
availability of mediation, alternative housing
assignments and academic assistance
alternatives.
SEXUAL HARASSMENT
POLICY
It is the policy of Stanford University to
maintain the University community as a
place of work and study for staff, faculty, and
students free of sexual harassment and all
forms of sexual intimidation and exploitation.
All students, staff, and faculty should be
aware both that the University is concerned
and prepared to take action to prevent and
correct such behavior, and that individuals
who engage in such behavior are subject to
discipline. Conduct between students is
governed by the Fundamental Standard.
The determination of what constitutes sexual
harassment will vary with the particular
circumstances, but it may be described
generally as repeated and unwanted sexual
behavior, such as physical contact and verbal
comments or suggestions, which adversely
affects the working or learning environment.
Coercive behavior, including suggestions that
academic or employment reprisals or rewards
will follow the refusal or granting of sexual
favors, constitutes gross misconduct and will
not be tolerated. In such cases, a single
incident would establish grounds for action.
Anyone who is subjected to offensive sexual
behavior is encouraged to pursue the matter
through the informal or formal procedures
described below. Generally the informal
procedures afford an opportunity to explore a
problem and consider alternative means for
its resolution.
INFORMAL PROCEDURES
a. Ombudsperson's Office Procedure —
Without feeling constrained by specific
definitions, faculty, staff and students should
feel free to make complaints concerning
allegations of sexual harassment to the Office
of the Ombudsperson. If requested,
complaints will be held in confidence, and
counseling will be provided by the
Ombudsperson's office. No investigation or
action against the person accused will be
taken on behalf of the person complaining,
however, unless the complainant consents to
be identified to the one accused in connection
with the investigation.
On the request of the person making the
complaint, the Ombudsperson will consult
with the designate of the Provost (in the case
of a member of the faculty or academic staff
charged with sexual harassment); the Vice
President responsible for the employee's
working area (in the case of a staff member
charged with sexual harassment); or the
Office of the Dean of Students (when the
person accused is a student).
Appropriate sanctions or other corrective
measures will be decided upon by these
officials, if it is determined by them that the
proscribed behavior has occurred. As in any
other case in which official action is taken, if
an accused employee disagrees with the
determination or the appropriateness of the
corrective measures, that individual may
contest them through the regular faculty or
staff grievance procedures. In the case of
students, if corrective measures are not
accepted by the student, or if disciplinary
action is considered appropriate, the student
judiciary process will be followed.
b. Other Informal Processes — Staff
complaints may also be brought to an
Employee Relations Representative in the
Personnel Office for informal handling, in
which the procedure will resemble that for
the Ombudsperson's Office described above.
Requests for confidentiality will be observed
by Employee Relations Representatives to
the extent consistent with protecting the
welfare of other employees.
All employees should also feel free to discuss
sexual harassment problems directly with
their immediate supervisors, or with the
next-level supervisors (including department
chairs and deans in the face of faculty and
academic staff), and ultimately with the
cognizant vice-president, if the situation has
not been resolved to the satisfaction of the
complainant. Supervisors have general
responsibility for the maintenance of the
working environment, and have the
authority to institute disciplinary procedures
when appropriate.
Similarly, students may wish to consult
directly with the Office of the Dean of
Students, with the supervisor of the person
complained of, or, for support and advice,
with the Title IX Officer (Sally Mahoney,
Registrar and Associate Provost), their
advisors, resident assistant, or a counselor at
Cowell Student Health Center.
FORMAL GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES
Depending on the University position of the
individual who feels he or she has been
sexually harassed and the particular
circumstances, one of the established formal
grievance procedures for faculty, staff and
students may also apply. In those cases, the
formal procedures may be used either instead
of or in conjunction with the informal
procedures. Informal procedures will NOT,
however, extend the normal time limit for
making a formal complaint. If the individual
concerned wishes to pursue the grievance, he
or she should be sure to check the rules for
the applicable procedure and file on time.
Formal grievance procedures at Stanford are:
• Nonacademic Staff Grievance Procedure
(see Guide Memo 22.10)
• Collective Bargaining Agreement for unit
members
• Academic Staff Grievance Procedure (see
Academic Staff Handbook)
• Faculty Grievance Procedure (see Guide
Memo 21.4)
• Student Academic Grievance Procedure
(see Stanford University Bulletin,
Information and Regulations Governing
Student Conduct and Procedures for Their
Enforcement
• Student Employee Grievance Procedure
(see Guide Memo 24)
• Student Nonacademic Grievance
Procedure pursuant to Title DC (consult
Sally Mahoney, Acting Vice President).
An aditional resource for Stanford
students is the Sexual Assault
Information and Resource Center,
2nd floor of Cowell Student Health
Center. The Center houses a variety
of educational materials and also
serves as the offices of three peer
education groups: REP (Rape
Education Project), Project HEAR
(Highten Education on Acquaintance
Rape), and Greek Rap (725-8891).

with the Title IX Officer (Sally Mahoney,
Registrar and Associate Provost), their
advisors, resident assistant, or a counselor at
Cowell Student Health Center.
FORMAL GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES
Depending on the University position of the
individual who feels he or she has been
sexually harassed and the particular
circumstances, one of the established formal
grievance procedures for faculty, staff and
students may also apply. In those cases, the
formal procedures may be used either instead
of or in conjunction with the informal
procedures. Informal procedures will NOT,
however, extend the normal time limit for
making a formal complaint. If the individual
concerned wishes to pursue the grievance, he
or she should be sure to check the rules for
the applicable procedure and file on time.
Formal grievance procedures at Stanford are:
• Nonacademic Staff Grievance Procedure
(see Guide Memo 22.10)
• Collective Bargaining Agreement for unit
members
• Academic Staff Grievance Procedure (see
Academic Staff Handbook)
• Faculty Grievance Procedure (see Guide
Memo 21.4)
• Student Academic Grievance Procedure
(see Stanford University Bulletin,
Information and Regulations Governing
Student Conduct and Procedures for Their
Enforcement
• Student Employee Grievance Procedure
(see Guide Memo 24)
• Student Nonacademic Grievance
Procedure pursuant to Title DC (consult
Sally Mahoney, Acting Vice President).
An aditional resource for Stanford
students is the Sexual Assault
Information and Resource Center,
2nd floor of Cowell Student Health
Center. The Center houses a variety
of educational materials and also
serves as the offices of three peer

University Statement on Sexual Misconduct
This is the text of a December 6, 1991 memorandum from
President Donald Kennedy to the Stanford community on
unacceptable sexual conduct at Stanford.
This memorandum reports to the Stanford community on
our procedures for dealing with unacceptable sexual behavior
at Stanford.
First, I want hereby to announce that I have approved as
University policy the following statement on Sexual assault.
Second, I want to redistribute the University's current
policy on sexual harassment. This long-standing policy,
reformulated as Administrative Guide Memorandum 23.2 in
May, 1987 and its procedures are currently being reviewed for
clarity and improvement.
Third, a staff committee is developing a comprehensive
package addressing unacceptable sexual conduct in the
broadest sense. This package is planned (1) to include an
overall statement on unacceptable sexual conduct, (2) to
incorporate the two policy statements, and (3) to provide
detailed information on resources for victims. We hope to
have drafts available in early 1992.1 will report on the results
of these efforts then.
Meanwhile, let me reiterate what I said on this subject last
September: It ought to be understood by everyone in this
community that sex by force or coercion, including deliberate
coercion through the use of drugs or alcohol, is absolutely
unacceptable here. Those who are found in violation of
University policy in this regard will face maximal
institutional sanctions, in addition to any prosecution the
District Attorney may undertake through the courts.
POLICY ON SEXUAL ASSAULT

ONGOING CASE MANAGEMENT
PROCEDURES. Both informal procedures and
formal grievance procedures for case
management of sexual assault charges are given
in the University's Policy on Sexual Harassment
appearing as Administrative Guide Memo 23.2
and published annually in the Information
Bulletin. Victims are to be kept informed by
those responsible for those procedures of the
status of any disciplinary proceedings and the
results of any disciplinary action or appeal,
providing that the victim agrees in advance, in
writing, to treat this information as confidential.
The offices of the Dean of Students are available
to help student victims deal with academic
difficulties that may arise because of the
victimization and its impact.
INFORMATION REQUESTS AND
CONFIDENTIALITY. The University offices
responding to charges of sexual assault have
established protocols for protecting
confidentiality and for handling inquiries from
the press, concerned students and parents.
INFORMATION ABOUT OPTIONS. The
University offices responding to charges of
sexual assault will inform victims, at a
minimum, of the options of: criminal
prosecution, civil prosecution, the disciplinary
process, the appropriate grievance procedure, the
availability of mediation, alternative housing
assignments and academic assistance
alternatives.
SEXUAL HARASSMENT
POLICY
It is the policy of Stanford University to
maintain the University community as a
place of work and study for staff, faculty, and
students free of sexual harassment and all
forms of sexual intimidation and exploitation.
All students, staff, and faculty should be
aware both that the University is concerned
and prepared to take action to prevent and
correct such behavior, and that individuals
who engage in such behavior are subject to
discipline. Conduct between students is
governed by the Fundamental Standard.
The determination of what constitutes sexual
harassment will vary with the particular
circumstances, but it may be described
generally as repeated and unwanted sexual
behavior, such as physical contact and verbal
comments or suggestions, which adversely
affects the working or learning environment.
Coercive behavior, including suggestions that
academic or employment reprisals or rewards
will follow the refusal or granting of sexual
favors, constitutes gross misconduct and will
not be tolerated. In such cases, a single
incident would establish grounds for action.
Anyone who is subjected to offensive sexual
behavior is encouraged to pursue the matter
through the informal or formal procedures
described below. Generally the informal
procedures afford an opportunity to explore a
problem and consider alternative means for
its resolution.
INFORMAL PROCEDURES
a. Ombudsperson's Office Procedure —
Without feeling constrained by specific
definitions, faculty, staff and students should
feel free to make complaints concerning
allegations of sexual harassment to the Office
of the Ombudsperson. If requested,
complaints will be held in confidence, and
counseling will be provided by the
Ombudsperson's office. No investigation or
action against the person accused will be
taken on behalf of the person complaining,
however, unless the complainant consents to
be identified to the one accused in connection
with the investigation.
On the request of the person making the
complaint, the Ombudsperson will consult
with the designate of the Provost (in the case
of a member of the faculty or academic staff
charged with sexual harassment); the Vice
President responsible for the employee's
working area (in the case of a staff member
charged with sexual harassment); or the
Office of the Dean of Students (when the
person accused is a student).
Appropriate sanctions or other corrective
measures will be decided upon by these
officials, if it is determined by them that the
proscribed behavior has occurred. As in any
other case in which official action is taken, if
an accused employee disagrees with the
determination or the appropriateness of the
corrective measures, that individual may
contest them through the regular faculty or
staff grievance procedures. In the case of
students, if corrective measures are not
accepted by the student, or if disciplinary
action is considered appropriate, the student
judiciary process will be followed.
b. Other Informal Processes — Staff
complaints may also be brought to an
Employee Relations Representative in the
Personnel Office for informal handling, in
which the procedure will resemble that for
the Ombudsperson's Office described above.
Requests for confidentiality will be observed
by Employee Relations Representatives to
the extent consistent with protecting the
welfare of other employees.
All employees should also feel free to discuss
sexual harassment problems directly with
their immediate supervisors, or with the
next-level supervisors (including department
chairs and deans in the face of faculty and
academic staff), and ultimately with the
cognizant vice-president, if the situation has
not been resolved to the satisfaction of the
complainant. Supervisors have general
responsibility for the maintenance of the
working environment, and have the
authority to institute disciplinary procedures
when appropriate.
Similarly, students may wish to consult
directly with the Office of the Dean of
Students, with the supervisor of the person
complained of, or, for support and advice,
with the Title IX Officer (Sally Mahoney,
Registrar and Associate Provost), their
advisors, resident assistant, or a counselor at
Cowell Student Health Center.

Depending on the University position of the

of a member of the faculty or academic staff
charged with sexual harassment); the Vice
President responsible for the employee's
working area (in the case of a staff member
charged with sexual harassment); or the
Office of the Dean of Students (when the
person accused is a student).
Appropriate sanctions or other corrective
measures will be decided upon by these
officials, if it is determined by them that the
proscribed behavior has occurred. As in any
other case in which official action is taken, if
an accused employee disagrees with the
determination or the appropriateness of the
corrective measures, that individual may
contest them through the regular faculty or
staff grievance procedures. In the case of
students, if corrective measures are not
accepted by the student, or if disciplinary
action is considered appropriate, the student
judiciary process will be followed.
b. Other Informal Processes — Staff
complaints may also be brought to an
Employee Relations Representative in the
Personnel Office for informal handling, in
which the procedure will resemble that for
the Ombudsperson's Office described above.
Requests for confidentiality will be observed
by Employee Relations Representatives to
the extent consistent with protecting the
welfare of other employees.
All employees should also feel free to discuss
sexual harassment problems directly with
their immediate supervisors, or with the
next-level supervisors (including department
chairs and deans in the face of faculty and
academic staff), and ultimately with the
cognizant vice-president, if the situation has
not been resolved to the satisfaction of the
complainant. Supervisors have general
responsibility for the maintenance of the
working environment, and have the
authority to institute disciplinary procedures
when appropriate.
Similarly, students may wish to consult
directly with the Office of the Dean of
Students, with the supervisor of the person
complained of, or, for support and advice,
with the Title IX Officer (Sally Mahoney,
Registrar and Associate Provost), their
advisors, resident assistant, or a counselor at
Cowell Student Health Center.
FORMAL GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES
Depending on the University position of the
individual who feels he or she has been
sexually harassed and the particular
circumstances, one of the established formal
grievance procedures for faculty, staff and
students may also apply. In those cases, the
formal procedures may be used either instead
of or in conjunction with the informal
procedures. Informal procedures will NOT,
however, extend the normal time limit for
making a formal complaint. If the individual
concerned wishes to pursue the grievance, he
or she should be sure to check the rules for
the applicable procedure and file on time.
Formal grievance procedures at Stanford are:
• Nonacademic Staff Grievance Procedure
(see Guide Memo 22.10)
• Collective Bargaining Agreement for unit
members
• Academic Staff Grievance Procedure (see
Academic Staff Handbook)
• Faculty Grievance Procedure (see Guide
Memo 21.4)
• Student Academic Grievance Procedure
(see Stanford University Bulletin,
Information and Regulations Governing
Student Conduct and Procedures for Their
Enforcement
• Student Employee Grievance Procedure
(see Guide Memo 24)
• Student Nonacademic Grievance
Procedure pursuant to Title DC (consult
Sally Mahoney, Acting Vice President).
An aditional resource for Stanford
students is the Sexual Assault
Information and Resource Center,
2nd floor of Cowell Student Health
Center. The Center houses a variety
of educational materials and also
serves as the offices of three peer
education groups: REP (Rape
Education Project), Project HEAR
(Highten Education on Acquaintance
Rape), and Greek Rap (725-8891).
University Statement on Sexual Misconduct
This is the text of a December 6, 1991 memorandum from
President Donald Kennedy to the Stanford community on
unacceptable sexual conduct at Stanford.
This memorandum reports to the Stanford community on
our procedures for dealing with unacceptable sexual behavior
at Stanford.
First, I want hereby to announce that I have approved as
University policy the following statement on Sexual assault.
Second, I want to redistribute the University's current
policy on sexual harassment. This long-standing policy,
reformulated as Administrative Guide Memorandum 23.2 in
May, 1987 and its procedures are currently being reviewed for
clarity and improvement.
Third, a staff committee is developing a comprehensive
package addressing unacceptable sexual conduct in the
broadest sense. This package is planned (1) to include an
overall statement on unacceptable sexual conduct, (2) to
incorporate the two policy statements, and (3) to provide
detailed information on resources for victims. We hope to
have drafts available in early 1992.1 will report on the results
of these efforts then.
Meanwhile, let me reiterate what I said on this subject last
September: It ought to be understood by everyone in this
community that sex by force or coercion, including deliberate
coercion through the use of drugs or alcohol, is absolutely
unacceptable here. Those who are found in violation of
University policy in this regard will face maximal
institutional sanctions, in addition to any prosecution the
District Attorney may undertake through the courts.
POLICY ON SEXUAL ASSAULT
BACKGROUND. Stanford University's policy
and procedures on sexual harassment are
published in Administrative Guide Memo 23.2
and republished annually in the Information
Bulletin and elsewhere. This statement
supplements them, providing Stanford
University's policy and procedures specifically

alternatives.
SEXUAL HARASSMENT
POLICY
It is the policy of Stanford University to
maintain the University community as a
place of work and study for staff, faculty, and
students free of sexual harassment and all
forms of sexual intimidation and exploitation.
All students, staff, and faculty should be
aware both that the University is concerned
and prepared to take action to prevent and
correct such behavior, and that individuals
who engage in such behavior are subject to
discipline. Conduct between students is
governed by the Fundamental Standard.
The determination of what constitutes sexual
harassment will vary with the particular
circumstances, but it may be described
generally as repeated and unwanted sexual
behavior, such as physical contact and verbal
comments or suggestions, which adversely
affects the working or learning environment.
Coercive behavior, including suggestions that
academic or employment reprisals or rewards
will follow the refusal or granting of sexual
favors, constitutes gross misconduct and will
not be tolerated. In such cases, a single
incident would establish grounds for action.
Anyone who is subjected to offensive sexual
behavior is encouraged to pursue the matter
through the informal or formal procedures
described below. Generally the informal
procedures afford an opportunity to explore a
problem and consider alternative means for
its resolution.
INFORMAL PROCEDURES
a. Ombudsperson's Office Procedure —
Without feeling constrained by specific
definitions, faculty, staff and students should
feel free to make complaints concerning
allegations of sexual harassment to the Office
of the Ombudsperson. If requested,
complaints will be held in confidence, and
counseling will be provided by the
Ombudsperson's office. No investigation or
action against the person accused will be
taken on behalf of the person complaining,
however, unless the complainant consents to
be identified to the one accused in connection
with the investigation.
On the request of the person making the
complaint, the Ombudsperson will consult
with the designate of the Provost (in the case
of a member of the faculty or academic staff
charged with sexual harassment); the Vice
President responsible for the employee's
working area (in the case of a staff member
charged with sexual harassment); or the
Office of the Dean of Students (when the
person accused is a student).
Appropriate sanctions or other corrective
measures will be decided upon by these
officials, if it is determined by them that the
proscribed behavior has occurred. As in any
other case in which official action is taken, if
an accused employee disagrees with the
determination or the appropriateness of the
corrective measures, that individual may
contest them through the regular faculty or
staff grievance procedures. In the case of
students, if corrective measures are not
accepted by the student, or if disciplinary
action is considered appropriate, the student
judiciary process will be followed.
