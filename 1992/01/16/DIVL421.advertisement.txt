Our Windows
have opened a lot of doors.
Microsoft's vision is clear and focused. Our
operating systems, languages, and applications
give new meaning to what personal computers
can do. Making them more personal, more
approachable - more indispensable.
Our goal is to bring technological ideas to
life in a way beyond your wildest imagination.
To explore new dimensions.
To do this we need not only the skills
of people who can write and test program
ming code, but the combined talents of a
broad range of individuals. People who can
handle product support, finance, sales, edu
cation, training, documentation, and con
sulting...professionals willing to share our
vision of the future. And to keep our
momentum going strong. The doors we
open will lead to self-discovery, adventure
and career fulfillment.
You'll find that Microsoft is a company
like no other. No suits or ties here. No corpo
rate red tape. Only the freedom to be yourself.
To do your very best...creatively, energetically
and wholeheartedly.
If you're interested in stepping into a new
world of ideas and values, come talk with us at
the Minority Engineering Job Fair.
We are an equal opportunity employer
and are working toward a more culturally
diverse workplace.
