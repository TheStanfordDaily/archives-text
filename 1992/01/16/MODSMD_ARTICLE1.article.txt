# Walsh accepts coaching offer
## Former Cardinal, 49ers leader to be named Green's successor 
### Howard Libit Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writers 
Bill Walsh is expected to be
named Stanford's new head
football coach today by Athletic
Director Ted Leland at an after
noon press conference.
Steven Kaye, Walsh's attor
ney, confirmed last night that his
client was returning to Stanford,
where he led the team to a 17-7
record and two bowl victories dur
ing the 1977 and 1978 seasons.
"Technically, he decided (to
accept the job) today, but he's
been in touch with Ted Leland
for a few days," Kaye said.
University officials refused to
confirm that Walsh, former head
coach of the San Francisco

49ers, has been hired.
"I am not confirming or deny
ing any reports you may have
received," Sports Information
Director Gary Migdol said last
night.
But when asked whether the
new head coach had been on cam
pus, Migdol replied, "Bill Walsh
has not been on campus today."
Kaye said Walsh "is just very
excited. He wants to teach, and
he wants to coach.
"He wants to contribute to
young people and teach them
football. . . . He's always had
tremendous admiration and
respect for everything Stanford
stands for," he added.
Walsh was unavailable for
comment yesterday, and Leland
refused to comment.
Stanford has reportedly offered
Walsh a five-year deal for
$350,000 per year to replace Den
nis Green, but Migdol would only
confirm the length of the contract.
Green resigned last Friday to
become head coach of the Min
nesota Vikings after leading the
Cardinal to its first bowl appear
ance since 1986.
Stanford had appeared ready
to replace Green with someone
on the current coaching staff —
either offensive coordinator Ron
Turner or defensive coordinator
Willie Shaw.
But Walsh, who led the San
Francisco 49ers to three Super
Bowl victories in 10 years and
was a television analyst on NBC
for three seasons, was a candi
date that Leland apparently
could not pass up.

Leland was an assistant to
Walsh when Walsh coached at
Stanford, and the two have
maintained both friendly and
professional ties.
Earlier this week, Walsh had
been close to accepting a job as a
consultant for the 49ers, but he
may have chosen to take the
position at Stanford so he could
train a group of assistants for
several years before assuming
command of an NFL expansion
franchise.
Walsh may already be hiring
new assistant coaches. Reports
indicate that Terry Shea, the
head coach at San Jose State,
will become Stanford's new
offensive coordinator.
But Lawrence Fan, the sports
information director at San Jose
State, said he had "no comment"
on Shea's future and that no
press conference had been
scheduled at San Jose State.

ESPN reported last night
that Walsh has hired former
NFL quarterback Gary Kubiak
as an assistant. Kubiak retired
from the Denver Broncos last
Sunday after replacing the
injured John Elway in a 10-7
loss to the Buffalo Bills in the
AFC Championship Game.
During the third quarter of
Sunday's game, Walsh praised
Kubiak's knowledge of the game
and told the national television
audience that he would recom
mend the quarterback as an
assistant at Stanford.
Walsh, who disliked recruit
ing during his previous tenure at
Stanford, reportedly will only
have to see recruits on t heir final
campus visit.
Meanwhile, it appears that
Iceland has already begun remov
ing much of Green's old staff.

Bill Walsh celebrates following the Cardinal's victory over Geor
gia in the 1978 Bluebonnet Bowl. Walsh, who led the Stanford
football team for two seasons before becoming coach of the San
Francisco 49ers, has accepted an offer to return to the Farm.
Shaw, who went through a
series of interviews with Athletic
Department officials and coach
es, faculty representatives and
players, told the media that he
was fired by Leland yesterday.
Migdol refused to confirm
Shaw's statement but did
acknowledge that Leland would
have been the one to fire Shaw if
it were true.
"I don't know what was said
between Ted (Leland) and Willie
(Shaw). But the message was not
delivered by the new head coach,"
Migdol said. He added that "all
decisions with regard to staff will
be up to the new head coach."
Migdol said the decision was
made by Leland and University
President Donald Kennedy.
"The decision was made
today, and the new head coach
has accepted," Migdol said.
Senior running back J.J.
Ijasley said he was on the play
ers' interview committee but
never met with Walsh.
"Nothing against the other two
coaches, who were very qualified,
but I said that if there was an out
side chance we could get Walsh,
we should pursue it," Lasley said

train a group of assistants for
several years before assuming
command of an NFL expansion
franchise.
Walsh may already be hiring
new assistant coaches. Reports
indicate that Terry Shea, the
head coach at San Jose State,
will become Stanford's new
offensive coordinator.
But Lawrence Fan, the sports
information director at San Jose
State, said he had "no comment"
on Shea's future and that no
press conference had been
scheduled at San Jose State.

ESPN reported last night
that Walsh has hired former
NFL quarterback Gary Kubiak
as an assistant. Kubiak retired
from the Denver Broncos last
Sunday after replacing the
injured John Elway in a 10-7
loss to the Buffalo Bills in the
AFC Championship Game.
During the third quarter of
Sunday's game, Walsh praised
Kubiak's knowledge of the game
and told the national television
audience that he would recom
mend the quarterback as an
assistant at Stanford.
Walsh, who disliked recruit
ing during his previous tenure at
Stanford, reportedly will only
have to see recruits on t heir final
campus visit.
Meanwhile, it appears that
Iceland has already begun remov
ing much of Green's old staff.

Bill Walsh celebrates following the Cardinal's victory over Geor
gia in the 1978 Bluebonnet Bowl. Walsh, who led the Stanford
football team for two seasons before becoming coach of the San
Francisco 49ers, has accepted an offer to return to the Farm.
Shaw, who went through a
series of interviews with Athletic
Department officials and coach
es, faculty representatives and
players, told the media that he
was fired by Leland yesterday.
Migdol refused to confirm
Shaw's statement but did
acknowledge that Leland would
have been the one to fire Shaw if
it were true.
"I don't know what was said
between Ted (Leland) and Willie
(Shaw). But the message was not
delivered by the new head coach,"
Migdol said. He added that "all
decisions with regard to staff will
be up to the new head coach."
Migdol said the decision was
made by Leland and University
President Donald Kennedy.
"The decision was made
today, and the new head coach
has accepted," Migdol said.
Senior running back J.J.
Ijasley said he was on the play
ers' interview committee but
never met with Walsh.
"Nothing against the other two
coaches, who were very qualified,
but I said that if there was an out
side chance we could get Walsh,
we should pursue it," Lasley said
Bill Walsh is expected to be
named Stanford's new head
football coach today by Athletic
Director Ted Leland at an after
noon press conference.
Steven Kaye, Walsh's attor
ney, confirmed last night that his
client was returning to Stanford,
where he led the team to a 17-7
record and two bowl victories dur
ing the 1977 and 1978 seasons.
"Technically, he decided (to
accept the job) today, but he's
been in touch with Ted Leland
for a few days," Kaye said.
University officials refused to
confirm that Walsh, former head
coach of the San Francisco

49ers, has been hired.
"I am not confirming or deny
ing any reports you may have
received," Sports Information
Director Gary Migdol said last
night.
But when asked whether the
new head coach had been on cam
pus, Migdol replied, "Bill Walsh
has not been on campus today."
Kaye said Walsh "is just very
excited. He wants to teach, and
he wants to coach.
"He wants to contribute to
young people and teach them
football. . . . He's always had
tremendous admiration and
respect for everything Stanford
stands for," he added.
Walsh was unavailable for
comment yesterday, and Leland
refused to comment.
Stanford has reportedly offered
Walsh a five-year deal for
$350,000 per year to replace Den
nis Green, but Migdol would only
confirm the length of the contract.
Green resigned last Friday to
become head coach of the Min
nesota Vikings after leading the
Cardinal to its first bowl appear
ance since 1986.
Stanford had appeared ready
to replace Green with someone
on the current coaching staff —
either offensive coordinator Ron
Turner or defensive coordinator
Willie Shaw.
But Walsh, who led the San
Francisco 49ers to three Super
Bowl victories in 10 years and
was a television analyst on NBC
for three seasons, was a candi
date that Leland apparently
could not pass up.

Leland was an assistant to
Walsh when Walsh coached at
Stanford, and the two have
maintained both friendly and
professional ties.
Earlier this week, Walsh had
been close to accepting a job as a
consultant for the 49ers, but he
may have chosen to take the
position at Stanford so he could
train a group of assistants for
several years before assuming
command of an NFL expansion
franchise.
