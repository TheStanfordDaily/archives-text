## Avoid food disservice 
### 
Students should receive
info on budget slashing
prior to entering draw

Last week, university
food service officials
announced proposals for
meeting their budget-reduction tar
get. The proposals included a plan
to institute mandatory, uncompen
sated hashing for residents of Row
houses that receive Food Service.
Earlier this year, Food Service
attempted to cut costs by removing
the in-house cooks from these res
idences. This change was made
abruptly, without any prior notifi
cation to residents.
Students, angered by the
decline in food quality, were also
outraged at Food Service's failure
to include them in the decision
making process or to notify them
of the change.
The conflict was resolved by
reinstating the cooks, but Food
Service should take care to avoid
shutting students out of the deci
sion-making process once again.
Food Service officials are now
saying that students must hash for
free since they insisted on getting
their cooks back. However, this con
sequence was never presented to
residents as a possible alternative,
only a mandate. It is unclear which
option students would pick were
they given an equitable choice.
In this situation, the actual
changes are less important than
the process employed in making
decisions and informing students.
The choices should be made clear
to students well before the Draw in
spring quarter. The responsibili
ties of residents, as well as the
level of service, should be well
established and unambiguous.
It is clear that Food Service
must scale back services if its bud
get-reduction target is to be met.
Short of centralization and dras
tic cutbacks, Food Service is clearly
faced with the dilemma of balancing

its budget while maintaining quali
ty service and as many salaried stu
dent hashers as possible.
If Food Service cannot handle
the financial strain of maintaining
operations in Row houses, it could
choose to allow those houses the
option of becoming co-operatives
or self-operatives and hiring their
own cooks.
If Food Service feels this would
result in too great a loss, then it
should divide the Row houses, cart
ing food from larger residence halls
to half of the houses and providing
the other half with personal cooks
in exchange for mandatory hashing
by residents. This would allow stu
dents to choose the option that bet
ter suits their needs and schedules.
Hashing may be a workable
solution for some students. While
hashing isn't glamorous, it isn't
difficult. And one hour of cleaning
with fellow residents can help
build a feeling of unity in these
houses, as it does in many co-ops
and self-ops.
One hour of hashing per week
would not overtax most students'
schedules. However, many stu
dents would seek to avoid such an
obligation in any way possible.
For these students, the inconve
nience of hashing may be more
unbearable than lukewarm food.
And when resentful residents
clean dishes, they tend to remain
quite dirty.
At those houses to which food is
carted, Food Service employees can
take care to insure that meals are
properly warmed and moderately
appetizing since all houses are
equipped with kitchen facilities.
During these tough times, it is
clear that changes are inevitable.
Also evident, however, is the need
for continued and concerted
efforts to gather student opinion
and provide students with as many
options as possible.
The changes suggested by Food
Service so far are acceptable, as
long as they are accompanied by
conscientious attempts to reduce
administrative waste and lower
food costs.
