## The 						$34 question 
### 
JANUARY IS STILL WITH US, so it
is not too late to make some New
Year's resolutions. Here are four
that the ASSU should make.
• Stop paying students to vote.
The current system is meant to lure
students into the voting booth. What an
insulting joke. Except in Chicago, buying
votes has never been the hallmark of
democracy. What possible good can it do
to pay people to push buttons they know
and care nothing about?
If the ASSU really wants to buy stu
dent participation, they should pay stu
dents $1 every time they show up to an
ASSU Senate meeting, with a 50? bonus
if there is not a quorum of senators.
Better yet, why don't we just be honest
about the whole procedure and hand every
voter a crisp $20 bill as he or she heads
away from the Macintosh? There is no good
reason to delay the payoff three months.
As any good behavioral psychologist
will tell you, immediate rewards do won
ders for behavior modification.
Speaking of psychologists, they are true
beneficiaries of this system. At least they
get to publish studies on random button
pressing behavior in the voting booth. In
our fear of unfair campaign practices, we
ensure that nobody on campus knows any
thing about the candidates. Which brings
me to my second suggestion.
• Raise campaign spending limits.
Fearing economic segregation, the sen

ate shrugged away from campaign finance
reform this week. The ASSU still holds the
paternalistic attitude that campaigning is a
dirty, distasteful task, which would too
easily corrupt innocent Stanford students.
But allowing each slate a couple hun
dred bucks and admonishing them not to
yell loudly ensures that only their room
mates will know they are running. God
forbid they might be allowed to print up a
few pamphlets describing themselves and
their opinions.
The Stanford community is too big
and scattered for the candidates to visit
every student, dorm and organization.
Let the candidates spend a little money
trying to sell themselves. Maybe we'd
even learn their names.
• Drop the line-item budget refunds.
All of the above is nothing compared to
the trouble caused by the line-item refund
fiasco. Talk about pandering to people's
worst side. We should be horribly embar
rassed to be part of a government that
every three months offers up good cold
cash if we will only, please, be selfish. Why
don't we have the folks who work the
ASSU refund table wear little red outfits
with flowing capes and hoods with horns?
Some of the more libertarian types
around here might argue that such a tax
system is the ultimate in participatory
democracy. (Did you hear the one about a
libertarian being defined as a Republican
who learned to read?)

While these populist sentiments make
for fine debating points, in reality the
system has little to do with democracy
and lots to do with students wanting to
blow an easy $34 at Miyake Sushi.
• Stop making graduate students pay
ASSU fees.
Surprisingly, the ASSU is reasonably
responsive to graduate student needs.
But the bulk of ASSU fees go to clubs and
organizations that the vast majority of
graduate students ignore.
Graduate students form an indepen
dent community at Stanford, and it is
unfair to tax them to support what is
essentially an undergraduate service
group. It would make as much sense to
levy ASSU fees on staff and faculty.
As a compromise, I propose that gradu
ate students pay a nominal fee for ASSU
administrative costs and items like legal ser
vices. Other than that, graduate students
should not be made to support a govern
ment for which they are not a constituency.
Now raise your hand if you think the
ASSU can keep these resolutions all year
long.

Daniel Rosen is a tightwad graduate stu
dent in psychology.
