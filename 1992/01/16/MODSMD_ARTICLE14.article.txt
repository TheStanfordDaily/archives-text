## Jeff Brock & Joshua Powers A 						light look at some presidential possibilities 
### 
The university has recently
received more than 350 nomina
tions for its next president. After
tossing the many nominations for Bart
Simpson and Zamfir, University officials
must by now be down to a select few.
In the interest of community service,
we have constructed our Ronco® 4-in-l
Libel Shield and put forth this list of pos
sible candidates who we feel just
wouldn't cut the presidential mustard:
• Paul Biddle: Wouldn't it be great to
be able to sue yourself for $300 million?
Talk about a conflict of interest.
• John Sununu: "Air-Sununu" hits
the Farm. You thought charging the
depreciation of a yacht was bad? An illicit
747 would create quite a stir for Rep.
John Dingell.
• Former Georgian President Gham
sakhurdia: You thought the Agenda for

Action's takeover of the president's office
was bad? Imagine 120 armed guerillas
roaming Stanford. Also, "Bob Hamrdla"
is difficult enough to pronounce.
• Mario Cuomo: Yes. No. Maybe. Wait
a minute. OK. Perhaps not. Sorry, we
just don't have the time to wait for an
answer.
• Former Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell: Unfortunately, this ultra
right-winger would offend everyone at
the University.
• Political Science Prof. John Manley:
Unfortunately, this ultra left-winger
would offend everyone else. By the way,
have you ever seen Glenn and John in the
same place at the same time? Hmm . ..
• Math Prof. James Milgram or his dog
Pooky: There are better ways to handle
the Biddle thing than a good beating
about the head and neck with a leash.

• Oliver Stone: He would rewrite Stan
ford's accounting history in a movie,
"DFK," starring Don Knotts, which
would show that the indirect-cost contro
versy was a conspiracy engineered by
Harvard, UC-Berkeley and MIT. Well,
maybe he wouldn't be such a bad idea. . . .
• Jesse Helms: Lively Arts at Stanford
would certainly prosper under the
enlightenment this man would bring to
the Farm — as long as they don't try to
get away with any Satanic productions
like that "Wizard of Oz" thing!
• George Bush: Watch out Stanford,
he's gonna hurl!
And now, to lighten up this seeming
negativity, we present a few candidates
that might get overlooked in the official
recommendation process, but who we feel
are fully up to the task.
• Dean Seldomridge from the Book

store: With her, there would be no chance
of University stock shortages. Also, her
ever-joyous demeanor wouldn't crack
under pressure of Senate subcommittees.
• Dean Jean: After a couple "Bravo!"
letters to Biddle, he would drop all
charges.
• Triumvirate of Paly High skaters:
the stadium would be turned into the
biggest skate park ever, getting more rev
enue than the football team ever has.
• The Socrates On-line Library
Research System: It's always there, will
ing to lend a helping hand, 24 hours a
day, logical and omniscient.
• Sgt. Frank Drebin, lieutenant detec
tive, Police Squad!
