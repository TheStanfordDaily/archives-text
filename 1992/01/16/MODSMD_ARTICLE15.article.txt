# Kennedy's unbalanced policies wrongly favor sports over scholarship

Where is University President Don
ald Kennedy's leadership and vision?
His administration has proposed both
the elimination of Stanford's perform
ing arts programs and deep cuts in other
areas of teaching and research.
At the same time, he has permitted
Stanford to offer a football coach
$350,000 per year. Recent research
shows that successful athletic programs
do not increase alumni contributions.
Instead, alumni, as well as faculty
and students, value maintenance of
Stanford's position as a first-rate liberal
arts research institution. Kennedy's
Philistine legacy: replacement of Stan
ford's artistic and intellectual preemi
nence with Bill Walsh.
