## Stanford catches Cal's frosh off guard, triumphs 76-61 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Three absent stars, three Stanford Pacific 10
Conference victories. With Cal star forward Brian
Hendrick out with a sprained ankle, the Cardinal
defeated the Golden Bears 76-61 in Maples Pavilion.
Hendrick, who was averaging 15 points and 10
rebounds a game, watched from the sidelines
because he had suffered lateral and medial damage
to his ankle in practice Monday afternoon. Hen
drick's absence made the game more bearable for
Stanford center Adam Keefe, who was spared the
wear-and-tear of banging inside with his foe from
across the Bay.
"He's a great player," Keefe said. "It's definitely

to our team's advantage to have him out. But we
played poorly enough to lose had he played."
The Cardinal improved to 3-0 in conference play
by again defeating an opponent minus its big gun.
Last week on the road in the Northwest, Oregon
State forward Chad Scott was declared academical
ly ineligible one half-hour before game time, and
Oregon forward Jordy Lyden was out with an
injury. Last night it was Hendrick.
"I haven't assigned a guy to (USC's Harold)
Miner yet, but we're going to work on him next
week," Stanford coach Mike Montgomery quipped.
Freshman Lamond Murray picked up some of the
slack for Cal, finishing with 26 points and 12
rebounds, but perimeter shooting from the Bear
guards was lacking. The Cardinal packed its defense
inside, forcing the Bears to beat them from long
range.
"It's like if Stanford was playing without
Keefe," Cal coach Lou Campanelli said. "They
studied us and they could close out harder on the
perimeter." Despite the 15 point win, Mont
gomery was far from satisfied. "We have to play
harder. We weren't very quick defensively. We just
know we're going to have to play better if we're
going to continue to win," he said.
Keefe added, "If we play like we played tonight
against SC and UCLA next week, they're going to be
mopping us off of the floor after the game."
