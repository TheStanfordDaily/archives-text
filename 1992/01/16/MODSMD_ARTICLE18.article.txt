# Youngsters no match for Card's 23 offensive boards
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
California started three freshmen
searching for team leadership, but it was
Stanford senior Adam Keefe who showed
them how to play.
While Cal's upperclassmen totaled nine
points, Keefe gave the Berkeley whipper
snappers a lesson in roundball in a 76-61
battering of the Bears at sold-out Maples
Pavilion. Stanford's eminent Ail-Ameri
can scored 27 points, grabbed 18 rebounds
and shook his melancholy Cardinal mates
out of a first-half slumber.
The victory gives Stanford a surprising
3-0 start in the Pacific 10 Conference, its
best since 1966-67. Ranked No. 30 in this
week's AP poll, Stanford is 11-1 overall
with a five-game win streak.
Despite playing five freshmen and with
out leading scorer Brian Hendrick, the
Bears came dangerously close to disturbing
the cruise-control Cardinal. Stanford trailed
21-15 nine minutes into the game before a
16-3 streak put them ahead for good.
"It was kind of a sick feeling," Keefe
said. "No one was really tired after the
game, no one was bleeding and it looked
like guys still had their hair combed."
"We know we'll have to play better if
we're going to keep on winning," he said.
Stanford survived a 39.4 shooting per
centage, its second worst of the season, by
dominating the glass. The Cardinal
grabbed a season-high 23 offensive
rebounds to go along with 23 defensive
boards. Center Jim Morgan, playing his
best game since losing his starting job, tal
lied a season-high seven rebounds.
Stanford also had little difficulty
against Cal's press, turning the ball over
just eight times.
The reeling Bears fall to 0-3 in the Pac
-10, 6-7 overall, despite the flashy Pac-10
debut of forward Lamond Murray.
The 6-foot-6-inch Murray, starting in
place of Hendricks, scored 26 points on
swooping dunks and leaning jumpers. His

ionospheric jam over Peter Dukes with
10:07 remaining capped a 6-0 Cal run that
cut Stanford's nine point lead to 50-48.
But the Cal comeback stalled against
the assertive leadership of Keefe. Stan
ford's indomitable power forward snagged
two steals and scored seven points in a 14-
4 Stanford run as the young Bears were
turned back.
Montgomery cleared the bench with
1:26 left, his Cardinal leading 71-58.
"It is really tough to win road games in
the Pac-10 playing with four freshmen,"
said grecian- haired Cal coach Lou Campan
elli. "We're not going to be young forever."
California's only two veterans — junior
guard Billy Dreher and senior guard Bill
Elleby — disappeared among the fresh
men. Dreher was shut out, while Elleby
scored just two points in the second half.
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery
sounded a somber note in post-game inter
views, recognizing his high-flying Cardi
nal has yet to face the Pac-10's best.
"I'm not as pleased as I'd like to be. We
didn't perform to the level that is needed
to do the job," said Montgomery, whose
troops face dangerous USC and undefeat
ed, nationally second-ranked UCLA next
week. "I don't want the kids to become
complacent and think this kind of effort
can get the job done."
