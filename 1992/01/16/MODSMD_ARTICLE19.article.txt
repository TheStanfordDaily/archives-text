# Bill and Ted back for more excellent adventures on Farm
## 
### 
Wow!
What comes next, Gorbachev
to head the Slavic department?
DeNiro to teach drama? Javier Perez de
Cuellar to take over for DK?
In one of the most shocking sports
stories in years, Bill Walsh agreed to
come back to Stanford and replace
Denny Green as head football coach.
And you shed a tear when Denny was
pulling on that purple sweater.
Bill Walsh, yes he of the three Super
Bowl rings, he of the greatest offensive
mind in the history of the game, will be
enthusiastically welcomed as he returns
to coach the team he led to two bowl
games in 1977-78.
Of course, that's no slight to coach
Green — we know he turned the Cardi
nal program into a Pac-10 power. But he
was Walsh's understudy, his disciple.
Now we've got the professor, the savior.
The official announcement will be
made today, and Walsh's contract will
reportedly call for assistant coaches to
handle the duty he found least appealing
during his 1977-78 stint on the Farm:
recruiting.
But who cares who does the recruit
ing! Those assistant coaches might never
have to leave their offices, they might
have high school stars banging down
their door. Think about it: if you were an
18-year-old player, and you had watched
Joe Montana, Jerry Rice and the likes

carry the white-haired wizard off the
field in three Super Bowls . . . wouldn't
playing for him seem like the opportuni
ty of a lifetime?
It goes without saying that handing

the reins to Walsh dramatically enhances
the Cardinal's ability to attract young
prospects. Indeed, in the eyes of high
school athletes, Stanford goes from an
enticing program on the West coast to one
of the most enticing in the country, bar
none. There's no doubt that prospective
freshman will think twice before commit
ting to the Nebraskas, Michigans and
Alabamas of the college football world
when Bill Walsh is placing phone calls to
their home.
We haven't even mentioned the extra
television exposure which becomes so
important in recruiting wars, Heisman
Trophy candidacies, and the bowl bid bat
tle. Walsh is a known commodity who
will draw viewers. It would be naive to

think that the networks won't put Stan
ford in the national spotlight: Bill Walsh
and his Stanford Cardinal vs. Defending
National Champion Washington. Bill
Walsh and his Cardinal vs. The Fighting
Irish. Bill Walsh and his Cardinal vs.
Anybixly. Stanford, simply put, will be a
draw. And in today's collegiate atmo
sphere you cannot minimize the impor
tance of that power.
As a matter of fact, our "quality aca
demic culture, alluring climate and
relaxed lifestyle" could become an
afterthought for some athletes. Which
might not be all that be bad. Maybe, just
maybe, the image of our institution has
been a tad tarnished by recent non-ath
letic events. But without a doubt Walsh's
signing is the kind of gloss which can
smooth over those rough edges.
The true reason behind Walsh's
coaching success is his offensive master
mind. Not only did he win three Super
Bowls and bring his team to the playoffs
in seven straight seasons, his proteges
have landed jobs all over the the National
Football League, as well. Green with the
Vikings, Sam Wyche with the Bucca
neers, George Seifert with the 49ers, and
Mike Holmgren with the Packers are just
a few. One word describes his coaching
style: innovation.
The perfection of the two-minute
drill? That was Walsh. The halfback
pass out of the backfield? Walsh. The

ball-control passing game? Yep, you
guessed it. And the offensive lineman as
a blocking fullback (remember the
Fridge)? That was him too, a full year
before we had ever heard of that gap
toothed kitchen appliance.
That doesn't mean that the 1992 Car
dinal is going to be a team of gimmicks.
Nor is it to say that Steve Stenstrom will
magically develop into a master of the
no-huddle offense. It does mean that
execution is a good bet, especially at the
end of the game. And Stanford fans can
look forward to pro set that will proper
ly exploit the talents of Glyn Milburn,
Stenstrom, and an enormous offensive
line.
To really put this whirlwind of events
in proper perspective, we have to take a
look at the opportunities the coach
passed up on the path that brought him
to the Farm. Obviously he had the
opportunity to remain at NBC, and
receive upwards of one million dollars
per year as an NFL analyst. And last
year, he turned down an incredibly
lucrative offer to head the Buccaneers.
Tampa Bay's owner presented Walsh a
multi-million dollar contract which gave
him absolute control of football opera
tions, on and off the field, but he refused
to sign. Just last week it was reported
that he had agreed to come back as a
(need I say, high-paid) consultant to the
49ers, but he gave up the money, the

cushy front office...to come here and
take the grinding, less lucrative position
of collegiate head coach. Walsh should
answer our questions himself when he
gets here, so to speculate as to why he
came back would be pointless.
What we don't need speculation to
discern is the "ripple effect" that
Walsh's landing at Stanford will pro
duce. The sheer name recognition he
possesses will attract attention to our
school and its athletic program, and
invariably that recognition will help
other Cardinal sports in the recruiting
process. And surely the aforementioned
television exposure and expected gate
attendance increase (after all
Walsh/49er fans are well within driving
distance of Stanford Stadium) will bring
in added revenue, which is unlikely to
draw complaints from Walsh's col
leagues.
In the midst of excitement we must
remember that Walsh has not come here
to part the seas and carry Stanford
sports to the promised land. Of course,
at least in the long run, the Cardinal will
be a much improved football team; but
his signing doesn't mean we can buy our
tickets to Pasadena quite yet.
There is a definite reason for celebra
tion, however, because the simple truth
is that Stanford athletics needed to be
put on the map, and Ted Leland showed
he's one heck of a cartographer.

In one of the most shocking sports
stories in years, Bill Walsh agreed to
come back to Stanford and replace
Denny Green as head football coach.
And you shed a tear when Denny was
pulling on that purple sweater.
Bill Walsh, yes he of the three Super
Bowl rings, he of the greatest offensive
mind in the history of the game, will be
enthusiastically welcomed as he returns
to coach the team he led to two bowl
games in 1977-78.
Of course, that's no slight to coach
Green — we know he turned the Cardi
nal program into a Pac-10 power. But he
was Walsh's understudy, his disciple.
Now we've got the professor, the savior.
The official announcement will be
made today, and Walsh's contract will
reportedly call for assistant coaches to
handle the duty he found least appealing
during his 1977-78 stint on the Farm:
recruiting.
But who cares who does the recruit
ing! Those assistant coaches might never
have to leave their offices, they might
have high school stars banging down
their door. Think about it: if you were an
18-year-old player, and you had watched
Joe Montana, Jerry Rice and the likes

carry the white-haired wizard off the
field in three Super Bowls . . . wouldn't
playing for him seem like the opportuni
ty of a lifetime?
It goes without saying that handing

the reins to Walsh dramatically enhances
the Cardinal's ability to attract young
prospects. Indeed, in the eyes of high
school athletes, Stanford goes from an
enticing program on the West coast to one
of the most enticing in the country, bar
none. There's no doubt that prospective
freshman will think twice before commit
ting to the Nebraskas, Michigans and
Alabamas of the college football world
when Bill Walsh is placing phone calls to
their home.
We haven't even mentioned the extra
television exposure which becomes so
important in recruiting wars, Heisman
Trophy candidacies, and the bowl bid bat
tle. Walsh is a known commodity who
will draw viewers. It would be naive to

think that the networks won't put Stan
ford in the national spotlight: Bill Walsh
and his Stanford Cardinal vs. Defending
National Champion Washington. Bill
Walsh and his Cardinal vs. The Fighting
Irish. Bill Walsh and his Cardinal vs.
Anybixly. Stanford, simply put, will be a
draw. And in today's collegiate atmo
sphere you cannot minimize the impor
tance of that power.
As a matter of fact, our "quality aca
demic culture, alluring climate and
relaxed lifestyle" could become an
afterthought for some athletes. Which
might not be all that be bad. Maybe, just
maybe, the image of our institution has
been a tad tarnished by recent non-ath
letic events. But without a doubt Walsh's
signing is the kind of gloss which can
smooth over those rough edges.
The true reason behind Walsh's
coaching success is his offensive master
mind. Not only did he win three Super
Bowls and bring his team to the playoffs
in seven straight seasons, his proteges
have landed jobs all over the the National
Football League, as well. Green with the
Vikings, Sam Wyche with the Bucca
neers, George Seifert with the 49ers, and
Mike Holmgren with the Packers are just
a few. One word describes his coaching
style: innovation.
The perfection of the two-minute
drill? That was Walsh. The halfback
pass out of the backfield? Walsh. The

ball-control passing game? Yep, you
guessed it. And the offensive lineman as
a blocking fullback (remember the
Fridge)? That was him too, a full year
before we had ever heard of that gap
toothed kitchen appliance.
That doesn't mean that the 1992 Car
dinal is going to be a team of gimmicks.
Nor is it to say that Steve Stenstrom will
magically develop into a master of the
no-huddle offense. It does mean that
execution is a good bet, especially at the
end of the game. And Stanford fans can
look forward to pro set that will proper
ly exploit the talents of Glyn Milburn,
Stenstrom, and an enormous offensive
line.
To really put this whirlwind of events
in proper perspective, we have to take a
look at the opportunities the coach
passed up on the path that brought him
to the Farm. Obviously he had the
opportunity to remain at NBC, and
receive upwards of one million dollars
per year as an NFL analyst. And last
year, he turned down an incredibly
lucrative offer to head the Buccaneers.
Tampa Bay's owner presented Walsh a
multi-million dollar contract which gave
him absolute control of football opera
tions, on and off the field, but he refused
to sign. Just last week it was reported
that he had agreed to come back as a
(need I say, high-paid) consultant to the
49ers, but he gave up the money, the

cushy front office...to come here and
take the grinding, less lucrative position
of collegiate head coach. Walsh should
answer our questions himself when he
gets here, so to speculate as to why he
came back would be pointless.
What we don't need speculation to
discern is the "ripple effect" that
Walsh's landing at Stanford will pro
duce. The sheer name recognition he
possesses will attract attention to our
school and its athletic program, and
invariably that recognition will help
other Cardinal sports in the recruiting
process. And surely the aforementioned
television exposure and expected gate
attendance increase (after all
Walsh/49er fans are well within driving
distance of Stanford Stadium) will bring
in added revenue, which is unlikely to
draw complaints from Walsh's col
leagues.
In the midst of excitement we must
remember that Walsh has not come here
to part the seas and carry Stanford
sports to the promised land. Of course,
at least in the long run, the Cardinal will
be a much improved football team; but
his signing doesn't mean we can buy our
tickets to Pasadena quite yet.
There is a definite reason for celebra
tion, however, because the simple truth
is that Stanford athletics needed to be
put on the map, and Ted Leland showed
he's one heck of a cartographer.
