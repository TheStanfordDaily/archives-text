# Rosse may be quitting soon
## Sources say provost to leave in April, take executive job 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Provost James Rosse, Stan
ford's second-ranking adminis
trator, may leave the University
in April to accept a chief executive
position with a Southern Califor
nia media chain.
Rosse, University President
Donald Kennedy and Ted Mitchell,
their assistant, would not com
ment on the matter. None of them
would confirm or deny that Rosse
is being considered for the post at
Freedom Newspapers Inc., based
in Irvine, Calif.
But several administrators and
faculty members confirmed that
Rosse is considered a top candi
date for the position and will very
likely announce his departure
next week.
Freedom Newspapers is a $500
million corporation that owns 27
daily newspapers — including the
Orange County (Calif.) Register
and Brownsville (Texas) Herald
— as well as 25 weeklies and five
television stations.
The chain has endured several
difficulties in the last two years,
including an attempted breakup
by a member of the family that
owns it.
The son of a newspaper editor,
Rosse is known nationally as a spe
cialist in the economics of newspa
pers and regulated mass commu
nication industries. He has taught
courses on the economics of the
mass media industry and occasion
ally addresses conventions of
newspaper editors and publishers.

Omaha Daily Journal Stockman,

Omaha World Herald and Min
neapolis Star Tribune before earn
ing three degrees in economics at
the University of Minnesota.
Many deans and other senior
administrators were informed of
the possibility of Rosse's depar
ture during the last two weeks.
Although Rosse would not con
firm the report, several people
said he would stay through mid-
April, when he and Kennedy will
propose a comprehensive budget
plan to the Board of Trustees.
Faculty and administrators
have praised Rosse for dedicating
himself to a thankless job —
spearheading the University's
attempt to cut 10 percent from its
operating budget.
"He has given exceptionally
acute and sober leadership to the


James Rosse
institution at a time of crisis,"
said Humanities and Sciences
Dean Ewart Thomas.
The University has "been held
together by the design of the con
sultative process that Jim Rosse
put in place," Thomas added.
Chemistry Prof. James Coll
man, who often challenges Rosse
on budget issues at Faculty Sen
ate meetings, said Rosse "is
known as honest, kind and
exceedingly hardworking."
Rosse "really tries to communi
cate with everyone," Collman said.
Rosse came to Stanford in 1965
as an assistant professor of eco
nomics. He served as associate dean
of Humanities and Sciences and
director of the Stanford Center for
Economic Policy Research before

taking over as provost in 1984.
Faculty members had expected
for some time that Rosse would
step down shortly after a successor
to Kennedy took office. In most
universities, the provost serves at
the pleasure of the president.
Officials would not say how a
successor to Rosse might be cho
sen, but it seems likely that an
acting provost would continue in
Rosse's position until a new pres
ident takes office.
Faculty members said last
night that Assoc. Dean of Engi
neering Charles Kruger and Busi
ness Prof. Charles Holloway
would be top candidates.
