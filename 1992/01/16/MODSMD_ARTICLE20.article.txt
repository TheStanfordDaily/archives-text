# Hemmer hammers the boards
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
When Rachel Hemmer started
at the power forward spot in the
Cardinal's exhibition game
against the South Australian All-
Stars, more than a few observers
were surprised. And they weren't
the only ones.
"Honestly, I thought it was a
joke," Hemmer said. "To be
truthful, though . . . coming in, I
did not think that I would have a
chance to be starting, and when
Tara (VanDerveer, Stanford's
coach) put me in the starting line
up I thought, well, you know, it's
just kind of a fluke or something.
And when I started the first game
it was just like, 'Wow! I can't
believe this.'
But the 6-foot-3-inch fresh
man, who says she is driven by
her perfectionism, is the kind of
hard-working player that Van-
Derveer likes. And, with Julie
Zeilstra out on a medical release,
Hemmer's skills and size helped
her earn the starting "4" spot,
where she has remained so far
this season.
"Things aren't set in stone,"
Hemmer cautions. "I mean, I
can't decide that I'm just gonna

stop working now because I have
a starting position. I still have to
keep working hard.
I give it my best all the" time.
"Some days my best is going to
be better than other days," she
adds.
Hemmer is dissatisfied with
her "best" lately — specifically
her shooting. So what is she going
to do to bring her performance up
to her perfectionist standards?
Work hard, of course.
"I guess it was two games ago,
or so, that I missed quite a few
shots, and I'm the type of person
that if I miss shots I tend to stop

shooting.... Now I stay after prac
tice to work on my offense. Tara's
got little set goals — extra goals
that if I score I get extra points,
because she really wants me to
work on my scoring."
In addition to her shooting,
Hemmer now has to work on
learning a new position.
"On offense I'm getting moved
out to the '3,' which is the wing, so
I need to work on my passing
inside and my ball handling, and
work on my scoring — facing up to
the basket, having the confidence
to take a jumper instead of always
wanting to pass it up."
