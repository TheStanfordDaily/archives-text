## 
### 
TONIGHT — 9 p.m. tip-off at Maples Pavilion, with live coverage on ESPN.
Courtside listeners can tune their Walkmen to KZSU (90.1 FM).
RECORDS - Stanford (10-1,0-1) ranked No 4; USC (8-2, 2-0 ).
PREVIOUS MEETINGS - The Trojans lead the all-time series 13-8, but the
Cardinal has won seven straight.
TROJAN TIDBITS — USC was picked to finish second in the Pac-10 in a pre
season coaches' poll, and was ranked in the preseason AP top 25. The
Trojans return five starters from last year, but are thin with only 10 players
on their roster. Lisa Leslie, a 6 foot-5-inch center, leads the Trojans in scor
ing at 21.2 ppg. Leslie, who has been called "the next Cheryl Miller" by
many, is best known for two things: her 101-point performance in one half
in a high school game, and her ability to dunk.
CARDINAL CORNER — Stanford lost its last two regular season Pac-10
games but the Cardinal has lost only eight conference games since 1987,
and has virtually owned the Pac-10.
