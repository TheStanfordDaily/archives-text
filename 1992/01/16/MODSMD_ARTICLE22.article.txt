# Pushing to realize the dream
## Commemoration of King birthday urges return to his vision 
### Anthony Shih Staff writer 
Campus and local community
leaders paid tribute to Martin
Luther King, Jr's birthday yester
day by exhorting more than 400
people in Dinkelspiel to wake up
from their complacency and fol
low King's dream of unity.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Keith Archuleta opened the pro
gram — whose theme was "Inspi
ration for Troubled Times" — by
emphasizing the need to under
stand the struggle for freedom
and dignity in the civil rights
movement and pointing out that
the fight against "racism, poverty
and militarism" is far from over.
Archuleta, who is director of
the Black Community Services
Center and chair of the King
Birthday Commemorative Com
mittee, referred to the celebra
tion of King's birthday as a
"symbol of a whole country's
search for truth"and a time to
reflect upon people's duties to
"reopen youth and live."
In the keynote address, Rev
erend Floyd Thompkins Jr. criti
cized the complacency and mate
rialism of the 1980s for bringing
what King had referred to as a

"moral midnight" during which
people became so calloused to
social problems that they began to
ignore them.
Thompkins, associate dean of
Memorial Church, spoke of the
upheavals of the 1960s that were
marked by the deaths of King,
John F. Kennedy and Robert
Kennedy. He noted that the
decade's tragic events opened the
eyes of America to its social ills
and prompted the youth into
fighting for civil rights and anti
militarism.
In contrast, Thompkins said,
the 1980s measured success
through financial yardsticks, and
the fight for social justice was cast
away as a low priority. People who
disliked hearing of tragedies
accepted this complacency and
became "acquisitive and hollow
inside," he said.
Thompkins concluded by say
ing that King began his quest to
educate the nation during the
smug 1950s — a parallel decade to
the '80s — and urged the audi
ence to follow in his legacy of
change.
Following the keynote address,
guest panelist Althea Miller, a
representative of the Local Spiri
tual Assembly of the Baha'i,

called for "unity in diversity." She
emphasized that color was not the
"source of discord," but rather
adds diversity to groups of people.
Oscar Rios, the first Latino
mayor of Watsonville, spoke of
the interrelations among the peo
ple of the world and emphasized
that in a world full of tragedy,
"there is still hope and faith in the
future."
Bacardi Jackson, chair of the
Black Student Union, spoke of the
need to carry on King's work on
campus. She cited incidences of
racism, low numbers of minority
faculty and slow progress of the
University Committee on Minority
Issues as indicative of the prob
lems that African-Americans face
on campus. Jackson urged those
students to "sacrifice immediate
gratification" and continue King's
legacy.
Lastly, Asst. Dean of Student
Affairs Jim Larimore, director of
the Native American Cultural Cen
ter, told the audience of the vision
of a multicultural community and
encouraged students to become
leaders in solving social ills.
The program also featured per
formances by the Kuumba Dance
Ensemble and Talisman, an a
cappella group.
