# INTERMISSION
## THE
						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Wooin' and Whinin' 
### 
So, Stanford's Intermission takes on dating?
Why not? Stanford's dating has been taking
an intermission for ages.
Lemme tell ya, I'm durned thrilled to write
about this topic. I'm more excited than a Sigma Chi
in a Polo shop. After all, dating is my true forte.
Heck, I'm a lover, not a writer.
I spent last quarter wooing a splendid young
lady from the Suites, but — alas — she was nothing
but wude to me in return. I was a woo-man in love.
I got woo-zy whenever I was near her. But all she
ever thought about me was, "God, what a woozer."
So now all I do is sit here rattling off old wooer
stories. I followed her around everywhere. I tagged
along when she went jogging. I brought her the
newspaper and tried not to drool on it too much. I
walked her to class. Actually, we used bikes, but if I
say I rode her to class, then she sounds like a horse.
My cool friend Slick asked if there was anything

between us. I told him I wished there wasn't (wink
wink).
I skipped classes and hid out at the post office
just so we would coincidentally run into each other.
Friends said I was crazy, sacrificing academics like
that. I guess I was putting the heart before the
course.
Finally, we rented "Casablanca" and watched it
together. 1 was sure this would make her fall head
over-heels for me. Hut her head, as with most
humans, already was over her heels, and 1 was des
tined not to make a difference. Just in case, though,
I prepared a little post-movie melody in case she
began to think too highly of me:
Just remember this,
A Chris is just a Chris
This guy is just a guy
Little did I know, as I subtly stretched my arms
during the finale, jyyyyaaaaaaawnnnnl, she had
her own little poem awaiting:
Just remember this,
A dis is just a dis
My bye is justified. . . .
It was, in fact, the beginning of a beautiful
friendship. Just friendship. I should have known
how it goes: You winsome, you lose 'em.
For a while, it was weird. I'd always dreamed of
us babbling gibberish together and calling each
other cute sugary names: my tasty Tootsie Fop
Drop, her goobery Gummy Fish, my swanky Sweet
Tart, her little Trail Mix with Carob Chips. Now
'tis not to be. Well, she called me a Nerd once, but
it just wasn't the same.
My cool friend Slick asked if she'd been a near
miss. I told him I wished she was (wink-wink). He
asked if I was ail over her. You can guess my
response.
But since then, Fve accepted I'll never be her
Romeo, her Remington Steele, her Almonzo
Wilder.
And, frankly, I'm glad nothing ever happened.
Just this week, I caught a glimpse of her report
card, and next to "SEX" she got an "F."
Moving into that subject, maybe it's just as well
that I'm single. (Yeah, yeah, that's it!) There's so
much I don't get. In fact, I'm not getting anything
these days. But that's not what I mean. For exam
ple, I was in the pharmacy yesterday and saw a new
kind of condom displayed: "TROJAN for women.'" I
don't understand things like that.
But one has to in these AIDS-related days. It's
