It was the autumn of seventh
grade. A girl I met at a Halloween
party called me the next day. She
asked me if I wanted to "go out."
I said sure. What else could I say?
After all, she looked pretty cute
dressed up as an M&M. Then
again, all that candy coating could
just have been a clever way to dis
guise a big butt. But who's that
wise in seventh grade?
So I told my parents that 1 was
going out with a girl I could only
visualize as an enormous piece of
candy. It was then that the exis
tential barrage began.
"What does this mean, this
'going out'? Where are you going
to go?"
"Well, nowhere."
"So if you don't go anywhere,
how do you know you're going
out?"
"She told me."
"Did you go somewhere so that
she could tell you that you're not
going to go anywhere?"
My parents could play this
game for hours on end, as if con
stantly acting out some kind of
Joseph Heller rewrite of a Beckett
play — at the expense of my frag
ile, adolescent ego.
But, unlike my parents, I
wasn't the least bit phased by the
fact that my new beau and I
didn't actually go anywhere. I fig
ured when I was older, I would be
able to whip out a little black
book, jump in my Edsel and pick
up whichever woman I wanted.
After all, that's what Richie
Cunningham did, and after my
awkward stage was over, I would
at least be as attractive as Ron
Howard. Worst case scenario, I
turned out to be Anson Williams
or Donny Most — and even they
got dates on the show.
But it never happened. No
black book ever appeared. No
trips to the drive-in. Nothing.
There were people I met, hut
never anyone I just called up and
asked to movies and a milkshake.
Just seedy back-alley affairs. Or
at least suburban make-out par
ties. I always got the two con
fused.
So now I've come to Stanford,
and there's no shock. The hey
days of Potsie and Ralph Malph
are far behind our society now
Dating is dead. Laughed out of
existence.
But there remains a nostalgic,
non-utilitarian need for dating in
our new society — for dressing
up, putting both elbows on the
