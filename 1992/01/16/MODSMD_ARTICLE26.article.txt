## Dating Issue Spectacular Investigating the whos, whats, whens and wheres of Stanford dating 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
It was the autumn of seventh
grade. A girl I met at a Halloween
party called me the next day. She
asked me if I wanted to "go out."
I said sure. What else could I say?
After all, she looked pretty cute
dressed up as an M&M. Then
again, all that candy coating could
just have been a clever way to dis
guise a big butt. But who's that
wise in seventh grade?
So I told my parents that 1 was
going out with a girl I could only
visualize as an enormous piece of
candy. It was then that the exis
tential barrage began.
"What does this mean, this
'going out'? Where are you going
to go?"
"Well, nowhere."
"So if you don't go anywhere,
how do you know you're going
out?"
"She told me."
"Did you go somewhere so that
she could tell you that you're not
going to go anywhere?"
My parents could play this
game for hours on end, as if con
stantly acting out some kind of
Joseph Heller rewrite of a Beckett
play — at the expense of my frag
ile, adolescent ego.
But, unlike my parents, I
wasn't the least bit phased by the
fact that my new beau and I
didn't actually go anywhere. I fig
ured when I was older, I would be
able to whip out a little black
book, jump in my Edsel and pick
up whichever woman I wanted.
After all, that's what Richie
Cunningham did, and after my
awkward stage was over, I would
at least be as attractive as Ron
Howard. Worst case scenario, I
turned out to be Anson Williams
or Donny Most — and even they
got dates on the show.
But it never happened. No
black book ever appeared. No
trips to the drive-in. Nothing.
There were people I met, hut
never anyone I just called up and
asked to movies and a milkshake.
Just seedy back-alley affairs. Or
at least suburban make-out par
ties. I always got the two con
fused.
So now I've come to Stanford,
and there's no shock. The hey
days of Potsie and Ralph Malph
are far behind our society now
Dating is dead. Laughed out of
existence.
But there remains a nostalgic,
non-utilitarian need for dating in
our new society — for dressing
up, putting both elbows on the


Mimi Kuo — Daily
table and waiting for someone to ask how
many brothers and sisters you have. A
need to order small portions and impress
that special person with the ability to
pronounce the words "Pad Thai."
Dating, then, has become a romanti
cized ideal, a Platonic form unreachable
except for the very few who are literally
forced by the words "fraternity/sorority
formal."
So, to examine this self-imposed need
in more detail, we asked some prominent
members of the Stanford community to
answer the question: What can be done to
improve upon the dating situation at
Stanford?
Their answers are as varied as are the
possible levels of incest between the char
acters on "Eight is Enough." So sit back,
grab a bottle of IBC root beer you bought
last quarter with extra points and get
ready for the ride of your life.

They picked me to write one of these
because I supposedly have a lot of knowl
edge on the subject. If that's true then
there's no wonder The Daily needs to run
an article like this. I do know that calling
this edition a "spectacular" does no jus
tice to the Doobie Brothers or Whoopi
Goldberg.
The most obvious solution would be to
get everyone equal status in the Stanford
community and have all of us in a frater
nity or sorority. But since most of us are
not cool enough to get in to such organi
zations, we must look at the facts.
I think the ones who complain about
the dating scene just don't know what
the hell they're doing. I find it best to just
shut my mouth, at least try to make a
friend along the way and simply laugh at
all the great stories about girls passing up
some of the finest guys this school has to
offer.
I must say, though, if things don't
change, Joel Stein might have to be my
date for the Viennese Ball.

Soon after settling on campus as a
wide-eyed freshman, one realizes that
Stanford University looks more and more
like a theme from John Candy's "Sum
mer Rental"; it's not all that it's cracked
up to be. Within moments, many of the
tenets which sold you onto this school
crumble before your eyes.
"Your AP credits get you out of college
courses." Yeah, right.
"There's a lake on campus for wind
surfing." Uh-huh.
And "Of course there's dating at Stan
ford." Nope, sorry. Find the pro fro host
who told you this and skewer the liar.
Ugh. But don't despair; it's not as bad
as it seems. In many ways, the "no-dat

ing" tradition is nothing more than self
perpetuating; you hear it as a frosh and
then tell it to the younger classes as they
arrive. By your senior year, you start to
believe it yourself.
And granted, there are systemic forces
to blame as well. After all, when the only
all-campus formal requires hopefuls to
sleep outdoors in sub-zero temperatures
for tickets, it's pretty easy to get discour
aged. "It's only one night anyway," one
thinks. "It's 50 bucks out the window."
"It's futile."
Wrong. One can't go through four
years at Stanford being Viennesian-blind.
(Okay, Chris Harris is my drawmate. Sue
me.) People here just have to be more
adventuresome and try something new.
It's much too easy to fall into the jaws
of complacency and just settle for what
you have rather than try for something
more. But it's also much less fun. In
order to break the cycle, one must swal
low one's pride (and wallet) and ask that
cute someone whom you never really
talked to but already love. Risk it all. Go
for it. You only live once.
You'd be surprised how just a little ini
tiative and a weird circumstance can
plunge two people down the road to
destruction as they immediately fall into
deep like with each other.
I tell you, it can happen. One of my
friends just asked somebody while wait
ing in line with me for Viennese Ball tick
ets. For him, this was the culmination of
an eternity of indecision, as he finally
bucked the Stanford conformist tide.
Slowly, he recited the words he had prac
ticed so many times. The proposal was
out there. People were watching. And the
response?
"Wait a second. Is this serious?"
Welcome to Stanford.

When Joel Stein asked me to write
about dating at Stanford I thought: Why
not? It might be entertaining to write
something apolitical for The Daily before
I graduate.
But then I realized that "dating" —
the forging of intimate personal relations
between two people — is the political
venue. Dating is riddled with power
struggles. As every person with a feminist
consciousness knows, the deeply personal
is all the more deeply political.
Power games are what we, as Stanford
students, have the most practice in. Get
ting ahead. Being on top (literally as well
as figuratively for men). Making the
grade. This is the mind set we have
learned too well.
Like tigers in the circus, we have
learned to jump through the patriarchal
hoop. It is a hoop that dictates a mas
ter/slave relationship in both heterosexu
al and homosexual relationships. (Ask
any person who has been in a same-gen
der relationship; the danger of recon
structing inequality looms at every turn
just as it does in opposite gender relation
ships.)
This is the dysfunctional model for
intimate relations that our society holds
up, and Stanford is no exception. In fact,
our institutional organization encourages
the power play. Our hierarchical system
feeds off of and perpetuates dichotomous
relationships of superiority and inferiori
ty. The rampant rate of date rape, sexual
assault, eating disorders, homophobia
and racial discrimination are just a few
examples of how messed up our personal
relations skills really are. The void in
Stanford education.
Dating is impossible to do perfectly. It
requires honesty, vulnerability and per
sonal risk in order to go anywhere, to
mean anything. It is impossible to "date,"

to get to know another person who neces
sarily holds a different perspective on the
world than you do, without living in the
moment and letting go of the outcome.
Imperfection, honesty, the letting go
of our illusion of control, the letting down
of our socially conditioned defenses —
these are not the qualities that most
Stanford students have a hell of a lot of
practice in.
If we felt comfortable with ourselves;
if we gave up the oppressive myth of
meeting THE ONE; if we loved people as
people rather than as members of a spe
cific gender, race, nationality or creed; if
we lived each day as if it were THE ONLY
ONE . .. then maybe we would figure out
that the only thing we are here to do is to
"try to love one another right now." Then
you'd see some dating action around
here.

Why is it that Stanford women com
plain incessantly about the lack of dating
here, yet they wait until the last minute
to ask a guy out for a date function or a
screw-your-roommate party?
Why is it that Stanford men can talk
for hours about that girl in their French
class, and yet the best idea for a date they
can come up with is flicks?
Maybe people are taking the mantra of
"no dating at Stanford" a little too much
too heart.
People need to get in the habit of dat
ing to get to know people better —
instead of worrying that an invitation to
a date is a "notice of intent to ask for
commitment."
Maybe it's time Stanford students stop
complaining that the party scene sucks
and that dorm parties are worthless and
start taking matters into they own hands
— and ask that someone out. Maybe even
for a night at a local cafe, to the city for a
show or a simple trip to the beach one
slow Sunday afternoon. Then again,
maybe I'll just hang out with my room
mates and complain about how few dates
we've been on.

Campus just isn't conducive to taking
someone out. Where can you go on cam
pus? The coffee house and . . . well, the
coffee house. If you don't have your own
car, you can only go out to . . . well, the
coffee house. There is a plethora of things
to do in the Bay Area, but not if you can't
get there.
Most important, we all just need to get
comfortable asking people out. I know
many friends who have agonized about
being asked out on a date because of what

it "might imply" or "lead to." But hey, it's
only a date; asking someone out doesn't
mean you've fallen in love with them.
If people could just mellow their expec
tations a little and realize a date is simply
spending time with someone and getting
to know someone new, then maybe every
one would feel safer asking people out.
Knowing that the above feeble attempt
to address the dating dilemma at Stan
ford would probably bore everyone, I
decided to poll my nine Stanford house
mates and get the consensus on the dat
ing scene. Here is the "Lodge's" top 10
ways to improve the dating scene at Stan
ford (Thanks, housemates, for getting me
off the hook.):
1. Pick classes based on male to female
ratios, and take the classes that favor
your dating prospects.
2. All long distance relationships and
"hometown honeys" should be declared
null and void when one is at school.
3. We should dress up and take dates
to all football games and kiss after every
touchdown. (Personally, I'm not so sure
about this one.)
4. Relationships should qualify for five
units on your transcript.
5. Dorms should only have co-ed
floors.
6. There should be a SWOPSI hands
on training class for dating.
7. The Daily should publish a detailed
description of the "100 Best Dates" with
step-by-step instructions for great dates.
8. You must go out on a date to qualify
for your ASSU refund.
9. Establish a new dating DR.
10. And as suggested by a friend of
mine who's slightly bitter after being
dissed last night with the weak excuse: "I
really can't because I was skiing all week
end, and I really need to catch up on work
all this week": The Daily should start a
monthly feature called "Report a Dis."
Students report the lame excuses people
used to reject a date offer. Every month,
the top 10 weak excuses are printed along
with the perpetrators' names.

There are a number of obstacles to
traditional dating here at Stanford.
First and foremost of these is that there
is nowhere to go.
The Coffee House and the Teahouse
present a somewhat limited range of
restaurant alternatives, and to go any
place else you need a car. The amount of
effort involved in going off campus is not
worth it unless there is already a sub
stantial amount of certainty in the rela
tionship.
Another obstacle might be the over
achiever syndrome — Stanford students
are used to success and afraid of failure.
This can come out as fear of asking
someone out because one is afraid of
being rejected, or the fear that if one
goes on a traditional date, things might
not go all that well and there will be no
way of getting out of it.
This makes students go on "safe
dates" — dorm outings, Flicks, sporting
events, fraternity parties — anything
where, if things aren't going well, there
might be a lot of other people to talk to.
Or maybe part of the problem is that
there is no mysteiy anymore. With co-ed
dorms, gyms and pools, students see
each other at their worst and also when
wearing minimal clothing all the time.
If we did want to revive some old-style
dating, there are several strategies we
could try. We might arrange the seating
in classes in such a way that the rows
alternated male/female and the columns
were single-sex.
This might be a problem, however, in
a lot of the techie classes that are over

whelmingly male. Or maybe we could
make dating a DK! After all, everything
else is.
But there is no scarcity of couples on
this campus. So what's the problem?
Those who want to date can go ahead
and try; they'll just probably always be
the minority. It may just be that those
who started and perpetuate the myth
that there is no dating at Stanford are
those who don't date, so they sit home
and write about it instead.

Basically, I think the lack of dating
has to do with priorities. Stanford stu
dents have more than enough activities
to fill their time, and dating just falls by
the wayside.
If a relationship drops into their laps,
that's one thing, but they won't put in
the time required to go out and meet
someone. This also helps to explain why
there are many in-dorm relationships -r
maximum return for minimum time
expended.
There is also the fact that Stanford stu
dents refuse to do anything half way.
Anything they do, they are going to do
fully and completely. Casual dating just
isn't enough. If they are going to put the
time in then it is going to be for a full
fledged relationship.
Dating is like shopping for classes. If
you don't eventually take the class, then
you've just wasted your time going to
the lecture. (Don't you just hate analo
gies that compare life to something very
mundane and stupid?)
If Stanford students wanted to date
then they would find the time for it, but
first they would have to accept the fact
that every date will not turn out to be
the next great love of their life, and some
of their time would therefore be "wast
ed."
Life's full of tough decisions.

I think that if Stanford had more
"non-pressure" outlets for people to
meet one another, the dating situation
could be greatly improved.
By non-pressure, I mean situations
where sex isn't the underlying tone, or
the expectation of the evening.
I also think that if there were more
things to do on campus with a date, then
things would be better. If you don't have
a car, it is difficult to take a date out to a
nice dinner, or out to a movie. It would
be great if there was something special
that you could take a date to on campus
besides Flicks!
