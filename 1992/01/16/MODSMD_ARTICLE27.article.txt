# Finding a nice, quiet spot to get down
## 
### Kimberly Chrisman Staff writer 
While the Quad, the Dish and
the ever-popular Rodin Sculpture
Garden have become almost syn
onymous with dating at Stanford,
an unofficial Daily survey recent
ly revealed that our sex-starved
students will do the wild thang
just about anywhere, from the
Foothills to the Hand Shak.
Whether in line at Old Union,
atop the parking structures or
behind the screen at ASSU Sun
day Flicks, romance is alive and
well on the Farm, if you know
where to look for it.
Maybe it's the groovy echo
effect, but bathrooms and show
ers consistently topped stu
dents' lists of favorite breeding
venues. Honorable mention goes
to the infamous Theta Chi
shower, the Governor's Corner
bathtubs and the SAE hot tub —

or, for the conservation-minded,
the ATO sauna.
Terman Pond, the only foun
tain on campus containing actual
water, is also recommended —
that is, if you don't mind the slime
and peeping engineers. And not
even the drought can dampen the
appeal of Lake Lag, whose sloping
shores and discreet trails literally
ooze sensual ambiance.
If you like to move up and
down, you'll love the wide array of
elevators at Stanford. Littlefield
Management Center boasts the
slowest elevator on campus, but
Hoover Tower's is a longer ride.
Although most students chose
"my room" as the most comfort
able and convenient dating desti
nation, some of us have room
mates. But, as one especially con
scientious student remarked,
"that's what study rooms are for."
Indeed, most campus resi
dences are veritable playgrounds

of lusty abandon. Kimball Hall
features spacious sundecks
strewn with oversized lounge
chairs, Crothers has its own pri
vate library and Wilbur even
sports a pottery room — remem
ber the movie "Ghost"?
If nature turns you on, Webb
Ranch promises beautiful scenery
and that indefinable off-campus
mystique. A closer and more PC
alternative is Red Barn, home of
the Stanford Stables. "You can
take apples from Food Service and
feed the horses," said one animal
loving undergraduate.
What could be more romantic,
except possibly a night under the
stars in the Foothills? A word of
warning: "Bring a sleeping bag, or
else you'll freeze your butt off."
Ditto the golf course, Frost
Amphitheater, Stanford Stadium
and — for all you nocrophiliacs
out there — the Mausoleum.
Ultimately, vour choice of

place is as personal as your choice
of partner. The editor in chiefs
couch has long been the makeout
spot of choice for Daily staffers,
while KZSU deejays make beauti
ful music together in subter
ranean antenna tunnels beneath
Memorial Auditorium.
Others find inspiration in
Stanford's oh-so-romantic steam
tunnels, where your chances of
getting laid are only slightly
worse than your chances of get
ting arrested by flashlight-wield
ing community service officers.
Even with these options, how
ever, some students remain cyni
cal. Perhaps the most typical
response to the question of locali
ty was, "How the hell should I
know? I'm a graduate student/EE
mt\jor!" To those students, I offer
the words of one wise classmate
who thinks that the best place to
have sex on campus is "at another
university."
