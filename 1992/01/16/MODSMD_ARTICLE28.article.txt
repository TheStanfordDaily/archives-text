# Sans car, sans date, sans any play
## 
### Janine DeFao Senior staff writer 
Ever since you set eyes on
that cute guy in your Hum Sex
class, you've wanted to ask him
out.
But not just for fro yo or a hot
study session in Meyer. You
really want to sweep him off his
feet. You have in mind the per
fect date — a panoramic view, a
gorgeous sunset, a delicious
meal, maybe a bottle of wine.
But without a car, your hopes
have been dashed. How could you
possibly have a great date on
campus?
Actually, the only wheels you
need in order to have that per
fect outing are the ones on your
bike. Try a sunset picnic at the

Dish for an atmosphere for which
lucky car owners would pay
much more in the City.
The Rodin Sculpture Garden
is also a great, low-budget set
ting for a romantic meal on a
lazy weekend afternoon.
The athletic sort can try a
(long) bike ride up Skyline
Boulevard for a great view, or
bike, rollerblade, play tennis, jog
or work out closer to home.
For those with a mind for ath
letics, but maybe not the body,
take in an invigorating Stanford
basketball game at home.
And while weekend nights on
the Farm may leave something
to be desired for would-be Juli
ets, there are a few campus clas
sics to fall back on.
Flicks, of course, is always a

safe first date. And now Stan
ford offers nearly as many
options as nearby theaters, with
Sunday, Friday and even Tues
day — for the more adventurous
— film series to choose from.
And there's always the Coffee
House for a bite to eat, a cappuc
cino or a beer, as well as enter
tainment some nights of the
week, like jazz on Thursdays.
For those yearning for the
City's cultural treats, Stanford
often has its own symphonies
and theater productions — with
in walking distance and at a frac
tion of San Francisco's prices.
But if the wealth of options on
campus isn't enough for the
more free-wheeling, there are
plenty of dates to be had just a
short bike ride or longer walk

away.
Just up Palm Drive, there are
three movie theaters and
numerous restaurants catering
to a wide range of tastes and
budgets. There are even more
restaurants in the Stanford
Shopping Center and in Town
and Country Village.
Even a date within view of the
Golden Gate is possible for those
who thought they'd be stuck in
the shadow of Hoover Tower.
SamTrans and Cal Train will
provide the wheels for you. A
round-trip bus ride from Stan
ford Shopping Center costs only
$3.50 per person, and the train,
leaving from the University
Avenue station, costs $5.25.
And if all else fails, you can
always borrow a car.
