# Not just for griping anymore
## Using dormitory food to spice up your sex 
### Ed Heinemann Staff writer 
So what do you do when your
editor — desperate to demonstrate
his oh-so-cutting-edge sense of
journalism, and just a little too tit
illated at the thought of Mickey
Kourke's slimy little paws smear
ing tuna fish on Kim Basinger's
kneecaps — asks you to write an
art icle on the use of Food Service
entrees in sex?
Ask him to subsidize the
research, of course.
It was with no small trepidation
that I entered the Wilbur "dining"
facility one bleak afternoon in
December. My editor (I'll call him
"Joel Stein"), after telling me that
his sister wasn't quite old enough
for that kind of thing and that Paul
Biddle wasn't returning calls of a
romantic nature, had set me up
with my second-alternate dream
date: Clarabelle, the Queen of
Manzanita.
Clarabelle was a legend. She'd
mastered the art of whipping up a
mean pickle and onion souffle on
her trailer's ancient stove without
blowing up the refrigerator; she
could kill mutant ants, stray cats
and engineering grad students by
the thousands with her bare
hands; and she knew exactly
where to tap the trailer walls to set
the place vibrating and thus enliv
en any Friday night.
So I was intimidated. And I fig
ured that she probably didn't even
like me and was only there for the
free (and cooked-just-like-home!)
meal. But I soon found that my
fears were groundless. As I stum
bled into the Madera dining room,
Clarabelle rose like a vision from a
sea of sideburned-and-Bart Simp
son-T-shirt-clad frosh, sidled up to
me and whispered in my ear that
she'd heard that baked spaghetti
was an aphrodisiac.
I was in heaven! I immediately
disrobed, leaped atop the salad bar
and shouted "Feed me, Pookums!"
Several KAs quickly mobilized,
rounded up the confused frosh
into manageable herds and ran
like hell. But the Food Service
employees, like their brethren in

efficiency at the Postal Service,
stayed on to do their job in spite of
rain, sleet and a screaming naked
man and eagerly commenced to
ply Clarabelle and myself with
their luscious wares.
First came the walnut loaf. Sex
ual tension hung palpable in the
air like a teddy bear dangling from
a window as first Clarabelle took a
bite, then I took a bite, then we
both swallowed. We smiled, and as
we picked undigestible walnut
chunks out of each other's teeth
with our tongues, the hashers
went wild.
To my consternation, the sec
ond course wasn't nearly as suc
cessful as the first. The head chef
himself brought us two oatburgers
on a bed of lettuce that he had spe
cially culled from under the Jell-o
blocks in Kicker, but the presenta
tion couldn't make up for an
inherent lack of je ne sais quoi and
other French terms.
Our only consolation was that
the chef was willing to bring us
another oatburger so we could
play that stupid hockey game you
usually play with nickels when
your third-grade teacher goes off
on phonics again.
But the date was salvaged by a
gesture of genius for which I will
eternally be indebted to the chef.
He brought us each a chicken
chimichanga, escorted the hashers
out of the room and locked the
door behind him.
The shell tasted like cardboard,
the chicken was pasty and the rest
of the filling bore a strong resem
blance to pus, but as the light —
and heart-healthy! — coconut oil
garnish dripped from our chins
and slithered its way down our
bodies, our eyes were set a-twin
kle, and the sneeze guard started

squeaking.
I'll leave the rest to your sordid
little imaginations. All I know is
that with Clarabelle in my arms,
I'll never have to make my own
burger again.
