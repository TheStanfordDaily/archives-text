# ONE YEAR LATER: THE WAR'S COSTS
## War reporting now called into question Analysts say coverage lacked bite 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
During the past two weeks, a
rapid succession of stories have
appeared that call into question
the national media's performance
in covering the Persian Gulf War.
The stories — from the scaled
down estimates of the Patriot mis
sile's effectiveness to the revelation
that some Iraqi atrocities reported
during the occupation of Kuwait
were exaggerated — have one thing
in common, according to scholars
and journalists. They highlight the
media's unquestioning, "press
release" reporting of the war.
The result of that trend, media
observers say, was coverage that
failed to adequately provide the
public with the news it needed to
make decisions about the war.
"If the media's role is to pro
vide a forum for democratic
debate, it failed abysmally," said
Jim Naureckas, editor in chief of
"Extra" magazine, a publication
of Fairness and Accuracy in
Reporting, a Washington, D.C.-
based media watchdog organiza
tion. "But if the media's role is to
rally support for the government's
policies, it did a very good job."
During the war, the Defense
Department imposed strict con
trols on what the press could see,
and military censors checked
nearly every story from the field.
However, most observers say the
media still deserves much of the
blame for its one-sided coverage;
it should have fought more when
the Pentagon clamped down.
"The press was much too cow

ardly in how it approached cover
ing the war," said Communication
Assoc. Prof. Ted Glasser. "They
were not very aggressive or
assertive. They did not turn it into
a major first amendment issue, as
it should have been."
Instead, observers say, a
"technophilia" pervaded the
national media's coverage of the
war, particularly on the network
news — which endlessly replayed
shots of "smart" bombs homing in
on their targets — and in news
magazines like Time and
Newsweek, which ran spreads
detailing the "tools of war," rather
than examining the policy ques
tions in-depth.
A 4 Pac-Man' war
"The press showed us a steril
ized war, a technological 'Pac-
Man' war," said Assoc. Communi
cation Prof. Jeremy Cohen. "It
made it possible to believe that
there weren't casualties."
It was only after the war that
the U.S. public began to see its
human costs. Some estimates of
combined military and civilian
Iraqi casualties have placed the
number as high as 200,000. The
U.S. Air Force recently released
statistics showing that only 9 per
cent of the 84,200 tons of bombs
dumped on Iraq and Kuwait were
smart bombs.
Although the smart bombs had
an accuracy rate of 90 percent, the
remaining 76,800 tons of bombs
were only 25 percent accurate.
The Patriot missile, too, has

Prisoner of war
This photo, depicting the charred body of an Iraqi soldier attempting
to escape from his burning truck, provoked a storm of protest when
it was published in The London Observer on March 3. Many thought
the image was too graphic, and it was pulled from the Associated
Press wire by a New York editor. But Harold Evans, a former editor of
The Times of London, defended the photo in The Observer a week
later. "It was a solitary individual in the transfixation of a hideous
death," Evans wrote. "Before this, it had been possible to enjoy the
lethal felicity of designer bombs as some kind of video game."
