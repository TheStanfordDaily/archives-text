# ONE YEAR LATER: THE WAR'S COSTS
## War reporting now called into question Analysts say coverage lacked bite 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
During the past two weeks, a
rapid succession of stories have
appeared that call into question
the national media's performance
in covering the Persian Gulf War.
The stories — from the scaled
down estimates of the Patriot mis
sile's effectiveness to the revelation
that some Iraqi atrocities reported
during the occupation of Kuwait
were exaggerated — have one thing
in common, according to scholars
and journalists. They highlight the
media's unquestioning, "press
release" reporting of the war.
The result of that trend, media
observers say, was coverage that
failed to adequately provide the
public with the news it needed to
make decisions about the war.
"If the media's role is to pro
vide a forum for democratic
debate, it failed abysmally," said
Jim Naureckas, editor in chief of
"Extra" magazine, a publication
of Fairness and Accuracy in
Reporting, a Washington, D.C.-
based media watchdog organiza
tion. "But if the media's role is to
rally support for the government's
policies, it did a very good job."
During the war, the Defense
Department imposed strict con
trols on what the press could see,
and military censors checked
nearly every story from the field.
However, most observers say the
media still deserves much of the
blame for its one-sided coverage;
it should have fought more when
the Pentagon clamped down.
"The press was much too cow

ardly in how it approached cover
ing the war," said Communication
Assoc. Prof. Ted Glasser. "They
were not very aggressive or
assertive. They did not turn it into
a major first amendment issue, as
it should have been."
Instead, observers say, a
"technophilia" pervaded the
national media's coverage of the
war, particularly on the network
news — which endlessly replayed
shots of "smart" bombs homing in
on their targets — and in news
magazines like Time and
Newsweek, which ran spreads
detailing the "tools of war," rather
than examining the policy ques
tions in-depth.
A 4 Pac-Man' war
"The press showed us a steril
ized war, a technological 'Pac-
Man' war," said Assoc. Communi
cation Prof. Jeremy Cohen. "It
made it possible to believe that
there weren't casualties."
It was only after the war that
the U.S. public began to see its
human costs. Some estimates of
combined military and civilian
Iraqi casualties have placed the
number as high as 200,000. The
U.S. Air Force recently released
statistics showing that only 9 per
cent of the 84,200 tons of bombs
dumped on Iraq and Kuwait were
smart bombs.
Although the smart bombs had
an accuracy rate of 90 percent, the
remaining 76,800 tons of bombs
were only 25 percent accurate.
The Patriot missile, too, has

Prisoner of war
This photo, depicting the charred body of an Iraqi soldier attempting
to escape from his burning truck, provoked a storm of protest when
it was published in The London Observer on March 3. Many thought
the image was too graphic, and it was pulled from the Associated
Press wire by a New York editor. But Harold Evans, a former editor of
The Times of London, defended the photo in The Observer a week
later. "It was a solitary individual in the transfixation of a hideous
death," Evans wrote. "Before this, it had been possible to enjoy the
lethal felicity of designer bombs as some kind of video game."
recently been revealed as less
effective in intercepting Iraqi
Scuds than had been previously
thought. The Defense Depart
ment now claims that only 50 per
cent of Scuds aimed at Israel, and
70 percent aimed at Saudi Arabia,
were successfully intercepted.
"We heard that smart bombs
were revolutionizing the war, but
that was really garbage," Nau
reckas said. "The Patriot actually
failed a large percentage of the
time — even against the Scud, a
very primitive missile."
Another example of the Ameri
can media's reluctance to portray
the human costs of the war was
the controversy over a photo that
appeared in The London Observ
er during the war, but was held
out of U.S. publications until
after the war.
The photo, depicting the
charred body of an Iraqi soldier
trying to escape from his burning
truck, was pulled from the Associ
ated Press wire by a New York
editor. When The Observer pub
lished the photo on March 3, the
image provoked a storm of protest
from some members of the media
who said it was too graphic.
But Harold Evans, the publish
er and president of Random
House and a former editor of The
Times of London, wrote a defense
of the photo that appeared in The
Observer a week later.
"It was a solitary individual in
the transfixation of a hideous
death," Evans wrote. "Before this,
it had been possible to enjoy the
lethal felicity of designer bombs as
some kind of video game."
Reporters 'cowboying around'
JuJu Chang, an ABC News
producer who graduated from
Stanford in 1987, said the media
— especially the television media
— overemphasized the technolog
ical aspects of the war.
"We had a hard time getting
the human side," Chang said.
"The video was very sexy, but
that wasn't the complete story."
Chang blamed the Pentagon's
pool system, which restricted

reporters to areas chosen by mili
tary escorts, for the absence of
graphic battle footage.
The controls were frustrating
to reporters who attempted to
determine the effects of the war
at the front, Chang said. The only
correspondents who obtained
footage other than that dictated
by the military, she said, were
those who went "cowboying
around" — such as ABC's Forrest
Sawyer, who "mounted a satellite
dish on a flatbed truck and went
along with Egyptian troops," and
CBS's Bob Simon, who was cap
tured by Iraqi troops.
But some media observers —
and many in the general public —
believe the controls were neces
sary to protect U.S. troops.
"There has been far too much
carping by the media about how
they didn't get their way," said
Brant Baker, the executive direc
tor of the Media Research Center,
an organization based in Alexan
dria, Va. that he said is "dedicated
to exposing and documenting
incidences of liberal media bias."
Baker said it was absolutely
necessary for the military to
tightly censor press coverage dur
ing the war.
"All you need is one person in
the press who is irresponsible and
it would cost hundreds of lives,"
he said. "It's better to err on the
side of caution."
A Times-Mirror poll conducted
on Feb. 12-13 found that 68 percent
of those questioned thought the
degree of military censorship was
"about right," while another 17 per
cent thought there should have
been "more" censorship. Only 13
percent thought there should have
been "less" military censorship.
Of those who were aware of the
military's press pool system, 86
percent said the pools "served the
public interest" either "well" or
"fairly well."
"The public simply wanted to
win a war," Cohen said. "The
public was clamoring for CNN
coverage and not much more."
'Cheerleading' for U.S. military
The media's emphasis on tech
nology, observers say, overshad
owed the political debate about
the war — especially after the war
began.
"There was an awful lot of
cheerleading for the U.S. military
and too little emphasis on Iraqi
deaths," said Dan Amundson,
research director at the Center
for Media and Public Affairs, a
Washington, D.C.-based organi
zation that examines national
coverage of public policy.
"The media rarely challenged
what the government was saying
or doing," Cohen said. "What we
got was a lot of rockets and Patri
ot missiles. It was exciting, but it
didn't really tell us much about
American policy."
Part of the problem, according
to Glasser, is that the media has a
tendency to focus on events, _____
rather than the larger
issues, in its coverage.

"The big challenge for
the press has always been
to sustain a foreign policy
debate independent of dra
matic events," Glasser
said. "Without the events,
for instance, we know very
little about Iraq or Iran."
Glasser believes the
press, particularly the tele
vision news, did a poor job
of explaining the cultural
and historical background

of the Middle East.
Much of the reason for
that weakness, observers say, lies
in the media's generally poor
knowledge of the region. Because
very few of the reporters covering
the war understood the geopoli
tics or religious politics of the
Middle East — or even the lan
guage — reporters had to rely on
the military's daily press confer
ences.
"What we had was a lot of high
priced talent sitting around to do
things that could have been done
by people in their first month of
work," Amundson said. "Good
journalism is more than showing
up at the right briefings."
The public, however, seemed
content with the coverage of the
war. The Times-Mirror poll found
that 83 percent of those ques
tioned thought the press coverage
was "good" or "excellent," while
72 percent thought the television
news reporters "dug harder" than

print journalists to cover the war.
An 'operational bias'
Janet Steele, an assistant pro
fessor in the University of Vir
ginia's Rhetoric and Communica
tion Department, conducted a
study of the networks' use of
"experts" to discuss the issues
involved in the war.
The networks used the term
"experts" rather loosely, she
argued, applying it to anyone
from former secretaries of state to
members of small, "quasi-aca
demic" think tanks. And, she
said, the networks made too much
use of "unofficial sources" — for
mer military or political leaders
who played no role in the current
administration.
The networks were inconsis
tent in identifying these sources,
Steele noted. News programs
often failed to cite which adminis-

trations these guests had previ
ously been affiliated with — a fact
that would have helped viewers in
determining their political slant.
"The blanket term 'Middle
East expert' can mean anything,"
Steele said. "Frequently these
people did have biases."
Steele used Vanderbilt Univer
sity's "Television News Index and
Abstract" — which documents
each episode of the network news
and Ted Koppel's "Nightline" pro
gram — to track the appearances
of the "unofficial sources" between
August 1990 and March 1991.
She found that members of
think tanks — who have usually
had connections to previous
administrations and represent
institutions with a pronounced
political bias — were invited back
far more often than other sources,
such as academics who specialize
in the Middle East. Only 188 indi

viduals accounted for 843 appear
ances, Steele determined.
After interviewing a number of
network news producers, Steele
concluded that an "operational
bias" existed in the networks' cov
erage. The producers wanted pre
dictions and concise, snappy
statements — two things that
academics, who often encouraged
looking at the complexities and
historical background of the situ
ation — were reluctant to do.
The result, Steele said, was
"skewed coverage" of the war.
The network producers, she said,
"wanted someone who is a 'play
er' rather than someone who has,
as one producer said, 'book
knowledge.' "
The news programs, according
to Steele, rarely invited guests who
talked about the history of the Mid
dle East and its tradition of fuzzy
border claims and centuries-long

grudges.
"As a historian, I would
have liked to see more
background. We never had
a sense of context about
why Saddam Hussein
invaded Kuwait," Steele
said. "This war looked like
it took place in a vacuum."
Making their case
Most observers agree
that the press, if it is to
improve its coverage, must
stand up more firmly to
government intrusions.
_ "The press needs to
reassess its independence
from the Pentagon," Glasser said.
"They need to assert their case
assertively on the editorial pages."
But Naureckas discounts the
ability of the mainstream press to
improve its coverage. "No doubt
when the next war comes, they'll
hold their objections until after
the war," he said.
Instead, Naureckas believes
that alternative publications —
like his own — must "make it
clear to the media that this kind
of coverage was not what people
needed or expected."
The lesson of the war, Glasser
said, is a first amendment one.
The war raised a vital issue —
how free a free press should be.
"The Gulf War was a very vivid
reminder that we have a fair press
only under certain circum
stances," Glasser said. "It
reminded us that our press isn't
as free as we thought it was."

During the past two weeks, a
rapid succession of stories have
appeared that call into question
the national media's performance
in covering the Persian Gulf War.
The stories — from the scaled
down estimates of the Patriot mis
sile's effectiveness to the revelation

time — even against the Scud, a
very primitive missile."
Another example of the Ameri
can media's reluctance to portray
the human costs of the war was
the controversy over a photo that
appeared in The London Observ
er during the war, but was held
out of U.S. publications until
after the war.
The photo, depicting the
charred body of an Iraqi soldier
trying to escape from his burning
truck, was pulled from the Associ
ated Press wire by a New York
editor. When The Observer pub
lished the photo on March 3, the
image provoked a storm of protest
from some members of the media
who said it was too graphic.
But Harold Evans, the publish
er and president of Random
House and a former editor of The
Times of London, wrote a defense
of the photo that appeared in The
Observer a week later.
"It was a solitary individual in
the transfixation of a hideous
death," Evans wrote. "Before this,
it had been possible to enjoy the
lethal felicity of designer bombs as
some kind of video game."
Reporters 'cowboying around'
JuJu Chang, an ABC News
producer who graduated from
Stanford in 1987, said the media
— especially the television media
— overemphasized the technolog
ical aspects of the war.
"We had a hard time getting
the human side," Chang said.
"The video was very sexy, but
that wasn't the complete story."
Chang blamed the Pentagon's
pool system, which restricted

reporters to areas chosen by mili
tary escorts, for the absence of
graphic battle footage.
The controls were frustrating
to reporters who attempted to
determine the effects of the war
at the front, Chang said. The only
correspondents who obtained
footage other than that dictated
by the military, she said, were
those who went "cowboying
around" — such as ABC's Forrest
Sawyer, who "mounted a satellite
dish on a flatbed truck and went
along with Egyptian troops," and
CBS's Bob Simon, who was cap
tured by Iraqi troops.
But some media observers —
and many in the general public —
believe the controls were neces
sary to protect U.S. troops.
"There has been far too much
carping by the media about how
they didn't get their way," said
Brant Baker, the executive direc
tor of the Media Research Center,
an organization based in Alexan
dria, Va. that he said is "dedicated
to exposing and documenting
incidences of liberal media bias."
Baker said it was absolutely
necessary for the military to
tightly censor press coverage dur
ing the war.
"All you need is one person in
the press who is irresponsible and
it would cost hundreds of lives,"
he said. "It's better to err on the
side of caution."
A Times-Mirror poll conducted
on Feb. 12-13 found that 68 percent
of those questioned thought the
degree of military censorship was
"about right," while another 17 per
cent thought there should have
been "more" censorship. Only 13
percent thought there should have
been "less" military censorship.
Of those who were aware of the
military's press pool system, 86
percent said the pools "served the
public interest" either "well" or
"fairly well."
"The public simply wanted to
win a war," Cohen said. "The
public was clamoring for CNN
coverage and not much more."
'Cheerleading' for U.S. military
The media's emphasis on tech
nology, observers say, overshad
owed the political debate about
the war — especially after the war
began.
"There was an awful lot of
cheerleading for the U.S. military
and too little emphasis on Iraqi
deaths," said Dan Amundson,
research director at the Center
for Media and Public Affairs, a
Washington, D.C.-based organi
zation that examines national
coverage of public policy.
"The media rarely challenged
what the government was saying
or doing," Cohen said. "What we
got was a lot of rockets and Patri
ot missiles. It was exciting, but it
didn't really tell us much about
American policy."
Part of the problem, according
to Glasser, is that the media has a
tendency to focus on events, _____
rather than the larger
issues, in its coverage.

"The big challenge for
the press has always been
to sustain a foreign policy
debate independent of dra
matic events," Glasser
said. "Without the events,
for instance, we know very
little about Iraq or Iran."
Glasser believes the
press, particularly the tele
vision news, did a poor job
of explaining the cultural
and historical background

of the Middle East.
Much of the reason for
that weakness, observers say, lies
in the media's generally poor
knowledge of the region. Because
very few of the reporters covering
the war understood the geopoli
tics or religious politics of the
Middle East — or even the lan
guage — reporters had to rely on
the military's daily press confer
ences.
"What we had was a lot of high
priced talent sitting around to do
things that could have been done
by people in their first month of
work," Amundson said. "Good
journalism is more than showing
up at the right briefings."
The public, however, seemed
content with the coverage of the
war. The Times-Mirror poll found
that 83 percent of those ques
tioned thought the press coverage
was "good" or "excellent," while
72 percent thought the television
news reporters "dug harder" than

print journalists to cover the war.
An 'operational bias'
Janet Steele, an assistant pro
fessor in the University of Vir
ginia's Rhetoric and Communica
tion Department, conducted a
study of the networks' use of
"experts" to discuss the issues
involved in the war.
The networks used the term
"experts" rather loosely, she
argued, applying it to anyone
from former secretaries of state to
members of small, "quasi-aca
demic" think tanks. And, she
said, the networks made too much
use of "unofficial sources" — for
mer military or political leaders
who played no role in the current
administration.
The networks were inconsis
tent in identifying these sources,
Steele noted. News programs
often failed to cite which adminis-

trations these guests had previ
ously been affiliated with — a fact
that would have helped viewers in
determining their political slant.
"The blanket term 'Middle
East expert' can mean anything,"
Steele said. "Frequently these
people did have biases."
Steele used Vanderbilt Univer
sity's "Television News Index and
Abstract" — which documents
each episode of the network news
and Ted Koppel's "Nightline" pro
gram — to track the appearances
of the "unofficial sources" between
August 1990 and March 1991.
She found that members of
think tanks — who have usually
had connections to previous
administrations and represent
institutions with a pronounced
political bias — were invited back
far more often than other sources,
such as academics who specialize
in the Middle East. Only 188 indi

viduals accounted for 843 appear
ances, Steele determined.
After interviewing a number of
network news producers, Steele
concluded that an "operational
bias" existed in the networks' cov
erage. The producers wanted pre
dictions and concise, snappy
statements — two things that
academics, who often encouraged
looking at the complexities and
historical background of the situ
ation — were reluctant to do.
The result, Steele said, was
"skewed coverage" of the war.
The network producers, she said,
"wanted someone who is a 'play
er' rather than someone who has,
as one producer said, 'book
knowledge.' "
The news programs, according
to Steele, rarely invited guests who
talked about the history of the Mid
dle East and its tradition of fuzzy
border claims and centuries-long

grudges.
"As a historian, I would
have liked to see more
background. We never had
a sense of context about
why Saddam Hussein
invaded Kuwait," Steele
said. "This war looked like
it took place in a vacuum."
Making their case
Most observers agree
that the press, if it is to
improve its coverage, must
stand up more firmly to
government intrusions.
_ "The press needs to
reassess its independence
from the Pentagon," Glasser said.
"They need to assert their case
assertively on the editorial pages."
But Naureckas discounts the
ability of the mainstream press to
improve its coverage. "No doubt
when the next war comes, they'll
hold their objections until after
the war," he said.
Instead, Naureckas believes
that alternative publications —
like his own — must "make it
clear to the media that this kind
of coverage was not what people
needed or expected."
The lesson of the war, Glasser
said, is a first amendment one.
The war raised a vital issue —
how free a free press should be.
"The Gulf War was a very vivid
reminder that we have a fair press
only under certain circum
stances," Glasser said. "It
reminded us that our press isn't
as free as we thought it was."

During the past two weeks, a
rapid succession of stories have
appeared that call into question
the national media's performance
in covering the Persian Gulf War.
The stories — from the scaled
down estimates of the Patriot mis
sile's effectiveness to the revelation
that some Iraqi atrocities reported
during the occupation of Kuwait
were exaggerated — have one thing
in common, according to scholars
and journalists. They highlight the
media's unquestioning, "press
release" reporting of the war.
The result of that trend, media
observers say, was coverage that
failed to adequately provide the
public with the news it needed to
make decisions about the war.
"If the media's role is to pro
vide a forum for democratic
debate, it failed abysmally," said
Jim Naureckas, editor in chief of
"Extra" magazine, a publication
of Fairness and Accuracy in
Reporting, a Washington, D.C.-
based media watchdog organiza
tion. "But if the media's role is to
rally support for the government's
policies, it did a very good job."
During the war, the Defense
Department imposed strict con
trols on what the press could see,
and military censors checked
nearly every story from the field.
However, most observers say the
media still deserves much of the
blame for its one-sided coverage;
it should have fought more when
the Pentagon clamped down.
"The press was much too cow

ardly in how it approached cover
ing the war," said Communication
Assoc. Prof. Ted Glasser. "They
were not very aggressive or
assertive. They did not turn it into
a major first amendment issue, as
it should have been."
Instead, observers say, a
"technophilia" pervaded the
national media's coverage of the
war, particularly on the network
news — which endlessly replayed
shots of "smart" bombs homing in
on their targets — and in news
magazines like Time and
Newsweek, which ran spreads
detailing the "tools of war," rather
than examining the policy ques
tions in-depth.
A 4 Pac-Man' war
"The press showed us a steril
ized war, a technological 'Pac-
Man' war," said Assoc. Communi
cation Prof. Jeremy Cohen. "It
made it possible to believe that
there weren't casualties."
It was only after the war that
the U.S. public began to see its
human costs. Some estimates of
combined military and civilian
Iraqi casualties have placed the
number as high as 200,000. The
U.S. Air Force recently released
statistics showing that only 9 per
cent of the 84,200 tons of bombs
dumped on Iraq and Kuwait were
smart bombs.
Although the smart bombs had
an accuracy rate of 90 percent, the
remaining 76,800 tons of bombs
were only 25 percent accurate.
The Patriot missile, too, has

to Glasser, is that the media has a
tendency to focus on events, _____
rather than the larger
issues, in its coverage.

"The big challenge for
the press has always been
to sustain a foreign policy
debate independent of dra
matic events," Glasser
said. "Without the events,
for instance, we know very
little about Iraq or Iran."
Glasser believes the
press, particularly the tele
vision news, did a poor job
of explaining the cultural
and historical background

of the Middle East.
Much of the reason for
that weakness, observers say, lies
in the media's generally poor
knowledge of the region. Because
very few of the reporters covering
the war understood the geopoli
tics or religious politics of the
Middle East — or even the lan
guage — reporters had to rely on
the military's daily press confer
ences.
"What we had was a lot of high
priced talent sitting around to do
things that could have been done
by people in their first month of
work," Amundson said. "Good
journalism is more than showing
up at the right briefings."
The public, however, seemed
content with the coverage of the
war. The Times-Mirror poll found
that 83 percent of those ques
tioned thought the press coverage
was "good" or "excellent," while
72 percent thought the television
news reporters "dug harder" than

print journalists to cover the war.
An 'operational bias'
Janet Steele, an assistant pro
fessor in the University of Vir
ginia's Rhetoric and Communica
tion Department, conducted a
study of the networks' use of
"experts" to discuss the issues
involved in the war.
The networks used the term
"experts" rather loosely, she
argued, applying it to anyone
from former secretaries of state to
members of small, "quasi-aca
demic" think tanks. And, she
said, the networks made too much
use of "unofficial sources" — for
mer military or political leaders
who played no role in the current
administration.
The networks were inconsis
tent in identifying these sources,
Steele noted. News programs
often failed to cite which adminis-

trations these guests had previ
ously been affiliated with — a fact
that would have helped viewers in
determining their political slant.
"The blanket term 'Middle
East expert' can mean anything,"
Steele said. "Frequently these
people did have biases."
Steele used Vanderbilt Univer
sity's "Television News Index and
Abstract" — which documents
each episode of the network news
and Ted Koppel's "Nightline" pro
gram — to track the appearances
of the "unofficial sources" between
August 1990 and March 1991.
She found that members of
think tanks — who have usually
had connections to previous
administrations and represent
institutions with a pronounced
political bias — were invited back
far more often than other sources,
such as academics who specialize
in the Middle East. Only 188 indi

viduals accounted for 843 appear
ances, Steele determined.
After interviewing a number of
network news producers, Steele
concluded that an "operational
bias" existed in the networks' cov
erage. The producers wanted pre
dictions and concise, snappy
statements — two things that
academics, who often encouraged
looking at the complexities and
historical background of the situ
ation — were reluctant to do.
The result, Steele said, was
"skewed coverage" of the war.
The network producers, she said,
"wanted someone who is a 'play
er' rather than someone who has,
as one producer said, 'book
knowledge.' "
The news programs, according
to Steele, rarely invited guests who
talked about the history of the Mid
dle East and its tradition of fuzzy
border claims and centuries-long

grudges.
"As a historian, I would
have liked to see more
background. We never had
a sense of context about
why Saddam Hussein
invaded Kuwait," Steele
said. "This war looked like
it took place in a vacuum."
Making their case
Most observers agree
that the press, if it is to
improve its coverage, must
stand up more firmly to
government intrusions.
_ "The press needs to
reassess its independence
from the Pentagon," Glasser said.
"They need to assert their case
assertively on the editorial pages."
But Naureckas discounts the
ability of the mainstream press to
improve its coverage. "No doubt
when the next war comes, they'll
hold their objections until after
the war," he said.
Instead, Naureckas believes
that alternative publications —
like his own — must "make it
clear to the media that this kind
of coverage was not what people
needed or expected."
The lesson of the war, Glasser
said, is a first amendment one.
The war raised a vital issue —
how free a free press should be.
"The Gulf War was a very vivid
reminder that we have a fair press
only under certain circum
stances," Glasser said. "It
reminded us that our press isn't
as free as we thought it was."

During the past two weeks, a
rapid succession of stories have
appeared that call into question
the national media's performance
in covering the Persian Gulf War.
The stories — from the scaled
down estimates of the Patriot mis
sile's effectiveness to the revelation
that some Iraqi atrocities reported
during the occupation of Kuwait
were exaggerated — have one thing
in common, according to scholars
and journalists. They highlight the
media's unquestioning, "press
release" reporting of the war.
The result of that trend, media
observers say, was coverage that
failed to adequately provide the
public with the news it needed to
make decisions about the war.
"If the media's role is to pro
vide a forum for democratic
debate, it failed abysmally," said
Jim Naureckas, editor in chief of
"Extra" magazine, a publication
of Fairness and Accuracy in
Reporting, a Washington, D.C.-
based media watchdog organiza
tion. "But if the media's role is to
rally support for the government's
policies, it did a very good job."
During the war, the Defense
Department imposed strict con
trols on what the press could see,
and military censors checked
nearly every story from the field.
However, most observers say the
media still deserves much of the
blame for its one-sided coverage;
it should have fought more when
the Pentagon clamped down.
"The press was much too cow

ardly in how it approached cover
ing the war," said Communication
Assoc. Prof. Ted Glasser. "They
were not very aggressive or
assertive. They did not turn it into
a major first amendment issue, as
it should have been."
Instead, observers say, a
"technophilia" pervaded the
national media's coverage of the
war, particularly on the network
news — which endlessly replayed
shots of "smart" bombs homing in
on their targets — and in news
magazines like Time and
Newsweek, which ran spreads
detailing the "tools of war," rather
than examining the policy ques
tions in-depth.
A 4 Pac-Man' war
"The press showed us a steril
ized war, a technological 'Pac-
Man' war," said Assoc. Communi
cation Prof. Jeremy Cohen. "It
made it possible to believe that
there weren't casualties."
It was only after the war that
the U.S. public began to see its
human costs. Some estimates of
combined military and civilian
Iraqi casualties have placed the
number as high as 200,000. The
U.S. Air Force recently released
statistics showing that only 9 per
cent of the 84,200 tons of bombs
dumped on Iraq and Kuwait were
smart bombs.
Although the smart bombs had
an accuracy rate of 90 percent, the
remaining 76,800 tons of bombs
were only 25 percent accurate.
The Patriot missile, too, has

Prisoner of war
This photo, depicting the charred body of an Iraqi soldier attempting
to escape from his burning truck, provoked a storm of protest when
it was published in The London Observer on March 3. Many thought
the image was too graphic, and it was pulled from the Associated
Press wire by a New York editor. But Harold Evans, a former editor of
The Times of London, defended the photo in The Observer a week
later. "It was a solitary individual in the transfixation of a hideous
death," Evans wrote. "Before this, it had been possible to enjoy the

recently been revealed as less
effective in intercepting Iraqi
Scuds than had been previously
thought. The Defense Depart
ment now claims that only 50 per
cent of Scuds aimed at Israel, and
70 percent aimed at Saudi Arabia,
were successfully intercepted.
"We heard that smart bombs
were revolutionizing the war, but
that was really garbage," Nau
reckas said. "The Patriot actually
failed a large percentage of the
time — even against the Scud, a
very primitive missile."
Another example of the Ameri
can media's reluctance to portray
the human costs of the war was
the controversy over a photo that
appeared in The London Observ
er during the war, but was held
out of U.S. publications until
after the war.
The photo, depicting the
charred body of an Iraqi soldier
trying to escape from his burning
truck, was pulled from the Associ
ated Press wire by a New York
editor. When The Observer pub
lished the photo on March 3, the
image provoked a storm of protest
from some members of the media
who said it was too graphic.
But Harold Evans, the publish
er and president of Random
House and a former editor of The
Times of London, wrote a defense
of the photo that appeared in The
Observer a week later.
"It was a solitary individual in
the transfixation of a hideous
death," Evans wrote. "Before this,
it had been possible to enjoy the
lethal felicity of designer bombs as
some kind of video game."
Reporters 'cowboying around'
JuJu Chang, an ABC News
producer who graduated from
Stanford in 1987, said the media
— especially the television media
— overemphasized the technolog
ical aspects of the war.
"We had a hard time getting
the human side," Chang said.
"The video was very sexy, but
that wasn't the complete story."
Chang blamed the Pentagon's
pool system, which restricted

reporters to areas chosen by mili
tary escorts, for the absence of
graphic battle footage.
The controls were frustrating
to reporters who attempted to
determine the effects of the war
at the front, Chang said. The only
correspondents who obtained
footage other than that dictated
by the military, she said, were
those who went "cowboying
around" — such as ABC's Forrest
Sawyer, who "mounted a satellite
dish on a flatbed truck and went
along with Egyptian troops," and
CBS's Bob Simon, who was cap
tured by Iraqi troops.
But some media observers —
and many in the general public —
believe the controls were neces
sary to protect U.S. troops.
"There has been far too much
carping by the media about how
they didn't get their way," said
Brant Baker, the executive direc
tor of the Media Research Center,
an organization based in Alexan
dria, Va. that he said is "dedicated
to exposing and documenting
incidences of liberal media bias."
Baker said it was absolutely
necessary for the military to
tightly censor press coverage dur
ing the war.
"All you need is one person in
the press who is irresponsible and
it would cost hundreds of lives,"
he said. "It's better to err on the
side of caution."
A Times-Mirror poll conducted
on Feb. 12-13 found that 68 percent
of those questioned thought the
degree of military censorship was
"about right," while another 17 per
cent thought there should have
been "more" censorship. Only 13
percent thought there should have
been "less" military censorship.
Of those who were aware of the
military's press pool system, 86
percent said the pools "served the
public interest" either "well" or
"fairly well."
"The public simply wanted to
win a war," Cohen said. "The
public was clamoring for CNN
coverage and not much more."
'Cheerleading' for U.S. military
The media's emphasis on tech
nology, observers say, overshad
owed the political debate about
the war — especially after the war
began.
"There was an awful lot of
cheerleading for the U.S. military
and too little emphasis on Iraqi
deaths," said Dan Amundson,
research director at the Center
for Media and Public Affairs, a
Washington, D.C.-based organi
zation that examines national
coverage of public policy.
"The media rarely challenged
what the government was saying
or doing," Cohen said. "What we
got was a lot of rockets and Patri
ot missiles. It was exciting, but it
didn't really tell us much about
American policy."
Part of the problem, according
to Glasser, is that the media has a
tendency to focus on events, _____
rather than the larger
issues, in its coverage.

"The big challenge for

Making their case
Most observers agree
that the press, if it is to
improve its coverage, must
stand up more firmly to
government intrusions.
_ "The press needs to
reassess its independence
from the Pentagon," Glasser said.
"They need to assert their case
assertively on the editorial pages."
But Naureckas discounts the
ability of the mainstream press to
improve its coverage. "No doubt
when the next war comes, they'll
hold their objections until after
the war," he said.
Instead, Naureckas believes
that alternative publications —
like his own — must "make it
clear to the media that this kind
of coverage was not what people
needed or expected."
The lesson of the war, Glasser
said, is a first amendment one.
The war raised a vital issue —
how free a free press should be.
"The Gulf War was a very vivid
reminder that we have a fair press
only under certain circum
stances," Glasser said. "It
reminded us that our press isn't
as free as we thought it was."

During the past two weeks, a
rapid succession of stories have
appeared that call into question
the national media's performance
in covering the Persian Gulf War.
The stories — from the scaled
down estimates of the Patriot mis
sile's effectiveness to the revelation
that some Iraqi atrocities reported
during the occupation of Kuwait
were exaggerated — have one thing
in common, according to scholars
and journalists. They highlight the
media's unquestioning, "press
release" reporting of the war.
The result of that trend, media
observers say, was coverage that
failed to adequately provide the
public with the news it needed to
make decisions about the war.
"If the media's role is to pro
vide a forum for democratic
debate, it failed abysmally," said
Jim Naureckas, editor in chief of
"Extra" magazine, a publication
of Fairness and Accuracy in
Reporting, a Washington, D.C.-
based media watchdog organiza
tion. "But if the media's role is to
rally support for the government's
policies, it did a very good job."
During the war, the Defense
Department imposed strict con
trols on what the press could see,
and military censors checked
nearly every story from the field.
However, most observers say the
media still deserves much of the
blame for its one-sided coverage;
it should have fought more when
the Pentagon clamped down.
"The press was much too cow

ardly in how it approached cover
ing the war," said Communication
Assoc. Prof. Ted Glasser. "They
were not very aggressive or
assertive. They did not turn it into
a major first amendment issue, as
it should have been."
Instead, observers say, a
"technophilia" pervaded the
national media's coverage of the
war, particularly on the network
news — which endlessly replayed
shots of "smart" bombs homing in
on their targets — and in news
magazines like Time and
Newsweek, which ran spreads
detailing the "tools of war," rather
than examining the policy ques
tions in-depth.
A 4 Pac-Man' war
"The press showed us a steril
ized war, a technological 'Pac-
Man' war," said Assoc. Communi
cation Prof. Jeremy Cohen. "It
made it possible to believe that
there weren't casualties."
It was only after the war that
the U.S. public began to see its
human costs. Some estimates of
combined military and civilian
Iraqi casualties have placed the
number as high as 200,000. The
U.S. Air Force recently released
statistics showing that only 9 per
cent of the 84,200 tons of bombs
dumped on Iraq and Kuwait were
smart bombs.
Although the smart bombs had
an accuracy rate of 90 percent, the
remaining 76,800 tons of bombs
were only 25 percent accurate.
The Patriot missile, too, has

Prisoner of war
This photo, depicting the charred body of an Iraqi soldier attempting
to escape from his burning truck, provoked a storm of protest when
it was published in The London Observer on March 3. Many thought
the image was too graphic, and it was pulled from the Associated
Press wire by a New York editor. But Harold Evans, a former editor of
The Times of London, defended the photo in The Observer a week
later. "It was a solitary individual in the transfixation of a hideous
death," Evans wrote. "Before this, it had been possible to enjoy the
lethal felicity of designer bombs as some kind of video game."
recently been revealed as less
effective in intercepting Iraqi
Scuds than had been previously
thought. The Defense Depart
ment now claims that only 50 per
cent of Scuds aimed at Israel, and
70 percent aimed at Saudi Arabia,
were successfully intercepted.
"We heard that smart bombs
were revolutionizing the war, but
that was really garbage," Nau
reckas said. "The Patriot actually
failed a large percentage of the
time — even against the Scud, a
very primitive missile."
Another example of the Ameri
can media's reluctance to portray
the human costs of the war was
the controversy over a photo that
appeared in The London Observ
er during the war, but was held
out of U.S. publications until
after the war.
The photo, depicting the
charred body of an Iraqi soldier
trying to escape from his burning
truck, was pulled from the Associ
ated Press wire by a New York
editor. When The Observer pub
lished the photo on March 3, the
image provoked a storm of protest
from some members of the media
who said it was too graphic.
But Harold Evans, the publish
er and president of Random
House and a former editor of The
Times of London, wrote a defense
of the photo that appeared in The
Observer a week later.
"It was a solitary individual in
the transfixation of a hideous
death," Evans wrote. "Before this,
it had been possible to enjoy the
lethal felicity of designer bombs as
some kind of video game."
Reporters 'cowboying around'
JuJu Chang, an ABC News
producer who graduated from
Stanford in 1987, said the media
— especially the television media
— overemphasized the technolog
ical aspects of the war.
"We had a hard time getting
the human side," Chang said.
"The video was very sexy, but
that wasn't the complete story."
Chang blamed the Pentagon's
pool system, which restricted

reporters to areas chosen by mili
tary escorts, for the absence of
graphic battle footage.
The controls were frustrating
to reporters who attempted to
determine the effects of the war
at the front, Chang said. The only
correspondents who obtained
footage other than that dictated
by the military, she said, were
those who went "cowboying
around" — such as ABC's Forrest
Sawyer, who "mounted a satellite
dish on a flatbed truck and went
along with Egyptian troops," and
CBS's Bob Simon, who was cap
tured by Iraqi troops.
But some media observers —
and many in the general public —
believe the controls were neces
sary to protect U.S. troops.
"There has been far too much
carping by the media about how
they didn't get their way," said
Brant Baker, the executive direc
tor of the Media Research Center,
an organization based in Alexan
dria, Va. that he said is "dedicated
to exposing and documenting
incidences of liberal media bias."
Baker said it was absolutely
necessary for the military to
tightly censor press coverage dur
ing the war.
"All you need is one person in
the press who is irresponsible and
it would cost hundreds of lives,"
he said. "It's better to err on the
side of caution."
A Times-Mirror poll conducted
on Feb. 12-13 found that 68 percent
of those questioned thought the
degree of military censorship was
"about right," while another 17 per
cent thought there should have
been "more" censorship. Only 13
percent thought there should have
been "less" military censorship.
Of those who were aware of the
military's press pool system, 86
percent said the pools "served the
public interest" either "well" or
"fairly well."
"The public simply wanted to
win a war," Cohen said. "The
public was clamoring for CNN
coverage and not much more."
'Cheerleading' for U.S. military
The media's emphasis on tech
nology, observers say, overshad
owed the political debate about
the war — especially after the war
began.
"There was an awful lot of
cheerleading for the U.S. military
and too little emphasis on Iraqi
deaths," said Dan Amundson,
research director at the Center
for Media and Public Affairs, a
Washington, D.C.-based organi
zation that examines national
coverage of public policy.
"The media rarely challenged
what the government was saying
or doing," Cohen said. "What we
got was a lot of rockets and Patri
ot missiles. It was exciting, but it
didn't really tell us much about
American policy."
Part of the problem, according
to Glasser, is that the media has a
tendency to focus on events, _____
rather than the larger
issues, in its coverage.

"The big challenge for
the press has always been
to sustain a foreign policy
debate independent of dra
matic events," Glasser
said. "Without the events,
for instance, we know very
little about Iraq or Iran."
Glasser believes the
press, particularly the tele
vision news, did a poor job
of explaining the cultural
and historical background

of the Middle East.
Much of the reason for
that weakness, observers say, lies
in the media's generally poor
knowledge of the region. Because
very few of the reporters covering
the war understood the geopoli
tics or religious politics of the
Middle East — or even the lan
guage — reporters had to rely on
the military's daily press confer
ences.
"What we had was a lot of high
priced talent sitting around to do
things that could have been done
by people in their first month of
work," Amundson said. "Good
journalism is more than showing
up at the right briefings."
The public, however, seemed
content with the coverage of the
war. The Times-Mirror poll found
that 83 percent of those ques
tioned thought the press coverage
was "good" or "excellent," while
72 percent thought the television
news reporters "dug harder" than

print journalists to cover the war.
An 'operational bias'
Janet Steele, an assistant pro
fessor in the University of Vir
ginia's Rhetoric and Communica
tion Department, conducted a
study of the networks' use of
"experts" to discuss the issues
involved in the war.
The networks used the term
"experts" rather loosely, she
argued, applying it to anyone
from former secretaries of state to
members of small, "quasi-aca
demic" think tanks. And, she
said, the networks made too much
use of "unofficial sources" — for
mer military or political leaders
who played no role in the current
administration.
The networks were inconsis
tent in identifying these sources,
Steele noted. News programs
often failed to cite which adminis-

trations these guests had previ
ously been affiliated with — a fact
that would have helped viewers in
determining their political slant.
"The blanket term 'Middle
East expert' can mean anything,"
Steele said. "Frequently these
people did have biases."
Steele used Vanderbilt Univer
sity's "Television News Index and
Abstract" — which documents
each episode of the network news
and Ted Koppel's "Nightline" pro
gram — to track the appearances
of the "unofficial sources" between
August 1990 and March 1991.
She found that members of
think tanks — who have usually
had connections to previous
administrations and represent
institutions with a pronounced
political bias — were invited back
far more often than other sources,
such as academics who specialize
in the Middle East. Only 188 indi

viduals accounted for 843 appear
ances, Steele determined.
After interviewing a number of
network news producers, Steele
concluded that an "operational
bias" existed in the networks' cov
erage. The producers wanted pre
dictions and concise, snappy
statements — two things that
academics, who often encouraged
looking at the complexities and
historical background of the situ
ation — were reluctant to do.
The result, Steele said, was
"skewed coverage" of the war.
The network producers, she said,
"wanted someone who is a 'play
er' rather than someone who has,
as one producer said, 'book
knowledge.' "
The news programs, according
to Steele, rarely invited guests who
talked about the history of the Mid
dle East and its tradition of fuzzy
border claims and centuries-long

grudges.
"As a historian, I would
have liked to see more
background. We never had
a sense of context about
why Saddam Hussein
invaded Kuwait," Steele
said. "This war looked like
it took place in a vacuum."
Making their case
Most observers agree
that the press, if it is to
improve its coverage, must
stand up more firmly to
