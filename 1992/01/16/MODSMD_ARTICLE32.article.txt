# One-Acts hit hard with 'Night Baseball'
## Tight writing, casting and directing helps Nitery sell out shows 
### Anita Schneider Staff writer 
Ram's Head Theatrical Society's Original
Winter One-Acts opened on Tuesday night to
a sell-out crowd. At first glance, the three new
plays by Stanford students Lisa Kirazian, Kira
Snyder and Gabriel Tissian appear to have no
common thread, but all touch on the search
for self-identity through close relationships.
"Night Baseball" is a raw and explosive
look at bigotry and ignorance, and their per
petuating nature. Playwright Tissian grew up
in downtown Philadelphia, and the authentic
ity of his hard-hitting script borders on being
uncomfortable. Tissian describes the world of
his play as one of "utter inescapability," and
this trapped, stifling sensation comes through
in both Tissian's powerful language and lan
McCrudden's tight direction.
The entire cast performs exceptionally well
and must have gotten in touch with some
painful feelings within themselves to act out
their anger so truthfully.
James Reichmuth plays Joe, a young col
lege student who lives at home with his ex-con
father Lou (John Reichmuth). Joe is escorted
to what he thinks is going to be an innocent
game of softball under the lights with Lou and
his pals. But for Joe, the evening turns into a
lesson in the strength of blood ties and the sad

confusion of city survival.
"Glorious Bride," by senior English major
Kirazian, was written from her experiences at
a bridal shop where her mother was employed.
Gloria (Monica Romig), the shop owner, and
her husband Jack (Chris Harris) have come to
a standstill in their marriage — they no longer
seem to care or connect with one another.
An odd lady named Jessica (Teresa
Gualtieri) appears at Gloria's shop, wanting to
sell her wedding dress — but only to the right
woman. Brides-to-be try on the dress, Jessica
interferes with the clients and Gloria remem
bers something about marriage that she had
forgotten.
Even though "The Glorious Bride" pro
motes a positive view of matrimony, it fizzles
out at the end, just like many marriages. But

it contains good performances by Gualtieri,
Karine Rosenthal and Elizabeth Bassett.
"Ashes, Ashes," by senior Drama major
Synder, is a series of vignettes that explore
one woman's fear of intimacy. Jessica
Frantzreb is energetic in the leading role of
Alix, but the script's structure gives her little
internal motivation.
A nameless woman character (Karen Fox)
is introduced and serves as Alix's inner voice.
In exploring women's problems with men and
intimacy, the playwright avoids true action
and conflict, and uses a less effective dramatic
device.
Dan Hunt is very good, playing all of the
men in Alix's life; without costume or make
up change, he manipulates his voice, posture
and expression to create several new charac
ters.
"Ashes, Ashes" doesn't come to a very sat
isfying resolution. In the final scene, Alix and
her relationship with the boy she's known all
of her life haven't changed at all — she reverts
to the same childish behavior she displayed in
the opening scenes.
The One-Acts will be at the Nitery tonight
through Saturday, Jan. 18, at 8 p.m., with a
2:30 Sunday matinee on Jan. 19. Tickets are
$8 for general admission ($6 for students) and
are available through the Ram's Head office at
723-0801.
