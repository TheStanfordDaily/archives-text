# ONE YEAR LATER: THE WAR'S COSTS
## After war, activism fizzles on campus 
### Kimberly Chrisman Juthymas Harntha Staff writers 
While UC-Santa Cruz, Foothill
College and other local campuses
carry on the tradition of activism
sparked by the Gulf War, Stan
ford students have put away their
yellow ribbons and peace symbols.
"I don't think Stanford stu
dents are necessarily less con
cerned — it's just that they don't
see the value of collective action,"
explained Jennifer Pearson, cur
rent leader of Stanford Students
for Peace in the Middle East.
"There are individual displays,
such as SWOPSI classes and per
sonal projects, but people are hes
itant to join organizations."
Students for Peace was orga
nized in the fall of 1990 in
response to growing tensions in
the Middle East. Throughout the
Gulf War, the group sponsored
teach-ins, rallies and other cam
pus events and served as coun
selors for potential draftees.
But one year after the war's
outbreak, Students for Peace and
other political organizations are
struggling to make their presence
felt on campus.
"At the height of the war, there
were about 200 people in the
group," Pearson said. "This year,
there are only about 10 people."
Senior Carlos Lerner joined
Stanford Students for Peace last
year because he was "angry and
confused" about the Gulf War. He,
like many of his fellow members,
left the group when the war ended.
"All the people who were in it
then had pretty different beliefs,"
he said. "The war was the unifying
thing for the group. After the war
was over, we sort of split apart."
Eric Krock, a former leader of
Stanford Students for America, a
group that supported the war, said
the Gulf War "certainly caused a
surge in activity on both ends of
the campus political spectrum."
"The only role students could
play in the Gulf War was demon

strating their opinions in some
way," Krock said. "When the war
ended, it was left to the govern
ment to sort out the pieces."
After the war ended, student
activism dropped — leading to the
near-demise of groups like Stu
dents for America and Students
for Peace.
"When things aren't quite as
pressing, we're not as quick to do
things," Kahn said. "Rallies
aren't appropriate anymore, so
we're definitely not as visible."
Apathy kills peace projects
The end of the war also meant
the end of several projects that
had been stimulated by the events
in the Gulf.
Graduate student David Porter
said that his project — reviving
the late '60s anti-war newspaper
'The Peacemonger' — failed
because there is "no audience and
no interest."
The paper was published twice
in January and June of 1991, and
even then it was hard to get people
to write, Porter said. "I can't do it
myself, and no one's interested in
writing any more," he said.
Greg Cumberford, a former
Stanford student, was unsuccess
ful in an attempt to collect and
publish a chronicle of poetry,
prose and art about peace.
"I got very few submissions,"
Cumberford said. "I couldn't get
anything published because there
just wasn't enough interest."
Cumberford also taught a
course last spring titled "Military
Sponsored Research at Stanford,"
which only five students attend
ed.
Palo Alto center still strong
But post-war apathy hasn't
affected Palo Alto's Mid-Peninsu
la Peace Center, whose member
ship surged during the war and
continues to remain high. Last
February, the organization spon
sored an "Anti-War Fair" attend
ed by more than 200 protestors,
including several Stanford stu

dents and faculty members.
"The level of activism isn't as
high in peacetime, but our mem
bership is still very strong," said
Paul George, the center's direc
tor. "It's just not as visible or
vocal as a public demonstration."
According to George, the cen
ter's purpose in peacetime is to edu
cate the public on foreign policy and
"to keep us out of the next war."
George added, "Just because
American guns aren't shooting
anywhere doesn't mean people
aren't dying because of U.S. policy."
Pearson agrees that there is
still a need for activism, both on

and off-campus. Oil fires and
water contamination are just a few
of the problems in the Middle East
that deserve attention, she said.
"People don't think the war is
a pressing issue anymore because
they aren't seeing bombs flying
on TV," Pearson said. "It's almost
as if it was a bad dream which is
over now.
"People think that it's not pro
ductive to be involved after the
fact," she continued. "But the pol
icy issues that caused the war are
ongoing. We need to focus on these
issues, or it's just a matter of time
before there's a Gulf War Two."

Although a spate of student activism accompanied the Persian Gulf
War last year, most activist groups — both for and against the war
— have largely died out.
