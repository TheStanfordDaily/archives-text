# ONE YEAR LATER; THE WAR'S COSTS
## In retrospect, a more ambiguous ending War's results may not have justified the effort, scholars say 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
One year alter the the Persian
Gulf War, what had been consid
ered an unqualified military success
is now being seen as a much more
ambiguous piece of foreign polity.
"It was a triumph of American
arms, but certainly not a triumph
of statecraft," said Hoover Senior
Research Fellow Angelo Codevilla.
Many scholars — even sup
porters of the war, like Codevilla
— believe that what the United
States put into the war was not
worth the gain.
Saddam Hussein, although
weakened, is still in power and
remains a thorn in the side of U.S.
policy; the region has been devas
tated environmentally; Saddam's
post-war crackdown on the Kurds
— who had been encouraged to
rebel by President Bush —
resulted in the death of as many
as 100,000 people; and the liberat
ed Kuwait is as reluctant as ever
to pursue democratic reform.
"The underlying problems that

prompted the war are still there,"
said History Prof. Clay borne Car
son, noting that the "economic
divisions" between states in the
Middle East remain — divisions
that cause much of the tension
between them.
"The basic division in the Mid
dle East is between the rich states
with little populations and the
poor states with big populations,"
Carson said. "Until that is
resolved, we will continue to see
conflict in the region."
Other scholars, however, believe
that the war's goal was not to solve
all the problems in the Middle East.
The war, they believe, was success
ful in its main aims — in ending
Iraq's occupation of Kuwait and in
preventing Saddam from develop
ing nuclear weapons.
"It was a limited war, and in
that sense it was successful," said
Hoover Senior Research Fellow
Charles Hill, a former assistant to
Secretary of State George Shultz
in the Reagan administration.
Hoover Senior Fellow Martin
Anderson, who had been Reagan's

chief domestic policy adviser, was
blunt.
"Saddam Hussein was months
away from developing a nuclear
tipped, intercontinental ballistic
missile, which he would have
aimed at the heart of Israel —
possibly causing a nuclear world
war," Anderson said.
Although there is no proof of
Anderson's assertion, it appears
that Saddam's nuclear program
was farther advanced than had
been thought before the war. The
New York Times reported yester
day that Iraq had been buying
German components for a nuclear
complex that might have eventu
ally produced four or five weapons
per year.
Iraqi officials said they had
destroyed the components after
the war, but United Nations
inspectors cannot yet confirm
that, the paper said.
The failure of the U.S. invasion
to remove Saddam from power —
despite its spectacular success in
freeing Kuwait — has left many
believing that the war cannot be

called a complete victory.
"We solved the wrong prob
lem," Codevilla said. "President
Bush made a mistake in thinking
that the problem was the invasion
of Kuwait rather than Saddam's
existence."
Carson opposed the decision to
go to war against Iraq, arguing
that the desired results could
have been achieved "at a slower
pace, through less deadly and
costly means."
But he said that once the war
began, it was a mistake to back off
before removing Saddam from
power. "It left a lot of people
exposed," Carson said, noting
that the Kurds were abandoned
after the war.
"It was a war to eliminate a
demonic figure — but the demonic
figure is still there," Carson said.
Hill, however, argued that
Bush made the right move: If the
war had been expanded to the
invasion of Baghdad and the
removal of Saddam, many mem
bers of the international coalition
"would have screamed bloody

murder."
Despite Saddam's nagging
presence, most scholars agree
that it is unlikely Bush will
attempt another effort to topple
the dictator's regime.
"There's been a great deal of

talk about that, but it won't hap
pen," Codevilla said. "For (Bushl
to do that, he has to say, 'I was
wrong.' "
Nine months after the end of
the Gulf War — and eight months
before the presidential election —
most scholars say the war will not
be the magnet issue that carries
President Bush to reelection.
Its results are still too uncer
tain, and Americans' economic
fears may supersede other con
cerns.
"The historical memory of
Americans tends to be very
short," Carson said. "What mat
ters now is the economy."
Codevilla, too, believes that
the war will not be a central issue
in the campaign — and that is as
it should be.
"We have other problems in
this country," he said, "and that's
what the campaign should be
fought on."

Carson opposed the decision to
go to war against Iraq, arguing
that the desired results could
have been achieved "at a slower
pace, through less deadly and
costly means."
But he said that once the war
began, it was a mistake to back off
before removing Saddam from
power. "It left a lot of people
exposed," Carson said, noting
that the Kurds were abandoned
after the war.
"It was a war to eliminate a
demonic figure — but the demonic
figure is still there," Carson said.
Hill, however, argued that
Bush made the right move: If the
war had been expanded to the
invasion of Baghdad and the
removal of Saddam, many mem
bers of the international coalition
"would have screamed bloody

murder."
Despite Saddam's nagging
presence, most scholars agree
that it is unlikely Bush will
attempt another effort to topple
the dictator's regime.
"There's been a great deal of

talk about that, but it won't hap
pen," Codevilla said. "For (Bushl
to do that, he has to say, 'I was
wrong.' "
Nine months after the end of
the Gulf War — and eight months
before the presidential election —
most scholars say the war will not
be the magnet issue that carries
President Bush to reelection.
Its results are still too uncer
tain, and Americans' economic
fears may supersede other con
cerns.
"The historical memory of
Americans tends to be very
short," Carson said. "What mat
ters now is the economy."
Codevilla, too, believes that
the war will not be a central issue
in the campaign — and that is as
it should be.
"We have other problems in
this country," he said, "and that's
what the campaign should be
fought on."
One year alter the the Persian
Gulf War, what had been consid
ered an unqualified military success
is now being seen as a much more
ambiguous piece of foreign polity.
"It was a triumph of American
arms, but certainly not a triumph
of statecraft," said Hoover Senior
Research Fellow Angelo Codevilla.
Many scholars — even sup
porters of the war, like Codevilla
— believe that what the United
States put into the war was not
worth the gain.
Saddam Hussein, although
weakened, is still in power and
remains a thorn in the side of U.S.
policy; the region has been devas
tated environmentally; Saddam's
post-war crackdown on the Kurds
— who had been encouraged to
rebel by President Bush —
resulted in the death of as many
as 100,000 people; and the liberat
ed Kuwait is as reluctant as ever
to pursue democratic reform.
"The underlying problems that

prompted the war are still there,"
said History Prof. Clay borne Car
son, noting that the "economic
divisions" between states in the
Middle East remain — divisions
that cause much of the tension
between them.
"The basic division in the Mid
dle East is between the rich states
with little populations and the
poor states with big populations,"
Carson said. "Until that is
resolved, we will continue to see
conflict in the region."
Other scholars, however, believe
that the war's goal was not to solve
all the problems in the Middle East.
The war, they believe, was success
ful in its main aims — in ending
Iraq's occupation of Kuwait and in
preventing Saddam from develop
ing nuclear weapons.
"It was a limited war, and in
that sense it was successful," said
Hoover Senior Research Fellow
Charles Hill, a former assistant to
Secretary of State George Shultz
in the Reagan administration.
Hoover Senior Fellow Martin
Anderson, who had been Reagan's

chief domestic policy adviser, was
blunt.
"Saddam Hussein was months
away from developing a nuclear
tipped, intercontinental ballistic
missile, which he would have
aimed at the heart of Israel —
possibly causing a nuclear world
war," Anderson said.
Although there is no proof of
Anderson's assertion, it appears
that Saddam's nuclear program
was farther advanced than had
been thought before the war. The
New York Times reported yester
day that Iraq had been buying
German components for a nuclear
complex that might have eventu
ally produced four or five weapons
per year.
Iraqi officials said they had
destroyed the components after
the war, but United Nations
inspectors cannot yet confirm
that, the paper said.
The failure of the U.S. invasion
to remove Saddam from power —
despite its spectacular success in
freeing Kuwait — has left many
believing that the war cannot be

called a complete victory.
"We solved the wrong prob
lem," Codevilla said. "President
Bush made a mistake in thinking
that the problem was the invasion
of Kuwait rather than Saddam's
existence."
Carson opposed the decision to
go to war against Iraq, arguing
that the desired results could
have been achieved "at a slower
pace, through less deadly and
costly means."
