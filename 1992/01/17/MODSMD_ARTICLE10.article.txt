## Golf cart malfunctions, goes up in flames 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
What started out as an inno
cent ride through the Quad in a
golf cart ended in smoke and
flames at Lagunita Court earlier
this week.
The golf cart, rented from a
Santa Clara company, has been
sophomore Marc Lawrence's
means of transportation since he
broke his right foot during an
intramural basketball game.
Some of Lawrence's friends,
including sophomore Matt Brad
ford, drove him to classes since
his foot injury prevented him
from driving.
Their adventure began Tues
day afternoon when the cart
wouldn't start after their 1:15
classes, Bradford said.
After repeated attempts to
start the vehicle, the cart gave a
sudden lurch forward, according
to Bradford. "I was almost
thrown out," Lawrence said.
The cart got stuck in a corner
of the quad and they had to shift

it into neutral gear while Brad
ford tried to push it out,
Lawrence said. It suddenly shift
ed into reverse, forcing Bradford
to chase it through the Quad, he
added.
After he recovered the cart,
Bradford said he found a way to
control the $175-a-month cart,
even thought "the brakes would
only work in neutral." Lawrence
opted not to return to Lagunita in
the cart and waited at the Quad
for Bradford to return and pick
him up in a real car.
Shifting in and out of gear, "I
zoomed back (to Lagunita) at high
velocities," Bradford said.
As he was going "backward
and forward to get the cart
parked," it suddenly shifted out of
neutral, Bradford said. He then
"hit the parking brake, heard a
crackling noise, saw smoke,
grabbed the book bags and got
out."
Flames erupted around the
gearshift, but two bystanders and
Bradford each got a fire extin
guisher from inside Lagunita and

'I zoomed back (to
Lagunita) at high
velocities.'

put out the fire before the fire
engines arrived, Bradford said.
No one was hurt in the fire,
and the cart was only slightly
damaged.
According to Jim Sherman, the
owner of Turf and Industrial
Equipment, the company that
rented Lawrence the cart, "There
was a short in the electrical sys
tem of the cart" that caused it to
malfunction. The company came
early Wednesday morning and
took back the damaged cart for
repairs, giving Lawrence a
replacement.
Both Lawrence and Bradford
said their wild ride "gave their
day a little excitement."
