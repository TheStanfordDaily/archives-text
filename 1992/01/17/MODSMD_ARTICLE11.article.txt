# War remembered by candlelight
## 
### Sandi Yeh 
About 50 people gathered in White Plaza for a
candlelight "speak-out" remembering the Gulf War
last night, the anniversary of President Bush's offi
cial declaration of war.
Students, faculty, staff and other members of the
Stanford community gathered in a small semicircle,
some embracing, others still on their bicycles and
some shivering in the cold night air.
Many held candles as they shared their memories
and feelings concerning the war.
Senior Jenn Pearson, coordinator of the student
run group sponsoring the event, Students For
Peace, stressed that the evening was not to "debate,
lecture or analyze the war."
Rather, she said, she viewed the event as a chance
for "collective remembrance of the war, a reflection
of past and present opposition to war and an
renewed awareness of continuing national policies."
The "speak-out" began with a moment of silence,
followed by poetry reading by sophomore Natasha
Iskander. Next, Pearson had the crowd join her in
singing several songs.

Pearson then invited participants to step up to
the microphone and voice their own feelingß and
memories.
Sophomore Marci Shore said she felt a sense of
"depression and disempowerment," feelings that
were echoed by other speakers. Shore said that
"protest efforts seemed like exercises in futility."
According to graduate student Nathalie Broomhall,
she came to "protest war in general" and "to remem
ber the death and destruction caused by war."
Hans Samelson, a Professor Emeritus of Mathe
matics, attended with his wife, Nancy, a retired
senior research associate in Civil Engineering. Both
agreed that "war is a terrible thing that humanity
uses to try to solve problems."
Several participants said they came to reunite
with people they had met during the protests oppos
ing the war.
Pearson said she wanted people to come to reflect
on the human impact of war on their lives. She also
said she hoped that people would share their
thoughts so others would feel supported and validat
ed rather than alone in their continued concern
about the war.
