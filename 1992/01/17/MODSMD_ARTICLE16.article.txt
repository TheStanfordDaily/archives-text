The new Greek judicial
board reflects critical
thinking by University

WHILE LARGE institutions
like Stanford may often
seem unduly encumbered
by centralized bureaucracy, the
University has shown creative ini
tiative in its empowerment of the
Greek Judicial Board.
Created last year to give more
authority in judicial matters to the
Interfraternity and Intersorority
Councils, the judicial board last
week demonstrated that it was able
to meet its mandate effectively.
In deciding the fate of the Sigma
Chi fraternity in the wake of their
"elaborate and creative and abso
lutely lethal" party decorations last
fall, the judicial board developed a
unique punishment designed to
handle the specifics of the case,
rather than merely implementing
one of the more rigid and tradition
al punishments from the Office of
the Dean of Students.
The Greek Judicial Board con
sists of Director of Student Affairs
Nanci Howe, three representatives
from the IFC and ISC, two alumni
— who have not yet been appoint
ed — and one unaffiliated student.
In empowering the newly creat
ed council, the University has
allowed those most familiar with
the concerned Greek organizations
to determine what would be the
most appropriate and effective dis
ciplinary procedures for dealing
with a particular incident. This is
much more appropriate than hav
ing already over-worked staff
members unfamiliar with the indi
vidual chapters investigate the
specifics of each incident.
The Sigma Chi party in question
— a closed event in which only
members of the fraternity and their
dates were invited — was shut down
and the house evacuated because it
was deemed a serious fire hazard by
the Stanford fire marshal.

Therefore, the judicial board
designed the punishment to deal
specifically with these issues,
rather than merely implementing a
pre-existing one. Traditionally,
punishments administered to
Greek organizations have included
suspension, probation or expulsion,
but have not been nearly as case
specific as this most recent one.
The fraternity has been placed
on social suspension during which
it cannot hold any official social
function until it has fulfilled cer
tain stipulations: It must institute
an internal fire safety program,
and it must review its alcohol poli
cy during members-only affairs.
In addition to the above require
ments, all house members must
complete two hours of community
service. While this option has been
used in the past — last year, mem
bers of the Theta Xi fraternity
were required to complete three
hours each — the new goal is to
focus the community service on
the particular issue in question, in
this case fire safety.
The fraternity will work with
the fire marshal to come up with an
appropriate project. According to
Howe, this may include clearing
brush in the foothills or some other
fire prevention-related activity.
Sigma Chi members will also be
required to give fire-safety presen
tations in all housed fraternities
on campus.
Once the above stipulations
have been fulfilled and the alcohol
policy reviewed by the IFC, the
house president will report back to
Howe and explain just what has
been accomplished. The suspen
sion will then be lifted. Under the
old system, a suspension typically
lasted two quarters and was not
contingent on such specific, issue
oriented requirements.
In empowering the new judicial
board, the University has taken an
important step in allowing those
most directly involved to take
responsibility for their actions.
The judicial board has demon
strated its ability to think innova
tively and act appropriately.
