## A
						man who dared to dream 
### 
ON MONDAY WE WILL nationally
honor a man. Most people so hon
ored have served us, above and
beyond duty, in the office of president.
But the man we will honor did not serve
as our president.
We will honor him not only for who he
was, but for what he was. In the time
when we needed him most, when others
were afraid to stand and face us, when we
were afraid to stand and face ourselves,
he and faced us as our conscience.
This man was the late Dr. Martin Luther
King. He based his practice of nonviolent
leadership on the belief that, ultimately, the
dignity inborn in man would win over the
degenerate hatefulness bred into him. He
allowed us into his dream and made us
believe that sort of miracle could be reality.
He led us away from our animal side
that cried for violence and retaliation,
and asked only that we listen to our
human side that advised negotiation and
understanding.
He was willing to be a scapegoat; even
when rejected and criticized he held on,
braving the storm for only a glimpse of
the sun.
He knew his time would be short and
his passage bitter, but he never turned
from the road before him. He led by
example, asking others to endure only
what he was able to bear and understand
what he was unable to suffer. He led us
not necessarily where we would follow,

but where we needed to go. He was a lead
er that knew the value of convictions and
the importance of dedication.
He understood that his needed leader
ship did not touch any one race, but every
race that bore the nationality "Ameri
can." He hoped to restore honor to all of
its bearers. He loved us, not separately as
fragments of society, but collectively as a
great nation, as a great people.
When we look back at the '60s, we see
Vietnam, psychedelia and drugs; "My
Girl" and "Blowin* in the Wind"; Kent
State and the University of Mississippi.
But that is just the fringe. In addition,
we see the people â€” the presidents,
Kennedy and Johnson, the assassinated,
John and Bobby Kennedy, and the youth.
But the first vision that comes to many of
us is that of King.
This is not strange because what he
started in Birmingham and carried to the
steps of the Capitol became the wind that
pushed open the door for many changes.
His work left society stronger and more
truthful. He made us stand in the light
and be healed.
But when he left us we felt loss. He left
us in awe, in sadness, but in hope.
What have we left him? The Dream:
Was it only one man's vision or a goal we
all want to reach? We have walked far. The
sons of former slaves and former slave
owners may not sit at the same table, but
they do sit in the same classroom.

We have our problems but black and
white, Jew and Gentile, we are trying.
While Rodney King and David Duke may
dishearten and disgruntle us, we must not
forget the changes. With time and hope, the
rest may pass, and those gains will contin
ue, bringing us closer to the ideals we may
not achieve, but at least aspire to attain.
In this time of political disillusion
ment, when it is hard to experience that
proud feeling from the words and visions
of our leaders, it is inspiring and chal
lenging to look back at such an American.
His example says, "Lead, and believe, but
most of all, dream."
From the "Better America" Jack
Kennedy hoped for, to the "Best Ameri
ca" George Bush promised to find, some
where there is "The America." This is the
one we talk about, the one we pray about,
the one we love. And in this America is
the mountain top King stood upon.
Therein is our belief and our miracle.
Let the optimism and the bravery that
were his be ours. We will find that moun
tain top and experience the miracle that
was his dream and our due.
