## Vladislav Krasnov The 						key to a successful, stable Russia: Solzhenitsyn 
### 
£ BOOK IS A SCRIPT FOR
I what's going on in your coun
_l_ try," I told Boris Yeltsin, hand
ing him a copy. "I don't expect you to
read it, but you may ask your aides to
translate its last chapter: 'From Commu
nism's Red Flag to Russia's Tricolor.'
Not only does it foretell what happened
last week, but it also predicts your victo
ry over Gorbachev." With a broad smile
on his face, Yeltsin firmly shook my hand
and promised to do just that.
This happened in Moscow on Aug. 28,
a week after Yeltsin had foiled the Com
munist coup and hoisted the tricolor over
the Russian parliament.
I was there among some 400 emigres
and defectors whom the Russian presi
dent welcomed back in the parliament.
The book I gave him was "Russia Beyond
Communism: A Chronicle of National
Rebirth." During the preceding week
Russia had indeed made a giant step
"Beyond Communism."
When I began the book in 1987, most
sovietologists believed in the longevity of
"Reform Communism." However, I fore

saw that democratization and glasnost
would inevitably outdistance not only Gor
bachev, but any Communist reformer.
The main Soviet development would be
"from Marxism-Leninism to no "ism,"
from Partia to Patria, from things Com
munist to things Russian."
And now "Things Russian" have esca
lated in the proclamation of Russia's
sovereignty, in Yeltsin's election to the
Russian presidency, in the raising of the
Russian tricolor and in the final knock
out of Gorbachev's "Union" by Yeltsin's
Commonwealth of Independent States.
I do not claim that my book had an
influence on Yeltsin. But I am sure he was
influenced by the exiled novelist Alexan
der Solzhenitsyn — now in Vermont —
whose political writings inspired my book.
In his 1973 "Letter to the Soviet Lead
ers," Solzhenitsyn spelled out a program
of reforms, compared to which Gor
bachev's perestroika seems but a blurred
and distorted copy. The truth-teller of the
Gulag was "rewarded" by being thrown
out of the country.
But his 1990 essay "Rebuilding Rus-

sia: Reflections and Tentative Proposals"
was read by millions of Soviet readers.
Centered on these two documents, my
book shows a growing acceptance of
Solzhenitsyn as the true mentor of a gen
uine new Russian thinking.
If Gorbachev's perestroika was too little
too late, it was chiefly because Solzhenit
syn's 1973 proposals were ignored. But
how about his 1990 essay? Gorbachev con
demned it as a "destructive" work of "a
man of the past." By treating Russia's liv
ing conscience unfairly, Gorbachev forfeit
ed a chance to lift himself above partisan
ship and to become a true national leader.
A year later, down he went onto the heap
of the past.
Yeltsin proved more in tune with the
time. He took credit for distributing the
essay among Russian parliamentarians,
saying that "there are lots of interesting
ideas there." Yeltsin added that he might
include some in his political agenda. And
he did.
First, he adopted Solzhenitsyn's
patriotic theme, "Russia Must Be
Reborn," as his presidential campaign

slogan. Then he upended Gorbachev's
"Union" by forming the Commonwealth
around the core of three Slavic republics.
This latter idea came straight out of
Solzhenitsyn's essay. Yeltsin admitted in
November 1990 that he was "intrigued
by [Solzhenitsyn's] idea of a tri-Slavic
alliance."
"David" Yeltsin has prevailed over
"Goliath" Gorbachev. But now that he
has moved to the Kremlin, Yeltsin may
wish to know that, besides the predic
tions that have been fulfilled, one yet
remains: To consolidate Russia as a new
member in the family of civilized nations,
Yeltsin will have to win a blessing from
Vermont.
Without Solzhenitsyn's endorsement,
no government will stand in Russia for
very long. I hope Yeltsin is able to win
Solzhenitsyn to his side. Unless he does, I
fear 1992 may turn very bitter for the
Russians and for Yeltsin himself.

dent welcomed back in the parliament.
The book I gave him was "Russia Beyond
Communism: A Chronicle of National
Rebirth." During the preceding week
Russia had indeed made a giant step
"Beyond Communism."
When I began the book in 1987, most
sovietologists believed in the longevity of
"Reform Communism." However, I fore

saw that democratization and glasnost
would inevitably outdistance not only Gor
bachev, but any Communist reformer.
The main Soviet development would be
"from Marxism-Leninism to no "ism,"
from Partia to Patria, from things Com
munist to things Russian."
And now "Things Russian" have esca
lated in the proclamation of Russia's
sovereignty, in Yeltsin's election to the
Russian presidency, in the raising of the
Russian tricolor and in the final knock
out of Gorbachev's "Union" by Yeltsin's
Commonwealth of Independent States.
I do not claim that my book had an
influence on Yeltsin. But I am sure he was
influenced by the exiled novelist Alexan
der Solzhenitsyn — now in Vermont —
whose political writings inspired my book.
In his 1973 "Letter to the Soviet Lead
ers," Solzhenitsyn spelled out a program
of reforms, compared to which Gor
bachev's perestroika seems but a blurred
and distorted copy. The truth-teller of the
Gulag was "rewarded" by being thrown
out of the country.
But his 1990 essay "Rebuilding Rus-

sia: Reflections and Tentative Proposals"
was read by millions of Soviet readers.
Centered on these two documents, my
book shows a growing acceptance of
Solzhenitsyn as the true mentor of a gen
uine new Russian thinking.
If Gorbachev's perestroika was too little
too late, it was chiefly because Solzhenit
syn's 1973 proposals were ignored. But
how about his 1990 essay? Gorbachev con
demned it as a "destructive" work of "a
man of the past." By treating Russia's liv
ing conscience unfairly, Gorbachev forfeit
ed a chance to lift himself above partisan
ship and to become a true national leader.
A year later, down he went onto the heap
of the past.
Yeltsin proved more in tune with the
time. He took credit for distributing the
essay among Russian parliamentarians,
saying that "there are lots of interesting
ideas there." Yeltsin added that he might
include some in his political agenda. And
he did.
First, he adopted Solzhenitsyn's
patriotic theme, "Russia Must Be
Reborn," as his presidential campaign

slogan. Then he upended Gorbachev's
"Union" by forming the Commonwealth
around the core of three Slavic republics.
This latter idea came straight out of
Solzhenitsyn's essay. Yeltsin admitted in
November 1990 that he was "intrigued
by [Solzhenitsyn's] idea of a tri-Slavic
alliance."
"David" Yeltsin has prevailed over
"Goliath" Gorbachev. But now that he
has moved to the Kremlin, Yeltsin may
wish to know that, besides the predic
tions that have been fulfilled, one yet
remains: To consolidate Russia as a new
member in the family of civilized nations,
Yeltsin will have to win a blessing from
Vermont.
Without Solzhenitsyn's endorsement,
no government will stand in Russia for
very long. I hope Yeltsin is able to win
Solzhenitsyn to his side. Unless he does, I
fear 1992 may turn very bitter for the
Russians and for Yeltsin himself.
