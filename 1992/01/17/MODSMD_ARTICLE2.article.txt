Bill Walsh was formally intro
duced as Stanford's new football
coach yesterday afternoon,
returning to the job he has always
called his true love.
He brings with him a legacy of
success — two victorious bowl
games in two seasons with the Car
dinal as well as three Super Bowl
rings during his 10 years with the
Sail Francisco 49ers.
"This is a great day for Stan
ford University and Stanford ath
letics, particularly the football
program," Athletic Director Ted
Leland told the 500 people attend
ing yesterday's press conference

in Burnham Pavilion.
Walsh replaces his protege
Dennis Green, who resigned last
week to become head coach of the
Minnesota Vikings.
"The best you are going to get
out of me is hopefully an adequate
replacement for Denny Green,"
Walsh said. "Don't expect any
thing better, because you are not
going to get it.
"Denny has brought a mediocre
football program to national promi
nence. ... Hopefully we can take it
another level higher," he added.
Walsh signed a five-year deal,
reportedly for $350,000 per year
— a tenfold increase over his 1977
salary. He had been rumored to be
close to a deal to rejoin the 49ers

as a consultant, and he has served
as the top football commentator
on NBC for the past three seasons.
"I decided that I might be of
more value teaching someplace
rather than remarking on the 10
ways of fumbling the ball on tele
vision," Walsh said. "This is right.
Being an educator does have
redeeming value."
Joining the Stanford program
with Walsh is San Jose State head
football coach Terry Shea, who
will serve as assistant head coach
and offensive coordinator.
Walsh said the first person he
wanted to join him was Shea.
"Without Terry, I was not sure
