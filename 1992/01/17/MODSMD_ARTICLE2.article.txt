Bill Walsh was formally intro
duced as Stanford's new football
coach yesterday afternoon,
returning to the job he has always
called his true love.
He brings with him a legacy of
success — two victorious bowl
games in two seasons with the Car
dinal as well as three Super Bowl
rings during his 10 years with the
Sail Francisco 49ers.
"This is a great day for Stan
ford University and Stanford ath
letics, particularly the football
program," Athletic Director Ted
Leland told the 500 people attend
ing yesterday's press conference

in Burnham Pavilion.
Walsh replaces his protege
Dennis Green, who resigned last
week to become head coach of the
Minnesota Vikings.
"The best you are going to get
out of me is hopefully an adequate
replacement for Denny Green,"
Walsh said. "Don't expect any
thing better, because you are not
going to get it.
"Denny has brought a mediocre
football program to national promi
nence. ... Hopefully we can take it
another level higher," he added.
Walsh signed a five-year deal,
reportedly for $350,000 per year
— a tenfold increase over his 1977
salary. He had been rumored to be
close to a deal to rejoin the 49ers

as a consultant, and he has served
as the top football commentator
on NBC for the past three seasons.
"I decided that I might be of
more value teaching someplace
rather than remarking on the 10
ways of fumbling the ball on tele
vision," Walsh said. "This is right.
Being an educator does have
redeeming value."
Joining the Stanford program
with Walsh is San Jose State head
football coach Terry Shea, who
will serve as assistant head coach
and offensive coordinator.
Walsh said the first person he
wanted to join him was Shea.
"Without Terry, I was not sure

about taking this job," he said.
Shea had been one of two finalists
for the head coach position at Cali
fornia and was reportedly a candi
date for the vacant offensive coordi
nator position with the 49ers, but
said he could not pass up the oppor
tunity to coach with Walsh.
"In my 20 years of coaching, Bill
Walsh's influence has blanketed my
career," Shea said. "This is the
chance of a lifetime to work with
Coach Walsh here at Stanford."
Walsh promised that the Cardinal
will continue to play football "exact
ly as Denny's teams played.... We
will play intense football.
"Players can be very successful
in the classroom . . . and at the
same time be very aggressive, com
petitive athletic performers. I
expect that to continue," he added.
"The coach must establish an
atmosphere where everyone
demands excellence of each other.
The guys will demand it of each
other just as they did for Denny,"
Walsh said.
"In other words we really want
to kick ass!" he said.
Walsh is known to look after
former assistants, and three of his
former proteges are now coaching
in the NFC Central Division —
Green, Tampa Bay Buccaneers
coach Sam Wyche and Green Bay

"I have been working night and
day to move Denny Green along,
and now that he is up there (in
Minnesota), there was an open
ing," Walsh said.
After expressing interest to
Leland over the weekend, there
were two "mysterious conversa
tions," including late evening cof
fee at Stickney's, Walsh said. But
he said he only made his final deci
sion while he was driving to meet
49ers coach George Seifert on
Wednesday.
"There were no negotiations for
[the Stanford] job. There was no
give and take on salary or bene
fits," Walsh said. "There was a
substantial salary difference
between (49ers owner) Ed Deßar
tolo or NBC."
But despite the money, Walsh
said he wanted to return to Stan
ford, saying, "This is my bliss."
Walsh's return was greeted by a
mixture of excitement and sorrow
because the team will likely lose
many of the assistant coaches.
"This is such a great opportuni
ty, but I feel for the other coaches,"
said sophomore starting quarter
back Steve Stenstrom. "It is going
to be real sad, but they are not
going out on a bad note."
Long-time observers of the
Stanford football program hailed
the return of Walsh to the Farm

by the University that intercol

"In the 1920s the University

the University has stepped up
nationally, and even interna

Minnesota), there was an open
ing," Walsh said.
After expressing interest to
Leland over the weekend, there
were two "mysterious conversa
tions," including late evening cof
fee at Stickney's, Walsh said. But
he said he only made his final deci
sion while he was driving to meet
49ers coach George Seifert on
Wednesday.
"There were no negotiations for
[the Stanford] job. There was no
give and take on salary or bene
fits," Walsh said. "There was a
substantial salary difference
between (49ers owner) Ed Deßar
tolo or NBC."
But despite the money, Walsh
said he wanted to return to Stan
ford, saying, "This is my bliss."
Walsh's return was greeted by a
mixture of excitement and sorrow
because the team will likely lose
many of the assistant coaches.
"This is such a great opportuni
ty, but I feel for the other coaches,"
said sophomore starting quarter
back Steve Stenstrom. "It is going
to be real sad, but they are not
going out on a bad note."
Long-time observers of the
Stanford football program hailed
the return of Walsh to the Farm
"I think it is a great affirmation

by the University that intercol
legiate athletics are important.
This University has always pro
claimed excellence in engineer
ing, law, medicine and busi
ness," said Bob Murphy, the

basketball on radio station
KCBS.

Bill Walsh was formally intro
duced as Stanford's new football
coach yesterday afternoon,
returning to the job he has always
called his true love.
He brings with him a legacy of
success — two victorious bowl
games in two seasons with the Car
dinal as well as three Super Bowl
rings during his 10 years with the
Sail Francisco 49ers.
"This is a great day for Stan
ford University and Stanford ath
letics, particularly the football
program," Athletic Director Ted
Leland told the 500 people attend
ing yesterday's press conference

in Burnham Pavilion.
Walsh replaces his protege
Dennis Green, who resigned last
week to become head coach of the
Minnesota Vikings.
"The best you are going to get
out of me is hopefully an adequate
replacement for Denny Green,"
Walsh said. "Don't expect any
thing better, because you are not
going to get it.
"Denny has brought a mediocre
football program to national promi
nence. ... Hopefully we can take it
another level higher," he added.
Walsh signed a five-year deal,
reportedly for $350,000 per year
— a tenfold increase over his 1977
salary. He had been rumored to be
close to a deal to rejoin the 49ers

as a consultant, and he has served
as the top football commentator
on NBC for the past three seasons.
"I decided that I might be of
more value teaching someplace
rather than remarking on the 10
ways of fumbling the ball on tele
vision," Walsh said. "This is right.
Being an educator does have
redeeming value."
Joining the Stanford program
with Walsh is San Jose State head
football coach Terry Shea, who
will serve as assistant head coach
and offensive coordinator.
Walsh said the first person he
wanted to join him was Shea.
"Without Terry, I was not sure

about taking this job," he said.
Shea had been one of two finalists
for the head coach position at Cali
fornia and was reportedly a candi
date for the vacant offensive coordi
nator position with the 49ers, but
said he could not pass up the oppor
tunity to coach with Walsh.
"In my 20 years of coaching, Bill
Walsh's influence has blanketed my
career," Shea said. "This is the
chance of a lifetime to work with
Coach Walsh here at Stanford."
Walsh promised that the Cardinal
will continue to play football "exact
ly as Denny's teams played.... We
will play intense football.
"Players can be very successful
in the classroom . . . and at the
same time be very aggressive, com
petitive athletic performers. I
expect that to continue," he added.
"The coach must establish an
atmosphere where everyone
demands excellence of each other.
The guys will demand it of each
other just as they did for Denny,"
Walsh said.
"In other words we really want
to kick ass!" he said.
Walsh is known to look after
former assistants, and three of his
former proteges are now coaching
in the NFC Central Division —
Green, Tampa Bay Buccaneers
coach Sam Wyche and Green Bay
