# Solving the University's budget woes: Eliminate Residential Education
## 
### 
It is time for Stanford to finally put
the Office of Residential Education to
rest. Six feet under, preferably.
There is no reason undergraduates
need their hands held for the only four
years in their lives when they might actu
ally be able to do as they want.
Everyone here went to some form of
grammar school for 12 years and was led
around and treated like the 10-year-old
he or she was. Now, however, we are
spending a good portion of our parents'
savings to do some independent self-dis
covery. It is a truly great opportunity,

one that does not need to be ruined by a
group of out-of-touch hooligans calling
themselves "educators."
Furthermore, in light of today's fiscal
quagmire, why cut something as pre
cious as the arts or overseas campuses,
when something as wholly useless as
Res Ed could be eliminated? And
besides, if a residence wishes to put on
programs of interest, why not give them
the liberty of doing so, rather than
imposing them from the top down?
This is a plea to whoever can do
something about it to stop the torture of
thought that takes place at these inane,
biased and insufficient Res Ed programs.
More than half the battle of getting peo
ple to grow intellectually is to leave
them on their own and give them
enough trust that they will feel comfort-

able thinking on their own.
