# Give credit where credit is due: 'To me,' says former Hoover director
## 
### 
As you must know, I was the person
that the Jan. 3 issue of The Economist
credited with the number-one rating that
the Hoover Institution received. The mag
azine stated, "To his (Glenn Campbell's)
institute goes the highest overall score."
Thus, I was very pleased by the lead
editorial titled "Hoovers and Shakers" in
The Daily on Jan. 13 and the article
titled " 'Kooky' Hoover gets top rank-

ing" the following day.
All the scholars quoted in the second
article came to Hoover while I was director.
Further, on the matter of diversity, that
was one of the first tasks I undertook after
I became director in 1960. In addition, we
entered into many joint appointments with
other schools and departments.
The only person with whom we had
difficulties on this was University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy.
Now that Kennedy is departing from
the presidency, the situation in respect to
teaching by Hoover scholars should dra
matically improve again. Finally, let me
point out that we have always had a
number of very distinguished scholars
who were Democrats on the Hoover staff.
