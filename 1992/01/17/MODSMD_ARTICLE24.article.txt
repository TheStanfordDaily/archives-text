## Card pulls out win under pressure Lady hoopsters light up, defeat Trojans 87-72 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
Against USC last night, the Pacific 10 Con
ference champion machine that is the Stan
ford Cardinal picked up where it left off at Cal
ifornia, punched the accelerator and pulled
away to an 87-72 victory.
For the first 10 minutes of the game Stan
ford looked more like the team that lost to Cal
ifornia last week than the one which routinely
wins Pac-10 titles. The Women of Troy got the
early jump at the green light and pulled out to
a nine-point lead with 9:09 left.
About that time the Cardinal discovered the
pedal on the right, caught up and passed the
Trojans, leading by a stretch of three points at
intermission, 38-35.
At that point, Lisa Leslie had already scored
19 points on 8-of-ll shooting. The spring-load
ed 6-foot-5-inch center had rained shots from
every point on the court, and behind her shoot
ing the Trojans shot .533 as a team in the first
half.
Whereas in the first 20 minutes the Cardi
nal seemed unsettled by the Trojan press, in
the second period the team found ways to cut
through it more often.
"We wanted to press more," USC coach
Marianne Stanley said. "But our foul trouble
interfered with that."
Indeed, the Trojans accrued a major foul
debt throughout the game, with all five
starters eventually finishing the game with at

least four fouls. Having only 10 players on the
roster made the foul trouble even more crip
pling.
In contrast, only two Cardinal players fin
ished with more than one foul.
For the first 12 minutes of the second half
the game remained relatively close on the
scoreboard, but Stanford already was doing
the things it needed to do to mount a run.
The Cardinal was out-rebounding and out
shooting the Trojans. The team shifted into
overdrive on its shooting, hitting 64.3 percent
of its shots in the second period.
Val Whiting paced the team on both ends of
the floor. She stepped up her defense on Leslie,
allowing the sophomore only six second-half
points. And she red-lined her offensive engine,
scoring a torrid 23 points in the last 20 min
utes, for a career-high total of 35 points. She
also snagged a game-high nine rebounds.
"(Playing against Leslie) is a big fire-up for
me," Whiting said. "When people call her the
next Cheryl Miller and talk about how great
she is, it really makes me want to stop her."
"Val is bigger and stronger than most cen
ters I have to face," Leslie said. "She really
banged into me and tried to move me. And
when I got into foul trouble there wasn't really
much I could do except stand under the basket."
Whiting provided the horsepower, but the
player who drove the Cardinal machine was
freshman Tanda Rucker.
Rucker's performance transcended statis
tics. Playing with great confidence, she provid-

Ed the fans with several exciting plays. Like
slashing through a full-court press with four
Trojans essentially ironed on to her jersey, or
burning the defense for a baseline lay-up.
Rucker attributed her loose play to "being
real in tune in practice, especially on defense."
Meanwhile, Molly Goodenbour and Rachel
Hemmer were doing some slashing and burn
ing of their own. Hemmer's extra hours in
practice paid off, as her offense reemerged. She
also — along with Whiting — picked off a cou
ple of passes at the top of the key and ran them
back for easy lay-ups.
Goodenbour, like Rucker, burned the
defenses with perimeter shots, driving lay-ups
and assists. She banged home two key treys in
the first half.
In fact, in contrast to the Cal game in which
almost every Cardinal player struggled, virtu
ally every player last night played quite well,
especially as the game wore on.
"It seemed to me that they were a little bet
ter conditioned," Stanley said. "It was a three
point game with 7:55 left, and then — BANG
— the roof caved in." She also attributed part
of the last-minute let-down to her team's rela
tive lack of depth.
Stanford will try to rev up its engine again
this weekend against UCLA, which is led by
high-octane forward Rehema Stephens. Tip
off is at 7:30 p.m. at Maples on Saturday night.
The Bruins are once again one of the stronger
Pac-10 teams and should pose yet another
challenge.
