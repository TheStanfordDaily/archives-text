# Card heads north to indoor tourney
## 
### Amy Howard Staff writer 
Members of the Stanford
men's tennis team will begin
play in the second annual
Pacific-10 Indoor Tourna
ment at Washington today.
Players from nine Pac-10
schools will compete through
out the weekend to improve
their individual national rank
ings and get a feel for the com
petition they will be facing in
upcoming dual matches.
Stanford enters the tour
nament ranked No. 3 in the
preseason Volvo/ITCA rank
ings behind No. 1 UCLA and
No. 2 USC. California, ranked
No. 14, and No. 19 Arizona
State will also send their top
players to the tournament.
"The nice thing about this
tournament is that there are
eight players who enter and
four doubles teams that play
[from each school]," said
coach Dick Gould. "Last week
we played in a tournament in
Palm Springs, but only four
people got to go. This week
end will be a good follow-up
for them, and it will give the
other guys a chance to play."
The first flight of the tour
nament consists of the No. 1
and No. 2-seeded players from
each school. Stanford's repre
sentatives will be senior Alex
O'Brien and sophomore Chris
Cocotos. O'Brien enters as
the No. 1-ranked player in the
country and the tournament's
defending singles champion.
Filling the No. 3 and No. 4
spots will be sophomore
Robert Devens and fifth-year
senior Jason Yee. Devens won
the Northern California Rolex
doubles title with Michael
Flanagan this fall and reached
the semifinals in the singles

draw of that tournament. Yee
is ranked No. 4 nationally
with O'Brien in doubles, and
was undefeated in dual match
es in doubles last season.
Sophomore Vimal Patel,
who teamed with Cocotos to
reach the finals of the NorCal
Rolex doubles tournament in
the fall, will play at No. 5.
Joining him in the third flight
of the tournament will be
sophomore Billy Wright.
Rounding out the travelling
team will be junior Roman
Sydorak and freshman Mihir
Mankad. Mankad, a walk-on
from Bombay, is the only new
addition to the team this year.
The sole element missing
from the Cardinal's line-up
will be sophomore Michael
Flanagan, currently ranked
No. 12 in the nation, who is
still suffering from a sore
wrist. This will preclude a
Flanagan-Yee doubles tandem
in the tournament, a combi
nation Gould would like to
experiment with. Instead, Yee
will pair up with Wright, and
the remaining duos will be
O'Brien-Cocotos, Devens-
Patel, and Mankad-Sydorak.
In what could be a rebuild
ing year for the team follow
ing the loss of Jared Palmer
and Jonathan Stark to the
professional circuit, Gould
will be carefully evaluating
the performance of each of his
players and noting the success
of the doubles combinations.
"In this type of tourna
ment everybody plays at dif
ferent times, so it's possible to
really focus in on a match,"
Gould said. "That makes the
tournament doubly valuable.
I'm really excited about look
ing at some of these new guys
who haven't played that
much."
