# Shrine game Sunday at Stanford Stadium Cal's Treggs returns to Farm
## 
### Quinn Moo Staff writer 
The color. The action. The
pageantry. Sunday's 67th Annual
East-West Shrine Football Clas
sic and Pageant at Stanford Sta
dium promises this and much
more for 72 of college football's
top seniors and the 100,000 active
patients receiving care at
Shriner's Hospitals.
"This is the biggest of all the
All-Star games. It means so much
to meet the kids and mingle with
those who are less blessed. To
touch the heart of a child is fan
tastic," said Wisconsin corner
back Troy Vincent, one of five
consensus first-team All-Ameri
cans participating.
Players visited the Shriner's
Hospital in downtown San Fran
cisco Tuesday evening to see the
direct benefits of the Shrine
Game — which has raised over
$11 million since 1925, according
to Shriner's statistics.
"Visiting the hospital gives us
the sober slap in the face," said
Cal All-American offensive tackle
Troy Auzenne.
Robert Porcher, a highly tout
ed defensive tackle out of South
Carolina State, said he "really
enjoyed the visit .... I've never
been out here to California, to the
San Francisco area."
Besides its primary purpose, to
raise money for 22 Shriners Hos
pitals scattered across North
America, the Shrine Game also
allows gifted athletes to showcase
their talents to over 100 NFL
scouts, trainers and executives, as
well as the fans. Shrine statistics
predict a crowd hovering around
70,000, and ESPN will televise
the contest nationally.
"I'm so glad they [the scouts]
are here .... Hopefully I'll make
a difference out there and see

where, and if, I get drafted at all,"
said Robert Porcher, defensive
tackle for South Carolina State.
These players will have no
problem attracting the attention
of scouts. Workouts on Stanford
practice fields near DeGuerre
pool and behind Maples Pavilion
attracted almost 200 onlookers,
journalists and scouts. Middle
aged men, many wearing caps and
clothing from NFL teams, clicked
stopwatches and jotted notes on
players. One scout was speaking
on a hand-held phone.
Ohio State running back Car
los Snow, who was not invited
until Vaughn Dunbar dropped
out, is looking "to make the most
of my break, and get picked up."
But Cal wide receiver Brian
Treggs offers a different perspec
tive on scouting: "I'll showcase
my talents and get the job done . .
. . It doesn't take 28 teams to love
you, only takes one."
Dreams of the NFL draft aside,
once the players set foot on the
field the intensity and level of
play cranks a notch closer to pro
level.
"There's a lot more pressure.
You try to look as good as you can
.... This is much more intense
than college," said Penn State
defensive back Leonard
Humphries.
Vincent says practicing with
players he had "read and heard
about" reassures him. "It feels
different. You get more confi
dence because you know that
they'll make the drop, make the
play if it comes their way."
In some ways, the Shrine
Game brings players together
who have sweated, excelled and
even taunted each other during
the regular season.
"The first thing I thought —
I'd be playing with guys I talked
trash to all year," Treggs said.
