# Wrestlers grapple with Aggies tomorrow

### Mike Langford Staff writer 
The Stanford wrestling team will host UC-
Davis tomorrow in its first dual meet of the
new year. The Cardinal is coming off of some
major successes at the Aggie Open last week
end — however, injuries and other holes in
the line up are going to bring about some very
creative weight match-ups.
"We have to juggle the weights to overcome
injuries," said coach Chris Horpel. "It should
be interesting."
At 118 pounds, junior Phil Nowick seems
to be recovered from a shoulder injury, and
will wrestle. He will most likely go up against
Curtis Yagi, who Cardinal redshirting fresh
man Matt Cano defeated at the Aggie Open by
a score of 8-1.
Sophomore Ramy Saad, who up to now was
reportedly redshirting this year, will wrestle
in the 126 pound slot, up from his normal
wrestling weight of 118 pounds. However, his
probable opponent, Juan Reyna, is also
wrestling heavy as a normal 118 pounder.
What's more, Reyna was pinned in the Aggie
by Stanford's Cano in the 118 pound final last
weekend.

Junior Dave Nowick is also back from a
knee injury, but will wrestle at 134 pounds,
up from his normal 126 pounds. His probable
opponent, Sam Jensen, was beaten at the
Aggie by Stanford's redshirting freshman
Jimmy Aguirre. Even though Nowick is
wrestling heavy, Jensen shouldn't be too
much of a problem for Nowick, assuming his
knee holds up. "Dave's knee will be a problem
off and on all season," Horpel said.
Sophomore Jay Jackson is looking for
some real competition, and it seems the only
way to do that is to wrestle heavier competi
tion, so he too will wrestle heavy at 142
pounds, up from his normal 134 pounds. He
will be pitted against Tim Cano, Davis' top
wrestler. Incidentally, Cano is the brother of
Stanford's redshirting freshman Matt. But
it is doubtful the family ties will affect Jack
son. "He's been looking very good," Horpel
said.
At 150 pounds, junior Dave Sacks is taking
off the redshirt. He will wrestle in a regula
tion meet for the Cardinal by taking on Aggie
Dwight Weevie, who has beaten Stanford's
Jeremy Friedman twice. Sacks had an impres
sive showing at the Aggie Open, however.
At 158 pounds, Davis' Thomas Branca has
beaten Stanford's junior Bob Becker twice

and freshman Sahlan Martin once. Becker,
the regular at this weight, has an injured
shoulder, which will enable Martin to attempt
to avenge his loss to Branca in the finals last
weekend.
Greg Green, coming off a knee injury, will
wrestle for the Cardinal at 167 pounds. His
probable opponent is Clinton Birch, who
Stanford's usual 167 pounder — senior Matt
Topham — has beaten twice.
At 177 pounds, Topham will wrestle up a
weight. He will most likely face Joe Strusinki,
who pinned Green at the Aggie. Topham has
been wrestling very well, however, and should
be an excellent match for Strusinki.
Senior Mark Graham will be Stanford's
representative in the 190 pound class, and
will wrestle Davis' Pat Guire. Although Guire
is good, Graham has nearly invincible lately,
and did beat Guire in the Aggie.
Unfortunately, Stanford will have to for
feit the heavyweight class for lack of a
wrestler.
In all, four wrestlers will be wrestling
heavier than their normal weights, making
for some very competitive matches. The meet
will begin in Burnham Pavilion at 7:30 p.m.,
and should be an excellent opportunity to see
some Stanford wrestling excellence.
