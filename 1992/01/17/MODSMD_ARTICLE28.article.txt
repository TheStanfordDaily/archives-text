# Spartans' Shea takes charge of Cardinal offense
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Editorial staff 
Terry Shea emerged from
the week-long Bay Area coach
ing mishmash smelling like
roses.
A few days ago, Shea got
passed over for the California
head coaching job in favor of
Keith Gilbertson, but yesterday
the former San Jose State head
coach was named Bill Walsh's
assistant head coach/offensive
coordinator.
Shea said the chance to work
with Bill Walsh was a major rea
son he came to Stanford.
"I saw it as a great opportu
nity I couldn't pass up. I don't
know how many years Bill will
continue coaching so this is a
chance of a lifetime, to work
with Bill Walsh here at Stan
ford," Shea said. "I don't think,
in the last 20 years, there's been
a greater offensive mind than
Bill Walsh."
Shea said it was painful to
leave San Jose State. "It was
the most emotional decision I've
ever had to make in my life," he
said.
Shea had a 15-6-2 record in
two years as Spartan head
coach. In 1990, he led San Jose
State to a 9-2-1 record, national
ranking and California Bowl

victory.
A job at Stanford was not
even under consideration until
long after the rumors of Walsh's
return had circulated, Shea
said. "It didn't even come up
until Tuesday night. Then all of
a sudden it started to gain
momentum," he said.
Shea has known Walsh since
Shea's stint as assistant coach
at Utah State, and talked with
Walsh when the 49ers were
looking for a position coach in
1989.
When Walsh became inter
ested in the Stanford job he con
tacted Shea. "Without Terry I
might not have even taken the
job," Walsh said. "He brings us
great talent, maturity and some
real class."
Besides the chance to work
with Bill Walsh, Shea said other
aspects of the job appeal to him.
He grew up in San Mateo and
would like to stay in the Bay

Area. "I've grown up in the
shadow of Stanford University
and I've always aspired to lead a
team to the Rose Bowl. This is
an opportunity I've dreamed
about," Shea said.
Shea would like to stay in the
college coaching ranks. "The
NFL track is not my background
and not my interest," he said. "I
like to coach where there are
trees around the stadium, pom
pom girls, fight songs. . .
Walsh reportedly may be
interested in running an
NFL expansion franchise in a
few years, and his job at
Stanford would enable him to
train a staff he could take
with him.
But Shea said he doesn't
envision that scenario. "I don't
expect that to happen for me,"
Shea said. "I enjoy being a col
lege coach." He is expected to
sign a three-year contract in the
next few days.
