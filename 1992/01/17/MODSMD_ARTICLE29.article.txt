## Walsh entertains all at press conference 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Bill Walsh surprised the media
and Cardinal fans with a light
hearted approach at yesterday's
press conference — something con
sidered lacking from his three-year
run at network telvision.
He even appeared more at ease in
front of 500 people, cracking jokes
while handling tough questions.
When asked whether he had felt
comfortable as the top football com
mentator at NBC, Walsh sardon
ically replied, "You heard me,
referring to complaints from foot
ball critics about his apparent
uneasiness on the small screen.
But critics of Walsh's on-camera
personality were silenced by yester
day's performance in front of an
overwhelming media crush.
The press conference was broad
cast live on all three network radio
stations, and cameras from every
local and nation television station
were present. With photographers
intermittently setting off (lashes in

his face, Walsh seemed as if he had
never left the Farm.
He quickly slipped back into the
familiar role of bashing Pacific 10
Conference rivals. "Being an edu
cator does have redeeming value
— unless it is at USC," Walsh said.
University President Donald
Kennedy was the first to make light
of the situation as he formally
announced the new head coach,
saying that Stanford should
"receive an 'A' in Recruiting and a
'D' in Secret-Keeping 101."
Unable to resist the temptation
to tweak Kennedy and Stanford's
budget problems, Walsh said San
Francisco 49ers millionaire-owner
Ed Deßartolo, who attended the
press conference, had "graciously
agreed to underwrite much of
today's expenses."
And the new coach could not
avoid a jab at his wife Geri, who cor
rected him once during the press
inference. "Thank you again for
correcting me in public," he said
sarcastically, to the laughter of the
roedia and fans.

'Geri and I had our
usual bottle of
Chardonnay the
other night, and I
had more than my
share. Then I decid
ed to come back.'

But his explanation of how he
came to his decision to return to
Stanford was perhaps his most
entertaining comment.
"Geri and I had our usual bottle
of Chardonnay the other night, and
I had more than my share," Walsh
said. "Then I decided to come
back."

And the humor left its mark on
the players, who said they were
impressed with Walsh's perfor
mance during the press conference.
Sophomore starting quarterback
Steve Stenstrom said he was
"entertained." But he added that it
"shows how much confidence
I Walsh 1 has in himself."
