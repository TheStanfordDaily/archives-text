The Board of Directors of Freedom
Newspapers may discuss offering the
firm's chief executive position to Stanford
Provost James Rosse at their meeting
Monday.
D. Robert Segal, Freedom Newspa
pers' outgoing chief executive officer,
last night would neither confirm nor
deny that Rosse was under considera

of a successor will be on the agenda at
Monday's meeting.
Several Stanford administrators and
faculty members said they have been
told to anticipate a possible announce

An employee of the Southern Califor

the firm has been searching for some
one to replace Segal, but refused to dis

Segal, 71, said he told employees sev

soon as a successor is found.
"I've been doing it for too long," he
said yesterday. "It's time for a change
and a younger, more vital person."
Rosse would not confirm or deny that
he is contemplating a move.
Rosse was not asked about the matter
at a staff "town meeting" yesterday after

"Clearly, it would be a great opportu
nity for him," said Humanities and Sci
ences Dean Ewart Thomas. "I'd be
happy for him, but can't help feeling
personal sadness," he said.

that showed it had overstated circula
tion figures by as much as 20,000.
The revelation resulted in the firing
of two of the newspaper's circulation
managers.

Freedom Newspapers shareholder
Harry Hoiles fought for several years to
break up the family-owned corporation,
claiming his one-third share allowed
him to leave the chain and take a third
of its assets.
Hoiles lost the much-publicized case
in September, when the California
Supreme Court ruled that Hoiles was
