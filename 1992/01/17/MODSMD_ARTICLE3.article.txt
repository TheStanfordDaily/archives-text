# Rosse may be heading for Freedom
## Outgoing CEO confirms opening 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
The Board of Directors of Freedom
Newspapers may discuss offering the
firm's chief executive position to Stanford
Provost James Rosse at their meeting
Monday.
D. Robert Segal, Freedom Newspa
pers' outgoing chief executive officer,
last night would neither confirm nor
deny that Rosse was under considera
tion. But he did say that consideration
of a successor will be on the agenda at
Monday's meeting.
Several Stanford administrators and
faculty members said they have been
told to anticipate a possible announce
ment from Rosse next week.
An employee of the Southern Califor
nia-based corporation confirmed that
the firm has been searching for some
one to replace Segal, but refused to dis
cuss candidates.
Segal, 71, said he told employees sev
eral months ago that he would retire as
soon as a successor is found.
"I've been doing it for too long," he
said yesterday. "It's time for a change
and a younger, more vital person."
Rosse would not confirm or deny that
he is contemplating a move.
Rosse was not asked about the matter
at a staff "town meeting" yesterday after
noon.
"Clearly, it would be a great opportu
nity for him," said Humanities and Sci
ences Dean Ewart Thomas. "I'd be
happy for him, but can't help feeling
personal sadness," he said.
Generally considered a conservative

newspaper group, Freedom Newspapers
has had to deal with several controver
sies in the last two years.
Its flagship newspaper, The Orange
County Register, was embarrassed in
September by an independent audit
that showed it had overstated circula
tion figures by as much as 20,000.
The revelation resulted in the firing
of two of the newspaper's circulation
managers.

Freedom Newspapers shareholder
Harry Hoiles fought for several years to
break up the family-owned corporation,
claiming his one-third share allowed
him to leave the chain and take a third
of its assets.
Hoiles lost the much-publicized case
in September, when the California
Supreme Court ruled that Hoiles was

entitled only to the value of his
stock, not the assets themselves.
Freedom owns 27 daily news
papers, five weeklies and five tele
vision stations, including network
affiliates in Chattanooga, Tenn.,
and Santa Ana, Calif.
Its newspapers include the
Brownsville (Tex.) Herald, the
Colorado Springs Gazette Tele

graph and the Pulitzer Prize-win
ning Delta Democrat Times in
Greenville, Miss.
As provost, Rosse has designed
and led the consultative process
by which the University is
attempting to cut 10 percent from
its operating budget. He and Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy are expected to present
a budget proposal to the Board of
Trustees in April.
