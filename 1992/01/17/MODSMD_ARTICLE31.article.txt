# Ticket sales soar with return of Walsh to Farm
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
The ringing of telephones
marked the return of Bill Walsh to
the Farm yesterday afternoon, and
members of the Athletic Depart
ment, ticket office and booster clubs
were more than happy to take the
calls.
More than 100 inquiries for
1992 football season tickets were
made to the ticket office on Thurs
day, according to administrator
Anne Marie Krough.
The increase "has been very
noticeable," Krough said. "We've
even set up a separate voice mail
just for football. At one point, it was
full with 30 calls with names and
addresses."
Requests for football tickets far
outpaced calls for next week's
men's basketball games against
USC and No. 2 UCLA.
"The ticket office has been del
uged with phone calls, like it is the
week before opening game," said
Athletic Director Ted Leland.
Despite the increased demand,
Leland does not expect ticket prices
to rise. When asked, Leland said, "I
hope not. ... We have a hefty price
already. We need to get people in
the stands."
Walsh's presence will almost cer
tainly help in filling the seats of
Stanford Stadium. A proven winner
at both the professional and colle
giate levels, Walsh's pro-set offense
and his ability to attract top high
school talent will likely make Stan
ford football a very marketable
product.
Gene Washington, newly
appointed special assistant to the
athletic director, was brimming

with multiple marketing strategies
to take advantage of the Walsh's
name recognition.
"The things I'm going to be
involved in — marketing, commu
nity service — everything just
expands with Bill Walsh coming
back," he said. "The spotlight is on
Stanford. That makes it easier to
generate excitement — not just for
football, but for the entire athletic
department.
"We're looking to do two things:
to create excitement and to give our
events a family oriented atmo
sphere. Bill Walsh is going to bring
that."
"Bill Walsh puts Stanford foot
ball on the map nationally," added
Bob Murphy, who handles Stanford
football and basketball play-by-play
duties on radio station KCBS.
The Walsh name, along with
successful performance on the field,
could lead to a greater national fol
lowing and the perks that go with it.
Stanford may see higher sales of of
University apparel — a financial
benefit already enjoyed by schools
such as Notre Dame, Miami, and
Washington.
The arrival of Walsh has not
merely affected ticket sales. Alumni
and booster clubs are already dig
ging deeper into their pockets to
fund a program which they figure is
their ticket to Pasadena.
"We had been receiving calls
already (from donors) saying that if
we got Bill Walsh they were going to
donate more," said Dollie Runez, a
receptionist in the Athletic Depart
ment.
The Buck-Cardinal Club, an
organization of Stanford sports
supporters, expects to continue to
hear more of the same.
