# To win with Walsh
## Players ponder new defensive strategy 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
The return of Bill Walsh as Cardinal head
coach turned the row of players watching into
one long grin. Stanford football players say
they expected to win next year regardless of
who was named head coach, but question how
Walsh will get the job done.
"I think he will do good job and I think we
will win, but I wonder what he will do with the
defense," said senior J. J. Lasley. "Defense
wins championships; I'm interested in what he
will do."
With defensive coordinator Willie Shaw
apparently out of the picture, Stanford players
are naturally curious about who will take over
next year. Walsh said in the press conference
that he would not change the way Green ran
the team, but most players see that applying to
when Stanford has the ball, not when they are
defending their goal line.
"The defense could be the biggest danger for
us," said linebacker Dave Garnett. "Green
worked under Walsh, so the offensive systems
will be the same, but the defense will definitely
be a question mark. We are a close-knit group
now and should be OK, but changes could hurt
us."
A change from one head coach to another
produces natural changes that are, as of yet,
unseen with Walsh. Stanford Athletic Director
Ted Leland preached continuity during his
search for a new coach, and it is still uncertain
how much things will change. Walsh's commit
ment to Green's philosophies will not be tested

until he actually takes over as the new coach.
"It's tough to say how he will act until he
gets us into a room together as a team," said
safety Jimmy Klein. "He said he wants to put
aside formalities, so I think we will still be close
and have the sense of family that is so impor
tant."
One thing that is sure not to change is the
team's expectations of itself. When Green left,
players said that they expected next year to be
better no matter what happened, and the hir
ing of Walsh has only served to fuel their fire.
"If we have another 8-4 season, we will be
disappointed," Lasley said. "We are looking at
seasons like 10-2 or 9-1. We want it to change
so that 8-4 will be average for us."
Lineman Estevan Avila was more direct in
his approach. "We expect to go to the Rose
Bowl next year," Avila said, "Anything else and
we'll be disappointed."
Whether they meet their goals or not will
depend on recruiting. It was reported at first
that Walsh took the job with the understand
ing that he would not have to become deeply
involved with recruiting, but at the press con
ference he admitted he had already been on the
phone with some recruits and knew personal
visits to their homes were inevitable.
"The next step is getting on the plane and
visiting some homes and having the homemade
cookies and the ice milk, and then having the
dog (jump on you), searching every part of your
anatomy," Walsh said. "I don't think that has

changed."
The tongue-in-cheek response
drew heavy laughter, but accord
ing to Stanford Athletic Director
Ted Leland, Walsh is serious
about getting new people into
Cardinal uniforms.
"Bill has told me all along, 'If I
take the job I will work as hard as
I can,"' Leland said. "He has
planned recruiting trips already.
He will do recruiting and will con
trol the process."
Lasley and his teammates

believe that Walsh's decision to
come to Stanford will make com
mitted recruits more sure of their
choice, while bringing those
undecided firmly into Stanford's
camp. The returns are far from
in, but for at least one major
recruit, Stanford's new coach did
not make his decision for him, he
only made it harder.
Jeff Buckey, considered by
many to be the nation's premier
offensive tackle, said that Walsh's
decision keeps Stanford in the
running, but a head coach is only
one factor in his thought process.
"This brings Stanford right
back in the picture. [Walsh] is a
great coach who could put Stan

ford in contention for a national
championship," said 6-foot-5,
280-lb. Buckey. "I liked what I
saw there before, but don't know
how it all is now. I need to know
who will be the lineman coach
because 95% of the time I'll be
with him."
Current players, however,
believe that Walsh's mere pres
ence is enough to get excited
about the prospects of being a
part of the Stanford football pro
gram.
"This is an opportunity of a
lifetime," said quarterback Steve
Stenstrom. "It will be amazing to
work under him and absorb what
he can teach."
