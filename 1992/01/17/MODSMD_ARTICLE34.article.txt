# Top 10 budget cuts at Meyer
## 
### 
Meyer will soon vanish if it does not watch the
budget ax carefully. The top 10 cuts that may help
Meyer turn a profit and save some pennies are:
10. Turn the lobby into an a cappella perfomance
center, charging admission.
9. Open a paper-writing service, of course charging
a hefty fee.
8. Get rid of the typewriters (correction: typewriter).
7. Open massage parlors on the sundecks.
6. Charge for use of the media center's XXX videos.
5. Open the fifth floor sports bar to the general
public.
4. Board up the windows when they get dirty.
3. Run 26 "Home Businesses" with the Macintosh
computers.
2. Sell off books, and turn the third and fourth
floors into a new Woolworth's.
1. If all else fails, demolish it and make it an A+
parking lot.
