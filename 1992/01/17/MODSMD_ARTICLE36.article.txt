Dear Bug Me,
Just how much nudity and/or
sexual content can you have in a
photograph and still get it devel
oped by a commercial developer ?
Anxiously awaiting your reply,

My first thought was to
answer this question empirically.
I was going to submit rolls of film
for developing with incrementally
more nudity and sexual content. I
figured that at some point I
would get something other than
just my pictures back — some
thing like a solicitation to star in
a pornographic film, or a knock at
my door in the middle of the
night by the morality police. Or
they simply wouldn't develop the
pictures.
But what if I wanted to run for
an elected office, or be on the
Supreme Court, some day? Sure
ly, the people who work at those
photo developing places must
make copies of the choice pics for
their own personal enjoyment
(and save them in case the sub-

jects become famous). I can just
see it, 10 years from now, there'd
be a sexually explicit photo of me
in a newspaper, and the caption
would read something like
"Supreme Court nominee advo
cates free love."
So, instead, I called up the
Kodak processing lab over on
Page Mill Road and talked to a
helpful customer service repre

sentative named Ingrid. She told
me that they would develop pho
tos with total frontal nudity, no
problem.
Ingrid did say, however, that
nudity along with any "sexual
contact" would not be developed.
(She explicitly said that a naked
couple holding hands would be
okay, though.) But, be warned,
this fairly open minded policy is
not a government standard and
can vary from place to place —
your best bet is always a Polaroid
for those truly memorable pic
tures.
My friend Tricia had an inter
esting experience when she tried
to develop two revealing pictures
that she had taken of my friend
Rolf. One was a shot of his butt,
and the other was a frontal shot
with him holding a washcloth
over his manhood. But Tricia
tried to get them developed IN
UTAH. The one with the wash
cloth was developed fine. But, not
only did they not develop the one
of his butt, they destroyed the
negative, too!
Without eternal vigilance it
can happen here.
