# Psychic escapade in Palo Alto hardly psychedelic, but expensive
## 
### Ken Wharton Staff writer 
I wasn't sure what to expect. I mean,
we had always driven right past it on the
way to Blockbuster and made fun of
those tacky neon palms in the windows,
but I had never actually considered going
inside for a psychic reading.
You know, we'd be cruising by, and
somebody would make a crack about how
this place could possibly make enough to
stay in business, especially when it has to
compete with both the Bridge and those
funky Biorhythm Scrolls you see in the
checkout aisles at Safeway.
But there I was (at the psychic's, not
Safeway), about to spend perfectly good
money to find out if there was actually
something to this extrasensory stuff, or
if it was all just based on scamming

gullible people like myself.
I have to admit that I was a bit skepti
cal. Sure, I read my horoscope every now
and then, but it always says obscure
things like: "Stay away from copy
machines today; an ounce of prevention
can lead a horse to water, but a stitch in
time is better than stapling your eyelids
to your forehead." So I wasn't that opti
mistic, but I was willing to give it a
chance.
As I stepped into the room I expected
to see the usual candles, cobwebs and
animal sacrifice victims that always
seem to decorate such places, but instead
it was just a plain room with a couple of
fancy chairs and a little table with the
requisite crystal ball. My psychic for the
evening turned out to be this nice little
lady in her 50s or 60s who started going
off about my future almost as soon as I

sat down.
I'm not sure why, but no one ever
seems to get a bad fortune read to them.
I mean, you'd think that someone would
go into a psychic right before they had
some sort of horrible accident with a tree
shredder, but all they would hear is:
"You're going to live a long, wonderful,
happy life and never, ever lose any of
your appendages."
At least that's what I heard. And it's
nice to be reassured and everything, but
I think I would have found the whole
thing a little more believable if she had
told me that I was going to end up in a
straitjacket after I finally wigged out and
attacked my roommate with a Veg-O-
Matic.
And you'd think she could have told
me something a little more useful. Like
how long it's going to be before the crack

Stanford Pavement Ripper Squad stops
digging their patently useless holes in
the middle of prime bike routes, or what
the post office does with our mail during
its several-day trek from the main build
ing to our P.O. boxes.
But no, I just got to hear about how I
would have three kids — two boys, one
girl — and that something big was going
to happen to me in a couple of months.
(Presumably these two items weren't
related.) Other than that, there was just
a vague warning not to reveal any of my
secrets, but I figure nobody reads this far
anyway.
Now I'm not trying to put psychics
down, but if I were going to make up
someone's fortune I would have said
almost the exact same stuff. Oh, sure, I
would have thrown in more random com
ments for the other person to mull over,

like: "A small reptile will be entering your
life in the near future, unless you stop
sleeping with your mouth open." But the
general idea would have been the same:
Don't say anything that the other person
could possibly disprove, at least not
before they've forked over $39.
But it wasn't an entirely negative
experience. I must say that I left the
place with a smile on my face and a more
positive attitude about my future. I
didn't even wear my seat belt. As a mat
ter of fact, going to a psychic is an adven
ture that I highly recommend for anyone
out there who honestly feels, deep down,
that they could get reimbursed by The
Dailv.
