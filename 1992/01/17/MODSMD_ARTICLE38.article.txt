# Gymnasts debut at home against Titans
## 
### Brandi Shipp Staff writer 
The Stanford women's gym
nastics team hopes to prove
tonight just how sweet revenge
can be.
In their first home meet of
the season, the Cardinal
women get a chance at revenge
with the Titans of Cal State-
Fullerton, against whom the
Cardinal opened up their sea
son last weekend down in
Southern California. The
Titans, who were ranked No.
20 before last week's meet,
edged out ahead of the No. 18
Stanford women by less than
one and a half points.
Although the meet went
down as a defeat for the Stan
ford team, in actuality, it was
anything but that. "We were
happy with the meet," said
freshman Jene Elzie. "We went
down there to perform, and
that is what we did."
To say the least. The Stan
ford women racked up a final
score of 184.05, the highest
first-meet score that the
women's team has earned since
coach Breck Greenwood came
aboard.
Despite the closeness of last
week's opener, the team spirit
has not been dampened, and
they head into tonight's compe
tition with renewed confidence.
"We are really team-oriented,"
said sophomore Laurie West.
"We will be able to get pumped
up because we know that we
can beat [Fullerton], and this
meet will give us a chance to

prove it to them."
Despite the fact that this
week's match-up is against the
same competitor, the Cardinal
women are confident that the
final score will tell a different
story this time. The past few
days have given them a chance
to iron out some of the wrinkles
that put a win last weekend
just beyond of their reach.
Last week's opening meet
provided the team with an
opportunity to gauge their
progress. Not only were they
able to see what they had
accomplished, but were also
able to locate the areas that
needed more fine-tuning.
Because of their less-than-ideal
performance on the floor exer
cise, the team has focused more
time on that during the week's
practices.
The week has also given the
team a chance to recuperate
from various injuries. Tonight,
they head into the competition
with "a few aches and pains,
but no major injuries."
The most surprising thing
about the Cardinal team is that
under all of the talent and
desire is a relatively young
team. With eight freshmen and
sophomores, and one lone
junior, the team is still a little
wet behind the ears in colle
giate competition. However,
this lack of experience has
affected neither their desire
nor their ability to win. "We
have been working really hard,
and we know that we can do
really well this year," Elzie
said.
