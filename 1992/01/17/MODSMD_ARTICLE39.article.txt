# Men take on tough Wolverines
## 
### Tish Williams Staff writer 
With the Pacific-10 Champi
onships behind them, and the
Olympic Trials only four races
away, the men's swim team
faces a crucial meet this week
end in Michigan.
The Cardinal will compete
against Michigan today and
tomorrow, trying to break
Michigan's four-year home win
ning-streak. Stanford is looking
to preserve its perfect dual meet
record for this season.
"We always pound them pret
ty well at NCAAs, but they're 4-
0 against us in dual meets," said
head coach Skip Kenney.
Stanford crushed the Texas
Longhorns earlier this season
making this year's Cardinal
squad out to be one of the best
teams ever in collegiate swim

ming.
But Texas was in hard train
ing at the time, and Stanford was
gearing up for Pac-lOs.
The tables are turned now as
the Cardinal is putting in hard
training for the Olympic Trials
while Michigan is prepping for
the Big-Ten championships.
"They're the best in their con
ference and they have no trouble
beating the other teams in the
Big-Ten. They can just sit there
and get ready for us," Kenney
said.
Stanford will be relying on its
powerhouse swimmers, such as
world-record holder Jeff Rouse
and American-record holder
Brian Reterrer.
Michigan beat UCLA and USC
last weekend, influencing Ken
ney to take 20 swimmers to
Michigan instead of the 16 he
had planned to take.

"Their coach predicted a
Michigan 'slaughter' . . . but
that's a long way to go to get
beat," Kenney said.
The key to a Stanford victory
lies in the freestyle events, where
the Cardinal needs to block out
Michigan's talented 50 and 100
meter freestyler.
While Michigan customarily
sweeps the diving events, Stan
ford's improved diving squad can
expect to split the Michigan
divers for extra points.
A major factor in the Michi
gan meet is the 3,000-plus crowd
that is expected to attend. In the
new swimming facilities, there is
usually a standing-room only
crowd.
"What we feel we can do on
paper is never true at Michigan,"
Kenney said, "but if these guys
are going to be a part of history,
they've got to beat Michigan."
