# Rosse winds down a quarter century
## 
### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
James Rosse's position behind
the wheel of the Provost's Office
is just the latest in his long Stan
ford career.
A faculty member in economics
for two decades before becoming
provost in 1984, Rosse has also
been chair of the Department of
Economics and director of the
Stanford Center for Economic
Policy Research.
On a national level, he is
regarded as an expert in the eco
nomics of newspapers and regu
lated mass communication indus
tries. This reputation could
explain why a Southern Califor
nia media chain may now be
interested in hiring him as its
chief executive officer.
As provost, Rosse has been
Stanford's second-highest admin
istrator, a position that, according
to one administrative assistant,
"entails representing faculty and
academics in making decisions for
the University.
"He has a broad constituency in
all the schools of the University
that has many demands and
needs, especially during the bud
get crisis. His other responsibili
ties range from overseeing faculty
appointments to arranging for vis
iting scholars," the assistant said.
Rosse's tenure has coincided
with challenging times for the
University.
He made headlines in 1989
because of his investigation of the
University's compliance with its
affirmative action policies. Citing a

gap between Stanford's accomplish
ments and goals, he said, "We need
to develop progress to go along with
the responsibility of having drawn a
more diverse student body."
At the same time, he charged a
task force to review the recommen
dations of the University Committee
on Minority Issues and decide which
aspects should be implemented.
During the past two years, he
has spent much of his time manag
ing the allocation of budget cuts
and staff layoffs from 1990's
"repositioning" and the new round
of reductions.
As it became clear that last
year's indirect-cost controversy
would force additional budget
cuts, Rosse often became the bear
er of bad news at the Faculty Sen
ate, offering the latest estimate of
how much would need to be sliced.
He has spearheaded the bud
get-cutting efforts that have dom
inated the headlines this year,
chairing the Cabinet Committee
on Budget and Strategic Planning
and taking the heat for many of
the difficult reduction targets.
In one of Rosse's earlier reposi
tioning efforts, he developed the
Office of Student Resources to
replace a less centralized structure.
He led the search committee for a
vice president to lead the depart
ment, and early this month decided
to hire Mary Edmonds over Sally
Mahoney, the acting vice president.
According to some University
officials, Rosse is expected to remain
at Stanford until at least the conclu
sion of the budget-cutting process.
An acting provost would then be
appointed for the interim.
