# Soto returns, safe and sound, to Wilbur home
## 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
After being stolen more than three-and-half
months ago, Soto, the cement dog that for years stood
as faithful mascot to the Wilbur Hall dorm that shares
his name, was finally returned home Wednesday.
The cement dog arrived at about 3:40 p.m., wear
ing a burgundy bow tie and securely seat-belted in
the back seat of a silver limousine.
The cement dog was received by 40 eager Soto
residents, who immediately held a reception.
The two limousine drivers said they were paid in
cash and did not know the names or location of the
people who hired them.
Soto President Dan Stearns said he spotted five
or six people lazily tossing around a football on the
lawn outside the dorm, looking like they were wait
ing for something. When the dog arrived, they were
suddenly gone, he added.
Resident assistant Dev Patnaik called Stanford
Police at 3:48 p.m. to report Soto's return, but Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer said he had no leads and does not
plan to pursue the case.
The cement dog was returned with little damage
other than a shorter, rounded nose and some paint
marks on his back, Stearns said after carefully
examining the statue.
"Whoever took it had a real love for that cement dog.
Probably someone with an Oedipal complex," said Pat
naik. "But what do I know. I've only taken Psych 1."
The captors, true to their demands that the
cement dog be kept unchained in the future, failed to
return Soto's lock and chain. Patnaik said the dorm
will try to find another method of tethering the stat
ue, such as attaching him to a security alarm.
Last night, however, Soto sat unfettered in the
lounge, neither guarded nor chained.
Although not seeking revenge, Patnaik said he is
already working on a scheme to discover the identi
ty of the captors.
"Just because Kennedy died doesn't mean people
forget who did it,"he said.
Stearns said Soto will be throwing a "Welcome
Back Soto Party" next Friday.
