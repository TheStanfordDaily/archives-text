## Upswing in requests for aid coincides with reduced funds 
### Adam Stein Staff writer 
Since the onset of the recession, more
and more students have requested larg
er financial aid packages, a trend that
may force the Financial Aid Office to
revise the way it assesses student need.
According to Nan McKenna, Assis
tant Director for Need Analysis, revision
requests — which are essentially appeals
for larger financial aid packages — pro
vide the best indicator of the economy's
effects on student need, and these
requests have increased by about one
third since last year, and 80 percent
since 1988.
"We're definitely seeing a jump in
requests for revision. . . . More people
are expressing dissatisfaction with our
offers," McKenna said.
And the upswing in requests comes at
a time when University officials are
scrambling to save money. Financial Aid
is currently reducing its budget by $2.5
million, which will reduce student
grants from Stanford sources by about
10 percent.
So far this year, the office has
received 915 revision requests, as com
pared to 689 last year and 543 in 1988.
In addition, Financial Aid received
3,710 applications for aid this year, 65
more than in 1991. McKenna said this
was a significant increase.
Because Stanford maintains a need

blind admission policy, the number of
requests for aid is unpredictable, as is
the total amount of aid needed.
When designing aid packages, Finan
cial Aid uses congressional methodology
(CM), a formula that takes into account
a family's income and assets.
"You shove the numbers through the
formula, look at the result, and dispense
the appropriate amount of aid," McKen
na said. "We're required by federal law
to meet the computed need."
She attributed the increase in revision
requests to flaws in the formula and a
lack of confidence in the economy. "CM
is very hard on the middle income and
up," McKenna said. "The [formula] itself
is becoming less and less realistic as time
goes on. . . . The majority of revision
requests have come from what is tradi
tionally considered the middle income.
"Another factor is people's percep
tions of the economy. People know that
things aren't good, and they're under
standably worried," she said.
The office dispenses three forms of aid
— loans, grants and student jobs. How
ever, the pool of aid money is limited, and
significant increases in student need may
affect the way funds are distributed.
"Loans can conceivably run out,"
McKenna said. "But there are a number
of different types of loans, and one can
almost always be found."
