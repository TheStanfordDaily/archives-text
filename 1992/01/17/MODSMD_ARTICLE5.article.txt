## Upswing in requests for aid coincides with reduced funds 
### Adam Stein Staff writer 
Since the onset of the recession, more
and more students have requested larg
er financial aid packages, a trend that
may force the Financial Aid Office to
revise the way it assesses student need.
According to Nan McKenna, Assis
tant Director for Need Analysis, revision
requests — which are essentially appeals
for larger financial aid packages — pro
vide the best indicator of the economy's
effects on student need, and these
requests have increased by about one
third since last year, and 80 percent
since 1988.
"We're definitely seeing a jump in
requests for revision. . . . More people
are expressing dissatisfaction with our
offers," McKenna said.
And the upswing in requests comes at
a time when University officials are
scrambling to save money. Financial Aid
is currently reducing its budget by $2.5
million, which will reduce student
grants from Stanford sources by about
10 percent.
So far this year, the office has
received 915 revision requests, as com
pared to 689 last year and 543 in 1988.
In addition, Financial Aid received
3,710 applications for aid this year, 65
more than in 1991. McKenna said this
was a significant increase.
Because Stanford maintains a need

blind admission policy, the number of
requests for aid is unpredictable, as is
the total amount of aid needed.
When designing aid packages, Finan
cial Aid uses congressional methodology
(CM), a formula that takes into account
a family's income and assets.
"You shove the numbers through the
formula, look at the result, and dispense
the appropriate amount of aid," McKen
na said. "We're required by federal law
to meet the computed need."
She attributed the increase in revision
requests to flaws in the formula and a
lack of confidence in the economy. "CM
is very hard on the middle income and
up," McKenna said. "The [formula] itself
is becoming less and less realistic as time
goes on. . . . The majority of revision
requests have come from what is tradi
tionally considered the middle income.
"Another factor is people's percep
tions of the economy. People know that
things aren't good, and they're under
standably worried," she said.
The office dispenses three forms of aid
— loans, grants and student jobs. How
ever, the pool of aid money is limited, and
significant increases in student need may
affect the way funds are distributed.
"Loans can conceivably run out,"
McKenna said. "But there are a number
of different types of loans, and one can
almost always be found."
"Job money is infinite," she
continued. "However, grant
money can run out, and it has in
the past. Basically, if that hap
pened, we would have to give out
more loans and jobs."
Although the financial aid pool
is augmented by donations, the

majority of the funds come directly
from Stanford's operating budget.
In the coming weeks, the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aid will propose
the level of next year's aid fund.
Should the funds earmarked
for financial aid remain static or
decrease, "We'll have to change
the way we do business," McKen
na said.
One proposal under considera
tion is a change in Stanford's pol

icy toward divorced parents of
financial aid recipients. Current
ly, Stanford deals exclusively with
the parent who has custody of the
student, but the University may
begin asking noncustodial par
ents for additional contributions.
Such a policy has already been
adopted at several Ivy League Uni
versities, as well as at Caltech and
Duke. According to McKenna, the
proposal has received "mixed feed
back from Stanford students."

Other proposals include possi
ble changes in the way student
need is calculated, although the
congressional methodology has
set fairly rigid standards.
These changes will not affect
current students.
"One of the things we're com
mitted to is keeping the current
student body at the same level of
financial aid. Any changes will be
implemented on incoming class
es," McKenna said.

the level of next year's aid fund.
Should the funds earmarked
for financial aid remain static or
decrease, "We'll have to change
the way we do business," McKen
na said.
One proposal under considera
tion is a change in Stanford's pol

icy toward divorced parents of
financial aid recipients. Current
ly, Stanford deals exclusively with
the parent who has custody of the
student, but the University may
begin asking noncustodial par
ents for additional contributions.
Such a policy has already been
adopted at several Ivy League Uni
versities, as well as at Caltech and
Duke. According to McKenna, the
proposal has received "mixed feed
back from Stanford students."

Other proposals include possi
ble changes in the way student
need is calculated, although the
congressional methodology has
set fairly rigid standards.
These changes will not affect
current students.
"One of the things we're com
mitted to is keeping the current
student body at the same level of
financial aid. Any changes will be
implemented on incoming class
es," McKenna said.
