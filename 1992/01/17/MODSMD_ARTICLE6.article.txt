# Lively Arts may be dying out
## Performances slashed to reduce budget 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The Lively Arts at Stanford will likely
undergo drastic cuts next year as the Office
of Public Affairs works to meet its
$650,000 budget-reduction target.
"It will be a pretty severe cut," said Lois
Wagner, director of University Events and
Services. Lively Arts, which brings a vari
ety of performers to Stanford, is sponsored
by Events and Services.
The number of Lively Arts programs
will be cut to only 10 or 12 next year, down
from as many as 50 before repositioning in
1989-90.
"We will keep as much as we can, and we
will continue to maintain high quality in
the 10 to 12 programs we do," Wagner said.
"This is the wrong time for us to be making
cuts because of the economy. We can't look
to increase ticket prices or individual con
tributions, but I hope that will turn around
eventually."
In addition to the $55,000 reduction in
Events and Services, Public Affairs Vice
President Robert Freelen said Publication
Services will lose its $177,000 subsidy from
University general funds.
"They will have to adjust their opera

tions," Freelen said. He added that neither
Publication Services nor the copy centers
can raise their rates to compensate for the
reduced funds.
Stanford News Service, which publishes
Campus Report as well as University press
releases, will reduce its budget by $50,000
"through a variety of changes," Freelen
said.
Specific proposals for reductions are in
"varying stages of development," Freelen
said. All of the divisions of Public Affairs
"have ideas and are working on plans."
"There are some core functions that
support the academic mission of the Uni
versity, and these have not been reduced
significantly," he said. "We need to deal
with the press and political constituencies.
"We are in a dilemma. At a time like
this, the demand for our services goes up,
and it is part of our challenge to meet these
responsibilities," Freelen added.
Wagner said that in addition to the
"major cuts" in Lively Arts, Events and
Services will combine a manager and
vacant supervisor job to eliminate a posi
tion previously supported by University
general funds.
There will not be cuts in the services
provided to Commencement, Wagner said.
