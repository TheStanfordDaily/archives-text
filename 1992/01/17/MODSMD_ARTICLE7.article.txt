Meeting set to discuss fine
University officials will meet with the
California Environmental Protection
Agency this month to discuss the possi
ble removal of the $186,000 fine levied
against Stanford in November.
Thomas Mcßride, director of Envi
ronmental Health and Safety, said the
conference, originally slated for last
Wednesday, has been rescheduled for
Jan. 27.
Mcßride, Assistant Director Harvey
Chock and University Counsel Lee
Thompson will participate in the confer
ence.
The fine penalized Stanford for violat
ing state regulations concerning storage
of hazardous waste. The violations, most
of which were administrative, were iden
tified during inspection several years ago.
Most violations involved improper
waste storage and labeling.
Mcßride said the meeting with EPA
officials has the effect of lodging an appeal
against the fine. He said he plans to dis
cuss the penalty itself, as well several
issues of compliance with EPA requests.
Mcßride said the EPA has requested
documentation showing that Stanford's

hazardous waste storage facility corrected
the problems uncovered in the 1988 and
1989 inspections. However, Mcßride said
the EPA had already received "volumi
nous" documentation immediately after
the inspection two years ago, and he
wants to "escape the burden of duplicat
ing documentation."
