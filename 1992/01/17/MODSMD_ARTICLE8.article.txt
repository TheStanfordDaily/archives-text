NASA looks for aliens in desert
PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — NASA will move radio and
computer equipment to the Mojave Desert next week so it
can start searching for signs of alien civilizations in outer
space, a scientist said yesterday.
"I strongly believe someday we will make contact with
other civilizations" through radio signals, said Michael
Klein, manager of Jet Propulsion Laboratory's portion of
the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project.
"Circumstantial evidence suggests countless Earth-like
planets exist in our galaxy," Klein said. "We hope someday
we'll detect the existence of other intelligent civilizations
from those planets."
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
10-year, $100 million SETI study will be the most extensive
ever conducted for signs of intelligent extraterrestrial life.
U.S., China reach trade accord
WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States and China
reached agreement late yesterday in a contentious trade
dispute involving protection of American copyrights and
patents, negotiators for both sides announced.
The agreement came only hours before the Bush admin
istration had said it would begin imposing tariffs of up to
100 percent on a range of Chinese exports to the United
States.
As a result of the successful negotiations, U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills said she was terminating the
threat of higher tariffs on up to $1.5 billion worth of Chi
nese imports'.
She said that under the agreement, China will make sig
nificant improvements in its patent and copyright laws.

"This agreement demonstrates that in an area of critical
importance to the U.S. economy, China is willing to take
important steps toward bringing its trade regime closer to
international norms," Hills said in a statement.
"Principal beneficiaries will include pharmaceutical,
entertainment, computer and agri-chemical industries,"
she said.
Yeltsin to visit Bush in White House
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin will hold talks at the White House
on Feb. 1, the White House said yesterday.
Their one-on-one meeting will come the day after they join
other heads of state at a summit in New York for leaders of
the 15 countries on the United Nations Security Council.
It will be the fourth meeting for Bush and Yeltsin,
including two previous visits by the Russian leader to the
White House.
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, who
revealed the plans for a Bush-Yeltsin meeting in an inter
view with wire service reporters, said Yeltsin is facing "a
very, very difficult" situation inside Russia and the new
Commonwealth of Independent States, the successor to the
shattered Soviet Union.
Yeltsin now draws the criticisms that plagued former
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev when he was in charge
in Moscow, Scowcroft said.
"This is a very, very tough time," said Scowcroft.
The United States must help "nourish the threads of
democracy" and help them grow, he said, "because when
ever you have the kind of chaos, turbulence and so on that
you have inside there now, there's always a tendency to go
to more draconian ways to solve problems."
