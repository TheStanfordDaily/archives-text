# Staff speak out on benefits, budget cuts
## 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Health benefits and the indirect-cost
controversy were the primary concerns
of about 100 staff and faculty members
who attended the last in a series of six
town meetings yesterday regarding
University budget cuts.
The participants, mostly staff mem
bers, were given a chance to express
their views before University schools
and administrative areas submit their
final budget-cutting proposals today.
The panel, led by Provost James
Rosse, consisted of Dean of Research Bob
Byer, Asst. to the Provost Ted Mitchell
and Chief Financial Officer Peter Van
Etten. The discussion was mediated by
Sharon Parker, director of the Office of
Multicultural Development.
One staff member, referring to the
recent controversy over a possible
increase in health insurance fees,
accused the University of "charging

lstaff] for a Cadillac when [they] only
need a Ford."
Rosse responded that "the Ford's
tires are flat and it is no longer cost-effi
cient." He said health insurance is a
"national problem," and the University
is limited in its power to keep fees low
while offering adequate coverage.
Participants also said they were wor
ried about the recent government indi
rect-cost investigation. The panelists
responded that no plans have been made
to cover the $230 million the University
could be held accountable for because
they "do not believe it will happen."
The panelists said that the Universi
ty would have the funds were it forced
to pay, and that in that unlikely sce
nario many areas of the University
would inevitably suffer.
Drawing a parallel between the indi
rect-cost controversy and the possible lay
offs and cuts in staff salary and benefits,
one staff member said, "We feel as if the
University is going to cancel our MOUs."

Memoranda of understanding are
those contracts between Stanford and
the federal government that regulate
how the University files for indirect
cost recovery. These MOUs are now
being called into question by the gov
ernment.
One participant expressed concern
about the lack of earthquake coverage
for the University and its faculty and
staff. According to Rosse, "No amount
of earthquake insurance purchased
from an external source is a particular
ly good deal."
Instead, Rosse said, it is important to
safeguard the campus and maintain
financial assets so the University can
withstand and recover quickly and effi
ciently from an earthquake.
During the meeting, Rosse did not
comment on and was not asked about
reports that he may resign as provost
to become chief executive officer of a
Southern California-based corpora
tion.
