advanced portable operating systems.
Maybe you thought you wouldn't find much personal
challenge in personal computing. Think again.
As we move from 10 MIPS to 50-100 MIPS, we
will incorporate new technology that delivers a com
pelling benefit using that power. Like a graphical user
interface that can search large disks and distributed
networks to truly put information at your fingertips.
Like an object-oriented application framework
that lets you integrate different types of applications
and information to create rich, compound documents.
Like a symmetric, multiprocessing operating sys
tem that lets us deliver the power of advanced per
sonal computing on many platforms.
Make research a reality with Microsoft. We are
looking for Software Design Engineers to design,
develop and implement application and systems soft
ware for microcomputers. And Program Managers
who determine which features and function go into
the product. Then drive its progress through all
phases: from specification to development, testing and
documentation. Be part of the team that helps create
tomorrows leading software and gets it out the door
on time.
If you are pursuing a Bachelors, Master's or
PhD degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engi
neering (with software emphasis), Math, Physics or a
related discipline, and you have programming experi
ence, design skills and exposure to program manage
ment, we want to talk with you at our On-campus
Interviews.
We are an equal opportunity employer and are
working toward a more culturally diverse workplace.
