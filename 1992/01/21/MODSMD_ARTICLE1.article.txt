# Freedom beckons: Rosse accepts newspaper job
## Provost will stay through budget-cutting process 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Provost James Rosse was hired yesterday as
president and chief executive officer of Free
dom Newspapers Inc. and will leave Stanford at
the conclusion of the budget-reduction process.
Rosse, the University's chief academic and
budget officer, will officially resign April 15,
after he and University President Donald
Kennedy present a comprehensive budget
package to the Board of Trustees.
Kennedy will select an interim provost to
serve from April 16 until a permanent succes
sor is chosen by Stanford's next president.
Rosse was the only academic out of several
dozen people considered for the position, said
outgoing Freedom chief executive D. Robert
The other candidates found in the
national search were all newspaper executives.
Although the company's board had the

final choice of a president, Rosse's selection
was almost a formality after a search commit
tee recommended him last week.
"He was far and away the best of many can
didates," Segal said.
The son of a Nebraska newspaper editor,
Rosse is a nationally recognized authority on
the economics of newspapers and communica
tion media.

"It brings together my knowledge and
interest in media and requires the managerial
and leadership capacity I have developed as
provost. It will be an exciting and challenging
thing to do," Rosse said last night.
Kennedy was out of town this weekend. In
a statement, he said Rosse has "given superb
leadership to our efforts to make Stanford's

administrative organization more effective."
Faculty members and senior administrators
said yesterday that strong candidates for the
interim position include Associate Dean of Engi
neering Charles Kruger; Business Prof. Charles
Holloway; Statistics Prof. Gerald Lieberman;
Economics Prof. Emeritus Kenneth Arrow; and
Michael Smith, dean of the School of Education.
Although Kennedy has not said when he
will select an interim provost, it is unlikely
that he will do so before the next Board of
Trustees meeting Feb. 13.
Freedom Newspapers owns 26 daily news
papers — mostly in California and the South
— as well as five weeklies, five television sta
tions and a cable television news service. Its
flagship paper, the Orange County Register,
has a circulation of 350,000.
Rosse said he plans to return to Stanford as
an emeritus professor after he finishes his work
at Freedom.

lenging thing to do.'
