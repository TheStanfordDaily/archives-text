ASSU should use limits
on money, fliers to help
elections gain creativity

IN LESS THAN 10 WEEKS'
time, Stanford will once more
be in the middle of its annual
spring quarter campaign circus. If
the gross quantity of fliers, ban
ners and electronic mail of last
year's race is any indication, the
Farm is in for yet another paper
deluge this year.
Whether the flood can be avoided
is largely up to the ASSU Senate,
which is currently in the process of
its usual table-and-wait amend
ment-passing procedure regarding
a very comprehensive election
reform bill.
This bill should be scrutinized.
In its original drafting, the bill pro
poses to do away with campaign
spending and flier limits. This is a
very dangerous idea. As previous
elections have shown us, the
extravagant use of paper products
to advertise candidates results in
an enormous multi-colored mess
in most dorms, toilet stalls and
public places on campus. This is
extremely bad for the environ
ment, for even if all papers used
are recycled — obviously an unre
alistic assumption — it is a ridicu
lous waste of a resource.
Also, if money limitations are
lifted, not only will the senate be
filled with resume packers, it will
be filled with over-privileged
resume packers. Without limits,
elections would be free-for-alls, in
which some candidates could
quickly move from ridiculous
amounts of fliers to ridiculous
amounts of skywriting, celebrity
endorsements and the like while
those less wealthy would be stuck
with virtual anonymity.
It is evident then that we need
limits, but at the same time, the cur
rent limits are insufficient. To solve
the problem, what must happen is
that campaign expenditure limits

must be raised, with yearly adjust
ments for inflation, and flier limits
must be reduced, with specific limits
for various areas on campus.
Candidates for the senate must
show that they spend no more than
$100 on their campaigns and post
no more than 300 fliers during the
race. Council of Presidents slates
should be allowed $300 and be held
to 500 fliers. Hopeful senior class
presidents should be able to spend
$100 and use 300 fliers. A $75 limit
should be placed on the campaigns
of candidates for the Student Con
duct Legislative Council with 200
fliers being the tree by-products
limit.
These limits would encourage
more creative campaigning by the
candidates since they would not be
able to spend as much on fliers.
Something original might actually
happen in someone's campaign, as
might, God forbid, something that
does not pollute the campus.
Enforcement of these limits is
obviously an issue, and to deal with
this problem, limits on the number
of fliers per area on campus should
be instituted. These limits should
require that no more than one flier
be placed in each dormitory/resi
dence. Also, no more than one flier
should be placed in each academic
building. A limit of one flier per
outdoor bulletin board would also
serve to reduce the environmental
carnage that occurs every time it
rains during an election.
Candidates should submit
detailed expense accounts and item
ized receipts of their expenditures
to the Elections Commissioner
within 48 hours of their spending,
and any campaign expenditures not
accounted for should be investigat
ed.
These election reform proposals
would result in a better election
experience for both candidates and
students. With more emphasis on
creative ways to get one's word
across, and less emphasis on boring
ways to waste trees, ASSU elections
could actually become something to
look forward to rather than some
thing to dread.
