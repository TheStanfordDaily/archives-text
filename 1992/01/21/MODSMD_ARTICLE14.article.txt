Women, beware of dangers

Before women assertively demand
estrogen therapy from their physicians,
I think they should be better informed
about the "prevailing wisdom" sur
rounding a medical controversy that
concerns this preventative measure for
coronary heart disease. It was described
in the Jan. 15 article, "Estrogen therapy
can cut women's heart disease risk."
There will be 175,000 new cases of
breast cancer this year, and 44,500
women will die each year of breast can
cer. That translates to one in nine
American women, only a portion of
which have any genetic history of the
cancer. These statistics are approaching
epidemic proportion, and the risk of any
causal factors cannot be deferred by any
probable "prevailing wisdom."
Dr. Clinkingbeard's personal bent
seems to be that "estrogen therapy prob
ably does not increase the risk of breast
cancer." Following her theory, we
believe her professional judgment,
although there are no conclusive studies
and even medically supported counter
evidence. One such example is the high
ly prominent use of tamoxifen, an anti

estrogen drug, that has successfully mit
igated breast cancer tumor growth in
many women.
I do not dispute a "recognition of the
value" of this treatment for cardiovascular
protection of women whose heart disease
risk factors outweigh the "fear of side
effects." But the article emphasizes estro
gen therapy as a must — a predetermined
and yet inadequately administered treat
ment for all post-menopausal females.
I found the presented information
from Clinkingbeard misleading. She
emphatically proposes a generalization
that "women have got to demand estro
gen therapy," then later reminds us that
"risk needs to be individualized." Sadly
this last note should have been more of
a main point.
Risk factors, although in some cases
overwhelmingly generic, must serve to
show correct information so that all
women, and men, can have appropriate
patient information if "considering the
odds . . . [that anyl therapy outweigh the
risk."
