# Ban degrading nicknames

### 
Tell me it ain't so. Tell me that in
1992 the pejorative "redskin" does not
still name the nation's best pro football
team. There has been too much red
blood spilled on the land given us by
Native Americans to continue the quaint
cruelties of our grandfathers.
I am reminded that the current gov
ernment in Jackson (how appropriate!)
County, Oregon, calls an airport high
way Dead Indian Road. Tradition isn't a
very good reason to continue these pub
lic disparagements.
As a direct descendent of Thomas Jef
ferson, the man (unwittingly) most
responsible for sealing the fate of Native

Americans in the United States, I per
sonally take responsibility for the geno
cide and enslavement he begat.
Further, I personally take responsi
bility for changing the name of Washing
ton's football team!
If you care to help me do this, send a
postcard to me with your name, address,
statement of agreement and signature.
We'll let Jack Kent Cooke and Congress
know what you said. Paul Tagliabue, you
consummate politician, pay attention!
Thank you for giving this some
thought.
