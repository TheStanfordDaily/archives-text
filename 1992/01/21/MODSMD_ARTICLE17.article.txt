## Philosophy from a cab 
### 
WE SAT OUTSIDE THE CLASSIC
Cue pool hall in Tahoe trying to
figure out how to get back from
the casinos. Evidently, the patron saint
of college gamblers was smiling on us
because a cab pulled up to drop off some
people in our parking lot.
As the cab pulled away, we yelled and 1
ran to catch the driver. He heard us and
stopped, and I noticed the large peace
symbol painted on the back of the cab.
I stopped at the driver's window to find
a middle-aged man with a heavy beard and
lots of hair. I leaned over and asked if he
could take us back from the casinos for $8.
"It's all we've got," I said.
"How much?" he asked.
"Eight bucks."
"That all you have?"
"Yeah."
"How about $12?"
"I said we only have eight."
"All right. Get in. But I'm losing
money on you guys."
Our cabbie quickly decided that if he
was going to give us such a good deal, he
was going to make it worthwhile. So he
pumped us for all of the blonde jokes that
we knew. We're from Stanford, we
explained, and we don't tell those kind of
jokes. But we told him a few others. And
he told some zingers himself.
We never did get his name, but we alter
nated between calling him Eric Clapton
and Jerry Garcia, since he looked just like

the first and sounded much like the second.
It turns out "Jerry" had held a num
ber of jobs before becoming a cab-driver.
He'd been in construction for a number
of years, had smoked pot professionally
for awhile, that kind of stuff.
Anyway, we were having a great time
until the subject of job security came up.
It wasn't the type of job security that we
worry about — to Jerry job security
meant whether he got shot or robbed on
a regular basis. He said that for the most
part his job was pretty safe, and that
there had only been one cabbie who had
disappeared recently. Jerry hypothesized
that the disappearing driver had been
mixed up in some cocaine deals.
"Bad stuff, you know. That's when it gets
scary. You get these cab drivers high on that
stuff, and you never know when they're
going to pull out a gun and shoot everyone in
the cab. That's when it gets bad."
We took a big gulp, not sure whether
he was speaking hypothetically or from
experience. We dropped the subject like a
lead rock.
Jerry soon began to lament having
picked us up for such a bargain price.
(Thanks to his short-cut our ride was
worth about $20 at this point.) We reas
sured him by reminding him that he was
having a good time.
"Surely," we said, "you don't have this
much fun on all your rides."
At this, Jerry began to wax philo

sophic on us.
"First of all, don't call me Shirley. And
actually, it's not too bad. With a few excep
tions, I like 'em all. You know, you can
learn something from everyone. It's not the
fares or the destinations that are important
to me. It's the journey that counts.
"Just like in life. The journey is what
it's all about. If you don't enjoy the jour
ney, it doesn't matter where you end up.
Once you stop enjoying the journey, it's
time to get a divorce."
I couldn't help thinking he was speaking
from personal experience on that last line,
but the rest certainly seemed to make some
sense. I thought that people like us really
could learn something from a cabbie named
Jerry, just like he had said. It doesn't all
come from overpriced textbooks.
I realized there are probably thou
sands of people like Jerry out there who
are happier than many Stanford gradu
ates — because Jerry can be happy with
what he's got. Many of the rest of us
never can, so it's no surprise that no mat
ter what we have is never enough.
Congratulations to all of the Jerrys
out there.
