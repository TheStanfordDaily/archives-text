# Martin Luther King's legacy not honored by most Americans
## 
### 
IN SEPTEMBER 1968, I left Mas
sachusetts for Birmingham, Alaba
ma, to teach at Miles College, a black
college sponsored by the Christian
Methodißt Episcopal Church. I had sup
ported the goals and ideals of the Civil
Rights movement, and I decided to par
ticipate in the movement's next phase.
Birmingham at the time still had
much of the character of Johannesburg.
Freedom Riders had been beaten and
bloodied in the Birmingham bus station
as the local police looked on, amused. On
the streets Bull Connor had turned the
dogs and firehoses on peaceful
protestors, and from the city's jail Mar
tin Luther King had reached out to the
civilized world for timely assistance.
Those days seem like ancient history
now. King has become our newest
national hero, lionized in death as he
never was in life, while the ideals he
articulated so brilliantly, and martyred
himself to promote, have faded into

obscurity and disrepute.
Distance has robbed King's life and
work of any content, any substance. The
youth associate him honorifically with
George Washington: no school on King
Day. Older people vaguely remember he
had a dream. Teachers, politicians and
social workers hold his image up to poor
black and brown children as a model of
proper deportment and eloquence, and as
a case-study in the openness of society.
Tragically, then, King's most enduring
message has come to be something of this
vapidity: "Use proper English, get a prop
er haircut, don't shoot or stab anyone not
declared a proper enemy of the United
States, and you might get to move from
East Palo Alto to Palo Alto proper."
Honoring King always means cele
brating the early, entirely successful
part of his career. The Montgomery bus
boycott, the sit-ins and Freedom Rides,
the marching and singing for the right
to vote — these can now be lauded even

by conservatives like James Kilpatrick
and William Bennett.
But even in that period, King's calls
for nonviolence, social justice and broth
erhood were more than mere tactics.
King imagined and worked toward an
America without hate, without violence
and with a principled aversion to profiteer
ing from God's land, sea and living crea
tures. He was shaping a rational, purpose
ful democracy of social equals.
He foresaw, as the most significant
result of political action, the liberation of
personality from aimlessness, insecurity,
greed and envy — pathologies he traced
in large measure to life under competi
tive capitalism. He was gunned down, let
us recall, helping garbagemen and street
sweepers earn some dignity and a living
wage.
The battle against Jim Crow was won
by 1965; King won no more. His march
es opened no housing in Cicero; his
speeches against the Vietnam War lost

him many former allies; Black Power
advocates scorned his pacifism; cultural
nationalists derided his vision of an inte
grated, unified America; hip young
whites found him stodgy and moralistic.
Since none of his more encompassing
ideas won favor in his lifetime, and we
have swung far to the right since then, it
is fitting to ask how our newest national
hero would have fared if he had lived
among us these past 24 years. Two
answers come to my mind.
The more somber one pictures an
increasingly frustrated has-been, a reject
ed visionary making no dent at all on
events. Imagine King giving interviews
detailing his responses to Watergate, to
Reaganomics, to Desert Storm, to our
dwindling SAT scores and our dwindling
provisions to education, to Proposition
13, to Madonna and Rocky and Ice Cube,
to the S&L scandal and to our racism,
reverse and regular, as enduring as poi
son oak and the common cold. Imagine

our wearying of being told how heartless
and brainless we've become.
The more optimistic line of thought
would suggest that King's eloquence and
depth of character could have led the
United States to a healthier, less dolorous
recent history. One is tempted to say: "Of
course not, the time is well past any one
individual's ability to exert significant
impact on events." But folks were saying
that in Montgomery back in 1955, too,
when it seemed only natural that colored
people step to the back of the bus.
I am moved to conclude that we
should never underestimate what King,
endowed as he was with such great wis
dom and soul-force, could have accom
plished. We honor his blessed memory
best not with a hollow national heroism,
but by keeping alive the embers of the
fires of conscience he started in the
American people.

course not, the time is well past any one
individual's ability to exert significant
impact on events." But folks were saying
that in Montgomery back in 1955, too,
when it seemed only natural that colored
people step to the back of the bus.

should never underestimate what King,

fires of conscience he started in the
American people.

IN SEPTEMBER 1968, I left Mas
sachusetts for Birmingham, Alaba
ma, to teach at Miles College, a black
college sponsored by the Christian
Methodißt Episcopal Church. I had sup
ported the goals and ideals of the Civil
Rights movement, and I decided to par
ticipate in the movement's next phase.
Birmingham at the time still had
much of the character of Johannesburg.
Freedom Riders had been beaten and
bloodied in the Birmingham bus station
as the local police looked on, amused. On
the streets Bull Connor had turned the
dogs and firehoses on peaceful
protestors, and from the city's jail Mar
tin Luther King had reached out to the
civilized world for timely assistance.
Those days seem like ancient history
now. King has become our newest
national hero, lionized in death as he
never was in life, while the ideals he
articulated so brilliantly, and martyred
himself to promote, have faded into

obscurity and disrepute.
Distance has robbed King's life and
work of any content, any substance. The
youth associate him honorifically with
George Washington: no school on King
Day. Older people vaguely remember he
had a dream. Teachers, politicians and
social workers hold his image up to poor
black and brown children as a model of
proper deportment and eloquence, and as
a case-study in the openness of society.
Tragically, then, King's most enduring
message has come to be something of this
vapidity: "Use proper English, get a prop
er haircut, don't shoot or stab anyone not
declared a proper enemy of the United
States, and you might get to move from
East Palo Alto to Palo Alto proper."
Honoring King always means cele
brating the early, entirely successful
part of his career. The Montgomery bus
boycott, the sit-ins and Freedom Rides,
the marching and singing for the right
to vote — these can now be lauded even

by conservatives like James Kilpatrick
and William Bennett.
But even in that period, King's calls
for nonviolence, social justice and broth
erhood were more than mere tactics.
King imagined and worked toward an
America without hate, without violence
and with a principled aversion to profiteer
ing from God's land, sea and living crea
tures. He was shaping a rational, purpose
ful democracy of social equals.
He foresaw, as the most significant
result of political action, the liberation of
personality from aimlessness, insecurity,
greed and envy — pathologies he traced
in large measure to life under competi
tive capitalism. He was gunned down, let
us recall, helping garbagemen and street
sweepers earn some dignity and a living
wage.
The battle against Jim Crow was won
by 1965; King won no more. His march
es opened no housing in Cicero; his
speeches against the Vietnam War lost

him many former allies; Black Power
advocates scorned his pacifism; cultural
nationalists derided his vision of an inte
grated, unified America; hip young
whites found him stodgy and moralistic.
Since none of his more encompassing
ideas won favor in his lifetime, and we
have swung far to the right since then, it
is fitting to ask how our newest national
hero would have fared if he had lived
among us these past 24 years. Two
answers come to my mind.
The more somber one pictures an
increasingly frustrated has-been, a reject
ed visionary making no dent at all on
events. Imagine King giving interviews
detailing his responses to Watergate, to
Reaganomics, to Desert Storm, to our
dwindling SAT scores and our dwindling
provisions to education, to Proposition
13, to Madonna and Rocky and Ice Cube,
to the S&L scandal and to our racism,
reverse and regular, as enduring as poi
son oak and the common cold. Imagine

our wearying of being told how heartless
and brainless we've become.
The more optimistic line of thought
would suggest that King's eloquence and
depth of character could have led the
United States to a healthier, less dolorous
recent history. One is tempted to say: "Of
course not, the time is well past any one
individual's ability to exert significant
impact on events." But folks were saying
that in Montgomery back in 1955, too,
when it seemed only natural that colored
people step to the back of the bus.

should never underestimate what King,

dom and soul-force, could have accom
plished. We honor his blessed memory
