# University hedges on housing pledge
## Housing only guaranteed if 'overcrowding' maintained 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Four years of guaranteed hous
ing may be on the horizon for
incoming freshmen, but the Univer
sity isn't offering any promises yet.
If the two new undergraduate
residences — currently under
construction — open next fall as
planned, there will be enough
spaces to provide incoming fresh
man with four years of housing,
according to University officials
studying undergraduate housing.
However, the University may
decrease the number of residents
in overcrowded houses, reducing
the total number of available
spaces and delaying the institu
tion of a housing guarantee.
The current overcrowding in
campus residences resulted in
part from damages sustained by
the San Juan Hill houses during
the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
William Georges, acting director
of the Stanford Housing Center,
said students displaced from the
old Synergy and Delta Tau Delta
fraternity houses were moved in
with other students, creating
some overcrowded living areas.
For example, some displaced
students were moved into trailers
in Manzanita trailer park, raising
the number of students in each
trailer from three to four.
"When the hill houses were
closed after the earthquake, we
lost about 125 spaces," Georges
said. "Technically we need to
have those hill houses replaced."
Housing can be guaranteed for
next year's freshmen "if we keep
Manzanita upgraded the way it is
now," he said.

Sally Mahoney, acting vice
president for student resources,
said a decision on student hous
ing in the Manzanita trailers
would probably be made "in the
next several weeks."
"We're going to have to come
to grips with the number of occu
pants in those trailers," she said.
Mahoney said the University is
working on providing students
with four years of guaranteed
housing, but they "can't make the
guarantee we'd like" until a deci
sion is made on "how much crowd
ing to have in the short term" due
to the hill house space losses.
Georges said about 6,000 spaces
are needed before students can be
guaranteed four full years of hous
ing, compared to the approximate
ly 5,800 spaces available now.
The completion of two new
undergraduate residences — tem
porarily named Manzanita II —
will add 102 spaces each, accord
ing to Robin Hensley, a project
coordinator for the Office of Resi
dential Education.
The combined 204 spaces will
put Stanford at the 6,000 mark —
unless the number of residents in
locations such as Manzanita is
reduced.
Georges said plans are being
made to build new residences —
to replace the hill houses — "fair
ly soon, but not in the next year
or two."
According to Hensley, the most
likely site for the replacement
housing will be the Knoll, the area
behind Florence Moore Hall.
Hensley said she hopes a plan to
build the new house will be ready
for presentation to the Board of
Trustees bv June.
