## Card nips Bruins in scoring frenzy Whiting strikes for 35, Hedgpeth keys game-winning spurt 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
For the second consecutive game, Val
Whiting scored a career-high 35 points,
running her total over the past four
games to 127 points. She also grabbed a
team-high 11 rebounds in leading Stan
ford's women's basketball team to a 95-
92 decision over UCLA.

But she was not pleased.
"I did not play well defensively," she
said. "When the person I'm guarding
gets 10 offensive rebounds, I take it per
sonally/'
Coach Tara VanDerveer echoed
Whiting's frustration. "I was disap
pointed with our defense, especially in
the first half. We just let people drive
by."
But she was not surprised by the fact
that her squad did not manage the blow
out which Cardinal fans have grown
accustomed to. "With |UCLA's) talent
they're never out of it. I'm happy we
took 'em."
VanDerveer acknowledged that close
games will probably be the norm in
Pacific 10 Conference play this year.
"It seems like a lot of the Pac-10
teams this year are junior-senior-orient
ed teams," she said. "We are not a
junior-senior-oriented team. Our
junior-senior-oriented teams dominated
the Pac-10. Our non-junior-senior-ori
ented teams did not dominate the Pac
-10.
"If nothing else, Cal taught us to
appreciate winning," she added.
It was a pair of Bruin seniors and one
sophomore who were responsible for

'I did not play well defensively. When
the person I'm guarding gets 10 offen
sive rebounds, I take it personally.'

pushing the Cardinal to the limit Satur
day night. Senior Lynn Kamrath scored
UCLA's first four points to help them to
an early 6-0 lead, and hit the last basket
of the first half to give the Bruins a 49-
47 lead.
Kamrath was just about the only
other Bruin to score besides senior Rehe
ma Stephens and sophomore Natalie
Williams. But with the two big guns
racking up 39 and 28 points, respective
ly, UCLA didn't really need scoring
depth. And with Williams snagging 10
offensive boards, the Bruins often didn't
need to make their first shots.
Nevertheless, Stanford's defense
tightened enough in the second half to
put the Cardinal up 74-61 with 11:22
left. Then UCLA began its comeback
bid. By the time the clock read 2:37 the
game was tied at 86-86.
During that time span Stanford
found itself playing not only the Bruins,
but also the referees. Stanford turned
the ball over on 12 whistle blows during
the last 10 minutes of the game, and the
Cardinal couldn't find its rhythm.
But with the score tied, VanDerveer
sent in Christy Hedgpeth, who had not
started and had played only a few min
utes. Hedgpeth revitalized the Cardinal,
immediately burying a three
pointer.The rest of the team seemed to
pick up its defensive intensity after
wards. She scored six of Stanford's last
nine points to secure the victory.
"I just came in and tried to concen-

trate on helping the team," Hedgpeth
said. "I'm confident in my shooting abil
ities."
Meanwhile, the Bruins were both
upbeat and disappointed.
"We knew we could play with Stan
ford," Williams said. "We couldn't
believe it when we got down by 13
points."
"I want (to beat) Stanford so bad
before I graduate," Stephens said,
pounding the press conference table.
"We'll get 'em when they come to
Pauley," Williams said.
