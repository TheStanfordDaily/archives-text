streak.

Men's swimming

Cardinal 139

Wolverines 104

"This weekend was bigger than big for
Stanford swimming," said head coach Skip
Kenney, "coaching has it's ups and downs . . .
this is the highest of highs."
Stanford dominated the Michigan squad,
winning 139-104 in an amazing Stanford vic
tory that included 11 new pool records and 30
lifetime best unshaven swims.
"There were so many highlights . . . never
even in the 1980s, when we had such great
teams, have we had so many people swim so
well," Kenney said.
The Cardinal competed on Friday in an
unofficial meet against Michigan, and then
on Saturday in a scoring meet.
Co-captain Jeff Rouse led the Cardinal
with a win in the 200-meter backstroke. Com
peting in the 400 medley relay, Rouse swam a
backstroke leg that ranks him third in the
world in that event, even though he was com

peting unshaved.
"I've never seen a swim like that, that
would be so high in the rankings . . . and
swimming unshaved," Kenney paid.
Stanford swept the first three spots in the
200 Individual Medley, with Derek Weather
ford coming in first, leading Trip Zedlitz in
second and Josh Mikesell in third. Weather
ford swam four personal bests in the two days
of competition, the most of all the Stanford
swimmers.
Freshman Ray Carey led the field in the
'200 butterfly, winning in 2 minutes 4.43 sec
onds, with Brad Budney coming in fourth.
Erik Maurer scored the upset of the day
when he beat Gustavo Borges, a member of
Brazil's Olympic team, in the 50 free with a
lifetime best of 23.47.
Even though Stanford's strength lies in
the stroke events, the Card needed to win the
freestyle events — Michigan's forte — to take
the meet.
Freshman Chris Baskett won the 800 free,
followed by Alex Kostich in second.
When not winning the freestyle events, the
Stanford swimmers swept the middle places,
to keep the Cardinal ahead in the point total.
Eddie Parenti took second in the 200
freestyle, with Clay Tippins in third and Dan
Kanner in fourth.
Coming in second for Stanford in the 100
freestyle was Kevin Henderson, followed by
Brian Jacobson in third and Tippins in
fourth.
In another sweep of the middle spots, Bas
kett took second in the 400 free, with Parenti

'We'd like to think of this
meet as our biggest hurdle. 1

in third. Dan Kanner and Alex Kostich tied
for fourth.
"We'd like to think of this meet as our
biggest hurdle. Everybody likes to beat Stan
ford . . . but the guys realized that Michigan
stood between us and an undefeated season,"
Kenney said.
Leading the Cardinal in the 200 breast
stroke was Tyler Mayfield in second, followed
by Kurt Grote in third and J.J. Freitag in
fourth.
Stanford, the perennial favorite in the
relays, came in first and second place in the
400 medley relay and won the 400 free relay
as well.
A team of Rouse, Mayfield, Budney, and
Brian Reterrer won the medley relay, with
Mikesell, Freitag, Carey, and Bill Schell com
ing in second.
Maurer, John deGroot, Schell and Retter
er took the honors in the 400 free relay.
Stanford would have crushed the Wolver
ines had it not been for the 32 points Michi
gan scored in the diving events.
"I look at these times, and their standings
in the world (rankings) ... by the end of this
season, if we shave we're going to beat a lot of
countries," Kenney said.
