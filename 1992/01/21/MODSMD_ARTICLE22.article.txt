# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Sometimes a few select athletes stand
head and shoulders above the rest.
As dominant performers on nationally
ranked teams Val Whiting and Jeff Rouse
earn this week's Athletes of the Week
honors.
Whiting has spent the most part of the
last four games elevated above her defend
ers. In that span she has scored 127 points.
The former freshman super sub is now a

dominating scoring machine.
The junior center hit on all cylinders the
last two games, racking up 35 points each
time.
In the 87-72 victory over USC, Whiting
went on a torrid scoring streak, nailing 23
points in the last 20 minutes.
She also had a game-high nine rebounds
and held Trojan star Lisa Leslie to six sec
ond-half points.
In Saturday's 95-92 nailbiter with the
UCLA Bruins, Whiting was a force inside.
She tied her career-high in scoring and
came down with a team-high 11 boards.
With the two Pacific 10 Conference vic
tories, Stanford is 2-1 in the conference. In
mid-February the Cardinal will travel to
southern California to take on the Trojans
and the Bruins again.

Saturday Jeff Rouse set a milestone
while helping the Cardinal break one. Stan
ford beat Michigan 139-104 in Ann Arbor,
handing the Wolverines their first loss at
home in 10 years.
Rouse, world-record holder in the 100-
meter backstroke, swam a time that would
rank him third on the all-time best list.
The senior co-captain from Fredricks
burg, Va., accomplished the feat during the
400 medley relay.
His time of 55.38 seconds was astound
ing because Rouse was competing
unshaved.
"I've never seen a swim like that, that

would be so high in the rankings . . . and
swimming unshaved," said Cardinal coach
Skip Kenney. "I look at these times, and
their standings in the world (rankings) .. .
by the end of this season, if we shave we're
going to beat a lot of countries."
Rouse also won the 100 and 200 back
stroke. The win keeps the Cardinal's
unbeaten season intact. Next for Stanford
is a southern California road trip.
