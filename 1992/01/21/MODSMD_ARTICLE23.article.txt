They may not have gone ski
ing, but members of the men's
volleyball team did bring a tem
porary case of cold feet to Mal
ibu this weekend. The squad
dropped two games to San Diego
State, before warming up and
defeating the Aztecs in five
games, 9-15, 11-15, 15-4, 15-11,
15-9. The Saturday match was
Stanford's first of three in a
non-league tournament hosted
by Pepperdine.
"We got off to a slow start.
Then we made a couple of
instrumental changes that real
ly helped us," said coach Ruben
Nieves. Those changes had a lot
to do with Seniors Bob Hillman
and John Hribar, who came off
the bench to turn on the heat
for the third-ranked Cardinal.
Another key role was played by
Dave Goss, who dominated the
net with an intimidating 30 kills.
"Dave was our best hitter
during the weekend, no doubt
about it. He's developing into
the type of hitter that we can go
to in any situation and feel real
ly good about the volley ending
there," Nieves said. Junior Dun
can Blackman also heated up the
court, chipping in with 13 kills.
Later that afternoon, Stan
ford picked up where they left off
in a scorching victory over Loy
ola Marvmount. Greedy defense

allowed the squad to shut out the
Lions, 15-4,15-5, 15-12.
"One of the things that set
the stage was Brian Garret's
blocking. He helped us shut
down their quick attack early,"
Nieves said. The freshman also
compiled 12 kills and a .563 hit
ting percentage. Senior Bob
Hillman led the attack, hitting
.520 on 16 kills.
Despite 22 kills from a fired
up Goss, his team couldn't
overcome Pepperdine in their
third match. The No. 5 Waves
burned Stanford in four games,
15-8, 8-15, 15-6, 15-10. "Most
of the story in that match was
the serving and passing. Both
teams scored a lot of points off
jump serving," Nieves said. And
the rest of the story was Pep
perdine's Alon Grinberg, a
member of the Israeli National
Team. In addition to four ser
vice aces, Grinberg evaded the
Cardinal defense at the net, tal
lying 22 kills.
But Stanford didn't ice up.
"We were definitely into the
match until the end," Nieves
remarked. Behind the serving
of Duncan Blackman, Stanford
rallied from an 11-5 deficit,
bringing the score to 11-10,
before making a fatal net error.
Several key digs by the Waves
finished Stanford off.
