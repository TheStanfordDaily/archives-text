# Baseball edges alumni

### Mike Langford Staff writer 
This past weekend's alumni
game was a real treat in two sens
es. Not only was it a great chance
to see some former Cardinal who
have made it in the professional
leagues, but it also served as an
opportunity to catch a sneak pre
view of the 1992 Stanford squad.
The current Cardinal beat the
alumni, 7-1.
The starting pitcher for the
alumni was Jeff Ballard (Class of
*85) — now with the St. Louis
Cardinals — who threw two
innings of no-hit baseball. Other
starters in the field included Troy
Paulsen ('9O) at second, Mike
Aldrete CB3) and Ryan Turner
C9l) in the outfieid, and Ed
Sprague C 88) behind the plate.
The '92 Stanford squad fea
tured an equally impressive line
up. Although perhaps lacking in
power, the Cardinal of today
showed outstanding team speed
and defense, and if Saturday's
game was any indication, should
have great pitching. Junior Greg

Mix was the starter, and after
Mike Dotterer CB2) hit a double
and stole third, Mix gave up an
RBI single.
But that was to be the only run
of the game for the alumni.
Junior Chris Holcombe came on
in the fifth, and pitched very well
for four innings. To conclude the
game, sophomore Andrew Lor
raine pitched a charity four-out
ninth.
Other appearances for the
alumni included Astro reliever A 1
Osuna CB7), Padre Brian John
son 088), Oriole Doug Robbins
088), John Verducci 085), Troy
Tallman C9l), Steve Dunning
C7l), Pepe Hinojosa 078), Rick
Lundblade CB5), John Radtke
CB4), Eric Hardgrave (*B3) and
Paul Zuvella 080), among others.
Former Cardinal and current Ori
ole ace Mike Mussina ( 4 90) came
in to pitch the fourth and prompt
ly gave up two runs to take the
loss.
Although there may be some
questions about the Stanford bats
this year, the Cardinal hit very
respectably against some experi
enced pitchers. In their debuts,
sophomore shortstop Matt Boke
meier and sophomore second
baseman Jeff DesJardins each
exhibited solid pieces of hitting. In

a surprise show of power, and in a
bid to earn a starting spot at des
ignated hitter or first, sophomore
Nate Olmstead hit a solo home
run in the ninth.
Other impressive performances
in the field and at the plate includ
ed junior center fielder Jeffrey
Hammonds, senior right fielder
Steve Solomon, senior first base
man David Holbrook, and senior
second baseman Chris Kemper.
