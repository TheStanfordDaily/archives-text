### Quinn Moo Staff writer 
Cal quarterback Mike Paw
lawski savored his first victory at
Stanford Stadium and the last
game of his collegiate career
after keying the West to a 14-6
win over the East in Sunday's
Shrine Game.
Pawlawski, who suffered two
defeats here with the Bears in
1991 and 1989, picked up the
"W" and the offensive player of
the game trophy with crisp pass
es and a little improvisation. He
spearheaded the West's opening
77-yard drive and sprinted into
the endzone on a one-yard keep
er after rolling out and finding a
path to the corner.
"We got it going right away. I
was just playing my normal
game . . . trying to play football
out there," Pawlawski said.
Texas A & M quarterback
Bucky Richardson took over in
the second quarter for the West,
and tossed a 24-yard touchdown
to Kansas State wide receiver
Michael Smith to give the West a
14-0 lead.
From there both defenses
took over. The West team didn't
score in the second half and the
East's drives didn't produce a
touchdown.
The West secondary stung the
East for two key interceptions
inside the West 20, and forced
the East to settle for two Klaus
Wilmsmeyer field goals.
"The game was well-execut
ed," said Michigan linebacker
Erick Anderson, "but our offense
just sputtered a few times."
Washington cornerback Dana
Hall, who tallied seven tackles
and intercepted Chris Hakel's
pass in the end zone, led the
defensive effort. He received the
Spaulding award for defensive
player of the game.
"Now I know why Don James'
team is so good," said associate
West coach Jim Sweeney, refer
ring to the first team All-Pacific
10 Conference player.
In the third quarter Nebraska
cornerback Tyrone Legette
intercepted a Matt Blundin pass
at the West 16 to seal the win
and give the West a 35-27-5 edge.

"It was a spread-out play. I
was reading the quarterback and
settled into the zone, ready to
pop out," Legette said.
After the last seconds of the
clock ticked away, players from
both teams gathered on the field
among throngs of autograph
seekers and fans.
Cal offensive tackle Troy
Auzenne saw the Shrine Game
as a friendly game of football

with friends.
"You're playing against peo
ple you know. Everyone was hav
ing fun, too. It felt like Pop
Warner again," Auzenne said.
After practicing for a week
before NFL scouts, Anderson
said the game gave players a
chance to "get back out in front
of a crowd." A record 83,000 peo
ple filled the stands, while ESPN
televised the contest nationally.

Unfortunately for Stanford,
fullback "Touchdown Tommy"
Vardell couldn't get into the
game healthy, as he suffered a
broken collarbone in the Aloha
Bowl Dec. 25. He was named the
West's honorary captain, howev
er, while the Cardinal's other
representative — wide receiver
Chris Walsh — caught two pass
es for 22 yards and the attention
of several NFL scouts.
