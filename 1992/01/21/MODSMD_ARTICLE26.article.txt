# Grapplers edge Aggies
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
It seems that with the injuries
and holes in the Stanford
wrestling team's line-up, the UC-
Davis Aggies turned out to be
quite a handful for the Cardinal.
With two matches to go in the
meet, Stanford was in a position
where the squad had to win both
in order to win the meet.
The Aggies brought a tough,
scrappy squad to Burnham Pavil
ion Saturday night, and took
advantage of the mismatched
weights of the Stanford grapplers.
But luckily for the Cardinal, the
performance of the lightweights
and the execution of the experi
enced wrestlers was enough for
the win.
Phil Nowick, at 118 pounds,
seemed fully recovered from his
shoulder injury. His Aggie oppo
nent, Curtis Yagi, never seemed
able to get started, and Nowick
piled up a lot of advantage time.
Although Nowick dominated
more than his minor decision
attested, the three points put
Stanford up 3-0.
At 126 pounds sophomore
Ramy Saad had an impressive
showing in his first official match
of the year, especially considering
he was wrestling heavy from his
normal 118 pounds He scored a
minor decision over his Aggie
counterpart, tall and lanky Juan
Reyna, bringing the score to 6-0.
Junior Dave Nowick, also
wrestling heavy at 143 pounds
from his normal 126 pounds,
went up against Sam Jensen, who
gave the smaller Nowick a tough
match — but not tough enough.
Jensen never led in the match,
and gave up a minor decision to
give the Cardinal a 9-0 lead.
Sophomore Jay Jackson had a
tough match, but that was to be
expected considering the circum
stances. Not only was Jackson
wrestling heavy — 142 pounds
from his normal 134 pounds —
but his opponent was Tim Cano,
probably the best wrestler on the
Aggie team. With some question
ably possible stallings by Cano to
rest his injured knee, and despite
a tough match by Jackson, Cano
prevailed with a minor decision to
shrink the gap to 9-3.
Junior Dave Sacks looked ter

rific without the red shirt on. In
his first official match back, Sacks
was able to dominate his oppo
nent, Dwight Weevie. Sacks was
all over Weevie for the entire
match, and got an easy minor
decision to increase Stanford's
lead to 12-3.
At 158 pounds, junior Bob
Becker wrestled despite an
injured shoulder, and had an 0-2
record against his Aggie counter
part, Tom Branca. That record
fell to 0-3 as Branca was able to
soundly beat Becker and his ailing
shoulder with a technical fall. The
lead dropped to 12-8.
Cardinal Greg Green faced a
tough match against Clint Birch
at 167 pounds. Birch was able to
prevail, but just barely. Green
looked good, especially in his first
match back since coming off a
knee injury. However, the minor
decision decreased the lead fur
ther to 12-11.
This turn of events put the
Cardinal in a dangerous position.
Since Stanford was going to forfeit
the heavyweight class, the score
was effectively 17-12 in favor of
the Aggies. Stanford would have
to take the last two weight classes
in order to win the meet.
"I suppose I should have been
nervous, but I wasn't," said coach
Chris Horpel. It was probably
comforting for Horpel to know
that he had his best two wrestlers
up next.
Matt Topham was also
wrestling heavy by a weight or
two, depending on whether he is
considered a 158-or 167-pounder.
Either way, he did exceptionally
well at 177 pounds, garnering a
rare win for the Cardinal at this
weight class by soundly defeating
Aggie Joe Strusinski, adding his
minor decision to bring the Cardi
nal closer to victory, down by only
two at 17-15.
Then at 190 pounds, senior
Mark Graham pounded the final
nail into the Aggie's coffin Davis'
Pat Guire proved to be no match
to Graham, only scoring one point
the entire match, and lost a major
decision, making the final score
19-17, in favor of the Cardinal.
Horpel could not have known
that the match was going to be
this close, but the unexpected can
happen when holes in the line up
have to be filled.
