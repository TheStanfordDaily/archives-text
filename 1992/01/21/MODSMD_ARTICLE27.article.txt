Revenge — oh, how sweet it is.
The Stanford women's gymnastics team took
that old cliche to new heights when the Cardinal met
Cal State-Fullerton for the second time this season,
and, on this occasion, left with the win.
With an incredible performance that marked the
first home meet of the year, the Cardinal scored
188.45 points — enough to put them ahead of the
Titans (137.85).
"It was a good win," said coach Breck Greenwood.
"We thought that we could have won the week
before. We knew that we were a better team, and it
was good to see that we are the team that we
thought we were."
Not only was the Stanford point total enough to
capture the win, but it also marked the second high
est point total ever earned by the women's team.
"We were very happy with the score," Greenwood
said. "It says that we are a nationally competitive
team, and can score as high as some of those in the
top 10 or 12." This win was extra special for Green
wood, who had coached at Fullerton for 10 years,
starting in 1977.
The highlight of Friday's meet for the Cardinal
was the floor performance.
Sophomore Kerri Kanuka led the way with a 9.80,
which ties the record high score that she tied last
year, as well. Nuke was followed with equally
impressive routines by freshmen Jene Elzie and
Tina Snowden, who earned 9.75 and 9.65, respec
tively. This explosive trio ended up finishing in the
top three positions in the individual competition.
The team's nearly flawless floor performance was
also enough to set an individual event record of

48.15 points. Stanford scored only 45.4 points on the
floor last week against the Titans, a difference of
almost three points.
The Stanford women were also dominant in the
vault competition. They were led by freshman Katie
Clancy, who earned a 9.70 and second place in the
individual competition. Just one week earlier
against Fullerton, Clancy scored only 9.1 points.
Elzie also did well, sliding into the number three
position with a 9.65.
On the beam, Elzie led the way for Stanford with a
solid performance, that earned her a 9.65 and the first
place position, and sophomore Kerrie Kelley tied for
third place with two other competitors, with a 9.55.
In the all-around competition, Elzie rounded out
the top three positions with 38.00 points.
The fact that the win fell at the first home meet
of the year was a special bonus for the team.
Although there were few people in Burnham at the
start of the competition, the crowd slowly, but sure
ly, filed in to offer its support.
"The crowd was very supportive. There were a lot
of freshman dorms out," Greenwood said. "(Being at
home] is much more fun than being on the road."
Despite the outstanding performance of the team,
the Card realizes that the season has just begun, and
there is still work to be done — like adding difficulty
to some of the routines. And Greenwood hopes to see
the injuries that have been plaguing some of the
gymnasts, including freshman Meegan Lannin and
Kelley, heal properly.
The win proved to all doubters that, despite the
youth of the team, the Cardinal is still a force to be
reckoned with. "Our youth is actually our strength,"
Greenwood said. "They are very energetic. Although
we may have our ups and downs, when we are high,
we are sky high."
