# Carrying the world on her shoulders
## Feminist leader teaches course on stereotypes

Peace, love, and harmony —
while most people think back
to the 1960s upon hearing
these words, Sonia Johnson
optimistically looks ahead to a
time when women will have
changed the world.

foremost feminist leaders and
a one-time presidential candi

Sonia Johnson, one of the nation's foremost feminist leaders, stands by a pile of her books. She is
presently writing her fifth. Johnson is a visiting lecturer for the special month-long SWOPSI class,
"Going Out of Our Minds: From Women's Movement to Women's World."
"the way the world is."
A tiny, energetic woman, John
son gratefully attributes the begin
ning of her successful feminist
career to the Mormon Church,
which in 1979 excommunicated
her for "being uppity" in her sup
port of the Equal Rights Amend
ment.
She then left her job as an
English teacher to lecture at vari
ous colleges and universities and
write books on women's issues.
She said she reached the turn
ing point in her life one June after
noon in 1982, when the Illinois leg
islature voted against the ERA
despite its overwhelming public
support.
Johnson and seven fellow sup
porters had been fasting for the
previous 37 days in support of the
amendment under a banner that
read, "Women Hunger for Jus
tice."
After the defeat of the ERA in
Illinois, Johnson said she decided
that women must not merely
reform the existing society, but
actually create a new one, resolv
ing that women were "essentially
different" from men.
She never voted in another elec
tion, even in 1984 when she ran
for president of the United States
under the Citizen's Party.

The state in which she was reg
istered to vote, Virginia, did not
put her on the ballot. Johnson
came in fifth in the nationwide
electoral vote. "You run to be
heard, not to win," she said.
Johnson said that even the
women's movement is focused on
how to change the men's world. So
she decided that "it's a catastro
phe. Let's do it the way women
would do it."
Since August. 1991, Johnson
and four other women have been
enthusiastically exploring this
"way" at a colony in New Mexico
they endearingly named Wildfire.
"Wild," she explained, "because we
want not to be domesticated ani
mals, and fire — because of the
passion, the love."
She added, "What we're experi
menting with here is anarchy —to
do what you want to do and never
do anything else. It turns out that
everything gets done."
Senior Jennifer Corbin, who is
taking Johnson's class, said, "She
seems to be talking a lot of truths
that I haven't heard before. I think
what she's saying makes some
really good sense."
Sally Haskovec, a freshman,
offered a bit of understatement:
"She's pretty wild."
Johnson has never cooked since
she has been to the colony. "I hate
cooking," she said, recalling the
days when she was still married,
and society "expected" her to cook
for her husband and four children.

"What we're experiment
ing with here is anarchy
—to do what you want
to do and never do any
thing else.'

Johnson said she also chooses
not to shave or wear makeup any
more.
Despite the tremendous joy she
experiences living at the colony,
Johnson recognizes that many
women feel differently, and
emphasizes that this is fine — as
long as they are doing only what
they want to do.
The experiences as the colony
have led Johnson to the believe
that women are the key to the
future. She calls racism, sexism
and destruction products of "the
men's world (which! is falling
apart as we speak."
When women come together to
create a new world, based on peace,
love, and wholeness, Johnson con
fidently predicts, "There is going to
be — for the first time in 5,000
years — real love on thus planet."
At Stanford, Johnson said she
would like to share with women
the way of thinking she has discov
ered through her many feminist
experiences.
After leaving Stanford at the
end of January, Johnson plans to
return to New Mexico to work on
her fifth book.

and four other women have been
enthusiastically exploring this
"way" at a colony in New Mexico
they endearingly named Wildfire.
"Wild," she explained, "because we
want not to be domesticated ani
mals, and fire — because of the
passion, the love."
She added, "What we're experi
menting with here is anarchy —to
do what you want to do and never
do anything else. It turns out that
everything gets done."
Senior Jennifer Corbin, who is
taking Johnson's class, said, "She
seems to be talking a lot of truths
that I haven't heard before. I think
what she's saying makes some
really good sense."
Sally Haskovec, a freshman,
offered a bit of understatement:
"She's pretty wild."
Johnson has never cooked since
she has been to the colony. "I hate
cooking," she said, recalling the
days when she was still married,
and society "expected" her to cook
for her husband and four children.

"What we're experiment
ing with here is anarchy
—to do what you want
to do and never do any
thing else.'

Johnson said she also chooses
not to shave or wear makeup any
more.
Despite the tremendous joy she
experiences living at the colony,
Johnson recognizes that many
women feel differently, and
emphasizes that this is fine — as
long as they are doing only what
they want to do.
The experiences as the colony
have led Johnson to the believe
that women are the key to the
future. She calls racism, sexism
and destruction products of "the
men's world (which! is falling
apart as we speak."
When women come together to
create a new world, based on peace,
love, and wholeness, Johnson con
fidently predicts, "There is going to
be — for the first time in 5,000
years — real love on thus planet."
At Stanford, Johnson said she
would like to share with women
the way of thinking she has discov
ered through her many feminist
experiences.
After leaving Stanford at the
end of January, Johnson plans to
return to New Mexico to work on
her fifth book.
Peace, love, and harmony —
while most people think back
to the 1960s upon hearing
these words, Sonia Johnson
optimistically looks ahead to a
time when women will have
changed the world.
Johnson, one of the nation's
foremost feminist leaders and
a one-time presidential candi
date, is a visiting lecturer cur
rently teaching a SWOPSI
class titled "Going Out of Our
Minds: From Women's Move

three of whom are male — how
to "get out of' the habitual

Sonia Johnson, one of the nation's foremost feminist leaders, stands by a pile of her books. She is
presently writing her fifth. Johnson is a visiting lecturer for the special month-long SWOPSI class,
"Going Out of Our Minds: From Women's Movement to Women's World."
"the way the world is."
A tiny, energetic woman, John
son gratefully attributes the begin
ning of her successful feminist
career to the Mormon Church,
which in 1979 excommunicated
her for "being uppity" in her sup
port of the Equal Rights Amend
ment.
She then left her job as an
English teacher to lecture at vari
ous colleges and universities and
write books on women's issues.
She said she reached the turn
ing point in her life one June after
noon in 1982, when the Illinois leg
islature voted against the ERA
despite its overwhelming public
support.
Johnson and seven fellow sup
porters had been fasting for the
previous 37 days in support of the
amendment under a banner that
read, "Women Hunger for Jus
tice."
After the defeat of the ERA in
Illinois, Johnson said she decided
that women must not merely
reform the existing society, but
actually create a new one, resolv
ing that women were "essentially
different" from men.
She never voted in another elec
tion, even in 1984 when she ran
for president of the United States
under the Citizen's Party.

The state in which she was reg
istered to vote, Virginia, did not
put her on the ballot. Johnson
came in fifth in the nationwide
electoral vote. "You run to be
heard, not to win," she said.
Johnson said that even the
women's movement is focused on
how to change the men's world. So
she decided that "it's a catastro
phe. Let's do it the way women
would do it."
Since August. 1991, Johnson
and four other women have been
enthusiastically exploring this
"way" at a colony in New Mexico
they endearingly named Wildfire.
