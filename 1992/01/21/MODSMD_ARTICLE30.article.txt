# Departing Rosse seen as 'pillar of strength'
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
James Rosse was at the center
of many of Stanford's successes
— and controversies — during his
eight years as provost.
"The character of Stanford
today reflects Jim more than it
reflects any other person," said
Roger Noll, an associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences and pro
fessor of economics.
"Jim has been perhaps the sin
gle most important person in the
development of Stanford over the
last 10 years," he added.
While the president and
provost together set the tone for a
university, the provost is respon
sible solely for internal matters,
such as supervising the deans and
vice presidents. He plays a funda
mental role in insuring the good
will of faculty while frequently
serving as the bearer of bad news.
Provost Rosse presided over
the growth of Stanford's faculty
in both size and stature as the
University came to be recognized
as a leader, not only in the sci
ences, but in the social sciences
and some humanities programs.
In the last year, Rosse also led
the process by which the Univer
sity will cut $43 million from its
$400 million operating budget.
"He has been a pillar of
strength during a period of signif
icant change and tension," said
Budget Director Tim Warner.
Faculty have generally praised
the budget-cutting process for its
broad consultation and participa
tion by faculty and staff. But some
say it has wasted hundreds of
hours in committee meetings and
been too dependent on consensus.

Rosse's departure in April will
not derail the process he has set in
motion, said Peter Van Etten, the
University's chief financial officer.
"Most of the work has been
completed, or will be by the time
he leaves," he said. "What is left is
the implementation, which will
also be a major task, but I don't
see his leaving affecting the final
budget decisions."
Senior Solina Kwan, a member
of the Cabinet Committee on Bud
get and Strategic Planning, said,
"He has done extraordinarily well
in making difficult decisions. He
has shown great leadership."
Many people also credit Rosse
with improving relations between
Stanford and the Hoover Institu
tion.
In 1982 Rosse chaired a com
mittee that recommended that
Hoover change its fellow appoint
ment practices, to bring them
more in line with the University's
and make them less ideological.
He continued that work as
provost and also initiated regular
meetings with Hoover officials to
open lines of communication.
Hoover Director John Raisian
said, "He was invaluable in all
facets of warming the relationship
between Hoover and Stanford."
However, Rosse also took on
the institution when he chaired a
faculty committee that studied the
possibility of bringing a Reagan
Presidential Library to campus.
The Faculty Senate ultimately
rejected the Reagan library package.
Rosse, a winner of the Dean's
Award for Distinguished Teach
ing, was considered by many fac
ulty to be overwhelmingly the
best candidate for provost when
he was selected in 1984.
