# 'Hands-off' approach expected of Rosse
## 
### Julia Sobrevilla Staff writer 
When James Rosse takes over
at Freedom Newspapers, he is
expected by officials there to
continue the company's hands
off approach to its newspapers'
editorial policy while bringing in
his own philosophy of newspa
per economics.
Freedom Newspapers distin
guishes itself for not interfering
in the decisions of the indepen
dent newspapers it owns, said
Ken Cazalas, editor of the
Pulitzer Prize-winning Delta
Times Democrat, one of the
papers owned by Freedom.
"They hire good people to run
their property and then leave
them alone to work," Cazalas said.
"They don't interfere in the day
to-day operation. They are more
of a helping hand than headquar
ters we have to report to."

"I hope that Mr. Rosse will
run things pretty much in the
same way as Mr. Segal (the cur
rent chief executive officer),"
Cazalas added.
Freedom Newspapers is a
family-owned chain of newspa
pers that has a "libertarian polit
ical philosophy," according to D.
Robert Segal, outgoing CEO of
the corporation.
"We encourage everybody to
be as independent as possible,
though we do exert corporate
oversight," Segal said. "We are
quite decentralized in our
approach."
David Threshie, publisher of
the Orange County Register, the
flagship newspaper of the Free
dom chain, said he believes
Rosse's experience in economics
and in the media makes him an
ideal man for the job.
"I think that Jim Rosse is
going to bring new perspective

and discipline to our newspa
pers. He is a bright, well-studied
man and his general background
on general economic newspaper
policies will be of great help to
the company," Threshie said.
"I'm sure James Rosse wants
to make the newspapers more
valuable to the community and
to the owners." Segal said.
Before becoming provost,
Rosse was a professor of eco
nomics and chair of the Eco
nomics Department at Stanford.
He is widely considered an
expert in the economics of news
papers. Rosse has also worked at
several papers, both in editorial
and production capacities.
Rosse's views on newspaper
economics are well known, but
sometimes controversial. He has
advocated joint operating agree
ments, by which newspapers in a
city agree to share facilities such
as presses and in some cases,

newsrooms.
Some people believe these
arrangements create monopolies
and have led to the disappear
ance of competing dailies in
many cities.
One opponent of Rosse's
views is Bruce Brugman, editor
and publisher of the San Fran
cisco Bay Guardian.
"I really resented Stanford
Provost James Rosse speaking
from this privileged sanctuary
all these years in defense of the
monopoly press and against the
interests of the First Amend
ment and the free and indepen
dent press," Brugman wrote in
an unpublished letter to The
Daily yesterday.
Stephen Barnett, a law profes
sor at UC-Berkeley, said, "It's
not surprising he's taking this job
since he's devoted so much of his
academic career to paid work
defending chains of newspapers."
