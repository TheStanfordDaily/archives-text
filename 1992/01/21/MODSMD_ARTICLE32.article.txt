# Live-in partners still waiting for health care
## Selected insurance carrier still under standard state review 
### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
Domestic partners of Stanford students
will not have access to insurance through
Cowell Student Health Center this quarter,
because the insurance carrier selected by Cow
ell is under a standard review by the state.
Originally, Cowell had hoped to offer insur
ance to the live-in partners of Stanford students
beginning this quarter. But Consumer's Unit
ed, the chosen carrier, is still being reviewed by
the state commission on insurance, according to
Jane Meier, associate director of Cowell.
The state periodically review insurance car

riers to make sure they can cover claims.
"It's out of our hands," Meier said. "Con
sumer's United needs to get the blessing of the
state of California that they are good enough
and solid enough to insure."
Until the review is completed, the company
will not be permitted to offer any new plans.
Meier said she was unable to say when the
plan would be offered, but said the earliest
possible time would be spring quarter.
Health insurance for domestic partners
became an issue more than a year ago when
live-in partners, both same-sex and opposite
sex, were accorded housing rights at Stanford.
Such live-in partners, who had been in a

relationship for at least one year, were also
granted the use of Cowell on a fee-for-service
basis, and were allowed to use spouse cards,
which give them access to University facilities
such as libraries or gyms.
At the same time, Cowell began searching for
an insurance company that would offer a health
plan to domestic partners. Consumer's United
was chosen by a committee at Cowell last fall.
Initially, Meier had estimated that the plan
could be completed in time to begin offering
domestic partner health insurance this quar
ter. Despite the delay, she emphasized that it
was important for Consumer's United to com
plete the review process.
