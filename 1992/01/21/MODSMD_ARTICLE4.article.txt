# Budget-reduction plans up for scrutiny
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Stanford completed another step in ending
its $43 million shortfall Friday as schools and
administrative areas submitted their budget
cutting proposals.
As the consultative phase of the budget
cutting process ends, the Cabinet Committee
on Budget and Strategic Planning will now
begin evaluating the plans that were submit
ted. The committee will release summaries of
the plans' details next week.
The summaries will provide an overview of
the general budget-reduction plans but are
unlikely to answer the burning questions,

such as the fate of the music and drama
departments.
During the next three weeks, subgroups of
the cabinet committee will study the proposals
to examine certain cross-cutting themes —
undergraduate education, research capacity,
intellectual diversity and multiculturalism.
The subgroups will continue to work with
the deans and vice presidents, and the Univer
sity Cabinet will go on a retreat Feb. 18 and 19
to discuss the budget.
Many people said they believe the consulta
tive period was too short, in part because it
was interrupted by winter break.
"It has been really rushed, and there has
not been a lot of student input," said Elisabeth

Browne, the graduate student representative
on the School of Engineering task force. But
she added that she would work to include
more student input into her school's process
in coming weeks.
But Browne and others recognize that the
University had to set strict deadlines to pre
sent a completed budget to the Board of
Trustees in April.
In October — after preliminary discussions
during the summer and the first month of fall
quarter — the cabinet committee set reduction
targets for the schools and administrative areas
based upon the groups' original suggestions.
