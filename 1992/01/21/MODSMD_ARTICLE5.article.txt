# Hands-on help for the homeless
## Ongoing research project challenges misconceptions

When sophomore Angela Jones
began interviewing homeless peo
ple, she remembers, "I was scared
I couldn't relate. I had always
thought of the homeless as the
people you see on the streets in
San Francisco, and I was kind of
scared of them."
Her work is part of ongoing
research, led by Sociology Prof.
Sanford Dornbusch, in which
Stanford students interact direct
ly with homeless individuals. A
major element of the study,
released in November, gave the
first detailed investigation into
the lives of the area's homeless.
The early research has led to
specialized work by several stu
dents.
Jones said she appreciated
understanding the people she met.

"They're just people. Some I liked,
some I didn't. But I could always
talk to them and relate to them."
Working on the project also
gave Jones ideas about solving the
overall problem. She said she now
feels "disenchanted with the
whole system. AFDC (the govern
ment's package of Aid to Families
with Dependent Children) needs
to be redone."
In addition, she said she also
realized the complexity of the
issue. "The media presents it as
two-dimensional, saying home
lessness is caused by one or two
things. But no two cases are alike.
It's a very intricate issue, and a
lot more work needs to be done on
it," Jones said.
Jones said she joined the study
because she wanted to find out
firsthand about the problem of
homelessness instead of simply

reading about it."I had to go to
college to find out there was such
poverty where I lived," she added.
As she continues working on
the study, Jones is focusing on
how families can work to escape
homelessness. "I'll keep working
on it probably for the rest of the
year, and possibly into summer,
too," she said.
Wise beyond their years
Robert Almanzan has spent
much of his time with the project
interviewing homeless children
and discovering the traits that set
them apart from other kids.
"I was surprised at the maturi
ty level of the kids. They seemed a
lot more mature in their respons
es and in the way they carried
themselves," said Almanzan, a
