# Hands-on help for the homeless
## Ongoing research project challenges misconceptions 
### Anush Yegyazarian 
When sophomore Angela Jones
began interviewing homeless peo
ple, she remembers, "I was scared
I couldn't relate. I had always
thought of the homeless as the
people you see on the streets in
San Francisco, and I was kind of
scared of them."
Her work is part of ongoing
research, led by Sociology Prof.
Sanford Dornbusch, in which
Stanford students interact direct
ly with homeless individuals. A
major element of the study,
released in November, gave the
first detailed investigation into
the lives of the area's homeless.
The early research has led to
specialized work by several stu
dents.
Jones said she appreciated
understanding the people she met.

"They're just people. Some I liked,
some I didn't. But I could always
talk to them and relate to them."
Working on the project also
gave Jones ideas about solving the
overall problem. She said she now
feels "disenchanted with the
whole system. AFDC (the govern
ment's package of Aid to Families
with Dependent Children) needs
to be redone."
In addition, she said she also
realized the complexity of the
issue. "The media presents it as
two-dimensional, saying home
lessness is caused by one or two
things. But no two cases are alike.
It's a very intricate issue, and a
lot more work needs to be done on
it," Jones said.
Jones said she joined the study
because she wanted to find out
firsthand about the problem of
homelessness instead of simply

reading about it."I had to go to
college to find out there was such
poverty where I lived," she added.
As she continues working on
the study, Jones is focusing on
how families can work to escape
homelessness. "I'll keep working
on it probably for the rest of the
year, and possibly into summer,
too," she said.
Wise beyond their years
Robert Almanzan has spent
much of his time with the project
interviewing homeless children
and discovering the traits that set
them apart from other kids.
"I was surprised at the maturi
ty level of the kids. They seemed a
lot more mature in their respons
es and in the way they carried
themselves," said Almanzan, a

senior in human biology.
As an example, he cited the last
question on the children's ques
tionnaire, which asked children
what three wishes they would
like.
"Originally, it was more of a
feel-good question, to leave them
with something positive," Alman
zan said. "We thought they'd be
asking for Nintendo or a new
bike. Instead, they were asking
for mature, serious things, like
'help my parents save money to
get out of the shelter,' or 'I wish
my mom didn't have to be so
stressed.' These were 6- and 8-
year old kids making these seri
ous wishes. It was shocking."
But "Even in difficult situa
tions, they're very resilient," said
Almanzan. "They know they're
having difficulties, but they can
still laugh and play, and when
we'd have a little time before or
after the interviews, I'd play with
them, or juggle for them.

Though he too is concerned
about homelessness, Almanzan's
primary focus is children. Raised
in El Paso, Texas, and corning
from a Mexican-American back
ground, he said he's always been
interested in the Latino commu
nity.
"It's a community based on
helping each other," he said.
"There was no point where I
decided to help Latino children.
It's always been with me. I've
always had a direction."
Almanzan has counseled chil
dren who are emotionally dis
turbed, abused or learning-dis
abled. He has also worked at a
summer camp in New York that
brings inner-city kids to the coun
try.
He said one of the things he
found most frustrating in talking
to the homeless was hearing
about their struggles and realiz
ing how much help they need.
Even though some of them have
minimum wage jobs, they're still
homeless, he added.
"It's so amazing that public
perceptions can be so wrong," he
said.

He and others in the project
are preparing a report on Latino
homeless children.
The bigger picture
The students working on the
project have always been aware
that their project had larger
implications. Melissa Beacham,
the project manager, has fre
quently traveled to Washington,
D.C. and Sacramento to discuss
the study with policy makers. In
addition, organizations like the
Children's Defense Fund have
called to inquire about the study's
findings.
"There was positive pressure
for us to come out with the study.
People were concerned about
what we were finding out," said
senior Mary Jo Wien.
Wien is part of a group compil
ing a book that details the broad
er impact of homelessness on chil
dren.
Wien said she became involved
in the study partially because she
"thought it was a good way to
have a meeting of minds —
academia and public service."
"The study takes public service

to a different level because it can
have direct impact on policy
issues," Wien said. "I felt it was a
way to reach more people than if I
tried to help families out one by
one.
"I don't come from a big city,"
she said, "and having personal
contact with the homeless is a dif
ferent feeling, especially meeting
families. It makes it all more
poignant because that's the side
of it you don't see — no one wants
to display their kids on the
streets."
Wien said she has found mis
conceptions about the causes of
homelessness. The cause is "not
personal problems, it's the type of
wages people get and the high
rents," she said.
"At Stanford, we're very isolat
ed, and doing this study got me
out to see that not all the world is
like Stanford," she said. "I come
from a suburb outside of
Rochester, N.Y, and it was good to
see and understand what it's like
when you don't come from a back
ground that's blessed. . . . Now
I'd like to go and do something
about it."

wages people get and the high
rents," she said.
"At Stanford, we're very isolat
ed, and doing this study got me
out to see that not all the world is
like Stanford," she said. "I come
from a suburb outside of
Rochester, N.Y, and it was good to
see and understand what it's like
when you don't come from a back
ground that's blessed. . . . Now
I'd like to go and do something
about it."
When sophomore Angela Jones
began interviewing homeless peo
ple, she remembers, "I was scared
I couldn't relate. I had always
thought of the homeless as the
people you see on the streets in
San Francisco, and I was kind of
scared of them."
Her work is part of ongoing
research, led by Sociology Prof.
Sanford Dornbusch, in which
Stanford students interact direct
ly with homeless individuals. A
major element of the study,
released in November, gave the
first detailed investigation into
the lives of the area's homeless.
The early research has led to
specialized work by several stu
dents.
Jones said she appreciated
understanding the people she met.

"They're just people. Some I liked,
some I didn't. But I could always
talk to them and relate to them."
Working on the project also
gave Jones ideas about solving the
overall problem. She said she now
feels "disenchanted with the
whole system. AFDC (the govern
ment's package of Aid to Families
with Dependent Children) needs
to be redone."
In addition, she said she also
realized the complexity of the
issue. "The media presents it as
two-dimensional, saying home
lessness is caused by one or two
things. But no two cases are alike.
It's a very intricate issue, and a
lot more work needs to be done on
it," Jones said.
Jones said she joined the study
because she wanted to find out
firsthand about the problem of
homelessness instead of simply

reading about it."I had to go to
college to find out there was such
poverty where I lived," she added.
As she continues working on
the study, Jones is focusing on
how families can work to escape
homelessness. "I'll keep working
on it probably for the rest of the
year, and possibly into summer,
too," she said.
Wise beyond their years
Robert Almanzan has spent
much of his time with the project
interviewing homeless children
and discovering the traits that set
them apart from other kids.
"I was surprised at the maturi
ty level of the kids. They seemed a
lot more mature in their respons
es and in the way they carried
themselves," said Almanzan, a

senior in human biology.
As an example, he cited the last
question on the children's ques
tionnaire, which asked children
what three wishes they would
like.
"Originally, it was more of a
feel-good question, to leave them
with something positive," Alman
zan said. "We thought they'd be
asking for Nintendo or a new
bike. Instead, they were asking
for mature, serious things, like
'help my parents save money to
get out of the shelter,' or 'I wish
my mom didn't have to be so
stressed.' These were 6- and 8-
year old kids making these seri
ous wishes. It was shocking."
But "Even in difficult situa
tions, they're very resilient," said
Almanzan. "They know they're
having difficulties, but they can
still laugh and play, and when
we'd have a little time before or
after the interviews, I'd play with
them, or juggle for them.

Though he too is concerned
about homelessness, Almanzan's
primary focus is children. Raised
in El Paso, Texas, and corning
from a Mexican-American back
ground, he said he's always been
interested in the Latino commu
nity.
"It's a community based on
helping each other," he said.
"There was no point where I
decided to help Latino children.
It's always been with me. I've
always had a direction."
Almanzan has counseled chil
dren who are emotionally dis
turbed, abused or learning-dis
abled. He has also worked at a
summer camp in New York that
brings inner-city kids to the coun
try.
He said one of the things he
found most frustrating in talking
to the homeless was hearing
about their struggles and realiz
ing how much help they need.
Even though some of them have
minimum wage jobs, they're still
homeless, he added.
"It's so amazing that public
perceptions can be so wrong," he
said.

He and others in the project
are preparing a report on Latino
homeless children.
The bigger picture
The students working on the
project have always been aware
that their project had larger
implications. Melissa Beacham,
the project manager, has fre
quently traveled to Washington,
D.C. and Sacramento to discuss
the study with policy makers. In
addition, organizations like the
Children's Defense Fund have
called to inquire about the study's
findings.
"There was positive pressure
for us to come out with the study.
People were concerned about
what we were finding out," said
senior Mary Jo Wien.
Wien is part of a group compil
ing a book that details the broad
er impact of homelessness on chil
dren.
Wien said she became involved
in the study partially because she
"thought it was a good way to
have a meeting of minds —
academia and public service."
"The study takes public service

to a different level because it can
have direct impact on policy
issues," Wien said. "I felt it was a
way to reach more people than if I
tried to help families out one by
one.
"I don't come from a big city,"
she said, "and having personal
contact with the homeless is a dif
ferent feeling, especially meeting
families. It makes it all more
poignant because that's the side
of it you don't see — no one wants
to display their kids on the
streets."
Wien said she has found mis
conceptions about the causes of
homelessness. The cause is "not
personal problems, it's the type of
wages people get and the high
rents," she said.
"At Stanford, we're very isolat
ed, and doing this study got me
