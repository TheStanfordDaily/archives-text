Daily wins national award
The Stanford Daily was recently named a National Pacemaker
by the Associated Collegiate Press.
The Pacemaker is the oldest, and one of the most prestigious
awards in college journalism. "It's the biggest of the big prizes we give,"
said Jim Bernard, a spokesman for the Associated Collegiate Press.
The Pacemaker award, which is co-sponsored by the American
Newspaper Publisher's Association, is granted to five papers
nationwide in each of three enrollment categories.
Each year, publications are solicited nationwide and media
professionals select regional winners from among the entrants.
Winners from the five different regional competitions are then
evaluated by a different group of judges for the national award.
The national recipients are chosen during the Associated Col
legiate Press' annual convention, and professionals in the host
city of the convention judge the entrants.
The Daily was one of five daily papers from four-year colleges
to receive the prize. Other national recipients included The Illini,
of the University of Illinois; The Daily Tar Heel, of the Universi
ty of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; The Daily Trojan, of the Uni
versity of Southern California; and the Indiana Daily Student, of
Indiana University.
Inventor, alumnus dies
Sven Dodington, a Stanford alumnus and inventor of the basic
navigational system that guides airplanes to airports, died Jan. 13
after a long illness. He was 79.
Dodington, who spent most of his engineering career working
for the International Telephone and Telegraph Corp. in New
York, developed the system that uses radio beacons to direct air
planes to landing fields.
He was born in Vancouver, British Columbia.
