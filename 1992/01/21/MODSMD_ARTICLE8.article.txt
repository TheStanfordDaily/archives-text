# Course guide revamped for March release
## Student, faculty comments organized for better comprehension 
### Alain Dalva Staff writer 
Students next quarter may have an easier
time choosing classes thanks to a revamped
ASSU course guide.
Scheduled for released March 12 — during
Dead Week — the course guide will have both
student and faculty evaluations of classes
given spring quarter.
Council of Presidents member Beth Mor
gan, one of three people currently working on
the project, said it will feature two distinct sec
tions. The first part will list 400 undergradu
ate classes accompanied by student evalua

tions and professors' descriptions of their
courses and syllabi.
The second part, she said, will include stu
dent evaluations of all the faculty members
teaching spring quarter. "If students cannot
find a course listed in the first part, they will
be able to refer to the second part to evaluate
the professor teaching it," Morgan added.
Sophomore Kristen Soika, director of the
guide project, said it will be handed out for
free. The publication is funded by money left
over from the old course guide, which was last
produced four years ago.
If the guide proves successful, a special fee will
be introduced for it on the spring ASSU ballot,

Morgan said. If it passes, course guides would
then be released every year during fall quarter.
The old guide was a straightforward print
out of a Folio database of courses and evalua
tions. But the database's content was "lame
and irrelevant," and the old guide quickly died
out, Morgan said.
Senior Scott Christofferson recalled the old
course guide being "lousy and cumbersome to
use." He said he gave up filling out ASSU eval
uation forms in class because he thought they
were "useless" given the old guide's format.
However, Soika said the new guide will be
"as comprehensive as possible."
In particular, the professors'
input will be an unprecedented
feature in the guide, Soika said,
adding that she has been sending
forms to 430 faculty members
asking them to describe their
courses in their own words.
Besides targeting faculty mem
bers, Soika and Morgan also hand
ed out evaluation forms to stu
dents at house meetings in Flo
rence Moore Hall last week. Soika
acknowledged that she did not
receive many student responses
and said she will soon set up a
table in White Plaza where more
students can fill in the forms.
Morgan said the team working
on the course guide is under
"great time pressure" to finish it
before Dead Week.
Soika said she anticipates
great student demand for the
course guide. "Freshmen asked
the COP for (it 1 at the beginning
of the year," she said, adding that
"informal conversations" led her
to believe that students were
excited about the guide.
Soika said student course
guides have been successful at
other colleges across the nation.
She added that she thinks the
Course Guide will be honest in its
evaluations.
