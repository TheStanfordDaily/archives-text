Fatal breast-implant studies to be released
WASHINGTON (AP) — Dow Corning Corp. said yesterday it
will respond by tomorrow to a government request that it release
90 studies and memoranda on which regulators based a morato
rium on the use of silicone gel breast implants.
The Food and Drug Administration says the documents should
be made public and that if the company did not allow their
release, the agency would "take other steps" to do so.
"We'll have a response on Wednesday," Dow Corning
spokeswoman Barbara Carmichael said, referring to the deadline
specified in an FDA letter Friday.
"Our intent is to release all the documents dealing with sci
ence," she said. As to the memoranda, she said, "we're still sort
ing that through."
The FDA's push for release of the material comes in response
to calls for the information by other breast implant manufactur
ers, plastic surgeons, women who have received the implants and
others, he said.
Serbs vow to die before joining Croats
ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — A leader of Croatia's ethnic Serb
minority claimed yesterday that his people had been betrayed by
Serbia's president and would rather "die honorably" than join an
independent Croatia.
The remarks by Mile Paspalj, speaker of self-declared parlia
ment in the enclave of Krajina, reflected the determination of
some ethnic Serbs in Croatia to resist U.N.-supervised peace
efforts. That stance has put them in growing conflict with Ser
bian President Slobodan Milosevic, their former ally.
Milosevic, fearing that Serb-led forces could not defeat a Croa
tia backed by Western Europe, agreed to the U.N. accords in
December. By then thousands of people had died in battles
between Croatian guards and Serb-led forces.
