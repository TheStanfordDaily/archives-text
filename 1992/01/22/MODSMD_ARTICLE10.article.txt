# Jewish group to stress political issues
## Conference kicks off progressive agenda for California students

Eight Stanford students attended a week
end conference at UC-Santa Cruz that marked
the birth of a progressive student organization
dedicated to social action programs relevant to
the Jewish community.
Students for Judaism and Social Justice
intends "to bring people together to create
intellectual and political involvement and
then discuss future implementation," said
conference organizer Akiba Lerner.
The Stanford students were among the
more than 100 conference participants, most
of whom were from the Bay Area. The confer
ence was intended to bring together students
from West Coast campuses.
"It was very interesting and exciting to see
how many Jewish students are interested in
various community activities," said Rebecca
Schwartz, program director at Hillel, Stan
ford's Jewish student organization.
Hillel has more than 800 members at Stan
ford. Schwartz expressed interest in organiz
ing future conferences or even a chapter of the
Students for Judaism and Social Justice at
Stanford.
Members of the new organization have
started a group called "Jews feed the Hun

gry," which helps out in soup kitchens and
homeless shelters.
"We claim our identity as Jews while doing
socially relevant actions," Lerner said.
The organization earlier circulated a peti
tion on the West Coast to get Israel to freeze the
settlements of Russian Jews and initiate nego
tiations for peace over the Palestinian issue.
The conference's keynote address, deliv
ered by Michael Lerner, editor of the Jewish
issues magazine, Tikkun, explored the pro
gressive core of Jewish history and Judaism.
According to student organizers, Lerner also
spoke on whether the $10 billion in U.S. loan
guarantees to Israel should be linked to an
Israeli freeze on settlements in the West bank.
Jenny Helbraun, director of graduate out
reach for the Northern California Hillel Coun
cil, spoke on overcoming tension between
Jews and African-Americans.
A feminist theologian, Rachel Adler, spoke
about feminism and Judaism. She attempted
to reconstruct the history of Jewish women,
which she said has not been canonized in the
various religious texts.
Peter Gabel, a political and legal expert,
talked about how the "progressive left" should
revitalize its image and "address compassion
ately" those issues on which the "right" focuses.

Ilene Philpson from UC-Berkeley spoke
about "identity politics" and the way they
simultaneously create polarization and pro
vide strength to minority groups.
Sunday's conference was sponsored by the
5-year-old Tikkun, the largest Jewish circulat
ing magazine, and Leviathan, the Jewish stu
dent newspaper at UC-Santa Cruz. The group
gets additional financial support from mem
ber donations.
Along with Stanford, other represented
campuses include the Universities of Califor
nia at Berkeley, Davis, Santa Cruz, Los Ange
les and Santa Barbara, along with other guests
from New York, Miami and Eugene, Oregon.
The organization is an off-shoot of the
Community for Judaism and Social Justice
started by Tikkun magazine. It aims "to deal
with the relevant community issues at a deep
er level, study Jewish history, discuss Tikkun
articles . . . and educate ourselves as students
who are progressive liberal Jews," said Akiba
Lerner, whose father edits Tikkun.
Last year a similar conference was orga
nized at Harvard, where students from the
East Coast got together for social action pro
grams within the Jewish community. Lerner
said he hopes "in the next couple of years we
will attempt a national conference."
