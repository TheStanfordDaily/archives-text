Sperm immunity on the way for women
NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — A Johnson & Johnson subsidiary
plans to develop a contraceptive vaccine that family-planning
experts say could be the most important commitment to birth
control by a U.S. company since the pill.
Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. on Monday announced a licensing
agreement with the University of Virginia, essentially
bankrolling years of research and testing of a vaccine that causes
a woman to become immune to sperm.
Although the vaccine is in the experimental stage, Ortho believes
it's promising enough to invest a significant amount of money in its
development, company spokeswoman Clare Castaldo said.
Company officials declined to say how much money was being
invested.
No new wiretaps for police
SACRAMENTO (AP) — A state Senate committee has sound
ly rejected an attempt to give California authorities broad new
powers to use wiretaps to investigate political corruption and cer
tain other crimes.
By a 2-6 vote, the Judiciary Committee yesterday turned down
a bill that would allow taps and bugs in cases involving murder,
kidnapping, gambling, robbery, bribery, extortion, narcotics and
other felonies that threaten life, limb or property.
Current law only allows state and local authorities to use wire
taps to investigate drug trafficking.
The state attorney general's office said the bill, SBII2O by Sen.
Robert Presley, D-Riverside, would give state and local investiga
tors the same wiretap powers as federal officials.
"It's drafted ... so we would not have to go begging to the feds"
for wiretap assistance, said Deputy Attorney General Anthony Dicce.
But opponents, said the bill could lead to the use of wiretaps
for political purposes and violations of the right to privacy.
