The University should
build incentives into
financial aid packages

A FEW MONTHS FROM now,
thousands of Stanford stu
dents will undertake the
unpleasant annual task of filling
out financial aid forms, fingers
crossed in hope that our thirst for
education is quenched before the
financial aid pool drains away.
Financial aid provides many stu
dents with the most compelling,
direct connection they have with
the ongoing budget shortfall. Bud
get cutbacks may affect the quality
of a Stanford education, but reduc
tions in financial aid can determine
whether students receive a Stan
ford education at all.
So far, the University has com
mendably stuck to a need-blind
admissions policy. While individual
students may hold grudges about
how their need was evaluated,
most would probably agree that the
system aims to be fair. But facing
an anticipated reduction of $2.5
million, how can the Financial Aids
Office best maintain solvency and
fairness?
Aid at Stanford is provided
through various combinations of
grants, loans and employment
opportunities. One flaw in the cur
rent system is that students who
apply for and earn outside scholar
ships find their Stanford aid pack
age reduced proportionally. This
creates an obvious disincentive for
students to seek outside funding.
Stanford should encourage stu
dents to secure outside sources of
funding, thereby creating more
funds for those with greater need.
Methods include lowering the per
centage by which outside scholar
ships reduce loans and grants, or
converting the Stanford tuition
grant to a long-term university loan.
Similarly, the University should
stop penalizing students for work
ing during the school year. Stu

dents prize education. They usual
ly do not work for fun, but because
they have to earn money. Yet stu
dents who work more than the
number of hours calculated by the
Financial Aid Office find their aid
packages reduced commensurately.
Work essentially provides a safe
ty valve for inevitable flaws in the
system of need calculation. Family
tensions, sudden expenses or a
personal sense of responsibility are
reasons why some students feel
they must work longer hours than
the University recommends.
The University should contribu
tions from non-custodial, divorced
parents of students. This require
ment should, of course, be waived
where it can be demonstrated that
the non-custodial parent refuses
support.
This last recommendation may
place an additional burden on many
students, who may end up as "go
between" for hostile or non-commu
nicating parents. But to maintain a
financial aid system which can help
those students who have no other
way of paying for their education,
the University must bring into play
all potential resources.
Just as students should play
their part to shoulder as much of
the financial burden as they can, so
should the University respect that
effort. One way it could do so is to
make its appeals procedure more
user-friendly. Another would be to
orient work-study funding toward
summer jobs, so that students on
aid can have the same opportunity
to develop career interests through
meaningful employment that
wealthier students have.
And finally, the University
should establish peer counseling
for financial aid, so that students
who understand the ins and outs
of the process can advise those
who do not.
As a university, Stanford cannot
do much about the pre-existing dis
parities in wealth among its stu
dents. But with a sound financial pol
icy based on good faith, the Universi
ty can provide all its students equal
access to a Stanford education.
