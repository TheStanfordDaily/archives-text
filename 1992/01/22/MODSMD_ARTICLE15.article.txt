## The
						journey of a horse 
### 
IANLI, THE HORSE, was becom
f ling increasingly bored about his
daily life. He had lived in this small
farnmig village in northern China for
over three years. His job was to operate
the rice grinder, which crushed rice to
make flour. It was a primitive instrument
made of two concentric cylindrical stones.
There was a small gap between the cylin
ders. This was where rice was filled.
Everyday as Qianli pushed the handle
attached to the outer cylinder and walked
circles and circles around the grinder, the
heavy stones glided against the rice. The
crushed powder then accumulated in a
basket beneath the grinder.
Qianli had heard stories about his wild
ancestors. Back then, the plain was open
and the days were free. His forefathers
roamed the plains of northern China from
the mountains to the sea. They grazed
among the fresh green of the morning
grassland. They drank by the crimson
sunset of the evening stream. They slept
under the twinkling stars of the night sky.
For Qianli, however, life was nothing
but routine. Everyday, he received his
quota of staple. Everyday, he ground his
quota of rice. He longed for the excite
ment of the old time.
One day a tall green-eyed creature
came to the village. He opened Qianli's
mouth and looked at his teeth. He touched
Qianli's muscles and felt his strength. He
then smiled and nodded his head. Qianli

was sold. He would be brought to Ameri
ca to work as a race horse.
Qianli was rather excited about the
sudden change of life. He was admittedly
nervous about the whole situation. He
didn't quite understand what was to hap
pen. But he figured that for someone in
his position, any change had to be good
change. Besides, Qianli heard that Amer
ica was a land where freedom was held as
the highest principle. Maybe, he would
get a taste of his ancestors' lives after all.
Qianli was treated very well in Ameri
ca. He ate and drank whenever he
desired. He was always allowed time to
walk and relax. Sometime, he even got to
run in a big field. He really appreciated
his new-found freedom and liked this
place called America.
As time passed, he developed a special
friendship with his jockey. They spent
many hours together every day. He espe
cially liked the way he washed him with a
hose. The pulsating water made his mus
cles loose and he felt like a new-born
horse every time.
Once Qianli came down with a fever.
His jockey tended him around the clock.
He was given shots and medicine. Qianli
was very touched. He now knew at least
one human being who actually cared
about him. He desperately wanted to run
a good race to show his own worth.
His chance finally came on a sunny
day in the spring. His jockey hugged and

encouraged him as they arrived at the
race track. A large crowd had already
gathered there. They seemed to be quite
excited and were all talking loudly.
Qianli was a bit overwhelmed by all
the people, but the calm presence of his
jockey soothed him. At least someone
familiar would be with him all the time.
All the horses were lined up. As the
gate opened, they all rushed out like a
raging flood. Qianli was whipped on the
back and bumped from the sides. He
looked ahead. The space was wide open.
He saw the blue sky racing. He saw the
white cloud charging. He saw the green
mountain rushing. He saw all the people
standing on their feet cheering.
Qianli was definitely excited. This
must be the way his ancestors had lived.
This must be what freedom was all about.
He surged ahead like the wind.
As he made his turn. Qianli was bewil
dered. He arrived at the same gate. He
saw the same sky, cloud and mountain.
What he had just reached was exactly
where he had started, except now it was
called the finish line.
