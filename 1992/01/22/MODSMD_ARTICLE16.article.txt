Rethinking Stanford athletics: excellence vs. equity?

STANFORD HAS FINALLY SHOWN
its true colors to the nation with the
much-vaunted return of Bill Walsh
to the Cardinal. While salary speculation
remains "unconfirmed," Walsh is report
edly being paid an exorbitant $350,000,
with rumors of an additional $500,000
from wealthy benefactors.
While $350,000 is paltry compared to
what he may have made elsewhere,
Walsh is now the highest paid official at
Stanford, assuming of course that navy
regulator-guru Paul Biddle does not win
his $30 million lawsuit.
In light of the $40 million budget
quagmire, hiring a football coach at such
a disproportionate sum seems just a bit
inappropriate. The University seems to
be asking, why do we need the Art or

Drama Department, when we can have a
first-rate football team?
I have heard plenty of arguments that
football is a money-generating enter
prise that funds many other programs. I
wonder just how true this is.
The fundamental question that must
be asked by every member of the Stan
ford community is this: excellence, but
at what price? How many members of
the football or any other major team,
however good, receive scholarship
money that — according to the standard
of demonstrated need — they would not
otherwise receive?
The numbers may be relatively small,
but they are significant nonetheless.
Everyone here has seen the "full-ride"
athlete who drives a sporty BMW or

equivalent car. And everyone knows
someone suffering under the oppressive
weight of ever-diminishing financial aid
packages.
Why is Stanford paying athletes to
have the honor and distinction of receiv
ing a Stanford diploma, when thousands
of people in this country and around the
world would literally sacrifice everything
to achieve the same distinction?
Why are not the best writers or actors
given similar treatment? Many of the
athletic scholarships are endowed by
alumni. But not all. The University
should be forthcoming with precise fig
ures. Perhaps then, we could see just
how prized athletic excellence really is.
None of the Ivy League schools has
athletic scholarships; all financial aid is

based on demonstrated need, as it right
ly should be. These schools still remain
strong in spirit, as would Stanford.
Furthermore, basic athletic facilities
for the general student body are sorely
lacking. Compare Encina or Roble Gym
to facilities at Georgetown or Harvard
University. The bathroom in Encina by
the men's locker room is a perfect exam
ple of the deplorable conditions.
In light of the above, I find it inexpli
cable that a University such as Stanford
spends so much money and resources on
an elite group of pampered athletes.
A Stanford education is an honor to
be coveted, not currency with which to
bribe.
