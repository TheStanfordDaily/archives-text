# Stanford has cheated students in decision to abolish Salamanca
## 
### 
It makes me sad that this time of bud
get-slashing has turned into a war of
self-interests. At a time when a well
rounded education should take priority,
it seems to actually be losing importance.
This tragedy is especially evident in
the fight for overseas programs. I was
outraged when I heard the program in
Salamanca might be closed.
How could a program that costs only
$75,000 be cut, when Oxford alone costs
$500,000? By cutting Oxford by 7 percent
and Kyoto by 3 percent, Salamanca would
be saved. The reason these alternatives
aren't being considered is because Sala
manca provides no "paid vacations."
Faculty do not get any travel opportu
nities to Salamanca like they would to
Santiago, Chile. Salamanca is a separate
university with no Stanford faculty or
facilities. Students live in dorms with
Spanish students and take classes in

Spanish with them. Most students
return practically fluent and with great
insight into the Spanish culture.
I've heard that students coming back
from other programs actually lose their
language proficiency from lack of use.
Other overseas campuses simply do not
provide the same level of cultural and lan
guage immersion that Salamanca does.
Isn't cultural and language immersion the
essence of the overseas experience?
Salamanca's real value far outweighs
its insubstantial cost.
Stanford will spend more money, not
less as claimed, if Chile replaces Spain.
It's obvious that taking faculty away from
Stanford will cost more. Not only do we
have to pay the existing faculty, but we
also must pay lecturers to replace them.
I understand that professors want to
travel, but their time abroad need not be
funded by the University. If students and
faculty just want a change of scenery,
they can travel during the summer.
After all, isn't education the central
mission of the University? Budget cut
ting simply means prioritizing.
It's a time of hard decisions. These deci

sions will indicate between whose interests
the University has at heart. Unfortunate
ly, the decision makers are demonstrating
their lack of perspective by electing to
replace Salamanca with Santiago.
We can no longer afford to support
self-interest.
