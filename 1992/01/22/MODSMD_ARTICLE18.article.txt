# Bill Walsh's return to coaching provides great boost to the University
## 
### 
Jan. 16 was a great day for Stanford, in
particular the Stanford football program.
Bill Walsh, one of the great coaches in his
tory and a member of the Stanford family,
announced with great pride and enthusi
asm that he was returning to be our head
football coach. I think the entire Stanford
community is excited about his return.
In the media, however, there have been
several erroneous reports about Walsh's
salary. In matters such as these, the

media feel compelled to report numbers
even if there is no official confirmation.
As the Director of Athletics, I would like
to set the record straight. Bill Walsh is not
being paid an extraordinarily high salaiy. I
promise you that although the financial
arrangements must remain between Bill
and ourselves, his salary is competitive
with that paid to other coaches in the
Pacific-10 Conference. The figures being
reported are incorrect and simply specula
tion put forth by uninformed people.
Bill Walsh's return to Stanford is a
tremendous boost to the entire Athletic
Department in every way imaginable. I,
for one, can't wait for the 1992 season.
