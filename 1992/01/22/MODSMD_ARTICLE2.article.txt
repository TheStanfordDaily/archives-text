# Campus still grapples with issues of alcohol
## 
### Kim McCreery Staff writer 
In the wake of the controversial alco
hol policy implemented last year, campus
drug education programs have struggled
to get the attention of students who feel
hammered with rules and regulations.
Since last spring, party organizers
have tightened control at open parties,
hiring security guards and requiring stu
dent drinkers to sign lists. Residential
Education has started making deliberate
efforts to subscribe to the stricter drug
policy, keeping watch over the amount of
alcohol purchased by dorms.
The new policy was a response to the
federal Drug-Free Schools and Commu
nities Act, which attempted to force col
leges to take a harder line against illicit
alcohol and drug use.
Although students say they see obvi
ous changes since the implementation of
the policy, many drugs — especially alco
hol — are still readily available.
Sophomore Annie Reese said that
although there are noticeable differences
now, like "rent-a-cops" outside fraterni
ty parties, "It's not hard to get a drink at
frats. Especially if you get there early,
they'll give you anything you want.

"A lot of it is who you know, too,"
Reese added. "I think women have a lot
less problem getting alcohol than men."
Junior Andy Roner said he noticed a
heightened awareness of liability at fra
ternities, but said it is still easy to slip
through the cracks.
"There are definitely a lot more planned
pre-parties," he said. "But even at the
frats, there are so many people that they
can't sign in everybody. There's a new
emphasis on getting around the rules."
But Interfraternity Council President
Steve Jarrett said the new measures
taken by fraternities have been effective.
"It's a lot harder to get a beer at a fra
ternity now. Of course, like at any party,
there always a way to get it," Jarrett
said. "People who want to drink are
going to drink, but it's not like it used to
be where anybody could just walk in the
door and get alcohol."
While party organizers claim they
now must pay stricter attention to the
new rules, party-goers say they are tired
of hearing about them.
"Even at freshman hall meetings it's
hard to keep people's attention," said
sophomore Siobhan Fisher "Beyond the
freshman year, most people will
turn a deaf ear to alcohol education
programs. Especially now, it just
seems like overkill."
Trying to change attitudes
Elise Lenox faced these atti
tudes when she began her posi
tion three months ago as the new
director of drug prevention pro
grams at Cowell Health Center.
She now heads Project R 2 ISC,
which aims to promote a safer
environment for community
drinking, rather than prohibiting
the use of alcohol or punishing
violators. Although the project
was started at the same time as
the new alcohol policy, it is com
pletely separate from it.
After spending 10 years doing
"drug talks" in public secondary
schools and colleges, Lenox said
she finds that the drug habits in
the Stanford community are sim
ply a reflection of the American
culture. And those deeply
ingrained habits, she said, are dif
ficult to change.
"What I see as my challenge is
to keep the issues in the fore
front," she said. "I want the Stan
ford community to address them
as a community, talk about alco
hol as a part of life and culture."
Several local and national
groups have successfully cam
paigned to reduce some drug
related problems, especially
drunk driving. Lenox said she
believes other consequences, such
as unwanted sex, alcohol poison
ing and suicide are still largely
ignored.
"Driving under the influence is
what you immediately think of,"
she said. "So people think if
they're not driving, they can get

trashed and it won't matter.
That's not true. We need to raise
some other issues.
"People are not so deep into
hard drug abuse here," Lenox
said. "The use is different, not
better or worse. It's extremely
centered on alcohol. People tend
to drink their drugs here, mostly
alcohol and caffeine. I've even
heard girls say that they were
drinking their calories tonight."
According to Lenox, this could
be largely due to the kind of stu
dents who attend the University.
"About one out of every nine stu
dents have alcoholic parents," she
said. "To cope with the family
addiction, they become high
achievers: They compensate by
trying to be perfect. But most peo
ple don't recognize that these stu
dents then have the tendency to
become alcoholics, to form very
dependent relationships, even to
marry alcoholics."
In a 1989 survey of Stanford
freshmen, Cowell Health Promo
tion Program found that 30 per
cent of the respondents reported
drinking alcohol more than once
or twice a week; about 66 percent
drink more than once or twice a
month; and less than 25 percent
never drank.
Still, 66 percent of the group
said "there should be less empha
sis on drinking in student activi
ties."
This is right in line with one of

Lenox's main targets: getting
party organizers to offer a better
selection of non-alcoholic drinks
at parties.
"[Non-alcoholic beverages] are
just a formality," she said. "Stu
dents talk about them as a joke.
The plan is usually to have about
one two-liter bottle of Coke for
every couple kegs of beer."
Lenox said she hopes to estab
lish better guidelines as to quanti
ties of non-alcoholic beverages
compared to alcoholic ones. "Alco
hol is so expensive that it doesn't
leave much for EANABs (non
alcohlic beverages) unless you've
really planned for it," she said.
Especially at fraternity parties,
non-alcoholic beverages can be
hard to come by.

"Lots of times they will tell you
there's a drinking fountain down
the hall and that's it," said Fisher.
"But even if I drink alcohol, I like
to alternate. Some kind of drink
in my hand is like a social crutch,
even if it's not alcohol."
Manzanita resident assistant
Doug Stewart explained that the
need for alcohol is another reflec
tion of our culture.
"People are uptight," Stewart
said. "Again it's a cultural thing.
If there is no community to begin
with and you don't know each
other to begin with, then defenses
are up. Alcohol becomes this com
mon focus that relaxes people and
brings them together."
While the demand for non
alcoholic drinks seems to go large

ly unfulfilled, many students
doubt that totally alcohol-free
parties would be successful.
"There would be zero inter
est," said Reese. "There was an
awesome band at a dorm Hal
loween party, but there was no
alcohol and there was nobody
there."
Stewart said that although
most alcohol-free parties
wouldn't be successful compared
to alcohol-related ones, parties
that have a main focus can still be
very popular.
"The bonfire for instance,
draws tons of people," he said.
"But there's already a rallying
point there. Not to mention that
lots of people get drunk before
hand and then go."

Moving forward
Lenox said that much progress
has been made over the past
decade regarding drug use.
"At the state school I worked at,
we'd have students choking on
their vomit, rushing into the emer
gency room from poisoning and
wrecking cars all the time. And all
we could do was pick up the
pieces," she said. "One year, two
students froze to death in their
cars because they were drunk."
Lenox said that there are no
easy solutions to the attitudes
about alcohol, but said she wants
to become a resource for people to
come to when they need informa
tion or advice on any drug issues.
Slowly, students are starting to
respond.
"I've had about 10 students
call who were worried about a
roommate or a friend's drug use,"
Lenox said. "They usually call us
because they know that we can at
least plug them into the right net
work to get the right help."
Lenox has also found that
many students need to learn to
recognize the symptoms of prob
lem drinking and how to approach
friends about their problems.
"People don't know where
their rights end and where others
begin," she said. "I want to give
them a feeling that they have the
ability, the permission to care."
Bridging the gap for drug edu
cation groups may not be an easy
task. "I hope I can help improve
communication," she said. "Peo
ple don't talk a lot between one
program and another here."
Lenox said she hopes to get
students, faculty, retailers and
community members talking.
Open meetings are held the first
Tuesday of each month for repre
sentatives of each of these groups,
as well as others who want to
voice ideas or opinions on alcohol
use in the Stanford community.

dents who attend the University.
"About one out of every nine stu
dents have alcoholic parents," she
said. "To cope with the family
addiction, they become high
achievers: They compensate by
trying to be perfect. But most peo
ple don't recognize that these stu
dents then have the tendency to
become alcoholics, to form very
dependent relationships, even to
marry alcoholics."
In a 1989 survey of Stanford
freshmen, Cowell Health Promo
tion Program found that 30 per
cent of the respondents reported
drinking alcohol more than once
or twice a week; about 66 percent
drink more than once or twice a
month; and less than 25 percent
never drank.
Still, 66 percent of the group
said "there should be less empha
sis on drinking in student activi
ties."
This is right in line with one of

Lenox's main targets: getting
party organizers to offer a better
selection of non-alcoholic drinks
at parties.
"[Non-alcoholic beverages] are
just a formality," she said. "Stu
dents talk about them as a joke.
The plan is usually to have about
one two-liter bottle of Coke for
every couple kegs of beer."
Lenox said she hopes to estab
lish better guidelines as to quanti
ties of non-alcoholic beverages
compared to alcoholic ones. "Alco
hol is so expensive that it doesn't
leave much for EANABs (non
alcohlic beverages) unless you've
really planned for it," she said.
Especially at fraternity parties,
non-alcoholic beverages can be
hard to come by.

"Lots of times they will tell you
there's a drinking fountain down
the hall and that's it," said Fisher.
"But even if I drink alcohol, I like
to alternate. Some kind of drink
in my hand is like a social crutch,
even if it's not alcohol."
Manzanita resident assistant
Doug Stewart explained that the
need for alcohol is another reflec
tion of our culture.
"People are uptight," Stewart
said. "Again it's a cultural thing.
If there is no community to begin
with and you don't know each
other to begin with, then defenses
are up. Alcohol becomes this com
mon focus that relaxes people and
brings them together."
While the demand for non
alcoholic drinks seems to go large

ly unfulfilled, many students
doubt that totally alcohol-free
parties would be successful.
"There would be zero inter
est," said Reese. "There was an
awesome band at a dorm Hal
loween party, but there was no
alcohol and there was nobody
there."
Stewart said that although
most alcohol-free parties
wouldn't be successful compared
to alcohol-related ones, parties
that have a main focus can still be
very popular.
"The bonfire for instance,
draws tons of people," he said.
"But there's already a rallying
point there. Not to mention that
lots of people get drunk before
hand and then go."

Moving forward
Lenox said that much progress
has been made over the past
decade regarding drug use.
"At the state school I worked at,
we'd have students choking on
their vomit, rushing into the emer
gency room from poisoning and
wrecking cars all the time. And all
we could do was pick up the
pieces," she said. "One year, two
students froze to death in their
cars because they were drunk."
Lenox said that there are no
easy solutions to the attitudes
about alcohol, but said she wants
to become a resource for people to
come to when they need informa
tion or advice on any drug issues.
Slowly, students are starting to
respond.
"I've had about 10 students
call who were worried about a
roommate or a friend's drug use,"
Lenox said. "They usually call us
because they know that we can at
least plug them into the right net
work to get the right help."
Lenox has also found that
many students need to learn to
recognize the symptoms of prob
lem drinking and how to approach
friends about their problems.
"People don't know where
their rights end and where others
begin," she said. "I want to give
them a feeling that they have the
ability, the permission to care."
Bridging the gap for drug edu
cation groups may not be an easy
task. "I hope I can help improve
communication," she said. "Peo
ple don't talk a lot between one
program and another here."
Lenox said she hopes to get
students, faculty, retailers and
community members talking.
Open meetings are held the first
Tuesday of each month for repre
sentatives of each of these groups,
as well as others who want to
voice ideas or opinions on alcohol
use in the Stanford community.
In the wake of the controversial alco
hol policy implemented last year, campus
drug education programs have struggled
to get the attention of students who feel
hammered with rules and regulations.
Since last spring, party organizers
have tightened control at open parties,
hiring security guards and requiring stu
dent drinkers to sign lists. Residential
Education has started making deliberate
efforts to subscribe to the stricter drug
policy, keeping watch over the amount of
alcohol purchased by dorms.
The new policy was a response to the
federal Drug-Free Schools and Commu
nities Act, which attempted to force col
leges to take a harder line against illicit
alcohol and drug use.
Although students say they see obvi
ous changes since the implementation of
the policy, many drugs — especially alco
hol — are still readily available.
Sophomore Annie Reese said that
although there are noticeable differences
now, like "rent-a-cops" outside fraterni
ty parties, "It's not hard to get a drink at
frats. Especially if you get there early,
they'll give you anything you want.

"A lot of it is who you know, too,"
Reese added. "I think women have a lot
less problem getting alcohol than men."
Junior Andy Roner said he noticed a
heightened awareness of liability at fra
ternities, but said it is still easy to slip
through the cracks.
"There are definitely a lot more planned
pre-parties," he said. "But even at the
frats, there are so many people that they
can't sign in everybody. There's a new
emphasis on getting around the rules."
But Interfraternity Council President
Steve Jarrett said the new measures
taken by fraternities have been effective.
"It's a lot harder to get a beer at a fra
ternity now. Of course, like at any party,
there always a way to get it," Jarrett
said. "People who want to drink are
going to drink, but it's not like it used to
be where anybody could just walk in the
door and get alcohol."
While party organizers claim they
now must pay stricter attention to the
new rules, party-goers say they are tired
of hearing about them.
"Even at freshman hall meetings it's
hard to keep people's attention," said
sophomore Siobhan Fisher "Beyond the
freshman year, most people will
turn a deaf ear to alcohol education
programs. Especially now, it just
seems like overkill."
Trying to change attitudes
Elise Lenox faced these atti
tudes when she began her posi
tion three months ago as the new
director of drug prevention pro
grams at Cowell Health Center.
She now heads Project R 2 ISC,
which aims to promote a safer
environment for community
drinking, rather than prohibiting
the use of alcohol or punishing
violators. Although the project
was started at the same time as
the new alcohol policy, it is com
pletely separate from it.
After spending 10 years doing
"drug talks" in public secondary
schools and colleges, Lenox said
she finds that the drug habits in
the Stanford community are sim
ply a reflection of the American
culture. And those deeply
ingrained habits, she said, are dif
ficult to change.
"What I see as my challenge is
to keep the issues in the fore
front," she said. "I want the Stan
ford community to address them
as a community, talk about alco
hol as a part of life and culture."
Several local and national
groups have successfully cam
paigned to reduce some drug
related problems, especially
drunk driving. Lenox said she
believes other consequences, such
as unwanted sex, alcohol poison
ing and suicide are still largely
ignored.
"Driving under the influence is
what you immediately think of,"
she said. "So people think if
they're not driving, they can get

trashed and it won't matter.
That's not true. We need to raise
some other issues.
"People are not so deep into
hard drug abuse here," Lenox
said. "The use is different, not
better or worse. It's extremely
centered on alcohol. People tend
to drink their drugs here, mostly
alcohol and caffeine. I've even
heard girls say that they were
drinking their calories tonight."
According to Lenox, this could
be largely due to the kind of stu
dents who attend the University.
"About one out of every nine stu
dents have alcoholic parents," she
said. "To cope with the family
addiction, they become high

communication," she said. "Peo
ple don't talk a lot between one
program and another here."
Lenox said she hopes to get
students, faculty, retailers and
community members talking.
Open meetings are held the first
Tuesday of each month for repre
sentatives of each of these groups,
as well as others who want to
voice ideas or opinions on alcohol
use in the Stanford community.
In the wake of the controversial alco
hol policy implemented last year, campus
drug education programs have struggled
to get the attention of students who feel
hammered with rules and regulations.
Since last spring, party organizers
have tightened control at open parties,
hiring security guards and requiring stu
dent drinkers to sign lists. Residential
Education has started making deliberate
efforts to subscribe to the stricter drug
policy, keeping watch over the amount of
alcohol purchased by dorms.
The new policy was a response to the
federal Drug-Free Schools and Commu
nities Act, which attempted to force col
leges to take a harder line against illicit
alcohol and drug use.
Although students say they see obvi
ous changes since the implementation of
the policy, many drugs — especially alco
hol — are still readily available.
Sophomore Annie Reese said that
although there are noticeable differences
now, like "rent-a-cops" outside fraterni
ty parties, "It's not hard to get a drink at
frats. Especially if you get there early,
they'll give you anything you want.

"A lot of it is who you know, too,"
Reese added. "I think women have a lot
less problem getting alcohol than men."
Junior Andy Roner said he noticed a
heightened awareness of liability at fra
ternities, but said it is still easy to slip
through the cracks.
"There are definitely a lot more planned
pre-parties," he said. "But even at the
frats, there are so many people that they
can't sign in everybody. There's a new
emphasis on getting around the rules."
But Interfraternity Council President
Steve Jarrett said the new measures
taken by fraternities have been effective.
"It's a lot harder to get a beer at a fra
ternity now. Of course, like at any party,
there always a way to get it," Jarrett
said. "People who want to drink are
going to drink, but it's not like it used to
be where anybody could just walk in the
door and get alcohol."
While party organizers claim they
now must pay stricter attention to the
new rules, party-goers say they are tired
of hearing about them.
"Even at freshman hall meetings it's
hard to keep people's attention," said
sophomore Siobhan Fisher "Beyond the
freshman year, most people will
turn a deaf ear to alcohol education
programs. Especially now, it just
seems like overkill."
Trying to change attitudes
Elise Lenox faced these atti
tudes when she began her posi
tion three months ago as the new
director of drug prevention pro
grams at Cowell Health Center.
She now heads Project R 2 ISC,
which aims to promote a safer
environment for community
drinking, rather than prohibiting
the use of alcohol or punishing
violators. Although the project
was started at the same time as
the new alcohol policy, it is com
pletely separate from it.
After spending 10 years doing
"drug talks" in public secondary
schools and colleges, Lenox said
she finds that the drug habits in
the Stanford community are sim
ply a reflection of the American
culture. And those deeply
ingrained habits, she said, are dif
ficult to change.
"What I see as my challenge is
to keep the issues in the fore
front," she said. "I want the Stan
ford community to address them
as a community, talk about alco
hol as a part of life and culture."
Several local and national
groups have successfully cam
paigned to reduce some drug
related problems, especially
drunk driving. Lenox said she
believes other consequences, such
as unwanted sex, alcohol poison
ing and suicide are still largely
ignored.
"Driving under the influence is
what you immediately think of,"
she said. "So people think if
they're not driving, they can get

trashed and it won't matter.
That's not true. We need to raise
some other issues.
"People are not so deep into
hard drug abuse here," Lenox
said. "The use is different, not
better or worse. It's extremely
centered on alcohol. People tend
to drink their drugs here, mostly
alcohol and caffeine. I've even
heard girls say that they were
drinking their calories tonight."
According to Lenox, this could
be largely due to the kind of stu
dents who attend the University.
"About one out of every nine stu
dents have alcoholic parents," she
said. "To cope with the family
addiction, they become high
achievers: They compensate by
trying to be perfect. But most peo
ple don't recognize that these stu
dents then have the tendency to
become alcoholics, to form very
dependent relationships, even to
marry alcoholics."
In a 1989 survey of Stanford
freshmen, Cowell Health Promo
tion Program found that 30 per
cent of the respondents reported
drinking alcohol more than once
or twice a week; about 66 percent
drink more than once or twice a
month; and less than 25 percent
never drank.
Still, 66 percent of the group
said "there should be less empha
sis on drinking in student activi
ties."
This is right in line with one of

Lenox's main targets: getting
party organizers to offer a better
selection of non-alcoholic drinks
at parties.
"[Non-alcoholic beverages] are
just a formality," she said. "Stu
dents talk about them as a joke.
The plan is usually to have about
one two-liter bottle of Coke for
every couple kegs of beer."
Lenox said she hopes to estab
lish better guidelines as to quanti
ties of non-alcoholic beverages
compared to alcoholic ones. "Alco
hol is so expensive that it doesn't
leave much for EANABs (non
alcohlic beverages) unless you've
really planned for it," she said.
Especially at fraternity parties,
non-alcoholic beverages can be
hard to come by.

"Lots of times they will tell you
there's a drinking fountain down
the hall and that's it," said Fisher.
"But even if I drink alcohol, I like
to alternate. Some kind of drink
in my hand is like a social crutch,
even if it's not alcohol."
Manzanita resident assistant
Doug Stewart explained that the
need for alcohol is another reflec
tion of our culture.
"People are uptight," Stewart
said. "Again it's a cultural thing.
If there is no community to begin
with and you don't know each
other to begin with, then defenses
are up. Alcohol becomes this com
mon focus that relaxes people and
brings them together."
While the demand for non
alcoholic drinks seems to go large

ly unfulfilled, many students
doubt that totally alcohol-free
parties would be successful.
"There would be zero inter
est," said Reese. "There was an
awesome band at a dorm Hal
loween party, but there was no
alcohol and there was nobody
there."
Stewart said that although
most alcohol-free parties
wouldn't be successful compared
to alcohol-related ones, parties
that have a main focus can still be
very popular.
"The bonfire for instance,
draws tons of people," he said.
"But there's already a rallying
point there. Not to mention that
lots of people get drunk before
hand and then go."

Moving forward
Lenox said that much progress
has been made over the past
decade regarding drug use.
"At the state school I worked at,
we'd have students choking on
their vomit, rushing into the emer
gency room from poisoning and
wrecking cars all the time. And all
we could do was pick up the
pieces," she said. "One year, two
students froze to death in their
cars because they were drunk."
Lenox said that there are no
easy solutions to the attitudes
about alcohol, but said she wants
to become a resource for people to
come to when they need informa
tion or advice on any drug issues.
Slowly, students are starting to
respond.
"I've had about 10 students
call who were worried about a
roommate or a friend's drug use,"
Lenox said. "They usually call us
because they know that we can at
least plug them into the right net
work to get the right help."
Lenox has also found that
many students need to learn to
recognize the symptoms of prob
lem drinking and how to approach
friends about their problems.
"People don't know where
their rights end and where others
begin," she said. "I want to give
them a feeling that they have the
ability, the permission to care."
Bridging the gap for drug edu
cation groups may not be an easy
task. "I hope I can help improve
communication," she said. "Peo
ple don't talk a lot between one
program and another here."
Lenox said she hopes to get
students, faculty, retailers and
community members talking.
Open meetings are held the first
Tuesday of each month for repre
sentatives of each of these groups,
as well as others who want to
voice ideas or opinions on alcohol
use in the Stanford community.
