# Campus still grapples with issues of alcohol

### Kim McCreery Staff writer 
In the wake of the controversial alco
hol policy implemented last year, campus
drug education programs have struggled
to get the attention of students who feel
hammered with rules and regulations.
Since last spring, party organizers
have tightened control at open parties,
hiring security guards and requiring stu
dent drinkers to sign lists. Residential
Education has started making deliberate
efforts to subscribe to the stricter drug
policy, keeping watch over the amount of
alcohol purchased by dorms.
The new policy was a response to the
federal Drug-Free Schools and Commu
nities Act, which attempted to force col
leges to take a harder line against illicit
alcohol and drug use.
Although students say they see obvi
ous changes since the implementation of
the policy, many drugs — especially alco

Sophomore Annie Reese said that
although there are noticeable differences
now, like "rent-a-cops" outside fraterni

frats. Especially if you get there early,
they'll give you anything you want.

"A lot of it is who you know, too,"
Reese added. "I think women have a lot
less problem getting alcohol than men."
Junior Andy Roner said he noticed a
heightened awareness of liability at fra
ternities, but said it is still easy to slip
through the cracks.
"There are definitely a lot more planned
pre-parties," he said. "But even at the
frats, there are so many people that they
can't sign in everybody. There's a new
emphasis on getting around the rules."
But Interfraternity Council President
Steve Jarrett said the new measures
taken by fraternities have been effective.
"It's a lot harder to get a beer at a fra
ternity now. Of course, like at any party,
there always a way to get it," Jarrett
said. "People who want to drink are
going to drink, but it's not like it used to
be where anybody could just walk in the
door and get alcohol."
While party organizers claim they
now must pay stricter attention to the
new rules, party-goers say they are tired
of hearing about them.
"Even at freshman hall meetings it's
hard to keep people's attention," said
sophomore Siobhan Fisher "Beyond the
