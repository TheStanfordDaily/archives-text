## Hoops hits AP top 25 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
The last time Stanford
cracked the top 25 in men's bas
ketball, Adam Keefe was a
shiny-faced freshman helping
Todd Lichti take the team to a
No. 13 ranking and a second
ever berth in the NCAA Tourna
ment.
Stanford (11-1, 3-0 in the
Pacific-10 Conference) is ranked
No. 24 in this week's Associated
Press poll, but with No. 33 USC
and No. 2 UCLA visiting this
weekend, Keefe and the Cardi
nal can't afford to be nostalgic.
"It is nice and it is an accom
plishment to this point," said
Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery. "But with USC and
UCLA coming in, it could be
short-lived."
Despite returning just one
starter from last year's 20-13
team, stubborn Stanford
sneaked into the top 25 with 192
points, 81 more than No. 25
UNLV, a Final Four team in
1990-91.
Stanford is the fourth Pac-10
team to be ranked, behind unde
feated UCLA (12-0) and No. 11
Arizona (11-3). USC (11-3) was
previously ranked No. 24 before
losing to Notre Dame and Ari
zona State.
Stanford will have more than
its national ranking on the line
against USC, Thursday at 7:30
p.m., and UCLA, Saturday at 3
p.m. After dropping its only
game of the season at No. 14
Michigan State in December,
Stanford has won five games in
a row and has a nine-game home
win streak dating back to last
vear's 89-86 loss to UCLA.
