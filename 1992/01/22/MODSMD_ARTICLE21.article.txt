# Cardinal tests wings in Pac-10 Indoors
## O.B. soars over draw, takes singles title 
### Amy Wusterbarth Editorial staff 
After several size-up-the-competition
tournaments, the men's tennis team is
ready for conference dual meet action.
This weekend at the Pacific 10 Indoor
Tennis Tournament the Cardinal men
showed that they have "definitely made
progress since the fall," according to
sophomore Robert Devens.
"Overall everyone had bright spots
and had some good results. It was nice to
sit on the court and focus on one match
and one player; that's really valuable,"
head coach Dick Gould said.
Alex O'Brien, the top-ranked player in
the nation, defended his singles title by
walking over Washington's Chet Crile, 6-
3, 6-1 in the finals.
"It's not easy being a defending champi
on," Gould said. "Rather than thinking
about it, Alex just went out and played.
He's really improved in the last two weeks.
I'm excited about this season for him."
Jason Yee lost in three sets to USC's
David Ekerot in the flight 2 finals. He too
had substantially improved since last
week. "Jason played much more solidly,"
Gould said.
In flight 3, made up of the teams'
number five and six players, sophomore
Vimal Patel defeated Tim Brown of
Washington in the finals. "I didn't play
too great. I had several matches that I
pulled out at the end," Patel said. "I
guess since I haven't played many
matches this year, I did okav."
Roman Sydorak also pulled out a tough
match against Arizona's Matt Foote in the
finals of his flight, 6-7,6-3,7-5.
In the consolation rounds, Devens
came out on top in flight 2 action. "At first
I was getting used to playing indoors and
my first round opponent (Bryan Geiger)
was tough to play because he passed real

ly well," Devens explained. "After he
broke my serve I got really frustrated, but
I played well in the consolation."
In doubles action, the Cardinal is still
mixing and matching players. O'Brien
and sophomore Chris Cocotos made it to
the finals before losing to USC's power
house duo of Brian MacPhie and Jon
Leachâ€”the same team that beat them
last week.
"Their service games were really
good, they had a high percentage of first
serves (in play)," Cocotos said. "We could
have given them a better run on the
return games though."
Gould agreed: "USC has exceptionally
fine doubles. Their No. 2 team played
together all last year. All our teams are
new. We didn't spend much time in the
fall on doubles and it shows."
This week Devens squared off with
his third partner in three competitions.
Devens and Patel teamed up but were
eliminated in the finals as were team
mates Yee and Billy Wright.
Gould was pleased with their perfor
mances but sees much room for improve
ment. "Rob and Vimal played reasonable
doubles and there are a lot of areas in
which they can improve, not that they
need to in any one area," Gould noted.
"They hadn't even practiced together
and they were playing against people
who had been together for a long time."
Namely, UCIA and USC. These two
teams continue to top all the charts mid
blow out most of the competition. Howev
er, the Cardinal has come a few steps clos
er to being on par with its southern rivals.
"The rankings for the National
Indoor Championships just came out
with them at Nos. 1 and 2 and us at No.
3. A few months ago I would have
thought that that was a bit optimistic for
us," Gould said. But now, the Cardinal is
ready to upset its foes.
