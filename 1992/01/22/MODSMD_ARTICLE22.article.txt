# Walsh awes team with Midas touch
## 
### 
The subtle power of Bill
Walsh was evident as he
entered the first meeting
with his new team. Stanford
football players are big, muscu
lar people whose confidence in
public can sometimes make
them appear loud and obnox
ious. But when that white
haired 60-year-old walked into
the room, all was quiet.
It was not a strained or ner
vous time, merely a moment of
silence in reverence of the new
teacher who stood before them.
The players would say later
that you could hear a pin drop,

and that makes sense. What
could they even mutter to each
other privately that would be as
important as what this man
would soon say? Not even a
"wow" made it to the air. The
room was under his control,
and the man some call the
greatest football mind of all
time began to speak.
As 90-plus captivated young
men watched and listened,
Walsh began to talk of aggres
siveness and fun: hit them
before they are ready to be hit,
and enjoy yourself in the pro
cess. The formalities would be
few, he said. People would be
called by their first names and
players would be treated as
mature people, with the knowl
ege that they are expected to act
that way both on and off the
field. His was a new way, but
not one that would stray far
from the path of the man who
came before him. As he said in
the press conference announc
ing his hiring, Walsh told his
players that he respected what
Denny Green had done. He said
he probably could not have
done it better. Then he intro
duced Terry Shea and told the
gathering that the rest of the
staff would meet the team this
coming Monday.
It was not a long meeting,
but it had its effects. Last week
punter Paul Stonehouse was
excited about the off-season,
but now he would be just as
pleased if the 1992 season start
ed tomorrow.
"I'm so excited about playing

football again," Stonehouse
said as he nursed the knee he
injured in the Aloha Bowl. "I'm
just pumped to get back on the
field," he added.
Coming from a man who not
last week was celebrating his
new found freedom by extolling
the virtues of lying in bed,
watching movies and drinking
beer, this was big news. Sudden
ly the new Tecmo II video foot
ball game was not enough.
"I just feel a lot more relaxed
now," he said. "People were
nervous because they didn't
know what to expect, but I
think everybody is feeling pret
ty good now."
They are feeling good
because they have gotten a nib
ble of their future and it is pret
ty tasty. The biggest concern
facing the football team was
whether or not the new people
would be able to maintain the
winning attitude Green had
instilled in his players, but now
they are guided by the consum
mate winner. Creating an NFL
dynasty is no easy task, but
Walsh did it and has three
Super Bowl rings to show for
his efforts. He is more laid back
than his predecessor, yet there
is no strict formula for success,
and Walsh seems to have a
recipe that works.
Without yet having walked
on a field with the man, half
back J.J. Lasley was already
using the phrase "Midas
touch." A play had not been
run, a cut-back not yet cri
tiqued, but Lasley was not
afraid to utter the Pacific 10's
magic word: "Pasadena." The
exciting thing was that Lasley
was not ejaculating hyperbole;
he meant what he said.
The real coaching is still
months away, yet that does not
matter. Athletics are as mental
as they are physical, and foot
ball is no exception. Future
Cardinal teams will play well if
they believe they can, and with
a coach like Bill Walsh, losing is
just not factored in the equa
tion. This is why he is so power
ful.
Bill Walsh has no halo, but it
is almost as if you can see a
"No.l" flashing over his head.
Stanford players watched as
that imaginary neon sign was
built over the course of the
1980's, and now the architect
stands before them ready to
lead. Stanford listened to the
proteg6 for three years and had
success. The floor now belongs
to the mentor and the players
are excited to learn.

lar people whose confidence in
public can sometimes make
them appear loud and obnox
ious. But when that white
haired 60-year-old walked into
the room, all was quiet.
It was not a strained or ner
vous time, merely a moment of
silence in reverence of the new
teacher who stood before them.
The players would say later
that you could hear a pin drop,

and that makes sense. What
could they even mutter to each
other privately that would be as
important as what this man
would soon say? Not even a
"wow" made it to the air. The
room was under his control,
and the man some call the
greatest football mind of all
time began to speak.
As 90-plus captivated young
men watched and listened,
Walsh began to talk of aggres
siveness and fun: hit them
before they are ready to be hit,
and enjoy yourself in the pro
cess. The formalities would be
few, he said. People would be
called by their first names and
players would be treated as
mature people, with the knowl
ege that they are expected to act
that way both on and off the
field. His was a new way, but
not one that would stray far
from the path of the man who
came before him. As he said in
the press conference announc
ing his hiring, Walsh told his
players that he respected what
Denny Green had done. He said
he probably could not have
done it better. Then he intro
duced Terry Shea and told the
gathering that the rest of the
staff would meet the team this
coming Monday.
It was not a long meeting,
but it had its effects. Last week
punter Paul Stonehouse was
excited about the off-season,
but now he would be just as
pleased if the 1992 season start
ed tomorrow.
"I'm so excited about playing

football again," Stonehouse
said as he nursed the knee he
injured in the Aloha Bowl. "I'm
just pumped to get back on the
field," he added.
Coming from a man who not
last week was celebrating his
new found freedom by extolling
the virtues of lying in bed,
watching movies and drinking
beer, this was big news. Sudden
ly the new Tecmo II video foot
ball game was not enough.
"I just feel a lot more relaxed
now," he said. "People were
nervous because they didn't
know what to expect, but I
think everybody is feeling pret
ty good now."
They are feeling good
because they have gotten a nib
ble of their future and it is pret
ty tasty. The biggest concern
facing the football team was
whether or not the new people
would be able to maintain the
winning attitude Green had
instilled in his players, but now
they are guided by the consum
mate winner. Creating an NFL
dynasty is no easy task, but
Walsh did it and has three
Super Bowl rings to show for
his efforts. He is more laid back
than his predecessor, yet there
is no strict formula for success,
and Walsh seems to have a
recipe that works.
Without yet having walked
on a field with the man, half
back J.J. Lasley was already
using the phrase "Midas
touch." A play had not been
run, a cut-back not yet cri
tiqued, but Lasley was not
afraid to utter the Pacific 10's
magic word: "Pasadena." The
exciting thing was that Lasley
was not ejaculating hyperbole;
he meant what he said.
The real coaching is still
months away, yet that does not
matter. Athletics are as mental
as they are physical, and foot
ball is no exception. Future
Cardinal teams will play well if
they believe they can, and with
a coach like Bill Walsh, losing is
just not factored in the equa
tion. This is why he is so power
ful.
Bill Walsh has no halo, but it
is almost as if you can see a
"No.l" flashing over his head.
Stanford players watched as
that imaginary neon sign was
built over the course of the
1980's, and now the architect
stands before them ready to
lead. Stanford listened to the
proteg6 for three years and had
success. The floor now belongs
to the mentor and the players
are excited to learn.
