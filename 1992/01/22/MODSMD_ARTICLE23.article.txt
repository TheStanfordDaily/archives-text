## 
### Laurie Wackier Staff writer 
Last night marked the last
chance for a test drive, as Stan
ford men's volleyball entered
their final preseason match
against Cal at Burnham Pavil
lion. The Cardinal performed like
a high-performance vehicle, run
ning over California in three
games, 15-3, 15-11, 15-3.

Cardinal sweeps Bears
15-3,15-11,15-3

Cal, three time defending
national Club Champion, never
posed a threat to the composed
Cardinal. The match clearly
revealed the discrepancy between
NCAA and club-caliber pro
grams. The decisive victory indi
cated that Stanford is ready to
drive the open road.
The Cardinal took full advan
tage of that discrepancy in game
one, disposing quickly of a Cal
team that was plagued by passing
errors. The Golden Bears fell
prey to Stanford's lethal jump
serve, as well as their explosive
net attack. Junior Duncan Black
man led his squad in both
respects, recording three aces
and four kills. A flailing Cal team
called time out trailing 10-3, but
couldn't stop the impending rout.
However, the determined
Golden Bears gained some com
posure for game two, staying
with Stanford for most of the
game. Stepping up their passing
game a notch, Cal was able to
contain Stanford's vicious jump
servers. After trading serves
throughout most of the game,
Stanford downed Cal behind six
kills apiece from juniors Bob Hill
man and Dave Goss. Blackman
added five kills, rounding out an
intimidating trio at the net.
Game three mirrored game
one, with Stanford scoring many
of their points off the serve and
quickly extinguishing any Cal
hopes for a comeback.
"To score as many points as
quickly as we did is unusual in
men's volleyball, but they
weren't prepared to pass our
serves," Coach Ruben Nieves
remarked. Stanford tallied eight
aces in the short match.
Goss and senior Duncan
Blackman haunted Cal at the
net, with 12 and 13 kills, respec
tively. Goss hit an impressive
.500 on the evening.
Nieves acknowledged Goss'
performance: "Dave Goss had an
outstanding hitting match. He
has the ability and the arm swing
to hit from the back as well as the
front. It takes a special athlete to
carry that kind of hitting load."

Senior middle blocker John Hribar pounds the ball past two Bear defenders. California, the club team
national champion, was no match for the nationally ranked Cardinal. Stanford convincingly crushed its
Bay Area rival in three straight games. The Cardinal meets San Diego State Saturday for the team's first
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Association game.
