## Lucid dreaming gains credibility: It's not all in your head 
### Anna Buchmann Staff writer 
You can scale the Alps without
a rope, soar over Paris without an
airplane, swim for hours under
water without scuba gear, and
make love with the most desirable
person you can imagine, all in one
night, according to Stanford
research associate Stephen
Laßerge. There's just one catch:
it all must happen while you're
sound asleep.
In fact, said through
the phenomenon of lucid dream
ing, "Anything is possible."
"Lucid dreaming means
dreaming while knowing that
you're dreaming, so that while
you're in a dream, you know that
it's all in your mind," Laßerge
said.
Because we are always making
mental models of the world, he
said, we can characterize lucid
dreaming as a state in which we
fully simulate the world to our „
own specifications without any
input from the environment.
The potential applications of
lucid dreaming, Laßerge said,
are numerous. For instance,
"Lucid dreaming can be a kind of
psychodrama," he said. A dream
er can enact certain difficult or
dreaded circumstances without
having to worry about "offending
people or messing up."
Lucid dreaming can also be
"the poor man's Tahiti," or a
fully-simulated vacation spot.
Laberge compared lucid dreaming
to "high-resolution virtual reali
ty," only cheaper.
"People who are interested in
high-risk activities. . . can experi
ence them in dream states safe
ly," according to Laßerge. For
instance, "The only safe sex is
dream sex," he says.
"Dreaming has been a source
of new ideas in every field of
human endeavor throughout his
tory," he noted. According to
Laßerge, the difficulty of prob
lem-solving often lies in being
able to recognize a solution when
it's already in the mind. Lucid
dreaming allows the dreamer to
make unconscious solutions con
scious.
Laßerge also speculated that
lucid dreaming might one day be
useful in curing diseases. "It's

theoretically possible — and I
only say theoretical at this point
because we don't really have any
data on this — that [lucid dream
ingl could be used to facilitate
health in some ways."
He added that many diseases
have a psychosomatic component
which could be influenced by
lucid dreams, "although there are
no controlled studies in this
area."
Scientific evidence
While public response to
Laßerge's work has been "very
positive," he said, "I frankly don't
think [lucid dreamingl has made

much impact on mainstream psy
chology at all.
"It's probably my own fault,
given that my writings have been
much more in the popular area than
in the academic world," he said.
Nevertheless, Dr. William
Dement, pioneering sleep
researcher and director of the
Stanford Sleep Center called
Laßerge's research "very impor
tant" and "very respectable."
Similarly, Dr. Phillip Zimbardo,
a Stanford professor of psychology,
said that lucid dreaming is "inter
esting and promising," although
more research needs to be done by
independent investigators.
Others in the field are not so

positive. Professor William
Domhoff, professor of psycholo
gy and sociology at the Universi
ty of California at Santa Cruz,
teaches a course in dreaming.
He said, "I can't speak to the
details of (Laßerge's) work, but
in general I would guess that the
possibilities and potentialities of
lucid dreaming for solving prob
lems and improving health have
been vastly and prematurely
overrated."
Laßerge said that from the
beginning of his experiments,
"The reaction of the scientific or
sleep research community was
incredulity." Lucid dreaming, he
said, was dismissed as "day

dreams or fantasies."
The mind-body link
For more than a decade,
Laßerge has conducted experi
ments focusing both on the rela
tionship between mind and body
during lucid dreaming and on
making the state more accessible.
Laßerge earned his Ph.D. in psy
chophysiology in 1980 at Stanford,
after completing a 3-year study
which allowed him to have lucid
dreams on command. His object, he
said, was to make lucid dreaming
"objectively demonstrable."
At the time Laßerge began his
dissertation work, it had been

well-established that sleep
occurred in several cycles
throughout the night, including
alternating periods of quiet sleep
and active sleep. Furthermore,
dreams occurr almost exclusively
during the active stages of "rapid
eye movement," or REM sleep,
also characterized by paralysis of
chin muscle movement.
Laßerge's dissertation experi
ments included his first recorded
lucid dream. Along with Dr. Lynn
Nagel of the Stanford Sleep
Research Center, decid
ed to measure his eye movement
during sleep with an electro-ocu
logram, or EOG. Laßerge was to
signal his entry into a lucid dream
by moving his eyes in a regular
pattern.
On Jan. 13, 1978, Laßerge suc
ceeded in producing two clear
polygraph movements on the
EOG. Since that time, he has also
conducted experiments showing
that lucid dreamers can change
their sleeping bodies' breathing
patterns by holding their breath
or breathing rapidly during a
lucid dream.
Furthermore, by singing or
counting during lucid dreams, the
dreamer can produce brain wave
patterns consistent with waking
patterns during singing and
counting. Laßerge has also shown
that sexual activity in lucid
dreams produces physiological
changes similar to those during
"real" sex — sweating or a racing
pulse, for example.
How to have a 'dream' dream
Laßerge's experiments have
also focused on making the state
more accessible. Asking who is
capable of lucid dreaming,
Laßerge said, is like asking who is
capable of speech. Lucid dreaming
is "a learnable skill that in gener
al in our society we're not
taught."
To have a lucid dream, a per
son must first really want the
dream to occur, Laßerge said.
Then, that person must be capa
ble of remembering dreams.
"The only other factor than
motivation in determining how
frequently people report lucid
dreams is recall," he said. "The
more you recall your dreams, the


Mimi Kuo — Daily
more likely you are to realize
while you're having one, 'This is a
dream.'"
Laßerge's two books, "Lucid
Dreaming" and "Exploring the
World of Lucid Dreaming", both
contain advice to would-be lucid
dreamers on how to recognize
that they are in a lucid dream. For
instance, Laßerge suggests con
stantly questioning oneself while
awake whether or not one is
dreaming. Learning to be self
critical of the waking state of con

sciousness will, according to
Laßerge, help dreamers recognize
that they are dreaming.
He has also developed the
"Mnemonic Induction of Lucid
Dreams" (MILD), a method
designed to strengthen a person's
intention to remember that he or
she wants to have a lucid dream.
Laßerge has also designed a
device called the "Dream Light,"
which facilitates lucidity. The
Dream Light is a mask which has
sensors that detect rapid eye
movements. When REM sleep
occurs, small lights inside the
Dream Light begin to flash, and
the lights subsequently enter into
the dream. This causes the dream
er to remember that he or she had

intended to recognize the dream
when the lights began to flash.
According to Jake Becker, a
sophomore in electrical engineer
ing who has been a lucid dream
ing subject, even with the Dream-
Light, lucid dreaming still
"requires some effort." He added
that the Dream Light "isn't that
clear-cut. You have to prepare
yourself."
Becker said that depending on
the dreamer, the blinking lights
may or may not get incorporated
into the lucid dream.
Only once, Becker said, did he
"catch on" to the fact that he was
dreaming during the Dream Light
experiments, conducted during
his freshman year.

However, "Once you get start
ed . . .it gets easier to do," he
added.
Becker has also participated in
experiments of the type Laßerge
is currently conducting, which
require subjects to get up 90 min
utes earlier than usual, and then
take a 90-minute nap at the time
the he or she typically wakes up.
"We get much better results from
focusing on this short period of
time," Laßerge said.
Laßerge is optimistic, given
the current status of his research.
"I would hope that 20 years from
now we will have been able to do
enough research to make lucid
dreaming readily accessible to
anyone," he said.
