# Bug all aglow with illustrious ponderings of depilatories

A # Depilation — or the removal of body
.hair — has been in and out of fashion
through the centuries. In ancient Egypt,
both men and women removed all body
hair (yes, even down there!). Greek women
depilated their bodies, and the Romans
continued the fashion. And in the Ear East,
quicklime and arsenic were used for hair
removal.
The Dodingo of Uganda depilate with
resins. These resins are applied like the
wax used in Western countries. When the

resin hardens, it is pulled off, hair and all.
Complete depilation of a bride's body by
the old women of the tribe is a Dodingo pre
wedding ritual. What incentive to stay sin
gle!
Modern day chemical depilation is an
excellent example of technology transfer
between two diverse industries. The hair
removing chemicals patented in the 1940s
for cosmetic use were first used in the
leather industry to de-hair animal skins.
How's this for a new slogan: "Nair —
smoothes even the toughest hides"?
Depilatories contain two kinds of chem
icals. Thioglycollates weaken the hair pro
tein structure, and calcium hydroxide caus
es the hair to swell and break off at the
base. Calcium hydroxide is much less caus
tic than its chemical relative that gives
Draino its unclogging power.
Is Nair safe? Apparently — at least one
government regulatory agency thinks so.
You should be fine if you heed the lengthy

warning on the bottle.
Q. I want to know the secrets of my really
'.cool glow-in-the-dark poster. Why do
glow-in-the-dark objects need light to make
them glow, and why is the glowing tran
sient?
A Your glow-in-the-dark poster has a
!long and illustrious history.
In 1603, Vincenzo Cascariolo, an Italian
shoemaker, heated a heavy spar (a type of
rock) to a very high temperature. This first
"manmade" glow-in-the-dark object was
dubbed the Bolognian Stone.
Initially, there was much hope that the
stone could turn random objects into gold.
These hopes didn't pan out, but the stone
could remove hair. Unfortunately, it
smelled too foul for cosmetic use. (I know
this stuff seems bizarre, but I swear on my
forthcoming Stanford diploma that I
haven't fabricated a thing!)

Galileo showed the stone to La Galla,
who published a paper about it in 1612. In
1680, a Roman professor of astronomy
used a mix of ground Bolognian stone and
egg white to paint glow-in-the-dark pic
tures.
Many of these glowing compounds, or
phosphors, were discovered in the next few
centuries. Today they bless us with phos
phorescent toothbrushes, condoms and T
shirts.
Why do only certain chemicals possess
phosphorescent properties? Light excites a
phosphor and makes its subatomic parti
cles fly around like crazy. Some of these
particles get trapped in an excited state
that they escape from over time. Each time
one escapes, a little bit of light is emitted.
The glow we see is the cumulative result of
many tiny light flashes.
Phosphorescent objects need light expo-

sure to glow, but some radioac
tive substances glow all on their
own — a process called radiolumi
nescence. Some of you may recall
old watches with glowing faces.
Watch faces were painted with
radium until they discovered that
watch painters were a sickly

bunch.
Chemiluminescent substances
are nonradioactive and glow
without light input. The most
famous is the element phospho
rus, which was first purified from
urine. It's not practical to use
phosphorus for glow-in-the-dark
objects because it is explosive. In
1697, a doctor rubbed a col
league's face with phosphorus to
demonstrate the glow and set the
poor man's face afire.
