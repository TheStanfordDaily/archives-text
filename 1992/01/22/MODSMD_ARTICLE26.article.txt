# Highlights of the Macintosh carnival

### Andrew Neuschatz 
Where can you see a man dressed as a
chicken handing out leaflets for his software
company while vying with a moose for atten
tion? Certainly not at any run-of-the-mill
computer trade show. But last week's Mac
world Exposition at San Francisco's Moscone
Center was no ordinary trade show.
It was a circus for grownups.
As always, many of the flashiest products
inside the cavernous hall were well beyond a
student's budget. There was, however, also a
selction of items students might find both
useful and affordable.
This year's big theme was clearly multime
dia. In almost every booth, there was software
that moved. The main attraction was the
unveiling of Apple's QuickTime, an extension
of the operating system that allows Macin
toshes to handle movies and sounds in the
same way they handle text and still pictures.
The examples were dramatic. In the Quick-
Time display hall, an Apple employee shot a
quick movie with a video camera, then used
the mouse to cut and paste it into a picture.
Click on the filmstrip icon, and the movie
comes to life. Click on the icon in an article
about a machine, and a diagram animates to
show its movement. Click next to a page
about paleontology, and a drawing of a set of
bones assembles into a dinosaur skeleton.
Apple is betting that if a picture is worth a
thousand words, a movie is worth a million.
In the 21st century, letters to grandma
should be as slick as television commercials.
With the QuickTime extension (available
for $10 from Apple, but free with most pro
grams that use it), movies and sounds can be
made, saved, cut, pasted and mailed like any
thing else the Mac handles. Of course, docu
ments with movies can't be put on paper.
But nobody at this show reads from paper
anymore; that would be as old-fashioned as
getting news from a newspaper.
The hall included demonstrations of
many products that use QuickTime, includ
ing word processors, HyperCard, presenta-

tion makers, scientific visualization software
and plenty more. Not surprisingly, most of
this brand-new technology is expensive, but
for those interested in joining this revolution
early, the cheapest way is probably through
Macro Mind's Magic program.
Magic makes creating animation as easy as
drawing pictures. In no time, the Magic
demonstrator put together a film of a globe
that spun as it slid over a flat map and a mar
ble-like background. Movement is dia
grammed using the same lines and shapes
from programs like Mac Draw. Magic will run
on any Macintosh from a Mac Plus up and lists
for $395, though it sold for $199 at the show.
Apple's new Powerbook portables already
look like a huge success; people swarmed
around every booth that displayed them.
The Powerbooks are the size of a short stack
of paper and include a full keyboard and con
veniently-placed trackball.
But before you rush out to place your
order, take a look at the compatible porta
bles made by Outbound. Although similar in
shape, function and price (student/educator
discounts are available), the Outbound
portables are much more modular. When
you're ready to upgrade your system, you
can unplug the old CPU, hard drive or mem
ory, and plug the new one in. Because power
comes from standard camcorder battery
packs, you can recharge one battery while
you're using another.
Maxen introduced the Freedom 120/240,
the first battery-powered hard disk drive for
portable Macs. Its self-contained design
means less drain on the Mac's battery, which
means longer time between recharges. For
those with money to burn, Maxen also puts
out a $6,000 custom portable Mac Ilci with a
flat color screen. Sculpted by Nissan Design,
it looks as fast as a sports car.
If your funds are more limited, you may
be interested in AutoDoubler, by Palo Alto's
own Salient Software. Once installed, it con
stantly scans for programs over a specified
age and compresses them whenever your
Mac is idle. On average, it saves half your

disk space.
Best of all, decompression is never neces
sary: Compressed files can be opened with
the regular double-click, just taking a few
extra seconds to start up. The AutoDoubler
box sums it up: "Automatically double your
disk space without the wait. Just install.
That's all." The $79 price isn't much to pay
to avoid buying a larger hard disk.
If telling your professor that the comput
er destroyed your 20-page paper feels a little
like saying your dog ate it, Auto Save II from
Magic Software will be worth far more than
its modest $18 price. Auto Save automatical
ly saves your work every few minutes, at
intervals you specify. Next time the machine
crashes, you'll only lose a few minutes'
worth of writing.
Prescience Corporation demonstrated
Expressionist, an impressive tool that does
for mathematical expressions what a word
processor does for paragraphs, automatical
ly formatting expressions with subscripts,
fractions, even square-root signs wrapped
around integrals wrapped around Greek let
ters. The result: equations as neat (and
frightening) as physics texts, which can then
be cut and pasted into text documents. The
interface is so straightforward that with a
few minutes' practice, expressions are easier
to enter than to try to say out loud.
Version 2.0.7 is available now for $129.
Version 3.0, to be released this spring at
$199, will be more customizable and allow
editing of expressions already pasted into
documents.
When you decide that your simple Macin
tosh SE is no longer enough, you don't have to
get rid of it to move up. Mobius Systems offers
a 68030 upgrade that includes both a large,
full-page display and a fast 25 MHz 68030 pro
cessor. The resulting system runs neck-and
neck with a Mac Ilci. The $895 student/educa
tor price isn't much to pay for performance
comparable to that of a $4,000 machine.
And finally, for the Mac enthusiast with
everything, Psychic Lab is offering a Macin
tosh-compatible brainwave reader.
