Kryptonite cutter caught
A transient suspected of stealing 27 bikes from
the Stanford campus in one week was caught in
the act Saturday afternoon by Stanford Police.
Hector Hernandez, 20, was apprehended while
using wire cutters to sever a cable lock on a bike
parked near Crothers Hall. Three students report
ed the theft in progress to the police, who arrested
the perpetrator at the scene.
Hernandez admitted that he had also been on cam
pus during the week of Jan. 10-17, when a total of 27
bikes disappeared. None of them have been recovered.
"The bikes were taken from all over the place,"
said Capt. Raoul Niemeyer of the Stanford Police.
Most of the bikes had been left unlocked, locked to
themselves or cabled. The thief also "defeated"
some U-locks, Niemeyer said.
Hernandez was arrested and taken to the

Santa Clara County Jail, but released Saturday
night due to overcrowding. The Stanford Police
have issued a warrant for his arrest.
"We don't know whether we'll ever see him
again," Niemeyer said.

to command respect."
