# Athletics' No. 2 man is out
## Cummings, once acting director, is victim of cuts 
### 
Budget cuts have wiped out the second
highest post in the Department of Athlet
ics, leaving Alan Cummings with only a few
days left on the job.
"Having dealt with budget issues for as
long as I have, I know there are some tough
decisions that have to be made," said Cum
mings, the senior associate director of ath
letics. "I'm a casualty of an attempt to
bring the budget into equilibrium."
Cummings, who served briefly as acting
director of the department before the
appointment of current director Ted
Leland, has worked for Stanford in various
capacities for the last 26 years. He first
entered the Athletic Department in 1980,
where he has since held a number of posi
tions.
Leland, who was responsible for making
the decision on Cummings, was not avail
able for comment yesterday.
On Jan. 6, Leland told Cummings that his
position would be eliminated "for budgetary
reasons," according to Cummings. Cum
mings' principle responsibilities are the man
agement of athletic facilities, the golf course
and several sports services, such as sports
medicine.

Bob Vasquez said it was his
understanding that "Cum
mings' position will not be
filled by anyone else, and
his responsibilities will be
divided among other peo
ple in the department."
"As to who does what, I
don't know," Vasquez said.
There were three asso
ciate directors of athletics

in addition to Cummings.
The Athletics department must cut
$700,000, or 19.3 percent, from their bud
get as part of the plan to eliminate Stan
ford's $43 million budget shortfall.
Cummings said he hasn't yet made
plans for the future. "I'm going to be basi
cally finishing up my responsibilities in the
next few days," he said. "In February, I'll
plan what my next career will be."
Although he was aware of the possibility
of layoffs, Cummings said he was given no
reason to suspect his position would be
eliminated.
"I've worked at Stanford for over two
decades, and I'm disappointed that my
career here will end on this note," Cum
mings said. "My commitment has always
been to building a broad-based athletic pro
gram, and the success of the program has
been very rewarding."
