Several arrests and one fatal heart attack marred
Sunday's East-West Shrine Game at Stanford Sta
dium.
"We had a really rough game," said Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer of the Stanford Police, which provided
security for the annual event.
A total of 15 fans were arrested for public drunk
enness and fighting. According to Niemeyer, "Most
of them were young adults and juveniles." None of
those arrested were Stanford students.
Niemeyer blamed the general unruliness not on
the Shriners, but on the "random people from all
over the Bay Area" who came to cheer on the
nation's top college football players.
Although alcohol is not permitted inside the sta

dium, most of the disturbances were alcohol-related.
"They were getting it in somehow," Niemeyer
said. "We try to monitor people going in, but these
people were secreting it on their bodies. We don't do
body searches."
In addition to the arrests, one elderly man in the
crowd died of heart failure during the game. Anoth
er suffered a heart attack and had to be revived by
paramedics.
Despite these incidents, the University will con
tinue to sponsor the game, which has been held here
since 1975.
"The game is a wonderful event and we are proud
to be associated with the Shrine," said Tom Beckett,
associate director of the Department of Athletics.
"Whenever you get 8,300 people together in one
place you're going to have some kind of distur
bance," he added.
