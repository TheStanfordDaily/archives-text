# Some music programs slated to be eliminated
## Doctoral track, student ensembles will be cut 
### Julia Sobrevilla Staff writer 
The Doctor of Musical Arts program and
various student ensembles will no longer exist
at Stanford as a result of budget cuts, accord
ing to music department chair Karol Berger.
The decision was announced by School
of Humanities and Sciences Assoc. Dean
Carolyn Lougee in a meeting yesterday
with Music Department faculty and admin
istrators.
The dissolution of both the music doctor
al program and the ensembles is part of
Humanities and Sciences' plan to cut $5 mil
lion from their $60 million operating budget.
Lougee was unavailable for comment
last night.
The student ensembles that will disap
pear are the baroque orchestra, the Renais
sance winds and the percussion ensemble.
"The disappearance of the (doctoral)
program does not mean that performing
arts will disappear," Berger said. "It is
absolutely central that the music depart
ment continues to offer high-quality per
formance. "
The Doctor of Musical Arts program com
bines theory and practical arts. Students
may pursue the degree in two concentrations

— composition or performance practice.
Doctoral student Mike Rosewall said
two-thirds of about 35 graduate students in
music are in the performance program.
Performance is a central part of this pro
gram, along with scholarship. Programs
such as the doctorate in musicology, which
stresses theory, have not been cut from the
curriculum.
"We are against (the Doctor of Music
Arts) being cut because we feel it is a
unique program . . . that puts together per
forming arts and theory," Rosewall said.
"I don't know why they cut the (pro
gram), but our department chair being a
musicologist himself might have influenced
the decision of the deans," Rosewall said.
Rosewall said the doctoral candidates
are often teaching assistants in many class
es and are a valuable part of the program
for undergraduates.
"We have been told by some faculty that
the (doctoral program) is a dinosaur,"
Rosewall said. "That is how we feel — that
we are about to become extinct."
Berger, however, said he believes the
effect of the program's disappearance will
be minimal.
"I think we will be able to
maintain all the activities success
fully," Berger said. "The events
led by the DMA students will be
taken over by other students.
"The program will be phased
out gradually and the actual stu
dents will go on until they finish
their program," Berger said.
Although several ensembles are
being dissolved, the Stanford Band
will receive University funds,
according to Dr. William Ramsey,
a music department professor.
