# STEP students push for changes
## Administrators revise program after complaints roll in 
### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
Classes for the past six months have
just been far too easy, some students in
the Stanford Teacher Education Project
said last quarter. So they challenged
their administrators and professors to
modify the program to meet their needs.
"We felt like everything was very
watered-down," said STEP student
Gaby Banks. "We were supposed to be
master's students, but we weren't treat
ed that way."
STEP is a one-year program in which
students obtain a master's degree in
education and a California state teach
ing credential through both student
teaching in local schools and classroom
study of educational theory and practice.
"Students are continually involved in
both practice and theory," said Grace
Grant, director of the STEP program.
"We try to help them bridge the gap
between the two and integrate them in
their teaching."
But near the end of last quarter, stu

dents in the program began to voice dis
satisfaction with what was being asked
of them.
According to Grant, the frustration
centered around "Secondary School
Teaching Practicum," a one-year course
that she described as a "very practical
class that involves the students teaching
in their school."
The main assignment for the class
was a journal in which students reflect
ed on their experiences in teaching and
tried to apply educational theory to
what happened in their classrooms.
Banks said she thinks this type of
reflective assignment encouraged shal
low writing and said she wanted to take
a more critical, theoretical approach to
the subject.
In addition, cooperative planning
that would allow the development of
interdisciplinary lessons with other
STEP teachers hadn't been incorporat
ed into the program, Banks said.
A final flaw, she said, was the absence
of a class for students who wanted to
teach English as a second language.

According to Banks and other stu
dents, Grant responded very well to a
flood of complaints.
"I'm impressed with how responsive
STEP has been to an incredibly vocal
group," Banks said. "They handled it
really well."
"Critical analysis has always been
one of the values we promote in this pro
gram," Grant said. "Perhaps we didn't
make this as clear as we might have."
She said that some new assignments
have been made in the class this quarter
in response to the students.
"We haven't changed the basic tenets
of what we do," Grant said. "We've
refined a system that was already work
ing well."
Grant said the program also respond
ed positively to the student's requests to
do cooperative planning because it now
permits them to design interdisciplinary
curricula, which she said is becoming an
increasingly important method of teach
ing on the local and state level.
Similarly, a pilot program in
teaching English as a second lan
guage was implemented in STEP,
largely because students showed
interest and "raised issues until it
gained momentum and a response
was made," said Jennifer Jue,
special programs coordinator for
STEP.
Banks said she felt it was very
important that students continue
to work toward improving the
program.
"It's frustrating because
there's no continuity from year to
year," Banks said. "It's a one-year
program, and the program has
made the changes that last year's
students wanted, but they're not
around to see them. The same is
true for us."
Some students, however,
didn't find many problems with
the program. Mike Pease, a STEP

student, said the program went
well for him, although it was
"obvious that half the class was
really upset."
Pease said he was satisfied
with the program because he
spent a lot of time on the class
work for STEP.
The students who were upset
"didn't put in the time they would
need to get something out of the
program," he said.
Pease also added that he
thought a lack of understanding
between students and professors
over the class requirements only
increased the problems.
"Some people have said you get
what you put in to the program,"
said STEP student Nicky Ramos.
"I say, if it's not worth my time, I
won't do it.
"As teachers, our time is valu
able. We have to grade papers and
plan classes. When we're asked to
do busywork, it's annoying and
frustrating, and I don't do it."
Despite the discussion and con
troversy, all of the students inter

time is valuable.

trating.'

viewed said they thought admin
istrators had responded well to
the interests and needs of the stu
dents.
Kathy Saito, another STEP
student, said she thought the
changes had definitely improved
the program.
"I'm not used to challenging
things," Saito said. "I may not
have liked the way the program
was going, but I wouldn't have
done anything.
"The changes have made the
program more enjoyable," she
said. "I felt like the administra
tion does care."

A final flaw, she said, was the absence
of a class for students who wanted to
teach English as a second language.

According to Banks and other stu
dents, Grant responded very well to a
flood of complaints.
"I'm impressed with how responsive
STEP has been to an incredibly vocal
group," Banks said. "They handled it
really well."
"Critical analysis has always been
one of the values we promote in this pro
gram," Grant said. "Perhaps we didn't
make this as clear as we might have."
She said that some new assignments
have been made in the class this quarter
in response to the students.
"We haven't changed the basic tenets
of what we do," Grant said. "We've
refined a system that was already work
ing well."
Grant said the program also respond
ed positively to the student's requests to
do cooperative planning because it now
permits them to design interdisciplinary
curricula, which she said is becoming an
increasingly important method of teach
ing on the local and state level.
Similarly, a pilot program in
teaching English as a second lan
guage was implemented in STEP,
largely because students showed
interest and "raised issues until it
gained momentum and a response
was made," said Jennifer Jue,
special programs coordinator for
STEP.
Banks said she felt it was very
important that students continue
to work toward improving the
program.
"It's frustrating because
there's no continuity from year to
year," Banks said. "It's a one-year
program, and the program has
made the changes that last year's
students wanted, but they're not
around to see them. The same is
true for us."
Some students, however,
didn't find many problems with
the program. Mike Pease, a STEP

student, said the program went
well for him, although it was
"obvious that half the class was
really upset."
Pease said he was satisfied
with the program because he
spent a lot of time on the class
work for STEP.
The students who were upset
"didn't put in the time they would
need to get something out of the
program," he said.
Pease also added that he
thought a lack of understanding
between students and professors
over the class requirements only
increased the problems.
"Some people have said you get
what you put in to the program,"
said STEP student Nicky Ramos.
"I say, if it's not worth my time, I
won't do it.
"As teachers, our time is valu
able. We have to grade papers and
plan classes. When we're asked to
do busywork, it's annoying and
frustrating, and I don't do it."
Despite the discussion and con
troversy, all of the students inter

trating.'

viewed said they thought admin
istrators had responded well to
the interests and needs of the stu
dents.
Kathy Saito, another STEP
student, said she thought the
changes had definitely improved
the program.
"I'm not used to challenging
things," Saito said. "I may not
have liked the way the program
was going, but I wouldn't have
done anything.
"The changes have made the
program more enjoyable," she
said. "I felt like the administra
tion does care."
Classes for the past six months have
just been far too easy, some students in
the Stanford Teacher Education Project
said last quarter. So they challenged
their administrators and professors to
modify the program to meet their needs.
"We felt like everything was very
watered-down," said STEP student
Gaby Banks. "We were supposed to be
master's students, but we weren't treat
ed that way."
STEP is a one-year program in which
students obtain a master's degree in
education and a California state teach
ing credential through both student
teaching in local schools and classroom
study of educational theory and practice.
"Students are continually involved in
both practice and theory," said Grace
Grant, director of the STEP program.
"We try to help them bridge the gap
between the two and integrate them in
their teaching."
But near the end of last quarter, stu

dents in the program began to voice dis
satisfaction with what was being asked
of them.
According to Grant, the frustration
centered around "Secondary School
Teaching Practicum," a one-year course
that she described as a "very practical
class that involves the students teaching
in their school."
The main assignment for the class
was a journal in which students reflect
ed on their experiences in teaching and
tried to apply educational theory to
what happened in their classrooms.
Banks said she thinks this type of
reflective assignment encouraged shal
low writing and said she wanted to take
a more critical, theoretical approach to
the subject.
In addition, cooperative planning
that would allow the development of
interdisciplinary lessons with other
STEP teachers hadn't been incorporat
ed into the program, Banks said.
A final flaw, she said, was the absence
of a class for students who wanted to
teach English as a second language.
