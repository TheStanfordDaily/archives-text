# Designing an award-winning future
## Engineering students win contest honors 
### Sara Skinner 
A hands-on class turned
into money and recognition for
18 graduate students who won
nine of 12 awards — including
all the Gold, Silver and Bronze
prizes — in a program recog
nizing achievement in engi
neering design.
Teams of students from a
Stanford mechanical engineer
ing design class dominated the
winners list for the 1990-91 Pre-
Professional Awards Program
sponsored by the James F. Lin
coln Arc Welding Foundation.
The foundation has offered
the contest for the past 55
years. Stanford has won "at
least half the awards" since
first entering in 1979, accord
ing to teaching assistant Mike
Strange. This year is "proba
bly the best Stanford has ever
done," he said.
The projects were a part of
Prof. Larry Leifer's mechani
cal engineering 210 class in
Graduate Design.
