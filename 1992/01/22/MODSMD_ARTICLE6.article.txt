# Designing an award-winning future
## Engineering students win contest honors 
### Sara Skinner 
A hands-on class turned
into money and recognition for
18 graduate students who won
nine of 12 awards — including
all the Gold, Silver and Bronze
prizes — in a program recog
nizing achievement in engi
neering design.
Teams of students from a
Stanford mechanical engineer
ing design class dominated the
winners list for the 1990-91 Pre-
Professional Awards Program
sponsored by the James F. Lin
coln Arc Welding Foundation.
The foundation has offered
the contest for the past 55
years. Stanford has won "at
least half the awards" since
first entering in 1979, accord
ing to teaching assistant Mike
Strange. This year is "proba
bly the best Stanford has ever
done," he said.
The projects were a part of
Prof. Larry Leifer's mechani
cal engineering 210 class in
Graduate Design.

Rafay Khan was one of 18 graduate students who recently won awards in a program
recognizing achievement in engineering design. He and Dan Wallace won a silver
award for a steering system they designed for Ford Motor Co.
Students Greg Twiss and
Gregg Patterson won the $1,000
Gold award for a rivet button
measurement system designed
for Boeing Corp. Twiss, who is
preparing to earn his Ph. Din
mechanical design, said the device
will be used by inspectors to find
weak spots in airplane joints.
Previously, he said, the mea
surement system only told
whether the joint was good or
bad. Twiss and Patterson created
a portable pack that stores infor
mation on both the height and
diameter of the rivets. This infor
mation can later be down-loaded
into a computer and used to plot
data on the joints.
Silver Awards went to Darren
Bonnstetter and Carol Smallwood
for a walking rehabilitation device
for the Veteran's Administration,
and to Rafay Khan and Dan Wal
lace for a steering system for Ford
Motor Co.
Smallwood, who now works for
Hewlett-Packard, said the walk
ing device uses a design similar to
a climber's harness to catch
patients if they fall, and the angle
of the device can be changed to

help patients stand straighter as
rehabilitation progresses.
The device is designed for
adults who are learning to walk
again after hip surgery, a stroke
or other illness. Smallwood said
they chose the project "because it
was dealing with humans."
The big advantage to their
device is that it is mobile, Small
wood said. Other rehabilitation
techniques, such as hydrothera
py, require the patient to be in the
water or walk in circles around a
machine such as the Rehabot,
which has a "dehumanizing"
effect, Smallwood said.
Smallwood and Bonnstetter's
device has the added advantage of
being more affordable than the
Rehabot, with the prototype cost
ing about $1,300.
Khan and Wallace's project
focused on producing lower-cost
alternatives as well. Electric four
wheel steering systems are
already used for big cars, Khan
said, but they are too expensive
for a compact car. "Ours was
purely hydraulic, so it was cheap
er," he said.
Khan, who will receive his
master's in mechanical engineer
ing in June, said Ford is interest
ed in four-wheel steering because
it is "easier for parking and it
improves safety and stability of

the car at high speeds." He said
that "if you go into a skid, it pro
vides more traction."
Several other students won
Bronze and Merit awards.
The contest which has spon
soring corporations, which
including Apple, McDonnell Dou
glas Corp., Lockheed and others,
pose a design problem to the stu
dents, who rank their preference
of projects.
"The problem is a pertinent
design problem they have, and
they are giving students a crack at
it," Twiss said.
The students work in teams of
two or three people coached by a
graduate student or industry vol
unteer.
"One thing that's gratifying
about Prof. Leifer's class is that
you can take an idea, conceptual
ize it, and finally come up with a
working product," Twiss said.
In addition to the prizes won
by students, Stanford was award
ed $2,250, which, according to
administrative assistant Kristin
Anderson, will go back into the
program for "lab upkeep or new
computers or something to bene
fit the class."
Twiss said he'd "like to say I
used [the prize money] for altruis
tic purposes, but if the truth be
known I bought a CD player."
