# R2ISC: Leading the charge of drug education
## 
### Kim McCreery Staff writer 
Project R a ISC — Risk Reduction of Intoxicants
in the Stanford Community — is the driving force
behind drug education at Stanford.
Project R 2 ISC conducts alcohol training work
shops for student leaders and social chairs of
dorms, houses and other organizations on mini
mizing risks when planning events. The project is
also working to increase the number of alcohol-free
events on campus, conducting merchant education
programs and initiating a "safe ride" campaign.
The program's main targets are Greek organi
zations and freshmen. Stuart Kiner, a R 2 ISC
coordinator, said he hopes to work closely with
Greek party organizers in producing safer party
environments, since most alcohol-related parties
are held by fraternities.
Recently, Stanford also received a $400,000
grant from the California State Office of Traffic
Safety to begin a pilot program called Stanford
Community Responsible Hospitality Project. The
grant is the first of its kind at a university, and
the program will be used as a model for universi-

ties across the nation.
The funds will be used to conduct workshops
for party hosts, to manage an alcohol education
conference for other California colleges and to
provide various educational aides, such as a pack
aged training video, which will be distributed to
other universities.
Kiner heads the subdivision of R 2 ISC that
brings student-performed skits to dorms. The
skits stop in the middle so a facilitator can discuss
possible endings with the residents.
"We'll show a couple driving home after a
party, and then there's an accident. Who's
responsible? If they have sex and she gets preg
nant, who's at fault?
"Their own values really come up and you can
see how passionately people really care about these
issues," he said. "Its exciting communication."
Kiner has also established a newsletter that
lists discount printers, transportation facilities
and entertainers, as well as non-alcoholic drink
recipes, workshop information and general infor
mation.
R 2 ISC is also offering prizes worth $500 to the
sponsors of the best campuswide non-alcoholic party.
