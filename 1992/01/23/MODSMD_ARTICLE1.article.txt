# Staff advisory group gets its first members

Twenty-five employees from all walks of Stanford
life have been appointed to the new Employee
Roundtable, a permanent group that will provide
the University with staff input on health benefits
and other issues.
"This is the first time Stanford employees have had
a way to get their voices heard," said Glenn Peacock,
spokesman for Stanford Employees for Equity, the
faculty and staff coalition that formed last November
to protest the controversial change in health benefits.
Members of the new Roundtable also expressed
excitement at the development. Andrew Lisac, dean
of continuing studies and summer session and a
member of the Roundtable, described the new group
as a "very good first step" for Human Resources,
which coordinated the group.
According to Jeremy Warren, human resources
program manager, "(Roundtable members] will be
able to give feedback and council to Human
Resources, and raise questions and issues."
The Roundtable, Warren said, is aimed at assist
ing Human Resources not just by providing feed
back, but also by shaping the office's goals.
"They will be giving us input on questions such as
employee appreciation days and Stanford's employ
ee environment," he said.
However, Warren added that the group will make
recommendations, not decisions. Peacock described
this as one of the major flaws of the new Roundtable.
"The real problem is the committee's advisory
nature," Peacock said. "It doesn't have true power
or authority or decision-making ability."
Lisac agreed, but acknowledged that the
Roundtable does "start the process" toward more
input.
Warren explained that the idea for the group
came out of faculty and staff concern over health
benefits. Last quarter, officials lowered monthly
rates of health insurance plans for married employ
ees, while raising rates for single employees, who
previously paid nothing.
The change was explained as a means of reducing
the costs of health benefits for the University. Accord
ing to officials, it would eliminate overlap for some
employees who were doubly enrolled under their
spouse's insurance and also would foster competition
among the carriers who offered plans to employees.
The controversy that ensued centered around the
claim that the University was
unfairly favoring one lifestyle
over others.
In dealing with this issue, War
ren's office came to the realiza
tion that "staff members do not
have enough voice" and "we need
to involve them more," he said.
The group will hold its first meet
ing next Wednesday and will meet a
total of six times each year. Mem

bers will serve two-year terms, with
50 percent turnover every year.
Warren will chair and facilitate the
meetings, and Vice President for
Human Resources Barbara Butter
field will also attend.
Although members were select
ed to represent different areas, they
speak for themselves and "do not
represent any group," Warren said.
In selecting the new members
from around 70 nominations,
Warren said the University tried
to represent a spectrum of ethnic
groups as well as different vice
presidential and dean's areas.

Members were also chosen to rep
resent single, two and three-party
health programs.
Warren said the meetings will
be closed to the press, adding that
he does not think it would not be
a good idea to have others
involved when the group is going
through the beginning stages of
development.
"We will talk to members on
when and how often the press
should be involved," he said. "We
want to use the Roundtable as a
vehicle not only to get but to dis
seminate information."
