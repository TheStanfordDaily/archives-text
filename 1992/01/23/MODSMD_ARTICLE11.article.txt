No democracy for Hong Kong
HONG KONG (AP) — For the first time in 150
years of British colonial rule, Hong Kong legislators
asked yesterday that the colony's citizens be given
some say in the selection of their next governor.
After a spirited two-hour debate, however, leg
islators rejected by one vote, 23-22, a proposal by
liberals demanding that the new governor
promise to establish a democratic political sys
tem.
On Dec. 31, the British government announced
the retirement of Hong Kong Governor Sir David
Wilson without saying when he would be replaced
or who would succeed him.
Legislators blasted Britain's handling of the
announcement and raised questions about who
will govern the bustling capitalist enclave of 5.9
million people before the colony reverts to Com
munist Chinese rule in 1997.
Fire safety bill proposed
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Two lawmakers have
introduced bills to provide state tax relief in the
fire-ravaged Oakland Hills, toughen fire safety
standards for wood roofs and extend home clear
ance rules to more of arid California.
Under one of the bills unveiled yesterday, wood
shake roofs would be allowed on new construction
only if the manufacturer offers a lifetime warran
ty on the fire retardant treatment. Current state

law and some local ordinances require some level
of fire resistant treatment.
Wood shingle roofs have long been criticized by
firefighters as flammable, despite treatments, but
industry representatives say that shakes do not
burn readily if pressure treated with fire retar
dant chemicals. Several lawmakers have tried and
failed to ban shake roofs outright.
Abortion activists rally at Capitol
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Both sides in the bat
tle over abortion rights agree on at least one
thing: The U.S. Supreme Court likely will dis
mantle the 1973 landmark ruling that legalized
abortions.
Yesterday, the 19th anniversary of the court's
Roe vs. Wade decision, anti-abortion and pro
choice forces converged on the state Capitol for a
series of rallies and news conferences targeting
abortion. The events were among several abor
tion-related rallies throughout the country,
including a demonstration that drew 70,000 peo
ple in Washington, D.C.
"I think we can expect them (the justices) to
have a decision, probably by July," said Planned
Parenthood chairman Kenneth Edelin.
The Supreme Court's decision Tuesday to
review a Pennsylvania law requiring spousal con
sent, a 24-hour delay and public-disclosure records
signals a change in Roe vs. Wade may be coming, he
added.
