Walsh's big salary may
be blessing in disguise
for Stanford athletics

Bill walsh is coming
to Stanford — with a price
tag of at least $350,000. For
a man with three Super Bowl
wins under his belt and NFL
Coach of the Year on his resume,
the price is a bargain by market
standards.
Yet having the football coach as
the highest-paid person at Stan
ford makes some people uneasy.
They feel that because Stanford is
an institution for academic
inquiry, it sends the wrong mes
sage to pay a football coach more
than the president or other promi
nent academicians.
This criticism is founded on the
principle that money is an absolute
indicator of personal value. This,
of course, is untrue. Some of the
most worthy people have earned
little or no money while providing
society its most critical leadership.
Mother Teresa and Mahatma
Ghandi provide extreme examples
of this point.
Walsh's salary, then, is not an
indicator of worth and must
instead be analyzed solely from a
cost-benefit perspective. His salary
may seem exorbitant in the wake
of the current budget crisis, but
critics must remember that Walsh
will greatly enhance Stanford foot
ball's earning potential.
It is well known that the facili
ties for non-varsity athletes on this
campus are inadequate. Many stu
dents come to Stanford having
illustrious high school athletic
careers behind them, but at Stan
ford they may not be good enough
to participate at the varsity level or
may simply choose not to. This
does not mean that these students
are no longer athletes and do not
need facilities.
Furthermore, many students
want to participate in athletics

seriously, but below the varsity
level. Club sports provide the ideal
level of competition for such peo
ple, but this program has been
tossed around as a likely sacrificial
lamb in the budget-cutting pro
cess.
Acquiring Walsh would not be
worth the decay of our athletic
facilities, nor would it be worth the
abolition of club sports. The trade
off is not that simple, though. It
seems probable that Walsh will not
only cover his cost to the Universi
ty but will actually generate
money for the Athletics depart
ment, reducing the need for Uni
versity subsidies.
The phone has been ringing off
the hook at the season ticket office
ever since the University
announced that Walsh would guide
the Cardinal next year. Additional
ly, it is reasonable to assume that
Stanford will become a more mar
ketable team with Walsh at the
helm.
Walsh's name recognition could
put Stanford on the map for East
Coast fans who wouldn't have oth
erwise known the difference
between a Cardinal and a Trojan.
With increased recognition comes
increased apparel sales as well as
more television appearances and,
ultimately, increased profit for
Stanford. With this money, Stan
ford could save important athletic
programs like club sports as well
as improve general athletic facili
ties.
Of course, Stanford shouldn't
be spending its new-found money
just yet; but it does seem to be a
safe bet that Walsh will generate at
least as much money as Denny
Green would have — and the Ath
letics department was ready to
write Green a $350,000 check for
his services.
Walsh will attract top football
talent to Stanford, he is enthusias
tic about teaching and it appears
that acquiring Walsh will not com
promise Stanford's financial posi
tion.
What more could one ask from a
coach?
