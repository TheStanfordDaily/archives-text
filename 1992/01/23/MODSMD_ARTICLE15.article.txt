Kennedy, Gaither ought to admit blatant wrongdoings

Reference is made to the
statement of University President
Donald Kennedy and Trustee
President James Gaither regarding the
indirect-cost issue in the November-
December 1991 issue of the Observer.
Over the past year, we have learned
that Stanford has, through the use of
creative accounting practices, received
from the federal government millions of
dollars to which it is not entitled. In the
honorable tradition of great leaders,
Kennedy fell on his sword. Well, almost.
In July, he resigned, effective one year
later, and stated his intention to remain
at Stanford as a tenured faculty member
thereafter.
In the various statements of Kennedy
since this became known, he protests the

unfairness of critical outside attention,
tells of pain and uncertainty and
declares that the problem is merely one
of perception.
Now comes the Kennedy-Gaither
statement describing the massive effort
being undertaken to revamp the account
ing system, complaining about the scruti
ny now being directed by the government
toward "memoranda of understanding"
between Stanford and the government,
protesting the arbitrary reduction of the
reimbursement rate and proclaiming
that as a matter of principle, Stanford
must now stand up to this unfair treat
ment at the hands of the government.
Such whining is most unseemly.
Having been screwed out of millions
of dollars, the federal government now

plays hardball with Stanford. As a tax
payer, I welcome this attitude on the
part of the government.
As a member of the Stanford family, I
am embarrassed and outraged by the
conduct of those acting on behalf of the
University. We now hear from Kennedy
and the trustees bold statements of com
mitment to principle and high standards
and the moral duty to stand up to high
handed government.
The Board of Trustees and the Presi
dent appear to be incapable of objectivi
ty. As makers and executers of policy for
the University, they bear responsibility
for this mess and its potential to cost
Stanford tens of millions of dollars.
There exists an irreconcilable conflict
of interest between the President and

the board on the one hand and the Uni
versity on the other. They should imme
diately remove themselves from any fur
ther involvement in this matter, prefer
ably by resigning effectively immediate
ly. The interests of the University can
properly be served only by those who
have unfettered objectivity and are not
impeded by direct or indirect involve
ment in or responsibility for the events
leading up to the problem.
Finally, Kennedy and the Board of
Trustees should publicly acknowledge
their responsibility for the situation,
without qualification, reserve or excuse.
The offices of President and Trustee are
not without accountability.
