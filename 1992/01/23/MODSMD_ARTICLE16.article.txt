# Extreme limits called for on fliers, banners in ASSU campaining
## 
### 
I applaud your suggestions to the
ASSU to limit spending and flyer use for
ASSU candidates. However, I believe that
any rational proposal would go much far
ther than limiting flyers to 300. There is
no reason elections at a university such
as Stanford should produce such a vast
amount of waste. Furthermore, why
should Stanford try to mimic the mock
ery of national elections, in which the
number of times a name and face are
seen is a major factor in the outcome?
Why not limit flyers to three or four
designated "Campaign Information Cen
ters" on campus where all the candidates
could put up one flyer, or possibly one 10
page packet of information which would
state their goals and purposes in running
for office. This way, all students who are
actually interested in the candidates' plat
forms could be informed of their positions.

The rest of the campus would be spared
the idiocy of hundreds of flyers which sim
ply show a candidate's cute face and a
name.
Of course, if it becomes a concern, can
didates could display a half dozen banners
(within certain size limitations), just so
our elections retain some color and an air
of festivity.
