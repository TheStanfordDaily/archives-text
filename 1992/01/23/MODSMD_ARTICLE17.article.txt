# Undeserving scholars from Hoover are now trying to gain respect
## 
### 
Is it "Show and Tell" month at the
Hoover Institution? The many discredited
scholars of that bizarre Stanford sideshow
have blown open the dikes of their collec
tive imaginations, sending forth a muddy
torrent of run-on letters in the pages of
the Daily. The letters have apparently
been motivated by Hoover's being named
the number-one think tank in the world

by that Tory rag, The Economist.
Lost in the self-congratulatory back
slapping of this Hooverspeak is the fact
that 40 percent of the points chalked up
were for being most "kooky" and
"cushy." Hoover's glee is a bit ironic
given the past slavish devotion of most
Hoover scholars to conservatism and its
handmaiden, uptightness.
By gloating over the collapse of Eastern
Europe and whining about the alleged PC
infiltration of Stanford, the Hooverites
are not-so-cleverly attempting to make
the innocent public forget they have been
wrong on eveiy public policy issue
of the past several decades. Hoover schol
ars did not predict the collapse of commu
nism; on the contrary, they waited with
baited breath for it to take over the world
so that their personal conspiracy theories
would be vindicated.
I could go on, but why waste more
space on Hoover-related pabulum?
Stanford should concentrate on more
important issues, like its crumbling ath
letic infrastructure.
