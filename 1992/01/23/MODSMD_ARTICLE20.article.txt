## It's all in the name

LIKE THE NEW NAME? These
three names belonged to my grand
parents, and they reflect my Ger
man, Byelorussian and Ukrainian, if not
my Semitic, heritage. And none of them
is Rosen. That came later.
I was thinking about names this week
end after seeing a Theatreworks produc
tion of "A Rosen by Any Other Name."
What a title.
The play is about a Jewish family —
the Rosens — living in Sault Ste. Marie,
Canada, during World War 11. The
father, Barney Rosen, owns a small
men's clothing store and, distraught over
the war in Europe, is convinced that the
Nazis will soon come to Ontario.
Sidney, the son, is about to turn 13 and
have his Bar Mitzvah. He worries over
everything, especially whether he'll have a
date to his own reception. And Pearl, the
mother who grew up in poverty, now wants
the most gauche Bar Mitzvah reception on
the block. As the centerpiece of the event,
she has commissioned a life-sized bust of
her son to be carved in chopped liver.
The tension in the play begins when
local hoodlums hurl a rock through the
window of Barney's store. He decides that
the best way to protect his family from
these anti-Semitic attacks is by changing
their name from Rosen to Royal.
The idea does not go over well with the
rest of the family. Sidney worries that his
Bar Mitzvah will become a coronation.

Pearl tells her husband that if he changes
his name to Sam Royal she'll change hers
to Pearl Protestant.
The play made me curious why my own
family changed their name. Early this cen
tury my paternal grandfather's family
came to America from Byelorus. When they
arrived at Ellis Island, their surname was
Kestrewnyekov. My father tells me that his
uncle changed the name to Rosen. But
nobody seems to know exactly when it hap
pened or why.
Was my great-uncle ashamed of his
Russian-Jewish name? Many Eastern
European Jews of that era who immi
grated to Palestine dropped their Russian
and Yiddish names in favor of new
Hebrew ones. The old names represented
to them a weak and defeated Diaspora
Judaism. These Jews, who would rebuild
a nation, gave themselves new names
befitting their new identities.
Was my uncle afraid that a name like
Kestrewnyekov would invite discrimina
tion in turn of the century America? I find
this hard to believe, given that the replace
ment he chose was hardly your prototypic
Anglo-Saxon surname. Would you believe
that the Rosen's Grocery on the corner
was run by, perhaps, a Methodist family?
Maybe he simply wanted to make his
name more American — to fit in a little
better. His Philadelphia neighbors would
find it easier to pronounce — after all,
aren't you still trying to figure out how to

say Kestrewnyekov? And the name would
reflect his pride at becoming an American
citizen while still allowing him to publicly
identify himself as a Jew.
Public identification of oneself is at the
core of naming. On the doorframe of many
Jewish homes you will see a mezuzah — a
small box containing a reading from
Deuteronomy. The passage is part of a
series of commandments, including the
original Top 10, which define the religious
Jew's relationship with God. One of these
commandments demands that Jews dis
play a mezuzah outside their home as a
public declaration of their identity.
The reading makes the point that you
cannot be a Jew simply by staying at
home and following the ten command
ments. To be a Jew you must proclaim
your identity in public. Except in times of
extreme danger, it is not sufficient to be a
Rosen at home and a Royal in the streets.
Through the names we choose we may
celebrate our identities or we may deny
them. Whenever someone does the for
mer we should all celebrate with them.
Whenever someone does the latter we
should carve them in chopped liver.
