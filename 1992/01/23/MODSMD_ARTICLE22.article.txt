## Once every 50 years?

While the Prophet of Palo Alto and the
Walsh-induced game of musical coaches
have stolen the spotlight, Mike Mont
gomery and his squad have been putting on quite
a show in the dark.
In what is quickly becoming one of the Stan
ford athletic program's finest years ever, Keefe
& Co. have won their first three Pacific 10
games and jumped out to an 11-1 start, their
best since the NCAA Championship season of
1941-2. Once every fifty years?
On this run the Cardinal has extended its
home winning streak to nine games, but more
importantly, the team chalked up two conference
road wins against Oregon and Oregon State.

Last season Stanford began the Pac-10 sea
son with the same trip to spotted owl country
but came home with two losses. Both were
games that could have been won—the Cardinal
dropped a 17-point second half lead in Eugene
and again came from ahead to lose to the
Beavers. They finished 2-7 on the road and
never were a factor in the 1991 conference race.
Granted Stanford faces its toughest test to
date this weekend as USC and unbeaten, No. 2
UCLA come to town. But with two road wins
already under its belt the Cardinal is 3-0, in
sole possesson of of second place in the confer
ence, and making believers out of the presea
son prognosticators who picked them as low as
eighth. By contrast, both Arizona and USC—
preseason favorites—have dropped two of four.
All Stanford truly needs is a fourth place Pac
-10 finish to make their first trip to the NCAA
Tournament since 1989, and their 8-1 preseason
and unbeaten league start (while it's early to
speculate) puts them in great position for a berth.
So to make up for lost time during the
Green/LelandAValsh saga, and get up to date
before tonight's series against the Harold
Miner-led Trojans. Here are the headlines that
tell the story of the Cardinal's torrid start:
1. Keefe enhances his stature as one of the
nation's elite big men, averaging 25.2 points
and 13.4 rebounds per game.
Keefe, who had the Farm breathing a collec
tive sigh of relief with his announcement to
forego the NBA draft last spring, so far has had
his best season yet, thriving on his role as team
leader and elder statesman. His 86% free throw
percentage and newfound range has opposing
coaches scratching their heads like never
before. In addition, Keefe developed the skills
to stay out of foul trouble (only 21 personal
fouls in twelve games), which will become an
important issue when the Cardinal goes up
against the high-powered front lines of UCLA,
Arizona and Arizona State.
2. Peter Dukes develops into a legitimate
three-point threat, shooting over 50% from long
range and tallying over 12 points per game.
After a summer of firing 200 threes a day,
Dukes acquired the range that the Cardinal
needed to compliment Keefe's inside game.
Dukes was the third guard off the bench last
season, but has established himself as Stan
ford's second leading scorer. Dukes fired a
clutch 25-footer in the last minute to key the
victory at Oregon State, and has knocked down
27 three-pointers in the last seven games.
3. The Cardinal, after losing four starters to
graduation, garners its first national ranking
since 1989.
In addition to Dukes and Garrett, Brent
Williams and Marcus Lollie have assumed start
ing roles for the first time. Lollie has been stable
at the point guard position, averaging 6.3 assists
but only 2.3 turnovers per game. Williams, after
a shaky preseason, has stepped up his game for
conference play, tallying 44 points in his first
three outings. The Associated Press bestowed
the Cardinal with the No. 24 ranking in this
week's poll.
