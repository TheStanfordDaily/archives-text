# Short Hillman tall order for opposition
## 
### Laurie Wackler Staff writer 
In regards to college athletes,
it's generally taken for granted
that bigger is better. Stanford foot
ball brags about the average
weight of its offensive line. Basket
ball players routinely exaggerate
their height by an inch or two in
programs. And it is not uncommon
to see volleyball players pump
themselves up a bit. What is
uncommon is to see an athlete
under-represent his size.
But that's exactly what Cardinal
volleyball standout Bob Hillman
has attempted to do. Although he
stands 6-foot-1-inches, the Junior
outside hitter lists his height as 6-
feet in the 1992 program. "I play up
my shortness. I like to be taken
lightly," Hillman explains.
However, according to Coach
Ruben Nieves, no one is taking
Hillman lightly. "Bob's a weapon,
but he's not a secret weapon any
more. There were certain matches
last year where he was the oppo
nents number-one priority,"
Nieves said.
And this season promises more
of the same. Hillman may be
small, but his role on the team is a
big one.
"He's such a complete player.
He can serve, he can pass, he can
hit, he could even set if we needed
him," Nieves said. "And he's so
consistent. Bob's pushing for his
best everyday, whether it's in a
game or in training."
High praise for a player who
wasn't even recruited out of high
school. Although Stanford
watched Hillman closely through
in his high school years, he was not
pursued. Despite his solid play,
recruits questioned whether, at 6-
feet-1-inches, he could compete on
an NCAA level.
"Out of high school, I wasn't
recruited to play volleyball, nor
were my grades up to par. So I
went to Georgetown, for the aca
demics," Hillman recalls.
"Halfway through the year at
Georgetown, I realized how impor
tant volleyball was to me, because
I wasn't playing. I played 10 times
the whole year. Instead, I took

that opportunity to improve my
grades."
It paid off. Hillman applied to
Stanford after a year at George
town and was accepted. Mean
while, he had improved his stock
as a volleyball player, attending
The Junior League Training
Camp the summer before he left
for Georgetown. The top juniors
and seniors in high school attend
ed the camp, and from there, the
top 12 players were selected to play
at a tournament in Canada. Hill
man was among the 12, and conse
quently gained some exposure.
A year later, Hillman returned
to the volleyball court as a member
of Cardinal. "When I first started
out, I was really inconsistent, (but)
I've gotten better at that as time
goes on," Hillman said. "My goal is
to play at a consistently high level.
If I have a bad day, I want that to be
a good day for the average player."
He's on the way to accomplish
ing that goal. And he'd like to do it
with as little fanfare as possible.
The self proclaimed come-from
behind player likes to think of
himself as a quiet leader, but it will
be hard to keep his accomplish
ments quiet. Hillman led the team
in digs last season, and has already
begun to compile some impressive
hitting stats this year in preseason
matches. In addition, he possesses
an explosive jump-serve, a distin
guishing characteristic of this sea
son's Cardinal.
Hillman is an English
and has recently been accepted to
the coterminal masters pr ogram in
Organizational Behavior. He'll play
his final season for the Cardinal
next year, but beyond that, hasn't
made any plans. "I don't know if
volleyball's my future. I'm small;
they don't really like (guys like)
me," Hillman said in regards to
playing on the international level.
Alongside the rest of the start
ing lineup, Hillman is indeed
small. Even the setter, 6-4 sopho
more Canyon Ceman, dwarfs him.
But the boxscore never says any
thing about height. Kills, aces,
and digs are among the statistics
that count. And regardless of his
size, Bob Hillman makes the big
plays and racks up some big stats.

ball brags about the average
weight of its offensive line. Basket
ball players routinely exaggerate
their height by an inch or two in
programs. And it is not uncommon
to see volleyball players pump
themselves up a bit. What is
uncommon is to see an athlete
under-represent his size.
But that's exactly what Cardinal
volleyball standout Bob Hillman
has attempted to do. Although he
stands 6-foot-1-inches, the Junior
outside hitter lists his height as 6-
feet in the 1992 program. "I play up
my shortness. I like to be taken
lightly," Hillman explains.
However, according to Coach
Ruben Nieves, no one is taking
Hillman lightly. "Bob's a weapon,
but he's not a secret weapon any
more. There were certain matches
last year where he was the oppo
nents number-one priority,"
Nieves said.
And this season promises more
of the same. Hillman may be
small, but his role on the team is a
big one.
"He's such a complete player.
He can serve, he can pass, he can
hit, he could even set if we needed
him," Nieves said. "And he's so
consistent. Bob's pushing for his
best everyday, whether it's in a
game or in training."
High praise for a player who
wasn't even recruited out of high
school. Although Stanford
watched Hillman closely through
in his high school years, he was not
pursued. Despite his solid play,
recruits questioned whether, at 6-
feet-1-inches, he could compete on
an NCAA level.
"Out of high school, I wasn't
recruited to play volleyball, nor
were my grades up to par. So I
went to Georgetown, for the aca
demics," Hillman recalls.
"Halfway through the year at
Georgetown, I realized how impor
tant volleyball was to me, because
I wasn't playing. I played 10 times
the whole year. Instead, I took

that opportunity to improve my
grades."
It paid off. Hillman applied to
Stanford after a year at George
town and was accepted. Mean
while, he had improved his stock
as a volleyball player, attending
The Junior League Training
Camp the summer before he left
for Georgetown. The top juniors
and seniors in high school attend
ed the camp, and from there, the
top 12 players were selected to play
at a tournament in Canada. Hill
man was among the 12, and conse
quently gained some exposure.
A year later, Hillman returned
to the volleyball court as a member
of Cardinal. "When I first started
out, I was really inconsistent, (but)
I've gotten better at that as time
goes on," Hillman said. "My goal is
to play at a consistently high level.
If I have a bad day, I want that to be
a good day for the average player."
He's on the way to accomplish
ing that goal. And he'd like to do it
with as little fanfare as possible.
The self proclaimed come-from
behind player likes to think of
himself as a quiet leader, but it will
be hard to keep his accomplish
ments quiet. Hillman led the team
in digs last season, and has already
begun to compile some impressive
hitting stats this year in preseason
matches. In addition, he possesses
an explosive jump-serve, a distin
guishing characteristic of this sea
son's Cardinal.
Hillman is an English
and has recently been accepted to
the coterminal masters pr ogram in
Organizational Behavior. He'll play
his final season for the Cardinal
next year, but beyond that, hasn't
made any plans. "I don't know if
volleyball's my future. I'm small;
they don't really like (guys like)
me," Hillman said in regards to
playing on the international level.
Alongside the rest of the start
ing lineup, Hillman is indeed
small. Even the setter, 6-4 sopho
more Canyon Ceman, dwarfs him.
But the boxscore never says any
thing about height. Kills, aces,
and digs are among the statistics
that count. And regardless of his
size, Bob Hillman makes the big
plays and racks up some big stats.
