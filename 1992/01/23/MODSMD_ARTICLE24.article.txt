# Card slimes 'Slugs
## 
### Trevor Brown 
Last Saturday, the Stanford
rugby first side began its West
Coast Conference play against an
unexperienced herd of slugs —
the UC-Santa Cruz Banana
Slugs. The game was expected to
be an easy match for the Cardi
nal, who is ranked second in the
conference behind California.
Though the Card won 23-0, it was
not a smooth victory.
"1 was very disappointed," said
a deflated head coach Franck
Boivert. "I thought we would play
much better than we did."
The Card ruggers dominated
play, controlling the ball most of
the game, but not effectively.
"Physically we dominated them.
We were bigger, faster, and basi
cally better. I don't understand
why we didn't play as well as we
•could have," said sophomore
scrumhalf Kevin Linker.
Even though Stanford pos
sessed all the ingredients for a
complete blowout, they could not
produce the salt to neutralize the
Banana Slugs.
The Stanford forwards could
not consistently deliver clean balls
to the backs since they were hav

ing trouble winning the inbounds
throw-in, and the backs found it
difficult to generate any offense.
"We didn't play enough in the
backs. The defense of the Santa
Cruz backline was horrible. We
could have run all over them if we
had more ball," postulated back
line wizard Rob Joyce.
"The reason we played so badly
was because we gave the ball
away so many times. When you
get the ball in your hands you've
got to love the ball. Every time
you touch the ball it is a rebirth, a
new chance," Boivert said.
Statistics support Boivert's
statements. Stanford turned the
ball over 22 times.
All things behind them the
Stanford ruggers are working
hard this week to correct their
mistakes in preparation for their
upcoming game against the Santa
Clara Broncos. As the Card vies
for a first place finish in the con
ference, the Golden Bears and the
Broncos pose the biggest threats.
Play begins Saturday at 11
a.m. when the third side takes on
the Broncos at the IM fields. The
first side plays on Maloney Field
at 1 p.m. and the second side
begins at 3 p.m.
