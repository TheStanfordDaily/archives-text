# Women stalk Dawgs, Cougs

Three years ago, Stanford's women's bas
ketball team won the Pacific 10 Conference
title for the first time in its history. It was an
essential step in establishing the team as a
national power. The Cardinal dominated the
conference completely, going 18-0, a feat that
not even the Cheryl Miller-led USC teams
could accomplish.
Oh, hew things have changed.
Today the Pac-10 is a different beast. It has
improved dramatically in the last few years.
Two years ago, Stanford went 17-1 in confer
ence play, tying for the Pac-10 championship.
Last year Stanford won the crown outright, but
dropped two games to conference foes. This
year, the Cardinal has started off 2-1 and is in
sole possession of second place.
"It's not that we're not as good," guard
Christy Hedgpeth explained. "It's that the con
ference is improved. There is much more pari
ty this year. I'd say, other than the {Southeast
ern Conference], the Pac-10 is the strongest
conference overall, if you look at all 10 teams
top to bottom."
The teams' records so far bear
this out. Only two Pac-10 teams
have losing records (Arizona and
Oregon State). Of the teams with
winning records, USC has the
worst at 8-5. The Women of Troy
were picked in most preseason
polls to finish second in the Pac-10
and in the top 25 nationally.
"The Pac-10 is wide open,"
UCLA's scoring machine Rehema
Stephens said. "Even Stanford, at
No. 2, can lose." She referred to
California's nine-point upset of
the Cardinal Jan. 10.

After that game, Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer tried to
look at the bright side of the loss.
"In a way, it's good," she said.
"Now teams will have to prepare
for both of us."
Indeed, that is one factor in the
Cardinal's favor as it heads north to
face Washington State tonight and
Washington Saturday night. Since
Pac-10 teams tend to travel in pairs,
California will be playing the Wash
ington schools in reverse order.
The Cougars are 9-4 overall
and tied for third in the Pac-10
with a 2-2 conference record.
Washington State's strengths
are its backcourt experience and
its frontcourt talent. Guards
Heather Norman and Darla
Williamson are both seniors and

returning starters. Norman is the
more dangerous of the two. She
will shoot three-pointers at any
opportunity, and she hits them
about 45 percent of the time.
Up front the Cougars have three
bruising sophomores. Forward
Angie Peterson is a returning
starter from last year and is aggres
sive on the boards. Back-up center
Kathy Weber is 6-foot-8-inches tall
and leads the Pac-10 in blocked
shots. Starting center Camille
Thompson is the Cougars' big gun,
averaging more than 16 points per
game on 60 percent shooting.
Junior Darci Wellsandt pro
vides experience and scoring at the
small forward spot, having played
as a "super-sub" last year and
averaging 12.1 ppgover the year.
