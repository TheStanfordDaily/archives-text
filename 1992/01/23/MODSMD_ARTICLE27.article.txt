# Men, Williams scheme to keep Miner
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Stanford has the No. 1 defense in the
Pacific 10 Conference, but the Cardinal
has yet to face the Pac-10's No. 1 scorer,
a man many theologians suspect is
Michael Jordan reincarnated on the col
lege level.
USC guard Harold Miner brings the
Baby Jordan show to Maples Pavilion
tonight at 7:30 p.m., putting Stanford's
top-rated defense and No. 24 national
ranking to a treacherous test of heli
copter dunks and 26-foot fadeaway
jumpers.
Miner, the Pac-10's leading scorer at
27.0 points per game, is nicknamed
Baby Jordan for his unstoppable one-on
one moves and his mile-wide smile. At 6-
feet-5-inches, Miner can score from all
over the floor, but usually he scores
from the air.
"Miner is phenomenal," said Mont
gomery, whose team has surrendered
just 62.8 points per game, tops in the
Pac-10. "Instead of gearing their offense
to get open shots, they gear their offense
to get Miner the ball."
"He's a great one-on-one player, a
quick jumper and he rebounds a lot of

his own misses. But in trying to defend
Miner we can't let someone else go off,"
said Montgomery.
Cardinal sophomore Brent Williams,
a 6-feet-6-inches small forward, will
have the luck of covering Miner for most
of the game, although Stanford may
play a box-and-one defense as it did suc
cessfully against Virginia All-American
Bryant Stith.
"He's a good player, you can't really
shut him down," said Williams. "He can

jump, he can move, he's athletic — it's
the toughest job I've had all year."
Williams can expect relief from 6-7
freshman Andy Poppink and 6-feet-4-
inches guard Kenny Hicks.
"From an athletic standpoint, if
Hicks can get down and toughen up, he
could match up with Miner too," said
Montgomery.
Things don't get much easier Satur-

Brent Williams will need to use all his defensive resources tonight as he goes head
to-head against one of the nation's best, Harold Miner.
