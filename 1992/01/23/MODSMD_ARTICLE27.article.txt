# Men, Williams scheme to keep Miner
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Stanford has the No. 1 defense in the
Pacific 10 Conference, but the Cardinal
has yet to face the Pac-10's No. 1 scorer,
a man many theologians suspect is
Michael Jordan reincarnated on the col
lege level.
USC guard Harold Miner brings the
Baby Jordan show to Maples Pavilion
tonight at 7:30 p.m., putting Stanford's
top-rated defense and No. 24 national
ranking to a treacherous test of heli
copter dunks and 26-foot fadeaway
jumpers.
Miner, the Pac-10's leading scorer at
27.0 points per game, is nicknamed
Baby Jordan for his unstoppable one-on
one moves and his mile-wide smile. At 6-
feet-5-inches, Miner can score from all
over the floor, but usually he scores
from the air.
"Miner is phenomenal," said Mont
gomery, whose team has surrendered
just 62.8 points per game, tops in the
Pac-10. "Instead of gearing their offense
to get open shots, they gear their offense
to get Miner the ball."
"He's a great one-on-one player, a
quick jumper and he rebounds a lot of

his own misses. But in trying to defend
Miner we can't let someone else go off,"
said Montgomery.
Cardinal sophomore Brent Williams,
a 6-feet-6-inches small forward, will
have the luck of covering Miner for most
of the game, although Stanford may
play a box-and-one defense as it did suc
cessfully against Virginia All-American
Bryant Stith.
"He's a good player, you can't really
shut him down," said Williams. "He can

jump, he can move, he's athletic — it's
the toughest job I've had all year."
Williams can expect relief from 6-7
freshman Andy Poppink and 6-feet-4-
inches guard Kenny Hicks.
"From an athletic standpoint, if
Hicks can get down and toughen up, he
could match up with Miner too," said
Montgomery.
Things don't get much easier Satur-


Al Green — Daily file
Brent Williams will need to use all his defensive resources tonight as he goes head
to-head against one of the nation's best, Harold Miner.
day at 3 p.m., when Don Mac Lean
and Tracy Murray, both averag
ing over 22 points per game, lead
undefeated and No. 2 UCLA into
Maples.
If Stanford can somehow
sweep the Los Angeles schools, it
would vault the Cardinal —
picked to finish seventh in the
conference — firmly atop the Pac
-10. Even though UCLA is one of
the most talent-laden programs in
the nation, Stanford has beaten
the Bruins in five of the last seven
meetings.
"Our concentration will have

to be at an all-time max this week
end," said Montgomery. "If you
win one, it keeps you in the hunt.
If you lose two, it really gets you
away from what you are trying to
accomplish."
"For UCLA we have a little less
time to prepare," he said. "They
have a whole team of great ath
letes, so you just have to play
them straight up. Obviously,
everyone has to play very well to
beat UCLA."
Only UCLA (4-0) and Stanford
(3-0) are undefeated in Pac-10
play, with the Bruins pulling out
an overtime win against Oregon
State in their last outing. Defend
ing league champion Arizona (2-
2) was upset at Washington (2-1),
while USC (3-1) easily swept the

Oregon schools at home.
Stanford begins a murderous
midseason stretch following the
UCLA game, with six road games
sandwiched around Arizona and
Arizona State at home.
Card Notes
Three-point specialist Peter Dukes
re-injured his left elbow against Cali
fornia, but will play out the season
wearing a bandage. Dukes, who first
injured the elbow as a sophomore,
again punctured the bursa sack,
requiring five stitches to close the
wound. The Pac-10's third-ranked
three-point shooter, Dukes will play
the rest of the season with a pad to
protect the injury. Dukes is right
handed, so the injury should not limit
his three-point shooting.
