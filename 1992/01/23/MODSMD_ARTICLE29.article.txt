# Laris elected Vol. 201 editor
## 
### 
The Lord has spoken to Mike Laris in strange
ways. "I eat bagels by tearing them into little
chunks," the editor in chief-elect of The Daily said.
"Only barbarians touch their hands to their
mouths."
Laris has had barbaric days of his own, however.
The fifth-year senior in Political Science was, once
upon a time, part of the "bleacher crowd" in his
Pasadena junior high school.
Members of this group would sit on bleachers,
trailing their long locks over their shoulders. "1
never smoked pot," he admits, "but I am incredibly
attracted to strong women.
"It hearkens back to Western Culture when I
read the Bible for the first time," he said. "It's that
not eating meat on Tuesday thing.
"Wait ... is this going to hurt my political
career?"
A Delilah has put the shears to Laris' hair at
some point in the last few years, so that it just miss
es the "love bump" on his right shoulder. Laris said
he promised his "mother" that he would have it
removed this month, before it gets a chance to fes
ter or grow hair and a set of teeth.
Laris is convinced that the "love bump" is part of
his sex appeal. "The doctors tell me it's a closed-up

hair follicle, filled with trapped oil and other fluids.
"Who can resist that?" he said, no doubt think
ing of his overseas sweetheart.
He has acted as the official Daily censor for the
past volume in his position as managing editor.
Every once in a while, though, the editor in chief
slips something by him, like the word "licker" or a
photograph of a 303-pound cyst.
While at first he hated the idea of the hideous
mass on the front page of The Daily, he acknowl
edged that "there was intense interest in it. People
were faxing it to their friends.
"When you care enough to send the very cyst, I
guess."
Soon after the election Laris was caught testing
out the couch he will inherit when he takes over the
helm of The Daily. "This needs to be steam
cleaned," the anal-retentive Laris said. "Ewwww."
Couch-testing is only one of Laris' many hobbies,
however. He is known to enjoy 3 a.m. jogs, ocean swims
and eating mayonnaise by the heaping spoonful.
"I can't help it,"he said. "I just love my mayo."
He loves his mayo so much that he once took a
swim in a giant vat of the oleaginous goop while
attempting to break the world record for "largest
sandwich ever."
