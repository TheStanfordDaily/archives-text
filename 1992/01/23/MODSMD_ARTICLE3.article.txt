# Fraternities to adopt new Rush policies
## 
### Kimberly Chrisman Staff writer 
Representatives of 15 Stanford fraternities
agreed last night to adopt a new set of regula
tions for this year's Rush to avoid conflicts with
Prospective Freshman Weekend activities.
"A year ago, we could have done just about
anything we wanted during Rush," said
Matthew Moran, the Inter fraternity Coun
cil's Rush chairman. "This year, for the first
time, people are thinking about risk manage
ment."
Because the third and last weekend of Rush
traditionally coincides with Pro Fro Weekend,
fraternities hosting events on campus during
that weekend must now keep the events closed
or entirely non-alcoholic. According to Moran,
written invitations will also be honored.

"Pretty much everyone is going off-cam
pus," he said.
Heat her Dunn, a representative of the Office
of Student Affairs, described the new Rush pro
cedure as an attempt at "self-regulation.
"The administration is providing students
with the opportunity to manage the system
themselves," Dunn said. "That happened with
the Greek Judicial Board, and this is another
example.
"More people will adhere to IFC regula
tions than to the administration's," she added.
Although Dean of Students Michael Jack
son had originally proposed having a two-week
Rush to avoid overlap with Pro Fro Weekend,
members of the IFC negotiated for a more
strictly regulated three-week Rush.
"There's no way you can get to know 28
people in two weeks," Moran said. "Rushees

This year, for the first time,
people are thinking about
risk management.'

feel pressured to go to every Rush event. If
they have to miss an event to take a midterm,
that hurts their ability to meet people."
According to Dunn, Rush '92 will also fea
ture "new and improved" Rush Monitors,
who will ensure that fraternities adhere to
the new regulations. In addition to overseeing
Rush parties, these monitors will "help main
tain an even playing field" during Rush,
Dunn said.
