# Riders duel with Trojans, 'Stangs

### Karen Wayland 
After a resounding victory over
Washington State on Januaiy 7, the
undefeated Stanford men's polo
team is hoping to ride to another
win this Saturday over USC and
Cal-Poly San Luis Obispo. A
formidable force this season, the
Cardinal combines sophomores Guy
Elliot and John Harris with juniors
Morgan McCarroll and John
Mcßitchie to make up the No. 1-
ranked team in the region. Together
they have strong hopes of making it
to the Final Four play-offs.
Last year, both the men's and
women's teams made it to the
regional play-offs in Fort Worth,
Texas. "We've got a young, thriv

ing club," said sophomore John
Harris, who has had more polo
experience than most afler grow
ing up in England. "We're on the
springboard to success."
The Stanford women's team
will challenge both USC and Cal-
Poly on Friday. After losing several
experienced players last year, the
team is working hard to develop
new strength. Freshman Sarah
Wadhwani comments, "Playing
polo is like playing hockey on
horseback. It's a lot of fun, and it's
very competitive."
The Stanford Polo Club, with
an annual budget of $35,000,
receives less than one-third of its
funds from the University. The
rest comes from private donations

and fund raisers. They compete
on the intercollegiate level with
teams from all over the western
region, and also with other local
clubs. A uniquely demanding
sport, polo requires precise coor
dination between each horse and
rider, as well as between players.
The polo club practices daily on
the grass Held at Webb Ranch,
and intercollegiate competitions
are played in the arena at CTETA
on Sand Hill Road. Tomorrow the
women will play from 12 to 2, and
Saturday the men will compete
from 10 to 12. For more informa
tion, or for directions to the field,
contact team captain John
Mcßitchie at 497-1082, or head
coach Wes Linfoot, 851-0670.
