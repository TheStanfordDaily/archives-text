It wasn't John Ritter who gave me an erection.
Nor was it Joyce Dewitt. And it certainly wasn't
Norman Fell.
You see, ever since 1 was first beckoned by those
four or five, barely intelligible, seemingly harmless
little words — "commanockonardoor" — I have been
permanently scarred. At that one single moment,
my vision of womanhood was irrevocably altered,
never again to be reclaimed. My mother was no
longer so attractive.

I don't want to be attracted to Suzanne Somers. I
don't like myself for it. If it were up to me, I'd get all
hot and bothered by Nancy Friday or Joyce Carol
Oat.es or, at the very least, that fat woman in the new
Prince video.
I'm not proud of it. No, not any of it. Not the video
tapes of Suzanne in the Battle of the Network Stars
dunking competition. Not the fantasy with Suzanne
in a jumbo-sized chicken costume. And definitely not
the 3 a.m. nights spent waiting for Suzanne to appear
on those Thighmaster' M commercials.
But I can't help it. My concept of female sexuality
is inexorably connected with that frighteningly
attractive, Hefneresque women-child who floated
across my living room screen at the very point at
which I was forming my concept of female sexuality.
Now, I'm forever cursed with the fantasy of full
breasted woman, who somehow manage to coyly feign
complete ignorance of her own powerful sensuality.
And for this, I blame society.
I blame society not for the hours I wasted watching
"She's the Sheriff" or searching back issues of Play
boy; no, those turned out to be learning experiences. I
now understand not only that the police can be your
friends, but that the most beautiful models, no matter
how superficial they look, invariably list intelligence
above good-looks when asked for their turn-ons.
I blame society for maliciously molding my concept
of female sexuality for its own mercenary purposes.
They took an innocent 14- year-old whose sole aim in
life was to get the Donruss Reggie Jackson card, and
turned him into a monster — a monster unilaterally
bent on tall, naive, big-breasted women with straight
blonde hair — excluding, of course, opera singers.
Except maybe for that Phantom of the Opera fantasy,
but I was older bv that time.
What society demanded of my pubescing adoles
cent self was someone who, for the rest of his life,
would follow his every whim. Someone who would
buy Bugle Boy jeans because of vague threats they
claim to have printed on the bottom of the screen.
Someone who'd wear that New West cologne.
But they didn't get me. Sure, they may have manip
ulated the course of all my future relationships, like
hand a little too deep inside some Orwellian muppet —
but my clothes and cologne choices are still mine.
Intellectually, I'm repulsed by the woman. I don't
like her acting, I don't like her sob stories about her
drunk father and I don't like the way she's able to
build that slow, sirenic, almost poetic chemistry with
that Patrick Duffy loser, who isn't that good-looking
of a guy anyway.
But somehow, whenever I see her full lips pucker,
breathlessly eeking out the words, "squeeze squee.
squeeze your way to a shapely figure," I suddenly
find myself melting like untrodden Christmas snow.
So here I am, stuck in a world of second-rate Las
Vegas acts; a world where Pi Phi's refuse to meet the
