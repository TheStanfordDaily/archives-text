# a 						week-long celebration of the daring, controversial and often BIZARRE musical world of John Cage
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
For almost 50 years, John Cage has
been leading a revolution. Sometimes
with a loud flourish, sometimes in
silence, Cage has been fighting the
mainstream — not with guns and
knives, but with woks and cacti. Next
week, Cage is bringing his rebellion to
campus.
For decades, Cage has been at the
head of avant-garde philosophy in
America. Known mainly for his com
positions, which reject most tenets of
traditional music, Cage has amassed a
long list of followers, who see Cage not
just as a music maker, but as a vision
ary.
The Stanford Humanities Center

has collaborated with the Depart
ments of Art, Drama, English and
Music to present John Cage Week at
Stanford.
The week-long celebration, Jan. 27
through Jan. 31, honors the artist's
80th birthday, and is the first and
largest celebration scheduled this
year, according to Charles Junkerman,
associate director of the Humanities
Center.
"I didn't think it would be a possi
bility that he'd come," said Marjorie
Perloff, a professor of English who has
studied Cage extensively, focusing
largely on his writings. According to
Perloff, Cage is "considered by most
people the leading avant-garde artist,
if such a thing still exists today."
Avant-garde is an old military term

that, when adapted to more artistic
uses, means "art that is at the cutting
edge," she said.
According to Perloff, Cage "has
always been a sort of oppositional fig
ure," avant-garde even in his early
career. One of Cage's first composi
tions, she said, was a water ballet com
posed for a UCLA synchronized swim
ming team that included a gong in a
pool. That is about as everyday as
Cage's compositions get.
One of the areas in which Cage has
experimented most is instrumenta
tion. Although he has written pieces
for orchestra and piano, his music usu
ally tends towards more bizarre meth
ods of sound production.
A favorite instrument of Cage's is
the prepared piano — a normal piano

with pieces of metal or other material
lodged between the strings in differ
ent, pre arranged places — creating a
sound more like a broken xylophone
than a piano. Other even more unusu
al instruments Cage has used include
cacti (played by plucking their needles)
and a wok which has its cooking noises
amplified by a microphone.
Bizarre instrumentation is not the
only way Cage displays his avant garde
tendencies. According to Junkerman,
one of Cage's most influential notions
is an opposition to the Romantic
thought that music exists to express
the composer's feelings.
Rather, Junkerman says, Cage
believes music should be largely

unregulated by the composer, and
Cage has used a variety of techniques
to bring out the random element in
his music. "Cage's compositions, and
his conceptions of what comes when,
have always been interesting,"
Junkerman said. "What's chance is
never clear."
One method Cage has used to
insure randomness in his music,
Junkerman said, involves imperfec
tions in a piece of paper. All paper,
Junkerman said, has tiny blotches.
In one composition, Cage circled the
imperfections in several pieces of
paper, drew staff lines across the
paper, creating sheets of music and
thus a whole composition.
Cage's hope in random composi
tions, Junkerman said, is that "not
only the audience, but he himself,
will have a new experience he's never
had before."
But randomness is only one of the
controversial themes in Cage's
music, and not the most debated.
Cage raised his greatest furor delving
into an area of music that the unini
tiated might not think of — silence.
"Something very central to Cage's
work is the legitimization of silence,"
Junkerman said.
One of Cage's greatest musical
epiphanies, and one of the anecdotes
most often told about him, involves a
sound-proof chamber. Decades ago,
Cage, placed himself in just such a
chamber, expecting to hear no noise.
Instead, Junkerman said, Cage
heard two noises; one high-pitched,
one low-pitched. A technician told
Cage the high sound was his nervous
system working, while the lower
sound was the blood rushing through
his veins.
It was at that moment, Junker
man said, Cage realized there was no
such thing as silence. Cage began
experimenting more with silence in
his pieces, Junkerman said, an exper
imentation that culminated in his
piece "4'33"" (four minutes and 33
seconds).
According to Robert Black, direc
tor of orchestras at Stanford, who
has conducted and performed many
Cage works, "4'33"" consists of a
pianist walking on stage, sitting at
the piano. The pianist sits motion

lessly, "performing" in total silence,
for the named amount of time, after
which he rises from the piano, the
piece finished.
According to Junkerman, "4*33""
was "quite an outrage when it was
first performed," and much of the
music community polarized around
the piece. Some hailed it as brilliant,
but many criticized it.
Black agreed that Cage was the
first to make such "radical" use of
silence in his music, but pointed out
that silence has "been one of the
most integral parts of music since
music began."
"Of course," Black added, "he
made it famous."
But for all Cage's avant-garde
ideas and unusual implementations,
one question remains: Is it music?
Cage's ideas are undeniably interest
ing, but the artistic merit of his com
positions is still being debated, in
some cases, hotly.
"His work is very strange," said
Perloff. "There are a lot of musicolo
gists and music critics, who don't like
him."
"There's still a vast polarity over
public acceptance of Cage," Black
said.
Perloff said that she doesn't think
Cage will be remembered for his con
tributions to music as much as his
writings (over eight books) and his
role as a leader in avant-garde
thought.
"Many people would say he's first
and foremost a philosopher," Perloff
said.
Black, however, said he believes
Cage will go down in history as a
great composer. "It's almost impossi
ble to underestimate his influence,"
said Black.
And many love Cage's work, and
Cage himself, unreservedly. "Cage is
so inspiring. He's a Buddhist, and he
has this kind, beatific serenity,"
Junkerman said. After a Cage con
cert, the audience "suddenly can
hear more and see more than ever
before," he added.
"There are lots of composers you
can just hear," said PerlofT. But, she
said, ever since John Cage first began
composing, "music has never quite
been the same."

But randomness is only one of the
controversial themes in Cage's
music, and not the most debated.
Cage raised his greatest furor delving
into an area of music that the unini
tiated might not think of — silence.
"Something very central to Cage's
work is the legitimization of silence,"
Junkerman said.
One of Cage's greatest musical
epiphanies, and one of the anecdotes
most often told about him, involves a
sound-proof chamber. Decades ago,
Cage, placed himself in just such a
chamber, expecting to hear no noise.
Instead, Junkerman said, Cage
heard two noises; one high-pitched,
one low-pitched. A technician told
Cage the high sound was his nervous
system working, while the lower
sound was the blood rushing through
his veins.
It was at that moment, Junker
man said, Cage realized there was no
such thing as silence. Cage began
experimenting more with silence in
his pieces, Junkerman said, an exper
imentation that culminated in his
piece "4'33"" (four minutes and 33
seconds).
According to Robert Black, direc
tor of orchestras at Stanford, who
has conducted and performed many
Cage works, "4'33"" consists of a
pianist walking on stage, sitting at
the piano. The pianist sits motion

lessly, "performing" in total silence,
for the named amount of time, after
which he rises from the piano, the
piece finished.
According to Junkerman, "4*33""
was "quite an outrage when it was
first performed," and much of the
music community polarized around
the piece. Some hailed it as brilliant,
but many criticized it.
Black agreed that Cage was the
first to make such "radical" use of
silence in his music, but pointed out
that silence has "been one of the
most integral parts of music since
music began."
"Of course," Black added, "he
made it famous."
But for all Cage's avant-garde
ideas and unusual implementations,
one question remains: Is it music?
Cage's ideas are undeniably interest
ing, but the artistic merit of his com
positions is still being debated, in
some cases, hotly.
"His work is very strange," said
Perloff. "There are a lot of musicolo
gists and music critics, who don't like
him."
"There's still a vast polarity over
public acceptance of Cage," Black
said.
Perloff said that she doesn't think
Cage will be remembered for his con
tributions to music as much as his
writings (over eight books) and his
role as a leader in avant-garde
thought.
"Many people would say he's first
and foremost a philosopher," Perloff
said.
Black, however, said he believes
Cage will go down in history as a
great composer. "It's almost impossi
ble to underestimate his influence,"
said Black.
And many love Cage's work, and
Cage himself, unreservedly. "Cage is
so inspiring. He's a Buddhist, and he
has this kind, beatific serenity,"
Junkerman said. After a Cage con
cert, the audience "suddenly can
hear more and see more than ever
before," he added.
"There are lots of composers you
can just hear," said PerlofT. But, she
said, ever since John Cage first began
composing, "music has never quite
been the same."

For almost 50 years, John Cage has
been leading a revolution. Sometimes
with a loud flourish, sometimes in
silence, Cage has been fighting the
mainstream — not with guns and
knives, but with woks and cacti. Next
week, Cage is bringing his rebellion to
campus.
For decades, Cage has been at the
head of avant-garde philosophy in
America. Known mainly for his com
positions, which reject most tenets of
traditional music, Cage has amassed a
long list of followers, who see Cage not
just as a music maker, but as a vision
ary.
The Stanford Humanities Center

has collaborated with the Depart
ments of Art, Drama, English and
Music to present John Cage Week at
Stanford.
The week-long celebration, Jan. 27
through Jan. 31, honors the artist's
80th birthday, and is the first and
largest celebration scheduled this
year, according to Charles Junkerman,
associate director of the Humanities
Center.
"I didn't think it would be a possi
bility that he'd come," said Marjorie
Perloff, a professor of English who has
studied Cage extensively, focusing
largely on his writings. According to
Perloff, Cage is "considered by most
people the leading avant-garde artist,
if such a thing still exists today."
Avant-garde is an old military term

that, when adapted to more artistic
uses, means "art that is at the cutting
edge," she said.
According to Perloff, Cage "has
always been a sort of oppositional fig
ure," avant-garde even in his early
career. One of Cage's first composi
tions, she said, was a water ballet com
posed for a UCLA synchronized swim
ming team that included a gong in a
pool. That is about as everyday as
Cage's compositions get.
One of the areas in which Cage has
experimented most is instrumenta
tion. Although he has written pieces
for orchestra and piano, his music usu
ally tends towards more bizarre meth
ods of sound production.
A favorite instrument of Cage's is
the prepared piano — a normal piano

with pieces of metal or other material
lodged between the strings in differ
ent, pre arranged places — creating a
sound more like a broken xylophone
than a piano. Other even more unusu
al instruments Cage has used include
cacti (played by plucking their needles)
and a wok which has its cooking noises
amplified by a microphone.
Bizarre instrumentation is not the
only way Cage displays his avant garde
tendencies. According to Junkerman,
one of Cage's most influential notions
is an opposition to the Romantic
thought that music exists to express
the composer's feelings.
Rather, Junkerman says, Cage
believes music should be largely

unregulated by the composer, and
Cage has used a variety of techniques
to bring out the random element in
his music. "Cage's compositions, and
his conceptions of what comes when,
have always been interesting,"
Junkerman said. "What's chance is
never clear."
One method Cage has used to
insure randomness in his music,
Junkerman said, involves imperfec
tions in a piece of paper. All paper,
Junkerman said, has tiny blotches.
In one composition, Cage circled the
imperfections in several pieces of
paper, drew staff lines across the
paper, creating sheets of music and
thus a whole composition.
Cage's hope in random composi
tions, Junkerman said, is that "not
only the audience, but he himself,
will have a new experience he's never
had before."
But randomness is only one of the
controversial themes in Cage's
music, and not the most debated.
