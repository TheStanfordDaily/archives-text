For almost 50 years, John Cage has
been leading a revolution. Sometimes
with a loud flourish, sometimes in
silence, Cage has been fighting the
mainstream — not with guns and
knives, but with woks and cacti. Next
week, Cage is bringing his rebellion to
campus.
For decades, Cage has been at the
head of avant-garde philosophy in
America. Known mainly for his com
positions, which reject most tenets of
traditional music, Cage has amassed a
long list of followers, who see Cage not
just as a music maker, but as a vision
ary.
The Stanford Humanities Center

has collaborated with the Depart
ments of Art, Drama, English and
Music to present John Cage Week at
Stanford.
The week-long celebration, Jan. 27
through Jan. 31, honors the artist's
80th birthday, and is the first and
largest celebration scheduled this
year, according to Charles Junkerman,
associate director of the Humanities
Center.
"I didn't think it would be a possi
bility that he'd come," said Marjorie
Perloff, a professor of English who has
studied Cage extensively, focusing
largely on his writings. According to
Perloff, Cage is "considered by most
people the leading avant-garde artist,
if such a thing still exists today."
Avant-garde is an old military term

that, when adapted to more artistic
uses, means "art that is at the cutting
edge," she said.
According to Perloff, Cage "has
always been a sort of oppositional fig
ure," avant-garde even in his early
career. One of Cage's first composi
tions, she said, was a water ballet com
posed for a UCLA synchronized swim
ming team that included a gong in a
pool. That is about as everyday as
Cage's compositions get.
One of the areas in which Cage has
experimented most is instrumenta
tion. Although he has written pieces
for orchestra and piano, his music usu
ally tends towards more bizarre meth
ods of sound production.
A favorite instrument of Cage's is
the prepared piano — a normal piano

with pieces of metal or other material
lodged between the strings in differ
ent, pre arranged places — creating a
sound more like a broken xylophone
than a piano. Other even more unusu
al instruments Cage has used include
cacti (played by plucking their needles)
and a wok which has its cooking noises
amplified by a microphone.
Bizarre instrumentation is not the
only way Cage displays his avant garde
tendencies. According to Junkerman,
one of Cage's most influential notions
is an opposition to the Romantic
thought that music exists to express
the composer's feelings.
Rather, Junkerman says, Cage
believes music should be largely
