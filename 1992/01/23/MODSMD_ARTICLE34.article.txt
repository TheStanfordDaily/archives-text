It's cable TV come to life at Stanford.
From Chinese cooking demonstrations to
symphony orchestras to panel discussions,
you can see it all, and you don't even need
a remote control.
What is this multimedia extravaganza?
It's "John Cage week at Stanford a week
long program of art, drama, literature and
music celebrating the 80th birthday of
composer and artist John Cage. Here's a
preview of the week's highlights:
• Musicircus. Wednesday, Jan. 29,
7:30-10:30 in Braun Music Center.
Admission is free.
Cage himself has described this as an
event with "as much music as can be
played by all those willing to perform
without being paid. Loud and soft. Seri
ous and popular. Young and old. Student
recitals. Church choirs. Athletics or
dance." More than 100 performing groups
from Stanford and the surrounding area
have been recruited to stage this carnival.
Lawrence Chu, television personality
and Chinese chef, will cook while a micro
phone picks up the sounds from his wok
and chopping block.
Janet Herzenberg will perform on the
didgeridoo, a 7-foot long Australian abo
riginal wind instrument made from a
branch hollowed out by termites.
Herb Moore and his group, the Grey
Water Band, will demonstrate Scrapopho
ny, or "the art of making music with
found objects." According to Moore,
they'll be playing such innovative instru
ments as toilet bowl float maracas and cir
cular saw blades.
Bakshish, a Balkan dance band, will
play Bulgarian, Macedonian and Greek
music. According to band member
Suzanne Bogas, the band is very excited to
play at Musicircus because "it's an envi
ronment very similar to some festivals
held in the Balkans." Golden Gate
Blaskapelle, a 10-member German brass
band will be playing "Oktoberfest type
music," according to coronet player Ken
Horsteine. Other attractions include a
children's rap group from East Palo Alto,
a collection of music boxes and a bagpiper.
Performers will be scattered inside and
outside the building, in rooms, hallways
and stairwells. Even the bathrooms won't
be silent; Stephan Ripich will be harping
in the men's rest room on the Dilling
Harp, on an unusual instrument that is a
cross between a folk harp and a concert
pedal harp.
Cage himself will be in an acoustically
isolated room performing "Muoyce"
(Music Joyce) for two out of the three
hours. During the event, the public is invit
ed to wander about the building and expe
rience as much music as possible.

It's cable TV come to life at Stanford.
From Chinese cooking demonstrations to
symphony orchestras to panel discussions,
you can see it all, and you don't even need
a remote control.
What is this multimedia extravaganza?
It's "John Cage week at Stanford a week
long program of art, drama, literature and
music celebrating the 80th birthday of
composer and artist John Cage. Here's a
preview of the week's highlights:
• Musicircus. Wednesday, Jan. 29,
7:30-10:30 in Braun Music Center.
Admission is free.
Cage himself has described this as an
event with "as much music as can be
played by all those willing to perform
without being paid. Loud and soft. Seri
ous and popular. Young and old. Student
recitals. Church choirs. Athletics or
dance." More than 100 performing groups
from Stanford and the surrounding area
have been recruited to stage this carnival.
Lawrence Chu, television personality
and Chinese chef, will cook while a micro
phone picks up the sounds from his wok
and chopping block.
Janet Herzenberg will perform on the
didgeridoo, a 7-foot long Australian abo
riginal wind instrument made from a
branch hollowed out by termites.
Herb Moore and his group, the Grey
Water Band, will demonstrate Scrapopho
ny, or "the art of making music with
found objects." According to Moore,
they'll be playing such innovative instru
ments as toilet bowl float maracas and cir
cular saw blades.
Bakshish, a Balkan dance band, will
play Bulgarian, Macedonian and Greek
music. According to band member
Suzanne Bogas, the band is very excited to
play at Musicircus because "it's an envi
ronment very similar to some festivals
held in the Balkans." Golden Gate
Blaskapelle, a 10-member German brass
band will be playing "Oktoberfest type
music," according to coronet player Ken
Horsteine. Other attractions include a
children's rap group from East Palo Alto,
a collection of music boxes and a bagpiper.
Performers will be scattered inside and
outside the building, in rooms, hallways
and stairwells. Even the bathrooms won't
be silent; Stephan Ripich will be harping
in the men's rest room on the Dilling
Harp, on an unusual instrument that is a
cross between a folk harp and a concert
pedal harp.
Cage himself will be in an acoustically
isolated room performing "Muoyce"
(Music Joyce) for two out of the three
hours. During the event, the public is invit
ed to wander about the building and expe
rience as much music as possible.
