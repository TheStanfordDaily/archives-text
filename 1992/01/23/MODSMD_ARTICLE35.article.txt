# It's like taking a long ride with your parents
## The
						Stanford Chorale presents a night of show tunes and popular culture 
### Tracy Shinn Staff writer 
Ever wonder if Pavarotti sings
tunes like "Puttin' on the Ritz" or
"Jellicle Cats" in the shower
every once in a while, just for
kicks? Are all those highly
trained, hoity-toity classical musi
cians and conductors really closet
"Rocky Horror Picture Show"
groupies? They've got to take off
their tuxes and gowns sometime,
don't they?
Well, if the members of the
Stanford Chamber Chorale are
representative of other such pol
ished vocalists, the answer is an
emphatic yes.
This group is normally kept
busy rehearsing Brahms, Schu
mann or Mozart, but next week
they'll be busting loose with their

favorite tunes from the Broadway
stage. This coming Tuesday
through Saturday at Ricker Din
ing Hall the chorale will present
"The Broadway Cafe II: The Next
Generation."
After the overwhelming suc
cess of last year's "Murder at the
Broadway Cafe," which sold out
every show, the chorale decided
that letting their hair down and
singing in English for once was
just too much fun to not give a
repeat performance in '92.

'It's up to the crew of the Federation Starship Enter
prise, lead by Captain Jean "Cool Hand Luc" Picard,
to save all of musical theater for the music-lovers of
the future.'

This year's show features an
all-new selection of popular songs
from "Cats," "The Little Shop of
Horrors," and, believe it or not,
"Rocky Horror," among many
other great musicals. The tunes
are all creatively woven into a
wild Star-Trek plot that includes
encounters with extra-terrestri
als, time travel and a mysterious
scheme to eliminate all of the
great Broadway musicals —
except one exceedingly irritating
song.

It's up to the crew of the Fed
eration Starship Enterprise, lead
by Captain Jean "Cool Hand Luc"
Picard, to save all of musical the
ater for the music-lovers of the
future.
It's sure to be an evening full of
surprises, jokes and great singing
in a relaxed cafe atmosphere. Fea
tured members of the Chorale will
include such well-known campus
performers as Ram's Head The
atrical Society veterans Cathye
Roline, Ren Evans, Illana Zauder
er, Dan Hunt, Gina Silverman
and Kevin Rleyer — in addition to
many other accomplished singers.
Desserts from cheesecake to
cookies will be served, along with
coffee and cool drinks.

Tickets: $9 general, $6 students
All performances begin at 8 p.m.
