## Drive in, drop out and long for the past 
### Mike Curry Staff writer 
Drive-ins are not meant to be experienced alone.
They're meant for families, pickup trucks full of
friends, sleeping bags, kids in pajamas with vinyl
feet and most important of all — dates.
So when my editor called on Saturday and sug
gested that I "take what's-her-name" along on my
review of the Burlingame Drive-in, I knew he meant
well. How could he have known that we had just bro
ken up?
So I thanked him and silently resolved to contin
ue my quest and review the drive-in . . . alone. (Start
the violins now.)
I had never been to a drive-in before, and as I
drove north on Route 101,1 was eagerly looking for
ward to being depressed. But just as I passed that
obnoxious Circle Star sign (Surprise, Gallagher is
coming . . . again), I experienced an incredibly deep
and moving Epiphany: I was a free man! Tapping
into my wild primal male urges, I turned off the
car's radio and howled. Then I drummed an ancient
male rhythm on the dashboard.
Actually, I only hummed "Yesterday," but I
attempted a masculine rendition.
Pulling off the highway approximately three exits
before the San Francisco airport, I was surprised by
the drive-in attendant when she only asked for
$4.50. I was beginning to discover that the drive-in
is a great bargain, especially when you no longer
have to pay for your girlfriend. In fact, I bet I could
have fit two or three people in my trunk and saved
even more.
Shouting over the noise of a landing Northwest
jet, the ticket attendant had advised me that the
first five rows provided the best sound. Unlike the

first time I had seen this flick, this second viewing of
"Cape Fear" wasn't much fun without "her" to
squeeze my arm every 10 minutes.
Giving up on "Cape Fear," I decided to visit the
concession stand. With its Jetson-esqe orange roof
and spires, the concession stand's architecture was a
cross between the Vatican and Howard Johnson's.
Once inside, I also paused to admire the butterfly
tiles, the retro '50s concession signs, the Muzak and,
of course, the Marble Madness video game. Feeling
sinful, I bought a box of Milk-Duds and an orange
Push-Up.
An older couple stood over the stand, about to
purchase a pack of Goobers. I asked them why they
had chosen the drive-in over an indoor movie the
ater. "It's cheaper," the wife replied. "Besides, we
haven't done it in a while." I pressed no further.
After receiving directions from the concession
workers, I found Bob, the manager, moving boxes of
Red Vines together. He told me about the history of
the 30-year-old drive-in.
Although I listened intently, I was distracted and
saddened by the Red Vines. I thought back to the
time when "she" and I had polished off a pack of the
red licorice at the Stanford Theater.
I thanked Bob and walked briskly out of the con
cession stand and over to the adjoining playground.
I thought about kicking a swing like John Travolta
in "Grease," but that would have scared the kids.
Sitting on a playground horse, I looked around at
the four screens surrounding me and saw Robert De
Niro taking a bite out of someone's cheek, Captain
James T. Kirk in prison and Christian Slater casual
ly blowing away nasty gang members. I felt miser
able.

An empty-trunked vehicle peers over the last of the local drive-in theaters.
Then I looked over to the far left screen
and saw Macaulay Culkin on his deathbed. I
felt better.
Reaching inside my pocket, I found the
orange Push-Up that I had bought earlier. It
wasn't soupy yet, and as I pensively licked it,
I thought about something that Bob the
manager had mentioned earlier. Lamenting
that the Burlingame Drive-in's lease had
expired, he explained that the drive-in was
now operating on a tenuous "month-by
month" basis.
With Bob's words flickering in my mind, I
thought about the billions upon billions of
dates that had enjoyed the drive-in. I gazed
out onto the rows of cars and wondered how
many relationships, marriages and possibly
even families had been started in those lines
of blue lights. Although the drive-in is a bit
tacky, sitting on that horse I realized why it
makes for a great date.
You learn to appreciate those things that
have a fragile existence.
