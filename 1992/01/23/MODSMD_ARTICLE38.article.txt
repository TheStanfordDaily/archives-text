# Almodovar's 'High Heels' brings low laughs
## 
### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
A young girl kills her abusive father by
switching the contents of his bottles of pills.
Grown, that same girl, now a TV news
anchor, kills her husband and confesses live
on that evening's broadcast.
Sound depressing? Actually, it can be truly
funny at times.
Pedro Almodovar's new movie "High
Heels" strides confidently into his tradition of
a wildly satirical blend of the melodramatic
and the ridiculous. But halfway through,
Almodovar reaches for the real-life grit and
emotion of true drama, and the movie wob
bles and falls flat.
The story centers on Rebecca (Victoria
Abril) and how her relationship with her
superstar mother (Marisa Paredes) results in

murder.
Separated because of the mother's commit
ment to singing and acting, the pair reunites
at the beginning of the film. Seeming more
like old friends than parent and child, they
whirl off through the city to get re-acquaint
ed.
The razor-sharp plot twist comes when the
mother learns that Becky's husband is one of
her old lovers. Behind Becky's back, they
begin their affair anew, and when Becky
learns of the betrayal, she shoots her hus
band.
Or did she? Despite Becky's confession on
the evening news, Almodovar keeps a thread
of uncertainty moving through the plot, and
the remainder of the film concerns itself with
unraveling who actually did it.
But instead of focusing on the suspense of
the murder investigation, Almodovar turns to

the relationship between Becky and her
mother to explain how their problems led to
such a gruesome resolution. He pulls hard at
the heart strings, trying to tug sentiment and
sorrow of an audience he has spent the first
half of the film tickling to both laughter and
suspense.
And it doesn't work; the last half of the
movie makes a two-hour film feel like three
hours. The plot demands an empathy and a
sympathy that you just can't muster after an
hour of laughing at a kid murdering her dad.
The switch from comedy to drama doesn't
mesh, and it leaves you in disbelief at the
emotions the characters suddenly profess.
When the lights came up, I felt relieved
instead of entertained. I wanted to go find
Almodovar and make him finish the movie the
way he started it â€” funny, suspenseful and
intriguing. But in the end, I was just bored.
