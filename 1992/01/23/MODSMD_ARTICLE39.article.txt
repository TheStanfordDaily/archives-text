# 'Fried Green Tomatoes' may sound gross, but it's yummy

"Fried Green Tomatoes"
began with suspenseful music
as a crane tugged an old rusted
automobile out from what
appeared to be a very dirty
river.
I did not know what to
expect from the movie â€” I was
just attracted to its weird
sounding title and liked the fact
that it had a primarily female
cast. I also wanted to see Kathy
Bates again. Would she be as
riveting as she was in a role
other than the unforgettable

evil and maniacal killer I had
seen not so long ago in "Mis
ery?"
It took me a while to get
used to the idea that the
unhappy housewife played by
Bates was not going to appear
with a devious glow in her eyes
and a large sledgehammer in
her hands.
Instead, Bates is a despon
dent, unhappy housewife who
feels so hopeless that she
thinks an assertive Southern
woman is a contradiction in
terms. Bates needs a friend, but
her husband would rather watch baseball
alone than sit down and have dinner with
her.
She finds a friend in Jessica Tandy
("Driving Miss Daisy"), an older woman she
meets in the nursing home where she and
her husband frequently visit his aunt.
Bates discovers her assertiveness in
Idgie, the main character in the older
woman's stories of Whistle Stop, a colorful,
small town in Alabama in the 19305.
Whistle Stop's vibrancy comes primarily
from the lively Idgie, played by Mary Stuart
Masterson. Beautiful Idgie had spunk, a lot
of heart and a streak of vulnerability.
Compared to the younger tomboy in
"Some Kind of Wonderful," Masterson's
Idgie is a woman with much more complexi
ty, depth and maturity. Clearly, Masterson
has matured and developed as an actress as
well.
Ruth's goodness and kindness reminded
me of Melanie from "Gone With the Wind."
But unlike Melanie, she learns to enjoy the
wilder side of life: playing poker, getting
drunk, jumping out of trains and such.
Like Bates, I had to wait in the not-so
exciting world of the present in order to
peek into the fascinating world of the
enchanting tomboy Idgie and her friend
Ruth. "Fried Green Tomatoes," directed by
Jon Avnet, is worth $6.50 to see Master
son's Idgie and to observe the town of
Whistle Stop.
