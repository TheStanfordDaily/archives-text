# Music Dept. cuts hit students hard
## But officials say priorities were right 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Members of the Music Depart
ment met news of budget cuts with
confusion and resentment, tears
and stiff upper lips yesterday.
In a Tuesday meeting with
Music Department faculty, deans
of Humanities and Sciences
announced the school's plans to
eliminate the performance aspect
of the school's Doctor of Musical
Arts program, as well as several
small ensemble groups.
Steve Sono, a third-year gradu
ate student in the DMA program,
said he was "extremely disap
pointed" that the program was
terminated. Sono is one of about
25 DMA students enrolled in the
performance practice program.
According to Rafael Ornes, a
second-year student in the pro
gram, "Betrayed is probably a
better word when your chair does
not support your program."
But Music Department Chair
Karol Berger said the decision
was made in favor of those pro
grams in which he thought Stan
ford could excel.
"We are making a decision to
limit the number of specialists.
Instead of doing everything, we
are doing a few things — but
doing them very well."
Students in the program, which

combines theory with performance,
expressed disappointment and
resentment at the decision, saying
Berger's background as a musicolo
gist influenced his opinion.
"The evaluation process was
biased from day one," said Alan
Baker, a third-year graduate stu
dent in music performing arts.
Bringing the bad news
The deans of Humanities and
Sciences will be meeting with the
chairs of different departments
this week to inform them of the
cuts that have been proposed for
their programs. In most cases, the
department chairs will tell the
faculty about the cuts, but
Lougee said she met directly with
the Music Department faculty.
"In this case, I wanted to go to
the department myself and let
them know the reasons why we
made the cuts we made," she said.
But many students and faculty
said yesterday they were confused
and angry. Many didn't under
stand why the program had been
cut or how its elimination would
save the school money.
According to Lougee, the pro
gram's elimination will cut costs by:
• Reducing fellowships granted
to the graduate students;
• Reducing the number of lec
turers needed to give the students
lessons; and
• Eliminating one faculty posi
tion.
Each DMA student currently
receives a fellowship, and the
elimination of the program will
reduce the total number of fellow
ships granted by Humanities and
Sciences, according to Lougee.
She said fellowships in other
departments may be cut as well,
and that these funds "are being
completely redistributed" among
departments.
Lougee said the elimination of
the program will also save money
because of the DMA students
"instructional cost." Since there
will be fewer students taking
music lessons, the department
can reduce the number of lectur
ers while maintaining availability
of classes for enrolled students.
In addition, the position of facul
ty adviser to the program will be
phased out over several years, while
the current students finish the pro
gram. No services will be terminat
ed until all current DMA students
have graduated, Berger said.
Performance for undergrads
Although the graduate-level
program will soon be eliminated,
Berger said performance remains
"an important and integral part
of the undergraduate major."
The undergraduate program
combines performance, music
theory and music history. "This is
why it's a strong and healthy situ
ation," said Berger, adding that
he has "argued with the adminis
tration to keep the major strong."
And Lougee agreed that the
preservation of student access to
music lessons and ensembles —
for majors and non-majors — was
a "very high priority" when they

made budget decisions.
"The changes we are instituting
do not effect in any way our service
to undergraduates or service to the
community as a whole," Berger
said.
But senior Kathye Boline, a
voice student who performs with
the chorale, said the changes "will
affect undergraduates greatly."
Boline said the DMA students
were integral to the excellence of
performing arts groups at Stan
ford, providing them with greatly
needed leadership and energy,
"especially in a department with
so few professors who are so over
worked.
"They bring so much creativity
to the program," Boline said.
"They're here to encourage and
collaborate, to serve as both peers
and examples. Try to imagine any
department without any TA's.
It's preposterous."
Boline said she understood
Berger's position, but regretted
the effect the change would have
on undergraduates.
"The DMA students lead sec
tionals, conduct, plan retreats,
arrange music and are continually
sleep-deprived," Boline said, adding
that they were also responsible for
"single-handedly producing" the
Broadway Cafes put on by the Stan
ford Chorale the past two years.
"Maybe it's pessimistic, but I
just don't know who's going to fill
those roles," she said.
Decision contested, defended
Before this decision was made,
the Music Department offered
two DMA degrees and two Ph.D
degrees. The DMA is a more prac
tically oriented degree, according
to Berger, while the Ph.D is a tra
ditional degree in humanities.
"It is more important at an
institution like ours to have a
Ph.D program than a DMA,"
Berger said.
But Alan Baker, a third-year
graduate student, strongly dis

agreed, saying "Our degree was
judged in name and not in sub
stance. The evaluation process
was biased from day one," he said.
Berger said that while there
are exceptions, DMAs are normal
ly offered through music schools,
whereas Ph.Ds are generally
offered at academic institutions
such as Stanford.
"We should be devoting consid
erable energy to strengthening
those areas of doctoral programs
that have a chance of flourishing
in an academic environment," he
said. "We should not concentrate
on those where we really can't
compete."
Musicology, Berger said, "flour
ishes in an academic environment
like this one," where there are
other strong humanities pro
grams, and colleagues who are lit
erary scholars and art historians.
Berger said music schools are
more appropriate for professional
training in performance because
"they have the kind of critical
mass — in faculty and students —
that provide an environment in
which high-level training in per
formance is possible," he said.
"For the past 30 years our
department has been something
of an anomaly," placing consider
able emphasis on doctoral train
ing in performance, Berger said.
But several students and facul
ty members said that anomaly
was a strength, and categorized
Stanford's program in perfor
mance practice as "pioneering"
and "revolutionary," allowing
students to study music in both
theory and practice.
"I can't help but regret" the
dissolution of the program after
30 years, said Houle. "It's defi
nitely close to my heart."
"If you're serious enough about
music to get your doctorate, Stan
ford is not the place for you,"
Boline said. "Stanford has not gone
that route. I'd like to see it go that
route, but I don't anticipate it."
