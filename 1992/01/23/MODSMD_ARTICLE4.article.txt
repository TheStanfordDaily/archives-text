# Music Dept. cuts hit students hard
## But officials say priorities were right 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Members of the Music Depart
ment met news of budget cuts with
confusion and resentment, tears
and stiff upper lips yesterday.
In a Tuesday meeting with
Music Department faculty, deans
of Humanities and Sciences
announced the school's plans to
eliminate the performance aspect
of the school's Doctor of Musical
Arts program, as well as several
small ensemble groups.
Steve Sono, a third-year gradu

said he was "extremely disap

terminated. Sono is one of about
25 DMA students enrolled in the
performance practice program.

"We are making a decision to
limit the number of specialists.

are doing a few things — but
doing them very well."
Students in the program, which

combines theory with performance,
expressed disappointment and
resentment at the decision, saying
Berger's background as a musicolo
gist influenced his opinion.
"The evaluation process was
biased from day one," said Alan
Baker, a third-year graduate stu
dent in music performing arts.

Sciences will be meeting with the
chairs of different departments
this week to inform them of the
cuts that have been proposed for
their programs. In most cases, the
department chairs will tell the
faculty about the cuts, but
Lougee said she met directly with
the Music Department faculty.
"In this case, I wanted to go to
the department myself and let
them know the reasons why we
made the cuts we made," she said.
But many students and faculty
said yesterday they were confused
and angry. Many didn't under
stand why the program had been
cut or how its elimination would
save the school money.
According to Lougee, the pro
gram's elimination will cut costs by:
• Reducing fellowships granted
to the graduate students;
• Reducing the number of lec
