# Richards and Dead save time in an album
## 
### 
As in life, the single most important ele
ment of all music is time.
From the timing of a band's playing to the
timing of a new album's release, time is of
the essence. Time stretches for 22 glorious
minutes of the Allman Brothers' "Whipping
Post," and it contracts for two-and-a-half
frenzied minutes on the Ramones' "I Wanna
Be Sedated."

In 1984 Bruce Springsteen's success with
"Born in the USA" was enormous because it
embodied the Reagan era. Today fans proba
bly prefer "Nebraska" or "Tunnel of Love."
In 1972 the Rolling Stones' "Exile on Main
Street" was "muddy" and "sloppy." Today
it's one of the rock era's finest albums. Time
changes how we view music.
Of all the bands to emerge from the fecun
dity of the '60s, only two have transcended
the years and roll into the '90s with three
generations of fans hungry for more. As 1991
faded with the economy, Keith Richards, the
man behind one of those bands, and the
Grateful Dead, the other, quietly released
two of the strongest live albums of either
band's career. Fans of both groups will find
these albums timeless.

For many, including myself, Keith
Richards is the Rolling Stones. From being
rock's first elegantly wasted gypsy to being
the fountainhead of dozens of titanic riffs
and classic songs, Richards' total commit
ment to blues-based rock easily makes him
the Robert Johnson or Muddy Waters of his
generation.
On "Keith Richards and the X-Pensive
Winos: Live at the Hollywood Palladium,
Dec. 15, 1988," a 67-minute excerpt (no over
dubs) from his brief "Talk is Cheap" tour,
Keef Riff-Hard shows why he wears one of
music's few crowns. It's all there.
The raw energy of this show makes for
the guitarist's best moment since the Stones'
1970 live classic "Get Yer Ya-Yas Out" — no
small feat. Most of the album's material is
culled from "Talk is Cheap," and even the
songs that waned in the studio, namely
"Whip it Up" and "Rockawhile," get a rau
cous make over.
A kinetic, seven-minute version of the reg
gae tune "Too Rude" from the Stones' "Dirty
Work" shows that Richards' professed love of
reggae is no hoax. His crooning on the smoky
ballad "Make no Mistake" with singer Sarah
Dash puts his own original version to shame,
and Dash's gospel rendition of the Stones'
classic "Time is On My Side" is the finest
recorded version of that song ever.
From exhuming the living dead to pre
serving the Grateful Dead . . .
For those that have never been to a Dead
event — and believe me it's an event, not a
mere show — somewhere in the band's sec
ond set they perform a piece titled "Drums
and Space." During this interlude, which can
last as long as 40 minutes, the band explores

the limitless range of sound made possible
through MIDI programming.
MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Inter
face) makes it possible for a guitar to sound
like a pteradactyl and drums to sound like
the Bronze Age. It's a chance for one and
all to escape the boundaries of rock music
and let the mind wander. As the saying
goes: "Free your mind and your ass will fol
low."
The new Dead album "Infrared Roses" is a
carefully edited collection of these weird and
wonderful sounds, and like Jerry Garcia's
beautiful collaboration with Merle Saunders
on "Blues from the Rainforest," it is an aural
trip that creates its own reality.
Divided into four separate movements
with three shorter pieces within those, the
titles by Dead lyricist Robert Hunter tell his
story. But these movements are open to
interpretation. Here are some of mine:
• "Parallelogram": mid-afternoon sex with
a stranger (safe sex of course);
• "Infrared Roses": Sounds and feels like
Disney's "Elephants on Parade," except the
elephants are on some weird chemicals, not
parade;
• "Sparrow Hawk Row": walking through
an L.A. back alley in Ridley Scott's "Blade
Runner" and encountering a being made of
light as it is giving birth; and
• "Apollo at the Ritz": saxophonist Bran
ford Marsalis escaping a scene from Hitch
cock's "The Birds" to find shelter in a Green
wich village pub only to find himself playing
with the Bird.
Ultimately, "Infrared Roses" is about each
of us hearing our own story. A precious thing
indeed.

wonderful sounds, and like Jerry Garcia's
beautiful collaboration with Merle Saunders
on "Blues from the Rainforest," it is an aural
trip that creates its own reality.
Divided into four separate movements
with three shorter pieces within those, the
titles by Dead lyricist Robert Hunter tell his
story. But these movements are open to
interpretation. Here are some of mine:
• "Parallelogram": mid-afternoon sex with
a stranger (safe sex of course);
• "Infrared Roses": Sounds and feels like
Disney's "Elephants on Parade," except the
elephants are on some weird chemicals, not
parade;
• "Sparrow Hawk Row": walking through
an L.A. back alley in Ridley Scott's "Blade
Runner" and encountering a being made of
light as it is giving birth; and
• "Apollo at the Ritz": saxophonist Bran
ford Marsalis escaping a scene from Hitch
cock's "The Birds" to find shelter in a Green
wich village pub only to find himself playing
with the Bird.
Ultimately, "Infrared Roses" is about each
of us hearing our own story. A precious thing
indeed.

As in life, the single most important ele
ment of all music is time.
From the timing of a band's playing to the
timing of a new album's release, time is of
the essence. Time stretches for 22 glorious
minutes of the Allman Brothers' "Whipping
Post," and it contracts for two-and-a-half
frenzied minutes on the Ramones' "I Wanna
Be Sedated."

In 1984 Bruce Springsteen's success with
"Born in the USA" was enormous because it
embodied the Reagan era. Today fans proba
bly prefer "Nebraska" or "Tunnel of Love."
In 1972 the Rolling Stones' "Exile on Main
Street" was "muddy" and "sloppy." Today
it's one of the rock era's finest albums. Time
changes how we view music.
Of all the bands to emerge from the fecun
dity of the '60s, only two have transcended
the years and roll into the '90s with three
generations of fans hungry for more. As 1991
faded with the economy, Keith Richards, the
man behind one of those bands, and the
Grateful Dead, the other, quietly released
two of the strongest live albums of either
band's career. Fans of both groups will find
these albums timeless.

For many, including myself, Keith
Richards is the Rolling Stones. From being
rock's first elegantly wasted gypsy to being
the fountainhead of dozens of titanic riffs
and classic songs, Richards' total commit
ment to blues-based rock easily makes him
the Robert Johnson or Muddy Waters of his
generation.
On "Keith Richards and the X-Pensive
Winos: Live at the Hollywood Palladium,
Dec. 15, 1988," a 67-minute excerpt (no over
dubs) from his brief "Talk is Cheap" tour,
Keef Riff-Hard shows why he wears one of
music's few crowns. It's all there.
The raw energy of this show makes for
the guitarist's best moment since the Stones'
1970 live classic "Get Yer Ya-Yas Out" — no
small feat. Most of the album's material is
culled from "Talk is Cheap," and even the
songs that waned in the studio, namely
"Whip it Up" and "Rockawhile," get a rau
cous make over.
A kinetic, seven-minute version of the reg
gae tune "Too Rude" from the Stones' "Dirty
Work" shows that Richards' professed love of
reggae is no hoax. His crooning on the smoky
ballad "Make no Mistake" with singer Sarah
Dash puts his own original version to shame,
and Dash's gospel rendition of the Stones'
classic "Time is On My Side" is the finest
recorded version of that song ever.
From exhuming the living dead to pre
serving the Grateful Dead . . .
For those that have never been to a Dead
event — and believe me it's an event, not a
mere show — somewhere in the band's sec
ond set they perform a piece titled "Drums
and Space." During this interlude, which can
last as long as 40 minutes, the band explores

the limitless range of sound made possible
through MIDI programming.
MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Inter
face) makes it possible for a guitar to sound
like a pteradactyl and drums to sound like
the Bronze Age. It's a chance for one and
all to escape the boundaries of rock music
and let the mind wander. As the saying
goes: "Free your mind and your ass will fol
low."
The new Dead album "Infrared Roses" is a
carefully edited collection of these weird and
wonderful sounds, and like Jerry Garcia's
beautiful collaboration with Merle Saunders
on "Blues from the Rainforest," it is an aural
trip that creates its own reality.
Divided into four separate movements
with three shorter pieces within those, the
titles by Dead lyricist Robert Hunter tell his
story. But these movements are open to
interpretation. Here are some of mine:
• "Parallelogram": mid-afternoon sex with
