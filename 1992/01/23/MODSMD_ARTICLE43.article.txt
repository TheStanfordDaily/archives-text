## 
### David Goldenberg 
If you're going to laugh, you
might as well laugh multicul
tu rally.
Tonight at 7:30 in the Uja
maa lounge, three professional
Bay area stand-up comedians
will be performing in the "Bust
the Stereotypes" comedy show.
The performances are not
intended to "make fun of dif
ferent groups, but to have
comedians that are representa
tives of the different (ethnic)
communities," said Ujamaa
Theme Associate Donna
Espeut, who helped organize
the event.
A 1 Manala, who produced
"The Color of Funny," and
opened for Sinbad, Clint Jack
son, who appeared on "Show
time at the Apollo" and the Bay
Area's "Cosmic" Joe Finley who

has appeared at Punchline and
The Comedy Connection come
dy clubs will be performing.
The purpose of the event is
to encourage interaction
among members of the differ
ent ethnic communities on
campus. This is a joint project
put together by the T.A.s of the
four ethnic theme houses in
order "to bridge the gap
between the theme houses."
Instead of merely focusing
on building their own groups'
individual identities, the T.A.s
of the four houses decided to
concentrate on building unity
between the major ethnic
minorities on campus this year.
Last quarter this took the form
of "Raw Fusion"; this quarter
it is "Bust the Stereotypes."

Tonight, 7:30 p.m., Ujamaa
lounge. Free.
