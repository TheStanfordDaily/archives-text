# List of presidential nominees is halved
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Stanford's presidential search
committee hud received more than
450 nominations by the deadline
Friday, but has already reduced its
list of names by more than half,
according to Jean Fetter, the com
mittee's executive vice chair.
"We're rapidly approaching
500 nominations," Fetter said
yesterday. The committee is
"behind on the data entry" and
will not have an exact total until
next week, she said.
"It's the quality, not the quan
tity that counts," Fetter said.
"There are some very, very fine
nominations."
The committee has spent its
last two meetings evaluating
nominees in a process similar to
rolling admissions, considering
nominees before the deadline for
nominations closed. The commit
tee met all day Monday.
Their list is "down by half and
we're making progress," Fetter
said.
"The committee is working
very, very hard" in evaluating

candidates, Fetter said. "We want
to be fair and consider everyone."
Committee members received
a homework assignment at their
last meeting: increasing the infor
mation about nominees through
research and phone calls.
"We're beyond the 'Who's
Who' stage," Fetter said.
The committee's next full
meeting is scheduled for Tuesday.
As usual, Fetter declined to
talk about individual candidates
and would not confirm or deny
that any person has been nomi
nated.
Last week committee members
held a series of meetings for stu
dents, staff and faculty to discuss
criteria that should be used for
the search.
The meetings were poorly
attended: Only 19 staff members,
three faculty members and one
student attended the respective
meetings. A final student meeting
is scheduled for next week.
A search committee at Har
vard University evaluated more
than 600 candidates last year
before selecting current president
Neil Rudenstine.
