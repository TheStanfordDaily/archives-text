A Stanford environmental group is gearing up for
the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development in June by trying to educate the com
munity about the issues the conference will address.
Several international and local student environ
mental groups — including Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford — are preparing for the
summit, which will be held in Rio de Janeiro.
The heads of state from nearly all U.N. nations will
attend the conference, also known as the U.N. Earth
Summit. Their focus will be on economic develop
ment and obtaining treaties concerning climate
change, such as global warming and deforestation.
SEAS, along with the Students Environmental
Action Coalition — an international student organi
zation with offices in over 50 countries — and its
local subdivision, Action for Solidarity, Equality,
Environment and Development, are working to edu
cate students and to promote environmental issues.
"Stanford is in a bubble. We try to break the bub
ble and get issues to students," said junior Tim Choy,
who has been involved with SEAS for three years.
"A lot of students don't know what an Earth Sum-

Mit is," said junior Sri Sola, a coordinator of SEAS.
The 15 students who form the core of SEAS are
working with the local group to sponsor a teach-in,
tentatively planned for the second week of spring
quarter, to discuss the conference. The groups are
also arranging presentations through the Speakers
Tour, a national program sponsored by the coalition
that sends nationally and internationally acclaimed
speakers to campuses.
On Feb. 12, the two groups will sponsor a nation
ally televised panel discussion focusing on the con
ference and the issues that will be presented there.
SEAS representatives hope to get the conference
broadcast on campus television as well.
Coalition members are organizing because they
feel policy makers are not concerned enough about
the environment, according to Stanford graduate
Will Toor. Toor is the coordinator of the coalition's
local subdivision.
Two U.N. Preparatory Conferences for June's
conference were held in Geneva, Switzerland last
year. Representatives from the coalition, including
sophomore Karen Plaut, spoke about what they

environment this June. They are also organizing activities ranging from a teach-in to a speakers' tour to
increase environmental awareness among students.
