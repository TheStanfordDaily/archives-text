## Groups prepare for U.N. conference, try to raise interest 
### Kristina Aberg 
A Stanford environmental group is gearing up for
the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development in June by trying to educate the com
munity about the issues the conference will address.
Several international and local student environ
mental groups — including Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford — are preparing for the
summit, which will be held in Rio de Janeiro.
The heads of state from nearly all U.N. nations will
attend the conference, also known as the U.N. Earth
Summit. Their focus will be on economic develop
ment and obtaining treaties concerning climate
change, such as global warming and deforestation.
SEAS, along with the Students Environmental
Action Coalition — an international student organi
zation with offices in over 50 countries — and its
local subdivision, Action for Solidarity, Equality,
Environment and Development, are working to edu
cate students and to promote environmental issues.
"Stanford is in a bubble. We try to break the bub
ble and get issues to students," said junior Tim Choy,
who has been involved with SEAS for three years.
"A lot of students don't know what an Earth Sum-

Mit is," said junior Sri Sola, a coordinator of SEAS.
The 15 students who form the core of SEAS are
working with the local group to sponsor a teach-in,
tentatively planned for the second week of spring
quarter, to discuss the conference. The groups are
also arranging presentations through the Speakers
Tour, a national program sponsored by the coalition
that sends nationally and internationally acclaimed
speakers to campuses.
On Feb. 12, the two groups will sponsor a nation
ally televised panel discussion focusing on the con
ference and the issues that will be presented there.
SEAS representatives hope to get the conference
broadcast on campus television as well.
Coalition members are organizing because they
feel policy makers are not concerned enough about
the environment, according to Stanford graduate
Will Toor. Toor is the coordinator of the coalition's
local subdivision.
Two U.N. Preparatory Conferences for June's
conference were held in Geneva, Switzerland last
year. Representatives from the coalition, including
sophomore Karen Plaut, spoke about what they

increase environmental awareness among students.
called an appalling lack of action
by policy makers and their tenden
cy to skirt the important issues.
"Currently we are trying to
produce a national youth plat
form of the issues, with some
input from SEAS," to present at
the conference, Plaut said. These
issues will be discussed at a youth
conference to be held in March,
with eight delegates from the
coalition attending. A few of these
students will then continue to the
U.N. conference.
"The U.N. conference could be
tremendously important," Toor
said. "It is a chance to reverse the
suicidal trend that is occurring."

The treaty on climate change
would attempt to stop the trend
toward global warming by first
stabilizing and then reducing
emissions of "greenhouse gases."
By allowing the industrialized
nations to take the lead, Toor
said, it will give the economies of
Third World nations a chance to
industrialize before they com

The deforestation treaty would
establish a maximum rate of
deforestation for each nation.
This includes rain forests as well
as primary forests located in the
United States.
The Earth Summit was sched
uled to correspond with the 20th
anniversary of the first U.N. Con
ference on the Environment,
which was held in Stockholm in
1972.
