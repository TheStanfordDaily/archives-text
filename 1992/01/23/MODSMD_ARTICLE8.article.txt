Berkeley blimps?
What's blue and yellow and flies as far south as San Diego and
as far north as Vancouver?
No, it's not a Cal football player gracing the skies. It's the new
Goodyear blimp sporting its corporate colors, and it has some
Cardinal fans annoyed.
Traditionally the blimp has been painted slate gray with the
black Goodyear logo. But last Friday the blimp was painted bright
blue and yellow — Goodyear's corporate colors — in the blimp
hanger of the Santa Ana Marine Corps Facility, according to
Goodyear spokesperson Richard Sawyer.
But Sawyer said the colors weren't inspired by team loyalties.
"Don't let Cal Berkeley think we support them," Sawyer added.
"Tell them their colors are a copy of Goodyear's colors."
Jon Erickson, the faculty adviser for the Axe Committee, called
Goodyear's move "rather a poor choice on their part."
But he added, laughing, that the colors were "common in nature —
the color of the sky and the color of squished salamanders, so what?"
Axe Committee chair Tim Yee agreed. "It's silly to take it [as
an insult to] Stanford," Yee said. "Lots of schools besides Cal have
blue and yellow as their school colors."
According to Sawyer, the color change is celebratory of
Goodyear's good fortune.
"Goodyear has had a marvelous turnaround in the '90s and
we're trying to spark up the color scheme on the blimps to match
the progress that we've made as a company," he said.

A wait for weight-lifters
Encina gym closed for a few hours Tuesday afternoon so Uni
versity officials could clean up a piece of pipe insulation that may
have contained asbestos.
The insulation, which became soaked in a water leak, disinte
grated and fell to the floor sometime over the weekend and was
discovered Tuesday morning.
Department of Environmental Health and Safety director Tom
Mcßride said the insulation "appeared to contain asbestos,"
although test results had not yet come in.
"It wasn't a very big release," Mcßride said.
Air samples taken in the gym Tuesday morning "showed no
elevated levels of asbestos," according to Mcßride. He also noted
that if the insulation did contain asbestos, it probably would not
have become airborne as it was waterlogged by the leak.
Asbestos is an invisible airborne fiber that can build up in the lin
ings of the lungs and predispose a person to certain types of cancer,
according to David Clarke, a clinical fellow at Stanford Hospital.
Asbestos is found in the pipe insulation of many campus build
ings, but becomes hazardous only when released into the air. The
University's asbestos level is .01 fibers per cubic centimeter of air
— a standard followed by many elementary schools, but far
stricter than the federal standard of .1 fibers set up to protect
employees in the work area.
Mcßride said a private company that specializes in asbestos
removal cleaned up the gym in a few hours.
New campus computer crashes
A compatibility problem between computer codes apparently
caused Stanford's newly installed mainframe computer to shut
down Tuesday morning.
The Forsythe system was back up by 11:30 a.m. but at about
one quarter of its capacity, which is causing the computer to
respond more slowly than usual.
The problems will probably not be resolved until IBM and
Stanford personnel can find the incompatibility.
A similar incompatibility was solved at Stanford Hospital after
a new mainframe was installed there two weeks ago.
The new system will accommodate about 2,000 simultaneous
users when it is at full capacity, compared to 1,471 with the old
mainframe.
