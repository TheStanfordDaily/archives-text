# Local students take on the big issues
## They discuss the Gulf War and the Soviet collapse — and they're fifth graders 
### Leigh Burnside 
While average elementary stu
dents once concentrated on the
three R's and what games to play
at recess, the students in Lisa
Kirkpatrick's fifth grade class
show that today's children are no
longer ignorant of global issues.
When the students of the class
at Escondido Elementary School
were questioned about such
issues as the Gulf War and the
current unrest in Russia, nearly
every hand shot into the air,
accompanied by "Oh! Oh!"
sounds reminiscent of Arnold
Horshack in "Welcome Back Kot
ter."
Many students disagreed with
the war, saying that President
Bush fought for the rights of the
Kuwaitis but wouldn't do the
same for the blacks in South
Africa. Another student argued
that Bush "thinks oil is the most
precious thing in the world."
And discussing the situation in
Russia, a few students — especial
ly Kirill Zagalsky, who came with

his family from the Soviet Union
— spoke vehemently against
Boris Yeltsin, saying that he is
clearly a "power-hungry" individ
ual who took advantage of the
perilous state of the union to fur
ther his own greed for power.
It seems as if the "show and
tell" era has passed. These stu
dents are acutely aware of the
world around them — and they
aren't even 12 years old.
Established in 1954, Escondi
do accommodates almost 400 stu
dents ranging from kindergarten
to the fifth grade. They represent
36 different countries and, for
many of them, Escondido is
where they first learn to speak
English.
A major theme fostered and
developed at the school is global
awareness. In a report presented
to the community during the
1990-91 year, principal Julie
Ryan said that "global education
is the focal point of our curricu
lum."
She further noted that the
"staff and parents .. . strive to

instill in our children an apprecia
tion for the diversity of the
world's people and a belief in
themselves as valued and con
tributing members of our global
community."
The school has a large Israeli
population and many of the stu
dents, such as Tina Deslich, had
close relatives in Israel during the
Gulf War. One Escondido student
was there herself during the cri
sis, prompting concern among the
faculty and students over her
safety.
On the topic of the war, the
students emphasized the fear
they felt throughout the ordeal —
fear for neighbors and family
members who were fighting as
part of Operation Desert Storm.
One student described the aver
age soldier's experience as "an
everlasting nightmare," since he
said he will remember the war
and the fighting for the rest of his
life.
But in the midst of all the
opposition to the war, student
Kristy Wiehe said she sometimes

felt like the only student taking a
pro-war stance, arguing in favor
of the war and the reasons behind
U.S. involvement.
The students had mixed opin
ions about whether the recent
upheaval in Russia would prove
beneficial in the future. They
mentioned the loss of job security
and the devastated economy as
points of concern.
Zagalsky said that a Russian
citizen needs at least 100,000
rubles a year to survive, and with
a single pound of meat costing
1,000 rubles, the effects can prove
devastating. "I remember when
5,000 rubles could buy a car," he
added.
Kirkpatrick's class proved to
be well-informed about environ
mental issues as well. The class,
which puts out the school news
paper every two weeks, is writing
an article on endangered species
in one of the upcoming issues, as
well as covering such topics as
sports, black history and Califor
nia Governor Pete Wilson's
stance on welfare.
