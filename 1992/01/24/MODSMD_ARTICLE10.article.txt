# Gender studies DR gets mixed reviews
## View of world from 'woman's perspective' met with resistance 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
The new gender studies distri
bution requirement has met
mixed reviews among students
and faculty since it took effect for
entering freshmen this fall.
According to freshman Chris
tine Nguyen, the gender studies
requirement is "one of most
important ones because men and
women need to learn to live
together and respect each other."
But some freshmen disagree.
"I find that the requirement is
completely one-sided — male
understanding female — not the
other way around," Matthew
Hungerford said.
"The requirements focus on
everyone but the white male,
excluding them from the prob
lems and issues," he added.
The gender studies require
ment was adopted last November
as part of an overhaul of the
undergraduate distribution
requirement system.
Any course that "critically
examines interpretations of gen
der differences and the relations
between men and women" is
acceptable, according to the origi
nal proposal.
When the requirement was
passed, some professors worried
that there would be too many
requirements or that gender
issues were already adequately
covered.
But the requirement fills a gap
in a society that "doesn't give
enough attention to gender

issues," said Psychology Prof.
Felicia Pratto. "The requirement
gives people a systematic way of
thinking about gender and many
other issues."
Psychology Prof. Laura Car
stensen said the gender studies

requirement is
valuable because
"there are many
myths and pre
conceptions in the
area of gender."
But one prob
lem with the
requirement is
that "it has the
potential to hurt

classes in that there will always be
students who don't want to be
there," Carstensen said.
Sonia Johnson, who teaches a
SWOPSI course on the. women's
movement, was cynical about the
requirement, adding that myths
about male-female relations will
remain. "If any woman tried to
teach honestly, she would be
thrown off-campus. They are not
going to allow anyone to under
mine patriarchy," Johnson said.
In addition to gender studies,
several other changes were made
to the distribution requirements
— adopting the American Cul
tures and World Cultures require
ments and combining the Human
Development, Behavior and Lan
guage with the Social Processes
and Institutions areas.
Gender studies differs from
those requirements because it is
"asterisked," meaning certain
courses that fulfill it can simulta

neously satisfy other require
ments.
As a result, no new gender
studies classes have been created
this year. Instead, "Feminist
issues are brought up in classes
that normally wouldn't do so,"
said Carolyn Schwarz, a senior
feminist studies major. "It's
intended to incorporate greater
diversity in what's available."
The requirement has led some

students to explore the role of
gender in different fields. For
example, freshman Susan Milam
said a course that satisfied the
requirement has taught her to
think about the relationship
between gender and dance.
The courses "demand that
everyone at Stanford study some
thing from the women's perspec
tive, something which is missing
in traditional classes," Milam said.
