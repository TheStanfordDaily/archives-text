# Gender DR means crowded classes

Some feminist studies
majors fear that already over
crowded seminars in the pro
gram may become even more
difficult to get into because of
the new gender studies require
ment.
Students and program ad
ministrators said small semi
nars and advanced classes are
constantly packed.
The new gender studies
requirement may add to the
problem if some students try to
take small seminars to fulfill
the requirement, said feminist
studies msyor Joanna David
son, a senior.
Overcrowding is a particular
problem in Feminist Studies
102 and 103, two infrequently
offered core classes for mayors,
which are supposed to be

taught in seminar form.
Jane Collier, the chair of the
program, said that many of the
smaller seminars offered fall
quarter "were filled very quick
ly."
Davidson said classes may be
even more crowded because of
budget cuts, especially since the
feminist studies core curricu
lum is taught entirely by profes
sors from other departments.
Budget reductions may
force departments to increase
their teaching load require
ments, making it more difficult
for professors to teach in inter
disciplinary programs, said
Carolyn Schwarz, a senior fem
inist studies major.
"It's a rough time because
there are limited resources and
we need to create more lecture
classes so that seminars are not
overloaded," senior Kirsten
Sword said.
