Four years' guaranteed
housing, plus 'green'
bonus if plan approved

IMAGINE A PLACE SO green,
so plush that all freshmen are
guaranteed four years of on
campus housing. This very well
might be the future of Stanford.
After the completion of the cur
rent Manzanita II construction
project, the University will be in a
position to offer the class of '96
four years of guaranteed housing.
No more scrambling to find an
affordable apartment in Palo Alto.
No need to undergo the stress of
"walking on" at the Housing Cen
ter at the start of the year.
In order to meet this long-await
ed goal, the University will have to
agree to extend the current "over
crowding" situation. This would
amount to continuing to house
four people in the Manzanita trail
ers instead of three — a situation
that would cause some discomfort
to more than 200 students who live
in the remaining trailers.
The University may be tempted
to continue to guarantee only
three years of housing, in order to
avoid extending the not-so-com
fortable trailer situation — one
that was declared temporary when
the trailers were parked on the
current site in the 19605.
A guarantee of four years of hous
ing, however, will bring immense
benefits to the University — bene
fits that will more than outweigh the
limited discomfort it will cause.
Four years of housing will not
only benefit those students already
here, but also will aid the Univer
sity in attracting applicants. UC-
Berkeley — which is unable to
guarantee some incoming fresh
men any on-campus housing at all
— drives away many potential stu
dents because they fear being
stranded in a remote location far
from central campus.
The existence or lack of long

term housing is a concern for high
school seniors, who often have
trouble imagining living by them
selves in the next four years.
In the new plan of four years of
guaranteed housing, students
should be obligated to choose one
year during which they must draw
from the bottom of the desired
housing pool. This would make the
system more equitable for all, and
prevent the lucky few from living
in a prized location such as Storey
House or Kimball Hall for all their
years. This way the current hous
ing lottery system could remain
largely intact.
Besides Manzanita 11, the Uni
versity is beginning preliminary
planning stages for a new house on
the Knoll to be completed in 1994.
A student committee has submit
ted a proposal that this house be
used to fill the need for an environ
mentally focused theme house — a
need that was born when the Syn
ergy and Phi Kappa Psi Houses
were closed as a result of earth
quake damage.
The students' proposal details
far-reaching ways in which the new
house can be a model of environ
mentally-sound living and construc
tion. This includes a technology
called earth-berming, in which the
structure is partially submerged to
take advantage of natural insula
tion. The group has also proposed
using a greenhouse to heat the inte
rior, in addition to using other ener
gy-saving techniques.
While such an innovative design
and commitment on the Universi
ty's behalf is unprecedented, both
a desire and a need for such a
"green" house exists on campus.
This new theme house's long-term
benefit could prove invaluable and
demonstrate the University's com
mitment to implementing environ
mentally-sound technologies.
And it would alleviate the tem
porary overcrowding in Manzanita
as well as offer future students the
comfort of knowing they have the
option of living on campus
throughout their entire under
graduate careers.
