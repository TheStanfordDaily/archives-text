Myth of'pampered athlete 9 paints wrong picture

Â£ TANFORD HAS FINALLY
shown its true colors to the
nation with the much-vaunted
return of Bill Walsh to the Cardinal." The
preceding statement in Daniel Lee's letter
to The Daily (Jan. 22) is completely accu
rate. Athletic Director Ted Leland should
be applauded for hiring Walsh. Stanford's
tradition of overall excellence continues.
Bill Walsh is recognized by some as
the greatest football mind ever. There
can be no doubt that he is a great foot
ball coach. The potential for excellence
for the football team has never been
greater. Walsh's name will certainly
bring more All-Americans to Stanford.
With a greater recruiting pool the team
should have a better chance at winning
the Pacific-10 Conference and playing in
the Rose Bowl. A Rose Bowl berth
results in increased revenue.
Walsh's hiring alone resulted in sev
eral hundred calls for season tickets dur

ing a period in which ticket sales are typ
ically dormant. This type of increased
revenue could help to bring the recre
ational facilities up to the standards of
Harvard or Georgetown, schools
renowned for their recreational facilities.
One of the most unbelievable facets of
Stanford is that a university that boasts
a first-rate faculty and a student body
that is second to none can also maintain
an athletic program that consistently is
among the elite in the country. Nearly
every team contends for a national
championship.
Lee has "heard plenty of arguments
that football is a money-generating
enterprise that funds many other pro
grams." Instead of merely wondering
just how true this is, he might try listen
ing to these arguments rather than sim
ply hearing them. The football team is
one of the few teams that brings money
into the Athletics Department.

Like all major universities, Stanford
uses money generated from football to
support the budgets of some of the
national championship-caliber teams
mentioned. The remainder of the budget
comes from private donors.
The insinuation that athletic scholar
ships restrict financially burdened stu
dents from attending Stanford while the
"pampered athletes" drive around in
sporty BMWs is a narrow-minded stereo
type. The Athletics Department pays the
University each quarter for every athlete
who is on scholarship.
All of the scholarships come from
endowments and from the Buck-Cardi
nal club, an Athletics Department fund
raising group. The scholarship fund does
not restrict any of the departments on
campus. Scholarships are not retained in
exchange for the cuts in either the Art
or Drama Department.
These scholarships provide the ath-

letes with an opportunity to attend
Stanford. Most come from average fam
ilies and can't afford to attend Stanford
any more than the average student can
afford to pay $20,000 each year. Fur
thermore, these athletes form teams
that help separate a Stanford educa
tional experience from an Ivy League
education.
At Stanford you can associate with all
of the Nobel laureates that you would at
an Ivy League institution, but you also
get to cheer for your football team in a
bowl game. You have the opportunity to
live with countless Ail-American athletes
and Rhodes scholars, world record hold
ers and national merit finalists. These
opportunities make Stanford unique.
Any athlete on scholarship relishes
the opportunities that Stanford pre
sents.
