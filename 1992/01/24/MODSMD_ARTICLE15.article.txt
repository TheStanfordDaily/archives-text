# Salamanca program offers students true cultural immersion

When The Daily published an article
on the closing of the Salamanca overseas
program, it neglected to include one sen
tence describing the program in Spain:
The University looses a great deal by
ending this overseas program. Salaman
ca is the cheapest and most valuable of
Stanford's programs abroad, yet Tom
Heller, director of Overseas Studies, has
chosen to terminate it.
The University keeps one woman
employed to run Salamanca and spends
only $70,000 per year. Considering the
huge staffs and budgets of the campuses in
Oxford, Berlin and Florence one wonders
how much the decision to end the Spain
program springs from budget constraints.

If Salamanca's small budget reflected
a shoddy program, I would wholeheart
edly support the cut. However, this is
not the case. Students attend classes at
the University of Salamanca and live in
the Spanish equivalent of dorms. No
other Stanford program provides stu
dents with this level of immersion or
with such rigorous academics.
The Spanish Department views the
program as an invaluable resource. I
learned more about myself and about
academics during six months in Sala
manca than I did in the two previous
years at Stanford.
Judging from the low cost and the
high academic rewards of the Salamanca
program, I fear that the wrong political
reasons lie behind the decision. Keeping
Salamanca may not be as glamorous as
starting a program in Moscow, and it
may not provide professors with comfort
able sabbaticals, but the University sup
posedly made budget cuts with the ser-

vices most valuable to students in mind.
As far as overseas programs are con
cerned, Salamanca presents the best
Stanford has to offer.
