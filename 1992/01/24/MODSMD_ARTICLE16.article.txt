# Ending the hypocrisy: Kennedy and cronies should serve hard time
## 
### 
In an age of narrow-minded morality,
we tend to be very quick to tell others
how to behave. However, our actions tend
to speak louder than our words. Telling
people not to take or deal drugs, mug peo
ple or steal cars isn't very believable
when we wink at business-suited crooks.
At Stanford there's been systematic
charging of frills and luxuries to govern
ment grants. What happens when people

finally get caught? Apologies and denials
of intent are mixed with calls for better
accounting.
Does anyone seriously believe that a
person can hold a wedding reception and
never ask who paid? This "anywhere, but
me" attitude enabled the purchase of
antiques at the expense of taxpayers. This
isn't the accidental failing of underlings.
It's the deliberate encouragement of
tricky accounting for one's own personal
benefit.
If this society is ever going to deal seri
ously with crime by the poor, it first must
deal with its rich and educated criminals.
That means time in Lompoc for Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy and the
rest of his rip-ofT crew.
Until people actually see Wall-Street
and other white-collar criminals doing
time, "tough on crime" looks more like
"hold down the poor."
