## A 						new world perspective 
### 
At the end of my freshman
year, I decided that I had to get
away from Stanford. I love the
place and the people, but by winter quar
ter every year I'm ready for a new fish
bowl. So, needless to say, when I got into
Stanford-in-Oxford I was quite pleased.
It was hard to believe I was really going
somewhere new. I worried about standing
out, not only as a minority but also as a for
eigner. I had heard that Oxford was harsh,
and I wondered how I would fare. Like a
little kid who stays up all night before the
first day of school, I spent winter break
fighting off a chronic case of the what-ifs.
But that all changed as the plane began
to circle Gatwick International Airport.
At first I thought I was feeling the effects
of the free drinks supplied on my flights,
but then I realized the cars were on the
wrong side of the road for a reason. I was
in a shiny new world with all new things
and new people. It was all I could do not to
look at people in bright red T-shirts about
to shout my name when I got off the
plane. 1 almost felt like a freshman again.
It has been a few weeks since then, and
parts of the shine have gotten brighter.
After the Taco Bell architecture of Stan
ford, it's quite different to be in a place
where the buildings are centuries old and
have crests. I've seen where Shakespeare
lived and attended amazing plays and
operas. Every now and then I have to
pinch myself because now when I say the

City, I mean London not San Francisco.
It's astonishing how huge the world
seems when you realize that where you
come from is but a small corner of a much
larger room. It's quite different when you
are the foreigner and people tell you to
slow down or repeat yourself because they
cannot understand you. It's like being a
child again when people laugh at your mis
takes, but kindly teach you the right way.
Even some of the problems, as scary as
they are, enhance the newness. I'm used to
hearing about drugs and gang wars. Here
the gangs are much more organized and
political, though, as some friends of mine
found out when they were evacuated from
a shopping mall and a bomb was found.
But some of the shine has proven to be
false glitter. America has her division
between rich and poor, but it's an eco
nomic thing. In England it's a class thing.
I heard a lot about the English reserve
and decided the first night to meet at
least two new people.
I met four: two from Canada, one from
Australia and one from Germany. With an
air of sadness and a touch of bitterness,
my new German friend, a two-year Oxford
veteran, explained to me that few people
here would go out of their way to make or
keep my acquaintance because of what
they would see as our class differences.
I had also been excited to come to
Europe because of its supposed lack of
racial problems. It was going to be nice to

be at a place where race was not an issue.
But I overwhelmingly learned that Britain
is actually behind America in this area.
We know we have a problem and we
attempt to deal with it; Britain simply
refuses to admit it has a problem and lets
tensions and anger go unchecked. If the
scene I saw last week at a Ziggy Marley
concert in London, where the blacks and
whites in front of me began to exchange
racial insults and nearly got violent, is any
indication, the potboiler is about to blow.
One thing they told me before I left
was that I would come to love Europe,
but miss America. Even now, when I see
the Frojolais coupons in the copies of The
Daily they send over or read letters from
my friends, I miss the Farm immensely.
I wish the exchange rate would go
down and that the English would import
Kool-Aid and talk to God about nation
wide central heat. But I have come to love
this place, if only for the amount of com
parison it offers. I guess this is the price
you pay and the present you get when
you leave the little fishbowl and go swim
in the big pond.
