## Choice will implement budget cuts

University President Donald
Kennedy will select an interim
provost by the Feb. 13 meeting of
the Board of Trustees, Kennedy
said after yesterday's Faculty
Senate meeting.
"This needs to be done quick
ly," he said.
The new provost, who will suc-

ceed James Rosse
on April 16, will
serve several
months after
Stanford's next
president takes
office, Kennedy
said. A provost
close to Stan
ford's faculty
"will help to

bridge the presidential transi
tion," he added.
Kennedy told the senate that a
simultaneous turnover of both
positions might impede continu
ity of University values.
"This provost will in a sense
transport a seed across that tran
sition and plant it on the other
side," Kennedy said.
Kennedy said after the meeting
that the interim provost will not
be a candidate for the permanent
position. "I think it's very impor
tant that this be understood as an
interim position," he said.
That restriction may be impor
tant because the interim provost

This provost will in a
sense transport a
seed across that
transition and plant it
on the other side.'
â€” Donald Kennedy

will implement the budget pro
posals that Kennedy and Rosse
will present to the Board of
Trustees on April 15. The interim
provost is expected to have to
make difficult decisions, and not
being a candidate will help limit
administrative politics.
Kennedy invited suggestions
and nominations from faculty.
Rosse is leaving to become
president and chief executive offi
cer of Freedom Newspapers Inc.,
a media chain based in Irvine,
Calif. Many faculty had expected
Rosse to resign shortly after the
new president took office.
Kennedy said that Rosse had
decided three weeks ago to resign
April 15 regardless of whether or
not he received the new job.
Faculty members have said
that likely candidates for the
interim position include Eco
nomics Prof. Kenneth Arrow,
Business Prof. Charles Holloway,
Assoc. Engineering Dean Charles
Kruger, Statistics Prof. Gerald
Lieberman and Education Dean
Michael Smith.
