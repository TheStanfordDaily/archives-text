## Trojans win 82-72, crush Card's Cinderella ranking 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Cinderella Stanford's sordid
love affair with the Associated
Press top 25 ended in tragedy last
night as USC knocked the swoon
ing No. 24 Cardinal back to reali
ty, 82-72, at Maples Pavilion.
Trojan guard Harold Miner
danced away with the glass slip
per, scoring a game-high 30
points on 10 of 17 shooting,
including three of five from three
point territory. The defeat
snapped a fairytale nine-year
Stanford win streak over USC at
Maples Pavilion and dropped the
Cardinal (11-2, 3-1) into third
place in the Pacific 10 Conference
entering Saturday's 3 p.m. show
down with undefeated UCLA.
"Now I know how the hostages
felt when they were released,"
said USC George Raveling,
whose Trojans moved into second
place with a 4-1 Pac-10 record,
12-3 overall. "I guess the law of
averages was finally on our side."
Stanford's most effective
defense on Miner was a blanket
ing box-and-one applied by guard

Kenny Hicks at the end of the
first half, but Trojan guards
Duane Cooper and Lorenzo Chat
man picked up the shooting slack.
"We tried to minimize the
number of times he had the ball,
and that worked sporadically,"
said Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery, who started sophomore
Brent Williams on Miner in a
straight man-to-man. "The oth
ers hurt us just as much as Miner
did."
USC shot 52.8 percent from the
field, including nine three-point
ers, scoring 10 more points than
any previous Stanford opponent.
Stanford prepared for Miner all

week, but when he scored nine
points in the opening four min
utes, it was clear the Pac-10's lead
ing scorer would not be stopped.
Twelve minutes into the game,
Baby Jordan had scored as many
points as the entire Stanford team
and the Trojans led 27-14.
"I felt that Miner would cancel
Keefe out and it would come down
to our other guys against their
other guys," Raveling said. "We
kept mixing our defenses, trying
to keep the ball out of Keefe's
hands, and we kept them out of a
good offensive rhythm."
