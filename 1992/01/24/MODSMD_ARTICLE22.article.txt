## Trojans win 82-72, crush Card's Cinderella ranking 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Cinderella Stanford's sordid
love affair with the Associated
Press top 25 ended in tragedy last
night as USC knocked the swoon
ing No. 24 Cardinal back to reali
ty, 82-72, at Maples Pavilion.
Trojan guard Harold Miner
danced away with the glass slip
per, scoring a game-high 30
points on 10 of 17 shooting,
including three of five from three
point territory. The defeat
snapped a fairytale nine-year
Stanford win streak over USC at
Maples Pavilion and dropped the
Cardinal (11-2, 3-1) into third
place in the Pacific 10 Conference
entering Saturday's 3 p.m. show
down with undefeated UCLA.
"Now I know how the hostages
felt when they were released,"
said USC George Raveling,
whose Trojans moved into second
place with a 4-1 Pac-10 record,
12-3 overall. "I guess the law of
averages was finally on our side."
Stanford's most effective
defense on Miner was a blanket
ing box-and-one applied by guard

Kenny Hicks at the end of the
first half, but Trojan guards
Duane Cooper and Lorenzo Chat
man picked up the shooting slack.
"We tried to minimize the
number of times he had the ball,
and that worked sporadically,"
said Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery, who started sophomore
Brent Williams on Miner in a
straight man-to-man. "The oth
ers hurt us just as much as Miner
did."
USC shot 52.8 percent from the
field, including nine three-point
ers, scoring 10 more points than
any previous Stanford opponent.
Stanford prepared for Miner all

week, but when he scored nine
points in the opening four min
utes, it was clear the Pac-10's lead
ing scorer would not be stopped.
Twelve minutes into the game,
Baby Jordan had scored as many
points as the entire Stanford team
and the Trojans led 27-14.
"I felt that Miner would cancel
Keefe out and it would come down
to our other guys against their
other guys," Raveling said. "We
kept mixing our defenses, trying
to keep the ball out of Keefe's
hands, and we kept them out of a
good offensive rhythm."

With Stanford's offense stalled,
USC exploded on an 18-2 first
half run. Keefe — who led Stan
ford with 28 points — was limit
ed to seven shots in the first half,
but guard Peter Dukes drained
four three-pointers, keeping the
Cardinal within seven at the half,
35-28.
"We came out a little tenta
tive, and when they were aggres
sive we didn't stand up and look
them in the face," said Dukes,
who made one of eight from the
field in the second stanza to fin
ish with 14 points.
A steal from Keefe and a
breakaway layup by Marcus Lol
lie cut the Trojan lead to 37-36,
but Miner responded with a 17-
foot fadeaway baseline jumper
and a three-point play to spark
USC on a 22-7 run.
Forward Lorenzo Orr's thun
derous dunk with 10:33 left gave
USC its biggest lead of the game
59-43 and Stanford never got
closer than 10 points.
"We simply got out-played

tonight," Montgomery said .
"Either their aggressiveness or
our tentativeness — we just
weren't in the flow."

Cinderella Stanford's sordid
love affair with the Associated
Press top 25 ended in tragedy last
night as USC knocked the swoon
ing No. 24 Cardinal back to reali
ty, 82-72, at Maples Pavilion.
Trojan guard Harold Miner
danced away with the glass slip
per, scoring a game-high 30
points on 10 of 17 shooting,
including three of five from three
point territory. The defeat
snapped a fairytale nine-year
Stanford win streak over USC at
Maples Pavilion and dropped the
Cardinal (11-2, 3-1) into third
place in the Pacific 10 Conference
entering Saturday's 3 p.m. show
down with undefeated UCLA.
"Now I know how the hostages
felt when they were released,"
said USC George Raveling,
whose Trojans moved into second
place with a 4-1 Pac-10 record,
12-3 overall. "I guess the law of
averages was finally on our side."
Stanford's most effective
defense on Miner was a blanket
ing box-and-one applied by guard

Kenny Hicks at the end of the
first half, but Trojan guards
Duane Cooper and Lorenzo Chat
man picked up the shooting slack.
"We tried to minimize the
number of times he had the ball,
and that worked sporadically,"
said Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery, who started sophomore
Brent Williams on Miner in a
straight man-to-man. "The oth
ers hurt us just as much as Miner
did."
USC shot 52.8 percent from the
field, including nine three-point
ers, scoring 10 more points than
any previous Stanford opponent.
Stanford prepared for Miner all

week, but when he scored nine
points in the opening four min
utes, it was clear the Pac-10's lead
ing scorer would not be stopped.
Twelve minutes into the game,
Baby Jordan had scored as many
points as the entire Stanford team
and the Trojans led 27-14.
"I felt that Miner would cancel
Keefe out and it would come down
to our other guys against their
other guys," Raveling said. "We
kept mixing our defenses, trying
to keep the ball out of Keefe's
hands, and we kept them out of a
good offensive rhythm."


A! Green — Daily
Freshman Andy Poppink goes for two but draws an offensive foul for charging Harold Miner.
With Stanford's offense stalled,
USC exploded on an 18-2 first
half run. Keefe — who led Stan
ford with 28 points — was limit
ed to seven shots in the first half,
but guard Peter Dukes drained
four three-pointers, keeping the
Cardinal within seven at the half,
35-28.
"We came out a little tenta
tive, and when they were aggres
sive we didn't stand up and look
them in the face," said Dukes,
who made one of eight from the
field in the second stanza to fin
ish with 14 points.
A steal from Keefe and a
breakaway layup by Marcus Lol
lie cut the Trojan lead to 37-36,
but Miner responded with a 17-
foot fadeaway baseline jumper
and a three-point play to spark
USC on a 22-7 run.
Forward Lorenzo Orr's thun
derous dunk with 10:33 left gave
USC its biggest lead of the game
59-43 and Stanford never got
closer than 10 points.
"We simply got out-played

tonight," Montgomery said .
"Either their aggressiveness or
our tentativeness — we just
weren't in the flow."
