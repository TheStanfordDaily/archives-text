# NBA scouts scrutinize Keefe's every move

The big boys came to the party last night at
Maples Pavilion, and they certainly enjoyed the
show. Representatives from 12 National Basketball
Association teams, and NBA chief scout Marty
Blake, were in attendance to watch the top two scor
ers in the Pacific 10 conference, USC's Harold
Miner and Stanford's Adam Keefe, display their
offensive talents.
Both stars finished with similar numbers: Miner
had 30 points and 10 rebounds, while Keefe tallied
28 points and 10 boards. Miner scored his points
from the field on many difficult outside shots,
including three of five from three-point range.
Yet, even though Keefe was not able to establish
himself inside because of the Trojans' straight-up
defense, he still chalked up impressive stats, and left
scouts singing praises.
"He's a very good player. He was invited to play in
the Orlardo All-Star Classic, which features the top
(college) players in the country," said Marty Blake, the
NBA's director of scouting. "He works hard, runs the
court well, and has great presence. He plays for a good
coach in a good league .... We're looking at him as
someone who can have a good career in the league."
Mike Farmer, scout for the Houston Rockets,
said of Keefe, "He's a fine player who does it all. He
sees the floor, has good court awareness, and knows

where he is at all times. He has a nice (shooting)
touch, and is a great team player."
Perhaps the nicest comment out of all the
superlatives about Keefe was made by Washington
Bullets scout, Bill Gordon. "If I were coaching, I'd
like to have him on my squad because I know he
comes to play every time on the floor and that's an
asset that not every player has."
The scouts main complaint about Keefe was that
he was not shooting enough. Scott McGuire, scout
for the New York Knicks, observed that he liked
Keefe's ability to shoot the 15 foot shot, but recog
nized that Keefe was not getting his usual number
of shots in this particular game.
As for Miner, whom some have dubbed "Baby
Jordan," the accolades poured in as well.
"He's a great player. He can score, he's got good
size, and is strong. Plus, they're (Stanford) playing a
box-in-one on him and he's still getting his shots off,"
remarked Stan Novak, scout for the Detroit Pistons.
When asked about Miner, Farmer replied,
"Where do I start? He's a great shooter— an 'in
your-face' type guy — and has strong arms, big
hands, and good lateral speed. But he needs to devel
op his ball skills. He's going to have to do a lot more
dribbling to be an off-guard in the NBA."
Keefe did not feel any extra pressure knowing
that he was being watched by the scouts. "It doesn't
really effect me one way or the other. I just want to
show them that I play hard."
