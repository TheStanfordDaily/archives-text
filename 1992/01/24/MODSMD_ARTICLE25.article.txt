# Card men to grapple with Titans
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
The Stanford wrestling team will face
some tough competition tonight at 7:30
in Burnham Pavilion in their second
home dual meet in as many weeks. The
competition will be the Titans of Cal
State-Fullerton, who sport a very com
petitive squad.
"Fullerton has a tough program," said
Stanford wrestling head coach Chris
Horpel. "They have some very good
lightweights, and some pretty good guys
at heavier weights as well."
The Cardinal lightweights will be in
the best possible shape for the task of
facing Fullerton's challenging
lightweights. After severely juggling the
weight line up last week, Horpel will
have all wrestlers back at their normal
weights. Unfortunately, that adjustment
will reveal the holes in the Cardinal line
up, bringing about forfeits in three
weight classes.

'Fullerton has a tough
program.'
— Coach Horpel

At 118 pounds, the Cardinal will see
the regular in this weight class, junior
Phil Nowick. After an impressive win in
the meet against UC-Davis, Nowick will
be in good shape to face the Titans.
His twin brother, Dave Nowick, will
be back down to his normal weight at
126 pounds, after winning last week at
134. Similarly, sophomore Jay Jackson
will be back down at his normal 134
pounds, after wrestling at 142 last week.
With the two grapplers back down at
their regular weights, Stanford will have
a better chance to tally points in the
lighter weight classes.

The Cardinal will forfeit at 142 pounds
as the regular at this weight, sophomore
Lance Johnson, remains injured.
Junior Dave Sacks will wrestle at 150
pounds for Stanford, and should contin
ue to be a valuable surprise addition to
the middle weights this year in his deci
sion to forego his redshirt year.
At 158 pounds, freshman Salaan Mar
tin will see action for the first time since
taking a second place finish at the Aggie
Open two weeks ago.
Senior Matt Topham will wrestle at his
familiar 167 pounds after winning at 177
pounds last weekend. However, Horpel
states that before the 167 pound match —
if it looks possible for the Cardinal to win
the meet — Topham will wrestle at 177
pounds, with junior Greg Green compet
ing at 167 pounds. Otherwise, Stanford
will forfeit the 177 pound class.
Senior Mark Graham will wrestle at
190 pounds, where he continues to
impress. The heavyweight class will see a
forfeit from Stanford.
