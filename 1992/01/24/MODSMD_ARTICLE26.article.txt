# Swimmers prep for Trials in Cal meet
## 
### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
The countdown to regional
and national championship
meets comes to a close tomor
row as No.l Stanford takes on
the Golden Bears at deGuerre
Pool.
Cal is not expected to put up
much of a fight against the
undefeated Cardinal, who has
already defeated such top-flight
opponents such as then-No. 1
Texas, UCLA and USC by
healthy margins.
Coach Richard Quick plans to
use this meet to prepare his
team for the upcoming Olympic
Trials, which will be held in Indi
anapolis March 1-6. Although
the meet will obviously involve
much less pressure than
Olympic trials, it will otherwise
simulate the environment the
swim team can expect in March.
"(The Cal meet) will be a
dress rehearsal for Olympic Tri
als," junior Anne Mahoney said.
"Most of us will swim in only one

event, while in most meets we
would compete in several. We're
going to work on focusing in on
only one event."
Mahoney will swim only the
100-meter backstroke, the same
event she will race in Indianapolis.
Although Stanford and Cali
fornia are archrivals in most
sports, the Weenies are not a
national power when it comes
to swimming, so the seemingly
unstoppable Cardinal should
make short work of their Bay
Area foes.
"Cal sucks. It should be an
easy meet," said a close associate
of several of Stanford's top
swimmers.
The dual meet is Stanford's
last of the season. Next up for
the Stanford swimmers is the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships, which will be held in
two weeks at Long Beach. After
Olympic Trials, the NCAA
Championships will be held
March 19, 20 and 21 in Austin,
home of the two-time defending
NCAA Champion Longhorns.
