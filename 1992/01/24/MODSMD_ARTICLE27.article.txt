# Fencers charge on to Lions' den

### Steven Salcedo 
After beginning the season with a resounding
victory in the Stanford Collegiate Open, the men's
and women's fencing squads charge into battle
today against the likes of such teams as Duke, Cor
nell, North Carolina, John Hopkins, Northwestern,
U.S. Naval Academy and, of course, Penn State at
the Penn State Invitational. These established East
Coast teams are perennial powers and always pre
sent the Stanford teams with stiff competition. In
fact, the hosting Nittany Lions are the two-time
defending NCAA overall champions.
"[The Penn State Invitational! will be a lot more
difficult than our last competition," said Leonard
D'Amico, team captain and member of the saber
squad. D'Amico hinted that the team had the forti
tude to hold its own against its opponents and that
it will probably "scare a lot of teams."
Sam Kim, a consistent performer in men's foil,
added, "I'm certain the East Coast competition will
be tough, but I expect the team to do well."
The men's team will not be at full strength head
ing into competition since the number one man on
the foil squad, Olympic hopeful Nick Bravin, is cur
rently competing independently in international
tournaments. However, Jeremy Nelson, a member
of the men's epee, is hopeful that the "(team] can
make up for Nick's loss."
Dave Brody, another senior member of the epee
squad, has full confidence in Bravin's replacement,
