# Fencers charge on to Lions' den

### Steven Salcedo 
After beginning the season with a resounding
victory in the Stanford Collegiate Open, the men's
and women's fencing squads charge into battle
today against the likes of such teams as Duke, Cor
nell, North Carolina, John Hopkins, Northwestern,
U.S. Naval Academy and, of course, Penn State at
the Penn State Invitational. These established East
Coast teams are perennial powers and always pre
sent the Stanford teams with stiff competition. In
fact, the hosting Nittany Lions are the two-time
defending NCAA overall champions.
"[The Penn State Invitational! will be a lot more
difficult than our last competition," said Leonard
D'Amico, team captain and member of the saber
squad. D'Amico hinted that the team had the forti
tude to hold its own against its opponents and that
it will probably "scare a lot of teams."
Sam Kim, a consistent performer in men's foil,
added, "I'm certain the East Coast competition will
be tough, but I expect the team to do well."
The men's team will not be at full strength head
ing into competition since the number one man on
the foil squad, Olympic hopeful Nick Bravin, is cur
rently competing independently in international
tournaments. However, Jeremy Nelson, a member
of the men's epee, is hopeful that the "(team] can
make up for Nick's loss."
Dave Brody, another senior member of the epee
squad, has full confidence in Bravin's replacement,
the highly touted freshman
recruit, Geoff Donaker: "Geoff is
a very strong fencer."
The women's team is led by
junior captain Lana Kang and
sophomore Thea Wojtkowski,
both of whom were instrumental
in the sound drubbing of oppo
nents in the home tournament
held two weeks ago. While the
other teams are of a much higher
caliber, the Cardinal should be
competitive at Penn State, as well.
The tournament this weekend
is an important stepping stone
for the Stanford teams with
regard to both the Western
Regionals in early March and the
NCAA finals. "Half of the season
takes place on this day," Nelson
said. "This weekend will be a
good indicator of how we will do
at NCAA [finals}."
Brody notes, "On the whole,
we're considerably better now
than in the past." It is this mod
est confidence which should pro
pel the fencing team to a strong
finish tomorrow at Penn State.
