Cardinal 89

Cougars 71

the Pac-10 standings. Stanford and Wash
ington are tied for second.
The Cardinal got its third conference
win by playing unconscious basketball in
the first half of last night's game, and ade
quate basketball in the second half.
"Unconscious." As in 66.7 percent field
goal shooting, 75 percent on treys, and
100 percent on free throws. The Cougars
shot only 30.8, 40 and 62.5 percent in the
same respective categories. As a result,
Stanford led 50-23 at halftime.
"Adequate." As in being outscored 48-
39 in the second half, and still winning by
18 points.
At 7:30 p.m. tomorrow against the
Huskies, "adequate" and "unconscious"
may have to be the same thing.
The Stanford-Washington women's
basketball rivalry has achieved leg
endary status.
Five years ago, in coach Chris Gob
recht's second year in Seattle, her squad
finished second to USC in the Pac-10.
Gobrecht had plans to make the confer
ence her own. So the following year the
Huskies won the Pac-10. The next step
was the Final Four.
But Tara VanDerveer's Cardinal foiled
her plans, going undefeated in the Pac-10
the next year and handing the Huskies
two of their three conference losses. Gob
recht had to settle for second place.
Two years ago the rivalry fully
matured. Washington boasted its best
team in the history of the school. So did
Stanford. When the teams played each
other for the first time that year, the
Huskies came into Maples Pavilion with

only one loss and a school-record No. 7
national ranking. Stanford was undefeat
ed and ranked No. 2.
The Cardinal blew the Huskies out of
the top-10, 102-62.
Afterwards, Gobrecht was quoted as
saying, "We hate Stanford." She later
apologized under pressure from Washing
ton's Director of Athletics.
The next time the teams met, the
Huskies had again climbed to No. 7. The
Cardinal was still undefeated with more
than 20 wins and ranked No. 2. In front of
7,704 rabid fans in Hec Edmundson Pavil
ion, the Huskies upset the Cardinal 81-78.
Gobrecht was more conciliatory this
time. "We had to play our best game of the
year to beat them. We are not the best
team in the country. They might be."
Her hunch was correct. Stanford did
not lose another game and eventually was
crowned national champion.
Last year the teams met first in Seattle.
The Huskies had lots of little basketballs
passed out to the fans that said "32-1,"
which was Stanford's final record for its
championship year. The Cardinal beat the
Huskies 75-71.
When Washington came to Stanford,
the Cardinal boasted the second-longest
home winning streak in women's basket
ball at more than 40 games. The Huskies
snapped that streak on a desperate
granny shot as the buzzer sounded, 69-68.
But the Cardinal got the last laugh,
coming from behind to crush the Huskies,
73-47, in the NCAA Western Regional
semifinals. Afterwards Gobrecht vowed
that she would never again be stopped
short of the Final Four.
This year, with the Pac-10 more com
petitive than ever, each game becomes
more crucial, and once again when cardi
nal and white meets purple and gold, play
ers, coaches and fans will be going all-out.

not lose another game and eventually was
crowned national champion.
Last year the teams met first in Seattle.
The Huskies had lots of little basketballs
passed out to the fans that said "32-1,"
which was Stanford's final record for its
championship year. The Cardinal beat the
Huskies 75-71.
When Washington came to Stanford,
the Cardinal boasted the second-longest
home winning streak in women's basket
ball at more than 40 games. The Huskies
snapped that streak on a desperate
granny shot as the buzzer sounded, 69-68.
But the Cardinal got the last laugh,
coming from behind to crush the Huskies,
73-47, in the NCAA Western Regional
semifinals. Afterwards Gobrecht vowed
that she would never again be stopped
short of the Final Four.
This year, with the Pac-10 more com
petitive than ever, each game becomes
more crucial, and once again when cardi
nal and white meets purple and gold, play
ers, coaches and fans will be going all-out.

No. 21 California upset No. 10 Washing

overtime decision is welcomed by the Car

the Pac-10 standings. Stanford and Wash
ington are tied for second.
The Cardinal got its third conference
win by playing unconscious basketball in
the first half of last night's game, and ade
quate basketball in the second half.
"Unconscious." As in 66.7 percent field
goal shooting, 75 percent on treys, and
100 percent on free throws. The Cougars
shot only 30.8, 40 and 62.5 percent in the
same respective categories. As a result,
Stanford led 50-23 at halftime.
"Adequate." As in being outscored 48-
39 in the second half, and still winning by
18 points.
At 7:30 p.m. tomorrow against the
Huskies, "adequate" and "unconscious"
may have to be the same thing.
The Stanford-Washington women's
basketball rivalry has achieved leg
endary status.
Five years ago, in coach Chris Gob
recht's second year in Seattle, her squad
finished second to USC in the Pac-10.
Gobrecht had plans to make the confer
ence her own. So the following year the
Huskies won the Pac-10. The next step
was the Final Four.
But Tara VanDerveer's Cardinal foiled
her plans, going undefeated in the Pac-10
the next year and handing the Huskies
two of their three conference losses. Gob
recht had to settle for second place.
Two years ago the rivalry fully
matured. Washington boasted its best
team in the history of the school. So did
Stanford. When the teams played each
other for the first time that year, the
Huskies came into Maples Pavilion with

only one loss and a school-record No. 7
national ranking. Stanford was undefeat
ed and ranked No. 2.
The Cardinal blew the Huskies out of
the top-10, 102-62.
Afterwards, Gobrecht was quoted as
saying, "We hate Stanford." She later
apologized under pressure from Washing
ton's Director of Athletics.
The next time the teams met, the
Huskies had again climbed to No. 7. The
Cardinal was still undefeated with more
than 20 wins and ranked No. 2. In front of
7,704 rabid fans in Hec Edmundson Pavil
ion, the Huskies upset the Cardinal 81-78.
Gobrecht was more conciliatory this
time. "We had to play our best game of the
year to beat them. We are not the best
team in the country. They might be."
Her hunch was correct. Stanford did
not lose another game and eventually was
crowned national champion.
