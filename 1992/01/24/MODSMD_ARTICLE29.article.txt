## Budget cuts, ASSU banking also contended at meeting 
### Kristina Aberg 
Budget cuts and inadequate graduate housing
were among the issues discussed at an ASSU town
meeting last night.
Four senators met with six graduate students to
get input on what they see as problems facing Stan
ford.
One concern among the participants was what
they called a lack of adequate housing for graduate
students. Several students complained that under
graduate housing is built at the expense of graduate
housing.
"When they built Rains, they took away much of
Manzanita, Mirrielees and Cro Mem," said graduate
senator Douglas Bone, adding that the issue has
been brought to the attention of University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy.
University budget cuts were also discussed. One
graduate student said he believes Stanford should
preserve the departments that can generate large
research grants and make larger cuts from the
humanities rather than the sciences.
Undergraduate senator Jason Snyder disagreed,
saying, "To sacrifice innovation and creativity at the

'Some students complained that

housing.'

undergraduate level would be a mistake."
Several participants expressed a desire to see
selective, rather than across the board, cuts. "If you
focus on selective cuts, you can maintain the highest
(academic] quality possible," Bone said.
Graduate senator James Brown, however, ques
tioned whether the University can maintain high
standards for education and still reduce its deficit.
The graduate students also touched upon the
issue of ASSU funds. One participant suggested that
the ASSU could provide financial support for certain
programs that are slashed by the University.
In addition, participants challenged the efficiency
of the ASSU conducting the banking for student
dorms. Snyder said that this may be discontinued
within the next two years.

Research saves lives.
