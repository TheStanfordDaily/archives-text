# No diploma for Thomas
## Degree held until misconduct investigation ends 
### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
The University is withholding the
degree of senior Stuart Thomas pend
ing an investigation of his conduct,
according to Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole.
Thomas, who was scheduled to
graduate after fall quarter, pleaded
guilty Dec. 18 to misdemeanor charges
of statutory rape and providing alco
hol to a minor in connection with a
Sept. 22 incident in Stern Hall. He is
scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 30.
"I can't comment on what we are
doing in the investigation," Cole said.
"But we are conducting an investiga
tion and we are holding his degree.
Those two things are facts.
"All I can say is that we are looking
into questions about his conduct," Cole

said. "This would be
true of any student"
whose conduct is
questionable, she saiH
In misconduct
cases where the stu
dent has graduated,
the University can
withhold the degree
for a designated num
ber of quarters. The

University President makes the final
decision and sets the time period. A
degree can also be revoked.
Cole said the outcome of the court
case will have no effect on the Uni
versity investigation.
Sexual assault prevention and
education coordinator Susan Epstein
said that although she does not know
the full details of the case, she expects
that "the University will be looking

into forcible rape and the question of
consent," while the criminal case only
involved statutory rape.
The University process is differ
ent, Epstein said. "There could be
times that a (district attorney J or a
court would drop a case or acquit the
person, but the University would still
investigate the case on its own."
Thomas' lawyer, Melvin de la
Motte, said he didn't think the Uni
versity should take any action against
Thomas.
"I suppose that this is part of the
procedure and they're entitled to
investigate on their own, but I don't
think they should take any stronger
action. It's already been resolved in
the courts," he said.
De la Motte said that he had not
been contacted by the University
about the investigation.
