Dear Bug Me,
1 have a friend who talks like
he's on fire. Is it possible that he
will spontaneously combust ?

Spontaneous Human Combus
tion (SHC) is a rare, but serious
illness that affects an unknown
number of people each year.
A guy in one of the high schools
in my home town burst into
flames during a study hall my
senior year. It was a big deal on TV
and stuff, with a lot of theories
about the cause. But the explana
tion I liked best was that the bore
dom of study hall had agitated him
into a state of hyper-elevated body
temperature.
A 1987 article in the summer
issue of the Skeptical Inquirer
examined the phenomenon of
SHC at some length. (I swear I'm
not making this up.) Apparently,
victims of SHC are generally
obese, tobacco smokers, alcoholics
or heavy users of some other
chemical depressant.
Now, this gets kinda graphic —
but certainly no grosser than a
photograph of a 300-pound ovari
an cyst. (Was there anyone who
wasn't eating lunch when he or
she saw that thing on the front
page of The Daily?) According to
the theory, the victims begin by
drinking themselves into uncon
sciousness while smoking. The
ashes from their cigarettes fall

onto their clothing, which catches
fire. And this fire melts some of
the body's fat.
Of course, the victims must
either be in a complete stupor
from the alcohol or have already
been killed by the toxic fumes
from the burning clothing — in
order not to be aware that parts of
their bodies are being melted
away. A "candle effect" ensues,
with the clothing, or the over
stuffed couch that they're sitting
on, acting as the wick and the body
fat acting as the wax.
So, all that remains is a burned
spot on the couch where the body
used to be. But the rest of the
couch remains uncharred and can
only burn when fed by the fuel of
melted body fat.
Now please feel free to continue
eating vour lunch.
