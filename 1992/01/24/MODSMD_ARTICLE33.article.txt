# To avoid boredom, be bold â€” try snowboarding

OK, so I'm not the most coordinat
ed person in the world, but I still go on
ski trips. I've been skiing for most of
my life, and by now I can get down the
hill fairly easily, often without severe
ly injuring anyone at all.
But after spending a day on the
slopes last Saturday, I started to feel
that I was too in control. Sure, I could
have gone bonsai down a black double
diamond and wiped out in a spectacu
lar explosion of skis, poles and body
parts, but somehow I just didn't feel
up for it.
So I rented a snowboard instead.

I realize that at this point those of
you who know me are probably saying,
"Ken! You can't even ride your bike
across campus without getting your
own arm caught in the spokes and
crashing into a police car! How the hell
did you live to write this article?"
It wasn't easy. For those of you
unfamiliar with the snowboard appa
ratus, it's basically a board that was
designed for the sole purpose of inflict
ing bodily harm. One handy feature is
that unlike those found on skis, the
bindings on the snowboard don't pop
off your feet in a crash, which allows
your lower legs to be twisted in all
sorts of directions that I hadn't previ
ously believed possible.

But I'm getting ahead of myself;
first I had to get up the mountain.
Sadly enough, ski areas were not
designed with snowboards in mind,
meaning that it's impossible to get on
a lift when both feet are in their bind
ings, and it's extremely hard to get off
a lift when both feet aren't.
Luckily, I managed to discover the
technique of sitting on the back of the
snowboard and sledding down the off
ramp, eventually coming to a stop by
crashing into an unsuspecting skier.
By lunchtime, after hundreds of
similar lessons, I had progressed to the
point where I could seriously injure
any part of my body at will. The main
problem was turning, but I finally fig

ured it out: You throw yourself to the
ground, reposition your board and get
up again.
But I don't mean to make it sound
terrible. The actual snowboarding was
great fun; plus I got to meet tons of cool
people. It seemed that us snowboarders
were like one big family, all of us in it
together, and all of us sharing the same
unsightly splotches of snow on our
rears. We'd lie side by side on the hill,
gathering up the strength to pick our
selves off the ground while striking up
intimate conversations like: "So, which
buttock is hurting you the most?"
