# Energy conservation study planned

### Chris Eisenberg Staff writer 
Faced with projected growth in
energy demand over the next five
years, Stanford officials are about
to begin an energy management
study to look at alternative ways
of meeting Stanford's needs.
Dennis Culp, associate vice
president for facilities, said the
selection process is now in its
final stages and the University
will award the study to a chosen
consulting firm in the coming
weeks. The 45-60 day project will
begin shortly thereafter.
The total cost for the study is
projected to be from $100,000 to
$300,000.
The study will focus on several

alternatives. The two most likely
options, however, may be expan
sion of the University's existing
cogenerator plant or creation of a
second satellite facility some
where else on campus.
Culp said Stanford's approach
to long-term energy demand
includes a policy of demand man
agement — conservation.
"We are trying to be as energy
conscious as we can," Culp said.
This includes encouraging conser
vation, opening windows in build
ings instead of using air condi
tioning and rescheduling heavy
energy demands away from peak
times.
"We expect to work hard to
reduce peak demands," he said.
Conservation is not only the

environmentally preferred alter
native, it is also the cheapest.
Culp said that by reducing costs,
the University can delay major
facility improvements.
"Budget cuts are intensifying
our efforts to reduce and delay
capital expenditures," he said.
Still, new facilities will likely
be needed. The energy manage
ment plan will examine how
best to meet these growing
demands.

Despite its 49-megawatt capability, the Cardinal Cogeneration Plant, the facility which provides Stan
ford with electricity, water and steam, had trouble meeting Stanford's energy demands last summer.
