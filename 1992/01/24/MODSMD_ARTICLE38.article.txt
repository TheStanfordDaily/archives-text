Bike theft suspect nabbed
Another would-be bike thief was caught in the act Tuesday
morning, according to Stanford Police. The bike, which has been
returned to its owner, would have been the twenty-eighth stolen
from the campus in two weeks.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said a University
employee saw Robert Adam Halbach, 19, of San Jose severing the
bike's cable lock with bolt cutters. The bike was locked outside
the ERL laboratory.
When the employee attempted to stop him, Niemeyer said
Halbach fled, disappearing over a chain link fence at a nearby con
struction site.
Police later spotted the suspect walking in the area. He was
arrested for petty theft and possession of burglary tools upon
identification by the witness.
"I guess the moral of the story is for people to call us immedi
ately if they see anyone lurking around the bike racks," Niemey
er said.
He also cautioned against the use of cable locks, urging stu
dents to use more durable U-locks.
"The cables are really easy to defeat," he said. "Any bolt cut
ters will go through them."
The police do not believe this incident to be related to other
recent bike thefts, including one attempted theft Saturday. "It's
two random individuals," Niemeyer said. "We don't see any con
nection between them."
