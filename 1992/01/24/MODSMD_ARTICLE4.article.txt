# Power struggle: University in dispute with energy provider
## 
### Chris Eisenberg Staff writer 
Continued tension between Stan
ford and its principal energy provider
has left a $9 million expansion facili
ty sitting idle as a two-year-old, $69
million lawsuit against the Universi
ty nears its first day in court.
The lawsuit alleges that Stanford
has breached its contract with Cardi
nal Cogen, which operates the cogen
erator facility on campus, by not pay
ing for seismic reinforcements and
underpaying for electricity.
In addition, a $9 million expansion
to the facility, completed last spring,
has not yet come-on line as the Uni
versity and Cardinal Cogen negotiate
an operating agreement.
The cogenerator facility provides
chilled water, steam and electricity to
the Stanford campus. Although Stan
ford owns the land the plant sits on,
Cardinal Cogen owns the facility and
contracts its services to the Universi
ty. Cardinal Cogen is a joint venture
of General Electric and Kaiser Engi
neers, Inc.

The lawsuit was filed in December
1990, and both sides will meet in
court Feb. 11 to set a trial date.
University officials deny any
breach of contract. "We don't believe
that the lawsuit has merit," said
Senior University Counsel Jasper
Williams. He would not comment on
the specifics of the case.
The dispute centers on the
amount of money Stanford pays Car
dinal Cogen for its electricity. Cardi
nal Cogen believes it has the right to
charge Stanford a higher rate than
the University thinks it has to pay.
In addition, Cardinal Cogen wants
the University to pay so-called
"demand charges," which Stanford
does not believe it is contractually obli
gated to pay.
A second major issue involves the
cost of making the facility conform to
California earthquake building codes.
Since the plant provides power to Stan
ford Hospital, California law requires
that the plant meet strict earthquake
safety requirements. Cardinal Cogen
claims the University owes $18 million
for these seismic reinforcements.

Cardinal Cogen also alleges that
Stanford failed to pay the cost of
installing equipment to connect the
cogenerator facility to the Pacific Gas
and Electric electrical system.
Officials at Cardinal Cogen could
not be reached for comment, and rep
resentatives from General Electric
declined comment on the lawsuit.
Williams said the lawsuit is cur
rently in the discovery stage, mean
ing both sides are taking depositions
and exchanging documents.
An out-of-court settlement remains
possible. "We have had some settle
ment discussions," Williams said.
"And before it's set for trial we will
undoubtedly have additional settle
ment discussions."
The lawsuit has not disrupted the
plant's everyday operation for the
University.
