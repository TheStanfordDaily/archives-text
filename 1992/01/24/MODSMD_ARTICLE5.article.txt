# 'Green' house proposed as student dorm Structure would save money over long haul, students say

Future dormitories at Stan
ford may come equipped with
their own greenhouse and gar
dens, complete waste recycling
and extended use of solar heat
ing and lighting.
All of these features are possi
ble with current technology,
according to a new group dedi
cated to designing environmen
tally-conscious student housing.

"Stanford lacks residences
that exhibit environmentally
conscious design," said senior
Myia Johnson, who founded the
group. Group members hope to
convince the University to build
their "eco-house" on a site near
the Knoll.
The University intends to
build several houses on this site
for 125 to 150 students to
replace the spaces lost after the
Synergy and Delta Tau Delta
houses were destroyed following

the 1989 earthquake.
Group members researched
different sorts of environmental
technology and studied con
struction techniques used in
communities of houses in Santa
Cruz and Lake Tahoe and in
research buildings at Merrit and
Humboldt Colleges.
Johnson and her group have
written a set of guidelines for the
structure and interior of the
house. They include using recy
cled materials for building; build

ing small hills, or earth berms,
around the house to insulate it;
installing low-flow faucets; and
having natural ventilation.
"These ideas are economically
feasible but are often overlooked
because the University is not in
the mind-frame to plan long
term," said freshman Lara
Kueppers, a participant in the
group. "If you compile the ener
gy bills ... over an 8-10 year
period, you'll see huge savings."
To encourage the University
to take a longer look at these
ideas, Johnson joined the Pro
gram Advisory Group, which
will make the recommendation
as to what kind of housing
should be built on the Knoll site.
The group's vision of the eco
house would require active
interest and participation by the
residents. "Ideally this will be a
residence that is a co-op size,"
Johnson said.
Regardless of the future use of
the house, though, she said it
would be useful as "a sort of envi
ronmental lab experimenting with
such technology as hot water heat
ing systems that save energy "
But the University generally
tries to design houses' struc
tures independent of their pro
gramming, said Robin Hensley,
new residences project coordina
tor and head of the advisory
group. Initial structural plan
ning tries to "give flexibility to
housing so that it is possible to
make the house without limiting


Senior Myia Johnson looks out on the Knoll site, where she hopes a new evironmentally-conscious
"eco-house" will be built to replace the destroyed Synergy and Delt houses.
