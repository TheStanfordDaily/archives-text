# Taxis off hook after bash
## 
### Kimberly Chrisman Staff writer 
The Greek Judicial Board has found
that the Theta Xi fraternity was not
responsible for a Nov. 9 incident in which
Stanford Police shut down a raucous party
at their house.
Board members said they expect Dean of
Students Michael Jackson to approve their
recommendation that the fraternity should
be disciplined for the "questionable events"
that marred its party.
Among the problems cited were underage
drinking, excessive noise and a food fight
with residents of neighboring Slavianskii
Dom. In addition, two bicycles were stolen
from Slavianskii and thrown from the fra
ternity house roof by alumni members.
"A very important factor in our recom
mendation was the mature manner in
which the Taxis acted," said Aimee Meisen
zahl, the Intersorority Council vice-presi
dent and Judicial Board co-chair.
"They took every precaution necessary
to ensure a safe and enjoyable function, but
things happen," she added.
According to a report by Theta Xi Presi
dent Aaron Racine, the disturbances were
caused by visiting alumni and UCLA Theta
Xis. The party was organized and run in
compliance with state and University regu
lations, he wrote.
"The bicycle incident was indeed stupid
and regrettable, but carried out by alumni
who do not fully realize the tenuous posi
tion that this house holds on the campus as

far as social events are concerned," the
report says.
The fraternity has repaid the $201.72 in
damages to the bikes and has asked that
the two alumni not attend future house
social events.
The board's investigation was originally
expected to take a week. But other disci
plinary cases and winter break delayed its
review.
"It wasn't the decision that took so long,
just bad timing," Meisenzahl said. "We began
our investigation over the last few weeks of
fall quarter. With exams and the break, we
had a hard time getting everything tied up."
She said the investigation of a Nov. 12
Sigma Chi party where party decorations
violated the fire codes was not given prece
dence over the Theta Xi case in the board's
review process, although the board
released its review of the Sigma Chi inci
dent two weeks ago.
"They both raised serious issues, but we
knew from the beginning that we had dif
ferent plans for the Sigma Chis," Meisen
zahl said.
Sigma Chi was placed on social probation
until it revises its alcohol policy and institutes
a fire safety program. Each member must
also perform two hours of public service.
Although the board's report absolves
Theta Xi of all responsibility for the inci
dent, it does ask that the fraternity develop
and submit several proposals regarding
alumni guests, crowd control and relations
between housed fraternities, their neigh
bors and the police.
