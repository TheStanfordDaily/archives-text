# Diploma dilemma: 'responsible' debate
## Format of diplomas, budget concerns top Fac Sen discussion 
### Howard Libit Steve McCarroll Senior staff writers 
What's in a word? If that word is on
a Stanford diploma, it means a lot, the
Faculty Senate decided yesterday
afternoon.
Beginning this spring, the word
"responsibilities" will be added to the
"rights, privileges and honors" previ
ously granted on diplomas.
"If there are rights to claim fellow
ship in the academic community,
then there is also a responsibility to
act like" a member, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy said. "With the
privileges (of a Stanford degree)
there goes a certain reciprocal obliga
tion to give something back to soci
ety."
But English Prof. Nancy Packer
said the change "is not going to make
one iota of difference."
Faculty members raised other con
cerns about the current diploma for
mat during the report of the Commit
tee on Academic Appraisal, which rec
ommended the new wording.
History Prof. Peter Stansky criti
cized last year's decision to remove
the signatures of department chairs
from the diploma â€” an appeal that

gained the support of
several other faculty.
But Acting Regis
trar Jack Farrell said
the decision was a
"cost-saving measure"
because it is "very
time-consuming pro
cess" to get the de
partment heads to
come to Old Union to

sign the diplomas.
Stansky also asked the commit
tee to reconsider the design of the
diploma to make it "more in keep
ing with the modern University"
rather than the old Gothic script
currently used.
In other senate business, Kennedy
formally announced the hiring of
football head coach Bill Walsh at a
"salary not yet guessed by any news
paper."
On further questioning by English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz as to why Walsh
would receive a high salary in a time
of a budget deficit, Kennedy said,
"None of the funding going to Bill
Walsh was available to other sources"
in the operating budget. However, he
refused to specify Walsh's salary, as is
customary with all University
employees.

Kennedy also quoted Babe Ruth in
response to Rebholz's criticism of the
symbolic message sent by paying the
football coach more than the Universi
ty president.
Ruth was once asked at a press con
ference how he justified making more
than the president of the United
States.
"I had a better year," Ruth said.
The senate also briefly discussed
the budget-reduction process. The
next meeting will focus entirely on
budget-cutting proposals.
Summaries of cuts within all of the
schools and administrative areas will
be released Wednesday.
Faculty members expressed con
cern about both the length of future
budget meetings and the participation
of faculty in the process.
Senate Chair James Sheehan told
Kennedy that it is "difficult to know
when it is still possible to effect
changes and at what level."
Kennedy said the budget proposals
"can still change," although he said he
"does not think the senate can take
line-by-line responses."
Sheehan and the senate steering
committee will likely decide what
limits might be placed on future bud
get debate before the next meeting.
