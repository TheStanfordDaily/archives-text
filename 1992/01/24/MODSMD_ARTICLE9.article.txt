Unemployment-benefits claims on the rise
WASHINGTON (AP) — First-time claims for unemployment
benefits jumped by 46,000 during the week ending Jan. 11, with
32 states reporting significant increases in the number of workers
being laid off, the government said yesterday.
I he Labor Department said that on a seasonally adjusted
basis, 447,000 Americans filed applications for jobless benefits,
up from 401,000 in the previous week.
Analysts had expected a gain given the fact that it was the first
week in which the unemployed had five full days to file applica
tions following two holiday-shortened weeks.
Sodomy law keeps gays out of police force
DALLAS (AP) — The City Council voted early yesterday to
keep a ban on hiring homosexuals to the police force as long as a
state law against sodomy remains in effect.
Police Chief Bill Rathburn has said his department has to
abide by the law, which makes sodomy a misdemeanor.
Gay rights activists said they were disappointed, but remained
confident the decision would be overturned because a state judge
has ruled the 112-year-old sodomy law unconstitutional.
A state appeals court is expected to decide later this month
whether to uphold the December 1990 ruling.
The council voted 10-5 to keep the police hiring ban in place as
long as sodomy remains illegal. The decision was reached at 2
a.m. yesterday after council members listened to scores of gay
rights activists and people who support the ban.
World rallies around starving ex-Soviets
WASHINGTON (AP) — Forty-seven nations large and small
agreed yesterday on a massive "global effort" to rescue millions of
hungry people in the former Soviet Union with humanitarian
shipments of food and medicine.
The United States will airlift supplies to the 12 former
republics with 54 sorties beginning Feb. 10. The food aboard will
include 38.4 million pounds left over from the Persian Gulf war,
enough for 16 million meals. A million doses of Desert Storm
antibiotics will be carried by the C-5 and C-141 cargo planes, as
well.
