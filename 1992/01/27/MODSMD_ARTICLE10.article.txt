# AIDS forum challenges stigma, prejudice

### Sandra Lim 
Though an estimated 1.5 million U.S. resi
dents are believed to be infected with the HIV
virus, the American public is still a sleeping
giant when it comes to responding to AIDS,
according to Peter Carpenter, a visiting scholar
at the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics.
What he wants to know is when the giant
will awaken and what it will see when it opens
its eyes.
HIV-related issues such as this were debat
ed and discussed Saturday at the Sixth Annu
al Stanford Health Policy Forum at the Stan
ford Medical Center.
Organized by Stanford medical students,
the conference, "A Healthy Response to AIDS:
Policy Priorities for Medicine," dealt with
issues ranging from coordinating treatment
and research to discussing the social responsi
bilities of physicians who treat AIDS patients.
The purpose of the conference was to con
front familiar and unfamiliar issues about
AIDS, find constructive ways to challenge the
epidemic and encourage more people to
become involved in AIDS health policy,
according to Lee Sanders, one of the pro
gram's coordinators.

"The conference brought to attention a lot
of things that needed to be addressed about
the HIV virus," said Monica Uddin, a junior
majoring in human biology. "I found that the
issues were very relevant, and I think the
forum helped to abate some of the stigma and
prejudice associated with AIDS."
Keynote speaker Daniel Hoth, director of
the AIDS division at the National Institutes of
Health, outlined the changing demographic
trends in AIDS.
Hoth said there has been a marked
decrease in gay men diagnosed HIV-positive,
but there has also been an overall increase in
risk-taking behavior since 1983. Of those
newly infected, 50 percent are people of color.
Hoth noted that it has been seven years
since AIDS was identified. Since then, infected
people are living longer — thanks to research
efforts and more effective treatments.
But Hoth is concerned with the complacen
cy about AIDS that he senses on campuses
and among the general public. "There is an
increased sense of us vs. them," he said. The
general mood seems to be "it's them who get
it, not us."
"The variety of the topic discussions about
AIDS here just shows you that this is an issue

that affects us all," said Joanne Wong, a junior
majoring in Human Biology and Economics.
"You just can't put it off."
The forum's panel discussion dealt with the
rights and responsibilities of HIV-positive
individuals.
Topics addressed by the panel ranged from
the political needs of HIV-positive individuals
to the ethnic and socioeconomic dimensions of
AIDS policy.
"I thought the discussion of the cultural
and ethnic side of AIDS was very valuable,"
Wong said. "When implementing policy for
AIDS, it's necessary to take different cultures
and their thoughts and fears about healing
into consideration. It just can't be overlooked."
The panelists included an attorney from
the American Association of Physicians for
Human Rights; the executive director of the
California Association of AIDS Agencies; a
county AIDS program director; and a Health
Correspondent from the Wall Street Journal.
In addition to the panel discussion and the
group discussion sessions that featured vari
ous speakers, the conference also had infor
mation booths organized by Ye Olde Safer Sex
Shoppe and the Stanford University Hospi
tal's Health Library.
