# Symposium re-evaluates women's 'weaknesses'
## 
### Marie Save de Beaurecueil 
Stereotypical female traits that
have traditionally been viewed as
women's weaknesses are actually
their strengths, according to
Carol Gilligan, a Harvard profes
sor and best-selling author.
The idea of looking at the
strength of women and the devel
opment of emotional resiliency
was the focus of Saturday's sympo
sium, "The Resilient Woman:
Strength in the Face of Adversity,"
which was held for an audience of
about 500 in Kresge Auditorium.
Gilligan, author of "In A Dif
ferent Voice," a pioneering best
seller that explores women's
moral development, was the sym
posium's keynote speaker.
According to Gilligan, women's
strengths include their emotional
awareness and capacity to con
nect with others — qualities that
had previously been viewed as
signs of weakness.
The Spring Foundation, a Palo
Alto-based women's research orga
nization, hosted the symposium to
present the results of research
sponsored by the foundation.

Emily Lyon, the foundation's
president and founder, said in an
interview that "through my work
with the Woodside Women's Hos
pital, with women who suffered
emotional, physical and sexual
abuse, I became interested in how
women were surviving, in the pos
itive aspects of women."
Lyon said, "There have been
too many studies on the negative
— on the problems — and not
enough research on the positive."
She said she began asking herself:
"How can we promote the devel
opment of knowledge about how
to treat women?"
Mary Moore, the symposium's
chair, said in an interview that
"the decision to focus on
resilience, or the strength of
women, evolved [froml the nega
tive literature focusing on the
weakness of women."
The foundation, Moore said,
seeks "to promote a cross-disci
plinary dialogue among clinicians,
researchers and social workers.
This is a milestone in promoting
such communication."
Gilligan's keynote address,
called "Joining the Resistance:

Moments of Resilience in Women's
Psychological Development," con
veyed the findings of her research.
"Women's experience has been
missing in empirical research. This
experience must be brought out
and communicated," Gilligan said.
Gilligan's speech focused on her
research about adolescent girls and
the implications of her findings for
the development of women. She
said adolescence is the crucial time
for women's psychological develop
ment because this is when girls
first begin "the dissociation of their
feelings with the real world. They
feel they want to know what they
know, and express it — but this
could be politically bad. But if they
don't express it, they are in trouble
with themselves."
Gilligan discussed the adolescent
girls' struggle to "bridge the gap
between experience and what has
been socially accepted as reality."
Her studies focus on "what
helps girls emerge politically and
socially strong from this time,
that is, what helps them move
from resilience to resistance." She
said her studies of adolescent girls
have major implications for thera

py for women.
"Education is the time-honored
means of social change, an alter
native to revolution," Gilligan
said. "We must study this move
from resilience to resistance and
celebrate our capacity to thrive
under these adverse conditions."
Gilligan concluded her speech
by saying, "Women cannot turn
inward, but must turn outward.
By remaining political, it can
bring a whole new order of living
into the world."
After Gilligan's speech, re
searchers presented their findings
on various aspects of women's per
severance and resilience through
specific difficult life circumstances.
Lisa Aspinwall of the Univer
sity of Maryland spoke about how
women manage as first-genera
tion college students. Terry
Wolfer, a Ph.D. candidate at the
University of Chicago, presented
his findings on women's respons
es to community violence in pub
lic housing complexes.
The final speaker was Jeanette
Ickovics, a research scientist at
Yale University who focused on
women coping in the face of AIDS.
