# Fighting fire, befriending families
## Sierra camp means adventure for student workers 
### Kristen Schmid 
Not many summer jobs give
you the opportunity to fight fires
with University President Donald
Kennedy.
As a counselor at the Stanford
Sierra Camp, recent graduate
Donnovan Somera had that
chance.
"It was a few days after the
camp was over, and I pulled the
fire bell," he recalled. One of the
camp buildings had caught on
fire. "I got a hose and Don
Kennedy and I sprayed down the
back entrance" to the food storage
room, preventing the fire from
spreading to the dead trees near
by, Somera said.
However, this is not a typical
event at the Lake Tahoe camp,
which hosts more than 3,000
Stanford alumni, employees and
their families each summer. The
camp, which is also open for two
conference seasons, charges
$2,000 a week for a family of four.
Sierra Camp employs 55 Stan
ford students as either children's
counselors or, like Somera, as
instructors in specific areas such
as windsurfing or arts and crafts.
"I'd spend about 9 to 12 hours
a week on the water, but the rest
of the time I did a lot of mundane
tasks like working in the dining
room or cleaning the cabins Sat

urday mornings — which isn't
too much fun if you party on Fri
day night," Somera said.
"Even though you're stuck on
a little piece of land for 10 weeks
with 60 to 70 people, this camp is
a great place to be — I'd do it for
the water-skiing alone."
The counselors bring their
individuality to the camp; for
instance, Somera is a disc jockey
and brought his equipment. Oth
ers led workshops on beadwork
and basketmaking.
Other activities include tennis,
hiking, sailing, birdwatching and
rock climbing. Once a week a dif
ferent Stanford professor comes
to speak on his or her research or
on a Stanford issue or event.
For Somera, the best part of
the camp was the guests. "They'd
talk about Stanford in the '60s,
the life of a certain professor or a
project in a foreign country," he
said. Camp guests have included
former Secretary of State George
Shultz, Olympic ice skater Brian
Boitano's trainer and Kennedy,
who also leads hikes.
"It's not like a hotel — you
have lots in common with the
other people when you arrive, so
it's a guaranteed good time," said
Alumni Association President Bill
Stone.
The camp offers activities for
the children so adults can have free

time. "My father, brother, hus
band, two-year-old daughter and I
all went, and there was something
for everyone," said Janet Wright of
the Alumni Association.
Senior Christina Tavella has
worked at the camp for two sum
mers as a children's counselor,
and is now working on the inter
viewing committee.
Tavella remembers leading a
group of seven- and eight-year
olds. "On the very first day of
camp I took the kids on a hike and
two brothers got in a fight," she
said. "The younger one left by
himself' and she spent the after
noon looking for him, although he
had gone straight home.
For many people the camp is a
yearly tradition. "I'm looking for
ward to going back the same week
and seeing the same people,"
Wright said.
"I think our children would
murder us if we ever tried not to
go there," Stone said. "We've
gone off and on since 1977, and
we don't want to lose our priori
ty." Reservations for summer
spots are usually booked by early
February. "The first thing I did
when I got my 1992 calendar was
to call and schedule my family for
week 10," he said.
Since other families also come
the same week each year, Stone
added, "It's like a reunion."
