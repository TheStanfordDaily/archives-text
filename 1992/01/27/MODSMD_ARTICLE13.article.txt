U.N. to cut Iraq's arsenal
MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) — Arms experts from
10 nations assembled yesterday in Bahrain before
heading to Baghdad to begin destroying Iraq's
chemical arsenal.
Heinz Dieter Jopp of Germany, the leader of
the 19-member U.N. team, said it could take up to
two years to eliminate the more than 125,000
weapons, including more than 46,000 chemical
filled bombs, shells and warheads.
Under the Persian Gulf War cease-fire accords,
U.N. teams are supervising the destruction of all
of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
Clinton talks adultery on TV
PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) - Bill and Hillarv

Clinton told the American people in an extraordi
nary television interview yesterday that it has
been difficult to sustain a marriage in the public
eye, but that rumors of infidelity should not dis
qualify his run for the presidency.
Three weeks from the critical New Hampshire
primary, the Arkansas governor sought to put to
rest any lingering questions about whether he
had been faithful to his wife of 16 years — and
whether such private family matters are relevant
to American voters.
Clinton denied the allegations of Gennifer
Flowers, a Little Rock woman who said she had a
12-year affair with the governor.
At the same time, he refused to answer repeat
ed questions about whether he had ever been
unfaithful.
