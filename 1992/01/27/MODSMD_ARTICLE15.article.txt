## Middle East madness 
### 
New revelations show
the U.S. directly fueled
bloody Iran-Iraq war

Q O WHICH SIDE OF THE
are we supporting?" an
anxious CIA operative asks
in Woody Allen's movie "Bananas."
"We're not taking any chances
this time," a cohart responds. "Some
of us are supporting the govern
ment, and the rest are supporting
the rebels."
The above paraphrase sadly
describes the reality of U.S. foreign
policy in the Middle East.
Former U.S. intelligence and
administration officials have
admitted that as early as 1982 the
United States began providing Iraq
with critical military intelligence,
in addition to permitting the sale of
American-made weapons to Bagh
dad, effectively prolonging the
bloody Iran-Iraq war.
This occurred barely a year after
the Reagan administration autho
rized the Israeli government to ship
several billion dollars in U.S. arma
ments and spare parts to Iran.
While outwardly proclaiming its
neutrality in the regional conflict,
the United States was actually
arming both sides. The adminis
tration feared the victory of either
side, which would inevitably alter
the regional balance of power,
including control of vital oil fields.
Furthermore, Iranian domination
of Iraq could undermine secular
Arab states, while an Iraqi tri
umph could bolster a militaristic
dictatorship.
The United States seems to have
been trying to please all sides. Iraq
was — and still is — Israel's avowed
enemy. So naturally, the Israelis
were horrified at the prospect of a
victorious Iraq. Hence, U.S. approval
of arms shipments to Iran. Yet the
United States also had an openly
hostile relationship with revolution
ary Iran. Hence, direct US. support
for Saddam Hussein and his army.

Rather than encouraging peace
and regional stability through the
United Nations, the Reagan
administration followed this seem
ingly illogical policy of mutual
destruction, indirectly causing the
conflict to drag on until 1988. The
United States certainly cannot be
held responsible for starting the
war, but it helped fuel the two
country's war machines.
While it has been known since
1986 that the United States provid
ed Iraq with assistance beginning
in 1984, the latest revelation
demonstrates a much greater
American impact on the course of
the war. Iran desperately needed
foreign assistance at the onset of
the conflict, and Iraq might well
have been defeated had not the
United States provided crucial
intelligence on the precise location
of exploitable weak spots in the Ira
nian military.
A realist theory of international
relations argues that the world
functions according to competing
interests and each country must
seek relative gains against one
another. If this were indeed the
case, then American actions might
be justifiable. However, it is not.
Such a zero-sum view of the world
is inherently destabilizing.
In the long run, U.S. support of
Iraq may well have led to the
aggressive military build-up by
Saddam Hussein. With the recent
anniversary of the Persian Gulf
War, no one need be reminded of
the horrific result of Hussein's
vainglorious ambitions.
However, the case of Iran and
Iraq in the 1980s is only one exam
ple of the hypocrisy of U.S. policy
in the Middle East. The United
States continues to provide mas
sive military assistance to both
Israel and Saudi Arabia, two
avowed enemies.
By arming Middle Eastern
regimes, the United States is direct
ly contributing powder to the burn
ing keg of regional animosities. To
give peace a chance, the Bush
administration must abandon such
a destructive policy.
