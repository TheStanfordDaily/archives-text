Returning faith, religion to our < ego-bound era'

IN "A HISTORY OF THE JEWS,"
Paul Johnson, a Catholic historian,
takes us back exhilaratingly to our
psychic roots. He reminds us how the
Judaeo-Christian principles — which
made possible the creative Western ideas
and impulses currently sweeping the
world — began: with a single God, with
us in His image, gloriously free and
anguishingly responsible.
He also notes the recording of the
First Laugh — of the aged Sarah when
she is informed by an angel that she is
going to have a child — which is the
human way out of all that heady and
doleful burden of very conscious exis
tence. In other books, Johnson shows us
how that fundamental liveliness began to
peter out in the modern era.
Those ancient people, and their Chris
tian heirs, took very seriously the idea
that there was meaning and purpose to
human life and history. This idea is utter
ly out of favor in chic and visionless

places such as contemporary campuses.
One savors the irony that Albert Ein
stein, who more than anyone is responsi
ble for the modern mindset of relativism,
stated that "Science without religion is
lame."
Mallarme, who was called by Edmund
Wilson "the Einstein" of the late-19th
and early-20th-century literary episteme
— a canonization taken up by Sartre,
Foucault, Barthes, Blanchot, George
Steiner and Hugh Kenner — told a tin
kering poetaster, "You can't do without
Eden." But epoch-making thinkers and
literary artists like Mallarme, Proust,
Joyce, Mann and Rilke are almost entire
ly ignored on our campuses.
Cynthia Ozick observed, in a notewor
thy study of T.S. Eliot, Proust and their
fortunes, that "High art is dead" in our
time. So much for our time. A teasing
thought occurs at this juncture: Is it pos
sible that Eliot, Proust et al. will find
again the devotion they have lost in our

country — in the former Soviet Union?
Now, Einstein's faith was surely root
ed in the physical cosmos — "God doesn't
play dice with the universe" — a sort of
natural theology. First, we must point
out that on the "metaphoric" dimension
the "ends meet" circularly, paradoxically
like good and evil in mystic thought.
In Mallarme's exquisite poetry of the
sky, the ideal — the "azure" — and the
earthy bliss of mother milk are joined
intimately, far in, and far out. So, in his
"Gift of the Poem," the father-poet, dis
appointed at his own nocturnal creation,
turns to his sleeping wife at naturally
victorious dawn and apostrophizes her
to "press her breast," musically-mater
nally to nourish his poor little abortive
poem that is "hungered" by the milky
azure sky he sees through the morning
window.
Mingled miracles of light, life and love,
the mother milk motif runs throughout
his oeuvre and much of the Western poet-

ic canon at its finest (Keats, Coleridge,
Chateaubriand, Holderlin, Rimbaud).
That fusion of the peak of vision, essen
tially sacred, and the humbly concrete,
the body, represents the chief aim of
Symbolism altogether, in the wake of its
earlier wave, Romanticism.
In this, Symbolism is an attempt to
heal the mind-body rift of the 19th- and
early 20th-century positivism, just as
Romanticism tried to overcome the ratio
nalistic one-sidedness of the Enlighten
ment.
Mallarme's splendid vision reconciled
mind and body, mankind and world, the
sacred and the cosmos. A faith like that
can help to overcome the schizoid tenden
cies of our manipulatory and ego-bound
era, where alarmingly often man and
woman, parent and child (or embryo) find
no deep and abiding common ground.
