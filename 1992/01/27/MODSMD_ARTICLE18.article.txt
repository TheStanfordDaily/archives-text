# A 						plea to the campus: It may be ugly, but CoHo remains cool
## 
### 
As we sit in the Coffee House wearing
our protective sunglasses, we realize
that this locus of campus bohemia has
turned yuppie on us. And we are mad.
As most CoHo regulars can attest, corn
flower just doesn't cut the Grey Poupon.
Newcomers just don't understand â€”
most of them like it. What distinguished
Stanford's campus hangout was its
dinginess. There's something about
unpainted wood paneling and a dark
room that creates an environment recep
tive to the artsy-fartsy crowd, the
drinkers, the chess players and their
audience, the pseudo-studiers.
The CoHo is where we come to see

and be seen, amid the shadows. Now we
can't look at passers-through without
being caught, and that is a problem.
Although Hip Hop Fridays and Study
Hall weekends are among the best recre
ational innovations on campus this year,
it does not mitigate the stark reality of
the new monochromatic Coffee House.
The walls are cornflower, the ceiling is
cornflower, the track lighting is corn
flower, heck, even the wood paneling is
cornflower. If we wanted yuppie, we
would head to Gordon Biersch Brewery.
We realize this is not an issue of
monumental magnitude by any stretch
of the imagination; we are not advocat
ing social change. But let it be known:
The CoHo is still cool, just plain ugly.
