# Campus poll unfairly attacked the character of infallible Jan Brady
## 
### 
Intermission's Snapshot (Jan. 23) does
a disservice by unfairly characterizing
Jan Brady as "sullen" and "embittered."
As Jan or her many fans would tell
you, it is very difficult to be the middle
child, particularly amid a weirdly con
formist "bunch." Notice that on the
show's credits Jan and Peter never got
to be on the more noticeable corners of
the Brady matrix.
Jan was not a troubled teen, but
rather a sensitive, idealistic girl strug
gling to find her own way in the world.
Who could forget her angst when she
used lemon juice to remove her freckles,
only to discover later that freckles were

in vogue at Fillmore Junior High?
And surely we all empathize with
Jan's attempts to create an invisible
boyfriend, Howard Glass, to claim her
place as a popular Brady sib. How many
of us would be so resourceful as to call
the operator, ask her to call back and
fool the family into believing we'd been
called by an unknown paramour?
In the latest Brady remake Jan and
Peter, the middle children, turned out
the best! Jan was a responsible architect,
looking great and had a good social life.
Marsha, in contrast, was bordering on
alcoholism; Cindy was as self-absorbed
and bitchy as always; Bobby was pathet
ic; and egotistical Greg resembled a
cloned Herschel Bernardi.
Jan Brady's struggles resonate with
those of all sensitive folk.
