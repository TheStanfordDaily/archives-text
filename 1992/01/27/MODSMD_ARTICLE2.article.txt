# Biddle's reach for reins rejected
## Regulator wanted to become academia's 'Inspector General' 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Paul Biddle renewed his request to
assume an independent oversight role
over universities nationwide late last
week, but Navy officials dismissed the
idea, calling it "unprecedented" and sug
gesting that Biddle is "casting about for
a new job."
The controversial on-campus Navy
regulator sent a letter to Rear Adm.
William Miller, chief of Naval Research,
asking for the creation of a new posi
tion, Western Regional Inspector Gen
eral, to "be the pebble in the shoe" of
recipients of federal funds and "effect
the outcome of issues affecting the tax
payer."

In an interview Friday, Biddle said
he wanted to provide the Navy with a
"clear cut, specific alternative choice to
the way things have been done in the
past" by becoming a "truly independent
inspector general" responsible for audit
ing the indirect-cost practices of the
Navy's research universities.
Biddle requested that Miller reply by
tomorrow to "facilitate career decisions
that are currently before me."
According to a statement from
Department of Defense spokesman
Norm Hanson, the Office of Naval
Research is currently "reviewing the
concept of an expanded Inspector Gen
eral position," which would involve "sig
nificant changes" in how the depart
ment operates.

But another Navy official who asked
not to be identified said Biddle's request
was "unprecedented" because "civil ser
vice does not work that way.
"He wants to not only do the fact
finding, but lalso] to be responsible for
deciding criminal charges and conduct
ing audits. He wants to be like the FBI,
Department of Justice and contract
administrator all rolled into one," the
official said.
"But the (auditing) job at Stanford is
coming to an end and Biddle is looking
for a job, so the request does not sur
prise us," he said, adding that "there
will not be a response" by tomorrow's
deadline.
