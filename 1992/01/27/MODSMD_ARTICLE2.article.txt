# Biddle's reach for reins rejected
## Regulator wanted to become academia's 'Inspector General' 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Paul Biddle renewed his request to
assume an independent oversight role
over universities nationwide late last
week, but Navy officials dismissed the
idea, calling it "unprecedented" and sug
gesting that Biddle is "casting about for
a new job."
The controversial on-campus Navy
regulator sent a letter to Rear Adm.
William Miller, chief of Naval Research,
asking for the creation of a new posi
tion, Western Regional Inspector Gen
eral, to "be the pebble in the shoe" of
recipients of federal funds and "effect
the outcome of issues affecting the tax
payer."

In an interview Friday, Biddle said
he wanted to provide the Navy with a
"clear cut, specific alternative choice to
the way things have been done in the
past" by becoming a "truly independent
inspector general" responsible for audit
ing the indirect-cost practices of the
Navy's research universities.
Biddle requested that Miller reply by
tomorrow to "facilitate career decisions
that are currently before me."
According to a statement from
Department of Defense spokesman
Norm Hanson, the Office of Naval
Research is currently "reviewing the
concept of an expanded Inspector Gen
eral position," which would involve "sig
nificant changes" in how the depart
ment operates.

But another Navy official who asked
not to be identified said Biddle's request
was "unprecedented" because "civil ser
vice does not work that way.
"He wants to not only do the fact
finding, but lalso] to be responsible for
deciding criminal charges and conduct
ing audits. He wants to be like the FBI,
Department of Justice and contract
administrator all rolled into one," the
official said.
"But the (auditing) job at Stanford is
coming to an end and Biddle is looking
for a job, so the request does not sur
prise us," he said, adding that "there
will not be a response" by tomorrow's
deadline.
Biddle has been considering
entering national politics by run
ning for the seat of either Rep.
Tom Lantos, D-San Mateo, or
Sen. John Seymour, R-Calif., but
he refused to comment on future
career options.
Biddle said he would make a
decision about his future by Feb. 6.
Biddle's letter comes on the
eve of Wednesday's congressional
hearing on indirect costs before
the House Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations,
chaired by Rep. John Dingell, D-
Mich.
The hearing will provide an
update on the ongoing indirect-

cost controversy, featuring testi
mony from the Office of Naval
Research, General Accounting
Office, Defense Contract Audit
Agency and Department of
Health and Human Services.
Among the topics to be dis
cussed are Biddle's claims that
Stanford overcharged the govern
ment by $480 million in indirect
costs during the 1980s, as well as
an audit conducted by the
Defense Contract Audit Agency
finding that MIT allegedly over
billed the government $75 million
since 1986.
A recent study by the same
agency, which disregarded years
worth of billing agreements, con
cluded that Stanford overcharged
the government $230 million
between fiscal years 1981 and
1988.
