## If Mother Theresa wore hightops Stanford gives up points at charity stripe, loses to UCLA 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Stanford showed the courage
to upset No. 2 UCLA in another
Miracle at Maples, but the Cardi
nal missed 16 free throws and lost
instead, 83-77.
Stanford played its best and
most determined basketball game
of the season but the undefeated
Bruins capitalized on uncharac
teristically cold Cardinal free
throw shooting to overcome a 6-
point second-half deficit.
While encouraged by his
team's herculean effort, Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery was dis
appointed that his Cardinal let
UCLA escape unscathed.
"It's the first time all season
we've really extended ourselves as
a team," said Montgomery, whose

Cardinal are 11-3 overall, 3-2 in
the Pacific 10 Conference. It
hurts right now — it hurts when
you extend yourself and you don't
win. The positive thing is we
brought our game to a new level."
Stanford entered the game
shooting 74.7 percent from the
charity stripe — second best in
the Pacific 10 Conference — but
converted only 17 of 33 (51.5 per
cent) against UCLA. Meanwhile,
the Bruins sank 26 of 32 (81.2
percent) free throws in a foul-fest
at sold-out Maples Pavilion.
Raw determination would have
won this game for Stanford
against most teams, but UCLA
had too many offensive weapons.
Although Stanford out-hustled
and out-rebounded (39-26) the
talented Bruins, in crunch time
UCLA seemed to find the man

with the hot hand.
With 4:15 remaining, UCLA
forward Don Mac Lean broke a 69-
69 tie, scoring on a three-point
play over Adam Keefe and adding
a 5-foot jumper the next time
down the floor.
Despite a spine-tingling steal
and slam by Keefe with 2:04
remaining, Mitchell Butler
answered with a back-breaking
top-of-the-key jumper to give the
Bruins a 76-71 lead with 1:17 left.
Paul Garrett scored on two
layups, but missed a free throw
that could have cut the lead to 79-
76 with :28 left. Despite a career
best night, Garrett was Stan
ford's primary culprit from the
free throw line. He ended the
night 5 for 13, including an 0-for
-4 show the last five minutes.
"I feel low," said Garrett.

"Look at all the opportunities I
had. Moral victory — great. We
still lost."
Stanford fipuled in desperation,
but UCLA nailed five of its last six
free throws and Butler dunked on
a fastbreak to secure the Bruin
win. Although Mac Lean was
limited to 17 points by Keefe,
Tracey Murray scored 23, guard
Shon Tarver added 17 and the
Bruins got 18 points from the
bench.
Keefe led Stanford with 24
points, but Garrett was the sur
prise for the Cardinal, exploding
for a career-high 19 points and 12
rebounds.
"They out-hustled us and out
played us," said UCLA coach Jim
Harrick, whose Bruins stand
alone atop the Pac-10 with a 6-0
mark, 14-0 overall. "We lost our
poise and got in a hurry on
offense."
UCLA sprinted to an early 27-
13 lead, but Stanford's inside
dominance kept the the game
close.
UCLA's leading rebounder in
the first half was 5-foot-10 guard
Tyus Edney with three, while
Garrett and Keefe dominated the
paint. Garrett scored nine points
in the first half, and his 6-foot
jumper at the buzzer gave Stan
ford a 37-36 lead.
After Mac Lean went to the
bench with his third foul and just
six points, Stanford finished the
half on a 14-5 run.
"I wasn't feeling real well
today and I wasn't sure if I was
going to be able to play," said
Mac Lean, who started and played
29 minutes despite a stomach flu.
"I didn't have any legs, that's why
I was missing a lot of shots."
Leading 60-54 with 8:10 left,
Stanford was poised for the upset.


Victor Cheng — Daily
Brent Williams knocks the ball into the basket for two of his 16
points. The No. 2 UCLA Bruins edged the Cardinal, 83-77.
UCLA was off balance on offense,
Mac Lean was on the bench and
the Cardinal was controlling the
game in the paint.
After a timeout, Bruin guard
Gerald Madkins nailed a three
pointer from the perimeter, fol
lowed by an old-fashioned three
point play inside to cut Stanford's
lead to 63-60.
But then Montgomery, argu
ing a foul call, was assessed a
technical foul by referee Terry
Christman; Mac Lean nailed two
free throws; and the Bruins were
off on a 14-6 run.
"I'm not going to blame coach,
but that was just what they
(UCLA) needed at that time,"
said Keefe, explaining the techni
cal foul. "It wasn't anything spe
cific at that point, but it was the
build-up."
"Overall, I think they officiated
the game very well," Keefe said.
