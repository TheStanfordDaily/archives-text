# Garrett sets career highs in boards, baskets
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Individual achievement can never replace the
satisfaction of team victory, yet on Saturday
afternoon, Paul Garrett stood tall.
A force on the boards at both ends of the floor,
Garrett used strong inside play and tough defense
on UCLA forward Tracy Murray to key a solid
effort by the Cardinal in the team's attempt to
topple the No. 2 Bruins.
In the first half, Garrett grabbed four
rebounds, including three on the defensive end
that helped the Cardinal transition game. He
capped off a 10-1 Stanford run by scoring a layup
with three seconds left in the half to give Stanford
a one-point halftime lead.
Don Nelson, head coach of the Golden State
Warriors, said of Garrett at halftime, "He's play
ing very good. He seems to have good anticipa
tion."
Jerry West, vice president/general manager of

the Los Angeles Lakers, added, "He's played very
well. He's very lively and active, and he and the
team have really worked hard."
Garrett opened up the second half right where
he left off, grabbing an offensive rebound and
scoring a putback nine seconds into the period.
This was the first of five offensive rebounds for
Garrett in the second period. He cleaned the glass
a total of 12 times on the day, a career high.
When asked about his rebounding success,
Garrett responded, "They (the Bruins) were wor
rying about Adam (Keefe) on the boards. Don
(Mac Lean) and Rodney (Zimmerman) focused on
Adam ... It's going to happen â€” other teams are
going to concentrate on Adam so much that I'm
going to be open."
The junior from Pacific Palisades, Calif., shot
7-for-ll from the field and finished with iy
points, also a career best. Included in those were
three clutch baskets down the stretch.
"I thought Paul played excep
tionally well," said Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery. "He
showed as much competitiveness
and desire as he's had in his
entire career."
"Paul Garrett deserved to be
on the All Pac-10 team today. He
was just fantastic. We couldn't
keep him off the boards," said
UCLA coach Jim Harrick.
Garrett, in a tough assign
ment, rose to the challenge
defensively in guarding the
much-heralded Murray.
"He played good position
defense . . . well enough so that if
I got around him he could recov
er," Murray said.
Garrett's one flaw in his near
ly perfectly played game was his
inability to knock down some
free throws late in the game.
"I feel low," Garrett said after
the game. "Look at all the oppor
tunities I had from the line
there. Sure, my performance was
a moral victory, great. It's still a
loss."
"Paul had the game of his life.
Unbelievable. If he had just fin
ished off with the free throws it
would have been something he
would have remembered for the
rest of his life," Montgomery
said.
Garrett's Southern California
roots gave him extra incentive to
play well against UCLA.
"I know all the L.A. guys, and
I went to Jim Harrick's summer
camp for 10 years, so it gave me
extra motivation," Garrett said.
