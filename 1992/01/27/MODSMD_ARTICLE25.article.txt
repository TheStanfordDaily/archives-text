# Hoopsters nail treys in win over Huskies
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
The Washington women's basketball team loses
at home an average of once per year. But Saturday
night Stanford put its current team in the history
books, sending the Huskies down to their second
consecutive home loss, the first time that has hap
pened in the last seven years.
It was only the seventh home loss for the
Huskies in the same time span. The sixth came
at the hands of upwardly mobile California on
Jan. 23.
When the Golden Bears were upset by Wash
ington State, Stanford's road trip became even
more successful, as Cal's loss helped move the
Cardinal into a tie with the Bears for first place in
the Pacific 10 Conference. Stanford's only confer
ence loss was to Cal on Jan. 10.
The fact that the Cardinal pulled out a 79-69
win in Hec Edmundson Pavilion and re-estab
lished itself as a front-runner in the Pac-10 race
gives the team massive momentum as it heads
into the bulk of its conference schedule.
For the second game in a row, a career-high
scoring night helped pace Stanford to victory.
Molly Goodenbour finally broke her old high of 16
points — which she had tied a number of times —
and racked up 18 points on the strengths of her
three-point and free-throw shooting.
Thursday, Rachel Hemmer scored a career-high
24 points against the Cougars.
Both teams were able to hit three-pointers at
key times in the game, although the Huskies
missed several in the last couple of minutes.
In the first half Washington's three-point
shooting kept it in the game. Whenever Stanford
had pushed its lead to four points, the Husky
guards would uncannily sink a trey. That hap
pened with the score 4-0, 11-7, and 33-29.
That last one made the score 33-32 near the
end of the first half. But a layup by Val Whiting
and two consecutive three-pointers by Gooden
bour gave Stanford a 41-32 halftime advantage.
Whiting and Goodefrbour each scored six points
in in the last two and a half minutes of the first
period.
Whiting, who is averaging over 21 points per
game, once again led the Cardinal in scoring with
25 on the night. While most of her teammates
were shooting below the team's average 49 per
cent field goal percentage against the vaunted
Husky defense, Whiting's hand stayed hot at 73
percent.
Stanford extended its lead to 10 on another
Whiting layup in the early minutes of the second
period, but at that point the Huskies got them
selves and their fans back into the game with an
11-0 run.
For the next five minutes, Hec Edmundson
rocked with the noise of 7,211 fans, and the
Huskies rode the emotion to a 61-56 lead with
7:46 remaining.
But the Cardinal players were used to pressure,
used to noise, used to top-caliber competition.
They did not repeat their mistakes at Cal. They
did not break down. They buckled down and
regained the lead.
And when Whiting fouled out with 4:35
remaining, they stepped it up yet another notch.
Afterwards, two Hedgpeth free throws extended
the Cardinal lead to 70-66. But this time, with
Stanford up by four, the Huskies did not shoot a
three.
Rut HpHirneth did. nailing it.
Washington was not quite out
of it, however. When freshman
Tanda Rucker fouled Husky

guard Laura Moore on a missed
three-pointer, Moore confidently
sank all three free throws to bring
her team within four. A minute
and a half still remained.
Rucker redeemed herself by
draining another trey with one
minute left.

A few free throws later, the
Cardinal found itself sharing the
Pac-10 lead.

shooting kept it in the game. Whenever Stanford
had pushed its lead to four points, the Husky
guards would uncannily sink a trey. That hap
pened with the score 4-0, 11-7, and 33-29.
That last one made the score 33-32 near the
end of the first half. But a layup by Val Whiting
and two consecutive three-pointers by Gooden
bour gave Stanford a 41-32 halftime advantage.
Whiting and Goodefrbour each scored six points
in in the last two and a half minutes of the first
period.
Whiting, who is averaging over 21 points per
game, once again led the Cardinal in scoring with
25 on the night. While most of her teammates
were shooting below the team's average 49 per
cent field goal percentage against the vaunted
Husky defense, Whiting's hand stayed hot at 73
percent.
Stanford extended its lead to 10 on another
Whiting layup in the early minutes of the second
period, but at that point the Huskies got them
selves and their fans back into the game with an
11-0 run.
For the next five minutes, Hec Edmundson
rocked with the noise of 7,211 fans, and the
Huskies rode the emotion to a 61-56 lead with
7:46 remaining.
But the Cardinal players were used to pressure,
used to noise, used to top-caliber competition.
They did not repeat their mistakes at Cal. They
did not break down. They buckled down and
regained the lead.
And when Whiting fouled out with 4:35
remaining, they stepped it up yet another notch.
Afterwards, two Hedgpeth free throws extended
the Cardinal lead to 70-66. But this time, with
Stanford up by four, the Huskies did not shoot a
three.
Rut HpHirneth did. nailing it.
Washington was not quite out
of it, however. When freshman
Tanda Rucker fouled Husky

guard Laura Moore on a missed
three-pointer, Moore confidently
sank all three free throws to bring
her team within four. A minute
and a half still remained.
Rucker redeemed herself by
draining another trey with one
minute left.

A few free throws later, the
Cardinal found itself sharing the
Pac-10 lead.

The Washington women's basketball team loses
at home an average of once per year. But Saturday
night Stanford put its current team in the history
books, sending the Huskies down to their second
consecutive home loss, the first time that has hap
pened in the last seven years.
It was only the seventh home loss for the
Huskies in the same time span. The sixth came
at the hands of upwardly mobile California on
Jan. 23.
When the Golden Bears were upset by Wash
ington State, Stanford's road trip became even
more successful, as Cal's loss helped move the
Cardinal into a tie with the Bears for first place in
the Pacific 10 Conference. Stanford's only confer
ence loss was to Cal on Jan. 10.
The fact that the Cardinal pulled out a 79-69
win in Hec Edmundson Pavilion and re-estab
lished itself as a front-runner in the Pac-10 race
gives the team massive momentum as it heads
into the bulk of its conference schedule.
For the second game in a row, a career-high
scoring night helped pace Stanford to victory.
Molly Goodenbour finally broke her old high of 16
points — which she had tied a number of times —
and racked up 18 points on the strengths of her
three-point and free-throw shooting.
Thursday, Rachel Hemmer scored a career-high
24 points against the Cougars.
Both teams were able to hit three-pointers at
key times in the game, although the Huskies
missed several in the last couple of minutes.
In the first half Washington's three-point
shooting kept it in the game. Whenever Stanford
had pushed its lead to four points, the Husky
guards would uncannily sink a trey. That hap
