# Spikers subdue Aztecs in WIVA home-opener

### Laurie Wackier Staff writer 
In Saturday's conference opener,
Stanford men's volleyball unleashed
its aggressions on visiting San Diego
State, downing the Aztecs, 15-7, 15-9,
15-7. San Diego State, who lost to the
Cardinal in five games last weekend,
fell to 1-3, while Stanford improved
its mark to 3-1.
Commanded by setter Canyon
Ceman, Stanford's offense unveiled a
crippling arsenal, combining for a
team hitting percentage of .495 for
the match.
"Canyon had them off guard the

whole night," Coach Ruben Nieves
said of the 6-foot-4 sophomore, who
amassed 60 assists against the
Aztecs. "He knew where to go and
what would work when we needed a
sideout."
Everything in Stanford's plan of
attack seemed to be working — a
foursome of Cardinal hitters ruled at
the net. Dave Goss led the squad with
17 kills, hitting an astounding .500
from the back row. In addition, the
junior outside hitter accumulated 13
digs.
Goss was followed by Duncan
Blackman and Bob Hillman, who tal
lied 16 and 15 kills respectively, as

well as serving two aces apiece.
Rounding out the foursome was
Junior John Bezmalinovic, who
racked up 12 kills on a .786 hitting
performance.
The Cardinal pounced on San
Diego State early, jumping to an 8-0
lead in game one. The players' net
play, along with a shower of jump
serves intimidated the Aztecs from
the outset. Nieves cited the jump
serve as an important factor in the
Cardinal victory. "Our serving kind
of set the stage for the match. It got
the other team on the defensive."
San Diego State turned things
around and momentarily put Nieves'

squad on the defensive in game two,
winning four quick points. But Bez
malinovic blocked an Aztec hitter,
claiming Stanford's first point and
returning control of the game to the
Cardinal. Once again, Stanford's
offensive weapons overwhelmed San
Diego State.
Game three was all Stanford
again. In hopes of salvaging a game,
the Aztecs — down 9-4 — called time
out, but Stanford didn't let up. Coast
ing on the momentum he had built
throughout the night — Blackman, a
6-5 senior, provided the finale with
an explosive match-ending service
ace.
