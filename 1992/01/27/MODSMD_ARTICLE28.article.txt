# Redskins destroy Bills in 26th Super Bowl
## 
### 
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - The
no-names on Washington's
defense were too much yester
day for Buffalo's no-huddle
offense.
The Redskins won their third
Super Bowl in 10 years, 37-24,
putting the game away with 24
straight points after a scoreless
first period in which they blew
two touchdown chances.
The Bills, one-point losers to
the New York Giants in the
Super Bowl a year ago, never
were in this meeting of the
teams with the two best records
in the NFL. Only two touch
downs late in the fourth quarter
made it seem that way.
This Washington win was as
much the work of obscure
defenders like Kurt Gouveia,
Brad Edwards, Fred Stokes,
Jason Buck, Alvoid Mays and
Andre Collins as any of the
team's stars.
"Our defensive guys gave
them a lot of looks and I think
that held them," Redskins coach
Joe Gibbs said.
Sure, MVP Mark Rypien was
18 of 33 for 292 yards and two
touchdowns as Washington ran
the NFC's streak in the NFL's
marquee game to eight straight.
Sure, the "Posse" —
receivers Art Monk, Gary Clark
and Ricky Sanders — led a 17-
point explosion in 5 minutes,
45 seconds of the the second
quarter after a scoreless first
period.
That surge saw the Redskins
use the no-huddle offense them
selves in a modified reprise of
their record 35-point second
quarter in their Super Bowl rout
of Denver four years ago.
And sure, Rypien hit Clark

with a 30-yard touchdown pass
with 1:24 left in the third quar
ter after Buffalo had cut a 24-0
lead to 24-10.
But just as important was the
work of a blitzing defense that
shut down the NFL's most
explosive offense until the Red
skins had that lead.
It sacked Jim Kelly five times,
got four interceptions — two by
Edwards, one of five Plan B free
agents who start on defensive
coordinator Richie Petitbon's
unit.
It also forced a fumble in
helping Gibbs to his third Super
Bowl win, tied with San Francis
co's Bill Walsh and one behind
Pittsburgh's Chuck Noll on the
all-time list.
Kelly set a Super Bowl record
by throwing 58 times, and com
pleted only 28 for 275 yards.
It held Thurman Thomas, the
league's MVP this year, to just
10 yards in eight carries through
the first three quarters, limiting
the league's leading running
game to just 15 yards over that
period and without a rushing
first down until midway through
the third.
Thomas finished with only 13
yards on 10 carries, and was
never a factor, either.
"We gave them a lot of differ
ent window dressing. I think we
confused them early on," defen
sive end Charles Mann said.
Frustrated them, as well.
Trailing 17-0 and having had
a couple of officials' calls go
against them, Bills coach Marv
Levy railed at the refs as the half
ended, and television cameras
caught him apparently shouting
"you've been bought" at field
judge Ed Merrifield.
