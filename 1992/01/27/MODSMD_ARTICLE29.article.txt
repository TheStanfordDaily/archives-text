The Stanford women swimmers com
pleted their romp through their Pacific 10
Conference opponents Saturday at
deGuerre Pool, destroying the California
Bears, 183-78.
Stanford athletes won every event but
one. Paced by Lea Loveless, who won two
events and established a new Pac-10
record in the 200-meter backstroke, and
Jenny Thompson, who set deGuerre
records in both the 50 and 100 freestyle,
Stanford easily outswam the fifth-ranked
California team.
Loveless and Thompson were not the
only swimmers to excel, as several other
swimmers broke deGuerre Pool records.
Mary Ellen Blanchard set the new stan
dard in the 200 Individual Medley, Lori

Heisick lowered the pool record in the 200
breaststroke, and Janel Jorgensen estab
lished a new record in the 100 butterfly.
Jorgensen also won the 500 free.
Sophomore Eileen Richetelli returned
to action by leading Stanford to a 1-2-3
sweep of the three-meter diving event.
Melissa Kuller placed second and Kristin
Jensen finished third.
In other events, Karen Kraemer won the
1,000 free with a time of nine minutes 52.03
seconds. Pam Minthorn won the 200 free.
Becky Crowe won the 200 fly. Summer
Sanders raced to a 4:08.58 in the 400 IM.
Stanford extended its domination to the
relay events as well. In the 800 freestyle
relay, Stanford's A team — consisting of
Kraemer, Sanders, Sionainn Marcoux, and
Jorgensen — swam a 7:28.08, defeating
Cal's A team be three seconds.
