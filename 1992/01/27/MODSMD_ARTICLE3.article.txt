# Group of profs lambasts sex-assault policy
## Scholars criticize new policy as vague, dangerous 'penilectomy' 
### Alain Dalva Staff writer 
The institution of a University
sexual assault policy last Decem
ber has a group of Stanford facul
ty up in arms.
German Prof. Gerald Gille
spie, chair and spokesman of the
Stanford chapter of the California
Association of Scholars, said his
group opposes the policy approved
by University President Donald
Kennedy.
He said the institution of the new
policy, as well as last year's proposal
to reduce the burden of proof in
judicial cases, indicate that the Uni
versity administration may intend
to "break down the legal safe
guards" that protect the accused
against unreasonable complaints.
Others defended the sexual
assault policy, saying the phras

ing in its definition of sexual
assault resembles conventional
criminal law.
Gillespie said the association's
Stanford chapter felt the policy's
"vague" rephrasing is "danger
ously open-ended."
The new policy states that
"'sexual assault' includes, but is
not limited to, rape, forced
sodomy, forced oral copulation,
rape by a foreign object, sexual bat
tery or threat of sexual assault."
Gillespie drew attention to the
phrase "is not limited to." He said
the wording leaves room for
ambiguous interpretations that
could profoundly affect the lives
and careers of the accused.
The new policy also defines
sexual assault as including "delib

drugs or alcohol." Gillespie said
this segment is "too vaguely for-

"clear boundaries" and may alter
the legal definition of individual
responsibility.
But Law Prof. Robert Weis
berg said, "I don't think it's an
unfair extension of the original
definition" of rape.
Weisberg acknowledged that the
wording of the policy concerning
the use of drugs and alcohol "could
have been sharper." But he added

that he doesn't think the wording
is "much more vague than many
conventional criminal laws."
Weisberg said the new policy
"might have been intended as an
aspirational rather than a prosecu
torial tool." Responding to Gille
spie's objection that the term "is
not limited to" is too open-ended,
Weisberg said the word "assault"
in the definition already limits the
range of interpretations.
Radical influence?
Gillespie said by making an
intricate system of laws more
open-ended, the University
administration is "drawing up a
code with a stern language to use
its power" on individuals.
Instead of exerting caution on
matters of academic freedom and
