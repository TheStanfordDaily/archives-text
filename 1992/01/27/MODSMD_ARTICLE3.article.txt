# Group of profs lambasts sex-assault policy
## Scholars criticize new policy as vague, dangerous 'penilectomy' 
### Alain Dalva Staff writer 
The institution of a University
sexual assault policy last Decem
ber has a group of Stanford facul
ty up in arms.
German Prof. Gerald Gille
spie, chair and spokesman of the
Stanford chapter of the California
Association of Scholars, said his
group opposes the policy approved
by University President Donald
Kennedy.
He said the institution of the new
policy, as well as last year's proposal
to reduce the burden of proof in
judicial cases, indicate that the Uni
versity administration may intend
to "break down the legal safe
guards" that protect the accused
against unreasonable complaints.
Others defended the sexual
assault policy, saying the phras

ing in its definition of sexual
assault resembles conventional
criminal law.
Gillespie said the association's
Stanford chapter felt the policy's
"vague" rephrasing is "danger
ously open-ended."
The new policy states that
"'sexual assault' includes, but is
not limited to, rape, forced
sodomy, forced oral copulation,
rape by a foreign object, sexual bat
tery or threat of sexual assault."
Gillespie drew attention to the
phrase "is not limited to." He said
the wording leaves room for
ambiguous interpretations that
could profoundly affect the lives
and careers of the accused.
The new policy also defines
sexual assault as including "delib
erate coercion through the use of
drugs or alcohol." Gillespie said
this segment is "too vaguely for-

nist groups.

mulated" because it does not set
"clear boundaries" and may alter
the legal definition of individual
responsibility.
But Law Prof. Robert Weis
berg said, "I don't think it's an
unfair extension of the original
definition" of rape.
Weisberg acknowledged that the
wording of the policy concerning
the use of drugs and alcohol "could
have been sharper." But he added

that he doesn't think the wording
is "much more vague than many
conventional criminal laws."
Weisberg said the new policy
"might have been intended as an
aspirational rather than a prosecu
torial tool." Responding to Gille
spie's objection that the term "is
not limited to" is too open-ended,
Weisberg said the word "assault"
in the definition already limits the
range of interpretations.
Radical influence?
Gillespie said by making an
intricate system of laws more
open-ended, the University
administration is "drawing up a
code with a stern language to use
its power" on individuals.
Instead of exerting caution on
matters of academic freedom and
freedom of expression, Gillespie
argued, some members of the
administration have deliberately
put aside conventional law and
act as if they have come up with
an "absolute truth."
Gillespie claimed that the new
modification of the policy was a
consequence of "radical groups"
in the administration who want to
"break down parts of [our] tradi
tional and conventional society."
Some people in the administra
tion are afraid to resist these ten
dencies, Gillespie said, and the
ensuing tensions have led to an
"unhealthy climate" for academic
freedom and freedom of speech.

But Weisberg said these claims
may be overblown.
The California Association of
Scholars, which opened a Stan
ford chapter last November, is
part of a 2,000-member national
group which formed to oppose
"political correctness" — defined
by the group as orthodox political
views that lead to restricted
speech and academic rights.
The Stanford chapter's first
resolution, adopted last Novem
ber, opposed the proposed
amendment by the Committee
of 15 to reduce the burden of
proof in University judicial cases
from "beyond a reasonable
doubt" to "clear and convincing
evidence."
Weisberg argued that the Asso
ciation of Scholars has picked
occasional excesses from left-wing

groups and overgeneralized them.
He said "left-wing ideology" has
not taken over the administra
tion, adding that political disputes
between the association and other
groups are "often intellectually
shallow."
Although there have been
excesses, Weisberg said, none of
them has ever impinged on the
rights of the student. In the bur
den of proof case, Weisberg
stressed that the ASSU Senate
had the power to overrule the pro
posed amendment and the stu
dent delegates utilized this power.
Policy of penilectomy?
Arnold Beichman, a research
fellow at Hoover Institution and
member of the California Associa
tion of Scholars, said he thinks
the ambiguous wording of the

sexual assault policy has its root
in radical feminist groups around
the nation who claim that "all sex
is rape and all men are rapists."
But Susan Epstein, student
coordinator for sexual assault
prevention education and referral
resources, said she disagreed with
Beichman's view.
"The issue has nothing to do
men vs. women. Nor is it anti
sex.," Epstein said. "It's an issue
of consent."
Beichman, continuing his theo
ry, said he found a new word to
explain the phenomena driving
the creation of the new policy:
"penilectomy."
In ancient times, Beichman
said, some men were castrated in
order to protect women from
other men. Today, radical groups
that claim all sex is rape are figu

ratively "cutting off" penises on
the premise that all men are
rapists and guilty, he said.
Beichman warned that penilec
tomy is not the solution and that
this new law will only "destroy
the flowering of normal relation
ships between men and women."
But Epstein said sexual assault
had little to do with normal rela
tionships, and such incidents
were not limited to heterosexual
encounters.
"A woman can rape a woman
and a man can rape a man,"
Epstein said. "Sexual assault has
to do with aggression. With rape,
sex is used as a means for power."
Epstein added that she did not
know of "anyone in the committee
drafting this policy nor in the task
force that was the originator of
this idea" who holds the penilec

tomist views described by Beich
man.
Epstein added that she is not
entirely pleased with the new pol
icy "because it doesn't have a good
definition" of sexual assault. She
said she hopes it is eventually
revised.
Beichman said that because of
the vaguely phrased policy, "the
accusation becomes the indict
ment, and the indictment
becomes the guilty verdict."
In an intimate situation turned
ambiguously sour, the man's
word will be pitted against the
woman's, Beichman said.
"My wife thinks I am crazy to
talk in this way. But I think I
speak on behalf of a generation of
young men who have been cowed
by the accusations that all men
are predators," Beichman said.

them has ever impinged on the
rights of the student. In the bur

stressed that the ASSU Senate
had the power to overrule the pro

Policy of penilectomy?
Arnold Beichman, a research
fellow at Hoover Institution and
member of the California Associa
tion of Scholars, said he thinks
the ambiguous wording of the

sexual assault policy has its root
in radical feminist groups around
the nation who claim that "all sex
is rape and all men are rapists."
But Susan Epstein, student
coordinator for sexual assault
prevention education and referral
resources, said she disagreed with
Beichman's view.
"The issue has nothing to do
men vs. women. Nor is it anti
sex.," Epstein said. "It's an issue
of consent."
Beichman, continuing his theo
ry, said he found a new word to
explain the phenomena driving
the creation of the new policy:
"penilectomy."
In ancient times, Beichman
said, some men were castrated in
order to protect women from
other men. Today, radical groups
that claim all sex is rape are figu

ratively "cutting off" penises on
the premise that all men are
rapists and guilty, he said.
Beichman warned that penilec
tomy is not the solution and that
this new law will only "destroy
the flowering of normal relation
ships between men and women."
But Epstein said sexual assault
had little to do with normal rela
tionships, and such incidents
were not limited to heterosexual
encounters.
"A woman can rape a woman
and a man can rape a man,"
Epstein said. "Sexual assault has
to do with aggression. With rape,
sex is used as a means for power."
Epstein added that she did not
know of "anyone in the committee
drafting this policy nor in the task
force that was the originator of
this idea" who holds the penilec

tomist views described by Beich
man.
Epstein added that she is not
entirely pleased with the new pol
icy "because it doesn't have a good
definition" of sexual assault. She
said she hopes it is eventually
revised.
Beichman said that because of
the vaguely phrased policy, "the
accusation becomes the indict
ment, and the indictment
becomes the guilty verdict."
In an intimate situation turned
ambiguously sour, the man's
word will be pitted against the
woman's, Beichman said.
"My wife thinks I am crazy to
talk in this way. But I think I
speak on behalf of a generation of
young men who have been cowed
by the accusations that all men
are predators," Beichman said.
The institution of a University
sexual assault policy last Decem
ber has a group of Stanford facul
ty up in arms.
German Prof. Gerald Gille
spie, chair and spokesman of the
Stanford chapter of the California
Association of Scholars, said his
group opposes the policy approved
by University President Donald
Kennedy.
He said the institution of the new
policy, as well as last year's proposal
to reduce the burden of proof in
judicial cases, indicate that the Uni
versity administration may intend
to "break down the legal safe
guards" that protect the accused
against unreasonable complaints.
Others defended the sexual
assault policy, saying the phras

ing in its definition of sexual
assault resembles conventional
criminal law.
Gillespie said the association's
Stanford chapter felt the policy's
"vague" rephrasing is "danger
ously open-ended."
The new policy states that
"'sexual assault' includes, but is
not limited to, rape, forced
sodomy, forced oral copulation,
rape by a foreign object, sexual bat
tery or threat of sexual assault."
Gillespie drew attention to the
phrase "is not limited to." He said
the wording leaves room for
ambiguous interpretations that
could profoundly affect the lives
and careers of the accused.
The new policy also defines
sexual assault as including "delib
erate coercion through the use of
drugs or alcohol." Gillespie said
this segment is "too vaguely for-

mulated" because it does not set
"clear boundaries" and may alter
the legal definition of individual
responsibility.
But Law Prof. Robert Weis
berg said, "I don't think it's an
unfair extension of the original
definition" of rape.
Weisberg acknowledged that the
wording of the policy concerning
the use of drugs and alcohol "could
have been sharper." But he added

that he doesn't think the wording
is "much more vague than many
conventional criminal laws."
Weisberg said the new policy
"might have been intended as an
aspirational rather than a prosecu
torial tool." Responding to Gille
spie's objection that the term "is
not limited to" is too open-ended,
Weisberg said the word "assault"
in the definition already limits the
range of interpretations.
Radical influence?
Gillespie said by making an
intricate system of laws more
open-ended, the University
administration is "drawing up a
code with a stern language to use
its power" on individuals.
Instead of exerting caution on
matters of academic freedom and
freedom of expression, Gillespie
argued, some members of the
administration have deliberately
put aside conventional law and
act as if they have come up with
an "absolute truth."
Gillespie claimed that the new
modification of the policy was a
consequence of "radical groups"
in the administration who want to
"break down parts of [our] tradi
tional and conventional society."
Some people in the administra
tion are afraid to resist these ten
dencies, Gillespie said, and the
ensuing tensions have led to an
"unhealthy climate" for academic
freedom and freedom of speech.

But Weisberg said these claims
may be overblown.
The California Association of
Scholars, which opened a Stan
ford chapter last November, is
part of a 2,000-member national
group which formed to oppose
"political correctness" — defined
by the group as orthodox political
views that lead to restricted
speech and academic rights.
The Stanford chapter's first
resolution, adopted last Novem
ber, opposed the proposed
amendment by the Committee
of 15 to reduce the burden of
proof in University judicial cases
from "beyond a reasonable
doubt" to "clear and convincing
evidence."
Weisberg argued that the Asso
ciation of Scholars has picked
occasional excesses from left-wing

groups and overgeneralized them.
He said "left-wing ideology" has
not taken over the administra
tion, adding that political disputes
between the association and other
groups are "often intellectually
shallow."
Although there have been
excesses, Weisberg said, none of
them has ever impinged on the
