# Injuries, Titans slow Card
## 
### Larry Liu Staff writer 
The Stanford wrestlers faced tough
competition this weekend as they partici
pated in their last home dual meet of the
season.
The undermanned Cardinal gave a
gutsy performance Friday night before
falling 30-13 to Cal State-Fullerton. The
next morning, Stanford traveled to San
Francisco State for the All-Cal Invitation
al and found greater success, with four
wrestlers bringing back top-four honors.
The Fullerton meet was much closer
than the score indicates. Stanford, due to
injuries and holes in its lineup, had to for
feit three matches, netting the opposition
18 points before the competition had
begun. And of the matches that the Car
dinal did lose, all were decided by fewer
than three points.
In the 118-pound class, Phil Nowick
gave up an early lead as Michael Grubbs
scored two takedowns in the third period
to take a 7-6 minor decision. The win
increased the Titans' lead to 21-0.
At 126-pounds, Phil's twin brother
Dave lost a 6-5 minor decision to Farzin
Daneshnia. Nowick almost pulled off an
upset when he pulled within a point in the
third period, but he could not score in the
last minute and 10 seconds.
In the 134-pound class, Jay Jackson
was defeated 7-5 by Lyndon Campbell.
The match was marred by Campbell's use
of a controversial, and potentially danger
ous, move called the bent-leg turk in an
attempt to force Jackson into submission.
Though unsuccessful, Campbell prevailed
and added three more points to the
Titans' lead.
At 150 pounds, senior co-captain Dave
Sacks took a 13-4 major decision over
Curtis Alkire. The highlights included
three takedowns and a near fall by Sacks.

His win gave the Cardinal four team
points.
At 158 pounds, freshman Sahlan Mar
tin lost a nailbiter to Fullerton's Donnie
Kiernan as Kiernan scored late in the
third period to take a 6-4 minor decision.
At 167 pounds, senior co-captain Matt
Topham finished strongly with two take
downs in the last 45 seconds to score a 7-
1 win over Lazslo Molnar.
And at 190 pounds, senior co-captain
Mark Graham provided an exciting finish
for the Cardinal, recording the only pin of
the meet with 56 seccnds remaining in
the first period.
All in all, coach Chris Horpel was
pleased with Stanford's performance.
"They wrestled with a lot of heart
tonight, and that makes me very proud
and happy. We weren't supposed to win
our first three matches, but our guys gave
it their all and showed they were capable
of winning."
In fact, Stanford possessed a 13-12
advantage in the matches in which they
did compete. However, Horpel did not
bemoan the disadvantage injuries gave
the Cardinal.
"[The injuries] actually relieved the
team of any pressure to win and allowed
them to focus more on each wrestler to
put on their best performance."
On Saturday, Stanford participated in
the All-Cal Invitational. Graham led the
way with a second place finish in his
weight class. Dave Nowick took a third
place, and Jackson and Topham finished
fourth. The team's efforts gave Stanford
a fifth place finish.
With the Pac-10 Championships only a
month away, Horpel described the Cardi
nal's goals aptly. "IThese tournaments]
are like midterms, with the Pac-lOs and
NCAAs as the final. Disregarding the
injuries, the whole team looks the best it's
been all vear."
