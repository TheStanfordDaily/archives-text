# Clean fun: Mud volleyball raises record high proceeds on lake bed
## 
### Kim McCreery Staff writer 
Lake Lagunita's usually dry
bed metamorphosed into a slimy
pit Saturday for about 400 Stan
ford faculty, students and alumni
to spike, dig and slosh their way
to victory at the Kappa Alpha
mud volleyball tournament.
Over 100 onlookers attended
the spectacle to cheer on their
filthy favorites at the sixth-annu
al coed tournament, which raised
an all-time high of about $10,500
for the Muscular Dystrophy Asso
ciation, according to organizer
Trevor Loy.
Freshman Sarah Blakely
described the matches as an eye
opening experience. "It was hilar
ious watching everybody dive
down and just get plastered with
mud," she said. "Pretty soon
every player was just like a little
pair of white eyeballs in a cast of
grit.
"I didn't really know what the
event was all about this year, but
I know next year I want to play.
It's fun to watch and cheer, but it
looks like a lot more fun to play,"
Blakely added.
For the second year in a row,
the winning team was "With
Themselves," an eight-member

group of students and alumni.
According to team member Keith
Hennesey, his troupe keeps com
ing back "because we like to play
volleyball and we like the mud."
He said that over the years his
team has learned "a few little
tricks" to give them the edge over
their muddy competitors.
"This year we rented a space
heater to keep warm between
matches and put Vaseline on our
legs and arms to help the mud
come off easier, and we could keep
warm better," Hennesey said.
Winners received gift certifi
cates from local restaurants.
Loy, a junior, said funds were
generated from corporate sup
port, team entry fees and T-shirt
and concession sales during the
all-day event. The money will
benefit research and support for
muscular dystrophy patients
throughout the Bay area.
He said he was happy with the
turnout, as well as the money the
group raised, which exceeded last
year's total by more than $500.
"Now all the stress seemed
worth it," said Loy. "Given the
recession, we really had to work a
lot harder at getting corporate
sponsors. But it's such a great
cause, and people have so much
fun doing it that it all seems

worth it now."
A break in the winter cold spell
also may have sparked interest. "I
think the weather really helped
too," Loy added. "More people
came out just for the festivities."
The tournament also offered
music, food, promotional items
and prizes. San Jose's KSJO radio
station broadcasted live from the
site.
Although the fraternity mem
bers kept the playing field suffi
ciently soggy by repeatedly hosing
down the dry surface with hun
dreds of gallons of water, Loy said
this type of water use is not
wasteful.
"The water would be used any
way because periodically the fire
department has to flush out the
fire hydrants. We're just doing it
for them."
According to Loy, the KAs are
very conscious of the water con
servation issue, since the event
draws complaints every year.
"We work with the Palo Alto fire
marshal, the dean of students and
others to make the event fun and
environmentally safe," he said.
"We only use non-potable
water, which is classified as not
up to the standards of drinking
water. It's basically just ground
water from the lake."
