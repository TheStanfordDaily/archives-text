# Sands of study shift with Soviet collapse
## 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
Repercussions from events unfolding in
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union
have been felt worldwide — and Stanford's
Russian and East European Studies Program
is no exception.
"It is certainly true that the emphases of
some programs are going to shift," said Histo
ry Prof. Norman Naimark, Director of the
Center for Russian and East European Stud
ies.
Naimark said the Russian and East Euro
pean Studies Program would "probably con
centrate more on the new nations of the
region," and that "course offerings will be less
focused on Soviet (questions)."

lie added that some of these changes have
already begun and that there are several dis
tinguished East European scholars at Stan
ford who are interpreting the events of the
past few years in historical and sociological
contexts.
As an example of courses designed to inter
pret the latest changes, Naimark cited a
course on the Yugoslav crisis offered this
quarter by History Prof. Emeritus Wayne
Vucinich.
Naimark said he "urged [Vucinich| out of
retirement" to teach the course because there
are "very few people who can talk in detail
(about the crisis) and he's one of them."
A description of the course states that "dur
ing the current civil strife in Yugoslavia, his
tory has been frequently cited, often distorted

or exaggerated."
Vucinich said he felt there was a need for
the course because it dealt with a "complicat
ed subject that was reported extensively in our
press and mostly from one side." But he
stressed that the primary reason for offering
the course was to balance the program since
"there was a conspicuous absence of courses
on the modern period."
According to Naimark, emphasis should be
placed on studying the ethnicities and nation
alities of the region, and it would be advanta
geous to have on the faculty people who study
"Central Asia, ethnicity and the transition
from the socialist economic system."
But he added, "obviously there is a problem
with expanding resources right now," refer
ring to the University's current budget woes.
