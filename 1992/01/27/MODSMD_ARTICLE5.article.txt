## Students left homeless, belongings wrecked 
### Scott Handleman Staff writer 
A deluge from a faulty sprinkler
drenched the Phi Sigma Kappa house yes
terday, destroying property and leaving the
residents homeless for a night.
According to Acting Fire Captain Doug
Farnham, the defective sprinkler on the top
floor of the Row house spewed water at a
rate of 30 gallons per minute for about 10
minutes.
The 300 gallons of water that flooded
the heating ducts in the basement of the
building effectively cut off heat and elec
tricity to the house. The 26 residents were
evacuated yesterday and should be permit

ted to re-enter the house today.
According to Lisa Webb, residence dean
for the Row, the students all evacuated the
building, but were not required to report to
a central location.
Webb said the residents "evacuated all
over the place. They went to stay with
friends."
Phi Sig residents were forced to immedi
ately evacuate the building after the flood
because the broken sprinkler also triggered
the building's fire alarm, according to
Farnham.
The residents "did a very good job" in fol
lowing standard emergency fire procedures,
Parnham said. "They all evacuat
ed when they heard the fire
alarm."
Kacarina Sandoral was in her
room anticipating the Super Bowl
when, at "10 minutes to kickofT,"
water from the sprinkler soaked
her TV, along with the rest of her
belongings.
Aurora Flores, her roommate,
said the downpour was "like a
waterfall."
Flores said she lost a television
set, VCR, books, clothes, a leather
jacket, a bicycle, shoes and pictures.
Phi Sig residents were informed
that insurance would cover the cost
of replacing damaged property.
Residents said they were
instructed to leave all their
belongings in the house so insur
ance inspectors could estimate
property damage.
Phi Sig resident Miranda Paton,
who was witness to the flood, said,
"It was pretty impressive. This
house is wooden, so the water dam
age will be pretty major."
