## Residents not amused by smear job 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
Residents of Alondra House found them
selves the victims of a disturbing prank Fri
day morning when they discovered feces
smeared throughout their dorm. Stanford
Police are investigating the incident but
have yet to name any suspects.
Feces were smeared on the underside of
doorknobs, on bannisters in two stairwells,
in spouts of drinking fountains and on sev
eral bicycles and bicycle racks outside, said
Joe Kimura, a resident of the all-freshman
house. None of the other six houses in Flo
rence Moore Hall reported any damage.
Alondra resident assistant Quan Phung
said the house filed a report with the police
Friday and contacted their residence dean
and resident fellows. Residents also held a
meeting Friday night to discuss the inci

from the police.
"We really don't know much at this
point," Phung said, including whether the
suspects are Stanford students or how the
suspects entered the dorm.
According to Stanford Police Sgt. Hilary
Karp, it is illegal to deposit noxious material

on private or public property, and violators
can be fined but not imprisoned. However,
Karp added, the Santa Clara County health
department might find health code viola
tions in addition to any legal infractions.
Phung said he also does not know
whether the feces were of human or animal
origin, although one resident said he was
"pretty sure it was human."
The same resident, who wished to
remain anonymous, said he saw three or
four individuals dressed in dark clothing
walk down the second-floor hall between 4
and 4:30 a.m. The resident said he couldn't
see them clearly because he wasn't wearing
his contact lenses, but said the individuals
left when they saw him.
Kimura said the incident must have hap
pened early Friday morning. "A bunch of
people went to sleep at 3:30, and nothing
had happened then," he said. But at 5:30
a.m. another resident noticed feces on the
underside of his doorknob shortly after get
ting out of bed.
Lilli, a resident who asked to be identi
fied by only her first name, said she first
noticed the feces when she left her room to
