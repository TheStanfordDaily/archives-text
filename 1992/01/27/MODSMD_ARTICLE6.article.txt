# Feces happened
## Residents not amused by smear job 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
Residents of Alondra House found them
selves the victims of a disturbing prank Fri
day morning when they discovered feces
smeared throughout their dorm. Stanford
Police are investigating the incident but
have yet to name any suspects.
Feces were smeared on the underside of
doorknobs, on bannisters in two stairwells,
in spouts of drinking fountains and on sev
eral bicycles and bicycle racks outside, said
Joe Kimura, a resident of the all-freshman
house. None of the other six houses in Flo
rence Moore Hall reported any damage.
Alondra resident assistant Quan Phung
said the house filed a report with the police
Friday and contacted their residence dean
and resident fellows. Residents also held a
meeting Friday night to discuss the inci
dent and are now awaiting further word
from the police.
"We really don't know much at this
point," Phung said, including whether the
suspects are Stanford students or how the
suspects entered the dorm.
According to Stanford Police Sgt. Hilary
Karp, it is illegal to deposit noxious material

on private or public property, and violators
can be fined but not imprisoned. However,
Karp added, the Santa Clara County health
department might find health code viola
tions in addition to any legal infractions.
Phung said he also does not know
whether the feces were of human or animal
origin, although one resident said he was
"pretty sure it was human."
The same resident, who wished to
remain anonymous, said he saw three or
four individuals dressed in dark clothing
walk down the second-floor hall between 4
and 4:30 a.m. The resident said he couldn't
see them clearly because he wasn't wearing
his contact lenses, but said the individuals
left when they saw him.
Kimura said the incident must have hap
pened early Friday morning. "A bunch of
people went to sleep at 3:30, and nothing
had happened then," he said. But at 5:30
a.m. another resident noticed feces on the
underside of his doorknob shortly after get
ting out of bed.
Lilli, a resident who asked to be identi
fied by only her first name, said she first
noticed the feces when she left her room to
go to breakfast Friday morning. It
wasn't until she returned from
breakfast, she said, "when I really
noticed the smell."
The stairwells reeked of defe
cation as well, Lilli noted. In one
stairwell, the feces blended in
with the handrails, which were
painted brown. "You could totally
smell it," she said, "but you
couldn't see it."
Lilli said she and other resi
dents who first discovered the
feces slipped notes under the
doors of their dormmates, warn
ing them about the feces on their
outside doorknobs.
Residents biking to their morn

ing classes soon discovered several
of their bikes had also been tam
pered with. Resident Keri Bould
ing said, "I saw that my bike was
just completely covered. There
were clumps en the seat, all over
the handlebars and on the sides of
my bike. ... I was in disbelief."
Other residents were just plain
angry.
"I feel furious and disgusted,"
Lilli said. "It's just so repulsive."
Alondra Resident Leslie
Howard, whose door was one of
the few left untouched, added, "1
think people are just really
upset."
Phung echoed their senti
ments. "People were just disgust
ed, kind of sickened by it. It's not
a funny prank. It's also unhealth
ful."
Alondra resident Keith Rich

man said many of his dormmates
were angered more by the feces on
their bicycles than on their door
knobs. Bolding said, "It's possible
to see the humor in the door
knobs, but not on private proper
ty."
Vandalizing the bicycles,
Phung added, "was an invasion of
people's private property. I think
that's beyond the call of any
thing."
A few hours and several cans of
Lysol later, residents had cleaned
up the mess left by their early
morning visitors. Bolding, for
one, spent the afternoon scrub
bing doorknobs, bannisters and
bicycles.
The clean-up process didn't
bother her, she said. Rather,
"Just thinking a person could do
this bothered me the most."

his contact lenses, but said the individuals
left when they saw him.
Kimura said the incident must have hap
pened early Friday morning. "A bunch of
people went to sleep at 3:30, and nothing
had happened then," he said. But at 5:30
a.m. another resident noticed feces on the
underside of his doorknob shortly after get
ting out of bed.
Lilli, a resident who asked to be identi
fied by only her first name, said she first
noticed the feces when she left her room to
go to breakfast Friday morning. It
wasn't until she returned from
breakfast, she said, "when I really
noticed the smell."
The stairwells reeked of defe
cation as well, Lilli noted. In one
stairwell, the feces blended in
with the handrails, which were
painted brown. "You could totally
smell it," she said, "but you
couldn't see it."
Lilli said she and other resi
dents who first discovered the
feces slipped notes under the
doors of their dormmates, warn
ing them about the feces on their
outside doorknobs.
Residents biking to their morn

ing classes soon discovered several
of their bikes had also been tam
pered with. Resident Keri Bould
ing said, "I saw that my bike was
just completely covered. There
were clumps en the seat, all over
the handlebars and on the sides of
my bike. ... I was in disbelief."
Other residents were just plain
angry.
"I feel furious and disgusted,"
Lilli said. "It's just so repulsive."
Alondra Resident Leslie
Howard, whose door was one of
the few left untouched, added, "1
think people are just really
upset."
Phung echoed their senti
ments. "People were just disgust
ed, kind of sickened by it. It's not
a funny prank. It's also unhealth
ful."
Alondra resident Keith Rich

man said many of his dormmates
were angered more by the feces on
their bicycles than on their door
knobs. Bolding said, "It's possible
to see the humor in the door
knobs, but not on private proper
ty."
Vandalizing the bicycles,
Phung added, "was an invasion of
people's private property. I think
that's beyond the call of any
thing."
A few hours and several cans of
Lysol later, residents had cleaned
up the mess left by their early
morning visitors. Bolding, for
one, spent the afternoon scrub
bing doorknobs, bannisters and
bicycles.
The clean-up process didn't
bother her, she said. Rather,
"Just thinking a person could do
this bothered me the most."
