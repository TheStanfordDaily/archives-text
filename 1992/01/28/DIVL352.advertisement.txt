The drive to be
the best.
Ten years, hundreds of aecolades
and millions of sales dollars later, the
people of Quantum still aren't satisfied.
Because to us, being the best means more
than consistently outdoing the competi
tion with our innovative disk drive pnxl
ucts. It's also an inner drive —one that
compels us to continually top our own
personal bests.
That kind of drive is responsible for
the industry's first drive on a card, the first
l" profile 3-1/2" drive, and now a family
of high-speed 2-I/2" drives. And 10 con
secutive quarters of sales growth.
Are you driven?
We take only the best—and we
return the favor. We offer a generous
compensation and benefits package as
well as a superior work environment in
our new facility, just off Highway 237 in
Milpitas.
If you work smart, hard and fast—
like us—and are pursuing an MBA, we'd
like to meet you.
