25 enrolled, 24 respondents - Excellent (16), Good (8).
Prof. Zalta is teaching Phil 80 for the fourth time. He is accessible and open to
meeting with students, if you are willing to make the pilgrimage to his office. Both
challenging and insightful, Zalta really makes you think.
"[He made] complex ideas simple before your very eyes!" "He is a lively speaker...he
kept me awake when the content of some lectures would have put me out."
