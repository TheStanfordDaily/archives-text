# University to stop funding ASSU by '93
## 
### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
Adrift in a sea of budget cuts, the ASSU may be
forced to remain afloat without the $159,000 it
receives yearly from the University.
The University hopes to reduce funding to the
ASSU by 40 percent for next year and then cut the
remaining funds for the 1992-93 academic year.
Most of the money is used for administrative
costs â€” hiring secretaries and administrators,
rather than paying student salaries.
With the cuts, certain ASSU personnel responsi
bilities, such as those of the ASSU Financial Man
ager, will be restricted to ASSU finances rather
than those of other student organizations.
Currently, according to the ASSU constitution,
student organizations are required to bank with the
ASSU, where their money is stored in several
accounts, including the banking investment firm
Shearson Lehman.
In banking with the ASSU, student organiza
tions basically put their money into a "piggy bank"
at the ASSU, from which it can be withdrawn. With
the proposed budget cuts, the ASSU is hoping to
terminate the banking requirement.
The change will involve reforms to the ASSU
constitution. Senate Chair Kevin Warsh said he
believes certain aspects of the change could be made
informally, while other modifications would have to
include a complete change in by-laws.
Mike Risch, ASSU financial manager, said, "With
the cuts, banking will be an option rather than a
requirement. Student organizations will no longer be
forced to bank with us." Organizations, therefore,
will be given the opportunity to bank with, for exam
ple, Wells Fargo or Bank of America on campus.
Council of Presidents member John Overdeck,
who is on the committee to implement these cuts,
maintains a positive attitude about the lost funding.
"We have to make a big cut, due to all of the bud
get cuts on campus," he said. "And we can do it if the
University would let student groups bank like normal
ones instead of babysitting them like it does now."
Aside from weaning student groups away from
ASSU bank systems, the committee is also ponder
ing the idea of system fees, in which student orga
nizations would have to pay a certain amount of
money just to exist on campus.
Roberta Braden, director of Tresidder, is work
ing with the Internal Revenue Committee for
ASSU budget cuts. "We don't know what sort of
fees might be requested of the groups," she said.
"At this point we are not quite sure what it all
