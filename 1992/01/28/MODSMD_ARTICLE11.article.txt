# Assemblyman reaches out to students in bid for congressional seat
## 
### Craig Kersemeier 
California State Assemblyman
Ted Lempert set his grassroots
campaign for the U.S. House of
Representatives in motion last
night when he addressed a group
of about 20 students at the Law
School.
Lempert, who graduated from
Stanford Law School in 1986, is
running for the seat of former
Stanford Law Prof. Tom Campbell,
who is vying for the U.S. Senate.
Lempert returned to his alma
mater to exhort students to get
involved in the political process.
He said statistics show 18- to
24-year-olds yielding the lowest
voter turnout. Lempert credits
much of this apathy to the increas
ing belief that individuals can not
do much to affect the cumbersome
machinery of government. On the
contrary, he said enthusiastically,
"you can change the government
any time you want."
He cited the recent public out
cry against Gov. Pete Wilson's
proposal to repeal Proposition 98,
which guarantees funding for
public schools. Wilson changed
his position in response to the
public voice.
Lempert said he won his cam
paign for assemblyman in the San
Mateo district the "old-fashioned
way," through door-to-door and
grassroots campaigning, rather
than the more costly television
and radio advertisements and
direct mailing.
He succeeded in becoming the
first Democratic assemblyman in
the San Mateo district in 100
years by spreading his message on
a more personal level and getting
people involved in the campaign.
He told of the amazement of
one man at seeing a candidate
campaign door-to-door. When

asked if he had any suggestions
for legislation proposals, the man
expressed his anger at his 10-
year-old son's ability to rent
pornographic videos from the
local store. Lempert amazed the
man further when he got the
state pornography laws expanded
to include video stores.
Lempert said the incident so
affected the man that he soon got
involved with the Parent-Teacher
Association and is now president
of his local PTA and is consider
ing running for city council.
Lempert's record supports his
reputation as an environmental
and educational candidate. He
wrote an oil-spill law hailed as the
toughest in the nation to protect
the California coastline. He now
fights to eliminate all off-shore
drilling.
Four of five of his proposals for
ethical reform in government
have also been passed since he
took office in 1988. The reforms
primarily seek to sponge corrup
tion out of the government. For
example, the laws prevent politi
cians from accepting payments
for speeches from special interest
groups and also prevent ex-legis
lators from taking advantage of
their friends and connections by
lobbying.
"Some of my colleagues seem
to think they are anointed as
politicians. I see representing the
people as a job that I need to take
seriously," Lempert said, express
ing his desire for a change in style
of representation.
Politicians should be accessible
to the people they represent, he
said, adding that the energy of his
youth helps him to be such an
active politician.
Lempert also encouraged the
Stanford Democrats to increase
voter registration.
