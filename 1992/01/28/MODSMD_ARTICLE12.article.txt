New districts approved
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The state
Supreme Court yesterday approved a
10-year reapportionment plan that
could end two decades of Democratic
dominance of California's Legislature
and congressional delegation.
By a 6-1 vote, the court adopted vir
tually the entire redisricting plan pre
pared by a court-appointed panel after
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed
plans passed by the Democratic-con
trolled Legislature.
The panel of three retired judges
sought to increase minority representa
tion and follow city, county and region
al boundaries. It refused to consider
political representation and the location
of incumbents.
But the plan — if it survives a federal
court test — will have a dramatic impact
on the state's political landscape.
Democrats now have majorities of
47-33 in the state Assembly, 24-13 with
two independents and one vacancy in
the state Senate, and 26-17 in the
state's U.S. House delegation.
Past voting patterns indicate that
Republicans, because of greater turnout
and voter loyalty, are likely to win any
district in which they have at least 40
percent of the registered voters. The

plan adopted Thursday has 42 such dis
tricts in the Assembly, 20 in the Senate
and at least 27 in the state's expanded
52-seat congressional delegation.
Clinton cries lies
NEW YORK (AP) — Democratic
presidential candidate Bill Clinton and
an Arkansas woman accused each other
of lying yesterday in a renewed dispute
over her tabloid assertion that they had
a 12-year affair.
Clinton's campaign organization
sought to discredit Gennifer Flowers
with a notarized statement from a Little
Rock agent who for four years booked
her as a singer and said she never men
tioned Clinton to him.
Flowers' allegations are unsubstanti
ated, and a tape recording played at a
"Star" news conference, said to be of
telephone conversations between Flow
ers and Clinton, did not establish that
there had been an affair. Star paid
Flowers for her story.
Her news conference marked a con
tinuation of the debate over the role of
the media and when questions of mari
tal fidelity should play in a campaign.
"Enough is enough," Democratic
National Committee Chairman Ronald
Brown said in a statement.
