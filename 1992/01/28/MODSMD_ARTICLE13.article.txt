# After the flood
## Low tide reveals minimal damage at Phi Sig house 
### Liesl Olson 
Residents of the Phi Sigma Kappa house returned
to their water-damaged residence yesterday to find
most of their rooms unharmed.
Residents were evacuated Sunday after a faulty
sprinkler on the third floor showered 300 gallons of
water into the wooden structure.
Nearly all of the 26 residents of the self-operated
house had returned by yesterday afternoon, after
spending Sunday night in various places. "It was just
the hassle of not sleeping here. I slept at a friend's
place," said resident Stefan Wallgren, a senior.
Bob Beth, Director of Risk Management, said he
had not heard an estimate of the property damage yet
but he thought it would total around $5,000. "But
that's just my educated guess," he said.
"It was certainly an inconvenience and a disrup
tion," Beth added. "And you can't place a value on
that."
Beth said the University is also checking into the
faulty sprinkler that caused the flood. "We may pur
sue claims against the contractor or manufacturer if
that seems worthwhile," he said.
Beth said students will receive reimbursement for
personal property damaged in the deluge, adding that
students have been put in touch with the insurance
company.
Two women who lived in the third-floor room
where the sprinkler went off lost the most personal
property, including a television set, VCR, books,
clothes, a leather jacket and a bicycle. Their room
remained closed today, as the carpet must be
replaced, according to Diana Conklin, associate direc
tor of Residential Education.
Conklin said the women spent last night in the
guest room of another residence on campus, and that
they received money immediately to replace damaged
books that they need for classes.
Other than the major damage to the third-floor
room as well as the dining room below, occupants of
Phi Sig say they are dealing well with the whole
affair.
As three residents sat watching a soap opera yes
terday, Wallgren said with a smile, "It's smelling like
a wet dog around here."
