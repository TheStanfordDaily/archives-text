## Candid candidate? 
### 
Clinton's closed-mouth
policy regarding affairs
conveniently dishonest

LIKE ANY ELECTION cam
paign since 1980, this year's
presidential race has been
plagued by allegations of extra
marital affairs, particularly those
allegations fired at Arkansas Gov.
Bill Clinton. Sunday night, he gave
what he considered a sufficient
answer to those allegations. The
answer was, in reality, just an
attempt to escape further public
scrutiny.
The character of a candidate is
extremely important in determin
ing how good and trustworthy a
leader he or she will be. If a candi
date has a history of deception,
that candidate's ability to govern
must be questioned.
It is the often-questioned role of
the press to find out if a candidate
has such a history of duplicity, and
whether and how that candidate
has tried to change his or her life
for the better.
More important than any acts a
candidate may have committed in
the past is a candidate's reaction to
allegations of such indiscretions.
Candidates must display that they
are not afraid to be honest with the
people, even if that means admit
ting a mistake in their past. Even
worse than committing various
transgressions would be a sus
tained cover-up attemptor effort to
keep those acts hidden from the
American public.
In the case of Clinton, it has
been apparent throughout the
campaign that he has had marital
troubles, a fact that he admits to.
The most recent allegations, how
ever, are that he has had extramar
ital affairs. He has denied this in
reference to a specific woman,
Gennifer Flowers, but has hedged
on answering whether he has ever
had an affair in general.

On CBS' Sunday night program
"60 Minutes," Clinton stated that
the topic of extramarital affairs
should be discussed nowhere
except between the two married
people involved. This sounds like
an honorable standard, but is in
reality an inappropriate stance for
a presidential candidate to take.
A candidate for president must
anticipate his or her personal life
being held up under a magnifying
glass. Candidates must also be pre
pared to discuss openly their lives,
the wrongs they have committed
and the steps they have taken to
fix those wrongs.
This case of marital infidelity is
not unlike that of Gary Hart. He
challenged the press to follow him,
denying that he was having an
affair. The press took him up on
that, and found that he was indeed
having an affair.
The American public correctly
concluded that anyone who denies
committing an act, challenges
someone else to prove it and then
goes and commits it is clearly not
someone who should lead the
country.
When a candidate is forthcoming
with his or her past troubles, how
ever, and explains his or her subse
quent attempts to correct them,
those issues can be put to rest, and
the candidate can focus on policy
ideas and why he or she should be
elected on political grounds. Hon
esty is definitely the best policy
when it comes to dealing with a
candidate's past. Dishonesty and
cover-ups merely lead to extra focus
on issues that take away from the
real election matters.
Until issues of candidates' per
sonal conduct can be dealt with
honestly, those issues will take the
spotlight every election, resulting
in suspicion and resentment on
the part of the people toward both
the press and the candidates. No
one appreciates being suckered,
and no candidate should try to
sucker the American people into
getting something they aren't
expecting by evading personal
issues.
