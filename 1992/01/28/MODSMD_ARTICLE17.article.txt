## Farewell to my readers 
### 
IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS yesterday
that I was sitting on the branch of the
willow tree in front of our house.
Under my curious eyes, the dirt road that
was the main highway of the village
stretched from the assembly square to
the flooded rice patties.
At sunrise, I saw smoke floating from
the chimneys of every house in the vil
lage. Then the farmers slowly walked by
in crowds of three or five, some smoking
their pipes.
The sheep were being chased to the
grassland. The shepherd was a good
friend of mine. He was several years older
than I was. He always looked out for all
the kids in the village. Occasionally, a
tractor would drive by. My brother would
invariably run out of the house, envious
ly gazing at the noisy machine. He had
always been fascinated by machinery,
especially those that moved.
By sunset, I saw all the lights being
turned on one by one. Then the bats
came out circling in the night sky, fol
lowed by my cousin. She would yell,
"Dong Hao, come home! Dinner's ready."
Not in the wildest dreams of my boy
hood did I know that a place called Stan
ford, an ocean away from where I was
born, would appear in my life. Nor did I
ever imagine that I would be writing in a
foreign language to a foreign audience.
Now that I am in graduate school, for
the most part of my day, I sit in front of a

computer screen. Life has taken on a
sense of urgency. I wonder what future
lies ahead of me. I worry whether I can
finish my research project in time.
One night at about 2 a.m. I was riding
my bike through the Quad back to my
dorm. The gentle yellow rays of the full
moon dropped the shadow of tree leaves
upon me as my own shadow dropped to
the ground, mixing my shadow with that
of the tree.
The sound of rubber sliding against
the pavement moved through space. Sud
denly it stopped. I sat on the curb near
the end of the Quad. I became part of the
scene of shadowy images.
I closed my eyes. I heard the wind
whispering past my face and the sound of
leaves moving ever so slightly. Surround
ed by the sounds of quietude, even the
normally annoying fluorescent lights
were emanating a soothing tone of music.
I opened my eyes. The stained glass
windows of the church were tranquilly
lit. The sight of the cross stood out in the
middle. The white and purple flowers on
the sides brought out the holiness of
creatures standing tall. The majestic
palm trees pointed to the sky. The clouds
above paced so patiently back and forth.
I leaned back against a column, sur
rounded by perfect stillness. I took a large
breath. The cool fresh air carried into my
lungs, and I exhaled the darkness that I
had accumulated. I touched my finger on

the ground. It was like an insect bite. A
cold sting flashed in my brain. It woke me
and energized me.
The pavement stretches into distance
far away from me. I can see flooded rice
patties at the very end. I can see the gold
en kernels of rice dangling on the thin
straw. They nod from side to side with
the wind. There are also a few people in
the fields. Their smiles are as large as the
full moon in the sky.
At the other end of the pavement, I
can see a cluster of red-tiled and sand
stone buildings. I see many people walk
ing and riding their bikes. They are car
rying backpacks and books. Some of them
are laughing and talking to one another.
Some of them are just hurrying to get
somewhere.
I am once again on my willow tree. But
this time, I am not quite as familiar with
all the people walking by. Every day I see
faces flashing by, and I ask myself who
these people are.
I wonder if I can make a connection
between these two worlds.
