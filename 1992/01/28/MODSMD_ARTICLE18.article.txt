Salamanca program cannot be replaced by Santiago

I'M WRITING THIS LETTER as a
last resort to voice my concern over
the loss of the Stanford Program in
Salamanca. Why this program is under
such harsh criticism making it subject to
be cut from next year's budget is a ques
tion I cannot understand.
As a person who has been through
two overseas programs, Salamanca and
Santiago, I feel qualified to make a few
comparisons between these two Spanish
programs and attest to the undeniable
quality of the Salamanca experience.
In Salamanca, students are fully inte
grated into the lifestyle of a Spanish stu
dent. They enter student residences dur
ing the regular Spanish academic sched
ule and begin the acculturation process
immediately by sharing meal times and
other group activities with our dorm
mates.
Academically, students at Salamanca
take three required and two elective
courses given in Spanish by professors of
the University of Salamanca. This gives
them a chance to integrate themselves to
a great degree with Spanish students

and at the same time see the European
system of education in action, an experi
ence offered in few other European pro
grams.
Besides being the site of a great aca
demic program, Salamanca is a wonder
ful place to spend six months. It is a
moderate-sized town during the school
year, and has an incredible history and a
fantastic social ambience famous
throughout Spain. There are few places
where such a perfect blend of an aca
demic and cultural experience can occur.
The Salamanca program has a budget
of under $75,000: less than one-fourth
the cost of several other Stanford Euro
pean programs. Is money the real issue
here? One thing this program does not
offer is the opportunity for Stanford fac
ulty and professors to escape from their
normal activities here at Stanford for a
six-month vacation as is known to occur
at our other European programs.
Is the program being canceled
because it does not play host to Stanford
professors with visions of vacation land?
It is certainly not the Spanish Depart-

ment that wishes to take advantage of
Salamanca this way. It has given in the
past and continues to give its full sup
port to Salamanca in every way possible
from right here at home.
As the overseas student adviser for
Salamanca, I see a continued interest in
keeping the program open. As a newly
declared Spanish major upon my return
to Stanford, I see that this major cer
tainly is not the same without the oppor
tunity for this study abroad experience.
We cannot afford to lose a program of
such high benefits and low cost to the
University.
In regard to the question of one Span
ish program in Santiago being enough, I
must say that indeed Santiago is a very
valuable study abroad experience
although in a very different way. In
Chile, students take classes together,
mostly in English, at a private university
of status in South America and live with
Chilean families where language abilities
develop. There they study topics of great
relevance to the expanding relations
between the United States and South

America: culture, politics, economics and
more.
They get a taste of a culture entirely
different from that which is available in
Spain. Every day as they step out onto
the crowded streets of Santiago their
experience is enriched by an expanding
notion of what a "Third World" develop
ing nation actually is. How can Stanford
even begin to make a comparison
between these two programs of such
enormous difference? Each program has
its own validity academically and cultur
ally for the student, but it would be
unwise to cancel Salamanca with the
idea that Santiago would take its place.
It seems that this decision is one that
comes down to us from the "powers that
be" at the University. It is being unjust
ly made and it is unfair to undergradu
ates. Stanford students want to keep the
Salamanca program, but strings are
being pulled, and what seems to be a
purely political decision is going to leave
us at a great loss.
