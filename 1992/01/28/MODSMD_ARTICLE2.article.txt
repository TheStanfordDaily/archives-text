# Drama slashed but not eliminated
## Fund raising will be focus of skinnier department 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
The Drama Department escaped outright
elimination in the budget-cutting process, but
it still faces massive reductions in its faculty
and operating budget.
In a meeting yesterday, Department Chair
Michael Ramsaur announced the cuts, which
include two of its eight billets for tenured pro
fessors and an additional cut of $180,000 from
its operating budget.
Ramsaur said he found out about the cuts
from Assoc. Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Carolyn Lougee late last week. Cuts will hack
about 30 percent off the drama department
budget, he said, one of the largest departmental
cuts in the school.
But Ramsaur said he was proud of the fact
that drama had initially been targeted to be cut
altogether and had "turned that around."
"It is a substantial cut, but not elimination,"
Ramsaur said. "The University has learned the
importance of the drama department."
Asst. Drama Prof. Maurice Rehm said, "The
initial mood is really black. But one mustn't
forget the whole thing was on the line. The first
thing is that we have a department."
Set-design staff slashed
The cuts automatically involve the elimina
tion of two billets for tenured professors work
ing in set design. These billets leave one billet
for set design remaining, and six tenured slots
altogether.

At a meeting for interested students in Memorial Hall's Green Room yesterday, Drama Department
Chair Michael Ramsaur discusses the cuts his department will make.
Ramsaur said he hoped to get
one of the positions back once the
University is on sounder financial
footing, but Lougee said she
doubted drama will regain a billet.
Ramsaur said the loss of these
positions leaves the design pro
gram with obvious gaps. "A big
hole is left," he said.
Many students said the reduc
tion will cripple the department's
set-design program, impacting
both educational and theatrical
opportunities for students.
Stephanie Cawthon, a sopho
more majoring in drama, said
most drama majors, especially
those in production, are scared
about the future and anxious to
know what is going to happen.
Kira Snyder, a senior drama
major, said, "There are students
interested in design who, given
the cuts, will not be able to take
classes in the field."
"The ultimate impact of cuts
will be a detrimental effect on the
overall undergraduate program,"
Snyder said.
And the gaps in the design pro
gram may also hurt all productions
on campus, according to Monica
Romig, the senior executive produc
er of Ram's Head Theatrical Society.
"This is going to seriously impair
our ability to do shows," she said.
Ramsaur said productions
within the drama department will
suffer as well. "With resources
being reduced as they are, produc
tions will have to be reduced and
made more inexpensive."
"I'm afraid the cuts will cut
down the scope of costumes and
sets and lead to more student
written, student-oriented produc
tions," Snyder said.
Next step: making priorities
Aside from the two faculty posi
tions that have been eliminated, the
rest of the department's cuts "will
come in terms of lecturers, support
staff, departmental and production
funding," Ramsaur said.
"Ultimately, there will be less
teaching" from both faculty and

lecturers and "more graduate stu
dent teaching," he said.
"The highest priority of the
department is keeping an empha
sis on combining theory and prac
tice on the graduate and under
graduate level," Ramsaur said. He
emphasized that the graduate pro
gram is especially important
because "the philosophy of the
graduate program is the philoso
phy of the whole department."
Most of the cuts in the depart
ment will be based on "priority of
program," Ramsaur said, adding
that a series of faculty meetings
will be held to discuss the cuts and
reach a consensus on priorities.
Ramsaur said he would use
these priorities in deciding where
to scale back. "The department will
decide on priorities, not just cut 30
percent out of everything," he said.
Ramsaur said a series of open
meetings could be held to allow
students to voice their opinions.
Ramsaur and Lougee both said
the time frame on the cuts was
undecided.
Ramsaur said he was working
to have the department's budget
reduction target decreased, but
Lougee said the cuts were not
negotiable.
A future of fund raising
The drama department will
have to find creative ways to main
tain the breadth of its program,
Ramsaur said. Some ideas include
a drama theme house, alliances
with theater companies and a mas
ter's program.
Fund raising will also be a key
priority, Ramsaur said. "It's clear
that in this monetary climate we
have to go out further."
The drive to raise money may
be an unexpected benefit of the
cuts, according to Romig. "I think
the Drama Department will final
ly start recruiting funds that will
help it stay around," she said.
Romig said the impact of the
cuts on Ram's Head is uncertain,
and that "It is time for Ram's
Head and the Drama Department
to talk and see how we can mutu
ally benefit each other."
