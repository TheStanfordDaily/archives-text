# Drama slashed but not eliminated
## Fund raising will be focus of skinnier department 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
The Drama Department escaped outright
elimination in the budget-cutting process, but
it still faces massive reductions in its faculty
and operating budget.
In a meeting yesterday, Department Chair
Michael Ramsaur announced the cuts, which
include two of its eight billets for tenured pro
fessors and an additional cut of $180,000 from
its operating budget.
Ramsaur said he found out about the cuts
from Assoc. Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Carolyn Lougee late last week. Cuts will hack
about 30 percent off the drama department
budget, he said, one of the largest departmental
cuts in the school.
But Ramsaur said he was proud of the fact
that drama had initially been targeted to be cut
altogether and had "turned that around."
"It is a substantial cut, but not elimination,"
Ramsaur said. "The University has learned the
importance of the drama department."
Asst. Drama Prof. Maurice Rehm said, "The
initial mood is really black. But one mustn't
forget the whole thing was on the line. The first
thing is that we have a department."
Set-design staff slashed
The cuts automatically involve the elimina
tion of two billets for tenured professors work
ing in set design. These billets leave one billet
for set design remaining, and six tenured slots
altogether.
