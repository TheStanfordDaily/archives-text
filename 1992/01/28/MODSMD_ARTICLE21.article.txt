## Card hosts Broncos in season-opener 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team will officially open its
season today at 2 p.m. when the Cardinal takes on
the Broncos of Santa Clara at Sunken Diamond.
Mead coach Mark Marquess will begin his 16th sea
son on the farm — with a team which is experienced
but at the same time inexperienced, established yet
full of questions.
The last meeting between these two — in last
year's West II regional playoffs — resulted in a 4-2
victory for the Broncos, and was the beginning of the
end for the *91 Cardinal team, which was ousted by
Fresno State two games later.
But '92 brings a brand spankin' new year, and a
chance for Stanford to establish itself once again
among the nation's elite in college baseball. Howev
er, this year's Cardinal remains a bit of a mystery.
While several sources — including Collegiate Base
hall and Baseball America — have ranked Stanford
in the top 15 in preseason rankings, others have
been skeptical as to what the Card's success level will
be — pointing to unproven bats, inexperienced posi
tion players, lack of power, and a questionable
recruiting class.
Stanford returns five starters in the field: junior
center fielder Jeffrey Hammonds, and seniors David
Holbrook, second baseman Chris Kemper, right
fielder Steve Solomon, and David Cornell, who coin
cidentally played for Santa Clara his first two years
of college. Of these, only Hammonds has established
himself as a national caliber batter. However, the
others have shown occasional flashes of strong hit
ting, and will most likely need to perform well all
season in order for the Cardinal to assert the much
needed consistency that is often the Stanford base
ball bugaboo.
Catcher, third base, shortstop, first base, and left
field will all most likely sport new starters. Senior
Mark Skeels, who has platooned at catcher and third
in the past, will probably be the full time receiver,
and as a switch-hitter could be a valuable asset at the
plate. The new shortstop will be sophomore Matt
Bokemeier, who along with reserve second baseman
Jeff DesJardins, adds batting depth to the lineup.
First base will be played by Holbrook, moving across
the diamond from his third base job of a year ago.
Similarly, Cornell will move from his starting desig
nated hitter and occasional outfielding job of a year
ago to a permanent position in left. The starter at
third base may be a question, with the nod possibly
going to senior Tony Detter.
This year will most likely be another year of out
standing defensive play for the Cardinal. While hit
ting ability may not be readily apparent, strong
defense has always been characteristic of a Mark
Marquess team, and will probably continue to be so
in '92. Another feature of this year's Cardinal is
great team speed, especially in the outfield. How-

ever, perhaps the biggest mystery
for the Cardinal this year is the
power hitting. Someone, maybe
Hammonds, will need to step up
and be the replacement for David
McCarty.
Unfortunately for coach Mar
quess, two of Stanford's top
recruits opted to turn pro follow
ing their graduation from high
school. However, the recruiting
class could turn out to be better
than expected. Included among
the new players is junior college
transfer right-handed pitcher
Rick Helling, who in 1990 went 9-
1 with a 1.80 earned run average.
The pitching will once again
be excellent for the Cardinal.
Returning starters include

juniors Jamie Sepeda, Brian
Sackinsky, and sophomore
Willie Adams. The bullpen will
feature such veterans as sopho
more Andrew Lorraine; juniors
Tim Moore, Greg Mix and Chris
Holcombe; and senior Steve
Worrell, who is reportedly fully
recovered from his injury. Left
ies Holcombe, Lorraine, and
Worrell may be called upon quite
often, as all three of Stanford's
starters are right-handed.
In all, Stanford will offer a
team loaded once again with a lot
of potential. Major questions will,
however, need to be answered in
order for the Cardinal to be a
force in the ever powerful Six-
Pac.
But one thing is for certain —
baseball season is once again
upon us, and the great American
pastime should be as exciting as
ever here on the Farm.
