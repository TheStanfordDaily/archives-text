# Fencers leave mark on East Coast foes
## Success at Penn State builds confidence heading into regionals 
### Steven Salcedo Staff writer 
Despite a stiff competitive field and the
absence of Olympic hopeful Nick Bravin, the
Stanford men's and women's fencing squads
managed to raise more than a few eyebrows en
route to a strong finish at last weekend's Penn
State Invitational.
The competition, composed of traditional
ly strong East Coast schools, included the
likes of Duke, Cornell, Northwestern, North
Carolina, and Penn State. Nonetheless, the
men's team managed to post a respectable 3-
2 record, the losses by only one point. With a
little luck, they might have finished the tour
nament 4-1.
Geoff Donaker, who managed a 13-5 record
on the foil squad, pointed out that even
though "We beat Duke, Cornell, and North
western, we could've done a better job."
The squad's performance becomes all the
more impressive when one considers that top

'If we beat Air Force, we'll
be in very good shape
and have an excellent
chance of going to
NCAAs.'
â€” Jeremy Nelson

fencer Nick Bravin was away, competing for
the World Cup in Paris.
Jeremy Nelson, a senior on the epee squad,
conceded that "having Nick would have made a
big difference" but is quick to point out that
even without him "we fulfilled our expecta
tions."
Both Leonard D'Ainico, saber, and Sam
Kim, foil, agreed that the team's performance
at the invitational "went extremely well." Kim
added, "it has definitely helped us" in building

our confidence for the Western Regionals.
The women's teams received another out
standing performance from Lana Kang, who
according to Nelson, "had a very good day."
Sophomore Thea Wojtkowski, who along with
Kang, is a returning member from the
women's squad of the previous year, managed
to put in a solid performance as well.
The next step for the Stanford squads is the
Western Regionals, which should be a repeat
of the Stanford Collegiate Open, in which the
team soundly thrashed its opponents on its
way to an easy victory.
Nelson, however, cautions that "Air Force
is the mystery team" since it is one of the few
West Coast schools Stanford has not faced this
year. "If we beat Air Force," Nelson said,
"we'll be in very good shape and have an excel
lent chance of going to NCAAs."
Kim, in a mood of reserved assurance, pre
dicts that the Western Regionals will be
"another step (for Stanford) on the ladder to
the NCAA finals." Only time will tell.
