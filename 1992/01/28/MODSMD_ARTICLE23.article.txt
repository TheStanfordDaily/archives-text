UC-Davis frosh squad off the

Jason Weaver teased the shorter
Aggies for 25 points and grabbed
12 rebounds, while 6-9 freshmen
forwards Bart Lammersen and
Todd Manley played keep-away
inside, combining for 25 points.
"They did a great job of lobbing
over our post defense," said Davis
head coach Foti Mellis. "Our guys
were a little intimidated out
there," he continued.
Stanford leapfrogged past the
Aggies in the opening minutes for
a ten-point lead, but Davis fought
back to within seven at the 2-
minute 17-second mark. Smaller,
quicker Aggie forwards Andy
Webber and Duncan Fletcher
spun through the key to make the
score 33-26.
"It took a little adjustment for
us. We're used to playing big guys
like Adam, Jim and Paul in prac

tice, and these shorter guys sur
prised us," Lammersen said.
Manley was literally faked out
of his shoes on one play and paid
dearly, as he suffered a moderate
right ankle sprain and headed for
the locker room with 14:3.5
remaining.
"That's the penalty for being
beat on defense," Manley
explained. Team physicians said
they must wait until doctors
examine him today to determine
hov. long he will be out.
With Manley gone, the offense
could no longer depend on three
big men inside and began to sput
ter at times due to frequent sub
stitution.
"We changed what we were
doing on offense with the subs. It
isn't their fault, just that they
haven't been running with us,"
Seandel said.
But the Cardinal was never
seriously challenged despite these
few snafus, and players who usu
ally warm the bench during varsi
ty competition saw quality time
on the floor.
"We were playing mix-and
match, throw some guys out
there and see how they do," Sean
del said.
Mellis, who guides Davis' 18-
freshmen squad through a 23-
game schedule against junior
colleges throughout the state,
shares Seandel's sentiment.
"Our philosophy is to play as
many people as possible for quali
ty minutes. We prepare people for
varsity ball down the road and
getting the win isn't as impor
tant," Mellis said.
Seandel said the game "was for
them to learn. It's tough to play
against Davis, a team that han
dles the ball well."
However, pesky defense by
reserve guard Bobby Patton
snuffed out any rallies the young
Aggies began putting together.
Patton broke up several passes
and converted turnovers into
points for the Cardinal.
"Every time we'd get some
thing going, we'd turn the ball
over or give Stanford offensive
rebounding," Mellis said.
The Cardinal enjoyed a 45-27
rebounding margin that opened
up the perimeter in the second

half. Guard Warren Gravely tal
lied three treys and extended
the lead to 16 with 3:45 remain
ing.
Stanford's JV played only
three games this season, due to
scheduling problems with junior
colleges, according to Seandel.
"They're in the middle of league
play right now and wouldn't take
the time out to give us a shot,"
Seandel said.
Seandel hopes the JVs can
schedule upward of 12 to 15
games for the 1992-1993 cam
paign, but says the final decision
is left to varsity head coach Mike
Montgomery.
Besides, the reserve varsity
players, crowd favorite and bas
ketball manager Mike Sandoval
received some time. This last JV
game offered him the chance to
play in Maples in a Stanford uni
form, though he entered the
game with less than two minutes
to go.
"You're the last one to get out
there. I felt the electricity when I
stepped on the court," Sandoval
raved.

But the Cardinal was never
seriously challenged despite these
few snafus, and players who usu
ally warm the bench during varsi
ty competition saw quality time
on the floor.
"We were playing mix-and
match, throw some guys out
there and see how they do," Sean
del said.
Mellis, who guides Davis' 18-
freshmen squad through a 23-
game schedule against junior
colleges throughout the state,
shares Seandel's sentiment.
"Our philosophy is to play as
many people as possible for quali
ty minutes. We prepare people for
varsity ball down the road and
getting the win isn't as impor
tant," Mellis said.
Seandel said the game "was for
them to learn. It's tough to play
against Davis, a team that han
dles the ball well."
However, pesky defense by
reserve guard Bobby Patton
snuffed out any rallies the young
Aggies began putting together.
Patton broke up several passes
and converted turnovers into
points for the Cardinal.
"Every time we'd get some
thing going, we'd turn the ball
over or give Stanford offensive
rebounding," Mellis said.
The Cardinal enjoyed a 45-27
rebounding margin that opened
up the perimeter in the second

half. Guard Warren Gravely tal
lied three treys and extended
the lead to 16 with 3:45 remain
ing.
Stanford's JV played only
three games this season, due to
scheduling problems with junior
colleges, according to Seandel.
"They're in the middle of league
play right now and wouldn't take
the time out to give us a shot,"
Seandel said.
Seandel hopes the JVs can
schedule upward of 12 to 15
games for the 1992-1993 cam
paign, but says the final decision
is left to varsity head coach Mike
Montgomery.
Besides, the reserve varsity
players, crowd favorite and bas
ketball manager Mike Sandoval
received some time. This last JV
game offered him the chance to
play in Maples in a Stanford uni
form, though he entered the
game with less than two minutes
to go.
"You're the last one to get out
there. I felt the electricity when I
stepped on the court," Sandoval
raved.
