Jason Weaver teased the shorter
Aggies for 25 points and grabbed
12 rebounds, while 6-9 freshmen
forwards Bart Lammersen and
Todd Manley played keep-away
inside, combining for 25 points.
"They did a great job of lobbing
over our post defense," said Davis
head coach Foti Mellis. "Our guys
were a little intimidated out
there," he continued.
Stanford leapfrogged past the
Aggies in the opening minutes for
a ten-point lead, but Davis fought
back to within seven at the 2-
minute 17-second mark. Smaller,
quicker Aggie forwards Andy
Webber and Duncan Fletcher
spun through the key to make the
score 33-26.
"It took a little adjustment for
us. We're used to playing big guys
like Adam, Jim and Paul in prac

tice, and these shorter guys sur
prised us," Lammersen said.
Manley was literally faked out
of his shoes on one play and paid
dearly, as he suffered a moderate
right ankle sprain and headed for
the locker room with 14:3.5
remaining.
"That's the penalty for being
beat on defense," Manley
explained. Team physicians said
they must wait until doctors
examine him today to determine
hov. long he will be out.
With Manley gone, the offense
could no longer depend on three
big men inside and began to sput
ter at times due to frequent sub
stitution.
"We changed what we were
doing on offense with the subs. It
isn't their fault, just that they
haven't been running with us,"
Seandel said.
But the Cardinal was never
seriously challenged despite these
few snafus, and players who usu
ally warm the bench during varsi
ty competition saw quality time
on the floor.
"We were playing mix-and
match, throw some guys out
there and see how they do," Sean
del said.
