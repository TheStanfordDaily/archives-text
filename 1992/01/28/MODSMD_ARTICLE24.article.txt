# Injury finishes Shasby's season

### Gretchen Atwood Editorial staff 
The dual meet season has yet
to begin and the Stanford
women's tennis team has lost
starter Kim Shasby for the year.
The freshman underwent
knee surgery yesterday to repair
a tear through 80 percent of the
anterior cruciate ligament of
her right knee. The anterior
cruciate ligaments run diagonal
ly across the knee, between the
tibia and the femur. They sup
port the knee and prevent over
bending and overstraightening.
A ligament tear requires an
extensive rehabilitation period.
I n the best-case scenario Shasby
will start hitting again in four
months, but rehabilitation will
most likely take longer.
Anterior cruciate ligament
reconstructive surgery "usually
leaves [the patient] with 8-10
months of intense rehabilita
tion, followed by wearing a knee
brace for the next year," said
Stanford head trainer Stanley
Scott.
With the loss of Shasby, a
projected starter in the lower
half of the lineup, the team will
have to adjust.
"We haven't conceived of a
game plan yet," said Lele
Forood, Stanford assistant
women's tennis coach. "They
didn't know how bad it was
until they got inside. If it had
been a minor tear, she could
have played this season."
The doubles lineup will also
have to be juggled. Shasby's
partner, Kristine Kurth, will
have to form a new tandem with
a different partner.
Kurth and Shasby have both
been sidelined since the Nation

al College Classic in mid-Jan
uary, when Kurth strained her
back and Shasby twisted her
knee.
"She was hitting a backhand
and really turned [her knee] too
far," Forood said. "She got it
taped and played two doubles
matches. It obviously wasn't
hurting her badly."
Although she may have torn
the ligament on that play, it
might have occurred later. "She
was functional and had good
stability," Scott said. "It
appeared to be a mild strain."
Last week Shasby got an
MRI (magnetic resonance
imaging) scan and team physi
cian Dr. Don Bunce recom
mended a scope of the knee.
The tear was discovered yester
day during exploratory
surgery.
To repair the ligament, some
tendon was taken from the out
side of the knee and transplant
ed to the inside of the knee to
replace the torn ligament. The
transplanted tendon was
anchored by two bony ends.
"It takes time for the tissue
to adapt and the bony end plates
have to heal, like a fracture,"
Scott said. "Most [patients]
return to former function. It's a
common surgery with good
results. There is no reason to
expect complications."
Anterior cruciate ligament
injuries are most common in
sports that jar the knees or
involve quick changes of direc
tion. "Its the most common lig
ament to be damaged," Scott
said. "It is stressed under a lot
of common mechanisms —
sudden stops, twists." Soccer,
