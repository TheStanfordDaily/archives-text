# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Though at different points in their sea
sons, swimming's Lea Loveless and volley
ball's Dave Goss are in mid-season form. For
being razor sharp, they earn Athlete of the
Week honors.
Goss, a junior outside hitter, capped off a
strong week with a phenomenal performance
against San Diego State in the Cardinal's
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion opener.

In the women's swimming team's home
finale against California, Loveless set a new
Pacific 10 Conference record in the 200-yard
backstroke.
The transfer from Florida swam a blister
ing time of 1 minute 56.38 seconds. That
mark also ranked as a new deGuerre Pool
record.
Loveless led a Stanford sweep in the 100
back with a time of 55.39 seconds.
With the two individual wins and a victory
in the 400 Medley Relay, Loveless helped the
No. 1 Cardinal thrash the No. 5 Bears, 183-
78. Also noteworthy were pool records set by
Lori Heisick, Janel Jorgensen, Jenny Thomp
son and Mary Ellen Blanchard. Summer
Sanders blew away the 400 Individual Medley
field in 4:08.58.
Loveless and the Cardinal will now focus
on the Pac-10 Championships Feb. 7-9 in
Long Beach.
❖ ❖
While Loveless streaked through the
water, Dave Goss soared through the air.
Goss clobbered the San Diego State Aztecs
Saturday with 17 kills and a .500 hitting
percentage. Also sharp on defense, he tal
lied 13 digs in the 15-7, 15-9, 15-7 Stanford
victory.
After a preseason tournament in which
Goss had 30 kills in one match, Cardinal
coach Ruben Nieves said, "Dave was our best
hitter during the weekend, no doubt about it.
He's developing into the type of hitter that we

can go to in any situation and feel really good
about the volley ending there."
Against Cal on Tuesday, Goss pounded 12
kills and hit .500. The Bears succumbed 15-
3, 15-11, 15-3. "Goss had an outstanding
hitting match," Nieves said. "He has the
ability, and the arm swing, to hit from the
back as well as the front. It takes a special
kind of athlete to carry that kind of hitting
load."
