The Stanford women gymnasts continued
to ride their roller coaster season last night as
they lost a close meet against the women of
Utah State.

Women's gymnastics

Aggies 189.30
Cardinal 187.05

Although the Cardinal tried to hold their
ground in Logan, they finished with 187.05
points, not enough to surpass Utah State's
189.30 points. "We had a pretty good meet,"
said coach Breck Greenwood. Although the
gymnasts competed well in three events,
their unusually mediocre performances on
the vault led to their defeat.
The team had excellent beam perfor
mances, taking home the top three scores in
the event. Freshman Katie Clancy led the
way for the Cardinal with 9.60 points, earn
ing her sole claim to first place. Freshman
Jene Elzie tied for second place with a score of
9.55, while sophomore Kerrie Kelley pulled
up the rear for the Stanford women with a
score of 9.50.
Another highlight of the team's perfor
mance was the floor exercise. Sophomore
Kerri Kanuka tied for first place with a score
of 9.65, while Elzie earned a 9.55, and a piece
of the third place ribbon. Freshman Tina
Snowden also helped lead the Cardinal on the
floor, scoring 9.40 points.
On the uneven bars, Kanuka once again
led the pack with a first place score of 9.65.
Stanford was also led by Clancy and junior
Erin McCann, who earned 9.55 and 9.45,
respectively.
The event that seemingly cost the Stan
ford women the victory was the vault exer
cise. After scoring excellent scores in last
week's home meet against Cal State-Fuller
ton, the Cardinal's top vault score against
Utah State was only 9.50, earned by both
Kanuka and Elzie. Sophomore Laurie West
rounded out the top three scores for Stand
ford with 9.0 points.
Greenwood recognizes the team's incon
sistency on the event, but has faith in their
talent. "If we hit vault, we might beat a top
-12 team," he said.
In the all-around competition, Elzie placed
third with a score of 37.50 points. Clancy
scored 37.30 points, while sophomore Mollie
Brown earned 36.50 points.
One of the highlights of the meet was the
performance given by sophomore Kerri Kanu
ka. Bouncing back from surgery a few months
ago, Kanuka proved that she still had what it

took to compete — and to win — as she helped
lead the way for the Cardinal. "Kerri had three
solid events," Greenwood said.
Despite the loss, neither the team's spirit
nor their confidence in their talent has suf
fered any damage. As Clancy said, "Our team

has great potential. It is simply a matter of
getting out on the floor and doing what we
know how to do."
The Cardinal women will get their next
chance to show just what they can do Friday
night at Burnham against Arizona.
