# Program in Greece unearths mysteries; students find ancient city of Panakton
## 
### Michelle Duran 
Last summer when 14 Stanford
students went to Greece to
unearth some history, they got a
lesson in contemporary Greek cul
ture as well.
Under the auspices of Classics
Asst. Prof. Mark Munn and Clas
sics Lecturer Mary Lou Munn,
the students excavated the
ancient city of Panakton and lived
in a rural village nearby.
The Stanford in Greece pro
gram has brought students to that
country for the past six years, but
"getting the dig permit was a pro
cess that took from 1985 till now,"
Mark Munn said. The Stanford
group is one of five American
groups currently digging in Greece
and the only one working on an
unexcavated site.
The Munns and their students
have has spent the last six years
surveying 120 mountainous sites
and conducting surface tours,
analyzing relics found on the sur
face, Mary Lou Munn said.
The couple chose the site of
Panakton — an Athens outpost
from the 3rd to 4th Century B.C.
— because it "was the most
important Athenian garrison fort
on the frontier with Boiotia," an
ancient city-state nearby, he said.
Previous excavations have con
centrated only on city centers.
The Munns hope to gather new
information on weaponry, city
suppliers and ancient rural econo
my from the remote site.
In one of the test trenches they
unexpectedly discovered that
Panakton was busy during the
Bronze Age in 1700 8.C., during
the height of the Mycenaean age.
The biggest surprise, however,
was a church made of ancient
blocks, complete with inscriptions
and an altar table built by Frank
ish crusaders, who used it in the
14th century A.D.
Panakton's other asset is that it
is mentioned by a number of con

temporary sources, including the
Greek historian Thucydides. It will
be an "example of correlation
between archaeological and histor
ical evidence," said Mark Munn.
The archaeological team lived
for eight weeks in a village of only
500 people. Most of the students
lived in an apartment over a
Greek taverna. Up to six people
occupied one room, and 20 people
shared two bathrooms.
According to senior Holly Deal,
the trip was "definitely a bonding
experience, to say the least."
The cultural experience im
pressed students as much as the
digging. The Greeks in the village
lived at a different pace, Deal said.
"There was so little stress there
and it seemed families were very
important [and] not centered
around the TV and radio," she
said. "It was much more of a social
community — people spent hours
and hours talking . . . much slower
but much more pleasant."
The students, however, didn't
have a lot of leisure time. Most days,
Deal said, they were up at 6:30 a.m.
and did not return until 8 p.m.
Lack of personal space was also
an issue. "We didn't have a lot of
time when we weren't eating
together or working together,"
said senior Amy Welch. "We
learned to live cooperatively."
Most of the Stanford students
knew some Greek, but many knew
only enough to go to the markets,
Welch said. The Greek members of
the team, however, surprised them
by knowing many languages.
Near the end of the dig, the team
displayed some of the finds to the vil
lage. In two hours nearly 400 people
from the area came by to view the
collection of pottery shards, statue
pieces and some of the 16,000 bone
fragments the group unearthed,
including a child's skull that was
nicknamed Little Leland.
"The thing that struck me the
most was how interested they
were in what we were doing,"

Deal said. Many of the villagers
were so enthusiastic about the
project that they offered housing
and free storage for next summer.
One of the displays, a well-pre
served ninth-century marble head,
probably of Zeus, was "the most
intriguing and spectacular single
find and holds great promise for the
future [digsl," Mark Munn said.

The Stanford team plans to
return in 1992 and 1993 to dig
and hopes to extend the permit
after that.
The experience put things in a
different perspective for many of
the students. "I didn't think a pot
shard would excite me," Deal said,
"but by the end of the trip a piece
with some paint would."

knew some Greek, but many knew
only enough to go to the markets,
Welch said. The Greek members of
the team, however, surprised them
by knowing many languages.
Near the end of the dig, the team
displayed some of the finds to the vil
lage. In two hours nearly 400 people
from the area came by to view the
collection of pottery shards, statue
pieces and some of the 16,000 bone
fragments the group unearthed,
including a child's skull that was
nicknamed Little Leland.
"The thing that struck me the
most was how interested they
were in what we were doing,"

Deal said. Many of the villagers
were so enthusiastic about the
project that they offered housing
and free storage for next summer.
One of the displays, a well-pre
served ninth-century marble head,
probably of Zeus, was "the most
intriguing and spectacular single
find and holds great promise for the
future [digsl," Mark Munn said.

The Stanford team plans to
return in 1992 and 1993 to dig
and hopes to extend the permit
after that.
The experience put things in a
different perspective for many of
the students. "I didn't think a pot
shard would excite me," Deal said,
"but by the end of the trip a piece
with some paint would."

Senior Mark Seielstad and Sharon Gerstel, a graduate student at the
Institute for Fine Arts in New York, survey the Frankish Church at
Panakton, the ancient city they excavated in Greece last summer.
Last summer when 14 Stanford
students went to Greece to
unearth some history, they got a
lesson in contemporary Greek cul
ture as well.
Under the auspices of Classics
Asst. Prof. Mark Munn and Clas
sics Lecturer Mary Lou Munn,
the students excavated the
ancient city of Panakton and lived
in a rural village nearby.
The Stanford in Greece pro
gram has brought students to that
country for the past six years, but
"getting the dig permit was a pro
cess that took from 1985 till now,"
Mark Munn said. The Stanford
group is one of five American
groups currently digging in Greece
and the only one working on an
unexcavated site.
The Munns and their students
have has spent the last six years
surveying 120 mountainous sites
and conducting surface tours,
analyzing relics found on the sur
face, Mary Lou Munn said.
The couple chose the site of
Panakton — an Athens outpost
from the 3rd to 4th Century B.C.
— because it "was the most
important Athenian garrison fort
on the frontier with Boiotia," an
ancient city-state nearby, he said.
Previous excavations have con
centrated only on city centers.
The Munns hope to gather new
information on weaponry, city
suppliers and ancient rural econo
my from the remote site.
In one of the test trenches they
unexpectedly discovered that
Panakton was busy during the
Bronze Age in 1700 8.C., during
the height of the Mycenaean age.
The biggest surprise, however,
was a church made of ancient
blocks, complete with inscriptions
and an altar table built by Frank
ish crusaders, who used it in the
14th century A.D.
Panakton's other asset is that it
is mentioned by a number of con

temporary sources, including the
Greek historian Thucydides. It will
be an "example of correlation
between archaeological and histor
ical evidence," said Mark Munn.
The archaeological team lived
for eight weeks in a village of only
500 people. Most of the students
lived in an apartment over a
Greek taverna. Up to six people
occupied one room, and 20 people
shared two bathrooms.
According to senior Holly Deal,
the trip was "definitely a bonding
experience, to say the least."
The cultural experience im
pressed students as much as the
digging. The Greeks in the village
lived at a different pace, Deal said.
"There was so little stress there
and it seemed families were very
important [and] not centered
around the TV and radio," she
said. "It was much more of a social
community — people spent hours
and hours talking . . . much slower
but much more pleasant."
The students, however, didn't
have a lot of leisure time. Most days,
Deal said, they were up at 6:30 a.m.
and did not return until 8 p.m.
Lack of personal space was also
an issue. "We didn't have a lot of
time when we weren't eating
together or working together,"
said senior Amy Welch. "We
learned to live cooperatively."
