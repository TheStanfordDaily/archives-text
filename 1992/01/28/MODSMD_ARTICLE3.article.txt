# No more lines: Ax to fall on ticket office
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
If recommendations to slash the
$50,000 annual subsidy to the Tresid
der Ticket Office are implemented,
students will have to trek over to the
Athletic Ticketing Office to make their
purchases — and programmers are
worried their events will suffer from
the inconvenience.
The proposal by Tresidder Union
directors effectively eliminates the ser
vice. Tresidder Assistant Director

Nanci Howe emphasized the plan was
tentative, but said she expects the sub
sidy to be cut.
Both Howe and Cheryl St. Clair-
Hammitt, the manager of the ticket
office, said the problem was that the
ticket office could not break even.
"It's very labor-intensive," St.
Clair-Hammitt said. "The fee we get
for selling the tickets doesn't cover the
labor costs."
Ticket-office transactions also make
up 75 percent of Tresidder's account
ing workload, according to Roberta

Braden, the director of Tresidder.
She said "prices would have to be
raised substantially" to cover the large
subsidy that supports the ticket office.
But according to St. Clair-Ham
mitt, the ticket office was never really
given a chance to cut its losses. "No
one told us, 'Cut your deficit or you'll
be closed.' It just happened.
"The problem is that you don't have
to go through the ticket office to sell
tickets here. If someone at the Universi
ty were directing groups to use the tick
et office, we could break even," she said.

Howe said the directors have been
considering several other ticket office
alternatives, such as leasing ticketing
services to outside agents or using the
Athletic Ticketing Office to sell tickets.
"We realize there are negative
aspects to this," Howe said. "[The Ath
letic Office] is off-campus and isn't
quite as convenient for students and
faculty. But we're in financially con
strained times."
The loss of the ticket office means
more than inconvenience for several per
forming arts groups, though. "Many stu
dent groups really depend on the advance
ticket sales from Tresidder," said St. Clair-
Hammitt.
She said Lively Arts performances will
be affected the most, as they account for
more than half of all Tresidder ticket sales.
Lois Wagner, director of Lively Arts,
said it would be difficult to find a new ser
vice, especially in light of the cuts her pro

gram has already taken.
"There's a task force being put together
to discuss this, and I hope they realize that
without a central ticket office, people are
going to be scattered in a hundred differ
ent directions," Wagner said.
"This is going to affect us quite severely."
The ticket office also serves the Concert
Network and student groups such as the
Ram's Head Theatrical Society.
This cut comprises almost a fifth of the
total $256,000 that Tresidder must cut.
Other moves the directors are recom
mending include cutting back hours and
eliminating programs such as classes and
noon concerts.
