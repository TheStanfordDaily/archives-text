# No more lines: Ax to fall on ticket office

If recommendations to slash the
$50,000 annual subsidy to the Tresid
der Ticket Office are implemented,
students will have to trek over to the
Athletic Ticketing Office to make their
purchases â€” and programmers are
worried their events will suffer from
the inconvenience.
The proposal by Tresidder Union
directors effectively eliminates the ser
vice. Tresidder Assistant Director

Nanci Howe emphasized the plan was
tentative, but said she expects the sub
sidy to be cut.
Both Howe and Cheryl St. Clair-
Hammitt, the manager of the ticket
office, said the problem was that the
ticket office could not break even.
"It's very labor-intensive," St.
Clair-Hammitt said. "The fee we get
for selling the tickets doesn't cover the
labor costs."
Ticket-office transactions also make
up 75 percent of Tresidder's account
ing workload, according to Roberta

Braden, the director of Tresidder.
She said "prices would have to be
raised substantially" to cover the large
subsidy that supports the ticket office.
But according to St. Clair-Ham
mitt, the ticket office was never really
given a chance to cut its losses. "No
one told us, 'Cut your deficit or you'll
be closed.' It just happened.
"The problem is that you don't have
to go through the ticket office to sell
tickets here. If someone at the Universi
ty were directing groups to use the tick
et office, we could break even," she said.

Howe said the directors have been
considering several other ticket office
alternatives, such as leasing ticketing
services to outside agents or using the
Athletic Ticketing Office to sell tickets.
"We realize there are negative
aspects to this," Howe said. "[The Ath
letic Office] is off-campus and isn't
quite as convenient for students and
faculty. But we're in financially con
strained times."
The loss of the ticket office means
