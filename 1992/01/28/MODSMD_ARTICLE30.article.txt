The Daily incorrectly reported
that Communication Prof. James
Risser was named one of 65
jurors who will screen entries for
this year's Pulitzer Prize.
Risser is a member of the
Pulitzer Prize Board, which
makes the final decision on the
winners. He was elected to the
board in 1989 and continues to
serve on it.
