## Sex assault info. center scrambles for next year's funding 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Six months after sexual assault
prevention was centralized at
Stanford, advocates are scram
bling for funds to ensure the sur
vival of the Sexual Assault Infor
mation and Resource Center.
Epstein, whose title is "Coordi
nator of Student Sexual Assault
Prevention Education and Refer
ral Resources," recently submitted
an 82-page activity report detailing
her activity during summer and
fall quarters, from interacting
with victims to providing materials
and referrals to fielding requests
for information and programs.
The report was requested by
three administrators, as well as

the ASSU Senate.
Epstein's posi
tion was estab
lished by the sen
ate last spring
when it decided
to fund the pro
gram for one year
out of emergency
reserve funds.
"Since the Uni-

versity was being too slow to act
on the issue, we wanted to give
everyone a kick in the pants,"
ASSU Council of Presidents mem
ber John Overdeck said.
The intention of the one-year
funding project was to start up the
program and then allow the Uni
versity to take the reins and sup
port it financially, said Epstein,

who graduated last year.
But because the office does not
fall specifically under any Univer
sity department or area, no one
knows where continued funds
would — or should — come from.
"It's been a bureaucratic tangle
and we still haven't gotten a
straight answer if the University is
going to pay for it," said Overdeck,
a graduate student.
Although Cowell's Sexual
Assault Response and Recovery
Team will be funded for next year,
Cowell Student Health Center
Director Harvey Weinstein said
he was not sure about the future
of Epstein's position and the
resource center.
Weinstein said he was "not
sure where the funds will come

from in the school," since the Uni
versity does not have the money
to maintain Epstein's office and
the center.
The ASSU cannot afford to sup
port the office for another year
either, Overdeck said, but they are
considering a student fee to cover
the costs.
Epstein said this option is a
"last resort" because with the stu
dent fee, the center will be run by
students instead of a full-time staff
member. She said a student staff
could not accomplish as much as a
full-time coordinator because stu
dents "have a life" and cannot
make the center their top priority.
Epstein added that she is

currently seeking private
donors who would help fund the
program for next year.
Overdeck said a new federal
financial aid bill established a $20
million grant for sexual assault
prevention, and he would like to
see "whatever pressure is neces
sary" put on the University to
seek this and other funding.
Epstein said she originally met
with University President Donald
Kennedy last spring with a pro
posal for the center, several pro
p-ams and the coordinator posi
tion she now holds.
In this informal meeting,
Epstein said, Kennedy tentatively
agreed to fund the center and the
programs, but not the coordinator
position.
Although Epstein contacted
Kennedy for a confirmation of his
support, she received no response
until over six weeks later.
"When I heard nothing after
six weeks, I then approached the
(ASSU) senate for funding,"
Epstein said. Eventually, all of
the components of the proposal,
including the coordinator posi
tion, were funded by the ASSU.
Concerning continuing funding
for the center and Epstein's posi
tion, Kennedy said, "the Presi

dent's office is never responsible
for such budget-based funding
commitments. They must compete
in the regular budget process."
Kennedy said he "made no
commitments beyond funding for
some one-time equipment needs."
Weinstein said he and Dean of
Students Michael Jackson "care
about [sexual assault preventionl
a great deal," and wanted "to take
the time to peruse and discuss"
the activity report.

"We're not ready to comment
specifically on the report yet,"
Weinstein said.
Position has 'raised awareness'
Overdeck said Epstein has
"established" the importance of
the position, and the University
has "tacitly recognized" it by refer
ring to the center as a resource in
its sexual assault policy.
Although Epstein will be going
to law school next year, she said

she has established "extensive
start-up work," which she would
like to see used by her successor.
She pointed out that most uni
versities fund a staff member to
coordinate sexual assault preven
tion efforts. "I think one of the
reasons Stanford hasn't done this
is because they haven't been sued
by a survivor for not having the
resources," she said.
Senior Jenn Pearson, a member
of the Women's Center Collective,

said she hopes the ASSU's initiative
will allow the University to see the
"vitalness" of Epstein's position.
Without a full-time staff coor
dinator like Epstein, survivors
would have to "get past a discour
aging bureaucracy that sends
them from place to place" when
seeking help, Pearson said.
"With Susan's position, we have
someone who is well-trained in
emotional advocacy as well as legal
ramifications," she added, noting

the importance of having a central
source where students can access
other sexual assault resources.
Epstein said she believes there
has been increased discussion on
campus about issues of sexual
assault since the establishment of
her office and the resource center.
"Increasing discourse is one of
the main goals we've begun to
achieve," she said. "Awareness is
important so people will consider
their own attitudes and behavior."
The second goal she would like
to work on is encouraging small
group discussions in order to tar
get different groups, such as ethnic
minorities and graduate students.
Epstein was "most proud" of
the orientation program, "Sex in
the '905," that dealt primarily with
issues of sexual assault on campus.
An account of same-sex sexual
assault presented in the program
raised issues Epstein said she
intends to deal with in the future.
A member of the gay, lesbian
and bisexual community expressed
concerns over homophobic reac
tions to the dramatic presentation
of a male student being assaulted
by his male teaching assistant.
"We still haven't resolved how to
present same-sex assault without
provoking homophobic reactions,"
she said, adding that she has made
an effort to involve the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Cen
ter in the planning of sexual assault
prevention programs.
