## Sex assault info. center scrambles for next year's funding 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Six months after sexual assault
prevention was centralized at
Stanford, advocates are scram
bling for funds to ensure the sur
vival of the Sexual Assault Infor
mation and Resource Center.
Epstein, whose title is "Coordi
nator of Student Sexual Assault
Prevention Education and Refer
ral Resources," recently submitted
an 82-page activity report detailing
her activity during summer and
fall quarters, from interacting
with victims to providing materials
and referrals to fielding requests
for information and programs.
The report was requested by
three administrators, as well as

the ASSU Senate.
Epstein's posi
tion was estab
lished by the sen
ate last spring
when it decided
to fund the pro
gram for one year
out of emergency
reserve funds.
"Since the Uni-

versity was being too slow to act
on the issue, we wanted to give
everyone a kick in the pants,"
ASSU Council of Presidents mem
ber John Overdeck said.
The intention of the one-year
funding project was to start up the
program and then allow the Uni
versity to take the reins and sup
port it financially, said Epstein,

who graduated last year.
But because the office does not
fall specifically under any Univer
sity department or area, no one
knows where continued funds
would — or should — come from.
"It's been a bureaucratic tangle
and we still haven't gotten a
straight answer if the University is
going to pay for it," said Overdeck,
a graduate student.
Although Cowell's Sexual
Assault Response and Recovery
Team will be funded for next year,
Cowell Student Health Center
Director Harvey Weinstein said
he was not sure about the future
of Epstein's position and the
resource center.
Weinstein said he was "not
sure where the funds will come

from in the school," since the Uni
versity does not have the money
to maintain Epstein's office and
the center.
The ASSU cannot afford to sup
port the office for another year
either, Overdeck said, but they are
considering a student fee to cover
the costs.
Epstein said this option is a
"last resort" because with the stu
dent fee, the center will be run by
students instead of a full-time staff
member. She said a student staff
could not accomplish as much as a
full-time coordinator because stu
dents "have a life" and cannot
make the center their top priority.
Epstein added that she is
