# Residents propose self-op at 558 Mayfield
## 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
558 Mayfield may become a self-op if the
Office of Residential Education accepts a propos
al being prepared by a group of 558 residents.
The possible switch-over, as well as poten
tial changes in the dining options offered to
other Row residents, were discussed at a town
meeting last night between students and offi
cials from Res Ed and Housing and Food Ser
vices.
According to Keith Guy, Director of Hous
ing and Food Services, the meeting was called
to solicit student input and examine the vari
ous options available to Food Service.
In addition to food quality, menu flexibility
and cost-effectiveness, students also criticized
a suggestion that Row house residents be

required to clean up for free.
Several participants said the suggestion
might be more acceptable if board charges
were lowered. However, "one of the simple
appeals of (University-operated residences] is
that people don't want to work," said Matthew
Marx, House Manager at 558 Mayfield, one of
six University-operated houses.
Some discussion revolved around food quality.
Ethan Diamond, who eats at 558 Mayfield,
said, "I don't think that people feel the addition
of a cook (who still has to prepare the Universi
ty menu) makes any difference" in quality.
However, Shirley Everett, associate direc
tor of Housing and Food Services, stressed
that while cooks had to use the raw material
supplied by the University, they had the free
dom to decide how to cook it.
But the group still wants to have their

house become a self-op. "We can do it more
cheaply," said Alison Callicoatte, another
member of the group.
Said Previtali, "a self-op would be so much
more beneficial to the residents of this house
(because they could determine the menu and
because of| the open kitchen and the social
environment." Self-op residents are responsi
ble for their own hashing and cleaning.
Board charges in a self-op are normally
lower than for a University-operated resi
dence. However, Everett said, this was
because "they are not paying all their real
costs."
The University is responsible for maintain
ing the kitchen facilities in houses that are
self-ops. The University charges residents
higher room charges to offset these mainte
nance costs.
