Although prevention and education is the
primary focus of the Sexual Assault Infor
mation and Resource Center, coordinator
Susan Epstein has been busy interacting
with sexual assault and rape victims since
her job began last summer.
Twenty-nine victims and their friends
have contacted the center since then, accord
ing to a report published by Epstein, coordi
nator of sexual assault prevention and edu
cation resources.
According to the report, the centers users
fall into the following categories:
• Twenty-two were actual victims, while
six were friends of victims, and one "signifi
cant other" of a victim also used the center.
The victims' statuses included all four under
graduate classes, graduate students, staff

members and friends from other universities;
• Twenty-seven of the victims were
female, and two were male. Of the callers
who were not victims, four were female and
three were male;
• Twenty of the calls involved acquain
tance rape or attempted acquaintance rape,
while no cases of stranger rape were report
ed. Other reported conduct included verbal
and physical harassment, sexual battery,
and incest; and
• Twelve of the victims were referred to
the Cowell Sexual Assault Response and
Recovery Team, 10 to the Stanford Police,
13 to the YWCA or another rape crisis cen
ter. Victims were also referred to the
ombudsperson, private therapists, attor
neys, residence deans, self defense classes
and Counseling and Psychological Services.
Most callers were concerned about what
their own or the victim's options were, and

many victims expressed fear that the perpe
trator would attack them again.
Epstein says many of the interactions
were initiated by students coming in and
asking for information, and eventually con
fiding their own experience.
"They come in at first to check me and the
place out, and when they feel comfortable to
talk about it, we find ways to offer then
resources," she said.
Although statistics show the number of
people who initially or eventually sought
help, Epstein said she thinks many people
choose not to state their true reasons for
coming in to find out about resources.
Many people say they are working on a
project or writing for The Daily when they
request information at the center. "I know a
lot of them really have projects, but I know
that many people don't write for The Daily,"
she said.
