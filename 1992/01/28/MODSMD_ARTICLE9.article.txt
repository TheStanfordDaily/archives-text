# ASSU to revisit campaign laws
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
An election reform bill voted down at the last
ASSU Senate meeting will re-emerge as a main topic
of debate before the senate tonight.
The bill proposes changes to many facets of the
current election process. It expands the Elections
Commissioner's policing functions and abolishes
run-off elections and campaign expenditure limits.
The senate rejected the bill after almost three hours
of vigorous debate two weeks ago.
In the closing minutes of that senate session
undergraduate senator Raphe Beck, who had pro
posed a hotly contested amendment maintaining the
current campaign fund and flier limits, made a suc
cessful motion that the original bill be reconsidered
at tonight's meeting.
Beck, a senior, said he expects the sections of the
bill dealing with expenditure limits to be voted on
separately tonight, so the senate can vote on the
remaining portions.
"I think the 'coolest senator' award will go to whoev

er can divide that bill first," Beck said. While Beck said
he expected more debate on the issue of flier and spend
ing caps, he feels the rest of the bill contained "good and
important changes" and will be less hotly contested.
Senate Chair Kevin Warsh said he also expects more
debate over campaign spending and flier limits, but
added that he believed there was a consensus among
senators that "there ought to be limits of some type."
Another event scheduled for tonight's meeting is
a talk by University President Donald Kennedy.
Kennedy speaks to the senate eveiy quarter in a sort
of "State of the University" address. Warsh said he
expected much of Kennedy's time to be spent on a
question-and-answer period.
One topic Kennedy will almost certainly be grilled
about is the removal of all University funding from
the ASSU over the next two years (see related story,
front page).
"I think the consensus among senators is that
[the cuts are] all right in tough financial times,"
Warsh said. But he added that he believes the Uni
versity "cannot ask the ASSU to still have the same
responsibilities" with reduced funding.
