# SWOPSI, other Innovative Academic Courses to be dropped
## 
### Cecilia Tom Senior staff writer 
Swapping some innovative academic
courses for long-term financial sound
ness, the School of Humanities and Sci
ences has recommended that SWOPSI be
swept out of existence.
The school's finalized budget plan,
released today, calls for eliminating the
Innovative Academic Courses program,
which includes the Stanford Workshops
on Political and Social Issues, Under
graduate Special Courses and the Peters
Seminars, formerly called freshman
sophomore seminars.
Innovative Academic Courses offers
about 18 classes per quarter, which are
taken by about 500 students, said Margo

Horn, the program director. She said she
is disappointed with the decision and
hopes to see the program re-established in
the future.
"We tried very hard to save the pro
gram. It's a tremendous loss to Stanford
undergraduates," Horn said.
Carolyn Lougee, associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences, lamented the loss
but defended the cut. The program "was
very dear to my heart. I was the founder of
it when I was the undergraduate dean."
However, she added, "Because of the
criteria of quality and centrality to the
academic mission of the University, we
had to conclude that it was less central
than courses for students' majors and
requirements."
Cutting the program would contribute

$180,000 toward Humanities and Sci
ences' reduction target of $5,000,000.
"I'd be surprised if it turns out to be a
really cost-effective move," said Mark Kel
man, a law school professor who currently
teaches a Peters Seminar allied "Alterna
tive Concepts of Discrimination."
"Many of the courses have been quite
successful and cover things that are not
well-covered by the main curriculum,"
Kelman added. The seminars are mean
ingful educational experiences for both
students and teachers, he said.
SWOPSI courses were established in
1969 to help students develop the skills
and knowledge to address current politi
cal and social problems through discus
sion and group collaboration. Undergrad
uate Special Courses are designed to pro

vide a setting for teaching new or inter
disciplinary subjects otherwise not avail
able at the University.
Innovative Academic Courses relies on
students for all phases of its planning.
Some SWOPSI classes are taught by stu
dents.
Mary Pratt, a professor of Spanish and
Portuguese, said she disagrees with the
cut because it takes away a forum for stu
dent initiatives.
Tom Wasow, a linguistics and philoso
phy professor currently on sabbatical,
agreed. The program director reported to
him for four years while he was dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
For other cuts, Humanities and Sci
ences recommended reducing non-faculty
teaching, redesigning the curricula for

some departments and reducing faculty
size by five percent through attrition.
To increase income, the school has
proposed the expansion of the master's
programs by 60 students.
Lougee said the school is not going to
mandate increased teaching loads for fac
ulty members. The departments "must
look at their curriculum and remain with
in their teaching resources," she said.
Departments can adjust by increasing
faculty teaching loads or reducing the
size of the curriculum by offering smaller
courses in alternate years, she suggested.
There will not be any cuts in freshman
English as part of the current proposal,
Lougee said.
