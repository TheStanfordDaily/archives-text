# Administrative Resources – and its VP – to be cut
## 
### Cecilia Tom Senior staff writer 
Su Schaffer has recommended cutting her
own office, and she is probably going to get her
wish.
Schaffer's office, that of the vice president
of Administrative Resources, will likely be
eliminated next year, contributing $761,000
toward her area's budget reduction target of
$1.1 million, according to finalized budget pro
posals released today.
Schaffer said she will probably leave Stan
ford by the end of August, after serving three
years as a vice president. Her assistant's posi
tion will also be cut.
Also in the proposals, Housing and Food
Service announced a budget reduction target
of $2.7 million by 1994-5. But starting next
year, it will also embark on a 10-year, $91 mil
lion capital improvement program to refur
bish existing residences and to build a new
200-bed residence hall by 1996, Schaffer said.
Housing and Food Service will borrow
money to make the improvements, Schaffer
said. Room and board rate increases will stay
at 1 percent above inflation or less, she added.

Environmental Health and
Safety has also identified cuts
that would reduce Adminis
trative Resources' budget by
$150,000.
One key provision is a full
cost recovery program for radi
ological waste disposal, which
would save the University
$60,000, said Harvey Chock,
the unit's associate director.

The University used to subsidize such
waste disposal by classifying it as an indirect
research cost. With full-cost recovery,
researchers will have to pay for the service
from grant money as a direct cost.
John Holmes, radiation safety officer for
Environmental Health and Safety, said he
does not believe radiological waste is a major
cost for researchers, compared to supplies.
Holmes added that information on disposal
costs from previous years were sent to all fac
ulty members involved in research. The
Administrative Panel for Radiological Safety
also had reviewed the proposal.
"We're not trying to blindside anyone," he
said.

Tom Mcßride, director of Environmental
Health and Safety, said other vice presidential
offices will probably oversee the areas which
had reported to Schaffer, including health and
safety, as well as Housing and Food Service,
and Procurement.
The fourth unit that had reported to Schaf
fer, Operations Management, will not exist
anymore, Mcßride said. Responsibilities of its
three subdivisions — information systems,
operations management (a strategic planning
group) and the faculty/staff housing office —
will be reassigned or eliminated, he said.
It is unclear where the different units will
be reassigned. Provost "Jim Rosse and I will
be making that decision in conjunction with
the other vice presidents," and that decision
will probably be reached by the end of Febru
ary, Schaffer said.
Ray Bacchetti, vice president for Planning
and Management, said it would make sense
for Environmental Health and Safety to
report to his office, but declined to speculate
further. Mcßride said reporting to that area
would be a "logical fit" and he does not believe
reassignment would influence his unit's
work.
