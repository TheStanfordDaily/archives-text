Bush vows economic revival
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush last night proposed
election-year tax breaks and business incentives to revive Ameri
ca's economy and vowed, "We're going to lift this nation out of
hard times." Bush also announced dramatic cuts in the U.S.
nuclear arsenal.
In his State of the Union speech, the president challenged the
Democrat-controlled Congress to back his economic programs by
March 20 or face a political fight. Invoking Gulf War rhetoric, he
vowed the recession "will not stand."
The centerpiece of his economic plan was a bid to put more
money in peoples' paychecks by lowering tax withholding rates —
even though it would mean smaller refunds a year from now.
Bush said it would pump $25 billion into the economy. It would
increase take-home pay by an average of $300 for more than 90
million wage-earners, the White House said.
Bush also called for a tax credit of up to $5,000 for first-time
homebuyers and tax credits and deductions to help low- and mid
dle-income Americans obtain health insurance. He proposed a sub
stantial boost in tax breaks that businesses can claim for depreciat
ing equipment, and insisted anew on a capital gains tax cut.
Over six years, Bush proposed to cut defense spending by $50
billion and use the savings to finance tax reductions.
