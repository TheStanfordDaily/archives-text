Bush's State of Union
address fails to deliver
effective recovery plan

He began his state of
the Union address by
promising "big things," but
in 51 minutes of speaking Presi
dent Bush offered very little. Bush
announced plans for both the
short term and the long term, but
throughout his speech it was all
too clear he was thinking mainly of
the election-term.
Is the recession a more
formidable foe than Saddam Hus
sein was? Let's hope not, because
Saddam is still in power and Bush
made the same pledge regarding
the nation's economic difficulties
that he made when Saddam invad
ed Kuwait in August 1990.
Throughout the Gulf crisis, Bush
repeatedly vowed, "This will not
stand." Harkening back a year and
45 approval points, Bush twice in
his address last night made the
same promise. He closed his address
saying, "I look at hard times, and I
make this vow: This will not stand."
But the specifics didn't pack the
punch to match the rhetoric.
There were some positive propos
als. Citing a "roll call of honor" —
not only those who fought in Korea,
Vietnam and the Persian Gulf, but
also those who paid the bills, the tax
payers — Bush proudly exclaimed,
"Communism died this year. Ameri
ca won the Cold War." And thanks to
that victory, Bush announced a $50
billion cut in defense spending over
the next five years.
He promised to shut down pro
duction of the B-2 bomber after
the completion of the 20 stealth
fighters now being built, as well as
to stop production on any new
ICBMs, peace-keeping missiles
and advanced cruise missiles. He
also told the nation that he will be
hosting Russian President Boris
Yeltsin this weekend at Camp
David to discuss bilateral arms

reductions to complement the uni
lateral cuts he announced.
To his credit Bush did refer to
recent hate crimes, expressing his
contempt for racist and anti-Semitic
behavior. He also announced contin
ued support for the Head Start pro
gram (without indicating how
much); pledged to pump $76 billion
into research and development this
year; and promised a long-overdue
$4.4 billion increase in unemploy
ment benefits. And of particular
interest to college students, Bush
also challenged Congress to reform
the tax codes so that families can
deduct the interest they pay on stu
dent loams.
But he didn't do enough. Too
much of Bush's plans are based on
tax credits that won't mean a
whole lot for poor people — those
who supposedly stand to gain. For
instance, Bush said the key to
affordable health care is a $3,750
tax credit for low-income families.
But for the impoverished, taxes are
only a small expense and all the tax
credits in the world won't make
quality health care affordable.
Taking advantage of those poli
cies he can implement without leg
islation having to be enacted, Bush
announced the lowering of tax
withholding rates, a move he said
would infuse $25 billion into the
economy this year. Of course, such
a move is really just a loan — by
withholding less now, the govern
ment takes the money out of 1993
and lets people spend it in 1992.
For the centerpiece of an economic
plan, it wasn't too spectacular.
Nor was his call for penalty-free
withdrawals from individual
retirement accounts to cover edu
cation expenses. Much better
would have been a plan that creat
ed a tax exemption for interest
earned on money set aside for
higher education.
Sadly missing from Bush's
address was any mention of abor
tion, homelessness or AIDS.
Bush's efforts to bolster his politi
cal future left little room for com
ment on these controversial social
issues.
