University proposal undermines Freshman English

FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS, in
several articles and an editorial,
The Daily has discussed the propos
al to take writing instruction out of the
hands of lecturers and to assign graduate
students from departments other than
English to teach courses fulfilling the
Freshman English requirement.
We write to thank The Daily for the
coverage and to applaud, in particular,
the forceful statement that such a pro
posal would be "disastrous," a grave
threat to the quality of undergraduate
education at Stanford.
In assuming that anyone who can
write can teach writing, the University's
proposal is not only wrongheaded but
profoundly insulting to those of us who
spend our professional lives studying
and teaching the writing process.
The 14 instructors whose jobs are
jeopardized by this proposal are accom
plished and experienced teachers and
writers. Our program has, in just the last
three years, produced four textbooks; a
literary biography; a host of published
articles and conference presentations
about writing and writing instruction;
innovative instructional software, includ

ing a renowned interactive audio-visual
program by our acting director; and the
Community Service Writing program, an
innovation in experiential education that
has become a model for writing programs
across the country.
Our lecturers are part of a national
community of writing teachers and
scholars, a discipline remarkable for the
energy of its theoretical debate and for
the breadth of its research agenda. More
important, we have from five to 20 years
of individual experience in writing class
rooms.
Only through experience can one
learn to anticipate the challenge a writ
ing assignment will present to a young
writer, to identify the patterns in a
paper that reveal what the writer needs
to work on, to articulate strategies for
short-term revising and long-term devel
opment of skills. It is a mistake to imag
ine that a brief training program can
substitute for this experience.
It is true that English graduate stu
dents teach writing classes — and often
very successfully — but they have the
advantages of mentorship from experi
enced teachers, a relationship between

their own discipline as students of litera
ture and ours as teachers of writing, a
passion for language and sincere motiva
tion stemming from their expectation
that they will teach writing courses
throughout their careers.
A graduate student in history or eco
nomics has no such advantages, particu
larly if he or she displaces the very lec
turers who now serve as master teachers.
Imagine a writing course taught by a
second-year graduate student in, say,
philosophy. The instructor came to
Stanford to study philosophy. She's
probably very smart and a competent
writer herself, but she is likely to have
little interest and no expertise in compo
sition pedagogy. She wants to spend her
years at Stanford taking courses in her
field, not teaching courses outside it; she
wants to read essays by Kant or Husserl,
not by 20 freshmen.
And imagine the course from the
point of view of the students. Before
coming to Stanford, they read the litera
ture about our effort to combine teach
ing with scholarship, about the excel
lence of our faculty; perhaps they have
read about University President Donald

Kennedy's stated commitment to make
teaching "the first among our labors."
Perhaps that's why they came to
Stanford; perhaps they believe that,
when they pay $15,000 in tuition, they
can expect their teachers to be qualified
professionals. They'll be surprised to find
that their instructor has no experience in
teaching writing, no advanced degree at
all and not so much as a B.A. in English.
Their instructor, in other words,
could not land a job teaching writing in
any other college or university in the
state, and would not, in fact, be qualified
to teach writing in high school. If these
students feel that they are being cheat
ed, they are right.
An educated person's mind is judged
by the quality of his or her writing. Even
in the face of a budget crisis as deep as
ours, we must preserve the quality of
programs most essential to our students'
academic success.
We cannot afford to place so crucial a
task as writing instruction in unquali
fied hands.
