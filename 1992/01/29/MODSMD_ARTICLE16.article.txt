# Kennedy should free himself of corporate management rhetoric
## 
### 
During the remainder of his tenure,
University President Donald Kennedy
should try to act as a spokesman for edu
cation in the literal sense and refrain from
delivering flowery though inconsequential
statements, such as: "This provost will in
a sense transport a seed across that tran
sition and plant it on the other side."
He should also refrain from the
issuance of public relations material —
with multiple references to memoranda

of understanding. It would be timely and
appropriate for the outgoing president to
articulate, on the basis of his long expe
rience, what the unchanging goals of
education in a time of rapid change are
and how they can be served.
This can only help the undergraduate
students to avoid overspecialization and
their parents to appreciate that vocational
training does not represent the best or
only way to a successful career afterwards.
The corporate or management style of
our educational administrators probably
makes an unfavorable impression on
those whose vocal and financial support of
schools is required now more than ever.
