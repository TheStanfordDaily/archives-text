						language purist's plea: Greek and Latin just don't mingle well

### 
I am troubled by Hoover fellow Arnold
Beichman's coining of the term "penilecto
my," as quoted in The Daily (Jan. 27). In
that same story, The Daily quotes Beich
man to the effect that "today, radical
groups that claim all sex is rape are figura
tively 'cutting off penises on the premise
that all men are rapists and guilty."
If this is Beichman's meaning, he
would have better chosen "phallectomy"
as the proper term, avoiding the unschol

arly mingling of Latin and Greek roots â€”
the "il" in penil is also troublesome. An
all-Latin equivalent might be "penisec
tion," but the surgical connotations of
"ectomy" seem more appropriate.
In this age of almost daily assaults on
Western culture, one must be especially
vigilant against contamination of our
precious Greek and Latin heritage.
