# Joel Wagonfeld
## Final words of wisdom 
### 
WELL, THIS IS IT, SPORTS fans.
End of the line, folks. That's all
he wrote. Over. Kaputsville.
With a tinge of regret I inform you that
this is my final foray into the jungle of
verbiage upon which the stuff of columns
is made. This is the last time the near-pro
fundity of my meditations and musings
will appear in these sacred pages.
For all you non-English majors out
there: This be my last column.
But, lest you wallow in despair, I hasten
to inform you that my literary career is
nary but started. I plan on riding the wave
of international fame and recognition that
has resulted from my tenure here at the
beloved Daily. After I appear on Geraldo,
I'll finish my commissioned sequel to a
best-seller. (The Daily paid me to stick this
silliness in so that more of you would sub
mit applications to be my successor.)
Honestly, I am writing a book, and in
return for your loyal support during my
columnar career, I here provide a few
never-before-released excerpts from my
upcoming work titled "All I Ever Needed
to Know I Learned at Stanford Universi
ty." (T-Shirts will be available at K-Mart
and other fine apparel stores nation
wide.) Here are some samples:
If you can't afford something you
want, buy it anyway, label it an "indirect
cost"and then talk to Uncle Sam about
creative financing alternatives.
If you want to learn practical skills

that you can apply to the real world, go
someplace else.
People who talk about a lack of dating
and sex are probably telling you more about
their personal experiences (or lack thereof)
than about the true general situation.
If you're under 21 years of age .. .
well, go ahead and drink anyway.
Do unto others whatever the hell you
want, but if they do it to you, call it "dis
crimination."
If you're a white male who's happy
with things the way they are and don't
want to sacrifice anything you've got, hole
yourself up in a penis-shaped think tank
and criticize everything those damned lib
erals do, whether it makes sense or not.
If you can't handle self-scrutiny, just
say what you want and don't listen to
anyone else.
If you want to avoid being labeled
something you're not . . . well, that's
going to happen no matter what you do.
Not everyone is heterosexual, and it's
actually becoming rather trendy to be
anything else.
Everyone needs to believe in some
thing.
Intelligence has little to do with hav
ing blind faith or an open mind.
Appearances can be deceiving. (I came
here because I thought people were laid
back and relaxed.)
Diversity is a good thing, as long as
you don't create conflicts and differences

that wouldn't otherwise exist among
groups of people.
Earthquakes are for real, but they can
also make for great T-Shirt revenues if
you're enterprising.
Lots of people steal from the book
store. (I worked for security.)
People don't remember everything
they read — someone who had read all my
columns asked me if I was The Daily's
"token Mexican columnist," despite the
fact that I mentioned that I am not only
white and Jewish, but also American.
Another loyal fan remarked, upon being
introduced to me in person, "Oh, of course
I know Joel. Everybody knows Joel Stein."
Just because you have shoulders
doesn't mean it will look like you do (in a
small picture such as mine above).
Just about anything can be construed
as offensive and inappropriate by someone.
People actually buy things from The
Gap for infants.
When you're really in a bind and you
don't want anyone to notice, hire a great
football coach, so that you can be the first
college team to go to the Super Bowl.
Hasta la vista, baby. It's been fun.
