# Biddle sends letter attacking Kennedy
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Paul Biddle went on the offen
sive again yesterday, sending a
letter bitterly attacking the Stan
ford administration to James
Gaither, president of the Board of
Trustees.
In the 38-page letter obtained
by The Daily, the controversial
on-campus Navy regulator blast
ed the University's indirect-cost
accounting practices and called
for various actions by the trustees
— including the firing of Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy.
"By its inaction, the Stanford
Board of Trustees appears to me
to uphold the legality of Kennedy
and the University's impropri
eties. In my personal opinion,
Kennedy should be sacked imme
diately and not in August,
because he lacks a leader's most
essential attribute: judgment,"
Biddle wrote.
University officials had little to
say about Biddle's most recent
attacks.
"This is a repackaging of old
accusations by Mr. Biddle, and I will
have no further comments regard

ing them," Gaither said in a state
ment. "We will continue to work
with responsible government agen
cies to achieve a fair resolution of
the real issues regarding reimburse
ment of the costs of research con
ducted in American universities."
Kennedy said that "as far as I
can tell, there is nothing new" in
the letter, and he declined to com
ment further.
The letter was timed to be sent
on the eve of today's indirect-cost
hearing before the House Subcom
mittee on Oversight and Investiga
tions to attract more attention to
the event (see related story).
Biddle may also be using the
letter to generate publicity before
announcing a campaign for the
seat of either Rep. Tom Lantos,
D-San Mateo, or Sen. John Sey
mour, R-Calif.
But Biddle refused to comment
on the letter or its implications,
insisting that it was "just a nor
mal letter to James Gaither."
Rear Adm. William Miller, head
of the Office of Naval Research,
had not yet read the letter yester
day and declined to comment,
according to Navy spokesman Norm
Hanson.
In the letter, Biddle repeated
claims that the University has
overbilled the government by as
much as $480 million during the
1980s, including:
• $200 million in overhead
costs;
• $200 million in staff benefit
charges; and
• $80 million in equipment
transferred to the University.
"Associated with these amounts
are material increments of interest
and penalties that will likely be as
much as the overcharges them
selves, possibly as much as $600
million," Biddle wrote.
University officials have denied
Biddle's allegations and said he
has not offered any documents to
substantiate his charges.
In the letter, Biddle also sug
gests that the University may
face criminal charges.
"In many instances over the
past three years, the controller's

office and the representatives of
the University's Office of General
Counsel have denied direct access
to information relative to the
Government's business," Biddle
wrote. "Representatives of the
controller's office standing in a
doorway and advising federal
auditors to leave behind records
they were reviewing because such
records had not been approved for
provision to the Federal govern
ment may well have ramifications
under the RICO provision of fed
eral law."
RICO laws are federal statues
that have been used to prosecute
white collar criminals for racke
teering and other similar crimes.
The letter to Gaither was
released only days after another
inflammatory letter addressed to
Miller.
In last week's letter, Biddle
requested that he be appointed the
Western Regional Inspector Gener
al for the Office of Naval Research
and given power to audit all of the
Navy's research universities.
Miller apparently did not
respond to the proposal by yester
day — Biddle's deadline for an
answer.
