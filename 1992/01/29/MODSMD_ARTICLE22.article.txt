## Garretts are Brothers in Arms 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Imagine how the brotherly
Biblical brouhaha between
Cain and Abel might have
ended had they worn Nikes and
played at Stanford.
The elder Cain would taunt
upstart Abel that he was short
and couldn't jump. Abel would
respond by dunking over Cain,
but the brothers would expend
their energy executing jump
shots instead of each other.
Just such a fraternal fairy
tale exists at Stanford. Broth
ers Paul and Brian Garrett
spare each other and exert their
aggressiveness on the court.
Working together, the brothers
have made it to the top academ
ically and athletically, making
any Adam and Eve proud.
Paul, a 6-foot-9 senior, is the
starting center for the basket
ball team, while 6-4 Brian is a
freshman middle blocker for
the volleyball team.
If they had athletics back in
the Garden of Eden, the Gar
retts would have been a tough
tandem.
Of course, it is easy to see
how a younger brother might
get jealous, even if he has a
higher vertical leap. Since
Paul's moniker is "Tall," Brian
is often called "Small Paul" in
comparison.
"I'm not really too fond of
it," Brian said. "I set as a goal to
get my own name at Stanford.
It will help having him leave
eventually."
"The down side is living up
to his reputation, being known
as his younger brother instead
of having my own name."
But Brian has profited from
having Paul show him the way.
As he followed Paul around the
playground and later to Stan
ford, he learned from his brother.

"He loves tagging along and
always played with me and my
buddies," Paul said. "When not
enough guys would show up
he'd step in and play. Even
though he was three years
younger, he'd get disappointed
when he didn't perform well."
The Garretts went to differ
ent high schools in Pacific Pal
isades, Calif. — Paul to public
Pacific Palisades, Brian to pri
vate Brentwood — which
diverged their athletic inter
ests.
"Volleyball was just some
thing fun for me to do in the
off-season," said the tall Gar
rett, while Brian played year
round.
Their academic interests
vary as well. Paul is a political
science and history major,
while Brian is undeclared, but
leaning toward engineering.
Off the court, the brothers
talk a few times a week, but
don't do much coaching.
"I haven't seen him as much
as I thought I would," Paul
said. "We're both so busy."
On the court, Paul has
emerged from pine-time obscu
rity to become a prime-time
producer for the basketball
team. Since becoming a starter
mid-season, Garrett has scored
10 points and grabbed 6.8
rebounds per game, including a
career-best 19 point, 12
rebound effort Saturday
against UCLA.
"Things just kind of came
together," said Paul, who red
shirted his freshman year and
has a year of eligibility remain
ing. "I've realized that I'm bet
ter than a lot of these guys and
I just have to go out and do it."
The basketball team (11-3,
3-2 in the Pac-10) travels to
Washington State and Wash
ington this weekend, looking to

Senior Brian Garrett and freshman Paul Garrett have made their marks on Stanford
sports. Paul is the starting center on the basketball team while Brian is a middle block
er on the volleyball squad.
