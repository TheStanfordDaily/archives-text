# A 						Rose by any other name
## would not be as tenacious as Amy Chiminello 
### Gretchen Atwood Editorial staff 
You don't want to face Amy Rose Chiminello
across a tennis net. The freshman from Melrose,
Mass., may be cheerful and bubbly off the court, but
she's sheer determination between the white lines.
"My opponents know I'm not going to quit. My
mind and determination are my strengths,"
Chiminello said. "I just keep fighting until the last
ball is rolling."
Chiminello credits her cousin, Michael Hughes,
for her tenacity. He died in November, after a three
year battle with leukemia.
"He was the most determined person ever. What
ever goals he set, he went after them," she said.
"Knowing what a fighter he was . . . made me realize
I couldn't just sit down and waste away, but live dou
bly, for him."
However, his death had her reeling for months.
"He was my best friend. I was physically and emo
tionally devastated," Chiminello said. After hitting
infrequently during the summer, she took three
months off.
Her resolve and love of tennis brought her back to
the courts. "I went back with full force. But I realize
there is more to life than tennis," she said. "Not a
day goes by that I don't think about him."
Nowadays, though, many of her thoughts are
about the upcoming dual match season, to start
tomorrow against Hawaii at 1:30 p.m.
A total team player, Chiminello's main goal is to
help Stanford win its seventh straight NCAA Cham
pionships. "Every point I win, at any position, helps
the team. Every match is a victory for Stanford."
As a member of the Cardinal, Chiminello already
has some wins under her belt. She blasted through
the Milwaukee Tennis Classic field en route to the
simifinals. She was finally stopped by 1991 NCAA
finalist, California's Lisa Albano.
To adjust from the counterpunching style of
junior tennis to the aggression of the college ranks,
Chiminello played satellite tournaments over the
summer. Satellites are the minor leagues of profes
sional tennis. "They were well worth their while
because I got to play a lot of college players," she
said.
Chiminello is working on stepping up inside the
baseline to attack her groundstrokes. If she hits the
ball earlier she can catch her opponents off guard
because the ball is coming back quicker than they
expect it to, she explained.
With her work ethic and joy of practice, the fresh
man will likely reach her goals. "I love practicing,
not the sweating and stuff, but working for hours on
a shot with the ball machine," Chiminello said.
And the practice format coach Frank Brennan
uses suits her just fine. "The coaching is what I
expected and the practices are much better (than in
the junior ranks). Frank has everything scheduled,
so that's good," Chiminello said. As a junior she
often had to get court3 and schedule practice part
ners. "It's been a big change, a welcome change."
As a junior she chose training with her father,
Frank, over tennis camps like Nick Bolleteri's.
"They take care of you five days a week. That was
never my goal," Chiminello said.
Tennis was not her only pursuit as a youngster.

Freshman Amy Chiminello's greatest weapon on the tennis court is
a never-say-die attitude. She and the rest of the spirited Cardinal
squad open the dual-match season at home tomorrow afternoon
against Hawaii.
She swam, danced and did gym
nastics. But the decision to focus
on tennis was not a difficult one.
"In swimming if you miss the
split, no matter how hard you
worked, that was it," Chiminello
said. "If I'm down in tennis I
still have two hours to figure out
how to come back. You can be
creative — if things aren't work
ing, you can try something else.

That's really what it came down
to."
She picked up the game as her
father did, reading tennis books
with him and watching video
tapes. For the Chiminellos tennis
was a family affair.
Her father was her mentor
and her mother, Ethel, drove
Amy to tournaments. She often
hit with her older sister, Chris
tine, now a senior at Syracuse.
Her younger sister, Laura, is
playing in the 12-and-under cir
cuit. "She just won her first big
match in a tournament this week.

She called me and was all excit
ed," Chiminello beamed.
Obviously close to her family,
Chiminello's decision to come to
Stanford was a difficult one. It
came down to Duke, closer to
home, and here, 3,000 miles
away. Stanford's academic and
athletic excellence won out.
"School was always my first
priority," Chiminello said. "My
parents always emphasized
school before tennis, but togeth
er." It also didn't hurt that
"Stanford is the best tennis
school ever."

man will likely reach her goals. "I love practicing,
not the sweating and stuff, but working for hours on
a shot with the ball machine," Chiminello said.
And the practice format coach Frank Brennan
uses suits her just fine. "The coaching is what I
expected and the practices are much better (than in
the junior ranks). Frank has everything scheduled,
so that's good," Chiminello said. As a junior she
often had to get court3 and schedule practice part
ners. "It's been a big change, a welcome change."
As a junior she chose training with her father,
Frank, over tennis camps like Nick Bolleteri's.
"They take care of you five days a week. That was
never my goal," Chiminello said.
Tennis was not her only pursuit as a youngster.

Freshman Amy Chiminello's greatest weapon on the tennis court is
a never-say-die attitude. She and the rest of the spirited Cardinal
squad open the dual-match season at home tomorrow afternoon
against Hawaii.
She swam, danced and did gym
nastics. But the decision to focus
on tennis was not a difficult one.
"In swimming if you miss the
split, no matter how hard you
worked, that was it," Chiminello
said. "If I'm down in tennis I
still have two hours to figure out
how to come back. You can be
creative — if things aren't work
ing, you can try something else.

That's really what it came down
to."
She picked up the game as her
father did, reading tennis books
with him and watching video
tapes. For the Chiminellos tennis
was a family affair.
Her father was her mentor
and her mother, Ethel, drove
Amy to tournaments. She often
hit with her older sister, Chris
tine, now a senior at Syracuse.
Her younger sister, Laura, is
playing in the 12-and-under cir
cuit. "She just won her first big
match in a tournament this week.

She called me and was all excit
ed," Chiminello beamed.
Obviously close to her family,
Chiminello's decision to come to
Stanford was a difficult one. It
came down to Duke, closer to
home, and here, 3,000 miles
away. Stanford's academic and
athletic excellence won out.
"School was always my first
priority," Chiminello said. "My
parents always emphasized
school before tennis, but togeth
er." It also didn't hurt that
"Stanford is the best tennis
school ever."
You don't want to face Amy Rose Chiminello
across a tennis net. The freshman from Melrose,
Mass., may be cheerful and bubbly off the court, but
she's sheer determination between the white lines.
"My opponents know I'm not going to quit. My
mind and determination are my strengths,"
Chiminello said. "I just keep fighting until the last
ball is rolling."
Chiminello credits her cousin, Michael Hughes,
for her tenacity. He died in November, after a three
year battle with leukemia.
"He was the most determined person ever. What
ever goals he set, he went after them," she said.
"Knowing what a fighter he was . . . made me realize
I couldn't just sit down and waste away, but live dou
bly, for him."
However, his death had her reeling for months.
"He was my best friend. I was physically and emo
tionally devastated," Chiminello said. After hitting
infrequently during the summer, she took three
months off.
Her resolve and love of tennis brought her back to
the courts. "I went back with full force. But I realize
there is more to life than tennis," she said. "Not a
day goes by that I don't think about him."
Nowadays, though, many of her thoughts are
about the upcoming dual match season, to start
tomorrow against Hawaii at 1:30 p.m.
A total team player, Chiminello's main goal is to
help Stanford win its seventh straight NCAA Cham
pionships. "Every point I win, at any position, helps
the team. Every match is a victory for Stanford."
As a member of the Cardinal, Chiminello already
has some wins under her belt. She blasted through
the Milwaukee Tennis Classic field en route to the
simifinals. She was finally stopped by 1991 NCAA
finalist, California's Lisa Albano.
To adjust from the counterpunching style of
junior tennis to the aggression of the college ranks,
Chiminello played satellite tournaments over the
summer. Satellites are the minor leagues of profes
sional tennis. "They were well worth their while
because I got to play a lot of college players," she
said.
Chiminello is working on stepping up inside the
baseline to attack her groundstrokes. If she hits the
ball earlier she can catch her opponents off guard
because the ball is coming back quicker than they
expect it to, she explained.
With her work ethic and joy of practice, the fresh
man will likely reach her goals. "I love practicing,
not the sweating and stuff, but working for hours on
a shot with the ball machine," Chiminello said.
