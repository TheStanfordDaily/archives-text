### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
The once nebulous Cardinal football coaching
staff picture became a bit clearer yesterday as Bill
Walsh announced the appointments of former
49ers Tom Holmoe, Keena Turner and Mike Wil
son.
All three played under Walsh in San Francisco
and were members of his three Super Bowl cham
pionship teams. Turner will coach the linebackers
along with returning coach Dave Tipton. Wilson
will assume the job of wide receiver/tight end
coach and Holmoe will direct the defensive sec
ondary.
"Keena, Mike, and Tom all bring a wealth of
knowledge, energy and enthusiasm to Stanford. I
feel fortunate to have them on my staff," Walsh
said.
The three ex-49ers bring the number of named
Walsh assistants to six. Former San Jose St. coach
Terry Shea was introduced with Walsh as his assis
tant head coach and offensive coordinator.
Only Tipton and offensive line coach Scott
Schuhmann will return from Denny Green's
staff.
Walsh still has three positions left to fill, includ
ing a replacement for Green's defensive coordina
tor Willie Shaw.
All three of the new coaches expressed excite
ment at the opportunity to work under Walsh. "I
feel this is an honor and privilege to be back with
Bill . . . and to follow Denny Green and the great
job he did. I think the players here feel the job is
only half done and I'm excited to be a part of it,"
Turner said.
Also, on Monday the ripple effect of Walsh's
arrival on the Farm manifested itself in a bid to the
Disneyland Pigskin Classic.
Walsh will make his debut against Texas A&M
in the 1992 NCAA season opener, which will be
played August 26 in Anaheim Stadium.
The Aggies are considered prime contenders for
the 1992 national championship. They will return
all but two starters from a team that finished last
season 10-2 and ranked No. 12.
Texas A&M put together a nine game winning
streak and claimed the 1991 Southwest Conference
championship.
The Aggies ended their year with a 10-2 loss
to Florida State in the New Year's Day Cotton Bowl.
