# Card can dispel Myth
## 
### 
Last Saturday night The Myth once
again reared its ugly head. Still
sweating from probably the most
intense game his team had played all sea
son, Stanford basketball star Adam
Keefe was forced to sit and listen to a
stock media question that always seems
more barb than inquiry.

How come, asked some member of our
fine local press, Stanford is always able
to compete, but never seems to win the big
games ?
"I'm getting a little tired of hearing
that same old myth," said Keefe, his con
tempt for the subject manifesting itself
in a scowling glare. "I've done my best
since I got here to dispel it and I'm still
trying."
As hard as he and his fellow Cardinal
athletes might try, The Myth is alive and
well. It does not matter that Stanford has
won big games, as 1988's Miracle in
Maples over then No. 1 Arizona and last
year's post-season run to the NIT title
can attest. They, like their football
friends before, have a reputation in the

press and population at large for not
coming through when it matters most.
Yet one has to wonder why? Stanford
has beaten UCLA two years running
down in L.A., and two years ago they beat
NCAA-bound Cal en route to the champi
onship game of the Pac-10's final post
season tournament. The Cardinal has
won some very important games over the
years, but still The Myth endures.
This fable exists because Stanford is
in a unique situation. As a leading
research university, it has developed the
reputation as one of the country's top
schools. The multitude of faculty and
student awards that have been bestowed
on Stanford since its inception 100 years
ago put it on par with some older ivy cov
ered institutions. But unlike those East
Coast dinosaurs, Stanford has a great
athletic department as well. We don't
need Harvard's one NCAA hockey title,
or Princeton's annual best-of-the-worst
conference's automatic NCAA basketball
bid to bolster our self worth. We have 50
national team championships and 227
individual championships to our credit.
When you say "student-athlete" at Stan
ford, you know you are getting the best of
both.
But the problem is that as good as we
are, the nation does not consider us an
athletic "powerhouse." If you go to a
sporting goods store almost anywhere
outside the bay area you will see USC,


T. C. Hall
Georgetown, Miami and Okla
homa, but Stanford garb will not
be found. For better or for worse,
the national psyche maintains
that it is football and men's bas
ketball, not swimming, tennis or
women's basketball, that makes a
school "cool."
So Stanford is stuck some
where in the middle. The Ivies
will look down on us because we
have scholarships and thus are
somehow tainted academically
(what a joke); and the media
won't give us all we are athletical
ly due because we haven't been to
a New Year's Day bowl game in
two decades and our hoops team
hasn't gotten past the first round

of the NCAAs since we won it all
way back in '42.
The Myth lives. People like the
fact that we are a great school
that can compete with the big
boys, but if we won all the time
that might be too much. It would
be like the rich kid who had it
allâ€”looks, brains and great coor
dination to boot. The media likes
us right where we are, and has
created a nice reputation that is
not entirely true, but fits just
enough to survive.
Which brings us back to Keefe
and his teammates. The problem
with The Myth is that it has
become such a part of the region
al mind-set that even if you doubt
its truth, it lingers in the subcon
science just enough to have an
impact. It's tough to shake.
To that effect I issue a public
challenge to the 1991-92 Stanford

basketball team and all Cardinal
teams that follow. The Myth is
better suited to a bathroom or
garden; it has no place within
Stanford athletics. The best thing
to do is throw your skills up to the
nation like one huge middle fin
ger and play the kind of ball of
which you are capable. For in the
end it all comes down to how you
perform. You want The Myth to
die Adam? You get your boys
together and kill it. What the
media says and writes are but
words. Only actions can create
the kind of legend that Stanford
deserves.

Chip Hall is a senior History
major who knows the UCLA game
was no fluke; he just wants to sec
that kind of play against the
Washington schools this week. Go
Cardinal!!
