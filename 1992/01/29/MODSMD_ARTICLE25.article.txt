# Card can dispel Myth
## 
### 
Last Saturday night The Myth once
again reared its ugly head. Still
sweating from probably the most
intense game his team had played all sea
son, Stanford basketball star Adam
Keefe was forced to sit and listen to a
stock media question that always seems
more barb than inquiry.

How come, asked some member of our
fine local press, Stanford is always able
to compete, but never seems to win the big
games ?
"I'm getting a little tired of hearing
that same old myth," said Keefe, his con
tempt for the subject manifesting itself
in a scowling glare. "I've done my best
since I got here to dispel it and I'm still
trying."
As hard as he and his fellow Cardinal
athletes might try, The Myth is alive and
well. It does not matter that Stanford has
won big games, as 1988's Miracle in
Maples over then No. 1 Arizona and last
year's post-season run to the NIT title
can attest. They, like their football
friends before, have a reputation in the

press and population at large for not
coming through when it matters most.
Yet one has to wonder why? Stanford
has beaten UCLA two years running
down in L.A., and two years ago they beat
NCAA-bound Cal en route to the champi
onship game of the Pac-10's final post
season tournament. The Cardinal has
won some very important games over the
years, but still The Myth endures.
This fable exists because Stanford is
in a unique situation. As a leading
research university, it has developed the
reputation as one of the country's top
schools. The multitude of faculty and
student awards that have been bestowed
on Stanford since its inception 100 years
ago put it on par with some older ivy cov
ered institutions. But unlike those East
Coast dinosaurs, Stanford has a great
athletic department as well. We don't
need Harvard's one NCAA hockey title,
or Princeton's annual best-of-the-worst
conference's automatic NCAA basketball
bid to bolster our self worth. We have 50
national team championships and 227
individual championships to our credit.
When you say "student-athlete" at Stan
ford, you know you are getting the best of
both.
But the problem is that as good as we
are, the nation does not consider us an
athletic "powerhouse." If you go to a
sporting goods store almost anywhere
outside the bay area you will see USC,
