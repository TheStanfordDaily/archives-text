The Stanford Men's Ultimate Team
(SMUT) competed Jan. 25-26 at the UC-
Santa Barbara Invitational Tournament.
Two teams competed for Stanford.
Stanford's second team, A Naught,
upset Oberlin to make the quarterfinals,
which it lost to national champion Santa
Cruz. Under the guidance of captains Chad
Walters and Jason Gische, A Naught
showed it will be a contender for regionals
in May.
The A team, known as Team Blood, was
seeded No. 1 in the tournament.
On the first day the squad absconded
with all five games, out-scoring the opposi

On the second day, the Cardinal uproot

team, 13-3 in the quarterfinal.

of the final 13 points to advance to the
final.

first two points, and the Wildcats' novel
defense put them ahead 8-6.

you will, of our offense is the swing, in
which our squirrely little handlers steadily
swing the disc from side to side till a gallant
deep opens up downfield with a cut to or
away from the disc. Arizona anticipated our
swing, and positioned a player to prevent it
in an otherwise man-to-man defense,"
Kevin Shen said.
However, Stanford adapted to the the
defense, and the Arizona team was given a
crash course in the Cardinal rule, as Stan
ford took the next five points. The Blood
maintained the upper hand, and flowed to a
17-13 victory to win the tournament.
The most outstanding aspect of Stan
ford's game was its relentless defense, with
an outrageous 63 blocked throws, or "biffs"
in ultimate jargon, on the weekend.
