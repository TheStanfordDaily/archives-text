### Dave Donohue Staff writer 
The Stanford Men's Ultimate Team
(SMUT) competed Jan. 25-26 at the UC-
Santa Barbara Invitational Tournament.
Two teams competed for Stanford.
Stanford's second team, A Naught,
upset Oberlin to make the quarterfinals,
which it lost to national champion Santa
Cruz. Under the guidance of captains Chad
Walters and Jason Gische, A Naught
showed it will be a contender for regionals
in May.
The A team, known as Team Blood, was
seeded No. 1 in the tournament.
On the first day the squad absconded
with all five games, out-scoring the opposi
tion 65-20.
On the second day, the Cardinal uproot
ed the Potted Plants, a local Santa Barbara
team, 13-3 in the quarterfinal.
In the semifinal game, the Card faced a
pumped Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo team.
For the first time in the tournament,
SMUT found itself behind in the score at 5-
4, but after a fire and brimstone time out
sermon by the silver-tounged orator and
co-captain Jeff Reed, the Blood spurted
past the San Luis Obispo team and took 11

of the final 13 points to advance to the
final.
The championship game pitted Arizona,
having upset national champion Santa
Cruz, against Stanford. The final looked
grim when the Arizona team scored the
first two points, and the Wildcats' novel
defense put them ahead 8-6.
"The foundation, the chicken stock if
you will, of our offense is the swing, in
which our squirrely little handlers steadily
swing the disc from side to side till a gallant
deep opens up downfield with a cut to or
away from the disc. Arizona anticipated our
swing, and positioned a player to prevent it
in an otherwise man-to-man defense,"
Kevin Shen said.
However, Stanford adapted to the the
defense, and the Arizona team was given a
crash course in the Cardinal rule, as Stan
ford took the next five points. The Blood
maintained the upper hand, and flowed to a
17-13 victory to win the tournament.
The most outstanding aspect of Stan
ford's game was its relentless defense, with
an outrageous 63 blocked throws, or "biffs"
in ultimate jargon, on the weekend.
"We had every guy covered like stink on
poop. Not unlike a Stanford man
looking for a date, opposing handlers
were repeatedly denied in their bids

to get open. Every time the disc
went up, we were on it like ugly on a
gorilla Bernie Chen said.
In covering opposing players so
tightly, the Stanford defense pre
vented the swing, and forced the
huck, or long throw. Half of the 43
points scored on Team Blood were

from hucks.
"Every time the other team had
the disc you could tell they were
scared, hoping they could complete
one or two more passes before one
of our biff junkies ate another disc,"
co-captain Allan Padgett said.
Stanford is now 15-1 this season.
