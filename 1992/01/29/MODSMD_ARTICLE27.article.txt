## Bug takes count of ribs, calories The 						Science Bug 
### Melanie Barnett Staff writer 
So God caused the man to fall
into a deep sleep; and while he
was sleeping, God took one of
the man's ribs and closed up the
place with flesh. Then God
made a woman from the rib God
had taken out of the man, and
God brought her to the man.
— Genesis 2:21-22
Q 9 An acquaintance of mine
• says that women have
fewer ribs than men and that
this medical "fact" corroborates
the biblical version of creation. I
have a hunch he's full of it.
Could you set the record
straight ?
A.Whoopie! Another addi
• tion to my list titled "Irri
tating People Who Distort Sci
ence to Fit Their Beliefs." Your
hunch is correct. The norm is 12
pairs of ribs, regardless of sex.
Occasionally, a person is born
with extra ribs. These extra ribs
are smaller than true ribs and
are generally associated with
the neck and lower back regions.
This may seem bizarre to
those of you that faithfully
learned in high-school biology
that each of us has 206 bones. In
the real, post-high-school world,
this number varies from person
to person. Some people develop
small round bones where ten
dons rub. These small bones
help reduce friction.
I know this is not a super
market tabloid, but I can't resist
delving into another aspect of
rib removal. Have you heard
that Cher and Dolly Parton
have shed inches by ditching a
couple of ribs? I don't have diffi
culty believing this — anyone
with at least 20/800 vision
notices there's something
unnatural about these women's
figures. They must have had
more help than Cher's exercise
video provides!
But, this being a science col
umn, I can't very well cite the
National Enquirer. So, I
researched the medical litera
ture, talked to a few profession
als and found no evidence for
such a procedure.
Tell your friend he should take
a logic class, or at the very least
read up on Mendelian genetics.
Ask him if he had a rib removed,
would he expect his children to be
born with one less rib?
Q 9 How is the calorie content
•of various foods deter

mined, and how do we know
how many calories are burned
by a particular exercise ?
A. That food you scarf down
• all day contains a whole
bunch of energy that is mea
sured in calories. Your body
breaks down food in a controlled
and orderly manner that har
nesses about 40 percent of the
available energy. The remaining
energy is dissipated as heat.
This is why car windows fog up
at the drive-in.
A "bomb calorimeter" (a
benign device despite its name)
is used to determine calories in
food. The calorimeter measures
the heat energy produced when
the food is burned to a crisp. But
how does one burn lettuce, ice
cream or beer? The food is first
desiccated into something fit
only for an astronaut.
The same sort of contraption
can be used to measure calories
burned by the human body
(without the "burn-to-a-crisp"
attachment, of course). Re
searchers used to measure heat
loss by sealing people in coffin
size calorimeters. This is fine if
you want to know how many
calories are burned when some
one is kicking, flailing, scream
ing and scratching while inside a
coffin, but is little fun other
wise.
Once researchers discovered
that oxygen consumption is pro
portional to heat loss, people
more readily volunteered for
calorie research. All one does
now is don a mask and jump
around while a researcher feeds
numbers into a fancy formula.
It all boils down to this: Eat a
pint of Carmel Nut Haagen
Dazs, and you'll add four ounces
of fat to your body. But don't
worry — if you engage in four
hours of vigorous sex, you'll
burn those calories off.

pint of Carmel Nut Haagen
Dazs, and you'll add four ounces
of fat to your body. But don't
worry — if you engage in four
hours of vigorous sex, you'll
burn those calories off.
