# A 						new tool for gene therapy?
## Genetically engineered muscle cells deliver proteins well, study shows 
### Joanne Adams Staff writer 
For many years, scientists and
clinicians have strived to develop
genetic tools for the treatment of
certain acquired and inherited
diseases. A recent advance in the
laboratory of Dr. Helen Blau may
have brought them one step clos
er to that goal.
Diseases such as diabetes mel
litus, hemophilia A and pituitary
dwarfism develop due to inade
quate levels of proteins such as
insulin, factor VIII and growth
hormone, respectively. Current
therapeutic approaches for these
diseases involve administering
the missing gene product, or pro
tein, by repeated intravenous
injections. The development of
biological systems that could sta
bly produce and release a missing
protein on a long-term basis
would represent a significant
medical advancement.
A recent study has demon
strated that muscle cells can suc
cessfully be used in mice as vehi
cles to deliver proteins into the
systemic circulation. Dr. Jyotsna
Dhawan, working in Blau's
pharmacology laboratory, has
shown that muscle cells (or
myoblasts) can be genetically
engineered to produce human
growth hormone (hGH). These
modified cells can provide an
effectively endless supply of
hGH to the blood and can sus
tain sufficiently high levels of
protein in the blood.
Morphologically, myoblasts do
not appear to be rigged up to act
as secretory power houses. So,
Dhawan and her colleagues were
surprised to find these cells could
secrete impressive amounts of
hGH in culture as well as in a
mouse for at least three months.
Previous attempts to engineer
such a cell system have been
tried using a variety of cell types,
including liver, skin and bone
marrow cells.
These past attempts, however,
have met with limited success.
Although these systems have
produced detectable amounts of
proteins in the circulation, they
have been at levels insufficient to
be therapeutically beneficial. In
addition, the amount of protein
secreted by these cell systems
has not been sustained over
time.
"Sustained, high levels (of a
recombinant protein) in the cir
culation at therapeutic levels has
not been seen (in previously engi
neered systems)," Blau said.
Dhawan explained that muscle

cells were known to be able to
secrete proteins when cultured
in a dish, but it had never been
shown that they were capable of
doing so when implanted in a liv
ing host.

Muscle cells can be
used In mice to deliv
er proteins into the
systemic circulation.

Myoblasts are normally found
along the muscle fiber. They are
quiescent until they are called
into action for growth, either as
a result of exercise or to replace
damaged tissue. As it turns out,
however, "secretion (of hGH)
does not seem to be linked to
whether the myoblast cells have
actually fused or not. That's
because they are not engineered
to respond to cell cycle changes,"
Dhawan said.
Whether the implanted cells
proliferate, fuse with the fibers
or become quiescent does not sig
nificantly influence their ability
to secrete hGH. This renders the
myoblasts even more attractive
as vehicles for long-term delivery
of desired gene products.
Before future applications of
their findings can be considered
for human beings, two major
issues must be addressed,
according to Blau.
First, their model must be
tested in diseased mice to exam
ine whether the disease can be
corrected by implanting the
genetically engineered cells as
predicted. The researchers would
like to know, for example, if
implanted cells secreting hGH
can correct the short stature
characteristic of a particular
strain of mice.
And second, experiments
must be conducted using cells
obtained directly from the ani
mal rather than from mouse
myoblast cell lines that have
been maintained continuously in
culture. Cultured cells are not
"normal," in the sense that they
have been immortalized to sur
vive in culture and "have lost
some of the social control pre
sent in the body," Dhawan
explained.
The cells have been trans
formed and their growth is
uncontrolled. Implantation of
such cells therefore introduces
the threat of cancerous growth
and tumor formation in the
body.

The technique employed in
Blau's laboratory to introduce
the gene coding for hGH is based
on viral infection. The hGH gene
is inserted into the genome of a
virus, known as a retrovirus,
which is then transmitted to the
myoblasts when the virus infects
these cells. Retroviral infection is
a very effective means of trans
ferring genes, with as much as 70
percent of the cells in culture
taking up the genetic material,
according to Blau.
Such effective transfer means
that primary myoblasts would
only need to be cultured for a
short period of time before re
implantation into the host. This
is a prerequisite for eventual
application of this technology to
human myoblasts, since human
myoblasts have very limited pro
liferative capacity in culture.
Short culturing time also mini
mizes the chances of cells being
transformed, or becoming unlike

what they are in their normal
environment.
According to Dhawan, "Nobody
has been able to transform
human myoblast cells in cul
ture," though scientists have cer
tainly tried. Therefore, there
appears to be no inherent risk of
immortalizing primary myo
blasts taken directly from human
beings for re-implantation as
therapeutic tools. Nonetheless,
studies must be conducted with
primary mouse myoblast cells to
verify that they are as amenable
to genetic engineering manipula
tions as cultured cells.
The amount of hGH produced
in a normal adult male is 400
micrograms per day. Based on
that number, investigators have
deduced the number of implant
ed myoblasts that would be
required to match that level of
hGH production, and predict
that such implantations would
be feasible.
