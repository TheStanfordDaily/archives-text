# Macintosh multimedia finally a reality — thanks to CDs
## 
### Andrew Neuschatz 
For years there has been talk about something called "multimedia,"
but nobody outside computer circles has known exactly what it is.
Now, as multimedia programs for the Macintosh are finally reach
ing the market, the impact of multimedia is becoming clear: Combin
ing text, sound and movies, multimedia is a 3-D, full-speed, high-tech
redefinition of the word "book."
This latest computer revolution is brought to you on compact disc.
CDs hold music as binary data, the kind of information computers
work with. There is no reason that the data has to be music, so now
there are compact discs holding programs, pictures and all kinds of
computer information.
The discs, called Compact Disc Read-Only Memories (CD-ROMs),
are read by special players that hook up to computers. In effect, CD
ROMs are like floppy disks with two important differences. First, the
data can be read but not changed — just as music CDs contain pre
recorded albums and are sold with programs that can't be changed.
And second, CD-ROMs hold a lot of data — enough to fill a stack of
floppy disks five feet high. This combination makes CD-ROMs a great
way to package multimedia programs.
With CD-ROM drives becoming affordable (currently as low as
$450), there is suddenly an exploding market in multimedia docu
ments on CD. These documents are like books in that they tell about
some subject through text and pictures. But unlike a book, they can
also include sounds and film clips to illustrate their ideas.

Multimedia documents can be 'read' in
the order that the reader finds most
interesting.

Another unique feature of CD documents is that they don't have to
fit the straight-line format of books, which have their pages ordered in
a fixed way. Multimedia documents can be "read" in the order that the
reader finds most interesting.
The Voyager Company of Santa Monica has put out brilliant exam
ples of the power of multimedia in their "CD companion" series. Each
program in the series teaches a msyor musical work; they are not so
much programs as a combination of documentaries, textbooks and
musical recordings.
One disc, created by a UCLA music scholar, explores Igor Stravin
sky's "The Rite of Spring." As the program begins, it plays the first
strains of the revolutionary ballet and shows a montage of drawings
and photographs of the composer, then shows a table of contents. By
clicking with the mouse, the user can see pages on Stravinsky's life, the
history of the piece, audio demonstrations of musical terms and more.
No book or record can do that. In fact, only a private orchestra could.
Voyager also puts out "Exotic Japan," an introduction to Japan's
culture and language. This disc's lessons range from art and history to
chopstick use and public transportation, all presented in text and pic
tures. Some are even animated: You can learn how to bow properly
from the bobbing figures on screen. "Exotic Japan" also teaches the
language: Click on any Japanese phrase and hear it spoken.
CMC Fi?Search of Portland puts out a series of low-cost discs that
make use of the huge storage space of CD-ROMs without so much mul
timedia hoopla. They sell the complete works of Shakespeare on one
disc for $29.95. The program for navigating this text works rather like
the Macintosh Finder: Click on the "Plays" folder to bring up a list of
plays, then click on "The Tempest" for a list of scenes and acts.
All of the text can be cut and pasted, so it's easy to print a script or
paste a sonnet into your English paper. It's also possible to search the
entire disc in a few seconds to find out, for example, which characters
say "wherefore art."
CMC also sells a two-disc set of John James Audubon's books on
North American birds and mammals, with his original illustrations
and recorded bird calls. Unfortunately, it's not easy to jump between
the text and picture of an animal.
CMC's disc-searching function is most useful in its "Family Doctor"
disc, a home medical encyclopedia and drug guide. It's easy to quickly
scan the thousands of articles and illustrations for references to, say,
"arthritis" or "birth control," or to get a list of diseases from a descrip
tion of symptoms.
From there you can get information on appropriate drugs and sup
port groups. There's a lot of information, but CMC makes it clear, with

a disclaimer shown at the bottom of every page, that the disc should
not replace a physician.
Time-Warner publishing has jumped on the multimedia bandwagon
with their Warner New Media division. Their first CD-ROM, "Desert
Storm: the War in the Persian Gulf," came out only six weeks after
hostilities ended. The disc includes all war-related articles, photos and
maps from the issues of Time printed during the war.
It also contains clips of important speeches and original reports as
filed, making it an ideal tool for the journalism student. The index
includes relevant documents including U.N. resolutions and a 165-
page excerpt from the Geneva Conventions. All the data on the disc is
read through a click-and-jump tool that maintains perfectly the look of
Time magazine itself, with the same fonts and layout.
For something completely different, Warner New Media's next CD
ROM release is called "Funny." Filmmaker Bran Ferren asked 84 peo
ple, famous comedians and gun shop owners alike, to tell their favorite
jokes. The contents of the movie have been put on CD and can be
played on a Macintosh screen. Watch a joke being told, then click for
"more puns," or even "more blond comedians."
Other CD-ROMs cover great moments in baseball, information on
Canada and Zimbabwe, and the age of Columbus. There are already hun
dreds of titles, but for now the collection is a little ad hoc, still reflecting
the interests of software writers more than the buying public. As CD
ROM drives become more standard, though, more titles will be available.
Now if only they could make computers a little handier, you could
curl up with a good multimedia hyperbook.

ples of the power of multimedia in their "CD companion" series. Each
program in the series teaches a msyor musical work; they are not so
much programs as a combination of documentaries, textbooks and
musical recordings.
One disc, created by a UCLA music scholar, explores Igor Stravin
sky's "The Rite of Spring." As the program begins, it plays the first
strains of the revolutionary ballet and shows a montage of drawings
and photographs of the composer, then shows a table of contents. By
clicking with the mouse, the user can see pages on Stravinsky's life, the
history of the piece, audio demonstrations of musical terms and more.
No book or record can do that. In fact, only a private orchestra could.
Voyager also puts out "Exotic Japan," an introduction to Japan's
culture and language. This disc's lessons range from art and history to
chopstick use and public transportation, all presented in text and pic
tures. Some are even animated: You can learn how to bow properly
from the bobbing figures on screen. "Exotic Japan" also teaches the
language: Click on any Japanese phrase and hear it spoken.
CMC Fi?Search of Portland puts out a series of low-cost discs that
make use of the huge storage space of CD-ROMs without so much mul
timedia hoopla. They sell the complete works of Shakespeare on one
disc for $29.95. The program for navigating this text works rather like
the Macintosh Finder: Click on the "Plays" folder to bring up a list of
plays, then click on "The Tempest" for a list of scenes and acts.
All of the text can be cut and pasted, so it's easy to print a script or
paste a sonnet into your English paper. It's also possible to search the
entire disc in a few seconds to find out, for example, which characters
say "wherefore art."
CMC also sells a two-disc set of John James Audubon's books on
North American birds and mammals, with his original illustrations
and recorded bird calls. Unfortunately, it's not easy to jump between
the text and picture of an animal.
CMC's disc-searching function is most useful in its "Family Doctor"
disc, a home medical encyclopedia and drug guide. It's easy to quickly
scan the thousands of articles and illustrations for references to, say,
"arthritis" or "birth control," or to get a list of diseases from a descrip
tion of symptoms.
From there you can get information on appropriate drugs and sup
port groups. There's a lot of information, but CMC makes it clear, with

Time-Warner publishing has jumped on the multimedia bandwagon
with their Warner New Media division. Their first CD-ROM, "Desert
Storm: the War in the Persian Gulf," came out only six weeks after
hostilities ended. The disc includes all war-related articles, photos and
maps from the issues of Time printed during the war.
It also contains clips of important speeches and original reports as
filed, making it an ideal tool for the journalism student. The index
includes relevant documents including U.N. resolutions and a 165-
page excerpt from the Geneva Conventions. All the data on the disc is
read through a click-and-jump tool that maintains perfectly the look of
Time magazine itself, with the same fonts and layout.
For something completely different, Warner New Media's next CD
ROM release is called "Funny." Filmmaker Bran Ferren asked 84 peo
ple, famous comedians and gun shop owners alike, to tell their favorite
jokes. The contents of the movie have been put on CD and can be
played on a Macintosh screen. Watch a joke being told, then click for
"more puns," or even "more blond comedians."
Other CD-ROMs cover great moments in baseball, information on
Canada and Zimbabwe, and the age of Columbus. There are already hun
dreds of titles, but for now the collection is a little ad hoc, still reflecting
the interests of software writers more than the buying public. As CD
ROM drives become more standard, though, more titles will be available.
Now if only they could make computers a little handier, you could
curl up with a good multimedia hyperbook.

For years there has been talk about something called "multimedia,"
but nobody outside computer circles has known exactly what it is.
Now, as multimedia programs for the Macintosh are finally reach
ing the market, the impact of multimedia is becoming clear: Combin
ing text, sound and movies, multimedia is a 3-D, full-speed, high-tech
redefinition of the word "book."
This latest computer revolution is brought to you on compact disc.
CDs hold music as binary data, the kind of information computers
work with. There is no reason that the data has to be music, so now
there are compact discs holding programs, pictures and all kinds of
computer information.
The discs, called Compact Disc Read-Only Memories (CD-ROMs),
are read by special players that hook up to computers. In effect, CD
ROMs are like floppy disks with two important differences. First, the
data can be read but not changed — just as music CDs contain pre
recorded albums and are sold with programs that can't be changed.
And second, CD-ROMs hold a lot of data — enough to fill a stack of
floppy disks five feet high. This combination makes CD-ROMs a great
way to package multimedia programs.
With CD-ROM drives becoming affordable (currently as low as
$450), there is suddenly an exploding market in multimedia docu
ments on CD. These documents are like books in that they tell about
some subject through text and pictures. But unlike a book, they can
also include sounds and film clips to illustrate their ideas.

Multimedia documents can be 'read' in
the order that the reader finds most
interesting.

Another unique feature of CD documents is that they don't have to
fit the straight-line format of books, which have their pages ordered in
a fixed way. Multimedia documents can be "read" in the order that the
reader finds most interesting.
