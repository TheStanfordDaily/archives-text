# The
						man up in the little booth
## At the Stanford Theater, Phil Krikau makes it all happen 
### Jason Montiel 
Most people watching a movie just look at the
screen. But at the Stanford Theater, if you follow
the soft, dusty beam of light back up to the little win
dow of the projection booth, every once in awhile
you'll see a face peeking out.
Depending on the night, that face might be Phil
Krikau.
"I call myself a freelance projectionist," he said. "I
try to pick up what I can." That includes a couple
nights a week at the Stanford, along with work at
other theaters around the Bay Area.
"It's the kind of job you like if you're a loner,"
said Krikau, who is 35. "You have to enjoy being by
yourself. A lot of contemplating goes on."
On this particular night, Krikau sits up in the
booth tending the projectors and contemplating
Spanish homework for a class he is taking at San
Francisco City College. He studies amid the clicking
hum of one of the giant projectors, getting up off his
stool to switch the film reels every 15 minutes or so.
It's a job that Krikau makes look easy. But there's
a lot behind keeping a film running smoothly.
The reel switch occurs about six times during the
average feature film. In middle of the dim booth,
there are two 35 mm projectors as tall as Krikau,
between which he alternates the reels to keep the

film flowing along in one long stream.
Krikau talks about his work with one eye on the
projector and one eye on a reporter. He's always
checking, checking, checking. His mustache, jeans
and running shoes accent his easy-going manner.
But he is all business when it comes to the mechan
ics of projecting film.
"I'm up here to entertain, not to be entertained,"
he said. Suddenly, a bell rings three times. He has
one minute before he needs to change projectors.
He jumps up and looks through the porthole to
see the screen down below. He's looking for little
white dots on the upper right hand corner of the
screen that will cue him to make the switch.
"If I'm distracted by something, then I'll miss the
change over," Krikau explained. "Then you see the reel
go off the screen, and the funny business happens."
The first white dot appears on the screen and he
flicks a lever to start up the new projector. The new
reel is rolling. A few seconds later, another dot
appears. This time he throws a switch which turns
on the sound and opens the aperture on the new pro
jector, which lets a light beam pass out onto the
screen. The aperture on the old projector closes at
the same moment the new aperture is opened, and
the smooth change has been made.
