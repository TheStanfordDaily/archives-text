# The 						man up in the little booth
## At the Stanford Theater, Phil Krikau makes it all happen 
### Jason Montiel 
Most people watching a movie just look at the
screen. But at the Stanford Theater, if you follow
the soft, dusty beam of light back up to the little win
dow of the projection booth, every once in awhile
you'll see a face peeking out.
Depending on the night, that face might be Phil
Krikau.
"I call myself a freelance projectionist," he said. "I
try to pick up what I can." That includes a couple
nights a week at the Stanford, along with work at
other theaters around the Bay Area.
"It's the kind of job you like if you're a loner,"
said Krikau, who is 35. "You have to enjoy being by
yourself. A lot of contemplating goes on."
On this particular night, Krikau sits up in the
booth tending the projectors and contemplating
Spanish homework for a class he is taking at San
Francisco City College. He studies amid the clicking
hum of one of the giant projectors, getting up off his
stool to switch the film reels every 15 minutes or so.
It's a job that Krikau makes look easy. But there's
a lot behind keeping a film running smoothly.
The reel switch occurs about six times during the
average feature film. In middle of the dim booth,
there are two 35 mm projectors as tall as Krikau,
between which he alternates the reels to keep the

film flowing along in one long stream.
Krikau talks about his work with one eye on the
projector and one eye on a reporter. He's always
checking, checking, checking. His mustache, jeans
and running shoes accent his easy-going manner.
But he is all business when it comes to the mechan
ics of projecting film.
"I'm up here to entertain, not to be entertained,"
he said. Suddenly, a bell rings three times. He has
one minute before he needs to change projectors.
He jumps up and looks through the porthole to
see the screen down below. He's looking for little
white dots on the upper right hand corner of the
screen that will cue him to make the switch.
"If I'm distracted by something, then I'll miss the
change over," Krikau explained. "Then you see the reel
go off the screen, and the funny business happens."
The first white dot appears on the screen and he
flicks a lever to start up the new projector. The new
reel is rolling. A few seconds later, another dot
appears. This time he throws a switch which turns
on the sound and opens the aperture on the new pro
jector, which lets a light beam pass out onto the
screen. The aperture on the old projector closes at
the same moment the new aperture is opened, and
the smooth change has been made.
Krikau has been at this for the
past 10 hours. "Toward the end of
the day, waiting for that cue mark
can take a long time," he said.
The switch is made between
scenes, so no one watching the
movie even notices what is hap
pening upstairs.
Once Krikau makes sure the
new projector is working fine, he
walks over to the old projector
and opens up the film magazine
doors and the projector door.
There's an empty reel on top, a
full one in the bottom magazine.
He takes the full reel out and
walks it over to a rewinder at the
back of the booth. There he also
opens up the film bin and pulls
out a new reel. This is the next
part of the film.
After placing the fresh reel into
the top magazine, Krikau moves to
the rear of the projector and opens
up the lamphouse. This is where
light is generated and focused onto
the film as it passes through the
projector. He makes an adjust
ment so the carbon arc will contin
ue to burn brightly when this pro
jector is turned back on.
With a new reel of film in place,
and the carbon adjusted, this pro
jector will be ready when the time
comes for another switch. So the
cycle continues, from opening
curtain to the final credits.
"It's not boring to me," Krikau
said as he sits down again. "It gets
kind of repetitious, but there's a
kind of system to it. You just go
along with it."
Krikau leans forward a little
on his stool when he talks about
the profession he has been in for
the past 15 years. "Some projec
tionists live out the fantasy of the
film," he said. "I'm more into pre
senting the film to people."
As Krikau grew up in Racine,
Wisconsin, he spent a lot of time
in old theaters, always turning
around during movies to look up
at the portholes and the ornate
designs on the walls and ceiling.
"You can dream a little bit.
That's where the romance comes
in,"he said. "I did that as a kid,
always spacing out and looking at
something in the theater."
Krikau came out to the Bay
Area 10 years ago in search of good
weather, liberal attitudes and a
job. "I was at a point in my life

where I needed a change," he said.
Soon after arriving, he met his
wife, who was then a cashier at a
theater where he was a projection
ist. He now lives in San Francisco,
working also as a fill-in projection
ist at the Castro Theater and
training to work at the Paramount
Theater in Oakland.
Krikau gets up from time to
time to check the projector. He
points to a cabinet on the wall
where aperture plates and various
projector lenses are kept. The other
projectionist has left a rubber hand
in the cabinet. Krikau pulls it out,
wiggles it around, and smiles.
"Projectionists are known as
practical jokers," he said.
Krikau has to do something to
pass the time, since it's tough to
watch a film though the portholes.
Along with the noise of the projec
tor and the constant preparation
for the next reel, he has little time
to follow story lines. So in the few
spare minutes he finds, Krikau
just studies his Spanish verbs.
The job in the booth gives him
plenty of time to think. And he has
come to his own conclusions about
the way new films are presented in
large, multi-screen cinemas.
Krikau has plenty to say about
what he calls the "McDonald's
mentality" of shopping mall the
aters that favor automation over
a hands-on approach. In new the
aters, films are run on giant plat
ters containing a whole movie,
ending the need to have a projec
tionist in the booth.
"Exhibitors and theater own
ers don't want to pay a man to sit
up here," Krikau says, looking
around the booth.
The exception, Krikau said, is
found in old theaters like the
Stanford that have real projec
tionists. "This is how film should
be run,"he said. "It brings a cer
tain amount of showmanship,
since you control the lights."
"That's why I appreciate work
ing here," Krikau added.
The last reel of the evening is
just about done. Krikau is up at
the porthole watching Gary Coop
er kiss Barbara Stanwyck in the
last scene. The film ends, but he
doesn't turn on the lights just yet.
"When you bring up the lights
during credits it washes them
out," he said, as names scrolled
up the screen. "It's not respectful
to those who made the film."
For Krikau, this is how film is
presented â€” right down to the
last frame.

But he is all business when it comes to the mechan
ics of projecting film.
"I'm up here to entertain, not to be entertained,"
he said. Suddenly, a bell rings three times. He has
one minute before he needs to change projectors.
He jumps up and looks through the porthole to
see the screen down below. He's looking for little
white dots on the upper right hand corner of the
screen that will cue him to make the switch.
"If I'm distracted by something, then I'll miss the
change over," Krikau explained. "Then you see the reel
go off the screen, and the funny business happens."
The first white dot appears on the screen and he
flicks a lever to start up the new projector. The new
reel is rolling. A few seconds later, another dot
appears. This time he throws a switch which turns
on the sound and opens the aperture on the new pro
jector, which lets a light beam pass out onto the
screen. The aperture on the old projector closes at
the same moment the new aperture is opened, and
the smooth change has been made.
Krikau has been at this for the
past 10 hours. "Toward the end of
the day, waiting for that cue mark
can take a long time," he said.
The switch is made between
scenes, so no one watching the
movie even notices what is hap
pening upstairs.
Once Krikau makes sure the
new projector is working fine, he
walks over to the old projector
and opens up the film magazine
doors and the projector door.
There's an empty reel on top, a
full one in the bottom magazine.
He takes the full reel out and
walks it over to a rewinder at the
back of the booth. There he also
opens up the film bin and pulls
out a new reel. This is the next
part of the film.
After placing the fresh reel into
the top magazine, Krikau moves to
the rear of the projector and opens
up the lamphouse. This is where
light is generated and focused onto
the film as it passes through the
projector. He makes an adjust
ment so the carbon arc will contin
ue to burn brightly when this pro
jector is turned back on.
With a new reel of film in place,
and the carbon adjusted, this pro
jector will be ready when the time
comes for another switch. So the
cycle continues, from opening
curtain to the final credits.
"It's not boring to me," Krikau
said as he sits down again. "It gets
kind of repetitious, but there's a
kind of system to it. You just go
along with it."
Krikau leans forward a little
on his stool when he talks about
the profession he has been in for
the past 15 years. "Some projec
tionists live out the fantasy of the
film," he said. "I'm more into pre
senting the film to people."
As Krikau grew up in Racine,
Wisconsin, he spent a lot of time
in old theaters, always turning
around during movies to look up
at the portholes and the ornate
designs on the walls and ceiling.
"You can dream a little bit.
That's where the romance comes
in,"he said. "I did that as a kid,
always spacing out and looking at
something in the theater."
Krikau came out to the Bay
Area 10 years ago in search of good
weather, liberal attitudes and a
job. "I was at a point in my life

where I needed a change," he said.
Soon after arriving, he met his
wife, who was then a cashier at a
theater where he was a projection
ist. He now lives in San Francisco,
working also as a fill-in projection
ist at the Castro Theater and
training to work at the Paramount
Theater in Oakland.
Krikau gets up from time to
time to check the projector. He
points to a cabinet on the wall
where aperture plates and various
projector lenses are kept. The other
projectionist has left a rubber hand
in the cabinet. Krikau pulls it out,
wiggles it around, and smiles.
"Projectionists are known as
practical jokers," he said.
Krikau has to do something to
pass the time, since it's tough to
watch a film though the portholes.
Along with the noise of the projec
tor and the constant preparation
for the next reel, he has little time
to follow story lines. So in the few
spare minutes he finds, Krikau
just studies his Spanish verbs.
The job in the booth gives him
plenty of time to think. And he has
come to his own conclusions about
the way new films are presented in
large, multi-screen cinemas.
Krikau has plenty to say about
what he calls the "McDonald's
mentality" of shopping mall the
aters that favor automation over
a hands-on approach. In new the
aters, films are run on giant plat
ters containing a whole movie,
ending the need to have a projec
tionist in the booth.
"Exhibitors and theater own
ers don't want to pay a man to sit
up here," Krikau says, looking
around the booth.
The exception, Krikau said, is
found in old theaters like the
Stanford that have real projec
tionists. "This is how film should
be run,"he said. "It brings a cer
tain amount of showmanship,
since you control the lights."
"That's why I appreciate work
ing here," Krikau added.
The last reel of the evening is
just about done. Krikau is up at
the porthole watching Gary Coop
er kiss Barbara Stanwyck in the
last scene. The film ends, but he
doesn't turn on the lights just yet.
"When you bring up the lights
during credits it washes them
out," he said, as names scrolled
up the screen. "It's not respectful
to those who made the film."
For Krikau, this is how film is
presented â€” right down to the
last frame.
Most people watching a movie just look at the
screen. But at the Stanford Theater, if you follow
the soft, dusty beam of light back up to the little win
dow of the projection booth, every once in awhile
you'll see a face peeking out.
Depending on the night, that face might be Phil
Krikau.
"I call myself a freelance projectionist," he said. "I
try to pick up what I can." That includes a couple
nights a week at the Stanford, along with work at
other theaters around the Bay Area.
"It's the kind of job you like if you're a loner,"
said Krikau, who is 35. "You have to enjoy being by
yourself. A lot of contemplating goes on."
On this particular night, Krikau sits up in the
booth tending the projectors and contemplating
Spanish homework for a class he is taking at San
Francisco City College. He studies amid the clicking
hum of one of the giant projectors, getting up off his
stool to switch the film reels every 15 minutes or so.
It's a job that Krikau makes look easy. But there's
a lot behind keeping a film running smoothly.
The reel switch occurs about six times during the
average feature film. In middle of the dim booth,
there are two 35 mm projectors as tall as Krikau,
between which he alternates the reels to keep the

film flowing along in one long stream.
Krikau talks about his work with one eye on the
projector and one eye on a reporter. He's always
checking, checking, checking. His mustache, jeans
and running shoes accent his easy-going manner.
But he is all business when it comes to the mechan
ics of projecting film.
