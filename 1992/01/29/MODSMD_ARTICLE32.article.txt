# Costs hearing held today
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The indirect-cost controver
sy will again take center stage in
Washington, D.C., today, as the
House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations holds a
hearing to update the situation.
Expected to testify are rep
resentatives from the Office of
Naval Research, Defense Con
tract Audit Agency, General
Accounting Office and Depart
ment of Health and Human
Services.
No officials from any univer
sities have been asked to speak
at the hearing. However, both
Larry Horton, associate vice
president for public affairs, and
Paul Biddle, the on-campus
Navy regulator, will attend.
At a hearing last March,
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
attacked Stanford's indirect
cost recovery practices.
Although subsequent reve
lations have shown that many

universities nationwide sub
mitted inappropriate charges,
the subcommittee will certain
ly not ignore Stanford.
Likely to be examined are
Biddle's allegations that Stan
ford overbilled the government
by $480 million during the
1980s as well as a recent
Defense Contract Audit Agency
study that disregarded about
100 cost agreements and con
cluded the University owes
$230 million for the period of
fiscal years 1981 to 1988.
But, Stanford will not be the
only university to face the firing
line of Dingell's subcommittee.
A recent study alleges that
MIT overbilled the government
$75 million since 1986, and
audits conducted by the
Inspector General of Health
and Human Services have dis
closed a wide array of inappro
priate charges, including a trip
to the Grand Cayman Islands
by the University of Pitts
burgh's president's wife.
