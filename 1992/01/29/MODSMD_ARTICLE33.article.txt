# Wreath of ribbons marks sexual assaults
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
A wire wreath was hung in White Plaza yes
terday as a reminder of the thousands of
women every year who are sexually assaulted.
Anyone who has been sexually assaulted, or
who knows someone who has, can tie a yellow
ribbon on the wreath, according to organizers
from the Stanford Rape Education Project and
the Coalition Against Sexual Assault.
The wreath is intended to raise awareness
of sexual assault and "to demonstrate how
many people on campus are affected by the
issue of rape," said Susan Epstein, Stanford's
coordinator of sexual assault prevention edu
cation and referral resources.
REP member Barbara Johnson said the
hanging of the wreath, which was inspired by
a similar project at Yale University, had a
great impact 011 campus when it debuted in
November 1990.
"We didn't expect to get as big a reaction as
we did," Johnson said, adding that people
were "shocked" by the wreath. "They didn't
know they knew so many people who had been
sexually assaulted."
In a 1988 survey, a REP survey found that
37 percent of graduate women and 29 percent
of undergraduate women said they had been

coerced into sexual activity, while 10 percent
of graduate men and 16 percent of undergrad
uate men reported the same.
Last year's wreath, a wire skeleton four
feet in diameter, "was dripping with yellow
ribbons," recalled REP and coalition member
Kathy Zonana.
"By the end of the week, you couldn't see
the chicken wire," she said.
Zonana said the wreath "was beautiful in a
sad way." By the end of the week, she said
REP members "were horrified that it was so
pretty and so full."
As with last year, the wreath is on display
day and night with a box of ribbons next to it,
so people can hang a ribbon whenever they
feel most comfortable. During the day, REP
and coalition members will be on hand to
answer any questions.
REP member Kate Knepper said that tying
a ribbon on the wreath "is empowering" for
survivors of sexual assault.
"It gives them a chance to help educate
other people," she said, adding that, "It
doesn't take a lot of effort to tie the ribbon on,
but with enough people doing it, it delivers a
really powerful message."
Part of the wreath's power is derived from its
public display, according to Zonana. In contrast
to dorm programs, which typically reach only a

small number of students, she said, "When you
do something in White Plaza, you have the
potential to reach the entire campus, including
some audiences we don't usually reach," such as
graduate students, faculty and staff.
Junior Amanda Hashfield said she was
deeply affected by both hanging a ribbon and
seeing the number of other ribbons on the
wreath last year.
The experience "made a large impact on
me," she said, adding that it was also the cata
lyst for her active involvement with REP.
REP members said the wreath is not meant
to incite controversy, but is merely intended to
raise people's awareness of the problem of sex
ual assault. "It's important for all the people
who aren't aware of the issue to see how many
people it affects on campus," Knepper said.
Some REP members suggested sponsoring a
different awareness project this year, since a
second appearance of the wreath might lessen
its impact on members of the Stanford commu
nity. But Hashfield said REP decided to repeat
the project because several members wanted to
start a tradition and because "at least one
fourth of the campus hasn't seen it before."
Zonana said REP borrowed the idea of
using yellow ribbons from times the country
has been at war, when yellow ribbons were
displayed to show support for soldiers.
