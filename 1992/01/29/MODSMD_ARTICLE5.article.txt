# Budget process comes to a head
## Undergraduate tuition to rise substantially 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Stanford will raise undergradu
ate tuition to help cope with bud
get deficits, Provost James Rosse
said yesterday.
Rosse said officials still have to
study how much to increase costs,
but added that it will be substan
tially more than the inflation-plus
one-percent increase that Univer
sity officials have considered a ceil
ing for the past two years.
"It is now becoming fairly obvi
ous that we're going to have to
raise tuition more ... or take
more substantial program cuts,"
Rosse said.
The increase will come on top of
a change in the mix between tuition
and room-and-board charges
already planned by University offi
cials.
Rosse and University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy will pro
pose the tuition increase to the
Board of Trustees at its meeting
Feb. 10 and 11.
Rosse and Budget Director
Tim Warner refused to forecast
how large the increase might be,
but said an estimate will be avail
able within the next few weeks.
"Right now we're still studying
it," Rosse said.
While many private universi
ties have continued to increase
tuition by 5 to 10 percent during
the past two years, Stanford offi
cials decided in 1990 to raise
tuition by only 1 percent more
than the level of inflation.
At the time, Kennedy expressed
the hope that Stanford would be a
leader in controlling the cost of
education.
"The problem is that there
haven't been many followers,"

Rosse said yesterday. Other uni
versities "are continuing to raise
tuition and put more money into
programs," he said.
"The fear is that we will not be
able to afford the types of pro
grams that make us competitive"
in attracting top undergraduates,
Rosse said.
If the increase is not approved,
Rosse said, the University will
have to make even deeper budget
cuts than it is considering now.
The $43 million deficit "isn't fully
made up" by the current propos
als, he said.
Dean of Admissions James
Montoya said that rising charges
could make Stanford less compet
itive with public institutions,
which charge much less.
"In most of my presentations
(to high school students and par
ents), I am asked why a Stanford
education is as costly as it is,"
Montoya said.
"I am concerned primarily
about (recruiting) students com
ing from states with strong state
supported institutions such as
California, Michigan and Texas,"
Montoya said. Such students have

a high-quality educational alter
native at a lower cost, he said.
The budget for financial aid
grants will grow as tuition
charges increase, Rosse said. Stu
dents already on financial aid can
expect their aid packages to
reflect the higher cost, he added.
The Financial Aids Office has
already been asked to cut grants
by $2.5 million, mainly by tighten
ing up guidelines governing aid to
students with divorced parents

and by requiring students to pur
sue state and federal scholar
ships.
Many observers of higher edu
cation have expressed concern
that higher charges will shut out
students from families that do
not qualify for financial aid.
"We worry about that," Rosse

said. "There is the fear that we
are freezing out the people in the
middle class who are on the mar
gin" of being able to afford a
Stanford education, he said.
"We will monitor our admis
sions to see if that's becoming a
serious problem," he said.
Stanford's more modest tuition
increases during the past two
years make it the most expensive
university in 1991-92, according
to statistics from the Consortium
on Financing Higher Education.
