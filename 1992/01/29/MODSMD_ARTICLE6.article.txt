# Summaries of proposed cuts are released
## 
### Howard Libit Steve McCarroll Senior staff writers 
Concluding months of self
study by Stanford's schools and
administrative units, University
officials released "executive sum
maries" of each area's budget
proposals today.
Together, they are a blueprint
for a smaller, more focused Stan
ford — one that the University's
highest administrators will contin
ue to refine in the months to come.
Many of the summaries are
somewhat vague and do not iden
tify specific cuts. A few, like Over
seas Studies, detail exact plans
for reduction.
"We are asking that more
details be made available for some
units," Provost James Rosse said.
"The problem with too much
detail is that in some cases it gets
down to individual persons, and
that is not a level of detail that
will enlighten discussion."
Most of the schools have pro
posed to achieve their reductions
through a combination of revenue
enhancements and budget cuts.
The revenue enhancements
include tuition increases for gradu
ate students, more concentrated
fund raising and admission of more
master's students to several schools.
Humanities and Sciences, how
ever, will achieve almost all of its
target through cuts: eliminating a
quarter of all lecturers, reducing
faculty size by 5 percent and offer
ing fewer courses. More specific
decisions will be made soon.
Decision-makers were encour
aged in October to make selective
cuts, isolating specific programs
for closure rather than making
marginal reductions across the
board.
Most of them did so, and the
result could be the disappearance
of institutions students had taken
for granted. The Stanford campus
in Salamanca will likely cease to
exist. Meyer will no longer be a
traditional undergraduate library.
Athletics officials have proposed
closing Encina Gym in 1993.
Some of the reductions, howev
er, are fundamentally marginal.
"We won't do edging on University
lawns as often," said Rich Kurof
sky, a director of public affairs.
Some buildings will be kept
coolerin winter, according to a
proposal by Facilities, Planning
and Management. Others will see
long-needed repairs deferred for
years to come.
Most units struggled to meet
their targets, but one administra
tive area actually found more cuts
than required. Barbara Butter
field, vice president for Human
Resources, submitted a proposal
outlining reductions of $514,000.
The unit's target was $400,000.
Questions remain
In Student Resources, the
questions surrounding Cowell
Student Health Center remained
unanswered.
When the proposed cuts were
revealed this month, students
protested a possible $14 quarterly
student fee for Cowell services.
The summary says that either
an $8 fee will be implemented or
students will be charged for "spe
cialty referral services" — raising
health insurance costs.
"We still need to grapple with
student health," said Sally

Mahoney, acting vice president
for Student Resources. "It is the
key and still unresolved issue."
Council of Presidents member
Beth Morgan said any fee should
be "needs-tested and made part of
tuition" so that financial aid and
tuition remission cover the costs.
Rosse acknowledged that sev
eral issues will require further
study, but added that today's pro
posals were never intended to
mark the end of the budget-reduc
tion process.
With today's announcement,
that process retreats back into the
semi-secrecy of the Cabinet Com
mittee on Budget and Strategic
Planning.
Where things go now
The cabinet committee — the
group that set the reduction tar
gets back in October — will now
examine the proposals and pre
pare a final budget for the Board
of Trustees' approval in April.
Members of the cabinet com
mittee, in conjunction with the
Faculty Senate Committee on
Education and Scholarship at
Stanford, are forming six task
forces to study the proposals

along cross-cutting themes —
undergraduate education, demo
graphic and intellectual diversity,
arts, graduate education, aca
demic support services and
research.
"The task forces will look
across all of the plans and ensure
that we are sustaining our capac
ity for strong undergraduate and
graduate teaching programs . . .
and strong research and scholarly
programs," Rosse said. "I am par
ticularly concerned about having
an institution that is manageable
with the many changes in
staffing and organization.
"We have to make sure that we
can still put personnel and policy
decisions together," he added.
The task force reports will be
presented at a cabinet retreat Feb.
18 and 19. The cabinet will put
together the final budget for April.
The final budget will be pre
pared as a large book, complete
with administrators' reflections
on the future of their schools and
units. Officials compared the
prospective report to the 1989
landmark study of the University
Committee on Minority Issues.
As the budget process returns
to the cabinet, Rosse said that the
period for discussion of specific
cuts is, for the most part, over.
"We have had broad consulta
tion, and I anticipate that most of
it will have taken place," Rosse
said. "There will be opportunities
for other discussion as we go for
ward in the Faculty Senate and
elsewhere, but we have to walk a
really careful line.
"Clearly the community has to
have an opportunity to be heard
on the relevant issues. On the
other hand, if an issue has been
widely discussed already and an
appropriate decision-making pro
cess has taken place, we do not
want [the decision] to be pushed
to the person" who gives in to the
pressure, Rosse said.

Central initiatives revisited
With the completion of the pro
posals from individual schools
and administrative areas, atten
tion will also be shifted back to
the central proposals the cabinet
suggested in October.
The central initiatives are the
cross-cutting proposals that affect
the entire University, such as the
size of the undergraduate student
body and campus construction.
For example, administrators
will continue to develop a "tax" on
restricted gifts.
. When the University receives a
restricted gift, the funds must be
used as directed by the donor.
Under a restricted-gift "tax," a por
tion of such gifls would go to cover
the overhead and administrative
costs associated with the project.
"The tax is still underway, but
we have not yet figured out how it
will work," Rosse said. "There are
a good deal of things to be consid
ered, and many of the schools
have not had time" to study gen
eral initiatives because they were
preparing their own budget
reduction proposals.
Reshaping the University
Even as the cabinet committee
is compiling a final budget propos
al, members of the faculty are
moving ahead with what they call
"Phase Two": bolder proposals for
reshaping the University and
redistributing its functions.
Members of the senate budget
committee are beginning to meet
with 10 to 15 faculty members from
across the University with "a partic
ular emphasis on involving the
younger faculty, who represent the
future of this institution," accord
ing to Committee Chair Richard
Zare, professor of chemistry.
The committee members will ask
"questions about reshaping the Uni
versity," Zare said. "We want to work
toward elevating people's imagina
tions as to what this placr can be."
