# ASSU senate ends run-offs, flier limits
## 
### Andy Dworkin Katie Mauro Staff writers 
The ASSU Senate voted last night to
reform election rules by eliminating flier lim
its, raising the current campaign expenditure
limits and doing away with run-off elections
for Council of Presidents races.
The abolition of flier and spending limits,
proposed in an election reform bill, was initial
ly rejected by the senate at about 11 p.m. by a
vote of 11-8. Soon after, the senate moved
from their regular meeting place in the Law
School to the ASSU office, where a smaller
group of senators passed a new version of the
bill at around 12:45 a.m.
By a vote of 14-1, senators approved an
overhauled version of the original proposal

that raised current spending limits by 50 per
cent and removed all limits on the number of
fliers that can be distributed.
The bill will also increase spending limits to
keep up with inflation starting next year.
Under the old system, senate candidates
could spend up to $60 on their campaigns and
distribute up to 500 fliers. COP slates could
spend up to $200 and distribute 750 fliers.
The guidelines approved last night allow
senate candidates to spend $90, and COP
slates $300.
However, the approved version of the bill
may not be final. According to graduate sena
tor Neil Crellin, the bill is likely to be recon
sidered at the next senate meeting. Any sena
tor who voted to approve the bill may call for
it to be reconsidered at the next meeting.
In abolishing COP run-off elections, the

senate instituted a "preferential voting" sys
tem, in which the slate receiving the greatest
total number of votes wins the election, regard
less of whether they received a majority.
Other changes included increasing the
responsibility of the Hearings Officer to police
elections.
Last night's debate over flier and expendi
ture limits was shorter than at the last meeting,
but no less divisive. The election reform bill has
been at the center of heated debate for weeks.
In an unusual confrontation just before 11
p.m., graduate senator Doug Bone, an author
of the reform bill, forced undergraduate sena
tor Jason Snyder to the senate room floor in
response to the younger man's jibes. Snyder is
a vocal proponent of flier and spending limits.
Both rose quickly from the floor, unhurt
and seemingly on friendly terms.
