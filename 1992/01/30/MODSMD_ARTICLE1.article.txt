# New law requires improved disabled access
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Stanford will have to increase
its disability access to comply
with sweeping legislation passed
last weekend that mandates
equal access to facilities, tailored
resources and employment
opportunities for the disabled.
The Americans with Disabili
ties Act, which went into effect
Sunday, requires equal access for
millions of disabled; bans employ
ment discrimination of individu
als with physical and mental
handicaps; and requires equal
public accommodations, trans
portation and telecommunication
services for the disabled.
While the act will "change the
face of the country," according to
Disability Resource Center Direc
tor Molly Sandperl, it will force
Stanford to bolster existing poli
cies and build better structures
for the disabled.
Sandperl said Stanford has
already had policies that serve
the disabled since 1973.
"I am thankful for the passing
of the (Americans with Disabili
ties Act)," Sandperl added. "This
added pressure will help to com
plete our obligation to the dis
abled."
Now, Stanford's challenge is to
apply the legislation to a campus
of decades-old sandstone build
ings. Retrofitting will not come
cheaply, and in a time of belt
tightening, many are concerned
with the cost of compliance.
"Anything that has to do with
money is hard at Stanford," said
Ray Bacchetti, acting vice presi
dent for planning and manage
ment. "We have a lot of obliga
tions. We need a long-term plan
to keep them on the agenda."
By law, the University has
about a year to create a plan for
implementation, said Sharon
Parker, director of the Office of
Multicultural Development.
"I support the legislation
wholeheartedly," said Parker.
"It's an important, historic piece
of legislation. It's important for
us to take the next step forward.
Addressing the changes
The idea of creating some type
of task force to address disability
issues has been discussed for
about a year, according to Parker.
"We're closer now than we
have been in recent months in
getting people to pay attention,"
Parker said. Task force members
will be chosen soon.
But the precursor of a Univer
sity advisory group on the legisla
tion met Monday and "kicked
some ideas around," said Ben
Asaro, manager of special projects
for facilities. Once formed, this
core group will study the new leg
islation in order to establish crite
ria for assessing Stanford's needs.
