# New law requires improved disabled access
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Stanford will have to increase
its disability access to comply
with sweeping legislation passed
last weekend that mandates
equal access to facilities, tailored
resources and employment
opportunities for the disabled.
The Americans with Disabili
ties Act, which went into effect
Sunday, requires equal access for
millions of disabled; bans employ
ment discrimination of individu
als with physical and mental
handicaps; and requires equal
public accommodations, trans
portation and telecommunication
services for the disabled.
While the act will "change the
face of the country," according to
Disability Resource Center Direc
tor Molly Sandperl, it will force
Stanford to bolster existing poli
cies and build better structures
for the disabled.
Sandperl said Stanford has
already had policies that serve
the disabled since 1973.
"I am thankful for the passing
of the (Americans with Disabili
ties Act)," Sandperl added. "This
added pressure will help to com
plete our obligation to the dis
abled."
Now, Stanford's challenge is to
apply the legislation to a campus
of decades-old sandstone build
ings. Retrofitting will not come
cheaply, and in a time of belt
tightening, many are concerned
with the cost of compliance.
"Anything that has to do with
money is hard at Stanford," said
Ray Bacchetti, acting vice presi
dent for planning and manage
ment. "We have a lot of obliga
tions. We need a long-term plan
to keep them on the agenda."
By law, the University has
about a year to create a plan for
implementation, said Sharon
Parker, director of the Office of
Multicultural Development.
"I support the legislation
wholeheartedly," said Parker.
"It's an important, historic piece
of legislation. It's important for
us to take the next step forward.
Addressing the changes
The idea of creating some type
of task force to address disability
issues has been discussed for
about a year, according to Parker.
"We're closer now than we
have been in recent months in
getting people to pay attention,"
Parker said. Task force members
will be chosen soon.
But the precursor of a Univer
sity advisory group on the legisla
tion met Monday and "kicked
some ideas around," said Ben
Asaro, manager of special projects
for facilities. Once formed, this
core group will study the new leg
islation in order to establish crite
ria for assessing Stanford's needs.
"We need to decide what's
important, what things we should
we judge ourselves by," Asaro said.
"Then there must be a build
ing-by-building assessment of
how well we meet the criteria,
after which we can establish a
needs list," he continued.
"This puts us into the priority
stage, determining how we can
best serve our population and
organization. We want to make
sure we're putting our resources
where we will get the best results
for the most amount of people."
"There's a tremendous amount
of ignorance about this issue,"
Asaro said. "I'm trying to learn as
much about it as I can. I am
amazed at how ignorant I was.
Now I need to get smart."
What's been done already
In the early 1980s, the Universi
ty drew up a plan to make all pro
grams accessible to disabled stu
dents. Under this plan, first-floor
access was secured in most resi
dences, and wheelchair ramps were
installed throughout the Quad.
Provisions guaranteed disabled
students access to all campus and
residential programs. And any
class held in an inaccessible loca
tion would be moved if a disabled
student wanted to take it.
The legislation makes require
ments stricter. The new law says
upper levels of buildings must be
fully accessible.
Although University officials
expressed support for the legisla
tion, they anticipate difficulty in
retrofitting the frequently his
toric and architecturally signifi
cant buildings at a 100-year-old
university.
"We need to decide what are
reasonable criteria," Asaro said.
"To install elevators in every
building would very costly, and we
are looking at whether there's
another way to meet these criteria.
"Hopefully, technology will
catch up to us and help us along
this path," he said, adding that
smaller, less expensive chair lifts
may replace conventional elevators.
Asaro said outfitting campus
buildings with appropriate ramps
was not as easy as it may seem.
"Areas such as the Old Union
Clubhouse are highly frequent
ed," he said. "But they are also

the toughest. If they were easy,
they would have been done
already."
Asaro pointed out that ramps
must have appropriate dimen
sions — one vertical inch to each
horizontal foot — to be acceptable.
"A clubhouse ramp that goes
all the way over to Memorial
Church just isn't reasonable," he
said. "When you talk about ramps
you get into the area of aesthetics.
Access plans have to be done with
some regard for the aesthetics of
building, so it looks like it's
always been there."
"I don't know that it will change
the priorities of future planning,"
said Asst. Vice President for Plan
ning and Management Valerie
Veronin. The University is already
committed to making buildings

accessible, she added.
"In the future, however, the
requirements we meet will be a lot
tighter — we'll need elevators.
And this will affect what we do to
retrofit our existing buildings.
Before we just might not have
thought to do everything that is
now required," she said.
Veronin cited wheelchair
accessible bathrooms, automatic
door-openers and braille direc
tional signs as examples of fre
quently overlooked features cru
cial to disabled people.
"We have quite a bit more to
do," Bacchetti said. "Many of the
plans for earthquake-damaged
buildings do not adhere to the act.
This will need to be changed."
While most of the remodeling
will center on structural improve

ments, other advancements —
like providing phone service for
the hearing impaired — will also
be implemented.
Finding the funds
When the University created
its transition plan in the 1980s,
money was set aside for disability
resources.
The General Access Improve
ment fund was used to pay for
expenses such as providing sign
language interpreters or individu
al work stations for the disabled,
as well as larger projects, like
retrofitting campus buildings.
This money is spent, however,
and finding new funds is now an
issue — particularly since the
implementation of the law comes
at a time of financial crisis at the
University.
Sandperl said "the trick will be
to get these needs met within the
constraints of the budget process."
Employment will change
In addition to public accommo
dation, Stanford must face chal
lenges in the employment arena
— including both discrimination
and access issues.
This involves "modifications
and adjustments that will enable
a qualified disabled employee to
perform his or her job functions,"
according to the law.
Kathy Davis, manager of
employment in Human Resources,
said this means "educating hiring
officers of the full implications of
the law and interpreting the clause
of reasonable accommodation."
Parker added that the legisla
tion focuses on access and not on
employment, "But as we become
more accessible, a byproduct will
be more pro-active outreach in
our employment arena."
And several staff members are
anxious to see the University
more committed to employing dis
abled people. "I'd like them to
working on hiring more people
with disabilities — faculty and
staff," said one member of the
Disability Staff Forum, pointing
out that there were no tenured
faculty members who are dis
abled.
The legislation "is supposed to
have Stanford comply and move
forward, but the campus really
needs to be educated," the staff
member said.
