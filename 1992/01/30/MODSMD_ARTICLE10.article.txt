Leaders promise arms cutbacks
WASHINGTON (AP) — George Bush and Boris Yeltsin raised
the world's expectations for their first post-Soviet meeting with
separate offers of dramatic nuclear weapons cutbacks.
The three-hour summit on Saturday was once seen as a get
acquainted session, and a chance for the Russian president to per
sonally brief Bush on the struggle tcward political and economic
reform in the former Soviet Union.
But the scenario changed after Bush, in his State of the Union
address Tuesday night, proposed major reductions in nuclear
arsenals and Yeltsin responded with even more sweeping ideas.
Now the world is anticipating an announcement from Camp David
firming up intentions to halt the (generation-long) practice of avert
ing war by holding each other's territory hostage to nuclear attack.
Tass gets new name
MOSCOW (AP) — The state-run news agency Tass yesterday
formally changed its name to the Information Telegraph Agency
of Russia under a reorganization order by President Boris Yeltsin.

vice department, said that in dispatches from Russia and around
the world, Tass would be called "ITAR-Tass." The initials for the
agency's new name are the same in Russian and English.
Officials said the reorganization was proposed because the Rus
sian government could no longer afford to maintain its Russian
Information Agency along with Tass.
