About four years ago,
I traveled to Calcutta, India,
about to face my first assign
ment as a young foreign service
officer.
I was healthy, educated and
employed — and a U.S. citizen. By
these simple criteria I was better
off than the vast majority of people
in that city — or in the world, for
that matter. But I suspected that
my work planning cultural and
educational exchanges, while well
intentioned, would be of no mate
rial benefit to Calcutta. I anxiously
hoped my year in Calcutta would
ennoble me, but I feared it would
jade me.
Behind these feelings hid some
peculiarly American assumptions:
that problems like hunger, poverty
and illiteracy were solvable; that
by dint of caring I might somehow
make the world a better place.
I discovered that most Calcut
tans did not share these assump
tions. Indeed, they could not afford
to. The world around them was
harsh; their duty was to survive.
Few saw much of a personal role in
ameliorating the problems of the
city — not the wealthy denizens of
my neighborhood, not the servants
who worked for them, not the
homeless who occupied the sur
rounding streets and not the most
desperate of all, the jobless. In a
very poor country, society's prob
lems were simply a given.
I wondered whether this was
the fundamental difference
between the poor Third World and
America: that the problems we
face as a people are absurdly small
compared with our capacity for
solving them. When I returned to
my own world, I felt jarred by the
material affluence but energized
by the brisk, "can-do" wind in the
air. This was a place where things
could happen!
But like any convert, I found it
hard to share my vision. The
urban social problems of the early
1980s grew cancerously through
out the decade. And people's atti
tudes toward them changed.
Before I left for India in 1987,

homelessness was a major problem
in Washington, D.C. People
expressed shock, indignation and
disbelief at this awful turn of
affairs. But two years later, I sensed
a more muted reaction — annoy
ance and practiced indifference.
Homelessness had ceased being an
anomaly and had become accepted
as normal, part of our landscape.
What had happened?
Here's a bit of irony: When I
returned to Washington, I noticed
for the first time the assured sense
of purpose people carried as they
marched to work. This was the
kind of optimism I missed in Cal
cutta. But I watched those same
folks step over others who had
dropped out of society.
Most of us have narrowed our
worlds; we've systematically elimi
nated groups of people we would
rather not care about. In essence,
we've starting adopting an atti
tude with some logic in a poor
country, but nonsensical and inex
cusable in our own. We've collec
tively begun to buy into the lie that
tragedies like homelessness,
poverty and racism are inevitable,
as if they were acts of nature like
earthquakes and floods rather
than issues with causes and solu
tions.
This reality intrudes into my
life at Stanford, a place where civic
mindedness is a virtue. At a mini
mall a few blocks from my apart
ment stands a woman holding a
sign that reads "Will Work for
Food." Who she is, how she ended
up stranded amid Peninsula afflu
ence, I don't know. Virtually every
time I've driven past this place in
the past two years, I've seen her.
But I've never seen anyone help
her, and I've never done anything
myself. She's just a part of the
landscape, a metaphor for indiffer
ence.
It doesn't surprise me anymore
that I see this woman, or others
like her. But I don't understand
why most people seem resigned to
her plight or how I've become one
of those indifferent onlookers.
