## Bushbowl TV: a big bomb 
### 
PRESIDENT BUSH MUST BE very
happy — Washington won the
Super Bowl and the Cold War all in
the same week.
After listening to his State of the
Union address Tuesday night, I'm con
vinced that deep in his heart, George
really wants to be Coach George. His
speech was indistinguishable from the
postgame interview with Redskin Coach
Joe Gibbs, and there wasn't a whole lot of
difference between Monday's sports page
and yesterday's front page.
Right-thinking people have spent the
past 40 years chastising the superpowers
for treating the globe like a giant grid
iron. As we leave the Cold War era, you
would imagine that George would
respond to such criticism by emphasizing
the seriousness of the struggle just
ended. Soberly, he would tell us that the
Cold War was not just a game, but a
moral battle so great we would rather kill
ourselves than lose.
But George did just the opposite. He
gloried in the sport of it all. "For the Cold
War didn't 'end' — it was won," he told
us. "America won the cold war." In his
self-congratulatory reverie — I heard the
address on the radio but am told that
early in the speech George poured cham
pagne on himself — he had no time to
reflect on the death of Soviet tyranny or
the folly of the arms race. He was too
busy playing King of the Hill. "A world

once divided into two armed camps now
recognizes one sole and pre-eminent
power, the United States of America."
"Communism died this year," he told
us, but we and a billion or so Chinese
know it isn't true. What died was the
Soviet Union, our perennial Super Bowl
adversary, whom we fought — not
because the Soviets were communist —
but because they could throw bombs
almost as well as we could.
George wove both his honesty and his
cynicism into the fabric of this speech. He
was willing, even proud, to admit that the
Cold War was simply a power struggle. The
contest, he told us, was not between our
ideology and theirs, it was between us and
them. At least Ronald Reagan — who
learned his foreign policy while memorizing
lines for "Knute Rockne: All American" —
was stupid enough to believe there was
some moral force behind his foreign policy.
George was less honest but just as cyn
ical in the rest of his speech. He tried
once again to convince us that Desert
Storm was fought to "liberate Kuwait."
Ha. He cares no more for Kuwaitis than
he does for Haitians or Salvadorans or
Chileans or the students in Tiananmen
Square. Saddam Hussein could have
butchered every last Kuwaiti and George
would have sat in the White House sip
ping Pepto Bismol were it not for the oil
involved.
And what sporting event would be

complete without moms and dads on the
sidelines rooting for their children.
George was truly at his finest when he
played the proud parent, boasting of his
kids' prowess on the playing fields of
Korea, Vietnam and Iraq. These young
Americans were brave and free, and they
spotted Elvis everywhere. As George
said, "What a group of kids we've sent
out into the world."
Why is it still necessary to tell him
that war, be it cold or hot, is not really a
football game? After high school football
games the players get into their street
clothes and go to McDonald's. After wars
they get into body bags and go to
morgues. Football rivals threaten to TP
their opponents' houses. Superpower
rivals threaten to vaporize their oppo
nents' houses. Hasn't he learned these
differences by now?
Like a victorious football coach,
George sang praises of his players' skill
and spirit. But there is no glory in war
and no honor in dying to be No. 1. "What
a group of kids we've sent out into the
world." If only they had all come back.
