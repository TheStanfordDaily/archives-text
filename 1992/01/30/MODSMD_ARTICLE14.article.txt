Stanford needs Salamanca contact in changing world

I AM WRITING to express my severe
dissatisfaction with the plans to close
the campus in Salamanca. Some
thing that attracted me strongly to Stan
ford was the strength of the overseas
programs. Lately, however, I get the
impression that the overseas studies
programs have become less of a priority.
My perception of the matter is that
the foreign campuses are becoming more
separate from the countries in which
they are located. It worries me that life
at our campuses abroad will become
almost indistinguishable from the one
we lead here at home, in which case the
students will have to journey outside the
confines of the University to get cultural
exposure.
Salamanca, with its native professors,

close relationship with the surrounding
community and emphasis on the Span
ish language, is a campus in which cul
tural exchange isn't just a buzzword.
I also see the termination of the Sala
manca campus as a slight to the impor
tance of the Spanish language. I'd like to
be fluent in Spanish, and I know that the
only way to achieve the fluency I desire is
to submerge myself in the language.
I've heard disturbing rumors that
students who study at the Santiago cam
pus sometimes return with poorer Span
ish skills than before they went. In the
future, especially here in California, the
ability to speak Spanish fluently will be
paramount in the interaction with the
growing Hispanic population. What bet
ter place to study a language than the

country in which it originated?
The financial rationality of the deci
sion to close the Salamanca campus baf
fles me. The $75,000 budget is miniscule
compared to those of other campuses,
some of which have budgets five and six
times that of Salamanca's.
I know three undergraduates that
would stop out of Stanford and go with
another school if Stanford-in-Salamanca
closed, in which case the University
would lose at least $75,000. I have also
heard the argument that Stanford would
save money on food and housing costs if
it opened a Latin American campus to
replace the Spanish one.
How much would we really be likely
to save? I'd be willing to bet that hous
ing and food costs at Florence and

Oxford aren't paltry — why not move
the Oxford campus to Canada? They
speak English in Calgary, the food and
housing are less expensive and there
must be cultural phenomena there that
are absent in Great Britain.
I realize that the University is finan
cially strained at the moment, but in
making cutbacks we must remember
that Stanford's reputation is not unim
peachable. The lack of a campus in
Spain will be noticed, and in a world
that is becoming ever more globally
minded it will be sorely missed. Please
don't do the students of this university a
disservice; there is student support for
Stanford-in-Salamanca.
