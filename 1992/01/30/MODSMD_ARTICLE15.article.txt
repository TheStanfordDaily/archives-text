# Cowell mix-ups create unhealthy frustration for wounded student
## 
### 
Everyone jokes about the inadequacy
of our student health center, and I am
writing to confirm its sorry state of
being.
Last quarter during finals, I was in a
biking accident and injured my nose. I
naively believed I could receive suitable
health care from Cowell. (After all, they
do provide that oh-so cool, safe-sex dorm
lecture where the girl fondles the dildo
as she attempts to demonstrate proper
condom "mounting.") But I digress.
After having a nurse, not a doctor exam
ine me, they sent me down for X-rays.
A doctor finally entered the picture
to examine the X-rays and told me I
had fractured my nose, but that there
was nothing they could do for it. "Just
be careful for the next three weeks," I

was told.
The day following my insightful con
sultation, I received a phone call from a
sympathetic, yet strangely over-con
cerned nurse. "We neglected to give you
pain medication yesterday," she said.
"Are you feeling any pain?" Well, what
do you think? "If you need any, come in
and ask for some," she told me.
Upon my return from winter break, I
received a message from a new doctor
whom I had never met. The supposed
fracture was not really a fracture, and
the doctor and two nurses who looked at
my X-ray had misinterpreted it.
What prompts me to write this letter
now is the $164.28 bill I just picked up
for their incompetent services. I also
know of someone in my dorm who was
diagnosed as having a virus and was
given Advil. Who do they think they're
kidding? They are playing with the devil
and potential lawsuits if they don't get
their act together.
