## Take me out to the ballgame Card wins opener, 10-2 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
If season openers are any indication of
the upcoming season, then the Stanford
baseball team has absolutely nothing to
worry about. In a game delayed 24 hours
due to a rain-out, the Cardinal rained hits
on the Santa Clara Titans, beating them
10-2, and getting 13 hits in the process.
"It was a good first game," said coach
Mark Marquess. "We played good 'D',
which is always great. At first we were
tentative at the plate, but we loosened
up in the later innings."
Did they ever. The seventh and eighth
innings alone saw eight Cardinal hits,
eight Cardinal runs, and about eight
Titan pitchers as well. The eighth stanza
saw the entire Stanford batting order hit
around.
Especially notable was the perfor
mance of senior left-fielder and lead-ofT
man Dave Cornell. His line? He went 4-6,
with two doubles, two runs batted-in, and
a stolen base. And guess where the second
year transfer spent his first two years of
collegiate baseball. .. Santa Clara.
"There was no bitterness, but it was
definitely nice to do well against an old
team," Cornell said.
"Dave's done a really good job for us,
ever since [the latter parti of last year,"
said coach Marquess. "He hits, bunts,
and can run well, too."
Right handed junior Brian Sackinsky
was the starting pitcher for Stanford, and

went four innings giving up no runs and
just three hits, striking out one. On the
offensive side, Stanford didn't seem to be
able to get going as quickly. A lone run in
the second, following a David Holbrook
double and a Santa Clara error, was all
the productivity the Card could muster.
Then the bottom of the fifth arrived,
and Jeffrey Hammonds came to the
plate as the lead-off hitter in the inning.
The first strike that pitcher Mark Fabela
offered up to Hammonds ended up some
where in Mountain View, as the junior
center fielder crushed the ball, sending it
on a rope over the scoreboard in left
field. Hammonds ended up the game
going 2-3 with two stolen bases.
Junior Tim Moore came in to pitch for
the Cardinal in the fifth to protect the 2-
0 lead, and succeeded very nicely until
the seventh, when Santa Clara catcher
Randy Ortega hit a two-run homer over
the left field fence, tying up the game.
But then came the torrid bottom of
the inning, when a hustle single by Steve
Solomon and back-to-back doubles by
Chris Kemper and Cornell gave three
runs to the Cardinal cause, and a lead
that would never be relinquished.
Moore ended up pitching four
innings, giving up five hits and two runs,
striking out three. Junior Jamie Sepeda
came in to pitch the ninth, giving up no
hits and striking out two.
"The first game is so crucial," said
Cornell. "It really sets the tone for the
team.
