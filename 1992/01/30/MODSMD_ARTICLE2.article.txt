# Athletes cry foul on budget cuts
## Proposal calls for gym closure, 30% slash from club sports 
### Liesl Olson 
Weight lifters are up in arms about
a budget proposal that would close
Encina Gym next year and move
equipment to the smaller Roble Gym.
"That sucks," said Michael Stan
ford, a Cultures, Ideas and Values lec
turer. "They can't possibly fit every
one in that one little room at Roble.
I'm glad that this is my last year
here."
Stanford lost his job to budget
cuts.
"I can't see how cutting this is
going to free up that much money,"
said Josh Loflus, a junior.
The Department of Athletics,
Physical Education and Recreation
released a summary of their budget

cut proposals this week that included
their intention to close Encina during
1993-94, and merge those recreation
al activities into the current programs
at Roble Gym. This reduction was
proposed as part of a larger plan out
lining the department's efforts to slice
$700,000 from its operating budget, a
19.3 percent reduction.
Athletic Director Ted Leland was
unavailable for comment yesterday
on how his department would handle
the closure.
Officials in the department have
also proposed a $30;000 cut from the
$100,000 club sports budget.
Shirley Schoof, assistant athletic
director for Recreation and Educa
tional Programs, said the cuts will be
spread across all 22 club sports. "It

will hit everybody," she said.
Schoof said individual club sports
can make up for the budget cuts by
fund raising. They can also decrease
their budgets, possibly by "canceling
a trip or something," she said. The
clubs can also petition to raise the $3
student fee for club sports to $4.
According to Rugby Club Presi
dent Owen Williams, "We're going to
have to look at more fund raising and
turn to our alumni foundation."
The cuts "will have some effect
but we'll come through because of the
strength of oar alumni support," he
added.
Williams also said some teams, like
ice hockey, might have more trouble
dealing with the cuts because the sports
themselves are more costly to play.

save money by closing the gym and moving its weight facilities to Roble Gym is not getting a favorable reception
among some users.
