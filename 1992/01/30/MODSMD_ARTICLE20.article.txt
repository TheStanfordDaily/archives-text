# Netters kick off dual-meet season
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Editorial staff 
Finally, after numerous preseason events and
tournaments, the men's tennis team opens its regu
lar season at 1:30 this afternoon at the Stanford
Tennis Stadium.
In their dual meet debut, the Cardinal will take
on the Rainbows of Hawaii. Sporting a complete,
injury-free lineup, Stanford head coach Dick Gould
is "looking forward to the match."
One highlight of this match will be the combined
play of both the men's and women's teams. The men
will duel on courts 1, 4 through 7 and 11 while the
women will compete on the other six courts.
Alex O'Brien, Michael Flanagan and Chris Coco
tos lead the Cardinal pack. Flanagan's nagging wrist
injury seems to have finally healed. "He's only been
playing for about an hour a day but his wrist hasn't
bothered him — knock on wood," Gould said.
Robert Devens, Jason Yee and Vimal Patel will
round out the lineup against the unranked Rain
bows. The doubles lineup will be determined after
singles match play.
Hawaii remains a bit of a mystery team because,
when the Cardinal travelled to Hawaii in November,
bad weather kept the men from playing. "No one
even got a game in. They'd warm up and then it
would start raining again," Gould noted.
Gould is not too worried though. "They have a
couple foreigners on their team, but they're not in
the top 20. It will be a good chance to get ready for
San Diego."
Tomorrow, the Card should face a real challenge
when they take on the Toreros. San Diego sports a
Peruvian Davis Cup teammember, Jose Luis Norie
ga, who was ranked fourth in preseason polls. This
match will also be at 1:30 p.m. at Stanford Tennis
Stadium.
Overall, the 1992 Cardinal is healthy and ready
for action. "We're looking for two good meets to get
the season going," Gould said.
