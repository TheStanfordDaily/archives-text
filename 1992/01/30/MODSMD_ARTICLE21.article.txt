# Cagers take on 'Cats
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
After 15 games it is mid-quar
ter for the Stanford women's bas
ketball team, and the squad is on
track to receive an "A."
The team is 14-1 overall, co
leaders in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence at 4-J., and ranked No. 3 in
the nation. The Cardinal has
defeated seven teams that were at
some point this season in the top
-25, three in the top-10, and one
top-ranked team.
Although the team's focus is
unquestionably on its All-Ameri
ca candidate center Val Whiting,
the Cardinal has performed true
to the form of previous Tara Van-
Derveer teams, spreading the
wealth around with unselfish
play. The five players who started
the first 11 games all have double
figure scoring averages.
If tonight's game is anything
like past contests against Ari
zona, those averages may well go
up. However, chances are that
Arizona is not the blow-out team
that it once was.
After finishing 1-17 and last in
the Pac-10 last year, the Wildcats
got serious about being a complete
basketball school. They hired Joan
Bonvicini as their head coach.
Bonvicini is one of the most well
respected coaches in the women's
game, having guided Long Beach
State to two Final Fours and a
decade of 20-win seasons.
She probably has a few years to
go before she gets another 20-win
season, but she has already
improved the Arizona program.

The Wildcats, at 7-8, have already
won more games than they did
last year, and though they may be
overmatched by the talent and
depth of the Cardinal, they will be
scrappy and well-coached.
Like Stanford, the 'Cats are a
young team, and they will proba
bly start three sophomores in the
frontcourt — Margo Clark and
Shawn Coder at forward and
Megan Magee at center — with a
freshman and senior in the back
court — senior Mary Klemm at
the "1" guard and frosh Jacinda
Sweet at the "2."
A considerably more difficult
opponent will be Arizona State
this Saturday. The Sun Devils are
both talented and experienced.
They often like to run a three
guard lineup with two centers at
6-foot-6 and 6-foot-4. But either
one of their "3" players — for
ward Jovonne Smith and guard
Crystal Cobb — can score, as both
average 10.1 ppg.
If Stanford does not tighten up
its perimeter defense, which is
allowing its Pac-10 opponents to
hit on 45 percent of their three
pointers, Cobb could damage the
Cardinal much as Washington
State's Heather Norman did
when she nailed 5-of-6 treys.
Tip-off for both games is at
7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
Those in the Toyon Eating Clubs
or ofT-campus can watch a tape
delayed broadcast of the games on
Cable Co-op. And as always,
Jamie Zaninovich and Rob John
stone will be broadcasting live on
KSZU 90.1 FM and XTV will go
on the air at 7:20 p.m.
