Planted at the top of the key, Adam
Keefe yelled "Go" and hurled a bullet pass
at the back of freshman Bart Lammersen,
who was set up all alone under the basket.
Lammersen whirled around, but not
quickly enough to avoid being clocked in
the head by the purposefully aimed pass.
"Quickness, quickness," Keefe preached,
"you've got to bend your knees, have you're
hands ready, be prepared for anything."
"Go" — he screamed as they started
anew, and the ball sailed right at the fresh
man's midsection. "Go" — and it flew off
the backboard, forcing him to go high for a
rebound before laying the ball back in.
"Go" — a one-hopper at his feet, then a
perfect jump hook. "Go" — three feet over
his head, then a set, spin and jam.
Twenty or 30 times they ran through
the drill . . . the rest of the court was
empty, practice had been over for 15 min
utes. But Lammersen was as wide-eyed and
ready to learn as he must have been the
first day of freshman camp.
"It's always nice to work your first year
with older guys, and the freshman have
been really great about coming out and get
ting extra help. I think it will really benefit
them down the road," Keefe said.
This season, after losing four starters to
graduation, coach Mike Montgomery has
been forced to play some "inexperienced"
players in big games — and the freshman
have responded.
"Somebody was going to have to step up.
We lost a lot of leadership, a lot of physical
and mental toughness. Both Andy Poppink
and David Harbour have that toughness
and they've given us aggressive, active
play," Montgomery said.
Indeed no true freshman has made as
much of an impact for Stanford as these two
since the legendary red-head himself donned
the Cardinal & White for the first time. But
very often, talented freshman don't realize
their full potential without the early guid

ance of a quality upperclassman; someone to
help them adapt to the differences between
the high school and collegiate game, some
one to keep up their intensity level, someone
to serve, if you will, as a "role model."
Keefe had Wright and Lichti. Sean Elliot
had Steve Kerr. Christian Laettner had
Danny Ferry. And Harbour, Poppink,
Lammersen and the rest of the Cardinal
rookies have Keefe.
"He's a leader in practice and, as everyone
sees, he's our leader in the games. And, not
to sound mushy, but off the court he's like a
big brother to a lot of us," said Poppink.
"I know what guys see is his real sense
for the game, how hard he plays, the way
he wins races in practice, runs a mile in
under five minutes. He wants to win every
thing and that has to rub off on other peo
ple," said Montgomery.
And as Keefe reflects on his four years on
the Farm, he realizes that his leadership
could not only carry the Cardinal to the 1992
NCAAs, but also be a major factor in Stan
ford tournament drives of years to come.
"I think I've grown with the process . . .
it's not very natural for me to go out and be
a cheerleader. I think I've always been the
kind of guy who leads by example."
So far he's got quite a following.

Kevin Jeffery has two wishes for the coming
week: 1) the Cardinal pulls off another
sweep in the Great Northwest, 2) his col
umn won't get cut by 10 inches, again.
