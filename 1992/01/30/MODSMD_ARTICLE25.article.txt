This weekend the Stanford Equestrian Team will
be hosting its first intercollegiate horse show, with
competitors coming from Davis, Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo, USC and Fresno State.
Over 50 riders will be competing on all levels from
beginning to advanced. There are three different divi
sions they will be showing in: a "flat class," a jumping
class, and also a stock seat equitation class. In each of
these, the riders are judged solely on their riding per
formance, and not on the performance of their horses.
Riders will draw their rides from a hat, and are not
given any time to familiarize themselves with the
horses before the judging begins. In this way, the abil
ity of the rider to manage any given horse is judged,
instead of the quality of the horses themselves.
"It's a good program," said team president Aaron
Hegarty. "Everybody can ride, and there is a chance
for anyone to go on to the national level." This year,
the Equestrian team has close to 25 members, sev
eral of whom have been riding with the team for two
years or more.
Individual riders who do well in these shows may
earn enough points to qualify for "Zone" competi
tions, and from there have a shot at proceeding on to
the National Championships. Teams who do well
overall will compete in the Regionals, which are held
in Ft. Collins, Colorado. From there, only one team
will go on to the Nationals. This is the first year that
Stanford will compete in this national IHSA division.
This weekend's show will be held on Sunday at
the Red Barn, from 9-4 p.m.
