## 
### Luis Orona 
Carl Bernstein, who gained
fame when he exposed the
Watergate scandal with Bob
Woodward, blamed Richard
Nixon for contributing to the
contempt many Americans feel
for the media in a speech last
night in Kresge Auditorium.
"Contempt toward the press
was characteristic of the Nixon
administration," Bernstein
said. "It may be [that adminis
tration's] most important and
long-lasting legacy."
Brought to campus by the
ASSU Speakers' Bureau, Bern
stein said that in addition to
the government's efforts,
tabloid-style journalism and
the media's self-congratulatory
attitude have undermined the
credibility of the press.
"Lines spoken by Oprah,
Donahue, Geraldo and Diane
Sawyer are too often indistin
guishable," he said.
"We need to get back to real
reporting, to fact-searching, to
presenting the best attainable
version of the truth."
He said that in order to
regain the confidence of the
American public, the media
needs to stop presenting
"celebrity news" and instead to
examine the connection
between government policy
and life in America.
Illiteracy, poverty, inade
quate housing, drugs and
health care are issues that the
press should examine. Another
is race.
"Race — we I Americans] are
terrified of the subject. We
don't discuss it,"he said. "But
if those were white people by
the thousands living in the con
ditions of the housing projects
of the inner city, would we
stand for it? I don't think we
would.
"The conditions in America

It used to be that
reporting of the
President's speech
was almost
revered. But news
reporting is not
stenography. We
have to move away
from that.'

discover did not start with this
recession, but it's taken this
long for America to notice," he
said.
The media must report the
difference between the White
House rhetoric — "Mr. Bush's
reality" — and the American
reality, he said.
"It used to be that reporting
of the President's speech was

that," Bernstein said.
"If we did half as good a job
in covering the break-up of
things in this country as we did
in the break-up of the Soviet
Union, this country'd be in
great shape," he said.
He said the government has
successfully put into question
the conduct of the press by
often using examples that are
truly contemptible.
He attributes to the govern
ment's efforts the overwhelm
ing public approval of press
censorship during the Persian
Gulf War.
"There is a lower-world
press of gossip. And people are
thinking that the same think
ing is invading ihe serious
news media," Bernstein said.
