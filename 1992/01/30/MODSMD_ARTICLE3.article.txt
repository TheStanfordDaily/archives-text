# Cost problem is 'systemic,' hearing finds

### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
When Stanford first appeared before the House
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation last
March, it was like a painful trip to the dentist.
At yesterday's hearing, however, University
President Donald Kennedy's teeth were not the ones

being pulled.
Instead, government agencies tes
tified that the indirect-cost problem
is not limited to Stanford and that
universities nationwide have billed
the government inappropriately.
"The subcommittee has been
dismayed to discover the depth and
breadth of the indirect-cost abuses
at universities," said Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich , chair of the sub-

committee. "The federal government's partnership
with this nation's research universities is too impor
tant to allow this kind of misbehavior to continue."
While Dingell recounted the abuses at other uni
versities, including an $11,295 charge for a St.
Patrick's Day party at Syracuse University, there
were no new revelations about Stanford.
"Nothing that came out about Stanford was
new," said Larry Horton, associate vice president
for public affairs, in an interview after the hearing.
"The hearing showed that the (indirect-cost) prob
lem is a systemic one."
Norm Hanson, spokesman for the Office of Naval
Research, said in an interview after the hearing that
there were "no surprising revelations" and that the
hearing's message was that it is a "systemic problem
nationwide."
One government representative suggested that
part of the blame for the indirect-cost controversy
lies in the uncertainty about the regulations â€” the
Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21.
"Based on the results of our audits and an analy
sis of recent revisions to A-21, we concluded that A
-21 needs further improvements," said Thomas
Roslewicz, deputy inspector general for the Depart
ment of Health and Human Services.
Rear Adm. William Miller, chief of the Office of
Naval Research, said in yesterday's hearing that
changes to the rules can prevent future abuses "by
clarifying rule provisions and eliminating the need
for some interpretations of cost allocability."
But Miller added that "contracting abuses result
ed not from the OMB Cost Principles or from exist
ing Navy procedures and policies, but rather from
the failure of six civilian employees within the Office
of Naval Research to exercise proper oversight and
