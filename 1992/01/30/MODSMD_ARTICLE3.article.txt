# Cost problem is 'systemic,' hearing finds
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
When Stanford first appeared before the House
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation last
March, it was like a painful trip to the dentist.
At yesterday's hearing, however, University
President Donald Kennedy's teeth were not the ones

being pulled.
Instead, government agencies tes
tified that the indirect-cost problem
is not limited to Stanford and that
universities nationwide have billed
the government inappropriately.
"The subcommittee has been
dismayed to discover the depth and
breadth of the indirect-cost abuses
at universities," said Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich , chair of the sub-

committee. "The federal government's partnership
with this nation's research universities is too impor
tant to allow this kind of misbehavior to continue."
While Dingell recounted the abuses at other uni
versities, including an $11,295 charge for a St.
Patrick's Day party at Syracuse University, there
were no new revelations about Stanford.
"Nothing that came out about Stanford was
new," said Larry Horton, associate vice president
for public affairs, in an interview after the hearing.
"The hearing showed that the (indirect-cost) prob
lem is a systemic one."
Norm Hanson, spokesman for the Office of Naval
Research, said in an interview after the hearing that
there were "no surprising revelations" and that the
hearing's message was that it is a "systemic problem
nationwide."
One government representative suggested that
part of the blame for the indirect-cost controversy
lies in the uncertainty about the regulations — the
Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21.
"Based on the results of our audits and an analy
sis of recent revisions to A-21, we concluded that A
-21 needs further improvements," said Thomas
Roslewicz, deputy inspector general for the Depart
ment of Health and Human Services.
Rear Adm. William Miller, chief of the Office of
Naval Research, said in yesterday's hearing that
changes to the rules can prevent future abuses "by
clarifying rule provisions and eliminating the need
for some interpretations of cost allocability."
But Miller added that "contracting abuses result
ed not from the OMB Cost Principles or from exist
ing Navy procedures and policies, but rather from
the failure of six civilian employees within the Office
of Naval Research to exercise proper oversight and


Horton
to faithfully carry out their
assigned duties."
Despite the government's appar
ent recognition that the nation's
universities are not totally at fault
for the unallowable indirect-cost
charges, the questions surrounding
the memoranda of understanding
remain unanswered.
The MOUs were the indirect
cost reimbursement agreements
between the government and the
University.
All but one of Stanford's 125
MOUs — more than any other
university — were canceled last
April, reducing the University's
indirect-cost recovery rate to 55.5
percent and causing a $28 million
annual budget shortfall.
"It is our opinion that the gov
ernment should retroactively can
cel the memorandums of under
standing with Stanford" signed
during the 1980s, testified Fred
Newton, deputy director of the the
Defense Contract Audit Agency.
"It is our opinion that Stanford
owes the government $231 million

for excessive amounts billed dur
ing" the years 1981 to 1988.
Paul Biddle, the on-campus
Navy regulator, has also argued
that the MOUs are invalid because
of the "cozy" nature of the relation
ship between the University and
previous government negotiators.
But Stanford officials have
argued that the MOUs are valid,
binding contracts that cannot be
retroactively canceled. The Uni
versity has already appealed the
cancellation of the MOUs for fis
cal year 1991 to the Armed Ser
vices Board of Contract Appeals.
In yesterday's hearing, Miller
never told the subcommittee that
the MOUs should be retroactively
canceled, saying only that "a sep
arate audit and review is also
under way" on the issue.
"Ironically, in our agreements
with the Office of Naval
Research, they have not canceled
the MOUs" for the 1980s, Horton
said. "The DCAA position is
somewhat inexplicable, because it
is not the contracting agency and
does not set the rates.
"ONR must evaluate the mate
rial submitted by the DCAA and
by the University before it makes
a decision." he added.

sis of recent revisions to A-21, we concluded that A
-21 needs further improvements," said Thomas
Roslewicz, deputy inspector general for the Depart
ment of Health and Human Services.
Rear Adm. William Miller, chief of the Office of
Naval Research, said in yesterday's hearing that
changes to the rules can prevent future abuses "by
clarifying rule provisions and eliminating the need
for some interpretations of cost allocability."
But Miller added that "contracting abuses result
ed not from the OMB Cost Principles or from exist
ing Navy procedures and policies, but rather from
the failure of six civilian employees within the Office
of Naval Research to exercise proper oversight and


Horton
to faithfully carry out their
assigned duties."
Despite the government's appar
ent recognition that the nation's
universities are not totally at fault
for the unallowable indirect-cost
charges, the questions surrounding
the memoranda of understanding
remain unanswered.
The MOUs were the indirect
cost reimbursement agreements
between the government and the
University.
All but one of Stanford's 125
MOUs — more than any other
university — were canceled last
April, reducing the University's
indirect-cost recovery rate to 55.5
percent and causing a $28 million
annual budget shortfall.
"It is our opinion that the gov
ernment should retroactively can
cel the memorandums of under
standing with Stanford" signed
during the 1980s, testified Fred
Newton, deputy director of the the
Defense Contract Audit Agency.
"It is our opinion that Stanford
owes the government $231 million

for excessive amounts billed dur
ing" the years 1981 to 1988.
Paul Biddle, the on-campus
Navy regulator, has also argued
that the MOUs are invalid because
of the "cozy" nature of the relation
ship between the University and
previous government negotiators.
But Stanford officials have
argued that the MOUs are valid,
binding contracts that cannot be
retroactively canceled. The Uni
versity has already appealed the
cancellation of the MOUs for fis
cal year 1991 to the Armed Ser
vices Board of Contract Appeals.
In yesterday's hearing, Miller
never told the subcommittee that
the MOUs should be retroactively
canceled, saying only that "a sep
arate audit and review is also
under way" on the issue.
"Ironically, in our agreements
with the Office of Naval
Research, they have not canceled
the MOUs" for the 1980s, Horton
said. "The DCAA position is
somewhat inexplicable, because it
is not the contracting agency and
does not set the rates.
"ONR must evaluate the mate
rial submitted by the DCAA and
by the University before it makes
a decision." he added.
