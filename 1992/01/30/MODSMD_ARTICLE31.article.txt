# INTERMISSION
## THE
						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY. Remember my name 
### Val Masters Staff writer 
I've always wanted to be famous. Real famous.
Not well-they-say-he's-famous-but-frankly-I've
never-heard-of-the-guy famous like your average
Stanford Commencement speaker; not once-popu
lar-but-now-robbing-convenience-stores, former
'7os-child-star brand of famous; not even pretty
famous-but-I-wouldn't-exactly-recognize-him-let-
alone-scream-and-faint-if-I-saw-him-in-a-supermar-
ket famous like, say, Eugene T. Maleska.
No, I mean really famous. I want Robin Leach
prancing around on my property. I want the tabloids
discussing the Elvis-and-Roseanne-headed big-foot
child I gave birth to. I want to be rich and pompous,

have a few sex scandals, become addicted to cocaine,
gain 230 pounds, get in a horrible motorcycle acci
dent and then miraculously recover from all those
things so I can write an uplifting, inspirational, tell
all autobiography (which also reveals that my par
ents — gasp! — spanked me as a child) and tout my
comeback on "Larry King Live."
I also want to date other famous people. Famous
people, you see, only go out with other famous peo
ple. If a non-famous guy is attracted to a famous
woman on TV, all he can do is moan wistfully and
maybe buy her wall calendar or work-out video. If
that same poor sod were famous, however, he could
just call her up, take her to dinner, and in no time
they'd have a picture together in People magazine.
If I ever get famous, the first person I'll call is
(heh-heh) that evil Antichrist of fine acting, Julia
Roberts:
"Hey, Jules? This is Chris Harris, from-"
"Omigosh, like, hel-LO! Thank God for YOU!"
"Yeah, uh, thanks, (uncomfortable silence) Hey, I
thought you were really good in "Dying Young." That's
one of my favorite movies. I watch it all the time."
"Really? Why, like, totally fantastic! I'm SO hon
ored!"
"Um . . . (more uncomfortable silence) I was won
dering, if, oh, I dunno, d'wanna, uh, go out some
time to, say, oh I dunno, the Academy Awards cere
mony or somethin'?"
"Oooohmigosh, YES! Like, I'd totally totally
LOVE to, y'know y'know?"
"Yeah, so would I. . . . NOT!" (click)
Apparently, being famous could have it's hang
ups as well.
But I'm not quite there yet. Sure, it's great to see
my face scattered across campus every other Thurs
day, soaking up water around bathroom stalls every
other Friday and staring up en masse out of the recy
cling bins every other Saturday, but all that means
is that people kind of recognize me when they see
me. Thus I get mistaken for all sorts of people when
walking in White Plaza. Some examples:
• "(insert name here)! How've you been since
Freshman English?"
• "Hey, aren't you Flag Boy?"
• "It's Enrico Palazzo!"
• "Could I have your autograph, Mr. — Waaaait,
you're not Jean-Claude Van Damme!"
• "Lies! The non-voters know the truth! We must
band together against the unproductive class!"
Whoops, sorry. That last one was by Crazy Stan
ley, this week's resident White Plaza screwball. He's
as far left as The Stanford Review is right, and
almost as loony.
Last Spring I got the recognition I've been seeking.

In October of this year the compact disc will be 10
years old. And already he owns the playground.
The first CD player was introduced in Japan and
Europe in 1982 in a joint effort between the Dutch
manufacturer Philipps and the Japanese technologi
cal giant Sony. Five months later the first CD player
was introduced in the United States, and along with
it Billy Joel's "52nd Street," the first mass-marketed
pop CD.
That year Americans bought 30,000 CD players
and 800,000 CDs. Today more than 40 million CD
players have been sold in the United States, and con
sumers have bought more than 1 billion CDs. The
American consumer has nurtured the new kid on the
block, and ensured it a happy, healthy adolescence.
Still, childhood was tough. The Analog Gang from
the middle-class long-playing-record neighborhood
hassled the digital kid from the posh CD neighbor
hood mercilessly. He was the definitive product of
the Reagan era; sleek, fun and rich. They said the kid
was too harsh, and had no warmth, no soul.
They said and still say that the CD's high-end reg
ister (the treble) sounds too edgy, too "bright."
Indeed, many classical music recordings reveal a cer
tain edginess, most noticeable when the violins reach
those high-end peaks.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, the low-end
register (the bass) lacks the subtle nuances and
"warmth" of an analog recording. One listen to Miles
Davis' "Kind of Blue" on CD and it's clear that the
LP's certain smoky warmth is not all there.
Supporters of digital technology countered with
the CD's advantages: longer playing time, more infor
mation storage and lower noise distortion, as well as
indexing and programming capabilities. It might be
true that a diamond-tipped needle on a $1,500 car
tridge playing a mint-condition record on a top-of
the-line phonograph could sound better than a CD,

but CDs offered state-of-the-art sound to everyone,
not just the audiophiles who could afford it.
The only "fact" both factions agreed on wat that
the technologies behind analog recording and digital
recording are radically different.
Music is sound, and the electric.>l signal that rep
resents sound is a wave. As the sound gets louder,
the wave trets taller, and as the sound softens, the

wave flattens. With pitch, that wave gets narrower
as the pitch gets higher, and the wave broadens as
the pitch deepens.
Analog recordings trace that wave exactly and
store the information (music) on either a magnetic
tape, for cassettes, or the grooves of an LP. The vari
ations in the width and depth of that groove, which

is approximately the width of a human hair, repre
sent the music's original signal.
Therefore, when John Bonham hit that bass
drum the groove deepened and widened. The left
side of the groove represents the left channel, and
the right side of the groove represents the right
channel. The phonograph needle runs through the
groove, and the cartridge converts the movements
into a signal that is amplified by the stereo.
Digital technology takes that same sound wave
and converts it into a series of binary numbers (ones
and zeros). A digital sample of that sound wave is
taken at a rate of 44,100 times per second per chan
nel and stored as a series of numbers on the CD's
surface in groupings called "data pits."
A laser beam of light then reads these "data pits,"
which under an electron microscope look like circu
lar tracks of raised braille-like bumps, at a rate of
4.3218 million bits per second. Then, microproces
sors inside the CD player change the data back into
sound. There are approximately 3 billion "data pits"
on the surface of any given CD.
Though it might take a rocket scientist to under
stand how CDs work, the advantages over analog
recordings should be clear to everyone.
First, and most obvious, nothing but light ever
touches the surface of the CD. True, CDs aren't as
indestructible as they were first made out to be, and
using them as coasters is risky at best, but they will
never have those annoying snaps, crackles and pops
that are a necessary result of the normal wear and
tear of an LP.
Second, though LPs have lower distortion rates at
the bottom register, the hiss also increases as the
music gets softer because analog recordings cannot
differentiate between sound and music — that is
why every time you dub a cassette the hiss increases.
CDs, on the other hand, read solely those numbers
that carry music, thus eliminating that hiss.

THANK GOD FOR HARRIS!
