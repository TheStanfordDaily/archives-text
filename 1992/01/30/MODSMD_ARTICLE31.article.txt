# INTERMISSION
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY. Remember my name 
### Val Masters Staff writer 
I've always wanted to be famous. Real famous.
Not well-they-say-he's-famous-but-frankly-I've
never-heard-of-the-guy famous like your average
Stanford Commencement speaker; not once-popu
lar-but-now-robbing-convenience-stores, former
'7os-child-star brand of famous; not even pretty
famous-but-I-wouldn't-exactly-recognize-him-let-
alone-scream-and-faint-if-I-saw-him-in-a-supermar-
ket famous like, say, Eugene T. Maleska.
No, I mean really famous. I want Robin Leach
prancing around on my property. I want the tabloids
discussing the Elvis-and-Roseanne-headed big-foot
child I gave birth to. I want to be rich and pompous,

have a few sex scandals, become addicted to cocaine,
gain 230 pounds, get in a horrible motorcycle acci
dent and then miraculously recover from all those
things so I can write an uplifting, inspirational, tell
all autobiography (which also reveals that my par
ents — gasp! — spanked me as a child) and tout my
comeback on "Larry King Live."
I also want to date other famous people. Famous
people, you see, only go out with other famous peo
ple. If a non-famous guy is attracted to a famous
woman on TV, all he can do is moan wistfully and
maybe buy her wall calendar or work-out video. If
that same poor sod were famous, however, he could
just call her up, take her to dinner, and in no time
they'd have a picture together in People magazine.
If I ever get famous, the first person I'll call is
(heh-heh) that evil Antichrist of fine acting, Julia
Roberts:
"Hey, Jules? This is Chris Harris, from-"
"Omigosh, like, hel-LO! Thank God for YOU!"
"Yeah, uh, thanks, (uncomfortable silence) Hey, I
thought you were really good in "Dying Young." That's
one of my favorite movies. I watch it all the time."
"Really? Why, like, totally fantastic! I'm SO hon
ored!"
"Um . . . (more uncomfortable silence) I was won
dering, if, oh, I dunno, d'wanna, uh, go out some
time to, say, oh I dunno, the Academy Awards cere
mony or somethin'?"
"Oooohmigosh, YES! Like, I'd totally totally
LOVE to, y'know y'know?"
"Yeah, so would I. . . . NOT!" (click)
Apparently, being famous could have it's hang
ups as well.
But I'm not quite there yet. Sure, it's great to see
my face scattered across campus every other Thurs
day, soaking up water around bathroom stalls every
other Friday and staring up en masse out of the recy
cling bins every other Saturday, but all that means
is that people kind of recognize me when they see
me. Thus I get mistaken for all sorts of people when
walking in White Plaza. Some examples:
• "(insert name here)! How've you been since
Freshman English?"
• "Hey, aren't you Flag Boy?"
• "It's Enrico Palazzo!"
• "Could I have your autograph, Mr. — Waaaait,
you're not Jean-Claude Van Damme!"
• "Lies! The non-voters know the truth! We must
band together against the unproductive class!"
Whoops, sorry. That last one was by Crazy Stan
ley, this week's resident White Plaza screwball. He's
as far left as The Stanford Review is right, and
almost as loony.
Last Spring I got the recognition I've been seeking.

In October of this year the compact disc will be 10
years old. And already he owns the playground.
The first CD player was introduced in Japan and
Europe in 1982 in a joint effort between the Dutch
manufacturer Philipps and the Japanese technologi
cal giant Sony. Five months later the first CD player
was introduced in the United States, and along with
it Billy Joel's "52nd Street," the first mass-marketed
pop CD.
That year Americans bought 30,000 CD players
and 800,000 CDs. Today more than 40 million CD
players have been sold in the United States, and con
sumers have bought more than 1 billion CDs. The
American consumer has nurtured the new kid on the
block, and ensured it a happy, healthy adolescence.
Still, childhood was tough. The Analog Gang from
the middle-class long-playing-record neighborhood
hassled the digital kid from the posh CD neighbor
hood mercilessly. He was the definitive product of
the Reagan era; sleek, fun and rich. They said the kid
was too harsh, and had no warmth, no soul.
They said and still say that the CD's high-end reg
ister (the treble) sounds too edgy, too "bright."
Indeed, many classical music recordings reveal a cer
tain edginess, most noticeable when the violins reach
those high-end peaks.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, the low-end
register (the bass) lacks the subtle nuances and
"warmth" of an analog recording. One listen to Miles
Davis' "Kind of Blue" on CD and it's clear that the
LP's certain smoky warmth is not all there.
Supporters of digital technology countered with
the CD's advantages: longer playing time, more infor
mation storage and lower noise distortion, as well as
indexing and programming capabilities. It might be
true that a diamond-tipped needle on a $1,500 car
tridge playing a mint-condition record on a top-of
the-line phonograph could sound better than a CD,

but CDs offered state-of-the-art sound to everyone,
not just the audiophiles who could afford it.
The only "fact" both factions agreed on wat that
the technologies behind analog recording and digital
recording are radically different.
Music is sound, and the electric.>l signal that rep
resents sound is a wave. As the sound gets louder,
the wave trets taller, and as the sound softens, the

wave flattens. With pitch, that wave gets narrower
as the pitch gets higher, and the wave broadens as
the pitch deepens.
Analog recordings trace that wave exactly and
store the information (music) on either a magnetic
tape, for cassettes, or the grooves of an LP. The vari
ations in the width and depth of that groove, which

is approximately the width of a human hair, repre
sent the music's original signal.
Therefore, when John Bonham hit that bass
drum the groove deepened and widened. The left
side of the groove represents the left channel, and
the right side of the groove represents the right
channel. The phonograph needle runs through the
groove, and the cartridge converts the movements
into a signal that is amplified by the stereo.
Digital technology takes that same sound wave
and converts it into a series of binary numbers (ones
and zeros). A digital sample of that sound wave is
taken at a rate of 44,100 times per second per chan
nel and stored as a series of numbers on the CD's
surface in groupings called "data pits."
A laser beam of light then reads these "data pits,"
which under an electron microscope look like circu
lar tracks of raised braille-like bumps, at a rate of
4.3218 million bits per second. Then, microproces
sors inside the CD player change the data back into
sound. There are approximately 3 billion "data pits"
on the surface of any given CD.
Though it might take a rocket scientist to under
stand how CDs work, the advantages over analog
recordings should be clear to everyone.
First, and most obvious, nothing but light ever
touches the surface of the CD. True, CDs aren't as
indestructible as they were first made out to be, and
using them as coasters is risky at best, but they will
never have those annoying snaps, crackles and pops
that are a necessary result of the normal wear and
tear of an LP.
Second, though LPs have lower distortion rates at
the bottom register, the hiss also increases as the
music gets softer because analog recordings cannot
differentiate between sound and music — that is
why every time you dub a cassette the hiss increases.
CDs, on the other hand, read solely those numbers
that carry music, thus eliminating that hiss.

THANK GOD FOR HARRIS!



GB Manriquez —Daily
I wrote a column from Berlin that
mentioned how easy classes were
there. ("No wonder they call it
Over C's studies.") A week later, I
received a letter from the "deputy
director" of the Overseas Program.
It began. "We aren't amused."
He told me, as I sat there skip
ping my language class, that
overseas classes were in fact quite
demanding. Furthermore, my
comments would cause the down
fall of Berlin, the overseas office
and Western Civilization as a
whole if the budget-slashers ever
read it.
I experienced a series of emo
tions while reading:
1) Laughter. Until I realized
the letter was serious. Then:
2) Surprise. If I were one of the
Fusco Brothers, I'd have had at
least three or four exclamation
points over my head. I couldn't
believe that people actually read
and cared about my column. I
almost cried.
3) Confusion. What the hell is
"deputy director," anyway?
Sounds like a cartoon character.
Does he have a real job, or does he
just stand around with a star on
his vest behind the "sheriff direc
tor," drooling from the side of his
mouth and going "Ayup! Ayup!"
every few minutes?
4) Denial, of course. Berlin

was easy, and it wasn't even one
of the easiest programs, com
pared to, say, Florence, where
"nobody has computers so they
pretty much don't assign us
papers here."
Now granted, Firenze (that's
Italian for Florence — "Flo
rence," of course, being the logi
cal English translation) is a beau
tiful city, much more beautiful
than anything even the coast of
France has to offer. As they say,
"With Firenze like this, who
needs any Nice?"
But let's face it: The villa in
Florence is Stanford's best argu
ment against the complaint that
there aren't any housed sorori
ties. Stanford-in-Florence accepts
more Greeks than Italians into
their program.
Anyway, nothing much ever
happened. The Berlin program,
despite the old d.d.'s claims, sud
denly decided it wasn't rigorous
enough and got tougher. I got out
in time, and returned to the rela
tive obscurity of being just anoth
er local columnist with a really
badly cut-out mug shot.
It's comfy, here with my Julia
Roberts wall calendar/dart board.
But someday, I promise, I'll be
giving her a ring, and it won't be
diamond. Baby, remember my
name. . . .

Chris Harris is a senior majoring
in political science. . . . What, do
you expect something witty down
here every week ?
The down side of this is that
occasionally, as the music gets
into the very bottom of that low
end register, the pit track
becomes shorter and shorter, and
distortion can occur and make the
music coarse.
And perhaps most important,
CD players are a much better
piece of hardware than turnta
bles. Whereas turntables are sub
ject to motor speed fluctuation,
rumble, phrase shift in the cir
cuitry, stylus wear and overall
breakdown of a myriad moveable
parts, the digital circuitry in CD
players is less susceptible to tem
perature and aging. The CD itself,

and not the CD player, does most
of the work. It is the data encoded
on the actual CD that controls the
rotating speed of the CD, tracking
and focusing of the laser.
Despite all this, some still say
the kid hasn't matured enough to
assume the full responsibilities of
the music market. But he's still
learning.
In 1877 Thomas Edison invent
ed analog technology using a wax
cylinder covered in tin foil, but it
wasn't until 1948 that the LP
became the standard throughout
the United States. Analog technol
ogy was the reigning monarch for
105 years until the CD was intro
duced, and although some say
analog technology was still evolv
ing, most agree that it had gone
about as far as it could go.

The first prototype CD was
ready in 1979, and it was ready
for mass consumption only three
years later. Ten years after, digi
tal technology has as firm a
foothold in American culture as
sliced bread and canned beer, and
the bottom line is that digital
technology is still in its infancy.
In those 10 years improve
ments have already been made.
Manufacturers have introduced
oversampling, a filtering process
that breaks down those 44,100-
per-second samples of music even
further. Also, most CD players
have an added two laser beams for
better tracking, as well as more
microprocessors to convert the
compressed data with more
finesse.
Finally, recording engineers

and producers have learned that
microphone placement in the
recording studio must be marked
ly different than it is for analog
recordings. Until digital recording
costs come down — one hour of
studio time for digital recording
runs approximately $900, as
opposed to $210 for analog — only
Dire Straits and other major
artists will benefit from improved
digital recording techniques.
And if all of that weren't
enough, get ready because the
new kid on the block has a big
family, and it is going to hit the
market this year.
• DAT: Though demand for the
Digital Audio Tape players was
severely damaged, this will be the
year the market expands the
availability of the DAT players,

blank cassettes and pre-recorded
cassettes. Unfortunately, because
these machines and tapes closely
resemble the technology and for
mat of video-recorders and VHS
tapes, the prices will remain rela
tively high.
• DCC: DATs will get a strong
run for their money when Philips
introduces Digital Compact Cas
settes early this summer. With
the marketing slogan, "almost CD
quality," these new cassettes,
which look like a cross between a
VHS tape, a computer disk and a
regular cassette, encode the music
digitally like CDs, but their play
ers will allow you to play your old
cassettes in them as well. The
tapes are similar to DATs, only
they will be cheaper.
• MD: The most exciting and

disturbing development this year
will be Sony's introduction of the
Mini Compact Disc. Not only will
this CD be able to record, it will be
half the size of current CDs and
will still be able to play up to 75
minutes of music. It was invented
primarily for portable use — boot
legged concerts will reach new lev
els — and has a Shock Proof
Memory that isn't prone to vibra
tion-induced skipping as are cur
rent CDs.
The major downside is that
these 21/2-inch, shell-cased CDs
— they are permanently housed
in a plastic case much like com
puter diskettes — will not be com
patible with current CD players.
Talk about market security.
Like it or not, the child is stand
ing tall and just starting to walk.

ents — gasp! — spanked me as a child) and tout my
comeback on "Larry King Live."
I also want to date other famous people. Famous
people, you see, only go out with other famous peo
ple. If a non-famous guy is attracted to a famous
woman on TV, all he can do is moan wistfully and
maybe buy her wall calendar or work-out video. If
that same poor sod were famous, however, he could
just call her up, take her to dinner, and in no time
they'd have a picture together in People magazine.
If I ever get famous, the first person I'll call is
(heh-heh) that evil Antichrist of fine acting, Julia
Roberts:
"Hey, Jules? This is Chris Harris, from-"
"Omigosh, like, hel-LO! Thank God for YOU!"
"Yeah, uh, thanks, (uncomfortable silence) Hey, I
thought you were really good in "Dying Young." That's
one of my favorite movies. I watch it all the time."
"Really? Why, like, totally fantastic! I'm SO hon
ored!"
"Um . . . (more uncomfortable silence) I was won
dering, if, oh, I dunno, d'wanna, uh, go out some
time to, say, oh I dunno, the Academy Awards cere
mony or somethin'?"
"Oooohmigosh, YES! Like, I'd totally totally
LOVE to, y'know y'know?"
"Yeah, so would I. . . . NOT!" (click)
Apparently, being famous could have it's hang
ups as well.
But I'm not quite there yet. Sure, it's great to see
my face scattered across campus every other Thurs
day, soaking up water around bathroom stalls every
other Friday and staring up en masse out of the recy
cling bins every other Saturday, but all that means
is that people kind of recognize me when they see
me. Thus I get mistaken for all sorts of people when
walking in White Plaza. Some examples:
• "(insert name here)! How've you been since
Freshman English?"
• "Hey, aren't you Flag Boy?"
• "It's Enrico Palazzo!"
• "Could I have your autograph, Mr. — Waaaait,
you're not Jean-Claude Van Damme!"
• "Lies! The non-voters know the truth! We must
band together against the unproductive class!"
Whoops, sorry. That last one was by Crazy Stan
ley, this week's resident White Plaza screwball. He's
as far left as The Stanford Review is right, and
almost as loony.
Last Spring I got the recognition I've been seeking.

In October of this year the compact disc will be 10
years old. And already he owns the playground.
The first CD player was introduced in Japan and
Europe in 1982 in a joint effort between the Dutch
manufacturer Philipps and the Japanese technologi
cal giant Sony. Five months later the first CD player
was introduced in the United States, and along with
it Billy Joel's "52nd Street," the first mass-marketed
pop CD.
That year Americans bought 30,000 CD players
and 800,000 CDs. Today more than 40 million CD
players have been sold in the United States, and con
sumers have bought more than 1 billion CDs. The
American consumer has nurtured the new kid on the
block, and ensured it a happy, healthy adolescence.
Still, childhood was tough. The Analog Gang from
the middle-class long-playing-record neighborhood
hassled the digital kid from the posh CD neighbor
hood mercilessly. He was the definitive product of
the Reagan era; sleek, fun and rich. They said the kid
was too harsh, and had no warmth, no soul.
They said and still say that the CD's high-end reg
ister (the treble) sounds too edgy, too "bright."
Indeed, many classical music recordings reveal a cer
tain edginess, most noticeable when the violins reach
those high-end peaks.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, the low-end
register (the bass) lacks the subtle nuances and
"warmth" of an analog recording. One listen to Miles
Davis' "Kind of Blue" on CD and it's clear that the
LP's certain smoky warmth is not all there.
Supporters of digital technology countered with
the CD's advantages: longer playing time, more infor
mation storage and lower noise distortion, as well as
indexing and programming capabilities. It might be
true that a diamond-tipped needle on a $1,500 car
tridge playing a mint-condition record on a top-of
the-line phonograph could sound better than a CD,

but CDs offered state-of-the-art sound to everyone,
not just the audiophiles who could afford it.
The only "fact" both factions agreed on wat that
the technologies behind analog recording and digital
recording are radically different.
Music is sound, and the electric.>l signal that rep
resents sound is a wave. As the sound gets louder,
the wave trets taller, and as the sound softens, the

wave flattens. With pitch, that wave gets narrower
as the pitch gets higher, and the wave broadens as
the pitch deepens.
Analog recordings trace that wave exactly and
store the information (music) on either a magnetic
tape, for cassettes, or the grooves of an LP. The vari
ations in the width and depth of that groove, which

is approximately the width of a human hair, repre
sent the music's original signal.
Therefore, when John Bonham hit that bass
drum the groove deepened and widened. The left
side of the groove represents the left channel, and
the right side of the groove represents the right
channel. The phonograph needle runs through the
groove, and the cartridge converts the movements
into a signal that is amplified by the stereo.
Digital technology takes that same sound wave
and converts it into a series of binary numbers (ones
and zeros). A digital sample of that sound wave is
taken at a rate of 44,100 times per second per chan
nel and stored as a series of numbers on the CD's
surface in groupings called "data pits."
A laser beam of light then reads these "data pits,"
which under an electron microscope look like circu
lar tracks of raised braille-like bumps, at a rate of
4.3218 million bits per second. Then, microproces
sors inside the CD player change the data back into
sound. There are approximately 3 billion "data pits"
on the surface of any given CD.
Though it might take a rocket scientist to under
stand how CDs work, the advantages over analog
recordings should be clear to everyone.
First, and most obvious, nothing but light ever
touches the surface of the CD. True, CDs aren't as
indestructible as they were first made out to be, and
using them as coasters is risky at best, but they will
never have those annoying snaps, crackles and pops
that are a necessary result of the normal wear and
tear of an LP.
Second, though LPs have lower distortion rates at
the bottom register, the hiss also increases as the
music gets softer because analog recordings cannot
differentiate between sound and music — that is
why every time you dub a cassette the hiss increases.
CDs, on the other hand, read solely those numbers
that carry music, thus eliminating that hiss.

THANK GOD FOR HARRIS!



GB Manriquez —Daily
I wrote a column from Berlin that
mentioned how easy classes were
there. ("No wonder they call it
Over C's studies.") A week later, I
received a letter from the "deputy
director" of the Overseas Program.
It began. "We aren't amused."
He told me, as I sat there skip
ping my language class, that
overseas classes were in fact quite
demanding. Furthermore, my
comments would cause the down
fall of Berlin, the overseas office
and Western Civilization as a
whole if the budget-slashers ever
read it.
I experienced a series of emo
tions while reading:
1) Laughter. Until I realized
the letter was serious. Then:
2) Surprise. If I were one of the
Fusco Brothers, I'd have had at
least three or four exclamation
points over my head. I couldn't
believe that people actually read
and cared about my column. I
almost cried.
3) Confusion. What the hell is
"deputy director," anyway?
Sounds like a cartoon character.
Does he have a real job, or does he
just stand around with a star on
his vest behind the "sheriff direc
tor," drooling from the side of his
mouth and going "Ayup! Ayup!"
every few minutes?
4) Denial, of course. Berlin

was easy, and it wasn't even one
of the easiest programs, com
pared to, say, Florence, where
"nobody has computers so they
pretty much don't assign us
papers here."
Now granted, Firenze (that's
Italian for Florence — "Flo
rence," of course, being the logi
cal English translation) is a beau
tiful city, much more beautiful
than anything even the coast of
France has to offer. As they say,
"With Firenze like this, who
needs any Nice?"
But let's face it: The villa in
Florence is Stanford's best argu
ment against the complaint that
there aren't any housed sorori
ties. Stanford-in-Florence accepts
more Greeks than Italians into
their program.
Anyway, nothing much ever
happened. The Berlin program,
despite the old d.d.'s claims, sud
denly decided it wasn't rigorous
enough and got tougher. I got out
in time, and returned to the rela
tive obscurity of being just anoth
er local columnist with a really
badly cut-out mug shot.
It's comfy, here with my Julia
Roberts wall calendar/dart board.
But someday, I promise, I'll be
giving her a ring, and it won't be
diamond. Baby, remember my
name. . . .

Chris Harris is a senior majoring
in political science. . . . What, do
you expect something witty down
here every week ?
The down side of this is that
occasionally, as the music gets
into the very bottom of that low
end register, the pit track
becomes shorter and shorter, and
distortion can occur and make the
music coarse.
And perhaps most important,
CD players are a much better
piece of hardware than turnta
bles. Whereas turntables are sub
ject to motor speed fluctuation,
rumble, phrase shift in the cir
cuitry, stylus wear and overall
breakdown of a myriad moveable
parts, the digital circuitry in CD
players is less susceptible to tem
perature and aging. The CD itself,

and not the CD player, does most
of the work. It is the data encoded
on the actual CD that controls the
rotating speed of the CD, tracking
and focusing of the laser.
Despite all this, some still say
the kid hasn't matured enough to
assume the full responsibilities of
the music market. But he's still
learning.
In 1877 Thomas Edison invent
ed analog technology using a wax
cylinder covered in tin foil, but it
wasn't until 1948 that the LP
became the standard throughout
the United States. Analog technol
ogy was the reigning monarch for
105 years until the CD was intro
duced, and although some say
analog technology was still evolv
ing, most agree that it had gone
about as far as it could go.

The first prototype CD was
ready in 1979, and it was ready
for mass consumption only three
years later. Ten years after, digi
tal technology has as firm a
foothold in American culture as
sliced bread and canned beer, and
the bottom line is that digital
technology is still in its infancy.
In those 10 years improve
ments have already been made.
Manufacturers have introduced
oversampling, a filtering process
that breaks down those 44,100-
per-second samples of music even
further. Also, most CD players
have an added two laser beams for
better tracking, as well as more
microprocessors to convert the
compressed data with more
finesse.
Finally, recording engineers

and producers have learned that
microphone placement in the
recording studio must be marked
ly different than it is for analog
recordings. Until digital recording
costs come down — one hour of
studio time for digital recording
runs approximately $900, as
opposed to $210 for analog — only
Dire Straits and other major
artists will benefit from improved
digital recording techniques.
And if all of that weren't
enough, get ready because the
new kid on the block has a big
family, and it is going to hit the
market this year.
• DAT: Though demand for the
Digital Audio Tape players was
severely damaged, this will be the
year the market expands the
availability of the DAT players,

blank cassettes and pre-recorded
cassettes. Unfortunately, because
these machines and tapes closely
resemble the technology and for
mat of video-recorders and VHS
tapes, the prices will remain rela
tively high.
• DCC: DATs will get a strong
run for their money when Philips
introduces Digital Compact Cas
settes early this summer. With
the marketing slogan, "almost CD
quality," these new cassettes,
which look like a cross between a
VHS tape, a computer disk and a
regular cassette, encode the music
digitally like CDs, but their play
ers will allow you to play your old
cassettes in them as well. The
tapes are similar to DATs, only
they will be cheaper.
• MD: The most exciting and

disturbing development this year
will be Sony's introduction of the
Mini Compact Disc. Not only will
this CD be able to record, it will be
half the size of current CDs and
will still be able to play up to 75
minutes of music. It was invented
primarily for portable use — boot
legged concerts will reach new lev
els — and has a Shock Proof
Memory that isn't prone to vibra
tion-induced skipping as are cur
rent CDs.
The major downside is that
these 21/2-inch, shell-cased CDs
— they are permanently housed
in a plastic case much like com
puter diskettes — will not be com
patible with current CD players.
Talk about market security.
Like it or not, the child is stand
ing tall and just starting to walk.
I've always wanted to be famous. Real famous.
Not well-they-say-he's-famous-but-frankly-I've
never-heard-of-the-guy famous like your average

alone-scream-and-faint-if-I-saw-him-in-a-supermar-
ket famous like, say, Eugene T. Maleska.
No, I mean really famous. I want Robin Leach
prancing around on my property. I want the tabloids
discussing the Elvis-and-Roseanne-headed big-foot
child I gave birth to. I want to be rich and pompous,

have a few sex scandals, become addicted to cocaine,
gain 230 pounds, get in a horrible motorcycle acci
dent and then miraculously recover from all those
things so I can write an uplifting, inspirational, tell
all autobiography (which also reveals that my par

comeback on "Larry King Live."
I also want to date other famous people. Famous

dering, if, oh, I dunno, d'wanna, uh, go out some
time to, say, oh I dunno, the Academy Awards cere
mony or somethin'?"
"Oooohmigosh, YES! Like, I'd totally totally
LOVE to, y'know y'know?"
"Yeah, so would I. . . . NOT!" (click)
Apparently, being famous could have it's hang
ups as well.
But I'm not quite there yet. Sure, it's great to see
my face scattered across campus every other Thurs
day, soaking up water around bathroom stalls every
other Friday and staring up en masse out of the recy
cling bins every other Saturday, but all that means
is that people kind of recognize me when they see
me. Thus I get mistaken for all sorts of people when
walking in White Plaza. Some examples:
• "(insert name here)! How've you been since
Freshman English?"
• "Hey, aren't you Flag Boy?"
• "It's Enrico Palazzo!"
• "Could I have your autograph, Mr. — Waaaait,
you're not Jean-Claude Van Damme!"
• "Lies! The non-voters know the truth! We must
band together against the unproductive class!"
Whoops, sorry. That last one was by Crazy Stan
ley, this week's resident White Plaza screwball. He's
as far left as The Stanford Review is right, and
almost as loony.
Last Spring I got the recognition I've been seeking.

In October of this year the compact disc will be 10
years old. And already he owns the playground.
The first CD player was introduced in Japan and
Europe in 1982 in a joint effort between the Dutch
manufacturer Philipps and the Japanese technologi
cal giant Sony. Five months later the first CD player
was introduced in the United States, and along with
it Billy Joel's "52nd Street," the first mass-marketed
pop CD.
That year Americans bought 30,000 CD players
and 800,000 CDs. Today more than 40 million CD
players have been sold in the United States, and con
sumers have bought more than 1 billion CDs. The
American consumer has nurtured the new kid on the
block, and ensured it a happy, healthy adolescence.
Still, childhood was tough. The Analog Gang from
the middle-class long-playing-record neighborhood
hassled the digital kid from the posh CD neighbor
hood mercilessly. He was the definitive product of
the Reagan era; sleek, fun and rich. They said the kid
was too harsh, and had no warmth, no soul.
They said and still say that the CD's high-end reg
ister (the treble) sounds too edgy, too "bright."
Indeed, many classical music recordings reveal a cer
tain edginess, most noticeable when the violins reach
those high-end peaks.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, the low-end
register (the bass) lacks the subtle nuances and
"warmth" of an analog recording. One listen to Miles
Davis' "Kind of Blue" on CD and it's clear that the
LP's certain smoky warmth is not all there.
Supporters of digital technology countered with
the CD's advantages: longer playing time, more infor
mation storage and lower noise distortion, as well as
indexing and programming capabilities. It might be
true that a diamond-tipped needle on a $1,500 car
tridge playing a mint-condition record on a top-of
the-line phonograph could sound better than a CD,

but CDs offered state-of-the-art sound to everyone,
not just the audiophiles who could afford it.
The only "fact" both factions agreed on wat that
the technologies behind analog recording and digital
recording are radically different.
Music is sound, and the electric.>l signal that rep
resents sound is a wave. As the sound gets louder,
the wave trets taller, and as the sound softens, the

wave flattens. With pitch, that wave gets narrower
as the pitch gets higher, and the wave broadens as
the pitch deepens.
Analog recordings trace that wave exactly and
store the information (music) on either a magnetic
tape, for cassettes, or the grooves of an LP. The vari
ations in the width and depth of that groove, which

is approximately the width of a human hair, repre
sent the music's original signal.
Therefore, when John Bonham hit that bass
drum the groove deepened and widened. The left
side of the groove represents the left channel, and
the right side of the groove represents the right
channel. The phonograph needle runs through the
groove, and the cartridge converts the movements
into a signal that is amplified by the stereo.
Digital technology takes that same sound wave
and converts it into a series of binary numbers (ones
and zeros). A digital sample of that sound wave is
taken at a rate of 44,100 times per second per chan
nel and stored as a series of numbers on the CD's
surface in groupings called "data pits."
A laser beam of light then reads these "data pits,"
which under an electron microscope look like circu
lar tracks of raised braille-like bumps, at a rate of
4.3218 million bits per second. Then, microproces
sors inside the CD player change the data back into
sound. There are approximately 3 billion "data pits"
on the surface of any given CD.
Though it might take a rocket scientist to under
stand how CDs work, the advantages over analog
recordings should be clear to everyone.
First, and most obvious, nothing but light ever
touches the surface of the CD. True, CDs aren't as
indestructible as they were first made out to be, and
using them as coasters is risky at best, but they will
never have those annoying snaps, crackles and pops
that are a necessary result of the normal wear and
tear of an LP.
Second, though LPs have lower distortion rates at
the bottom register, the hiss also increases as the
music gets softer because analog recordings cannot
differentiate between sound and music — that is
why every time you dub a cassette the hiss increases.
CDs, on the other hand, read solely those numbers
that carry music, thus eliminating that hiss.

THANK GOD FOR HARRIS!



GB Manriquez —Daily
I wrote a column from Berlin that
mentioned how easy classes were
there. ("No wonder they call it
Over C's studies.") A week later, I
received a letter from the "deputy
director" of the Overseas Program.
It began. "We aren't amused."
He told me, as I sat there skip
ping my language class, that
overseas classes were in fact quite
demanding. Furthermore, my
comments would cause the down
fall of Berlin, the overseas office
and Western Civilization as a
whole if the budget-slashers ever
read it.
I experienced a series of emo
tions while reading:
1) Laughter. Until I realized
the letter was serious. Then:
2) Surprise. If I were one of the
Fusco Brothers, I'd have had at
least three or four exclamation
points over my head. I couldn't
believe that people actually read
and cared about my column. I
almost cried.
3) Confusion. What the hell is
"deputy director," anyway?
Sounds like a cartoon character.
Does he have a real job, or does he
just stand around with a star on
his vest behind the "sheriff direc
tor," drooling from the side of his
mouth and going "Ayup! Ayup!"
every few minutes?
4) Denial, of course. Berlin

was easy, and it wasn't even one
of the easiest programs, com
pared to, say, Florence, where
"nobody has computers so they
pretty much don't assign us
papers here."
Now granted, Firenze (that's
Italian for Florence — "Flo
rence," of course, being the logi
cal English translation) is a beau
tiful city, much more beautiful
than anything even the coast of
France has to offer. As they say,
"With Firenze like this, who
needs any Nice?"
But let's face it: The villa in
Florence is Stanford's best argu
ment against the complaint that
there aren't any housed sorori
ties. Stanford-in-Florence accepts
more Greeks than Italians into
their program.
Anyway, nothing much ever
happened. The Berlin program,
despite the old d.d.'s claims, sud
denly decided it wasn't rigorous
enough and got tougher. I got out
in time, and returned to the rela
tive obscurity of being just anoth
er local columnist with a really
badly cut-out mug shot.
It's comfy, here with my Julia
Roberts wall calendar/dart board.
But someday, I promise, I'll be
giving her a ring, and it won't be
diamond. Baby, remember my
name. . . .

Chris Harris is a senior majoring
in political science. . . . What, do
you expect something witty down
here every week ?
The down side of this is that
occasionally, as the music gets
into the very bottom of that low
end register, the pit track
becomes shorter and shorter, and
distortion can occur and make the
music coarse.
And perhaps most important,
CD players are a much better
piece of hardware than turnta
bles. Whereas turntables are sub
ject to motor speed fluctuation,
rumble, phrase shift in the cir
cuitry, stylus wear and overall
breakdown of a myriad moveable
parts, the digital circuitry in CD
players is less susceptible to tem
perature and aging. The CD itself,

and not the CD player, does most
of the work. It is the data encoded
on the actual CD that controls the
rotating speed of the CD, tracking
and focusing of the laser.
Despite all this, some still say
the kid hasn't matured enough to
assume the full responsibilities of
the music market. But he's still
learning.
In 1877 Thomas Edison invent
ed analog technology using a wax
cylinder covered in tin foil, but it
wasn't until 1948 that the LP
became the standard throughout
the United States. Analog technol
ogy was the reigning monarch for
105 years until the CD was intro
duced, and although some say
analog technology was still evolv
ing, most agree that it had gone
about as far as it could go.

The first prototype CD was
ready in 1979, and it was ready
for mass consumption only three
years later. Ten years after, digi
tal technology has as firm a
foothold in American culture as
sliced bread and canned beer, and
the bottom line is that digital
technology is still in its infancy.
In those 10 years improve
ments have already been made.
Manufacturers have introduced
oversampling, a filtering process
that breaks down those 44,100-
per-second samples of music even
further. Also, most CD players
have an added two laser beams for
better tracking, as well as more
microprocessors to convert the
compressed data with more
finesse.
Finally, recording engineers

and producers have learned that
microphone placement in the
recording studio must be marked
ly different than it is for analog
recordings. Until digital recording
costs come down — one hour of
studio time for digital recording
runs approximately $900, as
opposed to $210 for analog — only
Dire Straits and other major
artists will benefit from improved
digital recording techniques.
And if all of that weren't
enough, get ready because the
new kid on the block has a big
family, and it is going to hit the
market this year.
• DAT: Though demand for the
Digital Audio Tape players was
severely damaged, this will be the
year the market expands the
availability of the DAT players,

blank cassettes and pre-recorded
cassettes. Unfortunately, because
these machines and tapes closely
resemble the technology and for
mat of video-recorders and VHS
tapes, the prices will remain rela
tively high.
• DCC: DATs will get a strong
run for their money when Philips
introduces Digital Compact Cas
settes early this summer. With
the marketing slogan, "almost CD
quality," these new cassettes,
which look like a cross between a
VHS tape, a computer disk and a
regular cassette, encode the music
digitally like CDs, but their play
ers will allow you to play your old
cassettes in them as well. The
tapes are similar to DATs, only
they will be cheaper.
• MD: The most exciting and

disturbing development this year
will be Sony's introduction of the
Mini Compact Disc. Not only will
this CD be able to record, it will be
half the size of current CDs and
will still be able to play up to 75
minutes of music. It was invented
primarily for portable use — boot
legged concerts will reach new lev
els — and has a Shock Proof
Memory that isn't prone to vibra
tion-induced skipping as are cur
rent CDs.
The major downside is that
these 21/2-inch, shell-cased CDs
— they are permanently housed
in a plastic case much like com
puter diskettes — will not be com
patible with current CD players.
Talk about market security.
Like it or not, the child is stand
ing tall and just starting to walk.
I've always wanted to be famous. Real famous.
Not well-they-say-he's-famous-but-frankly-I've
never-heard-of-the-guy famous like your average
Stanford Commencement speaker; not once-popu
lar-but-now-robbing-convenience-stores, former
'7os-child-star brand of famous; not even pretty
famous-but-I-wouldn't-exactly-recognize-him-let-
alone-scream-and-faint-if-I-saw-him-in-a-supermar-
ket famous like, say, Eugene T. Maleska.
No, I mean really famous. I want Robin Leach
prancing around on my property. I want the tabloids
discussing the Elvis-and-Roseanne-headed big-foot
child I gave birth to. I want to be rich and pompous,

have a few sex scandals, become addicted to cocaine,
gain 230 pounds, get in a horrible motorcycle acci
dent and then miraculously recover from all those
things so I can write an uplifting, inspirational, tell
all autobiography (which also reveals that my par
ents — gasp! — spanked me as a child) and tout my
comeback on "Larry King Live."
I also want to date other famous people. Famous
people, you see, only go out with other famous peo
ple. If a non-famous guy is attracted to a famous
woman on TV, all he can do is moan wistfully and
maybe buy her wall calendar or work-out video. If
that same poor sod were famous, however, he could
just call her up, take her to dinner, and in no time
they'd have a picture together in People magazine.
If I ever get famous, the first person I'll call is
(heh-heh) that evil Antichrist of fine acting, Julia
Roberts:
"Hey, Jules? This is Chris Harris, from-"
"Omigosh, like, hel-LO! Thank God for YOU!"
"Yeah, uh, thanks, (uncomfortable silence) Hey, I
thought you were really good in "Dying Young." That's
one of my favorite movies. I watch it all the time."
"Really? Why, like, totally fantastic! I'm SO hon
ored!"
"Um . . . (more uncomfortable silence) I was won
dering, if, oh, I dunno, d'wanna, uh, go out some
time to, say, oh I dunno, the Academy Awards cere
mony or somethin'?"
"Oooohmigosh, YES! Like, I'd totally totally

Last Spring I got the recognition I've been seeking.

In October of this year the compact disc will be 10
years old. And already he owns the playground.
The first CD player was introduced in Japan and
Europe in 1982 in a joint effort between the Dutch
manufacturer Philipps and the Japanese technologi
cal giant Sony. Five months later the first CD player
was introduced in the United States, and along with
it Billy Joel's "52nd Street," the first mass-marketed
pop CD.
That year Americans bought 30,000 CD players
and 800,000 CDs. Today more than 40 million CD
players have been sold in the United States, and con
sumers have bought more than 1 billion CDs. The
American consumer has nurtured the new kid on the
block, and ensured it a happy, healthy adolescence.
Still, childhood was tough. The Analog Gang from
the middle-class long-playing-record neighborhood
hassled the digital kid from the posh CD neighbor
hood mercilessly. He was the definitive product of
the Reagan era; sleek, fun and rich. They said the kid
was too harsh, and had no warmth, no soul.
They said and still say that the CD's high-end reg
ister (the treble) sounds too edgy, too "bright."
Indeed, many classical music recordings reveal a cer
tain edginess, most noticeable when the violins reach
those high-end peaks.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, the low-end
register (the bass) lacks the subtle nuances and
"warmth" of an analog recording. One listen to Miles
Davis' "Kind of Blue" on CD and it's clear that the
LP's certain smoky warmth is not all there.
Supporters of digital technology countered with
the CD's advantages: longer playing time, more infor
mation storage and lower noise distortion, as well as
indexing and programming capabilities. It might be
true that a diamond-tipped needle on a $1,500 car
tridge playing a mint-condition record on a top-of
the-line phonograph could sound better than a CD,

but CDs offered state-of-the-art sound to everyone,
not just the audiophiles who could afford it.
The only "fact" both factions agreed on wat that
the technologies behind analog recording and digital
recording are radically different.
Music is sound, and the electric.>l signal that rep
resents sound is a wave. As the sound gets louder,
the wave trets taller, and as the sound softens, the

wave flattens. With pitch, that wave gets narrower
as the pitch gets higher, and the wave broadens as
the pitch deepens.
Analog recordings trace that wave exactly and
store the information (music) on either a magnetic
tape, for cassettes, or the grooves of an LP. The vari
ations in the width and depth of that groove, which

is approximately the width of a human hair, repre
sent the music's original signal.
Therefore, when John Bonham hit that bass
drum the groove deepened and widened. The left
side of the groove represents the left channel, and
the right side of the groove represents the right
channel. The phonograph needle runs through the
groove, and the cartridge converts the movements
into a signal that is amplified by the stereo.
Digital technology takes that same sound wave
and converts it into a series of binary numbers (ones
and zeros). A digital sample of that sound wave is
taken at a rate of 44,100 times per second per chan
nel and stored as a series of numbers on the CD's
surface in groupings called "data pits."
A laser beam of light then reads these "data pits,"
which under an electron microscope look like circu
lar tracks of raised braille-like bumps, at a rate of
4.3218 million bits per second. Then, microproces
sors inside the CD player change the data back into
sound. There are approximately 3 billion "data pits"
on the surface of any given CD.
Though it might take a rocket scientist to under
stand how CDs work, the advantages over analog
recordings should be clear to everyone.
First, and most obvious, nothing but light ever
touches the surface of the CD. True, CDs aren't as
indestructible as they were first made out to be, and
using them as coasters is risky at best, but they will
never have those annoying snaps, crackles and pops
that are a necessary result of the normal wear and
tear of an LP.
Second, though LPs have lower distortion rates at
the bottom register, the hiss also increases as the
music gets softer because analog recordings cannot
differentiate between sound and music — that is
why every time you dub a cassette the hiss increases.
CDs, on the other hand, read solely those numbers
that carry music, thus eliminating that hiss.

THANK GOD FOR HARRIS!



GB Manriquez —Daily
I wrote a column from Berlin that
mentioned how easy classes were
there. ("No wonder they call it
Over C's studies.") A week later, I
received a letter from the "deputy
director" of the Overseas Program.
It began. "We aren't amused."
He told me, as I sat there skip
ping my language class, that
overseas classes were in fact quite
demanding. Furthermore, my
comments would cause the down
fall of Berlin, the overseas office
and Western Civilization as a
whole if the budget-slashers ever
read it.
I experienced a series of emo
tions while reading:
1) Laughter. Until I realized
the letter was serious. Then:
2) Surprise. If I were one of the
Fusco Brothers, I'd have had at
least three or four exclamation
points over my head. I couldn't
believe that people actually read
and cared about my column. I
almost cried.
3) Confusion. What the hell is
"deputy director," anyway?
Sounds like a cartoon character.
Does he have a real job, or does he
just stand around with a star on
his vest behind the "sheriff direc
tor," drooling from the side of his
mouth and going "Ayup! Ayup!"
every few minutes?
4) Denial, of course. Berlin

was easy, and it wasn't even one
of the easiest programs, com
pared to, say, Florence, where
"nobody has computers so they
pretty much don't assign us
papers here."
Now granted, Firenze (that's
Italian for Florence — "Flo
rence," of course, being the logi
cal English translation) is a beau
tiful city, much more beautiful
than anything even the coast of
France has to offer. As they say,
"With Firenze like this, who
needs any Nice?"
But let's face it: The villa in
Florence is Stanford's best argu
ment against the complaint that
there aren't any housed sorori
ties. Stanford-in-Florence accepts
more Greeks than Italians into
their program.
Anyway, nothing much ever
happened. The Berlin program,
despite the old d.d.'s claims, sud
denly decided it wasn't rigorous
enough and got tougher. I got out
in time, and returned to the rela
tive obscurity of being just anoth
er local columnist with a really
badly cut-out mug shot.
It's comfy, here with my Julia
Roberts wall calendar/dart board.
But someday, I promise, I'll be
giving her a ring, and it won't be
diamond. Baby, remember my
name. . . .

Chris Harris is a senior majoring
in political science. . . . What, do
you expect something witty down
here every week ?
The down side of this is that
occasionally, as the music gets
into the very bottom of that low
end register, the pit track
becomes shorter and shorter, and
distortion can occur and make the
music coarse.
And perhaps most important,
CD players are a much better
piece of hardware than turnta
bles. Whereas turntables are sub
ject to motor speed fluctuation,
rumble, phrase shift in the cir
cuitry, stylus wear and overall
breakdown of a myriad moveable
parts, the digital circuitry in CD
players is less susceptible to tem
perature and aging. The CD itself,

and not the CD player, does most
of the work. It is the data encoded
on the actual CD that controls the
rotating speed of the CD, tracking
and focusing of the laser.
Despite all this, some still say
the kid hasn't matured enough to
assume the full responsibilities of
the music market. But he's still
learning.
In 1877 Thomas Edison invent
ed analog technology using a wax
cylinder covered in tin foil, but it
wasn't until 1948 that the LP
became the standard throughout
the United States. Analog technol
ogy was the reigning monarch for
105 years until the CD was intro
duced, and although some say
analog technology was still evolv
ing, most agree that it had gone
about as far as it could go.

The first prototype CD was
ready in 1979, and it was ready
for mass consumption only three
years later. Ten years after, digi
tal technology has as firm a
foothold in American culture as
sliced bread and canned beer, and
the bottom line is that digital
technology is still in its infancy.
In those 10 years improve
ments have already been made.
Manufacturers have introduced
oversampling, a filtering process
that breaks down those 44,100-
per-second samples of music even
further. Also, most CD players
have an added two laser beams for
better tracking, as well as more
microprocessors to convert the
compressed data with more
finesse.
Finally, recording engineers

and producers have learned that
microphone placement in the
recording studio must be marked
ly different than it is for analog
recordings. Until digital recording
costs come down — one hour of
studio time for digital recording
runs approximately $900, as
opposed to $210 for analog — only
Dire Straits and other major
artists will benefit from improved
digital recording techniques.
And if all of that weren't
enough, get ready because the
new kid on the block has a big
family, and it is going to hit the
market this year.
• DAT: Though demand for the
Digital Audio Tape players was
severely damaged, this will be the
year the market expands the
availability of the DAT players,

blank cassettes and pre-recorded
cassettes. Unfortunately, because
these machines and tapes closely
resemble the technology and for
mat of video-recorders and VHS
tapes, the prices will remain rela
tively high.
• DCC: DATs will get a strong
run for their money when Philips
introduces Digital Compact Cas
settes early this summer. With
the marketing slogan, "almost CD
quality," these new cassettes,
which look like a cross between a
VHS tape, a computer disk and a
regular cassette, encode the music
digitally like CDs, but their play
ers will allow you to play your old
cassettes in them as well. The
tapes are similar to DATs, only
they will be cheaper.
• MD: The most exciting and

disturbing development this year
will be Sony's introduction of the
Mini Compact Disc. Not only will
this CD be able to record, it will be
half the size of current CDs and
will still be able to play up to 75
minutes of music. It was invented
primarily for portable use — boot
legged concerts will reach new lev
els — and has a Shock Proof
Memory that isn't prone to vibra
tion-induced skipping as are cur
rent CDs.
The major downside is that
these 21/2-inch, shell-cased CDs
— they are permanently housed
in a plastic case much like com
puter diskettes — will not be com
patible with current CD players.
Talk about market security.
Like it or not, the child is stand
ing tall and just starting to walk.
I've always wanted to be famous. Real famous.
Not well-they-say-he's-famous-but-frankly-I've
never-heard-of-the-guy famous like your average
Stanford Commencement speaker; not once-popu
lar-but-now-robbing-convenience-stores, former
'7os-child-star brand of famous; not even pretty
famous-but-I-wouldn't-exactly-recognize-him-let-
alone-scream-and-faint-if-I-saw-him-in-a-supermar-
ket famous like, say, Eugene T. Maleska.
No, I mean really famous. I want Robin Leach
prancing around on my property. I want the tabloids
discussing the Elvis-and-Roseanne-headed big-foot
child I gave birth to. I want to be rich and pompous,

have a few sex scandals, become addicted to cocaine,
gain 230 pounds, get in a horrible motorcycle acci
dent and then miraculously recover from all those
things so I can write an uplifting, inspirational, tell
all autobiography (which also reveals that my par
ents — gasp! — spanked me as a child) and tout my
comeback on "Larry King Live."
I also want to date other famous people. Famous
people, you see, only go out with other famous peo
ple. If a non-famous guy is attracted to a famous
woman on TV, all he can do is moan wistfully and
maybe buy her wall calendar or work-out video. If
that same poor sod were famous, however, he could
just call her up, take her to dinner, and in no time
they'd have a picture together in People magazine.
If I ever get famous, the first person I'll call is
(heh-heh) that evil Antichrist of fine acting, Julia
Roberts:
"Hey, Jules? This is Chris Harris, from-"
"Omigosh, like, hel-LO! Thank God for YOU!"
"Yeah, uh, thanks, (uncomfortable silence) Hey, I
thought you were really good in "Dying Young." That's
one of my favorite movies. I watch it all the time."
"Really? Why, like, totally fantastic! I'm SO hon
ored!"
"Um . . . (more uncomfortable silence) I was won
dering, if, oh, I dunno, d'wanna, uh, go out some
time to, say, oh I dunno, the Academy Awards cere
mony or somethin'?"
"Oooohmigosh, YES! Like, I'd totally totally
LOVE to, y'know y'know?"
"Yeah, so would I. . . . NOT!" (click)
Apparently, being famous could have it's hang
ups as well.
But I'm not quite there yet. Sure, it's great to see
my face scattered across campus every other Thurs
day, soaking up water around bathroom stalls every
other Friday and staring up en masse out of the recy
cling bins every other Saturday, but all that means
is that people kind of recognize me when they see
me. Thus I get mistaken for all sorts of people when
walking in White Plaza. Some examples:
• "(insert name here)! How've you been since
Freshman English?"
• "Hey, aren't you Flag Boy?"
• "It's Enrico Palazzo!"
• "Could I have your autograph, Mr. — Waaaait,
you're not Jean-Claude Van Damme!"
• "Lies! The non-voters know the truth! We must
band together against the unproductive class!"
Whoops, sorry. That last one was by Crazy Stan
ley, this week's resident White Plaza screwball. He's
as far left as The Stanford Review is right, and
almost as loony.
