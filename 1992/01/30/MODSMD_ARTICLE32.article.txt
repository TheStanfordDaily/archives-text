# Learning Italian and stuffing your face
## 
### Chris Harris Staff writer 
Most every Saturday night, members of
Casa Italiana transform their dining room
into a cozy, low-lit restaurant called "La Pizze
ria," which means, roughly, "The Pizzeria."
La Pizzeria's specialty is, of course, "pizza,"
which is Italian for pizza. None of that Domi
no's crud, however. This is the real European
kind, complete with thin, homemade crust and
a traditional variety of toppings.
Our waiter, a hearty Italian named
Giuseppe 4 ("Joseph"), brushed back his flow
ing locks of hair that recalled grape vines of
the very gods themselves and beckoned us to
our table. All sorts of students were packed
into this comfy arena, especially the
granola/self-op/damn-I-look-cool-with-this
goatee crowd.
Now let's get this straight now. Goatees are
not cool. Goatee equals goofee. Women don't
dig 'em, kid. They're laughing at you behind
your back. So stop trying to be original like
every other guy — just shave the damn hairs
off your chinny-chin-chin and get it over with.
In the corner, a student jazzed up the

evening on the piano. He was playing the
theme to "All in the Family" when we sat
down. I wasn't sure if this was a reference to
the mafia or not.
Wine ("Vino") bottles with candles lit our
table — it was the closest we'd get to alcohol in
this joint. Otherwise, the water served in sus
piciously Food Service-esque glasses would
have to do.
I started with a "salate," which means
salad, and a "Coke," which is a Coke. At the
waiter's suggestion, we also ordered the "Pane
d'aglio con Formaggio Fuso," which pretty
much speaks for itself. Everything was delicio
("delicious"). It was also free, because I
promised them I'd write a glowing review
("fulla crapo"), but I'd have enjoyed it even if I
were one of you lowly paying customers.
All sorts of Pizze Speciali ("Special Pizzas")
are available, from the Pizza Napolitana
("Neapolitan Pizza") to the Pizza IMMENSA
(served only to those with IQs over 135).
Ah, was it fun for a while. "More water!" we
called ("Aquo moro!"), and another round —
no charge! — was brought to us Alas, the
father-like bonding with our waiter ("bondo
Brando") was not to last much longer. In a

major "fauxo-pasa" ("faux-pas" — "stupid
move"), I ordered French dressing with my
salad. Big mistake.
"Franco?" he asked, astonished. I told him
he must be mistaking me for someone else. He
brought his hand in front of his mouth and
motioned something in my direction, then
stalked off to the kitchen, muttering strange
phrases under his breath and tearing at his
exposed chest hair, the locks of which also
recalled grape vines of the very gods them
selves.
So grab a group and hit La Casa Italiana
some Saturday. Be sure to make reservations
— this place can get crowded. Live music is a
regular attraction, so er\joy. Watch for the res
ident fellow's group of real Italian friends in
the corner.
Hopefully, this clever little plan will
catch on among other theme dorms. Haus
Mitt could tempt our tummies with "Das
Wurst-und-Krauthaus." The Taxis could
host "The Live Goldfish" seafood restau
rant. And the Enchanted Broccoli Forest, of
course, would sponsor "The Broccoli Joint"
— or maybe they'd skip the broccoli and
just have joints.
