# Killing friends and feeling fine
## 
### Mark Byer 
The scenario: It is 0730
hours, and you are awake and
dressed for the day's combat.
At 0900 you arrive at the bat
tlefield, nervous and excited like
all of the other new recruits.
Instructions are given and battle
plans are drawn. Welcome to
paint-pellet combat, a.k.a. Faint
war.
It is dorm against dorm,
roommate against roommate —
an all-out war. The armory dis
penses the safety equipment, a
pair of clean goggles and a mask
that gives even the most beauti
ful person in the group a skull
like appearance.
This is war, after all, and so
weapon choice is critical. Tech
nological upgrades are offered at
a price. Your battalion pitches in
money to buy a case of paint, giv
ing each of you 80 shots in addi
tion to the 20 already issued. For
the new recruit, ammunition is a
valuable resource — 150 to 200
shots is average. You are loaded,
and with your goggles pressing
firmly against your face, you
head to the prewar briefing.
At this briefing, you learn
how to surrender, check for bat
tle-hits and how to win ... by
capturing the enemy's flag.
Sometimes, five minutes into the
game your teammate becomes
your enemy as he reveals himself
as one of the free-for-all assas
sins, killing indiscriminately.
You and your team assemble
at your respective flag stations
and divide yourselves into
squads. The mission is simple: to
capture the flag. The tactics are
well-coordinated. Squad one will
defend the flag by hiding behind
those fallen logs; squad two will
flank left and press behind in an
attempt to take the flag and run
it back; the third squad will
press straight forward in a line
about 10 feet apart, using trees

and small ditches as cover; the
few extras will go kamikaze in an
attempt to baffle and confuse the
enemy. The battle will last for 15
minutes. . . .
. . . and you die after five. A
fatal shot in the chest spreads
blue liquid across your shirt, and
with your hands in the air you
walk into the killed zone to
watch the rest of the battle.
Many such battles later your
tally is five shots taken, two kills
and one flag almost yours. You
have been killed more times than
you have killed. Your team is in
dire straights, with only two
more battles before the war is
decided. The red army assembles
with a battle-weary look of
sweat-streaked dirt, coating the
die-hard spirits inside.
"We have suffered many loss
es," Gen. Ethan Diamond says.
"The yellow side has been deci
mating us since the brief
armistice for lunch, and now it is
time for us to win."
You decide on a quick and
simple strategy. The entire red
side will march in a front toward
the enemy flag. One minute
before the start of this battle you
are still breathing hard from the
last one.
The whistle blows and your
army of 15 spreads out into a
line and begins advancing. In a
daring flash, you flank behind
the enemy's lines and begin
shooting at the now wide-open
yellows. One by one, they raise
their guns in the air and shout
"Hit!" as blue paint streaks
across their backs.
Eight kills later, you have
completely annihilated the yel
low side, and the red front quick
ly advances to the yellow flag
station where the remaining yel
lows are holed-up in defense.
Here, you are dealt a fatal blow
in the temple. This battle is no
longer yours to fight.
The war is over. Like any war,

there were no winners in this
game, only lessons to be learned.
Recalling war-stories like sea
soned veterans in the boot-camp
mess, a.k.a. Florence Moore din
ing hall, you realize that in a real
war you would have been dead
from the beginning. Two shots in
the chest, one in the shoulder, a

direct hit on the elbow and two
glancing blows at the temple —
no soldier could survive such hits.
Paintwar offers a chance to
play soldier for a day. I would
definitely play again for the exer
cise and adrenaline rush, always
knowing that a real war is
infinitely more painful.
