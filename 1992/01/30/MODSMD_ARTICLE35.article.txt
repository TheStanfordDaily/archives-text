# Sexual movements on campus?
## Dancers bring short-term relief to prudish campus 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
Tomorrow and Saturday at 8 p.m., the stage of
Memorial Auditorium will erupt in a vivid display of
motion and sexuality.
As part of the Lively Arts Program, the Hubbard
Street Dance Company, a modern dance troupe, is
scheduled to appear and entertain the Stanford com
munity. The company will perform to music from
the coolest blues to the most sizzling tangos in an
array of bodies and lights.
Hubbard Street combines the minds and talents
of three renown choreographers in order to intro
duce the audience to an amalgamation of theatrical
jazz, modern dance and classical ballet technique.
This performance is perfect for connoisseurs and
Al Bundys alike. Choreographers Danny Ezralow,
Margo Sappington and Twyla Tharp all have proven
themselves as innovators in the field.
In the 1970s Sappington choreographed the hit
Broadway musical "Oh, Calcutta" â€” infamous for
being the first show performed entirely in the nude.
For tomorrow's show Sappington contributes a
steamy piece, Cobras in the Moonlight, that pushes
the boundaries of sensuality. "It's an awesome
explosion of movement and energy," according to
Lively Arts Asst. Director of Publicity Phil
O'Shaughnessy. "It plays on the bodies of the
dancers."
Tharp has created more than 80 dances, working
in the fields of dance, film, television, video and the
atre. Her films include "Hair" (1978), the Academy
Award winning "Amadeus" (1984) and the popular
"White Nights" (1985) with Mikhail Baryshnikov.

tomorrow's performance, features original music by
David Byrne of the Talking Heads.
In his repertoire, Ezralow has works previously
presented for "La Fete de L'Humanite" in Paris,
Deutche Opera in Berlin, Batsheva Dance Company
in Israel, the London Contemporary Dance Theatre
and the Paris Opera Ballet.
O'Shaughnessy suggested that students without
cars capitalize on this opportunity to invite that cer
tain someone out. "Dare I propose a possible date for
people?" he asked.
For those students who have never seen a ballet
performance before, O'Shaughnessy had this to say,
"Turn off your left brain, turn on your right brain
and just experience it."

Fifteen minutes before the show, student rush prices
are available from $8-$l2 depending on the seating
section. Otherwise tickets can be purchased at
Tresidder Ticket Office for twice these prices.
