# Thank God for hairs: a look at all the president's men
## 
### Chris Harris Staff writer 
But forsooth, what can a poor
male (or adventurous female) do
when his mop starts to flop over
the top? You can grease it (Fonz),
braid it (Pippi), pull it back (Bono)
or push it up (Yahoo), but when it
comes to dealing with long hair,
every guy soon reaches the same
conclusion: A man's comb is his
hassle.
Which leaves us with two
options: dreadlocks and haircuts.
The first requires no time, no
money, no waiting and no daily
styling, and looks just as good six
months later. Naturally, most
choose the other.
So where can you go? It was so
tough leaving Joe/Tony/Frank
back home. Sure, you heard the
same dumb jokes and raunchy
military stories every time, but
there was something to it. It was
home. Is there any place like that
around?
No. But President's comes
close.
From the moment you step
into President's Barber Shop on

University Avenue, you can tell
you've hit an honest, down-home
barber shop. All the signs ure
there. Puke green chairs. Oodles
of combs stuffed into dirty glasses
of four-month old water. Four
gentlemen, two ancient, dressed
in snazzy clothes that were proba
bly hip sometime during the Pale
olithic Age. A lineup of older, bald
men waiting for haircuts they
don't even need. And of course the
Playboys under the television set.
Sure, none of the barbers are
named Joe or Tony, but it seems
they have it all.
But can they cut hair? This
investigative report cracks that
story wide open. During a recent
four-month period, I sacrificed
four afternoons, $48 (not includ
ing the hat I had to buy) and at
least one month of social rejection
because my hair looked goony, in
order to find out.
Anyway, here is the fruit of my
labor, a barber-by-barber report
on . . . all the President's men:
• Roy, a veteran of this estab
lishment, is a nightmare. They
put him closest to the window so
potential customers can see his

Wait around 'til
there aren't any
women or chil
dren in the
shop, then lis
ten. Hoo-boy.

work; thus overcrowding is kept
down. It's not that he's bad, it's
just that he does hair only one
way: short. Short on the sides.
Short on the back. Short up top.
But I'm giving you the impres
sion that he cuts it evenly.
Consider him the Kentucky
Fried Chicken of barbers: He does
just one thing, but boy does he do
it. Ask him to leave the tail, and
he'll leave it — on the floor. The
worst possible thing you can tell
Roy is, "I think I'd like it short
today." Then he gets this wild,
evil look in his eyes, starts laugh
ing maniacally, breaks out the

hedge-clippers and goes to town,
shaving chunks here and there
until you come out looking like
Kojak.
To top it all off, Roy is at least a
month behind his co-workers on
the joke-circulation circuit. You can
hear Carlos tell a joke during one
visit, and catch it from Roy during
the next. He was still running
through his Saddam Hussein mate
rial when I last listened to him.
Gosh, that haircut was rough.
Sure, I could have gotten a hair
piece to cover up the bad cutting
job, but if it didn't look real, then
I would've had hell toupee.
• Moe is next in line. It's not a
good name for a barber, really,
bringing up images of unwieldy
lawn-cutting instruments. But
any man named after one of the
Three Stooges earns respect in
my book, especially when, as a
barber, he doesn't sport the same
haircut as his namesake. I sat
down, told him what I wanted,
and he went to work, doing every
thing fine for a while, until he for
got what I'd said and just cut
everything.
Quiet, humble and likable to a
fault, Moe has one small problem:
severe cluelessness. At one point,
I mentioned to him that I had
been in Berlin not too long ago.
"Oh ..." he breathed to me
like some Peter Lorre imperson
ator. "What a great time to be
there. . . . Oh ... So much hap
pening. ..."
"Yeah," I replied. "Berlin was a
fantastic experience," throwing
out my generic six-months-of-my
life-in-a-sentence line.
"Yes, I'm sure. . . . Now, do you
know Russian?" Wham. Game
over, man. Thank you for playing.
If Roy is KFC, then Moe is like
Taco Bell. Seems nice enough
from afar, but inside it's all mush.
• Young, bearded, jocular,
nubile Carlos is the third barber
in. This man provides the energy
of the shop. Without him, the
other three would wither away,
repeating the same jokes more
and more slowly until they just
fell forward singing "Daaaaaai
isssyyyyy ..."
Carlos is a great talker. He's
always got a joke or two on hand,
and even the standard cracks ("If
it's too short I'll put some back.")
seem funny- If you're lucky,

though, you'll be there when Car
los breaks out a (supposedly)
brand new joke, so you can listen
to Roy and A 1 chuckle to them
selves, and watch as he patiently
explains the punchline to Moe.
Wait around 'til there aren't
any women or children in the
shop, then listen. Hoo-boy.
What's more, this man will
actually listen to how you want it
cut, and sometimes even do what
you say. Have it your way; Carlos
is Burger King.
• But A 1 is the master. One of
the two original members of
"ROY-AL Barber Shop" (get it?
Pretty clever), this man has been
cutting hair for at least three or
four decades, and it shows. Al's
chair is usually by appointment
only, so when he unexpectedly
motioned to me one day, I knew,
just like PBS had always told me,
I really was special.
Electric razor? Ptooie! A 1 uses
real shaving cream, and a real
blade; he's the only one there who
holds a fine-to-knive job.
Completing our analogy, A 1 is

the Sunset Grill of barbers: He
calls all his customers by name.
He'll also serve you a prime cut,
and his name also looks like a
steak sauce.
He's not that talkative, but
with Carlos nearby, who cares? I
stepped out of Al's chair feelin'
smooth and slick. Finally, I had it.
Right hair, right now. Right on.
So visit President's. Play Rus
sian roulette with your hair.
While waiting, enjoy the various
Sports Illustrateds of the past
decade kindly put on display.
Munch on a stale piece of candy
(50 donation goes to a worthy
cause). Ask one of the old bald
guys waiting who the hell he
thinks he's fooling. Check out the
Victoria's Secret catalogues under
the TV. But if Roy calls you up,
then run like hell. He obviously
thinks the place was named after
President Butch.
But I know you're sick of hair
jokes. So I'll cut it.
After all, I'm just a simple
man. I'd hate to be accused of
'fropundity.

The president's men, Moe, Carlos, Roy and Al — in no particular order — smile confidently at another
job well done.


A small, yet excited customer is confident that Carlos' blonde jokes
will make him stop worrying if having his hair cut will hurt or not.
But forsooth, what can a poor
male (or adventurous female) do
when his mop starts to flop over
the top? You can grease it (Fonz),
braid it (Pippi), pull it back (Bono)
or push it up (Yahoo), but when it
comes to dealing with long hair,
every guy soon reaches the same
conclusion: A man's comb is his
hassle.
Which leaves us with two
options: dreadlocks and haircuts.
The first requires no time, no
money, no waiting and no daily
styling, and looks just as good six
months later. Naturally, most
choose the other.
So where can you go? It was so
tough leaving Joe/Tony/Frank
back home. Sure, you heard the
same dumb jokes and raunchy
military stories every time, but
there was something to it. It was
home. Is there any place like that
around?
No. But President's comes
close.
From the moment you step
into President's Barber Shop on

University Avenue, you can tell
you've hit an honest, down-home
barber shop. All the signs ure
there. Puke green chairs. Oodles
of combs stuffed into dirty glasses
of four-month old water. Four
gentlemen, two ancient, dressed
in snazzy clothes that were proba
bly hip sometime during the Pale
olithic Age. A lineup of older, bald
men waiting for haircuts they
don't even need. And of course the
Playboys under the television set.
Sure, none of the barbers are
named Joe or Tony, but it seems
they have it all.
But can they cut hair? This
investigative report cracks that
story wide open. During a recent
four-month period, I sacrificed
four afternoons, $48 (not includ
ing the hat I had to buy) and at
least one month of social rejection
because my hair looked goony, in
order to find out.
Anyway, here is the fruit of my
labor, a barber-by-barber report
on . . . all the President's men:
• Roy, a veteran of this estab
lishment, is a nightmare. They
put him closest to the window so
potential customers can see his

Wait around 'til
there aren't any
women or chil
dren in the
shop, then lis
ten. Hoo-boy.

work; thus overcrowding is kept
down. It's not that he's bad, it's
just that he does hair only one
way: short. Short on the sides.
Short on the back. Short up top.
But I'm giving you the impres
sion that he cuts it evenly.
Consider him the Kentucky
Fried Chicken of barbers: He does
just one thing, but boy does he do
it. Ask him to leave the tail, and
he'll leave it — on the floor. The
worst possible thing you can tell
Roy is, "I think I'd like it short
today." Then he gets this wild,
evil look in his eyes, starts laugh
ing maniacally, breaks out the

hedge-clippers and goes to town,
shaving chunks here and there
until you come out looking like
Kojak.
To top it all off, Roy is at least a
month behind his co-workers on
the joke-circulation circuit. You can
hear Carlos tell a joke during one
visit, and catch it from Roy during
the next. He was still running
through his Saddam Hussein mate
rial when I last listened to him.
Gosh, that haircut was rough.
Sure, I could have gotten a hair
piece to cover up the bad cutting
job, but if it didn't look real, then
I would've had hell toupee.
• Moe is next in line. It's not a
good name for a barber, really,
bringing up images of unwieldy
lawn-cutting instruments. But
any man named after one of the
Three Stooges earns respect in
my book, especially when, as a
barber, he doesn't sport the same
haircut as his namesake. I sat
down, told him what I wanted,
and he went to work, doing every
thing fine for a while, until he for
got what I'd said and just cut
everything.
Quiet, humble and likable to a
fault, Moe has one small problem:
severe cluelessness. At one point,
I mentioned to him that I had
been in Berlin not too long ago.
"Oh ..." he breathed to me
like some Peter Lorre imperson
ator. "What a great time to be
there. . . . Oh ... So much hap
pening. ..."
"Yeah," I replied. "Berlin was a
fantastic experience," throwing
out my generic six-months-of-my
life-in-a-sentence line.
"Yes, I'm sure. . . . Now, do you
know Russian?" Wham. Game
over, man. Thank you for playing.
If Roy is KFC, then Moe is like
Taco Bell. Seems nice enough
from afar, but inside it's all mush.
• Young, bearded, jocular,
nubile Carlos is the third barber
in. This man provides the energy
of the shop. Without him, the
other three would wither away,
repeating the same jokes more
and more slowly until they just
fell forward singing "Daaaaaai
isssyyyyy ..."
Carlos is a great talker. He's
always got a joke or two on hand,
and even the standard cracks ("If
it's too short I'll put some back.")
seem funny- If you're lucky,

though, you'll be there when Car
los breaks out a (supposedly)
brand new joke, so you can listen
to Roy and A 1 chuckle to them
selves, and watch as he patiently
explains the punchline to Moe.
Wait around 'til there aren't
any women or children in the
shop, then listen. Hoo-boy.
What's more, this man will
actually listen to how you want it
cut, and sometimes even do what
you say. Have it your way; Carlos
is Burger King.
• But A 1 is the master. One of
the two original members of
"ROY-AL Barber Shop" (get it?
Pretty clever), this man has been
cutting hair for at least three or
four decades, and it shows. Al's
chair is usually by appointment
only, so when he unexpectedly
motioned to me one day, I knew,
just like PBS had always told me,
I really was special.
Electric razor? Ptooie! A 1 uses
real shaving cream, and a real
blade; he's the only one there who
holds a fine-to-knive job.
Completing our analogy, A 1 is

the Sunset Grill of barbers: He
calls all his customers by name.
He'll also serve you a prime cut,
and his name also looks like a
steak sauce.
He's not that talkative, but
with Carlos nearby, who cares? I
stepped out of Al's chair feelin'
smooth and slick. Finally, I had it.
Right hair, right now. Right on.
So visit President's. Play Rus
sian roulette with your hair.
While waiting, enjoy the various
Sports Illustrateds of the past
decade kindly put on display.
Munch on a stale piece of candy
(50 donation goes to a worthy
cause). Ask one of the old bald
guys waiting who the hell he
thinks he's fooling. Check out the
Victoria's Secret catalogues under
the TV. But if Roy calls you up,
then run like hell. He obviously
thinks the place was named after
President Butch.
But I know you're sick of hair
jokes. So I'll cut it.
After all, I'm just a simple
man. I'd hate to be accused of
