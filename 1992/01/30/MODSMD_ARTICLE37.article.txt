## 'Juice' tells it like it is 
### Victor Haseman 
Occasionally a film comes
along that doesn't quite know
what it wants to be.
This is one of several maladies
that persecutes cinematographer
Ernest Dickerson's "Juice." Nev
ertheless, this hip-hop film set in
Harlem manages to escape from
the clutches of box office flop
dom with an agility seldom seen,
emerging as an effective "enter
tainment" flick with a serious
message.
Co-written by Dickerson and
Gerard Brown, "Juice" suffers
from a lackluster screenplay. The
film trips along for more than 30
minutes revealing only the barest
of plots, and leaving the audience
wondering how the characters
make it from A to B. In fact, the
four main characters, Bishop,
R'Heem, G-Q and Steels, seldom
venture out of the second dimen
sion.
However, just when you're
ready to write the film off as dead,
Dickerson smashes you over the
head with a series of scenes that
leave you dazed and confused,
muttering, "I can't believe what
just happened." From this point
on, it's hard to ignore the film's
palatable mix of action and
drama, which convincingly res
cues it from total chaos.
As unknown casts go,
"Juice's" five actors are excellent.
Digital Underground's Tupac
Shakur as Bishop and newcomer
Omar Epps as G-Q yield top
notch performances as do their
co-stars Jermaine Hopkins and
Khalil Kain. In fact, their perfor
mances save the film's weaker

first half. With a better script,
their acting would have only
shone brighter.
Despite these problems, Dick
erson makes an impressive debut
as a director. His choice of sets
coupled with the actual backdrop
of present-day Harlem work well
to give the film a sense of other
worldness, and he does so with
out turning it into a horror writ
er's brainchild.
Dickerson achieves this aura
by continually contrasting the
clearly depressed state of the
district with the friendship of
the main characters. The charis
matic party, school and street
scenes also help to give the view
er the feeling that life's good
times and bad times pay only the
slightest attention to one's sur
roundings.
To further enhance the film's
quality, Dickerson incorporates
several well-designed dream
sequences and elaborately chore
ographed fight sequences, which
help to balance the film's action
appeal with its drama.
Though "Juice" struggles
along the way, its message is
clear. The characters subscribe to
the American Dream — to be
rich, powerful and respected.
However, tormented by social,
educational and economic re
straints, they struggle to accept
Harlem's warped version of this
dream — juice — which is given
and taken away with the cocking
of a.38.
Despite its uneven nature,
"Juice" should be taken seriously
because of Dickerson's obvious,
though clumsy, fresh talent as a
screen writer and director.
