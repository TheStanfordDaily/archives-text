# Coppola's personal apocalypse revealed
## 
### Mike Curry Staff writer 
When the word "documentary"
is mentioned, stereotypical images
of civil war photographs or BBC
specials on cheese curds often come
to mind. But the documentary
"Hearts of Darkness: A Film
Maker's Apocalypse," which chron
icles the filming of "Apocalypse
Now," is refreshingly different.
Interspersing clips of "Apoca
lypse Now" in chronological
order, the documentary is two
films in one, providing both the
narrative drama of the original
film and an educational analysis
of its production. In fact, don't
worry if you haven't seen "Apoc
alypse Now," because enough
critical footage is provided to
understand and enjoy Francis
Ford Coppola's Vietnam-era
adaptation of Joseph Conrad's
novel, "Heart of Darkness."
"Hearts of Darkness" draws
upon nearly 60 hours of Eleanor
Coppola's footage in which she fol
lows her husband around the
Philippine jungle during the film's
17 months of shooting. It also uti
lizes information from her journal
and private audio tapes as well as
interviews with the cast and crew,
including the "Apocalypse No-v"
stars — Dennis Hopper, Robert
Duval and Martin Sheen.
The story of "Apocalypse
Now's" production is high drama
in itself. The disasters that beset
the making of the film — the
typhoon, the Philippine civil war,

cost overruns, Martin Sheen's
heart attack, etc. — are more
numerous than in an episode of
Little House on the Prairie.
But the real drama of "Dark
ness" is Francis Coppola's strug
gle to maintain artistic and finan
cial control despite these difficul
ties. Coppola bets all of his assets,
including the mortgage on his
house, to keep his production
afloat. Desperately wanting to
fulfil his own artistic vision for
the film, Coppola nearly experi
ences a nervous breakdown in the
Philippine jungle because his
own expectations (and the stu
dio's) nearly strangle him.
The soul of the film is Coppo
la's fear of artistic failure — his
own "Heart of Darkness." After
dropping the screenplay's origi
nal "macho" ending, Coppola
nearly digs himself into an
inescapable creative hole when he
tries to improvise several endings
with Marlon Brando.
The real treat and lesson of
"Hearts of Darkness" is its
demystification of the film-mak
ing process, and its revelation
that acclaimed film directors do
not possess an effortless genius.
Instead of presenting a standard
cleanly edited and slickly market
ed film, "Hearts of Darkness"
truthfully reveals the stressful,
laborious side of film making,
and a man who struggles against
himself.

for "Apocalypse Now," insisting that more colorful, paisley
wardrobes would give a grittier feel.
