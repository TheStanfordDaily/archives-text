# Not just self-expression
## John Cage uses art in quest for 'self-alteration' 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
John Cage's "prepared piano" sounds
like fingers sifting through a box of nuts and
bolts. But "4'33"" sounds like nothing at all.
All noise, from car alarms to Beethoven,
is music to the ears of the 80-year-old com
poser, who has spent the past week on the
Stanford campus.
The week's activities have included a
lecture by Cage and discussion and perfor
mances of his work. But amid all the retro
spection, Cage says he prefers not to look
back over his past, but forward, toward his
future creations.
"I don't think about (my past work)," the
composer said, "I'm interested in what I
haven't yet done. So the best piece, as far as
I'm concerned, is the one I haven't written."
Despite his years, Cage works at such a
feverish pace that the piece he hasn't writ
ten today may be written by next month. In
December, Cage said, he wrote two lectures

— which are actually pieces of art, more
lyric than didactic — as well as two new
compositions for large orchestra.
He had also been working on etchings in
San Francisco for the two weeks before his
visit to Stanford. Why does Cage continue
his work at such a great pace when most
men his age would be playing golf and
sleeping until noon?
"We're living in a very rich period," the
composer said. "We live surrounded by
open doors. And when you're as old as I am,
if I don't go through the door quickly, I
won't have the experience.
"If I were more concentrated, I would
probably not go through any of the doors at
all."
Concentration on one sound, or a partic
ular art form, has not been Cage's style.
"We can either move toward the idea of
concentrating on one thing, or we can move
toward the idea of enjoying everything,"

Composer John Cage, on campus for a weeklong celebration of his music, says his
goal is making art more beautiful. "The thing to do is to find some way — and it can be
done, I think, through art — to enjoy life in its vast multiplicity," he says.
