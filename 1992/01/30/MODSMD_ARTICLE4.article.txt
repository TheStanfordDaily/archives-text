# Not just self-expression
## John Cage uses art in quest for 'self-alteration' 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
John Cage's "prepared piano" sounds
like fingers sifting through a box of nuts and
bolts. But "4'33"" sounds like nothing at all.
All noise, from car alarms to Beethoven,
is music to the ears of the 80-year-old com
poser, who has spent the past week on the
Stanford campus.
The week's activities have included a
lecture by Cage and discussion and perfor
mances of his work. But amid all the retro
spection, Cage says he prefers not to look
back over his past, but forward, toward his
future creations.
"I don't think about (my past work)," the
composer said, "I'm interested in what I
haven't yet done. So the best piece, as far as
I'm concerned, is the one I haven't written."
Despite his years, Cage works at such a
feverish pace that the piece he hasn't writ
ten today may be written by next month. In
December, Cage said, he wrote two lectures

— which are actually pieces of art, more
lyric than didactic — as well as two new
compositions for large orchestra.
He had also been working on etchings in
San Francisco for the two weeks before his
visit to Stanford. Why does Cage continue
his work at such a great pace when most
men his age would be playing golf and
sleeping until noon?
"We're living in a very rich period," the
composer said. "We live surrounded by
open doors. And when you're as old as I am,
if I don't go through the door quickly, I
won't have the experience.
"If I were more concentrated, I would
probably not go through any of the doors at
all."
Concentration on one sound, or a partic
ular art form, has not been Cage's style.
"We can either move toward the idea of
concentrating on one thing, or we can move
toward the idea of enjoying everything,"

Composer John Cage, on campus for a weeklong celebration of his music, says his
goal is making art more beautiful. "The thing to do is to find some way — and it can be
done, I think, through art — to enjoy life in its vast multiplicity," he says.
Cage said, his hands moving
together and apart to illustrate his
thoughts. "I think I move toward
the idea of enjoying everything.
"People used to speak of the
mainstream — how one can be
more important than the other —
but I think it's not a mainstream.
If it were a river at all, it would be
like a river in delta, many things
in one.
"And I think it's even not any
longer in delta, but is like the
ocean, where the idea of a single

thing has disappeared, there's so
many things going on."
Cage believes there can be a
higher purpose to music than
sheer enjoyment. Although he
says music can be listened to pure
ly for pleasure, he strives toward a
different goal in his compositions.
"People speak of self-expres
sion. I believe in self-alteration.
Using the art to change yourself
rather than express yourself," he
said.
"If you can't use a work of art,
it means it doesn't change you. If
it changes you, it served a pur
pose. The way it changes you is to
change your notion of what is
beautiful."

Making art more beautiful is
the goal that keeps Cage working
as fast as he can.
"Many people are very gloomy
now, and the newspapers are
gloomy. So, the thing to do is to
find some way — and it can be
done, I think, through art — to
enjoy life in its vast multiplicity."
An example of Cage's attempt
to love all facets of life is his learn
ing to cope with "annoying"
sounds. Cage said he discovered
that there were two kinds of
sounds that bothered people:
sounds that change, like traffic
sounds, and constant sounds, like
burglar alarms.
"I found it easier to learn to

love traffic sounds than burglar
alarms," Cage said, "but now, I
love burglar alarms. In fact I can't
think of any sounds now that I
don't actually like to listen to."
Cage said he also had problems
learning to love loud noises. To
conquer his dislike, Cage went to
a concert of the Spanish group
Zaj, where, Cage said, he knew
there would be loud music —
amplified through loudspeakers.
Cage then "toasted his ears" by
placing one, then another directly
against the speakers.
That night, Cage went to bed
with a ringing in his ears. When
he woke up the next day, the ring
ing remained. It was there the day

after that as well. He finally called
a doctor, but on his way to the
doctor's office the ringing
stopped. Since then, Cage said,
he's loved loud sounds as well.
Cage says he is not worried
about recent cuts in funding to
the arts, like the cuts at Stanford,
killing his creativity.
"I suppose some people are
concerned about (reduction in
arts funding)," Cage said, "I am
not. I come from the period before
grants. So that living now, in the
period when grants are diminish
ing, it seems to me to be the way it
always was.
"Art has never been — in my
experience — strongly supported.

You have to do it yourself.
"My mother used to say — see
ing that I wasn't making money
— she said 'Your cousin Burton is
doing very well.'
"I asked what he was doing,
and he was selling cars."
