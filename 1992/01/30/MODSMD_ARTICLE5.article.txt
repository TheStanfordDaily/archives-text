Thirty years after the women's movement
trained the spotlight on equality in the workplace,
many women find themselves in a quandary over
how best to balance career and family.
Everyone has something to say about the topic.
Some call working mothers selfish; others label
homemakers as unambitious. But whatever popular
opinion is, every woman who wants to have a family
struggles with the same problem: how to avoid mak
ing too many compromises.
Figures from the "Statistical Handbook on
Women in America" show that about half of Ameri
ca's new mothers remained part of the labor force,
up from one third a decade earlier.

"I know what it's like to balance [work and chil
dren), and it's no fun," says Maureen McNulty,
Stanford alumna and divorced mother of two.
McNulty is the director of the MBA Career Manage
ment Center at the Graduate School of Business,
where she works up to 70 hours a week, while rais
ing her children as a single parent.
"Being a mother didn't mean I was willing to be
sold into the white slave trade," she says. But,
McNulty she adds, sometimes that's exactly what
motherhood seems to entail.
Women in the '90s still tend to take responsibili
ty for household chores and child care, whether or
not they work, statistics from the Handbook and
anecdotal evidence suggest.
Robin Kennedy, wife of University President Don

ald Kennedy, says women face the dual challenges of
managing family life with commitment to careers.
Kennedy has had more than her share of compli
cated logistics to contend with. At age 28, having deter
mined she was "bored to death" with being a house
wife, she decided to go to Stanford Law School. But
two weeks before the classes started, her husband left
her and their two children, then aged one and three.
"All I wanted to do was bury my head in the
ground," she recalls, "but the school just wouldn't let
me."
She credits the University's sensitivity to
parental issues and its "incredible array of support
services" with making it possible for her to graduate.

But when Kennedy left the
University and joined a Los Ange
les law firm, her problems really
began.
In businesses where quantity
of work, not quality, is the issue, a
working mother has the deck
stacked against her, Kennedy
says."I really don't see how par
ents with young kids — even if
there are two parents — can
make it in a law firm," she says.
Kennedy continued her career
in the more flexible environment
of Stanford's Legal Office.
Many American businesses are
taking it upon themselves to help
families with two working parents
cope. For instance, Ann Spence,
wife of Business School Dean
Michael Spence and mother of
three, works almost full-time at a
consulting firm in San Francisco.
Some places are better than
others for parents to work. In a
recent national survey, local Sili
con Valley firms, such as Apple
Computers and Syntex, came out
on top.
"Helping balance career and
family is what Apple's mission
was," says Dianna Ballesteros,
director of the pre-kindergarten
child care facilities at Apple in
Cupertino. "The idea was that to
get good employees, you need to
offer benefits employees need."
Ballesteros says that it's done
by viewing employees not only in
terms of their work roles, but in
the context of their lives as a
whole. Doing so minimizes the
severity of the compromises
working parents must make.

Social scientists have long
studied public opinion on how
children's development is affected
when both parents in a family
work.
In a 1986 General Social Sur
vey, Americans were asked to
react to the statement, "A work
ing mother can establish just as
warm and secure a relationship
with her children as a mother
who does not work." Sixty-two
percent of men and women
agreed.
Author Breda Hunter, a psy
chologist specializing in infant
attachment, is part of the minori
ty who believe children are
adversely affected when both par
ents work.
Hunter founded a 2,000-mem
ber support group for mothers
who stay at home, and recently
published a book called "Home by
Choice." On a recent trip to Stan
ford, she said that mothers who
go back to work fail to bond
strongly with their children, and
even put them at risk psychologi
cally.
Yet, mothers who return to
work after raising children also
face difficulties.
According to a new national
study, conducted by Laurence
Levin, a professor at Santa Clara
University, and Joyce Jacobson of
Rhodes College in Memphis,
mothers who left work temporar
ily never again reached the same
salary level as women who hadn't
taken time off. The study looked
at more than 2,000 women in
both office and professional jobs.
Kennedy maintains, however,
that taking it slowly and making
time for your family is worth it:
"When you come back Ito work]
you are behind, but so what."
