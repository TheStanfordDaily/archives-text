Thirty years after the women's movement
trained the spotlight on equality in the workplace,
many women find themselves in a quandary over
how best to balance career and family.
Everyone has something to say about the topic.
Some call working mothers selfish; others label
homemakers as unambitious. But whatever popular
opinion is, every woman who wants to have a family
struggles with the same problem: how to avoid mak
ing too many compromises.
Figures from the "Statistical Handbook on
Women in America" show that about half of Ameri
ca's new mothers remained part of the labor force,
up from one third a decade earlier.

"I know what it's like to balance [work and chil
dren), and it's no fun," says Maureen McNulty,
Stanford alumna and divorced mother of two.
McNulty is the director of the MBA Career Manage
ment Center at the Graduate School of Business,
where she works up to 70 hours a week, while rais
ing her children as a single parent.
"Being a mother didn't mean I was willing to be
sold into the white slave trade," she says. But,
McNulty she adds, sometimes that's exactly what
motherhood seems to entail.
Women in the '90s still tend to take responsibili
ty for household chores and child care, whether or
not they work, statistics from the Handbook and
anecdotal evidence suggest.
Robin Kennedy, wife of University President Don

ald Kennedy, says women face the dual challenges of
managing family life with commitment to careers.
Kennedy has had more than her share of compli
cated logistics to contend with. At age 28, having deter
mined she was "bored to death" with being a house
wife, she decided to go to Stanford Law School. But
two weeks before the classes started, her husband left
her and their two children, then aged one and three.
"All I wanted to do was bury my head in the
ground," she recalls, "but the school just wouldn't let
me."
She credits the University's sensitivity to
parental issues and its "incredible array of support
services" with making it possible for her to graduate.
