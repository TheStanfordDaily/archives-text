# WOMEN AFTER STANFORD: CHOICES AND COMPROMISES
## Alums: Transition is not always easy 
### Jeff Brock Editorial staff 
The female Stanford graduate
walks a tightrope.
In one outstretched hand she
grasps at the success that a Stan
ford degree is supposed to guaran
tee. In the other, she reaches for
the love of a partner and children.
Meanwhile, the chasm of fail
ure beckons below.
Here are some recent gradu
ates who have stepped onto that
tightrope and are making tough
decisions about how they will
maintain their balance.

Leticia Valadez's transition to
post-Stanford life has been diffi
cult — because she's had to spend
it at home.
Due mainly to financial prob
lems, she's been living with her
parents in Los Angeles. "Now
that I'm back they forget I'm 22,

and that I fended for myself for
four years," says the 1991 gradu
ate. "I feel stifled. Lots of things I
learned I can't act on right now."
Valadez, a Human Biology
major, wanted to find a job in
public health but couldn't. So she
has been doing medical billing in a
doctor's office — and hating it.
She will start taking classes full
time Monday so she can prepare
for medical school applications
and the MCAT.
"I never thought I'd move back
home," she says. "But I've
learned a lot, about myself, hav
ing freedom, dealing with it."
Valadez says that coming from
a Mexican-American family poses
special challenges. "My parents
have a different view on what's
acceptable behavior for women,"
she says. "I'm sometimes amazed
they let me go to school." She
notes, however, that her family

has been very supportive in her
career plans.
After finishing medical school,
Valadez wants both a family and a
career in women's health. "I don't
want to be an 80-hour-a-week
workaholic," she says."I don't want
to look back at 40 and say, 'Who have
I done this all for? Myself?'
"I want to enjoy the miracle of
giving birth, raising children. I'm
traditional in that way." But, she
quickly adds, "I don't see myself as
a 24-hour mom."

After Stanford, Mary Rose said
she was burned out and tired. "I
wasn't in the place where I could
have done the go-getter things where
you send out 125 resumes and hustle
yourself into a great paying job," says
the psychology major.
She became an administrative
assistant in the UC-San Francisco
Program in Medical Ethics, a job
she enjoys but one that is not per
manent. She will attend graduate
school in psychology in 1993.
"Stanford can be a time where
you're selfish," she says, "but you
can also get swept up into other
people's activities. I needed time to
turn inward."
Since graduation in '90, Rose
has started martial arts training,
formed a women's reading group
and become familiar with San
Francisco, where she lives.
Like many Stanford graduates,
she wants both family and career.
"Hopefully I'll be in the type of
relationship that will allow me
some choices," she says.
Rose says she is further ahead
in her career than she planned six
years ago because she "came into
Stanford with low expectations."
She hasn't decided exactly what
her career goals are, but she
doesn't seem to mind. "These are
easily the best years I've spent."

When Patti Davis left the Farm,
her eyes were in the clouds. "I
thought the world would be at my
feet," she says. "We all did."
But she realized that a Stanford
degree is not an easy ticket to suc
cess. "Stanford does take you far —
people do a doubletake when they
hear you went there — but it didn't
necessarily get us the $40,000-a

year a job we expected," she says.
Davis, '89, is back in school,
working toward an Emergency
Medical Technician credential and
an eventual career as a physician's
assistant.
For Davis, who nuyored in Inter
national Relations, the transition
from school to job was fairly easy. A
summer public service fellowship
after graduation led to a job with the
San Mateo County Aids Program,
and eventually a frill-time job with
the Department of Health Services
of San Mateo County.
In that office she had to deal
with a male supervisor who made
sexist remarks and who conde
scended to her and her four female
co-workers. Davis was not intimi
dated, but she did get frustrated.
"I wasn't taken seriously."
Family and career are equally
important for her. Davis says she
wants four children, and depending
on her financial situation, would
like to stay home with them until
they're about a year old, then work
part-time until they are five and
afterward return to work full-time.

Odile Meister entered Stanford
with an achievement oriented
lifestyle, but since then her per
spective has changed. "I want a job
where I can develop relationships
with people, not necessarily helping
vast numbers of people," she says.
After Meister graduated last
June, she. "wanted to do some
thing completely different" from
her Stanford experience. So for
four months she worked in Calcut
ta with the Missionaries of Charity
at an orphanage and at the Home
for the Dying. She also spent a
month in a leprosy center, giving
out medicine and teaching paint
ing to people waiting for or recov
ering from operations.
Now that she's back, Meister is
applying for the Stanford Teacher
Education Project beginning in
June.
Her work with orphans has
encouraged her to adopt. However,
she laughs, "I do want to have one
so I can go through the birthing
process."
Meister says she views career
and family as equally important,
but seems to lean a little more
toward family.
She does want a part time job
while she raises her children; "I
couldn't imagine completely drop
ping work to exclusively spend
time with my kids," she says.
