# Entering workforce can bring surprises
## Real world isn't always like Stanford 
### Katrin Schumann 
Though both men and women
have a bewildering set of hurdles
upon leaving Stanford, women
are faced with unique challenges.
One such challenge is facing a
workplace shaped and populated
largely by men. Virginia Mak,
career specialist at the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center, says
women are often shocked when
they enter the business world.
"If they go the more careerist
route, they don't realize, especial
ly [if they came] from Stanford
where we try to be more enlight
ened and equitable, what it's real
ly like," she says.
Still, statistics tell a story of a
nation progressing steadily
toward acceptance of equality for
men and women.

In 1935, a Gallup poll revealed
that less than one-fifth of men
and women interviewed approved
of married women earning money
in business. In 1989, that figure
had leapt to four-fifths. A monu
mental change in society's percep
tion of women had taken place in
the intervening 50 years.
Observers also cite substantial
progress toward equality of
opportunity in the workplace.
Maureen McNulty, director of
the MBA Career Management
Center at the Graduate School of
Business and herself a Stanford
graduate, says sex discrimination
is no longer an issue for women at
the business school. The school
has been at least 30 percent
female since the early 1980s.

According to McNulty, employ
ers usually "don't interview
women. They interview candidates
and they happen to be women."
In the rare instances when this
is not the case, there are conse
quences, McNulty said.
McNulty remembers one such
example. Five years ago, an inter
viewer from a New York-based
firm asked this questions to
women students at the Business
School: If assigned a 10-month
project at work, would you consid
er an abortion if you became preg
nant?
Outraged, the Business School
complained to the company. An
immediate apology was given, and
the company offered to return to the
West Coast to re-interview all the

candidates, although none of the
men or women took up the offer.
One of the reasons that such
scenes are now unusual is that
the education level of women in
the job market has steadily been
steadily increasing over the last
several decades.
Still, according to Mak, educa
tion does not guarantee equal
opportunity and treatment. Mak,
who counsels students of all ages
and disciplines at the CPPC, says
that the more educated women
get, the lower their self esteem
sinks.
For "graduate women — par
ticularly in the sciences — their
self esteem is basically nil," she
says. The farther up the academic
or business ladder they climb, the
less women they see as role mod
els, Mak asserts.
