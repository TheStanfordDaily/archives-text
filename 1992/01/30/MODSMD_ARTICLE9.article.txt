# Student services hit by UAC budget cuts
## Proposal to shift advising burden to faculty members is questioned 
### Kristina Aberg 
The $80,000 budget shortfall
faced by the Undergraduate
Advising Center may require it to
cut advising hours in half, elimi
nate certain programs targeted
mainly at sophomores and rely
more heavily on faculty advisers.
The new budget proposal will
go into effect in 1993 and would
reduce the UAC's funds by 15
percent. That figure was lowered
from an earlier proposal of 20 per
cent because of student objec
tions, according to UAC Director
Hector Cuevas.
The center falls under the
administrative area of student
resources, which must meet a
$2,250,000 budget-reduction tar
get.
Verity Powell, a preprofession
al adviser, said, "We are going to
have to look for big things to cut
out," adding that such cuts might
include Sophomore Celebration,
the Majors Event and outreach
programs held in student resi
dences. She said some self-sup
porting conferences, such as an
annual forum for prospective law
students attended by nearly 60
law schools, will not be cut.
Cuts will also affect the on-call
advising services now offered by
the UAC. The administration
suggested transferring this role to
the faculty, but many in the UAC
do not see this as a feasible solu
tion.
"I don't see the faculty having
the interest or the overview to do
this kind of advising," said
Kathryn Wright, an adviser at the
UAC who focuses on advising for
transfer students. "Faculty do
absolutely essential advising â€” we
do broader advising for students
who have particular problems."
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Tony Siegman, who has advised
undergraduates before, stressed
that "advising is absolutely
important and a major responsi
bility of the University."
However, he added that in

departments such as engineering,
where graduate students out
number undergraduates, many of
the faculty relate better to gradu
ates and have less time to devote
to undergraduates.
"I don't think the faculty could
do the job the UAC does," said
senior David Feiock, a pre-med.
"Faculty have their own con
cerns, projects and research. They
are not likely to be in on the pre
med scene."
Another administration sugges
tion for easing the effects of the
budget cuts was to close the center
for one of the summer months.
Powell said this was "absurd for
those of us who do med school
advising" as these months are the
most important for them.
While there will be no direct
layoffs, UAC employees will have
their hours reduced by half,
which may cause many of them to
seek jobs elsewhere, according to
Wright. "There will be less on-call
advising, and more support ser
vices, which amounts to clerical
work," she said.
Junior Nicole Wilcox, who
transferred to Stanford last year,
said the on-call advising was an
important resource for students.
"There is a lot of lag time between
when you don't have an adviser
and when you declare a major,"
she said. "The advisers at the
UAC are seasoned and have a lot
of experience working with
undergrads."
About 3,000 students seek
advice from the UAC each year,
and the center is already
swamped with requests for coun
seling. "I had to wait three weeks
to get an appointment this quar
ter," Feiock said.
Some of the services provided
by the UAC include advising
juniors and seniors who are
applying to graduate schools, act
ing as a safety net for those stu
dents whose freshman advisers
are no longer valuable resources,
and simply helping students map
out their four years at Stanford.
