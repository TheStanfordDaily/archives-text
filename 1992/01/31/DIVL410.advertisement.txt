judges for the debate tournament hosted by the Stanford
Debate Society would be great. But great things are often
hard to come by. For instance,
Sex &
other sinful, decadent things can be difficult to find. On
the weekend of February 7,8 &9, though, money
shouldn't be hard to find. You may want to buy
Drugs
with your money. Maybe not. Regardless, the Stanford
Debate Society is hosting a high school speech and
debate tournament on February 7,8 & 9 and is looking for
judges. Debate judges will be paid an astronomical $8 per
round... judges for individual events will earn an equally
startling $5 per round. If this
sounds good to you (and it certainly should!), please
contact Matt Fraser at <510) 4*9-9847. Thanks.
