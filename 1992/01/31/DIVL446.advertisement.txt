INFINITY:
The
career
you knew
was out there...
The entrepreneurial adventure of a lifetime.
At Infinity, you won't be just a cog in the machine. You
won't be maintaining someone else's code. You won't
be in a "training program" and you won't be writing
someone else's letters or making their photocopies. Nor
will you sit in front of a Lotus spreadsheet for two
years.
What you will do is meet major challenges head on.
You'll be a key member of our core development team
building state-of-the-art object-oriented trading systems
for the world's leading financial institutions. You'll
have responsibility for major projects from conception
to completion. You'll gain international business expe
rience by helping to capture market share in major
financial centers like New York, London, Tokyo, and
Toronto.
AND â€” you'll hold an equity position.
If you're a self-starter and a team player looking for an alternative experience,
come talk to us about opportunities in Software Engineering, Quality Control,
Technical Writing, Marketing and Sales. On-Campus interviews are February
18th for Any Major (sign up by Feb. 3), and February 19th for Technical (sign
up by Feb. 13). Or if schedules are full, send a cover letter, resume and unoffi
