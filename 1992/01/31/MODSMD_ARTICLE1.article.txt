# Student fees, shorter hours will cut costs at Cowell

### Miranda Doyle Rohena Gera 
Cowell Student Health Center has proposed
cuts in urgent-care hours, a $7 or $8 quarterly
student fee and reductions in counseling services
to meet its $600,000 budget-reduction target.
About half of the savings is expected to
come from the elimination of funding for spe
ciality referral services. According tn the pro
posal, Cowell will no longer pay for procedures
done by outside specialists.
"We've tried to preserve the core services,
but we're very concerned about referrals," said
Jane Meier, Cowell's assistant director. She
said 1,300 to 1,400 students are referred to
outside physicians each year.
Any payment for laboratory tests, X-rays or
diagnostic exams will also be dropped, accord
ing to Meier.
She said the cut will result in either
increases in Stanford's insurance plan premi
um or a $7 to $8 fee charged to students each
quarter.
Meier said Cowell is doing a study now to
predict how much the yearly premium would
increase for Banker's Life, the plan students
may purchase through the University. "We
thought it was as much as $100, but now we
think it would be less," she said.
But Meier said the fee would be preferable
because it would eliminate some of the paper
work and "red tape" students would have to
deal with in order to have their insurance pay
for specialists.
"The easiest, best and cheapest way is a
small, mandatory health fee," she said.
After-hours urgent care services will also be
cut, Meier said. Cowell is now open until 11
p.m. on weekdays and 8 p.m. on weekends.
The proposal calls for the health center to
close at 8 p.m. weekdays and 6 p.m. weekends.
A physician will still be on call 24 hours,
and students can get emergency care at Stan
ford Hospital. But Cowell won't pay for trips
to the emergency room, and Meier said doc
tor's fees can be $150 to $200, plus as much as
hundreds of dollars for tests.
Other services affected include the Counsel-
