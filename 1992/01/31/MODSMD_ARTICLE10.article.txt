# Cornell official to head audit team
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
As the University continues to reform its
accounting practices in the wake of the indirect-cost
controversy, Glen Mueller has been appointed the
new director of internal audit.
Mueller, who assumes the position Feb. 7, is cur
rently the director of auditing at Cornell University.
"The most important thing will be recruiting an
excellent staff and implementing the procedures to
comply with regulations," Mueller said. "I will not
have a role in Stanford's prior disputes with the gov
ernment, but I will work to correct the problems of
the existing policies and system."
Government auditors have been inspecting Stan
ford's books since the indirect-cost controversy
began last year, and their discoveries of inappropri
ate charges prompted the University to restructure
its accounting systems.
"The key is to develop internal controls that are
effective but not overly bureaucratic," Mueller said.

"It will be a balance between control and not
impeding research."
While at Cornell, Mueller developed a respected
internal auditing program to provide information to
the Defense Contract Audit Agency â€” the agency
that is currently auditing the University's indirect
cost recovery practices for the 1980s.
"I will work on a combination between carrying
through the things already begun at Stanford as well
as my own initiatives," Mueller said.
He added that work on internal controls must
expand beyond indirect-cost issues to all of the Uni
versity's internal accounting practices.
Reed Brimhall, who has served as director of
internal audit since April, will assume the new posi
tion of director of government cost and rate studies
and will handle external audits.
Mueller will serve under Chief Financial Officer
Peter Van Etten, who joined Stanford over the sum
mer and has implemented a series of strategies to
correct accounting problems discovered by govern
ment auditors.
