Stanford Chicano/Latino stu
dents will have the opportunity to
discuss life after the Farm with
alumni at a symposium tomor
row.
"We want more alumni com
munication; our main focus for
this symposium is communica
tion," said Robert Almanzan, a
senior who has helped coordinate
the event.
Students have idealistic
notions about work in the Chi
cano/Latino community after
graduating, said Delores Reveles,
Class of 1974. The symposium's
goal is to give students a more
realistic view, she added.
"You can go out there and do
what you want to do in the com
munity, (but) it's important to let
(the studentsl know that it's
going to be hard," said Reveles,
who will be part of a panel on pub
lic service.

Alumni will participate in
panel discussions for students
interested in engineering, public
service, education, pre-medicine,
pre-law and business. The
keynote speaker of the event is
Assemblyman Xavier Becerra, D-
Monterey Park.
The alumni taking part in the
symposium were contacted
because of their successful
careers and also because of their
involvement in community work,
said Almanzan.
"We want to stress interac
tion," he added. "We want to get
to the nitty-gritty aspects: How
did you get where you are?"
"I wish we had this kind of
program when I was an under
graduate," said Arturo Vargas,
Class of '84. According to Vargas
there was some networking with
alumni while attending Stanford,
but no stress was given to interest
in community work.
"It would have helped me to
know which are the organizations

'We want to get to the
nitty-gritty aspects:
How did you get
where you are?'
— Robert Almanzan

that were doing work and advoca
cy on Latino issues," Vargas said.
The Chicano/Latino alumni
club created the symposium as a
way to reach out to students, said
Frances Morales, director of El
Centro Chicano.
Dr. Elena Rios organized the
event, contacted alumni and set
up the panels. She will be a part of
the pre-medicine panel.
"This is the first time Stanford
undergraduates have gotten
together with alumni in an event
like this," Almanzan said. "Hope
fully this program will continue
year after year."
