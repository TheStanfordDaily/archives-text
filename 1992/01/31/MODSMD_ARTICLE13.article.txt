# Editor's farewell
## The
						human factor 
### 
George Bush and I have some
thing in common — and it
isn't a passion for pork rinds.
Actually, it is something even
more disgusting than deep-fried
pig fat. It is the stomach flu. Yes
terday, after I lost my hash browns
and bananas, I thought of the poor
old president exposing his vulnera
bility to the world.
We don't see enough of the
human being in our public figures.
For that, I blame the social pressure
on all of us to be "all right now."
Journalists are perhaps the most
image-conscious of all. We pride our
selves on objectivity — on distance
from others — in order to break the
story that changes the world.
With the exception of Daily
columnists, you probably won't
ever recognize the faces of the peo
ple who put this paper together. Yet,
every day, more than 100 people put
in long hours selling ads, shooting
photographs, drawing pictures,
writing stories, editing copy, design
ing layouts, coming up with snazzy
headlines and pasting up the 10
pages you are holding in your hand.
The process is a delicate one.
Deadlines punctuate every step of
the way. If one person screws up,
everyone has to wait. The real dif
ficulty isn't in meeting deadlines;
it is in keeping the human element
under control.
Whether it's an irate source
who needs to be soothed, a manag
ing editor with poison oak or a
staff writer with a midterm, main
taining the peace and coordination
that is necessary in the newspaper
business is a never-ending job.
Every editor in chief who's ever
been elected has promised to man
age the staff so that everyone's
happy enough to produce a high
quality paper. I know I did.
But the best-laid plans will
never prepare you for your first
management crisis. It is ironic that
my term as editor began and ended
with the Stuart Thomas story.
Allegations of sexual assault are
sticky enough to confound journal
ists with far more experience.
Yet the way my staff has worked

together to cover the story, from
accusation to sentencing for a mis
demeanor charge of statutory rape,
has been a source of pride for me and
a learning tool for this community.
In deciding to print Thomas'
photograph and details of the inci
dent from a police report, we took
risks. And they came with a price.
There are some people who hate
the decisions we have made,
because of the pain those choices
have caused. Added to this is the
burden of introspection — of ask
ing ourselves whether it's worth
alienating our neighbors.
Yet we never show our readers
what we go through. There are no
stories about Daily editors sobbing
in bathrooms, or getting queasy
when the phone rings on a particu
larly tough news day.
Part of our job as journalists is
to discover your intensely personal
disappointments and shortcom
ings — but we'll never show you
ours. I was reminded of this double
standard by the candidate who lost
our recent editor-in-chief election.
A capable leader and a major
contributor to the success of this
volume, Ari Richter wasn't picked
to replace me. The story, like other
Daily election stories, didn't men
tion him. Rather than reporting
the news, we reported the rosy
stuff that we, as idealistic journal
ists, claim to hate.
I have learned a great deal about
the Stanford community during
my rein as editor. But I have
learned the most from my staff.
They are a talented group, dedicat
ed beyond reason to putting out the
best college paper in the country.
But most of all, they are uni
formly graceful in disappointments
and successes. For what they have
taught me, I am thankful.
I challenge them to keep the
quest for truth alive, both as
reporters seeking stories, and as
human beings seeking to under
stand themselves.
