# You make the call

### 
very day \ editors at The
Daily are faced with deci
sions that force us to con
front difficult ethical ques-
I tions. The following is a
series of major campus
v events that have happened
this academic year. In each of them, we have
asked ourselves about the implications of
publishing certain events, images or details.
This is a chance to let you, the reader, stand
in our shoes and see how you would act.
We welcome your written responses for
publication next week. Please answer yes or
no to each question, and feel free to include
any additional comments. Include your
name, phone number and Stanford affilia
tion, if any. Send responses to The Stanford
Daily, Storke Publications Building, Stan
ford, CA. 94305, or bring them to our office
across from Terman Pond. Editorial policy
will not be affected by reader response.
Case #1:

Reporting on sexual assault

On Sept. 26 a student said she
was raped in a campus dormi
tory. The following are several
of the issues Daily editors grap
pled with in the coverage of this
traumatic event.
1. Should The Daily have
reported on the incident?
2. The incident occurred in

an ethnic theme house. Is the race of the alleged

assailant or victim relevant?
3. Should the name and photo of the accused
be printed?
4. The victim turned 18 before the case went
to court. Should her name have been printed
without her consent? Her picture?
5. Should The Daily have printed graphic
details that were revealed as the story unfolded?
6. Should coverage have continued even though
statutory — not forcible — rape was charged?
Case #2:

Reporting on suicide

On Nov. 9 a student found his roommate's body
on the floor of their room. A suicide note was
found nearby.
1. Does the community need to know that a
student took his own life?
2. Given that publicity of suicides may lead to
more attempts, should the subject get any
attention in newspapers?
3. The suicide note revealed personal details
about the student. Should the contents have
been reported?
4. Should a reporter try to contact the family?
5. Should a photograph of the victim be printed?
Case #3:

The power of imagery

These two images — one of an
incinerated Iraqi soldier, the
other of a 303-pound cyst
removed by doctors at Stanford
Hospital — appeared in The
Daily on separate occasions.

1. Should images that could upset certain
readers be printed?
2. Was the war photograph an appropriate
image to commemorate the Gulf War?
3. Although the cyst was the largest reported
growth of its kind, and although surgeons at
Stanford Hospital removed the mass, should
Daily editors have run the photo?
Case #4:

Reporting on University officials

A student committee evaluat
ing candidates for the position
of Vice President for Student
Resources did not plan to rec
ommend Sally Mahoney, the
acting vice president and a
candidate for the permanent
job. The Daily ran stories on
all candidates' backgrounds. A

reporter contacted several committee members
who spoke candidly about their decisions. The
reporter later learned while interviewing
Mahoney for the same story that the recom
mendations were supposed to be confidential.
1. Should The Daily have pulled the story and
respected the confidentiality of the process?
2. Is it appropriate for a paper to report a
story damaging to a person's reputation?
