## Viewpoint Tuition hikes — 'Blood from a stone' 
### 
UNTIL WEDNESDAY, THE Uni
versity was a recovering tuition
alcoholic. Now I'm not so sure.
Before 1987, Stanford had a serious
tuition problem. Each year, the rate
increases it charged outpaced the annual
growth rate of family incomes. These
increases had a cumulative effect. Even
tually, 63 percent of undergraduates
required financial assistance to attend
Stanford.
For a couple of years, Stanford was
starting to do better. Then, in 1989, it
had a relapse. Luckily, the trustees
stepped in — as a good parent should —
to put a cap on the chaos. They limited
future growth of undergraduate costs —
tuition, room and board — to 1 percent
more than inflation, a rate which suppos
edly represents the long-term growth of
family incomes in the United States.
Now, the University has come back to
ask — I guess that's what you'd call it —
the Stanford community if it's acceptable
to take another sip from the bottle. The
administration points to all the other big
kids — Harvard, Yale, etc. — and cries
that it needs this increase to compete.
"Everybody's doing it," they claim.
Besides, the University isn't talking
about raising room and board costs above
inflation, so the increase only applies to
70 percent of your bill. Also, tuition
increases are a drug with some positive
effects; they allow a school to grow, to do

more, to be bigger.
But don't be fooled. Tuition increases
leave permanent and severe negative side
effects. You can rest assured that the rate
increases we agree to now will be here in
30 years when we send our children to
college. Each time an increase is made
above the rate of income growth, Stan
ford becomes less affordable forever, not
just the next year.
One way Stanford offsets these
increases is by offering financial aid. I
hope the University still realizes that it
can't get blood from a stone; that is,
Stanford cannot increase what it collects
from needy students more rapidly than
their ability to pay increases. The money
has to come from somewhere; any tuition
increase would require a sizable addition
al commitment to financial aid.
I worry about financial aid because of
what the Univ. has done to graduate
students who have assistantships.
Though graduate stipends became sub
ject to federal taxation several years ago,
the University has never compensated
students for this change or even included
taxes on its list of legitimate costs that
graduate students are likely to incur. I
wonder if this is a hint from the Univer
sity that we shouldn't pay.
Even if the University manages to
raise tuition without placing the burden
on students who cannot afford to pay,
such an increase would still have serious

consequences. It certainly was not the
vision of Leland Stanford to make
expenses a primary factor in gaining an
education. Yet, when students compare
Stanford with UC-Berkeley and other
state institutions, it is very hard for a fis
cally responsible family to justify Stan
ford's high cost.
The University could achieve the same
financial benefit by instead raising the
rate by which we draw from the endow
ment by 0.1 or 0.2 percent. Of course, the
trustees are reluctant to embrace this
idea because it would cause a permanent
drain on Stanford's monetary founda
tion.
It is time for everyone to recognize
that tuition increases have the exact
same effect, that students of today and
tomorrow are a large part of the founda
tion on which Stanford's future will be
built.
A tuition increase should truly be a
last resort for the University. Before
Stanford is allowed to regress into its
past addiction, even for one year, addi
tional cuts and re-organizations should
be publicly examined. Furthermore, any
increases that are approved must be
needs-tested and seen for what they are,
a permanent weakening of Stanford's
future.
