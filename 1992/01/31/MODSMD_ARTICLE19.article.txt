## Card much too hot for Hawaii, 9-0 
### Amy Wusterbarth Editorial staff 
The men's tennis team came through their
first dual-match of the season with flying colors
yesterday afternoon. The Cardinal defeated
Hawaii in every match up, with only two
stretching to three sets.
Sophomore Michael Flanagan soundly
defeated Pete Sohn 6-2, 6-0, proving that his
wrist is back in fine form. "Mike held up well
today," said head coach Dick Gould. "It was
good for him to get a match in."
Flanagan's nagging wrist injury has kept
him from playing a match since December. As if
that wasn't enough pressure, Flanagan was
bumped up to the No. 1 spot in yesterday's
match.
"I started out nervous because I didn't even
know until I got here that I'd be playing No. 1,"
Flanagan said. "He had a good serve and volley
but I think he was having trouble with it so I
was able to attack his second serve pretty well."
Gould pulled Alex O'Brien from the first spot
in the lineup because O'Brien had an opportu
nity to hit with a top doubles player who is in
town for the upcoming Volvo Championships.
O'Brien received a wild card entry for this tour
nament. "Alex had a chance to get some extra
work in, so that gave us a chance to get all of
our guys in a match," Gould explained.
Chris Cocotos and Robert Devens also han
dled their opponents easily, with scores of 6-2,
6-4 and 6-1, 6-2, respectively. "I started really
well but then I got a little sloppy," Cocotos said.
Jason Yee and Vimal Patel finished the day
with wins of 6-1, 6-1 and 6-2, 6-1 while Billy
Wright fought back to pull out a 4-6, 6-0, 6-1
victory.
Doubles play also went well. Gould matched
up Devens and Patel in the first slot and Roman
Sydorak and Ken Pedroza in the second. Both
teams triumphed in straight sets, 6-4, 6-3 and
6-3, 6-4.
"Rob and Vimal had the most consistent
returning of serve that I've seen yet (from
them) although I was disturbed that we lost
serve several times," Gould said. "Ken and
Roman have played together alot,
they're not really a new combina
tion."
Wright teamed up with Mihir
Mankad to triumph in the second
three setter of the day, 7-5, 2-6,
6-4.
As the doubles mixing and
matching continues, the men
seem to keep winning, regardless
of who their partners are. How
ever, a firmer lineup is a necessi
ty if Stanford is going to be com
petitive in doubles play. "We are
behind schedule in terms of dou
bles," Gould said. "Things are a
long way from being settled."
Overall, though, Gould was
pleased with the day's results.
"No one was real careless and
everyone executed things they'd
been practicing, but we need to
keep this match in the context it
was in." Meaning that tomor
row's match with San Diego
should provide a much greater
challenge, where the team will
need to execute well if they want
to win.
Flanagan had similar senti
ments. "It was good to get back in
the swing of things, but tomor
row will be a little tougher than
today."
Play starts today at 1:30 at
Stanford Stadium.
