Elizabeth Joseph is married to
a man with nine wives. And she
likes it.
"I'm married to a man nine
times the husband of any other
man," Joseph, 38, said in a speech
in Branner Hall's lounge last night.
"I'm madly in love with him."
Speaking to a crowd of about
50, Joseph declared that her deci
sion to enter into a polygamous
marriage is simply the logical end
of feminist rhetoric.
A criminal defense attorney,
Joseph, who has one daughter by
her husband of 18 years, Alex
Joseph, said she "embraced" the
feminist movement as a college
student. But now she criticizes its
"flawed premises" and blames it
for "two wasted decades."
Feminism, Joseph said,
requires women to juggle careers
and children — two goals that are
often incompatible. "My daugh
ter is not in a day care center,"
she said. "She is at home, with a
family, and I am free to work with
a clear head.
"Being barefoot and pregi.ant
was not in my life script," Joseph
said. "By entering a plural mar
riage, I made sure of that."
She married Alex Joseph in
1974, as his seventh wife. Two of
her closest friends had already
married him, she said, and they
"kept pestering him" to marry her
as well.

Elizabeth Joseph passionately defended her polygamous lifestyle last night in Bran
ner Hall. Joseph married 18 years ago — to the husband of her two best friends and
four other women — and hasn't regretted it yet.
"My decision was a gamble, I'll
give you that," Joseph said. "It
wasn't the most informed deci
sion I've made."
She had been raised a
Methodist. Alex Joseph had con
verted to Mormonism in 1965 —
although he was excommunicated
from that church shortly before
marrying his second wife in 1970.
"I was a rabid liberal, as most
college students were in the early
19705," Elizabeth Joseph said.
"But this was mind boggling."
Her parents, too, had difficulty
accepting her decision. Her father
remained estranged for many years
until shortly before his death.
Today, Joseph lives in Big
Water, Utah, a town of about 350
people on the shores of Lake Pow
ell. Alex Joseph's wives — who
range in age from 21 to 45 — have
had 18 children so far. But because
Alex is 55, Elizabeth Joseph
expects him to "peter off" soon.
The family owns a large house —
which they call the "Long Haul" —
that has a living room capable of
seating 200 people for holidays. Sev
eral of the wives also have homes of

their own across the street and next
door to the large house.
"We like to say we're all within
spitting distance of one another,"
Joseph said, although she claims
that most of the wives get along well.
Recently, she said, all nine of
the wives held a birthday bash for
two of the wives — without Alex.
And she maintains extremely
close relationships with the other
wives because of their "shared
lives and shared commitments."
Alex Joseph is not legally mar
ried to all of his wives, as polygamy
is illegal.
Sex isn't a problem, Joseph said,
because women "do not have the
physical sexual drive of men." Sleep
ing arrangements are made by
appointment, with factors such as
work schedules and the wives' desire
for intimacy taken into account.
"When I crawl into bed with
him, it's not the taken-for-grant
ed, Monday night routine,"
Joseph said.
During the years of her mar
riage, Elizabeth Joseph has
become a spokesperson for the
polygamist movement. She wrote
an Op-Ed piece for the New York
Times last spring, and she said
her family has been the subject of
all sorts of media attention. When
she left Utah to come to Stanford,

she noted, the French equivalent
of "60 Minutes" was at her house
filming a segment.
Joseph said she and her family
disavow connections to any orga
nized religion — including Mor
monism. The polygamy of funda
mentalist Mormonism, in which
each sect's "prophet" decides
which man each woman will
marry, is completely unlike her
family's arrangement, she said.
Women in those situations
seem very "resigned," Joseph
said, while the women in her fam
ily have chosen for themselves.
Many Branner residents said
they were intrigued by Joseph's lec
ture, but remained unconvinced.
"I got a better understanding of
where she's coming from, but I still
don't agree with a lot of the things
she said," said senior Lisa Nellor,
one of the dormitory's resident
assistants. "There were faults in
some of her feminist statements."
Assoc. History Prof. Kennell
Jackson, Branner's resident fel
low, said that because he teaches
African history, polygamy was
nothing new to him.
But he said, "I don't think I've
seen people so spellbound in a long
time — and I've seen a lot of speak
ers here. It was a very persuasive,
interesting, well-crafted speech."

ture, but remained unconvinced.
"I got a better understanding of
where she's coming from, but I still
don't agree with a lot of the things
she said," said senior Lisa Nellor,
one of the dormitory's resident
assistants. "There were faults in
some of her feminist statements."
Assoc. History Prof. Kennell
Jackson, Branner's resident fel
low, said that because he teaches
African history, polygamy was
nothing new to him.
But he said, "I don't think I've
seen people so spellbound in a long
time — and I've seen a lot of speak
ers here. It was a very persuasive,
interesting, well-crafted speech."
Elizabeth Joseph is married to
a man with nine wives. And she
likes it.
"I'm married to a man nine
times the husband of any other
man," Joseph, 38, said in a speech
in Branner Hall's lounge last night.
"I'm madly in love with him."
Speaking to a crowd of about
50, Joseph declared that her deci
sion to enter into a polygamous
marriage is simply the logical end
of feminist rhetoric.
A criminal defense attorney,
Joseph, who has one daughter by
her husband of 18 years, Alex
Joseph, said she "embraced" the
feminist movement as a college
student. But now she criticizes its
"flawed premises" and blames it
for "two wasted decades."
Feminism, Joseph said,
requires women to juggle careers
and children — two goals that are
often incompatible. "My daugh
ter is not in a day care center,"
she said. "She is at home, with a
family, and I am free to work with
a clear head.
"Being barefoot and pregi.ant
was not in my life script," Joseph
said. "By entering a plural mar
riage, I made sure of that."
She married Alex Joseph in
1974, as his seventh wife. Two of
her closest friends had already
married him, she said, and they
"kept pestering him" to marry her
as well.

Elizabeth Joseph passionately defended her polygamous lifestyle last night in Bran
ner Hall. Joseph married 18 years ago — to the husband of her two best friends and
four other women — and hasn't regretted it yet.
"My decision was a gamble, I'll
give you that," Joseph said. "It
wasn't the most informed deci
sion I've made."
She had been raised a
Methodist. Alex Joseph had con
verted to Mormonism in 1965 —
although he was excommunicated
from that church shortly before
marrying his second wife in 1970.
"I was a rabid liberal, as most
college students were in the early
19705," Elizabeth Joseph said.
"But this was mind boggling."
Her parents, too, had difficulty
accepting her decision. Her father
remained estranged for many years
until shortly before his death.
Today, Joseph lives in Big
Water, Utah, a town of about 350
people on the shores of Lake Pow
ell. Alex Joseph's wives — who
range in age from 21 to 45 — have
had 18 children so far. But because
Alex is 55, Elizabeth Joseph
expects him to "peter off" soon.
The family owns a large house —
which they call the "Long Haul" —
that has a living room capable of
seating 200 people for holidays. Sev
eral of the wives also have homes of

their own across the street and next
door to the large house.
"We like to say we're all within
spitting distance of one another,"
Joseph said, although she claims
that most of the wives get along well.
Recently, she said, all nine of
the wives held a birthday bash for
two of the wives — without Alex.
And she maintains extremely
close relationships with the other
wives because of their "shared
lives and shared commitments."
Alex Joseph is not legally mar
ried to all of his wives, as polygamy
is illegal.
Sex isn't a problem, Joseph said,
because women "do not have the
physical sexual drive of men." Sleep
ing arrangements are made by
appointment, with factors such as
work schedules and the wives' desire
for intimacy taken into account.
"When I crawl into bed with
him, it's not the taken-for-grant
ed, Monday night routine,"
Joseph said.
During the years of her mar
riage, Elizabeth Joseph has
become a spokesperson for the
polygamist movement. She wrote
an Op-Ed piece for the New York
Times last spring, and she said
her family has been the subject of
all sorts of media attention. When
she left Utah to come to Stanford,

she noted, the French equivalent
of "60 Minutes" was at her house
filming a segment.
Joseph said she and her family
disavow connections to any orga
nized religion — including Mor
monism. The polygamy of funda
mentalist Mormonism, in which
each sect's "prophet" decides
which man each woman will
marry, is completely unlike her
family's arrangement, she said.
Women in those situations
seem very "resigned," Joseph
said, while the women in her fam
ily have chosen for themselves.
Many Branner residents said
they were intrigued by Joseph's lec
ture, but remained unconvinced.
