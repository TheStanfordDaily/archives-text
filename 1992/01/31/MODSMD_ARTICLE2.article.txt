Elizabeth Joseph is married to
a man with nine wives. And she
likes it.
"I'm married to a man nine
times the husband of any other
man," Joseph, 38, said in a speech
in Branner Hall's lounge last night.
"I'm madly in love with him."
Speaking to a crowd of about
50, Joseph declared that her deci
sion to enter into a polygamous
marriage is simply the logical end
of feminist rhetoric.
A criminal defense attorney,
Joseph, who has one daughter by
her husband of 18 years, Alex
Joseph, said she "embraced" the
feminist movement as a college
student. But now she criticizes its
"flawed premises" and blames it
for "two wasted decades."
Feminism, Joseph said,
requires women to juggle careers
and children — two goals that are
often incompatible. "My daugh
ter is not in a day care center,"
she said. "She is at home, with a
family, and I am free to work with
a clear head.
"Being barefoot and pregi.ant
was not in my life script," Joseph
said. "By entering a plural mar
riage, I made sure of that."
She married Alex Joseph in
1974, as his seventh wife. Two of
her closest friends had already
married him, she said, and they
"kept pestering him" to marry her
as well.

Elizabeth Joseph passionately defended her polygamous lifestyle last night in Bran
ner Hall. Joseph married 18 years ago — to the husband of her two best friends and
four other women — and hasn't regretted it yet.
