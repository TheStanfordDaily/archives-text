# Women's 2nd half surge beats Arizona
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
When you buy a new car, sometimes it
takes a while before you can drive it with
the same precision as your old one. Such is
the case for new Arizona women's basket
ball coach Joan Bonvicini.
After guiding the Long Beach State pro
gram the past 12 years to much success, and
having beaten the Cardinal six times in eight
tries during that tenure, no such smooth
highway exists at present for Bonvicini with
her navy Tuscon roadster. Stanford remind
ed her of that fact, beating the Wildcats 92-
77 last night in Maples Pavilion.
Though the score indicates the standard
easy Cardinal victory, the game was any
thing but. The ninth-place Wildcats came
out firing on all cylinders in the opening 20
minutes, shooting a scorching 56.7% from
the field. Arizona center Margo Clark led all
scorers with 18 points at the break.
Stanford's main problem in the first half
was the inability to get the ball inside to Val
Whiting, who scored only six points. This
lack of scoring was due in part to the switch
ing of Arizona's defensive schemes, the
most effective being a 2-3 matchup zone
which clogged the middle with two and
sometimes three defenders surrounding
Whiting whenever the Cardinal guards
looked to feed her the ball.
As a result, Stanford was forced to shoot
from the perimeter. Molly Goodenbour
chalked up 11 points, and Chris MacMurdo
added 10 off of the bench. At halflime, the
Stanford lead was a narrow two points, 46-44.
Coach Tara VanDerveer brought Stan
ford onto the floor in the second half as a
more focused defensive unit, and the team
responded. The Cardinal pushed the ball up
the floor after successfully applying defen
sive pressure, and was more patient in shot
selection. Stanford gradually extended the
lead to double figures midway through the
second half, and turned it on to lead by 18 at
the deep point.
Molly Goodenbour was instrumental in
the Cardinal surge. She finished with 23
points, including four for eight from three
point range.
"Molly shoots the ball well, pushes the
ball well, and is playing with confidence, and
the players have confidence in her," Van-
Derveer said. "Molly's strength is running,
and no one can keep up with her. She's a
track athlete and is very competitive."
"Working with (assistant coach) Julie
(Plank) and Tara has given me a lot more

confidence," Goodenbour said.
Chris MacMurdo's inside play helped
pick up the slack from Whiting. MacMurdo
tallied 17 points and nine rebounds in aid
ing the Cardinal effort.
"I could see that they were doubling on
Val. I knew I had to make up for missing
some outside shots by crashing and doing
some offensive rebounding," MacMurdo said.
Whiting was able to score 14 points and
grab four rebounds despite the tough Wild
cat defense. Two other Cardinal players
scored in double-figures: guard Christy
Hedgpeth had 12 points, and freshman
Rachel Hemmer posted a double-double
with 13 points and 11 rebounds.
Clark finished with 26 points, Shawn
Coder contributed 14, and Jacinda Sweet
had 10. Clark's effort was motivated by
playing against All-American candidate
Whiting.
"Val's a great player. I was pumped up to
play against her. She's one of the best play
ers in the country," Clark said.
There was a marked difference in atti
tude and style of play between this year's
Arizona team and last year's squad due to
Bonvicini's leadership.
"They're used to hanging their heads
and have been hardened by losing," said
Bonvicini, who took over a 6-25 team with
nine returning players. "I'm trying to
change the mentality. I'm going to coach
out there for 40 minutes, and I expect my
players to play for 40 minutes."
"I thought Arizona played extremely
well," VanDerveer said. "If that's the bot
tom of the league, then that shows how
good this league is."
Stanford faces 12-3 Arizona State tomor
row night.
