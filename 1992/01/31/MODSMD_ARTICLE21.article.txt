# Ice, ice, baby! Hoopsters frigid in 67-59 loss
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
PULLMAN - Adam Keefe shot a sea
son-low five of 15, and his Stanford
teammates were little better, as the
cold-shooting Cardinal succumbed to
Washington State 67-59 last night at
Friel Court.
Despite shooting 39 percent from the
field, Stanford led the host Cougars 57-
56. But the Cardinal saved its worst shoot
ing for the end, scoring just two points
in the final four minutes and 24 seconds.

Paul Garrett's layup with 2:17 left
was Stanford's final score of the night,
allowing WSU to come from behind for
the win.
"We're not going to win many games
when I go five for 15," said Keefe, who
had his worst shooting night of the sea
son, but still scored a game-high of 18
points. "I felt out of rhythm and not
really involved in the offense. When I'm
getting the ball, I'm rushing my shot."
And on a night when Keefe wasn't at
his best, the Cardinal got a total of one
point and two rebounds off the bench.

"We just need a win right now," said
guard Peter Dukes, who was whitewashed
from three-territory and scored four
points. "This is becoming an old habit:
teams are not letting me shoot the trey."
WSU had four players in double fig
ures, but is much less talented than
either USC or UCLA, two teams Stan
ford almost beat last week. If Stanford
had shot 39 percent against the No. 2
Bruins, it may have lost by 25 points.
"We had our chances to win, but we
let them slip away," said frustrated
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery. "We
were right there, but you have to make
the big play or you're not going to win."
Many of Stanford's 37 misses were
layups and open jumpers. With 36 sec
onds left and Stanford down 63-59,
both Keefe and Brent Williams missed
from point blank.
The third-best free throw shooting team
in the nation with a 77.9 percent team aver
age, WSU wouldn't give the game back to

Stanford after they had control.
The Cardinal stumbled on a 9-0 run
to take a 14-5 lead, but could have done
more damage.
In the first half Stanford shot an
Arctic nine-of-26, 34 percent from the
field, with Keefe uncharacteristically
missing three layups. The free throw
jitters traveled with the Cardinal all
the way to Pullman: Stanford missed
five free throws, including two one
and-one front ends.
"It was a game both teams really need
ed to win," said Washington State coach
Kelvin Sampson. "We showed tonight
we're a good — not great — team."
