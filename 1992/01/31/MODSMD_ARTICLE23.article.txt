# Women netters find victory at end of Rainbows

It was a battle to the end.
Heather Willens, playing No. 1
for the Stanford women's tennis
team, nailed a crosscourt back
hand winner. Laxmi Poruri, the
Cardinal's second seed, delicately
sliced an unreachable drop shot.
Both played dominant, in-your
face tennis.
But they weren't playing each
other. The suspense in the Stan
ford-Hawaii contest was who,
Willens or Poruri, would double
bagel her opponent first.
Willens had the lead over
Poruri for most of the match. She
ripped through the first set in a
matter of minutes and hit the
changeovers before Poruri during
most of the second set.
But, near the end of the
match, the Rainbows' Mina Hall
captured a game from Willens.
This gave Poruri the opening she
needed to finish off Jenny John
ston 6-0, 6-0.
Willens walked off the court
minutes later with a 6-0, 6-1 win.
"Yeah, we had a bet going," Wil
lens said with a grin. "I wanted to
hurry up and get off."
The other matches were only
slightly more competitive. Kylie
Johnson steamiolled Saiko Mat
sudo 6-0, 6-1 and Emma Wood
house beat Rene Koahou 6-3,6-0.
In her Cardinal dual-match

debut, Amy Chiminello dis
patched Casey Peterson in
straight sets while Mario Carruth
did the same to Justine Tate.
The doubles matches went 1-
2-3, literally. Hawaii tandems
could only manage to win one
game from Willens-Poruri, two
from Johnson-Woodhouse and
three from Chiminello-Carruth.
The No. 5 Stanford squad
knocked ofT the unranked Rain
bows without the services of
sophomore Kristine Kurth, who
was sidelined with a sore back.
"It doesn't hurt except when I
try to hit," Kurth said. "And I
haven't attempted a serve since
[injuring it]." The injury
occurred after the National Col
lege Classic in mid-January .
Kurth strained her back while
working on a new serve "I over
did it," she said. Sitting out this
weekend's matches, she may be
able to play next week.
The Cardinal hits the courts
again Saturday at noon to take on
the Washington Huskies. The
Utah Utes ride into town Sunday
for a 1 p.m. showdown with the
defending national champions.
