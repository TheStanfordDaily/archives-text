The Olympic year 1992, finds the men's
gymnastics team holding Olympian aspirations.
Coach Sadao Hamada has assembled the
strongest Stanford team in his twenty years of
coaching, one that boasts three potential mem
bers of the United States team that will com
pete in Barcelona.
"This is the most exciting year for me,"
Hamada said. "We have a great shot at the
[Pacific 10 Conference) Championships, the
NCAA Championships, and placing a couple of
guys on the Olympic team."
The team is led by Tim Ryan, the 1989
NCAA all-around champion. Ryan, a senior, has
fully recovered from a wrist injury
he suffered two years ago and will
be gunning for a spot on the
Olympic team. The other Olympic
hopefuls are Jair Lynch, a junior,
and Mark Booth, a sophomore.
In addition to improved health,
the team's added depth could
prove the difference in Stanford's
pursuit of a national title. The
spot of Tim Wyang, lost to gradu
ation, has been filled by Josh
Stein, a freshman whom Hamada
says is even better than Wyang.
Having combined outstanding
athletic talent with depth, Hama
da brims with confidence over his

squad's potential. He perceives
UCLA as the only threat (and a
marginal one at that) for the Car
dinal on the road to the Pac-lOs
in March.
The coach is more concerned
with the NCAAs in Lincoln, Neb.
this April, where Nebraska and
Minnesota will be Stanford's
main rivals.
Stanford can qualify for the
NCAA Championships by placing
in the top four at the Western
Regional Championships.
Most of Stanford's top gym
nasts will not compete in tomor
row's competition at Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo. Hamada is resting
many of his starters for the U.S.
Gymnastics Federation's Winter
Nationals in Colorado Springs the
following weekend.
