# Stanford ruggers round up rowdy Broncos, 22-10

During last year's Pacific Coast playoffs
the Stanford ruggers nipped the Santa
Clara Broncos in the semifinals, sending the
Broncos home bitter and hungry for anoth
er try. But this past Saturday Stanford
showed it still had the juice to remain victo
rious, winning 22-10.
Improving their conference record to 2-0,
the Cardinal had a difficult time roping the
Broncos. "They were tough, real tough,"
said captain John Hamilton.
In the opening moments of play, it

looked as if the Cardinal ruggers were going
to have an easy game. Stanford came out
hard and attacked Santa Clara, scoring eas
ily in the first ten minutes of play.
But afler this initial surge the Cardinal
folded and allowed the Broncos back in the
game. "We quickly lost our aggressiveness. I
should've eaten my Wheaties," Hamilton
said.
Only minutes afler Stanford scored, the
Bronco forward pack bucked into the try
zone to tie the score at 6-6. The game
remained close over the next hour, and with
only ten minutes left to play the score stood

16-10 in favor of Stanford.
However, the Cardinal pulled together
for a gutsy finish. In an awesome display
of passing skills by both forwards and
backs, the ball made its way into the capa
ble hands of scrumhalf Kevin Linker.
Speedy Linker blew by two defenders to
score a try with only minutes left. After a
successful point-after kick, the score tal
lied 22-10.
Stanford was happy to have won, but not
at all pleased with their quality of play. "We
did the things we needed to do," coach
Franck Boivert said, "but we did not play

defense well."
However, the Card definitely improved
their play over last week's shaky victory
against UC-Santa Cruz where Stanford
turned the ball over 22 times.
"My primary concern this game against
Santa Clara was that we held onto the ball,
and we did that, but we have a lot to do over
the next month," Boivert said.
Stanford has an opportunity to redeem
itself this Saturday against Sacramento
State. Play begins at 1 p.m. at Maloney Field
for the first side. The second side plays on the
IM fields at 3 p.m.
