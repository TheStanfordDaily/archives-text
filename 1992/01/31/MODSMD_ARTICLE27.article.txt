# Gymnasts in 'Cat fight tonight
## 
### Brandi Shipp Staff writer 
With barely enough time to
take a breath, the Stanford
women's gymnastics team, com
ing off of Monday's disappointing
loss on Monday, faces off against
Arizona tonight at Burnham.
The Cardinal women were in
Logan Monday for a duel competi
tion against the gymnasts of Utah
State. Although they had a good
meet, their performance fell short
of the mark.
"We had a chance to have a
really good meet, but we let our
selves down on vault," coach
Breck Greenwood said.

The gymnasts have bounced
back from the loss with increased
enthusiasm for tonight's tough
competition. Despite having only
three days in between meets, the
Cardinal women have done every
thing in their power to ensure them
selves a solid performance tonight.
"We left straight from the.air
port to the gym for practice on
Tuesday," Greenwood said. In
preparation for tonight's competi
tion, the Stanford gymnasts have
put much effort into improving
their vaulting, the event that has
been the most inconsistent for
them in the past few meets. In
fact, some of the gymnasts volun
tarily went in this morning for

extra vault practice. "We just want
to be ready," Greenwood said.
Besides working vault, the
Cardinal have also made some
other changes in their program
for tonight. Junior Erin McCann
and freshman sensation Jene
Elzie have both added some diffi
culty in their routines, and, for
the first time this season, sopho
more Kerri Kanuka will be in the
all-around competition.
Despite all of their prepara
tion, however, a win against Ari
zona is far from ensured, as they
are known as a perennial power
house is women's gymnastics —
last year's gymnasts finished
among the nation's top 10 teams.
