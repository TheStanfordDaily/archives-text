# Feline or canine? Let's fight like dogs

### 
As usual, while trying to come up
with some random topic to write
about this week, I picked up a
newspaper. After a while, I even start
ed to read it, but Mr. Boffo wasn't par
ticularly enlightening, and I was
forced to move on to more depressing
parts of the paper.
Eventually, after reading about war
and death and the economy and the
ecosystem and Mrs. Ida Foonhauser's
gripping account of being kidnapped
by space lobsters, I started wondering
what was wrong with this planet of
ours. I got to thinking about the root of
all of our problems — the core of our
misunderstandings, the fundamental
source that prevents humanity from
finally achieving true peace with our
selves.
Inevitably, I decided to write about
cats.
Now, I realize that some of you
actually like these conniving little fur
covered lumps of concentrated evil,
but through my experience I have
come to realize that cats are simply

Dear Bug Me,
Why?

Why not?
Urban legend has it that the
above lines are the sole question
of a philosophy final exam and
the A-I- response, respectively.
But when I spoke to a friend of
mine, who is a philosophy major,
about the possibility of this story
being true, he became extremely
perturbed. He said the story
"sounds intensely apocryphal and
mildly stupid. . . . The more I
think, the more stupid it sounds.
Any philosophy professor at
Stanford would be insulted if you
asked if he did that on a philoso
phy exam. One wants to write
questions so as to discourage
blithering aimlessness. It is diffi
cult to imagine a worse question
than 'Why?' "
My god, these intellectual
wanna-bes are insufferable,
aren't they? If he's really so
smart, why isn't he a physicist or
something productive like that?
The underlying problem here
is that philosophy is at the bot
tom of the intellectual food chain,
but someone forgot to let the phi
losophy majors in on the secret.
Dear Bug Me,
Where does the "Reclaimed
Water" Stanford is using to water
its plants come from ?

compassion level of concrete.
Let's face it; the only time cats are
nice to you is when they want food or
attention, and the only reason they
coexist with you is because you're 20
times their size. I hesitate to imagine
what would happen if this ratio were
suddenly reversed. No doubt the cat
would keep you alive just so it could
have something to play with, probably
spending several hours discovering
which noises you make when different
pieces of flesh are gouged out of your
body.

Last spring I had a discussion
with a friend of mine regarding
the healing powers of quartz crys
tals. She claimed that the crystal
she wore about her neck emitted
some form of energy, and that
this energy had healing and
regenerative powers.
I, as any even remotely sane
person would, informed her that
that was a load of hooey. The
ensuing discourse lasted the bet
ter part of an hour, with both par
ties thinking significantly less of
each other at its end.
The following evening my friend
informed me that she had "lost her
crystal amulet" that day, during
windsurfing class at Felt Lake.
"You mean you lost your
quartz pendant?" I asked.
"Crystal amulet," she replied
curtly. Then she demanded to
know how the crystal's energy
would be able to reach her from
the bottom of a lake two miles
south of campus.
"Same way as it would if it
were hanging around your neck:
It won't," I replied.
She went on to inform me that,
because of the negative energy
associated with my perfidious
comments about crystals, I was
wholly to blame for its loss.
Two weeks later, finally on
speaking terms again, we were
walking on campus when a nearby
set of sprinklers turned on. One of
the sprinkler heads had been
knocked off, so there was a five
foot-high fountain of water surg
ing out from a headless sprinkler
pipe. As we walked by, her quartz
pendant shot out of the pipe and
remained suspended there, riding
atop the fountain of water. Upon
examining it, there was no doubt
that it was the same pendant.
So, there you go, the water
isn't really "reclaimed." It just
comes from Felt Lake. A call to
the nice people at Water and
Sewer Support and Maintenance
confirmed that this is indeed the
case. They also mentioned that
the lake is filled from Los Trancos
Creek during the rainy season.

In case you haven't guessed, I'm a
dog person. And even though dogs are
smelly and stupid, and have a strange
habit of sticking their nose in your
crotch, at least they actually like peo
ple and have a sense of humor.
One example of this is how dogs can
get scruffed up and knocked about and
still come up smiling like an idiot. Try
play-wrestling a cat, and see how long
it takes before your face resembles a
Little Caesar's "Meatsa-Meatsa" spe
cial.
It's just that dogs get a bad rap
because they bark at everything that
surprises them, and just about every
thing is surprising because they have
the brain power of a Frito.
The reason that dogs always freak
out at the mailman is because, as far as
the dog is concerned, this strange per
son has never, ever been to your house
before. In fact, all four of a dog's mem
ory-function brain cells are devoted to
remembering their own name, which
would probably be forgotten if they
didn't hear it 95 times a day.

But there's nothing wrong with a
stupid pet, and it often serves to make
life a little more interesting. (Mom!
Spitty got his ear caught in the dust
buster again!)
Then again, not all dogs are cool.
Here I'm specifically thinking about
those miniature little "punting" dogs
that have obviously landed on this
planet from outer space.
I say this not only because they
contain more energy than is explain
able by natural physical laws, but
also because there is no way in hell
that these things could have
evolved through natural selection. I
just keep picturing these tiny fur
balls running around in the wild,
yipping ferociously at anything that
moves. "Look!" the other animals
would say. "Twinkies!"
But regardless, I still think dogs are
awesome, and the only good kind of cat
is one that's in a drug-induced coma.

Ken Wharton would really appreciate
some hate mail.
