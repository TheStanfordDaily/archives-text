# Laptop lectures serve deaf students
## 
### Grace Lee 
During his undergraduate years, deaf student
Teddy Chen said he skipped classes all the time.
"My time was better spent getting work done, study
ing or even sleeping," said Chen, a first-year student at
the Law School who formerly used oral interpreting and
had a word-recognition rate of 30 to 50 percent.
Now, using the latest computer technology, Chen
and another graduate student are trying a new
method that allows them to read lectures from lap
top screens as they happen.
The accuracy of simultaneous, or real-time, steno
captioning varies from 85 to 95 percent, which is a
"vast improvement" according to Chen. "I personally
think that steno-captioning is a major, leap," he said.
While a stenographer enters the verbal exchange,
at a rate of 220 words per minute, into a court-report
ing stenography machine, the student's computer
translates the coded keystrokes into written English.
Up until now, this method of simultaneous trans
lation for people who are deaf or hearing-impaired
has been used mostly on television and in court
rooms. The Law School is one of the first education
al institutions in the country to use steno-captioning
in the classroom.
"I think it's the optimal service to have," said
Debby Kajiyama, steno-captioning and interpreter
services coordinator at the Disability Resource Cen
ter.
Steno-captioning offers many advantages to

other widely-used translation methods such as
American Sign Language interpreting or English
based oral interpreting. In addition to greatly
increasing students' rate of comprehension, it also
allows the students to divert their attention for a
moment without missing anything.
"It's easier [for the student] to read a screen than
to read someone's lips for an hour-and-a-half," said
John Asheim, program coordinator at the DRC.
Although steno-captioning is a welcome innova
tion for deaf students, there are still a few wrinkles
to smooth out. "It's in its infancy as far as working
out all the details," said Sarah Elkatanani, a stenog
rapher who volunteered her services in the fall.
She noted that finding qualified steno-captioners
for the classroom can pose a problem, as most are
lured into the more lucrative field of court reporting.
Kajiyama agreed, adding that the service of past vol
unteer steno-captioners has been "invaluable."
Despite the current lack of stenographers,
Elkatanani said she is very optimistic about the
future of steno-captioning in the classroom. She
suggested that with adequate funding, the program
could be expanded to serve young children as well as
college students.
While the demand for steno-captioning at Stan
ford is not tremendous at this point, the DRC is will
ing to provide the service for any hearing-impaired
student who is interested in it, Asheim said. For the
students who have used it, "It's revolutionized
[their] time in the classroom."

Teddy Chen, a deaf law student, used to skip classes because he didn't get anything out of the lectures.
But with a new service provided by steno-captioners like Jane James, Chen can read the professor's
words on a laptop computer seconds after they are spoken.
