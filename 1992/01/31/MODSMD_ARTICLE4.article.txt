Senior Stuart Thomas and his attorney, Melvin de la Motte, field questions from the press at the Santa Clara County Supe
rior Court after Thomas was sentenced to community service and a $1,000 fine for two misdemeanor charges including
statutory rape.
bargain last month, Hastings
indicated that he would assign
"up to one hundred hours."
De la Motte said he was not
surprised at the sentence. Hast
ings "followed the terms and con
ditions we had negotiated earlier.
It's nothing different."
Thomas will decide on the type
of service along with de la Motte.
When asked what Thomas
intended to do, de la Motte
replied, "There are hundreds of
different charities."
Thomas has completed enough
units to earn his degree from Stan
ford and is preparing to attend law
school, de la Motte said.
The University is holding
Thomas' diploma while it con
ducts an independent investiga
tion. If he is found guilty of mis
conduct, his degree may be sus
pended for a specific number of
quarters.
De la Motte said that because

of the initially serious charges,
the case has "cost. . . more finan
cially than it ever should have."
Thomas' family has spent
$20,000 to $30,000 on attorney
fees, he said.
De la Motte also said the Stan
ford Police investigation and the
press reports have "blown (this
case) out of proportion." It was
"characterized as a rape case," but
the victim did not make any state
ments in the police report or to the
probation office that there were
"any elements that would consti
tute a rape case," de la Motte said.
"She indicated that she felt her
judgement was clouded because
she consumed alcohol and that
she felt my client was ... 'smooth
and persuasive,' " he added.
According to police reports, the
victim said Thomas did not use
physical force. But she said she
would not have had intercourse
with him if he had not given her
alcohol, and that she felt a "cer
tain coercion" from his presence.
Neither the victim nor her
family were present at the sen
tencing.

Thomas declined to comment
on the outcome of the case.
Condron said the sentence was
what she had expected, and she
was "pleased" that community
service was assigned "as much as
possible in a related area.
"This will perhaps enable him
to become sensitized to the issues
and to the needs and feelings of
rape victims," she said.
Susan Epstein, coordinator of
student sexual assault prevention
education, said she "didn't expect
a whole lot more after" the plea
bargain.
"Based on what I have read in
the paper, I think Thomas would
benefit from volunteer work relat
ed to rape counseling," she said.
But she said working with vic
tims might introduce a "weird
dynamic," and Thomas should
probably spend his community
service in programs separate from
victims.
Epstein also said she wondered
why the judge recommended that
Thomas work in rape counseling
when he was only charged with
statutory rape.

of the initially serious charges,
the case has "cost. . . more finan
cially than it ever should have."
Thomas' family has spent
$20,000 to $30,000 on attorney
fees, he said.
De la Motte also said the Stan
ford Police investigation and the
press reports have "blown (this
case) out of proportion." It was
"characterized as a rape case," but
the victim did not make any state
ments in the police report or to the
probation office that there were
"any elements that would consti
tute a rape case," de la Motte said.
"She indicated that she felt her
judgement was clouded because
she consumed alcohol and that
she felt my client was ... 'smooth
and persuasive,' " he added.
According to police reports, the
victim said Thomas did not use
physical force. But she said she
would not have had intercourse
with him if he had not given her
alcohol, and that she felt a "cer
tain coercion" from his presence.
Neither the victim nor her
family were present at the sen
tencing.

Thomas declined to comment
on the outcome of the case.
Condron said the sentence was
what she had expected, and she
was "pleased" that community
service was assigned "as much as
possible in a related area.
"This will perhaps enable him
to become sensitized to the issues
and to the needs and feelings of
rape victims," she said.
Susan Epstein, coordinator of
student sexual assault prevention
education, said she "didn't expect
a whole lot more after" the plea
bargain.
"Based on what I have read in
the paper, I think Thomas would
benefit from volunteer work relat
ed to rape counseling," she said.
But she said working with vic
tims might introduce a "weird
dynamic," and Thomas should
probably spend his community
service in programs separate from
victims.
Epstein also said she wondered
why the judge recommended that
Thomas work in rape counseling
when he was only charged with
statutory rape.
