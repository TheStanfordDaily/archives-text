## Frustration, sleep deprivation cost of budget input for students 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
As the University makes its $43
million budget cut, a group of students
has taken on thousands more pages of
reading and seemingly endless meet
ings in order to participate in the deci
sion-making.
And they say they have gained a
unique insight into the complexities
and demands of the process and the
ways it will affect students.
"Personally, it was definitely inter
esting, but it was frustrating," said
sophomore Stefanie Huie of her work

as a student member of the Student
Resources ad-hoc budget committee.
"It was stressful to sit there and say,
'We're going ta cut these services.' "
Huie was one of about 30 students
appointed by the ASSU to faculty and
staff budget committees in various
schools and divisions. They were
required to study the departments and
offices in-depth and make recommen
dations on what should be cut.
"It was very challenging," said
junior Tracy Clay, adding that she got
a close-up view of the difficulties in
reducing the budget.
Many students don't realize "it's an

extremely complex process with many
layers," she said. Clay's work on the
Residential Education committee will
include helping to make such decisions
as whether to cut the number of resi
dent assistants or reduce their
salaries.
"The volume of work was stagger
ing," said Clay, who attended budget
committee meetings once a week since
November and regularly met with
administrators.

member of the student advisory board

'The whole process
is frustrating. It's
meeting after meet
ing. You get tired
pretty quickly.'
