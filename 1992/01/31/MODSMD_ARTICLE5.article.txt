# Making their voices heard
## Frustration, sleep deprivation cost of budget input for students 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
As the University makes its $43
million budget cut, a group of students
has taken on thousands more pages of
reading and seemingly endless meet
ings in order to participate in the deci
sion-making.
And they say they have gained a
unique insight into the complexities
and demands of the process and the
ways it will affect students.
"Personally, it was definitely inter
esting, but it was frustrating," said
sophomore Stefanie Huie of her work

as a student member of the Student
Resources ad-hoc budget committee.
"It was stressful to sit there and say,
'We're going ta cut these services.' "
Huie was one of about 30 students
appointed by the ASSU to faculty and
staff budget committees in various
schools and divisions. They were
required to study the departments and
offices in-depth and make recommen
dations on what should be cut.
"It was very challenging," said
junior Tracy Clay, adding that she got
a close-up view of the difficulties in
reducing the budget.
Many students don't realize "it's an

extremely complex process with many
layers," she said. Clay's work on the
Residential Education committee will
include helping to make such decisions
as whether to cut the number of resi
dent assistants or reduce their
salaries.
"The volume of work was stagger
ing," said Clay, who attended budget
committee meetings once a week since
November and regularly met with
administrators.
ASSU senator Jason Snyder, a
member of the student advisory board

'The whole process
is frustrating. It's
meeting after meet
ing. You get tired
pretty quickly.'
— Jason Snyder
for the Haas Public Service Cen
ter, said, "The whole process is
frustrating. It's meeting after
meeting. You get tired pretty
quickly."
Snyder has tried to find ways
for Haas to cut $100,000 —
roughly 17 percent of its budget
— which involves many meetings
with administrators "to stay
informed" on the process.
English graduate student G.E.
Light, a member of committees
on graduate housing and Student
Resources, said he has enjoyed
the chance "to see innovative
ideas people came up with to deal
effectively with the budget crisis."
Like many of the others, Light
said he got involved because he
wanted "to be able to have some
immediate input on the way the
decisions were being made." To
do this, he spent up to 10 hours a
week last quarter in meetings in
addition to reading as many as
1000 pages of material a week.
In spite of all this, he said, "For
the importance of the decisions
being made, it didn't seem like an
inordinate amount of time."

Not all of the student partici
pation in the budget process
involved committees. Council of
Presidents member Beth Morgan
said she has spent about 15 hours
a week meeting with administra
tors, listening to student concerns
and writing letters as part of her
effort "to represent what, in my
opinion, students would like" the
University to cut from its budget.
"It's a growing experience,"
she said. "At times you love it, at
times you hate it." Morgan added
that the actual work has at time
been "miserable," but looking
back she feels great about what
she's accomplished.
As a senator, Snyder has
assembled ASSU budget recom
mendations, facilitated town
meetings and talked with admin
istrators and other senators
about budget issues.
Being involved with the budget
cutting decisions has also given
these students a new perspective
on the effects of the reductions.
Many students will "have to
admit we simply aren't going to be
able to do some things," said Clay.
"Things are just not going to
be convenient" for students, Huie
said, as effects of cuts may range
from more time spent in lines to
less undergraduate advising.

But Light looked on the bright
side. "No one's really going to
notice in some areas," and when
current students graduate, "no
one else is going to know (the elim
inated programs) were ever here."
Yet "it's going to be hard for
the people who are here and have
certain expectations that aren't
going to be met," said Light.
The students also said the time
spent on the committees kept
them from their other activities.
"It definitely takes time away
from the other things," Morgan
said. She added that she has had
less time to work on ASSU pro
jects, such as putting together an
ASSU course guide and organizing
a leadership summit next month.
Clay, a public policy major car
rying 20 units, also volunteers
eight hours a week at a shelter for
homeless women, is a peer adviser
at the Clearinghouse — a public
service group at Haas — and
hosts Voice, a talk show on X r l r V.
With all of this work plus the
budget committee, "it got to be a
strain towards the end of the
quarter," Clay said.
Most seemed to agree that the
largest sacrifice they had to make
was sleep.
"Sleep deprivation was the
biggest problem," Snyder said.

"It was very challenging," said
junior Tracy Clay, adding that she got
a close-up view of the difficulties in
reducing the budget.
Many students don't realize "it's an

extremely complex process with many
layers," she said. Clay's work on the
Residential Education committee will
include helping to make such decisions
as whether to cut the number of resi
dent assistants or reduce their
salaries.
"The volume of work was stagger
ing," said Clay, who attended budget
committee meetings once a week since
November and regularly met with
administrators.
ASSU senator Jason Snyder, a
member of the student advisory board

'The whole process
is frustrating. It's
meeting after meet
ing. You get tired
pretty quickly.'
— Jason Snyder
for the Haas Public Service Cen
ter, said, "The whole process is
frustrating. It's meeting after
meeting. You get tired pretty
quickly."
Snyder has tried to find ways
for Haas to cut $100,000 —
roughly 17 percent of its budget
— which involves many meetings
with administrators "to stay
informed" on the process.
English graduate student G.E.
Light, a member of committees
on graduate housing and Student
Resources, said he has enjoyed
the chance "to see innovative
ideas people came up with to deal
effectively with the budget crisis."
Like many of the others, Light
said he got involved because he
wanted "to be able to have some
immediate input on the way the
decisions were being made." To
do this, he spent up to 10 hours a
week last quarter in meetings in
addition to reading as many as
1000 pages of material a week.
In spite of all this, he said, "For
the importance of the decisions
being made, it didn't seem like an
inordinate amount of time."

Not all of the student partici
pation in the budget process
involved committees. Council of
Presidents member Beth Morgan
said she has spent about 15 hours
a week meeting with administra
tors, listening to student concerns
and writing letters as part of her
effort "to represent what, in my
opinion, students would like" the
University to cut from its budget.
"It's a growing experience,"
she said. "At times you love it, at
times you hate it." Morgan added
that the actual work has at time
been "miserable," but looking
back she feels great about what
she's accomplished.
As a senator, Snyder has
assembled ASSU budget recom
mendations, facilitated town
meetings and talked with admin
istrators and other senators
about budget issues.
Being involved with the budget
cutting decisions has also given
these students a new perspective
on the effects of the reductions.
Many students will "have to
admit we simply aren't going to be
able to do some things," said Clay.
"Things are just not going to
be convenient" for students, Huie
said, as effects of cuts may range
from more time spent in lines to
less undergraduate advising.

But Light looked on the bright
side. "No one's really going to
notice in some areas," and when
current students graduate, "no
one else is going to know (the elim
inated programs) were ever here."
Yet "it's going to be hard for
the people who are here and have
certain expectations that aren't
going to be met," said Light.
The students also said the time
spent on the committees kept
them from their other activities.
"It definitely takes time away
from the other things," Morgan
said. She added that she has had
less time to work on ASSU pro
jects, such as putting together an
ASSU course guide and organizing
a leadership summit next month.
Clay, a public policy major car
rying 20 units, also volunteers
eight hours a week at a shelter for
homeless women, is a peer adviser
at the Clearinghouse — a public
service group at Haas — and
hosts Voice, a talk show on X r l r V.
With all of this work plus the
budget committee, "it got to be a
strain towards the end of the
quarter," Clay said.
Most seemed to agree that the
largest sacrifice they had to make
was sleep.
"Sleep deprivation was the
biggest problem," Snyder said.
As the University makes its $43
million budget cut, a group of students
has taken on thousands more pages of
reading and seemingly endless meet
ings in order to participate in the deci
sion-making.
And they say they have gained a
unique insight into the complexities
and demands of the process and the
ways it will affect students.
"Personally, it was definitely inter
esting, but it was frustrating," said
sophomore Stefanie Huie of her work

as a student member of the Student
Resources ad-hoc budget committee.
"It was stressful to sit there and say,
'We're going ta cut these services.' "
Huie was one of about 30 students
appointed by the ASSU to faculty and
staff budget committees in various
schools and divisions. They were
required to study the departments and
offices in-depth and make recommen
dations on what should be cut.
