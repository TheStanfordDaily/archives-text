# Artists breathe sigh of relief Budget ax spares photography, design
## 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
Budget reductions in the Art Depart
ment will be less severe than originally
expected, but some students and professors
say they remain concerned.
Earlier this week, department chair
Paul Turner announced that photography
and design, two programs considered in
November for significant reductions or
elimination, will be left mostly intact.
The reduction plans will affect the
design program more than photography. A
currently vacant professor position will be
cut, leaving Prof. Matthew Kahn as the
only tenured professor in the program.
But Kahn, who has been with Stanford for
more than 40 years, said he is wary of the news.

Dialogue between the Art department
and Humanities and Sciences continues,
Kahn said. "I think there may be more in
the wings than we know about."
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Rolf
Paste had similar sentiments. "This whole
subject is still very confused," he said.
In the memorandum announcing the
cuts, Turner wrote that he has been
assured by Carolyn Lougee, the associate
dean of Humanities and Sciences, that "no
cuts in the curriculum will be made that
adversely affect any students, graduate or
undergraduate, presently enrolled in the
design program."
Lougee could not be reached for com
ment yesterday.
