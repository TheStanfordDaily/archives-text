# Artists breathe sigh of relief Budget ax spares photography, design
## 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
Budget reductions in the Art Depart
ment will be less severe than originally
expected, but some students and professors
say they remain concerned.
Earlier this week, department chair
Paul Turner announced that photography
and design, two programs considered in
November for significant reductions or
elimination, will be left mostly intact.
The reduction plans will affect the
design program more than photography. A
currently vacant professor position will be
cut, leaving Prof. Matthew Kahn as the
only tenured professor in the program.
But Kahn, who has been with Stanford for
more than 40 years, said he is wary of the news.

Dialogue between the Art department
and Humanities and Sciences continues,
Kahn said. "I think there may be more in
the wings than we know about."
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Rolf
Paste had similar sentiments. "This whole
subject is still very confused," he said.
In the memorandum announcing the
cuts, Turner wrote that he has been
assured by Carolyn Lougee, the associate
dean of Humanities and Sciences, that "no
cuts in the curriculum will be made that
adversely affect any students, graduate or
undergraduate, presently enrolled in the
design program."
Lougee could not be reached for com
ment yesterday.
Turner also said it was possible
that the design position could be
reinstated in the long term.
He added that the entire studio
art curriculum will be examined by
Prof. David Hannah, along with out
side experts, to make recommenda
tions on how to strengthen it.
Kahn and Faste were less opti
mistic.
Faste said the cut would directly
affect the product design major, a
combination of art and engineer
ing.

"There are typical fundamental
differences between engineering
and art and our program success
fully merged the two," he said.
Faculty and students not as
closely involved with the design
program expressed relief that the
cuts were smaller than previously
expected.
Jonathan Ball, a junior in art
history, said he was at Stanford in
Paris when the news of the impend
ing cuts reached him. "I'm glad for
the most part it is over," he said.
Senior Art Lecturer Joel
Leivick said he thought the many
vocal supporters, including muse
um curators, artists and alumni,
helped make a difference.
