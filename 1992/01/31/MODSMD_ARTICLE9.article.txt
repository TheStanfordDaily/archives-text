China seeks freer economy
DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) â€” Chinese Premier
Li Peng appeals yesterday for Western help in
freeing China's economy, but rejected any change
in the Communist political system.
Li, on his first visit to the West since the 1989
crackdown on the democracy movement, told the
opening session of the privately organized World
Economic Forum that China would accelerate its
opening of markets and enterprises to foreigners.
"China's modernization cannot do without
economic and technological cooperation and
exchanges with other countries," he said.
Already, he said, more than 17,000 joint ventures
and foreign-owned enterprises have been estab
lished in China, and more opportunity awaits in
Shanghai, which is being developed further.

Dreaming while you sleep
PRESTONSBURG, Ky. (AP) - A woman sued
the maker of the sleeping drug Halcion yesterday,
claiming the pills drove her husband to commit
suicide.
Mary Ann Johnson of Weeksbury said in her
suit that the Upjohn Co. lied to federal officials
about the drug's side effects and acted negligent
ly in marketing the drug.
She claims those misrepresentations led to the
Feb. 15, 1991, suicide of her 59-year-old husband,
Billy Virgil Johnson. She also said her husband's
mental attitude changed and he lost weight after
he began taking the medication.
The suit's claims echo those of Dr. Lan Oswald,
a Scottish psychiatrist who told The New York
Times earlier this month that the drug was unsafe.
