# McFaul examines forces in Russian defeat
## 
### Julia Sobrevilla Editorial staff 
Late last year the world wit
nessed the close of an era as the
Soviet Union dissolved.
"It's the end of an empire,"
said Michael McFaul, a visiting
research fellow at the Hoover
Institution who returned from
Russia two weeks ago. "Russia is
a country that has been defeated
in a war without a war."
But contrary to what many
people think, the defeat involved
many forces other than Boris
Yeltsin and Mikhail Gorbachev,
McFaul said.
McFaul, a Stanford graduate
who worked as a consultant for
the MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour,
did research for a new book on
non-communist parties and
groups in Russia.
One of the major groups
McFaul studied was Democratic
Russia, a coalition of 16 opposi
tion parties formed in October
1990 that "brought together basi
cally everybody who opposed the
communist system," he said.
But after the failure of last
August's coup, the coalition
found itself struggling to survive.
Although the leaders of the
coalition are "totally unknown
figures to people in the West,"
McFaul said that "in terms of the
history of why this system col
lapsed, these people have a lot to
do with it."
The coalition organized mas
sive demonstrations against the

Communist system even before
the August 1991 coup attempt.
According to McFaul, Democratic
Russia joined Yeltsin in resisting
that coup.
Although Yeltsin was not an
official member of Democratic
Russia, he was appointed its hon
orary leader.
The coalition was organized to
fight hard-line Communists with
in the old regime, McFaul said.
When the coup failed, the coali
tion began to break up as differ
ences between members began to
surface.
According to McFaul, two
issues currently divide Democrat
ic Russia. The main controversy
within the coalition is whether the
former union should be restored.
At one end is the radical per
spective supported by Yuri
Afanasyev, who supports Russian
independence.
The other end of the spectrum
is represented by Nikolai Travkin,
who believes the union should be
restored at all costs. Travkin is the
leader of the Democratic Party of
Russia, a member of the Demo
cratic Russia coalition.
The second issue is privatiza
tion and the development of a
market economy.
Moving from a centralized
economy to a market economy is
"a pretty incredible task if you're
doing it in Hungary or Poland,"
McFaul said. "It's another thing
when you're doing it across this

huge country."
The liberal, "neo-Thatcherite"
group wants to privatize everything
as quickly as possible to create a
market economy, McFaul said.
Hut social-democratic and
republican parties argue that if pri
vatization starts happening now,
only the former Communists will
be able to buy anything. According
to McFaul, the result would be a
democracy in name only.
"In my opinion it's a little too
soon for the coalition to be divid
ing up," he said. "There's not a

unified support from the
democrats toward the economic
reform package of Yeltsin."
Yeltsin also faces threats from
the Communist Party and the
military. McFaul described the
Communists as a small but highly
organized group.
"They may never win an elec
tion, but they may win in a revo
lutionary situation," he said.
"The military, of course, wants
a united military," McFaul added.
But "each of the different
republics, and in particular
Ukraine, wants its own."
In addition, many different fas
cist organizations are springing
up in Russia. The most prominent
is the Liberal Democratic Party,

led by Vladimir Zhiranovsky.
Zhiranovsky was virtually
unknown until the Russian presi
dential elections in June, where he
obtained 6 percent of the vote, com
ing in third out of six candidates.
"He'll say whatever he has to
say for support," McFaul said. "In
his campaign one of the big sellers
was saying he would sell vodka at
subsidized prices."
Despite these problems,
McFaul remains fairly optimistic.
"My gut feeling is that this
transition ... is going to make it,"
he said. "But I don't preclude the
possibility of some storming of
the Kremlin, people dying, riots
and a whole new set of characters
coming to play."

the Communist Party and the
military. McFaul described the
Communists as a small but highly
organized group.
"They may never win an elec
tion, but they may win in a revo
lutionary situation," he said.
"The military, of course, wants
a united military," McFaul added.
But "each of the different
republics, and in particular
Ukraine, wants its own."
In addition, many different fas
cist organizations are springing
up in Russia. The most prominent
is the Liberal Democratic Party,

led by Vladimir Zhiranovsky.
Zhiranovsky was virtually
unknown until the Russian presi
dential elections in June, where he
obtained 6 percent of the vote, com
ing in third out of six candidates.
"He'll say whatever he has to
say for support," McFaul said. "In
his campaign one of the big sellers
was saying he would sell vodka at
subsidized prices."
Despite these problems,
McFaul remains fairly optimistic.
"My gut feeling is that this
transition ... is going to make it,"
he said. "But I don't preclude the
possibility of some storming of
the Kremlin, people dying, riots
and a whole new set of characters
coming to play."
Late last year the world wit
nessed the close of an era as the
Soviet Union dissolved.
"It's the end of an empire,"
said Michael McFaul, a visiting
research fellow at the Hoover
Institution who returned from
Russia two weeks ago. "Russia is
a country that has been defeated
in a war without a war."
But contrary to what many
people think, the defeat involved
many forces other than Boris
Yeltsin and Mikhail Gorbachev,
McFaul said.
McFaul, a Stanford graduate
who worked as a consultant for
the MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour,
did research for a new book on
non-communist parties and
groups in Russia.
One of the major groups
McFaul studied was Democratic
Russia, a coalition of 16 opposi
tion parties formed in October
1990 that "brought together basi
cally everybody who opposed the
communist system," he said.
But after the failure of last
August's coup, the coalition
found itself struggling to survive.
Although the leaders of the
coalition are "totally unknown
figures to people in the West,"
McFaul said that "in terms of the
history of why this system col
lapsed, these people have a lot to
do with it."
The coalition organized mas
sive demonstrations against the

Communist system even before
the August 1991 coup attempt.
According to McFaul, Democratic
Russia joined Yeltsin in resisting
that coup.
Although Yeltsin was not an
official member of Democratic
Russia, he was appointed its hon
orary leader.
The coalition was organized to
fight hard-line Communists with
in the old regime, McFaul said.
When the coup failed, the coali
tion began to break up as differ
ences between members began to
surface.
According to McFaul, two
issues currently divide Democrat
ic Russia. The main controversy
within the coalition is whether the
former union should be restored.
At one end is the radical per
spective supported by Yuri
Afanasyev, who supports Russian
independence.
The other end of the spectrum
is represented by Nikolai Travkin,
who believes the union should be
restored at all costs. Travkin is the
leader of the Democratic Party of
Russia, a member of the Demo
cratic Russia coalition.
The second issue is privatiza
tion and the development of a
market economy.
Moving from a centralized
economy to a market economy is
"a pretty incredible task if you're
doing it in Hungary or Poland,"
McFaul said. "It's another thing
when you're doing it across this

huge country."
The liberal, "neo-Thatcherite"
group wants to privatize everything
as quickly as possible to create a
market economy, McFaul said.
Hut social-democratic and
republican parties argue that if pri
vatization starts happening now,
only the former Communists will
be able to buy anything. According
to McFaul, the result would be a
democracy in name only.
"In my opinion it's a little too
soon for the coalition to be divid
