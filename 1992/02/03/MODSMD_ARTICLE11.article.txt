tor Center's budget may not be cut
as much as previously feared if
Congress approves President
Bush's budget plan, according to
SLAC Assistant Director Bill Kirk.
"Now it doesn't look so bad,"
Kirk said. "Several months ago
we thought that funding would be
decreased by as much as 10 per
cent. If you consider inflation, it
jumps to about 15 percent."
Kirk said the cuts may now be
only about 1 percent, which is 6
percent with inflation. That
amounts to about a $1.4 million
cut in the 1992 budget of $144.6
million.
"People are relieved, but that
doesn't mean we're out of the
woods yet," Kirk said. "Congress
can still change [the budget J, and
they've never changed it up, only
down."
The proposed budget was

released last week, shortly after
President Bush's State of the
Union address.
The final budget won't be
known for at least another month
and perhaps as long as six months
or more as Congress goes over the
president's budget, Kirk said.
He said the center is organiz
ing a committee to determine
which parts of SLAC will be hard
est hit by the proposed cuts.
Because SLAC gets only a neg
ligible amount of its funding from
the University, it will probably
not be affected by the school's
budget crisis, according to one
University official who asked not
to be identified.
SLAC is principally funded by
the federal government's Depart
ment of Energy, which provides
funding for high-energy physics
research.
SLAC must find cuts in its
budget by October, when fiscal
year 1993 begins.
