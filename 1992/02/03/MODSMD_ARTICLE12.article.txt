'Gimmicks' in Bush budget plan assailed
WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell said Sunday that Congress will take the "gimmicks" out
of President Bush's economic recovery plan and add a tax cut for
the middle class.
Mitchell denounced Bush's March 20 deadline for action as "a
political ploy," but said Congress may well act before that date.
"The Congress will act promptly because it's the right thing to
do, not because of any deadline," the Maine Democrat said on
NBC's "Meet the Press."
He said Bush's $1.52 trillion budget for fiscal 1993 is "filled
with gimmicks," including an accounting change that under
states the deficit by $40 billion for 1992 and 1993.
Bush's budget forecasts record deficits of almost $400 billion
this year and $351 billion in 1993.
Killings excited Dahmer, confession says
MILWAUKEE (AP) — The calm demeanor Jeffrey L. Dahmer
displayed in court last week during his sanity trial belies his once
secret life of predatory necrophilia and cannibalism.
In his confession read aloud in court by police, Dahmer said it
excited him to kill and butcher 17 victims. He said he felt power
and pleasure in having a "private world" where he was in com
mand.
Dahmer, 31, has pleaded guilty, but insane, to 15 murder
charges. A jury must decide his sanity at the times of the killings
and whether he should be sent to prison or a mental institution.
