## Editor's Welcome 
### 
When Nigerian journalist
Tunji Lardner, Jr. wrote
the first ever investigative
piece chronicling the brutal politi
cal cunning of General Ibrahim
Babangida, his West African
nation's ruler, he knew there
would be trouble.
"We just had to print it," Lard
ner told me three years ago, sitting
on the floor of his small Palo Alto
room months after he was impris
oned by the General he had com
pared to Nicolo Machiavelli's infa
mous Prince.
Lardner had just been released
and had transplanted himself from
Lagos to Stanford, where he was
one of a score of top international
and U.S. journalists chosen for a
year of academic relief in the John
S. Knight Fellowship program.
Although the repercussions for
courageous and thoughtful cover
age are much less brutal for Daily
reporters, Lardner's story is an
important inspiration.
The past volume at The Daily
has been characterized by coverage
with consequences for both the
staff and the human beings who
are the stories' subjects.
In one day's newspaper, for
instance, The Daily ran a story on
a complex and disturbing statuto
ry rape case, a tragic story of a stu
dent's suicide and a sensitive story
on allegations of sexual molesta
tion at a campus child-care center
which later proved unfounded.
Any of these stories could have had
tragic repercussions for the people
involved if they were handled irre
sponsibly.
As The Daily moves into its sec
ond century, the staff is committed
to scrappy but fair coverage of
Stanford and the human beings
that keep it alive.
The University is facing a time
of change unparalleled since the
upheaval in the 19605. By sum
mer, Stanford will name its new
president and provost; will
attempt to re-invent itself while a
$43 million leg is being cut off by
the budget ax; and will continue a

battle with the federal govern
ment that will set the tone for how
Washington, D.C. relates to uni
versities for at least the next
decade. Such change is fertile
ground for political and analytical
reporting.
There will also be a series of
unexpected and shocking news
events — the texture and tragedy
that keep people writing and read
ing newspapers even in the elec
tronic era of easy information.
Publishing The Daily is no
easy task. It takes about 320 per
son-hours for the staff —
account executives, administra
tive workers, aritists, a con
troller, editors, photo labbers,
managers, layout specialists,
photographers, reporters — to
produce each day's Daily.
That commitment will contin
ue. In practical terms, that means
Daily staff members will keep their
eyes open, knock on hundreds of
doors, make thousands of phone
calls.
We also look forward to all
responses from the community on
the work that we do. Behind The
Daily is a diverse group of individ
uals from India to Indiana — not
some monolith. We read and lis
ten to every word from the com
munity, both the thoughtful and
the mean-spirited. Members of
our staff have been called every
thing from bastard to brilliant,
and we take the comments very
seriously.
But The Daily is an independent
publication — one of a tiny minor
ity of university newspapers
nationwide. And with complete
freedom comes an intense reponsi
bility. This fact nags at us con
stantly, and prevents us from slow
ing down.
It's a responsibilty Tunji Lard
ner could understand.
