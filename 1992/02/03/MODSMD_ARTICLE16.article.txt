Challenging restrictive gender roles in the workplace

I WAS VERY GLAD TO READ THE
group of articles on Jan. 30 address
ing the problems of women who
enter the work force, as I find myself
often thinking of compromises I will
have to make in the future in order to
have both work and family.
However, I was disappointed that the
articles did not deal with the idea of not
only shared incomes, but also shared
domestic responsibilities.
It is possible for women in my genera
tion, much more so than for the women
in my mother's generation, to consider a
career. Yet now we have the serious
problem of agonizing over the options of
career, family, or juggling both.
Most women in my generation are
well-informed of the pitfalls of juggling
family and jobs; we are not deluded by
the myth of the super mom. I have often
wondered why it is not even a question
for many men whether they should
choose either or juggle both.
Of course, I and everyone else knows
the answer to that question. Traditional
gender roles have been constructed
largely along the lines of who stays
home, and who works "outside" to pro
vide for it.

A man taking off time from work to
care for the kids? It's not so unheard of,
but it's not always a viable option. First
of all, flex-time and the equivalent of
maternal leave for men rarely exists in
the workplace.
Second of all, I suspect that many
men would be uneasy about taking
advantage of such benefits even if they
existed. It is still deeply ingrained in our
society that the home is chiefly the
woman's responsibility, and the woman
who forsakes it for a career is not an
ideal woman. Likewise, the man who
chooses to stay at home and care for chil
dren is somehow seen as less than a man.
It is obvious, though, that women are
going to be a permanent and growing
part of the work force. Why does it not
follow that men should be given the
opportunity to share in domestic respon
sibilities? Washing dishes and keeping
records of bills and changing diapers
may not sound like an opportunity, but
then again, consider the problem of the
absentee father, the "weekend father."
Consider the regrets of fathers — like
my own father — who never really see
their children grow up, and perhaps feel
cheated out of fatherhood when they

realize they cannot recall with any vivid
ness the time span between a toddler's
babbling, and that same infant's college
student-quibbling years later. I do not
believe that men are less capable of rais
ing children, and I dare say many would
rather stay at home with the children
regularly instead of facing the rat race
every day for forty plus hours a week.
The problem lies in our conceptions of
the division between family and work
and the gender roles assigned to the
halves of that division. The "family" is
now in the process of being redefined in
terms of who does what. The workplace,
accordingly, should be reformed to
accommodate the family.
Flex-time for both men and women
should be available. It bothers me how
strongly it is implied in the media —
The Daily's articles included — that the
family is the woman's responsibility, and
therefore if she wishes to pursue a
career it is her problem to juggle.
This assumption is outdated for two
reasons, both having to do with the
restructuring of the family. The first
reason has been mentioned before —
women are now a permanent part of the
work force, and cannot devote all their

time to the home. Families are also
changing in that couples are no longer
always heterosexual. When working gay
men decide to adopt children, for exam
ple, where is their equivalent of the
maternal leave, and how can they effec
tively petition for flexible time off for
childcare?
Because of the entry of women into
the work force and the restructuring of
the family, the work needs to change in
order to minimize the problems caused
by these changes. Some corporations
emphasize sustaining the family rather
than damaging it or draining it. Howev
er, they are the exception, and for
women who work in uncompromising
workplaces, the juggling option is chosen
at a great cost to both their families and
themselves.
The stress of both the workplace and
family is a bad combination. Not only
will more work flexibility, provided for
both men and women, help preserve the
health and happiness of the family, but
it will also facilitate providing opportuni
ties to women and men for fulfillment at
both work and home.
