# Student expresses horror at troubling events in Algeria
## 
### 
I have watched with pain and horror
events unfold in Algeria over the past
few weeks and I feel truly disappointed
by both the interruption of the elec
toral process that this country had
been undergoing and by the neutral
and cynical position that the world
community has adopted in facing this
crisis.

Being among the first and unique
countries in both the Arab and Muslim
world to engage in a genuine democrati
zation process, Algeria today has become
a symbol.
However, an unconstitutional coup
d'etat, tacitly welcomed and supported
by the international community and
media, has come to destroy this fledgling
democracy and halt the free electoral
process that would have helped demo
cratically bring the national Muslim
party to power.
The illegal government in place today
is already and systematically decapitat
ing the party in question (best known as
F. 1.5.) by throwing its leaders in prison

and threatening it of imminent dissolu
tion.
This party having gained legitimate
power and recognition by winning the
majority in the latest elections has
become a threat and an unpleasant
reality for the long-established mili
tary junta that has sucked the wealth
of the Algerian people for more than
30 years.
When the former Soviet Union went
through the same political scenario not
long ago, a unanimous uproar of anger
and indignation shook the world. How
ever, when Algeria's turn came, the
international community observed
silence.

How long will our countries watch,
silently, this blatant violation of the
charter of freedom that they themselves
have promised to defend and support?
How long will we ignore the rights of the
Algerians and cover up for the ongoing
acts of repression that are pushing this
country into explosive political instabili
ty?
It is time today to recognize the legiti
mate changes that are taking place in
the Islamic world in general and in Alge
ria in particular as this has been done
for Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union.
