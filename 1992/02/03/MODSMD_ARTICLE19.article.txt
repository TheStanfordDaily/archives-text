## Dr. Bush creates a monster 
### 
JUST IN CASE THERE WERE any
lingering doubts about the direction
in which the right-wing leadership of
the Supreme Court would head, a voting
rights decision last Monday put those
doubts to rest like a Halcion tranquilizer
helping President Bush to sleep.
In the first civil rights case to come
before the Court since Clarence Thomas
joined it, a six-justice majority ruled that
white commissioners in Alabama did not
violate the 1965 Voting Rights Act when
they transferred power away from offices
to which black officials had just been
elected for the first time.
The white officials responded to the
unprecedented election of black commis
sioners with 1 lth-hour redistributions of
the commissioners' powers so that the
black officials arrived in office without
some of the powers their predecessors
had enjoyed.
What's more, the majority, which
included both Thomas and David Souter
— Bush's lightweight "replacements" for
William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall
— refused to accept Bush Administration
arguments on behalf of the black appel
lants.
The Justice Department's brief charac
terized the actions of the white incumbents
as "negatfingl the election of a candidate
favored by minority voters simply by reallo
cating the successful candidate's authority
to other elected or appointed officials."

Writing for the Court, Anthony
Kennedy rejected the Justice Depart
ment's position and instead invoked a
distinction — in this case bogus —
between "voting" and "governance," con
tending that the transfer of powers was a
legitimate decision and that therefore the
Voting Rights Act wasn't applicable.
John Paul Stevens dissented, pointing
out the absurdity of this distinction. The
white officials' 1 lth-hour tactics, he
wrote, were obviously a response to the
election results, and such actions are
"indistinguishable from and just as unac
ceptable as" other voting-related schemes
the Court has prohibited in the past.
It's ironic that like Dr. Frankenstein,
Bush is responsible for the monster that
is the current Court — the first, in 27
years of using the Voting Rights Act, not
to apply it as suggested by the Justice
Department. Indeed, even harsh critics of
the Reagan and Bush Administrations
will acknowledge the continuity of Jus
tice Department efforts in support of the
right to vote.
Reagan himself joined the battle when
he signed into law the 1982 extension of
the original Voting Rights Act, which
called for an investigation into the "total
ity of circumstances" surrounding a chal
lenged voting scheme — expressly leav
ing room for an analysis of the scheme's
results, not just its intent. Thus, a
scheme that on its face didn't discrimi-

nate but de facto did create discriminato
ry results would be held invalid.
And the Reagan-era Court upheld the
1982 extension. Indeed, the end of the
1980s saw only a slight change in the ide
ological balance of the Court from that at
the beginning of the decade. Even liberals
couldn't be too critical of the Reagan-era
Court's decisions since they were at least
the outcome of scholarly debate. As
Kennedy said when he spoke on campus
this fall, with Brennan and Marshall
around you could be sure the left side of
the debate would be expertly articulated
for all to hear. Unfortunately, the same
can no longer be said.
As a Daily editorial written before
Thomas was approved by the Senate
warned would happen, Bush's appoint
ments to the Court have pushed it
"beyond the limits of scholarly debate
onto a plateau of complacent consensus
dangerously inappropriate in a body with
the Court's obligations."

days.
