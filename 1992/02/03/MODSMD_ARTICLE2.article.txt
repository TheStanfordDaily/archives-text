# Minute mix-up means headaches for ASSU
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
An administrative mix-up in
last year's ASSU Senate is caus
ing headaches for this year's sen
ators, according to current
Deputy Chair, Neil Crellin.
Crellin said last year's senate
secretary, Lyzette Settle, never
wrote the minutes from eight of
last year's 20 senate meetings,
including the final meeting where
the senate passed this year's bud
get.
The lack of minutes recently
caused problems in the appropria
tions for Ujamaa's "Club Uj" casi
no night, and may have cost the
senate up to $380.
According to senate Financial
Manager Mike Risch, Ujamaa
was granted $1200 to $1400 in
annual funding for its Feb. 29
Club Uj during the final senate
meeting last year. However,
because no official records of
that meeting are available, Uja
maa never received any pay
ment.
Ujamaa reapplied this year for
$1100 to $1200 dollars of pro
gram board discretionary funding
for winter quarter. But the ASSU
Constitution does not allow a
group to receive both program
board annual and quarterly dis
cretionary funds for the same
General Fee period.
Therefore, if Ujamaa was
voted the money at the end of last
year, they can't be given more
money for the same program.
In response to this dilemma,
the senate last meeting separated
the Club Uj funding proposal
from the rest of the program
board allocations, putting off
consideration of the funding
request until its next meeting
Feb. 11.
In addition to disrupting the
Club Uj funding proposal, the
minutes mix-up may have cost
the ASSU over $300. According to
Crellin, Settle was paid $380 for
writing the minutes to seven
meetings which, Crellin said,

have never been given to the
ASSU.
Senate secretaries are paid a
flat rate for each set of minutes
they write up. Crellin said the
rate at the beginning of last year
was $40 per set of minutes. After
the 12th meeting, the salary paid
was raised to $60 because sena
tors felt the $40 wage was too
low.
"We were asking a hell of a lot
of the secretary," Crellin said.
Crellin said last year's senate
secretary, Lyzette Settle, has yet
to give the senate the minutes
for the 11th, 12th, 14th, 15th
and 17th through 20th meetings
last year, but was paid for all but
the final meeting, a total of
$380.
Because the final meeting last
ed until 3 a.m., then-senate chair
Solina Kwan raised Settle's salary
to $90, Crellin said.
However, Crellin said he
"made the executive decision to
withhold the ($9O) check until all
the minutes were turned in."
Settle could not be reached for
comment.
Risch said the ASSU had not
paid Settle "whatever her last
paycheck would have been,"
but thought Settle had been
paid for about six sets of min
utes she had not written up.
Risch said that the amount
withheld was "closer to $300
than to $90."
Kwan, however, said that Set
tle was not paid for minutes she
had not turned in. In addition,
Kwan said she had "been trying
to track [Settle] down myself,"
although she was no longer sen
ate chair.
But Crellin said he has docu
mentation that Settle has been
paid $380. In addition, Crellin
said he is "very angry" that Kwan
authorized payments for the
unfinished minutes.
Kwan said she turned the pay
ment over to Risch at the end of
the year, who was to withhold it
until Settle brought the notes in
to the business office.
