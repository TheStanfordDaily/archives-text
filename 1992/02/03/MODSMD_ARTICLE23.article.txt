### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
It wasn't exactly the Goodwill Games.

team won 9-0. Following an 8-1 victory over the
Washington Huskies Saturday, the Cardinal is now
3-0 on the season.

Although all the Utah matches were straight-set
wins for the Cardinal, the points were hard fought
and tense, provoking some dissent on calls.
In the No. 3 singles match between Stanford's
Kylie Johnson and Heidi Chinchiolo several calls
were questioned, prompting Utah coach John
Tsumas to summon a chair umpire over to referee
the match.
Except for major tournaments like the NCAA
Championships, the players usually call the lines.
"I just heard them ask each other about calls and
sent an ump over," Tsumas said. "Everything went
smoothly after that. It was no big deal."
"It's their prerogative to call an ump," Stanford
coach Frank Brennan said. "Sometimes I want one
out there, not because I think [our opponent) is
cheating, but I want to settle my player down and
get her focused."
Johnson, the 7-5, 6-2 victor, downplayed the sit
uation. "Actually [Chinchiolo| thought I had called
for [the umpi," Johnson said.
At No. 2 singles Laxmi Poruri defeated Lisa Sal
vatierra 6-1, 6-4. At one point in the second set,
after Poruri called a serve out, Salvatierra walked
towards the net and said, "That was not out!"
A surprised Poruri responded, "That was so far
out," and walked back to the baseline.
Brennan had mixed feelings about the disputes.
"[Salvatierra| questioned a call that was three inch
es out and Laxmi, who is a good line caller, called it
out," Brennan said.
On one hand, I don't mind it. It's a battle out
there and they're feisty ... it makes them noble
opponents. On the other hand, it doesn't promote
goodwill."
Despite the conflicts, the Cardinal players were
able to focus on their matches and pull out victories.
At No. 1 singles Heather Willens outgunned Alison
Bradford 6-3, 6-2. The first set was a battle in which
both players took turns yanking each other across
the court.
"I ran my butt off in the first set," Willens said.
"I wasn't playing my game — being aggressive."
Willens dictated most of the action in the second set
and pulled away in the last few games.
Emma Woodhouse quickly dispatched Jennifer
Jensen 6-2, 6-0. Amy Chiminello followed with a 7-
6 (7-1), 6-0 thrashing of Ruth Ann Stevens and
Mario Carruth beat Kristin Longson 6-2, 6-4.
In doubles the third-ranked duo in the country,
Willens and Poruri, outdueled Salvatierra and
Stevens 6-4, 6-4. The pairs exchanged dazzling
reflex volleys at net and occasionally mixed in offen
sive topspin lobs.
The No. 15 tandem of Johnson and Woodhouse
pulled away from Chinchiolo and
Jensen 6-4, 6-2. Chiminello and
Curruth nailed the shutout with
a 6-4, 6-0 victory over Bradford
and Longson.
The Utah victory followed a
tough win over Washington Sat
urday. Willens beat Mary Reilly 6-
4, 6-4 and Poruri blew past Kim
Frost 6-3, 6-2. Competing at No. 3
singles — the highest slot she's
played for Stanford — Emma
Woodhouse demolished Paige
Stringer 6-1, 6-4.
"We grew up together in the
[Northern California junior

ranks] so I've played her a lot
before," Woodhouse said.
"[Woodhouse] usually does not
start that quickly and today she
won 6-1," Brennan said. "She
played tough to win the second."
Chiminello survived a first set
tiebreaker to take a 7-6 (8-6), 6-4
battle from Lisa Proctor. Meeting
Loan Phan at No. 5 singles, Car
ruth raced off the court with a 6-
2, 6-2 victory.
Prompting cheers of "Go
Fish!", the No. 6 singles' match
between Kelly Fisher and
Michelle Thomas was a three-set
marathon. A sore ankle slowed
Fisher and she lost the 5-7, 6-2, 6-
3 battle.
Stanford swept the doubles in
straight sets.

start that quickly and today she
won 6-1," Brennan said. "She
played tough to win the second."

Although all the Utah matches were straight-set
wins for the Cardinal, the points were hard fought
and tense, provoking some dissent on calls.
In the No. 3 singles match between Stanford's
Kylie Johnson and Heidi Chinchiolo several calls
were questioned, prompting Utah coach John
Tsumas to summon a chair umpire over to referee
the match.
Except for major tournaments like the NCAA
Championships, the players usually call the lines.
"I just heard them ask each other about calls and
sent an ump over," Tsumas said. "Everything went
smoothly after that. It was no big deal."
"It's their prerogative to call an ump," Stanford
coach Frank Brennan said. "Sometimes I want one
out there, not because I think [our opponent) is
cheating, but I want to settle my player down and
get her focused."
Johnson, the 7-5, 6-2 victor, downplayed the sit
uation. "Actually [Chinchiolo| thought I had called
for [the umpi," Johnson said.
At No. 2 singles Laxmi Poruri defeated Lisa Sal
vatierra 6-1, 6-4. At one point in the second set,
after Poruri called a serve out, Salvatierra walked
towards the net and said, "That was not out!"
A surprised Poruri responded, "That was so far
out," and walked back to the baseline.
Brennan had mixed feelings about the disputes.
"[Salvatierra| questioned a call that was three inch
es out and Laxmi, who is a good line caller, called it
out," Brennan said.
On one hand, I don't mind it. It's a battle out
there and they're feisty ... it makes them noble
opponents. On the other hand, it doesn't promote
goodwill."
Despite the conflicts, the Cardinal players were
able to focus on their matches and pull out victories.
At No. 1 singles Heather Willens outgunned Alison
Bradford 6-3, 6-2. The first set was a battle in which
both players took turns yanking each other across
the court.
"I ran my butt off in the first set," Willens said.
"I wasn't playing my game — being aggressive."
Willens dictated most of the action in the second set
and pulled away in the last few games.
Emma Woodhouse quickly dispatched Jennifer
Jensen 6-2, 6-0. Amy Chiminello followed with a 7-
6 (7-1), 6-0 thrashing of Ruth Ann Stevens and
Mario Carruth beat Kristin Longson 6-2, 6-4.
In doubles the third-ranked duo in the country,
Willens and Poruri, outdueled Salvatierra and
Stevens 6-4, 6-4. The pairs exchanged dazzling
reflex volleys at net and occasionally mixed in offen
sive topspin lobs.
The No. 15 tandem of Johnson and Woodhouse
pulled away from Chinchiolo and
Jensen 6-4, 6-2. Chiminello and
Curruth nailed the shutout with
a 6-4, 6-0 victory over Bradford
and Longson.
The Utah victory followed a
tough win over Washington Sat
urday. Willens beat Mary Reilly 6-
4, 6-4 and Poruri blew past Kim
Frost 6-3, 6-2. Competing at No. 3
singles — the highest slot she's
played for Stanford — Emma
Woodhouse demolished Paige
Stringer 6-1, 6-4.
"We grew up together in the

ranks] so I've played her a lot
before," Woodhouse said.
"[Woodhouse] usually does not
