# Netters edge San Diego

After cruising to a 9-0 win over Hawaii
Thursday, the men's tennis team strug
gled for five and a half hours Friday
afternoon before squeaking by a gutsy,
unranked squad from San Diego, 5-4.
"We scrambled for our lives," said
Cardinal head coach Dick Gould. "I was
really impressed with San Diego."
No. 1-ranked Alex O'Brien lost a close
two-setter to Peruvian Davis Cup mem
ber Jose-Luis Noriega, 6-4, 6-4. O'Brien
played a solid match but Noriega's accu
rate first serves prevented the senior
from finding any weak spots.
"Alex had a nice tempo off the ground.
. . but Noriega played the best I've seen
him play in four years," Gould said.
O'Brien, who heads into the Volvo Tour
nament tomorrow, was also impressed by
the Peruvian: "He's just too good. I had a
few let downs in each set, and then the
set was over."
Matched up with Chris Cocotos in dou
bles, O'Brien was able to avenge his sin
gles loss with a 6-4, 6-4 victory in doubles
over Noriega and Ignacio Martinez. Thun
dering serves, lightning-quick reaction
volleys and delicately angled drop shots
marked the exceptional play of all four
men. "Chris played real well," Gould said.
"(O'Brien and Cocotos) are a good team."
Just as the tandem was wrapping up
their win, Michael Flanagan was finally
making his way off the court after an
exhausting and disappointing three and
a half hour loss at second singles, 7-5, 6-
7 (4-7), 6-1. The first two sets alone last
ed nearly three hours.
"You have to keep in mind how much
he'd played," Gould said. "Mike played
like a guy short on match experience and
lacking confidence in his health. He's a
great competitor and I have a lot of confi
dence in him."
Unfortunately, Flanagan's wrist is
bothering him again but hopefully will
not interfere with his trip to the Rolex
Indoor Championships later this week.

As shadows fell on the courts and
matches fell into place, it became increas
ingly evident that the third doubles
match would determine the day's cham
pion. Cocotos won his third singles
match while Robert Devens lost at the
four spot. Jason Yee and Vimal Patel won
their singles matches, but the Devens-
Patel tandem were defeated at second
doubles.

the second doubles match. After being up
a break in the second set, the Toreros
tandem broke the Cardinal right back
and won 6-3, 7-5. "Neither Rob or Vimal
has a dominating serve, they need to
serve a higher percentage to be success
ful," Gould remarked. "They have the
potential to improve a lot though."
As the sun set, the outcome of the
match weighed down on the shoulders of
Billy Wright and Yee. At 4—4 in the first
set, a Cardinal win was still up in the air.
Yee's experience shone through as he hit
winner after winner. Wright lost serve
but rallied back into the match to clinch
a Stanford win.
"Jason played phenomenally," Gould
said. "And at the end, Billy started play
ing better too. We really had to suck it up
in doubles."
