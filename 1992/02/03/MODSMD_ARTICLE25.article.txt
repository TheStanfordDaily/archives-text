Cardinal 89

Sundevils 66 J

Stanford played perhaps its best defen
sive game of the Pac-10 season to accom
plish the win. The Cardinal held the Sun
Devils to 37.7 percent shooting for the
game. Offensively, Stanford won the
game in the first half, when it shot 63
percent and gave itself a 21-point half
time margin.
Rachel Hemmer, who garnered a double
double with 13 points and a game-high 12
rebounds, sparked a 15-4 Cardinal run
midway through the first half. With Stan
ford up 12-11, ASU forward LaJuana John
son posted up on the baseline just left of the
basket. As she went up to shoot, Hemmer
came from behind and emphatically spiked
the ball away.
Up to that point, Stanford had played
somewhat sloppily, but Hemmer's block
seemed to impel the cagers. Within four
minutes Stanford was up 27-15. Through
out that run and after it, ASU coach Maura
McHugh interacted quite animatedly with
the officials.
Some missed Cardinal free throws
allowed the Sun Devils to come back to
within seven, but Stanford closed out the
first period with a 21-7 run. Val Whiting
scored nine of those points. Going up
against a 6-foot-6 forward and a 6-foot-4
center, the 6-3 Whiting nevertheless led all
scorers with 16 first-half points and wound
up with 22 in all.
"I tried to get my shot off faster than
usual, so that they couldn't block it," she
said.
With about two minutes to go in the first

period, Whiting was fouled in the lane by
Sun Devil Crystal Cobb. As she was knock
ing down the front end of the one-and-one,
official Bob Olson decided that he had had
enough of McHugh's badgering and
assessed her a technical foul.
Whiting was able to shoot her bonus
shot and the two technical shots with no
one else on her side of the court. She sank
every one.
"We had some good runs in the first
half," Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer
said. "We came out very aggressive."
In the second half, Stanford was not
quite as aggressive, and didn't seem to be
able to find its groove. As a result, the Car
dinal's offense was not as productive,
shooting only 43 percent from the field. .
"When we ran we looked good," Van
Derveer said, but she was concerned that
her team was not running enough, among
other things. "Our wing players could
make better decisions. Until [the defense]
stops letting us go inside, we should keep
going inside .... We need to work harder to
get the shots we want."
But overall she was pleased. "We played
well to get that lead," she said.

usual, so that they couldn't block it," she
said.
With about two minutes to go in the first

period, Whiting was fouled in the lane by
Sun Devil Crystal Cobb. As she was knock
ing down the front end of the one-and-one,
official Bob Olson decided that he had had
enough of McHugh's badgering and
assessed her a technical foul.
Whiting was able to shoot her bonus
shot and the two technical shots with no
one else on her side of the court. She sank
every one.
"We had some good runs in the first
half," Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer
said. "We came out very aggressive."
In the second half, Stanford was not
quite as aggressive, and didn't seem to be
able to find its groove. As a result, the Car
dinal's offense was not as productive,
shooting only 43 percent from the field. .
"When we ran we looked good," Van
Derveer said, but she was concerned that
her team was not running enough, among
other things. "Our wing players could
make better decisions. Until [the defense]
stops letting us go inside, we should keep
going inside .... We need to work harder to
get the shots we want."
But overall she was pleased. "We played
well to get that lead," she said.

6-3 power forward Rachel Hemmer comes down with the rebound for
the Cardinal against Arizona State. Stanford stomped the Lady Sun
Devils on Saturday, 89-66 to remain in sole possession of first place

State upset California, Stanford defeated
the Sun Devils 89-66 to solidify its hold on
the Pacific 10 Conference lead. The Cardi
nal is now 16-1, 6-1 in the Pac-10, while
ASU fell to 12-5, 3-4.

Cardinal 89

Sundevils 66 J

Stanford played perhaps its best defen
sive game of the Pac-10 season to accom
plish the win. The Cardinal held the Sun
Devils to 37.7 percent shooting for the
game. Offensively, Stanford won the
game in the first half, when it shot 63
percent and gave itself a 21-point half
time margin.
Rachel Hemmer, who garnered a double
double with 13 points and a game-high 12
rebounds, sparked a 15-4 Cardinal run
midway through the first half. With Stan
ford up 12-11, ASU forward LaJuana John
son posted up on the baseline just left of the
basket. As she went up to shoot, Hemmer
came from behind and emphatically spiked
the ball away.
Up to that point, Stanford had played
somewhat sloppily, but Hemmer's block
seemed to impel the cagers. Within four
minutes Stanford was up 27-15. Through
out that run and after it, ASU coach Maura
McHugh interacted quite animatedly with
the officials.
Some missed Cardinal free throws
allowed the Sun Devils to come back to
within seven, but Stanford closed out the
first period with a 21-7 run. Val Whiting
scored nine of those points. Going up
against a 6-foot-6 forward and a 6-foot-4
center, the 6-3 Whiting nevertheless led all
scorers with 16 first-half points and wound
up with 22 in all.
"I tried to get my shot off faster than
usual, so that they couldn't block it," she
said.
With about two minutes to go in the first

period, Whiting was fouled in the lane by
Sun Devil Crystal Cobb. As she was knock
ing down the front end of the one-and-one,
