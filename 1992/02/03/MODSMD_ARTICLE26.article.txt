# Card makes free throws, beats Huskies
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
SEATTLE- For the first time in four games, Stan
ford peaked at the perfect time.
After dilly-dallying offensively for 39 minutes, the
Cardinal sank 10 of 10 free throws in the final 1:10,
slamming Washington 64-58 yesterday at Hec
Edmundson Pavilion. The come-from-behind road
win snaps a three-game Stanford losing streak and
thrusts the fourth-place Cardinal (12-4, 4-3) back
into the Pacific 10 Conference race.
"We needed that win badly," said Stanford coach
Mike Montgomery. "This was huge for us. Washing
ton did a nice job of preparing and I thought they
played a very good ball game. It was there for both
teams to take."
The Huskies stifled Stanford forward Adam Keefe
(16 points on a season-low 9 field goal attempts), but

missed two front-end free throws in the final three
minutes to squander the game.
With Stanford leading 56-53 at the two-minute
mark, center Paul Garrett scored a lay-up after a
loose-ball rebound. Brent Williams, Marcus Lollie
and Keefe followed with free throws, preserving a
six-point cushion the rest of the way.
Point guard Marcus Lollie scored a season-high 17
points, including two game-breaking free throws
with :46 left. His top-of-the key 3-pointer with 8:42
left gave Stanford a 48-42 lead, its biggest of the
game.
"If the other team is just blatantly not going to
cover you, you have to step up and bury it," said Lol
lie, a Seattle native. "I don't care about the points,
we just really needed a win today."
Stanford scored a season-low 25 points in the first
half, but found enough of an offensive rhythm in the
second half to overtake the Huskies.

Forward Brent Williams, silenced in the first half
on 0-for-5 shooting, exploded for 16 in the second
half. It was deja vu for Williams, who scored 12 in the
second half against Washington State after a score
less first half.
"We were out of sorts in the first half," Mont
gomery said. "We have a real problem with patience
and Washington was taking Adam away pretty well.
We needed guys to move the ball and find the open
man."
Keefe's primary contribution to the win was
rebounding. In the first eight minutes he only
touched the ball twice on the offensive end, and
didn't take a shot for 13 minutes.
Although he finished with 16 points and 16
rebounds, only four of Keefe's points came from
Stanford's set offense. Denied the ball, he scored 12
points off 7 offensive rebounds as
Stanford out-rebounded Wash
ington 20-7 in the second half.
"Adam really hung in there
emotionally," Montgomery said.
"We've got a lot of young players
maybe not doing what they're
supposed to."
Stanford, which has beaten the
Huskies four times in a row, des
perately needed a win before
returning home against the Ari
zona schools. The Cardinal hosts
No. 8 Arizona Thursday at 6:30
p.m.
The Huskies (9-8, 3-4) have
now lost two in a row heading
into a murderous four-game road
trip to USC, UCLA, Arizona and
Arizona State.

"We played good defense
tonight but our offense really
hurt us," said Washington coach
Lynn Nance. "We tried to force it
inside too much and we missed
some key free throws down the
stretch."
Card Notes
With 12 rebounds Thursday and 16
yesterday, Keefe passed Kimberly Bel
ton to become Stanford's all-time lead
ing rebounder (972). Keefe is third in
the nation in rebounding (12.9) and
eleventh in scoring (25.3).
Washington honored its national
championship football team with a
halftime extravaganza. Of the 6,273
mutes in attendance at Hec Edmun
son Pavilion, about 5,500 came for the
free football poster and 500 came to
get out of the rain.
Feisty freshman guard David Har
bour was elbowed above the eye in prac

we just really needed a win today."
Stanford scored a season-low 25 points in the first
half, but found enough of an offensive rhythm in the
second half to overtake the Huskies.

Forward Brent Williams, silenced in the first half
on 0-for-5 shooting, exploded for 16 in the second
half. It was deja vu for Williams, who scored 12 in the
second half against Washington State after a score
less first half.
"We were out of sorts in the first half," Mont
gomery said. "We have a real problem with patience
and Washington was taking Adam away pretty well.
We needed guys to move the ball and find the open
man."
Keefe's primary contribution to the win was
rebounding. In the first eight minutes he only
touched the ball twice on the offensive end, and
didn't take a shot for 13 minutes.
Although he finished with 16 points and 16
rebounds, only four of Keefe's points came from
Stanford's set offense. Denied the ball, he scored 12
points off 7 offensive rebounds as
Stanford out-rebounded Wash
ington 20-7 in the second half.
"Adam really hung in there
emotionally," Montgomery said.
"We've got a lot of young players
maybe not doing what they're
supposed to."
Stanford, which has beaten the
Huskies four times in a row, des
perately needed a win before
returning home against the Ari
zona schools. The Cardinal hosts
No. 8 Arizona Thursday at 6:30
p.m.
The Huskies (9-8, 3-4) have
now lost two in a row heading
into a murderous four-game road
trip to USC, UCLA, Arizona and
Arizona State.

"We played good defense
tonight but our offense really
hurt us," said Washington coach
Lynn Nance. "We tried to force it
inside too much and we missed
some key free throws down the
stretch."
Card Notes
With 12 rebounds Thursday and 16
yesterday, Keefe passed Kimberly Bel
ton to become Stanford's all-time lead
ing rebounder (972). Keefe is third in
the nation in rebounding (12.9) and
eleventh in scoring (25.3).
Washington honored its national
championship football team with a
halftime extravaganza. Of the 6,273
mutes in attendance at Hec Edmun
son Pavilion, about 5,500 came for the
free football poster and 500 came to
get out of the rain.
Feisty freshman guard David Har
bour was elbowed above the eye in prac
tice and is playing with five stitches.
