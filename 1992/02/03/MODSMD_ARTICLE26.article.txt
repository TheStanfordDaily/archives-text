# Card makes free throws, beats Huskies

### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
SEATTLE- For the first time in four games, Stan
ford peaked at the perfect time.
After dilly-dallying offensively for 39 minutes, the
Cardinal sank 10 of 10 free throws in the final 1:10,
slamming Washington 64-58 yesterday at Hec
Edmundson Pavilion. The come-from-behind road
win snaps a three-game Stanford losing streak and
thrusts the fourth-place Cardinal (12-4, 4-3) back
into the Pacific 10 Conference race.
"We needed that win badly," said Stanford coach
Mike Montgomery. "This was huge for us. Washing
ton did a nice job of preparing and I thought they
played a very good ball game. It was there for both
teams to take."
The Huskies stifled Stanford forward Adam Keefe
(16 points on a season-low 9 field goal attempts), but

missed two front-end free throws in the final three
minutes to squander the game.
With Stanford leading 56-53 at the two-minute
mark, center Paul Garrett scored a lay-up after a
loose-ball rebound. Brent Williams, Marcus Lollie
and Keefe followed with free throws, preserving a
six-point cushion the rest of the way.
Point guard Marcus Lollie scored a season-high 17
points, including two game-breaking free throws
with :46 left. His top-of-the key 3-pointer with 8:42
left gave Stanford a 48-42 lead, its biggest of the
game.
"If the other team is just blatantly not going to
cover you, you have to step up and bury it," said Lol
lie, a Seattle native. "I don't care about the points,
we just really needed a win today."
Stanford scored a season-low 25 points in the first
half, but found enough of an offensive rhythm in the
second half to overtake the Huskies.

Forward Brent Williams, silenced in the first half
on 0-for-5 shooting, exploded for 16 in the second
half. It was deja vu for Williams, who scored 12 in the
second half against Washington State after a score
less first half.
"We were out of sorts in the first half," Mont
gomery said. "We have a real problem with patience
and Washington was taking Adam away pretty well.
We needed guys to move the ball and find the open
man."
Keefe's primary contribution to the win was
rebounding. In the first eight minutes he only
touched the ball twice on the offensive end, and
didn't take a shot for 13 minutes.
Although he finished with 16 points and 16
rebounds, only four of Keefe's points came from
Stanford's set offense. Denied the ball, he scored 12
