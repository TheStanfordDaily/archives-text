## 
### Tish Williams Staff writer 
After a huge victory over Michigan
two weeks ago, the Stanford men's
swimming team suffered a let down last
Friday, narrowly losing to USC, 123-
118. The weekend was not a totail loss,

Stanford heads to the Olympic Trials in
Indianapolis, Indiana.
Against USC, the Cardinal's force

meter backstroke, while freshman Ray
Carey won the 200-meter butterfly, and
sophomore Tyler Mayfield captured the
200 breaststroke.
Throughout the season Stanford's
dual-meet success had rested on the
results of the freestyle events, an area
where the Cardinal encountered tough
competition from the Trojans. By taking
three of the four individual races, USC
gained the upper hand on the talented
Cardinal squad.

The freestyle events got away from
Stanford, with the Trojans winning the
1500-50-and 200- meter freestyle
swims. Freshman Chris Baskett won
the 400-meter freestyle, the only Cardi
nal freestyle victory.
The meet came down to the last
event, the 400-meter free relay. USC,
which had already showed its domi
nance in the freestyle events, edged
Stanford out for the win. The loss was
the first for the No. 1 ranked Cardinal.
Undaunted, Stanford showed cham
pionship style on Saturday, coming back
