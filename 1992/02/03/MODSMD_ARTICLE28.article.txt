# Gymnasts nearly upset Lady 'Cats

It could have been worse for
Breck Greenwood.
While Greenwood's 13th-ranked
Stanford Cardinal women's gym
nastics team could not pull off an
upset of eighth-ranked Pacific-10
rival Arizona at Burnham Pavil
ion Friday night, the coach was
able to keep his head in both the
literal and figurative senses.
After vowing to his charges that
if they defeated a top 12 squad, he
could be given a "Butch" haircut,
Greenwood saw the Cardinal gym
nasts set a school record for points
with 189.75, only to fall short to a
red-hot Wildcat team that put up
190.35.
Foremost among several Stan
ford highlights was the perfor
mance of freshman Jene Elzie,
who set a school record in the all
around with 38.55 points out of a
possible 40, bettering Sheri
Evenson's previous mark by an
astounding fifteen-hundreths of
a point. Included in the total
were an outright victory on the
uneven bars, where Elzie gar
nered a 9.70; a first-place tie in
the floor exercise, where she tal
lied a 9.75; and a 9.55 on the bal
ance beam to pace Stanford's
scorers.
"That's what we thought Jene
would do," said Greenwood after
the meet. "She's an outstanding
gymnast."

Also making an outstanding
showing for the Cardinal was
Kerri Kanuka, a sophomore who
broke most of Stanford's records
a year ago but was competing in
her first all-around of 1992 after
off-season surgery. Kanuka
totalled 38.30 for the four events,
and was the Card's top scorer
with a 9.60 in the vault (an event
won by defending national cham
pion Anna Basaldua of Arizona,
who earned a 9.90); she also tied
Elzie with a 9.75 on the floor.
"Nuke," as Kanuka is known to
her teammates and coaches,
enjoyed an excellent season debut
on the beam as well, where her
9.50 was just a notch below
Elzie's score.
"I wasn't nervous. I was just
happy to be in the all-around and
happy to be competing on the
beam again," Kanuka said.
"Back on the beam" would be a
fair assessment of Stanford's
team as a whole at this stage of the
season. The Cardinal boasts only a
1-2 dual meet record, but Green
wood is quick to point out that
when invitations for the regional
and national championships are
extended, the NCAA's law is "It's
not if you win or lose, but how
many points you score."
In putting up its best mark
ever, the Card has certainly not
diminished its chances of moving
up in the polls and doing late
season damage to some top
teams.
