# Cardinal uses strong pitching to take 2 of 3 from Bulldogs
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Those that live by their pitching also
will die by their pitching. The Stanford
baseball team proved that this may be a
true maxim. The Cardinal took two out of
three games from Fresno State, but in
doing so, they proved that their pitching
might be the dominant factor in many of
their games this season.
Friday's game saw a Fresno State
team reminiscent of last year's College
World Series squad; solid pitching and a
torrid 15 hits never allowed the Cardinal
to get in the game, as the Bulldogs won
11-3.
There were great expectations for
Stanford starter Willie Adams in his first
appearance of the season after a phenom
enal off-season. However, those expecta
tions weren't met Friday as Adams
looked strong early, but couldn't keep up
with the Bulldog bats, and gave up six
runs through five innings. Cardinal Greg
Mix came in to pitch the sixth and effec
tively erased all hopes of a Cardinal
comeback by getting nailed for five runs
without recording an out. However, in an

effort at consolation, sophomore Andrew
Lorraine, junior John Lynch and fresh
man Todd Laßocca pitched one inning
each of mop-up relief for the Cardinal, all
looking fairly impressive.
Meanwhile, Fresno State's starter,
Jim Patterson, was systematically mow
ing down Stanford batters. After six
innings, Stanford batters managed only
four hits, as the Bulldog right-hander
struck out six while only walking one.
The lone bright spot of the game at the
plate for the Cardinal came from senior
third baseman Tony Detter, who hit a
two run shot in the top of the ninth.
However Saturday was, as they say, a
whole new ball game. Stanford tried a
new predominantly right handed line-up
to face the Bulldog left-handed starter,
Mike Salazar. Sophomore Jeff Des-
Jardins started at second instead of
senior Chris Kemper, and freshman Jed
Hansen started at third rather than Det
ter. In the role of designated hitter,
sophomore Nate Olmstead gave way to
freshman Dusty Allen — and did he ever
deliver. With two out in the bottom of the
sixth, with the Cardinal down 5-3, Allen
solved the puzzle that was Salazar. After

walks to Jeff Hammonds and Mark
Skeels, Allen blasted a Salazar offering
over the left-center field wall. Stanford
eventually won the game 10-5.
"The freshmen and sophomores
played very well," coach Mark Marquess
said. "They're going to be good players,"
"They'll play a lot this year."
The starter for Stanford was Jamie
Sepeda, who like Adams, started strong.
However, the fourth inning was not kind
to the junior right hander, as Fresno
State hit two home runs in the inning.
The next inning, after Sepeda gave up a
double and another dinger, coach Mar
quess finally thought it would be a good
idea to lift Sepeda, and inserted junior
transfer Rick Helling.
The highly touted debut of the right
hander proved not to be a disappoint
ment, as in his first inning of work,
Helling picked off a runner and struck

out two. The next inning, he struck out
the side. In the seventh, after striking out
yet another Fresno State batter, Helling
evidently was tiring from throwing such
heat, as he walked consecutive batters.
No problem. Marquess inserted senior
Aaron Dorlarque, who pitched the
remaining two and a third innings nearly
perfectly, allowing a hit but striking out
four.
The rubber game Sunday turned out
to be a pitcher's duel. The starter for the
Cardinal was hard throwing junior
Brian Sackinsky. Although Fresno State
ended up outhitting Stanford 9-4, the
Cardinal won the game 3-0. The win saw
the Cardinal take advantage of every
opportunity to manufacture runs, some
thing they will have to do all year to
keep winning.
In the second, after a wild pick off
throw let David Holbrook get to third,
Steve Solomon hit a bunt single to drive
Holbrook in. In the seventh, a walk, an
error and a double steal saw Solomon at
second and Allen at third, when Dave
Cornell hit a controversial bouncer off
home plate which ended up scoring
Allen. The power-laden Cornell, who is

asserting himself as a large part of the
Cardinal's offense so far this young sea
son, also hit a solo home run in the
third, the first of his college career.
Sackinsky pitched six very effective
innings, allowing no runs on six Bulldog
hits, striking out three. Junior Tim
Moore came in to pitch the last three
innings, which he did well— allowing no
runs on three hits to complete the
shutout.
"[Sackinsky] pitched very well," Mar
quess said. "He had a good fastball, and
was getting his curveball in there. He's
really getting into a groove."
"What really impressed me about
these first four games is that [our pitch
ers] are going out there and throwing
strikes."
For the series, Stanford was out-hit
34-20, which shows that the Stanford
pitching and ability to etch out their runs
will become increasingly important as the
Cardinal faces tougher opponents in the
upcoming weeks. However, Fresno State
has an established baseball program, and
with Cal-State Fullerton coming to town
next weekend, taking 2—of—3 from the
Bulldogs is a great confidence booster.

ers] are going out there and throwing
strikes."
For the series, Stanford was out-hit
34-20, which shows that the Stanford
pitching and ability to etch out their runs
will become increasingly important as the
Cardinal faces tougher opponents in the
upcoming weeks. However, Fresno State
has an established baseball program, and
with Cal-State Fullerton coming to town
next weekend, taking 2—of—3 from the
Bulldogs is a great confidence booster.
Those that live by their pitching also
will die by their pitching. The Stanford
baseball team proved that this may be a
true maxim. The Cardinal took two out of
three games from Fresno State, but in
doing so, they proved that their pitching
might be the dominant factor in many of
their games this season.
Friday's game saw a Fresno State
team reminiscent of last year's College
World Series squad; solid pitching and a
torrid 15 hits never allowed the Cardinal
to get in the game, as the Bulldogs won
11-3.
There were great expectations for
Stanford starter Willie Adams in his first
appearance of the season after a phenom
enal off-season. However, those expecta
tions weren't met Friday as Adams
looked strong early, but couldn't keep up
with the Bulldog bats, and gave up six
runs through five innings. Cardinal Greg
Mix came in to pitch the sixth and effec
tively erased all hopes of a Cardinal
comeback by getting nailed for five runs
without recording an out. However, in an

effort at consolation, sophomore Andrew
Lorraine, junior John Lynch and fresh
man Todd Laßocca pitched one inning
each of mop-up relief for the Cardinal, all
looking fairly impressive.
Meanwhile, Fresno State's starter,
Jim Patterson, was systematically mow
ing down Stanford batters. After six
innings, Stanford batters managed only
four hits, as the Bulldog right-hander
struck out six while only walking one.
The lone bright spot of the game at the
plate for the Cardinal came from senior
third baseman Tony Detter, who hit a
two run shot in the top of the ninth.
However Saturday was, as they say, a
whole new ball game. Stanford tried a
new predominantly right handed line-up
to face the Bulldog left-handed starter,
Mike Salazar. Sophomore Jeff Des-
Jardins started at second instead of
senior Chris Kemper, and freshman Jed
Hansen started at third rather than Det
ter. In the role of designated hitter,
sophomore Nate Olmstead gave way to
freshman Dusty Allen — and did he ever
deliver. With two out in the bottom of the
sixth, with the Cardinal down 5-3, Allen
solved the puzzle that was Salazar. After

walks to Jeff Hammonds and Mark
Skeels, Allen blasted a Salazar offering
over the left-center field wall. Stanford
eventually won the game 10-5.
"The freshmen and sophomores
played very well," coach Mark Marquess
said. "They're going to be good players,"
"They'll play a lot this year."
The starter for Stanford was Jamie
Sepeda, who like Adams, started strong.
However, the fourth inning was not kind
to the junior right hander, as Fresno
State hit two home runs in the inning.
The next inning, after Sepeda gave up a
double and another dinger, coach Mar
quess finally thought it would be a good
idea to lift Sepeda, and inserted junior
transfer Rick Helling.
The highly touted debut of the right
hander proved not to be a disappoint
ment, as in his first inning of work,
Helling picked off a runner and struck

out two. The next inning, he struck out
the side. In the seventh, after striking out
yet another Fresno State batter, Helling
evidently was tiring from throwing such
heat, as he walked consecutive batters.
No problem. Marquess inserted senior
Aaron Dorlarque, who pitched the
remaining two and a third innings nearly
perfectly, allowing a hit but striking out
four.
The rubber game Sunday turned out
to be a pitcher's duel. The starter for the
Cardinal was hard throwing junior
Brian Sackinsky. Although Fresno State
ended up outhitting Stanford 9-4, the
Cardinal won the game 3-0. The win saw
the Cardinal take advantage of every
opportunity to manufacture runs, some
thing they will have to do all year to
keep winning.
In the second, after a wild pick off
throw let David Holbrook get to third,
Steve Solomon hit a bunt single to drive
Holbrook in. In the seventh, a walk, an
error and a double steal saw Solomon at
second and Allen at third, when Dave
Cornell hit a controversial bouncer off
home plate which ended up scoring
Allen. The power-laden Cornell, who is

asserting himself as a large part of the
Cardinal's offense so far this young sea
son, also hit a solo home run in the
third, the first of his college career.
Sackinsky pitched six very effective
innings, allowing no runs on six Bulldog
hits, striking out three. Junior Tim
Moore came in to pitch the last three
innings, which he did well— allowing no
runs on three hits to complete the
shutout.
"[Sackinsky] pitched very well," Mar
quess said. "He had a good fastball, and
was getting his curveball in there. He's
really getting into a groove."
