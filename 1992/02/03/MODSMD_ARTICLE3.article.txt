Two students who made homo
phobic remarks directed at Otero
Resident Fellow Dennis Matthies
will not be prosecuted under the
Fundamental Standard, accord
ing to Dean of Students Michael
Jackson.
First-year law student Keith
Rabois, senior Michael Ehrman
and junior Bret Scher entered
Otero on their way to a party the
night of Jan. 19, according to
Rabois.
William Shepherd, the head
advising associate at Otero, said
he was sitting in the dorm lobby
when he saw the students pass.
"A moment later, I heard a voice
screaming, 'Faggot! Faggot!,'" he
said.

"I watched the three of them
walk ... to Madera. The entire
time, one of them continued to
scream comments, including,
'Faggot! Hope you die of AIDS!'
and 'Can't wait 'til you die, fag
got!' These remarks were all
directed at the RF cottage."
Rabois confirmed those
remarks "in substantive con

made by he and Ehrman were
"reasonably close to that."
Scher did not say anything at
the time, according to Rabois.
Matthies said he assumed the
comments "were about me, but
they were not spoken to me."
However, he said he is not homo
sexual and did not know why the
students thought he was. "You'd
have to ask them," he said.
Jackson said the students will

not be prosecuted under the stan
dard because it is too narrowly de
fined to be applied to the incident.
"There is a very narrow area
within which we can apply the
interpretation," he said. Accord
ing to Jackson, University offi
cials "want to be able to take judi
cial action . . . (but) you can't
always prosecute individuals for
these actions."
However, Jackson and Law
Prof. Thomas Grey differed in
their interpretations of the Fun
damental Standard.
The 1990 interpretation of the
standard, authored by Grey, says
that speech constitutes harass
ment if it "is intended to insult or
stigmatize an individual ... on
the basis of their sex, race, color,
