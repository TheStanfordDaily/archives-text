They did not send their top four competi
tors, but the Stanford men's gymnastics team
still took second place in team competition at
the Cal-Poly San Luis Obispo tournament this
Saturday, gaining some valuable experience in
the process.
With Olympic hopefuls Tim Ryan and Jair
Lynch resting on the Farm, the Cardinal
relied on the help of recovering star Mark
Booth and a strong performance by Chris Sey.
Coach Sadao Hamada was very pleased
with the team's impressive performance on
the pommel horse where Shawn Adamek and
Booth both registered a 9.7 score.
In the high bar competition, Sey posted an

excellent score of 9.7 while Booth contributed
with a 9.2. Both gymnasts registered a 9.3 in
the parallel bar competition.
Booth continues to recover from a foot in
jury he suffered last year. Following Hama
da's counsel, the sophomore competed in only
four events and made several intentionally
irregular dismounts.
"Mark is a young and upcoming athlete and
we want to exercise caution," said Hamada in
regards to his star's watered-down routine.
"He should be 100 percent by the beginning of
March."
Hamada expressed concern about the
team's performance in the rings and vaulting
competitions in which his gymnasts failed to
break the 9.0 barrier.
Nonetheless the coach was pleased with the

tournament experience his gymnasts gained,
especially freshmen Evan Wells and Oliver
Demree.
Santa Barbara beat second-place Stanford
by only 1.5 points even though the Cardinal
sent in its second string. Hamada vows that
come Valentine's day, his squad will begin to
put up some big scores in team competition.
Other universities that competed included
Cal-Poly, Sacramento State, Sam Jose State
and the University of Calgary.
In addition to Ryan and Lynch, Jeff Bender
and Josh Stein spent their Saturday preparing
for next weekend's Winter Nationals in Col
orado. The top forty-eight gymnasts in the
United States will compete in the tournament
that marks the first step towards the Olympic
team.
