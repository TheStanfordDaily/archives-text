# SHAC organizes for 'homeless' students as 10 day series begins

A 10-day series of programs to raise awareness about
homelessness kicked off last night as about 30 students
participated in a game simulating homeless life.
The "Single Occupancy Room" game was part of
"Face the Music: Raising Awareness About Home
lessness Through the Arts," a student-run program
which will continue through Feb. 12.
It was facilitated by San Francisco State University
students Michael Eaton and Charmaine Dederer, rep
resentatives of the Bay Area Homelessness Program.
Each student was given a wallet that contained indi
cations of his or her lot in life: different-colored tokens
signifying money, peace of mind, health and status.
Various stations were placed around the Tresid
der Oak West lounge to represent different places in
the Tenderloin area in San Francisco. At each sta
tion students lost or gained some of the tokens.
"If you have a lot of everything, you don't have to
worry about anything," said sophomore Molly Parker, a
director of the Stanford Homelessness Action Coalition.
"Last time I played I hardly had anything. I was
living on the edge. If you have a finite amount of
stuff, you're always stressed," she said. "It's like two
different games."

This simulation offered participants the "opportu
nity to experience living on the edge of homelessness,"
one student said in the discussion following the game.
Sponsored by the Stanford Homelessness Action
Coalition, the series of events will also include a ben
efit concert, a drama production and a film. The
Women's Center, the Stanford Socialist Club and
the Bay Area Homelessness Program are co-spon
soring some of the programs.
"We chose the arts as the medium because it is a
good vehicle for raising awareness, for communicat
ing, while still getting across the message of philo
sophical, ethical and social responsibility," said
sophomore Theo Emery, a director of the homeless
ness coalition.
"Our society has been created with an economy
that dictates an 8-percent unemployment rate at all
times. This is hard to overcome," Emery said.
"Poverty is not a new issue. However, now we see
that the 'respectable' people, the middle class, not
just the lower class, is being affected."
"Stanford people may not be immune to home
lessness in their future," said senior Tracy Clay, a
liaison between the homelessness coalition and the
