# SHAC organizes for 'homeless' students as 10 day series begins
## 
### Marie Save de Beaurecueil 
A 10-day series of programs to raise awareness about
homelessness kicked off last night as about 30 students
participated in a game simulating homeless life.
The "Single Occupancy Room" game was part of
"Face the Music: Raising Awareness About Home
lessness Through the Arts," a student-run program
which will continue through Feb. 12.
It was facilitated by San Francisco State University
students Michael Eaton and Charmaine Dederer, rep
resentatives of the Bay Area Homelessness Program.
Each student was given a wallet that contained indi
cations of his or her lot in life: different-colored tokens
signifying money, peace of mind, health and status.
Various stations were placed around the Tresid
der Oak West lounge to represent different places in
the Tenderloin area in San Francisco. At each sta
tion students lost or gained some of the tokens.
"If you have a lot of everything, you don't have to
worry about anything," said sophomore Molly Parker, a
director of the Stanford Homelessness Action Coalition.
"Last time I played I hardly had anything. I was
living on the edge. If you have a finite amount of
stuff, you're always stressed," she said. "It's like two
different games."

This simulation offered participants the "opportu
nity to experience living on the edge of homelessness,"
one student said in the discussion following the game.
Sponsored by the Stanford Homelessness Action
Coalition, the series of events will also include a ben
efit concert, a drama production and a film. The
Women's Center, the Stanford Socialist Club and
the Bay Area Homelessness Program are co-spon
soring some of the programs.
"We chose the arts as the medium because it is a
good vehicle for raising awareness, for communicat
ing, while still getting across the message of philo
sophical, ethical and social responsibility," said
sophomore Theo Emery, a director of the homeless
ness coalition.
"Our society has been created with an economy
that dictates an 8-percent unemployment rate at all
times. This is hard to overcome," Emery said.
"Poverty is not a new issue. However, now we see
that the 'respectable' people, the middle class, not
just the lower class, is being affected."
"Stanford people may not be immune to home
lessness in their future," said senior Tracy Clay, a
liaison between the homelessness coalition and the

Haas Center for Public Service.
"A lot of people are slipping
through the cracks."
Stanford Homelessness Action
Coalition has a three-pronged
action plan that includes educa
tion of the Stanford community,
political advocacy and direct ser
vice in the neighboring communi
ties, Emery said.
"Most of the time public ser
vice implies a 'Messiah complex'
of social responsibility — a sense
of hierarchy in which we must go
lower to help," said Emery.
"SHAC's philosophy doesn't
accentuate hierarchy — we work
with homelessness, not for home
lessness."
The series continues tonight
with a panel discussion focusing
on the problems of homeless
women at 7:30 in the Women's
Center, which is co-sponsoring
the event.
"We want to break the stereo
types people have of the home
less," said Clay. "When people
think of the homeless, they think

of men. Women and children are
the most common homeless, but
the least seen."
Several other events will take
place during the next 10 days:
• A panel discussion on student
involvement in the fight to end
homelessness will be held at 7
p.m. tomorrow in Larkin.
"Students feel some powerless
ness because of their physical sep
aration from the homeless,"
Emery said. "But there are options
beyond the 'Band-Aid' solutions
sometimes proposed. Students can
help by being thoughtful about
what they are doing with their
lives and by assessing their own
value system to see how they can
end this problem."
• An Academy Award-winning
film called "No Hunger in My
Home" will be shown at 6:30 p.m.
Wednesday in Kimball Hall. Pro
duced by a Stanford student, this
film documents and explores
issues of poverty in East Palo
Alto.
• A benefit concert featuring
Stanford singing and dancing
groups will be held Thursday
night. Performers will include
Counterpoint, Fleet Street, Ballet
Folklorico and the Alpha Phi

Alpha Step Show.
The proceeds will go to several
philanthropic groups, including
the San Francisco Coalition for
Homelessness and the Haven
Family House of San Mateo. The
concert will also include several
speakers.
• A theater group of eight
homeless actors will perform in
Ricker Dining Center Friday.
They will give a portrayal of life
on the streets.
"This is a way of getting reality
into the Stanford bubble. In this
nice, isolated environment, people
don't think about homelessness,"
said junior Jessica Haberer, a
director of SHAC. "We have the
potential to help end the problem."
• A panel discussion about
ways individuals can make a dif
ference will be held at 8 p.m. on
Feb. 10 in the Florence Moore
Lounge. "We want to tap into the
power of individuals by educating
the larger population," said Clay.
"We must eliminate the 'Not In
My Backyard' factor, which has
held people back."
• The events will conclude Feb.
12 with a program featuring a
photo essay on homeless children
by photojournalist Jim Hubbard.
