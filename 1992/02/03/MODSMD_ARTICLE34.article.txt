# Hip Hop breaks 'ethnic barriers'
## 'Funky' bimonthly event declared overall success

The disc jockey leans over his turntables with the
concentration of a surgeon. "Check the Rhime" by A
Tribe Called Quest flows effortlessly into "The
Choice is Yours" by Blacksheep.
The people go wild. The song inspires new life in
the sweating, gyrating crowd. Hip-hop heads leap up
and down to the rhythms of the booming bass and
agitated break beats that characterize rap music.
Another Black fraternity party? Maybe a club's
dance floor, or a scene from the movie "Juice"?
Try the Coffee House on a Friday night.
Hip-Hop Night has hit Tresidder Union, and
some say Stanford's social scene will never be the
same. For the past two weeks, the Coffee House has
shed its role as a Friday night drinking spot to
become Stanford's premier dance club. Steamy win
dows, sweat and bodies in motion have superseded
quiet conversation.
The event, co-sponsored by KZSU and Ujamaa
House, is the brainchild of three upperclassmen â€”
Omar Wasow, Jim Haljun and Pat Dote.
Wasow said he was inspired by his desire to hear
more black music at the venue, as well as to disinte
grate social barriers. He brought his idea to Haljun,

the Coffee House's entertainment coordinator.
Haljun said he shared Wasow's desire to "break
out of the traditional genre of music that has been
the mainstay of Coffee House entertainment." The
two contacted Dote, a KZSU representative, who
helped provide the equipment, music and DJs neces
sary to make their idea a reality.
The event, by all accounts, has been an over
whelming success.
"It's the livest thing to ever hit Stanford," sopho
more Anthony Clark said.
According to freshman Daniel Baldonado, "It's hip,
it's got a funky beat and I can really bug out to it."
Haljun summarized the program's multicultural
angle, saying that "people felt respected for who
they were."
No one ethnicity could "claim the party," Wasow
said of the first Hip-Hop Night Jan. 17. "Everybody
was there enjoying themselves. . . . That's part of
the value of doing it in neutral territory like the
Coffee House, where different people feel comfort
able."
Hip-Hop Night takes place every other Friday at
the Coffee House. The next Hip-Hop Night will be
Feb. 14, with the KZSU Drum Posse's Kutmaster
Kurt as DJ, followed by KMEL's Colt 45 two weeks
later.
