# Styrofoam recycled on campus
## Piloted program starts strong despite single location 
### Kristina Aberg 
Students can now add Styro
foam cups to the cans, bottles and
newspapers they have grown
accustomed to recycling. For the
past month, Stanford Recycling
has been collecting polystyrene,
also known as Styrofoam.
They began the pilot program
after speaking with a Palo Alto
landfill which had successfully
implemented a similar program,
according to Stanford Recycling
Manager Steve McCaffrey.
McCaffrey said that since Sty
rofoam recycling is still a pilot
program in its experimental
stages, there will be no collection
at campus residences yet. Instead,
they are encouraging people to
bring their Styrofoam to the drop
off center at Stanford Recycling,
located behind the Stanford Fed
eral Credit Union.
Despite the single location,
McCaffrey said the program is off

to a good start. "We're getting as
much as we can handle," he said.
"People who want to recycle will."
Stanford Recycling serves both
the Stanford community and the
surrounding areas. People come
from Menlo Park and San Jose to
recycle at Stanford, according to
McCaffrey. He said the program
also provides convenience for
those who recycle.
"Before, people would bring
some of their recyclable goods to
us and have to take the rest to
Palo Alto," said junior Michael
Franz, who works for Stanford
Recycling. "Now they can drop
everything off here."
Styrofoam will join other prod
ucts, like high-density polyethy
lene plastics like that used for
milk cartons and laundry boxes,
on the list of materials that are
recycled at Stanford but in few
other communities.
The Styrofoam Stanford col
lects will eventually be com

pressed and sent to Free-Flow
Packaging in Redwood City. There
it will be turned into "peanuts,"
which will be used for packaging.
The program, started during
winter break, has so far collected
approximately 600 pounds of Sty
rofoam. "There seems to be a
greater volume as people find out
about it," Franz said.
If this program is successful,
pick-up service to student resi
dences may be implemented, as
well as other recycling services.
Stanford Recycling would like to
expand to such areas as film and
mixed plastics, McCaffrey said, but
the office is limited financially.
Presently, the University pays
for all services conducted on the
Stanford campus, while other ser
vices are paid for independently.
According to McCaffrey, a
recent study showed that Stan
ford recycles 25.4 percent of the
waste it generates, making it one
of the leaders in the county.

David Padilla drops his styrofoam at the Stanford Recycling center. The program, still in its experimen
tal stages, is not being collectied at campus residences, but according to manager Steve McCaffrey,
"We're getting as much as we can handle."
