# Costs battle entering new phase
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
After last March's indirect-cost hearing, local
newspapers were filled with headlines recounting
shocking revelations of waste and abuse at Stanford.

Last week's congressional hearing
seemed to confirm what University
officials have been saying all along —
that the indirect-cost controversy is
not uniaue to Stanford.

The lack of flashy revelations about Stanford may
mark a shift in the indirect-cost investigation to sys
temic problems and a more complex contractual
debate.
Last March, the House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations criticized University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy about yachts, bedsheets and

other instances of inappropriate costs.
And during the weeks before last week's hearing,
subcommittee staff members were promising more
exciting revelations of abuses at Stanford.
But what was revealed instead was a "systemic"
problem at universities nationwide, as officials testi
fied that the fault for the indirect-cost controversy
lies with both universities and the government.
Indirect-cost overcharges occurred because the
rules "were inadequate for determining which types
of costs should be allowed. . . . Universities general
ly lacked adequate systems and internal controls . . .
and lax oversight practices by the cognizant federal
agencies resulted in universities claiming excessive
indirect costs," testified J. Dexter Peach, assistant
comptroller general for the General Accounting
Office.
Officials at both Stanford and
the Office of Naval Research
agreed that no new charges
against the University were
raised last week.
Instead, subcommittee staff
members emphasized a criminal
investigation into the Universi
ty's accounting practices, and the
San Francisco Chronicle and
Examiner put it on the front page.
But last Thursday's story was
nothing new. In fact, The Chroni
cle reported the same story on
Jan. 30, 1991 — exactly one year
earlier.
"Navy opens criminal probe at
Stanford," was that day's head
line, as the Naval Investigative
Services formally began a crimi
nal probe into the University's
indirect-cost practices.
The only recent information
about Stanford at the hearing
came when the Defense Contract
Audit Agency formally released a
study claiming that Stanford
overbilled the government by
$231 million between 1981 and
1988 — news that had been
"leaked" to the media several
weeks earlier.
While the huge numbers
attracted plenty of attention, the

real issues behind them remain
ignored.
MOUs don't grab headlines
The DCAA study concluded that
"the government should retroac
tively cancel the memoranda of
understanding with Stanford,"
according to Fred Newton, deputy
director of the audit agency.
The memoranda were indirect
cost reimbursement agreements
between Stanford and the govern
ment that allowed the University
to charge a higher rate than would
normally be allowed. All but one of
the 125 MOUs were abruptly can
celed for fiscal year 1991 by the
government last April.
Paul Biddle, the on-campus
Navy regulator, has repeatedly
argued that the arguments are
invalid because of the "cozy" rela
tionship between the University
and previous negotiators from the
Office of Naval Research. Navy
lawyers have said the agreements
can be canceled retroactively.
But Stanford's Legal Office and
Arnold & Porter, the Washington,
D.C., firm that represents the
University, have said the MOUs
are legal, binding contracts that
cannot be abolished 10 years later.
While the Navy has not yet
tried to cancel the MOUs for the
1980s, Stanford has already chal
lenged last year's cancellation
with the Armed Services Board of
Contract Appeals — a lengthy

legal action usually taken only by
major defense contractors.
And the University is not the
only side taking the matter to court.
Media turns on Biddle
The controversial Navy regula
tor always manages to stay in the
headlines, whether through his
qui tarn suit alleging the Universi
ty overbilled the government $480
million during the 1980s or last
week's bitter, 38-page attack on
Stanford sent to Board of Trustees
President James Gaither.
The qui tam suit has brought
the Department of Justice into
the Stanford indirect-cost contro
versy, as it is required to investi
gate the situation and decide
whether to join Biddle's suit.
And the controversy made head
lines again during the days before
last week's hearing. The subcom
mittee released Biddle's letter to
Gaither and his letter to Rear Adm.
William Miller, chief of naval
research, asking to be appointed an
independent inspector general to
audit indirect-cost practices at uni
versities nationwide.
Only four weeks ago, Biddle
appeared to hold the support of
local citizens and media. An
unscientific poll conducted by The
Peninsula Times Tribune found
that readers by a 2-to-l margin
thought Biddle was doing a good
job. A San Jose Mercury News
editorial suggested that he be put

in charge of indirect-cost investi
gations on a national level.
But The Times Tribune has
suddenly shifted its position. An
editorial Saturday stated that, in
light of his recent actions, "Bid
die's tenure has outlived his use
fulness" and that he has "lost his
credibility," making it "time for
Biddle to go."
Process is far from over
The subtle shift from sexy
headlines to the impending legal
battle suggests that the issue is
probably a long way from being
resolved.
Biddle may be seeking to
escape now that the excitement is
lessened. He will likely decide
Thursday whether to begin a
campaign for the seat of either
Rep. Tom Lantos, D-San Mateo,
or Sen. John Seymour, R-Calif.
The legal action with the board
of contract appeals is still in its
infancy, as both sides have
already sought extensions.
For now, the University strug
gles with its provisional indirect
cost recovery rate of 55.5 percent
— a $28 million reduction in the
University's operating budget.
And while Stanford's rate will
likely go back up, the controversy
is no longer over minor but glam
orous infractions. Instead, the
University's fate lies in the reso
lution of hundreds of millions of
dollars in MOUs.
After last March's indirect-cost hearing, local
newspapers were filled with headlines recounting
shocking revelations of waste and abuse at Stanford.

fied that the fault for the indirect-cost controversy
lies with both universities and the government.
Indirect-cost overcharges occurred because the
rules "were inadequate for determining which types
of costs should be allowed. . . . Universities general
ly lacked adequate systems and internal controls . . .
and lax oversight practices by the cognizant federal
agencies resulted in universities claiming excessive
indirect costs," testified J. Dexter Peach, assistant
comptroller general for the General Accounting
Office.
Officials at both Stanford and
the Office of Naval Research
agreed that no new charges
against the University were
raised last week.
Instead, subcommittee staff
members emphasized a criminal
investigation into the Universi
ty's accounting practices, and the
San Francisco Chronicle and
Examiner put it on the front page.
But last Thursday's story was
nothing new. In fact, The Chroni
cle reported the same story on
Jan. 30, 1991 — exactly one year
earlier.
"Navy opens criminal probe at
Stanford," was that day's head
line, as the Naval Investigative
Services formally began a crimi
nal probe into the University's
indirect-cost practices.
The only recent information
about Stanford at the hearing
came when the Defense Contract
Audit Agency formally released a
study claiming that Stanford
overbilled the government by
$231 million between 1981 and
1988 — news that had been
"leaked" to the media several
weeks earlier.
While the huge numbers
attracted plenty of attention, the

real issues behind them remain
ignored.
MOUs don't grab headlines
The DCAA study concluded that
"the government should retroac
tively cancel the memoranda of
understanding with Stanford,"
according to Fred Newton, deputy
director of the audit agency.
The memoranda were indirect
cost reimbursement agreements
between Stanford and the govern
ment that allowed the University
to charge a higher rate than would
normally be allowed. All but one of
the 125 MOUs were abruptly can
celed for fiscal year 1991 by the
government last April.
Paul Biddle, the on-campus
Navy regulator, has repeatedly
argued that the arguments are
invalid because of the "cozy" rela
tionship between the University
and previous negotiators from the
Office of Naval Research. Navy
lawyers have said the agreements
can be canceled retroactively.
But Stanford's Legal Office and
Arnold & Porter, the Washington,
D.C., firm that represents the
University, have said the MOUs
are legal, binding contracts that
cannot be abolished 10 years later.
While the Navy has not yet
tried to cancel the MOUs for the
1980s, Stanford has already chal
lenged last year's cancellation
with the Armed Services Board of
Contract Appeals — a lengthy

legal action usually taken only by
major defense contractors.
And the University is not the
only side taking the matter to court.
Media turns on Biddle
The controversial Navy regula
tor always manages to stay in the
headlines, whether through his
qui tarn suit alleging the Universi
ty overbilled the government $480
million during the 1980s or last
week's bitter, 38-page attack on
Stanford sent to Board of Trustees
President James Gaither.
The qui tam suit has brought
the Department of Justice into
the Stanford indirect-cost contro
versy, as it is required to investi
gate the situation and decide
whether to join Biddle's suit.
And the controversy made head
lines again during the days before
last week's hearing. The subcom
mittee released Biddle's letter to
Gaither and his letter to Rear Adm.
William Miller, chief of naval
research, asking to be appointed an
independent inspector general to
audit indirect-cost practices at uni
versities nationwide.
Only four weeks ago, Biddle
appeared to hold the support of
local citizens and media. An
unscientific poll conducted by The
Peninsula Times Tribune found
that readers by a 2-to-l margin
thought Biddle was doing a good
job. A San Jose Mercury News
editorial suggested that he be put

in charge of indirect-cost investi
gations on a national level.
But The Times Tribune has
suddenly shifted its position. An
editorial Saturday stated that, in
light of his recent actions, "Bid
die's tenure has outlived his use
fulness" and that he has "lost his
credibility," making it "time for
Biddle to go."
Process is far from over
The subtle shift from sexy
headlines to the impending legal
battle suggests that the issue is
probably a long way from being
resolved.
Biddle may be seeking to
escape now that the excitement is
lessened. He will likely decide
Thursday whether to begin a
campaign for the seat of either
Rep. Tom Lantos, D-San Mateo,
or Sen. John Seymour, R-Calif.
The legal action with the board
of contract appeals is still in its
infancy, as both sides have
already sought extensions.
For now, the University strug
gles with its provisional indirect
cost recovery rate of 55.5 percent
— a $28 million reduction in the
University's operating budget.
And while Stanford's rate will
likely go back up, the controversy
is no longer over minor but glam
orous infractions. Instead, the
University's fate lies in the reso
lution of hundreds of millions of
dollars in MOUs.
After last March's indirect-cost hearing, local
newspapers were filled with headlines recounting
shocking revelations of waste and abuse at Stanford.

Last week's congressional hearing
seemed to confirm what University
officials have been saying all along —
that the indirect-cost controversy is
not uniaue to Stanford.

The lack of flashy revelations about Stanford may
mark a shift in the indirect-cost investigation to sys
temic problems and a more complex contractual
debate.
Last March, the House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations criticized University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy about yachts, bedsheets and

other instances of inappropriate costs.
And during the weeks before last week's hearing,
subcommittee staff members were promising more
exciting revelations of abuses at Stanford.
