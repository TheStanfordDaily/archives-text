# Police investigating possible mail scam

Does earning thousands of dollars stuffing
envelopes in your spare time sound enticing?
Would-be stuffers responding to a classi
fied ad making this promise may find them
selves victims of a national scam instead,
according to the Stanford Police.
The advertiser and the Stanford post
office box to which respondents were direct
ed are currently under police and U.S. Postal
Service investigation in conjunction with
what officials believe may be a national
chain-letter scam.
"We just want to let everyone know that

the word out is 'Buyer Beware,' " police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said.
The original ad, which ran in The Daily
during the week of Jan. 21-24 and on Jan.
31, read: "EARN $1000s PROCESSING
MAIL! Send SASE: CJ Associates, Box
10277, Stanford, CA 94309."
The ad was scheduled to appear in this
week's issues, but has been removed because
of the investigation.
According to Niemeyer, individuals who
sent their self-addressed stamped envelope to
the Stanford post office box have received a
flyer requesting a refundable $18 processing fee
in exchange for the materials they would need

to begin stuffing at a rate of $7 per envelope.
The flyer's return address is a Chicago
based company called Perpetual Income.
However, once the $18 fee has been
mailed in, Niemeyer said job-seekers never
see it again. Instead of envelopes to stuff, the
company allegedly sends more flyers and
tells respondents that they will receive a
cash bonus if they circulate the flyers among
their friends in chain-letter fashion.
"It's all kind of clever," Niemeyer said.
"The Chicago address leads us to believe
that it's a national scam, but it seems that
they get stringers placing ads in
local communities to do their dirty
work."
Sophomore Jason Todd Cohen,
who placed the ad and holds the
post office box in question, said he
was solicited to place the ad after
responding to a similar ad which
appeared in The Daily from Nov.
7 to Dec. 4.
"I had no idea that it could be
some kind of a scam," Cohen said,
adding that he has not been con
tacted by the police or the U.S.
Postal Service.

"I just wanted to check it out
to see if it was for real," he said.
The original ad, which promised
"fast easy income" and "100s
weekly," directed inquiries to a
Chicago post office box.
After mailing in the $18 fee,
Cohen said he received a letter
from Perpetual Income promising
him an unspecified percentage of
the company's profits if he placed
another ad using his own post
office box.
Cohen admitted that the ficti
tious company, CJ Associates, is
actually his own initials reversed.
Although eight people have
responded to his ad, Cohen said
he has yet to receive a commis
sion.
