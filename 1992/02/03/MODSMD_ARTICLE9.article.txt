Obscene 'survey' calls reported
Several Stanford women have been harassed by an obscene
caller claiming to be conducting a magazine survey, according to
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
The male caller typically asks his victims questions about per
sonal habits and hygiene before progressing to more sexually
explicit questions, Niemeyer said.
Approximately 20 obscene calls have been reported in two
weeks. All the victims are women who have their phone numbers
listed in the Stanford Directory.
None of the victims have received repeat calls.
"There's no telling how many others have been called,"
Niemeyer said. "A lot of the victims are probably too embarrassed
by the calls to report them."
Although the police encourage victims to report any obscene
phone calls, they do not expect to find the culprit.
"It's virtually impossible to trace calls, particularly if they're
made from off campus," Niemeyer said. "Anyone who receives a
call should just say those three little words - goodbye weirdo."
Similar incidents were reported to the Stanford Police in Jan
uary of 1991. Two female students said a man claiming to be from
the "U.S. Department of Health" asked them survey questions of
a general nature and then gradually became more specific in ask
ing about sexual conduct.
Prof wins research grant
An assistant professor of medicine and pharmacology received
a $90,000 grant from the American Cancer Society this month for
immune system therapy research.
The one-year grant will allow Dr. Phyllis Gardner to spend a
sixth year studying a cellular process that may lead to therapies
for AIDS and better drugs for suppressing the part of the immune
system that causes patients to reject transplanted organs.
Her laboratory is working to understand the mechanism by
which calcium flows into activated T cells, which are important in
fighting off infection. The calcium entry triggers a signal that
activates the cells.
The American Cancer Society supported approximately 35 pro
jects at Stanford last year, providing $1.6 million in research funds.
