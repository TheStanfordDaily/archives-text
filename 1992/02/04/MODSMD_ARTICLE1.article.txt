# Officials to fight hate speech with public pressure
## 
### Steve McCarroll Editorial staff 
Stanford officials unable to
apply University judicial stan
dards to incidents like the Jan. 19
harassment of Otero Resident
Fellow Dennis Matthies may
instead make the cases public to
bring the pressure of public disap
proval upon the participants,
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole
said yesterday.
The inapplicability of the Fun
damental Standard to the inci
dent has also raised concerns
about the standard's narrowness,
according to Cole.
She said she is particularly
concerned about the fact that the
standard applies only to abuses
directed against other students.
"I think it's unfortunate," Cole

said. "It may actually call for con
vening [the Student Conduct Leg
islative Council] to consider
rewriting it and making it consis
tent with other student conduct
policies."
But as the policy now stands,
Cole said, "It is important to rec
ognize that not everything that's
offensive can be prosecuted."
According to Cole, discussing
such incidents in a public forum
"may be more effective than a
confidential process that nobody
ever hears about."
During the incident in question,
first-year law student Keith Rabois
and sophomore Michael Ehrman
disturbed residents in Otero as
they passed by the RF cottage next
to the freshman dorm.
