# Self-defense class seeks funds for next year
## 
### Alain Dalva Staff writer 
Women's self-defense may not remain an
academic class if the budget axe falls on the
Innovative Academic Courses program.
Last night, the collective made up of
instructors teaching the Issues in Self-Defense
for Women SWOPSI class met to determine
whether they can teach the class next year.
"We teach self-defense for women all over
the Bay Area and have lots of opportunities to
be paid all over the Bay Area," said self-defense
instructor and alumnus Alyson Yarus. Yarns
said she was speaking on behalf of the collec
tive, called Women Defending Themselves.
"But we would like to continue teaching at
Stanford because we feel attached to it," Yarus
added. "We will do anything in our power to
continue teaching here, within reason. But we
need help."
The lAC program, which includes the Stan
ford Workshops on Political and Social Issues,
or SWOPSI, has been offering SWOPSI 174 A
for more than 10 years. The School of Human
ities and Sciences has proposed eliminating
the lAC program as part of its attempt to cut
its budget by about $5 million.
"In cutting SWOPSI 174 A, [the University
is] not just cutting a unique academic experi
ence, but also a part of the safety network,"
said Susan Epstein, coordinator of student
sexual assault prevention education and refer
ral resources.
In a December 1991 letter to the school,
Epstein cited a 1989 Rape Education Project sur

vey which showed that "over one-fourth of under
graduate women students and over one-third of
graduate women students were the victims of
unwanted sexual activity due to coercion."
The course is a three-unit class with a 300-
page reader, a required action project and two
papers. It teaches women how to defend them
selves and become more assertive in a society
that raised them "not to fight back," according
to Epstein.
The four University administrators respon
sible for the self-defense program remain
uncertain of its future.
Margo Horn, the lAC program director,
said she does not know what will happen to
the course, but hopes another place will be
found for it.
Carolyn Lougee, senior associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences, said that Dean of
Undergraduate Studies and Graduate Studies
Anne Peck is responsible for the future of the
program.
Lougee added that from 1982 to 1987,
when she was the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, there was a guaranteed "funding
line" for the course, which meant it did not
need to compete with other classes for money.
Peck declined to comment on the program
and suggested that Associate Dean and Eco
nomics Prof. Roger Noll might have more
information about the program's future.
But Noll said he does not know anything
about "budget circumstances" and that the
future of SWOPSI 174 A on campus was
"Margo Horn's decision."
Senior Jennifer Corbin, a SWOPSI 174 A

instructor, stressed the positive impact of the
course, saying that it has "empowered" female
students and has "opened their eyes to a lot of
issues."
Corbin said it would be "a crying shame" if the
course could not be offered to female Stanford
students again. She said the course has been so
successful that of the women who show up, only
one out of three can get into the class each quar
ter, when three 12-member sections are offered.
"Because of the huge demand for the class,
someone at a higher administrative level
should locate a budget for continuing to teach
self-defense for women," Epstein said.
"If the University can't make this campus
safe for half of the population, then perhaps it
should revoke Jane Stanford's commitment to
coed education," she added.
According to Epstein, the only expenses for
SWOPSI 174 A are the instructors' salaries
since the course's equipment, facilities, course
readers and advertisements are not paid for by
the University.
Women Defending Ourselves is planning an
open meeting in White Plaza Friday at noon to
talk about how to save the class from being cut.
Three-hour weekend workshops are current
ly held in Tresidder Union to accommodate the
overflow of women interested in self-defense.
Senior Liz Noteware, an instructor of the
Tresidder class, stressed that although the
one-day workshops are different from the 10-
week academic class, their future on campus is
also "endangered" because they are financed
by Tresidder, whose funds were targeted by
recent budget cuts.

said she was speaking on behalf of the collec
tive, called Women Defending Themselves.
"But we would like to continue teaching at
Stanford because we feel attached to it," Yarus
added. "We will do anything in our power to
continue teaching here, within reason. But we
need help."
The lAC program, which includes the Stan
ford Workshops on Political and Social Issues,
or SWOPSI, has been offering SWOPSI 174 A
for more than 10 years. The School of Human
ities and Sciences has proposed eliminating
the lAC program as part of its attempt to cut
its budget by about $5 million.
"In cutting SWOPSI 174 A, [the University
is] not just cutting a unique academic experi
ence, but also a part of the safety network,"
said Susan Epstein, coordinator of student
sexual assault prevention education and refer
ral resources.
In a December 1991 letter to the school,
Epstein cited a 1989 Rape Education Project sur

vey which showed that "over one-fourth of under
graduate women students and over one-third of
graduate women students were the victims of
unwanted sexual activity due to coercion."
The course is a three-unit class with a 300-
page reader, a required action project and two
papers. It teaches women how to defend them
selves and become more assertive in a society
that raised them "not to fight back," according
to Epstein.
The four University administrators respon
sible for the self-defense program remain
uncertain of its future.
Margo Horn, the lAC program director,
said she does not know what will happen to
the course, but hopes another place will be
found for it.
Carolyn Lougee, senior associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences, said that Dean of
Undergraduate Studies and Graduate Studies
Anne Peck is responsible for the future of the
program.
Lougee added that from 1982 to 1987,
when she was the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, there was a guaranteed "funding
line" for the course, which meant it did not
need to compete with other classes for money.
Peck declined to comment on the program
and suggested that Associate Dean and Eco
nomics Prof. Roger Noll might have more
information about the program's future.
But Noll said he does not know anything
about "budget circumstances" and that the
future of SWOPSI 174 A on campus was
"Margo Horn's decision."
Senior Jennifer Corbin, a SWOPSI 174 A

instructor, stressed the positive impact of the
course, saying that it has "empowered" female
students and has "opened their eyes to a lot of
issues."
Corbin said it would be "a crying shame" if the
course could not be offered to female Stanford
students again. She said the course has been so
successful that of the women who show up, only
one out of three can get into the class each quar
ter, when three 12-member sections are offered.
"Because of the huge demand for the class,
someone at a higher administrative level
should locate a budget for continuing to teach
self-defense for women," Epstein said.
"If the University can't make this campus
safe for half of the population, then perhaps it
should revoke Jane Stanford's commitment to
coed education," she added.
According to Epstein, the only expenses for
SWOPSI 174 A are the instructors' salaries
since the course's equipment, facilities, course
readers and advertisements are not paid for by
the University.
Women Defending Ourselves is planning an
open meeting in White Plaza Friday at noon to
talk about how to save the class from being cut.
Three-hour weekend workshops are current
ly held in Tresidder Union to accommodate the
overflow of women interested in self-defense.
Senior Liz Noteware, an instructor of the
Tresidder class, stressed that although the
one-day workshops are different from the 10-
week academic class, their future on campus is
also "endangered" because they are financed
by Tresidder, whose funds were targeted by
recent budget cuts.
