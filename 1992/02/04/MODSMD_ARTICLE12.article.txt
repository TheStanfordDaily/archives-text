Ozone hole may soon develop over U.S.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The highest levels of ozone-destroy
ing chemicals ever measured have been found in the skies over
the northern hemisphere, making it likely an ozone hole will
develop this winter over parts of the United States, Canada and
Europe, NASA scientists said Monday.
"Everybody should be alarmed about this," said Michael J.
Kurylo, manager of the upper atmosphere research program at
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. "We're see
ing conditions primed for ozone destruction. It's in a far worse
way that we thought."
Kurylo said that aircraft and satellite instruments have mea
sured levels of chlorine monoxide, a man-made chemical byprod
uct, at up to 1.5 parts per billion, the highest levels ever record
ed.
The levels are high enough, he said, to destroy ozone at the
rate of 1 percent to 2 percent a day for brief, late-winter periods.
With conducive weather conditions, the northern ozone layer
could be depleted by 30 to 40 percent, he said
Kurylo said the areas of depleted ozone found by NASA satel
lites extended as far south as New England and France during
parts of January.
"We're not concerned with just remote areas now," he said.
"What we're dealing with extends to very populated regions in the
northern hemisphere."
Plan will improve phone link with Cuba
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Bush administration has
approved a plan for improved telephone communications with
Cuba, using a formula that will permit cash payments to the
island despite the U.S. economic embargo, it was disclosed Mon
day.
Officials said while Cuba may gain financially, the arrange
ment is consistent with long-standing U.S. policy of enabling
Cubans to learn more about the outside world.
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said
AT&T has replaced an undersea cable between the two countries
that wore out in 1987. As a temporary measure, a radio telephone
link has been used but it, too, has been wearing out.
In December, AT&T received permission from the U.S. gov
ernment to propose to the Cubans a formula for giving Cuba a
share of the revenues generated by the new cable, Ms. Tutwiler
said. Once agreement is reached, the cable can be put into opera
tion, she said.
She said the new formula is a departure from past policy
because the revenues Cuba has been earning from the radio link
and from the previous undersea cable were placed into a blocked
account to which Cuba had no access.
