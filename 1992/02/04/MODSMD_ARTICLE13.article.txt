# New group seeks to improve education
## 'Forum' explores possible reforms 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
A new group headed by School
of Education Dean Marshall
Smith is working to find innova
tive ways of reforming the United
States' crumbling school system.
The group, the Pew Forum for
K-12 Education Reform, was
designed to examine changes in
kindergarten through 12th-grade
education.
Its goal, Smith said, is to
"improve the overall quality and
equality of education in the Unit
ed States" by studying existing
reform proposals or creating new
ones.
The group's task is made more
difficult by the fact that "this
country has never had a debate
about what children should
learn," Smith said.
He noted that there is "a grow
ing consensus in using two meth
ods of reform, top-down and bot
tom-up." The group will study
that idea in order to "get govern
ment parts to work together and
support education," Smith said.
The forum, based at the Cub
berley School of Education, was
organized last year with a four
year grant from the Pew Charita
ble Trusts, a national foundation
based in Philadelphia.
The 25- to 30-member group
meets three to four times a year
in different cities. The next meet
ing will be held this month at
Stanford.
According to Smith, the forum
is a chance for discussion between
"people who rarely have the

chance to talk off the record about
how reforms are working."
Many times, Smith said, edu
cational reports are "tailored to
the press" and are not completely
honest about the success of
reforms.
The February meeting will
focus on "content frameworks or
standards," Smith said. "In other
words, what is the impact of set
ting out common curricular goals
at the state or national level?"
According to Smith, govern
ment control has often "impeded
reform" in the past. Education
reform existed mainly at the local
level, in individual schools, and
now "there is no common concep
tion of where United States
schools should go," he said.
The forum will produce several
publications, including a newslet
ter discussing the major themes
of each meeting, to be distributed
to people involved in education
reform; pamphlets explaining dif
ficult educational issues to the
public at large; a student publica
tion; and occasional papers and
studies.
Smith is assisted in running
the forum by Ramon Cortinas,
superintendent of San Francis
co's schools, and Edward Fiske,
former education editor of the
New York Times.
Other members of the forum
include Albert Shanker, the pres
ident of the American Federation
of Teachers, Sonia Hernandez,
the director of education policy
for the state of Texas and Milbrey
McLaughlin, professor of educa
tion at Stanford.
