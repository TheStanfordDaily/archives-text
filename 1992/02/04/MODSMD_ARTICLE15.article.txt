University should fund
existing programs to aid
sexual assault survivors

Both the Issues in Self-Defense
for Women SWOPSI course
and the position of Coordina
tor for Sexual Assault Prevention
Education and Response are in seri
ous danger of being swept away by
the University's $43-million budget
crisis.
These two resources are an
essential part of the overall program
Stanford has created to address the
crucial issue of sexual assault. With
out these resources, the University
will cripple its ability to meet the
needs of victims and accomplish the
task of increasing awareness in the
Stanford community.
The self-defense class does not
just teach women methods of
physical defense. It also provides
assertiveness training, a funda
mental skill that should be mas
tered long before any potentially
dangerous encounter arises.
Assignments for the class are
drawn from readings containing
graphic depictions of the violence
experienced by the authors. These
show victims that their experiences
are not unique; moreover, they
educate women in ways that mere
pamphlets and workshops cannot.
This class has been consistently
popular with Stanford students.
Due to limited enrollment, at least
half the women who show up are
turned away during the first ses
sion of every quarter.
Creating the position of coordi
nator for sexual assault marked
another necessary step toward
improving and increasing available
resources on campus.
The coordinator is responsible
for providing information, expand
ing the numerous rape education
efforts by students and faculty,
acting as a representative for vic
tims and referring them to the ser
vices that can best address their

needs. Students can go to this cen
tral source for both factual and
emotional advice.
The ASSU has emphasized the
importance of this position by pro
viding $45,000 to fund the coordina
tor position and related program
ming. The move was intended to
jump-start the University's commit
ment to ensure that these services
are available to Stanford students.
During this time at Stanford
when hundreds of valuable pro
grams and services are facing pos
sible elimination, it is vitally
important for the University to
determine its priorities. Surely, the
guarantee of personal safety for all
students must be among the top
priorities.
In addition, there is a legal issue
the University cannot afford to
ignore. California state law now
requires colleges to implement
assault policies and adopt written
procedures providing victims with
information and appropriate treat
ment. Students who feel that they
have not been adequately serviced
can sue Stanford.
One way to prevent such a sce
nario is to tap into financial
resources available outside the Uni
versity. For example, a $20 million
federal financial aid grant estab
lished by the Violence Toward
Women Act expressly for sexual
assault prevention is awaiting use.
Those administrators who can
start the process of applying for
this and other forms of assistance
should be pressured. The money is
there and these two programs
need it r ., 0 â€¢ , v , r t
Students have shown their sup
port of the issue by turning out in
large numbers for the self-defense
class and financially supporting
the prevention position. The state
of California has highlighted the
primacy of the issue by establish
ing the law requiring a clear policy.
Even during the pressing times
brought on by the budget crunch,
it is imperative that the University
recognize the significance of these
moves and immediately take
action of its own.
