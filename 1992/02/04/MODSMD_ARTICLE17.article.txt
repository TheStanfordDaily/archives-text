## The

IAM SO GLAD TO BE ALIVE right
now. Thank God I didn't have to fight
against slavery. Thank God I didn't
have to fight for civil rights, for women's
rights or fight a nation's hysteria against
Japs or Commies. I'm a middle-class
American citizen, and it's 1992. Amen,
says George Bush. Amen, I say.
Amen because I can run for president.
I can be president. Even though I men
struate. Even though I'm not Christian.
Even though I eat with chopsticks. Oh
sure, hey, I believe it 'cuz that's what
they told me, right? I can do anything I
want to do, be anything I want to be. I got
it down on paper. Ain't that the truth.
Damn, it's good to be alive!
And I fear it.
My father likes to tell me how the
world is changing so fast now, what with
the Berlin Wall, the Soviet Union and
all. And I look around and read about
today's neo-Nazis in Germany, families
supporting David Duke and angry
Americans afraid that the Japanese are
taking over this country. I stare at the
pictures on TV and in Time Magazine
and U.S. News & World Report. Girls
cheering with their parents at a Duke
rally. Young men with fists raised in a
German square â€” Hitler's children. Lee
lacocca vowing that Japan must buy
U.S. goods. And I turn cold inside
because I have seen the threat of vio
lence in the face of prejudice.

People carry an anger and fear inside,
a hatred of the Other, of those different
from themselves in size, in color, in
speech, touch, ritual, history. They are
the immigrant, the disabled. They are the
colored, the native. It's them against us,
but they're running us out of our towns,
out of our businesses, our homes, our liv
ing.
Only I don't think I'm one of Us,
though I've tried hard enough to be
white and normal, socially acceptable.
The model minority. But it doesn't real
ly work anymore, even if I wanted it to.
In my lifetime, it has always truly been
the Other that was overtly ostracized,
kicked around and kept down. As a mid
dle class accent-less Chinese-American, I
escaped the physical violence and the
racial slurs from anyone but other chil
dren. But things are going down, hard
and fast.
To compound the already existing
prejudice against immigrants, I fear
that the anger of Americans against the
Japanese will be displaced onto
Japanese-Americans and others of Asian
descent. Would people be so outraged to
find instead that it is the British or some
other predominantly white European
country that owns most American busi
nesses? Why do we insist that Japan
import more goods from the U.S. than
they export to us? Is it some old imperi
alist notion? Are such policies and

stands a reflection of people's true senti
ments, or are they influencing our own
beliefs?
In high school, I was shocked by the
jeers of boys faking movie-talk Chinese.
But last summer it became more than
words. Before it could ever weigh in their
minds, another group of boys cast a
handful of rocks at my family on a Long
Island beach.
I am an adult, but how is it that I fear
now more than I ever did as a child? How
is it that I can fear a girl in a picture from
a magazine? A bby in a Germkrilsquaft;
or on a hot. sandy beach? They are peo
ple I never would have feared as my
peers.
In Shirley Jackson's short story "The
Lottery," the victim of stoning is selected
by chance, but today there is more than
just randomness in the growing violence
of prejudice. Who will answer now for the
boys on the beach who threw the first
stones? "My God, what would your par
ents say if they knew?" I thought to ask.
How I laugh at that.
