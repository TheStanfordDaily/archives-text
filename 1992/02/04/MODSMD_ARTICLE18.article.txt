## Michael Jackson Community should condemn homophobic harassment 
### 
During the evening of Jan. 19, three
mule students entered the Otero
lounge looking for Madera, anoth
er house in Wilbur Hall. They exited the
lounge upon learning of their mistake,
making — witnesses say — obscene
remarks, mostly directed at the Resident
Fellow. This escalated to shouted obscen
ities, and when they reached the RF cot
tage they yelled: "Faggot! You are going
to die of AIDS! You're gonna get what's
coming to you, you're gonna get what's
coming to you! Damn faggot!"
I want to put a big spotlight on the
actions of these individuals. I invite oth
ers to join me in condemning their
behavior, the meanness and viciousness
behind it, and in expressing our shock
that Stanford students would deliberate
ly behave in so disgusting and hurtful a
manner.
How did these students react when

confronted about their behavior?
Student No. 1, a senior undergradu
ate, met with the residence dean and
insisted that he did not make the offen
sive remarks, though admitting they
were made. He was polite and cooperative
and provided the name of the third stu
dent involved.
Student No. 2, a junior undergradu
ate, denied all wrongdoing in a loud and
blustery manner. The RD told him to
speak quietly and respectfully when in
her office. He calmed down, lowered his
volume and said: "I made no such com
ments; I am here to speak for myself,
though. This is absolutely ridiculous. I
said nothing wrong."
Student No. 3, a first-year law student
and former Stanford undergraduate,
refused to meet with the RD, telling her
over the telephone: "I will not talk to
administrative people about political

stuff. If you send me a copy of the RA's
report, I might consider responding to
you. I know exactly what is permissible at
this school, and I know I have not done
anything that is not permissible. Go
ahead and send it to Sally Cole if you
wish. ... Make my day!"
This student is right in the sense that
hateful speech of this sort cannot be pros
ecuted as a violation of the Fundamental
Standard. The 1990 interpretation con
cerning discriminatory harassment has
several restricting criteria, among them
that the speech or other expression must
be directed to the targeted person in a
face-to-face encounter.
This vicious tirade is protected speech.
Protection from judicial review and for
mal sanctions, however, does not trans
late to silence and inaction on other
fronts. Quite the contrary: we must loud
ly reject their mean-spirited actions

against a resident fellow and a valued
member of the Stanford community.
This speech may have been "free," but it
was also juvenile and brutal.
I hope that the three students will
think about their actions and find in
themselves the human decency that will
not allow such conduct in the future.
The incident presents a good example
of mean speech winning out over man
dated civility, which is one of the nega
tive outcomes of a democratic society. It
also, however, presents an invitation,
even an obligation, for the good citizens
of our community to speak out against
the few who care more for their consti
tutional rights than for their campus
community's need for respect and
decency.
