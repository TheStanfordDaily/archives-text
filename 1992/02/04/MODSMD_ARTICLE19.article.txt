Clinton episode unlike
the one involving Hart
I take issue with your editorial (Jan.
28) comparing the Gary Hart affair to
the Bill Clinton controversy. Clinton's
campaign is not engineering a "cover
up;" Clinton has done a good job of bal
ancing his right to privacy with his duty
to be "forthcoming."
Citing the Hart episode, your editorial
says Hart first challenged the press to fol
low him and was then caught conducting
an extramarital affair. The Clinton
episode, however, is not parallel. Rather,
the Star, a tabloid, paid (Jennifer Flowers
to air her accusations of adultery. In fact,
the Jan. 27 news conference at which
Flowers attacked Clinton's "60 Minutes"
interview was held in a Waldorf-Astoria

ballroom paid for by the Star.
Flowers told her story while standing
next to a poster of the Star's latest cover
detailing the supposed affair. Is that
journalism, or is it advertising? Flowers
won't reveal the amount the Star paid
her for her endorsement deal.
As your editorial said, "No one appre
ciates being suckered."

Jan Brady's champion
ought to shed blinders
At the risk of starting another heated,
campus-wide debate, I would like to
address M. Francisco Melcher's Jan. 27
letter in defense of Jan Brady. Mr.
Melcher, how well did you know this

character that you so ineptly champion?
Any loyal friend of the Brady house
hold would know that Jan's creation of an
imaginary boyfriend, George (and not
Howard, as you claim) Glass was necessi
tated by her deeply-felt jealousy toward
her more successful siblings.
This desperate yearning for social accep
tance by Jan was not her only pathetic display
of insecurity and her need to conform. Lest we
forget, Jan also made futile attempts at acting,
baton twirling, tap dancing, etc. All of these
factors contributed to Jan being characterized
as, yes, "sullen" and "embittered."
Mr. Melcher, shed your Brady blin
ders and accept the sad truth about your
superficial symbol of "successful" and
"sensitive" folk.

Polygamist ignores
gains of '60s feminism
Elizabeth Joseph, who was the subject
of an article in the Jan. 31 issue of The
Daily, certainly has the right to a partic
ular lifestyle (i.e. polygamy) and career,
but she does have those rights because of
feminism, which she so unfairly
slammed in her reported comments.
If Ms. Joseph dared have such a
lifestyle before the 19605, she would
likely be in jail or swinging from a tree
some place. She does those still strug
gling for fair treatment under the law a
great disservice by her smug and oblivi
ous comments.
