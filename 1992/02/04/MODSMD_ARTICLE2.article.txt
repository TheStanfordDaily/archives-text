# Celebration to focus on 'mind, body, soul'
## Black Liberation Month begins 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Today marks the beginning of
Black Liberation Month, which
will be highlighted by speakers,
performing arts and social events
celebrating the theme of "Getting
Black to the Basics: Mind, Body
and Soul."
This year's celebration empha
sizes the "need to get the commu
nity back to the basics of self
respect, respecting one another
and cultural pride," said Barbara
Smith, assistant director of the
Black Community Services Center.
The idea of "Mind, Body and

Soul" was to focus on "rebuilding
the family, health concerns and
spirituality," Smith said.
This year's celebration has
already felt the effects of the cen
ter's budget cuts. Due to a lack of
funds, it was necessary to seek co
sponsors for several scheduled
events. According to Smith, these
co-sponsors include organizations
not usually involved with the
black community.
For example, two of this year's
events, "Together We Stand:
Black Male/Female Workshop"
and "Positioning Ourselves For
Success in the '90s" are co-spon
sored by the Women's Center.
Budget cuts will have a even
more significant impact on next
year's Black Liberation Month,
Smith said, adding that the center
will "more than likely" seek out
side funds for the celebration.
Student coordinator Nelda
Brown said she hopes the events
will "pull people from throughout
the Stanford community," and
said she wants people to realize
they are open to the entire cam
pus as well as black students.
"I hate that it's just limited to
a month," she said.
The main event of Black Liber
ation Month, "Getting Black to
the Basics: Mind, Body and Soul,"
will take place Friday night in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, and will
feature keynote speeches by Law
Prof. Kim Taylor and Political
Science Prof. Lucius Barker.
The program will also include
student performances, poetry
readings and music addressing
the subject of rebuilding the black
community.

He said he hopes the "Chillout"
will make students, especially

that "the Harmony House is
here," and that the Center for
Black Performing Arts has intern
ships available for artistic projects.
The "Diaspora Get-Down" is
aimed at cross-cultural sharing,
and will feature Caribbean,

food and music. Elam said he
hopes the event will be a "com

tion black, as well as the rest of
