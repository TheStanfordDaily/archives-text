## Ordinary frosh posts outstanding numbers

Coming to Stanford ranked third in the
world in the 200-meter butterfly and pick
ing up a quick individual title at the Pacific
10 Conference Championships in Novem
ber, Ray Carey does not seem like an ordi
nary, everyday freshman.
Carey is one of the Stanford men's
swimming team's many hot prospects com
peting March 1-6 at the Olympic Trials in
Indianapolis for spots on the U.S. Olympic
team.
"Once and a while you get a guy to come
through your program that makes every
body around them better, and that's one of
Ray's characteristics," said men's swim
coach Skip Kenney. "He's one of the few
athletes that could possibly be a team cap
tain as a freshman."
"I am definitely at some points a gener
al clueless frosh," Carey said, but you
wouldn't guess by looking at his stats.
Hailing from Marblehead, Mass., Carey
bypassed high school swimming competi
tion to focus on training, and in his first
year on the Cardinal squad he's turning
heads.
Carey led the field in the 200-yard but
terfly at Pac-lOs, after dominating that
event in the dual-meet season for the Car
dinal, and is a definite U.S. medal hopeful
for Barcelona this summer.
However Carey is quick to attribute the
Stanford program and his teammates for a
successful training atmosphere and coma
raderie.
"(The team) is a group of so many guys
with such high goals. In practice everyone
is intense in the water, but between sets
people are joking. But we all know when
it's time to work. Everyone is so close, that

if you leave a workout down, you'll get a
phone call from someone telling you to
bounce back," Carey said.
Carey was the gold medalist in the 200-
meter fly in the World University Games
held last summer, and captured a bronze
medal in the 200 fly at the U.S. Swimming
summer meet.
One of the top recruits of the 1991 year,
Carey chose Stanford over the closer Har
vard, and now applauds his decision. "Col
lege is in every aspect better than what I
thought it would be. The team is closer
than I expected, and the life here is better,"
Carey said.
Training is a major emphasis for Carey,
who stresses that "you have to train with
perfection and intensity. People with great
training and great racing ability get really
far, but if you want to be the best in the
world you've got to have both ... to really
pound in a race."
This is an especially tough year for a
freshman swimmer, having to adjust to
Stanford life as well as feeling the pressure
of an Olympic year. Due to Olympic Trials,
the Pac-10 championship meet was moved
up from March to November, forcing Carey
to immediately switch over to the Stanford
swimming program and prepare for Pac
10s.
"I guess I can use the built-in excuse
that this is an adjustment year, like when
my parents call to see if I'm studying. Fall
quarter was my adjustment quarter, but
it's turning into an adjustment year. I just
hope it doesn't turn into an adjustment
undergraduate thing," Carey joked.
With Olympic Trials in March, Carey
does not feel over-pressured, and admits
that he can even look forward to the trials.
"I like to swim fast, and the feeling you

Swimming sensation Ray Carey may come across as another typical freshman, but his times in the butterfly are far from
average. Ranked third in the world, he is looking ahead to the U.S. Olympic trials in March.
