# Netters face Bulldogs, prep for Rolex
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
For four members of the Stan
ford women's tennis team,
today's 1:30 p.m. home match
against Fresno State serves a
dual purpose.
The showdown with the Bull
dogs provides an opportunity to
move closer to mid-season form as
well as a chance to work on specif
ic strokes for the Rolex Indoor
Championships later this week.
Heather Willens, Laxmi
Poruri, Kylie Johnson and Emma
Woodhouse will travel to Min
neapolis for the Feb. 6-9 tourna
ment. The Fresno State match
was originally scheduled for
Thursday but the conflict with
Rolex prompted the coaches to
move the contest to today.

"Obviously, our first goal is to
win the match," said Willens, the
No. 5 collegiate player in the
country. "But I want to work on
some things to prepare for
Rolex."
Improving her movement
around the court and playing
more aggressively are Willens'
goals. "For me, being aggressive
is not so much coming in on short
balls but moving the ball around
the court," she said.
With the Rolex Indoors
approaching, Willens is also
focusing on doubles. She and
Laxmi Poruri form the No. 3 tan
dem in the nation.
"Our goal is, when we poach,
the ball doesn't come back." Wil
lens said.
A player poaches by moving
horizontally at the net to cut off

an opponent's crosscourt shot
with a volley. Poaching is done
often when playing the net while
your partner is serving. The 'up'
player anticipates a crosscourt
return from the opponent, and
steps across and in to intercept
the return.
Then she usually punches the
volley at the feet of the opposing
net player or angles the ball off
the court. Successful doubles
teams will often poach on a
majority of their service points,
pressuring adversaries into weak
returns.
"[ln the last few matches)
we've been aggressive at net but
sometimes we haven't hit the ball
hard enough [on the poaches],"
Willens said.
Willens credits Poruri's strong
and versatile serve as one of the

reasons the pair's poaching is
effective. "She has real good
placement. I can tell her where to
hit [the serve] so I can poach and
she'll hit it right there," Willens
said.
Willens and Poruri are sched
uled for No. 1 doubles, followed by
Johnson and Woodhouse in the
second slot. Junior Mario Carruth
and freshman Amy Chiminello
will see action at No. 3.
All-Americans Willens and
Poruri lead the Cardinal in sin
gles with Johnson, Woodhouse,
Chiminello and Carruth round
ing out the top six.
Kristine Kurth is still nursing
a sore back she injured in mid-
January. The sophomore has not
been able to practice recently and
will probably be out for another
week.
