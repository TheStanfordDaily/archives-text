# O'Brien performs admirably at Volvo

### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
Yesterday at the Volvo Tennis Tournament
in San Francisco, Stanford senior Alex
O'Brien proved that he can play with the big
boys. In the first round, O'Brien split sets
with Frenchman Francisco Clavet — who is
ranked at around No. 30 in the world — before
dropping the third set.
"It was a very even match," said Cardinal
head coach Dick Gould. "The only difference
was a tad bit of experience. With a break here

or there Alex would've won the match."
After losing serve early in the first set,
O'Brien came back in the second. At 6-3, 5-7,
he had the momentum going. But suddenly,
Clavet had a few incredible reaction lobs and
O'Brien missed a volley and . .. the match was
over, 6-3 in the third.
Clavet is one of the highest ranked players
O'Brien has ever challenged. After a rough
week in practice though, the Stanford senior
came out and gave the Frenchman a run for
his money.
"This had to be a good confidence builder

for Alex," Gould remarked. "He wasn't at his
best going in, but he performed admirably —
not spectacularly — just regular Alex O'Brien
well."
Playing a professional of this caliber while
still in college seemed to be good for O'Brien,
according to Gould, because it gave him a
taste of what the professional tour will be
like in June, after graduation. "I think (hav
ing the opportunity to play opponents at this
high level) showed him that he's not losing
anything by staying here, in college," Gould
said.
