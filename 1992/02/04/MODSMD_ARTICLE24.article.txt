# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Both of Stanford's basketball teams like to
pound the ball inside to their big post players
on offense — that's where most of the teams'
points come from. Val Whiting and Adam
Keefe are the mainstays of the Cardinal squads.
But opponents know this and key their
defenses toward Stanford's main people, and
when those defenses are successful, other
Cardinal players have to step up and score.
That is exactly what this week's Athletes

of the Week is all about. When opposing
teams shut Whiting and Keefe down, junior
Molly Goodenbour and sophomore Brent
Williams took up the slack and led their
teams to big wins last week.
The 5-foot-6 Goodenbour is the starting
point guard for Stanford and is in charge of
the team's running game. After being behind
All-Americans Jennifer Azzi and Sonja Hen
ning for two years, she proved this weekend
that she is coming into her own as a Cardinal.
With Arizona's defense sometimes
putting three defenders on Whiting Thurs
day, Goodenbour took charge and bombed
away from the outside. She finished with a
career-high 23 points, including four-of
eight from behind the three-point line.
In addition to her offensive firepower,
Goodenbour added five assists and kept the
Stanford running attack going. A former
track standout in high school, she has the
endurance to run all day.
"Molly shoots the ball well, pushes the ball
well, and is playing with confidence, and the
players have confidence in her," said coach
Tara VanDerveer. "Molly's strength is run
ning, and no one can keep up with her. She's
a track athlete and she's very competitive."
Williams, a 6-6 redshirt sophomore from
Tacoma, Wash., made his offensive presence
felt this weekend in the second half of both
Cardinal games in his home state. While he
was held scoreless in the first half of both the
Washington State and Washington games,
he came on after the break each night.

Thursday against Washington State,
Williams contributed 12 points, but it was
his 16 second-half points against Washing
ton that really made him an Athlete of the
Week. After going zero-for-five in the first
half at Hec Edmundson Pavilion, Williams
came back with five-for-eight shooting from
the field and, more importantly, six-for
seven from the line to help give the Cardinal
a comeback victory over the Huskies.
