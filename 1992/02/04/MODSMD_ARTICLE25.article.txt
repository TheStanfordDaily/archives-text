# Spikers journey to Hawaii, win twice

### Laurie Wackier Staff writer 
Before heading to Honolulu
last weekend, Coach Ruben
Nieves commented that Hawaii's
large, vocal crowds and small, hot
gym make it a really tough place
to play volleyball. Nieves must
have neglected to mention that
small fact to his team.

Cardinal over Rainbows

15-9, 15-7, 15-11

15-13, 15-6, 15-8

In consecutive contests against
No. 7 Hawaii, Nieves' squad
proved that gyms and crowds
aren't a decisive factor when they
step on the court. Stanford man
aged to shut out the Rainbow
Wahines first on Friday, 15-9, 15-
7, 15-11, then again on Saturday,
15-13, 15-6, 15-7. The victories
improved Stanford's record to 3-0
in league play and 5-1 overall.
Despite the lopsided scores,
the trip wasn't exactly a vacation
for the Cardinal. "These matches
were closer than what the scores
show," Nieves explained. "They
weren't easy wins."
The stats indicate that Stan
ford definitely earned the wins.
On Friday, the squad compiled a
formidable .493 hitting percent
age, while holding their oppo
nents to a .273 offensive effort. In
case that wasn't convincing, the
Cardinal followed the feat with a
.429 team hitting performance in
Saturday's match.
Hawaii put up a battle in the

opening game of the series, trad
ing serves with the Cardinal,
before acquiescing to Stanford's
tenacious offense. Stanford final
ly pulled away from a nine-all tie
and claimed game one.
But that didn't seal the match.
Hawaii responded with a 6-1
jump on Stanford in the begin
ning of game two. "At that point,
the match was up for grabs,"
Nieves commented. Stanford
grabbed it. Fueled by Dave Goss,
Bob Hillman, and Duncan Black
man, the Cardinal attack over
whelmed Hawaii. "We kind of
wore them out. We came back and
took control of the match."
Once Stanford had control,
Hawaii failed to contain the Car
dinal hitters. Goss and Hillman
formed an unstoppable tandem in
Friday's match, punishing the
Rainbows with 27 and 25 kills,
respectively.
Although the Rainbows made
some personnel changes on Sat
urday, they suffered a similar dis
appointment. Hawaii came out
strong and posted an early lead in
game one, but once again couldn't
maintain it.
A persistent Cardinal team
was able to put together enough
sideouts to escape with a narrow
victory, establishing a momen
tum they carried through the
match. Stanford refused to relin
quish control, quickly defeating
Hawaii in games two and three.
Hitting accuracy highlighted
the weekend. Hillman had the
spotlight as he accumulated 44
hits in two short matches, en
route to a .570 average. "Bob had
an outstanding weekend," said
Nieves of the junior outside hit
ter. "He played two very solid,
complete matches."
