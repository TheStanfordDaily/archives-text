regattas, hosted by Orange Coast
and UC-Irvine, were the first two
of the eight-race South Series.
Stanford finished behind No.
2 Irvine in both races, who clear
ly dominated the 11-team compe
tition. Stanford entered two
boats in the regatta, one in each
A and B division. San Diego State
placed third in Saturday's regat
ta, while UC-Santa Barbara
claimed third on Sunday.
Despite the second place fin

ishes, Stanford's performance
was mediocre, according to Coach
Blake Middleton. "In both cases,
we did well in B division, but
didn't perform as well in A divi
sion," Middleton said. "We didn't
sail anywhere near our potential,
but the combined results were
enough to pull us through."
Saturday's A division team
consisted of skipper Matt San
ford, and crew Kristen Sidell.
Meanwhile, Charles Meade skip
pered for Stanford in B division,
accompanied by crew Katherine
Chen. The same personnel sailed
in Sunday's regattas, but the two
duos switched divisions.
Qualifying rounds for the
Pacific Championship continue
this weekend. Stanford sailing
will be represented along the
coast, as the South Series con
tinues at Santa Barbara, and
the North Series opens at UC-
Santa Cruz. The Pacific Cham
pionship is the preliminary com
petition for the National Cham
pionship.
