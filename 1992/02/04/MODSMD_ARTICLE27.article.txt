# Tough weekend for grapplers
## 
### Larry Liu Staff writer 
The Stanford wrestling team went on the road
this weekend to face Cal Poly-SLO and Cal State-
Bakersfield in consecutive day dual meets. The
underdog Cardinal ended up with a 23-23 tie with
Cal-Poly, but lost to Bakersfield 24-12.
Saturday, Stanford traveled to San Luis Obispo
to face Cal Poly. Though lacking wrestlers in two
weight divisions, the grapplers took five of the eight
matches in which they competed. This garnered
them a 23-11 advantage, but the two forfeits evened
up the team standings at 23 points apiece.
Wrestlers Matt Topham, Dave Nowick, and Jay
Jackson won decisive matches over their outclassed
opponents. Topham recorded three takedowns in
his 8-2 win. Fans also saw Nowick defeat Cal Poly's
Albert Talparez by a score of 16-5 and Jackson win
by a margin of 16-3.
The meet was highlighted by Lance Johnson's
and Mark Graham's pins. Johnson, returning from
a nagging shoulder injury, dominated his match
and took down his opponent 10 seconds before time
expired. Graham, holding on to a slim three point
lead, surprised everyone by pinning Cal Poly's
Aaron Cantrell one and a half minutes into the sec

ond period.
Sunday, the Cardinal found a much tougher
opponent in Cal State Bakersfield. Once again,
Stanford found itself at a 12 point deficit due to for
feits, but this time they could not make up the dif
ference.
Jackson, Johnson, Topham, and Graham won
their matches by margins of 5-3, 5-2, 4-3, and 8-5
respectively. But these minor decisions netted
Stanford only 12 total points, and the team fell 24-
12.
Coach Chris Horpel was satisfied with the grap
plers' effort this weekend, even though they did not
come out with a win.
"In traditional win-loss terms of dual meets, it
might not sound like we were successful this week
end. But individually we won nine out of sixteen
matches, so I am generally pleased.
"We're relatively healthy now .... And the
biggest area in which we've made progress is men
tal strength. We are tougher in close matches, and
signs of confidence and conditioning and just good
old grit are coming through. Things are falling into
place," Horpel said.
Horpel is confident that Stanford will do well in
next Saturday's matchup against San Francisco
State. The bouts will be held at SFSU and are
scheduled to begin at 7 p.m.
