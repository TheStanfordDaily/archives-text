## Black fraternities, sororities try to bond with local community

While working with underprivileged East
Palo Alto kids, Alpha Phi Alpha President Ron
Worthy kept thinking that many of his frater
nity brothers had been in the same position a
decade ago.
"Money isn't everything," he said. "They
can make it."
The fraternity founded the Alpha Boys
Club last year to help poor youth overcome

financial barriers — an example, Worthy said,
of the kind of activity Stanford's black frater
nal organizations want to be as well known for
as their step dance shows.
Several members of Stanford's five black
fraternities and sororities say their central
ized efforts to serve the local, regional and
national communities emphasize personal
bonding with the community.
The black organizations were originally
founded to create a social and intellectual

medium that would encourage tradition and
help uplift the black community in the face of
racial adversity, according to several mem
bers.
These national organizations evolved at the
turn of the century, when black college stu
dents sought to join organizations that would
cater to their specific needs as black college
students as well as their responsibilities to the
black community.
Rolanda Gaines, the vice-treasurer of
Alpha Kappa Alpha, explained that her sorori
ty "was founded for black women and by black
women to promote scholarship, sisterhood
and service."
According to Darlene Smith, president of
Delta Sigma Theta, one of the sorority's ser
vice commitments is to its national literacy
program, School America.
"We read to young children a couple of
hours a day to get them interested in reading,"
she said.
Last quarter Alpha Kappa Alpha "held a
Jump-rope-athon to raise money for the vic
tims of the Bay Area firestorm," Gaines said.
"This quarter they are hosting a Health
Fair and are regularly tutoring [East Palo
Altol students with Kappa Alpha Psi," she
added.
According to Cecil Buckner, president of
Kappa Alpha Psi, the fraternity is also "imple
menting a Guide Right Program where we
work with boys on a one-on-one basis."
The Omega Psi Phi fraternity also focuses
on community development. In addition to
their national Africare Release Fund, they
plan an Achievement Week program every
year and give scholarship funds, says Brian
Hooker, president of the fraternity.
