# Dropping in unannounced:
## USDA investigates treatment of animals 
### Chris Eisenberg Staff writer 
An inspector from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture made
a surprise visit to Stanford Uni
versity's Research Animal Facili
ty yesterday to investigate a possi
ble instance of animal mistreat
ment by a Stanford researcher.
During the unannounced
inspection, Dr. Homer Malaby
looked into a University report of
a researcher's misuse of laborato

ry animals. Such inspections rou
tinely take place two to three
times a year.
Dr. Thomas Hamm, chair of the
Department of Comparative
Medicine, the department respon
sible for the Research Animal
Facility, declined to comment on
the specifics of the claim yesterday.
However, he confirmed that
the University's Animal Care and
Use Panel was investigating a
misconduct report and that a
USDA inspector was also looking

into the case.
Hamm would not identify the
researcher, or the department in
which he or she works. Although
animal research is conducted in
the Medical School, the Biology
Department and the Psychology
Department, most of it is conduct
ed at the Medical School, Hamm
said.
According to Hamm, miscon
duct cases are uncommon, but do
happen occasionally.
"Maybe once or twice a year we

have a matter that's serious
enough that we close [a researcher]
down," he said. "If we close some
body down, then we by law have to
report it, but the government isn't
required to do anything."
However, Hamm added that
the government "may close down
the individual [researcher] or
they could conceivably close down
the whole University."
According to Dr. Ron Dehaven,
the regional director for the
USDA's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service, his division
will use the results of yesterday's
inspection to decide whether or
not to begin a full investigation.
"If we are satisfied that every
thing was properly resolved and
that there was no gross negligence,
we'll let it drop," Dehaven said.
However, if Malaby found evi
dence of misconduct, the depart
ment will investigate — although
Dehaven considered that scenario
unlikely. "I'll bet they've correct
ed the problem," he said, adding
that "if they haven't, we'll begin
an investigation."
A full investigation could take
several months, Dehaven said.
Government research funding
for experiments involving labora
tory animals could be jeopardized
by the investigation. Such drastic
action is unlikely but Dehaven
noted that "it is in the realm of
possibility."
According to Dehaven, the
facility's administrators demon
strated "genuine concern" by
reporting the incident to the
USDA "on their own initiative."
"It's to their credit that they
report this sort of thing,"
Dehaven said. *
Hamm agreed with the impor
tance of self-monitoring his facility.

The University Research Animal Facility opened its doors yesterday to a routine, unannounced investi
gation by a U.S. Department of Agriculture inspector who brought with him an extra mission — to make
inquiries into a charge that animals from the facility may have been mistreated.
