# Barrage of lewd calls takes toll
## 
### Scott Handleman Staff writer 
At least two men have been making obscene
phone calls to students on campus and in the sur
rounding area, including Palo Alto and Menlo Park,
according to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Undergraduates and graduate students in at
least six different campus residences said they
received the calls.
Distinct patterns of conversation mark two of
the callers, according to the students.
One man reportedly poses as a survey taker for
nonexistent magazines such as "Young Women of
Today" or "American Women." He opens a conver
sation by asking routine survey questions such as
the woman's name and age but soon becomes "more
and more aggressive in his questioning," according
to Niemeyer.
The questions include inquiries about personal
hygiene, sexual practices and the kind of underwear
the women are wearing, several women harassed by
the caller said.
Others said they were asked what they wore
when they slept and whether they were wearing a
bra. The caller backed off when one woman told
him that the questions were too personal, but then
gradually steered the conversation back to sex.
Several women said they were frightened when
the caller addressed them by name. He told others
he would see them in a certain class and hinted that
he was watching them.
A resident assistant in a freshman dorm said she
and another resident received a call late Sunday night.
Many of the calls were made Sunday evening and
night. Most of the calls reported to The Daily were
made that evening to rooms in which one of the res
idents had a last name beginning with "M" or "N."
The caller typically asked for that resident.
Niemeyer said no telephone surveys of that type
are being conducted on campus and advised that
women "say goodbye" to any caller pretending to be
taking one.
A second caller telephones around midnight, he
said. The man starts out by asking the woman 'Did
I wake you?' Niemeyer explained, but his conversa
tion soon becomes obscene.
Niemeyer said the police have received 12 com
plaints about obscene phone calls from the "survey
taker" and the "midnight caller"
in the last month, but added that
the statistic fails to reflect the fre
quency of the calls because "a lot
of people are probably not report
ing them."
Of nine women who reported
the calls to The Daily, only two
said they had told the police about
the incidents.
One junior said she received
her fourth obscene call Sunday
night. She received two during
fall quarter, which were "just
about sex stuff," and one last
week, in which the caller said he
"wanted to drink my urine."
Niemeyer said the callers are
not phoning from within the
Stanford system, but may be call
ing from a pay phone on campus.
The campus voice-mail system

was shut off for about 10 minutes
last Wednesday afternoon so
police could determine the time of
a threatening call left on a victim's
voice mail, according to Maureen
Trimm, assistant director of Com
munication Services Networking.
The voice-mail system had to be
turned off and restarted to find the
requested information, she said.
Referring to the wave of
obscene calls, Trimm said the Uni
versity "had a rash very similar to
this last year. We can't do a thing."
In January 1991, two female
students told the Stanford Police
that a man claiming to represent
the "U.S. Department of Health"
asked them survey questions
which became increasingly sexual
and explicit. The identity of the
caller was never discovered.
A 10-year survey conducted
between 1979 and 1988 revealed
254 complaints to the Stanford
police about obscene phone calls,
an average of 25 per year.
