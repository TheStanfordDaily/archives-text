## More than 1,000 took part in week-long tribute to John Cage 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
The music may be over, but
the success of John Cage Week
at Stanford lingers on.
The week of concerts, lec
tures and celebrations in honor
of the avant-garde thinker and
composer's 80th birthday was
a smashing success, according
to Charles Junkerman, associ
ate director of the Humanities
Center and coordinator of the
week's activities.
"I think it was just excel
lent," he said.
The week's activities includ
ed concerts of Cage's work, lec
tures by Cage, panel discus
sions and last Wednesday's
Musicircus, a giant melodic col
lage in which more than 200
musicians crowded Braun
Music Center, all playing their
individual selections simulta
neously.
Junkerman said he was
pleased with the success of the
whole weekend, and was particu
larly happy with the warm recep
tion the Musicircus received.
"People were very enthusi
astic about the Musicircus,"
Junkerman said, adding that
he had been initially wary
about the success of the event.
An estimated 1,000 to 2,000
people attended the event.
"We were all amazed that so
many people came," said
Humanities Prof. Marjorie
Perloff. "It just surpassed all
our expectations."
Junkerman said the Musi

circus may become an annual
event due to the outstanding
response to last week's event.
According to Junkerman,
two concerts of Cage's composi
tion "One 6", held last Thurs
day in Little Theater, sold out,
as did last Friday's retrospec
tive concert of Cage's music
held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
In addition, Junkerman said
approximately 500 people lis
tened to Cage's lecture "Here
Comes Everybody" last Tues
day, and nearly 700 people
attended an encore performance
of the lecture two days later.
According to Junkerman,
both the lectures and discus
sions will be published,
although no specific plans have
been made for their publication.
Junkerman said all profits
from the events went to the
Humanities Center, which
sponsored the celebration with
the Departments of Art,
Drama, English and Music.
Although Junkerman de
clined to comment on the exact
figures, he said the celebration
made enough money to "about
break even."
Cage left Stanford Saturday,
and could not be reached for
comment. However, Perloff
said Cage enjoyed his party.
"I think he was just 100 per
cent delighted," she said. "He
thought everybody was very
responsive and interested. His
reaction was totally positive."
Junkerman agreed that
Cage enjoyed the week. "I hope
we can do it again," he added.
