Stanford case will affect gay rights ruling
California's state Supreme Court has postponed its ruling on
gay rights in the workplace until a suit by Stanford athletes chal
lenging the NCAA's mandatory drug testing of college athletes is
resolved.
The gay rights ruling — which centers on the legality of psy
chological screening tests that ask job applicants personal ques
tions about sexual orientation and religious beliefs — was set aside
Friday until justices determine the scope of the right to privacy.
In the Stanford case, the court is likely to decide whether the
right to privacy, under the California Constitution, protects indi
viduals against intrusions by private, non-government entities,
and what kind of justification is needed for intrusions.
A Stanford diver, Simone Levant, initiated the suit when she
refused to undergo drug testing and sued the NCAA in 1987. A
Santa Clara County Superior Court injunction found in her
favor, ruling that mandatory drug testing violates athletes' right
to privacy — and that the state's right to privacy, unlike its fed
eral counterpart, applies to private as well as government intru
sions.
Two other Stanford athletes, football player Barry McKeever
and soccer player Jennifer Hill, joined the suit in 1988, and the
Santa Clara court also ruled in their favor.
The NCAA appealed the decision, and it is now under review by
the state court.
Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed a bill in September that would have
expressly forbidden job discrimination against homosexuals, say
ing it was unnecessary because discrimination was already illegal,
a position disputed by most gay rights advocates.

Researchers receive grant for major study
A team of Stanford researchers has received a grant to begin
the Computer Industry Project, a multidisciplinary study of firms
in the information industry.
Students and faculty members from the Graduate School of
Business, the School of Engineering and the Asia/Pacific
Research Center at Stanford are working together to produce
field-based research on the organizational and technological
dynamics of the computer industry.
Their research is divided into four interrelated areas: opera
tions; corporate organization and strategy; the structure and evo
lution of firms and industry; and global competition.
Several projects have already begun, including an ambitious
international survey of operational strategies for corporate success.
An industrial advisory committee of American, Japanese and
European companies will help the researchers to focus on issues
of immediate concern to the industry.
