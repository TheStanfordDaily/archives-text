# Bookstore brass enjoys perks unheard of elsewhere
## Vacation home is leased from business owned by the store's top two managers 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
For the last several years, the Stanford
Bookstore has been leasing a vacation
home in central California from a consult
ing firm privately owned and operated by
the Bookstore's top two managers, Eldon
Speed and Philip Chiaramonte.
In addition to thousands of dollars in
lease payments made to Speed and
Chiaramonte's consulting firm, the
Bookstore has spent more than $69,000
to furnish the two-story, 3,100 square
foot home, according to documents
obtained by The Daily. Among the pur
chases made with Bookstore funds were a
$4,341 hot tub, a $5,888 satellite dish
and a $3,681 comforter and bedroom set.
Located in Twain Harte, Calif., about
125 miles east of Stanford on the edge of
the Stanislaus National Forest, the home
is made available by the Bookstore free of
charge to families of many of its senior
employees.
For Speed, the Bookstore's general
manager, and Chiaramonte, its assistant
manager, the home provides a dual bene
fit. Since 1986, the house has been at
their disposal as a vacation facility at the
Bookstore's expense. And, because their
consulting firm owns the property, Speed

and Chiaramonte will be the beneficiaries
when it is eventually sold, profiting on
the investment by perhaps tens of thou
sands of dollars.
In the meantime, the Bookstore,
through its lease payments to the con
sulting firm, has effectively been paying
off $209,000 in loans Speed and Chiara
monte obtained in the mid-'Bos to finance
the construction of the home. Their con
sulting firm, called Colleagues Manage
ment Services, hasn't had a client in
years, according to Speed.
The lease arrangement was discovered
by The Daily as part of an investigation of
the compensation practices of the Book
store, a tax-exempt, nonprofit corporation
run independently of the University and
overseen by a board of directors composed
of Stanford faculty, staff and, in some
years, one or two Stanford students.
History Prof. Peter Stansky, the cur
rent president of the Bookstore's board,
contends the lease arrangement on the
Twain Harte house is a way to supple
ment the pension plans of Speed and
Chiaramonte, while at the same time pro
viding the Bookstore staff with "a quite
splendid" perquisite.
"Our aim is to reward people in the
