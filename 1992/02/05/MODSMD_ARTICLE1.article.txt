# Bookstore brass enjoys perks unheard of elsewhere
## Vacation home is leased from business owned by the store's top two managers 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
For the last several years, the Stanford
Bookstore has been leasing a vacation
home in central California from a consult
ing firm privately owned and operated by
the Bookstore's top two managers, Eldon
Speed and Philip Chiaramonte.
In addition to thousands of dollars in
lease payments made to Speed and
Chiaramonte's consulting firm, the
Bookstore has spent more than $69,000
to furnish the two-story, 3,100 square
foot home, according to documents
obtained by The Daily. Among the pur
chases made with Bookstore funds were a
$4,341 hot tub, a $5,888 satellite dish
and a $3,681 comforter and bedroom set.
Located in Twain Harte, Calif., about
125 miles east of Stanford on the edge of
the Stanislaus National Forest, the home
is made available by the Bookstore free of
charge to families of many of its senior
employees.
For Speed, the Bookstore's general
manager, and Chiaramonte, its assistant
manager, the home provides a dual bene
fit. Since 1986, the house has been at
their disposal as a vacation facility at the
Bookstore's expense. And, because their
consulting firm owns the property, Speed

and Chiaramonte will be the beneficiaries
when it is eventually sold, profiting on
the investment by perhaps tens of thou
sands of dollars.
In the meantime, the Bookstore,
through its lease payments to the con
sulting firm, has effectively been paying
off $209,000 in loans Speed and Chiara
monte obtained in the mid-'Bos to finance
the construction of the home. Their con
sulting firm, called Colleagues Manage
ment Services, hasn't had a client in
years, according to Speed.
The lease arrangement was discovered
by The Daily as part of an investigation of
the compensation practices of the Book
store, a tax-exempt, nonprofit corporation
run independently of the University and
overseen by a board of directors composed
of Stanford faculty, staff and, in some
years, one or two Stanford students.
History Prof. Peter Stansky, the cur
rent president of the Bookstore's board,
contends the lease arrangement on the
Twain Harte house is a way to supple
ment the pension plans of Speed and
Chiaramonte, while at the same time pro
viding the Bookstore staff with "a quite
splendid" perquisite.

The Stanford Bookstore has been leasing the above vacation home from a consulting firm owned and operated by the
Bookstore's top two managers. The home, provided free of charge to senior Bookstore employees, has four bedrooms,
three-and-a-half bathrooms and "a large playroom for the kids," according to the man who built it.
Bookstore so that they can best serve the
community," he says.
Speed, too, contends the relationship
is perfectly legitimate. "If it's devious, it
wasn't intended to be," he says.
Cadillacs and a small sailboat
During the past six months, The Daily
has examined the Bookstore's last seven
federal tax returns and scores of filings
the store made with various state and
county government offices, and has inter
viewed numerous past and present Book
store employees, managers of other col
lege bookstores and several tax experts.
The Daily has found that the Stanford
Bookstore has been spending thousands of
dollars a year to provide its senior employ
ees with a host of perquisites that are
unheard of elsewhere in the college book
store industry (see related story, page 7).
In addition to use of the vacation
home, many senior employees are cur
rently provided with automobiles — the
Bookstore has purchased three Cadillacs
in the last three years — use of a $50,000
motor home, use of a Bookstore-owned
sailboat, and use of more than $13,000
worth of exercise equipment purchased
with Bookstore funds.
In interviews with other bookstore
managers and industry representatives,
the mere suggestion of a college bookstore
providing vehicles and vacation facilities
to their employees was often ridiculed.
"You're really stretching it there,"
says Steve Johnson, who conducted a
recent survey of managers' salaries for
the National Association of College
Stores. "Things like that are exceptional.
Those are extraneous perks. I haven't
heard of anything like that."
At the Harvard Coop, for example,
where annual sales are roughly 60 per
cent higher than at Stanford, no employ
ees are provided with vehicles or vacation
facilities. "We have nothing like that,"
says Jerry Murphy, the store's top man
ager. "That's kind of unusual. The only
perks you really get are, quite frankly, a
discount at the store."
Comparisons to other bookstores are
meaningful because nonprofit corpora
tions, such as the Stanford Bookstore, are
restricted by state and federal laws to pro
viding their employees with no more than
"reasonable compensation." While tax
experts say there is no set formula for
determining how much and what types of
compensation are "reasonable," the first
place they look is at others in the industry.
"You have to look at what the industry
standard is," says Larry Wright, a
spokesman for the Internal Revenue Ser
vice. While Wright and representatives
from the state's Franchise Tax Board
were hesitant to comment specifically on
the Bookstore, they acknowledged that
some of the perquisites offered appeared
unusual.
"Certainly, some of this could be ques
tionable," says Jim Shepherd, a
spokesman for the Franchise Tax Board.
Seven managers with cars
In addition to a salary well over
$100,000, Speed, the Bookstore's general
manager, is provided with use of a 1991
model year Infiniti Q45, a car on which
lease payments typically run about $650
a month, according to James Woodhouse
of Infiniti Finance in Torrance, Calif., the
company from which the Bookstore is
leasing the vehicle.
Chiaramonte, the store's assistant man
ager, also makes well over $ 100,000 a year,
and currently drives a 1990 Cadillac Eldo
rado Biarritz, purchased by the Bookstore
in November 1989 for $34,552, according
to a depreciation schedule attached to the
store's fiscal year 1989-90 tax return.
Besides Speed and Chiaramonte, at
least five other senior employees of the
Bookstore are currently provided with
Bookstore-owned or -leased automobiles,
The Daily has learned:
• Roger Reynolds, the book division

manager, is provided with a red 1989
Acura Legend;
• Laura Dowling, the clothing and sou
venir manager, is provided with a white
1989 Mazda RX-7 convertible;
• Scott Frisby, the shipping and receiv
ing manager, is provided with a black
1989 Volvo 740;
• Greg Gunn, who manages the Book
store's computer system, is provided with
a green and tan 1987 Ford Bronco XLT
Explorer; and
• Randy Winn, the Stanford Bookstore
Palo Alto manager, drives a light blue
1989 Mercury Sable wagon leased by the
Bookstore's for-profit subsidiary.
(The subsidiary runs the Palo Alto
store, a clothing shop in the Stanford
Shopping Center, and a half-dozen com
munity college bookstores in the Bay
Area and southern California.)
Speed, in addition to his Infiniti Q45,
also apparently has use of a blue and gray
1990 Chevrolet Suburban van, purchased
by the Bookstore for $27,801 in Decem
ber 1989. The Suburban was seen sitting
in front of Speed's home in Fremont last
June with a power boat attached. (The
boat itself is owned personally by Speed
and another Fremont resident.)
More than $13,000 in Bookstore funds
have also been used to purchase exercise
equipment, including two Lifecycles, a

Trotter treadmill and a Stairmaster. The
equipment, according to Speed, is located
in the Bookstore's warehouse in Newark,
Calif. — across the Bay — and is available
for the use of the entire Bookstore staff,
he says.
But, by far, the most unusual compen
sation arrangement in the eyes of tax

experts contacted by lhe
Daily stems from the
relationship between
Speed and Chiaramonte's
consulting firm and the
Bookstore.
In addition to the
arrangement on the
Twain Harte house, the
Bookstore is leasing a
1989 Holiday Rambler

Imperial motor home from Colleagues
Management Services. The motor home,
too, is available for use of Bookstore
employees, Speed says, but "it doesn't get
as much use as the house does."
Colleagues Management Services like
ly paid more than $50,000 to buy the
vehicle, according to a salesman at Dan
Gamels' Travel Trails in Scotts Valley,
where the motor home was purchased.
It's not clear how much the Bookstore is
paying Speed and Chiaramonte's consult
ing firm for its use.
The two lease arrangements with the

Bookstore are apparently the only
sources of income Colleagues Manage
ment Services has had for the last sever
al years. In an interview, Speed indicated
that the firm actually did engage in con
sulting work several years ago, but said
he couldn't remember the last time they
had had a client.
Lease arrangements not disclosed
The Bookstore has failed to disclose
either lease arrangement in its annual
returns to the Internal Revenue Service,
even though there is a question that asks
specifically if the store has leased proper
ty or services from another corporation
that has officers affiliated with the Book
store.
Speed is the chief executive officer of
Colleagues Management Services,
according to a filing made with Califor
nia's Secretary of State in 1984. Chiara
monte is the secretary and chief financial
officer, and the fathers of both Speed and
Chiaramonte are listed as the consulting
firm's directors.
While such lease arrangements are not
necessarily improper, the IRS asks the
question as "a tool" to help determine
whether a nonprofit organization is
involved in self-dealing and channeling
money to its insiders, according to IRS
spokesperson Pam Mac Lean.
The IRS wouldn't comment on the
Bookstore's arrangement in particular.
But Mac Lean noted that organizations
that do have such lease arrangements are
supposed to provide detailed statements
to the IRS explaining them and demon
strating their necessity.
Chiaramonte, who signed the Book
store's tax return last year, blamed the
failure to disclose the leases on Mark
Scheffield of Abbott, Stringham & Lynch,
who prepares the Bookstore's tax
returns. Scheffield declined to comment
on the matter.
A 'quite splendid' perk
The lease arrangement on the Twain
Harte house, says Stansky, the president
of the Bookstore's board, is intended as
"a sort of retirement benefit" for Speed
and Chiaramonte, who, he says, "are
among the best college book people in the
country." Back in the mid-'Bos, when the
arrangement was approved, "we thought
we'd be in danger of losing them. That
would have been disastrous."
In addition, he says, the house is a
"quite splendid" perquisite for current
staff members. "I see it as a wonderful
thing."
The house has two master bedrooms,
two master bathrooms, two additional
bedrooms and one-and-a-half additional
bathrooms, plus a "large playroom for the
kids," according to Dave Turner of Dave
Turner Construction, who designed and
built the house. The home, Turner says,
"was custom-built for the Stanford Book
store" and was designed so that two differ
ent families could use it simultaneously
and maintain some degree of privacy.
Twain Harte, where the house is located.

is a small vacation-rental community with
a permanent population of about 3,750,
according to Larry Abreo of the Twain
Harte Chamber of Commerce. The area
offers skiing in the winter, and golf, fishing
and boating in the summer, Abreo says.
In April 1987, the Bookstore pur
chased a Laser II sailboat for use of
employees vacationing at the Twain
Harte home. The boat was purchased at
Seabird Sailing in Berkeley for $3,745,
according to documents obtained by The
Daily.
Monthly payments covered
In an interview last week, Speed con
firmed that the Bookstore has a long
term lease on the Twain Harte house, but
refused to discuss its terms in much
detail, saying questions on the matter
were an "invasion of privacy."
He did, however, acknowledge that the
lease arrangement is sufficient to cover
the monthly payments on loans his and
Chiaramonte's consulting firm obtained
to finance the house's construction, and
that the Bookstore pays all other expens-

es associated with the
house.
According to docu
ments filed in Tuolumne
County, where the Twain
Harte house is located,
Colleagues Management
Services obtained two
loans, one in 1985, the
other in 1986. The com
bined principal on the

loans was $209,000. It is impossible to
determine the precise monthly payments
on the loans, however, because the docu
ments do not indicate the interest rate or
period of repayment.
Speed and Chiaramonte would not dis
close this information.
Other expenses the Bookstore is likely
paying include property tax on the lot,
which was $3,249.68 last year, as well as
utilities, insurance and cleaning costs.
According to Alice Stapp, a local realtor,
the same woman who does cleaning for
her is paid to clean the house leased by
the Bookstore.
In any event, local realtors in Twain
Harte say it is highly unusual for the
Bookstore to be leasing such a large home
on a long-term basis. It would have made
much more sense from the Bookstore's
perspective, the realtors say, to have pur
chased the home or to have built a new
home so that the store could profit from
the investment.
"You couldn't find someone to rent a
house like that for more than a weekend
at a time," says Wayne Stapp of Realty
World Evergreen Properties. "People
here don't rent for more than a couple
months before buying something."
'A long-term benefit for us'
In the Bookstore's case, when the
property is sold, Speed and Chiara
monte's consulting firm will receive the

Stansky
profit from the sale. The vacation home,
Speed says, is intended as "a short-term

benefit for the staff, and
hopefully a long-term
benefit for us."
Local realtors say
that, even given the
depressed real estate
market, the current
value of the house is
around $400,000. One
realtor, Chucker Twin
ing of Lupo Properties

in Twain Harte, suggested the house
would likely sell for more than $500,000.
Colleagues Management Services was
incorporated in April 1984. A month
later, the firm issued stock in exchange
for $1,000, according to a filing with the
state's Department of Corporations.
Speed and Chiaramonte confirmed last
week that they are the firm's only stock
holders.
Fifteen months after the stock
issuance, Colleagues Management pur
chased an empty three-acre lot in Twain
Harte for about $65,000, according to

documents obtained by The Daily.
"Back in 1984 we had a client," Speed
says. He wouldn't say who the client was,
or even what kind of consulting was
involved, but did say that the arrange
ment with the client "must have been big
enough" to cover the land purchase.
The client Speed was referring to was
likely the University of California-San
Francisco Medical School, according to
Jack Friedenthal, a former Stanford
Law School professor who served as
president of the Bookstore board for 14
years.
Speed and Chiaramonte devoted a fair
amount of time in the early 1980s to
helping turn around that medical
school's bookstore, and were paid rather
handsomely, Friedenthal says.
Colleagues' beginnings
Because Speed and Chiaramonte felt
they had obtained the consulting job due
to their Stanford Bookstore credentials,
they felt "morally required" to somehow
turn the money over to the Bookstore,
Friedenthal says. They ended up doing so,
he says, by purchasing a recreational vehi
cle that Bookstore employees could use (a

different vehicle than is currently owned
by Colleagues Management Services).
It was later decided, Friedenthal says,
to sell the recreational vehicle and buy
land in Twain Harte.
Speed and Chiaramonte contacted
Dave Turner Construction almost imme
diately after purchasing the property in
August 1985, according to Turner. Con
struction on the home was completed by
July 1986.
In September 1986, the Bookstore
began purchasing furnishings for the
house, including a Dynasty Hide-a-Bed, a
wood-burning stove, chairs, barstools,
television sets, a china cabinet, several
beds and $1,600 worth of utensils. In
June 1987, a Royale Spa hot tub was pur
chased and placed in a $2,594 frame deck
the Bookstore had purchased a few
months before.
By January 1989, the Bookstore had
spent more than $69,000 to furnish the
house.

'A long-term benefit for us'

profit from the sale. The vacation home,
Speed says, is intended as "a short-term

benefit for the staff, and
hopefully a long-term
benefit for us."
Local realtors say
that, even given the
depressed real estate
market, the current
value of the house is
around $400,000. One
realtor, Chucker Twin
ing of Lupo Properties

in Twain Harte, suggested the house
would likely sell for more than $500,000.
Colleagues Management Services was
incorporated in April 1984. A month
later, the firm issued stock in exchange
for $1,000, according to a filing with the
state's Department of Corporations.
Speed and Chiaramonte confirmed last
week that they are the firm's only stock
holders.
Fifteen months after the stock
issuance, Colleagues Management pur
chased an empty three-acre lot in Twain
Harte for about $65,000, according to

documents obtained by The Daily.
"Back in 1984 we had a client," Speed
says. He wouldn't say who the client was,
or even what kind of consulting was
involved, but did say that the arrange
ment with the client "must have been big
enough" to cover the land purchase.
The client Speed was referring to was
likely the University of California-San
Francisco Medical School, according to
Jack Friedenthal, a former Stanford
Law School professor who served as
president of the Bookstore board for 14
years.
Speed and Chiaramonte devoted a fair
amount of time in the early 1980s to
helping turn around that medical
school's bookstore, and were paid rather
handsomely, Friedenthal says.
Colleagues' beginnings
Because Speed and Chiaramonte felt
they had obtained the consulting job due
to their Stanford Bookstore credentials,
they felt "morally required" to somehow
turn the money over to the Bookstore,
Friedenthal says. They ended up doing so,
he says, by purchasing a recreational vehi
cle that Bookstore employees could use (a

different vehicle than is currently owned
by Colleagues Management Services).
It was later decided, Friedenthal says,
to sell the recreational vehicle and buy
land in Twain Harte.
Speed and Chiaramonte contacted
Dave Turner Construction almost imme
diately after purchasing the property in
August 1985, according to Turner. Con
struction on the home was completed by
July 1986.
In September 1986, the Bookstore
began purchasing furnishings for the
house, including a Dynasty Hide-a-Bed, a
wood-burning stove, chairs, barstools,
television sets, a china cabinet, several
beds and $1,600 worth of utensils. In
June 1987, a Royale Spa hot tub was pur
chased and placed in a $2,594 frame deck
the Bookstore had purchased a few
months before.
By January 1989, the Bookstore had
spent more than $69,000 to furnish the
house.

The Stanford Bookstore has been leasing the above Holiday Rambler Imperial motor home from Colleagues Management
Services, a consulting firm owned by the Bookstore's top two managers.
For the last several years, the Stanford
Bookstore has been leasing a vacation
home in central California from a consult
ing firm privately owned and operated by
the Bookstore's top two managers, Eldon
Speed and Philip Chiaramonte.
In addition to thousands of dollars in
lease payments made to Speed and
Chiaramonte's consulting firm, the
Bookstore has spent more than $69,000
to furnish the two-story, 3,100 square
foot home, according to documents
obtained by The Daily. Among the pur
chases made with Bookstore funds were a
$4,341 hot tub, a $5,888 satellite dish
and a $3,681 comforter and bedroom set.
Located in Twain Harte, Calif., about
125 miles east of Stanford on the edge of
the Stanislaus National Forest, the home
is made available by the Bookstore free of
charge to families of many of its senior
employees.
For Speed, the Bookstore's general
manager, and Chiaramonte, its assistant
manager, the home provides a dual bene
fit. Since 1986, the house has been at
their disposal as a vacation facility at the
Bookstore's expense. And, because their
consulting firm owns the property, Speed

and Chiaramonte will be the beneficiaries
when it is eventually sold, profiting on
the investment by perhaps tens of thou
sands of dollars.
In the meantime, the Bookstore,
through its lease payments to the con
sulting firm, has effectively been paying
off $209,000 in loans Speed and Chiara
monte obtained in the mid-'Bos to finance
the construction of the home. Their con
sulting firm, called Colleagues Manage
ment Services, hasn't had a client in
years, according to Speed.
The lease arrangement was discovered
by The Daily as part of an investigation of
the compensation practices of the Book
store, a tax-exempt, nonprofit corporation
run independently of the University and
overseen by a board of directors composed
of Stanford faculty, staff and, in some
years, one or two Stanford students.
History Prof. Peter Stansky, the cur
rent president of the Bookstore's board,
contends the lease arrangement on the
Twain Harte house is a way to supple
ment the pension plans of Speed and
Chiaramonte, while at the same time pro
viding the Bookstore staff with "a quite
splendid" perquisite.
"Our aim is to reward people in the

The Stanford Bookstore has been leasing the above vacation home from a consulting firm owned and operated by the
Bookstore's top two managers. The home, provided free of charge to senior Bookstore employees, has four bedrooms,
three-and-a-half bathrooms and "a large playroom for the kids," according to the man who built it.
Bookstore so that they can best serve the
community," he says.
Speed, too, contends the relationship
is perfectly legitimate. "If it's devious, it
wasn't intended to be," he says.
Cadillacs and a small sailboat
During the past six months, The Daily
has examined the Bookstore's last seven
federal tax returns and scores of filings
the store made with various state and
county government offices, and has inter
viewed numerous past and present Book
store employees, managers of other col
lege bookstores and several tax experts.
The Daily has found that the Stanford
Bookstore has been spending thousands of
dollars a year to provide its senior employ
ees with a host of perquisites that are
unheard of elsewhere in the college book
store industry (see related story, page 7).
In addition to use of the vacation
home, many senior employees are cur
rently provided with automobiles — the
Bookstore has purchased three Cadillacs
in the last three years — use of a $50,000
motor home, use of a Bookstore-owned
sailboat, and use of more than $13,000
worth of exercise equipment purchased
with Bookstore funds.
In interviews with other bookstore
managers and industry representatives,
the mere suggestion of a college bookstore
providing vehicles and vacation facilities
to their employees was often ridiculed.
"You're really stretching it there,"
says Steve Johnson, who conducted a
recent survey of managers' salaries for
the National Association of College
Stores. "Things like that are exceptional.
Those are extraneous perks. I haven't
heard of anything like that."
At the Harvard Coop, for example,
where annual sales are roughly 60 per
cent higher than at Stanford, no employ
ees are provided with vehicles or vacation
facilities. "We have nothing like that,"
says Jerry Murphy, the store's top man
ager. "That's kind of unusual. The only
perks you really get are, quite frankly, a
discount at the store."
Comparisons to other bookstores are
meaningful because nonprofit corpora
tions, such as the Stanford Bookstore, are
restricted by state and federal laws to pro
viding their employees with no more than
"reasonable compensation." While tax
experts say there is no set formula for
determining how much and what types of
compensation are "reasonable," the first
place they look is at others in the industry.
"You have to look at what the industry
standard is," says Larry Wright, a
spokesman for the Internal Revenue Ser
vice. While Wright and representatives
from the state's Franchise Tax Board
were hesitant to comment specifically on
the Bookstore, they acknowledged that
some of the perquisites offered appeared
unusual.
"Certainly, some of this could be ques
tionable," says Jim Shepherd, a
spokesman for the Franchise Tax Board.
Seven managers with cars
In addition to a salary well over
$100,000, Speed, the Bookstore's general
manager, is provided with use of a 1991
model year Infiniti Q45, a car on which
lease payments typically run about $650
a month, according to James Woodhouse
of Infiniti Finance in Torrance, Calif., the
company from which the Bookstore is
leasing the vehicle.
Chiaramonte, the store's assistant man
ager, also makes well over $ 100,000 a year,
and currently drives a 1990 Cadillac Eldo
rado Biarritz, purchased by the Bookstore
in November 1989 for $34,552, according
to a depreciation schedule attached to the
store's fiscal year 1989-90 tax return.
Besides Speed and Chiaramonte, at
least five other senior employees of the
Bookstore are currently provided with
Bookstore-owned or -leased automobiles,
The Daily has learned:
• Roger Reynolds, the book division

manager, is provided with a red 1989
Acura Legend;
• Laura Dowling, the clothing and sou
venir manager, is provided with a white
1989 Mazda RX-7 convertible;
• Scott Frisby, the shipping and receiv
ing manager, is provided with a black
1989 Volvo 740;
• Greg Gunn, who manages the Book
store's computer system, is provided with
a green and tan 1987 Ford Bronco XLT
Explorer; and
• Randy Winn, the Stanford Bookstore
Palo Alto manager, drives a light blue
1989 Mercury Sable wagon leased by the
Bookstore's for-profit subsidiary.
(The subsidiary runs the Palo Alto
store, a clothing shop in the Stanford
Shopping Center, and a half-dozen com
munity college bookstores in the Bay
Area and southern California.)
Speed, in addition to his Infiniti Q45,
also apparently has use of a blue and gray
1990 Chevrolet Suburban van, purchased
by the Bookstore for $27,801 in Decem
ber 1989. The Suburban was seen sitting
in front of Speed's home in Fremont last
June with a power boat attached. (The
boat itself is owned personally by Speed
and another Fremont resident.)
More than $13,000 in Bookstore funds
have also been used to purchase exercise
equipment, including two Lifecycles, a

Trotter treadmill and a Stairmaster. The
equipment, according to Speed, is located
in the Bookstore's warehouse in Newark,
Calif. — across the Bay — and is available
for the use of the entire Bookstore staff,
he says.
But, by far, the most unusual compen
sation arrangement in the eyes of tax

experts contacted by lhe
Daily stems from the
relationship between
Speed and Chiaramonte's
consulting firm and the
Bookstore.
In addition to the
arrangement on the
Twain Harte house, the
Bookstore is leasing a
1989 Holiday Rambler

Imperial motor home from Colleagues
Management Services. The motor home,
too, is available for use of Bookstore
employees, Speed says, but "it doesn't get
as much use as the house does."
Colleagues Management Services like
ly paid more than $50,000 to buy the
vehicle, according to a salesman at Dan
Gamels' Travel Trails in Scotts Valley,
where the motor home was purchased.
It's not clear how much the Bookstore is
paying Speed and Chiaramonte's consult
ing firm for its use.
The two lease arrangements with the

Bookstore are apparently the only
sources of income Colleagues Manage
ment Services has had for the last sever
al years. In an interview, Speed indicated
that the firm actually did engage in con
sulting work several years ago, but said
he couldn't remember the last time they
had had a client.
Lease arrangements not disclosed
The Bookstore has failed to disclose
either lease arrangement in its annual
returns to the Internal Revenue Service,
even though there is a question that asks
specifically if the store has leased proper
ty or services from another corporation
that has officers affiliated with the Book
store.
Speed is the chief executive officer of
Colleagues Management Services,
according to a filing made with Califor
nia's Secretary of State in 1984. Chiara
monte is the secretary and chief financial
officer, and the fathers of both Speed and
Chiaramonte are listed as the consulting
firm's directors.
While such lease arrangements are not
necessarily improper, the IRS asks the
question as "a tool" to help determine
whether a nonprofit organization is
involved in self-dealing and channeling
money to its insiders, according to IRS
spokesperson Pam Mac Lean.
The IRS wouldn't comment on the
Bookstore's arrangement in particular.
But Mac Lean noted that organizations
that do have such lease arrangements are
supposed to provide detailed statements
to the IRS explaining them and demon
strating their necessity.
Chiaramonte, who signed the Book
store's tax return last year, blamed the
failure to disclose the leases on Mark
Scheffield of Abbott, Stringham & Lynch,
who prepares the Bookstore's tax
returns. Scheffield declined to comment
on the matter.
A 'quite splendid' perk
The lease arrangement on the Twain
Harte house, says Stansky, the president
of the Bookstore's board, is intended as
"a sort of retirement benefit" for Speed
and Chiaramonte, who, he says, "are
among the best college book people in the
country." Back in the mid-'Bos, when the
arrangement was approved, "we thought
we'd be in danger of losing them. That
would have been disastrous."
In addition, he says, the house is a
"quite splendid" perquisite for current
staff members. "I see it as a wonderful
thing."
The house has two master bedrooms,
two master bathrooms, two additional
bedrooms and one-and-a-half additional
bathrooms, plus a "large playroom for the
kids," according to Dave Turner of Dave
Turner Construction, who designed and
built the house. The home, Turner says,
"was custom-built for the Stanford Book
store" and was designed so that two differ
ent families could use it simultaneously
and maintain some degree of privacy.
Twain Harte, where the house is located.

is a small vacation-rental community with
a permanent population of about 3,750,
according to Larry Abreo of the Twain
Harte Chamber of Commerce. The area
offers skiing in the winter, and golf, fishing
and boating in the summer, Abreo says.
In April 1987, the Bookstore pur
chased a Laser II sailboat for use of
employees vacationing at the Twain
Harte home. The boat was purchased at
Seabird Sailing in Berkeley for $3,745,
according to documents obtained by The
Daily.
Monthly payments covered
In an interview last week, Speed con
firmed that the Bookstore has a long
term lease on the Twain Harte house, but
refused to discuss its terms in much
detail, saying questions on the matter
were an "invasion of privacy."
He did, however, acknowledge that the
lease arrangement is sufficient to cover
the monthly payments on loans his and
Chiaramonte's consulting firm obtained
to finance the house's construction, and
that the Bookstore pays all other expens-

es associated with the
house.
According to docu
ments filed in Tuolumne
County, where the Twain
Harte house is located,
Colleagues Management
Services obtained two
loans, one in 1985, the
other in 1986. The com
bined principal on the

loans was $209,000. It is impossible to
determine the precise monthly payments
on the loans, however, because the docu
ments do not indicate the interest rate or
period of repayment.
Speed and Chiaramonte would not dis
close this information.
Other expenses the Bookstore is likely
paying include property tax on the lot,
which was $3,249.68 last year, as well as
utilities, insurance and cleaning costs.
According to Alice Stapp, a local realtor,
the same woman who does cleaning for
her is paid to clean the house leased by
the Bookstore.
In any event, local realtors in Twain
Harte say it is highly unusual for the
Bookstore to be leasing such a large home
on a long-term basis. It would have made
much more sense from the Bookstore's
perspective, the realtors say, to have pur
chased the home or to have built a new
home so that the store could profit from
the investment.
"You couldn't find someone to rent a
house like that for more than a weekend
at a time," says Wayne Stapp of Realty
World Evergreen Properties. "People
here don't rent for more than a couple
months before buying something."
'A long-term benefit for us'

property is sold, Speed and Chiara
monte's consulting firm will receive the

profit from the sale. The vacation home,
Speed says, is intended as "a short-term

hopefully a long-term

depressed real estate
market, the current
value of the house is
around $400,000. One

Scheffield of Abbott, Stringham & Lynch,
who prepares the Bookstore's tax
returns. Scheffield declined to comment
on the matter.
A 'quite splendid' perk
The lease arrangement on the Twain
Harte house, says Stansky, the president
of the Bookstore's board, is intended as
"a sort of retirement benefit" for Speed
and Chiaramonte, who, he says, "are
among the best college book people in the
country." Back in the mid-'Bos, when the
arrangement was approved, "we thought
we'd be in danger of losing them. That
would have been disastrous."
In addition, he says, the house is a
"quite splendid" perquisite for current
staff members. "I see it as a wonderful
thing."
The house has two master bedrooms,
two master bathrooms, two additional
bedrooms and one-and-a-half additional
bathrooms, plus a "large playroom for the
kids," according to Dave Turner of Dave
Turner Construction, who designed and
built the house. The home, Turner says,
"was custom-built for the Stanford Book
store" and was designed so that two differ
ent families could use it simultaneously
and maintain some degree of privacy.
Twain Harte, where the house is located.

is a small vacation-rental community with
a permanent population of about 3,750,
according to Larry Abreo of the Twain
Harte Chamber of Commerce. The area
offers skiing in the winter, and golf, fishing
and boating in the summer, Abreo says.
In April 1987, the Bookstore pur
chased a Laser II sailboat for use of
employees vacationing at the Twain
Harte home. The boat was purchased at
Seabird Sailing in Berkeley for $3,745,
according to documents obtained by The
Daily.
Monthly payments covered
In an interview last week, Speed con
firmed that the Bookstore has a long
term lease on the Twain Harte house, but
refused to discuss its terms in much
detail, saying questions on the matter
were an "invasion of privacy."
He did, however, acknowledge that the
lease arrangement is sufficient to cover
the monthly payments on loans his and
Chiaramonte's consulting firm obtained
to finance the house's construction, and
that the Bookstore pays all other expens-

es associated with the
house.
According to docu
ments filed in Tuolumne
County, where the Twain
Harte house is located,
Colleagues Management
Services obtained two
loans, one in 1985, the
other in 1986. The com
bined principal on the

loans was $209,000. It is impossible to
determine the precise monthly payments
on the loans, however, because the docu
ments do not indicate the interest rate or
period of repayment.
Speed and Chiaramonte would not dis
close this information.
Other expenses the Bookstore is likely
paying include property tax on the lot,
which was $3,249.68 last year, as well as
utilities, insurance and cleaning costs.
According to Alice Stapp, a local realtor,
the same woman who does cleaning for
her is paid to clean the house leased by
the Bookstore.
In any event, local realtors in Twain
Harte say it is highly unusual for the
Bookstore to be leasing such a large home
on a long-term basis. It would have made
much more sense from the Bookstore's
perspective, the realtors say, to have pur
chased the home or to have built a new
home so that the store could profit from
the investment.
"You couldn't find someone to rent a
house like that for more than a weekend
at a time," says Wayne Stapp of Realty
World Evergreen Properties. "People
here don't rent for more than a couple
months before buying something."
'A long-term benefit for us'
In the Bookstore's case, when the
property is sold, Speed and Chiara
monte's consulting firm will receive the

Stansky
profit from the sale. The vacation home,
Speed says, is intended as "a short-term

benefit for the staff, and
hopefully a long-term
benefit for us."
Local realtors say
that, even given the
depressed real estate
market, the current
value of the house is
around $400,000. One
realtor, Chucker Twin
ing of Lupo Properties

in Twain Harte, suggested the house
would likely sell for more than $500,000.
Colleagues Management Services was
incorporated in April 1984. A month
later, the firm issued stock in exchange
for $1,000, according to a filing with the
state's Department of Corporations.
Speed and Chiaramonte confirmed last
week that they are the firm's only stock
holders.
Fifteen months after the stock
issuance, Colleagues Management pur
chased an empty three-acre lot in Twain
Harte for about $65,000, according to

documents obtained by The Daily.
"Back in 1984 we had a client," Speed
says. He wouldn't say who the client was,
or even what kind of consulting was
involved, but did say that the arrange
ment with the client "must have been big
enough" to cover the land purchase.
The client Speed was referring to was
likely the University of California-San
Francisco Medical School, according to
Jack Friedenthal, a former Stanford
Law School professor who served as
president of the Bookstore board for 14
years.
Speed and Chiaramonte devoted a fair
amount of time in the early 1980s to
helping turn around that medical
school's bookstore, and were paid rather
handsomely, Friedenthal says.
Colleagues' beginnings
Because Speed and Chiaramonte felt
they had obtained the consulting job due
to their Stanford Bookstore credentials,
they felt "morally required" to somehow
turn the money over to the Bookstore,
Friedenthal says. They ended up doing so,
he says, by purchasing a recreational vehi
cle that Bookstore employees could use (a

different vehicle than is currently owned
by Colleagues Management Services).
It was later decided, Friedenthal says,
to sell the recreational vehicle and buy
land in Twain Harte.
Speed and Chiaramonte contacted
Dave Turner Construction almost imme
diately after purchasing the property in
August 1985, according to Turner. Con
struction on the home was completed by
July 1986.
In September 1986, the Bookstore
began purchasing furnishings for the
house, including a Dynasty Hide-a-Bed, a
wood-burning stove, chairs, barstools,
television sets, a china cabinet, several
beds and $1,600 worth of utensils. In
June 1987, a Royale Spa hot tub was pur
chased and placed in a $2,594 frame deck
the Bookstore had purchased a few
months before.
By January 1989, the Bookstore had
spent more than $69,000 to furnish the
house.

The Stanford Bookstore has been leasing the above Holiday Rambler Imperial motor home from Colleagues Management
Services, a consulting firm owned by the Bookstore's top two managers.
For the last several years, the Stanford
Bookstore has been leasing a vacation
home in central California from a consult
ing firm privately owned and operated by
the Bookstore's top two managers, Eldon
Speed and Philip Chiaramonte.
In addition to thousands of dollars in
lease payments made to Speed and
Chiaramonte's consulting firm, the
Bookstore has spent more than $69,000
to furnish the two-story, 3,100 square
foot home, according to documents
obtained by The Daily. Among the pur
chases made with Bookstore funds were a
$4,341 hot tub, a $5,888 satellite dish
and a $3,681 comforter and bedroom set.
Located in Twain Harte, Calif., about
125 miles east of Stanford on the edge of
the Stanislaus National Forest, the home
is made available by the Bookstore free of
charge to families of many of its senior
employees.
For Speed, the Bookstore's general
manager, and Chiaramonte, its assistant
manager, the home provides a dual bene
fit. Since 1986, the house has been at
their disposal as a vacation facility at the
Bookstore's expense. And, because their
consulting firm owns the property, Speed

and Chiaramonte will be the beneficiaries
when it is eventually sold, profiting on
the investment by perhaps tens of thou
sands of dollars.
In the meantime, the Bookstore,
through its lease payments to the con
sulting firm, has effectively been paying
off $209,000 in loans Speed and Chiara
monte obtained in the mid-'Bos to finance
the construction of the home. Their con
sulting firm, called Colleagues Manage
ment Services, hasn't had a client in
years, according to Speed.
The lease arrangement was discovered
by The Daily as part of an investigation of
the compensation practices of the Book
store, a tax-exempt, nonprofit corporation
run independently of the University and
overseen by a board of directors composed
of Stanford faculty, staff and, in some
years, one or two Stanford students.
History Prof. Peter Stansky, the cur
rent president of the Bookstore's board,
contends the lease arrangement on the
Twain Harte house is a way to supple
ment the pension plans of Speed and
Chiaramonte, while at the same time pro
viding the Bookstore staff with "a quite
splendid" perquisite.
"Our aim is to reward people in the

Bookstore so that they can best serve the
community," he says.
Speed, too, contends the relationship
is perfectly legitimate. "If it's devious, it
wasn't intended to be," he says.
Cadillacs and a small sailboat
During the past six months, The Daily
has examined the Bookstore's last seven
federal tax returns and scores of filings
the store made with various state and
county government offices, and has inter
viewed numerous past and present Book
store employees, managers of other col
lege bookstores and several tax experts.
The Daily has found that the Stanford
Bookstore has been spending thousands of
dollars a year to provide its senior employ
ees with a host of perquisites that are
unheard of elsewhere in the college book
store industry (see related story, page 7).
In addition to use of the vacation
home, many senior employees are cur
rently provided with automobiles — the
Bookstore has purchased three Cadillacs
in the last three years — use of a $50,000
motor home, use of a Bookstore-owned
sailboat, and use of more than $13,000
worth of exercise equipment purchased
with Bookstore funds.
In interviews with other bookstore
managers and industry representatives,
the mere suggestion of a college bookstore
providing vehicles and vacation facilities
to their employees was often ridiculed.
"You're really stretching it there,"
says Steve Johnson, who conducted a
recent survey of managers' salaries for
the National Association of College
Stores. "Things like that are exceptional.
Those are extraneous perks. I haven't
heard of anything like that."
At the Harvard Coop, for example,
where annual sales are roughly 60 per
cent higher than at Stanford, no employ
ees are provided with vehicles or vacation
facilities. "We have nothing like that,"
says Jerry Murphy, the store's top man
ager. "That's kind of unusual. The only
perks you really get are, quite frankly, a
discount at the store."
Comparisons to other bookstores are
meaningful because nonprofit corpora
tions, such as the Stanford Bookstore, are
restricted by state and federal laws to pro
viding their employees with no more than
"reasonable compensation." While tax
experts say there is no set formula for
determining how much and what types of
compensation are "reasonable," the first
place they look is at others in the industry.
"You have to look at what the industry
standard is," says Larry Wright, a
spokesman for the Internal Revenue Ser
vice. While Wright and representatives
from the state's Franchise Tax Board
were hesitant to comment specifically on
the Bookstore, they acknowledged that
some of the perquisites offered appeared
unusual.
"Certainly, some of this could be ques
tionable," says Jim Shepherd, a
spokesman for the Franchise Tax Board.
Seven managers with cars
In addition to a salary well over
$100,000, Speed, the Bookstore's general
manager, is provided with use of a 1991
model year Infiniti Q45, a car on which
lease payments typically run about $650
a month, according to James Woodhouse
of Infiniti Finance in Torrance, Calif., the
company from which the Bookstore is
leasing the vehicle.
Chiaramonte, the store's assistant man
ager, also makes well over $ 100,000 a year,
and currently drives a 1990 Cadillac Eldo
rado Biarritz, purchased by the Bookstore
in November 1989 for $34,552, according
to a depreciation schedule attached to the
store's fiscal year 1989-90 tax return.
Besides Speed and Chiaramonte, at
least five other senior employees of the
Bookstore are currently provided with
Bookstore-owned or -leased automobiles,
The Daily has learned:
• Roger Reynolds, the book division

manager, is provided with a red 1989
Acura Legend;
• Laura Dowling, the clothing and sou
venir manager, is provided with a white
1989 Mazda RX-7 convertible;
• Scott Frisby, the shipping and receiv
ing manager, is provided with a black
1989 Volvo 740;
• Greg Gunn, who manages the Book
store's computer system, is provided with
a green and tan 1987 Ford Bronco XLT
Explorer; and
• Randy Winn, the Stanford Bookstore
Palo Alto manager, drives a light blue
1989 Mercury Sable wagon leased by the
Bookstore's for-profit subsidiary.
(The subsidiary runs the Palo Alto
store, a clothing shop in the Stanford
Shopping Center, and a half-dozen com
munity college bookstores in the Bay
Area and southern California.)
Speed, in addition to his Infiniti Q45,
also apparently has use of a blue and gray
1990 Chevrolet Suburban van, purchased
by the Bookstore for $27,801 in Decem
ber 1989. The Suburban was seen sitting
in front of Speed's home in Fremont last
June with a power boat attached. (The
boat itself is owned personally by Speed
and another Fremont resident.)
More than $13,000 in Bookstore funds
have also been used to purchase exercise
equipment, including two Lifecycles, a

Trotter treadmill and a Stairmaster. The
equipment, according to Speed, is located
in the Bookstore's warehouse in Newark,
Calif. — across the Bay — and is available
for the use of the entire Bookstore staff,
he says.
But, by far, the most unusual compen
sation arrangement in the eyes of tax

experts contacted by lhe
Daily stems from the
relationship between
Speed and Chiaramonte's
consulting firm and the
Bookstore.
In addition to the
arrangement on the
Twain Harte house, the
Bookstore is leasing a
1989 Holiday Rambler

Imperial motor home from Colleagues
Management Services. The motor home,
too, is available for use of Bookstore
employees, Speed says, but "it doesn't get
as much use as the house does."
Colleagues Management Services like
ly paid more than $50,000 to buy the
vehicle, according to a salesman at Dan
Gamels' Travel Trails in Scotts Valley,
where the motor home was purchased.
It's not clear how much the Bookstore is
paying Speed and Chiaramonte's consult
ing firm for its use.
The two lease arrangements with the

Bookstore are apparently the only
sources of income Colleagues Manage
ment Services has had for the last sever
al years. In an interview, Speed indicated
that the firm actually did engage in con
sulting work several years ago, but said
he couldn't remember the last time they
had had a client.
Lease arrangements not disclosed
The Bookstore has failed to disclose
either lease arrangement in its annual
returns to the Internal Revenue Service,
even though there is a question that asks
specifically if the store has leased proper
ty or services from another corporation
that has officers affiliated with the Book
store.
Speed is the chief executive officer of
Colleagues Management Services,
according to a filing made with Califor
nia's Secretary of State in 1984. Chiara
monte is the secretary and chief financial
officer, and the fathers of both Speed and
Chiaramonte are listed as the consulting
firm's directors.
While such lease arrangements are not
necessarily improper, the IRS asks the
question as "a tool" to help determine
whether a nonprofit organization is
involved in self-dealing and channeling
money to its insiders, according to IRS
spokesperson Pam Mac Lean.
The IRS wouldn't comment on the
Bookstore's arrangement in particular.
But Mac Lean noted that organizations
that do have such lease arrangements are
supposed to provide detailed statements
to the IRS explaining them and demon
strating their necessity.
Chiaramonte, who signed the Book
store's tax return last year, blamed the
failure to disclose the leases on Mark
Scheffield of Abbott, Stringham & Lynch,
who prepares the Bookstore's tax
returns. Scheffield declined to comment
on the matter.
A 'quite splendid' perk
The lease arrangement on the Twain
Harte house, says Stansky, the president
of the Bookstore's board, is intended as
"a sort of retirement benefit" for Speed
and Chiaramonte, who, he says, "are
among the best college book people in the
country." Back in the mid-'Bos, when the
arrangement was approved, "we thought
we'd be in danger of losing them. That
would have been disastrous."
In addition, he says, the house is a
"quite splendid" perquisite for current
staff members. "I see it as a wonderful
thing."
The house has two master bedrooms,
two master bathrooms, two additional
bedrooms and one-and-a-half additional
bathrooms, plus a "large playroom for the
kids," according to Dave Turner of Dave

built the house. The home, Turner says,
"was custom-built for the Stanford Book

ent families could use it simultaneously
and maintain some degree of privacy.

according to Larry Abreo of the Twain

offers skiing in the winter, and golf, fishing
and boating in the summer, Abreo says.

1989 Volvo 740;
• Greg Gunn, who manages the Book
store's computer system, is provided with
a green and tan 1987 Ford Bronco XLT
Explorer; and
• Randy Winn, the Stanford Bookstore
Palo Alto manager, drives a light blue
1989 Mercury Sable wagon leased by the
Bookstore's for-profit subsidiary.
(The subsidiary runs the Palo Alto
store, a clothing shop in the Stanford
Shopping Center, and a half-dozen com
munity college bookstores in the Bay
Area and southern California.)
Speed, in addition to his Infiniti Q45,
also apparently has use of a blue and gray
1990 Chevrolet Suburban van, purchased
by the Bookstore for $27,801 in Decem
ber 1989. The Suburban was seen sitting
in front of Speed's home in Fremont last
June with a power boat attached. (The
boat itself is owned personally by Speed
and another Fremont resident.)
More than $13,000 in Bookstore funds
have also been used to purchase exercise
equipment, including two Lifecycles, a

Trotter treadmill and a Stairmaster. The
equipment, according to Speed, is located
in the Bookstore's warehouse in Newark,
Calif. — across the Bay — and is available
for the use of the entire Bookstore staff,
he says.
But, by far, the most unusual compen
sation arrangement in the eyes of tax

experts contacted by lhe
Daily stems from the
relationship between
Speed and Chiaramonte's
consulting firm and the
Bookstore.
In addition to the
arrangement on the
Twain Harte house, the
Bookstore is leasing a
1989 Holiday Rambler

Imperial motor home from Colleagues
Management Services. The motor home,
too, is available for use of Bookstore
employees, Speed says, but "it doesn't get
as much use as the house does."
Colleagues Management Services like
ly paid more than $50,000 to buy the
vehicle, according to a salesman at Dan
Gamels' Travel Trails in Scotts Valley,
where the motor home was purchased.
It's not clear how much the Bookstore is
paying Speed and Chiaramonte's consult
ing firm for its use.
The two lease arrangements with the

Bookstore are apparently the only
sources of income Colleagues Manage
ment Services has had for the last sever
al years. In an interview, Speed indicated
that the firm actually did engage in con
sulting work several years ago, but said
he couldn't remember the last time they
had had a client.
Lease arrangements not disclosed
The Bookstore has failed to disclose
either lease arrangement in its annual
returns to the Internal Revenue Service,
even though there is a question that asks
specifically if the store has leased proper
ty or services from another corporation
that has officers affiliated with the Book
store.
Speed is the chief executive officer of
Colleagues Management Services,
according to a filing made with Califor
nia's Secretary of State in 1984. Chiara
monte is the secretary and chief financial
officer, and the fathers of both Speed and
Chiaramonte are listed as the consulting
firm's directors.
While such lease arrangements are not
necessarily improper, the IRS asks the
question as "a tool" to help determine
whether a nonprofit organization is
involved in self-dealing and channeling
money to its insiders, according to IRS
spokesperson Pam Mac Lean.
The IRS wouldn't comment on the
Bookstore's arrangement in particular.
But Mac Lean noted that organizations
that do have such lease arrangements are
supposed to provide detailed statements
to the IRS explaining them and demon
strating their necessity.
Chiaramonte, who signed the Book
store's tax return last year, blamed the
failure to disclose the leases on Mark
Scheffield of Abbott, Stringham & Lynch,
who prepares the Bookstore's tax
returns. Scheffield declined to comment
on the matter.
A 'quite splendid' perk
The lease arrangement on the Twain
Harte house, says Stansky, the president
of the Bookstore's board, is intended as
"a sort of retirement benefit" for Speed
and Chiaramonte, who, he says, "are
among the best college book people in the
country." Back in the mid-'Bos, when the
arrangement was approved, "we thought
we'd be in danger of losing them. That
would have been disastrous."
In addition, he says, the house is a
"quite splendid" perquisite for current
staff members. "I see it as a wonderful
thing."
The house has two master bedrooms,
two master bathrooms, two additional
bedrooms and one-and-a-half additional
bathrooms, plus a "large playroom for the
kids," according to Dave Turner of Dave
Turner Construction, who designed and
built the house. The home, Turner says,
"was custom-built for the Stanford Book
store" and was designed so that two differ
ent families could use it simultaneously
and maintain some degree of privacy.
Twain Harte, where the house is located.

is a small vacation-rental community with
a permanent population of about 3,750,
according to Larry Abreo of the Twain
Harte Chamber of Commerce. The area
offers skiing in the winter, and golf, fishing
and boating in the summer, Abreo says.
In April 1987, the Bookstore pur
chased a Laser II sailboat for use of
employees vacationing at the Twain
Harte home. The boat was purchased at
Seabird Sailing in Berkeley for $3,745,
according to documents obtained by The
Daily.
Monthly payments covered
In an interview last week, Speed con
firmed that the Bookstore has a long
term lease on the Twain Harte house, but
refused to discuss its terms in much
detail, saying questions on the matter
were an "invasion of privacy."
He did, however, acknowledge that the
lease arrangement is sufficient to cover
the monthly payments on loans his and
Chiaramonte's consulting firm obtained
to finance the house's construction, and
that the Bookstore pays all other expens-

es associated with the
house.
According to docu
ments filed in Tuolumne
County, where the Twain
Harte house is located,
Colleagues Management
Services obtained two
loans, one in 1985, the
other in 1986. The com
bined principal on the

loans was $209,000. It is impossible to
determine the precise monthly payments
on the loans, however, because the docu
ments do not indicate the interest rate or
period of repayment.
Speed and Chiaramonte would not dis
close this information.
Other expenses the Bookstore is likely
paying include property tax on the lot,
which was $3,249.68 last year, as well as
utilities, insurance and cleaning costs.
According to Alice Stapp, a local realtor,
the same woman who does cleaning for
her is paid to clean the house leased by
the Bookstore.
In any event, local realtors in Twain
Harte say it is highly unusual for the
Bookstore to be leasing such a large home
on a long-term basis. It would have made
much more sense from the Bookstore's
perspective, the realtors say, to have pur
chased the home or to have built a new
home so that the store could profit from
the investment.
"You couldn't find someone to rent a
house like that for more than a weekend
at a time," says Wayne Stapp of Realty
World Evergreen Properties. "People
here don't rent for more than a couple
months before buying something."
'A long-term benefit for us'
In the Bookstore's case, when the
property is sold, Speed and Chiara
monte's consulting firm will receive the

Stansky
profit from the sale. The vacation home,
Speed says, is intended as "a short-term

benefit for the staff, and
hopefully a long-term
benefit for us."
Local realtors say
that, even given the
depressed real estate
market, the current
value of the house is
around $400,000. One
realtor, Chucker Twin
ing of Lupo Properties

in Twain Harte, suggested the house
would likely sell for more than $500,000.
Colleagues Management Services was
incorporated in April 1984. A month
later, the firm issued stock in exchange
for $1,000, according to a filing with the
state's Department of Corporations.
Speed and Chiaramonte confirmed last
week that they are the firm's only stock
holders.
Fifteen months after the stock
issuance, Colleagues Management pur
chased an empty three-acre lot in Twain
Harte for about $65,000, according to

documents obtained by The Daily.
"Back in 1984 we had a client," Speed
says. He wouldn't say who the client was,
or even what kind of consulting was
involved, but did say that the arrange
ment with the client "must have been big
enough" to cover the land purchase.
The client Speed was referring to was
likely the University of California-San
Francisco Medical School, according to
Jack Friedenthal, a former Stanford
Law School professor who served as
president of the Bookstore board for 14
years.
Speed and Chiaramonte devoted a fair
amount of time in the early 1980s to
helping turn around that medical
school's bookstore, and were paid rather
handsomely, Friedenthal says.
Colleagues' beginnings
Because Speed and Chiaramonte felt
they had obtained the consulting job due
to their Stanford Bookstore credentials,
they felt "morally required" to somehow
turn the money over to the Bookstore,
Friedenthal says. They ended up doing so,
he says, by purchasing a recreational vehi
cle that Bookstore employees could use (a

different vehicle than is currently owned
by Colleagues Management Services).
It was later decided, Friedenthal says,
to sell the recreational vehicle and buy
land in Twain Harte.
Speed and Chiaramonte contacted
Dave Turner Construction almost imme
diately after purchasing the property in
August 1985, according to Turner. Con
struction on the home was completed by
July 1986.
In September 1986, the Bookstore
began purchasing furnishings for the
house, including a Dynasty Hide-a-Bed, a
wood-burning stove, chairs, barstools,
television sets, a china cabinet, several
beds and $1,600 worth of utensils. In
June 1987, a Royale Spa hot tub was pur
chased and placed in a $2,594 frame deck
the Bookstore had purchased a few
months before.
By January 1989, the Bookstore had
spent more than $69,000 to furnish the
house.

The Stanford Bookstore has been leasing the above Holiday Rambler Imperial motor home from Colleagues Management
Services, a consulting firm owned by the Bookstore's top two managers.
For the last several years, the Stanford
Bookstore has been leasing a vacation
home in central California from a consult
ing firm privately owned and operated by
the Bookstore's top two managers, Eldon
Speed and Philip Chiaramonte.
In addition to thousands of dollars in
lease payments made to Speed and
Chiaramonte's consulting firm, the
Bookstore has spent more than $69,000
to furnish the two-story, 3,100 square
foot home, according to documents
obtained by The Daily. Among the pur
chases made with Bookstore funds were a
$4,341 hot tub, a $5,888 satellite dish
and a $3,681 comforter and bedroom set.
Located in Twain Harte, Calif., about
125 miles east of Stanford on the edge of
the Stanislaus National Forest, the home
is made available by the Bookstore free of
charge to families of many of its senior
employees.
For Speed, the Bookstore's general
manager, and Chiaramonte, its assistant
manager, the home provides a dual bene
fit. Since 1986, the house has been at
their disposal as a vacation facility at the
Bookstore's expense. And, because their
consulting firm owns the property, Speed

and Chiaramonte will be the beneficiaries
when it is eventually sold, profiting on
the investment by perhaps tens of thou
sands of dollars.
In the meantime, the Bookstore,
through its lease payments to the con
sulting firm, has effectively been paying
off $209,000 in loans Speed and Chiara
monte obtained in the mid-'Bos to finance
the construction of the home. Their con
sulting firm, called Colleagues Manage
ment Services, hasn't had a client in
years, according to Speed.
The lease arrangement was discovered
by The Daily as part of an investigation of
the compensation practices of the Book
store, a tax-exempt, nonprofit corporation
run independently of the University and
overseen by a board of directors composed
of Stanford faculty, staff and, in some
years, one or two Stanford students.
History Prof. Peter Stansky, the cur
rent president of the Bookstore's board,
contends the lease arrangement on the
Twain Harte house is a way to supple
ment the pension plans of Speed and
Chiaramonte, while at the same time pro
viding the Bookstore staff with "a quite
splendid" perquisite.
"Our aim is to reward people in the

Bookstore so that they can best serve the
community," he says.
Speed, too, contends the relationship
is perfectly legitimate. "If it's devious, it
wasn't intended to be," he says.
Cadillacs and a small sailboat
During the past six months, The Daily
has examined the Bookstore's last seven
federal tax returns and scores of filings
the store made with various state and
county government offices, and has inter
viewed numerous past and present Book
store employees, managers of other col
lege bookstores and several tax experts.
The Daily has found that the Stanford
Bookstore has been spending thousands of
dollars a year to provide its senior employ
ees with a host of perquisites that are
unheard of elsewhere in the college book
store industry (see related story, page 7).
In addition to use of the vacation
home, many senior employees are cur
rently provided with automobiles — the
Bookstore has purchased three Cadillacs
in the last three years — use of a $50,000
motor home, use of a Bookstore-owned
sailboat, and use of more than $13,000
worth of exercise equipment purchased
with Bookstore funds.
In interviews with other bookstore
managers and industry representatives,
the mere suggestion of a college bookstore
providing vehicles and vacation facilities
to their employees was often ridiculed.
"You're really stretching it there,"
says Steve Johnson, who conducted a
recent survey of managers' salaries for
the National Association of College
Stores. "Things like that are exceptional.
Those are extraneous perks. I haven't
heard of anything like that."
At the Harvard Coop, for example,
where annual sales are roughly 60 per
cent higher than at Stanford, no employ
ees are provided with vehicles or vacation
facilities. "We have nothing like that,"
says Jerry Murphy, the store's top man
ager. "That's kind of unusual. The only
perks you really get are, quite frankly, a
discount at the store."
Comparisons to other bookstores are
meaningful because nonprofit corpora
tions, such as the Stanford Bookstore, are
restricted by state and federal laws to pro
viding their employees with no more than
"reasonable compensation." While tax
experts say there is no set formula for
determining how much and what types of
compensation are "reasonable," the first
place they look is at others in the industry.
"You have to look at what the industry
standard is," says Larry Wright, a
spokesman for the Internal Revenue Ser
vice. While Wright and representatives
from the state's Franchise Tax Board
were hesitant to comment specifically on
the Bookstore, they acknowledged that
some of the perquisites offered appeared
unusual.
"Certainly, some of this could be ques
tionable," says Jim Shepherd, a
spokesman for the Franchise Tax Board.
Seven managers with cars
In addition to a salary well over
$100,000, Speed, the Bookstore's general
manager, is provided with use of a 1991
model year Infiniti Q45, a car on which
lease payments typically run about $650
a month, according to James Woodhouse
of Infiniti Finance in Torrance, Calif., the
company from which the Bookstore is
leasing the vehicle.
Chiaramonte, the store's assistant man
ager, also makes well over $ 100,000 a year,
and currently drives a 1990 Cadillac Eldo
rado Biarritz, purchased by the Bookstore
in November 1989 for $34,552, according
to a depreciation schedule attached to the
store's fiscal year 1989-90 tax return.
Besides Speed and Chiaramonte, at
least five other senior employees of the
Bookstore are currently provided with
Bookstore-owned or -leased automobiles,
The Daily has learned:
• Roger Reynolds, the book division

manager, is provided with a red 1989
Acura Legend;
• Laura Dowling, the clothing and sou
venir manager, is provided with a white
1989 Mazda RX-7 convertible;
• Scott Frisby, the shipping and receiv
ing manager, is provided with a black
1989 Volvo 740;
• Greg Gunn, who manages the Book
store's computer system, is provided with
a green and tan 1987 Ford Bronco XLT
Explorer; and
• Randy Winn, the Stanford Bookstore
Palo Alto manager, drives a light blue
1989 Mercury Sable wagon leased by the
Bookstore's for-profit subsidiary.
(The subsidiary runs the Palo Alto
store, a clothing shop in the Stanford
Shopping Center, and a half-dozen com
munity college bookstores in the Bay
Area and southern California.)
Speed, in addition to his Infiniti Q45,
also apparently has use of a blue and gray
1990 Chevrolet Suburban van, purchased
by the Bookstore for $27,801 in Decem
ber 1989. The Suburban was seen sitting
in front of Speed's home in Fremont last
June with a power boat attached. (The
boat itself is owned personally by Speed
and another Fremont resident.)
More than $13,000 in Bookstore funds
have also been used to purchase exercise
equipment, including two Lifecycles, a

Trotter treadmill and a Stairmaster. The
equipment, according to Speed, is located
in the Bookstore's warehouse in Newark,
Calif. — across the Bay — and is available
for the use of the entire Bookstore staff,
he says.
But, by far, the most unusual compen
sation arrangement in the eyes of tax

experts contacted by lhe
Daily stems from the
relationship between
Speed and Chiaramonte's
consulting firm and the
Bookstore.
In addition to the
arrangement on the
Twain Harte house, the
Bookstore is leasing a
1989 Holiday Rambler

Imperial motor home from Colleagues
Management Services. The motor home,
too, is available for use of Bookstore
employees, Speed says, but "it doesn't get
as much use as the house does."
Colleagues Management Services like
ly paid more than $50,000 to buy the
vehicle, according to a salesman at Dan
Gamels' Travel Trails in Scotts Valley,
where the motor home was purchased.
It's not clear how much the Bookstore is
paying Speed and Chiaramonte's consult
ing firm for its use.
The two lease arrangements with the

Bookstore are apparently the only
sources of income Colleagues Manage

that the firm actually did engage in con

federal tax returns and scores of filings
the store made with various state and
county government offices, and has inter
viewed numerous past and present Book
store employees, managers of other col
lege bookstores and several tax experts.
The Daily has found that the Stanford
Bookstore has been spending thousands of
dollars a year to provide its senior employ
ees with a host of perquisites that are
unheard of elsewhere in the college book
store industry (see related story, page 7).
In addition to use of the vacation
home, many senior employees are cur
rently provided with automobiles — the
Bookstore has purchased three Cadillacs
in the last three years — use of a $50,000
motor home, use of a Bookstore-owned
sailboat, and use of more than $13,000
worth of exercise equipment purchased
with Bookstore funds.
In interviews with other bookstore
managers and industry representatives,
the mere suggestion of a college bookstore
providing vehicles and vacation facilities
to their employees was often ridiculed.
"You're really stretching it there,"
says Steve Johnson, who conducted a
recent survey of managers' salaries for
the National Association of College
Stores. "Things like that are exceptional.
Those are extraneous perks. I haven't
heard of anything like that."
At the Harvard Coop, for example,
where annual sales are roughly 60 per
cent higher than at Stanford, no employ
ees are provided with vehicles or vacation
facilities. "We have nothing like that,"
says Jerry Murphy, the store's top man
ager. "That's kind of unusual. The only
perks you really get are, quite frankly, a
discount at the store."
Comparisons to other bookstores are
meaningful because nonprofit corpora
tions, such as the Stanford Bookstore, are
restricted by state and federal laws to pro
viding their employees with no more than
"reasonable compensation." While tax
experts say there is no set formula for
determining how much and what types of
compensation are "reasonable," the first
place they look is at others in the industry.
"You have to look at what the industry
standard is," says Larry Wright, a
spokesman for the Internal Revenue Ser
vice. While Wright and representatives
from the state's Franchise Tax Board
were hesitant to comment specifically on
the Bookstore, they acknowledged that
some of the perquisites offered appeared
unusual.
"Certainly, some of this could be ques
tionable," says Jim Shepherd, a
spokesman for the Franchise Tax Board.
Seven managers with cars
In addition to a salary well over
$100,000, Speed, the Bookstore's general
manager, is provided with use of a 1991
model year Infiniti Q45, a car on which
lease payments typically run about $650
a month, according to James Woodhouse
of Infiniti Finance in Torrance, Calif., the
company from which the Bookstore is
leasing the vehicle.
Chiaramonte, the store's assistant man
ager, also makes well over $ 100,000 a year,
and currently drives a 1990 Cadillac Eldo
rado Biarritz, purchased by the Bookstore
in November 1989 for $34,552, according
to a depreciation schedule attached to the
store's fiscal year 1989-90 tax return.
Besides Speed and Chiaramonte, at
least five other senior employees of the
Bookstore are currently provided with
Bookstore-owned or -leased automobiles,
The Daily has learned:
• Roger Reynolds, the book division

manager, is provided with a red 1989
Acura Legend;
• Laura Dowling, the clothing and sou
venir manager, is provided with a white
1989 Mazda RX-7 convertible;
• Scott Frisby, the shipping and receiv
ing manager, is provided with a black
1989 Volvo 740;
• Greg Gunn, who manages the Book
store's computer system, is provided with
a green and tan 1987 Ford Bronco XLT
Explorer; and
• Randy Winn, the Stanford Bookstore
Palo Alto manager, drives a light blue
1989 Mercury Sable wagon leased by the
Bookstore's for-profit subsidiary.
(The subsidiary runs the Palo Alto
store, a clothing shop in the Stanford
Shopping Center, and a half-dozen com
munity college bookstores in the Bay
Area and southern California.)
Speed, in addition to his Infiniti Q45,
also apparently has use of a blue and gray
1990 Chevrolet Suburban van, purchased
by the Bookstore for $27,801 in Decem
ber 1989. The Suburban was seen sitting
in front of Speed's home in Fremont last
June with a power boat attached. (The
boat itself is owned personally by Speed
and another Fremont resident.)
More than $13,000 in Bookstore funds
have also been used to purchase exercise
equipment, including two Lifecycles, a

Trotter treadmill and a Stairmaster. The
equipment, according to Speed, is located
in the Bookstore's warehouse in Newark,
Calif. — across the Bay — and is available
for the use of the entire Bookstore staff,
he says.
But, by far, the most unusual compen
sation arrangement in the eyes of tax

experts contacted by lhe
Daily stems from the
relationship between
Speed and Chiaramonte's
consulting firm and the
Bookstore.
In addition to the
arrangement on the
Twain Harte house, the
Bookstore is leasing a
1989 Holiday Rambler

Imperial motor home from Colleagues
Management Services. The motor home,
too, is available for use of Bookstore
employees, Speed says, but "it doesn't get
as much use as the house does."
Colleagues Management Services like
ly paid more than $50,000 to buy the
vehicle, according to a salesman at Dan
Gamels' Travel Trails in Scotts Valley,
where the motor home was purchased.
It's not clear how much the Bookstore is
paying Speed and Chiaramonte's consult
ing firm for its use.
The two lease arrangements with the

Bookstore are apparently the only
sources of income Colleagues Manage
ment Services has had for the last sever
al years. In an interview, Speed indicated
that the firm actually did engage in con
sulting work several years ago, but said
he couldn't remember the last time they
had had a client.
Lease arrangements not disclosed
The Bookstore has failed to disclose
either lease arrangement in its annual
returns to the Internal Revenue Service,
even though there is a question that asks
specifically if the store has leased proper
ty or services from another corporation
that has officers affiliated with the Book
store.
Speed is the chief executive officer of
Colleagues Management Services,
according to a filing made with Califor
nia's Secretary of State in 1984. Chiara
monte is the secretary and chief financial
officer, and the fathers of both Speed and
Chiaramonte are listed as the consulting
firm's directors.
While such lease arrangements are not
necessarily improper, the IRS asks the
question as "a tool" to help determine
whether a nonprofit organization is
involved in self-dealing and channeling
money to its insiders, according to IRS
spokesperson Pam Mac Lean.
The IRS wouldn't comment on the
Bookstore's arrangement in particular.
But Mac Lean noted that organizations
that do have such lease arrangements are
supposed to provide detailed statements
to the IRS explaining them and demon
strating their necessity.
Chiaramonte, who signed the Book
store's tax return last year, blamed the
failure to disclose the leases on Mark
Scheffield of Abbott, Stringham & Lynch,
who prepares the Bookstore's tax
returns. Scheffield declined to comment
on the matter.
A 'quite splendid' perk
The lease arrangement on the Twain
Harte house, says Stansky, the president
of the Bookstore's board, is intended as
"a sort of retirement benefit" for Speed
and Chiaramonte, who, he says, "are
among the best college book people in the
country." Back in the mid-'Bos, when the
arrangement was approved, "we thought
we'd be in danger of losing them. That
would have been disastrous."
In addition, he says, the house is a
"quite splendid" perquisite for current
staff members. "I see it as a wonderful
thing."
The house has two master bedrooms,
two master bathrooms, two additional
bedrooms and one-and-a-half additional
bathrooms, plus a "large playroom for the
kids," according to Dave Turner of Dave
Turner Construction, who designed and
built the house. The home, Turner says,
"was custom-built for the Stanford Book
store" and was designed so that two differ
ent families could use it simultaneously
and maintain some degree of privacy.
Twain Harte, where the house is located.

is a small vacation-rental community with
a permanent population of about 3,750,
according to Larry Abreo of the Twain
Harte Chamber of Commerce. The area
offers skiing in the winter, and golf, fishing
and boating in the summer, Abreo says.
In April 1987, the Bookstore pur
chased a Laser II sailboat for use of
employees vacationing at the Twain
Harte home. The boat was purchased at
Seabird Sailing in Berkeley for $3,745,
according to documents obtained by The
Daily.
Monthly payments covered
In an interview last week, Speed con
firmed that the Bookstore has a long
term lease on the Twain Harte house, but
refused to discuss its terms in much
detail, saying questions on the matter
were an "invasion of privacy."
He did, however, acknowledge that the
lease arrangement is sufficient to cover
the monthly payments on loans his and
Chiaramonte's consulting firm obtained
to finance the house's construction, and
that the Bookstore pays all other expens-

es associated with the
house.
According to docu
ments filed in Tuolumne
County, where the Twain
Harte house is located,
Colleagues Management
Services obtained two
loans, one in 1985, the
other in 1986. The com
bined principal on the

loans was $209,000. It is impossible to
determine the precise monthly payments
on the loans, however, because the docu
ments do not indicate the interest rate or
period of repayment.
Speed and Chiaramonte would not dis
close this information.
Other expenses the Bookstore is likely
paying include property tax on the lot,
which was $3,249.68 last year, as well as
utilities, insurance and cleaning costs.
According to Alice Stapp, a local realtor,
the same woman who does cleaning for
her is paid to clean the house leased by
the Bookstore.
In any event, local realtors in Twain
Harte say it is highly unusual for the
Bookstore to be leasing such a large home
on a long-term basis. It would have made
much more sense from the Bookstore's
perspective, the realtors say, to have pur
chased the home or to have built a new
home so that the store could profit from
the investment.
"You couldn't find someone to rent a
house like that for more than a weekend
at a time," says Wayne Stapp of Realty
World Evergreen Properties. "People
here don't rent for more than a couple
months before buying something."
'A long-term benefit for us'
In the Bookstore's case, when the
property is sold, Speed and Chiara
monte's consulting firm will receive the

Stansky
profit from the sale. The vacation home,
Speed says, is intended as "a short-term

benefit for the staff, and
hopefully a long-term
benefit for us."
Local realtors say
that, even given the
depressed real estate
market, the current
value of the house is
around $400,000. One
realtor, Chucker Twin
ing of Lupo Properties

in Twain Harte, suggested the house
would likely sell for more than $500,000.
Colleagues Management Services was
incorporated in April 1984. A month
later, the firm issued stock in exchange
for $1,000, according to a filing with the
state's Department of Corporations.
Speed and Chiaramonte confirmed last
week that they are the firm's only stock
holders.
Fifteen months after the stock
issuance, Colleagues Management pur
chased an empty three-acre lot in Twain
Harte for about $65,000, according to

documents obtained by The Daily.
"Back in 1984 we had a client," Speed
says. He wouldn't say who the client was,
or even what kind of consulting was
involved, but did say that the arrange
ment with the client "must have been big
enough" to cover the land purchase.
The client Speed was referring to was
likely the University of California-San
Francisco Medical School, according to
Jack Friedenthal, a former Stanford
Law School professor who served as
president of the Bookstore board for 14
years.
Speed and Chiaramonte devoted a fair
amount of time in the early 1980s to
helping turn around that medical
school's bookstore, and were paid rather
handsomely, Friedenthal says.
Colleagues' beginnings
Because Speed and Chiaramonte felt
they had obtained the consulting job due
to their Stanford Bookstore credentials,
they felt "morally required" to somehow
turn the money over to the Bookstore,
Friedenthal says. They ended up doing so,
he says, by purchasing a recreational vehi
cle that Bookstore employees could use (a

different vehicle than is currently owned
by Colleagues Management Services).
It was later decided, Friedenthal says,
to sell the recreational vehicle and buy
land in Twain Harte.
Speed and Chiaramonte contacted
Dave Turner Construction almost imme
diately after purchasing the property in
August 1985, according to Turner. Con
struction on the home was completed by
July 1986.
In September 1986, the Bookstore
began purchasing furnishings for the
house, including a Dynasty Hide-a-Bed, a
wood-burning stove, chairs, barstools,
television sets, a china cabinet, several
beds and $1,600 worth of utensils. In
June 1987, a Royale Spa hot tub was pur
chased and placed in a $2,594 frame deck
the Bookstore had purchased a few
months before.
By January 1989, the Bookstore had
spent more than $69,000 to furnish the
house.
