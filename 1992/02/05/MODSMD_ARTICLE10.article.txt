# Witness to history
## Karl lectures on Latin America — and helps mold its future 
### Kim McCreery Staff writer 
Terry Karl has been leading a
double life.
At Stanford, the political sci
ence professor lectures students
in Latin American studies. But
on weekends, she slips away to
Mexico, Central or South Ameri
ca to study as well as shape the
area — from conducting research
to assisting in international peace
talks.
Karl recently returned from
Mexico, where she was witness to
the historic signing of a peace
treaty ending a 12-year war in El
Salvador.
Although she said she can't
divulge the extent of her role in
the peace talks, Karl has spent
several years mediating between
El Salvador's government and
the guerillas.
Prior to 1989, Karl visited El
Salvador every year. She hasn't
returned since what she calls
"the turning point" in Salvado
ran struggles — the murder of six
Jesuit priests, two of whom Karl
says she knew well. Before the
incident, she had invited the two
to be visiting professors at the
Latin American Studies Center
at Stanford.
"When the two priests were
murdered, lots of people actively
campaigned to cut military aid to
El Salvador," Karl said.
Karl began her work in Latin
America doing research for Con
gressional delegations and inves
tigating U.S. aid for the House
Committee on Inter-American
Affairs.
She began her "systematic
research" by talking with peas
ants, radical party members,

presidents and army officials,
even creeping into guerilla zones
to interview their commanders.
Later, while studying in
Venezuela, she met several exiled
Salvadoran leaders, including
former President Jose Napoleon
Duarte.
When she returned to El Sal
vador in 1979 to continue her
congressional research, Karl said
she "got hooked" and wanted to
start her own projects.
"Once I saw the human rights
abuses, I couldn't not become
involved," she said. "There were
bodies in the McDonald's parking
lot.
"You could walk into a nice,
middle-class home and see four
men lying dead on the floor with
phrases like 'for being a commu
nist' smeared across their chest.
"Walking down a street, there
would be a peasant lying on the
ground with leaves stuffed in his
mouth. That meant he supported

'Once I saw the human
rights abuses, I
couldn't not become
involved.'

land reform."
Although abuses such as these
were common throughout the
1980s, Karl said she has seen
drastic improvements in recent
years.
"A few years ago, the murder
rate of security forces killing
civilians reached about a thou
sand murders a month," she said.
"Last year the deaths dropped to
108 for the year."
The Salvadoran peace accords
were officially signed on Jan. 16,
1992. The cease-fire went into
effect on Feb. 1, 1992.
One thousand United Nations
observers are currently stationed
in El Salvador to help implement
the peace accords, and Karl said
she sees great optimism among
the country's citizens.
"There is enormous confi
dence that they can get their
economy moving again," she said.
"They believe they can get the
country out of economic stagna
tion."
But Karl said she also "imag
ines a great falling off of U.S. aid"
to El Salvador.
"There will never again be $2
million a day pouring into the
country with virtually no control
over where the money ends up,"
she said.
At a colloquium in the Latin
American Studies house yester
day, Karl spoke about the prob
lems related to U.S. intervention
in the Salvadoran conflict.
