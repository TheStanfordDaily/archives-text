### Leigh Burnside 
The Stanford chapter of Theta Delta Chi fra
ternity is planning to reorganize with the possi
bility of regaining its former house at 675 Lomita.
Row Director Diana Conklin said that fraterni
ty members have told her they would like to
return to 675 Lomita by fall quarter.
Fraternity members said they will hold an
informational meeting next week for those inter
ested in reorganizing the chapter, but would not
disclose details of their plans.
According to fraternity member and senior
Dave Sacks, a delegate from the national chapter
of Theta Delta Chi will attend the meeting and
may help members create a new charter for the
Stanford chapter.
Interfraternity Council President Steve Jar
rett said the proposal was discussed at the last
IFC meeting but Theta Delta Chi members have
not contacted him.
Conklin said the reinstatement of the fraterni
ty to 675 Lomita by the fall of 1992 is a realistic
expectation, adding, "I think [the members] are
committed to trying. It's do-able."
To regain the house, Conklin said, Theta Delta
Chi must update its local chapter's by-laws, com-

pose a mission statement explaining "what the
fraternity is about" and secure and retain an ade
quate chapter membership of at least 45 members
and no more than 10 percent boarders.
The fraternity must also remain free from
financial difficulties and misconduct, Conklin
said.
Heather Dunn, Program Coordinator at the
Office of Student Activities, said the fraternity
has yet to notify the OSA and members seemed
unwilling "to return a phone call." According
to Dunn, her office is "considering them still
inactive."
Tresidder Director Nanci Howe said the frater
nity is not technically inactive, but it hasn't par
ticipated in any programs this year. She said that
in order for the fraternity to reorganize, it must
raise its number of pledges during Rush this
spring as well as "develop internally."
If members of Theta Delta Chi reorganize and
"demonstrate they're active and able to assume
responsibility, of having the house," they will
regain their residence at 675 Lomita, Howe said.
The fraternity, which has been on campus
since 1903, voluntarily gave up its house at the
end of last year with the option to return follow
ing a strong and successful reorganization.
