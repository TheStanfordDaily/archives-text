## Equal accessibility 
### 
Innovation a necessity
in providing access for
people with disabilities

The recent passage of
the Americans with Disabili
ties Act, which requires equal
access, services and employment
opportunities for disabled people,
will force the University to take a
hard look at how best to improve
campus access and hiring practices.
But instead of looking at the leg
islation as a thorn in the adminis
tration's side during this time of
belt-tightening, the University
should seize the opportunity to
revitalize creative energy and forge
innovative solutions to challenges
faced by institutions nationwide.
Few will disagree with the spirit
of the legislation, since ideals of
equal opportunity and equal access
are entwined with our vision of the
American dream. But when it
comes down to specifics — the actu
al implementation of changes and
retrofitting of campus buildings —
some may balk at the price tag.
The University has always been
dedicated to the idea of disabled
access, at least on paper, but
improving campus buildings is
both expensive and structurally
problematic.
Campus officials say that access
to such oft-frequented places as
the Old Union Clubhouse and El
Centro Chicano has always been a
priority. But dedication does not
equal easy solutions.
For a ramp of legal proportions
to access certain rooms in Old
Union, it may end up stretching all
the way to Memorial Church, one
University official said. In addition,
aesthetics must also be considered
when retrofitting decades-old sand
stone buildings, many of which are
listed on the historical register.
But these complications need not
prevent the development of work
able solutions. At a university where
emphasis is often placed on the the

oretical, this new law provides an
opportunity to combine educational
goals with a practical mission.
Necessity is the mother of invention,
says the age-old adage, and once we
recognize the needs of the disabled,
we can work toward meeting them.
From hearing lectures to climb
ing stairs, there are many utilities
and privileges most take for grant
ed that create frustration for the
disabled.
Directional signs indicating exits
and restrooms provide little assis
tance to the blind. Fire alarms fall
short of helping deaf students in a
burning building. Doorknobs allow
entrance only to those who can
grasp them. And wheelchair users
cannot quench their thirst at water
fountains they cannot reach.
The new steno-captioning service
Stanford provided for deaf students
typifies the kind of innovations we
should be seeking. Initiated this
year, the service arranges for a
stenographer to attend classes with
the student, who can then read the
lecture on a laptop computer.
Researchers at Stanford are
always pushing the limits of exist
ing technology. We have pioneers
in every area of engineering and
computer science, and a strong
program in product design that
will hopefully continue to thrive
after budget cuts.
Through the combined creative
and technical expertise of both stu
dents and teachers, Stanford can
lead the pack in developing cut
ting-edge resources for the dis
abled. Compliance with the new
legislation can be incorporated
into the syllabus of engineering
and design courses and presented
as a chance for real-life application
of classroom learning.
The possibilities for innovation
and improvement are endless. The
clumsy elevator may be replaced
by smaller, less expensive electric
chair lifts, and other innovative
solutions such as braille direction
al signs and flashing hallway lights
will continue to present them
selves as Stanford emerges a lead
er in disabled-resource technology.
