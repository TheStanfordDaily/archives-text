## 'Spokesmodel' speaks out 
### 
THE SPOKESMODEL phenomenon:
When a "different" meets a group of
"alikes," that "different" immedi
ately becomes a spokesmodel.
Why spokesmodel and not spokesper
son? Well, the "different" never needs
extensive knowledge about their differ
ence; they simply need to look the part
and Shazam! they are a professional.
(Too bad education isn't like that. I could
just wear expensive Italian suits and
Shazam! who needs law school?)
Spokesmodels are inevitably over
whelmed with what are seemingly igno
rant, insensitive and at times funny ques
tions. Here is a literal list of my top ten
favorites:
10. Can I touch your hair?
9. How do you do your hair?
8. Do you wash your hair?
7. Can I try this velcro on your hair?
6. Is your pubic hair straight?
5. Do you get sunburns?
4. Do you get suntanned?
3. Why is your butt/lips so big?
2. Could you teach me to dance?
(Which is funny because I have about as
much rhythm as a hemorrhaging water
buffalo.)
1. Is your semen brown?
Black spokesmodels are not alone.
Talking to gay and lesbian friends con
firmed it. They are asked questions like

"Are you revolted by penises?" and "Do
you mean to tell me you would rather
sleep with A 1 Bundy than with his daugh
ter?"
Realizing that a trend exists, I asked
as many "differents" as I could find what
ignorant questions they get.
Woman: How are you going to balance
a career and a family? (Funny, but I have
never heard that question asked to a
man.)
Jewish person: Why did you guys kill
Christ?
Visually impaired person: What's
wrong with you? Why aren't you looking
at me?
Person with acne: What's that on your
face?
Person with leg in a cast: Did you hurt
your leg?
As a spokesmodel, I have come to two
conclusions. But first, I must say that I
am speaking for myself and not
spokesmodels as a group.
Questions reveal ignorance, and igno
rance is more easily combated when it is
exposed than when it is hidden.
Spokesmodel friends of mine have
often told me how tired they are of
answering the same questions over and
over, and how burdened they are with the
feeling that they have to educate the
entire campus. These sentiments, which
I often share, are real and more than jus
tified, yet I worry.

'Ignorance is
more easily
combated
when it is
exposed
rather than
hidden.'

I worry because I have seen how
quickly ignorance can breed prejudice,
sexism and a host of other ills. And I
worry because I have seen many of my
friends grow more and more reluctant to
ask questions for fear of negative
reprisals.
Insensitivity, when exposed, usually
dies.
Maybe I am naive, but I have come to
believe that the majority of people never
intend to be insensitive. However, I do
not believe that insensitivity should ever
be ignored or overlooked.
Bitter retaliations, however, are not
constructive. They simply breed fear and
imbed ignorance. Rational discourse,
however emphatic, assertive or forceful,
goes much further than spite.
In short, a dumb question is an invalu
able opportunity for both the asker and
the asked. I know, for I am not only a
spokesmodel. I am also an ignorant ques
tioner, and I wholeheartedly want to
thank all the "differents" for making my
Stanford education richer than any text
book or lecture ever could.
