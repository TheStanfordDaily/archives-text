## Sanford Dickert Race does not have to constrain social relationships 
### 
Ever since i first heard
Martin Luther King, Jr.'s speech
back in sixth grade, I have fostered
a quiet admiration for him and his vision
for America. But it was at a commemo
ration march for his birthday during my
freshman year at the college I attended
as an undergraduate that I had an oppor
tunity to demonstrate my feelings.
The Black Cultural Center had start
ed a march that year and I was only one
of four "white men" participating. I felt
strangely uneasy having the tables
turned, but as I listened to the speakers
reflecting on the visions of this man, I
knew I belonged. My dormmates
thought I was stupid to go — "Why
should you go to pay respects to a 'black
man'? You aren't black. Why should you
care?" they asked.
A year later, a cross burning at the
Black Cultural Center and racist slurs

appearing on the door of a black admin
istrator caused an upsurge in aware
ness of racism on campus. The univer
sity addressed the problem with a typi
cal bureaucratic mentality — trying to
ignore the incident and not "draw
unwanted media attention to the uni
versity."
After watching this insensitivity, I
wanted to do something to help. Howev
er, every person I would talk to was
wary of my motivations. Why would a
"white guy" want to help? It wasn't
until my black friend Daryl joined me
that groups of students of color even
considered my words.
When I first approached the president
of the Black Greek Council, I had to
relate my experiences of being an East
Coast Jew in the Midwest before she
started to listen. But once Daryl was
mentioned, she began to take me seri-

ously. After three weeks of canvasing,
only eight students out of 34,000 joined
me in trying to improve the university's
recruitment and retention practices.
The following year, our group of eight
recruited thirty new students. Soon
after, I discovered that the newer mem
bers of the committee didn't like the fact
that a "white guy" was one of the chair
men. Some of the students asked "Why
is he involved? What's he got invested?"
Because of their thoughts, the steering
committee suggested that I should step
down from my position and have Daryl
become the coordinating chairman.
My study buddies, who always chided
me on my work with minorities, laughed
when they heard that I had been asked
to step down. When they asked why I
wasn't hurt and why I still care, I
couldn't tell them. Not because I was
scared — I had argued with them about

such issues many times. It was because I
was fighting something ingrained in
their belief system, something they felt
was right and no amount of persuasion
would change their opinion.
In looking back, I realized that there
are a lot of "ingrained biases" for all
viewpoints to point fingers at. But does
it matter in the long run? Does it matter
that I was asked to leave when the com
mittee continued its work long after I
left? Does it matter that my friends
would chide my efforts when they would
not have given a moment of thought to
their attitudes? Does it really matter
that I am a "white man" honoring the
work of "black Baptist preacher?"
Maybe there is something to dream
about.
