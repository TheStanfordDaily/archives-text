A reader responds to
Daily's ethics survey

I would like to take advantage of your
invitation to comment on your editorial
decisions last quarter, in particular on
your use of "controversial photographs."
First of all, I must say I think the pho
tograph of the 303-pound cyst was abso
lutely unnecessary. Although it docu
mented a newsworthy event, it was in
poor taste to "front-page" it. Would you
publish a photograph of, say, Ronald Rea
gan's brain undergoing surgery? I hope
not. A photograph in this case serves no
purpose besides, perhaps, convincing
sceptics that the event actually happened.
On the other hand, I support your deci
sion to run the photograph of the dead
Iraqi soldier. I am prepared to believe that

your motives were idealistic and therefore
I applaud you for your bravery â€” I think
it took guts to print that. However, I wish
to frame my support with one caveat.
According to art critic and historian John
Berger, "confrontation with a pho
tographed moment of agony can mask a
far more extensive and urgent confronta
tion. Usually the wars which we are
shown are being fought 'in our name.'
What we are shown horrifies us. The next
step should be to confront our own lack of
political freedom."
However, the danger is that, having
turned away from such a photograph,
the individual feels shocked only by his
or her moral inadequacy. This means
the picture is shrugged off as simply
more evidence of the difficulty of the
human condition.
I hope The Daily can be fully aware of
the consequences of its decisions, even if

it does not choose to fully explain all of
its decisions to its readers.

Media inquiries should
not determine politics

I was astounded to see The Daily take
a "Moral Mtyority" approach regarding
the public's right to know [Candid Can
didate? Jan. 28]. I now know it's impos
sible to choose a qualified candidate
without a firm understanding of past
"wrongs." This is especially true when
the concept of "wrong" is so clear-cut, so
black and white. Furthermore, I've
learned that a "decline-to-comment" can
immediately be interpreted as an "I'm
guilty-string-me-up."

I propose that every candidate be pre
pared to answer general questions per
taining to intimate matters. How can I
vote for ASSU candidates without know
ing if they have read pornographic mate
rials? Can I select a senator without
knowing if she's had an abortion? Can I
choose a congressman without knowing
whether he's heterosexual or homosexu
al? Can I pick a governor without know
ing if he's had premarital sex? While
we're at it, maybe we should ask George
Bush if he's ever practiced oral sex?
Would anyone have a problem with
this proposal? After all, many Americans
consider one or more of the above to be
grave moral "transgressions."
Come on, Daily, wake up! We must
not let media inquisitions dictate the
future of American politics.
