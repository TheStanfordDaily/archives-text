# Applications drop slightly this year
## Other top schools see increases

Applications for undergrad
uate admission at Stanford
dropped slightly while Har
vard, Princeton, Yale and other
universities all saw their appli
cant pools increase.
That development occurred
simultaneously with a nation
wide decline in high school
graduates.
According to Dean of
Admissions James Montoya,
13,406 applications had been
received by Feb. 1, compared
with 13,457 on the same date
last year. That total includes
148 applications awaiting
application fees or fee waiv
ers.
Applications are up, howev
er, at other private universities
across the United States —
including a 25 percent increase
in the number of applicants to
Rice University.
Montoya said he was "not
overly concerned" by the statis
tics and described Stanford as
"right in line with other
schools. If we were well below"
other competitive institutions

there would be cause for con
cern, he said.
Montoya stressed that Stan
ford's numbers are "way up"
from the 12,953 applications it
received in 1990-91.
He added that the quality of
the applicants has not declined.
"Based on the first three weeks
of an eight-week process, the
quality is truly exceptional," he
said.
Of other private universi
ties, Rice has seen the most
drastic increase, from 6,000
applications last year to about
7,500 this year, according to
Rice Dean of Admissions
Richard Stabell.
Stabell attributes the
increase to a Money Magazine
article that rated Rice as the
best buy in higher education.
He added that he expects the
leap to make admission to Rice
more selective.
Yale's applications have
risen 2 percent from last year,
according to Director of Under
graduate Admissions Margit
Dahl. Yale had received 10,945
applications as of Jan. 30, com
pared with 10,760 received last
year.
MIT Director of Admissions
Michael Behnke has also seen
applications increase this year,
from last year's total of 6,473
applications to 6,576 as of Feb. 4.
"The worst is over," Behnke
said, referring to the decline in
applications to MIT and other
universities that occurred in the
late 1980s.
However, he said he thinks
students see the decline in high
school graduates as their chance
to enter a more competitive insti
tution.
"I don't think the pool is as
strong as it was a few years ago,"
he said.
The number of applicants to
Princeton has remained stable in
recent years, according to the
school's admissions dean, Fred
Hardagon. Princeton received
12,770 applications this year —
50 more than last year.
But Hardagon, who was Stan
ford's admissions dean during the
early 1980s, was reluctant to com
ment on the implications of these
figures.
"I think the more important
issue will come up in April, when
students decide where they can
afford to enroll," he said.
Although Harvard's applica
tions are still being counted, its
admissions dean, William
Fitzsimmons, estimated their
number at 13,000, a figure signif
icantly higher than last year's
total of 12,589.
"We're quite pleased, given the
declining number of high school
graduates," Fitzsimmons said.
Applications to colleges may
actually increase in the future,
according to a Jan. 22 report in
the Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion. The college enrollment rate
is expected to rise 13 percent in
the next 10 years, from 14.1 mil
lion in 1991 to 16 million in 2002,
according to the report.

The Chronicle's estimate was
based on anticipated growth of
the 18 to 24-year-old population,
which has been dropping since
1977.
A few stragglers
Montoya said that although
the deadline for applications was
Dec. 16, his office is still receiving
a few applications from students
who live in foreign countries such
as Malaysia, or have had personal
problems like the death of a par
ent.
The admissions office isn't
meticulous in checking the post
marks of applications, Montoya
said. During the week after the
deadline, when Admissions
receives about 70 percent of the
applications, an application
mailed a day late "might slip

through" if it got here quickly, he
said.
According to Montoya, recom
mendations from teachers and
counselors "inevitably come in
after the deadline. We don't hold
that against the student." Howev
er, if student paperwork comes in
late, "our expectation is that
there will be an explanation," he
said.
In recent years the admissions
office has received several
requests from students who want
to fax their applications, but has
stuck to a "firm policy" of no
faxes, according to Associate
Dean of Admissions Bill Tingley.
"We like to see the originals,"
he said.
Of the 2,500 students offered
admission in 1991, 60 percent
enrolled.
