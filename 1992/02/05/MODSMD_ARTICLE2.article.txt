## Other top schools see increases

Applications for undergrad
uate admission at Stanford
dropped slightly while Har
vard, Princeton, Yale and other
universities all saw their appli
cant pools increase.
That development occurred
simultaneously with a nation
wide decline in high school
graduates.
According to Dean of
Admissions James Montoya,
13,406 applications had been
received by Feb. 1, compared
with 13,457 on the same date
last year. That total includes
148 applications awaiting
application fees or fee waiv
ers.
Applications are up, howev
er, at other private universities
across the United States â€”
including a 25 percent increase
in the number of applicants to
Rice University.
Montoya said he was "not
overly concerned" by the statis
tics and described Stanford as
"right in line with other
schools. If we were well below"
other competitive institutions

there would be cause for con
cern, he said.
Montoya stressed that Stan
ford's numbers are "way up"
from the 12,953 applications it
received in 1990-91.
He added that the quality of
the applicants has not declined.
"Based on the first three weeks
of an eight-week process, the
quality is truly exceptional," he
said.
Of other private universi
ties, Rice has seen the most
drastic increase, from 6,000
applications last year to about
7,500 this year, according to
Rice Dean of Admissions
Richard Stabell.
Stabell attributes the
increase to a Money Magazine
article that rated Rice as the
best buy in higher education.
He added that he expects the
leap to make admission to Rice
more selective.
Yale's applications have
risen 2 percent from last year,
according to Director of Under
graduate Admissions Margit
Dahl. Yale had received 10,945
