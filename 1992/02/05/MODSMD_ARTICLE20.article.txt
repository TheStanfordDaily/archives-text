Community members respond strongly to incident at Otero

Charges about Otero
RF completely false

Last Friday evening, a message
appeared on the lobby board of my
[dorm — "Otero: emergency meeting —
6 p.m.] At the meeting, we were fore
warned of the article that was to appear
on the front page of The Daily on Mon
day. Dennis Matthies, our resident fel
low, wanted us to know about the inci
dent, pre-press, as such incidents had
gained national attention in years past.
Having so far experienced only a
cohesive community at Stanford, I was
astonished to hear that there was a stu
dent who wanted to harass Otero and
our RF. When I read the article, I was
even more surprised to learn that the
student seemed proud at having made
himself so prominently antagonistic.
I would like to answer some of the
charges made by Keith Rabois. He claims
that "people are always complaining about
there being a very regimented orthodoxy
about what you are allowed to say in Otero
... Dennis gets away with intimidating an
entire dorm of freshmen every year." I
would like to know who these "people"
are. Surely not anyone from Otero.
As a resident of Otero, I find no such

restriction. Dennis has always encouraged
us to speak our minds. If we say some
thing about a hot issue, Dennis, a resident
assistant or a fellow Oteran may challenge
us to support our views. But that is a
challenge that I expect, desire and wel
come in a university environment.
Unfortunately, there is a difference
between the challenge we have inside
Otero and the kind of challenge that
occurred outside of Dennis' cottage a few
nights ago.
It is fine to have differing opinions,
but there is no need to present these
opinions in a way that upsets the com
munity. If Keith Rabois feels the need to
express his feelings, how about an intel
ligent discussion rather than personal
insults hurled at a man who is not even
there to defend himself?
As for the charges against Dennis, I
feel anything but intimidated around
him. He is one person with whom I feel I
can discuss my thoughts on most any
topic. Dennis is like a springboard of
ideas, and I feel that if I wanted to
examine an issue to the fullest he would
be a great source of perspectives.
Dennis has handled the past few
political heat waves with the utmost
integrity and maturity, which is more
than I can say for a few who practically
brag about screaming death wishes at an

established faculty member.
Despite all of the potential stigma
that may come of this incident, I
wouldn't trade in my dorm or my RF for
any other on campus.

Freshman, undeclared
Gays should not all
be grouped together
I am greatly dismayed that first-year
law student Keith Rabois would assert
in an article appearing in the Monday
issue of The Daily that "faggots are bad
in general." This faggot, for one, has
always strived to be bad with distinction.
That we faggots have failed miserably
in our outreach to the homophobic com
munity is made clear by Mr. Rabois's
assertion.
Bigots like him obviously haven't been
made to understand that the various
deviants who they so blindly group togeth
er under the blanket term "faggots" really
form a diverse community, each segment
with its own sins and perversions.
The faggot writing this letter, for
example, is guilty of trying to sway peo
ple with this tormented view that gays

are just people, and like everybody else
deserve some basic human respect.
He occasionally submits opinions to The
Daily making fun of idiots like Mr. Rabois
toward this end, using the aforementioned
homophobe as a foil for other to see what
shit society places upon us queers.
I deeply resent having my particular
evil being lumped together with those of
fags who spend their lives working to get
teenage prostitutes off the street after
their folks kicked them out of the house
for being gay, or playing martyr to the
straight community by teaching them
what we gays learned years ago about
AIDS and safer sex, or not being too ter
ribly gay-active but leading a quiet boy
next-door kind of lifestyle.
Not that I don't respect the individu
als I know who are doing each of these,
but I want to stress their virtues and
mine are quite different.
We faggots cannot be grouped togeth
er any more easily than could the entire
ty of hets (gay slang for you straight
people), and maybe in considering us
faggots as a diverse group with individu
al sympathies and devotions, Mr. Rabois
may come to realize that before he can
dismiss us as generally bad he has to
realize the bit of worth in each of us.

Rabois' remarks not
true, say dorm residents
As student residents of Otero House,
we find the remarks made by Keith
Rabois in Monday's Daily concerning
our Resident Fellow Dennis Matthies
and the issue of free speech in our dorm
to be untrue. Contrary to Rabois's asser
tions, we do not feel in the least intimi
dated by Dennis.
While his opinions are valued, they
are by no means the last word on affairs
within the dorm. He respects our right
to act independently, as in the case of
this letter.
Rabois further claimed that "people
are always complaining about there
being a very regimented orthodoxy
about what you're allowed to say" in
Otero. We have not heard any such com
plaints peculiar to Otero, other than
Rabois'.
While we may disagree on many
issues, on this we agree: we reject Rabois'
right to speak on behalf of the residents
of this dorm, as his statements demon
strate his ignorance of current conditions
in Otero and of our own opinions.
