## Top managers' salaries among nation's highest 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Eldon Speed and Philip Chiara
monte, the Stanford Bookstore's top
two managers, have a host of
perquisites at their disposal: top-of-the
line automobiles, a vacation home, a
Holiday Rambler motor home, a hot tub
and a sailboat — all paid for by the
Bookstore.
Even without the perquisites, how
ever, Speed, the store's general manag
er, and Chiaramonte, its assistant
manager, appear to be among the best
paid college bookstore managers in the
country. As of two years ago, Speed's
base salary was $112,500, according to
the Bookstore's 1989-90 tax return,
the latest such return the Bookstore
has filed with the Internal Revenue
Service.
Chiaramonte was making $102,500
at the time, according to the return.
In an interview, Speed declined to
disclose his current salary. But if past
years' increases are any indication, he
is likely making close to $130,000 this
year.
"Wish it were so," Speed said when
presented with the $130,000 figure.
Whatever the precise amount,
Speed's salary is clearly among the
highest, if not the highest, in the college
bookstore business. According to a sur
vey conducted by the National Associa
tion of College Stores, only a handful of
college store general managers in the
country were making more than
$72,000 as of Jan. 1, 1991.
Of the 59 stores surveyed with sales
volume greater than $6 million, only
five of the stores' highest-paid man
agers were making more than $72,000,
according to the survey, which had a 60
percent response rate, says Steve John
son of the National Association of Col
lege Stores.
The trade association's findings are
consistent with those of a less formal
survey of the largest stores in the
industry conducted by The Daily. None
of the managers contacted by The Daily
reported making more than $110,000 a
year.
Manager since 1971
Undoubtedly, two reasons for the
size of Speed's and Chiaramonte's
salaries are their seniority and the
sheer magnitude of the operation they
oversee. Both have been managers at
the Bookstore for more than 20 years.
Speed was named general manager in
1971 and had previously worked as
manager of the Brigham Young Univer
sity bookstore.
In addition to running the main

campus store in White Plaza, the Stan
ford Bookstore also runs the Track
House, which sells athletic clothing,
and Tresidder Express, a convenience
store located in Tresidder Union.
In recent years, the Bookstore has
also capitalized a for-profit subsidiary
called SBI Affiliates. The subsidiary,
which is separately incorporated and
has its own set of officers and directors,
runs the Stanford Bookstore Palo Alto,
which provides medical and technical
texts; the University Shop, which sells
Stanford clothing and souvenirs in the
Stanford Shopping Center; and a half
dozen small community college book
stores in the Bay Area and southern
California.
Last year, the consolidated sales of
the Bookstore and its subsidiary
reached $38.9 million, according to fig
ures the store provided to Dun & Brad
street, the firm that supplies credit
information on most U.S. businesses.
Based on sales volume, the Book
store is without question one of the
largest college stores in the nation. But
conversations with managers at the
other largest stores suggest that Stan
ford is unique when it comes to offering
perquisites.
'Nothing for personal use'
In fact, the only other bookstore The
Daily came across at which any of the
managers has use of a bookstore auto
mobile is the University of Washington,
which has annual sales of about $40
million, roughly the same as the Stan
ford Bookstore.
Robert Cross, the store's general
manager for the last 18 years, is provid
ed with a bookstore van to drive to and
from work, he says, but during the day,
the same van is used to make store
deliveries. No other managers at his
store have use of bookstore vehicles,
says Cross, who wouldn't disclose his
precise salary, but said it was in the
range of $90,000 to $100,000.
At Harvard's campus store, The
Coop, none of the managers has a book
store automobile. "We don't have any
cars," says Alex Arnold, the assistant to
the store's president. "In fact, we have

nothing for personal use."
Like the Stanford Bookstore, The
Coop is a nonprofit entity. The store
serves both Harvard and MIT, and sales
run about $64 million a year, according
to Arnold.
At the UCLA bookstore, where sales
are close to $54 million, and at the Uni
versity of Southern California book
store, where sales are around $35 mil
lion, none of the managers is provided
with a car or use of vacation facilities
either.
The idea of college bookstores pro
viding vehicles and vacation facilities to
its employees startled many of those in
the bookstore industry questioned by
The Daily. "Oh, gosh, no," said Pam
Horton, the manager of the Rice Uni
versity Bookstore, when asked about
providing vehicles to her employees.
"What land do you come from?"
"People in the (college bookstore)
industry tend to be underpaid," says
Johnson, who conducted the survey for
the National Association of College
Stores. "They're easily equatable with
the image of librarians. The word 'perk'
is not even appropriate for the indus
try."
'An uninteresting argument'
History Prof. Peter Stansky, presi
dent of the Stanford Bookstore's board
of directors, says he finds the compari
son to other stores "uninteresting."
"I don't find it an interesting argu
ment," Stansky says."I think Stanford
should do what's best for itself and
what best serves the community."
For years, the Bookstore, in accor
dance with its nonprofit status, has
pursued a policy of issuing rebates to
students and faculty. The store
returned $294,664 in fiscal year 1989-
90, according to its tax return. Under
law, the rest of the Bookstore's earn
ings should be reinvested into the store.
"The Bookstore," Stansky says, "has
pursued a very generous policy in terms
of rebates. The Bookstore shares its
affluence with the community."
