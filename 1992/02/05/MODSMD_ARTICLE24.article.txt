## Babies in Netland Teens in pro tennis lose out on life 
### 
At 20 years old, tennis pro
Jonathon Stark is one of
the most senior rookies on
the tour. The ex-Stanford star is
back in town for the Volvo Ten
nis Championships and took
some time to visit old friends and
relate stories from the world of
professional tennis, most of them
relating to his immature peers.

Now 20 is not a seasoned age
in any real sense, (you can't buy
beer yet and in everyone's eyes
you are closer to a teenager than
anything else), but in tennis, it
is practically middle-aged. With
peers like 15-year old Jennifer
Capriati and 19-year old Michael
Chang, it is easy to see why two
decades of life might seem fairly
significant. In tennis years
Stark is old, but he is wise as
well. Twenty might be viewed as
a late start for a pro, but Stark
likes the way things have
worked out.
"These people, some of them
haven't even gotten the chance to
go to high school," Stark said last
week as he lounged around the
SAE house, his old residence.
"They are great tennis players,
but they haven't gotten the
chance to lead normal lives. At
least I got to go to high school
with my friends and have a few
years of college."
What Stark was saying so
diplomatically was that these
people are lacking in the social
skills department. Of course,
what do you expect? These kids
live and breathe the game start
ing from some ungodly young
age, and with the urging of their
overbearing parents, they
embark on a professional career.
Life becomes sport and sport
becomes life. Capriati is a great
example. She hit the pro tour at
the same time she hit puberty
and now her life is the game.
Sure she smiles and seems happy
during the commercials and
interviews, but it must be hard
when the people that would be
your idols are instead your

equals.
She is just a kid. We give her
greater stature because we see
her on television at Wimbledon
and the U.S. Open, but at the
root of it all she is still a little girl.
But Capriati is not alone in
her struggles. We in the States
hear of teenagers going pro all
the time, but compared to the
international situation, the
U.S.A is a bastion of athletic
patience. African, European
and Asian countries do not
have the collegiate sports sys
tem that we in America enjoy,
so for many there is only one
option. Some South African kid
turns pro as soon as possible,
and if he happens to burn out
at 25, well, sucks for him. The
person is probably unprepared
for life without tennis, but
that's the breaks, and everyone
knows it.
Stark, on the other hand,
could probably handle it if his pro
career turns out to be a short
one. He can always come back to
school, and has led enough of an
ordinary life to realize that ten
nis is not the only reason he was
put on this earth. More impor
tantly, Stark would be able to
deal with his situation because he
has done tennis on his terms, in a
manner that comes about as
close to normal as any pro tennis
player can these days. Stanford
has given Jonathon Stark the
life-skills that will carry him far
within and without the world of
professional athletics.
Not so for a guy like Pete Sam
pras. He turns pro at an early age
and wins the Open at 19, but is
he socially competent to deal
with his peers? Not really.
"I've played this guy in the
juniors for years, known him for
years, but when he passes by me
he says, 'Hey champ,' and
doesn't even look me in the
eyes," Stark said. "I mean what's
up with that?"
What is up is that all the U.S.
Open titles in the world won't
provide social graces. Stark may
have waited longer to start mak
ing money with his racket, but
the time was well spent. In a pro
fession infused with children,
Jonathon Stark is a 20-year-old
model of maturity.

Chip Hall is a senior history
major who is happy that Stark
beat Patrick Baur 6-3,4-6, 6-3
yesterday to make it to the second
round of the Volvo.
