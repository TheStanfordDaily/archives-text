# Flanagan fighting his way to top
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
No one expected Michael
Flanagan to reach the semifinals
of the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate

Championships last October.
After all, he hadn't even quali
fied.
Because he hadn't qualified,
Stanford would not pay for the
sophomore's trip to Austin,

where the tournament was held.
So he used his own frequent
flyer ticket and bunked up with
his sister, who was going to
school in Austin. After winning
four matches to secure a spot in
the official draw, he was allowed
to move into the tournament
hotel and Stanford paid for his
return flight.
"I thought I'd lose in the first
or second round," Flanagan
recalled. But he didn't. He went
on to defeat eighth-seeded Albert
Chang and several others en
route to a semifinal showdown
with David DiLucia, the No. 2-
ranked player in the nation.
The Notre Dame senior beat
Flanagan 6-1, 7-6 before losing
in the finals to Stanford's Alex
O'Brien.
Flanagan, a Texas native, had
mixed feelings about performing
so successfully. "I was real
happy to make it that far, but if
I'd have lost I could've gone
home that weekend."
His performance garnered
him a No. 12 national collegiate
ranking. "I'd never done that
well at the college level," Flana
gan said. As a freshman, Flana
gan started at the four, five and
six singles spots. This in itself
was quite an accomplishment
because last year's freshman
class had 10 of the nation's top
tennis recruits.
Although the team lost big
guns Jon Stark and Jared
Palmer to the professional tour
last spring, Flanagan feels that
this year's less experienced team
can be equally competitive.
"There are a lot of guys who
didn't start last year, but I think
we're tougher mentally because
everyone has had to fight real
hard to get where they are.
Maybe we don't have the talent
but we'll do just as well," he said.
Flanagan, however, has the
talent. He's been a natural from
the beginning. When he was
eight years old, his older brother
and two sisters went to summer
camp but little Michael had
nothing to do, so his parents
enrolled him in ,a swimming and
tennis camp.
"I won the first few tourna
ments I was in, so I thought it
was pretty fun," Flanagan said
with a chuckle. Although he
opted to stay in a local private
school rather than enrolling in a
full-time tennis academy, his
professional aspirations did not

fade.
"My dad's excited but my
mom is worried that I'll turn
pro," Flanagan said. "She
always says, 'Remember you're
[at Stanford J to get an educa
tion.' It's good though because it
brings me down to Earth."
Getting an education is
always wise advice in the risky
world of professional athletics. A
nagging wrist injury is giving
Flanagan a taste of one of the
perils of professional tennis.
"I've never had an injury that's
kept me out of anything. This is
a new experience," Flanagan
said.
"I was having a great fall and
then I got hurt over winter
break from playing too much.
It's been difficult (this quarter)
with everyone on the road and
me having to stay at home."
Flanagan has been living with
his teammates, both on the road
and on the Farm, since last
spring. He played satellite tour
naments in the Midwest and
roomed with teammates Chris
Cocotos and Robert Devens all
summer before moving into a
fraternity house with five of the
other nine members of the ten
nis team this fall.
"To play all day with them
and then come home and eat
with them is kind of tiresome at
times," Flanagan said. "But it
also makes us closer and helps
us as a team in the long run."
Today he will once again head
to the Midwest with Devens to
compete in the Rolex National
Indoor Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships in Minneapolis,
Minn. By reaching the Volvo
Tournament's semifinals in
October, Flanagan automatical
ly qualified for the singles draw.
He teamed up with Devens in
the Rolex Regional Tournament
in November where the tandem
qualified in doubles play.
After an exhausting three and
a half hour match on Friday
gave his wrist some heavy wear
and tear, Flanagan has been
wearing a brace in practice. His
doctors have "jßQpt of given him
the okay to play and see what
happens," according to assistant
coach John Whitlinger.
Despite injury, Flanagan has
come a long way since last fall.
This time around, whether he
wins or loses, he can stay in the
tournament hotel, all expenses
paid.

him a No. 12 national collegiate
ranking. "I'd never done that
well at the college level," Flana
gan said. As a freshman, Flana
gan started at the four, five and
six singles spots. This in itself
was quite an accomplishment
because last year's freshman
class had 10 of the nation's top
tennis recruits.
Although the team lost big
guns Jon Stark and Jared
Palmer to the professional tour
last spring, Flanagan feels that
this year's less experienced team
can be equally competitive.
"There are a lot of guys who
didn't start last year, but I think
we're tougher mentally because
everyone has had to fight real
hard to get where they are.
Maybe we don't have the talent
but we'll do just as well," he said.
Flanagan, however, has the
talent. He's been a natural from
the beginning. When he was
eight years old, his older brother
and two sisters went to summer
camp but little Michael had
nothing to do, so his parents
enrolled him in ,a swimming and
tennis camp.
"I won the first few tourna
ments I was in, so I thought it
was pretty fun," Flanagan said
with a chuckle. Although he
opted to stay in a local private
school rather than enrolling in a
full-time tennis academy, his
professional aspirations did not

fade.
"My dad's excited but my
mom is worried that I'll turn
pro," Flanagan said. "She
always says, 'Remember you're
[at Stanford J to get an educa
tion.' It's good though because it
brings me down to Earth."
Getting an education is
always wise advice in the risky
world of professional athletics. A
nagging wrist injury is giving
Flanagan a taste of one of the
perils of professional tennis.
"I've never had an injury that's
kept me out of anything. This is
a new experience," Flanagan
said.
"I was having a great fall and
then I got hurt over winter
break from playing too much.
It's been difficult (this quarter)
with everyone on the road and
me having to stay at home."
Flanagan has been living with
his teammates, both on the road
and on the Farm, since last
spring. He played satellite tour
naments in the Midwest and
roomed with teammates Chris
Cocotos and Robert Devens all
summer before moving into a
fraternity house with five of the
other nine members of the ten
nis team this fall.
"To play all day with them
and then come home and eat
with them is kind of tiresome at
times," Flanagan said. "But it
also makes us closer and helps
us as a team in the long run."
Today he will once again head
to the Midwest with Devens to
compete in the Rolex National
Indoor Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships in Minneapolis,
Minn. By reaching the Volvo
Tournament's semifinals in
October, Flanagan automatical
ly qualified for the singles draw.
He teamed up with Devens in
the Rolex Regional Tournament
in November where the tandem
qualified in doubles play.
After an exhausting three and
a half hour match on Friday
gave his wrist some heavy wear
and tear, Flanagan has been
wearing a brace in practice. His
doctors have "jßQpt of given him
the okay to play and see what
happens," according to assistant
coach John Whitlinger.
Despite injury, Flanagan has
come a long way since last fall.
This time around, whether he
wins or loses, he can stay in the
tournament hotel, all expenses
paid.

Sophomore Michael Flanagan serves one up at the 1991 NCAA
Championships in Athens, Ga. After battling for a starting slot his
entire freshman year, Flanagan has already risen this season to
No. 12 in the national collegiate rankings.
No one expected Michael
Flanagan to reach the semifinals
of the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate

Championships last October.
After all, he hadn't even quali
fied.
Because he hadn't qualified,
Stanford would not pay for the
sophomore's trip to Austin,

where the tournament was held.
So he used his own frequent
flyer ticket and bunked up with
his sister, who was going to
school in Austin. After winning
four matches to secure a spot in
the official draw, he was allowed
to move into the tournament
hotel and Stanford paid for his
return flight.
"I thought I'd lose in the first
or second round," Flanagan
recalled. But he didn't. He went
on to defeat eighth-seeded Albert
Chang and several others en
route to a semifinal showdown
with David DiLucia, the No. 2-
ranked player in the nation.
The Notre Dame senior beat
Flanagan 6-1, 7-6 before losing
in the finals to Stanford's Alex
O'Brien.
Flanagan, a Texas native, had
mixed feelings about performing
so successfully. "I was real
happy to make it that far, but if
I'd have lost I could've gone
home that weekend."
His performance garnered
him a No. 12 national collegiate
ranking. "I'd never done that
