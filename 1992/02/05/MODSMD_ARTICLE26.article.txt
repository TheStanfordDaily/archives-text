# Cardinal nine host Sacramento St.
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Could revenge play a factor in a
game so early in the season? Perhaps
so, considering the opponent. The No.
10 ranked Cardinal will take on the
Sacramento State Hornets today at
2:00 p.m. What could make Stanford
want to beat Sacramento State so
badly?
Let us go back in time to February
19, 1991. The Stanford baseball team
is 13-2, on a six game winning streak,
and gearing up for Six-Pac play which
will begin the following weekend. So,
on a sunny Wednesday afternoon at
Sunken Diamond, the Cardinal takes
on unheralded Sacramento State —
surely a winnable game.
Sure, it started out great. David
McCarty belted a couple of homers,
Jamie Sepeda and Aaron Dorlarque
looked indominable, and after seven
innings of play, the score stood at 10-2
in favor of Stanford. Everyone started
heading for home — the retired folk
who keep the meticulous scorecards,

the little kids that chase breathlessly
after every foul ball, the loud football
players that sit on that bench in the
student section — everyone. After all
the game was over, right?
Wrong. Unbelievably timely Hornet
hitting along with some creative relief
pitching on behalf of the Cardinal saw
to that. In the top of the eighth the
Hornets scored four runs. The top of
the ninth, six more. The final score:
12-10, Sacramento State.
"Obviously it was a tough game to
lose," said coach Mark Marquess after
the game. "When you've got an eight

run lead in the eighth inning and you
just can't finish it out, it's disappoint
ing."
But that's not the end of the story.
We jump ahead in time a little bit to
May 15; this time the two teams meet
in Sacramento. No. 9 ranked Stanford
is 36-19 and gearing up for the upcom
ing postseason. So, they face a game
against surprisingly good 39-22-1
Sacramento State — an ideal opportu
nity to get a little revenge for the ear
lier loss, and at the same time beat a
quality team to increase team confi
dence going into regionals, right?
Well, the best laid plans of mice and
men ... The Cardinal is up 8-6 in the
bottom of the eighth with Brian Sackin
sky on the mound. Runners on first and
second, two outs. Sackinsky rears back
and sends a 2-2 fastball to the plate. In
response, the Hornet batter promptly
returns the ball — over the right field
fence. The Cardinal loses 9-8.
And today, the 3-1 Cardinal will
face the Hornets in an effort to dispel
any notion that Sacramento State may
have the Cardinal's number.
