# Rugby to take on Weenies
## 
### Trevor Brown 
In 1906 the rivalry between Stanford
and Cal began with the first Big Game. But
this Big Game was different than the
familiar gridiron wars of today. This Big
Game was fought on the rugby field. Fri
day night, February 7, the fire between the
crossbay rugby rivals will be rekindled as
Cal and Stanford clash at Kezar Stadium
in the rugby Big Game.
Once a very popular game in the United
States, rugby has become a cult sport played
mainly at the collegiate and club levels.
Promoters around the bay are looking
to catch this wave and increase attendance
at rugby games. "We're pushing to bring
rugby to a new level in this country. We
think the college game is going to take us
to that level," explained promoter Rennie
O'Brien.
O'Brien has picked Kezar Stadium as
the arena for these heavily promoted
matches. Up to this point the matches at
Kezar have been played by men's club
sides. The Stanford and Cal rugby teams
have been honored with the first invitation
to a collegiate side.
"This stadium 1 Kezar I is virtually made
for rugby and this is a great rivalry. You've

got the two best teams in the conference
going for it under the lights in front of a
large crowd. And hey, on any given day,
any team could win," stated O'Brien.
But Stanford is facing an arduous task.
Cal is the reigning national champ and
soundly defeated Stanford in the finals of
last year's Pacific Coast playoffs. "These
guys are tough, real tough. But we're going
to play hard. There are going to be bodies
flying left and right," captain John Hamil
ton said.
Cal is an impressive and dominating
squad, but Stanford thinks it has the strat
egy for victory. "This team (Stanford) has
great athletes â€” big, strong, and fast. And
we can beat every team in the conference
on these things alone. But to beat Cal we
need teamwork. Everytime one guy touch
es the ball he's got to know that 14 guys are
there to support him," Brent Keltner said.
"We've got to hold onto the ball and play
our game. We've got to go back to the fun
damentals. Maintain control of the ball by
only making good passes and backing up the
carrier of the ball," Franck Boivert said.
Play begins at Kezar Stadium at 6:30
PM when club sides Monterey and Golden-
Gate compete. The featured Cal-Stanford
match of begins at 8:00 p.m.
