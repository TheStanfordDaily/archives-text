### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
With an occasional breeze blowing
and the sun gleaming off the stands,
the Stanford women's tennis team
stormed past Fresno State 9-0 yester
day. On a perfect day for tennis, the
Cardinal raised its record to 4-0.
Junior Heather Willens spent a lot
of time on the court, not soaking up
rays, but embroiled in a battle with the
Bulldogs' Mary Fallara at No. 1.
Willens dominated the match in the
beginning 6-1, but her Fresno State
opponent came back. Fallara's hard,
flat groundstrokes — which sprayed
out in the first set — started hitting
lines and corners.
"In the first set [Fallara] the
error by the third shot," said Lele
Forood, Stanford assistant women's
tennis coach. "That happens so much,

you win easily in the first set and they
get better in the second."
With Willens down 0-3 in the second
set, Forood began counseling her on
changeovers. "I told her she needed to
mix up her shots a little more because
[Fallara] was really giving her a hard
time in a toe-to-toe slugfest."
However, Fallara kept Willens off
balance and won the set 6-2. The Cardi
nal's top-ranked player turned the
tables in the third stanza, moving her
Fresno State opponent around the
court.
With Fallara serving at 3-5 Willens
had a chance to close out the match.
She sneaked to net behind a topspin
lob to Fallara's backhand. However,
she netted a high forehand volley off
the return. Fallara then double faulted
twice in a row to end the contest.
The rest of the matches were not as
long or as close. Kylie Johnson led the

stampede off the courts with a 6-0, 6-0
double-bagel of Karen Farquhar at No.
3 singles. Copying the shutout, Mario
Carruth continued her solid play at No.
6 against Gina Serrano.
In No. 2 singles Laxmi Poruri used
an impressive variety of weapons to
crush Amy Gallagher 6-1, 6-1. Poruri
kept Gallagher off balance with explo
sive groundstrokes, delicate drop
shots, and well-placed topspin lobs.
Emma Woodhouse cruised past
Kristy Smith in the No. 4 slot. The
Cardinal sophomore overpowered her

opponent from the baseline, and occa
sionally came in to finish a point at net.
In Amy Chiminello's last two
matches she was pushed to 7-6 in the
first set before closing the door on her
adversaries. The freshman escaped the
tiebreaker-in-the-first-set rut by
steamrolling Patricia Marosova 6-2, 6-
1 in No. 5 singles.
Willens and Poruri won 6-0, 6-2 in
the top doubles match against Fallara
and Gallagher. Kylie Johnson and
Emma Woodhouse blanked Farquhar
and Smith 6-0, 6-0. The shutout made
Johnson the only double-double-bagel
victor of the day.
In No. 3 doubles, Chiminello and
Carruth beat Marosova and Kim Kubar
6-1, 6-1. "They are playing well togeth
er," said Cardinal coach Frank Bren
nan. "A lot of teams have a drop (in abil
ity) here. We're fortunate that we have
such a reliable team playing at No. 3."
