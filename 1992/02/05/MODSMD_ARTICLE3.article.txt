# Campus in Florence faces major changes
## 
### Anush Yegyazarian 
Students who attend Stanford
in-Florence will be faced with
three required quarters of Italian,
harder classes and stronger ties
between their Stanford studies
and their Florence plans, accord
ing to Director of Overseas Stud
ies Tom Heller.
An additional prerequisite
course in Italian culture may also
be either required or strongly
encouraged, Heller said.
In addition, he said the num
ber of students accepted will drop
to between 15 and 25 from the
current 30 to 40. The spring
quarter program will be eliminat
ed and students will be encour
aged to attend both fall and win
ter quarters.
The changes, to go into effect

for the 1993-94 academic year,
were prompted by both a recent re
evaluation and a $488,000 Over
seas Studies budget cut, according
to Education Prof. Hans Weiler,
chair of a faculty senate committee
studying how to change overseas
programs.
"A main reason to be in Flo
rence ip the access to resources to
try and understand the history of
art, architecture, political philos
ophy, new ideas in design. . .. The
point of the new program is to try
and take advantage of that,"
Heller said.
"To take full advantage of the
resources in Florence takes lan
guage skill. We'll be improving
the language courses here and
trying to raise the levels there,"
he added.
In order to link students' work
at Stanford to that in Florence,
Heller said, the program's faculty
will be teaching tutorials and
directing more research projects.
Weiler said that in evaluating
all overseas programs, the com
mittee compared their academic
levels to Stanford's level, consid
ered whether there was enough
support for them at Stanford and
determined whether there are
enough academic and cultural
resources and important changes
going on at the program's loca
tion.
Heller said the evaluators also
tried to make sure that overseas
programs offer balanced opportu
nities to all majors, like the pro
gram for engineers in Kyoto.
Weiler said that according to
the evaluations, the Florence pro
gram wasn't as strong as some of
the others.
"There was a long discussion
on whether we should close it
entirely, but we decided that the
program as a whole is good. Stan
ford doesn't have as many other
opportunities to get a cross-cul
tural experience as rich as Flo
rence. So we are giving Florence
and the Italian department a
chance to mount a program there
of higher quality," he said.
According to Janet Schmidt,
assistant director for academic
programs at Overseas Studies,
the Florence center will most like
ly have to be relocated within the
city because of budget cuts.

Geoffrey Jones, a senior who
spent two quarters in Florence
last year, said he has mixed feel
ings about the new requirements.
"I think that the three quar
ters (of Italian) is good. Some peo
ple got there without being able to
say a word, and it would have
helped to have more training,"
Jones said.
Still, "for most people, the real
learning is getting to know the
family (you stay with), meeting
new people and travelling," all of
which require time away from
academics, he said.
Senior Chris McKenna, who
spent a quarter in Florence last
year, added, "When you go, the
point is to immerse yourself in the
culture. How can you do that with
the same course-load as (at) Stan
ford?"
Prof. Carolyn Springer, acting
vice chair of the Italian Depart
ment, disagreed.
"We'll just reach a new and
more serious clientele. I think
there will be a steady demand for
Florence. Florence is a precious
resource. .. . The additional
course load would not be a bur
den," she said.
According to Heller, "The area
around Florence — Tuscany — is
beautiful. We're not asking stu
dents to be locked away in a room
24 hours a day. But there's a
chance to get in deep, and if you
have a background going in,
you're that many steps ahead. . . .
Academic understanding can help
students interpret what's going
on.
McKenna said he was con
cerned that "some students have
a really demanding schedule. One
of the great things about the pro

gram was the diversity of the peo
ple there. If you raise the require
ments, then someone in engineer
ing, with a lot of classes, might
not be able to go."
George Trone, an Italian major
who spent all of last year in Flo
rence and also sat on the panel
reviewing the Mediterranean
campuses, said one of the prob
lems with the Florence program
now is its generality.
"It's a good thing to have a stu
dent body specially interested in
the humanities and Italy. Espe
cially with the budget cuts, the
University can't sustain a general
program," he said.
In two years, the program will
be re-evaluated based on student
interest and the success of the
academic revision and officials
will decide whether to keep it
open, Heller said.
Several people stressed that
they are concerned that there will
not be enough interest in the
revised program.
Dina Viggiano, a senior lec
turer in Italian and the resident
fellow at Casa Italiana, said,
"The problem might be the
morale of the students. The
quality of the education can be
improved, but if students feel a
lack of security or all-around
approval" from the University
they may not apply.
"There's a sense that the cam
pus was given [a reprieve] as a
kind of placebo, with the impend
ing sentence in two years," she
said.
"The exposure to culture is of
greatest value to the students,
and you can't ignore the culture
and civilization that Florence can
provide," she said.

"There was a long discussion
on whether we should close it
entirely, but we decided that the
program as a whole is good. Stan
ford doesn't have as many other
opportunities to get a cross-cul
tural experience as rich as Flo
rence. So we are giving Florence
and the Italian department a
chance to mount a program there
of higher quality," he said.
According to Janet Schmidt,
assistant director for academic
programs at Overseas Studies,
the Florence center will most like
ly have to be relocated within the
city because of budget cuts.

Geoffrey Jones, a senior who
spent two quarters in Florence
last year, said he has mixed feel
ings about the new requirements.
"I think that the three quar
ters (of Italian) is good. Some peo
ple got there without being able to
say a word, and it would have
helped to have more training,"
Jones said.
Still, "for most people, the real
learning is getting to know the
family (you stay with), meeting
new people and travelling," all of
which require time away from
academics, he said.
Senior Chris McKenna, who
spent a quarter in Florence last
year, added, "When you go, the
point is to immerse yourself in the
culture. How can you do that with
the same course-load as (at) Stan
ford?"
Prof. Carolyn Springer, acting
vice chair of the Italian Depart
ment, disagreed.
"We'll just reach a new and
more serious clientele. I think
there will be a steady demand for
Florence. Florence is a precious
resource. .. . The additional
course load would not be a bur
den," she said.
According to Heller, "The area
around Florence — Tuscany — is
beautiful. We're not asking stu
dents to be locked away in a room
24 hours a day. But there's a
chance to get in deep, and if you
have a background going in,
you're that many steps ahead. . . .
Academic understanding can help
students interpret what's going
on.
McKenna said he was con
cerned that "some students have
a really demanding schedule. One
of the great things about the pro

gram was the diversity of the peo
ple there. If you raise the require
ments, then someone in engineer
ing, with a lot of classes, might
not be able to go."
George Trone, an Italian major
who spent all of last year in Flo
rence and also sat on the panel
reviewing the Mediterranean
campuses, said one of the prob
lems with the Florence program
now is its generality.
"It's a good thing to have a stu
dent body specially interested in
the humanities and Italy. Espe
cially with the budget cuts, the
University can't sustain a general
program," he said.
In two years, the program will
be re-evaluated based on student
interest and the success of the
academic revision and officials
will decide whether to keep it
open, Heller said.
Several people stressed that
they are concerned that there will
not be enough interest in the
revised program.
Dina Viggiano, a senior lec
turer in Italian and the resident
fellow at Casa Italiana, said,
"The problem might be the
morale of the students. The
quality of the education can be
improved, but if students feel a
lack of security or all-around
approval" from the University
they may not apply.
"There's a sense that the cam
pus was given [a reprieve] as a
kind of placebo, with the impend
ing sentence in two years," she
said.
"The exposure to culture is of
greatest value to the students,
and you can't ignore the culture
and civilization that Florence can
provide," she said.
Students who attend Stanford
in-Florence will be faced with
three required quarters of Italian,
harder classes and stronger ties
between their Stanford studies
and their Florence plans, accord
ing to Director of Overseas Stud
ies Tom Heller.
An additional prerequisite
course in Italian culture may also
be either required or strongly
encouraged, Heller said.
In addition, he said the num
ber of students accepted will drop
to between 15 and 25 from the
current 30 to 40. The spring
quarter program will be eliminat
ed and students will be encour
aged to attend both fall and win
ter quarters.
The changes, to go into effect

for the 1993-94 academic year,
were prompted by both a recent re
evaluation and a $488,000 Over
seas Studies budget cut, according
to Education Prof. Hans Weiler,
chair of a faculty senate committee
studying how to change overseas
programs.
"A main reason to be in Flo
rence ip the access to resources to
try and understand the history of
art, architecture, political philos
ophy, new ideas in design. . .. The
point of the new program is to try
and take advantage of that,"
Heller said.
"To take full advantage of the
resources in Florence takes lan
guage skill. We'll be improving
the language courses here and
trying to raise the levels there,"
he added.
In order to link students' work
at Stanford to that in Florence,
Heller said, the program's faculty
will be teaching tutorials and
directing more research projects.
Weiler said that in evaluating
all overseas programs, the com
mittee compared their academic
levels to Stanford's level, consid
ered whether there was enough
support for them at Stanford and
determined whether there are
enough academic and cultural
resources and important changes
going on at the program's loca
tion.
Heller said the evaluators also
tried to make sure that overseas
programs offer balanced opportu
nities to all majors, like the pro
gram for engineers in Kyoto.
Weiler said that according to
the evaluations, the Florence pro
gram wasn't as strong as some of
the others.
"There was a long discussion
on whether we should close it
entirely, but we decided that the
program as a whole is good. Stan
