Students who attend Stanford
in-Florence will be faced with
three required quarters of Italian,
harder classes and stronger ties
between their Stanford studies
and their Florence plans, accord
ing to Director of Overseas Stud
ies Tom Heller.
An additional prerequisite
course in Italian culture may also
be either required or strongly
encouraged, Heller said.
In addition, he said the num
ber of students accepted will drop
to between 15 and 25 from the
current 30 to 40. The spring
quarter program will be eliminat
ed and students will be encour
aged to attend both fall and win
ter quarters.
The changes, to go into effect

for the 1993-94 academic year,
were prompted by both a recent re
evaluation and a $488,000 Over
seas Studies budget cut, according
to Education Prof. Hans Weiler,
chair of a faculty senate committee
studying how to change overseas
programs.
"A main reason to be in Flo
rence ip the access to resources to
try and understand the history of
art, architecture, political philos
ophy, new ideas in design. . .. The
point of the new program is to try
and take advantage of that,"
Heller said.
"To take full advantage of the
resources in Florence takes lan
guage skill. We'll be improving
the language courses here and
trying to raise the levels there,"
