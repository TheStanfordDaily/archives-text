## Migratory birds flock to PA Baylands for muddy feast 
### Liz Lempert Editorial staff 
Hungry, weary motorists often stop
at greasy spoons and gas stations for
relief from their travels. Birds also know
the importance of a good pit stop, and
the Palo Alto Baylands has become a
popular stopover for the millions of
feathered fliers that migrate over the
western states.
In the sumptuous mud of the salt
marsh lies one of the richest food chains
in the world, second only to the coral
reef. A veritable feast of bugs skitter
along the surface of the mud, and for
birds with beaks long enough to probe
deeper into the succulent soup there are
crabs, clams, mussels and worms.
What makes the Baylands such a rich
source of food is the golden, straw-like
cordgrass that dominates the marsh
along the edge of the bay.
"When the grass dies in the winter,
the tide grinds it up like a giant food
processor," explained naturalist Debo
rah Bartens, one of the guides who leads
tours of the Baylands. The resulting
puree, known affectionately as "Bay
soup," feeds the billions of microscopic
organisms living in the mud, which in
turn are eaten by bigger mud-dwellers.
Last Saturday morning, with galosh
es on her feet and a bucket and shovel in
hand, Bartens led a small group of visi
tors along the diked boardwalk, occa
sionally wading through knee-deep
muck in search of bugs, snails, clams
and the tiny animals they eat.
She also grabbed a fist-full of algae,
which shares with cordgrass the spot at
the bottom of the food chain. In the
summer months, when the algae blooms
and photosynthesizes, it converts the
sulfate in the water into sulfur, releas
ing putrid fumes. "The salt marsh really
smells in the summer — like a bunch of

rotten eggs," Bartens warned.
But since zooplankton have no sense
of smell, these small animals — tiny
crustaceans called copepods, miniature
shrimp, the larvae of fish, crabs, barna
cles and other creatures — happily
devour the algae and cordgrass.
Lucky scoops with the naturalist's
shovel may dig up oysters, clams and
worms, which feast on zooplankton,
algae and Bay soup. These animals lurk
in burrows, cling to rocks or lie embed
ded in the soft mud. They eat by pump
ing huge amounts of water through
their bodies or their burrows, filtering
out the plankton through their gills.
Inside the Nature Center's small lab
oratory, visitors can sift through their
muddy findings for signs of life and peer
at the Bay soup and algae through
microscopes.
The Nature Center also provides
information on the Salt Marsh Harvest
Mouse and the California Clapper Rail,
two endangered species common to the
Baylands.
The nocturnal harvest mouse feeds
on the stems of pickleweed, a plant
resembling a string of pickles. Despite
the mice, however, most of the pickle
weed dies uneaten, and like the cord
grass is attacked by decomposing bacte
ria and tides until it breaks down into a
nutritious soup.
A quiet, careful walk down the diked
boardwalk may afford several views of
the California Clapper Rail, a shy bird
that hides under the cordgrass. The
group on Saturday spotted four of these
birds. The best times to hear the clap
ping sounds made by the Clapper Rail
are early in the morning and evening
when low tides allow the birds to foray
out into the sloughs to feed on small
crabs, snails and worms.
Dinner, however, has its dangers.
Researchers have found Clapper Rails

with mus
sels attached to
their feet or with missing
toes.

Over 150 species of birds come to the
Baylands to feast on the life in the
muddy marsh. The size and shape of
their beaks determine how far down in
the mud they can probe and what they
can eat.
Avocets sweep the surface of the mud
for small clams with delicate swoops of
their beaks, while skittering plovers and
sandpipers peck for shallow insects,
shrimp and snails.
Dowitchers probe the middle depths
with a frantic, sewing-machine motion,
hoping to snatch up organisms that lie a
few inches under the mud. The deepest
foragers are the curlews, whose long,
downward-curving bills allow them to
grapple with burrowing worms eight

inch
es beneath
the surface.

The largest bird of the
Baylands is the great blue heron. It
stands about four feet high and has a
six-foot wingspan. Its long legs and long,
dagger-like bill allow it to stand in the
tidal ponds and catch fish.
Most of the guided tours offered by
the Baylands Nature Center start early
in the morning on Saturday and Sun
day. But late-sleepers are free to roam
the diked boardwalk on their own dur
ing daylight hours. The best time for
birdwatching is at high tide, when the
birds are forced out of the marsh.

The Bay
lands Nature Pre-

serve is located next to the

Palo Alto Airport at the east end

of Embarcadero Road. From the obser
vation platform on the edge of the San
Francisco Bay, visitors can watch the
small aircraft buzz over the feathered
flocks who stop by the Baylands to rest
and gather fuel for the long flight
ahead.

What makes the Baylands such a rich
source of food is the golden, straw-like
cordgrass that dominates the marsh
along the edge of the bay.
"When the grass dies in the winter,
the tide grinds it up like a giant food
processor," explained naturalist Debo
rah Bartens, one of the guides who leads
tours of the Baylands. The resulting
puree, known affectionately as "Bay
soup," feeds the billions of microscopic
organisms living in the mud, which in
turn are eaten by bigger mud-dwellers.
Last Saturday morning, with galosh
es on her feet and a bucket and shovel in
hand, Bartens led a small group of visi
tors along the diked boardwalk, occa
sionally wading through knee-deep
muck in search of bugs, snails, clams
and the tiny animals they eat.
She also grabbed a fist-full of algae,
which shares with cordgrass the spot at
the bottom of the food chain. In the
summer months, when the algae blooms
and photosynthesizes, it converts the
sulfate in the water into sulfur, releas
ing putrid fumes. "The salt marsh really
smells in the summer — like a bunch of

rotten eggs," Bartens warned.
But since zooplankton have no sense
of smell, these small animals — tiny
crustaceans called copepods, miniature
shrimp, the larvae of fish, crabs, barna
cles and other creatures — happily
devour the algae and cordgrass.
Lucky scoops with the naturalist's
shovel may dig up oysters, clams and
worms, which feast on zooplankton,
algae and Bay soup. These animals lurk
in burrows, cling to rocks or lie embed
ded in the soft mud. They eat by pump
ing huge amounts of water through
their bodies or their burrows, filtering
out the plankton through their gills.
Inside the Nature Center's small lab
oratory, visitors can sift through their
muddy findings for signs of life and peer
at the Bay soup and algae through
microscopes.
The Nature Center also provides
information on the Salt Marsh Harvest
Mouse and the California Clapper Rail,
two endangered species common to the
Baylands.
The nocturnal harvest mouse feeds
on the stems of pickleweed, a plant
resembling a string of pickles. Despite
the mice, however, most of the pickle
weed dies uneaten, and like the cord
grass is attacked by decomposing bacte
ria and tides until it breaks down into a
nutritious soup.
A quiet, careful walk down the diked
boardwalk may afford several views of
the California Clapper Rail, a shy bird
that hides under the cordgrass. The
group on Saturday spotted four of these
birds. The best times to hear the clap
ping sounds made by the Clapper Rail
are early in the morning and evening
when low tides allow the birds to foray
out into the sloughs to feed on small
crabs, snails and worms.
Dinner, however, has its dangers.
Researchers have found Clapper Rails

with mus
sels attached to
their feet or with missing
toes.

Over 150 species of birds come to the
Baylands to feast on the life in the
muddy marsh. The size and shape of
their beaks determine how far down in
the mud they can probe and what they
can eat.
Avocets sweep the surface of the mud
for small clams with delicate swoops of
their beaks, while skittering plovers and
sandpipers peck for shallow insects,
shrimp and snails.
Dowitchers probe the middle depths
with a frantic, sewing-machine motion,
hoping to snatch up organisms that lie a
few inches under the mud. The deepest
foragers are the curlews, whose long,
downward-curving bills allow them to
grapple with burrowing worms eight

inch
es beneath
the surface.

The largest bird of the
Baylands is the great blue heron. It
stands about four feet high and has a
six-foot wingspan. Its long legs and long,
dagger-like bill allow it to stand in the
tidal ponds and catch fish.
Most of the guided tours offered by
the Baylands Nature Center start early
in the morning on Saturday and Sun
day. But late-sleepers are free to roam
the diked boardwalk on their own dur
ing daylight hours. The best time for
birdwatching is at high tide, when the
birds are forced out of the marsh.

vation platform on the edge of the San
Francisco Bay, visitors can watch the

flocks who stop by the Baylands to rest
and gather fuel for the long flight
ahead.

Hungry, weary motorists often stop
at greasy spoons and gas stations for
relief from their travels. Birds also know
the importance of a good pit stop, and
the Palo Alto Baylands has become a
popular stopover for the millions of
feathered fliers that migrate over the
western states.
In the sumptuous mud of the salt
marsh lies one of the richest food chains
in the world, second only to the coral
reef. A veritable feast of bugs skitter
along the surface of the mud, and for
birds with beaks long enough to probe
deeper into the succulent soup there are
crabs, clams, mussels and worms.
