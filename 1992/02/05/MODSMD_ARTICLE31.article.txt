# Smokers not told to quit, study says
## Doctors refrain from warning patients about danger to lungs 
### Laura Stroud 
Doctors have responded favorably
to a study that encourages them to
take the initiative in helping their
patients stop smoking, according to
l)r. Erica Frank, co-author of the
study and a physician at the Stanford
Center for Research in Disease Pre
vention.
Only half of the smokers surveyed
in the study reported that their doc
tors had advised them to quit.
"It's time for everybody to wake up
and smell the smoke," Frank said.
The study, which recently appeared
in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, included the results from
five surveys conducted between 1979
and 1990. The 2710 subjects ranged in
age from 12 to 74 years old.
The researchers wrote that it is
incumbent upon physicians help their
smoking patients to quit because of the
influence of doctors over their patients.
"We're confident that more people
could quit with greater phyician
involvement both in terms of advice
and follow-up treatment," Frank said.
She added that the medical commu
nity understands that it needs to
change its ways. "Folks agree that this
is a tremendous problem," she said.
Dr. Robert Jamplice, a surgeon and
president of the Palo Alto Medical
Foundation, agreed with the study's
conclusions. "When a doctor tells you
I to stop smoking], it's a lot more force
ful than when it comes from your wife
or family."
Although other physicians agreed
with Frank and Jamplice, and with the
conclusions of the study, some said
they found telling patients to quit
smoking could be difficult in practice.
"In general, it is extremely impor
tant to encourage patients to stop
smoking, but you don't want to be
looked at as an annoyance or a nag,"
said Dr. Greg Colburn, a radiation
oncologist at the Palo Alto clinic who
treats lung cancer patients. "You have
to be on the patient's side. You don't
want to put them in a 'you're the
enemy' confrontation situation."
The study also reported that older
patients were encouraged to quit more
often than younger ones, despite the
fact that the younger group averaged

more office visits per year. Of the
smokers aged 50 to 74, 69 percent
reported being told to quit by their
doctors, while only 13.9 percent of
those aged 12 to 17 remembered being
counseled t<J stop smoking.
Frank suggested that doctors might

"i hope that this study will encourage doctors
to wake up and say 'Gee, I'm not doing a good
enough job,' and that it will encourage patients
to take the initiative to say to their doctors, 'I
know I ought to quit smoking — could you help
me?' "

be more likely to counsel longer-term
smokers.
She also said that physicians might
be leery of embarrassing children in
front of their parents.
"You can't go pushing stuff onto
kids. Kids get offended," said Dr. Louis
Zamvil, a pediatrician in Palo Alto and
pediatrics professor at the School of
Medicine. "You offend the parents
too."
Also, according to Frank, some doc
tors do not consider smoking to be a
problem in healthy adolescents, and
others may not have been aware that
their young patients were smoking.
"My doctor never even asked me if I
smoked," said one Stanford senior
who recently gave up cigarettes.
"My doctor knows that I smoke, but
he never really says anything," anoth
er senior said.
The study's authors suggest that
doctors should mention the impor
tance of quitting smoking at every
office visit. Frank and the other
authors also recommended that doc
tors schedule special office visits for
this purpose.
A potential bias in the study noted
by the authors was that some patients
may not have remembered their doc
tors telling them to quit. However,
the authors claim that even if this was

the case, "physicians should aim to be
so clear, memorable and repetitive in
their attempts to provide smoking
cessation advice that it is nearly
impossible for patients to forget or
deny counseling."
Besides Frank, other researchers

included Dr. David Altman, Dr.
Stephen Fortmann, Dr. Beverly Rock
hill, and Dr. Marilyn Winkleby, all
from the Stanford Center for Research
in Disease Prevention.
"I hope that this study will encour
age doctors to wake up and say 'Gee,
I'm not doing a good enough job,' and
that it will encourage patients to take
the initiative to say to their doctors, 'I
know I ought to quit smoking — could
you help me?' " said Frank.
"By the time I see them, it's usually
too late," said Colburn. "If we could get
everyone to quit smoking, there would
be an 80 percent decrease in the num
ber of lung cancers."
"Smoking is public health enemy
number one," said Jamplice. "If there's
one thing we can do it's to get patients
to stop smoking. All the rest of our
problems together are not as bad as
cigarettes."
The researchers also interviewed
1672 ex-smokers. Over 87 percent of
them said they quit on their own.
Another 9 percent cite the influences of
family and friends. Less than 4 percent
said their doctors helped them to quit.
The ex-smokers were permitted to
check off as many influences as applied.
The survey was taken of smokers
and non-smokers in four central Cali
fornia cities.
