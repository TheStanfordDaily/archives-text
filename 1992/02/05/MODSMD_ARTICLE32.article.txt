# Bug debunks razor myth
## Cut hair does not grow back thicker, faster 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
The mythological systems associate
hair with the instinctive and the primi
tive. What I'm suggesting, then, is that
every modern male has, lying at the bot
tom of his psyche, a large, primitive being
covered with hair down to his feet.

About Men"
Q. Is it true that if you cut hair it
• grows back faster?
- Bill Walsh
A. Of course it does! Everyone knows
• that as soon as you shave your legs,
armpit or upper lip, the hair comes back
with a vengeance — coarser, denser and
faster than before. Right?
Wrong.
Despite the popular misconception,
the probable source of which I will dis
cuss later, cutting and shaving cannot
stimulate hair growth. You see, hair
doesn't know whether it's been cut or
not because it's dead. Expired and gone
to meet its maker. Demised. Departed
and joined the choir invisible. If it
weren't attached to your skin, it would
be pushing up daisies.
The typical mammalian hair consists
of the shaft, which protrudes above the
skin, and the root, which grows from a
pit, or follicle, beneath the skin's surface.
Except for a few dividing cells at the very
base of the root, which both provide raw
material for new hair and hold the shaft
in place, the hair is dead tissue consisting
of keratin and related proteins.
Because a hair is no longer in the
realm of the living, there is no mecha
nism for signal transduction from the
shaft to the root. In layperson's terms,
the growing part of the hair doesn't
know how long the shaft is, so cutting
the shaft couldn't possibly cause the root
cells to divide any faster.
Body hair follicles, in contrast to head
and facial follicles, do indeed cycle
between a growing phase and a dormant
phase, but the duration of these phases
depends on the type of hair follicle in
question, not on the length of the product.
Incidentally, this growth-dormancy
cycle explains why body hair doesn't
grow to arbitrary lengths. At the end of a
follicle's growth phase, the hair's root
rigidifies and pulls away from the source
cells. When a new period of proliferation
begins, the new hair pushes the old hair
out of the follicle.
Thus, there is a biological limit on the
length of one's body hair. If there weren't,
then uncut armpit hair — which, like
other types of human hair, grows about
half an inch every month — would be
longer than our arms by the time we hit
twenty.
Although this may come as a disap
pointment to all you would-be Hairy Men
and Womyn out there, you can't fool
Mother Nature into giving you more
than you got, faster than you're already
getting it, by shaving or other trickery.
Now, to the controversial part. This
humble Bug will now speculate about the
source of the myth, which we will call the

Norelco Fallacy.
Confession: I, too, used to believe that
I could make my facial hair grow faster
by shaving. My evidence was straightfor
ward. Around the age of thirteen, I got
tired of the caterpillar-on-the-lip jokes
the cruel children used to aim at me. I
decided to take a blade to myself.
Sure enough, over the course of that
year, each month's new crop seemed
thicker and darker than the previous
month's harvest. I was becoming a man.
Had I known virile Stanford heartthrob
Joel Stein at the time, I would have fan
tasized that I would someday be like him.
And if someone had asked me whether
shaving made a mustache grow faster, I
would have responded with a lusty,
pubescent "You betcha!"
It was simple: I shaved. My hair grew
faster. Ergo, shaving accelerates hair
growth. Allow me to paraphrase. On a
cloudy day, I put up an umbrella. It
began to rain. Therefore, umbrellas
make it rain.
I think similar errors in the thought
processes of other early teenagers have led
to the propagation of the Norelco fallacy.
The time when most men (and women,
for that matter) begin shaving is right
around puberty — which is also when
body hair starts to come in denser and
faster. Our society has fallen victim to a
confusion of correlation with causation.
Other factors lending credibility to the
Norelco fallacy include the (quite accu
rate) observation made by many women
that leg stubble is scratchy and coarse
compared to the rarely-shaved hair of the
arms. This would seem to indicate that
the shaving process made the leg hair
that way.
In reality, however, this scratchiness is
due to the shortness of stubble, rather
than to any change in the nature of the
hair itself. A visit to the Modern Thought
and Literature department, however,
demonstrates that leg hair once shaved
(say, during one's unenlightened under
graduate years) returns in graduate school
to the silky fineness of hair that has never
known the oppression of the razor.

Chris Patil is a third-year freshman in
the Biology department who wishes that
his brother Jason would get a proper
haircut.

weren't attached to your skin, it would
be pushing up daisies.
The typical mammalian hair consists
of the shaft, which protrudes above the
skin, and the root, which grows from a
pit, or follicle, beneath the skin's surface.
Except for a few dividing cells at the very
base of the root, which both provide raw
material for new hair and hold the shaft
in place, the hair is dead tissue consisting
of keratin and related proteins.
Because a hair is no longer in the
realm of the living, there is no mecha
nism for signal transduction from the
shaft to the root. In layperson's terms,
the growing part of the hair doesn't
know how long the shaft is, so cutting
the shaft couldn't possibly cause the root
cells to divide any faster.
Body hair follicles, in contrast to head
and facial follicles, do indeed cycle
between a growing phase and a dormant
phase, but the duration of these phases
depends on the type of hair follicle in
question, not on the length of the product.
Incidentally, this growth-dormancy
cycle explains why body hair doesn't
grow to arbitrary lengths. At the end of a
follicle's growth phase, the hair's root
rigidifies and pulls away from the source
cells. When a new period of proliferation
begins, the new hair pushes the old hair
out of the follicle.
Thus, there is a biological limit on the
length of one's body hair. If there weren't,
then uncut armpit hair — which, like
other types of human hair, grows about
half an inch every month — would be
longer than our arms by the time we hit
twenty.
Although this may come as a disap
pointment to all you would-be Hairy Men
and Womyn out there, you can't fool
Mother Nature into giving you more
than you got, faster than you're already
getting it, by shaving or other trickery.
Now, to the controversial part. This
humble Bug will now speculate about the
source of the myth, which we will call the

Norelco Fallacy.
Confession: I, too, used to believe that
I could make my facial hair grow faster
by shaving. My evidence was straightfor
ward. Around the age of thirteen, I got
tired of the caterpillar-on-the-lip jokes
the cruel children used to aim at me. I
decided to take a blade to myself.
Sure enough, over the course of that
year, each month's new crop seemed
thicker and darker than the previous
month's harvest. I was becoming a man.
Had I known virile Stanford heartthrob
Joel Stein at the time, I would have fan
tasized that I would someday be like him.
And if someone had asked me whether
shaving made a mustache grow faster, I
would have responded with a lusty,
pubescent "You betcha!"
It was simple: I shaved. My hair grew
faster. Ergo, shaving accelerates hair
growth. Allow me to paraphrase. On a
cloudy day, I put up an umbrella. It
began to rain. Therefore, umbrellas
make it rain.
I think similar errors in the thought
processes of other early teenagers have led
to the propagation of the Norelco fallacy.
The time when most men (and women,
for that matter) begin shaving is right
around puberty — which is also when
body hair starts to come in denser and
faster. Our society has fallen victim to a
confusion of correlation with causation.
Other factors lending credibility to the
Norelco fallacy include the (quite accu
rate) observation made by many women
that leg stubble is scratchy and coarse
compared to the rarely-shaved hair of the
arms. This would seem to indicate that
the shaving process made the leg hair
that way.
In reality, however, this scratchiness is
due to the shortness of stubble, rather
than to any change in the nature of the
hair itself. A visit to the Modern Thought
and Literature department, however,
demonstrates that leg hair once shaved
(say, during one's unenlightened under
graduate years) returns in graduate school
to the silky fineness of hair that has never
known the oppression of the razor.

the Biology department who wishes that
his brother Jason would get a proper
haircut.

The mythological systems associate
hair with the instinctive and the primi
tive. What I'm suggesting, then, is that
every modern male has, lying at the bot
tom of his psyche, a large, primitive being
covered with hair down to his feet.

About Men"
Q. Is it true that if you cut hair it
• grows back faster?
- Bill Walsh
A. Of course it does! Everyone knows
• that as soon as you shave your legs,
armpit or upper lip, the hair comes back
with a vengeance — coarser, denser and
faster than before. Right?
Wrong.
Despite the popular misconception,
the probable source of which I will dis
cuss later, cutting and shaving cannot
stimulate hair growth. You see, hair
doesn't know whether it's been cut or
not because it's dead. Expired and gone
to meet its maker. Demised. Departed
and joined the choir invisible. If it
weren't attached to your skin, it would
be pushing up daisies.
