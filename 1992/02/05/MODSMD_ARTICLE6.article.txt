# Tresidder basement to be put to new use
## 'Retail court' is one of the proposals 
### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
A Taco Bell, a Chinese take-out
and a graduate testing prepara
tion center will fill the ten thou
sand square feet of unoccupied
space in the basement of Tresid
der Union if Council of Presidents
member John Overdeck gets his
way.
But Tresidder officials also
want the space so they can rear
range existing services to create a
"retail court."
Most of the space, which is
located next to the Tresidder
Game Room, has been empty
since 1989. A bowling alley locat
ed there was removed in 1981.
The space was originally tar
geted for a "food service master
plan," which was postponed after
the 1989 earthquake. Tresidder's
associate director, Paul Szczesiul,
said they had already received
nearly $2 million for the project,
which was then diverted to other
uses.
Szczesiul said he hopes to
spend between $2 million and $6
million during the next two years
to expand the Coffee House into
the video game area and develop
what he calls a retail court.
"I hate to use the word 'mall'

because it has a connotation that
I don't want to imply," he said. "I
want the court to provide conve
niences, services and also a fun
place to hang out."
Szczesiul said he also hopes to
move the Corner Pocket to where
Tresidder Express is located and
move the convenience store into
the retail court. He would also
like the retail court to include
additional post office boxes.
But some ASSU Senate mem
bers have grander ideas.
Overdeck has suggested a Taco
Bell, a Chinese food take-out and
a Stanley Kaplan educational cen
ter. While Tresidder owns the
space, Overdeck said officials
have expressed interest in joint
ventures.
He hopes the senate will move
quickly to consider his proposals
and negotiate with Tresidder offi
cials.
"That space could generate
such a profit, if we, the ASSU,
start moving with sufficient
speed," he said. "If we are inter
ested, then we should get started.
I mean, right now, in the history
of the University, it is not a good
time for it to be turning away
profits."
