# New prices keeping unused points down
## Food Service price increase having intended effect, but not all are happy 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Now that University Food Service has raised
prices for students on the A la Carte board plan,
some students say they may eat their way
through their points well before the quarter
ends.
But Food Service officials say the average
number of points students have left over is
actually above where it should be at this point
in the year.
At the end of last quarter, many students
used their hundreds of leftover points to buy
cases of drinks and candy or to buy food to
donate to the homeless.
Students planning to consume all of their
points on the A la Carte regular plan should
have had $636 in points remaining as of Sun
day, according to Food Service calculations.
Associate Director of Food Service Shirley
Everett said the average point total on Sunday
was $654.
Totals for the Lite A la Carte plan are simi
lar. Students scheduled to run out at quarter's
end should now have $601 in points, but have
an average of $630 left.
The plan, which allows students to choose
the food items they want and have the corre
sponding number of points subtracted from
their total, is available at Stern Hall, Kimball
Hall and Ricker dining hall.
According to a letter sent out to students
Friday by Everett and Director of Housing and
Food Services Keith Guy, prices were raised

this quarter to compensate for the money lost
because last quarter's prices were about 8 per
cent too low.
Besides explaining the reasons for the price
increases, the letter also told students how
many points they should have left.
Several students said they are outraged by
the price increases.
"The prices have skyrocketed," said fresh
man Prashant Shah. "We have a lot of points
left over, so they raise prices. What happens
when next quarter a lot of people run out? Do
they force us to buy more points?"
"If the food had changed, then the change in
(prices) would be justifiable," said freshman
Dan Kostle. "But the food is the same and we
pay more."
Kostle and Shah both said they believe they
will run out of points this quarter.
Everett said the point increases were neces
sary because "if people had used up all of their
points last quarter, we would not have been
able to meet our expenses." Those expenses
include food, salaries and benefits, mainte
nance of dining halls, utilities, management
and insurance.
The people responsible for setting food
prices first quarter "didn't understand stu
dents eating habits, so they set the prices too
low so students would not run out of dollars,"
Everett said.
According to Everett, the pricing problem
has been solved and food service "will not be
raising prices anymore. But anywhere we see
prices can be lowered, we will take that under

advisement."
Amanda Merryman and Clark Moore, both
freshmen, met with Everett and Guy recently
to voice their complaints about the A la Carte
board plan. Merryman said she "didn't think
raising prices was a solution to the problem of
excess points."
Guy said he is considering changes in the A
la Carte system, including expanding it to one
or more additional cafeterias, offering a less
expensive Extra-Lite plan and changing the
way Food Service covers its overhead costs.
"It was our plan when we did this expansion
that we would expand into two more dorms,
but the current thinking is we need to refine
the program first," he said.
Everett said an "Extra-Lite" board plan is
being considered so Housing and Food Services
"can satisfy the needs of extra-light eaters as
well as the heavy eaters as well as those in
between." Extra-heavy eaters can already buy
more points to supplement the regular plan,
she added.
A final option would be to levy a minimum,
mandatory charge which would cover Food Ser
vice costs, then allow students to buy as many
points as they want.
While such a system is being considered,
Everett said, she does not know if it would be
practical.
Guy said that although some revision is
needed, the A la Carte program "is the right
program for us to serve right now."
"The variety and choices available are pleas
ing to students," he said.

Everett said an "Extra-Lite" board plan is
being considered so Housing and Food Services
"can satisfy the needs of extra-light eaters as
well as the heavy eaters as well as those in
between." Extra-heavy eaters can already buy
more points to supplement the regular plan,
she added.
A final option would be to levy a minimum,
mandatory charge which would cover Food Ser
vice costs, then allow students to buy as many
points as they want.
While such a system is being considered,
Everett said, she does not know if it would be
practical.
Guy said that although some revision is
needed, the A la Carte program "is the right
program for us to serve right now."
"The variety and choices available are pleas
ing to students," he said.
