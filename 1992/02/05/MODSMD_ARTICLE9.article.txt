Venezuelan government thwarts rebellion
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Loyal soldiers repulsed an
attack by rebel troops and tanks on the presidential palace Tues
day, crushing an attempt to overthrow Latin America's second
oldest continuous democracy.
By Tuesday afternoon, Defense Minister Fernando Ochoa stud
loyal troops had "completely suffocated" the rebels, who had ear
lier abducted one state governor and staged attacks as well in the
western cities of Maracay, Valencia and Maracaibo.
Ochoa did not give a casualty count from the fighting, but the
respected newspaper El Nacional, quoting government sources,
reported at least 14 soldiers on both sides were killed in the palace
attack and 300 rebels were arrested.
The motives for the coup attempt were unclear, but it followed
violent protests and labor unrest arising from a growing dispari
ty between rich and poor in Venezuela.
Following the attack, the government banned public demon
strations, broadened police arrest powers and suspended some
constitutional civil rights guarantees for at least 10 days.
Bush's approval rating low but stable
NEW YORK (AP) — President Bush's job approval rating has
leveled off after a nine-month slide, two polls found, but most vot
ers still disapprove of his handling of the economy.
Bush's approval rating was 47 percent in a USA Today-CNN -
Gallup poll of 1,007 voters taken Jan. 31-Feb. 1 and released
Monday. An ABC News-Washington Post poll taken Jan. 30-Feb.
2 among 1,512 adults nationally put Bush's approval rating at 46
percent, virtually unchanged since December.
Just days after Bush presented his economic plan in the State
of the Union speech, 58 percent said his proposals were not likely
to end the recession, and nearly eight in 10 disapproved of his
handling of the economy, USA Today reported today.
