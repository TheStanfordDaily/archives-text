# Eyebrows raised by Bookstore perks

### Steve McCarroll Editorial staff 
University officials expressed
concern about The Daily's report
yesterday of questionable finan
cial arrangements at the Stanford
Bookstore, a nonprofit corpora
tion run independently of the
University.
For the past several years, the
Bookstore has been leasing a
vacation home in central Califor
nia from a consulting firm owned
and operated by the Bookstore's
top two managers, Eldon Speed
and Philip Chiaramonte, The
Daily disclosed yesterday.
In addition to use of the vaca
tion home, the Bookstore pro
vides its senior employees with
automobiles, a leased motorhome
and several other perquisites
unheard of elsewhere in the col
lege bookstore industry, The
Daily reported.*
"If true, these disclosures are
troubling," said Provost James
Rosse. "Stanford University has
acted in good faith in its relations
with the Bookstore and has
expected the same fair treatment
in return. We expect the book
store to take action to resolve the
questions raised by these recent
disclosures."
University President Donald
Kennedy, who returned from a
trip yesterday afternoon, said he
had not reviewed the report fully
and declined to comment.
Officials emphasized that the
store is operated by an indepen
dent corporation that is neither
owned nor controlled by Stanford.
A University press release

stated that the bookstore's "fiscal
and management operations are
independent of the University."
For use of space on campus, the
Bookstore pays the University
$2,500 a month, plus "overage
rent" equal to 1 percent of the
store's gross sales on clothing, sou
venirs, stationary and gifls, accord
ing to a June 4, 1990, amendment
to the store's lease agreement. The
current option period of the lease
expires Feb. 29, 2000.
