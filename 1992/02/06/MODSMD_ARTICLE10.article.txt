House authorizes 'October Surprise' probe
WASHINGTON (AP) — Overcoming six months of Republican
resistance, the House late Wednesday authorized a formal inves
tigation into whether the 1980 Reagan-Bush campaign conspired
with Iran to delay release of American hostages.
Lawmakers engaged in a scathing partisan debate before vot
ing 217-192, mostly along party lines, to begin the inquiry into
the so-called "October Surprise" and pay for it with an undeter
mined amount from the House contingency fund.
The vote came immediately after lawmakers rejected, 249-158,
a GOP version that would have extended the probe to include
actions of the Carter administration during the same period.
Teenager admits 'mercenary style' slayings
PHOENIX (AP) — A teenager charged with killing nine people
at a Buddhist temple claimed to be an assassin for military intel
ligence and admitted shooting monks "mercenary style," a fellow
ROTC cadet testified.
"He said the monks were invading on some type of national
security so OSI (the Office of Special Investigations) had to elim
inate them," Benjamin Leininger testified Tuesday during the
fourth day of hearings.
The hearings are to determine if Jonathan Doody, 17, should
be tried as an adult in the Aug. 10 massacre at the Wat Promku
naram Temple in which six monks, two young male followers and
an elderly nun were shot to death. A similar hearing is scheduled
later for co-defendant Alessandro "Alex" Garcia, 16.
