# Budget ax skins 'leather' from diplomas
## 
### John Ford 
Leather diploma covers, tradi
tional standards on graduation
day, may be only a fond memory
for the graduating class of 1993.
At a savings of $4 per student,
the University will most likely
replace the covers — which are
actually made of vinyl — with a
high-grade paper sleeve or folder.
The move would save the Reg
istrar's Office a total of $17,000
per year, a fraction of their
$329,000 targeted budget reduc
tion, according to Acting Regis

trar Jack Farrell. Most of the
office's cuts have come in the area
of classroom improvement, where
it is trimming expenditures by
$140,000.
The Registrar's Office has
already reduced its staff by four
people — three full-time positions
and one part-time position. The
cost of the diploma covers is rough
ly equivalent to the salary of one
part-time employee, Farrell said.
According to Farrell, no more
staff reductions are planned, as
the office is "already drastically
understaffed." Farrell said he

believes the covers were simply
"the most logical thing to cut,"
noting that most diplomas even
tually end up in frames or in the
attic.
The Registrar's Office consid
ered several cost-cutting options,
including one which would have
preserved the vinyl covers. If the
University waited until after grad
uation to distribute the actual
diplomas, it could save a significant
amount of money, Farrell said.
The current procedure requires
the Registrar's Office to rush
preparation of diplomas, including

those of students who do not actu
ally graduate.
By distributing diplomas later,
the registrar could avoid this
"huge logistical undertaking,"
Farrell said.
However, the Registrar's Office
ultimately decided that giving stu
dents fake diplomas would take
more away from the ceremony
than replacing the vinyl covers.
The proposal is currently
awaiting the approval of the Cabi
net Committee on Budget and
Strategic Planning, chaired by
Provost James Rosse.
