# Did Butterfield really cut too much? Nope

### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
When Barbara Butterfield's budget-reduc
tion proposal came out last week, many people
thought she had cut more than she had been
assigned.
After all, Human Resources had been
assigned a target of $400,000, but the unit's
plan called for cuts totalling $514,000.
Was Butterfield actually cutting more to
help out the rest of the University?
"Not me," the vice president said with a
laugh. "If I had found fat I would have cut it,
but we have made as big a contribution as we
could and still meet our obligations."
What about the $114,000 difference
between the target and actual cuts?
"We still had outstanding obligations to
repositioning," said Butterfield, who was
hired over the summer. "Our first target for
this current round of cuts was $400,000. But

when we looked at the past repositioning
effort and our remaining obligations, we real
ized that we would have to exceed our amount
to meet our total target."
Repositioning was the effort begun in 1990
to cut administrative expenses by about $22
million, and Human Resources was reduced
by approximately 30 percent.
With this current round of budget cuts,
Human Resources now faces major reorgani
zation as well as actions to improve efficiency.
Butterfield said that although she is "not
going to say that there will be no layoffs," she
hopes to accomplish staff reductions through
attrition and early retirement.
She said she is unable to predict how many
positions will be eliminated because it is
unclear how many people will exercise early
retirement options.
Human Resources will open a second
regional office next year to "seriously downsize
the central office," Butterfield said.

About 18 months ago, a regional office pilot
program was begun to provide field services
directly to the schools. The program "seemed
to be quite successful," according to Tina Kass,
associate vice president of Human Resources.
"We are not looking at the [second regional
office] for huge savings," Kass said. The new
office will service the University's administrative
areas, and the "focus is very different. We will be
a service-provider rather than a policy-maker."
But Butterfield said that if staff reductions
turn out to be significant, "our fallback position
will be to seriously modify our field services."
Besides staff reductions, another significant
cost-reduction effort in Human Resources will
be to move away from using outside consultants.
"We are trying to emphasize building skills
on the inside ... to give us greater continu
ity," Butterfield said. "We have asked the con
sultants to teach our staff to do their work. It
makes for a difficult working relationship, but
they agreed to do it."
