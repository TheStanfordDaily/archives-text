Experimental offerings
supplement courses in
traditional departments

THE UNIVERSITY HAS pro
posed that the Innovative Aca
demic Courses program be
terminated as part of the cuts neces
sitated by the current budget crisis.
lAC includes Stanford Work
shop on Political and Social Issues,
Undergraduate Special courses
and the Peters Freshman-Sopho
more Seminars under its umbrel
la. The cuts would save the Uni
versity about $180,000.
lAC was inaugurated to bridge
the gap between theoretical train
ing and practical knowledge. Many
of the instructors bring social, eco
nomic and political perspectives
that complement the world view
that students receive at Stanford.
Many subjects that were first
introduced under the rubric of lAC
have gone on to have flourishing
careers in more traditional depart
ments.
For example, until recently
SWOPSI was the only forum for
the teaching of Native American
studies. The past two years have
seen a dramatic increase in offer
ings in Native American studies;
this quarter there are at least four
such classes being offered through
various departments.
Similar examples can be drawn
from other fields of culture and
history. lAC classes have been
incorporated — albeit slowly — by
the University itself as integral
components of a rich and invigo
rating liberal education.
Since instructors are allowed
room for flexibility and experimen
tation, lAC is able to bring stu
dents the kinds of inter-disci
plinary insights that traditional
departments are sometimes
unable to provide.
Moreover, the program's contri
butions to Stanford have extended
beyond the realm of the classroom.

The Recycling Center, Synergy
House and the Environmental
Audit are some examples of lAC
inspired projects that have
enhanced the quality of life in the
Stanford community.
These courses have afforded
many students with some of the
most compelling moments in their
educational itineraries: "life
changing" and"the most valuable
class I've ever taken" have not
been uncommon comments.
For instance, "Issues in Self-
Defense for Women," a SWOPSI
class, is consistently inundated
with more applicants than the
course is capable of accommodat
ing. There is currently no other
institutionalized space within the
University for offering the course.
Budget realities may force some
cuts to the lAC program. But with
a few changes, the program could
be saved in a reduced form.
If the University eliminates
some of the less academically rig
orous classes and those with little
student interest, costs could be
substantially reduced. One possi
bility is to have sign-ups posted a
quarter in advance so that classes
that evidence feeble student inter
est need not be offered.
To make up for the money spent
on a revived lAC, classes in other
areas which are outdated or not aca
demically challenging should go,
instead of cutting an entire program
that brings in a fresh perspective.
At the very least, the University
should officially declare its support
in principle and make the effort to
search for outside funding for
these classes.
Consigning lAC to the trashbin
would make a mockery of the
exhortation University leaders aim
at incoming freshmen — to take
advantage of Stanford's diverse
academic opportunities.
The University will be guilty of
grave historical amnesia if the deci
sion to eliminate LAC is implement
ed. And given the primacy that is
claimed for history within these
hallowed halls of learning, this ges
ture would be quite ironic indeed.
