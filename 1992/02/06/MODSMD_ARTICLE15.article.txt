Rabois 9 remarks spark student and staff reactions

Fraternity founded on
principles of tolerance
In light of the "Otero incident"
reported in Monday's issue of The Daily,
the Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity has
decided to take a stern stand against the
actions of the individual involved.
When Keith Rabois made these
remarks in reference to Resident Fellow
Dennis Matthies, he was acting on his
own volition, and his actions do not in
any way reflect the views or opinions of
organizations he may be a member of.
Keith Rabois is an alumnus of the
Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity, and for this
reason, the entire brotherhood of this
chapter has chosen to join Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson in publicly con
demning his actions.
The fraternity believes strongly in an
individual's right to freedom of speech,
but would like to make clear that it finds
morally reprehensible the content of
these comments.
As a Jewish Fraternity, AEPi was
founded in response to the intense dis
crimination young Jewish men experi
enced on college campuses. Rabois'
remarks not only diverge from this goal,
but are in direct contradiction to the
express mission of AEPi.
His comments violate all modicum of
humanity and decency. As a minority
organization, AEPi finds the content of
his speech fundamentally repugnant.
Denigration of another minority group is
repulsive in any form it takes. Ignorance
and sweeping generalizations serve only
to perpetuate false stereotypes and fur
ther divide our fragile community.
As respectful members of the Stan
ford student body, we seek to gain toler
ance and foster understanding among
the various elements on campus. In the
past, as in the future, we hope to bridge
the gap of misunderstanding that sur-

rounds all of us.
We extend to the entire University
our deepest apologies and regrets for
Rabois' comments. We cannot empha
size enough, however, that his actions
were undertaken independently of our
organization and should in no way be
construed as indicative of our member
ship.
While certainly not intending to mini
mize the gravity of the situation, we
hope that this incident can serve as a
catalyst to engender more open commu
nication and greater tolerance among
Stanford's diverse groups.

Lawyer claims Rabois
will shame profession
I would like to add my voice to Dean
of Students Michael Jackson's in his
denunciations of the actions of the stu
dent who engaged in homophobic
harassment at Otero last month.
The Daily quoted Keith Rabois, the
law student who has admitted making
the remarks, as saying that "People have
tried to talk me into testing it [the Fun
damental Standard provision on hate
speech 1 for a long time."
One wonders just who such advisers
are, and whether they know anything
about the standards of the Stanford
community. Those who are part of this
community and embrace its qualities of
mutual respect and dignity, are unlikely
to have recommended to Rabois such a
mean-spirited and provocative tactic for
challenging the hate speech provision.
This institution has legitimate legisla
tive mechanisms for effecting such
changes, and responsible student leader
ship that is responsive to reasoned argu
ment.
As an attorney, I believe that Rabois

is probably correct that his behavior
during this incident cannot be pun
ished under the Fundamental Stan
dard. However, as an attorney and a
Stanford alumna, I am deeply dis
turbed that a person of Rabois' charac
ter — and with his obvious disrespect
for human dignity — may someday
become qualified as a member of my
profession, displaying two Stanford
degrees on his office wall.
I hope the Bar Association of whatev
er state in which Rabois elects to prac
tice is informed of his behavior in this
incident and aware that such behavior
represents a violation of this communi
ty's values.

Homophobic remarks
seen as embarrassment
In Monday's issue The Daily, Keith
Rabois offered the following justification
for the litany of homophobic remarks he
allegedly shouted late last month: "I'm a
first-year law student, and I know exact
ly what you can say and what you
can't."
As law students, we are embarrassed
that Rabois should shamelessly parade
his legal education around to legitimize
public displays of bigotry.
More importantly, though, we're dis
tressed that someone in our midst
believes that by ducking beneath the
mantle of the law, he is thereby relieved
of his moral responsibilities, one of
which is to be respectful of others in his
community. There is a crucial distinc
tion between doing what is legal and
doing what is right. Anyone familiar
with the history of the civil rights move
ment knows this.
The mindless invectives that Rabois
defended may fall within the realm of

First Amendment protections, but they
are damaging to the entire University
nonetheless and ought not to be tolerated.

Residents of Otero are
free to voice opinions
Keith Rabois, to whom have you been
talking? Who are these people who
"always complain about there being a
very regimented orthodoxy" within
Otero? They seem to have a problem dif
ferentiating between the opinions of an
authority figure and divine law.
Resident Fellow Dennis Matthies'
opinion is valued, but is in no way the
last word on the subject. His condemna
tion or praise is not proof of vice or
virtue, but merely his own judgement.
I can assure you that as a resident of
Otero I am as free to express homophobic,
sexist and racist sentiment as any individ
ual, dorm or publication on campus.
