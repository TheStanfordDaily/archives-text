Sick of being the odd one at your Sunday

Sick of being the sole Black friend to 34

WHAT DOES IT MEAN to be "sole
Black friend to 34 individual
white people?" I've been there
much of my life, and yet it wasn't until
recently that I understood. Jacob, one of
my best friends from high school, is white
and Jewish, and like most of my friends is
seriously into black music and culture. For
me, with an African-American mother and
a German-Jewish-American father, the
New York music scene was a particularly
cool place to come of age since it is so heav
ily populated by both blacks and Jews.
To be down one needed only to know
and love the beats and lyrics of the week
— a test my white friends passed with fly
ing colors. Though we differed by race,
class and grade point average, music
bonded us all. I could feel profoundly con

nected to both my black and Jewish her
itage without ever leaving a small group
of friends. Everything seemed fine.
This past summer when I returned
home, though, I began to wrestle with a lot
of difficult issues I'd never dealt with
before. Jacob and I got together as we had
every summer since heading off to college,
but now I noticed music wasn't enough to
sustain our friendship. Conversations that
flowed naturally among my black friends
at Stanford stumbled and collapsed with
Jake. I began to bite my tongue rather
than speak my mind. I wanted a dialogue
but found only monologues. Music
couldn't substitute for consciousness. Our
friendship was close but shallow.
As I painfully reevaluated the relation
ship, bigger questions soon followed.
Jacob had three crates of Black vinyl —
from Otis Redding to Ice Cube — but got
nervous at the sight of a street-corner
boombox. His green suede Pumas were
decked out with fat laces, but he ran
quick across the darker avenues. He wor
shiped black culture but couldn't relate
to black people.
I was Jacob's only close black friend —
even though his school has a large black
population. All of my white friends found
meaning and beauty in black culture, but
rarely left the comfort of their own
worlds to enjoy it. My head began to spin
with increasingly bitter and sorrowful
thoughts. I saw that I repeatedly wan

dered into the role of lone black pal.
"What is it about me?" I wondered.
On some level, I knew. My combina
tion of looks and language, experience
and etiquette, color and complexion were
both seductively black and reassuringly
white. I was black, but not too black.
In spite of my Medusa-like mane of
dreadlocks I was never frightening. I was
never a challenge, never a threat. I never
posed uncomfortable questions. I never
complained to Jake that he rarely came to
my neighborhood. I never questioned the
contradiction of his million-dollar home
and ghetto attire. I brought so little con
sciousness or politics to our friendship that
I soon questioned my own state of mind.
Perhaps I appealed to some vision of
what Jake and others wanted for friends,
without all the baggage of blackness.
Sometimes I felt like a prop — a two
dimensional piece of scenery merely adding
color. The more painful truth, I think, is
that I added scarcely any color at all. The
real bitterness with being Jacob's only
black friend was not what it said about him
but rather what it said about me.
