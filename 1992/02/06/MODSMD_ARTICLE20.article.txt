Otero RF shares inner conflict with Stanford community

AT THE START OF THE quarter, I
was trying to decide It's the
first class. Many of the students
are expecting Arthur. Should I announce
that I'm filling in? What should I say?
That he's dying of AIDS?
But making an announcement like
that on the first day! It will ruin the "bon
voyage" party that I want to create as we
launch the class. Besides, what if Arthur
recovers? Besides, what if someone in the
class turns out to be a good friend of his
who hadn't known? And besides ....
Oh, my mind could cook up lots and
lots of good reasons for not talking
about Arthur and especially for not
talking about AIDS during that first

class. Or during that first week. Or dur
ing those first four weeks. Lots of good
reasons, until now. Arthur Hail has
died. And I have a young Republican
who has located the frontier of free
speech somewhere around my doorstep.
Courageously, he is building a stronger
democracy by chanting "Faggot! Hope
you die of AIDS! Can't wait 'till you die,
faggot!"
My second big mistake this quarter:
answering, on its own terms, The Daily's
question, the inevitable question. After
rummaging around Otero for a while,
they finally came right out and asked
me: "Well, are you gay?"
For the last fifteen years I have spent

about half my time with students, trying
to cajole them into living with questions
instead of answers and trying to coax
them into answering questions with cat
egories that go beyond "yes" or "no," the
two blind mice. For the last fifteen years
I have spent most of the rest of my time
with my closest friends, together trying
to practice truth-telling, together trying
to realize higher levels of self-knowledge
through inner perception that is patient,
gentle, honest and accurate.
I am disgusted at the "no" I gave to
the Daily. It was a damn lie. It was the
kind of horrid simplification of inner
experience that dishonors every human
being who has the courage to learn

about sexuality by themselves, for them
selves and from themselves, rather than
from some banal textbook, pop song, ser
mon or soap opera.
My "no" was an insult to the personal
struggle and silent spiritual work of
some of my dearest friends, whose inner
awareness has lead them away from aca
demic intellectualizations and public
simplifications and brought them into
unclarity wholly unresolved or partly
unresolved and a higher level of observa
tion and questioning.
As we speak about AIDS, gender and
sexuality, let's leave the deadly simplifi
cations for the boy scouts, the churches,
the journalists and the politicians. Folks

who need to live in a world that is black
and white, or who simply are too busy
for the details, will always want us
either to just say yes or to just say no.
Let's build a new language for
describing ourselves. We will be clear
about our unclarity and confident of our
uncertainty. We will insist on words that
are truer to the complexity of our inner
experience.
Perhaps we should start with the
word "bigot" — is this itself a dangerous
simplification? Or "homophobia" — is
this a word that obscures more than it
reveals?
