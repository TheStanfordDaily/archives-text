# Salamanca program offers total immersion
## 
### 
I am overwhelmed by the possibility
that Stanford's overseas program in Sala
manca may close. For the past 14 years, I
have received enthusiastic reports from
students who returned from Salamanca
tremendously invigorated by their intel
lectual and cultural experience and speak
ing Spanish almost like natives.
For six months they lived in university
dorms with hundreds of their Spanish
counterparts; attended University of Sala
manca classes in any subject of their
choice with Spanish colleagues; played soc
cer; sang in a choir; did research; saw a
movie or strolled through the Plaza Mayor
with their Spanish friends. This is — to

my knowledge —the only American pro
gram that offers students total immersion
in the life of the country where they study.
Stanford students come back from
Salamanca well prepared for the Spanish
Proficiency test, which awards them a cer
tification of mastery of the language on
their transcript. Many become Spanish
majors and either return to Spain or go to
Latin America for further study or work.
This year, Spain commemorates the
anniversary between the encounter of
the two worlds, the beginning of the
unique bonds between Iberia and the
Americas. The University of Salamanca
has been made the Headquarters of the
recently founded Instituto Cervantes,
the equivalent of the British Council,
Alliance Francaise or Goethe Institute.
Seville will be the site of the World's
Fair, Barcelona will host the Olympic

Games and Madrid has been named the
"Cultural Capital of Europe."
The irony of the matter is that students
interested in Spain will continue going to
Spain. If you close Salamanca, they will
attend other programs and transfer their
credits, resulting in a tuition loss.
My colleagues in the department of
Spanish and Portuguese and I would
have liked very much indeed to be able to
spend one or two quarters in Salamanca
in pursuit of our own intellectual goals.
However, we have gladly given up this
possibility because we believe, as many
other professors do in the other Euro
pean centers, that the interests of our
students come first. Please, do not
deprive them of the cultural and intellec
tual benefit of their studies in Salamanca.
