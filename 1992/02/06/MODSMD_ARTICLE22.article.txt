# Response necessary to inflammatory speech
## 
### 
I wholeheartedly agree with the stance
taken by Dean of Students Michael Jack
son in his letter concerning the Jan. 19
incident in Otero house. In that inci
dent, Keith Rabois went out of his way
to prove that he is capable of spewing
the kind of ignorant filth common
among hardened criminals and right
here on the Stanford campus.
He may feel as if he's accomplished
something by being as hateful as possible
without violating the Fundamental Stan
dard. But just because he might "get
away with" his behavior in this instance
does not mean that the rest of us have to
like it or keep quiet about it. He can dish

it out, so he should be forced to take it.
Members of this community should
speak up and let people know in no
uncertain terms exactly how they feel
about this kind of conduct. No elaborate
arguments need be invoked to justify a
gut reaction decrying this type of hate
ful, unsophisticated and obviously
inflammatory speech.
If nothing else, the majority of people
in the Stanford Community can hope
that Rabois has learned a thing or two
about decorum and public relations from
this incident and its resulting publicity.
If not, perhaps then the community
will subject him to the sort of loathing
that his kind has always directed toward
whatever group happens to be the scape
goat of the day.
