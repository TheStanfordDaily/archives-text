### Mike Langford Staff writer 
It wasn't pretty, but they did
it. Despite plenty of Sacramento
State hits and loads of missed
opportunities for the Cardinal,
the Stanford baseball team
shook off the Hornets with a 6-5
victory at Sunken Diamond yes
terday.

Sacramento State had a
tremendous day at the plate,
accumulating 16 hits to Stan
ford's six, yet both teams clogged
the bases all day, with the Cardi
nal stranding nine and the Hor
nets 11.
However, just as Stanford bats
had trouble finding the ball,
Sacramento State pitchers had
trouble finding the plate, as they
walked seven. In addition, Sacra
mento State committed three

errors, all of which led to Stan
ford runs.
"There's three phases to this
game," said Hornet head coach
Jon Smith. "You gotta catch the
ball, you gotta throw strikes, and
you gotta hit the ball. And one out
of three isn't gonna do it."
The starting pitcher for the Car
dinal, sophomore Willie Adams,
allowed seven hits through three
innings, but only gave up two runs.
Junior transfer Rick Helling came
in to pitch the next three and a
third innings, and maintained his
torrid strikeout pace by fanning six
Hornet batters.
However, in the seventh,
Helling began to tire and ended up
allowing seven more hits and three
runs (only one earned).
Sacramento State got on the
board early, scoring once in the
second and fourth, but Stanford
came back with a run in the third
and two in the fifth.
Then, in the bottom of the
sixth, after walks to Matt Boke
meier and Jed Hansen, Jeffrey
Hammonds delivered a stand-up
double just inside the third-base
bag to score both runners. Ham

monds then proceeded to steal
third base and score on an over
throw, bringing the score to 6-2,
just enough to withstand the
three runs the Hornets would
later get against Helling.
Along with Hammonds, the
headline performances of the
game came from the Stanford
relief pitchers.
Coming in with a runner on
third base with one out, Andrew
Lorraine struck out the next two
batters he faced.
Next, Aaron Dorlarque came in
for the final inning and a third,
striking out three. In all, Stanford
pitchers struck out 14 Sac State
batters, and walked none.
"We allowed a lot of hits, but
we came up with the big pitches at
the right times," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess.
Clutch pitching will be crucial
for the Cardinal this weekend,
when they host Cal State-Fuller
ton for a three game series. The
Titans, a perennial Stanford rival,
are currently ranked fourth in the
nation by Baseball America.
Tomorrow's Sunken Diamond
game time is 2 p.m.
