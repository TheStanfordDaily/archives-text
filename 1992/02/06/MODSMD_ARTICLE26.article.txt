# What a class!
## Gridiron recruits unveiled 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Stanford football coach Bill Walsh says he is
not the guy to thank, but with national letter of
intent day come and gone, the Cardinal appears to
have collected a group of incoming players that
could be ranked in the nation's top ten.
Giving credit to his predecessor Denny Green,
Walsh presided over a press conference yesterday
that announced a 1992 recruiting class that
includes seven Prep Ail-Americans, as well as the
No.l rated offensive lineman and the No.l rated
placekicker.
"Obviously it was the work of Denny and his
staff that did the job," said Walsh. "We had to
come in and act like monitors, and luckily we
didn't botch anything. We were merely caretakers
to the job that had already been done."
After it was announced that Walsh had signed
on to coach Stanford, the wide-spread notion was
that players across the country would flock to the
Farm. According to recruiting coordinator Keith
Sparks this was not the case.
"Most of the kids were pretty well entrenched

with us," said Sparks. "They
wanted to go to Stanford and had
some uncertainty (after Green
left). The hiring of Bill Walsh
obviously sealed it for them, but it
wasn't the primary factor."
Sparks went on to say that
next year is when Walsh's influ
ence will really be felt, a proposi
tion that has to make Cardinal
fans smile considering the over
all strength of this year's class.
In addition to placekicker Eric
Abrams and offensive lineman

Jeff Bucky (the nation's best in
their respective positions), Stan
ford signed a group that also has
the seventh ranked linebacker in
Justin Morabito and three of the
top 37 offensive lineman in the
country. The 20 total recruits are
composed of 18 freshman, and
two transfersâ€”sophomore out
side linebacker Damon South
ward from Michigan and junior
defensive lineman Bryan Taylor
from College of Siskiyous.
"I believe this class is the best at
Stanford in recent memory," said
Sparks. "From what I have been
told by several recruiting maga
zines, this class could be ranked
among the top-10 in the nation."
