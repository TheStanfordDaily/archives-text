# Another 'Miracle of Maples'? Hoops face Arizona
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Stanford hosts seventh-ranked Arizona
tonight in the fourth anniversary of the
Miracle of Maples, the upset that put Stan
ford back on the college basketball map.
On Feb. 4, 1988, the unheralded Cardi
nal stunned the No. 1 Wildcats 82-74,
earning Stanford its first hardwood recog
nition since the 1942 NCAA title.
Just one year later, Stanford exploded
into the top 15 with a sweet 83-78 upset
repeat of the visiting No. 8 Wildcats.
Arizona has beaten Stanford seven
times in a row since Miracles I and 11, but
the legacy of the upsets gives Stanford an
intangible advantage heading into the
Pacific 10 Conference showdown.
"At the time those games were really
important to establish our credibility,"
said Stanford coach Mike Montgomery.
"It was something that had never hap
pened to Stanford basketball.
"But now they don't mean much,
because our kids weren't here then. People
remember the excitement, but it doesn't
really have any bearing on the game."
Only one Stanford player — senior
Adam Keefe — was at Stanford for Mira
cle II and no one except Montgomery
remains from Miracle I.
A nostalgic look back at the Miracles at
Maples, two of the most exciting basket
ball games in Stanford basketball history:
•Miracle I: Stanford 82, Arizona 74. A
frenzied Maples crowd deluged the
shocked team following Stanford's biggest
win since 1942.
Stanford held Arizona scoreless for the
final five minutes, handing the 20-2 Wild
cats their only Pac-10 loss of the season.
Todd Lichti scored 23 points and Howard
Wright 22 to give Stanford a 14-7 record.
Four future NBA players — Sean
Elliott, Steve Kerr, Tom Tolbert and
Anthony Cook — were in the starting line
up for Arizona, but the blue-collar defense
of Bryan McSweeney and Andrew Vlahov
shut them down in the final five minutes.
•Miracle II: Stanford 83, Arizona 78.
Leading 21-4 with 11:54 left in the first half,
it looked like the Wildcats would avenge
Miracle I and go on to conquer the world.
But Lichti scored 27 of a career-high 35

points in the second half to spur an incred
ible Stanford comeback. Stanford shot a
Maples-record 70 percent from the field
and McSweeney shut down Elliott again.
When Miracle I ended, it was Wright
who bear-hugged Lichti as the crowd
swarmed the floor. For Miracle 11, Keefe
was the first to reach the Stanford star. Will
Keefe be able to pass along the Miracle hug?
•Miracle lll?Arizona has been destroy
ing opponents of late, winning by an aver
age of 34 points per game. The Wildcats
hit 15-of-24 3-pointers in a 51-point oblit
eration of Oregon and have an endless
bench of high school ail-Americans.
"Arizona is obviously an extremely
good basketball team. They are extremely
talented and play good defense," said
Montgomery. "We're going to have to play
very well to win."
With Khalid Reeves (14.7 points per
game), Silver Spoons superstar Matt Oth
ick (10.3 ppg.) and slick swingman Chris
Mills (16.1 ppg.) the Wildcats can shoot
over any zone.
But the real reason the Wildcats have
beaten Stanford seven times in a row and
are ranked No. 7 is they have the deepest
frontline in the nation.
"The last few years they've just really
worn us down because they have so many big
guys. We've got poor Keefe out there for 40
minutes and it's tough," said Montgomery.


Matt Bateman — Daily file
Fans rush the floor after Stanford's historic 82-74 win over the top-ranked, previ
ousiy-undefeated University of Arizona on February 2,1988. A win tonight would be
the Cardinal's first over the Wildcats since 1989.
