# VonAppen: Best of both worlds
## 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
In the joyous wake of Bill
Walsh's decision to return to the
Farm, there seemed to be but one
source of minor turbulence: play
ers were worried about losing
their assistant coaches. Of course,
it goes without saying that a new
head coach has every right to
bring in the people he works with
best, but from a player's perspec
tive, assistant coaches often
become close friends and those
friendships are hard to replace.
On the offensive side of the ball
the concerns might not have been
so severe. Walsh is widely recog
nized as having one of the great
est offensive minds of all time,
plus Denny Green's system was
not likely to undergo substantial
change â€” after all, Green himself
was a Walsh protege and brought
a 49er-style offense with him.
The anxiety lay with the defen
sive veterans. Team leaders such
as Ron George and Dave Garnett
recognized the fact that coaches
coming and going was part of the

'It was like the God
father called and he
had to come back.'

business, but said that the defense
was really beginning to jell under
coordinator Willie Shaw and that
his leadership would be sorely
missed.
So in the search for a new
defensive coordinator, what was
the perfect solution? Obviously,
someone who not only had
worked successfully with Walsh,
but had some knowledge of the
Cardinal's defensive schemes and
players. Meet Fred vonAppen.
VonAppen was named Stan
ford's defensive coordinator/
defensive line coach January 30,
and was introduced by Walsh to
the media for the the first time
yesterday. VonAppen, making his
fourth tour of duty with the Car
dinal, is no stranger to the Farm.
After serving as Walsh's defensive

line coach in 1977-78, he came
back to assume the same job in
1982, and returned again in 1989
to be Green's defensive coordina
tor. VonAppen was a member of
two of Walsh's Super Bowl cham
pionship teams, coaching the
49ers special teams and defensive
line.
Walsh, as he is wont to do,
played stand up comedian while
commenting on his good friend's
return to Stanford. This time he
didn't tell us he had chosen von-
Appen after having a few too
many. Instead, Walsh joked, "it
was like the Godfather called and
he had to come back."
VonAppen, who spent the previ
ous two seasons of his 23-year
coaching career as the University
of Pittsburgh's defensive coordina
tor, said he has had a chance to
chat with seniors George, Aaron
Rembisz, and Estevan Avila,
among others in his first week on
campus. "Some of my old players
have already been getting at me,
hammering me with my old cliches
