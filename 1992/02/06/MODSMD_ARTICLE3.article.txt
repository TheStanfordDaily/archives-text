# Health program gets permanent director
## Budget cuts may hinder plans 
### Kristina Aberg Staff writer 
The newly named director of
Cowell's Health Promotion Pro
gram said she hopes to create a
"cohesive, health-oriented com
munity" at Stanford, but some of
her planned initiatives may be
stymied by the deep budget cuts
the student health center is facing.
Carole Pertofsky, a Northern
California health educator, will
take over as director of the pro
gram March 30.
She replaces Norm Robinson, a
former dean of student affairs who
served as the program's acting
director until the beginning of this
quarter. Project Risk Director
Elise Lenox will serve as interim
director until Pertofsky takes over.
While Pertofsky said she would
like to develop improved pro

grams in areas such as nutrition
and physical fitness, Cowell's pro
posed cuts include cutting its aer
obics program and combining two
nutritionist positions into one.
Other cost-cutting proposals
include reducing urgent-care
hours, a $7 or $8 quarterly student
fee and reductions in counseling
services. Cowell must reduce its
budget by $600,000.
"Carole will have to deal with
the implications of those cuts and
what programs have priority,"
said Cowell Director Harvey
Weinstein. He added that Pertof
sky may spend some of her time
soliciting outside funds.
Cowell officials said they were
pleased by the appointment of
Pertofsky, who was selected from

a field of more than 60 applicants.
"I am delighted with her," said
Lenox, who has worked with
Pertofsky in the past. "She is a
very comprehensive thinker and
can incorporate health promotion
into various areas."
According to Weinstein, Pertof
sky "is a very exciting person, very
effective and articulate and she
has experience."
While she is devoted to her pre
sent job, Pertofsky said she is
looking forward to a challenging
new position at Stanford.
According to Lenox, the health
promotion program director
"helps to provide a vision for the
whole project."
Pertofsky said she hopes to
include more student input in the

health promotion program, which
coordinates production of "The
Student Body" newsletter, among
other duties.
She said she hopes to work
with various student organiza
tions — including residences, ser
vice organizations and fraterni
ties and sororities — to help stu
dents make "a full commitment to
themselves and their potential,
academically and physically."
Another of her priorities will
include reviving the program's
student advisory board, which
once had 20 members but now
has only two. She added that the
concept of peer education will be a
focal point under her leadership.
Pertofsky also plans to main
tain current programs addressing
issues such as AIDS, sexual
assault, suicide prevention and
alcohol and substance abuse.
Pertofsky, who lives in the Bay
Area, has had extensive experi
ence in the field of health promo
tion. She began her career as a
teacher of physically disabled
children in the Oakland School
District. During this time she

developed an interest in the "well
ness" field, she said.
Pertofsky currently coordinates
the Hayward region of the
"Healthy Kids—Healthy Califor
nia" program, a project encompass
ing schools and community colleges
in seven counties.
Pertofsky was selected by a
nine-person committee. According
to Cowell Staff Physician John
Dorman, who served on the search
committee, the selection process
was "pretty straightforward."
