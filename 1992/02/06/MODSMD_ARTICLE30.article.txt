If members of the Stanford
women's tennis team did yoga,
their mantra would be "Win!"
"We want to win everything —
win every match," coach Frank
Brennan said of the Rolex
National Indoor Championships.
Today Heather Willens, Laxmi
Poruri, Kylie Johnson and Emma
Woodhouse begin the third leg of
the collegiate Grand Slam.
The Rolex follows the Clay
Court Championships and the
Ail-American Championships in
the Slam cycle. The final leg is the
NCAA Championships in May.
The Cardinal's top seed is
Heather Willens at No. 4.
Willens faces Florida's Kay
Louthian in the first round.
Laxmi Poruri is the No. 6 seed
and takes on Texas' Jackie Moe in
her first match.
Poruri and Willens form Stan
ford's biggest threat in the dou
bles' draw. The tandem made the
semifinals of the Ail-American
Championships before falling to
the second-seeded pair, Texas'
Susan Gilchrist and Vickie Payn
ter.
Johnson and Emma Wood
house are Stanford's second dou
bles entry. Johnson is also com
peting in the singles draw. How
ever, she drew a tough first round
adversary — Shannan McCarthy.
Playing indoors probably gives
McCarthy an edge because of her
serve and volley style of play, but
Johnson is used to tennis under a
roof.
"I grew up in Utah so I've
played enough hours indoors to
know what it's like," Johnson
said. "The game is a little faster
and I like playing fast tennis. I
like to play hard, coming in and
volleying. [Playing indoors] defi
nitely helps that a lot."
"We have a good team for
indoors," Brennan said. "We play
aggressive tennis .... Indoors is
faster and favors that style of
play."
