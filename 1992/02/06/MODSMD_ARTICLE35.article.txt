Mungo, this up
p an "-com/„ g Eas
" ba "d, looks
real '"e-
important in distinguishing
Fungo Mungo from other bands
they find themselves compared
to. "That's cool that we have key
boards. We can do samples and
other keyboard and organ type
stuff. ... It brings a totally origi
nal type of element to our
music."
Fungo Mungo's views about
life and the world are articulated
by Gallegos, who writes most of
the lyrics and then presents
them in a mix of singing and rap
ping.
Fungo Mungo uses a five-way
collaborative process when writ
ing songs to ensure that each

member has the opportunity to
express himself. "We all really
write good together, and we're all
totally receptive to everyone's
suggestions. ... As a whole, it
ends up being that everyone's
playing their own trip, and that is
the most important thing to mak
ing us sound the way we sound,"
Salazar explained.
The band developed their tal
ents through hard work on the
Bay Area club scene. Stanford
students may remember that
Fungo Mungo has also played
gigs on campus, including a per
formance at the Bridge Confer
ence on Psychedelics and at a
Beta party. Salazar said that
playing at Stanford was "killer"
because "those guys party."
Fungo Mungo's years of effort
recently came to fruition with a

recording contract with Island
Records. Their debut album,
"Humungous," was released last
week. While the band is "hella
stoked," as Salazar put it, to be
recording for a major label, he
quickly added that "the music
business is a trippy thing. . . . I'm
not used to dealing with all the
heavy business, 'cause I'm twen
ty-one, and I really haven't done
anything like that, up until this
point."
Fungo Mungo just embarked
on a month-long midwestern
tour and will begin another tour
after a week's vacation in the Bay
Area. Keep an eye out for them
because, as Salazar explained,
"When you come see Fungo,
rock'n'roll is going to set the
night on fire, you know? That's
what it is, really."

Mungo, this up

" ba "d, looks
real '"e-
important in distinguishing
Fungo Mungo from other bands
they find themselves compared
to. "That's cool that we have key
boards. We can do samples and
other keyboard and organ type
stuff. ... It brings a totally origi
nal type of element to our
music."
Fungo Mungo's views about
life and the world are articulated
by Gallegos, who writes most of
the lyrics and then presents
them in a mix of singing and rap
ping.
Fungo Mungo uses a five-way
collaborative process when writ
ing songs to ensure that each

member has the opportunity to
express himself. "We all really
write good together, and we're all
totally receptive to everyone's
suggestions. ... As a whole, it
ends up being that everyone's
playing their own trip, and that is
the most important thing to mak
ing us sound the way we sound,"
Salazar explained.
The band developed their tal
ents through hard work on the
Bay Area club scene. Stanford
students may remember that
Fungo Mungo has also played
gigs on campus, including a per
formance at the Bridge Confer
ence on Psychedelics and at a
Beta party. Salazar said that
playing at Stanford was "killer"
because "those guys party."
Fungo Mungo's years of effort
recently came to fruition with a

recording contract with Island
Records. Their debut album,
"Humungous," was released last
week. While the band is "hella
stoked," as Salazar put it, to be
recording for a major label, he
quickly added that "the music
business is a trippy thing. . . . I'm
not used to dealing with all the
heavy business, 'cause I'm twen
ty-one, and I really haven't done
anything like that, up until this
point."
Fungo Mungo just embarked
on a month-long midwestern
tour and will begin another tour
after a week's vacation in the Bay
Area. Keep an eye out for them
because, as Salazar explained,
"When you come see Fungo,
rock'n'roll is going to set the
night on fire, you know? That's
what it is, really."
