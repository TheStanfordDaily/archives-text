# Album makes for 'Humungous' fun
## 
### Jennifer Maxwell 
Fungo Mungo's debut album
"Humungous" proves that it's
possible to be socially conscious
while having a hell of a good time.
This is music for people who
love to get down, but hate the
"Club MTV" drivel usually
offered up for dancing. Drum
mer Jeff Gomes and bassist
Arion Salazar provide a funky
and highly danceable beat.
Their groove is given a harder
edge by Mike Johnson's driving
guitar. Damon Ramirez uses his
keyboards to decorate the work
of the other instruments.
Ramirez makes "Downtown
Oakland" a standout on the
album by adding flavor with
synthesized Latin percussion.
Vocalist Damion Gallegos uses a
rapping-style vocal to conjure
up a picture of urban disaster in
"Downtown Oakland," but
more often he is found singing
with a sexy howl.
But Fungo Mungo wants to
do more than just put up a good
groove. This band has an equal
priority in commenting on prob
lems they see in the world.
To that end, Fungo Mungo
takes on TV evangelists in "Do

You Believe in God?" The
stereotypical voice of a televan
gelist booms over the music,
"Gimme a call now at 1-800-
JESUS-CHRIST! Put it on your
Visa . . . ."
Gallegos musters all his
indignation to growl on behalf
of the suckered, "What about
the money that I gave to be sure
that I was saved/Now I'm alone
and afraid."
As they frequently do on
"Humungous," Fungo Mungo is
able to add a little comic relief to
the depressing reality of the
lyrics. In this case, the preacher
is caught joyously announcing,
"We have collected over six mil
lion, six hundred and sixty-six
thousand dollars."
Chief lyricist Gallegos also
addresses the issues of peace
("Brothers and Sisters") and
the influence of media hype on
public opinion ("Hype is
Stupid") with intelligence and
conviction.
In the end however, it is virtu
ally impossible to sit and reflect
on the lyrics of Damion Gallegos
without eventually being moved
from your seat by the groove set

down by his
cohorts.
