# Farrah Fawcett is still passe, but wheeled feet are hip again
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
Two decades after the Farrah Fawcett look-alikes on
wheels disappeared from boardwalks and Roller Disco
faded out with the Bee Gees, someone decided to put those
four wheels in a straight line. Rollerblading was born.
In-line skating — more commonly called "rollerblad
ing" after the company which introduced the sport — can
be seen everywhere at Stanford. Bouncing off the stairs
near Braun, zooming through White Plaza or creeping
sideways up the steps to class, rollerbladers abound.
In-line skates are sleeker and faster than their '70s
counterparts, and, as most rollerbladers on campus will
tell you, more fun.
"They're exciting," said sophomore Adrienne Mocello,
who bought her own pair of blades three weeks ago. "It
feels like you're flying. It's all the speed of running, but
none of the pain."
Mocello said she first discovered rollerblading when she
went skating with some friends last spring. While Mocello
and one friend had traditional rollerskates, the rest had in
line skates.
She immediately noticed the advantages of rollerblades.
"They're just so much more effortless and so much faster
than our rollerskates were," she observed. She needed only
to borrow a friend's rollerblades a couple of times before
she decided to get her own.
Senior Jason Gische noted that his rollerblades are a
fun and cheap alternative to bicycling. "I can use my

rollerblades everywhere," he said, including going to and
from class.
Gische, who started rollerblading over a year ago, said
at first he got strange looks from people when skating
around campus. But lately, he said, "the number of
rollerbladers in general has increased, and a lot more peo
ple are rollerblading to class. ... I think everyone's used to
it now."
Most rollerbladers will tell you in-line skating is a great
way to get exercise. Junior Tom Costa said he rollerblades
as a way to cross-train for cycling.
Gische added, "It works your inner and outer thighs
and butt" — something most sports are hard-pressed to
do.
A pair of in-line skates costs anywhere from $40 for
strictly beginning, recreational skating, up to $270 for the
top-of-the line Rollerblade model. Most Stanford skaters
opt for Rollerblade's Lightning model, which costs around
$150.
Rollerblade owners and dealers everywhere recommend
purchasing a pair of wrist guards, velcro gloves that sand

wich your hand and wrist between two pieces of plastic or
metal, before hitting the streets.
They're well worth the $20 they cost, as wrist injuries
are by far the most common type among rollerbladers.
Knee and elbow pads add protection against scratches and
scrapes.
And if you're not sure you're ready to take the
rollerblading plunge and purchase your own pair, many
places in the area offer rentals. The Pacific Mountaineer in
downtown Palo Alto and Courtesy Sports in Los Altos both
charge $10 a day.
The campus offers a variety of places to test your
skfltes. By far the most popular choice for smooth, flat
skating is the area in front of the Physics Tank. Many
Stanford skaters also recommend the walkways along the
Inner Quad and the streets along the faculty ghetto.
Places to avoid include anything wet, rocky or uneven.
The worst spot on campus has to be the infamous inter
section between the Clock Tower and the Quad, where
potholes and gravel are menacing enough even without the
bikes racing by in every direction.
If you want to take your rollerblading adventure off
campus, Golden Gate Park is a skater's dream on Sundays,
when all the streets in the park are closed to traffic.
Will rollerblades go the way of lava lamps and velvet
Elvis pictures? "I haven't seen any signs of rollerblading
dying," Gische said.
Pacific Mountaineer employee and rollerblader Cliff
Hudson added, "It doesn't look like a fad. I think it's here
to stay."
