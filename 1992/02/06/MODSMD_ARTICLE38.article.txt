# Griffith types while Hitler strikes

Melanie Griffith is a secretary
again.
But in "Shining Through," her
character, Linda Voss, is much
more outspoken and blunt than
the secretary she played in
"Working Girl."
This time she plunges into a
Mata Hari lifestyle.
When one of the American
spies working for her boss
(Michael Douglas) is killed, Linda
volunteers to take his place in
Nazi Germany as a spy, although
she doesn't even know how to use
a gun.
Of course, she has never been
out of New York, but the film
expects you to believe that if she
can speak the language, everyone
will assume she is German.
The film, set in Nazi Germany,
is attractive and well-shot,
although too predictable at times.

Linda volunteers to take his place in Nazi
Germany as a spy, although she doesn't
even know how to use a gun.

Director David Seltzer uses
stereotypes to build the storyline
of the movie, and for that reason
it falls a bit flat.
From the outset, we know that
Griffith is going to fall in love
with her boss, and the trend of
predictability only worsens.
In one overly embellished
scene, the train travels from
sunny and light Switzerland into
a German train station that
looks like Darth Vader's lair, full
of soldiers marching like ants.
Simplified scenes such as these
makes the movie just another
spy thriller because Seltzer
makes little effort to develop
something creative from a well
worn plot.

However, the film does man
age to be entertaining, since the
final outcome remains a mystery
until the end. This suspense
draws you in and keeps you inter
ested despite the stereotypes.
Douglas' performance is
good, although the role is not too
demanding. He plays the typical
Douglas character, an outwardly
hard man who doesn't show his
feelings but really has a heart of
gold. Unlike Humphrey Bogart
in "Casablanca," he can't bring
himself to abandon his loved
one.
Although "Shining Through"
is nothing out of the ordinary, it
is perfect for an evening of escape
from day-to-day life.
