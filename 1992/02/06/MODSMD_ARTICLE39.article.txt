# It's the 'End of the World,' and director Wim Wender feels fine
## 
### Brad Bruner Staff writer 
Continuing the recent trend of long films that put
patience to the test, Wim Wenders' "Until the End of
the World" has arrived.
Released last summer in Europe to very mixed
reactions, "World" is Wenders' futuristic attempt to
combine three metaphors into an overambitious epic
road-movie.
Initially, we are catapulted to the ends of the earth
with the French adventuress Claire Tourneur
(Solveig Dommartin). Claire falls for the American
Sam Faber (William Hurt), a dashing fugitive who
soon disappears with some of her ill-gotten gains.
The chase begins across a European landscape of
dark postmodern tones and the blinding lights of a
newly-bustling Asia.
At the same time Wenders ("Paris, Texas,"
"Wings of Desire") spins an apocalyptic background
of tension over the impending end of the world. The
planet seems poised for nuclear doom as a result of a
catastrophe involving a spy satellite.
With virtually no place left to go, the two adven
turers reach the Australian outback. Here Faber
moves one step further on his journey. He is deter

mined to penetrate the inner world of the senses and
ultimately of the soul.
The core of this entire global romp turns out to be
Faber's quest to record visual images of family and
friends on a futuristic Viewmaster-like video
recorder which promises to give his blind mother
(Jeane Moreau) the chance to see them.
Though chock-full of futuristic technology like
self-driving cars and over-the-counter truth serums,
this film ultimately shows a world out of order. None
of these machines seem to work correctly, including
the one Faber uses. Technology, rather than helping
us interface, ends up alienating everyone from every
thing.
As always, Wenders' images are vast, cool and dis
turbing. The booming modern rock soundtrack that
drives the film along is excellent, adding a sense of
continuity here even when the film's editing doesn't.
Though Wender's interconnecting allegories
sound well-developed in principle, they often grind
together uncomfortably on the screen. Though the
film does have the seductive feel of a dreamscape, it
is hard to lose the sensation that it's someone else's
convoluted dream we are watching. The dream may
sometimes be beautiful and thrilling, but it's not that
involving.
