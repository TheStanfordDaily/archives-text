# Budget cuts top Fac Sen talks
## Unusual Bookstore perks may also be discussed 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate will return
to an all too familiar topic during
this afternoon's meeting — bud
get cuts.
Today's meeting will be devot
ed almost exclusively to dis
cussing the budget plans submit
ted by the schools and adminis
trative areas almost two weeks
ago as the University works to
produce a $43-million reduction
proposal.
"I don't think that it is possible
to predict" what will come up or
how long the meeting will last,
said History Prof. James Shee
han, the senate chair. "People
have things on their minds . . .
and we will have to wait and see
what comes up."
It is also likely that the senate
will spend time discussing yester
day's Daily report on its investiga
tion of the Stanford Bookstore,
which revealed unusual perks for
the non-profit corporation's top
managers.
Although the topic is not on the

agenda, Sheehan did say it was a
possible topic of conversation. "I
have no idea," he said. "We will
just have to wait and see."
To begin the senate's budget
discussion, Provost James Rosse
will be discussing the upcoming
plans for the Cabinet Committee
on Budget and Strategic Plan
ning.
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare,
chair of the Faculty Senate Com
mittee on Education and Scholar
ship at Stanford, will be explain
ing "phase two" of the budget
planning process.
"Phase two" is a post-budget
cutting reassessment of the ways
in which Stanford's schools are
organized.
Zare and his committee are
strong proponents of discussing
ways of "reshaping the Universi
ty." Among ideas the committee
wants to consider are splitting up
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences into three schools and
switching departments between
schools.
After the presentations, fac
ulty members will begin evalua

tion of the budget proposals in
terms of the six cross-cutting
themes currently being studied
by the cabinet budget task
forces — undergraduate and
graduate education, diversity,
research, support services and
the arts.
"The purpose will be to raise
questions for the task forces to
think about," Sheehan said. "It
will be an effective way of commu
nicating with them."
Cabinet committee members,
vice presidents and deans have
been asked to attend today's
meeting and field questions.
"Everyone here is looking for
ward to the meeting" and hearing
the senate discussion, said Ted
Mitchell, deputy to the president
and provost.
At the last meeting two weeks
ago, University President Donald
Kennedy suggested that the senate
steering committee should consid
er setting guidelines on the upcom
ing debate, restricting it to more
general concerns.
But Sheehan said the meeting
will be "guided by the concerns of
faculty."
And if tomorrow's meeting

proves to be too short to address
all of the senate's concerns, a spe
cial budget meeting has already
been scheduled for next Thursday.
The last time the senate sched
uled a special meeting during its
off-week was last October to dis
cuss the budget-reduction tar
gets.
