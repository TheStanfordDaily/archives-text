# Picking up the rice
## Life, love and loneliness in the fast lane 
### 
I used to love Legos. Mom used to invest in
those monster Alan Shepherd motif sets
instead of day care. It probably wasn't
such a great idea in retrospect, but, then
again, growing up in New Jersey, maybe it
was safer. ,
My parents used to have to blackmail m&
into playing with other kids; something about
this love letter to my third grade teacher they
found in my desk drawer — pretty cheap stuff
to be pulling on an eight-year-old, but effec
tive nonetheless. Anyway, every Wednesday I
agreed to be transported to some stranger's
house to play Atari or Monopoly until either it
was dinner-time or he decisively beat me up.
They even made me join a bowling league,
the suburban answer to the literary circle. All
it did was make me feel like a socially dys
functional Barney Rubble.
But whenever given the chance, I would
close the door to my room, break out the Lin
coln Logs©, Legos™, Capsella® — whichever
was relatively appropriate for my age group
— and, quite literally, go to town.
By the time I left for college, however, I was
fully acclimated into the insecure teenage
world of constant reaffirmation. I had become
completely accustomed to waiting around Fri
day and Saturday nights for a call from a
bunch of 17-year-old males who had all but
officially given up on attracting the opposite
sex.
So when I left for college, I was pretty
scared. What if I couldn't find a group of equal
ly unattractive post-pubescent males? What if
no one wanted to square dance with me? What
if nobody besides this Dean Jean woman
thought I was "super"? What if I was alone?
That first week I took a lot of walks alone to
the post office. Everybody else was chasing
after the Band like a bunch of overzealous
mice badly in need of a music appreciation
class, desperately ti-ying to figure out if they
really had a Fire Within them. But eventually
I joined in all the freshman games. I got
dragged to dorm programs about the Myth of
the Female Vietnamese Temper or some other
cultural stereotype I'd never heard of. I went

to fraternity parties so I could talk to my hall
mates in a brand new setting and whisper
things like, "Hey, I think that girl is in my CIV
class."
But now I know better. I'd never be fool
enough to call a woman a girl. And I'd never
try to find truth in a vat of hefty-bag-lined
liquid called "Passion Punch."
It took me a full year to become used to life
here, to stop feeling so alone. I never found a
new group of people who I could count on to
spend weekend nights driving aimlessly,
searching for non-existent parties. I'm start
ing to understand how those things, which
seemed so desperately necessary at one point,
start to fade without you even minding.
So I decided not to go home last summer.
Instead, I went to Paradise, California, where
I knew not a soul, to work for a newspaper
neither I nor any other civilized being had
ever heard of.
I was more frightened than I'd ever been in
my life. Scareder than the first day of Kinder
garten. Scareder than when that spider was
on Peter's chest. And in my panic I even for
got to bring my Legos.
Ppictured sitting at a desk alone every day,
talking to nobody and typing inane press
releases about complaints of dry grass raised
at Cemetery District meetings. I pictured

nights alone at the laundromat, pathetically
trying to look at women's undergarments in
the dryer until I pulled a neck muscle.
But after a couple of weeks I learned to get
.along. I read the first half of "The Brothers
|Karamazov," became a rather well-known
112 guy at the local Blockbuster and even made a
couple friends in what Paradisians know as
, the Mecca to the East, Chico.
And to be honest, something about getting
along on my own felt really good. Making
spaghetti for myself every night without any
one's help. Calling up people I had just met
and inviting them to go see the third-run
movies that came to Paradise. It's not like I
wanted to live that way forever, or even for
more than 10 weeks, but I really started to dig
the whole Magnum P.1.-self-sufficient-bache
lor scene.
And now I'm back at Stanford with my
very own single I acquired as a consolation
prize for having spent two of my three guar
anteed years in Governor's Corner. And, in
some ways, I feel as alone as ever. There's no
freshman hall, no parents, no insecure 17-year
olds — except for those rare, lucky weekends.
(Just wanted to beat that "Lighter Side" guy
to the first Stuart Thomas joke of the new
year.)
Hey, given the choice, I'd rather have
someone there for me, someone I could count
on no matter what, but maybe that isn't real
istic right now, or ever. Even if it was, I won
der what I'd be giving up in order to get it.
So for a while, I'll sort out this whole
Eleanor Rigby concept and hope that this
loneliness subsides, and strengthens me in
the meantime.
Scary as it may seem, I'm starting to
understand why people get married.
It's almost enough to make a guy want to
cut his ear off.

Joel Stein wants to know if the money he
spent on the Aeneid earns him a time share.
His column appears here weekly now that
we've conveniently disposed of that pesky
Harris kid.

And to be honest, something about getting
along on my own felt really good. Making
spaghetti for myself every night without any
one's help. Calling up people I had just met
and inviting them to go see the third-run
movies that came to Paradise. It's not like I
wanted to live that way forever, or even for
more than 10 weeks, but I really started to dig
the whole Magnum P.1.-self-sufficient-bache
lor scene.
And now I'm back at Stanford with my
very own single I acquired as a consolation
prize for having spent two of my three guar
anteed years in Governor's Corner. And, in
some ways, I feel as alone as ever. There's no
freshman hall, no parents, no insecure 17-year
olds — except for those rare, lucky weekends.
(Just wanted to beat that "Lighter Side" guy
to the first Stuart Thomas joke of the new
year.)
Hey, given the choice, I'd rather have
someone there for me, someone I could count
on no matter what, but maybe that isn't real
istic right now, or ever. Even if it was, I won
der what I'd be giving up in order to get it.
So for a while, I'll sort out this whole
Eleanor Rigby concept and hope that this
loneliness subsides, and strengthens me in
the meantime.
Scary as it may seem, I'm starting to
understand why people get married.
It's almost enough to make a guy want to
cut his ear off.

Joel Stein wants to know if the money he
spent on the Aeneid earns him a time share.

Harris kid.


Joel Stein
The Tao to Nowhere
I used to love Legos. Mom used to invest in
those monster Alan Shepherd motif sets
instead of day care. It probably wasn't
such a great idea in retrospect, but, then
again, growing up in New Jersey, maybe it
was safer. ,
My parents used to have to blackmail m&
into playing with other kids; something about
this love letter to my third grade teacher they
found in my desk drawer — pretty cheap stuff
to be pulling on an eight-year-old, but effec
tive nonetheless. Anyway, every Wednesday I
agreed to be transported to some stranger's
house to play Atari or Monopoly until either it
was dinner-time or he decisively beat me up.
They even made me join a bowling league,
the suburban answer to the literary circle. All
it did was make me feel like a socially dys
functional Barney Rubble.
But whenever given the chance, I would
close the door to my room, break out the Lin
coln Logs©, Legos™, Capsella® — whichever
was relatively appropriate for my age group
— and, quite literally, go to town.
By the time I left for college, however, I was
fully acclimated into the insecure teenage
world of constant reaffirmation. I had become
completely accustomed to waiting around Fri
day and Saturday nights for a call from a
bunch of 17-year-old males who had all but
officially given up on attracting the opposite
sex.
So when I left for college, I was pretty
scared. What if I couldn't find a group of equal
ly unattractive post-pubescent males? What if
no one wanted to square dance with me? What
if nobody besides this Dean Jean woman
thought I was "super"? What if I was alone?
That first week I took a lot of walks alone to
the post office. Everybody else was chasing
after the Band like a bunch of overzealous
mice badly in need of a music appreciation
class, desperately ti-ying to figure out if they
really had a Fire Within them. But eventually
I joined in all the freshman games. I got
dragged to dorm programs about the Myth of
the Female Vietnamese Temper or some other
cultural stereotype I'd never heard of. I went

to fraternity parties so I could talk to my hall
mates in a brand new setting and whisper
things like, "Hey, I think that girl is in my CIV
class."
But now I know better. I'd never be fool
enough to call a woman a girl. And I'd never
try to find truth in a vat of hefty-bag-lined
liquid called "Passion Punch."
It took me a full year to become used to life
here, to stop feeling so alone. I never found a
new group of people who I could count on to
spend weekend nights driving aimlessly,
searching for non-existent parties. I'm start
ing to understand how those things, which
seemed so desperately necessary at one point,
start to fade without you even minding.
So I decided not to go home last summer.
Instead, I went to Paradise, California, where
I knew not a soul, to work for a newspaper
neither I nor any other civilized being had
ever heard of.
I was more frightened than I'd ever been in
my life. Scareder than the first day of Kinder
garten. Scareder than when that spider was
on Peter's chest. And in my panic I even for
got to bring my Legos.
Ppictured sitting at a desk alone every day,
talking to nobody and typing inane press
releases about complaints of dry grass raised
at Cemetery District meetings. I pictured

nights alone at the laundromat, pathetically
trying to look at women's undergarments in
the dryer until I pulled a neck muscle.
But after a couple of weeks I learned to get
.along. I read the first half of "The Brothers
|Karamazov," became a rather well-known
112 guy at the local Blockbuster and even made a
couple friends in what Paradisians know as
, the Mecca to the East, Chico.
And to be honest, something about getting
along on my own felt really good. Making
