# Knopfler's playing stuck in Dire Straits
## 
### Val Masters 
Without emotion, music
becomes muzak, Mark Knopfler
becomes Phil Collins and the
$28 I spent on Dire Straits' live
show this past Saturday
becomes "money for nothing."
At the first of two shows in
Oakland over the last weekend,
guitarist Mark Knopfler
proved that Dire Straits is no
longer the vehicle for his
music, nor are arenas the set
ting for his playing. Both the
band's surprising new album
"On Every Street" and the life
less insincerity of the current
show highlight the divergence
between Knopfler's current
musical direction and audience
expectations.
But Saturday's show was
more than just a two-hour
musical vacuum. It was a per
fect example of what happens
when an artist sacrifices his
own musical direction and
vision in order to satisfy the
audience's conception of the
same. And in the end, both par
ties suffer from what is essen
tially a lack of trust.
Though Knopfler attempted
to inject life into older songs
like "Telegraph Road" and
"Romeo and Juliet," it was
obvious from his playing and
singing that his older material
no longer elicits from him the
raging emotional response it
once used to. Knopfler even
rejected his trademark strato
caster whose inherently dual
tone — an icy steeliness con
trasted with a silky warmth —
graces nearly every cut on Dire
Straits' first four albums.
Songs like "Planet of New
Orleans" and "On Every

Street" from the new album
highlighted the evening and
pulsed with a moody subtlety.
Unfortunately, the audience's
reception of these songs was
the same. Knopfler probably
anticipated this reaction
because the rest of the set
relied heavily on proven hits
and was D.O.A. The stillness
of the auditorium throughout
most of the show was deadly,
and Knopfler obviously
noticed.
About halfway through the
show Knopfler basically apolo
gized for the band's comatose
performance when he admitted
that it was only the fourth
show of their ensuing world
wide trek, and that his new
eight-piece band was still
warming up to the tour. He
even joked about the fact that
his lack of playing had left him
without calluses on his guitar
hand.
First, whatever happened to
rehearsing prior to the tour?
Second, at what point did Dire
Straits become Earth, Wind &
Fire, where it becomes neces
sary to have a total of nine peo
ple on stage? To make matters
worse, the band, which includ
ed two keyboardists and a tim
bales player, never once distin
guished themselves as any
thing more than studio musi
cians.
Still, in many ways,
Knopfler's apology was the
most honest moment of the
evening.
Like most instruments, a
guitar in the hands of someone
like Carlos Santana or the late
Stevie Ray Vaughan becomes
