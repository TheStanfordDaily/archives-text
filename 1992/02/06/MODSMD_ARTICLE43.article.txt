# SHAC brings homeless to campus
## 
### Ed Heinemann Staff writer 
"It's been really rewarding."
That phrase usually comes across as a pub
lic service cliche, perfunctory words mouthed
to prove that the volunteer has gained some
thing from the experience. But when the
words come from the mouth of Dave Back
man, a self-described "semi-homeless" mem
ber of the Theater of the Homeless, they can't
help but pack a more substantial punch.
And in the group, a local theater troupe
dedicated to bringing true stories about
homelessness to the general public, Backman
isn't even an anomaly. Of the eight members,
five are still bouncing between shelters and
the streets — including a Vietnam veteran
and an eight-year-old girl.
As Backman puts it, "we use real people
that have been homeless to tell their stories,
rather than putting a pie chart on stage and
pointing at it and saying that people fit into
certain molds. It's really a powerful vehicle to
put the issue right in front of people. People
find that it's very real."
For Backman, that "reality" has included
drinking binges, sporadic unemployment and

"two years of homelessness spread over ten
years."
But when he was approached at his volun
teer post at the Urban Ministry of Palo Alto
last year and become part of the cast, his
prospects for stability began to look more
promising.
As part of his involvement with the The
ater, Backman gets a small salary for helping
with administrative tasks. The job might not
seem like much when compared to his past
employment in the electronics industry — he
has a bachelor's degree from Portland State
University in Oregon — but it takes a lot of
effort, he says, and gives him a lot in return.
"Having been there myself, it's a very strong
subject for me."
Backman is saving all of his salary in hopes
of renting a room at some point in the next
few months. Audience donations, collected at
each performance, also help to keep the group
afloat by covering expenses for food, clothing
and a bus pass.
With the additional help of grants from the
Hewlett Foundation, the Theater of the
Homeless seems to have a fair shot at making
it. Despite little publicity, the group has two
shows scheduled each week through April

and ambitious plans for the future.
A tape of one of the group's performances
is currently being mixed for broadcast on
public radio, and an amateur photographer
has been recruited to film the group, with
hcpes of their appearing on public television.
And with the widespread economic malaise
produced by the recession, the Theater is
looking to expand its vision of the homeless
experience.
"It's rough out there right now," Backman
says."I talked to someone in mechanical
engineering who's even having trouble right
now. We're looking for people who feel like
they're living on the edge; that's a very com
mon experience these days. There are a lot of
people in the Valley who are one or two pay
checks away from the street."
Backman himself still is on the street, and
like the small but lively theater group that
has given him a job and a voice, he's doing
everything he can to change that.

Theater of the Homeless will be performing at
Ricker Dining Hall at 7 p.m. on Friday as
part of SHAC's "Face the Music: Raising
Awareness About Homelessness Through the
Arts" week.
