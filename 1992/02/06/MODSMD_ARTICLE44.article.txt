# Bobs get down with Fleet Street Singers
## 
### Michael Green Staff writer 
Instead of the usual flying
paper wads, the voices of the
Bobs, accompanied by Stanford's
Fleet Street Singers, will fill the
air in Mem Aud this Saturday.
The Bobs are an a cappella
foursome based in San Francisco,
but they have taken their act
across the country and the world.
Known for their atypical sense of
humor and the diversity of their
music, the Bobs have become
local favorites in their ten years
of performing together.
For some, it is the unique
voice manipulation characteris
tics of the group that keeps them
buying albums. Others are
moved by the odd lyrics to some
of their original pieces — the
titles include "My, I'm Large,"
"Banana Love" and "Bulky
Rhythm." Most of their music is
written by group member
Richard Greene, and the arrange
ments are done by the whole
group.
The group's success earned
them a Grammy Award nomina

tion in 1985 for their arrange
ment of "Helter Skelter." They
also made two appearances on
"The Tonight Show" in 1990.
Fleet Street is "excited to per
form with a professional group,"
according to Fleet Street member
and business manager Chad
Dyer. "It's something that has
never been done before."
One of the reasons Fleet
Street wanted to perform with
the Bobs, Dyer explained, is
because they are such a unique
sounding group and "their ran
dom humor element is along the
lines of our taste."
Anyone who has missed Fleet
Street this fall should make it a
point to see them now. Opening
for the Bobs, Fleet Street will
perform mostly new arrange
ments, but they will also do
revivals of old favorites from ear
lier years. An original composi
tion by group member Jason
Mayland is also set for its debut.

The Bobs and the Fleet Street
Singers will perform in Memorial
Auditorium this Saturday, Feb.
8, at 8 p.m.
