# Rabois' comments on 'faggots' derided across University
## Slurs to cottage bring reaction 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
The homophobic slurs hurled
by first-year law student Keith
Rabois toward the cottage of
Otero Resident Fellow Dennis
Matthies have come under fire in
dorm discussions and on Law
School bulletin boards, with
Rabois himself emerging as the
target of angry community mem
bers who say they are exercising
their own right to free speech.
The incident, which occurred
Jan. 19 but was disclosed late last
week, involved three students
who were walking through Otero
that Sunday night. After exiting
the dorm lounge, one of the stu
dents began screaming "Faggot!
Hope you die of AIDS!" and
"Can't wait 'til you die, faggot!"
in the direction of the RF cottage,
according to William Shepherd,
the head advising associate in
Otero and one of the witnesses to
the incident.
Shepherd, who later identified
two of the students, said he heard
one voice making the homophobic
remarks, but could not identify
whose voice it was. One of those
students named the third student
at the scene, according to Dean of
Students Michael Jackson.
Two of the students denied
making homophobic comments.
Rabois said one of them did not
make the remarks. On Tuesday,
that student, in turn, absolved the
other, but not Rabois.
Rabois, in an unpublished let
ter to The Daily, said he took a
shortcut through Otero that
night, and"I proceeded to make
comments similar to those report
ed in The Daily."
He said in an interview earlier
in the week that some of the com
ments were directed at Matthies,
but they "were mostly about fag
gots being bad in general."
In his letter, he wrote: "I truly
don't care nor think too much
about the issue (of homosexuali
ty). I don't necessarily hate homo
sexuals, but do believe in Jack
Kemp's suggestion that they may
not be the best teachers of young
children in public schools and rec
ognize that the spread of AIDS
has a direct causal link back to
their activity."
Rabois could not be brought up
on Fundamental Standard charges
by the University, because the
standard applies only to face-to
face discriminatory harassment
made by one student to another.

Matthies was not in his cottage at
the time of the incident.
Officials went public
Powerless to prosecute Rabois,
University officials released a
statement denouncing his actions
and presenting the incident as a
target for public condemnation.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson said yesterday he decided
to write a public letter to the com
munity because "the incident was
already a very public event." Only
a few students had witnessed the
incident, however.
According to Jackson, "I wrote
the letter to point out that what
happened was mean and vicious
and needed strong condemnation
from someone in the University.
"There's a question of how we
should react as a community, and
whether we should always go to
the rulebook," Jackson said.
The decision to step outside the

judicial process
has received
praise from many
students.
"I think the
administration
did exactly the
right thing be
cause [the inci
dent] should be
discussed " said

wwvnwvii U lOWUOOLU, OMIU
Eleanor Feingold, coordinator of
the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center. "I think it
sparked meaningful discussion and
makes more people aware that
there are issues of homosexuality
on the Stanford campus."
And Residence Dean Angela
Rickford also welcomed the dis
cussion. "We've got to learn to
talk to each other without insult
ing each other, even if we hate
what each other stands for. That
is the essence of a vibrant univer
sity atmosphere."
"Rabois has said that he has first
amendment speech rights â€” now
others are saying 'so do we, and we
have the right to challenge what
you say,'" Jackson said. "In an
open and free society it's important,
useful and educational to express
yourself. I just wish we could keep
discussion on a higher plane."
Signed, sealed and delivered
A letter from Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson was deliv
ered to The Daily last Friday.
The letter, which contained no
names, condemned the actions of


Jackson
