# Fire damages offices on Stanford property

A two-alarm blaze ravaged a
high-rise building at the Uni
versity-owned Palo Alto Square
office complex early yesterday
morning, causing an estimated
$375,000 in damages.
Although the University
owns the complex, Stanford
will not be financially responsi
ble for repairs, officials said.
The fire, which began
around 3:45 a.m., consumed
about 1,200 square feet on the
ground floor of the building,
which is located at 3000 El
Camino Real. All 10 floors of
the building sustained exten
sive smoke damage.
An investigation into the
cause of the fire is continuing,
but a portable space heater is
probably to blame, according to
officials at the Palo Alto Fire
Department.
Although some employees of
the law firm that occupied the
building speculated that arson
or a bomb caused the fire, fire

fighters have ruled out those
possibilities.
Lessees assume responsibili
ty for possible damages when
they lease buildings, according
to John Miller, asset manager
at the Stanford Management
Company. The company is
responsible for managing all
properties owned by Stanford,
including Palo Alto Square and
the Shopping Center.
"We'll probably be involved
with coordinating the repair
efforts," Miller said. "But
beyond that, the responsibility
lies with the tenants."
The ground floor was occu
pied by the word processing/
support services department of
the law firm of Wilson, Sonsini,
Goodrich and Rosati.
Portions of the building were
reopened by early Wednesday
morning, and cleanup efforts
are already underway. Wilson,
Sonsini, Goodrich and Rosati
also have offices in the other
high-rise in the office complex
and were able to conduct busi
ness from there yesterday.
