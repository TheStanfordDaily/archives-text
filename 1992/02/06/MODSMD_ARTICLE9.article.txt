# Back from the USSR Reporters describe life in Russia
## 
### Craig Kersemeier 
The people Ann Cooper met in
Russia didn't fit the old stereo
type of the gloomy Russian lack
ing initiative — they were active
and motivated.
"Sometimes I wondered if they
were really Russians," the former
Moscow National Public Radio
correspondent told an audience of
100 in Tresidder Union's Oak
Lounge yesterday.
Cooper and fellow Moscow cor
respondent Bill Keller shared a
series of anecdotal snapshots of the
Russian people gathered during
their five years in the capital city.
Menlo Park native Keller, who
won a Pulitzer Prize in 1989 for
his work in Moscow, began the
presentation by noting that he
and Cooper did not plan on giving
any "profound message," but
rather would offer "sketches" of
Russians they met.
"There's more to the USSR
than Gorbachev, Yeltsin and the
empty shop windows we see on
television," said Keller, an ex-New
York Times Moscow bureau chief.
Cooper began by telling of the
Lukashovs, a young couple with
four daughters. Frustrated by years
of living in an apartment too small

for state standards, they spurred
change through "guerilla tactics."
After complaints, letters and
meetings with local officials
failed, the couple's threat of a
hunger strike in Red Square and
the embarrassment it would
cause the Communist party moti
vated the party to place the
Lukashovs in a new apartment
building, originally intended sole
ly for party members.
Cooper's second "snapshot"
gave a glimpse of the new Russian
entrepreneurs.
She described a former Commu
nist party member who took
advantage of the legalization of pri
vate business to open an "old fash
ioned five-and-dime store."
Although people in the blue collar
neighborhood were "wary of the
new entrepreneur," his store's reli
ability eventually won them over.
The resourceful businessman
admitted to Cooper that "bribery is
his greatest expense," noting that
such under-the-table approaches
to business are needed to keep
essential goods on his shelf.
Like most Russians, Constan
tine Pavlov initially expressed his
distress and his country's need

Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter William Keller, former Moscow
bureau chief of the New York Times, said we must "never forget the
horrors" Russia has endured. Keller spoke with National Public
Radio correspondent Ann Cooper as part of a series presented by
the Center for Russian and East European Studies.
for aid, Cooper said. When pressed
he revealed that he could obtain
food through his job at a state
farm and had a stash that included
a pig, rabbits and a ton of potatoes.
"Such a large reserve is obvi
ously the exception rather than
the rule," Cooper stressed, but
she said that most people either
have some food in reserve or have
access to people who do.
Keller gave what he called a
"more disquieting view" of the
modern Russia.
Many older Russians, reluctant
to change after years of digesting
Communist doctrines, are sitting
around "nursing war stories and
waiting for someone to tell them
what to do," Keller said.
He told of a factory worker and
Communist party member who —
despite an "ornery pride" that led

him to defend fellow members who
read forbidden books — retained a
fierce loyalty to the party.
The worker blamed the Soviet
Union's lack of development after
World War II on the United
States for pushing the USSR into
an arms race and on Stalin's
"admirable" policy of "refusing to
accept charity from capitalists."
The Cossack revival, a right
wing Russian nationalist move
ment that has risen in response to
the nationalism sweeping the for
mer Soviet states, demonstrates
what Keller sees as "the symptoms
of a neurotic and unstable society."
One Cossack leader, a "chilly
figure" Keller repeatedly compared
to David Duke, capitalizes on eth
nic hatred and directs the Cossacks
toward violent vigilante action.
Keller reminded the audience
of the "incredible resilience" of
the Russian people and said that
they should "never forget the hor
rors that country has been sub
jected to."

He told of a factory worker and
Communist party member who —
despite an "ornery pride" that led

him to defend fellow members who
read forbidden books — retained a
fierce loyalty to the party.
The worker blamed the Soviet
Union's lack of development after
World War II on the United
States for pushing the USSR into
an arms race and on Stalin's
"admirable" policy of "refusing to
accept charity from capitalists."
The Cossack revival, a right
wing Russian nationalist move
ment that has risen in response to
the nationalism sweeping the for
mer Soviet states, demonstrates
what Keller sees as "the symptoms
of a neurotic and unstable society."
One Cossack leader, a "chilly
figure" Keller repeatedly compared
to David Duke, capitalizes on eth
nic hatred and directs the Cossacks
toward violent vigilante action.
Keller reminded the audience
of the "incredible resilience" of
the Russian people and said that
they should "never forget the hor
rors that country has been sub
jected to."
