## Early life of King is focus of first volume 
### Cheo H. Coker Staff writer 
The first volume of Martin
Luther King Jr.'s collected writ
ings was released yesterday in
the form of a 484-page book
which includes previously
unpublished manuscripts, let
ters and photographs.
Clayborne Carson, senior edi
tor of the Martin Luther King
Jr. Papers Project, said "Called
To Serve: January 1929-June
1951" is the first of fourteen
projected volumes documenting
King's life and his political and
theological writings.
Published after a year-and
half delay during which a review
panel investigated charges that
parts of his doctoral dissertation
were plagiarized, the book
traces the people, events and
environment that shaped King's
life from his birth in 1929 until
1951.
"[KingJ grew up in a very
positive family environment,
and saw around him many posi
tive black role models — partic
ularly black males — who were
forceful leaders, who were out
spoken on social issues," Carson
said. "He had that model grow
ing up of the kind of leader that
he might want to be."
"Called to Serve" includes
several examples of King's early
academic and personal papers.
In an essay entitled "An Autobi
ography of Religious Develop
ment," King recalls his earliest
encounter with segregation at
the age of six.
"[Flrom that moment on I
was determined to hate every
white person," King wrote.
"King doesn't overcome [his

anti-white stance! until he goes to
Morehouse and becomes involved
with an interracial group of stu
dents from Emory University,"
Carson said. "That's his first con
tact with whites who are involved
with pro-integrational activities."
While working on the project,
Carson and his staff found evi
dence that part of King's 343-page
doctoral dissertation from Boston
University, among other academic
papers, was copied from other

texts with improper citation.
After review of the dissertation
in question, which will appear in
the second volume of the King
papers, a Boston University panel
decided that King's plagiarism
was unintentional.
Carson said King's widow,
Coretta Scott King, wasn't upset
by the revelation.
"I think she understands that
the project, during the course of
its life, is going to come up with
negative information as well as
positive information," he said.
The rest of the volumes are
scheduled to be released at a rate
of one book per year.
