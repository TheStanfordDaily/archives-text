# Band may be playing the blues
## Budget cuts require search for new funding 
### Michelle Duran Staff writer 
"All Right Now" may soon sound less then stellar
if the Stanford Band can't come up with an alterna
tive source of funding for buying new instruments
and repairing old ones.
The Band will lose $10,000 next year as part of
the Music Department's budget cuts, if a proposal
submitted by the School of Humanities and Sciences
is accepted.
According to Band Manager Casey O'Hara, the
University funds pay for "maintaining instruments
and buying new [ones]."
While the money representa "a sizeable portion"
of the Band's budget, O'Hara said they are "not the
majority." The Band also receives $28,461 annually
from the ASSU and $20,000 from the Department of
Athletics for travel expenses.
Associate Dean of Humanities and Sciences Car
olyn Lougee said her school's task force used "three
.criteria — quality, centrality to the department and
financial impact" to decide which programs to cut.
"The Band is not central enough to justify spend

ing tuition money. . .when we have to take funds
away" from degree programs and Innovative Aca
demic Courses, Lougee said. She added that the
department has not taken away the one unit of credit
band members receive or revoked the group's charter.
The department still supports the Band's activi
ties, Lougee added.
The decision "didn't surprise me," said Asst.
Band Manager Jesse Johannesen. "I actually expect
ed it. Not because of what we do but because of the
trend in the Music Department towards research"
rather than performance.
Although Band managers said they have dis
cussed the budget cuts, they do not know how they
will make up the loss. One possibility is a second
ASSU fee request for instrument maintenance and
replacement, which students can vote for separately.
Another option is appealing to alumni for donations.
According to O'Hara, the loss will not seriously
affect the Band, "but we might not be able to make
it up completely."
He called the cuts "disturbing," adding that "it
might look bad to see |a musical organization] lose
funding."
