'Voodoo' teacher arrested
IRVINGTON, N.J. (AP) — A substitute teach
er was arrested for performing a "voodoo" ritual
on her rowdy seventh-graders and threatening to
burn their houses down, police said.
Monique Bazile, 57, was charged Tuesday with
endangering the welfare of a child and making
terroristic threats. She could get up to eight years
in prison.
Pupils at Mount Vernon Avenue School said
that on Jan. 29, Bazile began shaking and chant
ing because of their unruly behavior, Police Direc
tor Samuel G. Williams said Wednesday.
She "waved the cross at them, took out some
kind of powder and threw the powder about the
class and said all their souls were going to go to
the Lord," Williams said.
The teacher also told the pupils she knew
where they lived and would burn down their
houses, Williams said.
Most believe JFK cover-up
NEW YORK (AP) — Three out of four Ameri
cans believe there was an official cover-up to keep
the public from knowing the truth about John F.
Kennedy's assassination, according to a poll report
ed on the CBS News show "48 Hours." In the CBS-
New York Times poll results released Wednesday,
the number of people who believe in a cover-up

increased from 61 percent in a similar poll in 1988.
The poll takers said the increase could be
attributed to people who had seen Oliver Stone's
movie "JFK," and to adults under the age of 30
who are too young to remember the assassination
and have been skeptical about the theory that Lee
Harvey Oswald acted alone.
'Miyazawa remark' used in ad
TOKYO (AP) — Prime Minister Kiichi Miyaza
wa's assertion that the U.S. work ethic is on the
decline may have ignited storms of protest in the
United States, but in Japan it is being used to sell
a new car.
In a full-page newspaper ad introduced today,
the eye-catching words "Miyazawa Remark"
appear in 4-inch type. But readers expecting
another pronouncement on the reasons for Amer
ica's economic woes will be disappointed.
That's because the person making the remarks in
the Daihatsu Motor Co. ad is not the Japanese pre
mier, but Japan's superstar actress Rie Miyazawa.
Gazing bewitchingly from the page, the 18-year
old actress, her curly black hair piled high atop her
head, praises Opti, Daihatsu's latest minicar. "Opti
is Japan, the pride of the world," reads the ad.
Daihatsu's spokesman, Masafumi Tamai, main
tains the ad's timing, within days of the brouhaha
over the Japanese prime minister's remarks to
Parliament on Monday, was merely a coincidence.
