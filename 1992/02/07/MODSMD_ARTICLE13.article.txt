## A 						better point plan 
### 
Food Service should
adopt proposal that
allows most choice

LIGHT EATERS ARE paying
for hungrier students, and
University Food Services'
current version of the point sys
tem hasn't solved the problem.
Instead of letting students
choose a plan that accurately
reflects their eating habits, the A
la Carte service now in place in
several dormitories is maintaining
artificially high prices and passing
the costs on to students.
At the end of last quarter, many
students were left with hundreds
of wasted points — which trans
lates into lost money — because
the points don't carry over to the
next quarter.
Food Service officials, admitting
that they had underestimated food
costs, responded by raising the
average price of each food item.
Although many students were
outraged by the decision, it was
necessary to salvage the situation.
If the prices had not been raised,
Food Service would not have cov
ered its expenses and might have
ended up with a deficit.
Right now, Food Service is
reviewing two options to improve
the quality of its point plan and
prevent the problem of students
paying for huge amounts of food
they don't eat.
The first option involves creat
ing an "Extra-lite" point plan so
that light eaters are not made to
bear the brunt of costs in the point
system. Heavy eaters can already
buy more points to supplement the
regular plans.
The more attractive option,
however, is a plan that would cre
ate a minimum, mandatory charge
that would cover Food Service
expenses, then allow students to
buy as many points as they want
on top of that total.

The latter option clearly allows
students the most freedom of
choice in selecting a meal plan.
Although it may be more logistical
ly difficult to achieve, it is a prefer
able alternative to the other
option.
The "Lite" plan now in place
costs only about $50 less than the
regular plan, due to the extraordi
narily high costs — such as paying
for hashers and dining hall work
ers — that Food Service must
cover.
The student consumer should
be wary, therefore, of a plan that
maintains the basic structure cur
rently in place.
The second option is an example
of the kind of innovative problem
solving that Food Service should
make a regular practice, especially
in a time of budget cuts that will
severely limit student options in
many other areas.
By requiring students to pay
only the minimum charge —
which translates roughly into
the set expenses that Food Ser
vice must meet — the option
would keep the costs where they
belong. Students who eat less
food would see that reflected in
their bills.
During its debate on these pro
posals, Food Service should main
tain a high level of communication
with the students it would affect so
much.
Earlier this year, Food Service
alienated many Row House resi
dents when the office decided to
eliminate their cooks and
replace the meal plans in those
houses with trucked-in, reheat
ed food.
The decision to raise food prices
angered many other students,
even though it was a change that
had to be made. To say the least,
Food Service's standing with some
students is at a low level.
To remedy that problem, Food
Service should involve students as
much as possible in its decisions
and implement the proposal that
would maintain the greatest
amount of choice.
