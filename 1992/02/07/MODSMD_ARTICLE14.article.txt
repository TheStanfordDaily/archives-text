Gays and lesbians must take action to ensure rights

WHEN I READ IN THE DAILY
about the incident at Otero Jan.
19,1 was relieved to find out
that there had been another homophobic
attack.
One, that is, which hadn't culminated
in murder.
You see, as much as it troubles me, I
have come to expect that gay and lesbian
people will be attacked. During the past
two years, gruesome stories, reports and
statistics pointing to a steady increase in
violent anti-gay crime in the United
States and elsewhere have filled the pages
of gay and even mainstream newspapers.
Many of the stories reported have been of
attacks that ended as murders.
What in the end stands out about the
Otero incident is not that it has recount
ed our history of oppression — which it
has — but, rather, that it occurred in a
university whose administration has
gone out of its way to educate students

about what it means to be gay and les
bian, and that has made a consistent
effort to instill in people a sense of toler
ance and respect for what are considered
"alternative" lifestyles.
So what is the lesson? Put simply, it
is that education is not enough. This is a
lesson I learned years ago, and one we
cannot afford to discover anew every
time someone is assaulted on the basis
of her or his alleged, perceived, claimed
or real homosexuality.
If it weren't for the privileges, sanc
tioned by law, favoring heterosexually
oriented people, nobody — whether edu
cated or uneducated — would be able to
get away with his or her homophobic
neuroses-turned mad attacks. The recog
nition throughout the world of the civil
and human rights of gays and lesbians
can only be secured through changes in
the structure of society.
The gay and lesbian movement is

resuscitating, and the time is ripe for
going out to the streets, linking up inter
nationally and demanding the rights that
will ensure the liberation of all sexually
oppressed sectors. These demands, to be
effectuated worldwide, must include:
• The abolition of marriage;
• The abolition of all privileges (such
as tax breaks, government subsidies,
reduced rates for memberships, etc.)
granted to families;
• The complete legalization of abor
tion, contraceptives, sexual education,
prostitution, surrogate motherhood and
pornography;
• The recognition of all relationships
consented to by people;
• Equality of access to all areas of
work and levels of education for women
and men;
• Equal pay for equal work; compara
ble pay for comparable worth;
• The abolition of all laws restricting

adoption;
• The industrialization and socializa
tion of the family;
• The formation of reproduction
(including physical and sexual) and sexual
workers' unions on a transnational level;
• The formation of household inspec
tion committees to put an end to domes
tic violence and to all undemocratic, sex
ist, chauvinistic and other types of
oppressive practices; and
• The abolition of passports, green cards,
visas and other restrictions that prevent the
free flow of people across nations.
It is initiatives such as the Universi
ty's to allow gay couples to live in family
housing that will bring us closer to the
achievement of these aims. Gays and les
bians everywhere must act to ensure
that they are furthered.
