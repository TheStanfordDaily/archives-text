# Rabois deserves little community attention
## 
### 
I am writing concerning the recent
spate of articles discussing the incident
Jan. 19 in which first-year law student
Keith Rabois made homophobic remarks
directed toward the cottage of Otero
Resident Fellow Dennis Matthies.
I believe it is unfortunate that Rabois
should be the subject of so much atten
tion, as it is obvious that this was his
goal from the start.
It is important to remember that
while this incident may be disturbing
and revolting, the actions of Rabois are
basically of little consequence in the
larger scheme of things. He is significant
only in that he is symptomatic of a
broader social malaise.
That is, he should be regarded in
much the same way as we regard chan-

cres, running sores or buboes. It is not he
himself we must be concerned with, but
the disease of which he is an indicator.
To create a spectacle of the incident
would only encourage Rabois. I would
propose, then, that we ignore him; we
have bigger fish to fry.
