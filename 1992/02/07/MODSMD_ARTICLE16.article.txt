# Base name-calling is not at all free speech
## 
### 
I was both amused and saddened to
read of the recent disturbance caused by
first-year law student Keith Rabois, who
made homophobic remarks directed
toward the cottage of Otero Resident
Fellow Dennis Matthies.
I was puzzled by the explanation
offered by Rabois, who justified his actions
on the basis of First Amendment rights. I

was especially struck by the fact that he
apparently relishes the controversy he has
caused with his inflammatoiy remarks.
If Rabois fancies himself such a
champion of free speech, it strikes me as
odd that he can come up with no better
way to demonstrate his so-called dedica
tion to the cause than through a coward
ly display of ignorance and intolerance.
Though I cannot boast the superior
knowledge of a first-year law student, I
am certain that if asked I could suggest
a more effective means of testing the
First Amendment than by anonymously
shouting insults like "Hope you die of
AIDS!" with little or no provocation.
I am disappointed by the lack of deco
rum and sensitivity that Rabois displayed.
But I shall not grow too indignant, for
ultimately I believe that Dean of Students
Michael Jackson is right: on a campus of
25,000 mostly tolerant, civic-minded indi
viduals, base name-calling is generally
frowned upon and the few individuals

who do engage in this behavior are seen as
immature and somewhat comic.
Rabois* misguided belief that his
actions have made a significant contri
bution to the debate about free speech
and his attitude of self-congratulation
for illuminating previously unclear
aspects of the Fundamental Standard
are laughable.
Unfortunately, the notion that our
legal system might someday host a
lawyer who proves his commitment to
the Constitution through such arrogant
and petty acts is not.
I can only hope that through future
years of study at the Stanford Law
School, Rabois will develop a sense of
decency and will learn to act respectfully
and rationally, not only toward individu
als whose views he does not share, but
also with regard to the laws and Consti
tution to which he owes so much.
