## Finding the outside world 
### 
THE STANFORD COMMUNITY,
and by no means it alone, is facing
a challenging period: the end of the
Cold War, and international social, eco
nomic and cultural integration on a scale
never witnessed before.
Now is the time for everyone, especial
ly students, to take the lead in broaden
ing their connections with all of the out
side world — and this is particularly true
of Americans.
But the often-heard argument that
the "American plenty" creates a self-suf
ficient and smug atmosphere not con
ducive to extending oneself to the outside
world, and that geography is a weak point
for a large portion of the American pub
lic, does not fully address the issue.
The emphasis, instead, should be to
thoroughly examine organizations repre
senting many different lands, peoples
and cultures around the world, repre
senting diverse viewpoints. It is a task
that the Stanford media — through head
to-head interviews as well as personal
analysis based on conviction — can
accomplish.
People outside of our student body
who come from particularly interesting
places must also be given a voice. In addi
tion to opening up access to largely
"unknown" corners of the world not rep
resented in our student body, this would
provide views of people in walks of life
other than academia — people who can

too easily be passed over but who are
nonetheless significant to all human
beings.
Finally, in choosing which issues to
focus on, the Stanford media should pay
special attention to people, on or off cam
pus, who have suffered from conflict and
injustice.
Groups such as the Tibetans, the
Palestinians, the Kashmiris, the Kurds,
the Baluchis, the Kanaks of New Caledo
nia, the Albanians of Kossovo, the
Tuaregs and the people of Sinjiang in
Asia and Western Sahara in Africa must
be given a voice — if not, for argument's
sake, a referendum allowing them to
decide their future.
These are people who have no state of
their own, and are arbitrarily treated by
armies largely foreign to them.
The people of Afghanistan, Zaire,
Madagascar, many nations of southeast
Asia and the Middle East, and particular
ly the Chinese and the Burmese, have
met with butcheries while trying to speak
out for change and fundamental human
rights such as democracy and religious
freedom.
Recently, as my Tunisian friend and
fellow student, Sadok Kallel, eloquently
presented in a recent letter to The Daily,
Algeria, too, has been denied democracy.
In that country, members of the Islamic
Salvation Front, whom the people elect
ed, face harassment and massive arrests.

'These are peo
ple who have
no state of
their own and
are arbitrarily
treated by for
eign armies/

In South Africa today, the majority of
the population is denied the right to
vote. The failure of the August 19 putsch
in Moscow resulted in a vast opening-up
of the Russian political system, but
Brezhnev-era apparatchik holdouts con
tinue to run much of former Soviet Cen
tral Asia, such as Tajikistan and Uzbek
istan.
Korea remains divided 45 years after
World War 11, and Colombia, Peru,
Sudan and Somalia are in the midst of
bloody civil wars, with Georgia on the
brink of one as well.
Even my own country, Haiti, a coun
try which so proudly declared itself to be
the first Black republic nearly 200 years
ago, and shocked the world with its disci
pline and strong will in the January 1991
free and fair elections, today faces eco
nomic disaster, massive political repres
sion and intolerance on all sides.
Examining areas like these will give
the Stanford community a uniqueness in
its quest to understand the reality that
many people continue to face worldwide,
even in 1992.
