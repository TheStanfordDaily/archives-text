# Med School harassment case ends
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
The sexual harassment charge
brought against Medical School Profes
sor Mark Perlroth in June has been for
mally resolved, University President
Donald Kennedy announced yesterday.
One condition of the agreement —
which settled three professional miscon
duct charges, including one for sexual
harassment — was confidentiality, so
University officials will not comment on
the case.
Two female medical students filed

separate complaints against Perlroth in
late 1990 and early 1991. The com
plaints reported one incident of sexual
harassment and another unrelated inci
dent of improper hiring practices.
The two complaints resulted in three
separate charges of professional miscon
duct, filed to the University Advisory
Board by Kennedy June 26.
The agreed-upon disciplinary mea
sures were not disclosed. However, sever
al medical students confirmed that Perl
roth still teaches at the Medical School
and treats patients in the cardiology unit
at the Stanford-affiliated VA hospital.

The details of the resolution were
reviewed and approved by the two stu
dents who filed the complaints, accord
ing to the statement issued yesterday by
the University.
"I'm very pleased that the case has
been resolved to the students' apparent
satisfaction," said Medical School Dean
David Korn.
A compromise was reached before a
formal University hearing was held.
Perlroth, who vigorously contested
the charges in June, would not comment
on the matter, but issued a state
ment saying he and his wife were
pleased that they had reached "an
amicable compromise settle
ment" with the University.
Perlroth apologized "to the two
medical students for his insensi
tivity and for his departure from
appropriate hiring process" in the
University statement.
One of the complaints involved
an incident in which Perlroth
allegedly lowered a student's
grade so she would have to come
into his office to discuss the
exam. During the meeting, Perl
roth allegedly "channeled the
conversation into inappropriately
personal subjects," asking her
"increasingly intimate ques
tions," some of which had sexual
overtones, according to the
charges filed against him.
The other complaint against
Perlroth alleged that he "refused
to consider the application of a
female medical student for a
teaching assistantship . . . because
he wanted to have a sexual rela
tionship with her."
An ad hoc committee in the
Medical School collected evidence,
then forwarded their findings to
Kennedy, who found Perlroth's
behavior in both cases to consti
tute professional misconduct.
Kennedy said at the time that
he attempted to privately resolve
the matter with Perlroth before
filing charges, but Perlroth did
not accept the proposed sanc
tions; This was only the second
time in Stanford history that the
University president filed charges
against a faculty member.
