# Med School harassment case ends
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
The sexual harassment charge
brought against Medical School Profes
sor Mark Perlroth in June has been for
mally resolved, University President
Donald Kennedy announced yesterday.
One condition of the agreement —
which settled three professional miscon
duct charges, including one for sexual
harassment — was confidentiality, so
University officials will not comment on
the case.
Two female medical students filed

separate complaints against Perlroth in
late 1990 and early 1991. The com
plaints reported one incident of sexual
harassment and another unrelated inci
dent of improper hiring practices.
The two complaints resulted in three
separate charges of professional miscon
duct, filed to the University Advisory
Board by Kennedy June 26.
The agreed-upon disciplinary mea
sures were not disclosed. However, sever
al medical students confirmed that Perl
roth still teaches at the Medical School
and treats patients in the cardiology unit
at the Stanford-affiliated VA hospital.

The details of the resolution were
reviewed and approved by the two stu
dents who filed the complaints, accord
ing to the statement issued yesterday by
the University.
"I'm very pleased that the case has
been resolved to the students' apparent
satisfaction," said Medical School Dean
David Korn.
A compromise was reached before a
formal University hearing was held.
Perlroth, who vigorously contested
the charges in June, would not comment
