# Kennedy: Sense of tolerance is weapon against provocation
## 
### 
WE ARE A DELICATE communi
ty, in part because we are so het
erogeneous. Stanford's educa
tional purposes are served by gathering
young people of outstanding promise
who come from many different ethnic,
cultural, religious and economic back
grounds. Then we ask them to live
together — with our help, but largely by
their own rules.
Delicate though it is, the Stanford
community survives frequent chal
lenges, which often arise out of our dif
ferences. Misunderstandings, mistakes,
even serious affronts are an inevitable
consequence of the way we live. Where

they are especially important and visible,
we may have to respond with sanctions
or by changing the rules under which we
govern ourselves.
In the past these challenges have
arisen randomly, and our responses have
tended to improve our system and our
rules — in much the same way as the
process of evolution makes use of ran
dom genetic variation acted upon by nat
ural selection. But when the challenges
are not random but systematic, and all
in the same direction, the outcome is
likely to be very different.
During recent weeks, students and
organizations that claim to be "conser
vative" have issued a series of challenges

to the Stanford community. These have
included an issue of The Stanford
Review containing attacks on campus
policies on sexual assault and an inci
dent in which a student formerly associ
ated with that publication shouted
obscene homophobic insults toward the
residence of a faculty member.
When asked about his conduct by an
officer of the University, he replied that
he knew exactly what was permissible
and what was not, and defied the Uni
versity to undertake prosecution.
It is unlikely that we will. But two
points nevertheless need to be made
about such actions. First, they are delib
erate efforts to test our form of gover-

nance—not the random challenges
through which we respond and thereby
improve our arrangement, but some
thing else entirely.
Challenges organized as purposeful
provocations are designed to destroy
trust and comity. They invite us to make
the most unpleasant of choices: either
watch in horror as decency decays or
engage in a level of repression that is
distasteful to us all.
Second, the provocations afforded to
speech on this campus and in the Ameri
can society more generally protect com
munity members against sanctions — on
the part of the University against stu
dents in the first case and the State

against its citizens in the second.
Our respect for freedom of speech
may stop us short of formal sanctions in
this disturbing case. But it need not pre
vent us from naming the behavior for
what it is: vile, vicious and unworthy of
Stanford.
Nor need it prevent us from discern
ing and deploring its purpose, which is
to damage our community by sowing
mistrust. Against deliberate and system
atic provocation, the only weapon is a
sense of tolerance and a conviction that
what we have is too important to risk by
overreacting.
