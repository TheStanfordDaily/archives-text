"When all the resources of
the multicultural agenda are
directed against you, you
quickly find out who your real
friends are. In that way, this
has been one of the most
valuable experiences of my
life."
â€” First-year law student
Keith Rabois, reacting to com
munity condemnation of his
actions during the Jan. 19
incident at Otero, in which he
made homophobic slurs
directed at the cottage of
Otero Resident Fellow Dennis
Matthies. See Rabois' letter to
the editor, above.
