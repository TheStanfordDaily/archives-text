## Miracle III foiled by Reeves' last-gasp layup Stanford plays No. 7 Arizona tough 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
It was a deja-vous finale with
an ironic twist last night for the
men's basketball team, as No. 7
Arizona stunned Stanford 72-70.
Poised for a historic repeat of
the Miracle of Maples, Stanford
concluded the 40-minute basket
ball marathon with a flat-on-the
face finish mirroring last year's
bitter 78-76 defeat.
In five seconds Stanford went
from the ecstasy of Miracle of
Maples 111 to the agony of an
eighth consecutive defeat to the
Wildcats (16-3, 6-2 in the Pacific
10 Conference).
"Boy is that disappointing; it's
almost unbelievable," said Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery.
"Our kids played their hearts out,
and it was just a tremendous
effort."
Senior Adam Keefe, the team's
most dependable free throw
shooter, had two chances with
five seconds left to break a 70-70
tie and win the game. Keefe's
first free throw missed off the
back rim, and his second was
aborted by a lane violation whis
tled on Brent Williams.
Stunned, Stanford watched as
Arizona guard Khalid Reeves
drove the length of the floor to
score a buzzer-beating layup over
Williams.
"I knew in my mind I was
going to take it," said Reeves,
who scored 13 of a team-high 19
points in the second half. "Five
seconds is a long time, and I was
either going to pull up or take it
all the way."
Last year Stanford squandered
a four-point lead in the final two
minutes and Sean Rooks won the
game at the buzzer for the Wild
cats. The Cardinal has not beaten
Arizona since 1989, but couldn't
have come any closer last night.
Stanford being in position to
beat Arizona was no miracle, but
the result of Cardinal dominance
against a bigger and deeper Wild
cat frontline.
Although Arizona rotated 6-

foot-10, 252-pound center Sean
Rooks, 6-8 Womack and 7-footer
Ed Stokes throughout the game,
Stanford won the glass battle 45-
30 and frustrated the Wildcats on
offense.
The Tucson skyline of Rooks,
Womack and Stokes shot nine
for-25 from the field, while Keefe
tallied a game-high 29 points and
16 rebounds and center Paul Gar
rett snagged eight offensive
rebounds.
Keefe scored eight points in a
10-0 first-half Stanford blitz. The
Wildcats hit their first three
three-pointers to take a 31-21
lead, but Stanford caught up at
the intermission 38-38.
Peter Dukes, who hadn't made
a three-pointer in four games,
sank two against the Wildcats
and scored seven points in a row
to start the second half. Stanford
built a 54-44 lead with 12 min
utes left, but couldn't find anyone
to cover Reeves.
Shut down inside, Arizona
spread its offense to let Reeves
