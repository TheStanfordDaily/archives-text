# Miscue gives 'Cats ball
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Twelve seconds more, and it would have been
Miracle #3. In a strange turn of events in the final
moments of last night's game, the young Cardinal
lost a game which it truly deserved to win.
After Wayne Womack sank the back end of the
two-shot foul to tie the score at 70 with 12 seconds
to go, Marcus Lollie pushed it up and found Brent
Williams, who was unable to convert a lay up. But
Adam Keefe had tremendous position inside for the
offensive rebound and was fouled going back up.
Arizona coach Lute Olson then called a time-out
with five seconds left on the clock to tiy to ice Keefe.
Keefe, an 83% free-throw shooter on the season,
missed the first. The players were lined up for
Keefe's second attempt when Williams realized he
was not where coach Mike Montgomery wanted
him. Montgomery yelled at him to move. As the
referee was in the process of giving the ball to
Keefe, Williams moved to the top of the key. A
pause occurred, and then the ref called a lane vio
lation, turning the ball over to Arizona.
"Was the ball in the hands of the shooter?"
Montgomery said. No. The ball was in flight when
he called the violation. Was the referee supposed to
hand it or to throw it? I don't know, but the guy
who threw it wanted it back."
"What we said in the time-out was that we were
relatively certain that Adam would make at least
one if not both (free throws). We were fairly confi
dent that that was going to be the case and we still
believe that it would have been.
"We had asked Brent to come off the line so he
could pick up the first guard coming out, and so
that what did happen would not happen. So that
Brent would pick the guy up, and they would run it
to the second guard, both of which were back, so
that he would have to pick it up and throw it
across. That obviously did not get communicated."
"Coach said in the time-out that he wanted me
to go to the top of the key so I could cut the guard
off left or right. I was confused as to what to do
after the miss. I didn't remember to get off in time.
The ref had not yet handed the player the ball and
(had not) said hold your spaces," Williams said.
The call left the Cardinal stunned, almost
frozen in disbelief. Khalid Reeves went coast-to
coast after receiving the inbounds from Matt Oth
ick to score the game winner. Williams had defen
sive position when Reeves was in the air for his
driving lay-up, but no foul — offensive or defensive
— was called.
"I thought I had the charge and the ref didn't
even acknowledge the play. The ref took a lack of
responsibility at a critical point, but that's the way
it goes," Williams said.
