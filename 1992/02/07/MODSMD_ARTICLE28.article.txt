# Swimmers look to dominate Pac-10s
## 
### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
No group of collegiate swim
mers has proven yet that they
even deserve to be in the same
pool as the No.l Cardinal, and
Stanford is looking to keep it that
way at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, to be held today
through Sunday in Long Beach.
The Pac-10 has long been the

strongest conference in women's
swimming, and the Cardinal has
dominated its West Coast foes in
recent years. Stanford has won
the last five Pac-10 crowns and
is heavily favored to steamroll
the competition this year once
again.
To accomplish the feat, Stan
ford will have to defeat UCLA —
currently ranked No. 5 in the Col
lege Swimming Coaches Associa

tion of America poll — Arizona
State, California, and USC,
ranked Nos. 7-9. Stanford has
already faced the Bruins, Trojans
and Bears, soundly defeating each
of them.
Also competing will be No. 14
Arizona, Washington, Washing
ton State and Oregon State. Ore
gon, the remaining team in the
Pac-10, does not have a varsity
swimming team.

In 1991, Stanford
won an astounding
10 of 18 events while
demolishing the rest
of the field at Pac
10s.

Stanford boasts a number of
contenders for individual titles at
this weekend's race. Summer
Sanders, who won both the 200-
yard butterfly and the 200 indi
vidual medley a year ago, leads
the pack.
She is joined by freshman sen
sation Jenny Thompson, a
freestyle sprinter who has been
all but unstoppable in recent
meets. Lea Loveless, Janel Jor
gensen and Lori Heisick, all com
ing off a two-victory meet against
California a fortnight ago, are
also looking to grab a Pac-10 indi
vidual title.
In 1991, Stanford won an
astounding 10 of 18 events while
demolishing the rest of the field
at Pac-lOs.
The remainder of the Cardi
nal's season consists of a series of
critical meets. Stanford's divers
will look to defeat the field at the
Pac-10 Diving Championships,
which will be held on Feb. 28-
March 1 in Tucson, Ariz. From
March 1-6, the women will go to
the Olympic Trials in Indianapo
lis. Finally, the women's team's
season will come to a close at the
NCAA Championships, which
will take from March 19-21 in
Austin, Texas.
