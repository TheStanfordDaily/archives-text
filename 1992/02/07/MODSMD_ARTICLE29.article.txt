With several expected victories and an
upset, four Cardinal players advanced to the
second round of the Rolex National Indoor
Tennis Championships in Minneapolis.
Senior Kylie Johnson and sophomore
Emma Woodhouse notched the upset by dom
inating San Diego State's Nicole Storto and
Susan Hawke 6-3, 6-1. The veteran Aztec pair
was an alphabetical 5-8 seed.
Johnson and Woodhouse also have a diffi
cult second round assignment as they square
ofT today against top-seeded Susan Gilchrist

and Vickie Paynter of Texas.
The upset that put the Cardinal tandem in
the quarterfinals, couldn't be copied by John
son in the singles competition.
Shannan McCarthy, the No. 2 seed , over
powered the Stanford senior 6-3, 6-3. Taking
advantage of the fast indoor surface,
McCarthy used a strong serve and volley game
to pressure Johnson.
The Georgia All-American has made a
habit of beating Stanford players in this tour
nament, the third leg of the collegiate Grand
Slam. Last year she picked apart Heather Wil
lens and Teri Whitlinger on the way to the
finals.

McCarthy may get another shot at a Cardi
nal, as Willens and Laxmi Poruri won in
straight sets over their first round opponents.
Willens tallied a 6-4, 6-1 victory over Florida's
Kay Louthian and next faces Kansas' Eveline
Hamers.
Poruri, who is in McCarthy's half of the
draw, had to fight concentration lapses and
the crowd to beat Texas' Jackie Moe 6-3, 6-4.
An Edina, Minn, native, Moe had the fan sup
port but the Stanford sophomore took the win.
"I wasn't into it mentally. I was flat but I
stuck it out," Poruri said. "Sometimes you're
up and sometimes not." She real
ized she will have to raise her level
of play to defeat her next oppo
nent, California's Lisa Albano.
Last year Albano knocked Poruri
out of the tournament.
"I've got to be a lot more
intense and aggressive (than

today)," Poruri said. "I've got to
get on top of her early and go for
more shots â€” hit the crap out of
the ball."
Poruri and Willens survived
an even closer match in doubles.
The duo was pushed to 5-7, 6-3,
6-4 by a local team, Minnesota's
Jennie Moe and Sofie Olsson.
"They played great doubles,"
Poruri said. "We had two set
points in the first set and
couldn't convert. We started to
move better in the second set and

finally pulled it out."
What the Golden Gopher tan
dem did, and what the Cardinal
pair needs to do next round is
attack, said Poruri. "The surface
is really fast so you have to be
aggressive, play clean and put the
ball away," she said.
In the quarterfinals they face
the No. 4 seed, Arizona's Danielle
Scott and Banni Redhair.
One round of doubles and two
rounds of singles are scheduled
for today.
