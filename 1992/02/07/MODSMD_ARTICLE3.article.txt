# Faculty grapples with budget
## Senate members criticize library cuts, lack of information 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Only one word could describe
the nature of yesterday's Faculty
Senate meeting — scattered.
The senate discussed the bud
get-reduction proposals submitted
by schools and administrative
areas two weeks ago, jumping
from topic to topic with little focus.
"The randomness of this discus
sion bothers me," said History
Prof. David Kennedy. He blamed
the lack of focus partially on "the
nature of the reporting process....
I do understand how difficult it is
to see things in a focused and clear
way."
Senate Chair James Sheehan
tried to structure the discussion
along four of the six cross-cutting
themes currently being studied by
task forces of the Cabinet Com
mittee on Budget and Strategic
Planning — undergraduate and
graduate education, research and
diversity.
The remaining themes — sup

port services and the arts — will be
discussed at a special senate meet
ing scheduled for next Thursday.
Faculty members will bring up
specific questions about schools
or administrative areas at that
meeting, and Provost James
Rosse said he will present a com
prehensive report on the 1992-93
operating budget.
The quality of undergraduate
education dominated most of yes
terday's debate (see related story),
and some questions were raised
about the budget process itself.
Several faculty members criti
cized the lack of information
about the budget proposals pro
vided by the administration, say
ing that an informed debate could
not take place.
"We have so little information
that we can't carry out intelligent
discussion," said Political Science
Prof. Stephen Krasner. He and
other faculty members argued
that the short budget-reduction
summaries released last week
were inadequate for analysis of
the process.
University President Donald
Kennedy promised that the black
binders containing the previously
confidential budget information
used to make the decisions would
be made available for faculty to read
in Building 10 by this afternoon.
As the debate turned to issues of
graduate education and research,
an often-repeated complaint
among humanities faculty was the
significant cuts to the libraries.
"The enormous cut the
libraries have once again taken in
acquisitions and services .. . has
frightening implications to the
capacity of faculty to do research,"
said English Prof. Ron Rebholz.

Kennedy said that "when the
cabinet makes the final decisions,
it will be useful to know the facul
ty opinions on how seriously the
cuts might affect them."
Another concern expressed by
several people was support for
graduate students, especially as
several schools are proposing
accepting more master's students
to increase revenues.
"I see the University trying to
educate more students with the
same amount of resources," said
Council of Presidents member
John Overdeck. "I am concerned
about not only the master's stu
dents but also the effect on under
graduates and Ph.D. students."
Sharon Parker, director of the
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment and chair of the diversity
task force, said her task force sees
a "big vacuum" in the budget
information regarding diversity.
"We need to provide some

framework as to how the deans
and vice presidents do some
assessment" of multiculturalism,
Parker said.
The purpose of yesterday's
meeting was not necessarily to
answer the concerns of every fac
ulty member, according to Shee
han. "The object of the discussion
is to gather information and opin
ions" and tell the heads of the var
ious committees what is on our
minds," he said.
In a statement before the
debate, Rosse said four "patterns"
have emerged from the budget
reduction process:
• Stanford will be a smaller
institution, with reductions
including the elimination of about
230 positions currently supported
by the operating budget;
• The University will be more
focused, as deans and vice presi
dents have "cut areas less central
to their enterprises";

• The faculty involvement will
make Stanford a "more self-con
scious institution," as their "ser
vice in this time of crisis" makes it
possible for there to be a "renais
sance in faculty governance"; and
• Stanford will be a place
"more comfortable with uncer
tainty," as the University devel
ops a capacity "to respond to
change in financial forecasts."
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare
briefly discussed the "phase two"
plans of the Faculty Senate Com
mittee on Education and Scholar
ship at Stanford, which he chairs.
"We want to get numbers of
the faculty together in discussions
about ways of reshaping Stanford
. . . and find ways to become more
rather than less," Zare said. "We
want to look for combinations to
strengthen the institution ... and
focus on the undergraduate expe
rience in totality at a world-class
research institution."

have emerged from the budget
reduction process:
• Stanford will be a smaller
institution, with reductions
including the elimination of about
230 positions currently supported
by the operating budget;
• The University will be more
focused, as deans and vice presi
dents have "cut areas less central
to their enterprises";

• The faculty involvement will
make Stanford a "more self-con
scious institution," as their "ser
vice in this time of crisis" makes it
possible for there to be a "renais
sance in faculty governance"; and
• Stanford will be a place
"more comfortable with uncer
tainty," as the University devel
ops a capacity "to respond to
change in financial forecasts."
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare
briefly discussed the "phase two"
plans of the Faculty Senate Com
mittee on Education and Scholar
ship at Stanford, which he chairs.
"We want to get numbers of
the faculty together in discussions
about ways of reshaping Stanford
. . . and find ways to become more
rather than less," Zare said. "We
want to look for combinations to
strengthen the institution ... and
focus on the undergraduate expe
rience in totality at a world-class
research institution."
Only one word could describe
the nature of yesterday's Faculty
Senate meeting — scattered.
The senate discussed the bud
get-reduction proposals submitted
by schools and administrative
areas two weeks ago, jumping
from topic to topic with little focus.
"The randomness of this discus
sion bothers me," said History
Prof. David Kennedy. He blamed
the lack of focus partially on "the
nature of the reporting process....
I do understand how difficult it is
to see things in a focused and clear
way."
Senate Chair James Sheehan
tried to structure the discussion
along four of the six cross-cutting
themes currently being studied by
task forces of the Cabinet Com
mittee on Budget and Strategic
Planning — undergraduate and
graduate education, research and
diversity.
The remaining themes — sup

port services and the arts — will be
discussed at a special senate meet
ing scheduled for next Thursday.
Faculty members will bring up
specific questions about schools
or administrative areas at that
meeting, and Provost James
Rosse said he will present a com
prehensive report on the 1992-93
operating budget.
The quality of undergraduate
education dominated most of yes
terday's debate (see related story),
and some questions were raised
about the budget process itself.
Several faculty members criti
cized the lack of information
about the budget proposals pro
vided by the administration, say
ing that an informed debate could
not take place.
"We have so little information
that we can't carry out intelligent
discussion," said Political Science
Prof. Stephen Krasner. He and
other faculty members argued
that the short budget-reduction
summaries released last week
were inadequate for analysis of
the process.
University President Donald
Kennedy promised that the black
binders containing the previously
confidential budget information
used to make the decisions would
be made available for faculty to read
in Building 10 by this afternoon.
As the debate turned to issues of
graduate education and research,
an often-repeated complaint
among humanities faculty was the
significant cuts to the libraries.
"The enormous cut the
libraries have once again taken in
acquisitions and services .. . has
frightening implications to the
capacity of faculty to do research,"
said English Prof. Ron Rebholz.

Kennedy said that "when the
cabinet makes the final decisions,
it will be useful to know the facul
ty opinions on how seriously the
cuts might affect them."
Another concern expressed by
several people was support for
graduate students, especially as
several schools are proposing
accepting more master's students
to increase revenues.
"I see the University trying to
educate more students with the
same amount of resources," said
Council of Presidents member
John Overdeck. "I am concerned
about not only the master's stu
dents but also the effect on under
graduates and Ph.D. students."
Sharon Parker, director of the
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment and chair of the diversity
task force, said her task force sees
a "big vacuum" in the budget
information regarding diversity.
"We need to provide some

framework as to how the deans
and vice presidents do some
assessment" of multiculturalism,
Parker said.
The purpose of yesterday's
meeting was not necessarily to
answer the concerns of every fac
ulty member, according to Shee
han. "The object of the discussion
is to gather information and opin
ions" and tell the heads of the var
ious committees what is on our
minds," he said.
