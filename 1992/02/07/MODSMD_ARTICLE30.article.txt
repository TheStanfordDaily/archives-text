# Women shoot 40%, stunned by Beavers
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
In a game featuring two of
the nation's top post players,
the team that could could get
the ball to its respective All-
America candidate the most
won. That team was Oregon
State, which got the ball to
Judy Shannon enough times
for her to score 30 points while
leading the unranked Beavers
to a 75-69 upset of the No. 3
Cardinal.
Oregon State finally pulled
off a victory after nearly beating
Washington State and confer
ence power Washington recent
ly. It was a moment that the
Beavers had been waiting for all
year, as they had not performed
up to the promise of their last
season, in which they demol
ished the conference's top two
teams by a total of 43 points.
The upset underscored the
level of parity in the Pacific 10
Conference, as the Beavers
were previously tied for last
place and the Cardinal was in
sole possession of first place.
With the loss, Stanford drops
into a three-way tie for first
with California and USC.
In contrast to Shannon's 26
shot attempts, Stanford's Val
Whiting only attempted 14.
That reflected the shot totals
for the teams, as well. The
Beavers got 73 cracks at the
basket, while the Cardinal only
got 58.
One reason for that was the
lopsided turnover ratio. Stan
ford gave the ball back to Ore
gon State 26 times, while the
Beavers returned the favor
only 12 times.
But while Shannon was the
consistent performer for the
Beavers, several other players
keyed the victory.
Sophomore forward Angela
Allen scored 10 points in just
over seven minutes early in the
second half to help bring Ore
gon State from a nine-point
deficit to a three-point lead. At
that point the Beavers were in
the midst of a 22-5 run. By the
end of that run they were up

58-50 with seven minutes left.
Stanford shaved the lead to
one point three times after
wards, but was eventually
forced to foul. It didn't matter,
however.
Even if the Beavers had
missed all of their free throws,
they already had notched 70
points on Shannon's last two
points of the game. That was all
they needed, as Stanford
couldn't convert on any of a
rain of three-pointers in the
last two minutes.
The Cardinal finished the
first half with a 32-27 lead by
virtue of its superior shooting
percentage. The Beavers had
shot an abysmal 31 percent in
the first half, bad enough to off
set Stanford's sloppy play.
But they shot well over 50
percent in the second half,
while Stanford shot an anemic
35 percent and continued its
generally uninspired play.
The Cardinal will face a
team at least as talented as the
Beavers in the Ducks of Oregon
this Saturday. Tip-off time is at
2 p.m.
