# Cardinal faces tough Titans

### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Stanford faces its toughest matchup so far
this young season this weekend as the No. 10
Cardinal faces the Titans of Cal State-Fullerton,
ranked No. 14 by Baseball America. Stanford
won all three of their games against Fullerton
last year, but this year should be much more of a
challenge, as the Titans are improved.
The Fullerton recruiting class was one of the
best, headed by Dante Powell, rated the second
best frosh nationally. Powell was drafted in the
supplement to the first round by the Toronto
Blue Jays, but spurned the certainly lucrative
pro offer to attend Fullerton.
"He's dynamic," said Titan head coach Augie
Garrido. "He'll be a good baserunner, even as a
freshman. He's going to score some runs and hit
for power. He's a pretty exciting guy."
Fullerton finished at 34-22 last year, but, for
some unknown reason, was not picked for
regionals. A large chunk of that team is back,
making for plenty of experience and ability.
Heading the hitting corps for Fullerton is
senior second baseman Steve Sisco, who last
year hit .350 with three homeruns, 40 RBI and
11 stolen bases. Senior catcher Jason Moler
(.318 average, five homers, 31 RBI, 7 SB), right
fielder Frank Herman (.300, 9, 41), and junior
third baseman Phil Nevin (.335, 3, 46) are also
key offensive threats for the Titans. Nevin,
who has played for team USA the past two
summers, figures to be a top pro prospect after

this season.
The pitching for Fullerton is only slightly less
talented than their hitting. Righthander Dan
Naulty was 8-3 last year with a solid 3.38 ERA.
Naulty is joined by fellow righthanders James
Popoff (7-3 record, 4.81 ERA) and Loyola Mary
mount transfer Chad Dembisky (12-5, 4.23) to
round out a good pitching staff.
However, their opponent, the Cardinal, have
been looking pretty good as well. The pitching
has been great, especially the relief pitching,
which has been superb. Aaron Dorlaque, Rick
Helling and Andrew Lorraine, Stanford's answer
to the 'Nasty Boys,' are striking out opposing
batters right and left. These three should see
plenty of work this weekend, as head coach Mark
Marquess is still hesitant to let the starters go
more than 60-70 pitches.
The starters for the Cardinal over the week
end figure to be Jamie Sepeda Friday, Brian
Sackinsky Saturday, and Willie Adams Sunday.
While Sepeda and Adams have struggled in past
starts, Sackinsky has yet to give up a run in his
10 innings of work.
The Stanford bats are coming along ahead of
schedule. Senior David Cornell and junior Jef
frey Hammonds are both hitting and running
very well. Freshman Dusty Allen has made a
strong bid to entrench himself in the starting DH
role, having accumulated two of the Cardinals
seven hits last Wednesday against Sacramento
State.
The action at Sunken Diamond starts today at
2 p.m., and at 1 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.
