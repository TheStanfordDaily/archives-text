President Bush would call it "staying the
course."
The No. 12 Stanford Cardinal women's gymnas
tics team has not planned any changes in its
approach to Saturday evening's meet against the
No. 8 UCLA Bruins at the Wooden Center in Los
Angeles.
According to head coach Breck Greenwood, Stan
ford's gymnasts will attempt to maintain the high
degree of difficulty they attained in their routines
during last week's home duel with the Arizona Wild
cats. While the Cardinal lost that meet by a narrow
sixth-tenths of a point margin, it established a
school scoring record in putting up 189.75 points.
That tally moved the squad up one notch in this
week's NCAA poll.
In addition to maintaining its technical prowess,

the Cardinal will feature the same lineup of ath
letes that it did a week ago in an attempt to thwart
a Bruin club that Greenwood calls "a perennial
powerhouse."
The vaulters, again, will be freshmen Meegan
Lannin and Tina Snowden and sophomore Laurie
West. Lannin, sophomore Mollie Brown and junior
Erin McCann will compete for the Cardinal on the
uneven bars. The balance beam competition will
feature Snowden, Brown and sophomore Kerrie
Kelley; while Snowden, Brown and McCann will
represent Stanford in the floor exercise competi
tion.
Stanford's "all-arounders," who will be partici
pating in all four disciplines, will be freshmen Katie
Clancy and Jene Elzie and sophomore Kerri Kanu
ka. Elzie set a Stanford record in the all-around last
week, while Kanuka had a strong showing in her
first all-around of the season; both will be looking
to better their marks again this week.
