# Spikers take hard road south
## Cardinal aims for No. 3 Bruins, No. 7 Trojans in LA 
### Laurie Wackier Staff writer 
Behind the momentum of a 3-0
start in league competition and a
5-1 performance on the season,
the men's volleyball team travels
south this weekend with hopes of
adding No. 3 UCLA and No. 7
USC to its list of victims.
If the intimidating net play
and aggressive serves that have
characterized the Cardinal this
season are any indicator, that list
could be growing quickly.
"It's a matter of going down
there and playing our game," said
Coach Ruben Nieves of his fourth
ranked squad. "If we run our
offense, pass the ball and execute,
we'll be tough to beat."
Recent opponents can testify
to that. As a team, Stanford has
compiled a hitting average above
.450 in its first three WIVA
matches, while keeping their
opponents below .300. Dave Goss
has amassed 63 kills in those
matches — none of which went
beyond three games.
And Goss is just one of many

'It's a matter of going down there and playing

obstacles the Bruins and Trojans
will face this weekend. Bob Hill
man, named WIVA player of the
week, is hitting close to .550 on
the season. In addition, Goss and
Hillman both possess a Cardinal
trademark — the jump serve.
Then there's John Bezmali
novic. The 6-foot-5 junior
emanates consistency and accura
cy. Bezmalinovic opened the regu
lar season with 12 kills and .786
hitting accuracy against San
Diego State and hasn't looked
back, punishing Hawaii last week
end with a .643 performance on
10 kills.
That should be enough to
worry UCLA, 2-1, who hosts
Stanford tonight at 7:30. The
Bruins, coming off a tense five

game loss to No. 2 Pepperdine
Tuesday, will be hungry for victo
ry.
Saturday, Stanford faces off
against USC, who has won its sole
conference contest of the season.
With only one returning starter,
the Trojan inexperience may be a
weakness that Stanford can
exploit.
However, that returnee, junior
Jason Perkins, will pose a big
enough challenge. Perkins led the
nation in hitting in 1991, with a
.498 average. Containing Perkins
is likely to be a central goal of the
more seasoned Cardinal squad.
Stanford will share the court
with USC again next weekend
when the Trojans come to Burn
ham Pavillion.

Senior outside hitter Duncan Blackman passes the ball. The volleyball team plays two huge matches in
southern California this weekend against Pacific 10 Conference rivals UCLA and USC.
