# Hockey: 'It's payback time'

### George Malone Editorial staff 
The Stanford ice hockey team knows that
revenge is best served cold.
Friday and Saturday at 7 p.m. the Cardinal ice
men will be hosting the UCLA Bruins, the team
that defeated the Stanford pucksters in their very
first game of the season.
The Cardinal players have been looking for
ward to the rematch ever since.
"We are still kind of bitter about that first loss,"
said left-winger Chip Hall. "We thought we were
the better team then, and we think the same thing
now. It was a loss that should have never hap
pened."
But it did. Starting off the season with an L.A.
road trip, Stanford found itself dropping a disap
pointing 2-1 decision to the Bruins.
The Cardinal has since rebounded to a 14-4
record to claim a firm hold on second place in the
Pacific Coast Hockey Association, but that first loss
still haunts the team. It is a memory the players
would like to erase.
"Basically its pay-back time," Hall said. "We
have spent the last few months proving to the
league that we are a better team than we showed
back in October, and now we have to spend the

weekend reminding UCLA that they got a little
lucky."
Freshman Luke Winter will be a little more
motivated than the others.
Now the league's leading scorer with 44 total
points, Winter was forced out of the first game after
only five minutes due to a slash to the wrist.
He is taking a very simple approach to this week
end's rematch.
"I want to kill those guys," Winter said last week
in practice. "They did not deserve to win."
After passing Pepperdine 13-0 and 14-0 in their
last PCHA games, the Cardinal traveled south and
split with powerful Arizona State (the Icecats have
a well-funded program that allows them to recruit
heavily in the north).
Stanford overcame a 5-2 deficit in the first game
with four third period goals to win 6-5 and managed
another third period comeback tie the second game
before losing in overtime 4-3.
"(ASU) was better than us in terms of individual
skills, but we managed to beat them with good team
play," Hall said.
"The success we had in Arizona showed us we
could compete with any club team in the country,
and it gives us confidence for this weekend."
"The way I look at it, UCLA should discover that
hell is a very chilly place."
