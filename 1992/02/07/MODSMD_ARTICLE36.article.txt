# Gymnasts try for Barcelona
## 
### Peter Marks Staff writer 
Stanford's 1992 Olympic
hopefuls in men's gymnastics
take their first leap towards
Barcelona this weekend at the
Winter Nationals tournament in
Colorado.
Tim Ryan, Jair Lynch and
Jeff Bender left Stanford on
Wednesday to compete for a spot
on the United States National
team. They were accompanied
by Cardinal coach Sadao Hama
da and assistant coach Brian
Heery.
Of the 48 U.S. gymnasts who
will compete against each other
Friday and Saturday, the top 18
finishers will become national
team members. Ultimately, the

U.S. will send the top six gym
nasts to Barcelona.
Who those top six will be
remains a mystery because of
the current parity among U.S.
gymnasts. Yet, assistant coach
Charles Loop is expecting
Stanford gymnasts Tim Ryan
and Jair Lynch to shine at the
meet.
"We're expecting great things
from those guys," Loop said.
"There are no clear-cut number
one and two guys, but Tim and
Jair could place in the top
three."
The Winter Nationals marks
Ryan's return to the national
scene. As an 18-year-old fresh
man, Ryan became the youngest
U.S. National all-around cham
pion since Olympian Bart Con-

nor did it at 17 in 1985.
However, Ryan subsequently
injured his wrist and spent 14
months recovering. Having
finally regained his health,
Stanford's co-captain is a strong
candidate for the Olympic team.
Ryan may be joined in
Barcelona by Lynch. After a
third place finish at last year's
NCAA championships, Lynch
continued to improve his skills
during the summer.
"At this point, Jair is looking
for consistency," Loop said.
Bender ranks among the sec
ond tier of competitors, accord
ing to Loop. The junior is recov
ering from an ankle injury he
suffered this fall and, Loop said,
is beginning to come into his
own.
