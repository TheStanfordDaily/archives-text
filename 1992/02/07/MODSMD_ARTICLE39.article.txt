### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
Otero Resident Fellow Dennis Matthies,
whose residence was recently the target of
first-year law student Keith Rabois' anti-gay
remarks, yesterday called for careful analy
sis of the event.
He characterized quick condemnation of
Rabois' comments as "simplistic" and "self
righteous."
Matthies is an instructor at the Center for
Teaching and Learning. He teaches a critical
thinking class called "The Question Course."
Labelling someone as racist, sexist or homo
phobic "ends [one's] thought process," said

Matthies, who this quarter replaced Lecturer
Arthur Hall in teaching courses on "Learning
Strategies" and "Reading Rate Improvement."
Hall died of AIDS-related illnesses Jan. 3.
According to Matthies, labelling someone
is tantamount to saying, "I know who he is,
I know why he does what he does and I know
that it's bad.
"I would like people to ask more questions
about who Keith Rabois is. ... This is not
simple bigotry," Matthies said, adding that
Rabois is "more complicated than that."
Matthies stressed the importance of this
quest, calling it "a process of self-knowledge.
"This realm of race, gender, sexual orien
tation, disability .. . this is new territory for

human consciousness," Matthies said.
He said he believed that external acts
such as condemning a comment or con
structing a speech code are easily imple
mented but do not remove bias from our
society.
According to Matthies, black and white
judgments "wrap [events] in a neat package"
and "end the process of observation and
questioning."
"That's not fundamentally different from
what it is that you're making your judg
ments about," he said.
By examining the incident more fully,
Matthies said, "you'd find the threads of
Keith Rabois in yourself."
