# Profs claim cuts will hurt undergrads

Undergraduate education
could be devastated by bud
get-cutting proposals under
consideration by the Cabinet
Committee on Budget and
Strategic Planning, several
professors said at yesterday's
Faculty Senate meeting.
"Undergraduates are
going to be very severely hurt
because the resources (they
use) are going to be given up
much more" as a result of the
budget process, said Classics
Prof. Marsh McCall.
University President Donald
Kennedy said he disagreed with
McCall's analysis. "The notion
that there is something dispro
portionate" about the effect of
planned cuts on undergraduate
education "is simply wrong," he
said.
But several other professors
agreed with McCall, arguing that
the severity of the cuts proposed
for the School of Humanities and
Sciences threatens the quality of
undergraduate education at Stan
ford. Almost 80 percent of under
graduates get their degrees from
that school.
Humanities and Sciences is
"facing some near-crisis situa
tions," English Prof. George
Dekker said.
All of Stanford's seven
schools received deficit-reduc
tion targets between 7 and 9 per
cent from the University Cabi
net in October. However, some
faculty have argued that the tar
get especially hurts Humanities
and Sciences because it lacks the
revenue-enhancing mechanisms
being cultivated by the other
schools.
Anthropology Prof. Renato
Rosaldo said yesterday the school

is also more vulnerable to reduc
tions because it is already "closer
to the margin than some of the
other schools," barely carrying
out its function with the
resources it has now.
The school has proposed elimi
nating at least 22 faculty and a
quarter of its lecturers during the
next three years.
In addition, two professors
expressed concern about the lack
of a central official charged with
supervising undergraduate edu
cation. The University had a
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
until the position was terminated
during repositioning, a 1990 reor
ganization of the University's
administration accompanied by
budget cuts.
But Provost James Rosse said
the function of supervising
undergraduate education is bet
ter left decentralized. The "pro
found and compelling reason" for
abolishing the position was that
"the deans of the schools should
be the officers responsible for
undergraduate education," he
said.
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare
said cuts being considered in
advising services could have a
serious effect on undergraduates'
academic studies.
Officials are being "overopti
mistic" about their ability to
maintain the quality of those pro
grams, he said.
