# Store directors not fully aware of perks
## Bookstore board to hold emergency meeting 
### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
Several members of the Stanford Book
store's board of directors said yesterday
that prior to disclosures made in Wednes
day's Daily they had not been fully aware
of the host of perquisites available to the
store's senior employees.
"I personally was unaware of the mat
ters that were disclosed," said Law. Prof
Robert Weisberg, a board member, in a
brief interview yesterday.
The Daily reported Wednesday that,
for the last several years, the Bookstore
has been leasing a vacation home in cen
tral California from a consulting firm
owned and operated by Eldon Speed, the
Bookstore's general manager, and
Philip Chiaramonte, its assistant
manger.
In addition to the use of the vacation
home, the Bookstore provides its employ
ees with automobiles, a leased motorhome
and several other perquisites unheard of
elsewhere in the industry, The Daily dis
closed.
History Prof Peter Stansky has indi
cated that the board approved the
perquisites made available to Speed and
Chiaramonte. In Wednesday's story, he
said he considered the vacation home a
"quite splendid" perquisite.
Stansky could not be reached for com
ment yesterday.

Agnes Peterson, a Hoover Institution
curator and Bookstore board member,
said she was aware the vacation home
was made available to senior employees.
She said the house's use was approved
by the board at a meeting sometime in
1986.
"The rest I don't know about," she said.
Board member Sanford Dornbusch,
director of the Stanford Center for the
Study of Families, Children and Youth,
said yesterday that he had been aware of
some of the perquisites, but he wouldn't
specify which ones.
Dornbusch would not comment on
whether the board was responsible for
approving perquisites provided to the
Bookstore's senior employees.
The board will hold an emergency meet
ing Tuesday because of the publicity the
matter has received, he said.
The San Jose Mercury News, the San
Francisco Chronicle, the San Francisco
Examiner and the Peninsula Times Tri
bune all ran stories yesterday about The
Daily's disclosures, and the story is being
carried by the Associated Press wire ser
vice. KRON-TV also broadcast a segment
on the Stanford Bookstore during its 6
p.m. newscast.
Not everyone was surprised by Wednes
day's disclosures.
"I was aware of most it — that there
were cars and a house," said Judy
Simpson, who has worked in cus
tomer service at the Bookstore for
14 years. "It was just something that
was accepted through the years."
Simpson said she had not been
told of the perquisites when she
was hired, and only learned about
them through word of mouth.
Simpson said she knew of one
woman who had used the house for
her honeymoon, but said her
impression was that the perquisites

were "for the higher ups."
Many people connected with
the Bookstore expressed support
for Speed and Chiaramonte yes
terday.
"I have sympathy for their
position," said Grant Barnes, the
director of the University Press
and a member the Bookstore's
association, a group of about 30
faculty, staff and students who
are responsible for selecting the
Bookstore's board members.
"Speed and Chiaramonte are
rated among the top people (in the
industry)," Barnes said. "Even
though there have been excesses,
you can't take away from their

accomplishments. They've done a
lot of good things for the Book
store."
Dornbusch also praised the
managers for their work. "When
they first came, no one even
expected the Bookstore to break
even," he said. "They've made a
lot of money for the Bookstore."
Several employees agreed that
the two were good managers and
that the Bookstore was a pleasant
place to work.
"It's been a big topic of conver
sation," Simpson said, "but the
underlings are not particularly
upset. I just hate to see such bad
publicity for the Bookstore.

"I don't think they were being
dishonest," she added.
Leon Rosenberg, a Bookstore
association member and a profes
sor of microbiology and immunol
ogy, said the perquisites are "cer
tainly not the sort of thing that is
defensible just because it is legal."
Students are taking the matter
less seriously, said junior Heather
Weaver, another Bookstore asso
ciation member.
"We've gotten a good chuckle
out of it," she said. "There's a lit
tle resentment and some disgust,
but it's the same old thing —
another one of Stanford's little
scandals."
