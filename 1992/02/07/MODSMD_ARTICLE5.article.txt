### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
Several members of the Stanford Book
store's board of directors said yesterday
that prior to disclosures made in Wednes
day's Daily they had not been fully aware
of the host of perquisites available to the
store's senior employees.
"I personally was unaware of the mat
ters that were disclosed," said Law. Prof
Robert Weisberg, a board member, in a
brief interview yesterday.
The Daily reported Wednesday that,
for the last several years, the Bookstore
has been leasing a vacation home in cen
tral California from a consulting firm
owned and operated by Eldon Speed, the
Bookstore's general manager, and
Philip Chiaramonte, its assistant
manger.
In addition to the use of the vacation
home, the Bookstore provides its employ

and several other perquisites unheard of

History Prof Peter Stansky has indi

perquisites made available to Speed and

said he considered the vacation home a

Stansky could not be reached for com

Agnes Peterson, a Hoover Institution
curator and Bookstore board member,
said she was aware the vacation home
was made available to senior employees.
She said the house's use was approved

"The rest I don't know about," she said.
Board member Sanford Dornbusch,
director of the Stanford Center for the

said yesterday that he had been aware of
some of the perquisites, but he wouldn't
specify which ones.
Dornbusch would not comment on
whether the board was responsible for
approving perquisites provided to the
Bookstore's senior employees.
The board will hold an emergency meet
ing Tuesday because of the publicity the
matter has received, he said.
The San Jose Mercury News, the San
Francisco Chronicle, the San Francisco
Examiner and the Peninsula Times Tri
bune all ran stories yesterday about The
Daily's disclosures, and the story is being
