# Observers: Disclosing incident was unusual
## But others defend Jackson's 'tough' decision 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Officials at several other universities
said yesterday that Dean of Students
Michael Jackson's decision to publicize the
Jan. 19 homophobic speech incident in
Otero was unusual, but some said they
understood his motivation.
Jackson claimed in a letter to The Daily
last Friday that three students walked
through Otero's lounge and when they
reached the cottage of Resident Fellow
Dennis Matthies, 'they yelled: 'Faggot!
You are going to die of AIDS! You're gonna
get what's coming to you, you're gonna get
what's coming to you! Damn faggot!' "
Jackson's letter did not distinguish
between first-year law student Keith
Rabois, who has admitted to making the
comments, and the other students, who,
according to sources, did not make the
comments.
In the letter, Jackson said that his pur
pose in publicizing the incident was to
"put a big spotlight on the actions of these
individuals."
According to Melora Sundt, associate

incident deserves closer look

dean of students at UCLA, publishing
information dealing with possible student
misconduct is "unusual, but some univer
sities do it."
Sundt said she wouldn't have made the
incident public "exactly the way [Jackson]
did." However, she said that she could
"understand his frustration" in dealing
with the case.
"It's tough," she said. "I hear about a
lot of incidents (of sexual assault) where I
know the person is walking around cam
pus. [But] I can't go publishing a list of
people to look out for."
Before making an incident public,
Sundt said, she would conduct a thorough
investigation and "talk to the students and
everyone" involved in the incident.
Sundt said some schools publish a week
ly list of student misconduct incidents on
campus without listing the names
of the students involved.
Sue Wasiolek, Dean for Student
Life at Duke University, also said
publicizing misconduct cases was
"not a standard practice."
Don Arnold, a spokesman for
the Office of Student Judicial
Affairs at the University of Illi
nois, said the campus had not had
many misconduct cases involving
fighting words. If such an inci
dent happened, Arnold said it
would be "settled quietly,
through negotiation."
But he said that he could sym
pathize with Jackson for having
to make such a difficult decision.
"If you are in student affairs
administration, these kinds of
cases are difficult to address,"
Arnold said. "Everybody agrees
that you should (deal with the
problem), but how you do it —
that is a question."
At the University of Illinois,
Arnold said, there is "no overt
attempt on our part to stimulate
discussion" by publishing details
of misconduct cases.
However, Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole said Monday that when
the University cannot prosecute
students under the Fundamental
Standard, discussing such incidents
in a public forum "may be more
effective than a confidential process
that nobody ever hears about."
She said the decision to make
the incident public came after
extended discussion by Universi
ty officials, and she and others
supported the decision.
Cole added that such procedures

"could be used more broadly,"
including in cases involving Honor
Code violations or other cases that
"don't belong in a judicial avenue."
Two spokesmen for dean's
offices at other universities said
they believe that publicizing an
incident of hate speech can have
its benefits.**
Russell Carey, a representative
the Office of Student Life at
Brown University, said that while
Brown doesn't usually publish
information on student miscon
duct until after a judicial proceed
ing has occurred, there "have been
cases where there is extensive pub
lic notice" at the Brown campus.
Publicizing such an incident
"doesn't seem like an unreason
able thing to do," Carey said, as
long as no names are included in
the article and a university inves
tigation into the incident has
been conducted and "has come to
some sort of a conclusion."
In fact, Carey said that if the
information is released in a
"means in which it can be dis
cussed, so it doesn't become a
mud-slinging thing," such public
ity might be more effective than a
judicial investigation.
Allen Colling, assistant to the
Dean of Student Life at UC-
Berkeley, said that as a private
institution, Stanford has more
freedom in handling misconduct
cases than Berkeley.
"I'm familiar with some of
what Stanford has done," Colling
said. "I think that because you're
private you have more of a ten
dency to publish."
Colling defended Jackson's
right to make the infraction pub
lic. "The university can always
take a stand" on issues affecting
the campus, he said.
