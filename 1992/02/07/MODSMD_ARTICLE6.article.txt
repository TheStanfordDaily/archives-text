# Observers: Disclosing incident was unusual
## But others defend Jackson's 'tough' decision 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Officials at several other universities
said yesterday that Dean of Students
Michael Jackson's decision to publicize the
Jan. 19 homophobic speech incident in
Otero was unusual, but some said they
understood his motivation.
Jackson claimed in a letter to The Daily
last Friday that three students walked
through Otero's lounge and when they
reached the cottage of Resident Fellow
Dennis Matthies, 'they yelled: 'Faggot!
You are going to die of AIDS! You're gonna
get what's coming to you, you're gonna get
what's coming to you! Damn faggot!' "
Jackson's letter did not distinguish
between first-year law student Keith
Rabois, who has admitted to making the
comments, and the other students, who,
according to sources, did not make the
comments.
In the letter, Jackson said that his pur
pose in publicizing the incident was to
"put a big spotlight on the actions of these
individuals."

dean of students at UCLA, publishing
information dealing with possible student
misconduct is "unusual, but some univer
sities do it."
Sundt said she wouldn't have made the
incident public "exactly the way [Jackson]
did." However, she said that she could
"understand his frustration" in dealing
with the case.
"It's tough," she said. "I hear about a
lot of incidents (of sexual assault) where I
know the person is walking around cam
pus. [But] I can't go publishing a list of
people to look out for."
Before making an incident public,
Sundt said, she would conduct a thorough
investigation and "talk to the students and
everyone" involved in the incident.
Sundt said some schools publish a week
ly list of student misconduct incidents on
