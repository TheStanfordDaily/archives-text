# International students seeking more inclusive community
## Services, discussions of diversity should be broadened, many say 
### Leta Fincher 
Many international students
feel excluded from the Universi
ty's discourse on multicultural
ism, which they say revolves sole
ly around American ethnic com
munities, according to represen
tatives of international student
groups.
"Multiculturalism seems to be
for Americans only," said Shuye
Huan, a representative of a group
of scholars and students from the
People's Republic of China.
Huan, speaking in Chinese,
said that unlike Asian-Americans
she feels she does not have the
right to demand "equal opportu
nity" because she is not a U.S. cit
izen.
Representatives of interna
tional student groups say they
advocate a new study of multicul
turalism which broadens the
boundaries of the 1989 University
Committee on Minority Issues
report. That report, "Building a
Multiracial and Multicultural
University Community," focused
solely on American ethnic minori
ties.
John Pearson, director of the
Bechtel International Center,
said the UCMI report was a good
evaluation of the status of Ameri
can ethnic minorities at Stanford,
but it was only "one look at multi
culturalism." It might be useful to
conduct a survey about how inter
national students feel about Stan
ford, he said.
"The definitions of multicul
turalism need to be broadened to
include international students
and other groups such as the
learning disabled," Pearson said.
Bertram Eyakuze, a represen

tative of the Stanford African Stu
dent Association, said that while
international students would ben
efit from a study of their needs,
the mainstream university com
munity would also benefit from
"learning how the rest of the
world lives."
"It's a two-way street," he said.
Nearly one in five graduate
students — 1,553 out of 7,022 —
and nearly half the postdoctoral
students — 339 out of 803 — are
international students, according
to an I-Center report issued in
October 1991.
Only 3 percent of undergradu
ates — 206 out of 6,527 — are
international students.
Culture shock a problem
Culture shock, isolation from
family and friends, problems with
visas and employment and, for
some, problems with their home
government all create stress for
many international students.
While Huan — a representa
tive of the Association of Chi
nese Students and Scholars —
said that discrimination is not
rampant at Stanford, she added
that language problems and cul
tural barriers are difficult to
overcome.
She and her husband —
Tiemin Zhao, a doctoral student
in electrical engineering — must
"work harder and suffer more"
than American students in order
to survive, Huan said.
"If we were American minori
ties, I think life would be much
easier," Huan said. "If we're
unhappy, we think something is
wrong with us — we never blame
Stanford," she said.
Many international students

have a tendency to keep problems
to themselves instead of seeking
assistance, said Rolando Villalo
bos, director of foreign student
advising at the I-Center.
Villalobos said he asked one
international student how he
coped with stress in his home
country. The student replied that
he talked to his family and friends.
"How do you deal with stress
here in America?" Villalobos then
asked the student.
"I don't have any problems
here," the student replied.
After Villalobos pressed him
further, the student said that if he
had a serious problem, he usually
talked to a friend at a party while
they were both drunk, according
to Villalobos.
Villalobos also said that some

students have called him with
problems, usually regarding visas,
but they refused to give him their
names because they were afraid
he would report them to the
Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
"Anything that a U.S. student
does is more complicated for an
international student because of
the visa problem," Villalobos said.
The Immigration Act of 1990,
which went into effect last quar
ter, made visa and off-campus
employment regulations even
more stringent than they used to
be for international students.
The I-Center, reeling from
University budget cuts, is also
less able to offer individual coun
seling to the "steadily increasing
clientele" of international stu

dents, Pearson said.
Responsibility on students
However, the responsibility for
a more integrated international
and American student communi
ty cannot be borne by the admin
istration alone, some students
said.
For example, international stu
dents must make more of an
effort to understand Americans,
said a black American student
who asked that his name not be
used.
He said that African students
tend not to associate with black
American students because "they
want to maintain their difference
from black Americans."
The student said that when
international students come to

America, "their identity will be
subsumed under categories exis
tent in American racial politics —
usually black and white."
However, many African stu
dents assert that they don't fit
into those racial categories and do
not want to be categorized, he
added.
"If you're a foreigner, you want
to be 'other,' " the student said.
"If you're an American, you want
to choose sides in the race game."
International and American
Latinos also need to be integrated
further, said Erik Peterson, an
American representative of the
Latino Student Association. The
group is comprised mostly of
undergraduates who are Ameri
can Latinos, he said.
Peterson said the Stanford
community must also bear in
mind that most international stu
dents are graduate students who
are less inclined to participate in
social or political activities, and
therefore "don't get involved" in
multicultural events.
Some international students
said they were disappointed that
international ethnic events are
frequently poorly attended by
American students.
Avijit Goswani, a representa
tive of the Stanford India Associa
tion, said their group holds the
"divali," a festival of lights, at the
I-Center each year to celebrate
Indian culture. The festival
attracts many Indian students,
but few American students,
Goswani said.
In addition to cultural festi
vals, several students said there
should be more issue-oriented
international activities.
Huan said that she enjoyed
attending the festivals, but
believes an in-depth international
conference would be useful. It
would "go beyond just tasting dif
ferent kinds of food," she said.
