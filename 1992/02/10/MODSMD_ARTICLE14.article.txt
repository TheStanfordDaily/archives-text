## The 						unheard voice 
### 
After Otero incident,
'conservatism' may be
confused with 'bigotry'

IN DEFENDING HIS actions
following the Jan. 19 incident
at Otero, first-year law student
Keith Rabois identified himself —
and his behavior that night — as
part of a conservatism that is
attempting to challenge the "sti
fling liberal agenda" on campus.
Rabois was correct in only one
thing: that there is a definite need
for the conservative voice to be
heard and valued here at Stanford.
A distinction must be made,
however, between conservatism
and bigotry. Rabois' conduct —
anonymously shouting epithets
and death wishes directed at a
respected member of the commu
nity — cannot in any way be con
strued as an intellectual chal
lenge.
Rabois' post-mortem on his
motivations that night — encapsu
lated in a Feb. 7 letter to The Daily
— should be treated with cynicism.
Rabois wrote that his "original
intent" was "to make a provocative
statement to the freshmen pre
sent." According to the letter, he
welcomed the investigation as a
chance to "demonstrate the ridicu
lousness" of the Grey interpreta
tion of the Fundamental Standard,
which prohibits face to face dis
criminatory harassment, using
epithets, from one student to
another.
In fact, Rabois' outrageous
behavior has harmed the often
articulately argued case against
the speech code. Far from acting as
a legitimate platform for debate,
Rabois' behavior discredits the
conservative and other voices
against the code. Rabois' actions
alienate the very people in whose
name he claims to have sacrificed
himself.
In a democratic society founded
on pluralist models, it is impera

tive to have a multiplicity of views
constantly questioning the path
taken by the mainstream. This
system applies to Stanford as well,
especially given its stated commit
ment to multiculturalism and
diversity.
Bigotry, though, is based on an
intent to keep one group subordi
nate to another simply because its
members fit into a certain category
labeled as inferior.
Needless to say, most real con
servatives do not have subordina
tion as their intent.
Take, for instance, the issue of
abortion. Millions of Americans
believe that a fetus is a human
being and that abortion on
demand is tantamount to murder.
The opposing arguments support
ing a woman's right to control her
body mean little to many at Stan
ford.
Although the conservative posi
tion is a minority voice here, that
should not detract from its crucial
role in keeping campus discussions
vital and free.
Deciding the legitimacy of an
idea cannot rest on one group of
people with one set of ideas. A
forum must be maintained for
open communication and debate
that includes a wide spectrum of
thought.
Many conservatives on campus
remain closed-mouthed when con
troversial issues surface: the main
reason is that they fear being
placed in the same category as
Rabois.
Unfortunately, this inevitably
translates into less dialogue on
campus. With so many issues fac
ing the community — from sexual
harassment to priorities in the
budget-cutting process — students
cannot afford to keep their opin
ions to themselves.
Students cannot afford to
ignore positions outside that of the
majority for the sake of remaining
comfortable. It is only through
constant communication, contro
versial and otherwise, that any
progress can be made toward toler
ance and understanding.
