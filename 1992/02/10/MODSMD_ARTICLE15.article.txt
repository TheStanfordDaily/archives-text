New matriculation fee should not be imposed on frosh

THE ADMINISTRATION IS pursu
ing a dangerous course of balanc
ing the budget on the backs of stu
dents. In addition to proposing a hefty
tuition hike, the administration has pro
posed that every Stanford student pay a
$100 fee upon accepting admission to
Stanford. Both of these measures are
unsound and call for immediate student
response.
Since the tuition issue has already
received a good deal of attention, we
turn our attention to the ill-conceived
matriculation fee.
For starters, there are questions of
value: what will students be receiving
for their $100? This fee would supposed
ly consolidate the various fees currently
charged by the registrar to pay for such

services as transcripts and Career Plan
ning and Placement Center registration.
We would be disinclined to give any
one $100 for services which may or may
not be rendered later. We have totalled
up all of the charges we've paid to the
registrar's office and the CPPC during
our Stanford careers, and they in no way
total $100.
Graduate students, who often do not
use the CPPC for job placement,
urfdoubtedly have spent much less than
the average undergraduate. Do not be
fooled, this new fee is not driven by a
desire to streamline processes as much as
it is to raise funds to meet budget deficits.
There is also the question of needs
testing. The administration has pro
posed that the $100 fee be waived for

those students who have already
received a waiver on their application
fee. We do not feel that this method pro
vides adequate protection for low incomt
students. Instead, the fee should be
included in calculating financial aid
packages.
None of us reading this letter will
ever face this fee. If passed, the proposal
will not be implemented until 1993. For
this reason, the University is expecting
us to have no comment on this and
other budgetary issues.
We are, however, concerned with the
future of this institution and are willing
to fight battles for the fate of future gen
erations of Stanford students.
It does not take much time to say the
sentence, "No $100 matriculation fee!"

every Lime you deal with the registrar's
office. It requires very few calories to
pick up the phone and call two impor
tant people who serve on the committee
that will be evaluating this proposal.
Call History Prof. Judith Brown and
Biology Prof. David Clayton and tell
them what you think of the idea to stick
future students with an unnecessary
and unfair bill.
Do it today; irreversible decisions will
be made in the next two weeks. Stanford
will be a better place for it.
