# Letter writer ought to heed Matthies' advice
## 
### 
Among last week's deluge of letters
and articles concerning the Otero case
was another letter from Mario Huerta.
In order to secure the rights of gays and
lesbians, Huerta calls for the community
to rally together to bring about, among
other things, the abolishment of mar
riage and the industrialization of the
family unit.
These declarations leave me with a
few troubling questions. Is it just me,
or do these comments actually display
a lack of tolerance for those of us who
choose to center our lives around our
families â€” to live in monogamous
relationships and raise our own chil
dren?
And thus, if we were to consistently
use the progressive logic employed in
our Stanford community, aren't we
going to have to conclude that these
comments are just as deplorable as those

uttered by "intolerant heterosexual big
ots?" Based on our logic, won't we have
to come to the rational conclusion that
being a "familialphobe" is just as bad as
being a homophobe?
After a week of condemning intoler
ance with intolerance, condescending
upon the self-righteous with self-righ
teousness, using name-calling against
name-callers and fighting hate with
hate, I suggest that we heed Dennis
Matthies' advice. Let's try for a
moment to broaden our perspective
and to make a careful analysis of what
we are really accomplishing with our
passionate inquisition of the "intoler
ant."
The purpose of this letter is not to
condemn Huerta to the same fate as
that suffered by Rabois. To "use" him in
this manner would be just as malignant
as the rest of last week's self-exalting
(and community-exalting), Rabois-debas
ing letters.
I only want to point out that his com
ments show that perhaps the sickness
faced by our community is too severe to

heal with the superficial balm of self
proclaimed "openness."
When we are dealing with deep-root
ed value conflicts that lead to situation
al conflicts of freedom, all of the toler
ance and denigrating levels in the world
will not provide sufficient reconcilia
tion.
