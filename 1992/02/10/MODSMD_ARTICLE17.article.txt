# Closure of Salamanca not linked to Santiago
## 
### 
We are concerned that recent letters
to The Daily may be misleading the com
munity on the reasons for the decision
to close Salamanca and offer a program
in Santiago.
First, Salamanca is being closed
because it does not meet the criteria we
were given by the School of Humanities
and Sciences and the "Senate Commit
tee on Education and Scholarship at

Stanford," as well as other Overseas
Studies Programs. Thus, the delibera
tions focused on whether the program
was "central to the mission of the insti
tution" and a "distinctive strength of the
university's profile in research and
teaching."
Second, the decision to open a per
manent program in Santiago, Chile
was based on student and faculty
response to the two pilot programs
offered in the spring quarters of 1990
and 1991 and was made for strictly
academic reasons. The Program Com
mittee considered the strength of the
faculty in Latin American Studies and
the numbers of students who study
Latin America.
Third, Santiago will be funded on a
new basis and is not, therefore, using
money that otherwise would have gone
to the program in Salamanca.
