MOVE OVER Tom Grey — the vig
ilante speech police have arrived.
Dean of Students Michael Jack
son and Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole
have established a precedent of trials by
fire for students whose speech doesn't vio
late the Grey interpretation of the Funda
mental Standard but does offend them.
One night last month, Otero Resident
Fellow Dennis Matthies' door was appar
ently the unsuspecting victim of a bar
rage of homophobic epithets, which were
overheard by William Shepherd, the resi
dence's head advising associate.
When informed of the incident, Cole
determined that the slurs were not prohib
ited by the speech code because they weren't
delivered directly to Matthies' face and
because the code only protects students.
Jackson — with Cole's support
responded by publicizing the details of
the event in a letter to The Daily. Said
Jackson, "I wrote the letter to point out
that what happened was mean and
vicious and needed strong condemnation
from someone in the University."
Mean and vicious, yes. An appropriate
topic for discussion, unquestionably.
But Jackson couldn't go as far as he
would have liked — to say that what hap
pened was forbidden. So, since tangible
punishment wasn't an option, Jackson
appealed to the community "to join me in
condemning fthe) behavior." As he told
The Daily last Sunday, "If 25,000 to 30,000

people know that you said something like
that, you're probably being punished."
And now a little cross-examination
music, please.
Notice what's missing. Jackson's let
ter at least pretends to shield the identi
ties of the students involved. (In fact, one
need not be brilliant to guess the identity
of "student No. 3, a First-year law student
and former Stanford undergraduate" —
the pool is doubtless very small.)
But if the community were to know
only what had transpired and not who had
said what, then it would not follow that
the student involved is "probably being
punished": the 25,000 people Jackson is
counting on to administer punishment
would not know that student's identity.
And what we learn from this semantic
error is the complexity of Jackson's moti
vations.
In Thursday's Daily, Jackson gave his
aims a noble touch: "The best way to deal
with these kinds of issues is out in the
public, so people can debate them."
In fact, a cynic might rebut such a con
tention, arguing that very few people in
this community actually go around yelling,
"Faggot, hope you die of AIDS," and all the
discussion in the world isn't going to stop
the one or two with such a propensity from
fulfilling their inclinations.
And is Jackson really interested in dis
cussion? In his letter he is quite clear that
what occurred must be condemned —

there is no room for discussion.
No, what he wants is for the public to
know who made the comments that so
offended him and for that same public to
brand that offender's chest with a scarlet
"H" (for homophobe) since Jackson is
powerless to follow any procedural means
of punishment.
Now add this to the puzzle: The offend
er is Keith Rabois, a former Stanford
Review columnist who in his many pieces
often challenged or criticized Jackson.
What's at stake here is an administra
tor's ability to punish whomever he or she
wishes despite the fact that no law, code or
policy was violated. That's vigilante jus
tice, which has no place in our community.
"Just because it's legal doesn't mean
it's right," former Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons said. Agreed; so, it's
a perfect issue for dialogue in dorm meet
ings and on The Daily's Opinions page.
But because it's legal, official condem
nation is uncalled for. And if the Universi
ty isn't comfortable with such speech being
legal, it should try changing the rules.

No, what he wants is for the public to
know who made the comments that so
offended him and for that same public to
brand that offender's chest with a scarlet
"H" (for homophobe) since Jackson is
powerless to follow any procedural means
of punishment.
Now add this to the puzzle: The offend
er is Keith Rabois, a former Stanford
Review columnist who in his many pieces
often challenged or criticized Jackson.
What's at stake here is an administra
tor's ability to punish whomever he or she
wishes despite the fact that no law, code or
policy was violated. That's vigilante jus
tice, which has no place in our community.
"Just because it's legal doesn't mean
it's right," former Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons said. Agreed; so, it's
a perfect issue for dialogue in dorm meet
ings and on The Daily's Opinions page.
But because it's legal, official condem
nation is uncalled for. And if the Universi
ty isn't comfortable with such speech being
legal, it should try changing the rules.
