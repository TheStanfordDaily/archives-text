# Leadership summit focuses on diversity
## Jackson: 'We're really one big race' 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
Diversity was the key at the
1992 Leadership Summit last
weekend, as representatives of
20 campus groups debated ideas
such as a white theme house and
more joint ventures between
campus communities.
While the 70 students in
attendance may have come to
the summit with different
agendas, organizers said they
left it realizing that they all
faced similar obstacles.
Sponsored by the ASSU
Council of Presidents, the 3-day
summit aimed to encourage
communication among the var
ious student groups on campus.
The topics of discussion, which
included leadership, multicul
turalism and public service,
remained largely the same at
the second annual summit.
On Friday, students identi
fied their organizations' objec
tives for the next five months,
as well as foreseeable obstacles.
According to COP member

John Louie, "What was inter
esting was that ... a lot of the
[different] groups found they
had a lot of the same goals and
obstacles."
Louie said these similarities
would help foster joint commu
nity ventures such as Hip Hop
Night, a weekly event spon
sored by KZSU and Ujamaa. "I
think that in the future, espe
cially with dwindling budgets,
these joint projects are going to
be seen more often," he said.
When the summit recon
vened Saturday morning, Ted
Mitchell, Special Assistant to
the President and Provost,
offered students a case study in
leadership centering on the all
too-familiar topic of budget cuts.
"It really showed how much
the [leadership] process influ
ences" outcomes, said Sherri
Wolson, a junior representing
Stanford in Government and
the Haas Center for Public Ser
vice.
Multiculturalism was the
next item on the agenda. Greg
Ricks, Residential Education's
multicultural educator, chal
lenged the student leaders to
share their similarities and differ
ences with each other through
"Crossing the Line," a game in
which students step forward to
acknowledge certain characteris
tics and beliefs.
Ricks said he hoped this pro
gram would help students to rec
ognize their multiculturalism as
an asset, not a problem.
During the program, about
half of the participants said they
saw multiculturalism as a
"smokescreen" concealing issues
of power and racism.
In the discussion that followed,
senior Omar Wasow, a resident
assistant at Ujamaa, suggested
the idea of a white theme house or
some other collective effort of
white people trying to identify
their culture.
"It would reduce a lot of the
anger and backlash against multi
culturalism," Wasow said.
Many disagreed with Wasow.
Some students said they felt that
all non-ethnic theme houses were
already "white" in essence.
In conclusion, Ricks urged stu
dents to become "ambassadors of
their own personal understand
ing of multiculturalism."
"If the question gets asked, 'Do
you feel a part of Stanford's pro
gram of multiculturalism?' I want
every student to be able to say
'Yes'," he said.
Matthew Cordova, a freshman
representing p]l Centro Chicano's
Project Motivation, said students
made many valuable comments
during Ricks' presentation.
"Hopefully the groups will prac
tice what they preach," he said.

Yesterday, Dean of Students
Michael Jackson spoke to the
students on the fears, obstacles
and "sleepless nights" inherent
in leadership. Jackson also
addressed students' roles in the
development of a "multicultural
nation."
But junior Kevin Efrusy, a rep
resentative of Kappa Sigma and
the Interfraternity Council, said
he thinks Stanford's current
effort in multiculturalism is often
stifling.
"I think that what Stanford
does as an institution is . . . throw
out a list of options, get people to
research and maybe to learn
[about other people], but not to
think," said Efrusy.
Efrusy said that he would like
to see more students identify
their own roles in multicultural
ism, rather than passively accept
ing the established roles.
Jackson said he is "really
proud of the fact that Stanford
students are willing to enter into
discussion about these kinds of
things that no one [else] is willing
to talk about.
"Trying to expand human
understanding in this modern era
is very difficult but also very nec
essary," Jackson said. "We're
really one big race."
Participants also discussed the
possibility of "institutionalizing"
community service by incorporat
ing it into Stanford's curriculum
and making it an integral part of
student activities.
As the weekend drew to a close,
the students shared their goals
for the future. One objective was
improved intergroup communica
tion and personal commitment.
COP member Benny Sandoval,
who also helped to organize the
weekend, described the summit
as "part of a continuum.
"Change has to happen all the
time — not just this one week
end," she said.

"Crossing the Line," a game in
which students step forward to
acknowledge certain characteris
tics and beliefs.
Ricks said he hoped this pro
gram would help students to rec
ognize their multiculturalism as
an asset, not a problem.
During the program, about
half of the participants said they
saw multiculturalism as a
"smokescreen" concealing issues
of power and racism.
In the discussion that followed,
senior Omar Wasow, a resident
assistant at Ujamaa, suggested
the idea of a white theme house or
some other collective effort of
white people trying to identify
their culture.
"It would reduce a lot of the
anger and backlash against multi
culturalism," Wasow said.
Many disagreed with Wasow.
Some students said they felt that
all non-ethnic theme houses were
already "white" in essence.
In conclusion, Ricks urged stu
dents to become "ambassadors of
their own personal understand
ing of multiculturalism."
"If the question gets asked, 'Do
you feel a part of Stanford's pro
gram of multiculturalism?' I want
every student to be able to say
'Yes'," he said.
Matthew Cordova, a freshman
representing p]l Centro Chicano's
Project Motivation, said students
made many valuable comments
during Ricks' presentation.
"Hopefully the groups will prac
tice what they preach," he said.

Yesterday, Dean of Students
Michael Jackson spoke to the
students on the fears, obstacles
and "sleepless nights" inherent
in leadership. Jackson also
addressed students' roles in the
development of a "multicultural
nation."
But junior Kevin Efrusy, a rep
resentative of Kappa Sigma and
the Interfraternity Council, said
he thinks Stanford's current
effort in multiculturalism is often
stifling.
"I think that what Stanford
does as an institution is . . . throw
out a list of options, get people to
research and maybe to learn
[about other people], but not to
think," said Efrusy.
Efrusy said that he would like
to see more students identify
their own roles in multicultural
ism, rather than passively accept
ing the established roles.
Jackson said he is "really
proud of the fact that Stanford
students are willing to enter into
discussion about these kinds of
things that no one [else] is willing
to talk about.
"Trying to expand human
understanding in this modern era
is very difficult but also very nec
essary," Jackson said. "We're
really one big race."
Participants also discussed the
possibility of "institutionalizing"
community service by incorporat
ing it into Stanford's curriculum
and making it an integral part of
student activities.
As the weekend drew to a close,
the students shared their goals
for the future. One objective was
improved intergroup communica
tion and personal commitment.
COP member Benny Sandoval,
who also helped to organize the
weekend, described the summit
as "part of a continuum.
"Change has to happen all the
time — not just this one week
end," she said.
Diversity was the key at the
1992 Leadership Summit last
weekend, as representatives of
20 campus groups debated ideas
such as a white theme house and
more joint ventures between
campus communities.
While the 70 students in
attendance may have come to
the summit with different
agendas, organizers said they
left it realizing that they all
faced similar obstacles.
Sponsored by the ASSU
Council of Presidents, the 3-day
summit aimed to encourage
communication among the var
ious student groups on campus.
The topics of discussion, which
included leadership, multicul
turalism and public service,
remained largely the same at
the second annual summit.
On Friday, students identi
fied their organizations' objec
tives for the next five months,
as well as foreseeable obstacles.
According to COP member

John Louie, "What was inter
esting was that ... a lot of the
[different] groups found they
had a lot of the same goals and
obstacles."
Louie said these similarities
would help foster joint commu
nity ventures such as Hip Hop
Night, a weekly event spon
sored by KZSU and Ujamaa. "I
think that in the future, espe
cially with dwindling budgets,
these joint projects are going to
be seen more often," he said.
When the summit recon
vened Saturday morning, Ted
Mitchell, Special Assistant to
the President and Provost,
offered students a case study in
leadership centering on the all
too-familiar topic of budget cuts.
"It really showed how much
the [leadership] process influ
ences" outcomes, said Sherri
Wolson, a junior representing
Stanford in Government and
the Haas Center for Public Ser
vice.
Multiculturalism was the
next item on the agenda. Greg
Ricks, Residential Education's
multicultural educator, chal
lenged the student leaders to
share their similarities and differ
ences with each other through
"Crossing the Line," a game in
which students step forward to
acknowledge certain characteris
tics and beliefs.
Ricks said he hoped this pro
