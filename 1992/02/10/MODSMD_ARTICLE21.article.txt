## Five Angry Men Hoops bounce back, thrash ASU 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Stanford unleashed its frustra
tions on Arizona State Saturday,
avenging a painful loss to No. 7
Arizona by pulverizing the Sun
Devils 86-73.
Just 42 hours after suffering a
demoralizing last-second defeat
to Arizona, Stanford returned to
Maples Pavilion in a rage. With
rejuvenated emotional energy,
the Cardinal ripped into the tal
ented Sun Devils to soothe Thurs
day's wounds.

"I was pissed. I still am
pissed," said Stanford guard
Peter Dukes. "I never want to
experience a loss like that (Ari
zona) again. I'm emotionally and
physically spent, but the fire is
still burning. I'm ready to play
Arizona again right now."
Stanford will get another shot
at the Wildcats on March 7, but
the danger Saturday was that
they would forget about ASU. In
similar circumstances last year,
Stanford lost 58-47 in a depressed
funk.
But there was no deja-vu Sat
urday, as Stanford channeled its
anger into 59 percent shooting,
its best output of the year. All five
starters scored in double figures
and Stanford put the game away
with nine minutes left.
"I told Coach Montgomery
before the game that his team
looked focused. I could see it in
their eyes," said disheveled Ari
zona State coach Bill Frieder.
"You have to give Stanford credit.
We came at them and they
responded."
The victory gives Stanford (13-
5, 5-4) sole possession of fourth
place in the Pacific 10 Conference
at the midseason mark. With nine
Pac-10 games plus Notre Dame
remaining, Stanford should make
the NCAA tournament by repeat
ing its first-half insults. The Car

dinal plays at Notre Dame tomor
row, then visits California, USC
and UCLA in its longest road
swing of the season.
As disappointing as the Ari
zona loss was, the ASU win prob
ably means more for Stanford's
post-season chances. With four
teams expected to make the
NCAA tournament from the Pac
-10, Stanford is in competition
with ASU for the final playoff
spot.
The Devils (12-9, 3-6) are now
mired in a three-way tie for sixth
after being swept in the Bay Area.
"I'm high on my guys right
now. That was a hell of a bounce
back," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery. "This says volumes
about them as people."
Senior Adam Keefe did not
dwell on the Arizona ending,
attacking ASU for a game-high 32
points on 12-of-16 shooting. He
and point guard Marcus Lollie (10
assists, 1 turnover) combined to
give Stanford an 18-point lead
midway through the second half
and the Devils never threatened.
A steal and score from Lollie
gave Stanford a 66-48 edge with
8:56 left, and by the two-minute
mark Montgomery cleared the
bench.
"With a team this young, guys
haven't been through this
(bouncing back from defeat). It's
really tough," said Keefe. "I was a
little affected. The points were
there, but I didn't think I played a
very good game overall."
ASU opened a 17-13 lead in the
first half, with 6-foot-9 freshman
forward Mario Bennett scoring
six of his team-high 18 points.
But freshman Andy Poppink
sparked the Cardinal off the
bench and Stanford switched into
a higher gear.
With an angry Dukes hitting 4-
of-5 treys, Stanford ended the
first half on a 13-3 run for a 45-33
lead. Meanwhile, ASU's top
threat, forward Jamal Faulkner,
was held to just two points by
Brent Williams.
Montgomery tried to wake up
the tea-party Maples crowd of
5,185 in the second half, but to
little avail. Apparently, the
Maples faithful had used up

their energy in the Arizona loss.
Montgomery waved his arms
to the sedate crowd and
queried, "Are you alive?" when
Stanford took a 16-point lead.
The fans were alive, but not too
excited.
"I was concerned with people's
heart rates and pulses at that
point," explained Montgomery.
"I'd had enough. Our kids were
busting their tails. If they could
bounce back from Thursday, so
could the fans."

What else is new? Adam Keefe scores and is fouled in Stanford's 86-
73 win over Arizona State Saturday. Keefe played his usual spec
tacular game, scoring 32 points on 12-of-16 shooting.
Stanford unleashed its frustra
tions on Arizona State Saturday,
avenging a painful loss to No. 7
Arizona by pulverizing the Sun
Devils 86-73.
Just 42 hours after suffering a
demoralizing last-second defeat
to Arizona, Stanford returned to
Maples Pavilion in a rage. With
rejuvenated emotional energy,
the Cardinal ripped into the tal
ented Sun Devils to soothe Thurs
day's wounds.

"I was pissed. I still am
pissed," said Stanford guard
Peter Dukes. "I never want to
experience a loss like that (Ari
zona) again. I'm emotionally and
physically spent, but the fire is
still burning. I'm ready to play
Arizona again right now."
Stanford will get another shot
at the Wildcats on March 7, but
the danger Saturday was that
they would forget about ASU. In
similar circumstances last year,
Stanford lost 58-47 in a depressed
funk.
But there was no deja-vu Sat
urday, as Stanford channeled its
anger into 59 percent shooting,
its best output of the year. All five
starters scored in double figures
and Stanford put the game away
with nine minutes left.
"I told Coach Montgomery
before the game that his team
looked focused. I could see it in
their eyes," said disheveled Ari
zona State coach Bill Frieder.
"You have to give Stanford credit.
We came at them and they
responded."
The victory gives Stanford (13-
5, 5-4) sole possession of fourth
place in the Pacific 10 Conference
at the midseason mark. With nine
Pac-10 games plus Notre Dame
remaining, Stanford should make
the NCAA tournament by repeat
ing its first-half insults. The Car

dinal plays at Notre Dame tomor
row, then visits California, USC
and UCLA in its longest road
swing of the season.
As disappointing as the Ari
zona loss was, the ASU win prob
ably means more for Stanford's
post-season chances. With four
teams expected to make the
NCAA tournament from the Pac
-10, Stanford is in competition
with ASU for the final playoff
spot.
The Devils (12-9, 3-6) are now
mired in a three-way tie for sixth
after being swept in the Bay Area.
"I'm high on my guys right
now. That was a hell of a bounce
back," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery. "This says volumes
about them as people."
Senior Adam Keefe did not
dwell on the Arizona ending,
attacking ASU for a game-high 32
points on 12-of-16 shooting. He
and point guard Marcus Lollie (10
assists, 1 turnover) combined to
give Stanford an 18-point lead
midway through the second half
and the Devils never threatened.
A steal and score from Lollie
gave Stanford a 66-48 edge with
8:56 left, and by the two-minute
mark Montgomery cleared the
bench.
"With a team this young, guys
haven't been through this
(bouncing back from defeat). It's
really tough," said Keefe. "I was a
little affected. The points were
there, but I didn't think I played a
very good game overall."
ASU opened a 17-13 lead in the
first half, with 6-foot-9 freshman
forward Mario Bennett scoring
six of his team-high 18 points.
But freshman Andy Poppink
sparked the Cardinal off the
bench and Stanford switched into
a higher gear.
With an angry Dukes hitting 4-
of-5 treys, Stanford ended the
first half on a 13-3 run for a 45-33
lead. Meanwhile, ASU's top
threat, forward Jamal Faulkner,
was held to just two points by
Brent Williams.
Montgomery tried to wake up
the tea-party Maples crowd of
5,185 in the second half, but to
little avail. Apparently, the
Maples faithful had used up

their energy in the Arizona loss.
Montgomery waved his arms
to the sedate crowd and
queried, "Are you alive?" when
Stanford took a 16-point lead.
The fans were alive, but not too
excited.
"I was concerned with people's
heart rates and pulses at that
point," explained Montgomery.
"I'd had enough. Our kids were
busting their tails. If they could
bounce back from Thursday, so
could the fans."
