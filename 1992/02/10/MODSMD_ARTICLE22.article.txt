## Elzie sets record in UCLA loss 
### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
At her current rate, there's no telling how far
Jene Elzie can go.
For the second consecutive week, Elzie, a
freshman out of El Cerrito, California, broke
Stanford's individual all-around record by an
incredible 15-hundredths of a point, totalling
38.70 points Saturday night in the vault, bars,
beam, and floor exercise at UCLA's Wooden
Center.
Before the Cardinal's home meet against Ari
zona on January 31, the school's all-around
mark stood at 38.40. That night, Elzie tallied a
38.55 but stated that she still had a lot to work
on. Apparently, she did her homework, as a 9.60
in the vault and a trio of 9.70 scores in the floor,
bars, and beam (the latter two tied Stanford
records) propelled her to the previously
untouchable 38.70 plateau.
"It felt great," said Elzie, "I was kind of ner-
nervous, but I hit everything. It
was exciting."
However, from head coach
Breck Greenwood's point of
view, the discouraging footnote
to Elzie's heroics was the over
all outcome of the meet.
Stanford mustered a more
than-respectable 187.70 points
before a hostile crowd and the
Bruins' home judges, yet UCLA
put up 191.50 and dominated
every event, including a 1-2-3
sweep in the floor exercise.
In fact, Elzie was the only
Cardinal gymnast to crack the
top three in the other events
and the all-around competition.
"We did a good job overall
but we need to perform with
more confidence," said Green
wood.
The primary reason for the
Bruins' dominance and Stan
ford's loss of confidence was
Kareema Marrow, who won the
all-around with a remarkable
39.05 total that included a 9.90 in
the floor, a 9.80 on the bars, a
9.70 in the vault, and a 9.65 on
the beam; Marrow took first
place in the first three events,
and placed third on the beam.
Another confidence-shaker for
the Cardinal was the last-second
substitution of an ailing Katie
Clancy in the all-around with
junior Erin McCann.
While both McCann and
sophomore Kerri Kanuka, Stan
ford's other all-arounder, per
formed solidly, their efforts were
all but lost in a frustrating
defeat.
The women will attempt to
regroup in time for a double dual
meet with the Stanford men's
gymnastics team against the UC-
Santa Barbara Gauchos Friday
night at Maples Pavilion.
