# Backcourt shines in 86-73 Card win
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Marcus Lollie made every
thing that much easier for his
Cardinal teammates on Satur
day afternoon. Using sound
judgement in running the
offense, Lollie dished out 10
assists in guiding Stanford to
victory over Arizona State.
"Lollie is doing an unbeliev
able job," said Stanford coach
Mike Montgomery. "Coming
down, setting it up . . . He
doesn't get a lot of attention
because he doesn't get a lot of
points, but without him I don't
know where we'd be."
Nine of Lollie's assists came
in the first half, feeding Peter
Dukes for three-pointers or get
ting it to Adam Keefe for one of
his 18 first-half points. It was
especially important that the
Cardinal came out strong early
so as to put Thursday's heart
breaking loss to Arizona behind
them. Since the point guard is
the man who runs the show,
Lollie knew that a lot of the
responsibility for keeping Stan
ford intense lay in his hands.
"We really needed this game
and I knew that if I was down
that would make the team
down," Lollie said. "I needed to
be focused and intense, and
that would make it that much
easier for everyone else."
"With Lollie coming out and
handling the ball like he did, we
were able to get it (the loss)
behind us," added Mont
gomery.
The Seattle, Wash, native
also fired up the crowd at the
8:56 mark in the second half
when he stripped Sun Devil for
ward Dwayne Fontana of the
ball and took it coast-to-coast
for a lay-up on the other end to
give Stanford an 18 point lead,
66-48.
"I thought Lollie did a great
job. He did everything — got
them into the offense, hit the
open shots. . said Arizona

State coach Bill Frieder. "They
(Lollie and Peter Dukes) know
they got a go-to guy in Keefe,
and they do what they have to
do to win."

'Lollie is doing an unbe
lievable job coming
down, setting it up ...
He doesn't get a lot of
attention because he
doesn't get a lot of
points, but without him
I don't know where
we'd be.'
— coach Mike
Montgomery

Lollie scored 12 points on
four-for-eight shooting from
the field to go along with
Dukes' 15 points, giving Stan
ford very balanced scoring at
the guard position.
When asked to describe Lol
lie's performance, Keefe
replied, "It was great. That's
the best game that I remember
him playing in recent memory.
"He led the team, got us out
on the break, passed the ball,
and was making other players
into great players. He can go
out any night and do well indi
vidually, but tonight he really
helped the team."
Peter Dukes, Lollie's part
ner in the backcourt, observed,
"Marcus played excellent
against a club that puts a lot of
pressure on the point guard."
Lollie's 10 assists tied a
career-high he set last year in
the first round of the NIT
against Houston.
"It's my job to make sure
guys are performing, give them
the ball on the offense, and set
them up on the break," said
Lollie.
