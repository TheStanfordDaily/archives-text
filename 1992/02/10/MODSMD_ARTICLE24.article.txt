# Volleyball sweeps L.A. trip, Goss sets mark
## 
### Laurie Wackier Staff writer 
This was a big weekend for Stan
ford volleyball. Big comebacks, big
performances and a big upset in
Southern California indicated one
thing: Stanford doesn't just play with
the big boys anymore. They are the big
boys. Really big.
In marathon-length matches
against No. 2 UCLA and No. 6 USC,
the spikers dispelled any myths about
a Cardinal inability to pull off victories
in close contests.
Ignited by a record-setting offen
sive effort from Dave Goss, No. 4
Stanford emerged victorious from Fri
day's tense five game series against
UCLA, 13-5, 15-7, 9-15, 15-7, 17-15.
Then on Saturday, the Cardinal
rebounded from a two game deficit to
defeat Southern Cal, 9-15, 12-15, 15-
12, 15-5, 15-13.
Despite a relentless effort, the
Bruin squad found no antidote for
Goss, who compiled 55 kills in the

match, establishing a new NCAA
record.
"I'm feeling really confident this
season, both in my teammates and
myself," Goss commented. "We've
been coming together and playing well
as a team."
Down two games to one, Stanford
took control in the fourth game with
an unstoppable offense, forcing UCLA
into a showdown. The Cardinal
retained the upper hand, cruising to a
13-10 advantage in the final game.
But UCLA wasn't ready to fold. Goss
faltered momentarily, missing two
shots, allowing the Bruins to tie the
score at 13.
Coach Ruben Nieves called a time
out, and informed his squad of the
next play: set Goss. Goss responded,
converting for the game-winning
points.
While Stanford's offense flour
ished, UCLA's attack flailed, strug
gling against a Cardinal defense that
collected 71 digs. The loss was the sec
ond in as many attempts for the Bru

ins, who fell to No. 2 Pepperdine earli
er in the week.
A high-pressure match often calls
for a day off, but that was a luxury the
Cardinal couldn't afford. After Fri
day's nail-biter against the Bruins,
Stanford had to turn around and fend
off a hungry Trojan squad.
USC jumped to a two game lead
before Stanford was able to rally and
eventually outlast a Trojan bid for an
upset. "We were just going through
the motions," Goss said of the slow
start. "It was hard to get focused in,
but we finally started playing well in
the third game."
Despite stellar performances from
Goss and Blackman, who collected 35
and 23 kills, respectively, Stanford
kept Nieves on the edge of his seat.
"We weren't operating on all cylinders
this weekend," Nieves said. "I wasn't
sure we could beat teams like that."
The Cardinal reserves were pre
pared to quell his doubts. After a fiat
start against UCLA, Nieves took
advantage of his bench. Ryan Moos,

Joe Burghardt, and Brian Garrett
entered in game three and provided
the needed spark to turn the momen
tum around.
"Our depth was a big factor this
weekend," Nieves explained. "Ryan
came in and passed really well. A lot of
Goss' kills can be credited to Ryan's
passing."
The same trio helped give the Car
dinal the upper hand on Saturday
against USC. Trailing in the second
game, Nieves resorted to his reserves,
hoping to see a repeat performance.
The strategy worked.
"Joe Burghardt played a really
fiery, emotional match," Nieves
remarked of the 6-foot-5 middle block
er. "He served tough, hit well, and his
presence gave the team a big lift."
Nonetheless, as the match at USC
dragged on, fatigue began to play a key
role. "Both teams were noticeably
tired." Nieves commented. "But that's
where Goss shined. As the match wore
on, he got stronger and stronger. He
was just outstanding this weekend."

start against UCLA, Nieves took
advantage of his bench. Ryan Moos,

Joe Burghardt, and Brian Garrett
entered in game three and provided
the needed spark to turn the momen
tum around.
"Our depth was a big factor this
weekend," Nieves explained. "Ryan
came in and passed really well. A lot of
Goss' kills can be credited to Ryan's
passing."
The same trio helped give the Car
dinal the upper hand on Saturday
against USC. Trailing in the second
game, Nieves resorted to his reserves,
hoping to see a repeat performance.
The strategy worked.
"Joe Burghardt played a really
fiery, emotional match," Nieves
remarked of the 6-foot-5 middle block
er. "He served tough, hit well, and his
presence gave the team a big lift."
Nonetheless, as the match at USC
dragged on, fatigue began to play a key
role. "Both teams were noticeably
tired." Nieves commented. "But that's
where Goss shined. As the match wore
on, he got stronger and stronger. He
was just outstanding this weekend."
