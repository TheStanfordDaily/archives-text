# Cardinal bats disappear as Fullerton captures weekend series
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team
faced the first real test of the 1992
season by facing their first ranked
opponents, the Cal State-Fullerton
Titans.
Baseball America ranks the
Cardinal at No. 10 and the Titans
No. 14, while Collegiate Baseball
has Stanford at No. 14 and Fuller
ton ranked fifth. The results show
that the latter publication may be
seeing things more clearly, as the
Titans took two out of three games
from the Cardinal.
The rained-out Friday game was
re-scheduled as the first half of a
double-header on Saturday, a seven
inning game followed by the regular
nine inning matchup.
Stanford's Brian Sackinsky
started the first game on Saturday,
and looked his normal dominating
self. The junior righthander pitched
five and two-thirds innings, allow
ing only five hits and two runs (one
earned) as the Cardinal ended up
taking the game 4-2.
The key offensive play of the
game came in the first inning,
when an infield single by Tony

Better followed by a bunt hit by
Jeffrey Hammonds put runners on
first and second with one out. The
clean-up hitter, catcher Mark
Skeels, proved that he belongs in
the fourth spot, delivering a James
PopofT offering to deep left field to
score both runners with a stand up
double.
"I'm pleased with Skeels," said
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess. "He's a tough out. He lays
off bad pitches, and can put the bat
on the ball."
The second game did not prove
as fortuitous for Stanford. Titan
Ban Naulty pitched a complete
game two-hitter, overpowering the
Cardinal, 8-3. The lone offensive
bright spot for the Cardinal came
in the third. After a walk and an
error put Hammonds on first and
Bave Cornell on second, the
mighty Skeels delivered once again
when he roped a Naulty pitch into
right center field for another stand
up double and another two RBI.
However, that would be all the
offense for Stanford for the rest of
the day. Cardinal starter Tim
Moore looked impressive for the
first five innings, not allowing any
Titan hits. However, in the top of

the sixth, Moore showed signs of
tiring, giving up two doubles and a
home run before being taken out.
Sunday brought the rubber
game, and another lack of offensive
output for the Cardinal. Stanford
managed five hits but just one run
as the Titans won the game 3-1
despite a strong pitching perfor
mance by Cardinal Rick Helling.
The junior righthander went the
distance, getting the complete
game but also the loss, walking
only one and striking out six.
The sole run for the Cardinal
came in the second inning when,
after a Holbrook double, freshman
designated hitter Dusty Allen
lashed a double to left field, scoring
Holbrook.
"I'm definitely concerned
[about the lack of hitting]," said
Marquess. "I was before the sea
son started. It makes it hard to win
if you can't score runs.
We're gonna have to pitch well
and play defense if we're gonna be
in games. "Stanford will have a
chance to display that pitching and
defense today as they take on the
Cal State-Los Angeles Golden
Eagles. The action will begin at
2:00 p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
