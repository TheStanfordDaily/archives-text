# Lineup shuffle does wonders for women's hoops
## Adkins, Paye lead Lady Cagers to easy win 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
For Oregon women's basketball coach Elwin
Heiny, win No. 300 remains elusive. Two days after
California beat his team, Stanford destroyed his
offense and defeated his Ducks again, 74-57, to drop
his career coaching record to 299-135.

Cardinal 74
Ducks 57

Meanwhile, Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer
raised her career record to 309-97 by mixing up her
lineup and having her squad play tough defense.
That defense was sufficient to outweigh a number
of frustrating problems that afflicted the Cardinal
in the game.
One of those problems was with the execution of
its offense. Stanford did not run as successfully as
VanDerveer would have liked, particularly in the
first half.
In the first 20 minutes the Cardinal continued to
play the way it did at Oregon State Thursday,
shooting only 40 percent.
Another problem Stanford had was rebounding.
It was outrebounded 45-35 in the game, but a more
telling statistic is the 20-5 offensive rebounding
edge the Ducks held over the Cardinal. As a result,
Oregon outshot Stanford, 69-54.
That's where the defense comes in. Although the
Ducks took 15 more shots, they only made 35 per
cent of them.
But with Stanford's offense sputtering in the
first half, the Cardinal was up only 31-29 at inter
mission. It was the emergence of the offense in the
second half which helped Stanford pull away.
The Cardinal set to work immediately, going on
an 11-4 run in the first three and a half minutes of
the second period. From that point on Stanford
remained in control.
One major component in the offensive surge was
senior Ann Adkins, who started the game and had a

career night, nailing 4-for-5 three-pointers, all in
the second half, for 12 points. Freshman Kate
Paye, also new to the starting lineup, had a big
game as well. She scored a career-high seven points
and gave out four assists.
But as usual, the workhorse for Stanford was
junior Val Whiting, who led a balanced scoring
attack with 14 points. She also grabbed a game
high 10 rebounds.
Whiting did not score her usual zillion points, as
the Ducks were effectively denying the inside pass
es. But Stanford's perimeter players responded by
bombing away from beyond the three-point arc.
Adkins was the biggest long-range gun, but sev
eral other Cardinal also hit. Molly Goodenbour
drained two treys, while Tanda Rucker and Christy
Hedgpeth each knocked down one.
Hedgpeth's outside shot reappeared this week
end. After a slump in which she missed 11 consecu
tive three-point attempts, she went 2-for-3 on
Thursday and l-for-2 on Saturday.
Stanford will need to work out the kinks in its
offense before Thursday, as the team heads south
to Los Angeles on perhaps the toughest road trip of
the year.

Al Green — Daily file
Kate Paye squares up to shoot against Santa Clara earlier this sea
son. The scrappy freshman scored a season-high seven points in
Saturday's 74-57 win over the University of Oregon.
For Oregon women's basketball coach Elwin
Heiny, win No. 300 remains elusive. Two days after
California beat his team, Stanford destroyed his
offense and defeated his Ducks again, 74-57, to drop
his career coaching record to 299-135.

Cardinal 74
Ducks 57

Meanwhile, Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer
raised her career record to 309-97 by mixing up her
lineup and having her squad play tough defense.
That defense was sufficient to outweigh a number
of frustrating problems that afflicted the Cardinal
in the game.
One of those problems was with the execution of
its offense. Stanford did not run as successfully as
VanDerveer would have liked, particularly in the
first half.
In the first 20 minutes the Cardinal continued to
play the way it did at Oregon State Thursday,
shooting only 40 percent.
Another problem Stanford had was rebounding.
It was outrebounded 45-35 in the game, but a more
telling statistic is the 20-5 offensive rebounding
edge the Ducks held over the Cardinal. As a result,
Oregon outshot Stanford, 69-54.
That's where the defense comes in. Although the
Ducks took 15 more shots, they only made 35 per
cent of them.
But with Stanford's offense sputtering in the
first half, the Cardinal was up only 31-29 at inter
mission. It was the emergence of the offense in the
second half which helped Stanford pull away.
The Cardinal set to work immediately, going on
an 11-4 run in the first three and a half minutes of
the second period. From that point on Stanford
remained in control.
One major component in the offensive surge was
senior Ann Adkins, who started the game and had a

career night, nailing 4-for-5 three-pointers, all in
the second half, for 12 points. Freshman Kate
Paye, also new to the starting lineup, had a big
game as well. She scored a career-high seven points
and gave out four assists.
But as usual, the workhorse for Stanford was
junior Val Whiting, who led a balanced scoring
attack with 14 points. She also grabbed a game
high 10 rebounds.
Whiting did not score her usual zillion points, as
the Ducks were effectively denying the inside pass
es. But Stanford's perimeter players responded by
bombing away from beyond the three-point arc.
Adkins was the biggest long-range gun, but sev
eral other Cardinal also hit. Molly Goodenbour
drained two treys, while Tanda Rucker and Christy
Hedgpeth each knocked down one.
Hedgpeth's outside shot reappeared this week
end. After a slump in which she missed 11 consecu
tive three-point attempts, she went 2-for-3 on
Thursday and l-for-2 on Saturday.
Stanford will need to work out the kinks in its
offense before Thursday, as the team heads south
to Los Angeles on perhaps the toughest road trip of
the year.
