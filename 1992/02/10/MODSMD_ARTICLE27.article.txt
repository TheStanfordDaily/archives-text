# Time runs out on Stanford in Rolex Tourney
## Devens, Flanagan fall in Round 
### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
Leaving the rain of the Bay Area
was little consolation to Stanford ten
nis players Rob Devens and Michael
Flanagan. Accustomed to travelling
to warmer climates to play on sunny
outdoor courts, the duo piled on all
their layers this weekend to square
off in frigid 15-degree Minneapolis,
site of the Rolex National Indoor
Championships.
The Cardinal sophomores, who
have not played together since Octo
ber when they qualified for this tour
nament, upset the third-ranked team
in the nation in their first round, 6-2,
6-2.
"We played a great first match,"
Flanagan said. "We stayed on top of
them and got on them early in the
second set too. It was weird — we
haven't played together in four
months and we beat the No. 3 team in
the country. It was pretty fun."
The tandem did not have quite as
much fun in their second round. They
lost to an eighth-seeded Harvard team
6-4, 7-6 (7-3). "They played solid,"
Flanagan said. "We had a lot of break
points but only broke them once."
Flanagan also made it to the quar
terfinals in the singles draw. He oust
ed Daniel Courcol, the fifth seed, in
straight sets before losing to the
tournament's eventual champion,

Jose Luis Noriega of San Diego, 4-6,
6-1, 6-2.
His first match was especially
important because his opponent was
the same player that he beat in the
quarterfinals of the Volvo All Ameri
can — the tournament through
which he qualified for this Rolex
tourney.
"Its always hard to beat someone
twice because they know what to
expect," Flanagan said.
In the Noriega match, Flanagan
was up in the third set but couldn't
quite pull out the match. "In the sec
ond and third sets he raised his game
and didn't really miss many shots,"
Flanagan said. "I was attacking effec
tively, trying to come in as often as I
could but in the last two sets he came
up with better passing shots and my
serve went off."
Still playing with a brace, Flana
gan's sore wrist did not seem to affect
his play. Assistant coach John
Whitlinger said, "You couldn't notice
it in doubles but he said it was a little
tender."
"It hurt but didn't affect me
because once I got started I'd be
thinking about the match, not my
wrist," Flanagan said.
He probably will not be playing in
Tuesday's home match against San
Jose State but should be back in form
for Friday's big stand-off against a
tough squad from Miami.
