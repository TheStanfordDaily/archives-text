### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
While Stanford and Harvard stu
dents often compete for admissions to
medical schools, the Cardinal's Laxmi
Poruri and Crimson's Erika deLone
battled for a spot in the finals of the
Rolex National Indoor Championships.
Poruri won the first set 6-3 and
was up early in the second when, in a
sense, the roof caved in. She dropped
the set 6-2.
The players pushed the third set to
a tiebreaker, which deLone won 7-1.
"I let it slip," said Poruri, who was
the No. 6 seed. "On big points I made
errors and she played steadier. She
also hit a couple of passing shots I
didn't expect." Despite the loss, the
Poruri was pleased with the Min
neapolis tourney. "I'm making steady
progress. I didn't play up to my poten
tial but it's midseason and I don't
want to peak yet," Poruri said. Also,
she pointed out, deLone is no
pushover. The Harvard player is
ranked No. 107 in the world.
The match was held at the
Crosstown Racquet Club rather than
the 98th Street complex where the
first two days of competition took
place. The change was made to accom
modate Prime Ticket's television cam
eras and a larger audience. Crosstown
has more room for stands and its sur
face, Supreme, reflects less light.

"IPlayingat Crosstown] was a little
different. The points are a lot shorter
on carpet," Poruri said. "It's impor
tant to get the first serve in and the
game style is more aggressive, but [the
change] didn't bother me."
No. 4 seed Heather Willens didn't
get a chance to test the faster courts
as she fell to Kansas' Eveline Hamers
in the second round 6-3, 0-6, 7-5.
"[The pace] was dictated by her and
I didn't feel in the match," Willens
said. "It wasn't as close as it looked.
lln the second set] it was more of her
missing shots than me hitting them."
The Cardinal junior added, "I haven't
really been playing my game lately.
I'm an aggressive player and when I'm
not playing aggressively I'm not
good."
Willens believes her play indicates a
change in her approach to matches.
"I'm thinking about winning too
much. I should just hit the ball and not
worry about whether it goes in or out.
The problem of not being able to
control a match also plagued Willens
in doubles. She and Poruri lost to Ari
zona's Banni Redhair and Danielle
Scott in the quarterfinals.
"I never felt we got overpowered,"
Willens said of the 6-3, 1-6,6-2 match.
"We could have won the match easi
ly," Poruri said. "We made errors —
missing easy volleys. We had a lot of
break points but played loose, not
intense."
