### Larry Liu Staff writer 
The Stanford wrestling team returned to its
winning ways Saturday as they thoroughly
thrashed San Francisco State 37-16 in the Car
dinal's next-to-last dual meet of the season.
Considering that 12 of SFSU's points came
from forfeits makes Stanford's victory even
more more impressive. Only six matches were
wrestled, and the grapplers finished off their
opponents in 50 minutes.
The Cardinal was paced by strong perfor
mances by all team members. Phil Nowick, Jay
Jackson, and senior co-captain Mark Graham
recorded technical falls in their victories. Now
ick defeated Mark Zonglit by a margin of 20-5,
Jackson crushed Alex Hayworth 19-3, and Gra
ham shut out Simon Kiefer 15-0.
At 150 pounds, senior co-captain Dave Sacks
missed a technical fall by one point and settled
for a 14-0 major decision over SFSU's Curtis
Mitchell.
At 142 pounds, Lance Johnson continued to
shine since his return last week from injury.
Johnson prevailed in his match by pinning Hec
tor Perla 1:15 into the second period.
Coach Chris Horpel was definitely pleased
with the turnout of the meet. "This is what we
were hoping for. Our goal was not just to win
our matches, but also to dominate.
Stanford will now look forward to next
week's encounter with Fresno State. Fresno
State is sporting its best team in a decade, with
a squad of nine potential NCAA qualifiers, and
has beaten every team in the West.
"Fresno State will be our toughest dual meet
of the season," said Horpel. "[The meet] will be
our last measuring stick for the Pac-lOs.
Though we may not win next week, our condi
tioning is right, and we should be ready for the
Pac-lOs."
