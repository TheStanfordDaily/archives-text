# Students grumbling over Bookstore perks
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
Most students say they were
surprised by The Daily's Feb. 5 dis
closure of the host of perquisites
available to senior Bookstore
employees, but their other reac
tions varied widely.
Some students were fatalistic,
while others talked of boycotting
the store.
The Daily disclosed that the
Bookstore has been leasing a
vacation home from a consulting
firm owned and operated by the
Bookstore's two top managers,
Eldon Speed and Philip Chiara
monte.
The Bookstore also provides its
top employees with several auto
mobiles and a leased motorhome,
The Daily reported.
Several students said yester
day they believed there was some
relation between high textbook
prices, reduced rebates and the
employee perquisites.
"I want a bigger rebate," said
third-year law student David Forst.
Other students criticized the

Bookstore's dominant position on
campus.
"They have a monopoly," said
freshman Kyongbum Lee. "That's
the problem. There should be
another bookstore so there can be
more competition."
Another freshman, Dan Gilley,
said, "It seems like we're being
screwed at every end. . . . [The
BookstoreJ has a complete
monopoly. The textbooks I need
for my classes just aren't avail
able at other stores."
Some students have decided to
boycott the Bookstore. "I have to
buy most of my books there, but I
won't buy any of my supplies
there," said freshman Lisa Ramp
ton.
Council of Presidents member
John Overdeck said yesterday
that student action concerning
the issue is likely.
"A few people have mentioned
boycotts," he said. "But the only
real recourse is if students get so
fed up with the Bookstore that they
take their business elsewhere....
That would mean that a lot of
people would have to be really
angry to make a difference,
because the Bookstore is so conve
nient."
Overdeck said an alternative
bookstore does not seem like a
real option. "The University
probably would not allow it,"he
said. Overdeck added that
"there's no point in competing
with the Bookstore" because it
ultimately would not save stu
dents any money. "If there

were competition, they'd cut
prices, which means they would
cut rebates, too," Overdeck
said.
One freshman, Girish Khera,
said he did not mind the
perquisites, as long as they did
not affect prices.
"I only mind if it means they're
putting an undue expense on us,"
Khera said. "It's only wrong if
they're inflating prices to support
their luxuries."
Senior Damien Atkins said
that some perquisites may be
necessary in order to keep top
quality managers, but added, "I
don't know if they should go that
far."

The Bookstore's board of direc
tors will hold a meeting tomorrow
to discuss the situation.
Most top Bookstore officials
have not responded to media
inquiries following the disclo
sures.
The Bookstore did publish a
four-page publication called the
Bookstore Gazette which was
distributed at the Bookstore
and other campus locations Fri
day.
History Prof. Peter Stansky,
president of the Bookstore's
board, said the Gazette was
proposed several months ago
and is not a reaction to the pub
licity the Bookstore has been

getting.
"It is another avenue of getting
coupons to the public," said Rose
Sims, the Bookstore's director of
customer relations.
The publication includes
coupons and several short articles
about rebates and the Bookstore's
recently completed remodelling
project.
According to the Gazette, "Now
that the remodel is over, and busi
ness is getting back to normal,
one might expect that the rebate
for this year will be good."
Although the Gazette was
dated Feb. 15, it was distributed
Feb. 7 and the coupons expire
Feb. 15.
