Another freshman, Dan Gilley,
said, "It seems like we're being
screwed at every end. . . . [The
BookstoreJ has a complete
monopoly. The textbooks I need

won't buy any of my supplies
there," said freshman Lisa Ramp
ton.
Council of Presidents member
John Overdeck said yesterday
that student action concerning
the issue is likely.
"A few people have mentioned
boycotts," he said. "But the only
real recourse is if students get so
fed up with the Bookstore that they
take their business elsewhere....
