# Self-defense supporters storm president's office
## Women plan to confront trustees today 
### Alain Dalva Staff writer 
Chanting "Self-defense for women â€”
defending our lives," 20 women marched
into University President Donald Kennedy's
reception room Friday to protest budget
cutting plans that would eliminate a decade
old self-defense course. A dozen more
protesters waited outside.
When the women demanded that an
assistant fetch Kennedy, the assistant
responded, "I think he heard you already."
Kennedy emerged from an adjoining
room and interrupted the ruckus, saying,
"Excuse me. Hi. Do you have something for
me?"
"Yes," answered senior Jennifer Pearson,
a representative of the Women's Center Col
lective, amid nervous laugher from some
protesters.
Pearson voiced the group's concern that
"the University has not shown its financial
commitment" to Issues in Self-Defense for
Women, a SWOPSI course slated to be cut if
the School of Humanities and Sciences
eliminates the Innovative Academic Cours
es program. Cutting lAC would save the
school $180,000 annually.
According to materials from the Women's

Center Collective, each of the three self
defense course offered per quarter costs
$1,200 to run, making the annual cost
$10,800.
"The budget-cutting process is in its
early stages and all kinds of people and
organizations are making representations
for budget convictions," Kennedy respond
ed. He added that he would listen to the
group's concerns, calling its representation
"impressive and forceful."
Pearson told Kennedy the group intends
to confront the Board of Trustees after its
meeting today in Littlefield Center to
"demonstrate that our worries are real"
concerning the course and the threat to
continued funding for sexual assault pre
vention.
But Kennedy advised his audience not to
try to "visit the Board of Trustees in this
way," saying that it would not be helpful to
the group's cause.
Kennedy said he would be glad to look at
"any material" the group has. But Susan
Epstein, coordinator of student sexual
assault prevention education and referral
resources, told Kennedy that he did not read
a December 1991 letter she had written on
