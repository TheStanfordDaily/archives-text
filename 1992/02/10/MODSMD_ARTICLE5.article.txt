# Self-defense supporters storm president's office
## Women plan to confront trustees today 
### Alain Dalva Staff writer 
Chanting "Self-defense for women â€”
defending our lives," 20 women marched
into University President Donald Kennedy's
reception room Friday to protest budget
cutting plans that would eliminate a decade
old self-defense course. A dozen more
protesters waited outside.
When the women demanded that an
assistant fetch Kennedy, the assistant
responded, "I think he heard you already."
Kennedy emerged from an adjoining
room and interrupted the ruckus, saying,
"Excuse me. Hi. Do you have something for
me?"
"Yes," answered senior Jennifer Pearson,
a representative of the Women's Center Col
lective, amid nervous laugher from some
protesters.
Pearson voiced the group's concern that
"the University has not shown its financial
commitment" to Issues in Self-Defense for
Women, a SWOPSI course slated to be cut if
the School of Humanities and Sciences
eliminates the Innovative Academic Cours
es program. Cutting lAC would save the
school $180,000 annually.
According to materials from the Women's

Center Collective, each of the three self
defense course offered per quarter costs
$1,200 to run, making the annual cost
$10,800.
"The budget-cutting process is in its
early stages and all kinds of people and
organizations are making representations
for budget convictions," Kennedy respond
ed. He added that he would listen to the
group's concerns, calling its representation
"impressive and forceful."
Pearson told Kennedy the group intends
to confront the Board of Trustees after its
meeting today in Littlefield Center to
"demonstrate that our worries are real"
concerning the course and the threat to
continued funding for sexual assault pre
vention.
But Kennedy advised his audience not to
try to "visit the Board of Trustees in this
way," saying that it would not be helpful to
the group's cause.
Kennedy said he would be glad to look at
"any material" the group has. But Susan
Epstein, coordinator of student sexual
assault prevention education and referral
resources, told Kennedy that he did not read
a December 1991 letter she had written on
the subject.
Epstein said later that the let
ter was addressed to the deans of
Humanities and Sciences, not
Kennedy.
Epstein's letter requested that
the school keep the course, which
is offered through Stanford
Workshops on Political and Social
Issues. It is not clear whether
Kennedy received a copy of the
letter.
Kennedy cut the discussion
short without acknowledging
Epstein's comment. He told the
women's group to make an
appointment with him, then left
the reception room.
The demonstrators next went
to Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Ewart Thomas' office, but
Thomas was not there to hear
their complaints.
Epstein later said that the
School of Humanities and Sciences
sent her a thank-you note regard
ing her letter. But Senior Associ
ate Dean Carolyn Lougee, one of
the deans Epstein said she sent the
letter to, told The Daily last week
that she never received it.
The exchange with Kennedy
followed an open meeting in
White Plaza Friday at noon to
protest the course's uncertain
future.
About 50 women and a handful
of men gathered to voice their
frustration about the projected
cuts, cheering and applauding the
various speakers.

Defense for Women.

director, said she was "100 per
cent committed" to the course,
but the program does not have
any money. "It's a terrible
defeat," she said, encouraging the
audience to "express your anger."
Horn said the Feminist Stud
ies Program may come up with
some funding for the class. But
Pearson said she is concerned
over the uncertainty of the funds
for Feminist Studies in the long
run.
"We need to be institutional
ized," Pearson said, adding that
the course "is not an extracurric
ular activity."
Alumna Jane Benson, a found
ing member of the Women Center
Collective, which was started in
1976, said she has been strug
gling for women's rights in recent
years and hopes that the present
budget cuts will not undermine
her work. "Help me retire. Keep
self-defense," she said.
Sophomore Clea Koff said the
course is fundamental because it
teaches women to be assertive on
an everyday basis and not just in
peculiar situations. She added
that she believes women should
not feel "paranoid and scared just
because [they are] women."
