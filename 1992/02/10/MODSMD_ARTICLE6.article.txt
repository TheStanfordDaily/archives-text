# Animal researcher barred from lab
## Investigation means USDA probably won't take on case 
### Chris Eisenberg Staff writer 
Although an inspector with the U.S.
Department of Agriculture probably will not
recommend launching an investigation into a
laboratory animal mistreatment case at Stan
ford, University officials have not allowed the
researcher to return to his work.
USDA inspector Dr. Homer Malaby looked
into the incident last Monday during a rou
tine, unannounced inspection of Stanford's
Research Animal Facility.
Malaby has completed his inspection report
and was satisfied with Stanford's response to
the incident, according to Dr. V. Wensley
Coch, assistant sector supervisor in the
USDA's Sacramento office.
"[Malaby] indicated that by the time he got
there [Stanford | had pretty much handled it,"
Coch said. As a result, Coch said she does not
expect Malaby to recommend that the USDA
launch an investigation.
Dr. Thomas Hamm, chair of the Depart
ment of Comparative Medicine, which is
responsible for the facility, refused to identify
the researcher involved or to discuss the type
of animal involved in the incident, citing the
possibility of personal threats by animal
rights groups.

But Hamm did specifically deny one rumor
he has heard. "I think people deciding we are
ripping skin off of a sheep is a lot worse than
what would really ever happen here," he said.
Stanford is required by law to self-report any
cases of animal mistreatment to the USDA.
Coch said Stanford reported this incident
"sometime in December or January."
Although the USDA is satisfied with Stan
ford's response to the incident, University
officials have stopped the researcher's work
while they continue to investigate the inci
dent, Hamm said. He said he did not know
wether the experiment would be resumed
after the investigation
"We are still in the process of determining
the eventual outcome," Hamm said. "His
research is currently on hold."
According to Hamm, an incident serious
enough to merit stopping the experiment
usually happens at Stanford once or twice a
year.
While animal research is also conducted by
professors in the Biology and Psychology
Departments, the vast majority is done by
researchers from the Medical Center, Hamm
said. Actual experiments are usually conduct
ed in the Research Animal Facility itself.
The facility, a $30-million underground com
plex completed nearly eight years ago, houses

over 55,000 laboratory animals. Although 93
percent of the animals are mice and rats, the
facility holds a number of monkeys, sheep, dogs,
cats and birds, among others.
Several local animal-rights activists were
critical of the University for its secrecy regard
ing the case.
Palo Alto resident Lise Giraud, co-director of
education for the San Rafael-based In Defense
of Animals, criticized University officials for
not disclosing the researcher's identity.
"It's a total disgrace," Giraud said. "We
should all know. There should be public
accountability for research [conducted] with
public funds."
Stanford junior Joceyln Lee, president of
Students Concerned for Animal Welfare, said
her group is considering organizing a protest
rally.
