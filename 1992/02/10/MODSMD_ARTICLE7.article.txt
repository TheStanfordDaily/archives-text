Umoja, a Swahili word meaning unity, was the
theme of a Friday night program called "Getting
Black to Basics: Mind, Body and Soul." The event
was the centerpiece of Stanford's Black Liberation
Month celebration.
"As long as we allow asphalt boundaries, geo
graphic locations, economic differences to divide us,
we cannot begin to move forward," said Law Prof.
Kim Taylor, one of the event's two keynote speakers,
to the capacity audience in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Outlining a plan of action for rebuilding the
African-American community, Taylor urged mem
bers of the audience to leave "distrust and petty dif
ferences at the door" and instead focus on "open,
honest communication" as a means of solving the
problems facing black Americans.
"Ready or not, we must begin to talk with one
another now, if we have any real hope of moving our
community, ourselves, away from procedures that are
self-destructive, towards activities that are creative
and constructive," Taylor said. "We must have vision."
She challenged students to extend the boundaries
of the black community beyond "the Farm" to include
the large black communities of East Palo Alto, Harlem
and other places where "young African-American men
and women are dying at alarming rates.
