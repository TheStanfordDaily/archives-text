# 'Leave distrust ... at the door'
## Speakers urge honest talk to solve community woes 
### Cheo H. Coker Staff writer 
Umoja, a Swahili word meaning unity, was the
theme of a Friday night program called "Getting
Black to Basics: Mind, Body and Soul." The event
was the centerpiece of Stanford's Black Liberation
Month celebration.
"As long as we allow asphalt boundaries, geo
graphic locations, economic differences to divide us,
we cannot begin to move forward," said Law Prof.
Kim Taylor, one of the event's two keynote speakers,
to the capacity audience in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Outlining a plan of action for rebuilding the
African-American community, Taylor urged mem
bers of the audience to leave "distrust and petty dif
ferences at the door" and instead focus on "open,
honest communication" as a means of solving the
problems facing black Americans.
"Ready or not, we must begin to talk with one
another now, if we have any real hope of moving our
community, ourselves, away from procedures that are
self-destructive, towards activities that are creative
and constructive," Taylor said. "We must have vision."
She challenged students to extend the boundaries
of the black community beyond "the Farm" to include
the large black communities of East Palo Alto, Harlem
and other places where "young African-American men
and women are dying at alarming rates.

Junior Nelda Brown remembers the origins of Black Liberation Month at Friday's pre
sentation titled "Getting Black to Basics: Mind, Body and Soul." The evening featured
Law Prof. Kim Taylor and Political Science Prof. Lucius Barker, who urged strong
leadership as a solution to racial woes.
"As long as we allow the door
to remain closed between us,
there is no way that we can draw
strength from each other and
begin to develop our plan of
action to move us towards the
future," Taylor said. "We, as a
community, cannot sit back and
wait for some anointed leader to
descend and solve these problems
for us."
Political Science Prof. Lucius
Barker, the other keynote
speaker, focused his attention
on the relationship between the
black community and the gov
ernment.
"We are witnessing the tri
umph of symbols and rhetoric
over substance and reality," Bark
er said. "How else can you explain
that civil rights policies of the
1950s and '60s are now being
used to suggest that enough has
been done for blacks and minori
ties . . . obscuring the fact that in
reality much of the promise and
spirit of these policies remains yet
to be fulfilled?"
Like Taylor, Barker recom
mended strong leadership as a
possible solution to this conflict.
"It is imperative that we develop
and put forward leadership cadres
throughout the political/social
system, leadership that will not
succumb to the trappings and
influence of office and position,"
Barker said.
Dancer/poet Marshell Jones,
the students of Shule Mandela
Academy and the student rap
group The Seven Principles also
performed at the celebration.
Junior Nelda Brown, who
coordinated the event, said she
thought "people reacted very pos
itively to the speeches and perfor
mances."
