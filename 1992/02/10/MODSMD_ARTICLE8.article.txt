Trade dispute possible, Quayle warns
MUNICH, Germany (AP) — Vice President Dan Quayle yes
terday warned of a potential crisis in trans-Atlantic ties if global
trade talks fail.
Discarding the prepared text of a speech on security matters,
he used sharp language on the trade dispute to an audience of
European politicians, diplomats and military figures at the 29th
annual security conference in Munich.
The United States wants Germany to use its weight within the
European Community to sway other EC members into scrapping
farm subsidies, an issue that has stalemated the trade talks.
Of the impasse, Quayle said: "We have to get on with it... If
we don't, this will be a crisis and a trans-Atlantic problem of very
severe proportions." -
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks aim to set
more liberal rules for world trade, but they have been bogged
down for months. Quayle called an accord "absolutely critical to
the security of the United States."
Hammering at Hammer's house
FREMONT, Calif. (AP) — Workers are clamoring to work on
rap star Hammer's new $6.5 million home, and judging from the
construction plans, there's plenty of labor for everyone.
"Everybody wants to work on Hammer's house," said glass
block layer Randy Tester. "I told my boss a year ago that I want
ed to do this job. I'm happy I was picked. It's cool because it
makes the other guys so envious."
Hammer's 15,000-square-foot house is being built in the
rolling hills of Fremont, about 25 miles south of Oakland. He's
seeking approval of a 17,000-square-foot "addition" that includes
a recording studio, dance floor, bowling alley and nine-car garage.
The house, which has a 66-speaker sound system, will not be
ready for several months. Hammer will live there with his wife
and their 4-year-old daughter.
Study: Speech patterns predict health
CHICAGO (AP) — Pauses in speech can be used to predict
heart attacks, adjust medication and even test for drug abuse,
experts say.
Short halts in speech, some lasting just micro-seconds, act like
an echo of inner health when the patterns are interpreted by com
puter, said Dr. Ernest Friedman, a psychiatrist and researcher at
Case Western Reserve University.
Speaking at a meeting here of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, Friedman said doctors using the speech
analysis technique can monitor the health of their patients just by
talking with them on the phone.
