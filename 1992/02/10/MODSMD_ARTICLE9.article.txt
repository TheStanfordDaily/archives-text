# Racial tension up at Stanford
## Hoover fellow's study called dated by some 
### Grace Lee 
Students say racial tensions at
Stanford have increased in recent
years, according to a recently pub
lished study by Hoover Senior
Fellow John Bunzel.
Bunzel's book, "Race Relations
on Campus: Stanford Students
Speak," is based on data from
questionnaires and one-on-one
interviews with Stanford stu
dents.
Bunzel said the 54 interview
participants were not selected sci
entifically. His nine-page ques
tionnaires were sent out to a ran
dom sample of 862 seniors in
1989. Of these students, 452
responded.
Bunzel's study reported that
almost 90 percent of students feel
there is a lack of substantial inter
racial interaction at parties and
other social events on campus.
However, more than 70 percent of
students surveyed said they felt
"quite" or "very" comfortable
around other students of differ
ent races.
The study also addressed vol
untary segregation. The majority
of both black students and white
students thought black students
segregated themselves to a large
degree on campus, according to
the study.
Members of the Stanford com
munity had mixed reactions to
Bunzel's findings.
Senior Omar Wasow, a resi
dence assistant at Ujamaa who
plans to do his honors thesis on
campus race relations, said he
regards Bunzel's book as "fairly
accurate." However, he criticized
Bunzel for seeming to "gloss
over" certain statistics.

For example, although 45 per
cent of black students surveyed
said they spent a lot of time in
ethnic theme houses, Bunzel
wrote that "the level of student
involvement with the theme
houses is low."
"I was like, 'Wait! That's 45
percent!"' said Wasow.
Wasow added that the cam
pus was more "politically
charged" a few years ago, when
the study was conducted. "It
seems kind of dated to some
degree," he said.
Senior Angela Hilton, commu
nity service coordinator at the
Black Community Service Center
and a former officer of the Black
Student Union, agreed that racial
tensions are increasing.
"Not just in terms of Stan
ford," she said, "but in America —
the rise of hate groups and hate
crimes. All that's happening [out
side of] Stanford affects how we
interact [on campus]."
Hilton said she viewed volun
tary segregation in the form of
black student groups as "neces
sary" rather than "separatist."
"You're more comfortable with

your family," she said.
Freshman Clark Moore, who is
white, also identified the need for
separate communities. "There is
a fine line between identifying
with your own community and
becoming part of the whole," he
said.
Bunzel's study revealed marked
differences between black stu
dents' and white students' percep
tions of racism. According to the
report, most white students per
ceived racism on a personal level,
defining it as the "degrading of
other people because of their
color."
Black students quoted in Bun
zel's study viewed racism as an
institutional problem, citing the
"white power structure on cam
pus."
"This is the kind of issue that
provokes a lot of discussion,"
Bunzel said. "[The study] is very
helpful. It's very necessary. It's
what a university is all about."
Bunzel said he is looking for
ward to hearing reactions to his
book. "I would hope that they are
spirited, fair and provocative," he
said.
