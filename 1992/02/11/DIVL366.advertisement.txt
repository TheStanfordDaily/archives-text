ST SUNDAY
la BRUNCHES!
â€” Brought to You by the
Student Alumni Network
You and your friends are invited to join other students
and Stanford faculty for a delicious, home' Cooked
brunch in the house of a local alum on Sunday, March
1 and Sunday, April 26. The brunches are a great
chance to talk about careers, majors, and life after
Stanford, and to meet professors and alumni in an
informal setting outside of class.
Sign up for these brunches this week in the lobby of
Boivman Alumni House. There is limited space, so
sign up early! For more information, contact Amy or
Marybelle at 725-STAN.
Sponsored by the Student Alumni Network (STAN)
and the Stanford Alumni Association.
