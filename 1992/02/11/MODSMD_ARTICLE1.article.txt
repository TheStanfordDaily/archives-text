# Gas leak fourth Deke problem since last April
## 
### Leigh Burnside Staff writer 
A member of the Delta Kappa
Epsilon fraternity discovered
free-flowing gas in the Deke
house kitchen last week in what
may have been the fourth poten
tially lethal prank against the
Dekes in less than a year.
The student, who would not
speak to The Daily, discovered
last Tuesday that the gas jets to
the kitchen oven had been turned
completely on and the pilot lights
were shut off, according to the
police report.
Stanford Police Detective Tim
othy Frecceri described the situa
tion as having "a great potential
for danger."
The incident was discovered
just before noon and subsequent
ly reported to the police. Deke
President John Momtazee hypo
thesized that the gas had been
flowing since earlier in the morn
ing. However, Frecceri said the
gas may have been escaping for
only about 10 minutes.
He said the police have not yet
determined who is responsible,
but "are considering all options,"
including the possibility that a
Deke member is the guilty party.
Frecceri said the incident
"doesn't appear to be a common
(fraternity) prank" and that "a
serious intention to harm" may
have been the motive.
Momtazee said there are those
who "may have ill will" against
the fraternity, but added that it is
"all speculation at this point."
He said he does not think a
member of the fraternity is
responsible.
The police are considering the
case "a repeat thing," since a sim
ilar incident occurred during
April of last year, Frecceri said.
The Deke kitchen stove and
floor were destroyed during a fire
caused by two 54-ounce contain
ers of barbecue lighter fluid,
which had been left in the oven
at the highest heat. The contain
ers melted, causing the confla
gration.
Momtazee said an ensuing
investigation, which included the
fingerprinting of all Deke members

and their submitting to polygraph
tests, did not result in a culprit.
Earlier that month, two separate
incidents occurred in which coffee
and grape juice were poisoned with
plant fertilizer and paint thinner,
respectively. Police made no arrests
in either of those incidents.
After the April occurrences, Deke
members improved the house's
security system, having the building
rekeyed and automatic locking fix
tures installed on the doors.
The University replaced the
stove, and Momtazee said the new
stove requires "a purposeful
effort" to put out the pilot light.
