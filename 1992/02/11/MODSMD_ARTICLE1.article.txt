# Gas leak fourth Deke problem since last April

### Leigh Burnside Staff writer 
A member of the Delta Kappa
Epsilon fraternity discovered
free-flowing gas in the Deke
house kitchen last week in what
may have been the fourth poten
tially lethal prank against the
Dekes in less than a year.
The student, who would not
speak to The Daily, discovered
last Tuesday that the gas jets to
the kitchen oven had been turned
completely on and the pilot lights
were shut off, according to the
police report.
Stanford Police Detective Tim
othy Frecceri described the situa
tion as having "a great potential
for danger."
The incident was discovered
just before noon and subsequent
ly reported to the police. Deke
President John Momtazee hypo

flowing since earlier in the morn

gas may have been escaping for
only about 10 minutes.
He said the police have not yet
determined who is responsible,
but "are considering all options,"
including the possibility that a
Deke member is the guilty party.
Frecceri said the incident
"doesn't appear to be a common
(fraternity) prank" and that "a
serious intention to harm" may
have been the motive.
Momtazee said there are those
who "may have ill will" against
the fraternity, but added that it is
"all speculation at this point."
He said he does not think a
member of the fraternity is
responsible.
The police are considering the
case "a repeat thing," since a sim
ilar incident occurred during
