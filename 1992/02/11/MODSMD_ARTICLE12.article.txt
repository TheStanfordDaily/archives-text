Tyson guilty of rape
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Boxer Mike Tyson was found guilty
Monday of raping a Miss Black America contestant who said she
was lured to his hotel room and overpowered.
Tyson faces a maximum prison sentence of 60 years.
The conviction threatens to end the rags-to-riches career of
one of the nation's most prominent athletes. Tyson, at 20, was
the youngest heavyweight champion ever and had been planning
a comeback this spring.
Tyson, 25, sat staring impassively as the verdict was read. He
was found guilty of all the charges he faced — one count of rape
and two counts of criminal deviate conduct.
Each count carries prison sentences ranging from six to 20
years and fines up to $10,000. The judge dismissed a fourth
charge of confinement during the trial.
The 18-year-old victim was not in court for the verdict,
although she was there during closing arguments.
Asked what his most effective evidence was, prosecutor Greg
Garrison said, "That beautiful 18-year-old kid with a pure heart.
She's a young person with a lot of courage."
Sentencing was set for March 6. Tyson was allowed to remain
free and surrendered his passport.
The jury deliberated nine hours Monday after nine days of tes
timony from 50 witnesses.
