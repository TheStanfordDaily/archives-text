## Renewing lost trust 
### 
Bookstore must take
concrete measures to
assuage student doubts

The winter air turns
the steam swirling from
their $4,341 hot tub into fog
as it rolls across the deck toward
their magnificent Twain Harte
vacation home.
Pine trees tower; the Infinity and
Cadillac are safe in the two-car
garage; and their business, the Stan
ford Bookstore, is paying for the lux
ury, including the $209,000 they
have borrowed to build the home.
According to History Prof. Peter
Stansky — the current president
of the Bookstore's board — the
store's top two managers, Eldon
Speed and Philip Chiaramonte, are
worth it.
The Stanford community should
decide that.
Although the Stanford Bookstore
is an independent corporation, its
pampered top managers still reflect
poorly on the community.
After a year and a half of nation
al criticism of the University's
indirect-cost recovery practices,
the image of opulence within an
organization on Stanford land is
sure to feed a public mind current
ly on a Stanford feeding frenzy.
Already, Bay Area disc jockeys are
joking about the issue. Said one: Bill
Walsh took the wrong job at Stan
ford. The perks were much better at
the Bookstore.
Local television news showed its
viewers the closed door to Building
10 — where top administrators
reside — ostensibly to symbolize
that the University is hiding some
involvement.
But even more important than
the public mind is the communi
ty's trust.
Stanford students rely heavily on
the Bookstore. The store's rebate
system had been a commitment from
Bookstore managers to students: We
will give you the best bookstore pos

sible, and we will run a tight ship.
Whatever's left, we'll refund.
Unfortunately, that commit
ment has been broken.
Several measures must be taken
immediately if the Bookstore is to
regain the trust of the community.
First, Speed and Chiaramonte
should break the lease agreement
between their consulting firm —
which owns the wooded retreat and
which hasn't had a client in years
— and the Bookstore. If that means
an end to the supposed long-run
benefits to Bookstore, so be it.
After it is broken, full disclosure
of the agreement should be made.
The community should know, for
instance, how much the Bookstore
has already paid toward the loans.
Second, an independent auditor
should be hired to give a public
report on the compensation struc
ture at the Bookstore. Have some
employees been underpaid to com
pensate for high-end perquisites?
How much of the luxurious spend
ing should have gone to student
rebates?
Third, the Bookstore's board of
directors should increase its level of
scrutiny of Bookstore operations.
So far, the board seems to have
traded its financial responsibility
for the relative ease of an annual
banquet and a rubber stamp.
And fourth, the community must
be satisfied that the Bookstore's
compensation practices are "reason
able," the standard set for non-prof
its by state and federal tax laws.
It is difficult to criticize Speed
and Chiaramonte's management
skills. Clearly, they have created a
big money-maker. What's more,
they have created a multilevel,
grand marketplace of products that
places the Bookstore among the
best in the nation.
Still, compensation practices as
unusual as the Bookstore's are too
high a price to pay to have the
country's best collection of cardi
nal red baseball caps and chem
istry textbooks. Revitalization of
the Bookstore's trust can only
begin when wide-reaching reforms
are implemented.
