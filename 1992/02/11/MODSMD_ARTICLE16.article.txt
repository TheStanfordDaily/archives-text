## Beyond black and white 
### 
1 CRIED LAST WEEK when a black
man thought I was racist. He asked if
I would give him a dollar for his crum
pled bill as we stood at the Tresidder
change machine. I thought I only had
two, both of which I needed to make
copies for a class I was already late for.
When I looked down at my hand and
realized there were three dollars, I
offered him the extra bill, but he refused,
saying, "You didn't even look when I
asked you." I apologized, trying to
explain my mistake, but he replied, "I
don't want your money." And there was
nothing I could say to change his mind.
What did I do? Why did he jump to the
conclusion that I was prejudiced? Was it
because of his stereotype of Asians or
non-blacks in general? Have people shied
away from him for so long, feeling threat
ened by a black man on the street, so that
now he thinks everyone is like that?
Multiculturalism is not a dead issue.
People can laugh at Stanford's treatment
of it, but we can not stop discussing and
criticizing it.
In response to the recent Residential
Education survey, an upperclassman
said, "We don't need to have multicultur
al programming because we already
know about that stuff Well, it wasn't a
freshman who expressed his views at
Otero in offensive language, non-con
ducive to discussion. And it wasn't a
freshman in Zapata who thought that

people are to be taken advantage of or
manipulated.
The problems at Stanford are complex
and multiple, as they are everywhere
else. Unlike Hoover Fellow John Bunzel,
we cannot limit our focus to black/white
issues. For his new book, "Race Relations
On Campus: Stanford Students Speak,"
Bunzel surveyed and interviewed only
black and white students. In the Campus
Report of Feb. 5, he is quoted as explain
ing, "These are the ones that are most
often at the heart of the controversy, not
only at Stanford but on most campuses
today."
By limiting his own study, he is him
self making black and white race rela
tions the "heart of the controversy."
Once again, all other conflicts are swept
under the rug and not discussed. And nei
ther is it merely whites against "people of
color," the Big Four of red, yellow, black
and brown. All of us hold prejudices and
misconceptions about each other, and
these are fed by our own separate cul
tures as well as each other's.
According to the article, Bunzel found
differing definitions of racism — the
belief that people of all races can be racist
versus the belief that racism involves
oppression by the racial group in power.
However, the author of the Campus
Report article then uses the term
"reverse discrimination," exposing an
implicit assumption that prejudice

'In "exploring
culture," we must
go beyond eating
sushi, wearing
moccasins or
watching "Do the
Right Thing."'

against whites is somehow in a class all
on its own.
Tell me, is there some other term for
Korean discrimination against blacks or
Chicano prejudice against Vietnamese? Or
has no one made up a new word because
we don't talk about it in the first place?
On this campus alone there is so much
that needs to be talked about. We need to
go beyond "exploring culture" — beyond
eating sushi, wearing moccasins or even
watching "Do the Right Thing." These
may be starting places, but discussion
must follow about ourselves, about each
other and about what is really going on
here underneath the "peaceful" coexis
tence.
So don't tell me not to write about
multiculturalism because you're sick of it
or because we already have three other
"people of color" columnists. I may be the
only woman, but there is more to it than
that making us each distinct, and there is
more to multiculturalism than what four
columnists may or may not have said.
This is only the beginning.

Jane Lin's next column might be about
multiculturalism or Alaskan dogs and
the French Revolution.
