Community's 'decline' falsely blamed on its diversity

IN HIS FEB. 7 LETTER TO The
Daily, Keith Rabois professes to fore
see the present and future decline
and fall of Stanford University. He
argues that this institution's misguided
adherence to "multicultural decision
making" is the vicious cause of this fall
from liberalism.
It is time that we unmask these
specious attempts to blame our commu
nity's alleged decay on educators who
favor diversity.
As an undergraduate at Stanford, I
created my own focus within the major

of English literature. I concentrated on
the works of African and Caribbean
writers and on the structures of colonial
ism that brought about English and
French language literatures in great
number of countries around the world. I
also investigated the works of writers of
color, as they are currently named, in
this country.
My interest in black writers came from
no place other than Western culture itself.
It came from the quest for our intellectual
enlightenment that our revered canon
tells us had its roots centuries ago in Cen

tral Europe. It came from the democratic
impulses that Thomas Jefferson and his
friends ensured would guide our country
to the human world surrounding our
small enclave.
If we would step back from our imme
diate grief and anger at Rabois' hatred
speech, which I freely give to him, we
would see that he is the true enemy of
the Western Culture of which he speaks.
He is the champion of restrictions on
ignorance which lead our country astray.
What he regards as the "harassing" poli
cy and atmosphere of Stanford Universi

ty and its community is the strength of a
community that cannot be fooled.
If anything, I see this country and
our region entering a new era of vibran
cy and creativity. Far from the destruc
tiveness that Rabois predicts, I see a
people who are finally taking their Dec
laration of Independence seriously when
it reminds them, by principle if not by
rule, that we are all entitled to fairness,
freedom and a relief from the oppression
of Old World persecution and ostracism.
