# Goals stated in letter secure no one's rights

### 
In his letter which appeared in The
Daily on Feb. 7, Mario Huerta claims to
speak for the gay and lesbian community
as he enumerates a list of goals "that
will ensure the liberation of all sexually
oppressed sectors."
Since I came to Stanford I have been
under the impression that the gay and
lesbian movement had the procurement
of basic human rights as its central goal.
However, Huerta's goals listed above
do not secure anyone's rights, and rav
age those of others.
If the "domestic partners" program is
indeed just a step to "bring (the homo
sexual community) closer to the
achievement of these aims," then the
misgivings that I and many others expe
rienced over "partners" cross the
boundary from mild homophobia to a
legitimate fear for the destruction of
our freely chosen lifestyle. Huerta's
statements are more Orwellian than
Orwell himself.
If you are gay or lesbian and Mr.
Huerta does not speak for you, I entreat
you to speak up now. Otherwise future

peaceful reconciliation will become
impossible.
