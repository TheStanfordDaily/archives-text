# Rabois' argument has very little credibility
## 
### 
In his Feb. 7 letter, first-year law stu
dent Keith Rabois generated a lot of text
that could easily turn up in a slow
episode of "IjA Law," demonstrating
that he has learned the difference
between "beyond a reasonable doubt"
and "clear and compelling evidence."
I can't deny the possibility of what he
says, and that's all he needs. It's unfor
tunate that his letter mirrored in so
many ways the 31 columns he mentions,
many with The Stanford Review. Lots of
strong, or at least legally correct argu
ments that are plausible, if perhaps in
contrast to majority of campus opinion.
Then, when his credibility seems
almost established, he offers a few unnec
essary attacks on differing ideologies that
may have the thrill of sound biting those
non-conservative menaces, but under
score a literary insecurity of letting the
arguments stand, strength against

strength, against opposing views. Mud
has to be slung against the conspiratorial
"multicultural community leaders."
Rabois derides the "labeling" tactic,
and derides the Grey Standard for chill
ing intellectual challenges and harassing
views such as his. Interesting coming
from a man who has editorialized in the
past with such crafted phrases as "the
loony left."
He later feels compelled to add, "I hate
Democrats, not homosexuals; they're the
ones that have hurt the country." How
this is relevant to explaining his seeming
ly adolescent behavior at Otero escapes
me. Shouldn't he have been screaming
"Goddamn liberal, hope your social pro
gram gets cut to buy a bomber?"
Rabois may have been congratulated
for his columns challenging "trendy
thinking" and regarded for his princi
pled and forthright manners. This
doesn't necessarily imply a worthwhile
message, just that someone will buy it.
It's difficult to give what Rabois wrote
much credence when the gut reaction is
that it's a legal argument, but that he
doesn't believe it himself. Perhaps that
subtle part of closing arguments is cov
ered in the next year of law school.
