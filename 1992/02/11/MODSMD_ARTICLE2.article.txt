# Beating the system
## Educator creates alternative programs in South Africa 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Education reformers every
where face challenges, but for a
black South African the obstacles
can seem insurmountable.
Nevertheless, education inno
vator Jabulani Mabaso has creat
ed a program that aims to work
outside the South African school
system to help black youths excel
within the system.
The thin, soft-spoken 23-year
old hardly seems like a force for
massive changes in South Africa.
But his Matric Student Movement
and Study Improvement Project

(MASMOVE) is making waves in
that country's educational system.
Mabaso, who spoke to about 10
students at the School of Education
and gave a presentation at Bechtel

International
Center yesterday,
founded MAS
MOVE in 1988.
The project
places black stu
dents who have
not had success

in school in self-help study groups
of six to 15. The students are
between the ages of 18 and 25.

Mabaso 'saw the
need for redirection'
of black students.

his country, speaks at Bechtel International Center at noon yesterday. Mabaso, dissatisfied with
his country's segregated black schools, created an alternate high school program that uses small
study-groups to help students achieve.
