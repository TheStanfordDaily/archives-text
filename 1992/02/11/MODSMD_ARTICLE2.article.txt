# Beating the system
## Educator creates alternative programs in South Africa 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Education reformers every
where face challenges, but for a
black South African the obstacles
can seem insurmountable.
Nevertheless, education inno
vator Jabulani Mabaso has creat
ed a program that aims to work
outside the South African school
system to help black youths excel
within the system.
The thin, soft-spoken 23-year
old hardly seems like a force for
massive changes in South Africa.
But his Matric Student Movement
and Study Improvement Project

(MASMOVE) is making waves in
that country's educational system.
Mabaso, who spoke to about 10
students at the School of Education
and gave a presentation at Bechtel

International
Center yesterday,
founded MAS
MOVE in 1988.
The project
places black stu
dents who have
not had success

in school in self-help study groups
of six to 15. The students are
between the ages of 18 and 25.

Mabaso 'saw the
need for redirection'
of black students.

Jabulani Mabaso, a South African who founded an innovative educational program for blacks in
his country, speaks at Bechtel International Center at noon yesterday. Mabaso, dissatisfied with
his country's segregated black schools, created an alternate high school program that uses small
study-groups to help students achieve.
Mabaso graduated from an all
black high school in Durban,
South Africa, in May 1987 and
was subsequently selected to be
an Ashoka fellow, an elected mem
ber of a worldwide public service
organization. However, more than
half of Mabaso's classmates failed
the matriculation exam, called
"the matric," which allows them
to attend universities.
Only one in every 20 black stu
dents in the segregated South
African educational system
makes it to the final year of high
school. Less than 40 percent of
those students pass the matric.
The South African govern
ment spends almost four times as
much money to educate white
students as it does for black stu
dents, according to Mabaso.
As a result, black schools are over
crowded and lacking in resources
and teachers. Many black secondary
schools were also boycotted and
closed down during the mid-'Bos
anti-apartheid movement.
Mabaso developed the MAS
MOVE project because he was
"concerned and saw the need" for
the "redirection" of black stu
dents to allow them to succeed in
a biased educational system.
The long-term mission of

MASMOVE is to "take students
out of the system to initiate a
unique program so that they can
start to change the existing sys
tem," Mabaso said.
With the help of volunteers and
tutors, who include teachers, ex
teachers and university students
— many of whom are MASMOVE
graduates — each autonomous
study group develops its own syl
labus and time schedule.
Groups are based on "subject
streams," which focus on one area
of study, such as humanities or sci
ences.
Mabaso said that after com
pleting MASMOVE, 87 percent of
students succeed on the matric.
The principle behind MAS
MOVE's success is "committing
students to learning by delegating
tasks to them and giving them
freedom of thinking," Mabaso said.
He said he draws his ideas from
his own practical experience.
Even with the changing political
structure in South Africa, Mabaso
said MASMOVE is needed because
the movement toward democracy is
a long-term process, and its effects
will not be seen in the educational
system for about 10 years.
Mabaso said his trip to the
United States has been very hec
tic, and he has not been able to
see very much of the country.
"I've basically just been talking,"
he said. "I haven't been able to
have some fun yet."
