## Midseason report: Cagers a pleasant surprise 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Halfway through the league schedule,
the men's basketball team is the surprise
of the Pacific 10 Conference.
Picked to finish eighth in the presea
son coaches' poll, Stanford has
entrenched itself in the upper division
with a 5-4 mark in Pac-10 play, 13-5 over
all. With a repeat of the first-half results,
Stanford can anticipate its second NCAA
tournament berth in 50 years.
"We're probably a little better than I
thought," admitted Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery after Saturday's convincing
86-73 trouncing of Arizona State. "We've
played some really good teams straight
up. I think the guys are enjoying them
selves and what they've accomplished."
The surprising Cardinal will visit
Notre Dame tonight at 5 p.m. in their

final non-conference game of the season.
An intersectional win over the Fighting
Irish, coupled with previous defeats of
Rice, Colorado and Virginia, would give
Stanford an impressive non-conference
record of 9-1.
"We've put ourselves in good shape. We
are where we want to be," said senior Adam
Keefe, who has averaged an All-American

25 points and 13 rebounds per game.
But even should Stanford lose to the
sporadic Fighting Irish, a fourth-place fin
ish in the Pac-10 should earn the Cardinal
an invitation to March Madness. Stanford
is alone in fourth after the first half of the
schedule, but will have a difficult time
moving past Arizona, USC and UCLA, all
ranked in the top 15 nationally.

"You have to be realistic to what is
going on in the conference," Montgomery
said. "What you're trying to do is win
every game, but if your goal is to make
the NCAA tournament, and third or
fourth can get you in, then that is where
you are shooting."
The 64-team NCAA tournament invit
ed four Pac-10 teams last year — UCLA,
Arizona, Arizona State and USC — while
Stanford (20-13, 8-10 in the Pac-10) tied
for fifth with four other teams.
Although Keefe and his Cardinal team
mates gained valuable experience last
year by winning the National Invitation
al Tournament, they aren't hoping to
repeat. Stanford will not be satisfied with
the consolation NIT, and is targeting the
NCAA tournament.
With four Pac-10 home games and five
road games, the schedule favors the Car
dinal. Road games at Arizona, UCLA and

USC will be painful, but Stanford doesn't
have to win those games to taste the
Tournament.
Three of the four teams closely chas
ing Stanford for fourth — Washington
State, Oregon State and Washington —
have to visit Maples Pavilion, where
Stanford is 68-16 the past five years. The
Cardinal will also need to beat either Cal
ifornia or Arizona State on the road. Of
course, winning the "winnable" games is
always more treacherous on the court
than it is on paper.
"The focus and the nervousness does
not come from preparing to play an Ari
zona, but from preparing to do what you
should do every game," Montgomery said.
"The competition comes from trying to go
out and do the best you can every game. If
you play the best you can and don't win,
there's nothingyou can do about it. I can't
feel like we've screwed up."
