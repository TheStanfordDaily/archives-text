Although the sun did not brighten the
Farm last weekend, it did shine on its gym
nasts competing in Colorado. Tim Ryan
and Jair Lynch emerged from two days of
grueling competition at the Winter Nation
als as strong contenders for the U.S.
Olympic team.
Ryan and Lynch placed sixth and
twelfth, respectively, in all-around compe
tition among the top 50 gymnasts in the
country, thus earning spots on the U.S.
National team. A third Stanford gymnast,
Jeff Bender, finished the tournament at
No. 19, missing the National team by only
one spot.
The Winter Nationals witnessed Ryan's
return to national prominence. As an 18-
year-old freshman, Ryan became the
youngest U.S. National all-around champi
on since Olympian Bart Connor did it at 17
in 1985.
Ryan subsequently injured his wrist and
spent 14 months recovering. Healthy once
again, the senior captured the rings compe
tition and took third in the parallel bars.
"Tim Ryan definitely proved to the peo
ple that he's back," said coach Sadao

Hamada.
Like his Cardinal teammate, Jair Lynch
showed that he belongs among the nation's
elite gymnasts. Lynch placed second on the
vault and ranked third on the pommel
horse and the horizontal bar.
A costly mistake on the floor exercise
hurt Lynch, lowering his ranking by sever
al spots. He lost points in the compulsory
rings competition, a routine in which
strength is all-important.
"Biologically, Jair will hit the peak of his
strength later," Hamada said. "But I can
see his [strength] improving rapidly now."
A sore ankle prevented Bender from
training adequately for the meet and ham
pered his performance in Colorado.
Nonetheless, the junior made a strong
showing, placing fourth in the pommel
horse competition.
The top 18 finishers became members of
the National team and automatically
advance to the U.S.A. Championships in
May that will determine the Olympic team.
Now that the Winter Nationals are over;
the Cardinal has turned ita attention
towards the Pacific 10 Championships.
"This phase of the season is team-orient
ed," Lynch said. "We want to win the Pac
10s and the NCAAs as a team."
