The Cardinal trounced all comers in at the Pacif
ic 10 Conference Championships, winning an
unheard of 17 of 18 events en route to their sixth
straight Pac-10 crown.
Jenny Thompson and Summer Sanders each set
three meet records, Lea Loveless set a Pac-10
record and another meet record, and Lori Heisick
won two events to pace Stanford. To call the Cardi
nal a team on fire is an understatement. The team
is exceeding even its tremendous standards for
excellence.
"We had the best Pac-10 meet that I've ever
seen," said Karen Kraemer, who has seen Stanford
take the conference title in each of her four years on
the farm. "We showed a lot of promise for NCAAs.
"In the past, we have gotten a little to confident
after Pac- 10s. This year, we had a good showing and
we boosted our confidence, but we're not taking
anything for granted."

Well, one thing is for sure, and that is that
nobody will be taking Stanford for granted. In win
ning the toughest conference crown in the country,
the No. 1 Cardinal trounced No. 5 UCLA by 499
points, 1562-1063. California and USC tied for
third with 922 points, followed by Arizona with 539,
Arizona State (525), Washington (497), Washington
State (413), and Oregon State (253).
The one-sidedness of Stanford's victory came
from the strength of almost across-the-board excep
tional individual performances.
"In general, people swam much better than they
expected to do," said Kraemer, who finished a close
second to UCLA's Natalie Norberg in the 500
freestyle.
In the 200-meter individual medley, Sanders
won with a meet record of one minute, 59.34 sec
onds. Even more astounding than her time was the
fact that the next five finishers in the meet were
Stanford swimmers as well. Sanders also won the
400 IM and the 200 butterfly.
Thompson demolished the field in each of her

three events, winning the 50, 100, and 200 free by
healthy margins over her nearest competitor.
Janel Jorgensen won the 100 butterfly, setting a
meet record of 53.36 seconds. Lori Heisick took first
place honors in the 100 and 200 breaststroke, set
ting a meet record in the latter.
Katherine Comanor won the 1650 free with a
time of 16:22.12. Lea Loveless set a Pac-10 record
in winning the 100 backstroke, and then went on to
claim victory in the 200 as well.
Meet records also fell in each of the five relay
events. In all, records fell in 14 of the 18 events,
with a Stanford swimmer winning each time.
Next up for the Cardinal is the Pac-10 Diving
Championships, which will be held from Feb. 28-
March 1 in Phoenix, Ariz.
The swimmers will next race at the Olympic tri
als in Indianapolis. Finally, the Longhorns get a
rematch with the Cardinal as the teams will com
pete with the rest of the best in the nation at the
NCAA Championships. The meet will be held on
March 19-21 in Austin, Tex.
