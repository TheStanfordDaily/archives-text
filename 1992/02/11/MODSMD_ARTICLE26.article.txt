# Netters face Tigers

Mother Nature may not have
success stopping the mailman
from his rounds but she will prob
ably keep the Stanford women's
tennis team from taking the
courts against the Pacific Tigers
today.
The match is slated for a 1:30
p.m. start in Stockton, but the
squads have already decided on
Thursday as the makeup date if
showers prevent this afternoon's
play.
If postponed, the contest will
likely be the Cardinal dual-match
debut of Kristine Kurth. The
sophomore transfer from William
and Mary has been nursing a sore
back since mid-January.
"She's healthy now," said
Stanford coach Frank Brennan.
"She's been hitting for a few days
and looks pretty good." However,
the recent rain has pushed back
the timetable for Kurth's return.
She has not yet practiced her
serve and is unlikely to play if the
match is held today.
Whether the Stanford-Pacific
tilt happens this afternoon or
Thursday, Brennan plans to get
Kurth in dual-match action by
Saturday, when Stanford hosts
Pepperdine.
He said she will probably be slot

bles with Amy Chiminello. "I've
been very happy with Mario [Car
ruth] and Amy [at No. 3 doubles]
but Kristine is just too good of a
player not to have in the lineup."
It's too early to tell whether
the Kurth-Chiminello tandem
will hold for the rest of the sea
son, Brennan said. "It depends on
how they play and how [the com
petition] plays against them."
Brennan views the Pacific con
test as another step in the Cardi
nal's trek towards the NCAA
Championships in March. "UOP
is good .... Pepperdine and
Berkeley (Sunday) should be real
ly good tests versus top 10
teams," he said.
