The Stanford men's tennis team is sched
uled to play at home today at 1:30 p.m. against
San Jose State, Mother Nature permitting.
"San Jose State has quite a few players back
from last year," said Stanford head coach Dick
Gould. "But they were not that strong last
year."
The Spartans defeated a respectable Hawaii
team earlier this year, and they lost to San
Diego in several close matches.
Flanagan will not play in order to rest his
sore wrist.
The match will be a good preparation for
this Friday's important Valentine's Day con
test against the eighth-ranked Miami Hurri
canes. The team is also using the contest as a
preparation for the National Team Indoor
Championships (the winter equivalent to the
NCAA Tournament) in Louisville, KY, a week
from tomorrow, said Gould.
