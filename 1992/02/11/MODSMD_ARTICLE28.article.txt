# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
It was a record-setting weekend for Stan
ford athletics. The Farm always churns out
world-class competitors in all kinds of sports,
and now two more record books have to be
re-written. And both marks were set against
hated Southern California rival UCLA.
Maybe the Bruins just bring out the best in
Cardinal athletes. That is certainly what hap
pened this weekend as Jene Elzie of the
women's gymnastics team and Dave Goss of

the men's volleyball team reached new heights
and earned Athlete of the Week honors.
Freshman Jene Elzie is getting into the
habit of setting new records. Two weekends
ago at the women's gymnastics meet against
Arizona Elzie broke Stanford's individual
all-around record of 38.40 by 15 hundredths
of a point â€” a pretty sizeable margin in col
legiate gymnastics. After her feat she said
that records were nice, but she still had a lot
of room to improve.
Elzie put her money where her mouth
was the next weekend against perennial pow
erhouse UCLA. Scoring individual-event
school records of 9.70 in the balance beam
and uneven parallel bars, she shattered her
individual all-around total of last week, tally
ing a phenomenal 38.70.
"It felt great," Elzie said. "I was kind of
nervous, but I hit everything. It was exciting."
And it will only get more exciting for the
freshman as she continues to improve during
her stay on the Farm.
O
Senior outside hitter Dave Goss not only
shattered a school kill record last weekend,
but also set a new NCAA single-match mark
Goss pounded down an unbelievable 55 balls
last Friday in a win against UCLA. His
record-smashing effort, which included a
whopping .441 hitting percentage, led the
No. 4 Cardinal to a thrilling five-game victo
ry against the No. 2 Bruins.
The previous record was 53 kills in one
match by Brent Hilliard of Long Beach
State.

Goss didn't let up the next night against
tne No. 7 Trojans. He contributed an impres
sive 35 kills on .300 hitting to help bring Stan
ford back from a two-game deficit and give the
Cardinal a Southern California sweep.
Goss was quick to attribute his success to
his teammates.
"The team is playing so well together,"
Goss said. "Last year was a good rebuilding
year .... This year everything is working so
