# Sailors turn in mixed performance

### Laurie Wackler Staff writer 
Although the Stanford sailing team sent
boats to UC-Santa Barbara and UC-Santa
Cruz for scheduled races on Saturday and
Sunday, adverse weather conditions allowed
for only one day of competition at both sites.
Despite the change in plans, Stanford man
aged to capture the title at the opening regat
ta of the North Series, hosted by Santa Cruz
Saturday. Eight regattas comprise the North
Series, which serves as a regional qualifier for
the Pacific Championship.
The Cardinal's overall results in the regat
ta reflected a stellar performance: in 10 races,
Stanford claimed seven firsts and three sec
onds, for a winning score of 13. Cal placed sec
ond with 34 points, followed by Cal Poly Tech,
with 39.
"To my recollection, it's the most dominat
ing North Series we've had in years, and the
best performance in any regatta this year,"

said Stanford coach Blake Middleton of the
victory. "That was a nice way to get the Series
started."
Stanford brought four boats to the fleet of
18, with each boat represented by a pair of
sailors in A division and B division. The Car
dinal cleaned up, with boats claiming three of
the top five positions.
The first varsity boat for the Cardinal
snagged the number one spot in the fleet, repre
sented by skipper Charles Meade and crew
Katherine Chen in the A division, and Matt
Sanford and Deborah Claymon in the B division.
Stanford's second varsity boat cruised to a
fourth place finish. An especially notable per
formance came from crew Kathy Akers, who
had just joined the team the previous week.
Akers sailed in the B division, with skipper
Haley King. A division sailors on the second
boat were skipper John Emory and crew Anne
Lutkemeier.
Middleton was pleasantly surprised by
Akers. "I was really impressed with the way

they sailed. Kathy had never been in a race
before, and she had a great performance,"
Middleton said.
Meanwhile, the South Series — like its
northern counterpart — was also limited to a
one-day regatta. "It's pretty unusual for an
event to get blown out, but both of these sites
are on the open ocean, Middleton explained.
"You take a few more risks on the ocean — it's
a step up from the power of the bay."
In light winds and a scant four races, Stan
ford's sole boat at Santa Barbara struggled to
a fourth place finish among nine schools. "It
wasn't terrible, but it was very disappoint
ing," said Middleton of the outcome. "It's def
initely not the performance we're looking for."
UC-Irvine sailed effortlessly past the competi
tion for a decisive first place finish.
The weekend's mixed results indicated one
thing to Middleton: "Clearly, the south has
more depth of talent this year. We've got to
raise ourselves up a step in order to get a shot
at Nationals."
