# Students may need approval to drop classes during finals

Students dropping a class during finals
week will need the professor's approval, if
a proposal going before the Faculty Senate
next week passes.
Under the proposal, students will have
to get permission after 5 p.m. on the last
day of classes during Dead Week rather
than dropping the course through the Reg
istrar's Office.
The discussion of the deadline change,
proposed by the senate's Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement to
make the use of the Registrar's new, com
puterized system easier, has reopened the
debate on the University's grading system
as a whole.
Current University policy allows stu
dents to drop courses up to 24 hours before
the final exam.

"The 5 p.m. deadline is solely for admin
istrative ease," said sophomore Carleen
Chou, a member of the committee. "Now it
seems it will almost be easier to drop a
class (during Finals Week) because you
don't have to go through all the paper
work. You just have to go to the professor
and ask for it."
According to Edward Haertel, an associ
ate professor of education and co-chair of
the committee, "The old system seemed
kind of silly, with students trying to rush
into the Registrar and request drops 24
hours before the final."
The automated student access system,
currently being piloted by approximately
500 students, is expected to be available to
all students beginning spring quarter.
The committee's recommendation is on
the agenda for the Feb. 20 Faculty Senate
