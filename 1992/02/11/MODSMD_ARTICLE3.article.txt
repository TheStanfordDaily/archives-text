# Students may need approval to drop classes during finals
## 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
Students dropping a class during finals
week will need the professor's approval, if
a proposal going before the Faculty Senate
next week passes.
Under the proposal, students will have
to get permission after 5 p.m. on the last
day of classes during Dead Week rather
than dropping the course through the Reg
istrar's Office.
The discussion of the deadline change,
proposed by the senate's Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement to
make the use of the Registrar's new, com
puterized system easier, has reopened the
debate on the University's grading system
as a whole.
Current University policy allows stu
dents to drop courses up to 24 hours before
the final exam.

"The 5 p.m. deadline is solely for admin
istrative ease," said sophomore Carleen
Chou, a member of the committee. "Now it
seems it will almost be easier to drop a
class (during Finals Week) because you
don't have to go through all the paper
work. You just have to go to the professor
and ask for it."
According to Edward Haertel, an associ
ate professor of education and co-chair of
the committee, "The old system seemed
kind of silly, with students trying to rush
into the Registrar and request drops 24
hours before the final."
The automated student access system,
currently being piloted by approximately
500 students, is expected to be available to
all students beginning spring quarter.
The committee's recommendation is on
the agenda for the Feb. 20 Faculty Senate
meeting.
System "hypocritical"
Chou noted that the proposal
almost passed the committee
without the provision that stu
dents be able to request drops
after the Dead Week deadline.
"Some faculty think the late
drop deadline is a cop-out," she
said.
Chemistry Prof. James Coll
man is one of the system's critics.
"The system, as it is now, is very

hypocritical," he said. "It's silly."
Students and professors have
long engaged in a process not con
doned by the University — "nego
tiated" No Credit, when students
ask their instructor to drop them
from the class if they receive a low
grade.
Despite being continually
admonished not to grant such
"negotiated" No Credits, some
professors continue to do so.
"As long as the system exists
the way it is, I'll continue to offer
the (negotiated) NC option
instead of a D," said Collman.
"Students try to avoid the D as
much as possible," he noted.
"This . . . wastes resources of the

University, wastes students time
and teaches a bad lesson. Other
colleges don't do this."
"The system creates a lack of
commitment on the part of stu
dents," said Civil Engineering
Prof. Ray Levitt. "It creates large
blocks of uncommitted students
not doing themselves, their class
mates or their instructors a favor.
In the real world you have to
make commitments."
Collman, Levitt and others
have argued for reform in the
grading process. "In so long as we
have a no-failing system, it might
be better to install a new mark, a
W for withdraw," said Collman.
This would indicate that a stu

dent participated in a class but
withdrew after some set deadline,
for academic reasons or personal
reasons such as illness. Under the
current system, a dropped class is
not noted on the student's tran
script.
Levitt advocates implementing
a system which would include W's
and F's. A student would receive a
W for withdrawing after a certain
date and an F for failing a course.
"An F could be replaced by retak
ing the course and earning a high
er grade," Levitt said.
But Levitt said the faculty is
very split on the issue, and the
committee has no plans to consid
er it this year.
