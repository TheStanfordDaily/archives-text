# The 						sky's the limit
## ASSU to discuss flier quotas ... again 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
There appears to be no limit on the
ASSU Senate's debate over flier limits,
which will continue tonight for the third
consecutive meeting.
The senate will also consider a bill pro
posed by law student Casey Cooper con
demning "hate speech" in response to the
Jan. 19 incident in Otero.
Undergraduate senators Jason Snyder
and Shaista Malik said they each plan to
move at tonight's senate meeting to rein
state limits on the number of fliers candi
dates for ASSU offices can distribute. The
limits were removed by a bill passed at the
last meeting.
The discussion on fliers was sparked by
a sweeping elections reform bill proposed

four weeks ago that eliminated both spend
ing and flier limits.
The bill passed last meeting was a com
promise proposal, introduced well after
midnight, that increased spending limits
for candidates but disposed of flier limits.
Snyder, a sophomore, said he will pro
pose increasing the number of fliers that
can now be distributed, but said he
believes some limitation is still necessary.
Malik, however, said she does not want
to see an increase.
"I favor the old flier limits," said Malik,
a senior. "They were done in reaction to
disapproval from students" about too much
flier use, she said, adding she felt environ
mental concerns motivated the limits.
The senate will also consider a bill,
authored by graduate senator
Casey Cooper, condemning "hate
speech." The bill addresses the
incident last month when first
year law student Keith Rabois
shouted homophobic slurs while
walking through the Otero lounge.
The bill says that "the Stan
ford community should send an
unequivocal message that it will
not tolerate such hateful
attacks," and "denounces in the
strongest possible way . . . expres
sions of'hate speech.' "

Cooper, a second-year law stu
dent, said he wrote the bill
because of the outcry in the Stan
ford Law School against the inci
dent.
Also scheduled for tonight's
meeting is an appearance by Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy, who will have a ques
tion-and-answer session with the
senators.
According to Council of Presi
dents member John Overdeck,
likely topics for discussion include
the perquisites received by Book
store directors and an increase in
tuition charges, which the Board
of Trustees is scheduled to con
sider tomorrow.
