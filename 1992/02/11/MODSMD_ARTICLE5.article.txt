# Law School searches for the 'appropriate' response to Rabois
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Law School community mem
bers, responding to anti-gay
remarks made by first-year law
student Keith Rabois, have cho
sen a number of different outlets
for their anger — including send
ing a letter detailing Rabois' com
ments to a law firm he had hoped
to work for.
Meanwhile, the reactions them
selves have become a topic of dis
cussion at the Law School this
week, with some law students
complaining the response has been
marked by personal attacks on
Rabois rather than an intelligent
discussion of the issues raised by
his behavior.
More than 100 people and repre
sentatives of at least three local
newspapers showed up to view an
address on "Free Speech, Hate
Speech," advertised through fliers
and scheduled to be delivered by
Rabois yesterday afternoon. Rabois,
however, failed to show.
Several students sent reports
of the Jan. 19 incident in Otero to
one of the law firms Rabois hopes
to work for; more than 400 people
signed a petition disassociating
the Law School from the anti-gay
remarks; and a poster with
Rabois' face and a Daily article
has attracted myriad comments
and signatures, ranging from
"Keith, you witch, welcome to
Salem" to "Only a truly small
mind would express itself in this
manner you have chosen."
Rebecca Laibson, a first-year
law student, said "I think his com
ments were inappropriate, but the
reactions were also inappropriate.
"I had hoped a response to an
incident like this would be an
opportunity to discuss homophobia
and other issues in an open forum,
rather than a personal attack on
one individual," Laibson said.

But others were
less critical of the
community re
sponse. "I think
the initial reac
tions showed hurt
and anger, and
were more ex
treme," said Suz-

Anne Woods, a
second-year law

student. "But overall I think the
response has been fairly measured."
Several students last week sent
a letter enclosing Daily reports of
the incident to a Newport Beach
law firm at which Rabois is a final
ist for a position, according to sec
ond-year law student Jamie Ker
shaw.
The students, in what Kershaw
described as an act of "retributive
justice or vengeance or whatever,"
said in the letter that they wanted
to bring the issue to the firm's
attention, Kershaw said. The stu
dents are planning to send similar
letters to every law firm in Cali
fornia, he added.
Kershaw emphasized that the
students who sent the letter were
straight.
Whether the incident would
affect Rabois' career aspirations
was a point of contention among
law students. Some, like law stu
dent Allison Tucher, who hung
the posters in the student lounge,
said the incident would "certainly
hurt his chances if law firms
heard about it."
Others, however, were less sure.
"In certain firms it would hurt, but
in other firms it would probably
help," said one law student who
asked not to be identified.
Gays encouraged
More than 400 Law School stu
dents, deans, staff and faculty
members signed a petition disso

dating the Law School from the
anti-gay remarks. The document
appears as a half-page ad in today's
Daily.
Law School Dean Paul Brest
said the ad "seem(ed) just the
appropriate way for the institution
to respond — not with official sanc
tions nor with vituperations, but
just by putting itself on record" as
objecting to the behavior.
The strength of the response
— if not the specific courses it has

followed — has been a source of
encouragement and support for
several gay, lesbian and bisexual
students in the Law School.
"It's been nice not to have to
initiate a lot of the response," said
Tom Nolan, a second-year law
student who is a co-chair of the
Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual Law Stu
dents Association
"When something like this
happens, it's hard not to respond
emotionally. . . . It's easy to feel
isolated," Nolan said, adding that
he found the involvement of
straight students in the response
particularly encouraging.
Along with galvanizing com

munity support, last week's inci
dent at Otero has also provoked
wide-ranging campus discussion.
First Amendment law, the Uni
versity's Fundamental Standard
and appropriate community
responses to hateful speech have
all cropped up in both classroom
and informal student discussions.
Brest said the focus of commu
nity discussion has been "less
about constitutional issues and
more about appropriate non-legal
responses."
Woods added, "I think there's a
remarkable consensus that he
had the right to make the com
ments — no one has denied that.

But we are exercising our free
speech rights to tell him that we
— as a community — don't share
his views."
Another student, who did not
wish to be identified, said the
question of whether such inci
dents should be disclosed to the
community is more difficult.
The student said "this was a
fairly easy case" to decide because
of the public nature of the event.
But he added, "Where do you
draw the line? The answer's not
so clear" in such cases as plagia
rism and cheating.
Rabois could not be reached for
comment yesterday.

speech rights to tell him that we
— as a community — don't share
his views."
Another student, who did not
wish to be identified, said the
question of whether such inci
dents should be disclosed to the
community is more difficult.
The student said "this was a
fairly easy case" to decide because
of the public nature of the event.
But he added, "Where do you
draw the line? The answer's not
so clear" in such cases as plagia
rism and cheating.
Rabois could not be reached for
comment yesterday.
Law School community mem
bers, responding to anti-gay
remarks made by first-year law
student Keith Rabois, have cho
sen a number of different outlets
for their anger — including send
ing a letter detailing Rabois' com
ments to a law firm he had hoped
to work for.
Meanwhile, the reactions them
selves have become a topic of dis
cussion at the Law School this
week, with some law students
complaining the response has been
marked by personal attacks on
Rabois rather than an intelligent
discussion of the issues raised by
his behavior.
More than 100 people and repre
sentatives of at least three local
newspapers showed up to view an
address on "Free Speech, Hate
Speech," advertised through fliers
and scheduled to be delivered by
Rabois yesterday afternoon. Rabois,
however, failed to show.
Several students sent reports
of the Jan. 19 incident in Otero to
one of the law firms Rabois hopes
to work for; more than 400 people
signed a petition disassociating
the Law School from the anti-gay
remarks; and a poster with
Rabois' face and a Daily article
has attracted myriad comments
and signatures, ranging from
"Keith, you witch, welcome to
Salem" to "Only a truly small
mind would express itself in this
manner you have chosen."
Rebecca Laibson, a first-year
law student, said "I think his com
ments were inappropriate, but the
reactions were also inappropriate.
"I had hoped a response to an
incident like this would be an
opportunity to discuss homophobia
and other issues in an open forum,
rather than a personal attack on
one individual," Laibson said.

But others were
less critical of the
community re
sponse. "I think
the initial reac
tions showed hurt
and anger, and
were more ex
treme," said Suz-

Anne Woods, a
second-year law

student. "But overall I think the
response has been fairly measured."
Several students last week sent
a letter enclosing Daily reports of
the incident to a Newport Beach
law firm at which Rabois is a final
ist for a position, according to sec
ond-year law student Jamie Ker
shaw.
The students, in what Kershaw
described as an act of "retributive
justice or vengeance or whatever,"
said in the letter that they wanted
to bring the issue to the firm's
attention, Kershaw said. The stu
dents are planning to send similar
letters to every law firm in Cali
fornia, he added.
Kershaw emphasized that the
students who sent the letter were
straight.
Whether the incident would
affect Rabois' career aspirations
was a point of contention among
law students. Some, like law stu
dent Allison Tucher, who hung
the posters in the student lounge,
said the incident would "certainly
hurt his chances if law firms
heard about it."
Others, however, were less sure.
"In certain firms it would hurt, but
in other firms it would probably
help," said one law student who
asked not to be identified.
Gays encouraged
More than 400 Law School stu
dents, deans, staff and faculty
members signed a petition disso

dating the Law School from the
anti-gay remarks. The document
appears as a half-page ad in today's
Daily.
Law School Dean Paul Brest
said the ad "seem(ed) just the
appropriate way for the institution
to respond — not with official sanc
tions nor with vituperations, but
just by putting itself on record" as
objecting to the behavior.
The strength of the response
— if not the specific courses it has

followed — has been a source of
encouragement and support for
several gay, lesbian and bisexual
students in the Law School.
"It's been nice not to have to
initiate a lot of the response," said
Tom Nolan, a second-year law
student who is a co-chair of the
Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual Law Stu
dents Association
"When something like this
happens, it's hard not to respond
emotionally. . . . It's easy to feel
isolated," Nolan said, adding that
he found the involvement of
straight students in the response
particularly encouraging.
Along with galvanizing com

munity support, last week's inci
dent at Otero has also provoked
wide-ranging campus discussion.
First Amendment law, the Uni
versity's Fundamental Standard
and appropriate community
responses to hateful speech have
all cropped up in both classroom
and informal student discussions.
Brest said the focus of commu
nity discussion has been "less
about constitutional issues and
more about appropriate non-legal
responses."
Woods added, "I think there's a
remarkable consensus that he
had the right to make the com
ments — no one has denied that.

But we are exercising our free
speech rights to tell him that we
— as a community — don't share
his views."
