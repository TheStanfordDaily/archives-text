Still trying to save a women's self
defense class from elimination, approxi
mately 20 people marched into Stanford
Board of Trustees' meeting rooms yes
terday.
The protesters, wearing yellow rib
bons, tried to address the three board
committees, which were meeting at sep
arate locations in the Littlefield Center.
They succeeded in talking with one
group of trustees, submitted a state
ment to another and were prevented
from seeing a third.

Innovative Academic Courses, which
includes the popular course called
"Issues in Self-Defense for Women," has
been identified for elimination by the
School of Humanities and Sciences as
part of its $5 million budget-reduction
proposal. Protesters held a similar
demonstration Friday, marching into
University President Donald Kennedy's
reception room.
Yesterday's group, mostly women,
arrived at Littlefield shortly before noon
to wait for the board members to leave
for lunch.
But the group was forced to alter its
plans when a caterer delivered lunch to

the trustees instead.
The protesters decided to confront
each of three board committees, which
were meeting separately, in order to
make a more forceful impression.
"We'll do whatever it takes to get
heard," said senior Erica Webber.
According to senior Jen Corbin, the
group arrived at the first committee
meeting, apologized for disrupting the
trustees' lunch, then expressed their
concerns over the elimination of LAC.
The board members gave them about
two minutes to talk, Corbin said, and

After forcing their way into a committee meeting of the Board of Trustees yesterday in Littlefield Management Center, stu
dents present reasons why women's self-defense classes should be preserved. The popular classes fall under the Inno
vative Academic Courses program, which is slated for elimination next year due to budget cuts.
