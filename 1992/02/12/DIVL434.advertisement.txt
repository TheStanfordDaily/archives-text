The Chemistry Department will award several
undergraduate research fellowships for the summer
quarter. Interested students are encouraged to contact
individual faculty members for information on how to
apply. A brochure describing the research interests of the
faculty and a brief description of the program are
available in the Chemistry Department Office (Mudd
121). A short proposal, an unofficial transcript and a
letter from a sponsoring faculty member should be
submitted to Prof. Waymouth by March 2. Individuals
from underrepresented minorities are especially
encouraged to apply.
