### Steve McCarroll Editorial staff 
Gerald Lieberman, a veteran
faculty leader and professor of
statistics and operations research,
was named interim provost by
University President Donald
Kennedy at Monday's Board of
Trustees meeting.
Lieberman, a former acting
provost and Faculty Senate
chair who helped oversee the
University's Centennial cam
paign, will take office April 16.
He will step down several
months into the tenure of Stan
ford's next president. Lieberman
said he expects to serve any
where from six to 18 months.
"Everyone on the faculty has
high respect for him, and he will
be a popular choice," Kennedy
said last night.
Lieberman said his highest
priority as interim provost will
be to maintain Stanford's aca
demic excellence in the face of
its budget crisis. "We have to
balance budget objectives with
the quality of the academic pro
gram," he said.

Lieberman, 66, said he will
begin work immediately, meet
ing with the deans and vice
presidents to go over the admin
istrative and budget issues he
will grapple with in the coming
months.
Lieberman is also expected to
guide the transition to a new
administration. Kennedy told
the trustees that "Stanford's
great need in this period is to
complete and capture the bud
get reductions, but, more impor
tant, to proceed to the next
phase of examining our academ
ic organizations and restructur
ing ourselves.
"Jerry is in an ideal position
to start on that process so it will
be ready for our successors to
take over," he said.
Several professors said
Lieberman's selection will also
strengthen faculty trust in the
administration. A Stanford fac
ulty member since 1952, Lieber
man has previously been elected
by the Academic Council to
chair the University Advisory
Board apd the Faculty Senate.
"I view [faculty confidence]

as a serious issue," Lieberman
said. "I will do everything I can
to reassure the faculty that we
will continue our excellence."
Lieberman's ability to inspire
faculty support was the main
reason he was chosen in 1986 to
direct Stanford's Centennial cel
ebration, said Centennial Direc
tor Stephen Peeps. "He was the
only person we ever considered
for that role â€” a person that the
academic community would
have utter faith in,"he said.
