Dow must regain trust, analyst says
DETROIT (AP) — The outcome of Dow Corning Corp.'s debacle
with its silicone gel breast implants depends on whether it can regain
the trust of women who have the implants, an analyst said Tuesday.
At stake for Midland-based Dow Corning is its ability to remain
viable whether or not it ever makes another breast implant.
Company documents released Monday showed it has known
for two decades about potential health problems from the leaking
and rupture of its implants.
The company voluntarily pulled the implants from the market
last month after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a
voluntary moratorium. Doctors say the implants can cause a
range of medical problems, including cancer, if they rupture.
An estimated 1 million U.S. women have breast implants, most
ly silicone gel implants, and twice as many have them worldwide.
Dow Corning is the world's leading maker of silicone gel implants.
Some lawyers have estimated Dow Coming's potential liability
in the breast implant case at $2 billion.
But more dangerous than any legal liability is the damage that
could result from a frightened public left to wonder whether a
product will cause them harm, said Gerald C. Meyers, a business
consultant who wrote "When it Hits the Fan," a guide to manag
ing corporate crises.
