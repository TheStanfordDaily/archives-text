# Author explores politics of black literature
## 
### Cheo H. Coker Staff writer 
For John Edgar Wideman,
there is no simplistic way to sum
marize the black experience in
America.
"I have the kind of mind, the
kind of work and the kind of
habits that lead me to write
things that are complex, that
don't lend themselves to one read
ing," the author and professor
told a group of students in Uja
maa lounge yesterday. "That
already makes me a kind of
dinosaur."
The recent Jean and Bill Lane
lecturer for Stanford's Creative
Writing Program wouldn't have it
any other way.
Wideman, the author of six
books, including "Philadelphia
Fire" and "Brothers and Keep
ers," read from his works and
fielded questions at Kresge
Auditorium Monday night. He
also read a selection from his
soon-to-be-released book of
short stories, "All Stories Are
True."
Although he cited "the work
itself' as his inspiration, Wide
man emphasized the political ten
dency inherent in all works writ
ten by African-Americans.
"Any piece of writing has poli
tics involved with it. . . . Some
idea about power and power shar
ing, explicit but also implicit," he
said.
His writings have been viewed
as apolitical, in his opinion, due to
America's racial climate. "That

distinction (between radical and
mainstream work) means that
some ideologies are not accept
able, and others are more accept
able," he said.
Although Wideman left his
inner-city home to become a
Rhodes scholar, professor and
novelist, he said his work has kept

him in touch with his roots.
"In order to do some of the
things I wanted to do, I had to
give up a lot, " he said. "Writing
for me has always been a way of
trying to make sure I didn't give
up everything in order to get
something very superficial."
He said writers of any race can

bridge the gap between the inner
cities and the "ivory tower" of
education through their work.
"You have to try to understand
who you are ... and then speak
[the truth] as clearly and consis
tently as you can," he said. "If it's
a voice that's needed or attractive,
then other people will hear it."
