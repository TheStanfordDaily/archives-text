Scapegoating not a
constructive way to
respond to criticisms

OVER THE LAST few weeks,
the media has reported dis
paraging comments made
by Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa regarding the quality of
American labor.
The Japanese leader was report
ed to have claimed that U.S. work
ers have only a three-day week;
they don't work Fridays because
they are too preoccupied with the
weekend; and are unable to func
tion on Mondays because they are
too busy recovering from the
weekend.
The reaction in this country to
these remarks has, unfortunately,
not been objective. The latent hostil
ity toward the Japanese has been
intensified. Commentators have also
indulged in pointing the accusatory
finger at the President, Congress,
the educational system, minority
workers, yuppies who do not buy
American goods â€” the list is endless.
There has to be a more con
structive way of responding to
minor insults and injuries.
In times past, the ritual of
scapegoating was practiced vigor
ously; the sins of an entire commu
nity would be expiated by transfer
ing them symbolically onto a goat
and then expelling the unfortu
nate animal.
Centuries later, the comments
made by many of our leaders sound
no different from this ancient ritu
al. For Americans today, the goat is
reality: rather than attempting to
find creative solutions to problems,
people in this country delegate the
blame before all else.
There is, of course, more to the
present battle of words than mere
scapegoating. Japan's current
advantage stems from a number of
real cultural differences. It is a
more homogeneous, rigidly class
based, paternalistic society whose

government supports its corpora
tions, and whose corporations sup
port its workers. Its culture and
government are geared toward
efficient production.
In this country, locally con
trolled schools will not bear a
national curriculum. Our diverse
population will not tolerate ver
sions of assimilation imposed by
those in power. Our workers will
not sacrifice the American dream
for secure membership in a class.
The U.S. economy could never
resemble Japan's centrally con
trolled structure: liberals see
avenues for exploitation in Jap
anese-style cooperation between
government and private corpora
tions, while conservatives will not
tolerate the wealth of support ser
vices for the average worker.
However, it would be a fatal mis
take to model ourselves on Japan.
Diversity makes us different from
Japan and we should be proud of
that difference.
Constructive competition between
different groups is the source of
American innovation and ambition.
Scapegoating in response to affronts
to our national ego, however, only
widens the rift between groups.
How a team responds to criti
cism from another team deter
mines whether it has the stuff of
champions. Some teams crack,
responding to the comments by
criticizing each other. Some teams
respond by hating the other team,
covering up their faults and losing
their focus.
Champions, however, take the
criticism in stride, come together
as a team, work to correct the mis
takes and then prove, through
action, that they can succeed.
Competition is healthy on the
national playing field. It brings out
strength, but the United States
must not let this competition
become conflict. On the internation
al playing field, we are all players on
vthe same team, regardless of politi
cal affiliation, gender, ethnic her
itage or sexual orientation.
Stop assigning blame; start
accepting responsibility.
