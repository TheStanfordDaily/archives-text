# Cory Booker
## This one ain't a sermon 
### 
I WAS BORN a poor black child. . .
with no rhythm. I wasn't poor in any
financial sense — my deprivation lay
in culture. I grew up as the only black in
an all white affluent suburb in New Jer
sey.
As a kid, I didn't want to be differ
ent. I didn't want to be black. The
images of blackness I saw were too per
suasive: J.J on the TV show "Good
Times," the guy with the big afro from
the movie "Car Wash," the criminal on
the six o'clock news and the beggar I
would see on the streets of New York
when our classes took field trips for
"cultural education."
What about the "positive" blacks I
learned about in school? Well, there were
one or two, but to me they were ancient
anomalies.
In high school my denial of race mel
lowed. I came to grips with the fact that
I was black, but now I was black and
different. My friends reinforced this
belief with such remarks as "Cory,
you're not like other black people." I
was proud.
Then came Stanford. I remember
being amazed at all the black people and
as I fell into my comfortable community
of white friends, I remember discussing
the black community. "Why are they so
separatist and militant? Don't they know
more change is made with love than with
anger?" We believed I was testimony to

the positive effects of mixing.
Many black people on campus didn't
see me as such a bastion of racial under
standing, and a host of painful experi
ences and confrontations forced me, by
the end of my freshman year, to face the
black community and ask, "What's
wrong with me?"
This question was coupled with a great
amount of effort. I voraciously read
everything I could about the black experi
ence, I sought out black peers as friends
and, admittedly, as pedagogical units. I
actively participated in black cultural and
political events.
In short, this effort was rewarded. I
gained a new consciousness. I discovered
the extreme self-hate I had for every
thing, from my physical features to a mis
informed hatred of my history.
From Stanford's black community I
was imbued with self-esteem and self
concept, without which I would be lost in
mediocrity. But most importantly I found
a home, in the truest sense of the word, a
place where I can go and feel an
unabashed sense of love, strength and
community.
Now, when reflecting upon my experi
ence I realize that it is a black thing. . .
and you must understand. Just as I pos
sess an understanding of what it is to be
white, I believe whites can understand
what it is to be black. No, they can never
know what it is to be black, but they can

'Many clamor

other for
the gaps in
perception
between their
groups/

begin to understand.
But instead, many blacks and whites
on campus clamor to blame each other
for the gaps in perception between their
groups, when in reality blame must lie
among us all.
For five years I have proudly listened
to the sermon of Multiculturalism ring
ing resoundingly throughout the cam
pus. Yet, more and more, it falls upon
covered ears. I fear that people are tired
of sermons.
This is why I must fervently assert
that the gospel of racial understanding
cannot be preached, it must be passed
from heart to heart. When it comes to
something as intimate and unique as
one's ethnic identity, personal discourse
is a requisite for understanding. Is that
not what Angelou, Ellison, Malcolm X
and others do in their books?
I hope my self-disclosure will help
some to understand one person's need for
a strong black community, and I hope it
will prompt others, whether Asian,
white, or Alaskan native, to open their
hearts and further understanding.
