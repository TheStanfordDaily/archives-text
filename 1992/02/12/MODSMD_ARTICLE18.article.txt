All women deserve a chance to take self-defense class

Unsure of whether it was
the right thing to do, I decided not
to "storm" Donald Kennedy's
office on Friday with the supporters of the
SWOPSI self-defense-for-women classes.
Although I'm not sure of the efficacy
of the directly confrontational tactics at
this stage of the situation, it was with
deep regret and rage that I read of the
proposed elimination of the SWOPSI
program which includes the self-defense
class.
That one class meant more to me
than any mere "extra-curricular," more
than any distribution requirement I ever
took and more than all three quarters of
Western Culture combined.
I had wanted to take the class for a
long time, but it was only after being in
France for a quarter that I realized how

much I needed it. The fear, of course,
had always been there, but somehow I
thought that if I was as inconspicuous as
possible I could avoid an actual attack —
that as long as I knew where I was and
blended into the background sufficiently
I would be safe.
In Tours, however, as a foreigner, I
felt conspicuous everywhere I went. I
knew the language well enough, but I
wasn't French, and it was obvious, to me
and everyone around me.
My French family only lived about a five
to 10 minute walk from the Stanford villa,
but every time I had to make the journey
alone, late at night, I was petrified.
Even though the likelihood of any
thing happening was very small, I felt
incredibly exposed and vulnerable. I had
no idea of what to do in any sort of

uncomfortable situation. I was helpless,
and I didn't like it.
When I returned to Stanford this past
autumn quarter, I was lucky enough to
get a place in one of the self-defense
classes. More than 30 women were
turned away for lack of space.
I cannot express in words the empow
erment I experienced as a result of
attending this class. Rape, I learned, was
not an inevitability. It was not a natural
part of society. I had more options than
simply containing myself in a corner and
hoping that somehow it wouldn't hap
pen to me.
I learned that I had a voice, and I
could yell; that I was strong, that I could
fight and break a man's nose or shatter
his kneecaps if it ever became necessary;
that I had a right to assert my needs and

defend my space when the circum
stances warranted.
I learned not only how to defend
myself, but that I, as a woman, have a
right to defend myself.
Every woman is worth defending, and
every woman at Stanford deserves the
opporunity to take this class.
So while I know that no decisions are
yet final — and that no one person, be it
President Kennedy or Dean Thomas or
Margo Horn — has complete and total
say over the eventual fate of SWOPSI
174 A, I would submit that for what it
has given to me, and to hundreds of
other Stanford women over the past 10
years, the self-defense for women class is
worth defending.
