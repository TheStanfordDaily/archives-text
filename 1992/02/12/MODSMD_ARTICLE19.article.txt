# Staff members reveal new perk: their bicycle
## 
### 
Several of us at the Center for Materi
als Research (CMR) wished to write and
thank you for your interesting and reveal
ing expose on the Stanford Bookstore.
We are enthusiastic about how the
Bookstore's board of directors has
endeavored to hold onto the best man
agers possible for this important venture
and apparently spared no expense to
provide them with an environment and
perquisites not normally associated with
any corporation.
At CMR we have only a single
perquisite that we know of — our won
derful CMR bicycle, which is available to
all staff for trips around campus.
It is entirely reasonable that our
salaries are a small fraction of those of
the managers in the Bookstore and that
we have no perquisites outside of the
fine bicycle.
And we all think that the vacation

home is a great idea and just what we
need in a time of fiscal stress. How
clever of the Bookstore's board to think
of this far ahead of the current money
crunch.
