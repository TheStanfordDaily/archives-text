# Condoms burst onto campus
## Annual rating contest will stretch into March 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
The Great Condom Rating Contest returns to Stan
ford today, giving students a chance to put prophylac
tics to the test — all in the name of AIDS education.
For the sixth year in a row, volunteers for the
Stanford AIDS Education Project will distribute
thousands of condoms to Stanford students. The
contest is designed to familiarize students with con
doms and emphasize their effectiveness in stopping
the spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
Two thousand packets containing four or five
condoms each will be distributed in White Plaza at
noon today and tomorrow. Each packet also contains
a ballot asking students to judge the condoms on
everything from appearance and comfort to taste
and smell.
Contest organizers said that students don't need to
have a week-long lovefest with that special someone in
order to rate the condoms. All of the questions on the
ballot can be answered if "you just sit around and play
with them," according to sophomore Amy Stevens.
"Just take and open the package, unroll them, feel
them, taste them and see how they smell," she said.
Sophomore Rachel Maddow said she and other
contest organizers actually recommend this sex-free
approach.

"We'd rather that you just play with them," she
said. "We're really trying to promote the idea that
people should get comfortable with condoms and
safer sex before they're about to have sex and need to
be using condoms."
Some may wonder if the contest is intentionally
scheduled for the week of Valentine's Day, when
many a student's thoughts turn to love and other,
more carnal desires.
Maddow explained that the contest is held as
"our celebration of National Condom Week," which
runs from Feb. 14 to 21.
National Condom Week founder and Stanford
graduate Daniel Bao said he "didn't throw darts at
the calendar" to decide when the week would be.
In the past, Stanford has held its contest in cooper
ation with other colleges in the area. This year, how
ever, Bao said he knew of only one other school, West
ern Washington University, holding a similar contest.
Maddow said the contest has traditionally met
with little resistance from alumni, religious organi
zations, administrators and students. The most com
mon reaction from those offered packets is embar
rassment, Maddow said, adding that "90 percent of
the people we offer them to take them" anyway.
This year's packets offer a variety of prophylac-
tics, from the mint-flavored "Kiss
of Mint" condom to the textured
"Birds and Bees" condom, import
ed from Sweden.
Noticeably absent from the
selection are Trojans, the brand

most familiar to many people.
Stevens said that by offering less
common brands, the contest will
encourage participants to experi
ment until they find the right
condom for their needs.
Maddow said many people are
unaware of the differences among
condoms in characteristics like
taste, sensitivity and smell. "Peo
ple just give me wide-eyed stares

when I talk about the different
kinds of condoms," she said.
Ballots are due by March 1,
and organizers are hoping for a
better response than last year,
when less than 30 out of 3,000
ballots were returned.
But Maddow said the main
point of the contest is "to get the
condoms out. That's more impor
tant than getting the results."
