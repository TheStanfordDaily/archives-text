# No apologies from the Bookstore are needed
## 
### 
As Bookstore employees who have
worked for large parts of our careers
with other major retailers, we are
deeply concerned about the unfair cov
erage devoted to the Bookstore over the
past week. We cannot sit back and
allow a few misinformed anonymous
members of the Stanford community
attempt to destroy one of the most effi
cient companies in the United States
today.
The Stanford community that we
serve shows us their appreciation day

after day when they shop in our store.
They are our only purpose for being
here, and we are grateful for the oppor
tunity to serve them. That The Daily
would raise the issue of the compensa
tion structure of the Bookstore is com
pletely inappropriate, given that we run
on one of the lowest expense to sales
ratios in the industry.
We submit that there is another ideo
logically inspired agenda at work here,
feeding on the myth of the non-profit
corporation and stirring up feelings of
jealousy and resentment in these eco
nomically difficult times. These are the
same forces that have been chipping
away at the management of the Univer
sity for the past 18 months and have
resulted in the untimely resignation of
University President Donald Kennedy.
Two great institutions here are at risk,
and it is time for those of us who devote
our careers to making the Bookstore
work stand up for what we believe in.
Each and every one of our employees
is fairly compensated. Without excep
tion, every one has the chance to grow

and advance according to his abilities
and ambition. We believe in what we do
and are proud of our leadership.
None of our employees have any rea
son to be dissatisfied with their com
pensation, and none of our employees
should feel obliged to apologize for
earning a living. We doubt that this let
ter will appear in print, but we are
placing our faith in the fairness of the
system.
