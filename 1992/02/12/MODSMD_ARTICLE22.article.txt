## Zoo to hold risque love tour 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
Something told me it was all
happening at the zoo.
Maybe it was the look in the
giraffe's eye, or the way the
orangutan was sniffing out his
simian friends. Or maybe it was
this news bulletin they sent me.
For its second year, the San
Francisco Zoo is celebrating
Valentine's Day with its some
times risque, but always informa
tive, Sex Tour.
The tour, which will take place
at 9 a.m. Saturday and Sunday, is
an overview of the sexual lives of
animals living at the zoo. From
the slow, frolicking foreplay of the
loris to the quick, determined sex
of the lion (who can copulate 50
times in a day) the tour offers a
broadened perspective of the
study of sexuality.
"We're bringing sex out of the
cages and in front of the public
where it belongs," explained Zoo
spokeswoman Susanna Campbell.
Tour guide Jane Tollini does a
good job of keeping you awake,
with her own brand of frighten
ingly blunt humor.
"The one-hour train tour will
discuss revealing information
about the sexual methods, strate
gies and awesome appendages" of
the animals, Tollini promises.
At times she comes across like
your junior high health teacher,
only now she's been given license
to laugh uncomfortably along
with the rest of the class.
The voyeurs who experienced
last year's tour were somewhat

disappointed that they were
unable to catch any of the animals
in the act. Neither food, music nor
encouraging words were able to
needle the animals into perfor
mance.
Although no promises can be
made for this year's tour, Camp
bell said the Asian rhinos "have
been getting frisky the last couple
of weeks, so you're likely to see
them doing it."
This might prove a special
treat because of the strength and
voracity of the male Asian
rhinoceros.
"They'll bang each other around
because the male has to prove his
masculinity," promised Campbell.
"You know how that is."
One of the new additions to the
tour will be an in-depth look into
the use of contraception at the
zoo.
The tour train will stop to visit
Violet, an orangutan who uses an
oral contraceptive similar to the
ones used by human females. Also
included on the tour is King Lear,
a bison who has had an epi
didymectomy, the bovine equiva
lent of a vasectomy.
Contraception is used at the
zoo to help control the popula
tions of animals who would over
populate out of their natural envi
ronment. Such experimentation
also allows scientists to study
behavior and population control
methods.
The epididymectomy that King
Lear received, for instance, does
not inhibit Lear's social behavior
or sexual prowess like castration
would, Campbell said.
Like last year, this year's train

will be packed with members of
the San Francisco Zoological Soci
ety, who support such endeavors.
Some will hug, kiss and touch
during the tour. Like the animals,
they too should be closely
observed and photographed.
Also featured will be a look into
the roles of homosexuality, fore
play, frequency, duration and bes
tiality in the animal kingdom.
One of the more relaxing,
although possibly intimidating, vis
its will be to the icy sexual kingdom
of the penguins, who generally
choose one mate for life. It might
not be the kind of thing you want
to show the product of a broken
family — it could alter the course of
their future relationships, causing
them to attend more black-tie
affairs than you can afford.
But that's just one of the rea
sons this tour is restricted to zoo
lovers over age 18. The others
you'll have to find out for your
self.
The one-hour tour costs $10
for members of the San Francisco
Zoological Society and $15 for
non-members. It includes a conti
nental breakfast at the conclusion
of the trip, which is more than
most people can handle after see
ing Asian rhinoceroses copulate.
So this weekend, while every
one else is snuggling around the
fireplace and watching "Casa
blanca" over a glass of dry white
wine, visit your less subtle animal
friends at the zoo. In fact, bring a
date — nothing adds a spark to a
relationship quite like the fear
that creatures with really small
brains are having more inventive
sex than you are.

Penguins, while often photographed in groups, generally choose one mate for life. The Valentine's Day
tour offered by the San Francisco Zoo will provide glimpses into their icy sexual practices, along with a
scientific look at the reproductive behavior of other animal species.
