# How do cysts grow teeth?
## Bug explains odd contents of 303-pound tumor

A free visit to Cowell Student Health
Center and the 303-pound Mystery
Prize go to "Missy D" of Twain for send
ing us this week's first question:
can ovarian cysts grow teeth
land hair?
A # Mercifully, they usually don't. The
Inow-infamous 303-pounder
removed from a woman at Stanford
Hospital last October was not your aver
age fluid-filled epithelial sac. That
growth was a benign cystic teratoma,
one of a special class of tumors that
have the capability to produce tissue
types including but not limited to skin,
teeth and hair.
At the outset of my attempt to
answer this question, I tried to get some
information out of the individuals
directly involved in the saga. Unfortu
nately, the 35-year-old former host, the
chief operating surgeon and the cyst
itself were all unavailable for comment,
and I had to hit the books.
My initial forays into the literature
scared me silly. The word "teratoma"
comes from the Greek teratos, meaning
"monster." It shares this root with "ter
atology," the study of birth defects, and
"teratogen," a substance capable of pro
ducing an abnormal fetus.
I was worried that a teratoma would
turn out to be some kind of embryo gone
nightmarishly awry — the kind of birth
defect that would make Thalidomide
seem like Tylenol by comparison.
Happily, I soon discovered that while
a teratoma does have a good deal to do
with abnormal embryonic development,
my initial fears and suspicions were
completely inaccurate.
As it turns out, a cystic teratoma is
derived from what The Oxford Medical
Companion describes as "persistent
embryonic remnants" — cells from the
host's early development that have
retained their ability to differentiate
into many types of tissue.
Sometimes, during an embryo's for
mative stages, material from one of the
germinal layers — the three cell layers
that make up the early embryo — gets
misplaced amidst the complicated shuf
fling and folding of embryonic tissues.
In the case of the 15-score-and-three
pound teratoma that I assume provoked
this week's question, the remnant cells
were derived from an embryonic tissue
precursor known as the ectoderm.
The ectoderm is the outermost of the
three layers that make up the early
embryo. Over the course of develop
ment, the cells of the ectoderm differen
tiate into the skin, appendages, nervous
system and special sense organs —
including the eyes — of the mature
organism.
This little patch of ectoderm, con
fused by its unfamiliar environment,
ceases participating in development and
lies dormant until the person who con
tains them reaches maturity. Then, for
an unknown reason, the cells begin to
grow and differentiate just as they
would have in a developing embryo —
with one hitch.
Differentiation is ordinarily a

scrupulously exacting operation. Within
the embryo, some populations of cells
use chemical and structural cues to
induce other cells to proliferate, lie dor
mant, become other types of cells or
even die. These cues are introduced in a
precise spatial and temporal order,
resulting in The Miracle of the Human
Body.
The adult body, however, is not orga
nized appropriately for the delicacy of
this undertaking. When the future ter
atoma cells begin dividing, there is
nothing to tell them to stop (hence the
Guinness-caliber cyst's incredible size)
or give them a blueprint for orderly
development.
Consequently, cells will differentiate
at random throughout the cyst — result
ing in a liberal scattering of hair, skin,
teeth and, in some cases, nervous tissue.
The behavior of a teratoma depends
on a number of factors, including the
maturity of the tissues enclosed. A ter
atoma that contains a great deal of pre
differentiated tissue will grow more
rapidly than one that contains a large
proportion of cells that are terminally
differentiated.
Worse, an immature teratoma is
more likely to become malignant and
begin invading other parts of the body, a
process known as metastasis. So in
some sense, the more teeth the better.
Just in case any of you men are
chuckling in your midterm-week stub
ble, thanking The Big Man that this
can't happen to you, listen up: although
the ovary is the most common location
for a teratoma, these cystic growths can
occur at any site that marks the fusion
of developing sections of the body. Con
genital cysts can appear in the kidneys
or even the corner of the eye.
In fact, the second-most common
location for a teratoma is the testicles —
and unlike ovarian cysts, testicular ter
atomae are almost always malignant.
So wipe that smirk off your face, and
think about trying to fit three hundred
more pounds into your Girbauds.
