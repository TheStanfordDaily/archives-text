# Bodily odors may play role in sex
## Smelly scents influence physiology, possibly behavior, studies say

who has conducted exten
sive research in this area.
Women who live
together in close proximi-

ty, like college roommates,
often menstruate around the
same time as a result of
pheromones.
"Studies on the synchro
nization of the menstrual
cycle have been replicated in
[groups of] all women and
coeducational settings,"
McClintock said.

Some studies suggest that the
source of these pheromones is perspira
tion, but McClintock maintained that
these reports are still speculative.

In addition,
women's men
-1 strual cycles
may be influ
enced by the
odors of men.

In a series of
experiments,

women who dated
more often had

shorter and more regular

cycles. Women who had sex

with men once a week were

more likely to have regular men-

strual cycles.
In another study, underarm perspira
tion from men mixed with alcohol and

dabbed on the upper lip of women
served to regularize their periods.
Men, too, show signs of being
sensitive to pheromones, accord-

ing to some studies.
One experiment involved taking swabs

of sweat from the underarms of women
volunteers at different points in their
menstrual cycles and having male volun
teers smell them. The men were able to
detect differences in perspiration taken at
different points in the cycles.
Experimental evidence for the effects
of human pheromones on sexual
behavior remains skimpy. "There is
not anything definitive. The role is
going to be a modulating role, if
[pheromonesl have a role at all,"
McClintock said.

Because there are numerous factors
involved in sexual attraction, the role of
human pheromones is very difficult to
study. "You would need a very sophisti
cated experiment that takes the emo
tions of the person into account,"
McClintock said.

Many animal species produce
pheromones in specialized glands or

excrete them in
waste products,
such as urine, feces

and perspiration.
According to Biology Prof. Robert
Sapolsky, scientific investigations have
reported that most male pheromones
are breakdown products of testosterone
whereas female pheromones, chemical
ly more complex, are fatty acids
The female silk moth releases
pheromones which can attract males
from as far away as two miles. Relying
on about 20,000 receptor cells in its
antennae, the male silk moth sets out
on a zigzagging flight pattern to track
down the source of the seductive smells.
The effect of pheromones has been
well documented in mice. Erotic bou
quets emitted by male mice cause hor
monal excitation in females. Substances
in male urine were shown to be respon
sible for accelerating puberty in young
females, synchronizing the time when
females go into heat and blocking preg
nancy in recently inseminated female
mice.
Although the existence of sexual
scent signals in humans is speculative,
some perfume companies are taking
advantage of the theory. Musk-like per
fumes contain breakdown products of
synthetic testosterone, and Chanel N g 5
allegedly uses a synthetic compound
similar to a substance found in the
sweat of male calves.
So in the spirit of Valentine's Day,
while you follow your heart, remember
to follow your nose.
Who knows? You might find that dat
ing at Stanford does exist!

grant chemical substances known as
pheromones. These potent scents can
trigger physiological or behavioral
responses in members of the same
species.
When produced by male boars, for
instance, pheromones make the sow in
heat adopt the mating posture.

Martha

McCl i n -
tock, a biophysi-

ology professor at

the University of Chicago
who has conducted exten
sive research in this area.
Women who live
together in close proximi-

ty, like college roommates,
often menstruate around the
same time as a result of
pheromones.
"Studies on the synchro
nization of the menstrual
cycle have been replicated in
[groups of] all women and
coeducational settings,"
McClintock said.

Some studies suggest that the
source of these pheromones is perspira
tion, but McClintock maintained that
these reports are still speculative.

In addition,
women's men
-1 strual cycles
may be influ
enced by the
odors of men.

In a series of
experiments,

women who dated
more often had

shorter and more regular

cycles. Women who had sex

with men once a week were

more likely to have regular men-

strual cycles.
In another study, underarm perspira
tion from men mixed with alcohol and

dabbed on the upper lip of women
served to regularize their periods.
Men, too, show signs of being
sensitive to pheromones, accord-

ing to some studies.
One experiment involved taking swabs

of sweat from the underarms of women
volunteers at different points in their
menstrual cycles and having male volun
teers smell them. The men were able to
detect differences in perspiration taken at
different points in the cycles.
Experimental evidence for the effects
of human pheromones on sexual
behavior remains skimpy. "There is
not anything definitive. The role is
going to be a modulating role, if
[pheromonesl have a role at all,"
McClintock said.

Because there are numerous factors
involved in sexual attraction, the role of
human pheromones is very difficult to
study. "You would need a very sophisti
cated experiment that takes the emo
tions of the person into account,"
McClintock said.

Many animal species produce
pheromones in specialized glands or

excrete them in
waste products,
such as urine, feces

and perspiration.
According to Biology Prof. Robert
Sapolsky, scientific investigations have
reported that most male pheromones
are breakdown products of testosterone
whereas female pheromones, chemical
ly more complex, are fatty acids
The female silk moth releases
pheromones which can attract males
from as far away as two miles. Relying
on about 20,000 receptor cells in its
antennae, the male silk moth sets out
on a zigzagging flight pattern to track
down the source of the seductive smells.
