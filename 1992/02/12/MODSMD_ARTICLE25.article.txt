## Too little, too late: final surge falls short at Notre Dame 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Still recovering from long weekends,
shaky Stanford and Notre Dame played
more basketball last night when they
should have been sleeping.

Fighting Irish 64 |
| Cardinal 63

The Fighting Irish wobbled away with
a 64-63 win, but both teams played hang
over basketball. Drained by back-to-back
slugfests against No. 7 Arizona and Ari
zona State, Stanford flew to Notre Dame
and floundered.
"That's not typical of Stanford
teams," said Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery. "I don't want to take anything

away from Notre Dame because they did
a good job, specifically on defense. We
seemed to have a letdown tonight."
Stanford is now 13-6 heading into Sat
urday's Pacific 10 Conference game
against California at the Oakland Colise
um. The Fighting Irish snapped a two
game home losing streak and are 8-11.
After losing to Michigan Sunday, the
emotional Irish were vulnerable to
defeat. But Stanford shot 40 percent
from the floor and an atrocious 6-of-16
from the free-throw line. Take away
Peter Dukes' game-high 21 points and
Stanford was a comatose 17-for-51 from
the field.
"Mentally, they were trying to get
themselves up, but I think physically
they failed," said Montgomery. "They all
felt excited about being at Notre Dame."
Sleepy Stanford led 15-14 when senior
Adam Keefe picked up his second and
third personal fouls in a nightmare 20-
second stretch. Keefe went to the bench
with 8:25 left in the first half and Stan

ford never led again.
After missing an inside shot, Keefe
reached over LaPhonso Ellis' back and
was whistled for his second personal. The
Irish missed at the other end, Keefe
rebounded and started on a coast-to-coast
drive. But after faking Ellis out at the
free throw line, Keefe steamrolled Notre
Dame center Jon Ross for a player control
foul. With Keefe watching from the
penalty box for the rest of the half, both
teams struggled offensively. Ellis scored
only three points as the Irish stumbled to
a 29-24 intermission advantage.
"It was kind of a wash," said Mont
gomery about the Keefe-Ellis match-up.

"Neither player did much."
Notre Dame opened a 40-30 lead in the
second stanza, but Keefe generated a
Cardinal comeback. In a three-minute
blitz Keefe tallied four points, two
rebounds, two assists, and a steal as
Stanford cut the Irish lead to 42-40.
Stanford had a chance to tie at 44, but
Marcus Lollie missed a free throw and
Notre Dame slipped away.
Again the Irish built a 10-point lead,
58-48, but a dunk from Keefe and a 3-
pointer from Lollie gave Stanford a
chance with two minutes left.
Paul Garrett and Brent Williams
missed short jumpers, but Notre Dame

didn't ice the game until Ellis made one
of two free throws with eight seconds left
for a 64-60 lead.
Dukes and Lollie hit back-to-back 3-
pointers in the last 20 seconds, but out of
timeouts, Stanford was out of luck
against the Irish.
