# Reality KO's Tyson
## 
### 
The rage that once made
boxer Mike Tyson the
heavyweight champion of
the world has finally forced him
to discover that the ring is not
reality.
Protected by his fame and the
entourage of promoters and
bodyguards that watched his
every move, Tyson has lived his
life as if the world were just
another easily manipulated
opponent. Crash a car? No prob
lem. Tyson would just walk
across the street and buy anoth
er on the spot.

I have the money, Tyson told
the world, I can do anything.
Before his loss two years ago
to James "Buster" Douglas, it
seemed that Tyson could do any
thing. The world was in awe of
the spectacle that was the man.
In the simplicity that fueled
the image, Tyson would walk
into the ring sans robe, clothed
only in black shorts and shoes.
There was no music blaring his
entrance. There was no pomp
and circumstance. There was
only 220 pounds of intensity
glaring from a corner of a ring
we all knew he would soon own.
Tyson used fear as his
weapon, and it worked. He
became the youngest heavy
weight champ in the history of
the sport, and he had the world
at his feet.
But that world began to
crumble. The man who saved
Tyson from a life of juvenile
delinquency, Gus D'Amoto,
died. Suddenly the white haired
trainer who had nurtured his
prodigy like a son gave way to a
selfish promoter with hair
almost as famous as the man he
represents.
Don King took Tyson under
his wing, but he seemed to offer
little protection. At grocery
store check-out counters across
the land we watched and fol
lowed the slow disintegration of
a man who had once seemed
rock solid. It was obvious he was
not in control of his career; King
played him like a puppet and
Tyson took it. It was King who
decided what happened and
where. Tyson said he had a hand
in the process, but it was obvi
ous to all that he did not.

As his hold on his actions
within the ring began to change,
so did his life outside the ropes.
Tyson was a star, and he lived
the high-profile lifestyle. The
headlines screamed of his mar
riage and divorce, and all the
alleged beatings in between.
Tyson crashed cars and got into
street fights with ex-opponents.
He was a time bomb waiting to
happen said former heavyweight
champion Larry Holmes after
the two had fought, "and within
five years he will either be dead
or in jail."
At the beauty pageant that
Tyson attended in Indianapolis
last summer the bomb went off,
and Holmes is seeing his predic
tion come true.
On July 19, 1991, Mike
Tyson's selfish, childlike
approach to the world around
him finally went that one step to
far. Need some sex? No problem.
Tyson just called a girl from his
limo and lured her out of bed at
1:30 am with the promise of par
ties and talk. He then raped her.
I have the fame and the
power, Tyson's actions implied, 1
can do anything.
No Mike, you can not. Taking
a naive 18-year old girl up to
your room and using the muscle
that strikes fear and admiration
in the hearts of men the world
over to pry open legs and rip off
panties is not one of the perks of
being an athletic super-star.
Tyson was also accused of
fondling other contestants and
of exposing himself to his female
driver while in Indy. He was
described during the trial as a
"thug," exactly the mean, street
wise image he projected in the
ring. We once saw him as a per
former doing an act that we
could admire for its raw beauty
and power, but now the act is
real and that force is ugly.
Tyson is free on a $30,000
bond, yet on March 6 how free
he will remain will be deter
mined by a judge. He faces up to
60 years in prison and whatever
he gets is what he deserves.
Tyson tried to mold life to his
own standards, and is now dis
covering that those standards
are unacceptable.
He will go to prison, and for
the first time since D'Amoto
took him off the streets 13
years ago, Mike Tyson will be
alone. In that isolation perhaps
he will finally realize that he
cannot dispatch with the rules
of life as easily as the men he
has fought.

Tyson's work inside the ring, not
out.
