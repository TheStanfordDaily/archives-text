### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Neither Mother Nature nor the University of the
Pacific could stop the Stanford women's tennis
team yesterday as the Cardinal rolled to a 6-0 victo
ry in Stockton.
"For some reason it is always windy there," Emma
Woodhouse said. "But we all played pretty well."
Heather Willens led the Stanford contingent
with the first of the squad's six straight-set romps
in singles. Willens, who is ranked No. 5 in the coun
try, beat Leslie O'Keefe 6-2, 6-4.
Laxmi Poruri followed with a 6-1, 6-3 trouncing
of Trisha Lee. Last week the Cardinal sophomore
asserted herself as one of the top players in the
nation by reaching the semifinals of the Rolex
Indoor National Championships, the third leg of the
collegiate Grand Slam.
At No. 3 singles Kylie Johnson mowed down
Kathy Galolo 6-1, 6-0.
Woodhouse notched a victory when Kim Chang
was forced to withdraw with a sore arm. Chang
hyperextended her arm early in the second set and
aggravated it serving.
Woodhouse was one game away from closing out
the match 6-2, 5-4. The Cardinal sophomore concen
trated on improving her serve and was pleased with
the results. "I was working on hitting the serve flat
ter," she said. "It was kind of hard (with the rough
weather) but it went OK â€” it's getting better."
At No. 5 singles, freshman Amy Chiminello
pounded Yi Gurash 6-0, 6-1. "I played a lot better.
Not that I was playing badly before, but I felt sharp
er, more secure," Chiminello said.
Mario Carruth rounded out the singles competi
tion with a 6-1, 6-3 trouncing of Tracey Lee.
Rain aborted the three doubles matches. Willens
and Poruri, the third-ranked pair in the country,
were up 6-4, 3-0 when the showers started.
The No. 15 tandem, Johnson and Woodhouse,
came within a game of victory. They were ahead of
southpaws Trisha Lee and O' Keefe 6-1, 5-4.
Chiminello and Carruth led Gurash and Uyema
by a score of 6-2, 2-0 when the match was called.
Stanford raised its dual match record to 5-0 with
the win, while Pacific fell to 1-5.
The Cardinal, currently No. 5 in the nation, faces
two top-10 squads this weekend. Pepperdine visits
Saturday for a 1:00 p.m. showdown and Stanford
travels east to face California on Sunday.
"We're pretty excited (about the Pepperdine
match) because this will be our first tough match,"
Woodhouse said.
