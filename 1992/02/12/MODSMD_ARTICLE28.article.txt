The Stanford synchronized swimming team
opened its season by dominating the competi
tion at the UC-Berkeley Regional Meet last
weekend. The Cardinal took first place in all
routine events, as well as the first five spots in
the senior compulsory figure event.
The results are especially impressive since
two members of the team are injured. Fresh
man Jenny Curtis did not compete because of
shoulder tendinitis and senior Melinda
Downey performed with a back injury. "We're

hoping to get everyone healthy again by
nationals," senior captain Michelle Ghert said.
In the junior compulsory figure event,
Stanford senior Rekha Rao finished second.
Senior figures were won by sophomore Debbie
Downes while Downey and Ghert took second
and third respectively.
Downes and Downey teamed up with
sophomore Georgia Bauman to take first place
in the trio event, with sophomore Kristna
Evans, Ghert and Rao taking second. Bauman
and Downes won the duet event, while Evans
and Ghert finished second.

Downeswas pleased with her performance.
"I feel like I did the best I could at this point in
the season," said the sophomore.
Stanford has placed second at the National
Collegiate Championships for the past five
years. The only team to beat Stanford since
1986 is the Ohio State's varsity squad. "We're
a strong team because we have a good coach
ing staff and talented swimmers that like
working together," Downes said.
Stanford will host Ohio State at the Stan
ford Invitational Regional Championships on
Sunday, March Ist at DeGuerre Pool.
