# Ice men crush Bruins, 7-2 and 11-4
## 
### Dick Winters 
The goals came early and often last
weekend as Stanford exacted revenge
against UCLA. After falling to the
Bruins 3-2 in early October, the Stan
ford ice hockey team had developed a
potent offensive punch — and a burn
ing desire to avenge the early season
loss. The Cardinal proved October was
a fluke 18 times this weekend, as they
won 7-2 on Friday, and 11-4 on Satur
day to take sole possession of first
place in the Pacific Coast Hockey Asso
ciation.
Despite enjoying a successful sea
son, the setback to UCLA plagued the
Cardinal's conscience. Going into this
weekend's series, the players were con
fident and excited at the prospect of
sweeping the Bruins and keeping them
in third place.

"We've worked hard against stiff
competition all year," said Stanford
head coach Ernie Ferrari, whose team
improved to 14-3 in the PCHA (16-5
overall). "We've expanded our systems
of play and were anxious for a test
against someone to whom we had pre
viously lost."
Faced with this task, Stanford
showed just how explosive their
offense had become in the months
since the last meeting. After using a
five goal third period to secure Friday's
victory, senior forward Chip Hall kept
up the offensive pressure on Saturday
by tickling the twine after only 1:30
had ticked off the clock.
Before the Bruins knew what had
hit them, Stanford was on its way to
the locker room after the first period
with a 5-1 lead. The Cardinal added
six more goals for good measure, leav

ing no doubt who was the better team.
"UCLA hasn't gotten worse, we've
gotten better," said Ferrari. "This
weekend shows just how much better
we've become."
Stanford not only has the league's
leading offense with 105 goals scored in
15 games, but also leads the league in
defense, allowing only 27 goals against.
Leading the way for the high-powered
Cardinal is freshman Luke Winter,
whose 53 points lead the league in scor
ing. After being sent to the hospital in
the first meeting with UCI>A because of
a slash to the wrist, Winter was glad to
get out old aggressions.
"It was like scratching an old itch,"
said Winter, who had five goals and
four assists over the weekend. "I've
been thinking about this series ever
since my trip to the emergency room
(in October)."
