Due to an editing error, a sen
tence in a story Monday was incor
rect. The sentence should have
read: "Council of Presidents mem
ber John Overdeck said yesterday
that student action concerning the
issue is unlikely."
Yesterday's Daily used law stu
dent Jamie Kershaw as a source
concerning plans to send articles
about Keith Rabois to various law
firms. Kershaw knew of the plans,
but was not involved himself.
