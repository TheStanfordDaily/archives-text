# Tuition to increase sharply; undergrad costs up by 7.5%
## Budget crisis forces officials to break earlier pledge 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Stanford officially abandoned
its two-year-old pledge to limit
tuition increases to 1 percent over
inflation yesterday, announcing a
7.5 percent hike in the total pack
age of tuition and room and board.
The cost for an undergraduate
to attend the University next year
will be $22,850. Tuition alone will
be $16,536 — a 9.5 percent hike
— while room and board will
increase by only 2.5 percent.
Funding for financial aid will be
adjusted to meet the increased stu

dent need, according to University
Budget Director Tim Warner.
Last year's cost increase was
held to 5.2 percent, although the
University did raise the charge by
7.5 percent in 1989-90.
Inflation was projected by the
University to be 3.5 percent,
meaning that the total charge
would have gone up no more than
4.5 percent under the old policy,
Warner said.
Graduate student tuition will
also increase. The rate for general
graduate students is the same as
for undergraduates, but the tuition
rates at graduate schools will vary:

• 11.6 percent increase in the
School of Engineering;
• 10.9 percent increase in the
School of Law;
• 9.5 percent increase in the
School of Medicine; and
• 8.3 increase in the Graduate
School of Business.
"We made a commitment
about holding down costs, but we
have made a much more funda
mental commitment to maintain
the quality of a Stanford educa
tion," Provost James Rosse said
in a statement issued yesterday.
"We have found that we can no
longer meet both of those com
mitments at once."
Rosse left for Irvine, Calif., to
handle business relating to his new
position with Freedom Newspapers
directly after yesterday's Board of
Trustees meeting, in which the
tuition hikes were decided.
University President Donald
Kennedy told the ASSU Senate
last night that although "nobody
likes this," it is "the right way to
maintain the absolutely critical
balance . . . between quality and
affordability."
Two years ago, the trustees,
hoping to set a national trend,
adopted a policy of not raising the
cost of attending Stanford more
than 1 percent over inflation.
But other universities have
continued to raise tuition 5 to 10
percent per year, and officials said
the current $43-million budget
shortfall forced reconsideration of
the past tuition policy.
"Having taken the leadership
position, we found there are no
followers," Rosse said.
University budget planners
were still hoping to maintain the
the inflation plus 1 percent pledge
back in October when budget
reduction targets were announced,
but a higher tuition increase

became necessary "after looking at
the financial situation," Warner
said.
Part of the University's budget
proposal involves limiting the cost
of room and board while increas
ing tuition at a faster rate, there
by limiting the overall cost of
attending Stanford.
The original shift between
tuition and room and board gen
erated approximately $3 million
for the budget deficit without
breaking the University's pledge
to limit hikes. The additional
tuition increase will produce
about another $3 million.
"We have made a fundamental
commitment to sustaining the
educational quality of this institu
tion," Warner said. "Unfortu
nately, there was no way of avoid
ing a further increase in tuition."
Kennedy said the undergradu
ate rates are not likely to become
significantly more expensive than
those at similar institutions. In a
survey conducted by the Cam
bridge Associates, Stanford
ranked 36th in total charges.
"We might move from 36th to
somewhere in the high to mid
20's, but we will still be slightly
below the institutions with whom
we share the largest number of
joint applicants," he said.
Princeton recently announced a
6.3 percent increase in total
charges, and the proposed hike at
Brown University is 7 percent,
according to their campus newspa

pers. Both institutions will be more
expensive than Stanford next year.
Dean of Admissions James
Montoya said the tuition hike will
"put the admissions office in the
position of having to better articu
late the value of a Stanford educa
tion, which is particularly impor
tant for students choosing between
public and private institutions."
Montoya emphasized that "all
of this needs to be looked at within
the context of the tuition increases
at comparable institutions."
The announcement of an
undergraduate tuition hike was
accompanied by several changes
to financial aid.
As the University is making
reductions by "tightening the
financial aid programs," there will
be an additional allocation of
$500,000 to $600,000 to "relieve
the self-help burden," Warner said.
Although tinkering with finan
cial aid programs will save about
$2.5 million,"the bottom line is
that we will still be increasing the
financial aid budget by $2 to $2.5
million,"he said.
The University's "absolute"
commitment to maintaining
need-blind admissions was also
emphasized by Kennedy.
Montoya said he was "pleased
to hear that additional funding
was being allocated to financial
aid" because it is "important for
us to do anything we can to make
financial aid awards more com
petitive."

need-blind admissions was also
emphasized by Kennedy.
Montoya said he was "pleased
to hear that additional funding
was being allocated to financial
aid" because it is "important for
us to do anything we can to make
financial aid awards more com
petitive."
Stanford officially abandoned
its two-year-old pledge to limit
tuition increases to 1 percent over
inflation yesterday, announcing a
7.5 percent hike in the total pack
age of tuition and room and board.
The cost for an undergraduate
to attend the University next year
will be $22,850. Tuition alone will
be $16,536 — a 9.5 percent hike
— while room and board will
increase by only 2.5 percent.
Funding for financial aid will be
adjusted to meet the increased stu

dent need, according to University
Budget Director Tim Warner.
Last year's cost increase was
held to 5.2 percent, although the
University did raise the charge by
7.5 percent in 1989-90.
Inflation was projected by the
University to be 3.5 percent,
meaning that the total charge
would have gone up no more than
4.5 percent under the old policy,
Warner said.
Graduate student tuition will
also increase. The rate for general
graduate students is the same as
for undergraduates, but the tuition
rates at graduate schools will vary:

• 11.6 percent increase in the
School of Engineering;
• 10.9 percent increase in the
School of Law;
• 9.5 percent increase in the
School of Medicine; and
• 8.3 increase in the Graduate
School of Business.
"We made a commitment
about holding down costs, but we
have made a much more funda
mental commitment to maintain
the quality of a Stanford educa
tion," Provost James Rosse said
in a statement issued yesterday.
"We have found that we can no
longer meet both of those com
mitments at once."
Rosse left for Irvine, Calif., to
handle business relating to his new
position with Freedom Newspapers
directly after yesterday's Board of
Trustees meeting, in which the
tuition hikes were decided.
University President Donald
Kennedy told the ASSU Senate
last night that although "nobody
likes this," it is "the right way to
maintain the absolutely critical
balance . . . between quality and
affordability."
Two years ago, the trustees,
hoping to set a national trend,
adopted a policy of not raising the
cost of attending Stanford more
than 1 percent over inflation.
But other universities have
continued to raise tuition 5 to 10
percent per year, and officials said
the current $43-million budget
shortfall forced reconsideration of
the past tuition policy.
"Having taken the leadership
position, we found there are no
followers," Rosse said.
University budget planners
were still hoping to maintain the
the inflation plus 1 percent pledge
back in October when budget
reduction targets were announced,
but a higher tuition increase

became necessary "after looking at
the financial situation," Warner
said.
Part of the University's budget
proposal involves limiting the cost
of room and board while increas
ing tuition at a faster rate, there
by limiting the overall cost of
attending Stanford.
The original shift between
tuition and room and board gen
erated approximately $3 million
for the budget deficit without
breaking the University's pledge
to limit hikes. The additional
tuition increase will produce
about another $3 million.
"We have made a fundamental
commitment to sustaining the
educational quality of this institu
tion," Warner said. "Unfortu
nately, there was no way of avoid
ing a further increase in tuition."
Kennedy said the undergradu
ate rates are not likely to become
significantly more expensive than
those at similar institutions. In a
survey conducted by the Cam
bridge Associates, Stanford
ranked 36th in total charges.
"We might move from 36th to
somewhere in the high to mid
20's, but we will still be slightly
below the institutions with whom
we share the largest number of
joint applicants," he said.
Princeton recently announced a
6.3 percent increase in total
charges, and the proposed hike at
Brown University is 7 percent,
according to their campus newspa

pers. Both institutions will be more
expensive than Stanford next year.
Dean of Admissions James
Montoya said the tuition hike will
"put the admissions office in the
position of having to better articu
late the value of a Stanford educa
tion, which is particularly impor
tant for students choosing between
public and private institutions."
Montoya emphasized that "all
of this needs to be looked at within
the context of the tuition increases
at comparable institutions."
The announcement of an
undergraduate tuition hike was
accompanied by several changes
to financial aid.
As the University is making
reductions by "tightening the
financial aid programs," there will
be an additional allocation of
$500,000 to $600,000 to "relieve
the self-help burden," Warner said.
Although tinkering with finan
cial aid programs will save about
$2.5 million,"the bottom line is
that we will still be increasing the
financial aid budget by $2 to $2.5
million,"he said.
The University's "absolute"
commitment to maintaining
need-blind admissions was also
emphasized by Kennedy.
Montoya said he was "pleased
to hear that additional funding
was being allocated to financial
aid" because it is "important for
us to do anything we can to make
