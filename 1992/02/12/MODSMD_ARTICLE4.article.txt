# Tuition to increase sharply; undergrad costs up by 7.5%
## Budget crisis forces officials to break earlier pledge 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Stanford officially abandoned
its two-year-old pledge to limit
tuition increases to 1 percent over
inflation yesterday, announcing a
7.5 percent hike in the total pack
age of tuition and room and board.
The cost for an undergraduate
to attend the University next year
will be $22,850. Tuition alone will
be $16,536 — a 9.5 percent hike
— while room and board will
increase by only 2.5 percent.
Funding for financial aid will be
adjusted to meet the increased stu

dent need, according to University
Budget Director Tim Warner.
Last year's cost increase was
held to 5.2 percent, although the
University did raise the charge by
7.5 percent in 1989-90.
Inflation was projected by the
University to be 3.5 percent,
meaning that the total charge
would have gone up no more than
4.5 percent under the old policy,
Warner said.
Graduate student tuition will
also increase. The rate for general
graduate students is the same as
for undergraduates, but the tuition
rates at graduate schools will vary:

• 11.6 percent increase in the
School of Engineering;
• 10.9 percent increase in the
School of Law;
• 9.5 percent increase in the
School of Medicine; and
• 8.3 increase in the Graduate
School of Business.
"We made a commitment
about holding down costs, but we
have made a much more funda
mental commitment to maintain
the quality of a Stanford educa
tion," Provost James Rosse said
in a statement issued yesterday.
