# Bookstore will review its practices
## Perks to get closer look 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Bookstore's board of directors
announced yesterday that it will hire outside
lawyers and accountants to "undertake a thor
ough review" of the Bookstore's compensation
practices in the wake of disclosures made last
week about the lavish perquisites the store pro
vides some of its senior employees.
The announcement, made in a single-page state
ment, followed an emergency meeting called to
address a report in last Wednesday's Daily that the
Bookstore provides a central California vacation
home, a leased motor home and eight automobiles
to some of its senior employees free of charge.
The vacation home and motor home are owned
by the store's top two managers, Eldon Speed and
Philip Chiaramonte, and are leased back to the
Bookstore through a consulting firm operated by
Speed and Chiaramonte.
The Daily story "raised some very important
issues" that the Bookstore's board feels should be
examined by "professionals," said History Prof.
Peter Stansky, the board's president, in an inter
view yesterday.
The Bookstore is a nonprofit, tax-exempt cor
poration run independently of the University and
overseen by a board of seven Stanford faculty,
staff members and students.


Ernest Villanueva — Daily
Peter Stansky, president of the Stanford Book
store's board of directors, leaves the store yes
terday. The board announced that it is launching
a review of Bookstore compensation practices.
In its statement, the board said
it believes the base salaries of
Speed and Chiaramonte, which
are both well above $100,000 a
year, are appropriate. But "it has
become clear that the board was
not as well informed as it should
have been on various aspects of
employee compensation more gen
erally," the statement said.
Consequently, the board
announced, it will take three
actions:
• Accountants and lawyers
"who are specialists in dealing
with nonprofit organizations"
will be hired to review "all issues
relating to compensation of Book
store employees";
• Advice will be sought from
outside lawyers on the appropri
ate role for the board of directors
to play in overseeing the Book
store; and
• An outside accountant or
attorney will be hired to attend
the Bookstore's board meetings
and "to assist the board in its reg
ular deliberations."
The board will reconvene in
early March to discuss prelimi
nary findings, according to Stan
sky. "We would like to move as
quickly as possible," he said.
Stanksy said the board had
considered taking more concrete
actions yesterday, but decided to
delay any decisions until the legal
and accounting reviews were com
pleted. He would not say what
actions had been under considera
tion.
Stansky said that "at the
moment" he has no plans to
resign as the Bookstore's presi
dent, but he voiced distress at hav
ing to deal with the questions
raised by The Daily's report. "I
don't need this," he said. "This is

not part of my
professional life."
According to
Stansky, the
board has not yet
decided which
firms it will hire
to do the account
ing and legal
work it is seeking.
The outside help

may prove costly, he said, but it
"will be money well spent if these
issues are resolved."
The home leased by the Book
store is located in Twain Harte,
Calif., which is about 125 miles
east of Stanford on the edge of the
Stanislaus National Forest.
In addition to thousands of dol
lars in lease payments made to
Speed and Chiaramonte's con
sulting firm, the Bookstore has
spent more than $69,000 to fur
nish the two-story, 3,100 square
ft. home. Purchases made with
Bookstore funds included a
$4,341 hot tub, a $5,888 satellite
dish and a $3,681 comforter and
bedroom set.
Speed, the Bookstore's general
manager, is provided with a 1991
model year Infiniti Q45. Chiara
monte, the store's assistant man
ager, is provided with a 1990
Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz, one of
three Cadillacs the Bookstore has
purchased in the last three years.
Other vehicles currently
owned or leased by the Bookstore
for use of its senior employees
include a Mazda RX-7 convertible,
an Acura Legend and a Volvo 740.
Speed and Chiaramonte are
among the best paid college book
store managers in the country.
The perquisites they and several
other senior Stanford Bookstore
employees receive are unheard of
elsewhere in the industry, The
Daily found.
At Harvard's bookstore, for
example, where sales are 60 per
cent higher than Stanford, none

of the employees is provided with
vacation facilities or an automo
bile. The only other college book
store known to provide any of its
employees with a vehicle is the
University of Washington, where
the top store manager drives the
bookstore van to and from work.
During the workday, the same
van is used to make store deliver
ies.
Provost James Rosse expressed
concern last week about the dis
closures. "If true, these disclo
sures are troubling," he said Feb.
5. "Stanford University has acted
in good faith in its relations with
the Bookstore and has expected
the same fair treatment in
return."
In its statement, the Book
store's board did not contest any
of the facts presented in The
Daily story.
The board "continues to be
committed to providing the Stan
ford community with the best
possible books and services at the
lowest possible price," the state
ment said.
Other members of the Book
store's board of directors either
refused to comment or did not
return phone calls placed yester
day afternoon. Speed, the Book
store's general manager, did not
return a phone call.
