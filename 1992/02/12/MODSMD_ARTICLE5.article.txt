# Bookstore will review its practices
## Perks to get closer look 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Bookstore's board of directors
announced yesterday that it will hire outside
lawyers and accountants to "undertake a thor
ough review" of the Bookstore's compensation
practices in the wake of disclosures made last
week about the lavish perquisites the store pro
vides some of its senior employees.
The announcement, made in a single-page state
ment, followed an emergency meeting called to
address a report in last Wednesday's Daily that the
Bookstore provides a central California vacation
home, a leased motor home and eight automobiles
to some of its senior employees free of charge.
The vacation home and motor home are owned
by the store's top two managers, Eldon Speed and
Philip Chiaramonte, and are leased back to the
Bookstore through a consulting firm operated by
Speed and Chiaramonte.
The Daily story "raised some very important
issues" that the Bookstore's board feels should be
examined by "professionals," said History Prof.
Peter Stansky, the board's president, in an inter
view yesterday.
The Bookstore is a nonprofit, tax-exempt cor
poration run independently of the University and
overseen by a board of seven Stanford faculty,
staff members and students.
