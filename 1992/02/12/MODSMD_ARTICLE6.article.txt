University President Donald Kennedy
addressed the ASSU Senate last night, cov
ering topics ranging from the perquisites
received by top Bookstore employees to
next year's proposed 7.5 percent increase
in tuition and room and board.
Also, after more than four weeks of
debate, the senate cast a final vote on lim
iting flier use in ASSU campaigns. The
senate voted to eliminated all flier limits.
Senate candidates were formerly allowed
to distribute 500 fliers, and Council of
President slates were held to 750 fliers
during past elections.
Kennedy spoke to the senators for
about 10 minutes before the meeting was
opened for questions. The subject raised
most during the question period was the
proposed tuition hike (see related story,
this page). Senators were primarily con

into the tuition hike and the effect of the

Kennedy, saying it was his "job to bring
the bad news," announced the increase

ment a tuition hike. Kennedy, however,
said a substantial amount of student input
went into the decision.
"We had a very devoted amount of stu
dent participation in the Cabinet Commit
tee on Budget and Strategic Planning,"
Kennedy said.
Council of Presidents member John
Overdeck, however, also said he felt stu
dents weren't adequately represented in
the tuition decision.
"I guess it's a done deal, but I don't
think it's right," he said.
Kennedy also discussed the recent con
troversy about the perquisites for Book
store employees. "I just want to say that
we have had long meetings on the sub
ject," he said. "The Bookstore is working
on the problem hard."
