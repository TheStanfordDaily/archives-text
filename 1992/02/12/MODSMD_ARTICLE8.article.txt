# Biddle expected to join race for House
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Paul Biddle will likely resign
his position at Stanford and
announce his candidacy for the
open 14th District congression
al seat tomorrow.
The on-campus Navy regu
lator has scheduled a press con
ference at the Palo Alto restau
rant Chez Louis for 1:30 p.m.
tomorrow afternoon to publicly
discuss his future.
Although Biddle empha
sized that he is not a candidate
yet, he said he has taken out
petitions to "test the waters."
A potential candidate must
sign out certified blank peti
tions before collecting official
signatures.
Biddle refused to comment on
a Sim Jose Mercury News report
yesterday that he has "declared
|his| intention to run," but it is
likely that the process of signing
out petitions was taken as a sig
nal for his possible campaign.
The 14th District, which
includes Stanford, will be
vacant as Law Prof. Tom Camp
bell runs for the seat of retiring
Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.
If Biddle decides to run, he
will be required to resign his
oversight role at Stanford.
During his stormy three

and-a-half year term at the
University, Biddle has often
locked horns with officials
from Stanford and his bosses at
the Office of Naval Research.
His investigations launched
the indirect-cost controversy,
and he has filed a qui tam suit
seeking damages for alleged
overbiliing of the government.
Biddle has alleged that Stan
ford overcharged the govern
ment by $480 million during
the 1980s for indirect costs,
staff benefits and equipment
purchases.
The University had no com
ment on Biddle's possible can
didacy and "never will have a
comment," according to Larry
Horton, associate vice presi
dent for public affairs.
"The University never takes
a position on any campaign,"
Horton said. But he added that
the University continues to be
"deeply concerned" about the
conflict of interest presented
by Biddle's qui tam suit.
If he decides to run, Biddle is
likely to face competition from
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett and
San Mateo County Supervisor
Tom Hueningin the Republican
primary. Democratic con
tenders include Assemblyman
Ted Lempert and San Mateo
County Supervisor Tom Nolan.
