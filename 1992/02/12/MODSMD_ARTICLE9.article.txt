# Bush's financial aid plan raises concerns
## 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
Financial aid advocates say they are con
cerned over President Bush's budget plan,
which includes a requirement that students
maintain a C average or lose their federal Pell
grants.
The proposal is "an extra [requirement]
that only applies to poorer students," and is
therefore "inherently skewed," said senior
Vince Ricci, director of the ASSU Financial
Aid Advocacy Office.
But Robert Huff, director of the Financial
Aid Office, said such a measure would "favor
Stanford" since Stanford students generally
"achieve more academically." He predicted
"one big fight" over the proposal between
institutions of higher learning across the
country.
"There is going to be a lot of opposition to
it," said Huff. He said he expected the issue to
become "a very significant equity issue nation
ally."
In his proposal, President Bush asks for a
22 percent increase in Pell grants and a 25
percent increase in Stafford guaranteed stu
dent loans. At the same time, he is requesting
a 26 percent cut to college work-study pro
grams and a 38 percent cut in supplemental
grants.
"This is an election year," said Thomas
Butts, Vice-President for University Relations
at the University of Michigan. Butts, who lob
bies for financial aid on behalf of the universi

ty, said he is therefore not surprised to see
"large increases proposed for highly visible
programs like Pell grants" while significant
cuts are called for in other programs in order
to pay for those increases.
Education Department statements, cited in
The Chronicle for Higher Education, estimate
that the number of grants given would be
reduced by 438,000. The reduction would
result from several changes in eligibility
requirements, including the academic perfor
mance criteria.
Ricci severely criticized the plan, saying "It
comes from this basic mentality, which seems
to be the Bush mentality, that you can't trust
students."
He characterized this mentality as a "con
servative fear that people are pulling the wool
over the eye of the honest American taxpayer."
"I question the motive behind it and I ques
tion the message it sends," he said.
The Bush plan does contain two tax breaks
that would benefit colleges and families. The
first encourages donations of tangible person
al property such as real estate to colleges by
making them tax-deductible.
The second is a deduction for interest on
loans to pay for education. Both deductions
were eliminated in 1986.
But the plan fails to restore a provision to
make Employer Education Assistance Bene
fits tax-exempt. These benefits include tuition
fees paid by an employer or by a university
grant, as well as tuition fee waivers granted by
a university.

In 1986, these benefits were made taxable.
Since then, Congress has reconsidered these
benefits annually and allocated funds to make
them tax-exempt. Bush signed the most
recent legislation last December, and it
expires in June.
"You cannot take it for granted [for Fiscal
Year 1992-93]," said Butts.
According to Ricci, this is "potentially an
even greater issue (than Pell grants) in terms
of effects on students."
The provisions are considered to be more
important for private universities like Stan
ford, where tuition fees are generally higher
than at state institutions.
House Bill HRI27, which is currently
before the House, calls for permanent tax
exempt status for these benefits. However,
Butts pointed out that the Budget Enforce
ment Act does not allow Congress to pass such
a bill unless funds to pay for it are made avail
able from other programs.
Butts said he believes "there are a number
of different ways" the Ways and Means Com
mittee could allocate the funds. "I am sure
they don't expect the students to find ways to
pay [for the benefits]," he said.
Another criticism Ricci levelled at the bud
get plan was that "the loan increase is greater
than the grant increase ... I'd rather see it the
other way around."
Ricci's group has campaigned for more
grants and fewer loans because "it doesn't
make any sense" for students to graduate "with
massive, massive, massive debt," he said.
