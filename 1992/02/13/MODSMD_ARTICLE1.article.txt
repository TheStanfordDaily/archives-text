# 'No confidence':
## Tuition hike irks student leaders 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Six ASSU leaders reacted
angrily to Tuesday's announce
ment that tuition will increase 9.5
percent next year during a meet
ing yesterday to discuss possible
responses to the decision.
Members of the Council of
Presidents, ASSU Senate and
Financial Aid Advocacy Office
attending the meeting expressed
concern about the cost increase.
"I think it's a terrible thing,"
said COP member Beth Morgan,
a junior. "It's very frustrating
that [the administration] would
choose to put in place such a large
increase," especially during a
recession, she said.
The Board of Trustees voted
Monday to approve the tuition
hike, as well as a 2.5 percent
increase in room-and-board
charges. The total cost for an
undergraduate attending Stan
ford will rise to $22,850 next year,
a 7.5 percent increase overall.
The students discussed how to
send a message of dissatisfaction
to the University administration,

resolving to write letters and per
haps circulate a petition express
ing a "no confidence" in the
tuition decision. They also dis
cussed holding town meetings or
rallies on the subject.

According to
COP member
John Overdeck,
the increase
brought the Uni
versity "back to
tuition free fall."
He said he
believes the Uni
versity didn't
expect students

to react strongly to the hike.
"They're doing this because
they see it as a painless" deficit
reduction, he said. "If they did
things to upset the faculty, the
faculty would be up in arms."
Vince Ricci, a director of the
Financial Aid Advocacy Office,
said he is concerned students will
not be able to afford the higher
price of a Stanford education.
"It's really bad timing right
now, with the recession going


Overdeck
on," he said.
University President Donald
Kennedy, addressing the ASSU
Senate meeting Tuesday night,
said the financial aid pool will
grow by about $2.5 million next
year.
But Ricci said there is no way
of knowing whether the addition
al aid will be enough to cover the
increased student demand. "I am
not convinced at all that financial
aid will grow to meet the need,"
he said.
Kennedy told the senate he
believes the increased aid "will be
adequate" to cover student needs.
Morgan complained that the
University had waited until the

tuition increase was approved by
the trustees before telling stu
dents how much the hike would
be. She said the University had
given the impression that the
tuition increase would not be sig
nificant.
"They were telling us it was
going to be a modest increase,"
she said. "Six percent above infla
tion is not modest."
For the past two years, Univer
sity officials have said they would
try to hold the tuition increase to
a rate of one percent above infla
tion.
But Provost James Rosse said
last month that the reluctance of
other universities to follow suit
and Stanford's $43 million oper
ating budget deficit forced the
University to rethink that com
mitment.
Overdeck also accused the Uni

at all that financial
aid will grow to
meet the need.'

versity of not pursuing other rev
enue-generating measures before
passing the tuition increase. He
cited 10,000 feet of currently
empty space under Tresidder
Union as one possible source of
revenue.
The space, if rented, could
make the University about
$100,000 a month, yielding about
$1 million over the course of a
school year, according to
Over deck.
