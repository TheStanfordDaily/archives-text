# 'No confidence':
## Tuition hike irks student leaders 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Six ASSU leaders reacted
angrily to Tuesday's announce
ment that tuition will increase 9.5
percent next year during a meet
ing yesterday to discuss possible
responses to the decision.
Members of the Council of
Presidents, ASSU Senate and
Financial Aid Advocacy Office
attending the meeting expressed
concern about the cost increase.
"I think it's a terrible thing,"
said COP member Beth Morgan,
a junior. "It's very frustrating
that [the administration] would
choose to put in place such a large
increase," especially during a
recession, she said.
The Board of Trustees voted
Monday to approve the tuition
hike, as well as a 2.5 percent
increase in room-and-board
charges. The total cost for an
undergraduate attending Stan
ford will rise to $22,850 next year,
a 7.5 percent increase overall.
The students discussed how to
send a message of dissatisfaction
to the University administration,

resolving to write letters and per
haps circulate a petition express
ing a "no confidence" in the
tuition decision. They also dis
cussed holding town meetings or
rallies on the subject.

According to
COP member
John Overdeck,
the increase
brought the Uni
versity "back to
tuition free fall."
He said he
believes the Uni
versity didn't
expect students

to react strongly to the hike.
"They're doing this because
they see it as a painless" deficit
reduction, he said. "If they did
things to upset the faculty, the
faculty would be up in arms."
Vince Ricci, a director of the
Financial Aid Advocacy Office,
said he is concerned students will
not be able to afford the higher
price of a Stanford education.
"It's really bad timing right
now, with the recession going
