A 73-year-old Palo Alto woman has confessed to
embezzling $48,000 from two day-care centers locat
ed on campus.
Alys Pearl Futtere pleaded guilty to one count of
grand theft and one count of tax and revenue eva
sion for embezzling funds while she worked in the
accounting and collecting departments at the Cali
fornia Community Children's Day Care Center and
another school which was operated by the City of
Palo Alto at Nixon Elementary School.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer, workers at the Nixon day-care center
reported an absence of $20,000 when Futtere was let
go last March.
"We made the case," said Niemeyer, but Futtere
has not been held accountable for her actions until
now because "the judicial system sometimes grinds
slowly."
Because of her age, Futtere — who was originally
charged with two counts of grand theft, two counts
of embezzlement and three counts of evading state
tax laws — will not go to jail.
"We're basically looking for restitution," said
Niemeyer.
At both centers, Futtere had been charging par
ents the standard day-care price but had been
depositing only a fraction of the proceeds in the day
care centers' accounts, according to the report.
Her scheme contrasts with other embezzle
ment plans in which exorbitant rates are charged
to the individual using an agency's services, so
that the individual is defrauded rather than the
agency.
Futtere could not be reached for comment yester
day. She is scheduled to be sentenced March 6.
