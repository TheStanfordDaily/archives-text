## Health care crucial 
### 
Cowell must introduce
fees instead of dropping
widely needed services

COMPARED WITH MOST
other major universities,
Stanford is very isolated. Stu
dents here don't regularly ride the
subway to the center of Boston, as
at Harvard; the majority of them
don't drive cars, as at a state school;
and they don't live in the middle of
a major city, as at Columbia.
That isolation is one of the rea
sons it is so imperative to maintain
quality student health care. When
faced with a health problem, stu
dents here have very little access
to off-campus medical help. With
out a comprehensive student
health facility, the level of medical
care at Stanford would drop pre
cipitously.
The budget cut enforced upon
Cowell Student Health Center
would create just that problem.
Faced v/ith a $600,000 budget
reduction target, Cowell has pro
posed cutting urgent-care hours,
cutting its aerobics program, cut
ting one nutritionist position and
imposing a $7 to $8 quarterly fee
on each student's bill.
That solution, unfortunately,
would eliminate the very things
that make Cowell a student health
center — it would destroy the ser
vices geared toward the 18-to-24-
year-olds Cowell is supposed to
consider before all else.
The loss of the nutritionist posi
tion would be particularly difficult
to bear. Under the proposal, Cow
ell would eliminate free one-on
one consultations with a clinical
nutritionist for students with eat
ing disorders or special diets.
Only one nutritionist would
remain, who would be responsible
for mainly public service and pro
motion — things that mean little
to an 18-year-old freshman who
thinks she may be anorexic and
needs help.

Cutting urgent-care hours
would also be detrimental to stu
dent life. According to Cowell's
budget plans, the center would be
open until only 8 p.m. weekdays
and 6 p.m. weekends.
Consider the ramifications of
that proposal. It's 8:15 p.m.
"Sally" is just returning from a
friend's house when she hits a bol
lard and is flung across the handle
bars of her bicycle, shattering two
teeth as she hits the concrete side
walk.
Sally has no recourse but to wait
in the emergency room at Stanford
Hospital for as much as three
hours. A week later — when Sally
gets the hospital's bill — the physi
cian's fee is $150 to $200, plus
another $750 for X-rays and tests.
If Cowell's urgent-care hours
were to remain, Sally could have
been seen immediately by a staffer,
with Cowell picking up the bill.
Aerobics is another example of
the student-oriented type of pro
gram that would be affected by the
proposed cuts. Lacking convenient
access to off-campus exercise
establishments, students must
have a centrally located program
that meets their energetic
demands.
Clearly, the services that Cowell
has proposed cutting cannot sim
ply be eliminated — they are. too
precious to students. But at the
same time, it would be simplistic to
insist on the status quo, in light of
the fact that Cowell has been sub
jected to a huge budget cut.
Instead of reducing key services,
Cowell should raise the quarterly
fee it is planning to charge stu
dents. A $10 fee, rather than the
$7 or $8 fee currently proposed,
should raise enough extra money
to save those programs that are
needed most by students.
Although it may set a dangerous
precedent in this time of budget
cutting — when University offices
are constantly offered the "easy"
way out of making difficult deci
sions by simply raising fees to stu
dents — the cuts proposed for
Cowell should be re-examined.
