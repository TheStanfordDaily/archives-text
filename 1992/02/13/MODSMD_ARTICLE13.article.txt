'Voluntary segregation 9 applies to white students as well

THE FEB. 10 ISSUE of The Daily
reported that I loover senior fellow
John Bunzel has published his
findings that the "majority of both black
and white students fat Stanford] thought
black students segregated themselves on
campus."
A black community leader is quoted
as saying black students' so-called volun
tary segregation is "necessary" rather
than "separatist."
Both the article and Bunzel's report
reflect a skewed understanding of the con
cept of "voluntary segregation" as if it is
something that only minority students do.
Apparently, this is what leads Bunzel

to ask white and black students alike only
about the behavior of black students.
I would argue that the notion that
white students do not engage in volun
tary segregation is untrue.
As a white student myself, I am cer
tain that there are at least as many
white students, percentage-wise, who
socialize primarily with other whites as
there are black students who socialize
primarily with other blacks.
The fact that white students may not
consciously feel that they are engaging
in "voluntary segregation" does not
mean that they aren't actually doing it.
Plainly speaking, the notion of "birds

of a feather" applies equally to all
groups, whether their "feathers" are
black or white, male or female, gay or
straight, young or old.
Students who are a visible minority
because of their race, sexual orientation,
disability, age, etc. may be more notice
able when they are together iri a group,
but they are not more likely to segregate
themselves voluntarily than are majority
groups.
To ask, as The Daily did, for black
students to explain their behavior while
leaving white students' behavior
unquestioned unfortunately perpetuates
a mentality of "us against them," insofar

as minority students are seen to have a
"different," anti-social way of relating,
while majority students are assumed to
be "normal" and socially integrated.
What black student leader Angela
Hilton is quoted as saying — "You are
more comfortable with your family" —
holds for all students.
I would love for our multicultural
community to recognize that we are all
members of many different families, and
that our time spent with any one of
them does not need to be explained or
defended, only appreciated.
