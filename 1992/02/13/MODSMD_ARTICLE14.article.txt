# Symptoms should not be mistaken for disease
## 
### 
Few at Stanford would hesitate to cen
sure the vulgar slurs made by law student
Keith Rabois several weeks ago at Otero.
However, an unfortunately large pro
portion of the community appears reluc
tant to criticize the broad range of mea
sures, both official and unofficial, levied
against him.
From the unusual steps taken by the
administration both in publicizing the
incident and in inviting the community to
punish Rabois, to the attempts of other
law students at Stanford to blacklist
Rabois in the state of California, some of
these measures appear a bit extreme.
Although these measures may appear
unjust to many, what is more disturbing
about them is their effect on the univer
sity community as a whole.
These measures promulgate a power
ful mentality of persecution in the com
munity, a mentality that does little to
address the underlying problem of
Rabois' comments — or for that matter,
of any offensive expression on campus.
The problem with Rabois' remarks

that vexes us all lies not in the remarks
themselves, but in the attitudes underly
ing them. These attitudes cannot be elim
inated by fiat, regardless of how strict a
speech code Stanford might endorse.
Nor can they be wiped out by a cam
pus-wide persecution that would frighten
the daylights out of anyone attempting to
give them more dispassionate expression.
They can only be challenged by an open
and rational debate in an atmosphere
that tolerates alternative opinions.
However irrational these attitudes may
be, they can never be seen as such by those
who hold them until they are discussed.
It is of central importance in issues of
offensive conduct not to mistake the
symptoms for the disease. We may
morally legislate against the symptoms,
but in doing so we only detract from
attempts to cure the disease.
