# Legislation prohibiting hate speech is useless
## 
### 
That sound of rushing water you
heard all last week was caused by Stan

ford people rising to the bait â€” the cruel
and offensive bait dangled in front of us
by Keith Rabois. He can hardly have
hoped for a greater response to his delib
erate provocation.
Far from having "harmed the often
articulately argued case against the
speech code" (Daily editorial, Feb. 10),
the whole sorry affair demonstrates the
futility of trying to legislate against
"hate speech" under the Fundamental
Standard.
It is not only that, in a laudable effort
to avoid the fate of similar regulations in
other universities struck down by the
courts under the First Amendment, the
framers of our statute drew it narrowly,
with the result that behavior like Mr.
Rabois' escapes its reach.
The difficulty is more deep-seated.
Since it sets the stage for adversarial
proceedings, the legislative approach
tends to divide and polarize rather than
promoting mutual tolerance.
Clearly it played a part in Rabois'
choice of confrontational tactics by pro
viding him with an exciting game to
play: "Beat the System." From his own
account, it was this incentive more than
rabid views on homosexuality that
moved him to act as he did.

He seems to feel that it's better,
somehow, to have uttered hateful and
hurtful sentiments without having
meant them, in itself a strange concep
tion of moral conduct.
It was a mistake to have imagined
that by invoking the campus equivalent
of the criminal sanction we could edu
cate people with the mindset and tem
perament of Mr. Rabois.
