## Miscegenation miscellany 
### 
Taboos around interracial
dating have always angered me.
The "dating game" shows, for
example, always put blacks with blacks
and whites with whites. These deep tra
ditions of separate dating pools smack of
the U.S.A.'s long racist history that
allowed anti-miscegenation laws as late
as 1967 — only three years before I was
born of a black mother and Jewish father.
I've also seen these taboos erupt in inci
dents like the murder of Yusuf Hawkins
a few years back.
At my high school — which was more
racially diverse than Stanford — interra
cial dating was common and even cele
brated. So frosh year when I heard that
students at Ujamaa had booed a Cosby
episode where one daughter goes on a date
with a white fellow, I became uncertain of
my place in the black community here.
This became especially true when I
later began going out with a white
woman. Later, as rumors, gossip and per
sonal stories reached me about the black
community's widespread condemnation
of dating outside the race, I resigned
myself to join the ranks of the "miscella
neous," as blacks of the core community
refer to those outside it.
Over the course of the last few years,
however, my views have changed as I've
studied, lived and really talked with other
black students who felt quite comfortable
with the community. Through these deep

and difficult discussions I began to better
understand other reasons why people
opposed interracial dating. I soon saw that
I had inherited a white standard of beauty
that permeates throughout society.
Perhaps the most obvious example of
these biases emerges in the media where
glorifications of "blond is beautiful" come
at the expense of all women, but especial
ly nappy haired, dark women. (Notice
the repeating shots of white female mod
els in various background advertise
ments in Spike Lee's "Jungle Fever").
I also began to see how my own dis
comfort in the black population was only
reinforced by a partner who was at least
as intimidated. I had few black friends
and she had fewer, so together we
remained isolated. We never went to par
ties thrown by blacks and I rarely partic
ipated in black community functions.
Finally, in dating a non-black student,
I lost the ability to explore the many bru
tal and beautiful complexities of what it
means to be black in America. At this for
mative stage in my life — especially
because I had few tight black friends
before college — it was crucial to me to
establish and maintain strong ties to
other black students.
For the most part all of these eye
opening discussions could only happen
with other black students. It was as if I
had been so multicultural and multiracial
for most of my life that I never focused on

'I saw that
I had inherited
a white
standard
of beauty
that permeates
society.'

who I was. I needed a mirror to see
myself a mirror composed of people
with similar experiences.
I've now found those peers and a place
in the black community. Ironically, I'm
an RA now in Uj and really love it — the
place I feared so frosh year. Still, I see
that we as a black community must
strike a balance between the values of the
group and a real respect for the choices of
individuals.
We must facilitate students learning
about the greater significance of their
personal acts but always respect their
decisions. We might introduce students
with a low level of literacy in issues of
race to ideas in less judgmental environ
ments and over time let them explore the
burning questions.
However it is done, only by being
inclusive of people on their own terms
and then encouraging them to think crit
ically about their own actions can we
hope to maintain a truly strong commu
nity.

a white theme house. His column appears
