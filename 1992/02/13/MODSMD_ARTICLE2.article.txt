# Compromise lowers insurance premiums
## Some employees: Rates still too high 
### Cecilia Tom Senior staff writer 
Single non-union University
employees will soon have to make
their first premium payments
toward their health plans, but at
a rate $10 to $15 lower than was
originally proposed.
Some employees, however, are
still not satisfied with the com
promise. Glenn Peacock, the
spokesman for Stanford Employ
ees for Equity, which sprang up in
response to the proposed premi
um charges, said that although
the reduction is significant the
structure is still inequitable.
"I guess I'll say it's certainly
an improvement, but the problem
that we had with the announce
ment in the first place ... is the
principle involved, and it seems
that the principle has not
changed," he said.
The changes proposed by
Human Resources last fall — a
payment of $25 to $31 per mdnth
for single employees and retirees

and reduced payments for mar
ried couples and employees with
dependents — were opposed by
single workers who claimed they
were being treated unfairly.
Single employees previously
were not charged for health bene
fits.
The outcry led Human Re
sources to establish a task force
within the new Employee Round
table to examine the University's
benefits rate structure. The
Roujidtable itself was created
partly in response to the benefits
debate.
Under the revised structure, sin
gle employees will have to pay $10
less than was proposed, while
retirees over 65 will pay $15 less.
Two-party and family coverage con
tributions will be reduced by the
same amount announced last fall.
About 6,000 employees will be
affected, according to Lori Lee of
the Human Resources' Benefits
Office.
