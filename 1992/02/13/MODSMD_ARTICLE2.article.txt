# Compromise lowers insurance premiums
## Some employees: Rates still too high 
### Cecilia Tom Senior staff writer 
Single non-union University
employees will soon have to make
their first premium payments
toward their health plans, but at
a rate $10 to $15 lower than was
originally proposed.
Some employees, however, are
still not satisfied with the com
promise. Glenn Peacock, the
spokesman for Stanford Employ
ees for Equity, which sprang up in
response to the proposed premi
um charges, said that although
the reduction is significant the
structure is still inequitable.
"I guess I'll say it's certainly
an improvement, but the problem
that we had with the announce
ment in the first place ... is the
principle involved, and it seems
that the principle has not
changed," he said.
The changes proposed by
Human Resources last fall — a
payment of $25 to $31 per mdnth
for single employees and retirees

and reduced payments for mar
ried couples and employees with
dependents — were opposed by
single workers who claimed they
were being treated unfairly.
Single employees previously
were not charged for health bene
fits.
The outcry led Human Re
sources to establish a task force
within the new Employee Round
table to examine the University's
benefits rate structure. The
Roujidtable itself was created
partly in response to the benefits
debate.
Under the revised structure, sin
gle employees will have to pay $10
less than was proposed, while
retirees over 65 will pay $15 less.
Two-party and family coverage con
tributions will be reduced by the
same amount announced last fall.
About 6,000 employees will be
affected, according to Lori Lee of
the Human Resources' Benefits
Office.
The revisions were recom
mended by the seven-member
Roundtable task force and
endorsed by Human Resources
and the Committee on Faculty
and Staff Benefits. The
Roundtable is a group of 25 Uni
versity staff members which con
sults with officials on human
resource issues.
Human Resources Benefits
Manager Jim Franklin said the
decision was made with input
from nine employee focus groups
that communicated with the
Roundtable task force.
He disagreed with the claim
that single employees will be sub
sidizing families. "Fairness is in
the eye of the beholder," he said.
The members of the focus
groups were randomly selected
from the campus and the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center,
but only 30 percent of those
selected attended meetings in
early January.
"I can't compel them to come,"
Franklin said. "It was our deter
mination that the people who
came were still representative of
the community as a whole."
Andrew Lisac, assistant dean
of Summer Session and Continu
ing Studies, praised the focus

group approach but criticized the
predetermined list of issues that
the groups had to discuss. He said
discussions should have been
more open.
Lisac helped create Stanford
Employees for Equity and is a
member of the Roundtable.
While the contributions by sin
gle employees are no longer nego
tiable for this year, the question of
whether health insurance should
be a responsibility of all employees
or an employment benefit is still
being debated. Currently, health
coverage is not a vested benefit for
Stanford employees.
When employee contributions
were first proposed, Vice Presi
dent of Human Resources Bar
bara Butterfield said they were
designed to raise consumers' cost
consciousness and create compe
tition among insurance providers.
Peacock said that in order to
increase consumer consciousness,
there need to be more choices
than the four or five plans cur
rently available to employees.
"The spread right now
between the cheapest plan and
the most expensive plan, I believe,
is $5 a month," he added.
"I think the cost-consciousness
has to come from Stanford," said
Kay Mahon, contract administra
tor for Research Administration
and a member of the Roundtable
task force. The question is
whether Stanford is shopping

around for the best deals, she said.
Mahon described the new
structure as a compromise among
the task force's seven members.
Human Resources put forth five
proposals, the focus groups sub
mitted more, and there was no
consensus, she said.
Because the task force was lim
ited to one issue, more fundamen
tal issues need to be addressed now
that the "stop-gap, temporary"
measure is in place, Mahon said.
"It's going to be a real mess.
None of the problems were really
addressed," he added.
Lisac said the University's
benefits pool and its accounting
should also be examined. The pool
pays for some "funny things," he
said, such as certain graduate fel
lowships and faculty release time.
"There may be a very good
rationale for that, (but) a lot of
administrators feel that the bene
fits pool needs to be studied," he
said.
Many gay employees have said
they are upset that the University
still does not have a policy for gay
staff members and their domestic
partners. Those employees, cur
rently ineligible for benefits
enjoyed by married couples, have
to pay health care premiums to
subsidize people with spouses and
families, Peacock said.
The new rate structure will not
affect the employees represented
by the United Stanford Workers.

ment in the first place ... is the
principle involved, and it seems
that the principle has not
changed," he said.
The changes proposed by
Human Resources last fall — a
payment of $25 to $31 per mdnth
for single employees and retirees

and reduced payments for mar
ried couples and employees with
dependents — were opposed by
single workers who claimed they
were being treated unfairly.
Single employees previously
were not charged for health bene
fits.
The outcry led Human Re
sources to establish a task force
within the new Employee Round
table to examine the University's
benefits rate structure. The
Roujidtable itself was created
partly in response to the benefits
debate.
Under the revised structure, sin
gle employees will have to pay $10
less than was proposed, while
retirees over 65 will pay $15 less.
Two-party and family coverage con
tributions will be reduced by the
same amount announced last fall.
About 6,000 employees will be
affected, according to Lori Lee of
the Human Resources' Benefits
Office.
The revisions were recom
mended by the seven-member
Roundtable task force and
endorsed by Human Resources
and the Committee on Faculty
and Staff Benefits. The
Roundtable is a group of 25 Uni
versity staff members which con
sults with officials on human
resource issues.

Manager Jim Franklin said the
decision was made with input
from nine employee focus groups
that communicated with the
Roundtable task force.
He disagreed with the claim
that single employees will be sub
sidizing families. "Fairness is in
the eye of the beholder," he said.
The members of the focus
groups were randomly selected
from the campus and the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center,
but only 30 percent of those
selected attended meetings in
early January.
"I can't compel them to come,"
Franklin said. "It was our deter
mination that the people who
came were still representative of
the community as a whole."
Andrew Lisac, assistant dean
of Summer Session and Continu
ing Studies, praised the focus

group approach but criticized the
predetermined list of issues that
the groups had to discuss. He said
discussions should have been
more open.
Lisac helped create Stanford
Employees for Equity and is a
member of the Roundtable.
While the contributions by sin
gle employees are no longer nego
tiable for this year, the question of
whether health insurance should
be a responsibility of all employees
or an employment benefit is still
being debated. Currently, health
coverage is not a vested benefit for
Stanford employees.
When employee contributions
were first proposed, Vice Presi
dent of Human Resources Bar
bara Butterfield said they were
designed to raise consumers' cost
consciousness and create compe
tition among insurance providers.
Peacock said that in order to
increase consumer consciousness,
there need to be more choices
than the four or five plans cur
rently available to employees.
"The spread right now
between the cheapest plan and
the most expensive plan, I believe,
is $5 a month," he added.
"I think the cost-consciousness
has to come from Stanford," said
Kay Mahon, contract administra
tor for Research Administration
and a member of the Roundtable
task force. The question is
whether Stanford is shopping

around for the best deals, she said.
Mahon described the new
structure as a compromise among
the task force's seven members.
Human Resources put forth five
proposals, the focus groups sub
mitted more, and there was no
consensus, she said.
Because the task force was lim
ited to one issue, more fundamen
tal issues need to be addressed now
that the "stop-gap, temporary"
measure is in place, Mahon said.
"It's going to be a real mess.
None of the problems were really
addressed," he added.
Lisac said the University's
benefits pool and its accounting
should also be examined. The pool
pays for some "funny things," he
said, such as certain graduate fel
lowships and faculty release time.
"There may be a very good
rationale for that, (but) a lot of
administrators feel that the bene
fits pool needs to be studied," he
said.
Many gay employees have said
they are upset that the University
still does not have a policy for gay
staff members and their domestic
partners. Those employees, cur
rently ineligible for benefits
enjoyed by married couples, have
to pay health care premiums to
subsidize people with spouses and
families, Peacock said.
The new rate structure will not
affect the employees represented
by the United Stanford Workers.
Single non-union University
employees will soon have to make
their first premium payments
toward their health plans, but at
a rate $10 to $15 lower than was
originally proposed.
Some employees, however, are
still not satisfied with the com
promise. Glenn Peacock, the
spokesman for Stanford Employ
ees for Equity, which sprang up in
response to the proposed premi
um charges, said that although
the reduction is significant the
structure is still inequitable.
"I guess I'll say it's certainly
an improvement, but the problem
that we had with the announce
ment in the first place ... is the
principle involved, and it seems
that the principle has not
changed," he said.
