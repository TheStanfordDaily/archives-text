## 'He hurt my soul': Woman shares trauma of acquaintance rape 
### 
The writer is a Stanford graduate stu
dent. She had this experience at her
undergraduate school, and was motivat
ed to write this piece after reading recent
published comments about date rape.
I HAD BEEN INVOLVED WITH L.
during my junior and senior years in
high school. We were fooling around
and everybody knew it. Freshman year
in college we were "together" a few
times, and it was the same routine as
before: kissing, petting, oral sex — but
no intercourse. Once L. had asked if I
would have sex with him, but I said
"no" and he did not push it.
One night he asked me to come over.
I went into his room. We talked, then
began messing around. Everything
seemed as usual. It was fun and we were
both enjoying it. After a while, he was
lying on top of me and we were kissing.
This was not unusual, as we had been in
this position before. But this time he
tried to put his penis inside of me. I said
I didn't want to and pushed him away.
He acted like that was OK and we
resumed where we left off. I figured that
maybe he thought we should have sex
because we were in college now, or some
thing crazy like that, but that it was all
right that I didn't want to. I was sur
prised when a while later he tried again,
in the same way — attempting to insert
his penis into me purely by maneuvering
our bodies, and without asking. He
missed and the head of his penis pushed
on my inner thigh. I said "no," and this
time he apologized.
We resumed touching each other. I
went down on him for a little while, and
then again we were kissing and touching
each other. I thought the "threat," so to
speak, was over. We had been in this sit
uation before. We weren't doing any
thing that was not already a part of our
acknowledged physical relationship. We

had never had sex before — why should
tonight be different? We had been
friends since elementary school, and I
thought that if I didn't want to, I was
"safe." It didn't occur to me that it
wasn't.
A little while later he tried again.
This time he didn't miss my vagina and
pushed himself inside me. The damage

had been done. He had gotten inside of
me and invaded my space. My spirit was
so broken that I disappeared. I wanted
to tell him "no" again, but he had
crushed my sense of self and my person
al boundaries.
I couldn't find the emotional strength
to tell him to get out of me. I had had
many romantic notions about "losing"
my virginity — and it had been taken
from me. He had done it. My insides
were no longer sacred because some
thing from the outside had contaminat
ed them and they were no longer mine.
He hurt my soul.
I instantly did not feel that my body
was mine. I was a receptacle, not a per
son. He was inside me. Me. But suddenly
it didn't feel like me anymore. It was
someone else. I would have made him
stop, but I was gone. I lost my sense of
personhood and my subjectivity.
I couldn't stop it. I mentally removed
myself from the situation and hoped he
would get it over with. I went into a
shell and envisioned that I was watching
it happen to someone else. I couldn't do
anything or get any bearings to make
him stop, so by pretending it wasn't me I

compensated to try and save myself. I
could only close my eyes and let him
move around until it was over. I hoped it
would be over quickly. Time stood still.
It seemed to go on endlessly. Once I even
tried to convince myself it was OK for
me and tried to respond. It was
useless. I pretended that I, the part of
me that was sacred, was somewhere else
and watching the whole thing happen to
a body that was distinct from it. Any
thing to deny what was happening to
me. I had no strength. I couldn't speak. I
couldn't stop him.
I slept fitfully for a few hours. Part of
me wanted to curl into a ball and pre
tend it didn't happen, but another part
of me needed some superficial display of
affection from him so that I could try to
convince myself that what had just hap
pened was OK, that I was not dirty, that
I was OK. I got nothing. The next morn
ing when I woke and saw the spot of
blood on the sheets I was very embar
rassed. I covered the spot so that he
would not see it until after I left.
Right now you may be thinking that I
am dumb, that I should have seen it
coming, that I should have left. The
truth of the matter is that even though
he had been sexually aggressive before,
intercourse was never part of our sexual
vocabulary together, so I honestly did
not think that he would ever force me to
do it. I thought the night would go in a
similar fashion as the many nights
before. I trusted him, and I shouldn't
have. I was transformed into a victim of
someone else's insensitivities and physi
cal needs.
When I got home to my dorm, I felt
uncomfortable — and it was just the
beginning of many disturbing, painful
years.
The most awkward part of the inter
nalization of the experience was when I
returned home after my freshman year.

Everybody wanted to know who had
"done it" their first year away, and since
technically I had, I had to tell. I concoct
ed a story pretending I wanted it to hap
pen because I was too embarrassed to
tell my friends the truth. Suddenly, I
was an accomplice—and they thought I
was happy about it.
I told my mother exactly what I told
my friends. Sex was something we had
discussed relatively openly for a few
years and I thought she should know. I
wanted to tell my mother I was not
totally comfortable with what had hap
pened, but I couldn't. It became my
secret.
I ended up protecting him. Because I
was embarrassed that I had not been in
control, I did not tell what L. did to me.
I started seeing another man a few
months later, and because I had lost
respect for my own body space, I let him
have sex with me just because he wanted
to. I did not care. Anything I had thought
should be special about sex was stolen
from me. I was just a receptacle for some
body else's desire and fulfillment.
We had sex regularly for a while, but
I never enjoyed it or actively participat
ed. I never had an orgasm and did not
even believe sex was something that
could be enjoyed by a woman. It was
something I did for him because I sup
posedly loved him. He wanted to have
sex and coming inside me made him
happy.
After eventually telling this second
man what had happened with L., I went
to therapy specifically to deal with my
body image. That was the beginning of a
long and difficult road of rebuilding my
respect for myself and my body. Only
now, five years later, am I able to have
sex with my current boyfriend and be an
active participant instead of a passive
"observer" and not feel afterwards
either violated or as if I had done some-

In the best of possible
worlds, my story will
inspire a man ... to take a
minute and just ask the
woman what she wants. 1

one else a favor.
L. does not know the pain he has
caused me. He told a mutual friend he
was "so happy" that I had lost my vir
ginity to him. I saw him a few years
later and we talked like old "friends"
about our childhood together.
For some reason, even then, I did not
have the ability to say, "But wait. If you
had taken the time to say, 'I'd really like
to make love to you, would you like to?'
rather than sticking your penis inside of
me when I was trusting you, I never
would have lost my virginity to you in
the first place."
My intention is not to spark debate
among students over whether or not it
was my fault (for not getting out of bed
the first time he tried to enter me, etc.)
or whether or not I was raped, as I don't
think this is the issue.
In the best of possible worlds, my
story will inspire a man who may think
that actions are as comprehensible as
words in all situations to take a minute
and just ask the woman what she wants.
The few seconds it takes to ask is noth
ing in comparison to the aftermath,
especially if she confronts the issue.
If you consider her to be a friend,
think of what a friend means. A friend
ship is the interaction of two people.
What I have told you in this short space
cannot compare to how much I have suf
fered for not knowing that L. and I real
ly weren't friends, and for losing the
ability to speak and be heard.

am dumb, that I should have seen it
coming, that I should have left. The
truth of the matter is that even though
he had been sexually aggressive before,
intercourse was never part of our sexual
vocabulary together, so I honestly did
not think that he would ever force me to
do it. I thought the night would go in a
similar fashion as the many nights
before. I trusted him, and I shouldn't
have. I was transformed into a victim of
someone else's insensitivities and physi
cal needs.
When I got home to my dorm, I felt
uncomfortable — and it was just the
beginning of many disturbing, painful
years.
The most awkward part of the inter
nalization of the experience was when I
returned home after my freshman year.

Everybody wanted to know who had
"done it" their first year away, and since
technically I had, I had to tell. I concoct
ed a story pretending I wanted it to hap
pen because I was too embarrassed to
tell my friends the truth. Suddenly, I
was an accomplice—and they thought I
was happy about it.
I told my mother exactly what I told
my friends. Sex was something we had
discussed relatively openly for a few
years and I thought she should know. I
wanted to tell my mother I was not
totally comfortable with what had hap
pened, but I couldn't. It became my
secret.
I ended up protecting him. Because I
was embarrassed that I had not been in
control, I did not tell what L. did to me.
I started seeing another man a few
months later, and because I had lost
respect for my own body space, I let him
have sex with me just because he wanted
to. I did not care. Anything I had thought
should be special about sex was stolen
from me. I was just a receptacle for some
body else's desire and fulfillment.
We had sex regularly for a while, but
I never enjoyed it or actively participat
ed. I never had an orgasm and did not
even believe sex was something that
could be enjoyed by a woman. It was
something I did for him because I sup
posedly loved him. He wanted to have
sex and coming inside me made him
happy.
After eventually telling this second
man what had happened with L., I went
to therapy specifically to deal with my
body image. That was the beginning of a
long and difficult road of rebuilding my
respect for myself and my body. Only
now, five years later, am I able to have
sex with my current boyfriend and be an
active participant instead of a passive
"observer" and not feel afterwards
either violated or as if I had done some-

In the best of possible
worlds, my story will
inspire a man ... to take a
minute and just ask the
woman what she wants. 1

one else a favor.
L. does not know the pain he has
caused me. He told a mutual friend he
was "so happy" that I had lost my vir
ginity to him. I saw him a few years
later and we talked like old "friends"
about our childhood together.
For some reason, even then, I did not
have the ability to say, "But wait. If you
had taken the time to say, 'I'd really like
to make love to you, would you like to?'
rather than sticking your penis inside of
me when I was trusting you, I never
would have lost my virginity to you in
the first place."
My intention is not to spark debate
among students over whether or not it
was my fault (for not getting out of bed
the first time he tried to enter me, etc.)
or whether or not I was raped, as I don't
think this is the issue.
In the best of possible worlds, my
story will inspire a man who may think
that actions are as comprehensible as
words in all situations to take a minute
and just ask the woman what she wants.
The few seconds it takes to ask is noth
ing in comparison to the aftermath,
especially if she confronts the issue.
If you consider her to be a friend,
think of what a friend means. A friend
ship is the interaction of two people.
What I have told you in this short space
cannot compare to how much I have suf
fered for not knowing that L. and I real
ly weren't friends, and for losing the
ability to speak and be heard.

I HAD BEEN INVOLVED WITH L.
during my junior and senior years in
high school. We were fooling around
and everybody knew it. Freshman year
in college we were "together" a few
times, and it was the same routine as
before: kissing, petting, oral sex — but
no intercourse. Once L. had asked if I
would have sex with him, but I said
"no" and he did not push it.
One night he asked me to come over.
I went into his room. We talked, then
began messing around. Everything
seemed as usual. It was fun and we were
both enjoying it. After a while, he was
lying on top of me and we were kissing.
This was not unusual, as we had been in
this position before. But this time he
tried to put his penis inside of me. I said
I didn't want to and pushed him away.
He acted like that was OK and we
resumed where we left off. I figured that
maybe he thought we should have sex
because we were in college now, or some
thing crazy like that, but that it was all
right that I didn't want to. I was sur
prised when a while later he tried again,
in the same way — attempting to insert
his penis into me purely by maneuvering
our bodies, and without asking. He
missed and the head of his penis pushed
on my inner thigh. I said "no," and this
time he apologized.
We resumed touching each other. I
went down on him for a little while, and
then again we were kissing and touching
each other. I thought the "threat," so to
speak, was over. We had been in this sit
uation before. We weren't doing any
thing that was not already a part of our
acknowledged physical relationship. We

had never had sex before — why should
tonight be different? We had been
friends since elementary school, and I
thought that if I didn't want to, I was
"safe." It didn't occur to me that it
wasn't.
A little while later he tried again.
This time he didn't miss my vagina and
pushed himself inside me. The damage

had been done. He had gotten inside of
me and invaded my space. My spirit was
so broken that I disappeared. I wanted
to tell him "no" again, but he had
crushed my sense of self and my person
al boundaries.
I couldn't find the emotional strength
to tell him to get out of me. I had had
many romantic notions about "losing"
my virginity — and it had been taken
from me. He had done it. My insides
were no longer sacred because some
thing from the outside had contaminat
ed them and they were no longer mine.
He hurt my soul.
I instantly did not feel that my body
was mine. I was a receptacle, not a per
son. He was inside me. Me. But suddenly
it didn't feel like me anymore. It was
someone else. I would have made him
stop, but I was gone. I lost my sense of
personhood and my subjectivity.
I couldn't stop it. I mentally removed
myself from the situation and hoped he
would get it over with. I went into a
shell and envisioned that I was watching
it happen to someone else. I couldn't do
anything or get any bearings to make
him stop, so by pretending it wasn't me I

compensated to try and save myself. I
could only close my eyes and let him
move around until it was over. I hoped it
would be over quickly. Time stood still.
It seemed to go on endlessly. Once I even
tried to convince myself it was OK for
me and tried to respond. It was
useless. I pretended that I, the part of
me that was sacred, was somewhere else
and watching the whole thing happen to
a body that was distinct from it. Any
thing to deny what was happening to
me. I had no strength. I couldn't speak. I
couldn't stop him.
I slept fitfully for a few hours. Part of
me wanted to curl into a ball and pre
tend it didn't happen, but another part
of me needed some superficial display of
affection from him so that I could try to
convince myself that what had just hap
pened was OK, that I was not dirty, that
I was OK. I got nothing. The next morn
ing when I woke and saw the spot of
blood on the sheets I was very embar
rassed. I covered the spot so that he
would not see it until after I left.
Right now you may be thinking that I
am dumb, that I should have seen it
coming, that I should have left. The

no intercourse. Once L. had asked if I
would have sex with him, but I said
"no" and he did not push it.
One night he asked me to come over.
I went into his room. We talked, then
began messing around. Everything
seemed as usual. It was fun and we were
both enjoying it. After a while, he was
lying on top of me and we were kissing.
This was not unusual, as we had been in
this position before. But this time he
tried to put his penis inside of me. I said
I didn't want to and pushed him away.
He acted like that was OK and we
resumed where we left off. I figured that
maybe he thought we should have sex
because we were in college now, or some
thing crazy like that, but that it was all
right that I didn't want to. I was sur
prised when a while later he tried again,
in the same way — attempting to insert
his penis into me purely by maneuvering
our bodies, and without asking. He
missed and the head of his penis pushed
on my inner thigh. I said "no," and this
time he apologized.
We resumed touching each other. I
went down on him for a little while, and
then again we were kissing and touching
each other. I thought the "threat," so to
speak, was over. We had been in this sit
uation before. We weren't doing any
thing that was not already a part of our
acknowledged physical relationship. We

had never had sex before — why should
tonight be different? We had been
friends since elementary school, and I
thought that if I didn't want to, I was
"safe." It didn't occur to me that it
wasn't.
A little while later he tried again.
This time he didn't miss my vagina and
pushed himself inside me. The damage

had been done. He had gotten inside of
me and invaded my space. My spirit was
so broken that I disappeared. I wanted
to tell him "no" again, but he had
crushed my sense of self and my person
al boundaries.
I couldn't find the emotional strength
to tell him to get out of me. I had had
many romantic notions about "losing"
my virginity — and it had been taken
from me. He had done it. My insides
were no longer sacred because some
thing from the outside had contaminat
ed them and they were no longer mine.
He hurt my soul.
I instantly did not feel that my body
was mine. I was a receptacle, not a per
son. He was inside me. Me. But suddenly
it didn't feel like me anymore. It was
someone else. I would have made him
stop, but I was gone. I lost my sense of
personhood and my subjectivity.
I couldn't stop it. I mentally removed
myself from the situation and hoped he
would get it over with. I went into a
shell and envisioned that I was watching
it happen to someone else. I couldn't do
anything or get any bearings to make
him stop, so by pretending it wasn't me I

compensated to try and save myself. I
could only close my eyes and let him
move around until it was over. I hoped it
would be over quickly. Time stood still.
It seemed to go on endlessly. Once I even
tried to convince myself it was OK for
me and tried to respond. It was
useless. I pretended that I, the part of
me that was sacred, was somewhere else
and watching the whole thing happen to
a body that was distinct from it. Any
thing to deny what was happening to
me. I had no strength. I couldn't speak. I
couldn't stop him.
I slept fitfully for a few hours. Part of
me wanted to curl into a ball and pre
tend it didn't happen, but another part
of me needed some superficial display of
affection from him so that I could try to
convince myself that what had just hap
pened was OK, that I was not dirty, that
I was OK. I got nothing. The next morn
ing when I woke and saw the spot of
blood on the sheets I was very embar
rassed. I covered the spot so that he
would not see it until after I left.
Right now you may be thinking that I
am dumb, that I should have seen it
coming, that I should have left. The
truth of the matter is that even though
he had been sexually aggressive before,
intercourse was never part of our sexual
vocabulary together, so I honestly did
not think that he would ever force me to
do it. I thought the night would go in a
similar fashion as the many nights
before. I trusted him, and I shouldn't
have. I was transformed into a victim of
someone else's insensitivities and physi
cal needs.
When I got home to my dorm, I felt
uncomfortable — and it was just the
beginning of many disturbing, painful
years.
The most awkward part of the inter
nalization of the experience was when I
returned home after my freshman year.

Everybody wanted to know who had
"done it" their first year away, and since
technically I had, I had to tell. I concoct
ed a story pretending I wanted it to hap
pen because I was too embarrassed to
tell my friends the truth. Suddenly, I
was an accomplice—and they thought I
was happy about it.
I told my mother exactly what I told
my friends. Sex was something we had
discussed relatively openly for a few
years and I thought she should know. I
wanted to tell my mother I was not
totally comfortable with what had hap
pened, but I couldn't. It became my
secret.
I ended up protecting him. Because I
was embarrassed that I had not been in
control, I did not tell what L. did to me.
I started seeing another man a few
months later, and because I had lost
respect for my own body space, I let him
have sex with me just because he wanted
to. I did not care. Anything I had thought
should be special about sex was stolen
from me. I was just a receptacle for some
body else's desire and fulfillment.
We had sex regularly for a while, but
I never enjoyed it or actively participat
ed. I never had an orgasm and did not
even believe sex was something that
could be enjoyed by a woman. It was
something I did for him because I sup
posedly loved him. He wanted to have
sex and coming inside me made him
happy.
After eventually telling this second
man what had happened with L., I went
to therapy specifically to deal with my
body image. That was the beginning of a
long and difficult road of rebuilding my
respect for myself and my body. Only
now, five years later, am I able to have
sex with my current boyfriend and be an
active participant instead of a passive
"observer" and not feel afterwards
either violated or as if I had done some-

In the best of possible
worlds, my story will
inspire a man ... to take a
minute and just ask the
woman what she wants. 1

one else a favor.
L. does not know the pain he has
caused me. He told a mutual friend he
was "so happy" that I had lost my vir
ginity to him. I saw him a few years
later and we talked like old "friends"
about our childhood together.
For some reason, even then, I did not
have the ability to say, "But wait. If you
had taken the time to say, 'I'd really like
to make love to you, would you like to?'
rather than sticking your penis inside of
me when I was trusting you, I never
would have lost my virginity to you in
the first place."
My intention is not to spark debate
among students over whether or not it
was my fault (for not getting out of bed
the first time he tried to enter me, etc.)
or whether or not I was raped, as I don't
think this is the issue.
In the best of possible worlds, my
story will inspire a man who may think
that actions are as comprehensible as
words in all situations to take a minute
and just ask the woman what she wants.
The few seconds it takes to ask is noth
ing in comparison to the aftermath,
especially if she confronts the issue.
If you consider her to be a friend,
think of what a friend means. A friend
ship is the interaction of two people.
What I have told you in this short space
cannot compare to how much I have suf
fered for not knowing that L. and I real
ly weren't friends, and for losing the
ability to speak and be heard.
