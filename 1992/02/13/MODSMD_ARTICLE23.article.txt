## Sepeda, Adams serve up no-hitter No-no over UOP third in Stanford baseball history 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
This game wasn't supposed to
be that big of a deal. With the
threatening skies all week, it was
in doubt whether Stanford's base
ball game against University of
the Pacific would even be played.
However, the day dawned bright
and the game did take place. But
it was just going to be a minimal
ly challenging game, used by the
Cardinal to gear up for the series
this weekend against Pepperdine.
They weren't supposed to go
out there and make history.
But that is exactly what hap
pened. The day did indeed dawn
bright on the Cardinal, and Stan
ford hurlers Jamie Sepeda and
Willie Adams, in a 6-0 win, com
bined for Stanford's first no-hitter
since Paul Grame did it in 1981.
Sepeda went the first six innings,
and Adams went the final three to
produce only the third no-no in
Stanford baseball history.
"Obviously they pitched
great," said head coach Mark
Marquess. "They had great stuff.
Jamie had a live fastball, he
always has a good change, and his
curve was working. And Willie

had a great fastball and an out
standing curve."
Sepeda, in his third start for
the Cardinal this season, had
seeming mastery over his pitches,
allowing only one ball out of the
infield in his six inning stint.
Sepeda was systematically mow
ing Tiger hitters down, at one
point retiring eleven batters in a
row. So, needless to say, when
Adams came out to start the sev
enth, nearly all of the meager 123
in attendance did a double take.
Jamie out? And he's allowed no
hits?
It seems that Sepeda's pitch
count had reached over 100, quite
a large number of pitches for an
arm to deliver this early in the
season. And with Marquess need
ing a fresh and fully rested Sepeda
to pitch against Pepperdine on
Monday, he decided to call it a day
for the junior right-hander.
"I wanted to stay in for the no
hitter's sake," said Sepeda "but I
realized that it was better for the
team if I came out, and got ready
for the weekend series."
Enter Willie Adams. Big num
ber 40 took the mound in the top
of the seventh stanza, encouraged
half-jokingly by Sepeda "not to

mess up." And he didn't disap
point.
"Jamie pitched six strong
innings, and since I knew I'd only
be pitching three, I just wanted to
go out and go full bore," said
Adams.
So he struck out the side in the
seventh. And he struck out the
side in the eighth. Six up, six
down, six K's, just like that. Then
came the nerve wracking ninth.
"I was a little nervous lin the
ninth]," said Adams. "I was only
throwing a fastball and a curve
today, so I was only going to get
beat by my best pitches."
In the top of the ninth, the
psyched-up Adams finally threw a
curve that didn't, and the first
batter was on base after getting
hit. Next batter, ground out to
pitcher. Next batter, same thing.
Finally, the potential third out
strode to the plate in the person of
pinch hitter Eddie Mylett, the
Tigers regular center fielder who
was not playing for health rea
sons.
Mylett was hitting .647 for the
seven-game season, and assuredly
was sent in to break up the no-hit
ter. However, after driving the
count full and fouling off four

straight pitches, Mylett let one go
by on the inside of the plate.
Strike three.
"[After Adams' first two starts}
he hadn't hit stride, but today he
pitched like the Willie we know,"
said Marquess.
Adams did look shaky and very
hittable in his first two starts.
Last Sunday against Fullerton,
junior college transfer Rick
Helling started in Adams' place,
and made a statement that he
belonged in the starting rotation.
So did Willie have something to
prove when he was called on to
pitch yesterday?
"Oh definitely," said Adams.
On the offensive side, the Car
dinal also performed extremely
well. Marquess tried a new line
up, moving Jeff Hammonds back
to the lead-off spot where he
achieved All-American status two
years ago as a freshman. Fresh
man designated hitter Dusty
Allen, who continues to impress,
hit in the third spot. The big
right-handed hitter ended up
going 3-4 on the day, with a dou
ble and a RBI.
"[Dusty) definitely doesn't play
like a freshman," said Marquess.
"He responds well wherever we

put him [in the lineup)."
Also with big games at the plate
were seniors Dave Cornell, David
Holbrook, Steve Solomon, and
Tony Detter, whose double in the
second inning scored two runs.
But the day ultimately belonged
to Sepeda and Adams, who, in
making a statement for Cardinal
baseball, carved themselves out a
niche in Stanford sports history.

Stanford baseball history.
"Obviously they pitched
great," said head coach Mark
Marquess. "They had great stuff.
Jamie had a live fastball, he
always has a good change, and his
curve was working. And Willie

had a great fastball and an out
standing curve."
Sepeda, in his third start for
the Cardinal this season, had
seeming mastery over his pitches,
allowing only one ball out of the
infield in his six inning stint.
Sepeda was systematically mow
ing Tiger hitters down, at one
point retiring eleven batters in a
row. So, needless to say, when
Adams came out to start the sev
enth, nearly all of the meager 123
in attendance did a double take.
Jamie out? And he's allowed no
hits?
It seems that Sepeda's pitch
count had reached over 100, quite
a large number of pitches for an
arm to deliver this early in the
season. And with Marquess need
ing a fresh and fully rested Sepeda
to pitch against Pepperdine on
Monday, he decided to call it a day
for the junior right-hander.
"I wanted to stay in for the no
hitter's sake," said Sepeda "but I
realized that it was better for the
team if I came out, and got ready
for the weekend series."
Enter Willie Adams. Big num
ber 40 took the mound in the top
of the seventh stanza, encouraged
half-jokingly by Sepeda "not to

mess up." And he didn't disap
point.
"Jamie pitched six strong
innings, and since I knew I'd only
be pitching three, I just wanted to
go out and go full bore," said
Adams.
So he struck out the side in the
seventh. And he struck out the
side in the eighth. Six up, six
down, six K's, just like that. Then
came the nerve wracking ninth.
"I was a little nervous lin the
ninth]," said Adams. "I was only
throwing a fastball and a curve
today, so I was only going to get
beat by my best pitches."
In the top of the ninth, the
psyched-up Adams finally threw a
curve that didn't, and the first
batter was on base after getting
hit. Next batter, ground out to
pitcher. Next batter, same thing.
Finally, the potential third out
strode to the plate in the person of
pinch hitter Eddie Mylett, the
Tigers regular center fielder who
was not playing for health rea
sons.
Mylett was hitting .647 for the
seven-game season, and assuredly
was sent in to break up the no-hit
ter. However, after driving the
count full and fouling off four

straight pitches, Mylett let one go
by on the inside of the plate.
Strike three.
"[After Adams' first two starts}
he hadn't hit stride, but today he
pitched like the Willie we know,"
said Marquess.
Adams did look shaky and very
hittable in his first two starts.
Last Sunday against Fullerton,
junior college transfer Rick
Helling started in Adams' place,
and made a statement that he
belonged in the starting rotation.
So did Willie have something to
prove when he was called on to
pitch yesterday?
"Oh definitely," said Adams.
On the offensive side, the Car
dinal also performed extremely
well. Marquess tried a new line
up, moving Jeff Hammonds back
to the lead-off spot where he
achieved All-American status two
years ago as a freshman. Fresh
man designated hitter Dusty
Allen, who continues to impress,
hit in the third spot. The big
right-handed hitter ended up
going 3-4 on the day, with a dou
ble and a RBI.
"[Dusty) definitely doesn't play
like a freshman," said Marquess.
"He responds well wherever we

put him [in the lineup)."
Also with big games at the plate
were seniors Dave Cornell, David
Holbrook, Steve Solomon, and
Tony Detter, whose double in the
second inning scored two runs.
But the day ultimately belonged
to Sepeda and Adams, who, in
making a statement for Cardinal
baseball, carved themselves out a
niche in Stanford sports history.

(I to r)Jamie Sepeda and Willie Adams. The two hurlers combined in
an overpowering performance yesterday, giving up three walks, 13
K's, and no hits in Stanford's 6-0 win over UOP.
This game wasn't supposed to
be that big of a deal. With the
threatening skies all week, it was
in doubt whether Stanford's base
ball game against University of
the Pacific would even be played.
However, the day dawned bright
and the game did take place. But
it was just going to be a minimal
ly challenging game, used by the
Cardinal to gear up for the series
this weekend against Pepperdine.
They weren't supposed to go
out there and make history.
But that is exactly what hap
pened. The day did indeed dawn
bright on the Cardinal, and Stan
ford hurlers Jamie Sepeda and
Willie Adams, in a 6-0 win, com
bined for Stanford's first no-hitter
since Paul Grame did it in 1981.
Sepeda went the first six innings,
and Adams went the final three to
