# The 						crisis in high-profile athletics: a new look
## 
### 
Has it struck anyone else that the
immediate response of our communi
ty to Keith Rabois' antics and that of
the national sports media to the Mike
Tyson verdict were remarkably simi
lar? Both were as shallow as they
were short-sighted.
On the Farm, after the initial hyste
ria finally subsided, a number of indi
viduals thoughtfully commented on
what the incident meant to the com
munity and how things could be
changed for the better. Likewise, while
knee-jerk condemnations of Tyson are
(given the present facts) appropriate,
his tribulations relate to a more basic
crisis in high-profile athletics — one
that could be changed for the better.
In short, what most analyses of
the Tyson saga have failed to recog
nize is that his mischievous actions
and subsequent conviction are not an
end in themselves, but rather symp
toms of a larger problem which
afflicts our athletic society as a
whole. That is, too many young ath
letes are ill-prepared to deal with the
heavy burdens of stardom.

Boxing promoter Bob Arum stum
bled upon a succinct description of this
crisis. Like many sports figures who
have fame thrust upon them before
they are forced to accept the responsi
bilities of adulthood, Mike Tyson, he
said, "was a kid led to believe he could
get away with anything."
He was led to believe he could get
away with anything. Haven't we
heard this type of utterance before?
It sounds remarkably akin to Barry
Switzer's description of his former
drug kingpin/quarterback Charles
Thompson, whose narcotics arrest
was the straw that broke the back of
the ex-Oklahoma football coach's

troubled regime.
Indeed, the "I'm above the law"
notion could just as aptly describe
rape allegation controversies which
have in the past marred the Colorado
football program, Minnesota's bas
ketball program and, most recently,
Todd Day and his three Arkansas bas
ketball teammates. The illegal calling
card accounts at UNLV, the gunshots
outside of Oklahoma dormitories, the
drug charges levied at collegiate ath
letes everywhere, the academic sus
pensions because a player "just didn't
have time to go to class" . .. sadly,
many kids do in fact believe they can
get away with anything.
Of course, it would be easy to sit
here, high upon the shoulders of the
Stanford "quintessential student
athlete" statue, and chastise the aca
demically-(dis)oriented athletic pro
grams of other universities for turn
ing their heads from such problems,
but such is not the intent.
The intent is to suggest that while
Tyson, Thompson and Day certainly
should be held responsible for their

actions, there are presently too many
factors reinforcing their belief that
they are beyond the reach of the law.
When we look at Tyson (who began
his run to the heavyweight title at
age 18) we see coddling by promoters
and millionaire casino owners, mis
demeanor charges and lawsuits dealt
with under the table, and boxing
experts giving him divine status.
These factors may appear extreme
and peculiar to Tyson's situation.
But on college campuses, athletic
dormitories, often-shady perks from
alumni, and questionable academic
schedules have the same effect.
Just last week, UNLV star Elmore
Spencer told Sports Illustrated that
while at Georgia he was shown a list
of faculty who were "sympathetic to
athletes" and a list of those who were
not. It would be illogical to assume
that Georgia is alone in this practice.
Recently an NBA coach laughed that
his player took a "pay cut" when he
jumped from the collegiate ranks to


Kevin
Jeffery
the pros. It was, to be sure, just a
joke, but the frequency with
which such "jokes" are thrown
about leads one to believe there is
at least a shred of substance
behind them.
None of these improprieties
are the fault of young athletes, yet
all of them have harmful effects,
and all of them should be elimi

nated. And it is feasible that ath
letic dorms, overly ambitious
alumni, and the like can be elimi
nated or controlled. But to do so
we must de-emphasize — or at
least put into proper perspective
— the athletic achievements of
young adults.
No one is saying that turning
the spotlight away from young
superstars will be easy; at the
same time that we recognize their
superstar status, however, we
must also recognize their youth.
If we as spectators or media stress

that "this athletic phenom" still
has a lot of maturing to do, maybe
the phenom himself will realize
the same.
If we don't want young,
impressionable athletes to feel
like they are "above the law," we
must take pains to keep from
putting them there.

Kevin Jeff cry yearns to see the day
when athletes are remembered
more for their immortal actions
on the field than their immoral
actions off it.
