Roaring through their No. 4, 5 and 6 singles
matches, Jason Yee, Vimal Patel and Billy Wright
led the men's tennis team in straight sets to a 7-2
victory over San Jose State yesterday afternoon.
"I started with a lead from the rain delay (on
Tuesday) but I was slow starting off today," said
Yee. He wrapped up the match quickly though,
walking off the court second with scores of 6-3, 6-2.
Patel was the first player off the court, dropping
only two games in his 6-1,6-1 romping. Wright soon
followed Patel and Yee with a solid 6-1, 6-4 victory.
Most matches began Tuesday but were quickly
delayed when rain made the courts slick. The
inclement weather of the past few days seemed to
affect most of the players. "It is just not the same
practicing inside," said head coach Dick Gould.
Robert Devens, who also won his third singles
match in straight sets, agreed: "We haven't played out
side much. It took awhile for everyone to get used to."
Alex O'Brien and Chris Cocotos lost their first
and second singles matches 6-2, 6-4 and 7-5, 6-7, 6-
3, respectively. Cocotos, however, came back to win
at first doubles with Devens. This was the pair's
first doubles win.
Having never played together,
Patel and Yee teamed up to
trounce the Spartans' second dou
bles team, 6-0, 6-4.
"We started well, but in the
second set they played better and
we had to concentrate more," Yee
said. "Vimal started serving and
returning really well at the end."
Juniors Roman Sydorak and
Ken Pedroza played a steady

match at third doubles to round
out the Cardinal victory. "We
didn't play great, just consistent
ly," said Pedroza. "We volleyed
pretty well and 'The Monster' was
working pretty well."
"The Monster" is a doubles
serving tactic. The server lines up
close to the middle of the baseline
and the net person squats down in
the center of the court. This con
fuses the opposing player because
he doesn't know to which side to
return the ball.
"When you need a point here
or there and the other team is

returning cross-court well, it real
ly throws them off," Pedroza
explained.
Pedroza and Sydorak have
played doubles together since
meeting at Stanford three years
ago. They played tournaments
together this summer and cur
rently live in the same house.
"I know his reactions as well as
my own," Pedroza said. Sydorak
attributes this to time spent on
the court together: "When you
practice at least three times a
week together you get to know a
person's habits."
