Roaring through their No. 4, 5 and 6 singles
matches, Jason Yee, Vimal Patel and Billy Wright
led the men's tennis team in straight sets to a 7-2
victory over San Jose State yesterday afternoon.
"I started with a lead from the rain delay (on
Tuesday) but I was slow starting off today," said
Yee. He wrapped up the match quickly though,
walking off the court second with scores of 6-3, 6-2.
Patel was the first player off the court, dropping
only two games in his 6-1,6-1 romping. Wright soon
followed Patel and Yee with a solid 6-1, 6-4 victory.
Most matches began Tuesday but were quickly
delayed when rain made the courts slick. The
inclement weather of the past few days seemed to
affect most of the players. "It is just not the same
practicing inside," said head coach Dick Gould.
Robert Devens, who also won his third singles
match in straight sets, agreed: "We haven't played out
side much. It took awhile for everyone to get used to."
Alex O'Brien and Chris Cocotos lost their first
and second singles matches 6-2, 6-4 and 7-5, 6-7, 6-
3, respectively. Cocotos, however, came back to win
at first doubles with Devens. This was the pair's
first doubles win.
