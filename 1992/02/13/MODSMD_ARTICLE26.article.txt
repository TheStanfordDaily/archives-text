# Less is more: Poruri finds success with one-handed backhand
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Gabriela Sabatini has one. So
do Steffi Graf and Martina
Navratilova. Now Laxmi Poruri
has one, too.
What all of them have is a one
handed backhand which they can
strike powerfully with either top
spin or slice. Though few would
argue that Poruri's single-fisted
shot is as strong as Sabatini's, the
Cardinal sophomore has been
developing the stroke since she
switched from a two-handed back
hand a year and a half ago.
The main impetus for the

change was Poruri's belief that
the one-hander is better for her
style of play. For years she's
favored finesse but is becoming a
more aggressive, all-around ath
lete.
"(With the one-hander) you
have more versatility and can be
more aggressive coming to net.
The slice is a prime example. You
don't see anybody in tennis slice a
two-hander," Poruri said. "You
can also disguise things better.
You can hit different shots off the
same preparation."
Of course, the stroke has sever
al drawbacks. A player loses
power and control with one fewer

hand on the racquet. "Look at
Sabatini, who has a great one
hander, and (Monica) Seles who
has a two-hander. Seles hits a lot
harder," Poruri said. "Seles just
crushes the ball. Hell, if I could be
No. 1 by doing that I would, but I
can't. That's not my style or my
mentality.
"(The one-hander] suits me
because I use a lot of spins and
different shots." Variety enables
her to play more offensively and
she has strengthened her right
arm to compensate for the loss of
force. The result is an ever
improving weapon in her arsenal.
However, when Poruri first
made the transition, her game
suffered. Opponents attacked the
fledgling stroke. They knew
Poruri's reply would probably be
a relatively weak slice shot. "I
didn't have enough confidence to
hit topspin. I wasn't used to the
timing, which is completely differ
ent from a two-hander," she said.
Throughout the process Poruri
had to cope with more than just
her passing shot landing inches
wide or having a floater slammed
back in her face. Many people
questioned the change.
"I got a lot of criticism when I
lost to people I shouldn't have lost
to," she said. "Maybe I didn't
have as good of a year last year as
I would've liked or people expect
ed me to, but I stuck through it.
I doubted myself 1000 times..."
When national coaches — people
who have been around the game for
30 years — come up and say, 'Don't
do that. Your two-hander is good,'
you question whether you're doing
the right thing."
Despite the fact that Poruri
thought her old backhand was a
"complete zero", she listened to
the skeptics for a while. "I was
going to change when I was
younger and a lot of people criti
cized me." Then she followed her
instincts.
"I finally stopped listening to
them ... It was my decision and I
was going to do it, period," she
said. "I didn't care if God said,

'You're doing the wrong thing,' I
wanted to do it."
When she told coach Frank
Brennan about her choice he was
supportive. "He was all for it and
that's something I really appreci
ate. Everyone's agreeing on it and
that makes me feel more confi
dent," she said.
And now that Poruri has
faith in the shot, her opponents
have suffered. She dominated
the competiton at both the
National College Classic and
Rolex Hegionals.
"The forehand is my strength
so they hit to my backhand — and
I've come back with answers.
That's why I've been successful so
far this year. Now they have to
figure out what to do," she said. "I
hope they keep picking on it
because it's just going to get bet
ter."
Poruri can now reliably strike
the backhand flat, with topspin or
slice. Her goal is to hit mainly top
spin by the NCAA Championships
in May. "I have to; I'm forced to.
If I slice, eventually I'm going to
get killed because people are too
powerful," she said. "Finesse is a
lot of fun and you can toy with
people but its not going to win you
matches."
But that doesn't mean she is
going to give up the delicate touch
shots. She'll still use the topspin
lobs and drop shots to keep adver
saries off balance. "When you play
against someone who just bangs
the ball, unless you're a better
banger, you're not going to win.
Most of the people who play like
that hate finesse."
The one-hander enables her to
counter with almost any shot.
What was once considered a major
weakness is turning into a
strength. "It's just a matter of
knowing what to use when,"
Poruri said.
And what do the skeptics say
now? "People are starting to say
that it was good that I changed.
Before, they were saying 'What
the hell are you doing?' That's the
best part," she said with a smile.

do that. Your two-hander is good,'
you question whether you're doing
the right thing."
Despite the fact that Poruri
thought her old backhand was a
"complete zero", she listened to
the skeptics for a while. "I was
going to change when I was
younger and a lot of people criti
cized me." Then she followed her
instincts.
"I finally stopped listening to
them ... It was my decision and I
was going to do it, period," she
said. "I didn't care if God said,

'You're doing the wrong thing,' I
wanted to do it."
When she told coach Frank
Brennan about her choice he was
supportive. "He was all for it and
that's something I really appreci
ate. Everyone's agreeing on it and
that makes me feel more confi
dent," she said.
And now that Poruri has
faith in the shot, her opponents
have suffered. She dominated
the competiton at both the
National College Classic and
Rolex Hegionals.
"The forehand is my strength
so they hit to my backhand — and
I've come back with answers.
That's why I've been successful so
far this year. Now they have to
figure out what to do," she said. "I
hope they keep picking on it
because it's just going to get bet
ter."
Poruri can now reliably strike
the backhand flat, with topspin or
slice. Her goal is to hit mainly top
spin by the NCAA Championships
in May. "I have to; I'm forced to.
If I slice, eventually I'm going to
get killed because people are too
powerful," she said. "Finesse is a
lot of fun and you can toy with
people but its not going to win you
matches."
But that doesn't mean she is
going to give up the delicate touch
shots. She'll still use the topspin
lobs and drop shots to keep adver
saries off balance. "When you play
against someone who just bangs
the ball, unless you're a better
banger, you're not going to win.
Most of the people who play like
that hate finesse."
The one-hander enables her to
counter with almost any shot.
What was once considered a major
weakness is turning into a
strength. "It's just a matter of
knowing what to use when,"
Poruri said.
And what do the skeptics say
now? "People are starting to say
that it was good that I changed.
Before, they were saying 'What
the hell are you doing?' That's the
best part," she said with a smile.

With the racquet face open, Laxmi Poruri slices under the ball. She
uses the stroke to throw hard-hitters off balance.

Laxmi Poruri uncoils on a backhand drive. Though the racquet face
is closed, topspin is generated by the low-to-high movement of the
racquet during the shot.
Gabriela Sabatini has one. So
do Steffi Graf and Martina
Navratilova. Now Laxmi Poruri
has one, too.
What all of them have is a one
handed backhand which they can
strike powerfully with either top
spin or slice. Though few would
argue that Poruri's single-fisted
shot is as strong as Sabatini's, the
Cardinal sophomore has been
developing the stroke since she
switched from a two-handed back
hand a year and a half ago.
The main impetus for the

change was Poruri's belief that
the one-hander is better for her
style of play. For years she's
favored finesse but is becoming a
more aggressive, all-around ath
lete.
"(With the one-hander) you
have more versatility and can be
more aggressive coming to net.
The slice is a prime example. You
don't see anybody in tennis slice a
two-hander," Poruri said. "You
can also disguise things better.
You can hit different shots off the
same preparation."
Of course, the stroke has sever
al drawbacks. A player loses
power and control with one fewer

hand on the racquet. "Look at
Sabatini, who has a great one
hander, and (Monica) Seles who
has a two-hander. Seles hits a lot
harder," Poruri said. "Seles just
crushes the ball. Hell, if I could be
No. 1 by doing that I would, but I
can't. That's not my style or my
mentality.
"(The one-hander] suits me
because I use a lot of spins and
different shots." Variety enables
her to play more offensively and
she has strengthened her right
arm to compensate for the loss of
force. The result is an ever
improving weapon in her arsenal.
However, when Poruri first
made the transition, her game
suffered. Opponents attacked the
fledgling stroke. They knew
Poruri's reply would probably be
a relatively weak slice shot. "I
didn't have enough confidence to
hit topspin. I wasn't used to the
timing, which is completely differ
ent from a two-hander," she said.
Throughout the process Poruri
had to cope with more than just
her passing shot landing inches
wide or having a floater slammed
back in her face. Many people
questioned the change.
"I got a lot of criticism when I
lost to people I shouldn't have lost
to," she said. "Maybe I didn't
have as good of a year last year as
I would've liked or people expect
ed me to, but I stuck through it.
I doubted myself 1000 times..."

who have been around the game for
