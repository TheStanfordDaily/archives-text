The new $15 million DAPER Sports

all teams;
• An equipment room;
• Recruiting and academic services;
• Sports Information offices;

A $15 million athletic facility
to replace Encina Gym was
approved Monday by the Board of
Trustees. Tentatively called the
DAPER Sports Center, the two
story, 73,728 square foot struc
ture will be built between Maples
Pavilion and the Tennis Stadium.
A $1.4 million gift from Nike
chairman and founder Philip H.
Knight will help finance the new
facility. Knight is an alumnus of
the Graduate School of Business.
Officials expect construction to
begin within two months and be
completed within a year, accord
ing to Ben Asaro, Stanford's man
ager of special projects.
The new, "ultra-modern"
facility will house locker and
shower areas for men and
women, offices for several athlet
ic teams and a modern sports
medicine training room, Asaro
said.
The center will also include a
full-size basketball practice court,
a 120-seat auditorium, a Hall of
Fame Room representing all
sports, an equipment room,
recruiting and academic services
and Sports Information offices.
"This will be a terrific boost to
our (athletic) program for a lot of
reasons," said Asst. Athletic Direc
tor Tom Beckett. "We feel we have
been lacking in adequate offices
for coaches and lockers for student
athletes, and this gives us a state
of-the-art facility that provides the
space we need."
