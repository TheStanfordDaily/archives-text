### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
The new $15 million DAPER Sports
Center planned to replace Encina Gym
will house:
• Offices for several athletic teams;
• A full-size basketball practice court;
• A 120-seat auditorium;
• A Hall of Fame Room representing
all teams;
• An equipment room;
• Recruiting and academic services;
• Sports Information offices;
• A modern sports medicine training
room; and
• Locker and shower areas for men
and women.

A $15 million athletic facility
to replace Encina Gym was
approved Monday by the Board of
Trustees. Tentatively called the
DAPER Sports Center, the two
story, 73,728 square foot struc
ture will be built between Maples
Pavilion and the Tennis Stadium.
A $1.4 million gift from Nike
chairman and founder Philip H.
Knight will help finance the new
facility. Knight is an alumnus of
the Graduate School of Business.
Officials expect construction to
begin within two months and be
completed within a year, accord
ing to Ben Asaro, Stanford's man
ager of special projects.
The new, "ultra-modern"
facility will house locker and
shower areas for men and
women, offices for several athlet
ic teams and a modern sports
medicine training room, Asaro
said.
The center will also include a
full-size basketball practice court,
a 120-seat auditorium, a Hall of
Fame Room representing all
sports, an equipment room,
recruiting and academic services
and Sports Information offices.
"This will be a terrific boost to
our (athletic) program for a lot of
reasons," said Asst. Athletic Direc
tor Tom Beckett. "We feel we have
been lacking in adequate offices
for coaches and lockers for student
athletes, and this gives us a state
of-the-art facility that provides the
space we need."

ject within $1 million of its pro
jected $14,850,000 budget, con
vincing the trustees Monday to
approve construction of the new
facility, according to one source.
The donation supplemented an
initial anonymous gift of $5.5 mil

lion, to which the University is
adding $2.5 million. The Depart
ment of Athletics, Physical Edu
cation and Recreation Investment
Fund will provide $2.3 million
from its endowment to cover the
$109,000 annual maintenance
cost.
The facility will be set approxi
mately 50 feet from Campus
Drive. About half of the field on
which it sits will be retained

behind the structure to form what
Asaro calls "a natural quad" bor
dered by Maples, DeGuerre Pool
and the Tennis Stadium.
The center will serve all the
functions now served by Encina
Gym, Asaro said. "All (those
activities) will go into the new
building, with some things ear
marked for Roble (Gym)."
Asaro said the location of a
new, student-accessible weight

area is still being deliberated.
"We have the square footage
for a comparable (lifting) space (in
the new center), but we're still
determining how everything best
fits. It's still in the planning pro
cess," Asaro said.
The practice and tailgating
space lost to the new facility will
be supplied by a new field — to be
created by razing the old, struc
turally unsafe Encina Gym.

"The budget for the project will
have us knock down Encina and
make it (replace) the field that
was lost," said Asaro. "The space
will be a nice large grassy field
that can used for just about any
thing."
The new 195-by-195 foot build
ing will be modeled after the Serra
Complex that will face it from
across Campus Drive.
The sandstone structure will

replace the 77-year-old Encina
because the latter's unreinforced
masonry would require not only
$5 million in renovation, but
also $2.5 million in state-man
dated earthquake reinforce
ment.
"As a result of the earthquake
(of 1989), the issue had to-be dealt
with," Asaro said. "We had to
either strengthen and upgrade
Encina or get rid of it."
