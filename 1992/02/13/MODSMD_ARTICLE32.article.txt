## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY A 						virtually real world Electronic nirvana or cyberspace Hades â€” you decide 
### Marcos J. Polanco 
Thursday, February 13, 1992

You are swimming in the ocean, gladly watching the coral below and catching fish with
your hands. You notice that an octopus has attached itself to your leg, and you begin to
shake it off. Just then, your roommate walks in on you; she sees you with an oversized
helmet on your head, making swimming motions in midair and frantically shaking your
leg. This is virtual reality.
In case you have been stuck in virtual thought for the last couple of years, virtual real
ity is a technology where users can experience a computerized world of their own creation.
Think of it as a computer scientist's Biosphere 11, a sort of make-believe world where
you can fudge the data, change gravity, be a dolphin if you want, fly if you wish and expe
rience Partial Recall. Virtual reality's cheerleader extraordinaire and leading visionary is
Jaron Lanier, founder and chief executive officer of VPL Research, an industry pacesetter

based in Redwood City.
A musician wearing blond dreadlocks and holding no college degree,

Lanier is not your typical Silicon Valley techno-weenie, yet his

technology has attracted the likes of Boeing and
NASA, which have ongoing projects with his

company.
You may have already seen
VPL's inventions in the form of
Mattel's Power Glove for Ninten
do machines.
In its most popular incarna
tion, virtual reality is experienced
by donning what VPL calls the
Eye Phone. Combining goggles
and headphones, the Eye Phone
provides 3-D sound and a stereo
scopic display of the virtual
world.
A lycra Data Glove worn on
your hand provides the control.
Both devices are chock-full of
sensors to detect the motions of
the user. Turn your head right,
and the view changes to show you
that area of the virtual world.
Point in a certain direction, and
you fly there; make a fist, and
you've just grabbed a virtual
object.
VPL's latest wares even sport
tactile feedback, where you can
actually sense the feel of an
object through inflatable bubbles
which line the dataglove.
Some virtual reality advocates
have taken this concept to its
illogical limits: wear a whole
body version of the Data Glove,
called a Data Suit, connect to the
virtual computer network and
engage in so-called "teledildon
ics," or virtual sex.

Other possibilities come to
mind: wear a whole-body Data-
Suit and have an animated Bart
Simpson (or Hammer, if you are
really cheesy) mimic your move
ments. Or have your whole CIV
section go on a romp through Vir
tual Ancient Greece.
Artists have been quick to
embrace these computerized real
ities; just witness George Coates'
mind-blowing spectacle (see sto
ries, below). His show is nothing
but a waystation to virtual per
formances with full audience par
ticipation.
As fantastic as this seems, it is
already happening. The "Life On
A Slice" poetry display at Cyber
arts International, the industry
get-together, included a comput
er and video camera setup which
"chromakeyed" your image and
placed it on the computer screen
in front of you. (Chromakeying is
used, for instance, to superim
pose your weatherman on the
weather map.)
The virtual, on-screen facsimi
le could respond to your move
ments, manipulating the poetry,
sounds and images emerging from
the computer. Although you never
leave the material world, the
effect can be quite mesmerizing.
And think of the games! If you
have ever gotten emotional about
the Macintosh game "Spectre,"
imagine the effect of being there.
Spectrum Holobyte, a software
company, has developed a game

knows as "Dactyl Nightmare,"
where up to four participants can
enter a virtual world and try to
shoot each other while avoiding a
pterodactyl hovering overhead.
More mundane uses include
having scientists concoct new
drugs by manipulating virtual
molecules and putting them
together like Lego blocks. Archi
tects can design buildings with
their virtual hands oozing virtual
walls; they can then take their
clients on a fly-through of the vir
tual building.
All this is not lost to the
Department of Defense, which
could have pilots direct fighter
jets over Baghdad from virtual
cockpits in Arkansas. NASA is
designing virtual control panels
for the upcoming space station.
And today in Japan, the Mat
sushita Corporation has virtual
environments where housewives
can design their own kitchens.
The technology is far from per
fect. It takes the computers about
a tenth of a second to catch up
with your actions, which can be
disorienting to say the least. Plus
virtual worlds have all the realism
of Saturday morning cartoons.
And don't ask for a virtual
reality set for Christmas: VPL
has just announced a "low-cost"
virtual reality setup for the Mac
intosh, called Microcosm, for a
mere $50,000. The usual setup
goes for nearly a quarter-million
dollars.

VPL's latest wares even sport
tactile feedback, where you can
actually sense the feel of an
object through inflatable bubbles
which line the dataglove.
Some virtual reality advocates
have taken this concept to its
illogical limits: wear a whole
body version of the Data Glove,
called a Data Suit, connect to the
virtual computer network and
engage in so-called "teledildon
ics," or virtual sex.

Other possibilities come to
mind: wear a whole-body Data-
Suit and have an animated Bart
Simpson (or Hammer, if you are
really cheesy) mimic your move
ments. Or have your whole CIV
section go on a romp through Vir
tual Ancient Greece.
Artists have been quick to
embrace these computerized real
ities; just witness George Coates'
mind-blowing spectacle (see sto
ries, below). His show is nothing
but a waystation to virtual per
formances with full audience par
ticipation.
As fantastic as this seems, it is
already happening. The "Life On
A Slice" poetry display at Cyber
arts International, the industry
get-together, included a comput
er and video camera setup which
"chromakeyed" your image and
placed it on the computer screen
in front of you. (Chromakeying is
used, for instance, to superim
pose your weatherman on the
weather map.)
The virtual, on-screen facsimi
le could respond to your move
ments, manipulating the poetry,
sounds and images emerging from
the computer. Although you never
leave the material world, the
effect can be quite mesmerizing.
And think of the games! If you
have ever gotten emotional about
the Macintosh game "Spectre,"
imagine the effect of being there.
Spectrum Holobyte, a software
company, has developed a game

knows as "Dactyl Nightmare,"
where up to four participants can
enter a virtual world and try to
shoot each other while avoiding a
pterodactyl hovering overhead.
More mundane uses include
having scientists concoct new
drugs by manipulating virtual
molecules and putting them
together like Lego blocks. Archi
tects can design buildings with
their virtual hands oozing virtual
walls; they can then take their
clients on a fly-through of the vir
tual building.
All this is not lost to the
Department of Defense, which
could have pilots direct fighter
jets over Baghdad from virtual
cockpits in Arkansas. NASA is
designing virtual control panels
for the upcoming space station.
And today in Japan, the Mat
sushita Corporation has virtual
environments where housewives
can design their own kitchens.
The technology is far from per
fect. It takes the computers about
a tenth of a second to catch up
with your actions, which can be
disorienting to say the least. Plus
virtual worlds have all the realism
of Saturday morning cartoons.
And don't ask for a virtual
reality set for Christmas: VPL
has just announced a "low-cost"
virtual reality setup for the Mac
intosh, called Microcosm, for a
mere $50,000. The usual setup
goes for nearly a quarter-million
dollars.
Thursday, February 13, 1992

You are swimming in the ocean, gladly watching the coral below and catching fish with
your hands. You notice that an octopus has attached itself to your leg, and you begin to
shake it off. Just then, your roommate walks in on you; she sees you with an oversized
helmet on your head, making swimming motions in midair and frantically shaking your
leg. This is virtual reality.
In case you have been stuck in virtual thought for the last couple of years, virtual real
ity is a technology where users can experience a computerized world of their own creation.
Think of it as a computer scientist's Biosphere 11, a sort of make-believe world where
you can fudge the data, change gravity, be a dolphin if you want, fly if you wish and expe
rience Partial Recall. Virtual reality's cheerleader extraordinaire and leading visionary is
Jaron Lanier, founder and chief executive officer of VPL Research, an industry pacesetter

based in Redwood City.
A musician wearing blond dreadlocks and holding no college degree,

Lanier is not your typical Silicon Valley techno-weenie, yet his

technology has attracted the likes of Boeing and
NASA, which have ongoing projects with his

company.
You may have already seen
VPL's inventions in the form of
Mattel's Power Glove for Ninten
do machines.
In its most popular incarna
tion, virtual reality is experienced
by donning what VPL calls the
Eye Phone. Combining goggles
and headphones, the Eye Phone
provides 3-D sound and a stereo
scopic display of the virtual
world.
A lycra Data Glove worn on
your hand provides the control.
Both devices are chock-full of
sensors to detect the motions of
the user. Turn your head right,
and the view changes to show you
that area of the virtual world.
Point in a certain direction, and
you fly there; make a fist, and
you've just grabbed a virtual
object.
VPL's latest wares even sport
tactile feedback, where you can
actually sense the feel of an
