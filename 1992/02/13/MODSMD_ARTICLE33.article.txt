# Beowulf off the coast of Maine

Editor's note: This is the first of
a four-part short story that will
appear in Intermission.

Myriad times have I watched
your face, your glow that warms
unpeopled shores. I know you
that alone love me, I trust you
that alone believe me. I know
you; and would that oceans rain
on me, and fire-mounts swallow
me whole, that our foes may test
my love for you. And would that
weeping mermaids, singing
swans tempt me ceaselessly, that
our rivals may envy my single
brilliant flame for you.
She had only heard stories of
the old Beowulf scholar gone
mad on the coasts of Maine. Of
course they must be rumors; sto
ries have been told of this same
man wrestling sharks and fish
ing with his bare hands. Fables
forged by drunken locals desper
ate to colorize their gray locale.
Stuff for tabloids that ought to
have been sued out of existence
by now, damn them. God bless it,
I love this country. Anything is
possible in newspapers.
She kicked her feet onto the
wooden chair, in the direction of
the sea. Manners go to hell. She
was a New Yorker, what's more a
successful New Yorker, what's
more a successful journalist New
Yorker. Please kick me out, I'll
publicize your ass. Wow . . . what
made her so vicious today? She
was in a little chowder restau
rant run by authentic residents
of Maine, friendly, quiet, unde
serving of fury. A boring fat old
fart named Jamie and his cute
little wife Moll. Rhymes with
doll, she thought.
She remembered now. Her
taxi had taken the wrong road to
Luny Harbor (love the name)
and cost her half an hour. Never
mind the money, damn you! Do
you know who I AM??? I'm from
the New York Fucking Times, do

you realize that?!! And all he mus
tered was something that sound
ed like "I'm sorry, lady." Had he
not sounded like a pathetic cretin,
she would have taken his name
and address just to scare the shit
out of him. That usually worked
with the uneducated.
Send me the fish — my
brethren and sistren — for me to
eat to live to love you another day.
You are the reason I hope in life; I
thank your protection from
storms and from thirst, I lust for
the days when you transform
your soul. When clouds cover you,
I clothe myself and prepare for
the hour when you disrobe.
Scream I for you, and laugh and
pray: small rites to pay for yet
another day!
On the way to Beowulf s myth
ical whereabouts, Annie struck
up a chat with her handsome

chauffeur, a guy named Mitchell.
An intelligent man, frankly, and
probably strong: good in bed?
Maybe she'd find out some time.
He told her about how Felix (that
was Beowulf s real name, Felix M.
Lupus) had lost his wife of ten
years while sailing in a great big
storm.
"Kate was a woman of surpass
ing life, a lover of the wild and
free. Her countenance harbored
secrets too mystical for mortals
other than Felix." Either Mitchell
was a runaway poet, or he had
had an affair with Kate. Probably
both. Lucky Kate.
Mitchell said that Felix had
already been quite psychotic off
and on during their brief mar
riage. An alcoholic of course, what
poet wasn't, but intermittently
schizophrenic on top of that.
Delusions of grandeur. Took shit
loads of pills to keep from flying
off high buildings. I love those.
This guy conversed with heav
enly bodies, like some
Mesopotamian bastard. He would
worship his wife as one heavenly
body, and sometimes she'd let

front of her and some
how light her body, so
it looked like it
glowed, while she
stripped from the top
down for him.

him; he turned her on. Not in pub
lic, of course, but the neighbors
knew anyways. They said she was
using him, using his lunacy to
spike her adrenaline.
He would kneel in front of her
and somehow light her body, so it
looked like it glowed, while she
stripped from the top down for
him. Then he would strip in the
light covering them both, and
they would just embrace; he
would spin her a few times, dance
a little, chant in this language
only they knew. Then he would
carry her to bed and, like some
crazed animal, howl on top of her.
She would scream in lovemaking.
The neighbors were deafened.
Gossip had a price.
