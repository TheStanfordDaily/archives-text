# Beowulf off the coast of Maine

### Benjamin Lai 
Editor's note: This is the first of
a four-part short story that will
appear in Intermission.

Myriad times have I watched
your face, your glow that warms
unpeopled shores. I know you
that alone love me, I trust you
that alone believe me. I know
you; and would that oceans rain
on me, and fire-mounts swallow
me whole, that our foes may test
my love for you. And would that
weeping mermaids, singing
swans tempt me ceaselessly, that
our rivals may envy my single
brilliant flame for you.
She had only heard stories of
the old Beowulf scholar gone
mad on the coasts of Maine. Of
course they must be rumors; sto
ries have been told of this same
man wrestling sharks and fish
ing with his bare hands. Fables
forged by drunken locals desper
ate to colorize their gray locale.
Stuff for tabloids that ought to
have been sued out of existence
by now, damn them. God bless it,
I love this country. Anything is
possible in newspapers.
She kicked her feet onto the
wooden chair, in the direction of
the sea. Manners go to hell. She
was a New Yorker, what's more a
successful New Yorker, what's
more a successful journalist New
Yorker. Please kick me out, I'll
publicize your ass. Wow . . . what
made her so vicious today? She
was in a little chowder restau
rant run by authentic residents
of Maine, friendly, quiet, unde
serving of fury. A boring fat old
fart named Jamie and his cute
little wife Moll. Rhymes with
doll, she thought.
She remembered now. Her
taxi had taken the wrong road to
Luny Harbor (love the name)
and cost her half an hour. Never
mind the money, damn you! Do
you know who I AM??? I'm from
the New York Fucking Times, do
