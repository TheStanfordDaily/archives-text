# 'Invisible Site' paints a haunting image of exile
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
A lush green forest surrounds
the audience in the renovated
San Francisco cathedral. Damp,
green vine tendrils creep out over
the seats, just out of arm's reach,
and all eyes — donning 3-D glass
es — are glued to the 60-foot ver
tical screen as Medea and French
poet Arthur Rimbaud approach,
ambling down the forest path.
Abruptly, the forest disap
pears, replaced by huge cav
ernous rocks, then a rusting,
decrepit car. The actors adjust to
the changes, positioning them
selves on unseen platforms
behind the translucent screen to
create the illusion of a computer
simulated environment.
George Coates' latest avant
garde experiment in performance
art, "Invisible Site: A Virtual
Sho," combines interactive com
puter-generated imagery with
live performance, the first time
this multimedia effect has been
achieved.
Underwritten by several Sili
con Valley computer companies,
as well as the National Endow
ment for the Arts, this project
marks the beginning of a new
outlet for creative and ambitious
artists like Coates.
Coates, who wrote and direct
ed "Invisible Site," drew liberally
from Euripides' "Medea," Shake
speare's "The Tempest" and the
poetry and letters of Rimbaud in
writing the text of the musical.
The narrative follows several
characters through a virtual real
ity game that goes awry when an
unauthorized hacker logs into the
game and forces the players to

assume roles of. famous exiles,
such as Medea and the 14th Dalai
Lama.
Anachronism is the stuff of
"Invisible Site." Cutting-edge
technology overtakes and trans
forms the neo-Gothic cathedral,
and ancient themes of exile,
revenge and forgiveness find a
new home in modern settings.
Haunting arias are performed
simultaneously with state-of-the
art computer-generated sound.
And modern-day characters
assume ancient and 19th-century
literary identities as they interact
in a futuristic virtual reality
world.
The effect of the competing
stimuli is as uncomfortable as it
is awe-inspiring. The pulsating,
urgent pace of the action
unnerves audience members,
who feel disoriented in the
strange and disconcerting world
of technology and multiple-senso
ry stimulation.
The plot is clever and convo
luted. But the real star of this
show is the technological innova
tion itself. The sheer enormity of
this pioneering multimedia won
der — controlled from offstage by
15 technicians with joysticks —
provides reason enough to war
rant a trip to the transformed
San Francisco cathedral that
hosts the performances.
Outfitted with 3-D glasses,
viewers find themselves alter
nately drawn to the screen and
cowering from it. Twisting
psychedelic corridors and lush
forests beckon, while damp city
streets and charred landscapes
repel.

altered their identities.
