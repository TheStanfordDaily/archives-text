# 'Invisible Site' paints a haunting image of exile
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
A lush green forest surrounds
the audience in the renovated
San Francisco cathedral. Damp,
green vine tendrils creep out over
the seats, just out of arm's reach,
and all eyes — donning 3-D glass
es — are glued to the 60-foot ver
tical screen as Medea and French
poet Arthur Rimbaud approach,
ambling down the forest path.
Abruptly, the forest disap
pears, replaced by huge cav
ernous rocks, then a rusting,
decrepit car. The actors adjust to
the changes, positioning them
selves on unseen platforms
behind the translucent screen to
create the illusion of a computer
simulated environment.
George Coates' latest avant
garde experiment in performance
art, "Invisible Site: A Virtual
Sho," combines interactive com
puter-generated imagery with
live performance, the first time
this multimedia effect has been
achieved.
Underwritten by several Sili
con Valley computer companies,
as well as the National Endow
ment for the Arts, this project
marks the beginning of a new
outlet for creative and ambitious
artists like Coates.
Coates, who wrote and direct
ed "Invisible Site," drew liberally
from Euripides' "Medea," Shake
speare's "The Tempest" and the
poetry and letters of Rimbaud in
writing the text of the musical.
The narrative follows several
characters through a virtual real
ity game that goes awry when an
unauthorized hacker logs into the
game and forces the players to

assume roles of. famous exiles,
such as Medea and the 14th Dalai
Lama.
Anachronism is the stuff of
"Invisible Site." Cutting-edge
technology overtakes and trans
forms the neo-Gothic cathedral,
and ancient themes of exile,
revenge and forgiveness find a
new home in modern settings.
Haunting arias are performed
simultaneously with state-of-the
art computer-generated sound.
And modern-day characters
assume ancient and 19th-century
literary identities as they interact
in a futuristic virtual reality
world.
The effect of the competing
stimuli is as uncomfortable as it
is awe-inspiring. The pulsating,
urgent pace of the action
unnerves audience members,
who feel disoriented in the
strange and disconcerting world
of technology and multiple-senso
ry stimulation.
The plot is clever and convo
luted. But the real star of this
show is the technological innova
tion itself. The sheer enormity of
this pioneering multimedia won
der — controlled from offstage by
15 technicians with joysticks —
provides reason enough to war
rant a trip to the transformed
San Francisco cathedral that
hosts the performances.
Outfitted with 3-D glasses,
viewers find themselves alter
nately drawn to the screen and
cowering from it. Twisting
psychedelic corridors and lush
forests beckon, while damp city
streets and charred landscapes
repel.

In the surrealistic world of a virtual reality game gone awry, actors
in "Invisible Site: A Virtual Sho," a production of George Coates Per
fomance Works, struggle to regain control from intruders who have
altered their identities.
Behind the screen, actors move in
near-perfect synchronicity with
the changing backdrops, superim
posed menu options and mechani
cal, computer-generated human
forms. Unseen platforms, stair
cases, see-saws and hanging bars
behind the screen allow creative
use of both horizontal and vertical
planes.
An actor climbing the staircase
appears to amble down a forest
path or retreat through a tower
ing doorframe. Another actor
hangs from a suspended bar and
rapidly moves his legs to simulate
the effect of running over the
moving landscape.
Their timing must be impecca
ble and the stage direction precise,
for the sheer enormity of the com
puter-generated background and
the three-dimensional effect per
ceived by the audience cannot be
appreciated from an onstage van
tage point.
"Invisible Site" is the pilot pro
ject of SMARTS — Science Meets
the Arts Society — a project of
George Coates Performance
Works. The show was first per
formed at a computer graphics
trade show last July.
But, as Coates pointed out
backstage after the show, the pro
duction "is not about technology."

Scientific innovations are merely
the tools Coates employs to play
upon the ancient theme of exile, to
explore timeless emotions and
possible reactions to banishment
and displacement.
A crash course or brush-up on
Shakespeare's tragedies, Greek
mythology and 19th-century
French poets may aid the viewer
in following the fast-paced action
and allusion-packed narrative.
But a cursory knowledge will suf
fice if one reads the playbill, which
provides a quick glossary of char
acters and history.
The plot follows several charac
ters as they strap on helmets and
sensory gloves and immerse them
selves in the computer-generated
fantasy world of virtual reality.
The two main characters
choose to pursue a singles-ren
dezvous, looking for a computer
age one-night stand. The woman
selects Shakespeare's Prospero as
her character, and informs her
game partner that he will play Cal
iban, her slave, so they can act out
her sadomasochistic sex fantasy.
But once logged on, she finds
the rules have changed, and she
does not have the control she
expected. A hostile hacker gains
unauthorized access to her virtual
reality world and recasts her as
Medea, who was exiled after her
husband, Jason of Argos, took
another lover, and sought revenge
on him before she left.
The hacker assumes the "digi

dentity" (log-in name and virtual
personality) of French expatriate
poet Rimbaud, whom in the show
calls himself "one of the world's
great assholes."
But he is not always controlling
the game either. Another hacker
has logged on using Rimbaud's
codename, and now controls the
environment, toying with him and
the rest of the exiled characters as
they move through strange and
often hostile territory.
Although the narrative itself is
intriguing, it competes with the
majestic orchestration of unfamil
iar special effects for the audi
ence's attention. And it's all too
easy to lose track of the plot —
without really minding all that
much.
Coates displayed some displea
sure with the idea that audience
members may focus more on the
gimmicks than on the art itself.
But despite his frustration, the
effect of the new technology suits
his theme precisely.
Such multimedia performances
will only overwhelm an audience
the first few times they are
viewed. And it is precisely this
sensory overload, this feeling of
being lost in an unfamiliar and
sometimes hostile world, which
allows Coates' audience to
empathize with the characters; to
feel, and not only see the show;
and to appreciate, with the wide
eyed gaze of a child, the genius of
his theme.

backstage after the show, the pro
duction "is not about technology."

Scientific innovations are merely
the tools Coates employs to play
upon the ancient theme of exile, to
explore timeless emotions and
possible reactions to banishment
and displacement.
A crash course or brush-up on
Shakespeare's tragedies, Greek
mythology and 19th-century
French poets may aid the viewer
in following the fast-paced action
and allusion-packed narrative.
But a cursory knowledge will suf
fice if one reads the playbill, which
provides a quick glossary of char
acters and history.
The plot follows several charac
ters as they strap on helmets and
sensory gloves and immerse them
selves in the computer-generated
fantasy world of virtual reality.
The two main characters
choose to pursue a singles-ren
dezvous, looking for a computer
age one-night stand. The woman
selects Shakespeare's Prospero as
her character, and informs her
game partner that he will play Cal
iban, her slave, so they can act out
her sadomasochistic sex fantasy.
But once logged on, she finds
the rules have changed, and she
does not have the control she
expected. A hostile hacker gains
unauthorized access to her virtual
reality world and recasts her as
Medea, who was exiled after her
husband, Jason of Argos, took
another lover, and sought revenge
on him before she left.
The hacker assumes the "digi

dentity" (log-in name and virtual
personality) of French expatriate
poet Rimbaud, whom in the show
calls himself "one of the world's
great assholes."
But he is not always controlling
the game either. Another hacker
has logged on using Rimbaud's
codename, and now controls the
environment, toying with him and
the rest of the exiled characters as
they move through strange and
often hostile territory.
Although the narrative itself is
intriguing, it competes with the
majestic orchestration of unfamil
iar special effects for the audi
ence's attention. And it's all too
easy to lose track of the plot —
without really minding all that
much.
Coates displayed some displea
sure with the idea that audience
members may focus more on the
gimmicks than on the art itself.
But despite his frustration, the
effect of the new technology suits
his theme precisely.
Such multimedia performances
will only overwhelm an audience
the first few times they are
viewed. And it is precisely this
sensory overload, this feeling of
being lost in an unfamiliar and
sometimes hostile world, which
allows Coates' audience to
empathize with the characters; to
feel, and not only see the show;
and to appreciate, with the wide
eyed gaze of a child, the genius of
his theme.
A lush green forest surrounds
the audience in the renovated
San Francisco cathedral. Damp,
green vine tendrils creep out over
the seats, just out of arm's reach,
and all eyes — donning 3-D glass
es — are glued to the 60-foot ver
tical screen as Medea and French
poet Arthur Rimbaud approach,
ambling down the forest path.
Abruptly, the forest disap
pears, replaced by huge cav
ernous rocks, then a rusting,
decrepit car. The actors adjust to
the changes, positioning them
selves on unseen platforms
behind the translucent screen to
create the illusion of a computer
simulated environment.
George Coates' latest avant
garde experiment in performance
art, "Invisible Site: A Virtual
Sho," combines interactive com
puter-generated imagery with
live performance, the first time
this multimedia effect has been
achieved.
Underwritten by several Sili
con Valley computer companies,
as well as the National Endow
ment for the Arts, this project
marks the beginning of a new
outlet for creative and ambitious
artists like Coates.
Coates, who wrote and direct
ed "Invisible Site," drew liberally
from Euripides' "Medea," Shake
speare's "The Tempest" and the
poetry and letters of Rimbaud in
writing the text of the musical.
The narrative follows several
characters through a virtual real
ity game that goes awry when an
unauthorized hacker logs into the
game and forces the players to

assume roles of. famous exiles,
such as Medea and the 14th Dalai
Lama.
Anachronism is the stuff of
"Invisible Site." Cutting-edge
technology overtakes and trans
forms the neo-Gothic cathedral,
and ancient themes of exile,
revenge and forgiveness find a
new home in modern settings.
Haunting arias are performed
simultaneously with state-of-the
art computer-generated sound.
And modern-day characters
assume ancient and 19th-century
literary identities as they interact
in a futuristic virtual reality
world.
The effect of the competing
stimuli is as uncomfortable as it
is awe-inspiring. The pulsating,
urgent pace of the action
unnerves audience members,
who feel disoriented in the
strange and disconcerting world
of technology and multiple-senso
ry stimulation.
The plot is clever and convo
luted. But the real star of this
show is the technological innova
tion itself. The sheer enormity of
this pioneering multimedia won
der — controlled from offstage by
15 technicians with joysticks —
provides reason enough to war
rant a trip to the transformed
San Francisco cathedral that
hosts the performances.
Outfitted with 3-D glasses,
viewers find themselves alter
nately drawn to the screen and
cowering from it. Twisting
psychedelic corridors and lush
forests beckon, while damp city
streets and charred landscapes
repel.

In the surrealistic world of a virtual reality game gone awry, actors
in "Invisible Site: A Virtual Sho," a production of George Coates Per
fomance Works, struggle to regain control from intruders who have
altered their identities.
Behind the screen, actors move in
near-perfect synchronicity with
the changing backdrops, superim
posed menu options and mechani
cal, computer-generated human
forms. Unseen platforms, stair
cases, see-saws and hanging bars
behind the screen allow creative
use of both horizontal and vertical
planes.
An actor climbing the staircase
appears to amble down a forest
path or retreat through a tower
ing doorframe. Another actor
hangs from a suspended bar and
rapidly moves his legs to simulate
the effect of running over the
moving landscape.
Their timing must be impecca
ble and the stage direction precise,
for the sheer enormity of the com
puter-generated background and
the three-dimensional effect per
ceived by the audience cannot be
appreciated from an onstage van
tage point.
"Invisible Site" is the pilot pro
ject of SMARTS — Science Meets
the Arts Society — a project of
George Coates Performance
Works. The show was first per
formed at a computer graphics
trade show last July.
