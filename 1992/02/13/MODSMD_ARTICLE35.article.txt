# Disdainful Coates fashions a new multimedia art form
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
A pioneer in multimedia
production, George Coates has
defined the frontier of perfor
mance-art technology for over
a decade. Unfortunately, the
impressive originality of his
work dissolves in his abrasive
personality.
Cloaked in the velvety dark
ness backstage at Performance
Works, Coates does his best to
make visitors feel unwelcome.
At first stand-offish and vague,
Coates' passive disinterest is
soon replaced by overt hostility
and affected condescension.
One bare lightbulb provides
a narrow strip of pale illumina
tion backstage, lighting half of
Coates' heavyset frame from
behind. One glaring icy blue
eye appears when he lurches
forward — as if ofT-balance —
and then sinks back into the
darkness. His short, sparse
Van Dyke beard covers his
chin, and a thick moustache
hangs like a carpet over his
upper lip.
Coates demands credentials
and casts judgment immediate
ly, deciding in an instant
whether an interview is worth
his time.
"In order to make a life in

theater, artists have to be
hunters in a sense," Coates
said, justifying his aversion to
speaking with journalists who
don't work with "New York
magazines, for example."
Afler concluding a tirade of
undirected rage, Coates con
cedes to address some substan
tial aspects of his work,
although he presents his phi
losophy with the presumption
that it will be too lofty for any
one but him to understand.
"Multimedia provides a way
of presenting concurrent sen
sory data, continuous overlays
of information. Sometimes the
music leads, sometimes the
characters, sometimes the
video." And the overwhelming
options provide both the artis
tic challenges and the practical
difficulties. "People's attention
has such a narrow band,"
Coates said. "It's hard to focus
on several points — in fact
that's a contradiction, but one
that multimedia artists are
very aware of."
The question of focus pre
sents iself whenever artists are
working with a new medium,
according to Coates, making
the use of cutting edge technol
ogy a double-edged sword.
"Can you imagine if the first
movie with sound was 'Gone
with the Wind'?" Coates asked.
"No one would have noticed the
movie. All they would have
noticed was the voices."
And the innovations in
"Invisible Site" present a similar

dilemma. Because of the gim
micks, "People aren't always lis
tening to the narratives. But
this show isn't about technolo
gy. It's about exiles," Coates
insisted.
"There's a small minority
(who attend Invisible Site) that
never get past the 'Oh, wow!'
factor," he said, with more than
a touch of disdain. "And if that
carried as much weight, fine."
