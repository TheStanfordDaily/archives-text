# 'Living on the border'
## One year after death, Islas' memory hasn't faded 
### Ed Heinemann Staff writer 
"From gentle hearts plagued by vio
lence and epic delusions to a child who
can foretell the coming of rain in the
sweet scent of angels, here is a rich and
poignant tale of outcasts struggling to
live and die with dignity . .. and to hold
on to their past while embracing an
unsteady future." — From the hack cover
of the 1991 Avon reprint of Arturo Islas's
1984 novel "The Rain God"
These words, if sounding a bit like
breathless dust-jacket hyperbole, are cer
tainly kind enough. The fact that a New
York publishing house would dig up its
best promotional writers for"The Rain
God" shows that Arturo Islas has finally
made it into the ranks of America's "sig
nificant" authors.
But for Islas, the novelist and Stan
ford English professor who died of AlDS
related complications one year ago this
Saturday at the age of 52, the hype, while
rewarding, would probably seem some
what ironic.
One of the biggest "struggles" of his
personal and professional life, after all,
was his fight to get the New York pub
lishing industry to recognize that he and
other Chicano authors had a voice worth
listening to.
"He was very bitter against the pub
lishing establishment in the East, which
had systematically denied publication to
Chicano writers," says English professor
George Dekker, who presented Islas'

memorial resolution to the Faculty Sen
ate last spring.
Islas finally cracked the system when
the 1990 publication of his second novel,
"Migrant Souls," made him the first Chi
cano to be published by a New York firm,
but it was hardly the first time he found
himself breaking new ground for his cul
ture.
From his acceptance to Stanford as an
undergraduate in 1956, to the conferral
of his doctorate in 1971 — which made
him the first Chicano in the U.S. to
receive a Ph.D. in English — to his pro
motion to tenure in 1976, Islas was a
decidedly Chicano intellectual and artist

One of his biggest struggles.. .was to get the New York
publishing industry to recognize that he and other Chi
cano authors had a voice worth listening to.

in an almost uniformly Anglo world.
It wasn't always the easiest experi
ence. English professor Nancy Packer,
chair of the creative writing program,
says that Islas was often "lonely" in the
'60s and '70s — but it was ultimately an
undeniable boon to his art.
The feeling that he was, as Packer
puts it, "living on the border" between
cultures resonates narratively, themati
cally and stylistically through his two
novels, and makes for what Spanish pro
fessor emeritus Fernando Alegria calls
fiction that "disturbs the reader with

allusions that make necessary considera
tions of the social and historical back
grounds of the writer."
In other words, the reader can't avoid
the fact that the writer and his charac
ters are Chicanos with only a tenuous
foothold in an Anglo society. This is the
dynamic from which the novels draw
their power, and, by all accounts, it
works.
Prof. Ron Rebholz, chairman of the
English department, calls "The Rain
God" a "masterpiece." Packer says the
book "is a very important contribution to
a very complex subject that's been out of
Anglo understanding. He's opened up
that world to us."
And the praise is by no means limited
to Islas' Stanford colleagues. "The Rain
God" has won several literary prizes, and
both books show promise of remaining
significant in another way: they are being
taught and read.
Dekker says"The Rain God" is "wide
ly taught" in high school and college
courses, and "has the ingredients for

endurance. 'The Rain God' really is very
widely admired, and it's hard to believe
that it isn't going to be around for a long
time, because it registers certain cultural
tensions so well."
But while Islas' sophisticated treat
ment of those "tensions" has drawn
"unexpected readers," as Alegria says, it
is precisely the complexity and multiplic
ity of those tensions that has, in some
people's eyes, kept many readers from
fully grasping Islas's message.
"I feel that he wasn't heard," Alegria
says. "Even some admiring critics kept

away from things that, to me, were all
important. There was a tacit move to pro
mote Islas within the literary tradition of
this country, but with a silent recognition
that he didn't fit into that tradition."
One of the unspoken "things" is the
other major "tension" in Islas's life:

'He carried with him a feverish desire to tell his life in
order to illuminate other people's perceptions of a life
regained through the miracle of art.'

homosexuality. Islas was gay, and much
of "Migrant Souls" is told from the point
of view of a man struggling with his
homosexuality.
Critics have largely skirted the issue,
according to Alegria: "I don't believe that
the sexual problem was directly alluded
to in any of the reviews I've seen, but I do
feel its presence in the background of
these reviews."
Islas himself seemed comfortable with
his sexuality, if quiet about it. "Arturo
kept that side of himself private," says
Dekker. "He wasn't one to get up and say
'I'm gay. What are you going to make of
it?"'
Islas was rarely in the foreground of
any of his political causes — although
Dekker says that he was "very political
and very much an activist." As Dekker
puts it:"He wasn't going to go out and
make big speeches. He had to find his
own way, and he did. He did it in his fic
tion."
First and foremost, Islas tried to use
his fiction to promote understanding of
Chicano culture. Any hesitation about
assuming a role as a spokesman for Chi
cano causes began to fade with the publi
cation of "The Rain God."
"Arturo saw himself as both an indi
vidual and a representative," says

Dekker. "It wasn't just T who made this
breakthrough; it was 'Arturo Islas, Chi
cano writer.' "
Islas also tried to make a difference
through his teaching — and certainly did,
if student opinion is any indication. He
received the Dinkelspiel Award in 1976,

and his class on Hemingway and Fitzger
ald, according to Rebholz, was "immense
ly large," regularly drawing over 300 stu
dents.
For Dekker, this was as powerful as
any speech Islas could have made. "One
of the ways he was so effective as a
spokesman for Chicano and gay interests
was the way that he was so good at teach
ing non-Chicano and non-gay interests.
He could reach people who couldn't be
reached by classes on gender and ethnici
ty."
But large, general-interest lecture
classes were only half of Islas' role as a
professor. The other half consisted of the
small seminars such as "American Lives"
— a class that combined readings of auto
biographical texts with students' efforts
to write about their own lives — and
Bilingual Creative Writing, which fused
Islas' art and teaching and made him a
true friend to many of his students, espe
cially Chicanos.
Anita DeLucio, who graduated last
year, tells of her experience in Bilingual
Creative Writing: "Creative writing puts
you in a very vulnerable spot; he was very
sensitive to that. And he always encour
aged us to use both languages, even
though people are always saying
'just write in English' or 'just
write in Spanish.' He had a great
deal of conviction that we should
feel proud of both languages."
With this constant attempt to
help students forge a distinctly
Chicano place in Anglo culture,
it is hardly surprising that Islas
was, as Charlene Aguilar, the
Assistant Director of the Center
for Chicano Research, puts it, "a
hero in many ways to us," who
"helped give Chicanos a sense of

dignity and respect in all areas of
higher education."
Arturo Islas certainly had dif
ficulties achieving that "dignity"
on his own terms. In the end,
however, as he lay dying, he
seemed almost to have overcome
those obstacles, and cobbled a
singularity out of the multiplici
ties his life had been built upon.
"I had the feeling that at the
end he was living just for the
purpose of writing," says Fer
nando Alegria. "He carried with
him a feverish desire to tell his
life in order to illuminate other
people's perceptions of a life
regained through the miracle of
art."
"From gentle hearts plagued by vio
lence and epic delusions to a child who
can foretell the coming of rain in the
sweet scent of angels, here is a rich and
poignant tale of outcasts struggling to

Islas also tried to make a difference
through his teaching — and certainly did,
if student opinion is any indication. He
received the Dinkelspiel Award in 1976,

and his class on Hemingway and Fitzger
ald, according to Rebholz, was "immense
ly large," regularly drawing over 300 stu
dents.
For Dekker, this was as powerful as
any speech Islas could have made. "One
of the ways he was so effective as a
spokesman for Chicano and gay interests
was the way that he was so good at teach
ing non-Chicano and non-gay interests.
He could reach people who couldn't be
reached by classes on gender and ethnici

But large, general-interest lecture
classes were only half of Islas' role as a
professor. The other half consisted of the
small seminars such as "American Lives"
— a class that combined readings of auto
biographical texts with students' efforts
to write about their own lives — and
Bilingual Creative Writing, which fused
Islas' art and teaching and made him a
true friend to many of his students, espe
cially Chicanos.
Anita DeLucio, who graduated last
year, tells of her experience in Bilingual
Creative Writing: "Creative writing puts
you in a very vulnerable spot; he was very
sensitive to that. And he always encour
aged us to use both languages, even
though people are always saying
'just write in English' or 'just
write in Spanish.' He had a great
deal of conviction that we should
feel proud of both languages."
With this constant attempt to
help students forge a distinctly
Chicano place in Anglo culture,
it is hardly surprising that Islas
was, as Charlene Aguilar, the
Assistant Director of the Center
for Chicano Research, puts it, "a
hero in many ways to us," who
"helped give Chicanos a sense of

dignity and respect in all areas of
higher education."
Arturo Islas certainly had dif
ficulties achieving that "dignity"
on his own terms. In the end,
however, as he lay dying, he
seemed almost to have overcome
those obstacles, and cobbled a
singularity out of the multiplici
ties his life had been built upon.
"I had the feeling that at the
end he was living just for the
purpose of writing," says Fer
nando Alegria. "He carried with
him a feverish desire to tell his

"From gentle hearts plagued by vio
lence and epic delusions to a child who

on to their past while embracing an
unsteady future." — From the hack cover
of the 1991 Avon reprint of Arturo Islas's
1984 novel "The Rain God"
These words, if sounding a bit like
breathless dust-jacket hyperbole, are cer
tainly kind enough. The fact that a New
York publishing house would dig up its
best promotional writers for"The Rain
God" shows that Arturo Islas has finally
made it into the ranks of America's "sig
nificant" authors.
But for Islas, the novelist and Stan
ford English professor who died of AlDS
related complications one year ago this
Saturday at the age of 52, the hype, while
rewarding, would probably seem some
what ironic.
One of the biggest "struggles" of his
personal and professional life, after all,
was his fight to get the New York pub
lishing industry to recognize that he and
other Chicano authors had a voice worth
listening to.
"He was very bitter against the pub
lishing establishment in the East, which
had systematically denied publication to
Chicano writers," says English professor
George Dekker, who presented Islas'

memorial resolution to the Faculty Sen
ate last spring.
Islas finally cracked the system when
the 1990 publication of his second novel,
"Migrant Souls," made him the first Chi
cano to be published by a New York firm,
but it was hardly the first time he found
himself breaking new ground for his cul
ture.
From his acceptance to Stanford as an
undergraduate in 1956, to the conferral
of his doctorate in 1971 — which made
him the first Chicano in the U.S. to
receive a Ph.D. in English — to his pro
motion to tenure in 1976, Islas was a
decidedly Chicano intellectual and artist

One of his biggest struggles.. .was to get the New York
publishing industry to recognize that he and other Chi
cano authors had a voice worth listening to.

in an almost uniformly Anglo world.
It wasn't always the easiest experi
ence. English professor Nancy Packer,
chair of the creative writing program,
says that Islas was often "lonely" in the
'60s and '70s — but it was ultimately an
undeniable boon to his art.
The feeling that he was, as Packer
puts it, "living on the border" between
cultures resonates narratively, themati
cally and stylistically through his two
novels, and makes for what Spanish pro
fessor emeritus Fernando Alegria calls
fiction that "disturbs the reader with

allusions that make necessary considera
tions of the social and historical back
grounds of the writer."
In other words, the reader can't avoid
the fact that the writer and his charac
ters are Chicanos with only a tenuous
foothold in an Anglo society. This is the
dynamic from which the novels draw
their power, and, by all accounts, it
works.
Prof. Ron Rebholz, chairman of the
English department, calls "The Rain
God" a "masterpiece." Packer says the
book "is a very important contribution to
a very complex subject that's been out of
Anglo understanding. He's opened up
that world to us."
And the praise is by no means limited
to Islas' Stanford colleagues. "The Rain
God" has won several literary prizes, and
both books show promise of remaining
significant in another way: they are being
taught and read.
Dekker says"The Rain God" is "wide
ly taught" in high school and college
courses, and "has the ingredients for

endurance. 'The Rain God' really is very
widely admired, and it's hard to believe
that it isn't going to be around for a long
time, because it registers certain cultural
tensions so well."
But while Islas' sophisticated treat
ment of those "tensions" has drawn
"unexpected readers," as Alegria says, it
is precisely the complexity and multiplic
ity of those tensions that has, in some
people's eyes, kept many readers from
fully grasping Islas's message.
"I feel that he wasn't heard," Alegria
says. "Even some admiring critics kept

away from things that, to me, were all
important. There was a tacit move to pro
mote Islas within the literary tradition of
this country, but with a silent recognition
that he didn't fit into that tradition."
One of the unspoken "things" is the
other major "tension" in Islas's life:

'He carried with him a feverish desire to tell his life in
order to illuminate other people's perceptions of a life
regained through the miracle of art.'

homosexuality. Islas was gay, and much
of "Migrant Souls" is told from the point
of view of a man struggling with his
homosexuality.
Critics have largely skirted the issue,
according to Alegria: "I don't believe that
the sexual problem was directly alluded
to in any of the reviews I've seen, but I do
feel its presence in the background of
these reviews."
Islas himself seemed comfortable with
his sexuality, if quiet about it. "Arturo
kept that side of himself private," says
Dekker. "He wasn't one to get up and say
'I'm gay. What are you going to make of
it?"'
Islas was rarely in the foreground of
any of his political causes — although
Dekker says that he was "very political
and very much an activist." As Dekker
puts it:"He wasn't going to go out and
make big speeches. He had to find his
own way, and he did. He did it in his fic
tion."
First and foremost, Islas tried to use
his fiction to promote understanding of
Chicano culture. Any hesitation about
assuming a role as a spokesman for Chi
cano causes began to fade with the publi
cation of "The Rain God."
"Arturo saw himself as both an indi
vidual and a representative," says

Dekker. "It wasn't just T who made this

endurance. 'The Rain God' really is very
widely admired, and it's hard to believe
that it isn't going to be around for a long
time, because it registers certain cultural
tensions so well."
But while Islas' sophisticated treat
ment of those "tensions" has drawn
"unexpected readers," as Alegria says, it
is precisely the complexity and multiplic
ity of those tensions that has, in some
people's eyes, kept many readers from
fully grasping Islas's message.
"I feel that he wasn't heard," Alegria
says. "Even some admiring critics kept

away from things that, to me, were all
important. There was a tacit move to pro
mote Islas within the literary tradition of
this country, but with a silent recognition
that he didn't fit into that tradition."
One of the unspoken "things" is the
other major "tension" in Islas's life:

'He carried with him a feverish desire to tell his life in
order to illuminate other people's perceptions of a life
regained through the miracle of art.'

homosexuality. Islas was gay, and much
of "Migrant Souls" is told from the point
of view of a man struggling with his
homosexuality.
Critics have largely skirted the issue,
according to Alegria: "I don't believe that
the sexual problem was directly alluded
to in any of the reviews I've seen, but I do
feel its presence in the background of
these reviews."
Islas himself seemed comfortable with
his sexuality, if quiet about it. "Arturo
kept that side of himself private," says
Dekker. "He wasn't one to get up and say
'I'm gay. What are you going to make of
it?"'
Islas was rarely in the foreground of
any of his political causes — although
Dekker says that he was "very political
and very much an activist." As Dekker
puts it:"He wasn't going to go out and
make big speeches. He had to find his
own way, and he did. He did it in his fic
tion."
First and foremost, Islas tried to use
his fiction to promote understanding of
Chicano culture. Any hesitation about
assuming a role as a spokesman for Chi
cano causes began to fade with the publi
cation of "The Rain God."
"Arturo saw himself as both an indi
vidual and a representative," says

Dekker. "It wasn't just T who made this
breakthrough; it was 'Arturo Islas, Chi
cano writer.' "
Islas also tried to make a difference
through his teaching — and certainly did,
if student opinion is any indication. He
received the Dinkelspiel Award in 1976,

and his class on Hemingway and Fitzger
ald, according to Rebholz, was "immense
ly large," regularly drawing over 300 stu
dents.
For Dekker, this was as powerful as
any speech Islas could have made. "One
of the ways he was so effective as a
spokesman for Chicano and gay interests
was the way that he was so good at teach
ing non-Chicano and non-gay interests.
He could reach people who couldn't be
reached by classes on gender and ethnici
ty."
But large, general-interest lecture
classes were only half of Islas' role as a
professor. The other half consisted of the
small seminars such as "American Lives"
— a class that combined readings of auto
biographical texts with students' efforts
to write about their own lives — and
Bilingual Creative Writing, which fused
Islas' art and teaching and made him a
true friend to many of his students, espe
cially Chicanos.
Anita DeLucio, who graduated last
year, tells of her experience in Bilingual
Creative Writing: "Creative writing puts
you in a very vulnerable spot; he was very
sensitive to that. And he always encour
aged us to use both languages, even
though people are always saying
'just write in English' or 'just
write in Spanish.' He had a great
deal of conviction that we should
feel proud of both languages."
With this constant attempt to
help students forge a distinctly
Chicano place in Anglo culture,
it is hardly surprising that Islas
was, as Charlene Aguilar, the
Assistant Director of the Center
for Chicano Research, puts it, "a
hero in many ways to us," who
"helped give Chicanos a sense of

dignity and respect in all areas of
higher education."
Arturo Islas certainly had dif
ficulties achieving that "dignity"
on his own terms. In the end,
however, as he lay dying, he
seemed almost to have overcome
those obstacles, and cobbled a
singularity out of the multiplici
ties his life had been built upon.
"I had the feeling that at the
end he was living just for the
purpose of writing," says Fer
nando Alegria. "He carried with
him a feverish desire to tell his
life in order to illuminate other
people's perceptions of a life
regained through the miracle of
art."
