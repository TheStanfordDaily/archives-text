# Love tips from a bitter Greek philosopher
## 
### 
Love. Exciting and new. Let it flow. Then
run like hell.
That's right kids, it's Valentine's Day,
and you know what that means. No, not
misogynistic hair-treatments at the library. It
means Platonic discourses. So let's get right to
it then, shall we?
How do I, but a simple person, go about
finding love?
Well, Polemarchus, some people say the
easiest way to find love is to let it come to you.
Others say to go out and look for it.
I say pretend you're dead. I'm talking the
whole, Tom Sawyer, feign-your-own-funeral,
nine yards of it. Plan it out way in advance.
The month or two before the big day, meet
lots of really attractive people; become the edi
tor of an L.A. fashion magazine, do make-up
for "Studs," offer to be one of those kids who
mop up sweat during women's volleyball
games — whatever it takes.
Then, when the time comes, scope out the
people who show up at the funeral. Nothing
melts a heart quite like a resurrection. Trust
me, I know.
Next question.
Oh wise one, what is love, and will it help
me find an investment-banking job 1 ?
No, Glaucon, love won't help you find a job,
but it very well may land you a big promotion
somewhere down the road. It's all how you
play it.
The point is, love — like everything else
you'll encounter in your short, pathetic lives
— is a power relationship. Someone's calling
the shots, and that person might as well be
you. So, next time you find yourself in love
with that special someone, ask yourself the
following simple questions:
• Who actually decides whether you do
Greek or Japanese?
• Who sleeps on the side of the bed closer to
the alarm clock?
• Who does most of the work during sex?
• Who cleans up afterward?
• When eating meat, who eats no fat and
who eats no lean?
• When you shower together, and there's
only enough conditioner for one of you, what
usually happens?
• Are you, or have you ever been, a member
of the League of Revolutionary Struggle?

The most important thing to remember
when using this model of love is this: Orgasms
are like victories. To think of them otherwise
is fooling yourself. The smartest thing you can
do is to keep an accurate tally sheet someplace
inconspicuous — like a bedpost. You'll thank
me later.
What are love's exits and entrances?
Let me inform you, Adiemantus, of the five
stages of every relationship, so that you too
can avoid the mewling and puking that accom
panies them.
Stage One: Vague Attraction. Excited stage
in which you pose incomprehensible, hypo
thetical questions to your friends, such as: "If
you liked someone, and you said 'Hi' and they
said 'Bonjour,' does that mean they're not
interested?"
Stage Two: Initial Hook-Up. Usually
marked by fear, passion, relief and the instan
taneous revival of fear. Next few days marked
by avoidance of person, but constant, unspo
ken questions about what they are thinking.
Possibly the most thrilling, rewarding stage.
Cherish it.
Stage Three: Coupling Up. Complete loss of
independence. Clothes are shared in frightening
combinations; strange, regressive, mother-son
like speech patterns are formed; studying
becomes strange, useless mating ritual. Opinion
is formed about every restaurant in Palo Alto.
Meal card is given to friends in cheap, unsuc
cessful attempt to buy their lost affection.
Stage Four: Beginning Of The End. Conver
sations stop making sense. Discussions errati
cally waver between the completely mundane

("What movie are we getting tonight?") and
the completely metaphysical ("I just don't
think it's working." "But I'll change." "But
then you wouldn't be you, and that's what I
really like about you — thatyoimess.")
Stage Five: The Dump. Usually marked by
fear, passion, relief and the instantaneous
revival of fear. Next few days marked by
avoidance of person, but constant, unspoken
questions about what they are thinking. Pos
sibly the most thrilling, rewarding stage.
Cherish it.
How can I be sure that this wonderful,
beautiful experience I call love isn't really
making me terribly unhappy somewhere deep
inside?
The fear that total bliss is constricting your
opportunities and/or maturation as an indi
vidual is a complete sickness, Crito. You are
destined for a life of discontent, regret and
painfully expensive calls to that Jean Dixon
900-number. Save yourself the pain and
become a lawyer.
What do I do for Valentine's Day if I'm in a
long-distance relationship, and what role will
Merlin Olson wind up playing ?
Listen, any relationship where two people
are separated by more than eight or nine inches
is a complete lie. Do yourself a favor and throw
away the fantasy that 3,000 miles (or the lounge
between Paloma and Gavilan) has allowed you
to create. Come back home, Phaedo.
What can I, oh brave thinker, do to put my
life back in some kind of order after being used
as love's bedpan?
There's only one solution to a broken heart,
and that's revenge. That's right, until you get
that other person back, I mean really get them
back, you'll never be free. I mean never. So get
out there, Euthyphro, and do some damage.
Don't be afraid of the police. If they interfere,
use the phrase "domestic dispute." They'll
understand and leave you alone.
Hey, all in all, it's better to have loved and
lost than to spend your Valentine's Day going
stag to the Governor's Corner semi-formal.
But at least it's cheaper.
