# Soundtrack soup tastes okay, but not good enough for seconds

### Ari Richter Senior staff writer 
Welcome to the gumbo soup of
movie soundtracks.
Director Wim Wenders appar
ently took anything he could get
when assembling the soundtrack
for his film "Until the End of the
World," and the soup tastes pret
ty good so long as the listener
doesn't have to lick the bowl clean
and can leave a few ingredients
inside.
The best reason to buy the
soundtrack is that it's the only
place to find the great Talking

Heads song, "Sax and Violins."
Still officially broken up, the band
members briefly reunited to
record this track, which, ironical
ly, may be the best song they've
made since their own film "Stop
Making Sense."
Another hot item on the album
is a Ray Davies composition,
"Days," performed by Elvis Costel
lo. Like many of the songs on the
album, "Days" is about the loss of
a loved one. But unlike some of the
more depressing tracks, "Days"
tries to recall only the good
moments of the past, rather than
dwell on the actual loss:

"Thank you for the days —
those endless days, those sacred
days you gave me. . .. And though
you're gone, you're with me every
single day, believe me."
Visiting the bereavement side
of death is Lou Reed's "What's
Good," which answers its title's
question by saying, "Not much at
all." Faced with the loss of
two friends within a year, Reed
composed an entire album, the
tour de force "Magic and Loss," in
their memory, recounting the
cycle of emotions he went
through — from depression, to
despair, to anger and eventually

to optimism similar to that found
in "Days."
But taken from the early part
of Reed's album — and mixed
with that album's first track, the
instrumental "Dorita" — "What's
Good" is deeply rooted in Reed's
depression phase: "Life's like a
mayonnaise soda/ Life's like space
without room/ Life's like bacon
and ice cream/ That's what life's
like without you."
Joining the Talking Heads,
Reed and Costello songs on the
plus side of "World's" nearly 70
