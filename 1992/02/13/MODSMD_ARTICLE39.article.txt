## Sounds of sexy soul 
### Cheo H. Coker 
Valentine's Day, 6 p.m. Your
honey (or mackdaddy) is on the
way over. The "crib" is spotless,
you look like a million bucks
and you smell better than the
forty ducats you shelled out for
that bottle of Obsession. Only
thing left to do is get set for the
slappin', flippin' and rubbin'
down tonight, right?
Wrong.
Oh yeah, the slow jams! Let's
scan your music selection: Ice
Cube, Blacksheep, Cypress Hill,
N.W.A. . . . damn, where is that
Luther Vandross CD? Yep.
Your friend borrowed it and
never gave it back. Three hours
till the moment of truth. What
are you going to do?
RELAX. Let the "Chey-Hoe"
handle it. Here's my version of
"Hey Love," chock-full with
some of the slowest, most inti
mate sounds of sexy soul.
The Oldies
• Stevie Wonder: "You and
I." From the legendary "Talk
ing Book" album. None of that
Teddy Riley "Let's Chill" drivel;
just sparse instrumentation. A
little piano and a whole lot of
Stevie Wonder's soul make this
song unforgettable.
• Minnie Ripperton: "Lovin'
You." Before there was Mariah
Carey, there was Minnie.
Nobody, dead or alive, can hit a
high note like this woman.
Same formula as "Ribbon," a
simple vibraphone line, and the
sweetest voice you've ever
heard. If you are unfamiliar
with this one, check out the sec
ond volume of Rhino Records'
"Soul Hits of the Seventies:
Didn't it Blow Your Mind."
• • Earth, Wind, And Fire:
"Reasons." There are absolute
ly no "reasons" or excuses for
not having this song on your
slow tape. One of the most
beautiful ballads ever recorded.
Plus this is the real Phillip Bai
ley, before he sold out and
joined Phil Collins in that "Easy
Lover" song.
• Always and Forever:

"Heatwave." (NOT the remake
by Whistle.) Nuff said. This
song is a scorcher. The staple of
every single self-respecting
house party. Like all the classics
in this section, it's sweet and
simple: organ, strings and a
brother pourin' out his soul for
his woman. Makes a mutha . . .
wanna sing (Know whut um
sayin?).
• Miles Davis: "Kind of
Blue/John Coltrane: A Love
Supreme." These masterpieces
must be heard in their entirety.
Put 'em on the rack, turn off
the lights, and let the vibe take
you away like Calgon.
Semi-Old
• Luther Vandross: "A House
Is Not A Home." Skinny or
chunky but always funky, most
women can't get enough of ol'
Luther. The soulful quality of
his voice takes this song much
farther than the limited scope of
its instrumentation. Best line:
"Say you gonna be, are you
gonna be, Say you gonna Be, are
you gonna be?!, Say you gonna
be-ee ee...Dope!
• The Isley Brothers:
"Between The Sheets." A fat,
more up-tempo slow jam. The
song combines a funky key
board bass line and a nice little
drum kick; tailor-made for the
slow grind. Words couldn't do
this song justice.
• Prince: "Do Me Baby";
"How Come You Don't Call Me
Anymore"; "Adore." Love him
or hate him, his royal badness
creates masterful ballads. "Do
Me" is over eight minutes of
heavy-breathing ecstasy. "Call"
is perhaps his most beautiful,
yet least known, love song.
"Adore," without question, is a
masterpiece that defies explana
tion. My pick for three in a row.
• Shirley Murdock: "As We
Lay." The original O.P.P.
cheatin' your woman (or man)
never felt so sinfully justifiable
(or good!). Perfect for that
afterglow effect.
• A Tribe Called Quest:

"Bonita Applebum." The first real
hip-hop ballad since LL Cool J's "I
Need Love." Soft enough for the
ladies, but funky enough for the
fellas.
Newer Stuff
• Stevie Wonder: "Make Sure
You're Sure." Stevie's best ballad
since "Ribbon In The Sky." Clas
sic formula: strings, piano, brush
es and Stevie's voice. The song,
like his girl's lips in the song, is so

divine.
• BoyzllMen: "Uhh Ahh." Nice
to hear some cats who can really
sing with some integrity, no more
of that "My, My, My" b.s. by
Johnny "I Can't Dance" Gill.
There you have it. If these
songs don't get a rise out of your
date, you'd better call the
paramedics; they're dead. While
the list is incomplete (there are
about 40 more songs deserving a
slot), any one of these selections
will get you much farther than "I
Adore (Mi Amor)" ever will.
Happy Valentine's Day; protect
yourself or end up tragic like
Magic. I'm out.

Happy Valentine's Day; protect
yourself or end up tragic like
Magic. I'm out.
Valentine's Day, 6 p.m. Your
honey (or mackdaddy) is on the
way over. The "crib" is spotless,
you look like a million bucks
and you smell better than the
forty ducats you shelled out for
that bottle of Obsession. Only
thing left to do is get set for the
slappin', flippin' and rubbin'
down tonight, right?
Wrong.
Oh yeah, the slow jams! Let's
scan your music selection: Ice
Cube, Blacksheep, Cypress Hill,
N.W.A. . . . damn, where is that
Luther Vandross CD? Yep.
Your friend borrowed it and
never gave it back. Three hours
till the moment of truth. What
are you going to do?
RELAX. Let the "Chey-Hoe"
handle it. Here's my version of
"Hey Love," chock-full with
some of the slowest, most inti
mate sounds of sexy soul.
The Oldies
• Stevie Wonder: "You and
I." From the legendary "Talk
ing Book" album. None of that
Teddy Riley "Let's Chill" drivel;
just sparse instrumentation. A
little piano and a whole lot of
Stevie Wonder's soul make this
song unforgettable.
• Minnie Ripperton: "Lovin'
You." Before there was Mariah
Carey, there was Minnie.
Nobody, dead or alive, can hit a
high note like this woman.
Same formula as "Ribbon," a
simple vibraphone line, and the
sweetest voice you've ever
heard. If you are unfamiliar
with this one, check out the sec
ond volume of Rhino Records'
"Soul Hits of the Seventies:
Didn't it Blow Your Mind."
• • Earth, Wind, And Fire:
"Reasons." There are absolute
ly no "reasons" or excuses for
not having this song on your
slow tape. One of the most
beautiful ballads ever recorded.
Plus this is the real Phillip Bai
ley, before he sold out and
joined Phil Collins in that "Easy
Lover" song.
• Always and Forever:

"Heatwave." (NOT the remake
by Whistle.) Nuff said. This
song is a scorcher. The staple of
every single self-respecting
house party. Like all the classics
in this section, it's sweet and
simple: organ, strings and a
brother pourin' out his soul for
his woman. Makes a mutha . . .
wanna sing (Know whut um
sayin?).
• Miles Davis: "Kind of
Blue/John Coltrane: A Love
Supreme." These masterpieces
must be heard in their entirety.
Put 'em on the rack, turn off
the lights, and let the vibe take
you away like Calgon.
Semi-Old
• Luther Vandross: "A House
Is Not A Home." Skinny or
chunky but always funky, most
women can't get enough of ol'
Luther. The soulful quality of
his voice takes this song much
farther than the limited scope of
its instrumentation. Best line:
"Say you gonna be, are you
gonna be, Say you gonna Be, are
you gonna be?!, Say you gonna
be-ee ee...Dope!
• The Isley Brothers:
"Between The Sheets." A fat,
more up-tempo slow jam. The
song combines a funky key
board bass line and a nice little
drum kick; tailor-made for the
slow grind. Words couldn't do
this song justice.
• Prince: "Do Me Baby";
"How Come You Don't Call Me
Anymore"; "Adore." Love him
or hate him, his royal badness
creates masterful ballads. "Do
Me" is over eight minutes of
heavy-breathing ecstasy. "Call"
is perhaps his most beautiful,
yet least known, love song.
"Adore," without question, is a
masterpiece that defies explana
tion. My pick for three in a row.
• Shirley Murdock: "As We
Lay." The original O.P.P.
cheatin' your woman (or man)
never felt so sinfully justifiable
(or good!). Perfect for that
afterglow effect.
• A Tribe Called Quest:

"Bonita Applebum." The first real
hip-hop ballad since LL Cool J's "I
Need Love." Soft enough for the
ladies, but funky enough for the
fellas.
Newer Stuff
• Stevie Wonder: "Make Sure
You're Sure." Stevie's best ballad
since "Ribbon In The Sky." Clas
sic formula: strings, piano, brush
es and Stevie's voice. The song,
like his girl's lips in the song, is so

divine.
• BoyzllMen: "Uhh Ahh." Nice
to hear some cats who can really
sing with some integrity, no more
of that "My, My, My" b.s. by
Johnny "I Can't Dance" Gill.
There you have it. If these
songs don't get a rise out of your
date, you'd better call the
paramedics; they're dead. While
the list is incomplete (there are
about 40 more songs deserving a
slot), any one of these selections
will get you much farther than "I
Adore (Mi Amor)" ever will.
