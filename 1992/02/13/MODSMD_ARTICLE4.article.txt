# Survey says – 60 percent of students cheat
## 
### Anna Buchmann Staff writer 
Despite the fact that Stanford ranks among
the academically elite universities, one
researcher has found it is "about average" in
one regard: cheating.
"Stanford's overall level of self-reported cheat
ing is pretty typical" for a school with an honor
code, said Donald McCabe, professor of business
and management at Rutgers University.
McCabe reached this conclusion after con
ducting a random study of undergraduates at
31 American universities, including the Uni
versity of Virginia, Duke, Columbia, North
western and Tufts. Of the schools, he found

that 14 have honor codes.
The 1990 survey asked students if they had
ever employed methods including copying
from another student during a test or copying
a few sentences of material for a paper with
out attributing them.
More general questions included how fre
quent students perceived cheating to be at
their school and what factors might influence
a student's decision to cheat or not to cheat.
Overall, McCabe said, 67 percent of the stu
dents "admitted to cheating at least once as an
undergraduate." However, at schools with honor
codes only 57 percent reported cheating, while
78 percent at schools without honor codes did.
Slightly more than 60 percent of the 219

Stanford undergraduates surveyed admitted
to having cheated at least once, he said.
McCabe found that Stanford students tend
to cheat more in non-test situations, such as
essays and take-home work, than students at
other schools with honor codes. However, they
were much less likely to cheat on tests than
students at those schools.
Peggy Bowers, a doctoral candidate and
teaching assistant in communication, said
cheating does not occur when students write
papers for her classes. "Humanities students
don't cheat, because unless the instructor
is a moron or an idiot, he's going to see"
that the student copied material
on an essay, she said.
Asst. Prof. Michael Martin,
who teaches an introductory
statistics class, said he is "amazed
at the rate of honesty" at Stan
ford. However, he said he has
been approached by a student
who said others were cheating
during a test.
"It's a funny thing, because the
Honor Code says we should treat
these people like adults," Martin
said. "But what rational adult,
given the opportunity to cheat,
wouldn't?"
According to McCabe's study,
Stanford students think they are
not likely to be caught cheating.
They also reported that if they
were caught, they thought the
penalties for cheating would not
be severe.
The penalty for a Stanford stu
dent's first cheating violation is a
no-credit grade for the course and
a one-quarter suspension, accord
ing to Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole.
About half the students,
accused of cheating at Stanford
are actually penalized, Cole said.
Although the burden of proof for
cheating offenses is heavy, many
students admit their guilt and
thus negate the proof require
ment, she said.
Cole said 18 students faced
University judicial proceedings
for cheating offenses last year.
She said this number was not
unusual — in fact, when she com

pared McCabe's results with the
number of violations in previous
years, she found that Stanford is
"remarkable for its lack of change
over the past 30 years."
Cheating is more prevalent in
the "hard sciences" such as math
and especially in computer sci
ence, according to Cole.
Professor Jeffrey Ullman,
chair of Stanford's Computer Sci
ence Department, said that
because "Stanford students do
not understand what it means to
plagiarize a (computer) program,"

about one-third of the school's
cheating cases come from his
area. "Ever since I came here, in
1979, it's been ridiculously bad,"
he said.
In McCabe's general survey,
business students and students
who intended to go to business
school had the highest incidence
of self-reported cheating.
McCabe offered several expla
nations for this fact, most notably
the comparatively higher impor
tance business students give to
the goal of financial well-being.

"It's my opinion ... that busi
ness students are really into this
'bottom-line' mentality," in which
end result is what matters,
McCabe added.
Kevin O'Marah, a Stanford
MBA student, agreed that "there
is a definite bottom-line mentali
ty" in the business school. Howev
er, he said that because business
students are encouraged to be
"light-hearted about grades,"
cheating does not occur.
In fact, cheating is "unethical
and downright stupid," he said.
According to McCabe, students
often rationalize cheating as
"somebody else's fault." He added
that one factor that students con
sidered important in their deci
sion to cheat is the perception
that other students are cheating.
"The excuses are just too con
venient," he said.
McCabe said honor codes tend
to be less effective at larger
schools, although Cole contended
that Stanford is a notable excep
tion.
A sense of community respon
sibility at small, single-sex honor
code schools like Mount Holyoke
and Smith leads students to view
the university as the victim of
cheating, McCabe said. "It's not
them against the institution,"
McCabe said. "They're cheating
against each other."
Both McCabe and Cole will
participate in a conference of sur
vey participants at Rutgers in
early March to determine "the
things on individual college cam
puses that are working and are
exportable" to other schools in
promoting academic honesty,
Cole said.
