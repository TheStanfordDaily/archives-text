Despite the fact that Stanford ranks among
the academically elite universities, one
researcher has found it is "about average" in
one regard: cheating.
"Stanford's overall level of self-reported cheat
ing is pretty typical" for a school with an honor
code, said Donald McCabe, professor of business
and management at Rutgers University.
McCabe reached this conclusion after con
ducting a random study of undergraduates at
31 American universities, including the Uni
versity of Virginia, Duke, Columbia, North
western and Tufts. Of the schools, he found

that 14 have honor codes.
The 1990 survey asked students if they had
ever employed methods including copying
from another student during a test or copying
a few sentences of material for a paper with
out attributing them.
More general questions included how fre
quent students perceived cheating to be at
their school and what factors might influence
a student's decision to cheat or not to cheat.
Overall, McCabe said, 67 percent of the stu
dents "admitted to cheating at least once as an
undergraduate." However, at schools with honor
codes only 57 percent reported cheating, while
78 percent at schools without honor codes did.
Slightly more than 60 percent of the 219

Stanford undergraduates surveyed admitted
to having cheated at least once, he said.
McCabe found that Stanford students tend
to cheat more in non-test situations, such as
essays and take-home work, than students at
other schools with honor codes. However, they
were much less likely to cheat on tests than
students at those schools.
Peggy Bowers, a doctoral candidate and
teaching assistant in communication, said
cheating does not occur when students write
papers for her classes. "Humanities students
don't cheat, because unless the instructor
is a moron or an idiot, he's going to see"
