# In the 'Final Analysis,' this one's flaccid
## 
### Matt Berson 
This year's much ballyhooed
psychosexual thriller falls a bit
short of its seat-hangers and
sweaty palms. A script drawing
from the best of Hitchcock and a
flashy cast aren't enough to
push "Final Analysis" up from
the crowded ranks of mediocre
films.
The film stars pretty man
Richard Gere as a psychiatrist
who gets sucked into a Venus fly
trap consisting of seductive and
misleading sisters Diana (Uma
Thurman) and Heather (Kim
Basinger) Evans. These money
grubbing siblings lead the good
hearted shrink from a routine
couch session into a world of
murder.
Seems Basinger has gone tem
porarily insane due to consump
tion of alcohol and has innocent
ly killed her husband. Gere vol
unteers his help and all he gets in
return is a one night stand (with
stand-ins), a brush with black
mail, and a little bit wet.
All we get is a lot of pretty San
Francisco and Marin scenery as
Gere runs around trying to free
himself from the grips of the ter
rible twosome and their ceaseless
conniving.
Gere discovers that all isn't
what it seems in his girlfriend's
open and shut case and spends

the rest of the movie chasing and
being chased around the spiral
staircase of a condemned light
house. This should be thrilling, I
guess, but director Phil Janou of
U2's "Rattle and Hum" infamy
doesn't even manage to make it
exciting.
Both Gere and Basinger
punch in with fairly lackluster
performances, and most of their
scenes are upstaged by that
darned lighthouse.
Eric Roberts pilots a fine sup
porting cast as Basinger's tanta
lizingly twisted gangster hus
band. He says of his wife, "I got
damaged goods," and he then
proceeds to further the damage.
Thurman is slightly over
looked in her first mainstream
role, much to the disappointment
of her growing legion of fans.
Regardless of its consistent
shortcomings, "Final Analysis,"
with its mediocre thrills and
penny-pinching passion, is going
to be huge. I guess it's like most
things now; your expectations
almost always exceed the reali
ties.
From its James Bond opening,
which plays like a farce of the dis
appointments to come; through
its Freudian slips about violence
(I mean violets, I said violates); to
its waterlogged ending, "Final
Analysis" is a long sip of soda
without the pop.

"Final Analysis." But Where's Uma?
