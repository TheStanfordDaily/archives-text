# Wayne pursues his fantasies in Cantonese

"Wayne's World," the feature film based on the
"Saturday Night Live" sketches of the same
name, is the perfect film to see if you arrive at the
movie theater 20 or 30 minutes late.
That's because the first part of the movie reveals
what every Wayne fan secretly fears is true: Wayne
Campbell (Mike Myers) is indeed an annoying, aim
less deadbeat outside of the basement where his
public-access cable show takes place.
But, lucky for us, that changes when Wayne
begins to realize his twin fantasies of snagging the
beautiful frontwoman of a heavy-metal band and
getting paid to do his show.
From the moment Wayne shows off his newly
acquired Cantonese to his prospective lady love

(Tia Carrere), the best aspect of the SNL sketches
comes alive on the big screen.
The film's pleasure derives from the juxtaposi
tion of pop culture, ranging from "Scooby Doo" to
"The Terminator," with such lofty references as
Kierkegaard and the historical origins of Milwaukee
(from the mouth of rocker Alice Cooper, no less).
Sadly, Dana Carvey's Garth, Wayne's squirrely
hormonal sidekick, is the colossal geek we've
always suspected he was. Like the people in the
movie, you wouldn't want to hang around him if
he weren't with Wayne.
By taking the humor beyond juvenile puns and
gratuitous use of the word "sphincter," the latter
portion of "Wayne's World" scores. It offers a
solid hour of thoroughly amusing entertainment,
but unfortunately asks you to sit through a half
hour of boredom to get to it.
