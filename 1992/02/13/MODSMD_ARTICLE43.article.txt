# Connery's talent lost in the jungle
## 
### Victor Haseman 
After seeing "Medicine Man" I am convinced
that John McTiernan is a businessman, not a
director. The result of his profit-motivated efforts
is a stunningly filmed environmental drama that
suffers from predictability.
The most annoying aspect of this film is its use
of acting talent in shallow roles. Seasoned bio
chemist Dr. Robert Campbell (Sean Connery) has
found a cure for cancer, "the plague of the 20th
century," but can't reproduce it. In a desperate
attempt to regain the cure, Campbell requests the
assistance of three male colleagues back in the
States.
Dr. Rae Crane (Lorraine Brocca of "Goodfel
las") is the company's answer.
What follows is an awful mimicking of a
"Romancing the Stone" type love affair. But here
the lovers must resolve their personal differences

in order to save a child dying of cancer and prevent
the impending destruction of the rain forest in
which the cure is discovered.
The other 57 characters, naked "savages," cater
to Campbell's ego as a great "Medicine Man" and
season the film with the sour flavor of a National
Geographic Special.
The blase predictability of Tom Sculman's
screenplay surprised me. After making a name for
himself as the principal writer for "Dead Poets
Society," why would he want to write a solid but
artistically barren script?
"Medicine Man's" second flaw is its dependence
on past films. The only thing McTiernan succeeds
in doing is synthesizing the plot of every jungle
movie that has popped up in the last ten years.
In other words, McTiernan, best known for
"Rambo" and "Predator," clearly spent a dispro
portionate amount of time developing the film's
backdrop as opposed to its characters and plot.
