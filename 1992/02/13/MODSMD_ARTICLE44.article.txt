# Obsession doesn't always smell so good
## 
### Brad Bruner Staff writer 
Getting flowers or candy from an admirer
on Valentine's Day is not exactly unheard of,
but what happens when the infatuated party
has more motivation than a normal crush?
Although they don't quite match the cal
iber of the psychotic bunny-boiler of "Fatal
Attraction" or any of the intertwined bodies
from those Calvin Klein ads, obsessive lovers
do exist at Stanford.
A 1 Cooper, a clinicial pyschologist at Coun
seling and Psychological Services, said he and
his staff see both undergraduates and gradu
ate students who are trying to deal to deal
with infatuation gone past normal limits.
"People often think that Stanford students,
because of their intellectual ability, don't have
the same problems with such behaviors as the
general population," Cooper said. "But they
do, and sometimes even to a greater extent.
"Most students here are really bright, but
some have come out of high school or even
other universities not socially connected,"
Cooper added. "The process of looking for a
connection [can always be problematic!."
Cooper, who is also the clinical director of
the San Jose Marital and Sexuality Centre,
said he has seen obsessive cases at Stanford
ranging from "people literally camping out
side someone else's door" to vindictive stu
dents calling up others with threats.
Especially with undergraduates, Cooper
said he typically sees obsessive traits stem
ming from a "first love kind of situation."
Here, people fixate because they believe that
this first opportunity will somehow be their
only chance for love. Many people do not real
ize that the first experience is often just a
beginning and not an end, Cooper said.
Some of the older students Cooper sees
seem to be isolated or lacking social skills, and
have entered a phase he terms "socially
facile." These students crave inclusion into a
social setting that has been previously denied
them and may seek companionship aggres
sively.
Professor Rene Girard, chair of the French
and Italian Department, studies cases of
obsessive love in European literature and cul

ture. To explain the phenomenon, he has for
warded the concept of "mimetic desire."
According to Professor Girard, what we
normally consider obsessive love actually
hinges on "the mechanics of desire," some
thing "the psychologists don't talk about," he
said.
Desire is different from love, Girard
explained, and people naturally learn to desire
by emulating "their neighbor." Every "neigh
bor" is potentially a rival, and "obsessive love
is always tied up to the presence of a rival," he
said.
Whenever someone is faced with a rival
vying for the same object of love, "the value of
the object desired is going to increase compet
itively, like in the stock market," Girard said.
"Everybody wants it, therefore I have to have
it, at all costs."
From the point of view of the person being
followed, however, the process of escape from
obsessive love may not be so easy.
"Donna," a Stanford undergraduate, has

just recently freed herself from an obsessive
situation in which a casual friend rapidly
became an unwanted and grossly over-persis
tent suitor.
Her friend was a shy young man with tra
ditional, religious values, intoxicated by
Donna's extroverted personality and no-non
sense attitude.
When his intentions very obviously became
amorous, she told him firmly that their differ
ences would prevent things from ever working
themselves out.
Rather than accepting her reasoning,
"Albert" began to wage an all-out campaign to
convince her that she should change to be like
him. She found him waiting for her after every
class, and his love sonnets and letters dis
paraging her other suitors came pouring in.
He showed up during her shifts at work,
where she was practically trapped, and
refused to go away. When this did not work, he
began to get more frustrated and even called
her roommate to talk about what a "bitch"
Donna was.
The situation only resolved itself when
Albert stumbled upon her in the presence of
another man and finally withdrew for good.
"I was very frightened by the implications
of everything he did," she said. "Though he
claimed to be 'in love,-' the situation was the
exact opposite of what love's supposed to be
about."
Residence Dean Angela Rickford, a resident
fellow in Kimball Hall, said she normally sees
two to three cases per year that could be cate
gorized as obsessive.
Rickford said she and her staff usually deal
with such problems by talking to the students
first. If the staff determines that a real prob
lem does exist, the staff sets limits that usual
ly keep the students away from each other,
Rickford said.
Other cases probably occur, Rickford said,
but are minor enough to be handled by resi
dent assistants alone or by the "involved par
ties" themselves.
Donna said she never reported her situa
tion to Residential Education, because she
thought the harassment would be too subtle
to prove. Instead, she hoped the situation
would work itself out.
