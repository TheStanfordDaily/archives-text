# What makes a home 'sweet'?
## Costly study explores student preferences 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
Housing and Food Services has contract
ed an independent market research firm to
find out what students like and dislike
about their University housing options.
The results of the survey — being con
ducted by Genesis Research Associates of
San Jose — will be used to guide construc
tion of new student dorms.
Among other things, the survey may
determine whether students prefer small
houses or large dormitories, and if they
want sinks or computer connections in
their rooms.
"We've been encouraged to make deci
sions with objective survey data as a basis,"
said Keith Guy, Director of Housing Man
agement. "This is the first time Housing
has used a market survey to gather student
opinion."
The project will include meetings with
"focus groups" made up of students and a
telephone survey of approximately 1,000
students.
Focus group participants, who are meet
ing this week with researchers, were
offered $25 for their participation in the
two-hour discussion section. Students who
are contacted in the telephone survey will
not be compensated.

Neither Guy nor Genesis representatives
would say how much the project will cost.
But Mike Green, president of Direct
Marketing Research Associates, a market
research firm in Palo Alto, said a survey of
that magnitude "would run about $55,000
or $60,000 at current market prices."
Planners of future student residences
hope to discover through the survey what
elements influence students' decisions
about where to live.
Specifically, they are interested in how
students weigh such factors as location,
house size, room size, house themes, build
ing age and board plans.
Planners are also interested in student
opinion regarding continued occupancy, an
option currently unavailable in the Draw.
Once housing is guaranteed for all four
years for undergraduates, continued occu
pancy — the option to reserve the same
room for the following year — may become
a viable alternative. Other proposed
changes to the lottery system are also being
discussed in the focus groups.
The focus group phase, which will be
completed this week, consists of discus
sions of housing preferences by six focus
groups. There are two groups-each of fresh
men, upperclassmen and graduate stu-
dents, with eight participants per
group.
Information gathered from
these groups will be used to for
mulate questions for the tele
phone survey. Students will then
be contacted by telephone later
this month, according to Guy.
He said students will be called
randomly for the survey, which
should take between 15 and 25 min
utes for each student to complete.
Results of the phone survey
will be incorporated into a com
prehensive long-range facilities
renewal plan to be presented to
the Board of Trustees in June.

"The value of this is an invest
ment in getting data," said Guy.
"We want an objective sense of
what students think."
Student reaction to the survey
was mixed. While some suggested
student opinion could be solicited
less expensively by distributing
questionnaires in the residences,
others said the survey might be
worth the cost.
Guy expressed concern that
students may confuse the upcom
ing survey with recent prank calls
reported on campus, where a man
told women students he was tak
ing a health survey and then
asked increasingly personal ques
tions about sexual matters.
"This is legitimate," said Guy.
"We hope we'll be able to get
results."
