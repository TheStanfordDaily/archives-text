# Early retirement offered to avoid massive layoffs

Trying to decrease potential
layoffs due to budget cuts,
Human Resources is temporarily
extending the eligibility require
ments for early retirement to
encourage employees to leave
their positions voluntarily.
Approximately 1,200 of the
University's 8,000 staff members
will be eligible for early retire
ment, according to Maryann Men
donza, the project manager for
the benefits program.
Human Resources expects
approximately 400 people to
apply, she said.
Early retirement is being
extended "to provide a positive
alternative to layoffs and recog
nize long-service employees," said
Benefits Manager Jim Franklin.
"I think it's a good idea and
I'm planning on taking advantage
of it," said Peter Sylvester, an
associate director of the Office of
Development who has been at
Stanford for 31 years. "We're for
tunate to have a contributory
plan such as this."
With the University restruc
turing to accommodate a smaller
budget, layoffs are a real possibil
ity, Franklin said. He empha
sized, however, that it is too early
to know exactly how many layoffs
the early retirement program will
prevent.
Eligible staff members can
apply for the Staff Early Retire

ment Incentives program from
March 15 through August 31.
Currently, staff members who are
at least 55 years old, have at least
10 years service and work at least
half-time are eligible.
Under the new plan, benefits
will be extended to anyone whose
age and years of service add up to
75.
Supplemental cash payments,
based on years of service, will be
paid to those who elect for early
retirement. The minimum pay
ment will be four months' salary
for those who with at least 10
years of service, and 12 months'
salary for those with 25 years of
service, Franklin said.
Staff members will still receive
the traditional retirement bene
fits under the new program.
These include medical coverage,
the tuition grant program — a
benefit which offers tuition for
retirees with dependent children
in college — and other benefits
such as continued use of libraries
and athletic facilities and dis
counts for athletic events.
Under the early retirement
guidelines, staff members need
not be eligible at the time they
apply for early retirement, but
must have met the qualifications
by August 31, 1993.
Once individuals elect for early
retirement, they will work with
the University to determine what
works best regarding the terms of
