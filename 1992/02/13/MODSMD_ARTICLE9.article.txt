L.A. floods claim five lives
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The latest in a
series of storms smashed ashore yesterday,
causing flash floods that washed motor homes
out to sea and mudslides that suffocated a cou
ple asleep in their bed.
Gov. Pete Wilson declared a state of emer
gency in Los Angeles and Ventura counties and
the City of Los Angeles. "Clearly a state of
extreme peril to both persons and property
exists," he said.
The declaration allows state personnel and
equipment, including National Guardsmen, to
help local relief efforts. It also clears the way
for people to obtain state assistance, such as
low-interest loans for repairs.
The storms, among the worst in 100 years,
claimed at least five lives and damaged dozens
of homes in four counties by yesterday. Author
ities searched for more victims, including two
skiers feared buried by an avalanche.
In the Riverside County community of
Temecula, firefighters rescued two youths who
were washed a quarter-mile through a storm
culvert, Evans said. They were taken to Inland
Valley Medical Center.
Citizens help 'hero' cabbie
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Angry citizens
gathered to give a hero's welcome to the San
Francisco cabbie who knocked down a purse
snatcher and then collided with a $25,000 jury
award to the wounded criminal.
Cabbie Chuck Hollom was first hailed as a
hero in 1989 when he intervened in a mugging.
But last week, a San Francisco Superior Court
jury found that Hollom used excessive force
when he pinned Ocie James McClure to a wall
with his cab after seeing McClure attack a
Japanese tourist and grab her purse. McClure
broke his leg.
