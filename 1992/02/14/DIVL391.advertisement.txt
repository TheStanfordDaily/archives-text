Above the broken spears and "heroes' mounds and fires which warms the
bleeding youth of Greece, the fairest face the world had seen looks out
on Priam's realm, by her own lord besieged. She sees, and cries and sighs,
and then she leaves to task her minds and state her husband's needs.
In modern courts, a new force fights for justice armed with wit and will.
When she comes home to rooms aglow with music, warmth and trust,
our children read and I lord O'er the stove. And sometimes when we're
making love, whispering love, gazing love, her eyes shed joy's Salt sting.
Old beauty, prize and casualty of war:
the greatest beauty's one which creates more.
