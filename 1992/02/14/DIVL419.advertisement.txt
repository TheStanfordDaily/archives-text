WE'RE TELLING
AN ENTIRE
INDUSTRY
WHERE TO GO.
If you want to know where the
world of computing is headed, take a
close look at MIPS.
Thanks to our engineering excel
lence, a new class of advanced com
puter systems is emerging. Systems that
will be based on truly open standards,
in partnership with companies like
DEC, Microsoft, NEC and Compaq.
Systems that will include the industry's
largest base of applications, advanced
compiler and networking capabilities,
plus extraordinary microprocessor
technology.
MIPS is leading the way into a new
era of computing. And now you can be
part of it thanks to the following
opportunities.
• Pi ocessor Design Engineer
• Processor Verification Engineer
• Systems Design Engineer
• SW/Compilers and
Language Engineer
• Quality Assurance Engineer
• CAD Engineer
FOLLOW A LEADER.
Help determine the future of
computing at MIPS. We'll be conduct
ing on-campus interviews on Wednes
day, March 4. Schedule your interview
by signing up at the Career Planning &
Placement Center on Wednesday,
February 19. Or, send your resume
to MIPS Computer Systems, Inc.,
College Relations, 950 DeGuine Drive,
Sunnyvale, CA 94088-3650. We arc an
