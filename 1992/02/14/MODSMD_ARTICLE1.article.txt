# Bookstore board member resigns over perks flap
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Sociology Prof. Sanford Dornbusch
resigned from the Stanford Bookstore's
board of directors Wednesday, citing a
sharp disagreement with the rest of the
board over the way it has handled embar
rassing disclosures about the Bookstore's
compensation practices.
Dornbusch, in his letter of resignation,
criticizes the "legalistic direction" the
Bookstore's board took Tuesday when it
announced it was hiring outside lawyers
and accountants to review the store's prac
tice of providing lavish perquisites to its

senior employees.
"I was upset by what we did not do,"
Dornbusch says in his letter. "The board
will have serious problems, starting almost
immediately. I cannot see myself defending
yesterday's board and management actions
as a full response. Accordingly, I hereby
resign from the board."
The decision to hire outside legal and
accounting help was prompted by disclo
sures in The Daily last week that the Book
store provides several of its employees with
use of a vacation home, a motor home, a
sailboat and top-of-the-line automobiles â€”
practices unheard of elsewhere in the col
lege bookstore industry.

The Bookstore leases both the vacation
home and the motor home from a consult
ing firm privately owned by Eldon Speed,
the store's general manager, and Philip
Chiaramonte, its assistant manager.
In his letter, Dornbusch criticizes the
Bookstore's board for not having taken
more immediate, concrete actions in
response to the disclosures. "We passed up
an opportunity to increase the communi
ty's trust in the integrity of management
and the board," he says.
Putting off decisions until after lejgal
and accounting reviews are completed,
Dornbusch says, "will lead to an extended
period of concern about the Bookstore,

attacks on the character of management,
and, in general, slow bleeding."
Dornbusch, who has been on the Book
store's board of directors for the last 20
years, does not say in his letter of resignation
what actions he would have preferred the
board take Tuesday. Nor would he discuss
the matter in a brief interview yesterday.
Dornbusch and other board members
have indicated over the past few days that
they were not fully aware of the perquisites
the store provides to senior employees.
Dornbusch told Stanford News Service
that he had apparently missed the meeting

in the mid-1980s where the
arrangement on the vacation home
was approved. He called the Book
store's lease of the home owned by
Speed and Chiaramonte's consult
ing firm "a dumb arrangement
because it looks like there was sub
terfuge and there wasn't."
Dornbusch's letter of resigna
tion is addressed to Speed,
Chiaramonte and History Prof.
Peter Stansky, the current presi
dent of the Bookstore's board.
Stansky said yesterday that he
regretted Dornbusch's decision,
but added that said he "stands by
the decisions" the board made
Tuesday. Dornbusch "will cer
tainly be missed," Stansky said.

Stansky said it was not clear
when Dornbusch would be replaced.
Stansky said that he has no
immediate plans to resign as pres
ident of the Bookstore's board,
but has not ruled out such a
move. "If the Bookstore takes up
too much of my time, I might
resign," he said.
Stansky said he had only spent
about 12 hours a year on Bookstore
matters prior to last week's disclo
sures. Since then, he he has
spent "thousands of hours" address
ing Bookstore-related concerns.
The Bookstore is a tax-exempt,
nonprofit corporation run inde
pendently of the University and
overseen by a board of seven
Stanford faculty, staff members
and students.
Dornbusch said yesterday that,
despite his resignation, he has
"full faith in the integrity" of the

Bookstore management and board
of directors. "I really believe that
everybody has been behaving in
good faith and that eventually this
will be all worked out," he said.
In addition to Stansky, Book
store board members are: Agnes
Peterson, a Hoover Institution
curator; Nancy Padgett, assistant
dean of Humanities and Sciences;
Robert Weisberg, a Stanford law
professor; and Kevin Murakami and
Sammie Speigner, both students.
Dornbusch, 65, has been a soci
ology professor at Stanford since
1959, when he was named the
first chair of the Department of
Sociology.
He is currently the director of the
Stanford Center for the Study of
Families, Children and Youth. The
center recently released the results
of an exhaustive two-year study on
homeless children.
