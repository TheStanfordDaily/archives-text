# Rains didn't help lake much

Despite causing a few leaky
roofs, this week's rain didn't affect
the water level in Lake Lagunita.
According to Julie Hardin, an
analyst for Operations and Mainte
nance, it will take several more
storms before the lake is to be filled.
"We've had a significant amount
of rain, and it has obviously helped,
but I*ike Lag won't be filled unless
Felt fills up," Hardin said.
Felt is located in the Foothills
on the west side of Highway 280.

The water level in Felt Lake is
currently 45.5 feet. It is consid
ered full at 52 feet. Felt Lake is a
source of non-potable irrigation
water for Stanford, and excess
water from Felt Lake would be
used to fill Lake Lagunita.
The rain has caused about 20
leaks in the roofs of academic
buildings around campus, accord
ing to Rich Stevens, a facilities
manager for Operations and Main
tenance. "The excessive rain just
pushed the roof gutters and drains
to their capacity," Stevens said.
"When there's not much rain

for the greater part of the year,
it's hard to know what condition
the roofs are in, and it's hard to
create a meaningful maintenance
program," he added.
Palm Drive experienced some
flooding earlier this week when a
drain near its intersection with
Palo Road broke, according to
Grounds Manager Herb Fong.
"The drainage system in this
area is minimal, and the storms
have produced more water than
the drainage capacity could han
dle," Fong said, adding that the
problem has since been solved.
