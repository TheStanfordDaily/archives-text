# Faculty Senate discusses budget cuts, tuition increase
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate yesterday finished its
formal discussions of the University's budget
reduction proposals, focusing on the Legal
Office, tuition hikes and the future of the
arts.
Yesterday's meeting was not regularly
scheduled and was called to address arts and
support services, the two cross-cutting issues
not discussed last week.
Classics Prof. Marsh McCall told the senate
that "$558,000 still remain to be cut" from the
Legal Office.
But he asserted that "the Legal Office is
not cutting its budget by a single dollar."
Instead, it merely transferred one of its func
tions to another area of the University,
according to McCall.
"The number one fact in budget cuts is that
you cannot transfer things to other depart
ments and call it a budget cut," he said.
But Law School Prof. Robert Weisberg, a
member of the Law School budget liaison
team that helped plan the school's budget
cuts, said the move was legitimate.
Another issue that attracted debate during
the meeting was next year's 7.5 percent
undergraduate tuition increase, which was
announced Tuesday.
The issue was raised by Council of Presi

[Library and Information Resources]," she
said.
"Humanities is balancing on a razor's
edge," Wack said. "The humanities faculty
could be just general educators, or we can try
to keep a first-class research faculty."
Yet not all faculty response to budget cuts
were negative. Political Science Prof. Stephen
Krasner said he would not have agreed with
across-the-board cuts three months ago, but
he said the current cuts appear to be across
the board and are "not so bad."
Faculty still said they were concerned
about cuts in the fine arts departments, one of
the more contested areas during the budget
cutting process.
The fine arts faculty has had "mixed
responses" to cuts, said English Prof. George
Dekker, chair of the cabinet budget commit
tee's fine arts task force.
"There is a feeling of relief because the cuts
are not as severe as they might have been,"
Dekker said. "On the other hand, there is a
high degree of depression as 112 faculty) contem
plate the degree of the cuts."
Overdeck asked how cuts will be imple
mented in the arts, saying that drama
remained a concern of many students. Assoc.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences Carolyn
Lougee said the school would keep in mind the
"importance of maintaining undergraduate
drama opportunities."
