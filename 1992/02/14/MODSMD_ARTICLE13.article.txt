Rushdie calls for lifting of sentence
LONDON (AP) â€” On the eve of entering his fourth year in
hiding, author Salman Rushdie yesterday renewed his call for the
British government to pressure Iran to lift the death sentence
that drove him underground.
Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called on
Feb. 14, 1989, for devout Muslims to kill Rushdie for allegedly
blaspheming Islam in his book "The Satanic Verses."
Although Khomeini died less than four months later, the
threat of assassination has kept Rushdie in hiding except for occa
sional public appearances.
Rushdie, 44, said in an interview with BBC radio that the
British government must tell Tehran the "terrorist threat
against one of its citizens is not acceptable," and must be lifted
before relations between the two countries will improve.
"It could be done by the snap of a finger, if the will is there,"
Rushdie said.
Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Kamal Kharrazi,
said in November that as far as he was concerned the "Rushdie
affair" was over.
But Kalim Siddiqui, leader of the Muslim Parliament, an orga
nization of Muslims in Great Britain, said in a statement that the
conflict over the book was unresolved.
"I have tried to take some of the heat out of it. But it seems
that Rushdie and his friends are determined to continue piling
insult, abuse and obscenity on us.
"Muslims everywhere will continue to regard Rushdie and his
supporters as Islam's enemy No. 1," he said.
