## Rescind death edict 
### 
On third anniversary of
ban on Rushdie's book,
time to end nightmares

ONE OF THE CRUELEST
Valentine's Day gifts in his
tory was bestowed by the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
exactly three years ago. The recip
ient, author Salman Rushdie, was
relegated to the status of an out
cast and has spent the past three
years in hiding.
Much has happened in the world
since Feb. 14, 1989, but the brute
fact of the fatwa — the religious
edict issued by Khomeini ordering
Rushdie's murder for publishing his
novel, "The Satanic Verses" — still
hangs over the author's head like an
unpleasant nightmare that persists
even after a person wakes up.
Though the fatwa has not been
rescinded, the British have
restored their diplomatic ties with
Iran, ties broken off when Khome
ini first issued his proclamation.
Rushdie is a citizen of a country
that celebrates individual liberty
while maintaining economic rela
tions with Iran despite the fatwa.
The Ayatollah has since passed
away himself, but his edict stands,
denying its target the chance for
peace. Rushdie's life is threatened
and his freedom curtailed, evi
dence that the intimidation and
terroristic tactics have worked.
Though Iran has softened its hos
tile anti-Western stance since the
proclamation, the new political lead
ers have refused to give up this ges
ture of state-sponsored terrorism.
The trail of hatred and violence
unleashed by the fatwa has not
completely subsided. Only last
year, the Italian and Japanese
translators of "The Satanic Vers
es" were murdered. All attempts
by the novel's publishers to bring
out a paperback version have been
aborted by the fear of renewed
bomb attacks on bookstores.
The international community

that so quickly rallied behind the
cause of the Gulf War seems to
have lost interest in defending an
individual's right to free speech in
this important instance. Pressure
has to be sustained on Iran to abol
ish this hateful edict.
There are two crucial political
lessons to be gleaned from the
whole affair.
A first lesson stems from an
examination of the rise in prejudice,
especially in the last couple of years,
against immigrant Muslim popula
tions in the Western liberal democ
racies. Rushdie himself has repeat
edly expressed his anguish over the
manner in which the incident has
been used as an excuse to legitimate
virulent assaults on Asian Muslims
in that country.
The outrage expressed by liber
als against the death sentence has
often manifested itself as blanket
intolerance for Islamic culture in
all its myriad forms. State officials
in Britain and France have issued
public calls for the immediate
assimilation of Muslims.
The second lesson is that we
have to recognize the difference
between censuring speech per
ceived by a community to be hate
ful and the impulse to punish the
perpetrators for that alleged sin.
While the former is a legitimate
course of action, the latter can be
stretched beyond reasonable
bounds, as in Rushdie's case.
This point is not so clear when
one happens to be part of the com
munity whose values have been
deeply offended; Rushdie's fatwa
invoked widespread condemnation
in the West because there are rela
tively few Muslims here.
In both the instances outlined
above, majority opinion is faced
with the danger of inadvertently
mocking the tolerance of diversity,
an idea it claims to hold dear.
Just as Rushdie should not be
murdered for expressing a different
concept of the nature of revealed
religion, his cultural brethren also
must not be persecuted for the reli
gion they practise. Dissenting opin
ion must be allowed a voice.
