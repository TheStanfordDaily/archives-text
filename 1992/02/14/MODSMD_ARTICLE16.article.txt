Diversity in viewpoints exists in the gay community

1 WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND to
Mario Huerta's Feb. 7 letter to The
Daily, as well as to those published in
response to it.
In case there was any misunderstand
ing, it should be understood that there is
no single gay or lesbian "point of view"
on such issues. Huerta's letter was rep
resentative of his own views, but cer
tainly not those of many other gay of les
bian people I know. Like the rest of soci
ety, our viewpoints are diverse and cover
the political spectrum.
For example, while Huerta expressed
his belief that the institution of mar
riage should be abolished, I completely
disagree. Marriage is a valuable institu

tion. Rather than be abolished it should
be extended to all in society.
Marriage is not simply a practical
partnership for purposes of procreation.
It is also a relationship between two peo
ple who are in love and wish to share a
life-long relationship based on love,
trust, honesty and mutual support.
Such a relationship is no different
from any of the gay or lesbian partner
ships with which I am familiar. All we
are missing is the legal status that is cur
rently reserved for heterosexual couples.
It is hypocritical of people to criticize
the gay community for a supposed
lifestyle that we all apparently live — in
the way first-year law student Keith

Rabois recently did — and then deny us
the opportunity to enter into the very
relationship that is held up to us as the
supposed ideal.
Of course, marriage is not the ideal
for every couple. One only needs to look
at the divorce rates and incidence of
extramarital affairs to see that. For that
reason, I would also maintain that the
same opportunities for common law
marital status should also be open to gay
and lesbian couples.
As far as I'm concerned, anyone who
would deny us the right to enter into a
societally-approved relationship has no
right to then criticize us for any real or
imagined "lifestyle" that we might lead

as an alternative.
This, however, is only my view, and I
know that there are many other views
that deserve to be heard. That there is
no single gay or lesbian "point of view"
on these matters is not, however, a rea
son to delay taking any action to combat
heterosexist discrimination.
If disagreement were a reason to
refrain from action, nothing would ever
get done in a democracy. What we need
to do is keep the discussion going, and
never let our disagreements be a reason
to avoid addressing the discrimination
that still pervades this society.
