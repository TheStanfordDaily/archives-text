# Knight fellows praise Bookstore article
## 
### 
The 1991-92 class of professional
journalists in the John S. Knight fel
lowship program applaud the efforts
of The Daily for its excellent inves
tigative report on the "Bookstore
Brass" and the unheard-of perks,
including the lucrative sweetheart
deal enjoyed by Colleagues Manage
ment Services.
The report was thorough, well-docu
mented, well-written and excellently
organized. The photographs add to the
impact of a situation one ordinarily
balanced journalist described as
"obscene."
Your piece has made many of us
think more than twice about buying
books and other merchandise at the
Stanford Bookstore.
Congratulations.
