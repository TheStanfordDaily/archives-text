# Don't abolish families to secure equal rights
## 
### 
As a gay man in American society, I
have learned that every person has the
inalienable right to define themselves,
regardless of what prejudice and stereo
types insist.
I am a gay man, but before that, I am
Jason Menayan, a free-willed individual
whose own drives and ambitions take
precedence over the activist aims of any
community of which I am a member.
Perhaps that is why I am bothered by
Mario Huerta's Feb. 7 letter. Why was I
not consulted when I was lumped togeth
er with all other lesbians, bisexuals and
gays in the declaration of "our" goals?
While I agree that almost everyone in
the lesbian/gay/bisexual community
wants "the rights that will ensure the
liberation of all sexually oppressed sec
tors," I disagree with Huerta's assertion
that he has somehow grasped the intan
gible community spirit in what he sees
as the execution of our goals. Our goals
may be the same, but our means are
most certainly not.

And while I appreciate Huerta's dis
appointment with the social structures,
such as marriage and adoption, which
exclude the legitimacy of a homosexual
union, I personally don't think the
destruction of such structures is neces
sarily the solution to our exclusion.
Administration-sanctioned inclusion of
our existence as demonstrated by the
domestic partners policy is, in my opinion,
a far better avenue by which our rights
can be claimed. The lack of respect for the
loving union of two people just because
one is a man and one is a woman is, by my
standards, disgustingly homosexist.
And I would encourage Seth Dittman
(Letters, Feb. 11) to recognize Huerta's
opinion as just one among many in our
diverse community.
