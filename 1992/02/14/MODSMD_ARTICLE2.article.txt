# Budget deficits remain possible
## Kennedy says University may see 'substantial' shortfalls for 2 years 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Stanford could face new
deficits above and beyond the cur
rent $43-million shortfall, Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
told the Faculty Senate yesterday.
In addition, Kennedy said it is
unlikely that the University's
indirect-cost rate will rise signifi
cantly. Kennedy and other faculty
expressed doubts that graduate
tuition remission would continue,
which could result in the loss of
funding to a quarter of Stanford's
graduate students.
"It is plain that there could be
substantial deficits in the next
two years," Kennedy said. But he
emphasized that the "magnitude
is too difficult to predict" because
of a number of uncertainties.
"The probability is that the com
bined effect | of these issues] could
add up to generate new deficits in
the next two years," he said.
But despite possible deficits,
Kennedy said the Board of
Trustees would not demand new
academic cuts but instead search
for increased revenue.
"The board understands that
the success of the budget-reduc
tion process has left us thin. They
do not support greater academic
cuts," Kennedy said. "I do not feel
pessimistic about the next two

years' deficits, nor do I lack faith
that we would be able to take care
of them without placing an addi
tional burden on academics."
Kennedy listed nine important
factors that could cause new
deficits in the next two years,
including indirect-cost rates,
research volume, tuition remission,
interest rates, retiree medical bene
fits, past indirect-cost liability and
costs of compliance with new feder
al laws.
An indirect-cost rate of 55.5 per
cent for this year is a "virtual cer
tainty," and the "best expected
value" for next year is only 58.5
percent, Kennedy said. Last year's
rate was originally 74 percent
before the federal government
abruptly reduced it in April, result
ing in a $28-million shortfall.
The "volatility of political pro
cesses in resolving" the indirect
cost controversy as well as other
budget issues make "tying down
projections very difficult," Kennedy
said.
Kennedy said questions about
retiree medical benefits and
tuition remission have made the
staff benefit rate uncertain.
Tuition remission is the prac
tice of government reimburse
ment for a portion of the tuition
of graduate students involved in
