# Budget deficits remain possible
## Kennedy says University may see 'substantial' shortfalls for 2 years 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Stanford could face new
deficits above and beyond the cur
rent $43-million shortfall, Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
told the Faculty Senate yesterday.
In addition, Kennedy said it is
unlikely that the University's
indirect-cost rate will rise signifi
cantly. Kennedy and other faculty
expressed doubts that graduate
tuition remission would continue,
which could result in the loss of
funding to a quarter of Stanford's
graduate students.
"It is plain that there could be
substantial deficits in the next
two years," Kennedy said. But he
emphasized that the "magnitude
is too difficult to predict" because
of a number of uncertainties.
"The probability is that the com
bined effect | of these issues] could
add up to generate new deficits in
the next two years," he said.
But despite possible deficits,
Kennedy said the Board of
Trustees would not demand new
academic cuts but instead search
for increased revenue.
"The board understands that
the success of the budget-reduc
tion process has left us thin. They
do not support greater academic
cuts," Kennedy said. "I do not feel
pessimistic about the next two

years' deficits, nor do I lack faith
that we would be able to take care
of them without placing an addi
tional burden on academics."
Kennedy listed nine important
factors that could cause new
deficits in the next two years,
including indirect-cost rates,
research volume, tuition remission,
interest rates, retiree medical bene
fits, past indirect-cost liability and
costs of compliance with new feder
al laws.
An indirect-cost rate of 55.5 per
cent for this year is a "virtual cer
tainty," and the "best expected
value" for next year is only 58.5
percent, Kennedy said. Last year's
rate was originally 74 percent
before the federal government
abruptly reduced it in April, result
ing in a $28-million shortfall.
The "volatility of political pro
cesses in resolving" the indirect
cost controversy as well as other
budget issues make "tying down
projections very difficult," Kennedy
said.
Kennedy said questions about
retiree medical benefits and
tuition remission have made the
staff benefit rate uncertain.
Tuition remission is the prac
tice of government reimburse
ment for a portion of the tuition
of graduate students involved in
research through the staff bene
fits pool.
In a brief interview after the
meeting, Kennedy said the Uni
versity is "preparing for the worst,
but we are still hopeful. The indi
cations are that it will be opti
mistic to assume that the practice
will continue."
Kennedy said the Office of
Management and Budget will
likely decide the future of tuition
remission by next summer. Elim
ination of the practice would
result in a 4 percent drop in the
staff benefit rate.
A study at MIT predicted that
the university would lose about 25
percent of its graduate students if

tuition remission were ended, and
Dean of Research Bob Byer has pre
dicted similar results at Stanford.
Genetics Prof. David Botstein
said during yesterday's meeting
that tuition remission would
"likely" be ended.
Kennedy said the cost of com
plying with new federal regula
tions concerning indirect costs
may add to future budget woes.
"The mixture of one-time and
recurring expenses" has neither
been calculated nor included in
many of the University's long
range forecasts, but is "somewhat
larger than anticipated," he said.
University budget planners
also fear having to pay back indi
rect costs collected in the 1980s.
The Defense Contract Audit
Agency has challenged the validi
ty of agreements between Stan
ford and the government and

argued that the University over
billed the government $231 mil
lion from 1981 to 1988.
"These are the numbers that
assume the cancellation of all of
the memoranda of understanding
and assume that nothing is put in
their place," Kennedy said.
Although the University does not
expect to be required to pay anything
back, Kennedy said, "we are not
going to have complete confidence
in that until the judicial review" has
found in favor of Stanford.
Kennedy said the trustees asked
the administration to "report back
to the [trustee budget) committee
in March on estimates" of what
future deficits might be.
The board also asked for a
"clearer set of what the internal
decision will be" given a certain
situation, such as the elimination
of tuition remission, he said.

A new trustee committee will
begin examining ways of generat
ing more revenue, which is one
way of handling possible new
deficits, Kennedy announced.
Among ideas to be studied are
changes in the endowment payout
rate, revenue from real estate
transactions, use of restricted
funds and fund raising.
"I believe that we have the
tools to handle uncertainty,"
Kennedy said.
Kennedy presented the budget
issues to the senate because
Provost James Rosse is in Irvine,
Calif., handling business related
to his new position at Freedom
Newspapers Inc.
There was little faculty dissent
over Kennedy's budget presenta
tion, as faculty members sought
explanations rather than raising
criticism.

Kennedy said the Board of
Trustees would not demand new
academic cuts but instead search
for increased revenue.
"The board understands that
the success of the budget-reduc
tion process has left us thin. They
do not support greater academic
cuts," Kennedy said. "I do not feel
pessimistic about the next two

years' deficits, nor do I lack faith
that we would be able to take care
of them without placing an addi
tional burden on academics."
Kennedy listed nine important
factors that could cause new
deficits in the next two years,
including indirect-cost rates,
research volume, tuition remission,
interest rates, retiree medical bene
fits, past indirect-cost liability and
costs of compliance with new feder
al laws.
An indirect-cost rate of 55.5 per
cent for this year is a "virtual cer
tainty," and the "best expected
value" for next year is only 58.5
percent, Kennedy said. Last year's
rate was originally 74 percent
before the federal government
abruptly reduced it in April, result
ing in a $28-million shortfall.
The "volatility of political pro
cesses in resolving" the indirect
cost controversy as well as other
budget issues make "tying down
projections very difficult," Kennedy
said.
Kennedy said questions about
retiree medical benefits and
tuition remission have made the
staff benefit rate uncertain.
Tuition remission is the prac
tice of government reimburse
ment for a portion of the tuition
of graduate students involved in
research through the staff bene
fits pool.
In a brief interview after the
meeting, Kennedy said the Uni
versity is "preparing for the worst,
but we are still hopeful. The indi
cations are that it will be opti
mistic to assume that the practice
will continue."
Kennedy said the Office of
Management and Budget will
likely decide the future of tuition
remission by next summer. Elim
ination of the practice would
result in a 4 percent drop in the
staff benefit rate.
A study at MIT predicted that
the university would lose about 25
percent of its graduate students if

tuition remission were ended, and
Dean of Research Bob Byer has pre
dicted similar results at Stanford.
Genetics Prof. David Botstein
said during yesterday's meeting
that tuition remission would
"likely" be ended.
Kennedy said the cost of com
plying with new federal regula
tions concerning indirect costs
may add to future budget woes.
"The mixture of one-time and
recurring expenses" has neither
been calculated nor included in
many of the University's long
range forecasts, but is "somewhat
larger than anticipated," he said.
University budget planners
also fear having to pay back indi
rect costs collected in the 1980s.
The Defense Contract Audit
Agency has challenged the validi
ty of agreements between Stan
ford and the government and

argued that the University over
billed the government $231 mil
lion from 1981 to 1988.
"These are the numbers that
assume the cancellation of all of
the memoranda of understanding
and assume that nothing is put in
their place," Kennedy said.
Although the University does not
expect to be required to pay anything
back, Kennedy said, "we are not
going to have complete confidence
in that until the judicial review" has
found in favor of Stanford.
Kennedy said the trustees asked
the administration to "report back
to the [trustee budget) committee
in March on estimates" of what
future deficits might be.
The board also asked for a
"clearer set of what the internal
decision will be" given a certain
situation, such as the elimination
of tuition remission, he said.

A new trustee committee will
begin examining ways of generat
ing more revenue, which is one
way of handling possible new
deficits, Kennedy announced.
Among ideas to be studied are
changes in the endowment payout
rate, revenue from real estate
transactions, use of restricted
funds and fund raising.
"I believe that we have the
tools to handle uncertainty,"
Kennedy said.
Kennedy presented the budget
issues to the senate because
Provost James Rosse is in Irvine,
Calif., handling business related
to his new position at Freedom
Newspapers Inc.
There was little faculty dissent
over Kennedy's budget presenta
tion, as faculty members sought
explanations rather than raising
criticism.
Stanford could face new
deficits above and beyond the cur
rent $43-million shortfall, Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
told the Faculty Senate yesterday.
In addition, Kennedy said it is
unlikely that the University's
indirect-cost rate will rise signifi
cantly. Kennedy and other faculty
expressed doubts that graduate
tuition remission would continue,
which could result in the loss of
funding to a quarter of Stanford's
graduate students.
"It is plain that there could be
substantial deficits in the next
two years," Kennedy said. But he
emphasized that the "magnitude
is too difficult to predict" because
of a number of uncertainties.
"The probability is that the com
bined effect | of these issues] could
add up to generate new deficits in
the next two years," he said.
