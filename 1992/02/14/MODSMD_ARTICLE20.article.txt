## Looking into Central Asia 
### 
During the Stanford Soviet
Exchange Project's three week trip
last September to Novosibirsk
State University in Siberia, I met many
interesting people. In addition to our
hosts, there were two students who
became especially significant to me.
Telman and Ilkhom are two Muslim
students in the university's Math
Department. They came from Uzbek
istan, a land in Central Asia with a popu
lation of 20 million. During several con
versations with them, in which my host
acted as an interpreter, I learned of the
sad historical plight of their homeland
and the current challenges it faces.
Ilkhom is from Bukhara, a city which
centuries ago prided itself as a rich and
distinct Islamic culture, one of the major
trading centers between Europe, Africa
and Asia. Telman is from a rural area
near Bukhara. Uzbekistan is about 80
percent rural.
Uzbekistan, which enjoyed relative
autonomy before the 1917 revolution,
was conquered by the Soviets under Stal
in in the years 1924-1930. The last Cen
tral Asian leader was ousted by the Sovi
et army and local collaborators, and
many people were murdered during the
conquest.
During a campaign to destroy Islamic
culture, there was massive repression
against the believers of Islam. Friday
prayers were forbidden, and anyone dis

covered praying or in possession of the
Koran or the Hadiths was sent to jail.
Arabic, which had a very large influence
in the area, virtually disappeared during
a massive Russification campaign.
After the takeover, the Soviet policy cre
ated separate "republics" such as Tajik
istan and Uzbekistan. The republics had
their own legal status and leaders to drive
a wedge between the populations and cre
ate bureaucracies subservient to Moscow,
which was to facilitate central rule.
Since the conquest, many of Ilkhom
and Telman's people have had to work
for up to seventeen hours a day on the
local kolkhoz (Soviet-style, state-con
trolled collective farms) with few
rewards.
People reluctant to support the system
have been singled out. The oldest genera
tion was stripped of Islam. The middle
generation was doused with Soviet propa
ganda, but grew disillusioned when com
munism never really took hold in the
region. The youngest generation believes
in nothing, neither communism nor
Islam, but looks increasingly toward
profiteering, crime and corruption.
Central Asian leaders such as Islam
Karimov (Uzbekistan) and Rahman
Nabiyev (Tajikistan) are ex-Communist
Brezhnev-era holdouts, opportunists
who have attempted a face-lift, adopting
Islamic and anti-Russian rhetoric to hold
on to power.

'The youngest
generation
believes in
nothing,
neither
communism
nor Islam.'

Karimov and Nabiyev, while choosing
to join the Commonwealth, are illegitimate
rulers defying the deep-rooted change so
prevalent in Moscow today. Only recently
have popular groups such as Mohammed
Solih's ERK and Islamic groups such as
the Islamic Renaissance Party gained wide
recognition in Uzbekistan.
During our conversations, my friends
stressed their appreciation for the kind
welcome they received in Novosibirsk
and the warm relations they share with
my host and other Russians. They
denounce the anti-Russian propaganda
Karimov is using to marginalize the
influence of Russian president Boris
Yeltsin and other democrats trying to
bring about change in Central Asia.
Most current Western press coverage
inaccurately depicts Central Asia as "vio
lent" and "incapable of self-government."
The coverage ignores or plays down many
of the realities that Ilkhom and Telman
were so graphic in describing. The hard
ship that their people face, though not
unique in today's troubled world, must
not be forgotten.
