## Goss rains down a torrent of kills 
### Laurie Wackier Staff writer 
If USC has ideas of escaping
the storm when they come to
Stanford for a volleyball match
on Saturday, they're in for a sur
prise. Mother nature's rampage
may seem meek to the Trojans
when they find themselves in the
eye of the hurricane that No. 3
Stanford has created. Just a
week after falling to a fierce Car
dinal squad in Southern Califor
nia, No. 7 USC will try once
more to weather the storm.
The Trojans better bring
their umbrellas, because the
darkest cloud is here to stay.
Junior Dave Goss has been mer
cilessly showering his wrath on
opponents all season, leading the
Cardinal to an immaculate 5-0
conference record. He has also
picked up some impressive stats
along the way.
For example, Goss has aver
aged over 30 kills in each match,
en route to an impressive .371
season hitting percentage. Last
Friday at he compiled 55
kills, setting not only a school
record, but also breaking the
previous NCAA mark of 53. The
previous record, set last season,
was 53 kills by Long Beach
State's Brent Hilliard. As the 6-
foot-5 outside hitter would put
it, he's "ready for the roll, and
it's been going great so far."
Although Goss shouldered the
offensive burden for the Cardi
nal last year, inconsistency char
acterized his play and reflected
his inexperience. With the physi
cal ability to punish opponents
from both the back and front
row, Goss just needed some sea
soning and a dose of confidence.
A summer at the Olympic Festi
val and a year of intense training
provided both things.
"Last year it was hard
because we were all so young,"

Goss remarked. "We didn't have
the older guys to be the exam
ples."
A season later, Goss is the
example. "Dave's attitude
toward training is greatly
improved," head coach Ruben
Nieves said. "On a regular basis,
he's making the most of practice
and his time in the weight room.
"As a result, he's stronger,
he's in better shape, and he's
been ready to compete whenever
we've stepped on the floor." And
he's chalked up a lot of victories
to prove it.
Goss credits much of his suc
cess to the team, claiming that a
year of experience together has
given them the necessary tools
to excel in pressure situations.
But Nieves insists that Goss'
increased confidence plays a key
role in his consistently explosive
play.
"I knew he was capable of
this. His teammates knew he
was capable of this," Nieves said.
"He was the only one who wasn't
so sure." An NCAA record can't
leave much room for doubt.
In addition to his stellar hit
ting stats, all aspects of Goss'
performance reflect marked
improvement. He has fine tuned
his passing, serving and blocking
skills since last season.
Though the volleyball court is
his domain now, the Eng
lish/Communications major
admits that in high school, bas
ketball was his first love. After
moving to Santa Barbara from
West Virginia in eighth grade,
Goss needed a spring activity to
round out his three- sport sched
ule. "I picked up volleyball as a
sport to play in the spring," Goss
recalls. "It sounded fun, so I
went out for it."
The Trojans fell victim to
Goss' idea of fun last Saturday,
