# Netters meet No. 8 Miami
## Full-strength Cardinal to play Hurricanes 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Huge. HUGE. That's what this after
noon's men's tennis match will be. The No.
3 Cardinal will battle the No. 8 Miami Hur
ricanes at 1:30 p.m. in the Stanford Tennis
Stadium.
"You'll see some great tennis, just great
tennis," head coach Dick Gould said.
"Every match will be a dogfight."
With a full lineup, the Cardinal is raring
to go. "I'm excited to see what happens,"
sophomore Robert Devens said.
Devens is coming off of two solid wins at
third singles and first doubles in Wednes
day's contest with San Jose State.
Senior Jason Yee also had back-to-back
wins Wednesday afternoon. "I played good
solid tennis to get ready for the matches
(against Miami)," he said.
Top hitters Alex O'Brien and Chris
Cocotos have been ironing the kinks out of
their games while Michael Flanagan has
been resting his sore wrist in preparation
for today's contest.
All three should provide a formidable
challenge for the Hurricanes.
"Miami is a tough, tough team," Gould
said. "We'll have to play well to make it a
good match. Our guys should step up and
respond real well."
The Hurricanes historically have been
very good. "They're basically a top-eight
team every year," Gould commented.
They would even probably be a top
three team had they not lost their top play
er to the professional circuit last year. Con
nie Fall held the No. 1 spot in the nation
for the better part of last season.
However, things have changed. Fall is

out of the picture and Stanford's own
O'Brien has replaced him at the top.
O'Brien and the rest of the Cardinal
men will be looking to assert their national
ranking and enjoy the three-day weekend
with another win under their belts.
"It'll be good for our guys to see where

tennis, just great tennis.
Every match will be a
dogfight.'

we are," Gould said. "We need a good
tough match before the Indoors."
Next Wednesday, the Cardinal will head
to the National Team Indoor Champi
onships in Kentucky.
But before Kentucky comes Miami.
With a complete and healthy lineup today,
the Cardinal is planning to make the Hur
ricanes work for every point.
"A few guys were sick over the week
end," Gould said. "But at the moment,
everyone is healthy and ready to go. I'm
really excited."
Card Notes
No. 8 Miami will also be playing at the
National Indoors next week. The top 18 teams in
the nation, in fact, will compete in Kentucky
from Feb. 20-23. The format is the same as the
NCAA Tournament in May. Stanford has won
six of the 20 of the National Indoors since it
began in 1973.
