# Tennis faces Big Match

The Pepperdine Waves said goodbye to
their only scheduled opportunity to meet
the 1992 Stanford women's tennis team
when they cancelled Saturday's match.
Showers are expected and, with the likeli
hood of a rain-out, the Waves did not want
to make the trip from Malibu.
The cancellation leaves the No. 5 Cardinal
with one match this weekend, a Sunday con
test with the No. 8 California Bears. Some
schedules list Cal as host but the 1 p.m.
match is at the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
"This is our biggest match of the year so
far," assistant coach Forood said. "It
will be nice to see how we stack up against
them." Of course we want to win but
what's important is seeing how people are
playing right now."
The Bears are led by 1991 NCAA final
ist Lisa Albano. "Lisa has to be considered
one of the best players in the collegiate

ranks," Forood said.
Alhano started the season ranked No. 1
in the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate poll but fell
to No. 14 after the fall rankings.
She was upset in the All-American
Championships by the Cardinal's top seed,
Heather Willens. The Stanford junior beat
Albano in the quarterfinals. Willens went
on to reach the finals of the second leg of
the collegiate Grand Slam. The second
place finish boosted Willens' rank from
No. 9 to No. 5.
Also expected in the Cal lineup, besides
Albano, are sophomore Sarah Maynard
and junior Lisa Parks. Sophomore Cara
Abe, who was ranked No. 37 in the presea
son poll, is questionable for the match.
The Cardinal's Kristine Kurth may also
miss the match. She strained her back in
January and is not yet 100 percent.
Stanford is 5-0 in dual matches this sea
son. The squad hits the road next week for
contests against Arizona and Arizona
State.
