# Hoops plays at Coliseum
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Against California tomorrow the Cardinal will
not have to worry about crazed Cal students
avenging their application rejections by assailing
the court.
Don't worry, they'll still be ranting and raving
about Adam Keefe and Dean Jean, but their cries
will dissipate in the cavernous rafters of the Oak
land Coliseum Arena. For the first time in the his
tory of basketball's Big Game, the contest will be
played off-campus. To make more money, Cal
moved the game from inhospitable Harmon Gym
to the Coliseum, which can hold 15,000 fans.
"I couldn't be happier," said Stanford senior
center Paul Garrett. "Get the students in the
rafters and let them stay there, I won't miss Har
mon at all."

'Get the students in the rafters
and let them stay there, I won't
miss Harmon at all.'
— Paul Garrett
'Harmon is a sweet old gym. It's
a classic place to play because
you've got the fans right on top
of you.'
— Jason Weaver

"I've got a lot of friends that go to school there
and they all come and yell right in my ear," said
Garrett, from Pacific Palisades. "Plus you've got
that weenie band right on the court."
Built in 1933 for $727,500, Harmon Gym is a
hell-hole of a building scrunched in the middle of
Berkeley's campus. The Pacific 10 Conference's
smallest facility can hold 6,578 fans, but only when
they all stand up and scream at the same time.
Inside Sports recently rated it as the ninth most
difficult place to play in the country.
Not to be confused with an arena or majestic
coliseum, Harmon is a basketball dungeon: low
ceiling, spartan bleachers and no space between
sideline and stands.
"Harmon is a sweet old gym. It's a classic place
to play because you've got the fans right on top of
you," said Cardinal junior forward Jason Weaver.
"At the Coliseum the crowd will be removed.
Although there will be 9,000 more fans at the
Coliseum (tickets are still available), they'll be a lot
farther from the action. The Coliseum is sized for
concerts and tractor pulls and is not designed for
intimate college crowds.
"We're kind of approaching it like it's a neutral
court," Weaver said. "The location isn't really that
critical; this is a very important game for us to
win."
California will reportedly net more than
$40,000 by moving the game, but the Bears will
lose most of their home court advantage. The
Bears beat Stanford, Arizona and UCLA in Har
mon last season, but were crushed 86-66 by UCLA
in the Coliseum this year.
Stanford has fared better than most of the
league in Harmon, having won two of the last four
in Berkeley, but the Cardinal will welcome a neu
tral court.
Stanford has won two of its last three Pac-10
games and can solidify fourth place with a season
sweep of the Bears. A loss would give Stanford a
two-game losing streak heading into a treacherous
trip to No. 16 USC and No. 3 UCLA.
