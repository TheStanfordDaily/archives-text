# Men's Basketball vs. California
## 
### 
TOMORROW — 1 p.m. tip-off at the Oakland Coliseum
Arena. There are still a few hundred tickets available at
the Stanford athletic department ticket office, but the
game will probably be sold out by tip-off. Broadcast
live locally on KICU, Channel 36, and on campus
radio station KZSU (90.1 FM).
RECORDS — Stanford (13-6, 5-4 and fourth in the
Pacific 10 Conference), Cal (8-11, 2 7 and tenth).
PREVIOUS MEETINGS — Stanford beat the Bears 76-
61 Jan. 15, but Cal was without leading scorer Brian
Hendrick (16.7 points, 11.8 rebounds per game).
Adam Keefe tallied 27 points and 18 rebounds for
Stanford, while freshman LaMond Murray led the
Bears with 26 points.
DA BEARS — Junior guard Billy Dreher was the best
three-point shooter (50 percent) in the league last year,
but has been a flop in 1991-92. He's out of the starting
lineup after making just seven of 31 treys in league play.
