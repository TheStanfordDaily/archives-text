# No. 11 Batters challenge No. 4 Waves
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
This holiday weekend will be a very
big one for the Stanford baseball team.
The No. 11 Cardinal hosts the No. 4
Pepperdine Waves in a three-game
(Saturday, Sunday and Monday) series
which should be a marked indicator of
Stanford's early season development.
Pepperdine sports an excellent base
ball team, which should severely chal
lenge Cardinal pitching and hitting.
Probably no team in the nation has
a better right side of the infield than
the Waves. First baseman Dan Melen
dez last year hit a healthy .354 with six
home runs and 60 RBI, while second
baseman Steve Rodriguez hit a health
ier .419 with seven homers, 49 RBI
and 32 stolen bases. Both spent last

summer starting for Team U.S.A.
Melendez is projected as the best colle
giate first baseman in the country,
while Rodriguez is rated the fifth best
second-sacker.
But the offense doesn't stop there.
Catcher Scott Vollmer (.313 average, 2
home runs, 29 RBI), shortstop Eric
Ekdahl (.325, 1, 24, 18 stolen bases),
outfielder Jorge Paz (.328, 2, 29) and
center fielder Chris Sheff (.342, 4, 46,
23 SB) add lots of firepower, and
should provide plenty of baserunners.
But, fortunately for the Cardinal,
the talent doesn't stop there. Probably
the best player on the team is junior
right-handed pitcher Derek Wallace,
who last year compiled a 4-0 record
with an outstanding 2.58 ERA, and fig
ures as a pre-season Ail-American by
virtue of an unbelievable fastball. Wal

lace will most likely be moved into the
starting rotation this year, joining last
year's crew of junior Steve Duda (11-2
record, 3.07 ERA), and seniors Patrick
Ahearne (11-5, 3.42) and Jerry AschofT
(6-5, 3.44).
The Cardinal, which has had hitting
problems, must certainly be bouyed by
their performance Wedensday against
Pacific. That game, in which Stanford
pitchers Jamie Sepeda and Willie
Adams combined for a no-hitter, also
featured 13 Stanford hits. The Cardi
nal will need to find that type of offen
sive output in order to compete with
teams of Pepperdine's caliber, especial
ly once Six-Pac play starts.
The starters for the series will be
Brian Sackinsky Saturday, Rick Sunday,
and Jamie Sepeda Monday. All games
start at 1 p.m. at Sunken Diamond^
