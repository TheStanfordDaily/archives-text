# Cagers shoot for Bruins, Trojans on big road trip
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
This is seemingly one of the few week
ends during which Stanford's women's
basketball team will not play a top-25
team. Yet it promises to be the most diffi
cult, and the most important, road trip of
the regular season.
Stanford heads south to take on UCLA
tonight at 7 and USC Sunday at 2.
After a loss at the hands of upset
thirsty Oregon State last weekend, the
Cardinal fell into a tie with California and
USC for first place in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. USC's subsequent loss to Ari
zona State left the Bay Area teams in the
lead.
UCLA, meanwhile, holds the same
overall record (13-6) and conference
record (6-3) as its cross-town rival, and
has won four straight games, currently

the longest win streak in the Pac-10. Nei
ther the Bruins nor the Trojans have lost
a Pac-10 game on their respective home
floors.
UCLA may well be the more difficult
opponent of the two. The Bruins are one
of a very small group of teams which can
legitimately boast of having not just one,
but two All-America candidates.
The name that immediately springs to
mind is Rehema Stephens, the Bruins'
small forward, whose scoring average was
fifth in the nation last year.
This year her average is down four
points to 21.1 ppg, only third in the con
ference. But she is averaging 24 ppg in
Pac-10 games and achieved a career-high
39 points against Stanford Jan. 18. She is
also third in the conference at rebound
ing, averaging 8.7 rpg.
Although Stephens has received most
of the attention, it is the maturation of

the Bruins' other All-America candidate
which has transformed the team from an
upper-division Pac-10 team to a true con
tender.
Center Natalie Williams, who is only a
junior, has already shown the potential to
be the first woman named national player
of the year in two different sports. The 6-
foot-1 Williams, who possesses an already
legendary vertical leap, has led the Bruins
to two consecutive NCAA titles in volley
ball.
After joining UCLA's basketball squad
late (because of volleyball NCAAs), she
continued to play on an Ail-American
level. Only the sport was different. She
averages 20.7 ppg, tied for fourth in the
league, and a monstrous 12.5 rpg, by far
the best in the conference. Equally amaz
ing, she pulls down 5.6 offensive boards
per contest.
Williams is one of two dunk-capable

players whom Stanford's own All-America
candidate, Val Whiting, will have to guard
this weekend. The other, of course, is Lisa
Leslie of USC. Leslie has not been the
unstoppable force which the media loves
to characterize her as, but she is still a top
player, averaging 20.7 ppg and 7.9 rpg.

Whiting, who admits that the media
hype over Leslie pumps her up, will have
no problem getting up against Williams,
either. After their last meeting, Whiting
commented, "When the person I'm
guarding gets 10 offensive rebounds, I
take it personally."
