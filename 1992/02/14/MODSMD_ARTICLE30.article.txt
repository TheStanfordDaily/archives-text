The powerful Stanford men's
swim team will have its last home
meet of the season tomorrow,
competing against California at
deGuerre at 1 p.m. The Cardinal
will compete in this non-scoring
meet as a tune-up for the Olympic
Trials to be held in Indianapolis in
two weeks.
"We are throwing out the scor

ing to let the guys swim events
they needed, to sharpen their
skills for the Olympic Trials,"
head coach Skip Kenney said.
This will be the last perfor
mance for such stand-out Stan
ford swimmers as world-record
holder JefT Rouse and American
record-holder Brian Retterer,
before going head-to-head with
the nation's best March 1-6.
"It's important that we race, in
the correct framework of tuning

up for Trials . . . without fatiguing
the guys," Kenney said.
Over half the Cardinal squad
will be competing in Indianapo
lis, and tomorrow will be getting
in one last meet. Stanford has
many legitimate hopefuls for the
U.S. Olympic team, including
freshman Ray Carey and Trip
Zedlitz.
The Cardinal is also gearing
up for the NCAA championships,
occurring two weeks after Trials.
