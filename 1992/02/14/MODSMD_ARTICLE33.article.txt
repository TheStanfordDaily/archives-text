# Both gymnastics teams take on Gauchos tonight
## Women wary of UCSB 
### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
They have set team and individual
records at an alarming rate. They have
taken two top-20 opponents to the wire in
the past two weeks, earning themselves a
national ranking and a reputation to
match. The only thing the 1992 Cardinal
women's gymnastics team has not done
over the last fortnight, however, is win a
meet.
That could change tonight, though, as
Stanford's women will take on unranked
UC-Santa Barbara at Maples Pavilion at
7:30. Coincidentally, the Cardinal men
will also face the Gauchos at Maples at
the same time, hence the venue change
from the intimate confines of Burnham
Pavilion.
While UCSB does not figure to pose
much of a threat to the Cardinal women,
head coach Breck Greenwood is some
what apprehensive about the possibility
of an upset, particularly because the Gau
chos are led by freshmen Lauren Yee, a
Bay Area native who was lured away
from Stanford last recruiting season.

'UCSB is an aggressive
team that tries many difficult
routines. They are fun to
watch, particularly Lauren,
and we're not taking them
lightly.'
â€” coach Greenwood

"UCSB is an aggressive team that tries
many difficult routines," Greenwood
said, "They are fun to watch, particularly
Lauren, and we're not taking them light
{y"
In accordance with the need and possi
bility of earning a victory, Stanford will
feature a healthy and upgraded all
around lineup this week. Freshman Katie
Clancy, who had to pull out of last week's
competition at UCLA with the flu, will
return tonight with improved routines on
the vault and door. Sophomore Kerri
Kanuka has added some difficulty on the
uneven bars and the balance beam. The
Daily's female Athlete of the Week, fresh
man .Jene Elzie, whom Greenwood thinks
"still hasn't had as good a meet as she is

capable of," will look to better Stanford's
individual all-around record for the third
consecutive week.
Other notable changes for the Cardi
nal include the "scratching" of junior
Erin McCann for tonight's meet because
of a bruised tail bone. Sophomore Kerrie
Kelley will fill in for McCann on the bars
and floor, as well as the beam. Also, fresh
man Tina Snowden will be performing
two double back flips in tonight's compe
tition, something that only Klzie has done
this season for Stanford.
"It's exciting to coach this team,"
Greenwood said. "They're always grow
ing and trying new things."
Tonight, the young Cardinal will look
to give their coaches and fans both excite
ment and a long-awaited victory.
