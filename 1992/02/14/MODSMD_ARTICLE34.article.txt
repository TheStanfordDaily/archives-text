## 
### Peter Marks Staff writer 
This weekend is a tale of two meets for
the men's gymnastics squad: one for
show and one for showtime. The team
will compete against UC-Santa Barbara
tonight in its first home meet, then will
travel to Weenietown for a Saturday

Everyone's going to
be on the floor. We
want people to see
what the team looks
like.'

matchup against California, UCLA and
Washington.
Those in attendance at the Ford Cen
ter will enjoy their first look at the 1992
squad. Coach Sadao Hamada said that he
will give all 12 of his gymnasts a chance to
strut their stuff.
"Everyone's going to be on the floor,"
Hamada said. "We want people to see
what the team looks like."
Among those who will compete are
Olympic hopefuls Tim Ryan and Jair
Lynch, who rejoined their teammates
after last weekend's Winter Nationals.
Ryan and Lynch placed sixth and twelfth,
respectively, at the tournament in Col

orado Springs that marked the first step
towards Barcelona.
While the Winter Nationals witnessed
Ryan's return to national prominence,
Lynch proved at the Winter Nationals
that he deserves a place among the
nation's elite gymnasts.
In addition, the core of the team will
demonstrate its remarkable improve
ment and depth. Stanford's quest for the
Pacific 10 Conference and NCAA Cham
pionships depends on this group, which
includes Jeff Bender, Mark Booth, Chris
Sey and Jason Cohen.
While Hamada intends to use Friday's
meet for team exposure, he vowed to pull
no punches the following night at Berke
ley. The Cardinal is gunning for a high
team score, three of which are needed to
earn a spot in the Western Regionals in
April.
Among the teams competing Saturday
is UCLA, Stanford's main rival in the
Pac-10. Earlier in the season, Hamada
expressed great confidence in his squad's
chances against UCLA.
While UCLA lost several key team
members due to graduation, Stanford
lost only one gymnast and filled his spot
with Josh Stein. The freshman makes his
debut at the Farm on tonight.
