# Valentine's Day shoppers find that perfect gift in the risque
## 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
For many people, shopping for
Valentine's Day is the odd combi
nation of Victorian-era romanti
cism and Los Angeles-inspired
sleaze — spandex teddies and
black leather camisoles.
Searching for the perfect gift,
Stanford students have been
walking the thin gray line
between sex and smut, between
base desires and loftier emotions,
between $4.99 and $50.
The big sellers at local stores
this season are G-strings, which
cost from $10 to $30, according to
Michelle Griffon, co-manager of
the Victoria's Secret store in San
Mateo.
Another popular choice is the
infamous "panty-rose," which
consists of a pair of silk briefs
packaged as a large cloth rose,
said Maxine Most, owner of the
Palo Alto lingerie shop Senshu.
Most said her store is frequent
ed by Stanford students of both
sexes on a regular basis. During
the past few days, more than 80
percent of the store's customers
have been men, Most said.
AmoriL' the women who visit

the store, she said, is a group from
Stanford that goes there for a
study break instead of going out
for food. "During exams it's a real
stress-releaser for them," Most
said.
Men's silk boxers and under
wear have been selling well as
gifts over the last few days, but
men still give underwear as a
Valentine's Day present far more
often than women, according to
Most.
Offering straightforward advice
to the sometimes-nervous male
shoppers, Most said she tries to
steer men toward items which are
"practical, but sexy.
"It's a wonderful purchase for
someone that you love, but it's
not to be taken lightly," she said.
"If a guy comes in here and wants
to buy lingerie for someone he's
been seeing for two weeks, I say,
'Don't buy lingerie.' I send them
someplace else."
Men at the store range from
the self-confident to the embar
rassed, Most said, but no one has
ever tried to pull the you're
about-the-same-size-as-my-girl-
friend trick on the saleswomen.
"We have weirdos occasionally,
but I usually tell them to get

lost," she said.
Owen Byrd, 29, was at the
shop two days ago, brazenly pur
chasing a camisole and tap pant
for his fiancee.
Byrd said he didn't think it
would be a problem for a student
to buy lingerie for someone he
was dating.
"Too often student life isn't
romantic enough," Byrd said.
"There seems to be a stigma
against dating — it was like that
when I was in school, but it didn't
stop me."
Romantics aren't the only peo
ple who can appreciate the not-so
subtle allure of lingerie, according
to Most.
"Our whole philosophy is that
lingerie is an enhancement of the
body and spirit and not an accou
trement to sex," she said. "Yeah,
this stuff is sexy — but you don't
have to put that in people's
faces."
Victoria's Secret maintains a
very different attitude, replete
with frilly curtains and the over
powering aroma of dead, rotting
flowers.
"We basically put things in
their face and sell it to them,"
Griffon said.
