# Relationship problems stem from 'crisis in methods,' prof. says

"Wo don't know how to start a rela
tionship, and once it's started, how to
keep it going," said former Sociology
Prof. Jerry Talley in a talk Wednesday
night in Lagunita Court.
Talley, a clinical sociologist and cre
ator of Stanford's "Etiquette of Sex"
course, spoke on "Love and Romance:
How to Find it and How to Keep it" as
part of a series of programs in Lagunita
titled "Love and Sex Week."
He said Stanford students of both
sexes who complain that they can't find
anyone to date or have a lasting relation
ship are suffering from "a crisis in meth
ods.
"We find ourselves nervous, scared,
with dry mouths, calling for a date just to
hang up when the answering machine
comes on," he said. Fortunately, Talley
said, "there is an accepted method —
flirting."
Talley outlined four tips on flirting
well:
• Invite without being demanding.

Most flirting is actually nonverbal,
through touch, eye contact or other body
language. "It's like a little dance," Talley
said.
• Proceed through a series of invita
tions, reactions, counteroffers and more
reactions. According to Talley, it is
important to listen and watch how the
other person responds to know what the
next move should be.
• Leave the other person feeling com
fortable and complemented. "Good flirt
ing takes care of the other person (and) is
respectful," Talley said. He cautioned
that overly aggressive flirting can make
the other person feel threatened and
defensive.
• If asked, be clear what your inten
tions are. According to Talley, this can be
the greatest challenge because of sexual
roles and stereotypes.
"Men and women don't come to this as
equals," he said. Women, according to
Talley, sometimes are "misleading or
ambiguous" in order to protect a man's
ego. "Women have to realize they have a
responsibility to be clear," he said.
Males often mistake refusals for "coy

ness — an invitation to persist," he said,
adding that he thinks most women have
been asked out repeatedly by the same
man even after saying no.
If relationships are to be more equal,
women need to make more decisions,
such as "participating in the planning of
an evening," Talley said.
In response, Talley said he tells men,
"There are times when -you'll be led
rather than leading." Men need to realize
"her yes's and no's mean exactly that,"
he added.
According to Talley, students say most
relationships, once established, last
about a quarter.
When relationships fail, Talley said
students "usually assume one of the play
ers was deficient in skill" and offer excus
es like, "God, she's like all Stanford
women."
He said that many couples break up
because they are not committed to inti
macy itself. He discussed six types of inti
macy:
• Practical intimacy, which involves
issues like "deciding where to go to the
damn movie."

• Romantic intimacy. "When we're in
love with someone they're wonderful,
we're wonderful, it's wonderful, the
world is wonderful," Talley said. Roman
tic intimacy at Stanford usually dies after
the first three weeks, and at least by the
eighth week, he added.
• Companionate intimacy, which "is
just being good friends," Talley said. It
usually grows as the relationship pro
gresses and is "about 95 percent of what
you do together," he said.
• Sensual intimacy, which focuses on
"touching and sex." According to Talley,
sensual intimacy can begin quite early in
the relationship, but often becomes less
important as time passes.
• Emotional intimacy, which Talley
described as the "cornerstone of a rela
tionship." It takes longer to develop
because it includes "moments of intense
self-disclosure when you talk about
things you haven't told anyone," he said.
• Social intimacy, which determines
how many activities couples do with
other people.
According to Talley, all relationships
have different combinations of these

types of intimacy. "Most people at Stan
ford want it all in all categories," he said.
"I don't think it works."
Instead, Talley suggested couples take
an hour a week, an evening a month and
a weekend a year to "think of 'what have
we not done?' " and then do it. This could
be anything from a romantic date to talk
ing about practicalities like "What's
going to happen come June?" he said.
Talley said he believes there is hope
for Stanford students. "If you use these
guidelines you'll find yourself pretty suc
cessful," he said.
