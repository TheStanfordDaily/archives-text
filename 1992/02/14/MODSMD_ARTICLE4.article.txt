# Biddle quits position; campaign likely
## University still objects to 'conflict of interest' 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Stanford won't have Paul Biddle to kick
around any more. Or is it the other way
around?
The controversial on-campus Navy regula
tor announced his resignation yesterday and
said he will likely run for the Congressional
seat of Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Stanford.
Biddle's resignation will not take effect
until Feb. 29, and the University renewed its
objection to his "continued conflict of inter
est."
At a press conference yesterday, Biddle said
he is leaving his oversight role at Stanford

because "at this point of time, the payback for
Paul Biddle remaining is not as great as it had
been in the past . . . and the remaining issues
involve litigation."
Although Biddle refused to say he was a
"formal candidate," his supporters will begin
gathering signatures needed for his bid to join
the June 2 Republican primary.
"If they get the required number of signa
tures, I will give them the best effort I can in
the campaign," he said.
Neither the University nor the Navy had
much to say about'Biddle's announcement.
Norm Hanson, spokesman for the Office of
Naval Research, said the Navy "wishes him
well" and declined to comment on a possible

replacement.
The University had "no comment on Bid
die's future career and will never have a com
ment on anybody's candidacy for public
office," said Larry Horton, associate vice pres
ident for public affairs.
Stanford has been trying to remove Riddle
from his position at the University since he
filed a qui tarn suit last October seeking dam
ages for its alleged overbilling of indirect costs.
University officials said Biddle should
resign immediately rather than at the end of
the month.
"As of this moment, the conflict of interest
continues to exist," Horton said. "We are
deeply troubled and concerned about the fact
that it has persisted for such a
long period of time. He should
leave as of now."
"We are eager to work with an
administrative contracting officer
who does not have a conflict of
interest," he added.
Biddle's efforts at Stanford
led to a review of indirect-cost
recovery practices at universi
ties nationwide. Biddle has
alleged that Stanford over
charged the government by as
much as $480 million during the
1980s.
M I am very much afraid that
when I leave Stanford, everything
will go to hell again," Biddle said.
"But I believe that the vitality in
the system will fill the void of my
departure."
The 14th Congressional Dis
trict seat, which includes Stan
ford, is being vacated by Law
Prof. Tom Campbell, who is run
ning for the seat of retiring Sen.
Alan Cranston, D-Calif.
Biddle will face stiff competi
tion in the Republican primary
from Assemblyman Dixon Arnett

and San Mateo County Supervi
sor Tom Huening.
Bob Marks, Huening's cam
paign manager, said, "We wel
come him into the race," but
added that Huening will not con
centrate on fighting Biddle.
"We are clearly the front-run
ner .. . and we will focus on defin
ing Tom Huening for the voters,"
Marks said.
Biddle admitted that his
chances are "slim" because other
candidates have more money.
Huening's campaign already has
the endorsements of David
Packard and Hoover Institution
Distinguished Fellow George
Shultz.
But Biddle's campaign will
not be lacking its own influen
tial supporters, as he claims
among his friends the powerful
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
chair of the House Subcommit
tee on Oversight and Investiga
tions
Biddle said he hopes to
appeal to the middle class by
"understanding what my con
stituency wants" and focusing
his skills as a certified public
accountant on the nation's eco
nomic problems.
