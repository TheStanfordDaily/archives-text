# Reporter probes heroism, despair of AIDS

### Anna Buchmann Staff writer 
Reporter Steve Sternberg says
his award-winning coverage of
the AIDS epidemic was so profes
sionally and personally wrenching
that he's hoping to do less of it.
Sternberg, visiting at Stanford
this year as a Knight Fellow, began
following a person who was dying of
AIDS in 1988. The series of stories
he wrote for the Atlanta Journal
and Constitution — about AIDS
victim Tom Fox and his family and
friends — occupied Sternberg until
Fox's death a year and a half later.
"Everyone I got to know
through the story was either sick or
dying," Sternberg said. He spent

his weekends and evenings almost
exclusively with people infected
with HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS.
But Sternberg said he remains
interested in many of the issues
surrounding the AIDS crisis, par
ticularly "questions related to pri
vacy." The Knight Fellowship
program Sternberg is participat
ing in allows professional journal
ists to step back from deadline
pressure and explore issues from
an academic perspective.
The Atlanta Journal and Con
stitution sold thousands of extra
copies of its Sunday paper the day
Sternberg's series began. The
series was reprinted and is now
being used in AIDS education.

Sternberg, who wrote his first
story about AIDS in 1983, said he
realiz.ed when he began working
at the Atlanta Journal and Consti
tution five years later that the
epidemic was still not getting the
publicity it deserved.
He decided then to "write the
story of AIDS from the inside" by
following the progression of Fox's
disease from 1988 until his death
in August 1989. The series of sto
ries, entitled "When AIDS Comes
Home," won the National Head
liner Award, the Atlanta Maga
zine "Best of Atlanta" award and
the Penney-Missouri Newspaper
Award for 1990.
