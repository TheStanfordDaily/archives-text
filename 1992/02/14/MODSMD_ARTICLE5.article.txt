# Reporter probes heroism, despair of AIDS
## 
### Anna Buchmann Staff writer 
Reporter Steve Sternberg says
his award-winning coverage of
the AIDS epidemic was so profes
sionally and personally wrenching
that he's hoping to do less of it.
Sternberg, visiting at Stanford
this year as a Knight Fellow, began
following a person who was dying of
AIDS in 1988. The series of stories
he wrote for the Atlanta Journal
and Constitution — about AIDS
victim Tom Fox and his family and
friends — occupied Sternberg until
Fox's death a year and a half later.
"Everyone I got to know
through the story was either sick or
dying," Sternberg said. He spent

his weekends and evenings almost
exclusively with people infected
with HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS.
But Sternberg said he remains
interested in many of the issues
surrounding the AIDS crisis, par
ticularly "questions related to pri
vacy." The Knight Fellowship
program Sternberg is participat
ing in allows professional journal
ists to step back from deadline
pressure and explore issues from
an academic perspective.
The Atlanta Journal and Con
stitution sold thousands of extra
copies of its Sunday paper the day
Sternberg's series began. The
series was reprinted and is now
being used in AIDS education.

Sternberg, who wrote his first
story about AIDS in 1983, said he
realiz.ed when he began working
at the Atlanta Journal and Consti
tution five years later that the
epidemic was still not getting the
publicity it deserved.
He decided then to "write the
story of AIDS from the inside" by
following the progression of Fox's
disease from 1988 until his death
in August 1989. The series of sto
ries, entitled "When AIDS Comes
Home," won the National Head
liner Award, the Atlanta Maga
zine "Best of Atlanta" award and
the Penney-Missouri Newspaper
Award for 1990.

"I had written stories like these
before," said Sternberg, referring
to his series about a young cancer
patient who had undergone radi
cal treatment. "I sort of knew
what I was getting myself into."
Nevertheless, Sternberg said
he did not anticipate "what it was
suddenly like to find myself in
what was essentially a society of
doomed people."
"What kept me from being
swallowed up by the story was the
fact that most of these people
were heroic in the way they dealt
with AIDS," he said.
He stressed the courage and
mutual support that Fox and his
friends showed for each other.
They would go "hospital-hopping,"
taking plates of ho me-cooked food
from room to room in hospitals
where their friends were dying.
Sternberg said he was sur
prised by their "gallows humor."
"They were funny guys. . . . None
of us anticipated that."
In fact, the "intensity" of the
experience made it difficult for
Sternberg to stay detached, he
said, particularly since Fox
"didn't understand anything
about journalistic distance."
For example, Fox called him
up one Saturday to ask for a ride
to the hospital, Sternberg said.
Another time, Sternberg flew to
Key West to cover Fox's birthday
party and experienced firsthand
the discrimination against gays.
Sternberg said he took Fox and
his friends, all of whom were gay,
to a fish restaurant frequented by
Key West locals.When they had
repeated difficulties with discrimi
natory comments and poor service
at the restaurant, Sternberg said
he turned to his photographer to
say, "This must be gay-bashing."
Nevertheless, "discrimination,
denial and scapegoating haven't
changed" as AIDS has spread to
10 million people worldwide,
Sternberg said.
He said that although the press
has done "a very good job of cover
ing AIDS," he is disappointed with
the federal government's response
to the disease. The government,
he said, made no effort to explain
AIDS and made no effort to enlist
the help of the media.
"You look to challenges like
this to bring out the best in peo
ple, and too often they disappoint
you," he said.
Sternberg began following the
course of the disease while work
ing for the Miami Herald in 1981.
"I started writing about AIDS
because I was a medical writer
when the epidemic cropped up,"
Sternberg said.
"Unlike San Francisco and
New York, Miami was a place
where AIDS was a heterosexual
disease from the start," he said.
Although Sternberg said he
argued then for more coverage of
AIDS, "newspaper editors were very
reluctant" to cover the epidemic.
The rationalization, he
explained, was that "the people
affected were not a significant
portion of our readership."
