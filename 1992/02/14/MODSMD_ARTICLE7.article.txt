# Celebration recalls Chicano traditions
## 1940s Zoot Suiters bridged cultures

A suave guy with an attitude
— decked out in high-waisted
baggy pants, a long-tailed black
coat and a wide-collared shirt —
leans way back and touches the
rim of his hat. Swinging a watch
on a two-foot chain, this pachu
co says to you in a mixture of
Spanish and English, "Hay te
watcho" — "See you later."
He's the 1940s Zoot Suiter,
star of Stanford's fifth annual
"Zoot Suit Week," and you
might see quite a few like him
around campus tonight. They'll
be heading to a "Zoot Suit"
party at Casa Zapata, which has
sponsored the week's events
along with MEChA, a Chi

The pachuco movement, a
Chicano street gang subculture
that flourished in the 19405,
rebelled against assimilation

turned his play "Zoot Suit" into
a movie in 1980.
Not all Zoot Suiters were
pachucos, according to History
Prof. Albert Camarillo. Some
were posers, wearing the clothes
and speaking the highly distinc
tive dialect called "calo," but not
participating in the pachucos'
gang activities.
Some parents worried that
their kids, decked out in full
Zoot Suit regalia, would fall in
with the pachuco gangs.
For the Zoot Suiters, the pro
cess of change and maturation
— difficult for any teen — was
exacerbated by the fact that
"they were neither Mexican nor
American, but somewhere in
between," Camarillo said.
Camarillo sees a similar
need for Chicano youth in the
'90s to identify with their own
cohort. Some pachuco tradi
