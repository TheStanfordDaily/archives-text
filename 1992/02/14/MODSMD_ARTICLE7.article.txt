# Celebration recalls Chicano traditions
## 1940s Zoot Suiters bridged cultures 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
A suave guy with an attitude
— decked out in high-waisted
baggy pants, a long-tailed black
coat and a wide-collared shirt —
leans way back and touches the
rim of his hat. Swinging a watch
on a two-foot chain, this pachu
co says to you in a mixture of
Spanish and English, "Hay te
watcho" — "See you later."
He's the 1940s Zoot Suiter,
star of Stanford's fifth annual
"Zoot Suit Week," and you
might see quite a few like him
around campus tonight. They'll
be heading to a "Zoot Suit"
party at Casa Zapata, which has
sponsored the week's events
along with MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student group.
The pachuco movement, a
Chicano street gang subculture
that flourished in the 19405,
rebelled against assimilation
into mainstream society.
Dress code was central to
pachuco culture. The clothing
style originated in Chicago
among blacks and some whites,
according to Zapata Resident
Fellow Tony Burciaga. "It
crossed cultures," he said.
"The pachuco movement

went hand-in-hand with the big
band sound, the jitterbug . ..
and it allowed for easy move
ment, enthusiasm and the exu
berance of youth," critically
acclaimed director Luis Valdez
told The Daily in 1990. Valdez,
whose greatest commercial suc
cess was 1987's "La Bamba,"
turned his play "Zoot Suit" into
a movie in 1980.
Not all Zoot Suiters were
pachucos, according to History
Prof. Albert Camarillo. Some
were posers, wearing the clothes
and speaking the highly distinc
tive dialect called "calo," but not
participating in the pachucos'
gang activities.
Some parents worried that
their kids, decked out in full
Zoot Suit regalia, would fall in
with the pachuco gangs.
For the Zoot Suiters, the pro
cess of change and maturation
— difficult for any teen — was
exacerbated by the fact that
"they were neither Mexican nor
American, but somewhere in
between," Camarillo said.
Camarillo sees a similar
need for Chicano youth in the
'90s to identify with their own
cohort. Some pachuco tradi
tions are still very alive, he said,
including "the neighborhood
association, the connection with
turf and the kids who live there."
Valdez's play and movie are
loosely based on the two bench
marks in pachuco history: the 1942
Sleepy Lagoon mass trial, in which
22 pachucos were tried for the
murder of a Chicano teenager, and
the 1943 Los Angeles Zoot Suit
riots, which caused a national stir.
"No one really knows how the
LA riots started," Camarillo said.
Rumor has it that the catalyst
may have been a fight in an old
Venice Beach ballroom between
white servicemen and some Mexi
can-American youth, he said.
The teens may or may not have

been Zooters, but whatever the
cause, the skirmish "snowballed
quickly into a melee" between
servicemen and Zooters that last
ed several days and nights,
according to Camarillo.
Los Angeles police officers didn't
intercede during the clash. "Mexi
can-American leaders had demand
ed them to step in, but they decided
not to," Camarillo said. Marines
and army personnel stripped many
of the youths and beat them.
Tonight's party probably won't
be quite as raucous.
For aspiring pachucos and
pachucas trying to figure out
what to wear for tonight's con
test, Burciaga advised, "Have fun
doing it. If you can't afford garras
(rags), dress like a cholo, with a
button-up Pendleton with shirt
tails hanging out and a bandanna
on top."

For aspiring pachucos and
pachucas trying to figure out

button-up Pendleton with shirt
tails hanging out and a bandanna
on top."
Hay te watcho, pachuco.
