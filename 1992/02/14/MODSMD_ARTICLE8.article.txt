A 'random phone-calling frenzy'
Another wave of obscene telephone calls swept the campus
Wednesday night, the latest in a series of random phone pranks.
At least seven obscene calls were made to female students
between 9:30 and 1 1 p.m. Wednesday, apparently by the same
male caller, according to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
"This guy went on a random phone-calling frenzy," Niemeyer said.
According to Niemeyer, the caller "plays a name game" with
his victims, pretending to know them and asking them to guess
his identity. He finally identifies himself as "Rob" or "Ron,"
Niemeyer said.
The caller claims to be babysitting a child named "Amy" or
"Emily," Niemeyer said. He allegedly asks the victim to stay on
the phone, then returns and says,"I just masturbated on her."
"This guy has done this before," Niemeyer said, adding that
this wave of calls is particularly disturbing because there is a
"child-molesting theme involved."
Niemeyer said that if women receive telephone calls and "don't
know who it is immediately, they should hang up."
Reports of the "name game" caller follow 12 complaints made
earlier this month to Stanford Police about two other obscene
callers, the "survey taker" and the "midnight caller."

Hanging out in Meyer
A man in his late twenties dropped his pants on the third floor
of Meyer Library last night, exposing himself to two female stu
dents studying for midterm exams there, according to Ben Mar
tin, an evening supervisor at Meyer.
Marilyn Calvey, a receptionist at Meyer, said she did not believe
the man was a Stanford student. According to Calvey, the man had
attempted to enter the library using a NASA identification card.
"This is the reason this is a closed library now," she said.
Calvey said flashers have been seen in the library at least 10
times in the past five years.
According to Hilary Karp, a sergeant with the Stanford Depart
ment of Public S.ifety, indecent exposure is a misdemeanor, unless the
culprit has a previous arrest for the same crime. Karp said the police
had no suspects in this case, although witnesses provided a descrip
tion of the man.
Karp added that this is probably not the first time the man has
exposed himself, although such incidents are seldom reported.
"Somebody who really has a problem will commit 100 indecent
exposures before they're caught," Karp said.
