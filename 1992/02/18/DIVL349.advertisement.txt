The drive to be
the best
Ten years, hundreds of accolades and
millions of sales dollars later, the people of
Quantum still aren't satisfied. Because to
us, being the best means more than consis
tently outdoing the competition with our
innovative disk drive products. It's also an
inner drive—one that compels us to con
tinually top our own personal bests.
lliat kind of drive is responsible for
the industry's first drive on a card, the first
1" profile 3-1/2" drive, and now a family of
high-speed 2-1/2" drives. And 10
consecutive quarters of sales growth.
Are you driven?
We take only thebest —and we return
the favor. We offer a generous compensa
tion and benefits package as well as a
Quantum
superior work environment at our head
quarters located in Mijpitas, California —
the heart of Silicon Valley.
If you work smart hard and fast —
like us—and are pursuing a degree in
Engineering, we'd like to meet you.
On-campus interviews
for Engineering students
Monday, February 24th.
See your Career Placement
Center for more details.
If you miss us on February 24th, send
your resume to: Quantum Corporation,
Human Resources Dept., 500 McCarthy
