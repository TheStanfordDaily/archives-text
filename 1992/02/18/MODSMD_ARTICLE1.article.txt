But he argued in a press con
ference yesterday at the Hoover
Institution that "some of those
remarks," which implied that
U.S. workers are lazy, "have been
misunderstood or given without
adequate explanation."
Although some Japanese politi
cians who have an inadequate
understanding of the United States
may have made "inadvertent"
remarks, Nakasone said, "Overall,
all politicians in Japan — with the
possible exception of the Commu
nist Party — have favorable feel
ings and respect for the U.S."
Nakasone said he is aware
through Japanese press reports
that there is anti-Japanese senti

with the U.S.

relations are considered "the
important underpinning for the
security of the world."
Nakasone added that Japan
will stay on friendly terms with
the United States. "While on the
surface these frictions are caus
ing waves, through efforts on
both sides I think that those
waves can be calmed," he said.

ister of Japan from 1982 to 1987, is
