# Nakasone: 'Waves can be calmed'
## Former Japanese leader stresses need for friendly, fair U.S. relations 
### Alain Dalva Staff writer 
In a visit to Stanford, former
Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhi
ro Nakasone said he regrets that
recent remarks made by Japanese
politicians have caused trouble in
But he argued in a press con
ference yesterday at the Hoover
Institution that "some of those
remarks," which implied that
U.S. workers are lazy, "have been
misunderstood or given without
adequate explanation."
Although some Japanese politi
cians who have an inadequate
understanding of the United States
may have made "inadvertent"
remarks, Nakasone said, "Overall,
all politicians in Japan — with the
possible exception of the Commu
nist Party — have favorable feel
ings and respect for the U.S."
Nakasone said he is aware
through Japanese press reports
that there is anti-Japanese senti
ment in the United States, specif
ically over Japan's trade surplus
with the U.S.
But in Japan, he said, U.S.
relations are considered "the
important underpinning for the
security of the world."
Nakasone added that Japan
will stay on friendly terms with
the United States. "While on the
surface these frictions are caus
ing waves, through efforts on
both sides I think that those
waves can be calmed," he said.

Institution. He leaves tonight.
After the press conference,
Hoover Distinguished Fellow
George Shultz joked of Nakasone:
"I'm going to drive him to his
hotel in an American car."
Through a translator, Nakasone
answered various questions con
cerning Japanese criticism of U.S.
domestic policies, anti-Japanese
sentiments in the United States,
trade agreements and technology.
Nakasone said both the United
States and Japan are determined
to correct the trade imbalances
"through structural and macro
economic policies on both sides."
He called Bush's visit to Japan a
"great success."
Nakasone also discussed the
Structural Impediment Initiative
talks, which were held one year
ago between Japan and the Unit
ed States.
He stressed that "much improve

ment has been achieved" on the
Japanese side, although the United
States has not demonstrated as
much improvement, particularly in
areas such as the budget deficit.
The talks began in 1988 and
have attempted to allow greater
American access to Japanese mar
kets through structural changes
in the U.S. and Japanese econom
ic systems, according to Judith
Goldstein, associate professor of
political science.
Noting the trade imbalances
between the United States and
Japan, Nakasone said yesterday
that his country's target is to
increase its import share of semi
conductors from 14 to 20 percent.
He said Japanese auto manu
facturers, learning from the posi
tive example provided by the
semiconductor industry, will like
ly allow more American auto
parts to be sold in Japan.
"Major efforts are underway" in
areas related to high technology,
Nakasone said, adding that "we
will see gradual improvements
ahead."
