## When teasing goes too far 
### 
IWAS PLAYING ASSASSIN with my
dorm and had gone to the library
when I ran into an acquaintance,
someone I hardly knew. It was the funni
est thing to him that I could hope to
defend myself with a squirtgun. He shot
me a couple of times, laughing, to show
me how defenseless I really was. I tried to
laugh it off at first, but when he contin
ued to tease me, I began to get annoyed
and told him repeatedly to stop.
By then my face was dripping wet, and
it wasn't funny anymore. I threw up my
arms and backed away, then finally just
ran down the stairs when he wouldn't
stop. He followed and apologized but
squirted me one more time as a joke.
Why don't you listen ? How do I make
you stop ?
The image of the coy woman lives on
in many people's minds. They think it's
such a joke when we say that no means
no and yes means yes. Why don't they
take it seriously? Why don't they take
women seriously?
And no one thinks the little things
matter. Like standing too close to a
woman — a subconscious intimidation.
What man would feel threatened in the
same situation? How many women would
not feel uncomfortable?
Like someone in my dorm tickling me.
Someone that I don't know very well.
He corners me in a doorway. "Stop it,"
I tell him. "I'm warning you. I'm not kid

ding." And for a minute he does not take
me seriously.
Like another man hitting me whenev
er he says hi. Not too hard. Not too light.
"Stop it," I say. He doesn't listen. He
doesn't believe.
Like calling any woman that stands in
your way a bitch. She is a woman who
says no, will not be intimidated, and thus
must be belittled. Like calling a fellow
doctor "honey" in front of a patient.
Stop. Don't. No. Why aren't you listen
ing? Why don't you understand 1 ?
Sensitivity does not require fear,
silence or avoidance on the part of men.
It means awareness and listening. It
means respect and consideration.
And for a woman it means not being
afraid to stand up for herself, to face being
called "too sensitive" or a "bitch." It
means saying no all the more loudly and
learning how to make someone stop with
self-defense techniques, if necessary.
Many times since coming to Stanford I
have felt completely powerless. Having
believed that I was an equal member of
this society, I was disillusioned when I
discovered how vulnerable I really was.
We all come here as individuals on the
strength of our minds, but discover that
it doesn't matter in the face of someone
else's physical strength, or in the face of
prejudice or sexism.
Living off campus in Menlo Park last
year, I was afraid every night when I

'Stop.
Don't.
No.
Why aren't you
listening?
Why don't you
understand?'

biked down a dark stretch of road lined
with bushes. I am afraid still when I bike
to section at night in the engineering
quad. How easy it would be for someone
to accost me and take anything they
wanted, despite my protests. And I am
angry at the unfairness of it all.
Why can't I feel safe ?
People talk about empowerment. I've
lost the confidence to walk down streets
alone at night, to believe that I can
defend myself, to believe that people will
take me seriously, will stop when I say
no. For many years I accepted the fear as
a fact of life. Only now do I realize that it
should not be this way.
Empowerment is a term included in
the aura of multiculturalism. How little
we think about what it really means. It is
confidence in and respect for oneself. I
have the chance to be empowered, to
regain my rights as an equal citizen. But
will I learn before "Issues in Self-Defense
for Women" is slashed out of the budget?

Jane Lin would like to correct a state
ment in last week's column: Hoover Fel

ferent races, not just blacks and whites,
for his racism study.

It means awareness and listening. It
means respect and consideration.
And for a woman it means not being
afraid to stand up for herself, to face being
called "too sensitive" or a "bitch." It
means saying no all the more loudly and
learning how to make someone stop with
self-defense techniques, if necessary.
Many times since coming to Stanford I
have felt completely powerless. Having
believed that I was an equal member of
this society, I was disillusioned when I
discovered how vulnerable I really was.
We all come here as individuals on the
strength of our minds, but discover that
it doesn't matter in the face of someone
else's physical strength, or in the face of
prejudice or sexism.
Living off campus in Menlo Park last
year, I was afraid every night when I

'Stop.
Don't.
No.
Why aren't you
listening?
Why don't you
understand?'

biked down a dark stretch of road lined
with bushes. I am afraid still when I bike
to section at night in the engineering
quad. How easy it would be for someone
to accost me and take anything they
wanted, despite my protests. And I am
angry at the unfairness of it all.
Why can't I feel safe ?
People talk about empowerment. I've
lost the confidence to walk down streets
alone at night, to believe that I can
defend myself, to believe that people will
take me seriously, will stop when I say
no. For many years I accepted the fear as
a fact of life. Only now do I realize that it
should not be this way.
Empowerment is a term included in
the aura of multiculturalism. How little
we think about what it really means. It is
confidence in and respect for oneself. I
have the chance to be empowered, to
regain my rights as an equal citizen. But
will I learn before "Issues in Self-Defense
for Women" is slashed out of the budget?
