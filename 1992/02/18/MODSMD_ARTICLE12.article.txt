Legalistic attitude disregards moral considerations

Â£ {TWILL DO THIS BECAUSE I can
I get away with it. I know the letter
J. of the law, and intend to skirt it
as closely as I can. I can't be touched
because I know the legal limits." This
paraphrases first-year law student Keith
Ilabois' justification of his Otero out
burst. It also summarizes the attitudes
of many leaders at Stanford. It enrages
and disgusts me.
This attitude is repulsive because it
explicitly denies the underlying spirit of
any rules a community establishes. It
rejects the concept of doing the right
thing simply because it is the right
thing. Unfortunately, it is a pervasive
attitude at Stanford. It raises its ugly
head constantly these days.

The indirect-cost debacle, the current
tuition increase and the Bookstore perks
brouhaha are all, like the Rabois inci
dent, examples of this elitist attitude.
The University used this logic to jus
tify its actions before and after its indi
rect-cost maneuvers were revealed. Sign
ing hundreds of Memoranda of Under
standing, sending staff around the coun
try to do seminars on how to squeeze the
most from indirect-cost rates and the
defensive "we were within our rights"
posture taken by Kennedy and his staff
are all examples of this same legalistic
attitude.
Similarly, this logic underlies the cur
rent tuition increase. The University is
raising tuition because it can. The pri-

mary justification is that our competitor
schools (20 selected elite institutions
with which we compete) continue to
raise tuition. According to admissions
office data, those students who are most
hurt by tuition increases (the lowest
family incomes not qualifying for finan
cial aid) do not make admission deci
sions based on tuition.
For this reason Stanford has aban
doned the position of educational leader
in the area of capping tuition increases.
"We had no followers" is not a moral
justification for abandoning a position of
leadership. That this action will gener
ate only $3 million, but will sorely
impact currently enrolled students at
the same time that financial aid criteria

are being tightened seems to have
escaped these well-heeled decision mak
ers.
Finally, there are the outrageous
perks offered to the managers of the
bookstore: a non-profit corporation
charged with serving students, faculty
and staff, not with generating profits.
The conflict of interest in refurbishing
property owned by these managers for
their use and ultimate profit at the
expense of the bookstore is repulsive.
Why does this amoral legalistic atti
tude underlie so many actions? It is an
integral part of our Robber Baron her
itage.
