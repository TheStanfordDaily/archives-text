# Media delivers guilty verdict with coverage
## 
### 
We are writing in support of our
friend and colleague, Dr. Mark Perlroth.
After a lengthy, difficult and very costly
battle with Stanford University, an amica
ble compromise settlement was reached
which produced a public statement by the
University markedly different from the
original charges of sexual harassment
released to the press last summer.
The agreement to settle implies that
both sides had gained by avoiding a judi
cial process before the Advisory Board.
Although a letter of censure is a seri
ous step on the University's part, it is in
fact the mildest response available to the
president short of acquittal. The confi
dentiality of the agreement is designed
to protect all parties, including the com
plainants and the University.
It seems unfair to Perlroth and his
family that this outcome is being treated
by the media as the equivalent of guilt of
the original charges. These charges were

denied by Perlroth and never proven,
nor have they been repeated publicly by
the University.
Also, the University has made it clear
that his performance and reputation as a
physician is unquestioned.
We hope for a rapid reconciliation
between the community, the administra
tion and Perlroth and we look forward to
working with him in the future.
