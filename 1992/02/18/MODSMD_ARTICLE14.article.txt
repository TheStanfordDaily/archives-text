# Press attention paid to Bookstore unfair
## 
### 
The amount of negative press that the
Stanford Bookstore has been receiving as
of late has been unfair and misdirected.
Chastising a non-profit organization
for giving its employees benefits encour
ages the erroneous stereotype that all
non-profit organizations are grant
dependent, minimum wage institutions.

If I am not mistaken, Stanford Uni
versity itself is a non-profit organization
and yet the President — and who knows
how many other top officials — gets a
house to live in all year round, quite like
the vacation spot that is shared by all
bookstore higher-ups.
In addition, the Hoover Institution is a
non-profit organization, but maintains two
vehicles for the use of its top staff, as well
as two Pierce-Mitchell condominiums.
It would actually be beneficial to have
more non-profits pick up the Bookstore's
mentality of pleasing its workers so that
they will stay and be inspired to do bet
ter work.
Stanford students should know that
they are quite lucky to have a bookstore
that gives refunds. This is unheard of at
most colleges around the nation. Also,
book prices are set by publishers and
textbooks are going to be just as expen
sive anywhere you buy them.
I implore The Daily and all those in the
media to present this "scandal" in a more
fair and realistic light.
