## Cardinal explodes, runs over hapless Bears Loss of Hendrick stuns Cal 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
When you put a team on a mission against a team
in remission, the results can be very one-sided. And
when the lesser team loses its leading scorer and
rebounder during the game, it's considerably worse.
Such was the case on Saturday in Oakland, as Stan
ford got solid performances from all five starters and
it's bench while California
flailed without their star, Brian Hendrick.
The Cardinal opened the game up early, bursting
out to an 18-4 lead in the first seven minutes. The
Bears were simply unable to get in the flow of the
game, committing 10 first-half turnovers and scor
ing their points on transition breaks rather than
their set offense. But three minutes later, just as Cal
began to get back in the contest, closing within eight
points to 19-11, disaster struck.
With Cal on offense, Bear forward Lamond Mur
ray crashed inside for a rebound, knocking Stanford
forward Brent Williams into Adam Keefe. Keefe and
Cal forward Brian Hendrick collided away from the
ball. While Keefe escaped with a bruise on his knee,
Hendrick was not as lucky, dislocating his patella
(kneecap) on the play. Hendrick was out for the
game — and the season.
With Hendrick out, Cal seemed to lose its heart.
Hendrick's departure, coupled with 57.1 percent
shooting by Stanford, saw the Cardinal take a 22
point lead into halftime.
"Losing Brian at the time we did was really dev
astating to the team," said Cal coach Lou Campan
elli. "They (the team) look to him for leadership, and
that took a lot out of us at that point .... After
Brian went out I don't think we competed as well as
we can compete."
"That (the loss of Hendrick) really took the wind
out of their sails," added Stanford guard Peter
Dukes.
As if things could not get any worse for Cal, cen
ter Ryan Jamison injured his eJbow in the second
half after falling hard to the floor, and was removed
from the game, receiving four stitches.
Further, Bear guard Billy Dreher, who led the
Pacific 10 Conference in three-point shooting a year
ago, was confined to the end of the bench. Dreher
was in coach Campanelli's doghouse for missing
practice and was put in the ballgame with only five
minutes left with the game well-in-hand for Stan
ford.
"It (the loss of Hendrick) hit us really hard. We
didn't know what to think or how to react to it," said
Cal forward A 1 Grigsby.
"We came out to play in the second half, but our
minds were really on Brian."
"We were ready to play," said head coach Mike
Montgomery. "We weren't going to give up — and
then, when they lose their best player, that's tough
(to come back from)."
