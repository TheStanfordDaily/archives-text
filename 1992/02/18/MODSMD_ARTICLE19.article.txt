# Stanford rolls in big Pac-10 win, 92-66
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Stanford bludgeoned California
92-66 Saturday in basketball's
version of the Big Game.
If there were an Axe for basket
ball, Cal would surrender it for
safety purposes.
Given the way the Bears han
dled the basketball, they would
undoubtedly imperil themselves
with a sharper object.
Cal turned the ball over 17
times and appeared unprepared
and uncomfortable before a
"home" crowd of 13,000 at the
Oakland Coliseum Arena.
Stanford raced to an early 18-4
lead and built a 33-point advan
tage before the referees sealed off
the scene of the crime.
The last-place Bears (8-12, 2-8
in the Pacific 10 Conference) start
ed four freshmen and were over
whelmed from the opening tip.
With the season sweep of the
Bears, Stanford (14-6, 6-4) solidi
fied its hold on fourth place in the
Pac-10.
Despite a non-conference set
back to Notre Dame last Tuesday,
Stanford has won three of its last
four Pac-10 games and leads fifth
place Arizona State (5-6) by one
and-a-half games
"The kids really prepared
themselves well today," said Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery.
"They were really focused from
the start of the ballgame. They
knew how much we needed this
one."
Adam Keefe scored seven of
Stanford's first nine points as the
Cardinal exploded out of the start
ing block.
With a season-best boost from
the bench, Stanford built a 24-
point first-half lead and cruised to
the finish.
"They were very quiet on the
way over and it was obvious they
were going to be ready to play,"
Montgomery said. "Our intensity
level at the beginning of the game
really set the tone."
The slow-starting Bears stalled
completely when leading scorer

Brian Hendrick (16.7 points, 11.3
rebounds per game) exited with 10
minutes, 39 seconds left in the
first half.
The 6-foot-9 Hendrick, who
missed the first Stanford-Cal
game with a sprained ankle, sepa
rated the patella in his right knee
during a four-player pileup under
the basket.
The junior forward is expected
to be out for the season but can
expect full recovery, said team
physician Dr. Jerry Patmont.
Stanford reacted with a 22-8
run, highlighted by nifty inside
moves from center Jim Morgan
and six fastbreak points from
Kenny Hicks. Keefe scored 19 of
his game-high 23 points in the
opening stanza, including his third
three-pointer of the year.
Keefe, who suffered a slight
knee sprain during the Hendrick
pileup, exited with 7:38 left. He
will need to be at full strength
Thursday as Stanford visits No. 3
UCLA.
The Ravn Report
Headlining the Cardinal reserves,
redshirt freshman Nick Ravn came
off the couch to grab three rebounds
in the final four minutes of play for a
game-high .75 rebounds per minute
average.
Ravn (pronounced "Ron"), is a
burly 6-7 forward from Spencer,
lowa, best known for his smooth
faced jumper.

the finish.
"They were very quiet on the
way over and it was obvious they
were going to be ready to play,"
Montgomery said. "Our intensity
level at the beginning of the game
really set the tone."
The slow-starting Bears stalled
completely when leading scorer

Brian Hendrick (16.7 points, 11.3
rebounds per game) exited with 10
minutes, 39 seconds left in the
first half.
The 6-foot-9 Hendrick, who
missed the first Stanford-Cal
game with a sprained ankle, sepa
rated the patella in his right knee
during a four-player pileup under
the basket.
The junior forward is expected
to be out for the season but can
expect full recovery, said team
physician Dr. Jerry Patmont.
Stanford reacted with a 22-8
run, highlighted by nifty inside
moves from center Jim Morgan
and six fastbreak points from
Kenny Hicks. Keefe scored 19 of
his game-high 23 points in the
opening stanza, including his third
three-pointer of the year.
Keefe, who suffered a slight
knee sprain during the Hendrick
pileup, exited with 7:38 left. He
will need to be at full strength
Thursday as Stanford visits No. 3
UCLA.
The Ravn Report
Headlining the Cardinal reserves,
redshirt freshman Nick Ravn came
off the couch to grab three rebounds
in the final four minutes of play for a
game-high .75 rebounds per minute
average.
Ravn (pronounced "Ron"), is a
burly 6-7 forward from Spencer,
lowa, best known for his smooth
faced jumper.

Stanford bludgeoned California
92-66 Saturday in basketball's
version of the Big Game.
If there were an Axe for basket
ball, Cal would surrender it for
safety purposes.
Given the way the Bears han
dled the basketball, they would
undoubtedly imperil themselves
with a sharper object.
Cal turned the ball over 17
times and appeared unprepared
and uncomfortable before a
"home" crowd of 13,000 at the
Oakland Coliseum Arena.
Stanford raced to an early 18-4
lead and built a 33-point advan
tage before the referees sealed off
the scene of the crime.
The last-place Bears (8-12, 2-8
in the Pacific 10 Conference) start
ed four freshmen and were over
whelmed from the opening tip.
With the season sweep of the
Bears, Stanford (14-6, 6-4) solidi
fied its hold on fourth place in the
Pac-10.
Despite a non-conference set
back to Notre Dame last Tuesday,
Stanford has won three of its last
four Pac-10 games and leads fifth
place Arizona State (5-6) by one
and-a-half games
"The kids really prepared
themselves well today," said Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery.
"They were really focused from
the start of the ballgame. They
knew how much we needed this
one."
Adam Keefe scored seven of
Stanford's first nine points as the
Cardinal exploded out of the start
ing block.
With a season-best boost from
the bench, Stanford built a 24-
point first-half lead and cruised to
the finish.
"They were very quiet on the
way over and it was obvious they
were going to be ready to play,"
Montgomery said. "Our intensity
level at the beginning of the game
really set the tone."
