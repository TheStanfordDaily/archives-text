# Freshman English pilot program begins next fall
## A 						few non-English grad students will teach 
### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
Despite the objections of some English
professors, an "experiment" using gradu
ate students from departments other than
English as Freshman English instructors
will begin next year, Assoc. Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Carolyn Lougee
said yesterday.
If the three-student pilot program suc
ceeds, it may be expanded to include more
Humanities and Sciences graduate stu
dents from departments such as history,
she said.
Lougee also said some Freshman
English lecturers may be cut if more gradu
ate students are used. But she added that it
is unlikely that all of the lecturers will be
eliminated.
"We thought [eliminating the lecturers]
would save us money at first," Lougee said.

However, the difference
between a lecturer's and a
graduate student's salaries
is not enough to merit cre
ating the program for
money-saving purposes
alone, she said.
A number of English
professors said yesterday
that they object to the
change, arguing it will

damage the quality of teaching in Fresh
man English.
English Prof. Nancy Packer said the pilot
program is leading Freshman English in the
wrong direction. "It's possible to absorb
fthe three graduate students], but if they
are a harbinger of things to come, it will be
a disaster for the program," she said.
But Lougee emphasized that the change

is limited and will not cause major
changes in the Freshman English
program.
"It won't be an important bud
get reduction," Lougee said.
"Right now, we're looking at the
educational benefits. ... It will be
a good part of graduate training
and a way of supporting graduate
students outside of English."
Packer said the problem is that
graduate students from depart
ments other than English "are not
primarily interested in language
and the written word. They won't
be teaching as part of their profes
sional development. They're only
doing it to make money."
According to Lougee, another
motive for the plan is that there
will be "more students looking for
more opportunities to teach" next
year because the teaching require
ment for Humanities and Sciences
graduate students will increase.
The requirement will increase
because there has been a change
in the balance of funding for the
graduate fellowships, Lougee said.
Anne Watters, the acting direc
tor of Freshman English, said the
English Department is trying to
hire more students who are on
fellowships because they cost less
money. Because the number of
English graduate student fellows
has been low, there is a need for
students from other departments
to teach.
According to Watters, 14 lec
turers have been used in the pro
gram this year, with each teach-

ing six sections. Graduate stu
dents currently teach a maximum
of three sections per year.
Watters said she has "mixed
feelings" about the idea. The stu
dents "will be teaching another
field. The training they get is
bound to be superficial," she said.
"The quality of Freshman English
will probably suffer."
English Prof. George Dekker
said the addition of the other
graduate students could also hurt
the apprentice system now used
by the English Department, in
which each graduate student is
apprenticed to a lecturer or an
experienced teacher for a quarter.
"The quality of Freshman
English depends on a combina
tion of excellent lecturers and a
small core of graduate students
who have been carefully trained,"
Dekker said. "If there a more
than a few (non-English) gradu
ate students, it could compromise
the quality of the program."
English graduate students also
take a course to learn how to teach
composition, in addition to their
graduate studies, Dekker said.
Because English is not their
focus, graduate students outside
English may not be interested in
this training, he said.
