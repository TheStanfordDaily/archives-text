						few non-English grad students will teach

Despite the objections of some English
professors, an "experiment" using gradu
ate students from departments other than
English as Freshman English instructors
will begin next year, Assoc. Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Carolyn Lougee
said yesterday.
If the three-student pilot program suc
ceeds, it may be expanded to include more
Humanities and Sciences graduate stu
dents from departments such as history,
she said.
Lougee also said some Freshman
English lecturers may be cut if more gradu
ate students are used. But she added that it
is unlikely that all of the lecturers will be
eliminated.
"We thought [eliminating the lecturers]
would save us money at first," Lougee said.

However, the difference
between a lecturer's and a
graduate student's salaries
is not enough to merit cre
ating the program for
money-saving purposes
alone, she said.
A number of English
professors said yesterday
that they object to the
change, arguing it will

damage the quality of teaching in Fresh
man English.
English Prof. Nancy Packer said the pilot
program is leading Freshman English in the
wrong direction. "It's possible to absorb
fthe three graduate students], but if they
are a harbinger of things to come, it will be
a disaster for the program," she said.
But Lougee emphasized that the change
