# Women destroy UCLA, USC, take lead in Pac-10
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
The typical pattern of performance for
a Tara VanDerveer-coached team is an
elevation of play at the end of a season.
As in individual games, her squad seems
to accelerate at the end, often racking up
over a hundred points several times in
the last few games.
This year's Stanford women's basket
ball team is just about to head into that
stretch run, and this weekend it showed
that it is once again prepared to rip
through the competition on the way to
the ever-nearing NCAAs. On Friday the
Cardinal laid waste to UCLA, 92-69, and
on Sunday it devastated USC, 73-51.
On what was to be the most difficult
and most critical road trip of the year, the

Cardinal demonstrated another trait of
VanDerveer-coached teams: the ability to
win the ones that count.
Going in to the weekend, Stanford was
tied with California for first place in the
Pacific 10 Conference. UCLA and USC
were right behind, tied for third. Stan
ford emerged from the four-team fracas
with sole possession of first place and a
steaming locomotive's worth of momen
tum.
The two keys to the Cardinal's victory
over the Bruins were the team's defen
sive play and the all-around unconscious
performance of Christy Hedgpeth.
Newly returned to the starting lineup,
Hedgpeth's play served as an emphatic
announcement that she belongs there
and will not be moved. The sophomore
scored a career-high 26 points on nine-of

10 shooting, including four-of-five from
three-point range. She was perfect from
the free throw line, hitting all four of her
shots.
Hedgpeth also snagged seven
rebounds, an unusually high number for
a guard, and tallied three assists and four
steals. For her efforts this weekend,
including her solid 16-point performance
on Sunday, Hedgpeth was named the
Pac-10's Player of the Week.
Three other Stanford players scored in
double figures, and although UCLA
boasted the game's two top rebounders,
the Cardinal outperformed the Pac-10-
leading Bruins in that category, 47-46.
However, half of the Bruins' boards were
offensive.
Stanford compensated for the offen
sive rebound discrepancy by shutting

down the Bruin offense. The Cardinal,
while shooting 53.4 percent themselves,
held the Bruins to 31.3 percent shooting
for the game.
Despite the presence of UCLA guard
Dede Mosman, who had averaged 50 per
cent accuracy on her three-point shots in
Pac-10 play, Stanford took a risk and
double- and occasionally triple-teamed
Bruin center Natalie Williams.
The risk paid off, as a cold-shooting
Mosman (one-for-12, one-for-six three
point) could not help ease the pressure on
Williams, who ended up with only six
points.
But Williams was only one of two all
everything centers which Stanford shut
down over the weekend. The other was
USC's Lisa Leslie. Only this time the
Cardinal accomplished it not by double

teams, but by taking Leslie out of the
game with foul trouble.
With Leslie sitting out for most of the
second h«.lf, USC played like a team with
out a soul. The Trojans were ineffective
on both ends of the court.
Stanford shot an unreal 60 percent in
the second half, while holding USC to an
absolutely netherworldly 20.7 percent
shooting form the field. The Cardinal
outscored the Trojans 44-18 in the sec
ond period.
As Stanford rolls into the final stretch
of its regular season schedule, the team is
already vying for seeding in the NCAA
tournament. Should the Cardinal win the
remainder of its games, it would probably
be awarded the No. 1 seed in the Western
Region, which will be played this year at
Washington, Stanford's arch-rival.
