# Batters outplay No. 4 Waves, sweep weekend series
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team underwent presea
son midterms of sorts this past weekend at Sunken
Diamond.
The Cardinal hosted the Pepperdine Waves for a
three game series, quite an assignment considering
the ability of the Waves, ranked fourth nationally
by Baseball America.
However, Stanford, ranked twelfth before the
weekend series, passed all tests with flying colors,
sweeping the three games with a win on Saturday
and two more in a holiday double header on Mon
day.
"Pepperdine has a great team," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess. "They've got great
pitching, defense, hitting . . . they're really a quali
ty team. For us to win was very important."
The success began on Saturday, when the Cardi
nal dominated the Waves in every facet of the game.
From the mound, Stanford's Brian Sackinsky
taught a few lessons to Pepperdine hitters, going a
strong eight and a third innings, allowing one run
on four hits while striking out two.
Surprisingly enough, Stanford also schooled the
Waves from the plate, mustering 10 hits to Pepper
dine's four. Leading the way were seniors Tony Det
ter and Steve Solomon, who had two hits apiece,
and designated hitter Dusty Allen, who is acclimat
ing himself extremely well to the third spot in the
batting order.
Allen went 3-4 with an RBI on Saturday, but that
was only the beginning for the big freshman. After
a Sunday rain-out, Monday's doubleheader saw
Allen continue his clutch heroics.
The first half of the doubleheader pitted Stan
ford's Rick Helling against Pepperdine's preseason
All-American Derek Wallace. Indeed, Wallace did

look like an All-American for the first seven
innings, limiting the Cardinal to only three hits.
Meanwhile, at the plate, the Waves had eight hits,
and going into the bottom of the eighth, the score
was 3-0, Pepperdine.
But what an eighth inning. The fireworks start
ed when, with one out, freshman shortstop Jed
Hansen hit a homerun to deep right center. Lead
down to two. Then, after a Jeffrey Hammonds sin
gle, Allen struck again as he launched a Wallace
offering over the left centerfield wall. Tie ball
game.
In the bottom of the ninth, Stanford broke the tie
when, after David Holbrook and Solomon were con
secutively hit by pitches on 0-2 counts, Detter and
sophomore second baseman Jeff DesJardins hit
back to back sacrifice bunts, the latter of the two a
squeeze play at the plate which scored Holbrook
and won the game.
The sequel to the first game turned out to be as
hard fought as the first. Jamie Sepeda started the
game for the Cardinal, with Steve Duda on the
mound for the Waves.
Stanford got on the board first, but a seesaw
game eventually resulted in extra innings. Finally,
in the bottom of the tenth, Allen came through once
more by singling in Hammonds to win the game.
"Dusty doesn't seem to be bothered by the three
spot [in the lineup]," Marquess said. "I don't think
he knows he's a freshman. He has no fear at the
plate, and is an aggressive player."
The result of all the winning at Sunken Diamond
this past weekend? An 'A' in preseason 101, and a
message sent out to teams and rankings, which will
surely reflect the Cardinal's wins.
And the 9-3 Cardinal will attempt to continue
the winning trend today as they take on the San
Jose State Spartans at Sunken Diamond. Game
time will be 2 p.m.
