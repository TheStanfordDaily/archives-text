# No. 3 Card netters storm by No. 8 Hurricanes 5-1
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Although wind and rain have
dictated events at the Stanford
Tennis Stadium for the past few
days, when it came to battling
with Hurricanes, the Cardinal
men were in control every step of
the way.
The third-ranked Stanford
men took No. 8 Miami by storm
Sunday afternoon with a crushing
5-1 victory. After several rain
delays, the threatening skies held
long enough for all the singles
matches to be completed. All
three doubles matches were
rained out.
"I was really, really pleased,"
said head coach Dick Gould. "It
was a great team effort and a solid
win. Chris (Cocotos) and Michael
(Flanagan) in particular did a
super job."
Cocotos defeated Daniel deßoer
of Germany 6-3, 6-4. The Stanford
sophomore was up 5-2 in the sec
ond when he decided to play
around a bit. However, at 5-4, he
quickly got back down to business
and wrapped up the match.

"He played one of the most
solid matches I've seen from him
since he's been at Stanford,"
Gould said. "He was thinking the
whole time. He really sustained
his concentration and didn't have
too many careless shots. He
played with rhythm and came off
the ground at the right time."
Flanagan also walked all over
his opponent, Johan Milbrink of
Sweden 6-2, 6-1.
"To beat (Milbrink) two and
one is a really solid effort. That's
tough to do. He probably won't
lose a match that badly for the
rest of the season," Gould
remarked. "Michael competed
really well, he played the points
well. He does need to keep work
ing on his second serve, though."
Top Cardinal hitter Alex
O'Brien had many second serves
in his long duel with Swede
Fredrik Perman. After starting
tentatively and having trouble
with his first serves, O'Brien
pulled out the first set 6-4 but was
blanked in the second set 0-6. He
managed to toughen up enough to
capture a 6-4 third set, and
ensure a Cardinal team victory.

"In general, Alex was not set
ting up well," Gould said. "The
balls were heavy because the air
was heavy, so he was pretty tenta
tive at the start. He did a nice job
after the second set though and
toughened up even more than the
other guy did. They had some
great tennis in the third set."
At fifth and sixth singles Jason
Yee and Vimal Patel defeated a
Dutchman and a Haitian in
straight sets 7-6, 6-1 and 6-1, 7-6.
With five of their six top play
ers from foreign countries, Miami
appeared to be more of an inter
national touring team than an
American collegiate team. Yet
this lineup did not really help the
Hurricanes at all, as their sole win
came from their only American
player, No. 4 Dean Cohen. He
defeated Robert Devens 7-6, 6-0.
With this confidence-building
win under their belts, the Cardi
nal men are now ready to head
into the National Team Indoor
Championships in Louisville,
Kent. With a No. 3 seed and a first
round bye, the Stanford men will
probably face Harvard Thursday
afternoon, if Harvard beats Duke.
