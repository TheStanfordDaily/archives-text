# Spikers overwhelm Trojans
## 
### Laurie Wackier Staff writer 
Dave Goss welcomed USC to
Burnham Pavillion with an intim
idating stuff block on the first vol
ley, then Canyon Ceman said the
good-byes, dumping the ball over
a frazzled Trojan squad to seal a
three-game victory on Saturday,
15-8, 15-13, 15-6.
The win marked consecutive
triumphs over USC, who suffered
a come-from-behind defeat at the
hands of No. 3 Stanford last
weekend. The Cardinal spikers
stretched their record to a perfect
6-0, while No. 7 USC dropped to
2-2 in Western Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association play.
Once again Goss took offensive
honors, turning in 34 kills on a
.481 hitting performance in front
of a packed house. In addition, the
junior outside hitter collected six
digs.
"Dave just got stronger as the

match went on," said head coach
Ruben Nieves. "As other players
faded, he picked up his game and
played with a lot of confidence."
Goss was named WIVA player of
the week for his NCAA record 55
kills against UCLA last Friday.
Although Goss' prowess at the
net was no shock to USC, Stan
ford did have some surprises in
store for the Trojans. Nieves
shuffled his starting lineup to
include sophomore Joe Burghardt
and senior Ryan Moos, who both
played key reserve roles against
USC last weekend.
"The team really picked up
play when they were both on the
court down south," said Nieves of
Moos and Burghardt. "This week
in practice, we felt they earned
the opportunity to start."
The duo took advantage of that
opportunity, turning in stellar
performances in their debut. The
change provided a catalyst for
Stanford's passing and hitting

games. Led by Moos, the Cardinal
turned in one of their best passing
performances of the season.
Meanwhile, Burghardt, enabled
the spikers to execute a quick-hit
ting game, keeping the Trojan
blockers off guard. "Joe gives us a
lift," Nieves explained. "When
you can set the quick hitter, the
other blocker has to pay more
attention to him."
As a result USC had a hard
time trying to figure out exactly
who to focus their attention on.
The Trojan defense cowered in
face of a Stanford attack that
combined the punishing forces of
Duncan Blackman and John Bez
malinovic, as well as Goss and
Burghardt.
Like Goss, Ceman also pol
ished his play as the match wore
on. "In the last game, Canyon
focused on giving hitters good
swings, as opposed to being
tricky," Nieves said. "He's doing a
really outstanding job."
