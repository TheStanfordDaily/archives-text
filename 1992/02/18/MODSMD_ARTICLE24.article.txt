## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
In conditions that Laxmi Poruri called a night
mare, the No. 5 Stanford women's tennis team
exorcised the demons of No. 8 California 7-2. The
match, which was punctuated by several rain
delays, started Sunday and ended Monday.
Heather Willens routed Lisa Albano 6-0, 6-1 at
No. 1 singles.
"I felt really good about how I was playing for
the first time in a long time. I was moving a lot bet
ter," Willens said. The match was the only one fin
ished Sunday.
Poruri was down 4-5 to Cara Abe when play
resumed Monday. The Cardinal sophomore pushed
the first set to a tiebreaker and built a 6-2 lead.
With Poruri at net on the next point, Abe rifled
a groundstroke down the line. Poruri softly
dropped the ball over the net. After clinching the
set on the delicate drop shot, Poruri cruised. She
took the second set 6-1, despite waiting through a
rain delay at match point.
The Bears tightened the match by winning No.
3 and No. 4 singles. Keirsten Alley beat Kylie John
son 6-4, 4-6, 6-1. Jennifer Poulos outlasted Emma

Woodhouse 4-6, 6-2, 6-3.
Amy Chiminello pulled out a 6-4, 6-3 victory
over Cal's Lisa Parks, and Mario Carruth assured
Stanford a lead going into doubles with a win
against Sarah Maynard. Carruth was down 4-5, set
point when play was postponed Sunday.
She came back Monday to take three straight
games and the set. "When you're stopping and
starting it's hard to stay focused," Carruth said.
"You can't play badly for a few games and get into
the match."
With a nearly full moon rising over the tennis
stadium, the Cardinal beat the Bears in all three
doubles matches. Kristine Kurth made her dual
match debut at No. 3 doubles with Chiminello.
The pair came back from a 0-4 disadvantage in
the first set to edge the Cal tandem of Parks and
Valerie Poulos 7-5, 7-6 (7-3).
Kurth was pleased with her performance after
being sidelined with a sore back since mid-January.
"I thought I played really well for not having played
in a while," she said. "I was a little wild at times but
I surprised myself."
Willens and Poruri romped over Albano and
Alley 6-2, 6-0. Johnson and Woodhouse beat May
nard and Jennifer Poulos 6-3, 6-3.
