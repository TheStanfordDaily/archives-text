# Democratic pick up in the air at first primary
## Profs: Republicans will choose Bush 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
As New Hampshire voters kick
off this year's presidential elec
tion, Stanford political scientists
say most of them will be going to
the polls with two "E" words —
electability and the economy —
guiding their decision.
Despite a flurry of recent polls
that show former Massachusetts
Sen. Paul Tsongas with a large
lead, today's New Hampshire pri
mary could go almost any way,
they said.
"New Hampshire voters are
very volatile," said Political Sci
ence Prof. David Brady, an expert
on elections. "There will be a lot
[that could] change their minds."
According to Brady, today's
primary is critical because a
strong performance will allow
candidates to raise more money.
He said that before character
accusations against Arkansas
Gov. Bill Clinton surfaced, he
thought Clinton "had the best
chance because he had the best
shot at winning white Southern
votes."
Clinton was accused in the
Star, a tabloid, of having a long
term affair with Gennifer Flowers
— a charge that was followed by
the revelation that he may have
evaded service in the Vietnam
War when he was a student in the
early 19705.
Now, Clinton and Tsongas will
have to prove that they are indeed
electable, the professors said.
"For the Democrats, the key issue
is finding someone who can beat
George Bush," said Political Sci
ence Prof. John Ferejohn.
A protest vote
Bush, meanwhile, is trying to
withstand a challenge from conser
vative columnist Patrick Buchanan.
"Buchanan is trying to stimu
late a protest vote against Presi

dent Bush," Political Science
Prof. Terry Moe said, noting that
Buchanan believes Bush is not
conservative enough and not a
good enough leader.
"A number of people may vote
against Bush just to show their
disappointment" in Bush's han
dling of domestic policy, Moe said.
"However, I would be surprised if
Buchanan did better than he is
doing now in the polls," Moe
added.
Election riding on economy
The professors agreed that
Bush will be the Republican
Party's nominee, but whether he
wins the November election
depends entirely on the economy,
they said.
"The key for the general elec
tion will be whether or not the
economy has turned around by
the fall," said Political Science
Prof. Doug Rivers. If the economy
has improved, Bush will be
reelected, he added.
"With a slight turnaround in
the economy, I think Bush is pret
ty clearly a winner," Brady said.
"The Democratic candidates
are all going to [criticize] Bush
on the basis of the economy,"
Ferejohn said. "The question
there is not who says they can do
a better job, but who can be
believed."
"The (Democrats] who are
more moderate and in the main
stream are more likely to get sup
port," Moe said. They will try to
fashion a program that business
es can support, he added.
Only a major world event could
shift voters' attention away from
the economy, said Political Sci
ence Prof. Richard Brody.
"Something could happen in
the Middle East that could turn
people's attention away from the
economy," he said. "But unless
that happens, the economy is the
central issue."

Arguing over health care
The political scientists dis
agreed, however, on how impor
tant health care will be.
"Both Republicans and Demo
crats agree it's enough of a prob
lem to dedicate time in their plat
forms to it," said Ferejohn,
adding that health care will be
especially important for the Demo
crats.
"To be without a plan is to
guarantee criticism from the
press," Rivers said.
But Brody said the issue of
health care is overrated. "The
bulk of the public is covered," he
said. "The groups who aren't cov
ered are a small sector of the vot
ing public."
Furthermore, he added, since
all of the candidates will propose
some form of health-care policy, it
will become something of a non
issue. Voters won't take the time
to examine the details of the par
ticular proposals and will make
their decision based on other
issues.
The economy will subsume the
issue of health care, Rivers said.
"The issue the candidates have
talked about most is health care,
but the emerging issue seems to
be the economy — how the
Democrats will deal with it differ
ently than the Rebublicans,"
Rivers said.
Because many of the candi
dates are relative newcomers to
national politics, character may
become a decisive and relatively
volatile issue. "Most people don't
know the candidates very well, so
character issues become very

important," Moe said.
"The main characteristic (of
character attacks) is beating on
the front-runner," Brady said.
Character questions could be a
major problem for Democratic
leaders Clinton, Tsongas and
Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey, he
added.
Foreign issues less important
Foreign affairs may play a
small role in this election, with
the collapse of the Soviet Union
and trade with Japan sidelined as
campaign issues, the professors
said.
"The Democrats don't speak
out about foreign affairs much
because that's an advantage the
president clearly has," Brady
said.
"Initially, I think a lot of peo
ple thought Bush would get a lot
of credit for the Soviet Union's
demise, but basically I don't think
that has happened," Moe said.
"On the flip side, it has made the
kind of foreign policy issue that
Republicans use obsolete."
"It's so hard to see what will
happen in the Soviet Union —
even over the next month," Fere
john said. Russia's relations with
the United States and the rest of
the world could be issues in the
general election, he said.
Brody observed, "The collapse
of the Cold War equals a boost in
the presidential standing. But it
wasn't enough to prevent the ero
sion of the economy on his stand
• _ »
ing.
"Japan may replace the Soviet
Union as open adversary," Fere
john said. "I think there will be a
lot of Japan-bashing — among
both Democrats and Bush. Japan
is sort of an open target."
Rivers said the issue of trade
with Japan will not be critical in
New Hampshire because "it
seems to play better in the Mid
west where smokestack indus
tries are hurt by Japanese compa
nies."

As New Hampshire voters kick

"It's so hard to see what will
happen in the Soviet Union —
even over the next month," Fere
john said. Russia's relations with
the United States and the rest of
the world could be issues in the
general election, he said.

"Japan may replace the Soviet
Union as open adversary," Fere
john said. "I think there will be a
lot of Japan-bashing — among
both Democrats and Bush. Japan
is sort of an open target."
Rivers said the issue of trade
with Japan will not be critical in
New Hampshire because "it
seems to play better in the Mid
west where smokestack indus
tries are hurt by Japanese compa
nies."

As New Hampshire voters kick
off this year's presidential elec
tion, Stanford political scientists
say most of them will be going to
the polls with two "E" words —
electability and the economy —
guiding their decision.
Despite a flurry of recent polls
that show former Massachusetts
Sen. Paul Tsongas with a large
lead, today's New Hampshire pri
mary could go almost any way,
they said.
"New Hampshire voters are
very volatile," said Political Sci
ence Prof. David Brady, an expert
on elections. "There will be a lot
[that could] change their minds."
According to Brady, today's
primary is critical because a
strong performance will allow
candidates to raise more money.
He said that before character
accusations against Arkansas
Gov. Bill Clinton surfaced, he
thought Clinton "had the best
chance because he had the best
shot at winning white Southern
votes."
Clinton was accused in the
Star, a tabloid, of having a long
term affair with Gennifer Flowers
— a charge that was followed by
the revelation that he may have
evaded service in the Vietnam
War when he was a student in the
early 19705.
Now, Clinton and Tsongas will
have to prove that they are indeed
electable, the professors said.
"For the Democrats, the key issue
is finding someone who can beat
George Bush," said Political Sci
ence Prof. John Ferejohn.
A protest vote
Bush, meanwhile, is trying to
withstand a challenge from conser
vative columnist Patrick Buchanan.
"Buchanan is trying to stimu
late a protest vote against Presi

dent Bush," Political Science
Prof. Terry Moe said, noting that
Buchanan believes Bush is not
conservative enough and not a
good enough leader.
"A number of people may vote
against Bush just to show their
disappointment" in Bush's han
dling of domestic policy, Moe said.
"However, I would be surprised if
Buchanan did better than he is
doing now in the polls," Moe
added.
Election riding on economy
The professors agreed that
Bush will be the Republican
Party's nominee, but whether he
wins the November election
depends entirely on the economy,
they said.
"The key for the general elec
tion will be whether or not the
economy has turned around by
the fall," said Political Science
Prof. Doug Rivers. If the economy
has improved, Bush will be
reelected, he added.
"With a slight turnaround in
the economy, I think Bush is pret
ty clearly a winner," Brady said.
"The Democratic candidates
are all going to [criticize] Bush
on the basis of the economy,"
Ferejohn said. "The question
there is not who says they can do
a better job, but who can be
believed."
"The (Democrats] who are
more moderate and in the main
stream are more likely to get sup
port," Moe said. They will try to
fashion a program that business
es can support, he added.
Only a major world event could
shift voters' attention away from
the economy, said Political Sci
ence Prof. Richard Brody.
"Something could happen in
the Middle East that could turn
people's attention away from the
economy," he said. "But unless
that happens, the economy is the
central issue."

Arguing over health care
The political scientists dis
agreed, however, on how impor
tant health care will be.
"Both Republicans and Demo
crats agree it's enough of a prob
lem to dedicate time in their plat
forms to it," said Ferejohn,
adding that health care will be
especially important for the Demo
crats.
"To be without a plan is to
guarantee criticism from the
press," Rivers said.
But Brody said the issue of
health care is overrated. "The
bulk of the public is covered," he
said. "The groups who aren't cov
ered are a small sector of the vot
ing public."
Furthermore, he added, since
all of the candidates will propose
some form of health-care policy, it
will become something of a non
issue. Voters won't take the time
to examine the details of the par
ticular proposals and will make
their decision based on other
issues.
The economy will subsume the
issue of health care, Rivers said.
"The issue the candidates have
talked about most is health care,
but the emerging issue seems to
be the economy — how the
Democrats will deal with it differ
ently than the Rebublicans,"
Rivers said.
Because many of the candi
dates are relative newcomers to
national politics, character may
become a decisive and relatively
volatile issue. "Most people don't
know the candidates very well, so
character issues become very

important," Moe said.
"The main characteristic (of
character attacks) is beating on
the front-runner," Brady said.
Character questions could be a
major problem for Democratic
leaders Clinton, Tsongas and
Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey, he
added.
Foreign issues less important
Foreign affairs may play a
small role in this election, with
the collapse of the Soviet Union
and trade with Japan sidelined as
campaign issues, the professors
said.
"The Democrats don't speak
out about foreign affairs much
because that's an advantage the
president clearly has," Brady
said.
"Initially, I think a lot of peo
ple thought Bush would get a lot
of credit for the Soviet Union's
demise, but basically I don't think
that has happened," Moe said.
"On the flip side, it has made the
kind of foreign policy issue that
Republicans use obsolete."
"It's so hard to see what will
happen in the Soviet Union —
even over the next month," Fere
