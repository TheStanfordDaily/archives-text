# Who can follow Biddle?
## Navy says local official likely to fill in for now 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The Office of Naval Research has not yet
begun a search for Paul Biddle's replace
ment and will not name a new on-campus
Navy regulator for "some period of time,"
according to agency spokesman Norm Han
son.
For the time being, the Navy will likely
assign someone from another nearby
school it regulates "because that makes the
most sense," Hanson said.
Biddle announced his resignation
Thursday — effective at the end of the
month — to run for Congress.
The two most likely candidates for the
interim position are Lyndon Clausen, now
overseeing reimbursement at UC-Berkeley,
and Carlena Leufroy at Caltech, Hanson
said.
"Either one of them would do the job on

a temporary basis while continuing to work
at their current position," Hanson said.
"They would travel to Stanford as needed."
Neither Clausen nor Leufroy were avail
able for comment over the weekend.
A team of Navy-appointed auditors is
already investigating indirect cost charges
at Stanford and will continue to handle
much of the work, Hanson said. He added
that the duties included in Biddle's regula
tory position are "kind of already covered"
by the team.
The permanent position will be filled
after a "nationwide job competition that
will be open to any qualified people," Han
son said.
The University has declined to comment
on any successor to Biddle.
Larry Horton, associate vice president
for public affairs, said the University is
"willing to work with anybody who does not
have a conflict of interest."
