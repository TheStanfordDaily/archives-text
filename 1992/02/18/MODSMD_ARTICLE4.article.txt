# Retirement complex proposed for 72-acre site near Hospital
## 
### John Ford 
Stanford proposed new housing last
week, but it won't bring any relief to
unguaranteed students unless they want
to live among hundreds of retirees.
In conjunction with a local develop
ment group, the University unveiled
plans last week to construct 375 to 400
condominiums on the 20-acre plot cur
rently occupied by the old Children's
Hospital. The project must be approved
by the Palo Alto City Council before con
struction begins.
The land will be leased to Sand Hill
Partners, which will build and manage

the complex. Prices for the condominums
will be in the $250,000- $500,000 range.
Stanford officials also plan to build
700 to 750 apartments on an adjacent 52-
acre site. Although these units will be
by Stanford and not Sand Hill
Partners, the University considers the
two retirement complexes one project,
according to Andy Doty, director of com
munity relations.
Rent for the apartment units should
range from $900 to $1600 per month,
Doty said. People who have an associa
tion with the University will receive first
priority in apartment assignment.
Stanford professors — who see the

complex as a chance to remain in a
vibrant university setting even after
retirement — showed significant interest
in the project, according to Doty.
The old hospital on the site has been
slated for demolition because the Lucile
Salter Packard Children's Hospital,
which opened last April, is closer to the
Medical Center.
Doty said there is "no question" that the
potential for revenue played a role in the
decision to build the residential complex.
The plans were first proposed by the
Age Center Alliance, a Menlo Park-based
group. The University considered the pro
posal and then tried to determine if there

was interest in the project, Doty said.
Sociology Prof. Sanford Dornbusch,
one of the advisers to the project, said the
complex will allow residents to "live
happy and active lives" by providing a
wide range of services not available at the
typical retirement community.
Campus events such as concerts, plays
and night classes would benefit the elder
ly, he said.
Doty said construction on the sites
won't begin for two to three years —
the time it will take for the city council
to officially approve the project.
Palo Alto officials will begin the
lengthy approval process in the next few

months. They will consider the project's
design and environmental impact.
Although the council has occasionally
opposed further development of Stanford
land, it has also urged Stanford to con
struct more housing to relieve the local
housing shortage.
To comply with Palo Alto regulations,
the structures cannot be taller than 50
feet. Doty said the 16-acre archaeological
preserve along the San Francisquito
creek would not be harmed.
The apartment complex will be gov
erned by a board of directors — half of
whom will be from the Age Center
Alliance and half from the University.
