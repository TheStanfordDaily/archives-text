# Annual college tour opens doors
## Alum 'sniffs out' bright students, encourages them to apply 
### Chris Eisenberg Staff writer 
Alan Marks, a 1973 Stanford
graduate, has made a trek back to
his alma mater every year for the
last 10 years, but not to see his
former teachers.
Marks comes back to see his for
mer students — and to try to con
vince his current students to stay.
Since the spring of 1983,
Marks has led dozens of under
privileged minority students to
Stanford and other schools in an
effort to encourage them to apply
to — and attend — some of the
nation's best universities.
Marks, who teaches English at
Rio Grande High School in Albu
querque, New Mexico, also attend
ed the Graduate School of Business
during the 1987-1988 school year,
in what he called an attempt to see
how his efforts were paying off.
"I had seven students here at the
time," Marks said. "I came back to
see how the kids were doing. If they
weren't doing well, I didn't want to
keep sending them out here."
Marks, however, was pleased

with what he found. "They had
friends, they tried hard and they
were making it." In fact, "they
were doing a lot better than I did"
as an undergraduate, Marks said.
Marks started teaching English
at Rio Grande in the fall of 1978.
But he soon found himself in an
added, unpaid role — an informal
college counselor.
From the beginning, he thought
he saw a disturbing trend. Few, if
any, graduating seniors went to
college out of state.
"Nobody ever went away,"
Marks said. "Everybody from my
school (who went to college) went
to the state university. Period."
Although the school is "85 per
cent minority and about 99 percent
poor," Marks believed from the start
that his students could gain admis
sion to more prestigious schools. His
initial efforts at tiying to encourage
students to apply out of state, how
ever, were unsuccessful.
"Several of us kept trying to get
students to apply, yet we weren't
having any success," Marks said.
"We finally decided the best idea
[was] to actually get them into the

environment."
So, over spring break in 1983,
Marks led six juniors on a tour of
Stanford, UC-Berkeley, Pomona
and UCLA. In many ways, the
trip worked.
"From that class, that was the
first time people went away — two
people went to Stanford, two peo
ple went to Princeton, two people
went to Duke. That started things.
It got the ball rolling," Marks said.
Realizing he was on to some
thing, Marks has continued to
lead tours of East and West Coast
schools every year since, with the
exception of his 1987-1988 stint
at Stanford.
Students pay for their trips by
raising money and working.
Marks said one girl whose family
"didn't have a penny" raised the
money for the trip by going to
"every (charitable organization]
in town."
Marks said he knows the value
of finding the talented students
early. According to Marks, while
900 students typically start ninth


Chris Eisenberg — Daily
Alan Marks, a high school English teacher in New Mexico who graduated from Stanford in 1973, made
his annual campus visit last week — bringing several of his current students with him. For the past
decade, Marks has encouraged dozens of underprivileged teenagers to apply to Stanford and other
prestigious colleges.
grade at Rio Grande, only about
300 may eventually graduate — a
dropout rate well over 60 per
cent. As a result, Marks is always
on the lookout for bright stu
dents.
"If they're in my school, I sniff
them out from day one," he said.
Once he finds them, he encour
ages them to take a rigorous
schedule of his test preparation
and study skills courses, as well as
to take part in his annual college
tours.
Marks confessed that he
works his students pretty much
"any time I can get them." Many
of his classes are held before and
after school, as well as during
lunch.
Despite his exhaustive efforts,
Marks gets no additional salary
for his hundreds of hours of extra
work. Yet while his school district
does not support him financially,
Marks says his fellow teachers are
supportive.
"The other faculty members
think it's really cool. They're
pleased the kids get the chance,"
Marks said. "And now that the
school has gotten some notoriety
from it, they like to brag about
what's happening, that their kids
are going on trips and getting into

colleges."
Over the course of the last 10
years, 11 veterans of Marks' tours
have gone on to attend Stanford.
Junior Katarina Sandoval says
she wouldn't be here if it weren't
for Marks.
"I'd always heard of these
schools but I thought even if I
could get in that I could never
afford it," Sandoval said. "Going
on these trips you see Chicanos,
Hispanics, and you say, 'Well
heck, if they're here, I want to be
here.' "
Sandoval, who was a junior at
neighboring West Mesa High
School when she went on Marks'
10-day East Coast trip, credits
him for making her aware of her
options.
"He made me realize that it's
possible to go to schools like
[Stanford]," she said.
Thursday night, Marks brought
yet another group of Albu
querque high school students to
Stanford on the first leg of a West
Coast college tour that included
UC-Berkeley, Occidental and
Pomona.
Brenda Arellano, a junior at
Rio Grande, said she was
impressed with everything Stan
ford had to offer. For her, howev
er, a central question remained:
"Do I want to leave home?"
If he had to bet, Marks would
probably say the answer will be
yes.
