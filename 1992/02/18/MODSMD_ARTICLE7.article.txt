Yale grad students strike
NEW HAVEN, Conn. — Graduate students at Yale University
began a three-day strike yesterday, and about 1,400 union
employees honored picket lines.
Most dining halls were closed and most classes taught by grad
uate students were canceled. Professors who didn't want to cross
picket lines moved their classes off campus to such locations as a
movie house and a church.
The Graduate Employee and Student Organization, represent
ing about 1,300 graduate students, struck to pressure the admin
istration to negotiate.
Among other changes, the group seeks a formal grievance pro
cedure for students, higher salaries for teaching assistants and
longer time limits for completing doctoral requirements.
The administration refused to recognize the group as a union
but has been trying to reach an informal agreement with students
on some of their concerns.
"Many of the policies the university has are degrading to grad
uate students," said Gary Russo, a seventh-year graduate student
in neurobiology. "I'm 30 years old. I'm married. Yet they treat me
like I'm a child."
Yale President Benno 0. Schmidt said it was unfortunate
employees were being asked by union leaders to sacrifice three
days' pay for "a cause that really has nothing to do with unions."
'Ice' leads Raspberry nominations
LOS ANGELES — Vanilla Ice's "Cool As Ice" scooped up
seven Golden Raspberry Awards nominations yesterday and Sean
Young got two bids for playing twins badly as Hollywood prepared
to saute the worst of 1991.
Bruce Willis' "Hudson Hawk" and Dan Aykroyd's "Nothing
But Trouble" both picked up six nominations for the Oscar-spoof
ing Razzie trophy, a golf ball-sized gold-painted raspberry with an
estimated street value of $1.79.
The Razzie nominations come just two days before Wednes
day's announcement of the Academy Award contenders.
The 12th Annual Golden Raspberry Awards, determined by more
than 350 voters from 26 states and five countries, will be meted out
March 29 at a "Press Conference Cum Performance Piece," the
Golden Raspberry Award Foundation said in a statement.
Getting the biggest raspberry reception for 1991 was "Cool As
Ice," nominated for worst picture, worst actor (Ice), worst director
(David Kellogg), worst screenplay (David Stenn), two worst new
star nominations (including one for Ice) and worst original song.
Other worst picture nominees were "Dice Rules," "Hudson
Hawk," "Nothing But Trouble," and "Return to the Blue
Lagoon."
