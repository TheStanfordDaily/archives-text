## Tuition hike needed 
### 
Academic quality must
come first, but financial
aid increase imperative

Despite widespread dis
content over next year's
tuition increase, the price hike
is preferable to sacrificing academic
quality by deep cuts in programs cru
cial to Stanford's rank as one of the
country's finest universities.
As hard as it is to accept hikes that
increase the financial burden stu
dents face already, there will be no
easy solutions to the budget crisis.
But to make the rising costs
more acceptable, the administra
tion must be willing to insure that
financial aid also increases to pro
tect students whose families fall
into the middle income bracket.
These students have a special
problem in that their families make
too much to qualify for grants and
not quite enough to pay for the cost
of a Stanford education.
Last week, the administration
announced a tuition increase of 9.5
percent for next year to help make
up for the budget shortfall. This
equals a 7.5 percent hike in the price
of attending Stanford when tuition
is combined with the smaller
increases in room and board costs.
Although University President
Donald Kennedy has said he
believes there is room for the
increase — presently, the Universi
ty charges the 36th highest tuition
nationally — it is important to
keep in mind that Stanford assigns
more loans and work-study, rather
than grants and scholarships, in
financial aid packages than many
of the more expensive schools.
Students for whom cost is a fac
tor will always go to the state
schools over Stanford if they do
not receive a sizable financial aid
package. Stanford's tuition will
never be competitive with that of
public schools, so the University
must maintain its edge in educa
tion and reputation.

Although the tuition increase is
necessary, the University handled
the decision poorly.
One major error made in the
decision-making process was not
leaving room for student input.
Although there are student repre
sentatives on various budget com
mittees, there was no advance
warning of the magnitude of the
hike until it was approved by the
Board of Trustees early last week
While students should have
done more to take advantage of
opportunities to participate in
town meetings, news of a "sub
stantial" increase does far less to
spark student interest than solid
numbers. If those numbers had
been available before the decision
was final, there would have been a
stronger student response.
Also, there is still no clear expla
nation of how exactly the money
will be spent after all of the other
budget cuts. More specific num
bers should be made available to
justify the decision.
Tuition hikes are a last resort,
to be used only for the specific pur
pose of maintaining academic
quality. The administration cannot
become dependent on the students
to bail out the University.
Students should be vigilant in
ensuring that administrative
costs, bureaucratic inefficiencies
and other forms of University fat
are eliminated at the same time
tuition is increasing. It needs to be
very clear that students will not
make financial sacrifices to sup
port a bloated administration.
Next, wasteful programs should
still be trimmed or eliminated. There
is also room for some scaling back of
student services as long as quality of
life is not adversely affected.
In a choice between a tuition
increase and a major decline in
Stanford's ability to remain a lead
ing educational institution, the
price hike is the less painful option.
At the same time, Stanford's pro
grams should continue to undergo
scrutiny to ensure the University
achieves its goal of academic com
petitiveness.
