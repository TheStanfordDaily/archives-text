"The end of the world will begin this Saturday night!' That's what the powers that be have just told
their agents on Earth.One is an angel, the proprietor of a used book store. The other is a demon
(and the proud owner of a Bentley). Neither is happy about the news, so they team up to stop the
impending catastrophe. And when an angel and demon join forces, nothing is sacred!
"If you saw the humor in The Omen.,M you taped all the Monty Python
comedies and if you regularly re-read Douglas Adams's -
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, then
Good Omens has arrived just in time"
