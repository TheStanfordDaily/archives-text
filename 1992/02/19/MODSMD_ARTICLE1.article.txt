# 558 Mayfield will be self-op
## Residents' proposal accepted 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
558 Mayfield House will become a self-op begin
ning next year, now that a proposal drafted by cur
rent residents has been approved by the Office of
Residential Education.
Residents of the house were angered earlier this
year when they learned that Food Service, in a move
to cut costs, would no longer provide a cook for the
house. As a self-op, the house will hire its own cook
and residents will take on hashing duties.
"The students came together after difficulties
faced early fall quarter and basically drew up an excel
lent proposal (to convert the house to a self-op)," said
Janice Prothro, assistant director of the Row.
Currently, the house operates as one of six Uni
versity-operated Row houses, with cleaning, cooking
and hashing services provided by the University.
As a self-op, 558 Mayfield will continue to receive
University cleaning services, but will handle its own
cooking and hashing.
When Food Service first dropped Row house
cooks, the houses' meals were replaced by food pre
pared at Wilbur Hall and shipped in by truck.
Later, after many complaints, Food Service
agreed to provide a pail-time cook who was required
to use raw materials supplied by the University.
Nevertheless, many students were still dissatisfied
with the quality of meals.
"The students feel they lost unity as a result of
the food service change," Prothro said. "So, some
students with experience in the Toyon Eating clubs
took control."
Board bills at the self-op should be between $100
and $200 lower than those under the current sys
tem, residents predicted. However, because the Uni
versity is responsible for maintaining the kitchen
facilities in self-ops, room rates at the house will be
higher to offset maintenance costs.
When the self-op was first proposed, some Food
Service administrators had expressed concern about
the loss of revenue that would result if the house
became a self-op.
But Shirley Everett, associate director of Univer
sity Food Service said her office "supports the deci
sion." She added that Food Service "never makes
money operating in any of the Row houses."
Prothro predicted that the house may be more
popular as a self-op in this year's Draw. "I definitely
cannot see any negatives to the change," she said.
"Row residents want autonomy."
The character of the house may change as a
result of its switch to a self-op, Prothro said. "From
my experience, houses that are
self-operated are more united
(than University-operated hous
es)," Prothro said. "People rely
on each other and work togeth-
TVâ€” "
er.
Junior Caroline Dehnert, one
of the authors of the proposal to
convert 558 Mayfield into a self
op, also hinted at some changes in
the house's character.
"We're thinking of calling it 'The
Cuckoo's Nest' or 'The Overfed
Long-Haired Leaping Gnome
Dome,' which is a lyric from a song
by the group called War," she said.
"But we might have to get approval
from the<opyright holders."
The self-op will have seven
house officer positions next year:
two kitchen managers, two finan
cial managers, a house manager, a
weekend/clean-up supervisor and
a social director.
These positions will be filled by
current residents, Dehnert said.
The house will also have one
resident assistant.
