University's reputation
diminished unfairly by
Biddle's publicity stunts

wild claims were greedily devoured
by the national media, and some
probably bought into his public-ser
vice image.
But in his somewhat ruthless
mission to expose abuses, Biddle
has failed to recognize or under
stand the mission of the university.
He has propped himself up as a
defender of the common man while
ignoring the vital contributions
that Stanford and other universi
ties make towards the public good.
The destitution of higher educa
tion may be the unfortunate result
of his crusade.
By casting doubt on the credibil
ity of this institution, Biddle has
effectively diminished the integri
ty and importance of higher educa
tion in the eyes of many Ameri
cans. He has created and exploited
a feeling of "Us vs. Them" to incur
the wrath of a nation plagued by
recession and more than willing to
scapegoat indiscriminately.
This is a dangerous legacy, one
that would be established and per
petuated by the potential legislator.
While the federal government
should no doubt probe the misap
propriation of research dollars,
leaders should not encourage this
perception of the university as
haven for elite intellectuals and
white-collar criminals.
The American education system
needs every dollar it can get, and
the rash reduction of funds to
prove a point will deliver more than
a slap on the wrist to universities
already struggling to meet costs.
If research dollars have been
misappropriated, then by all
means, let's redirect them back to
where they belong. But a drastic
reduction of funds, such as that
sustained by Stanford, serve no
one's purpose — except perhaps the
whistle-blower who stands to gain
from the publicity.
If Biddle's past actions are indica
tive of his designs for the future, the
American public — and particularly
the Stanford community — should
approach his campaign with a
healthy dose of skepticism and no
small amount of alarm.

After three years of
Paul Biddle's embarrassing
revelations and aggravating
exaggerations of abuses here, Stan
ford will be more than happy to
show him the door.
Biddle, the rough-and-tumble
campus-based Navy regulator, has
been largely responsible for expos
ing the admittedly questionable
billing practices between Stanford
and the federal government. And
the announcement last week of his
resignation must have administra
tors breathing a sigh of relief.
However, the simultaneous disclo
sure of his intention to run for
Congress — representing Stanford —
should elicit more than a nervous tit
ter within the academic community.
Few would contest the value of
whistle-blowers in the U.S. govern
ment, and a politician dedicated to
exposing abuses in the system
would undoubtedly be more than
welcome in the eyes of many
Americans.
But Biddle's campaign to expose
abuses at Stanford was not a tire
less pursuit of justice and honesty,
as he would have the American
public believe. Rather, Biddle rec
ognized and seized the opportunity
to elevate himself by dragging
Stanford down.
His flair for the dramatic and
propensity for the outrageous
demonstrated Biddle's transpar
ent desire to portray himself as
larger-than-life. And his filing of a
qui tam suit — to receive up to 30
percent of the money the federal
government recovers from Stan
ford — seriously undermined his
credibility and indicated a desire
for personal gain.
Nevertheless, Biddle has emerged
from this scandal a prominent cru
sader and high-profile watchdog.
His unsubstantiated and sometimes
