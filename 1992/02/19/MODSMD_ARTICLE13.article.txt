## So much for stealing second 
### 
Telling one's own personal
story is often the most powerful
way to make a point, or, more
importantly, to make people think. When
grandiose statements entrenched in
politically correct terminology are made,
many may listen but few will hear.
When I hesitated in writing this col
umn, I realized I was basking in hypocrisy.
So instead I chose to write and risk.
New Year's Eve 1984 I will never for
get. I was 15. As the ball dropped, I
leaned over to hug a friend and she met
me instead with an overwhelming kiss.
As we fumbled upon the bed, I remem
ber debating my next "move" as if it were
a chess game. With the "Top Gun" slogan
ringing in my head, I slowly reached for
her breast. After having my hand pushed
away once, I reached my "mark."
Our groping ended soon and while no
"relationship" ensued, a friendship did.
You see, the next week in school she told
me that she was drunk that night and
didn't really know what she was doing.
While she liked me a lot, she said she
just wanted to be friends. I have gotten
used to those five words, but that's
another column.
Ever since puberty, I remember
receiving messages that sex was a game, a
competition. Sexual relations were best
achieved through luck, guile, strategy or
coercion. Another friend in high school
counseled me on the importance of drink

ing: "With liquor you'll get to bed quick
er," she said. Thinking about her state
ment back then, I realized its veracity.
Coming to college, I was immersed in
the same sort of attitudes.
"What do you think happened? She
invited me back to her room at 3 a.m."
"I've got to find a way to snatch that
snatch."
"The best thing for that girl would be
to be tied down and screwed."
Out of context these statements seem
shocking, but in context they were barely
noticed.
After two years at Stanford, I snapped
from one extreme to the other. Once,
during my sophomore year, in response
to a slew of my verbiage, a friend of mine
chidingly called me a man-hater.
In retrospect, my soliloquy titled "The
Oppressive Nature Of Male Dominated
Society And Its Violent Manifestations:
Rape, Anorexia, Battered Wives" may
have been a surreptitious attempt to con
vince her that I was a sensitive man, but
more likely I was trying to convince
myself that my attitudes had changed.
My polar leap had little to do with resi
dential education. It had to do with a del
uge of reality. You see, I had begun listen
ing to the raw truth from men and women
discussing rape about two years ago as a
peer counselor. The conversations were
personal accounts, not rhetoric; they were
real life, not dorm programing. It was a

wake-up call â€” I will never be the same.
I find myself with no conclusion for
this column. A conclusion would speak of
a simplicity I do not feel. I can find little
clarity in the torment of emotions I now
experience when even allusions to this
issue are made. All I have are poignant
visions.
I see that preceding all the horrors of
rape are a host of skewed attitudes.
I see my friends seeking to "get some"
or to "score."
I see people making power plays.
I see myself at 15 trotting around the
bases and stealing second.
I now see the crowds, no, not the spec
tators, but the thousands, the millions
who are rarely seen or heard.
I've seen enough.
I spoke to a 40 year old woman who
has trouble looking at her self in the mir
ror when she gets out of the shower; to
her, her body is always dirty. She can't
make love, she never had an orgasm, she
never will forget what happened her first
time. She can't close her eyes.

Cory values the dialogue he has received
in response to his column and welcomes
more.
