I HAVE THE MOST TROUBLE keep
ing the names straight for the Asian
women. I wonder why this happens.
It's easy to create the illusion you know
all the names by occasionally demon
strating that you know some of them.
During October, Brian often thought
about his buddies from high school who
hadn't made it to Stanford because of
"affirmative discrimination."
Now, in January, as Vernon talks
about his low grades, that old sense of
ir\justice wells up in Brian again. Feeling
guilty about having feelings like these
about someone he thinks of as a friend,
he pushes them away, unexamined.
Amy is telling me how African-Ameri
can students and black students from
Africa are uncomfortable with each other.
I find myself cheering inwardly for the

Africans and against the African-Ameri
cans. What's this "for"and "against?"
At lunch, students of color are sitting
together at one of the rectangular side
tables. As Andy moves in their direction,
he suddenly realizes, or imagines, he
isn't wanted. The look on his face shows
confusion and resentment.
As I enter the lounge, I discover one
of our custodians watching the dorm
television, with his feet kicked up on the
furniture. Angry words pop into my
head: "Doesn't he know his place?"
Where does stuff like this come from?
The figure is approaching. I want to
see her face. I'm interested. I need to see
what the face is like. Let me see the face.
It's as if I don't know how to relate to a
woman until I make a judgement about
how attractive she is.

Of all the liberals in the group, Katie
is the only one who can say that two of
her closest friends are black. When she
is invited to a step show, in subtle ways
she makes sure everyone knows.
In the cafeteria, Steve is heading straight
for his usual corner. Now, mid-year, it
would be absolutely unthinkable, rude
even, for him to sit at most other tables.
At the start of the year, it was entire
ly different; he was willing to sit down
with anyone. We all realize the dorm has
changed, but no one will speak openly
about this.
And I think about Teresa, who pro
nounces each student's name respectful
ly. The way she honors names reminds
me of my fourth grade teacher. When
calling role in the morning, she pro
nounced our full names one by one,

affirming each of us as individuals.
In this way, she invited us to renew
our interest in one another and to treat
one another well. In the democracy of
her affection, every student received full
and equal opportunity.
The unusual event — the "incident"
that makes the news — serves only to
blind me if I fail to notice and to ques
tion the thousand smaller, but more
real, incidents that are woven deeply
into the fabric of my daily life.
The next stage of pluralism will
depend not on further clarification of
our rights but rather on further investi
gation into ourselves.
