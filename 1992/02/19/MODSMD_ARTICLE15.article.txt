Battle of family friend
makes AIDS a reality
I found out yesterday that my broth
er's friend is dying of AIDS-related can
cer. I have known, abstractly, of quite a
few who have had the disease and then
passed away. But I have not had anyone
so young, with a clear image in my head
of how he used to be, die of the disease.
At least, not until now.
At such fortunate institutions as
Stanford, we are bombarded with infor
mation on how to prevent AIDS and
sources to contact with questions and
concerns. The education is there. The
disease is not genetic. It is preventable.
And that is precisely what makes the
disease seem so conquerable, yet victory
is still out of our grasp.
I have heard people tell me exactly
the same story as I am telling now.

But the idea is incomprehensibly dif
ferent when it happens to someone you
know.
I don't mean your friend or a
neighbor. I mean seeing your brother
come home from watching his best
friend's body deteriorate, his expres
sion as though he were looking in a
mirror. I mean realizing that you, too,
could soon be looking into that mir
ror.
I propose no thesis and I draw no con
clusions. I just now know what it feels
like to have someone close to home die
from the disease.
I look through my high school year
book and wonder where my tears are.
They will come, as I hope they do many
more times in the future, in memory of
one of the millions of people who will be
sacrificed for the sole benefit of educat
ing the rest of us.

Student input needed
on issue of tuition hike
We as students have been robbed by
this University — robbed of our voice,
our rights and our money. The Board of
Trustees passed a 9.5 percent tuition
increase, saying that it is good for stu
dents.
The University did not take any
steps to actively involve students in
the overall decision-making of this
budget-reduction process. "Student
tokenism" on budget committees is not
enough; open forums where adminis
trators avoid questions are not
enough.
If the open forums are not well
attended by students, it is not because
we are apathetic or don't care about
what happens to this University. It's
because we know no one is listening.

In order to effect change, we need
voices at every level of the decision-mak
ing process, including a student on the
Board of Trustees. We also need infor
mation.
By withholding information, the Uni
versity creates ignorance and tries to
placate the student body. The process
has disenfranchised us all.
We have rights as students, as con
sumers and as citizens. This University
has completely and intentionally denied
those rights by excluding us from the
decision-making process.
It's time that the people who run
this University understand that we are
not just "a bunch of kids" making
noise. We are a group of educated con
sumers and future alumni, unwilling to
let the University control every aspect
of our lives.
