## CBS: An Olympic yawn 
### 
I thought there would be some sports
involved.
An Olympic viewer
Anybody notice how CBS' great
Olympic human interest stories keep
getting interrupted by annoying sport
shorts? I'm getting engrossed in the piece
about the Chinese speed skater who
couldn't compete in the last games because
her country gave her steroids by accident,
and the network ruins the mood by showing

her actually competing in a race in these
games that is old enough for my friends to
inform me that Bonnie Blair won anyway.
The woman did wind up getting the silver,
but the fact was that I hadn't gotten enough
of the sensitive human touch. I wanted
more than just the drugs. I wanted the
spurned lover who comes back to melt her
practice ice in revenge. I wanted the sex
scandal with Pat Buchanan and the baby
she had by Elvis' ghost. I wanted all the
sappy, personal goo I could possibly get.
Didn't everybody??
Frankly, no. Whether CBS considers
Americans mentally challenged is a debat
able issue, but the network's dosage of Tim
McCarver coupled with its weak line-up of
real competition has many people wonder
ing: Did they think we would actually forget
the thing was a sporting event?
"It is like a gigantic Super Bowl pre
view," said Jeremy X (last name withheld),
Stanford couch potato and TV viewing
expert. "They showed the Olympics from 12
p.m. to 1 a.m. (Monday) and they didn't
show a single event in its entirety. I find it
amazing that they spent something like
$200 million for the thing and 75% of it is
not sporting events."

Let's not be so harsh — we can't forget
all that great time spent with the CBS staff.
Every joke is a classic (huh?), and McCarv
er's sly smile and smooth style is like one big
"I'm so cute" transworld wink that makes
people just want to ... . hurl.
"We see too much high-priced CBS talent
bantering back and forth and they are not
that good," said Mr. X. "Though I do love
the outfits; it's 'bout time they brought
back the turtleneck-classic look."
But not classic coverage. All joking aside
for just a minute, these Olympics frustrate
to no end. We wait all day to actually see
Bonnie Blair skate (though she won hours
earlier) and have to endure personality piece
after personality piece only to get about forty
seconds of competition coverage before being
launched into the "we're-so-glad-she-won"
family video montage that takes us all the
way back to Illinois. America is jointly
thrilled at the victory and agonized at the
defeat of good television journalism.
"It's USA Today style coverage taken one
step further," said Jeremy's roommate, Gil
Y. '"Forget Bonnie Blair, let's talk about
her mom — it's brief sound bites of knowl
edge intermixed with highlights and
recaps."
Well, the Olympic coverage may be trite,
but at least it's commercial. Even when
CBS is treating an event with some sem
blance of respect, they still cheat the audi
ence with an over-abundance of commer
cials. Nothing new you say? Well maybe,
but it gets annoying when you are trying to
watch a hockey game and they go to a com
mercial at almost every play stoppage. Such
was the case during the important USA-
Sweden game a few nights back. "All you
missed was another icing," they would say
upon return. But in a game as quick as
hockey, that icing could just as easily have
been a goal. The fact that they would risk
missing even a couple seconds of a game
that tight was a little mind-boggling. Yet at
least for once they tried to be comprehen
sive about something.
"There is just so much that could be
shown," mused Jeremy in defeat. "But at
least they are getting the ratings, so I guess
it doesn't matter."
Sad, but true. We sit, we watch and we
take it because we have no other choice. I
can't wait for '94.
