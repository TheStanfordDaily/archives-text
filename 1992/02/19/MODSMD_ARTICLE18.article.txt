Men's golf: Stanford travels to Hawaii
to compete in the John F. Burns Invita
tional in Kanahoe over the next three
days. The tournament is the first of the
1992 season for the Cardinal.
Men's swimming: The Cardinal swam
against California Saturday in a non
scoring meet designed to give those
swimmers competing in the Olympic Tri
als one more tune-up before the big event
to be held in Indianapolis on March 1-6.
Amazing Olympic hopefuls such as for
mer Olympic gold-medalists Pablo
Morales and Matt Biondi, as well as world
record holder Jeff Rouse were featured in

the casual, but high caliber, competition.
This meet was the last stop for the 16
Cardinal swimmers who have a shot at
making the U.S. Olympic team based on
their performance in Indianapolis. "For a
lot of the guys, their minds are two weeks
down the road, but the veterans like Jeff
Rouse, Pablo Morales, and Derek Weath
erford took it as an important meet," said
coach Skip Kenney. "Some didn't . . .
that's an ability they'll have to grow into.
"This was a real treat for the crowd.
Several of these young men will be on the
Olympic team. Some will be no surprise,
but others will say, 'How did he get
there? I saw him swim two weeks ago.'"
