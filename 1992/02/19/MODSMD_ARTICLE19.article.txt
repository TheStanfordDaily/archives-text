# Cocotos reveals new serve, style
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
This year, when Chris Cocotos
steps onto the court, he is unlike any
Chris Cocotos that the national tennis
circuit has previously seen. Loaded
with a new arsenal of deadly strokes
and a resilient mental toughness,
Cocotos is determined to make his
mark on the world of college tennis.
One year ago, however, Cocotos was
a frustrated and unhappy freshman,
floundering under the pressure of
being the nation's No. 1 tennis recruit.
After playing under the same coach in
West Palm Beach, Florida since he was
10, moving 3,000 miles away to com
pete on the court and in the classroom
with some of the best athletes and stu
dents in America was quite a challenge.
Suddenly, new coaches were alter
ing the strokes which had carried him
to the top of the junior circuit. At the
same time, he faced unfamiliar, high
pressure challenge matches which
would determine whether or not he
would even make the team.
"I was working on my game but I still
expected to be in the top six," he said.
With shaky new strokes and incredibly
tough competition, Cocotos lost his chal
lenge matches and sat in the team's
eighth spot for most of the season, play
ing occasional doubles matches.
"I really lost my confidence because
I had never had to sit out a whole
year," Cocotos recalled. "It was easy to

pawn [my performance] off on my
strokes but you can't do that forever,
and I wanted to make the lineup."
So, he dug in and started working.
"We made his serve more forceful, less
kick," coach Dick Gould said. "It's
tough to change your game, though,
when you don't have much confidence
anyway. And here's a new coach muck
ing up his game."
Cocotos, however, takes full respon
sibility. "Now that [last year's] over,
I'm glad it happened. It made me real
ize that I was the only one on the court
... it was all in my hands.
"Although it looks on the outside
like such a building year for my
strokes, I think it was a better mental
than physical building year. I learned
more about myself than I ever have
before. Sitting out makes you realize
how much you really love to play."
And uuop he love to play. Spending
the summf at satellite tournaments
in the Midwest, he played as many
matches as he could to build up his
match toughness. "Other guys on the
team got to work on strategy in match
es (during the season) but I just prac
ticed my strokes, I never combined the
two," Cocotos said.
Being able to practice his strokes
with the nation's top players had its
benefits. "I think the thing that helped
my game the most last year was being
able to practice with guys that were
turning pro this year. I got to learn
from them," he said.

His current teammates have also
provided tough competition over the
years. "I played Michael (Flanagan)
and Vimal (Patel) in national Under
-12 tournaments. It's good to finally be
on their side," he chuckled.
Being part of a renowned tennis
program and playing with the nation's
finest helps Cocotos relax. "I'm so anx
ious sometimes that I try too hard," he
said. "I need to relax more, and these
guys are just what I need because
they're just so laid back."
Aside from relaxing, Cocotos needs
to improve his strategy on court if his
game is going to reach a new plateau.
"Chris has a beautiful game, he's fun
to watch," Gould said. "He has a lot of
feel and touch but sometimes he's
clueless on the court."
To remedy this Cocotos has been
working on two-shot combinations.
"Rather than reacting, he needs to
take charge," Gould explained.
"Thinking in two-shot combinations
will help him sustain his concentra
tion. It makes you play with purpose."
As his game improves, so does his
confidence. Playing third singles and
first doubles, he has tallied an impres
sive 4-1 record this season. "I'm pretty
confident right now, but I can't imag
ine where my confidence will be after
25 matches," Cocotos said.
Coach Gould agrees: "When he gets
his confidence back his game will go
up. By the end of the year you'll see a
tremendous tennis player."
