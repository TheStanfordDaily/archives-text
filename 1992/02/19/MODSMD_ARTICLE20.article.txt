### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
The records just keep falling.
On Friday night, the Stanford Cardinal
women's gymnastics team pummeled the
UC-Santa Barbara Gauchos by nearly four
points and continued its world-beating ways,
setting three new team marks and tying one
individual record.
Stanford's overall total of 190.30 points
(UCSB mustered only 186.75) bettered its
previous high of 189.75, which the team had
earned last month against Arizona. Included
in the Cardinal's overall total were school
record-shattering performances on the
uneven bars, where the team's five highest
scores added up to 47.80 (0.15 better than
the old mark) and on the balance beam,
where three 9.65 sand two 9.60s summed up
to a whopping 48.15, a remarkable 0.60
improvement on the previous standard.
"The team did a great job. We had some
real heroes tonight," said head coach Breck
Greenwood.

Among the heroes for the Cardinal was
freshman phenom Jene Elzie, who won the
individual all-around competition with a
38.50 and took first place in the bars compe
tition with a school record 9.70 score. Elzie
also took the title in the floor exercise with a
9.70. Sophomore Kerri Kanuka won the
vault competition with a 9.65 and placed sec
ond in the all-around with a 38.40.
