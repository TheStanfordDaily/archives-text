Natural disasters continued to devastate
UCLA and California last weekend, this time
coming in the form of the Stanford men's
gymnastics team. The Cardinal whipped
UCLA and Cal in a tourament at Berkeley,
posting one of the highest team scores in the
nation this season.
The Stanford squad began its stellar
weekend by hosting UC-Santa Barbara on
Friday. Despite holding back against its
weaker opponent, Stanford won by a whop
ping six points as UCSB spent much of the

meet doing face plants into the mattresses.
The action switched to Berkeley on Satur
day in a tournament that featured UCLA,
Washington and UCSB. Hamada had previ
ously vowed that Stanford would post some
high team numbers at the meet.
As it turned out, the Cardinal surpassed
their coach's expectations and earned a score
of 283.55 points. That score not only beat
second-place UCLA by eight points, but
ranks as one of the nation's highest team
scores of the season.
Jair Lynch led the Cardinal to victory
with an all-around mark of 58.2 points,
including two near-perfect scores of 9.9 in
the pommel horse and parallel bars. Co-cap
tain Tim Ryan also had a good meet,
excelling in the floor exercise and the rings.
Although two of UCLA's top gymnasts
were injured, Stanford's margin of victory —
equivalent to three touchdowns in football
— showed it should dominate the Pacific-10
Conference.
"Everything is going according to plan,
but we have lots of room for improvement,"
Hamada said. "Rings and vaulting are still
weak."
