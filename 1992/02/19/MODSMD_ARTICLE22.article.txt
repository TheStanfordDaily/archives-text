# Card nine slip in rain
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
They found a way. With a sure
win in hand, the Stanford base
ball team snatched defeat from
the jaws of victory yesterday at
Sunken Diamond, losing to the
San Jose State Spartans 7-6.
Going into the top of the ninth,
the Cardinal was leading the
Spartans by a healthy three run
margin. Stanford pitching had
held the Spartans at bay, with
starter Tim Moore going the first
five and two-thirds innings â€”
which went well except for an
errant third where Moore gave up
three runs, including a mon
strous home run by Spartan
Kraig Constantino.
But the Cardinal also produced
runs. A Mark Skeels stand-up
double scored two runs in the
third, and Chris Kemper went 3-
for-4 on the day, helping the Car
dinal to score runs in the increas
ingly familiar blue-collar manner
of this season. By the end of the
eighth, Stanford had stubbornly

manufactured six runs.
Yet it turned out to be not
enough, even for the Cardinal's
usually stingy pitching staff.
Going into the final inning with a
three run lead, senior reliever
Aaron Dorlarque was on the
mound, where he had been for
two and a third effective innings.
But in the top of the ninth, things
began to look ugly.
A walk. An infield hit. A strike
out. Another walk. Suddenly, the
bases were loaded chock full of
Spartans, and at the plate was
Constantino. Dorlarque was defi
nitely showing signs of tiring, as
evidenced by his unusually long
stint and his two walks in the
inning. However, coach Mark
Marquess inexplicably didn't go
to fresh arms in the bullpen. And
the Cardinal paid.
Constantino blasted a hanging
Dorlarque curveball over the left
centerfield fence for a grand slam
homer. The Cardinal was not able
to muster anything in the bottom
of the inning, and so lost for only
the fourth time this season.
