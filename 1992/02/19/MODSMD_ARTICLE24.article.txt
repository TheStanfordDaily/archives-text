# Wrestlers to face powerful Bulldogs tonight
## 
### Brian Egan Editorial staff 
The Stanford wrestling team
travels to Fresno tonight to take
on nationally-ranked Fresno
State at 7:30 p.m. The match fig
ures to be one of the Cardinal's
most challenging dual meets this
season.
"I'd definitely say that it will
be one of our toughest," said
Stanford coach Chris Horpel.
"We've already faced (nationally
ranked) Oregon State, and Fres
no beat OSU in a dual match."

Every one of the Bulldogs' 10
starters has a legitimate shot at
qualifying for next month's
NCAA Tournament.
Horpel stressed that he was
not looking to come away from
Fresno with a team victory; Stan
ford has no 177-pound or heavy
weight wrestler, and has forfeited
these two divisions in almost
every meet this season.
"When you go into a match
down 12-0, you begin with a huge
disadvantage," said the coach. "I
look at this as a way to gauge how
we'll do in the [Pacific 10 Confer

ence Championships]."
From an individual stand
point, the Cardinal is having an
exceptional year. Led by senior
co-captains Mark Graham (14-4-
0 record) and Matt Topham (15-
6-0), the squad is in great posi
tion for post-season competition.
"Five or six of our wrestlers have
a legitimate shot at qualifying for
the NCAA's," said Horpel. "We
must beat some wrestlers of
[Fresno's] caliber to produce
qualifiers."
Other Cardinal grapplers hav
ing solid seasons include 142-

pound junior Lance Johnson (11-
4-0) and Jay Jackson, a 136-
pound sophomore (15-7-0).
Tonight's match is particular
ly important for Topham. Stan
ford's sole returning NCAA par
ticipant, Topham will drop from
wrestling in his usual 167 or 177-
pound class to the 158-pound
division, where he hopes to com
pete in the postseason. "His natu
ral body weight is around 175,
but he can make the adjust
ment," said Horpel. "Topham's
very disciplined."
