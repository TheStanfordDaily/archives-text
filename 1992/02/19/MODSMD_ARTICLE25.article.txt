## Bug explains why Flo Mo's trees tilt 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
. Why are the trees between
Vy •Florence Moore Hall's
fieul and 558 May field tilted at
such a crazy angle? Is there a
gravitational vortex in the area
or something ?
— Confused
A. The sage I confronted with
• our query, Paul Green, is
extremely learned In the lore of
plant morphology — the study
of why and how earthly vegeta
tion looks the way it does.
I asked the sage why a tree
would fail to grow up straight. A
dominating mother, perhaps?
Beer foam runoff from innumer
able repeats of the Alpha
Epsilon Phi's "First Lei of the
Year" party?
No, he assured me, it was
none of these.
After a contemplative pause,
the sage proceeded to list a few
possible sources of arboreal tilt.
Shading was the first potential
cause that came to mind. Anyone
who has tried to maintain vegeta
tion in a dorm room will know
that an ostensibly unimaginative
plant can bend itself through out
rageous angles as its creeps
around Macs and desk lamps to
find a place in the sun.
We soon discarded this possi
bility, however, as there are no
buildings in the area substantial
enough to block sunlight during
the brighter parts of the day.
After another pause, he
described to me a phenomenon
known to the wise as a "drunk
en forest."
Drunken forests exist where
it is so cold that the soil is frozen
most of the time. Such "per
mafrost" is found in the frigid
tundra of Siberia.
During the warmest parts of
the summer, the top Layer of
permafrost undergoes a tempo
rary thaw. This results in a rela
tively fluid layer of soil sitting on
top of a frozen, immobile layer
— not unlike a throw rug sitting
on a hardwood floor.
When the "rug" of melted soil
slips, the trees growing in the
soil slip with it; when the soil

refreezes, the trees are trapped
into growing at an angle for the
next year. The result: a whole
bunch of trees that lean and
stagger like members of the
Stanford Band. Hence, the name
"drunken forest."
You sharp pre-meds out there
are probably thinking, "But wait
. . . there's no permafrost at
Stanford." And you know what?
You 're right.
Needless to say, the total
absence of permafrost in the
area was not lost on the sage.
Stumped (ha!) for the moment,
he volunteered to take a look at
the trees himself.
The sage had two sugges
tions. Either the trees were tilt
ed in their original root balls,
and they have grown crooked
since their earliest life, or they
were tilted by a windstorm when
the upper layer of the soil was
saturated by rainwater and their
connection to Mother Earth was
more tenuous than usual.
This second possible mecha
nism is not unlike the slipping
layers phenomenon that pro
duces the drunken forests of far
off Siberia.
"These trees are not particu
larly good at recovering from
tilt," he explained. Once a tree
begins to lean, gravity will rein
force the irregularity by pulling
the tree in the same direction.

for the trees have no tongues!
