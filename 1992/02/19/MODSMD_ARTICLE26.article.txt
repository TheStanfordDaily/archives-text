# Bio class teases death — with tweezers
## Undergraduates dissect cadavers and learn about life in Surgery 101 
### Elisa Nino-Murcia 
The pieces of cloth covering the
faces of the six cadavers in
Surgery 101 make it easier to for
get that these bodies, turned vari
ous shades of brown and yellow,
were once as full of life and
curiosity as the students slowly
and carefully teasing them apart.
Listed in the Winter Quarter
Schedule as Surgery 101: A
Regional Study of Human Struc
ture, this course gives undergrad
uates the rare opportunity, usual
ly reserved for medical students,
to work on dissecting entire
cadavers.
"At first sight of the silhou
ettes of the black bags you realize
that this is life, or exactly the
opposite," said Pei-Ran Ho, a
senior majoring in biology, as he
reflected on the first day of class.
"It's incredible. This class is like
taking a class in the beauty of
nature or God. It teaches you
that, dead or alive, the body is
beautiful."
The class' first hour is in the
typical lecture format. But in the
laboratory section that follows,
that teacher-student relationship
changes completely.
The classes' two surgery pro
fessors, Dr. John Dolph and Dr.
Eric Glasgow, mingle with the
students, adding their input and
explaining in more detail when
the dissection protocol does not
say enough.
In last Wednesday's class, the
professors had to help their stu
dents more than usual because of
the particular difficulties of dis
secting the intricate lining of the
anterior abdominal wall, the scro
tum, the spermatic cord and the
testes.
After the students completed
the dissection, Glasgow, always
trying to point out the practical
applications of the study of anato
my, showed the students exactly
how testicular cancer devastates
the life of a male. Students
cringed as he told them that tes
ticular cancer occurs most com
monly among men in their early
twenties.
On top of 12 hours of class
time per week, plus multiple
hours of outside studying, the
students are issued their own
keys to the laboratory and can
often be found late at night work

ing on their cadaver.
But the students do not seem
to mind all the long hours.
"You know it's hard. But if you
love [this class], it means you can
stomach it, and you can make it
through medical school," Ho said.
However, for someone inter
ested in taking just a basic anato
my course for fun, junior Jon
Kern said he would recommend
"a lighter class."
The worst reaction to the
cadavers Glasgow could recall was
a student who was too nervous
and reluctant to cut and tease
apart her cadaver because of the
idea that she would be dissecting
something that was once was
alive.
"However, she realized that
since the cadavers are donated,
she was doing what the person
wanted them to do," said Glasgow.
"For a class like this to func
tion well, it requires one instruc
tor for every three cadavers, or
twelve students," Dolph said. The
24 students are divided into
groups of four, each working on
one of the six cadavers.
Stanford undergraduates are

fortunate to have the opportunity
to do such dissection before medi
cal school, according to Dolph and
Glasgow, because other universi
ties do not have the same access
to cadavers or the same student
teacher ratio, if they offer a
human anatomy course at all.
"Other schools do not offer
such a class to undergraduates
because there is a lack of faculty
interested in teaching to under
graduates," Dolph said.
At UC-Berkeley, anatomy
classes number 500 and students
have to learn from "cadavers that
have already been dissected,"
Glasgow said. "I know many med
ical schools who have ten stu
dents dissecting each cadaver .. .
and have the students just sit
around and then go home and
write up what they saw. We don't
have that sort of nonsense."
The bodies are donated to
Stanford through a Medical Cen
ter donor program that is primar
ily for people who have been diag
nosed with a terminal illness.
The anatomy class requires that
the bodies "have not suffered any
traumatic injuries," Dolph said.

Within 24 hours of death, the
bodies are delivered to Stanford
and embalmed. They are then
stored for a year while the chemi
cals take full effect. After the
course, the dissected bodies are
cremated and the ashes kept at a
local cemetery.
The course is offered through
the Medical School as a two-quar
ter sequence, with no prerequi
sites. The second part, which con
centrates on the head and neck, is
optional.
Most students said they
learned about the class through
word-of-mouth. Only the first 24
to sign up make it to the first day
of class.
Ho said he found out about the
course "from a friend." And he is
glad he did. The class is "amaz
ing," he said.
"It's one of the best classes
that I've taken here," agreed
Roger Chen, a senior majoring in
biology.
According to Kern, a human
biology major, "[GlasgowJ's a
friend to us all. He adds a light of
humor to it all. Dolph knows this
stuff down pat."
