# Computerized atlas changes to reflect new borders, and sings too

Germany reunified, the Soviet Union disin
tegrated and now the map of the world that
has served you well, at least for a few months,
is hopelessly out of date.
And with Yugoslavia at the verge of col
lapse, 1992 does not seem to be a good year to
purchase a new one.
But geography lovers need not despair.
Mac Globe for the Macintosh and PC Globe for
the IBM, computerized atlases with yearly
updates, could be the answer to the annoying
problem of map obsolescence.
However, with borders changing at such a
rapid pace, even Mac Globe's maps are out-of
date, and the current version of the software
may be just as inaccurate as your standard
wall map. While Mac Globe does account for a
unified Germany, it considers the USSR a
country and labels St. Petersburg
"Leningrad."
PC Globe, Inc. promises that the first
update, available this summer, will account for
geographical name and border changes in the
old Soviet Union and treat the republics as sep
arate countries. More updates will be issued

every 12 to 18 months.
In addition to maps, Mac Globe provides
access to statistical data, comparison charts
and flags. You can even listen to the slow, plod
ding melody of "Motherland," the national
anthem of Mauritius, along with the anthems
of the other 190 countries featured.
The facts and figures provided by Mac Globe
are interesting and enlightening. But the soft
ware is lax about including the years statistics
were gathered and does not list the specific
sources each set of figures is drawn from.
For example, Mac Globe shows that the
United States has twice as many dentists as
any country: 158,000. Japan, with the second
highest dentist total, has only 66,797.
This information is presented in a compari
son bar graph, but the reference information
— source and year — is buried with the indi
vidual country's statistics.
Still, Mac Globe enables you to do many
things traditional printed almanacs cannot,
such as deciding which regions and countries
should be colored and highlighted. The soft
ware also affords many ways to view compara
tive information graphically, via maps and
charts.
The comparisons cover standard categories

such as population density and growth and
gross national product.
Some of the comparisons put our own
domestic concerns, such as crowded class
rooms, in perspective. In Chad, there are 77
high school students per teacher.
Along with standard comparisons, Mac-
Globe also includes some lighter comparisons,
such as beer production.
The software also includes information
helpful to the travel planner, such as interna
tional phone codes, time zones, current gov
ernment leaders, political parties, tourism
information and rain and temperature figures
Much of the travel information is general to
the point of being vague, however. Tourist
sights for Italy are simply a list of cities: Rome,
the Vatican, Florence, Venice.
Most of the statistics are drawn from the
1989 edition of the CIA World Fact Book, the
Encyclopedia Britannica World Data Annual
from 1990 and the 1990 World Population
Data Sheet, published by the Population Ref
erence Bureau.
Mac Globe requires a Mac Plus or later model,
at least one MbRAM, a hard disk and a Macin
tosh System 6.04 or later. The program retails
for $79.95, and updates are offered for $25.

like the one above. Along with demographics, the software provides
