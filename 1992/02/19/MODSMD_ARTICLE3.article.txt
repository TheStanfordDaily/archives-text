# Geriatrics research could get big boost

Stanford may soon be a leader in the field of
geriatrics, with the help of more than 1,000
willing research subjects.
University researchers say they are excited
about the opportunity to study the elderly
population that will occupy up to 400 condo
miniums and 750 apartments in a proposed
$160 million retirement complex on West
Campus.
Sociology Prof. Sanford Dornbusch said
both the School of Medicine and the School of
Humanities and Sciences "see an opportunity
for Stanford to research and provide service to
the elderly" at the complex, which was pro
posed last week by University officials, in con
junction with a local development group.
The project, planned for a 72-acre plot of

land currently occupied in part by the old
Children's Hospital, must be approved by the
Palo Alto City Council before construction
begins.
Dornbusch said the complex would provide
an opportunity for "all kinds of studies â€”
opinion surveys, discussions, everything
under the sun."
To aid with ongoing research, the resi
dences may even have a central database con
taining detailed information on the physical,
social and emotional states of the residents,
according to Dornbusch.
Medical School professors involved in geri
atrics also see the planned community as a fer
tile area for research. Neurology Prof. Robert
Cutler said the potential research is "very
important to the Medical School." The Stan
ford Hospital currently has no active geri

atrics program.
The elderly residents could be involved in
anything from "graded exercise programs" to
research on innovative strategies for coping
with Alzheimer's Disease, Cutler said.
The residents will have the choice of
whether to participate in any particular pro
gram, but the research activities should be a
great benefit for them, said Asst. Psychology
Prof. Laura Carstensen.
Endocrinology, Gerontology and
Metabolism Prof. Robert Marcus said the res
idences would encourage a "very major pro
gram on gerontology," which could include
studies on diabetes, high blood pressure,
arthritis and nutrition.
