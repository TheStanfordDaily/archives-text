Attorneys representing Stanford and its on-cam
pus power facility, Cardinal Cogen, met briefly in
Santa Clara Superior Court yesterday as a two-year
old, $69 million lawsuit against the University con
tinues to inch its way toward trial.
According to Senior University Counsel Jasper
Williams, both sides agreed during the morning con
ference to continue taking depositions and postpone
consideration of a trial date until the two sides
reconvene in court May 19.
The lawsuit, filed in December 1990, focuses on
the amount of money Cardinal Cogen charges Stan
ford for its electricity. Cardinal Cogen believes it has
the right to charge Stanford a higher rate than the
University thinks it has to pay.

Additionally, Cardinal Cogen wants the Universi
ty to pay so-called "demand charges" that Stanford
does not believe it is contractually obligated to pay.
Cardinal Cogen also claims Stanford should pay
the costs of connecting its facility to the Pacific Gas
and Electric power system as well as $18 million for
seismic reinforcements made to the facility during
its construction.
While both Stanford and Cardinal Cogen agree
that more preparation time is needed before a trial
date can be set, the two disagree on how quickly the
case should move to trial.
Michael Baker, an attorney with the San Francis
co law firm Jackson, Tufts, Cole and Black and one
of two attorneys representing the power facility, said
Cardinal Cogen will be ready for a June trial.
Williams said the case will not be ready for trial in
June, but will happen "sometime this year."
