# Rabois, Matthies to kick off radio show Will appear tonight on KZSU
## 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
First-year law student Keith
Rabois and Otero Resident Fellow
Dennis Matthies will be the first
guests on a radio talk show debut
ing tonight on KZSU.
The hour-long program, called
"Talk Back," was organized by
Greg Ricks, who coordinates mul
ticultural education for the Office
of Residential Education, and
sophomore Wendy Lack. It will be
broadcast Wednesdays at 7 p.m.
Ricks said that by inviting
Rabois and Matthies — and
allowing callers to ask each of
them questions — he hopes to
encourage "dialogue" on campus.
"We're hoping it will be an
opportunity for students to talk
about these issues without the fear
of being shouted down," Ricks said.
Lack, the program's director
and producer, said another
motive for inviting Rabois and
Matthies was to attract attention
to the new program.
"We're going to be deliberately
controversial," Lack said, adding
that she hopes the program will
tackle "community issues" that

have been the subject of recent
debate.
Rabois was the student who
made anti-gay remarks directed
at Matthies' residence Jan. 19.
The incident was subsequently
publicized by University officials,
and Rabois became the target of
widespread community condem
nation.
"Stanford has the ability to
come down hard on individuals,"
Ricks said, adding that while he
may not agree with the "method
ology" of Rabois' behavior, "he
has a right to have his point of
view."
The program's format will not
match Rabois and Matthies
directly against each other.
Instead, each will speak separate
ly for a half-hour.
Ricks said he plans to ask each
guest questions for about 15 min
utes, then will open the phone
lines and allow people to call in
with their questions.
"It's an opportunity to hear
from students about what they're
thinking and feeling," Ricks said,
adding that he is hoping for a "very
straight, no-nonsense" response.
"We want people to talk back
to us," he said "Everybody's col
lective experience is valid — not
necessarily agreed with, but
valid."
Lack emphasized that radio is
"anonymous," which may encour
age students to talk freely about
issues that have troubled them.
"It's very hard for people to be

wrong here," Lack said. "People
are so sensitive. Hopefully [stu
dents] will be more comfortable
speaking on the radio."
Matthies said yesterday that it
"may not be a good idea" to have
both of them on the same pro
gram because they will talk about
very different topics.
"Keith is interested in the
First Amendment issues, I think,
while I'm interested in other
issues," he said.
Matthies said he plans to
encourage a "more complex anal
ysis" of Rabois' behavior and to

advocate changing the focus of
multicultural education from
"political issues" to "personal and
spiritual" considerations.
Rabois said yesterday that he
had "no particular reason" for
agreeing to appear on the new pro
gram.
"This girl (Lack) just called me
and asked if I would do it, and it
was a convenient time, so I said
yes," Rabois said.
He added that he is not worried
that callers may be extremely crit
ical of his actions. "There's noth
ing to be nervous about," he said.
