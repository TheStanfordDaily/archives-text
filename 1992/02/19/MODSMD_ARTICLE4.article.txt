### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
First-year law student Keith
Rabois and Otero Resident Fellow
Dennis Matthies will be the first
guests on a radio talk show debut
ing tonight on KZSU.
The hour-long program, called
"Talk Back," was organized by
Greg Ricks, who coordinates mul
ticultural education for the Office
of Residential Education, and
sophomore Wendy Lack. It will be
broadcast Wednesdays at 7 p.m.
Ricks said that by inviting
Rabois and Matthies — and
allowing callers to ask each of
them questions — he hopes to
encourage "dialogue" on campus.
"We're hoping it will be an
opportunity for students to talk
about these issues without the fear
of being shouted down," Ricks said.
Lack, the program's director

motive for inviting Rabois and
Matthies was to attract attention
to the new program.
"We're going to be deliberately
controversial," Lack said, adding
that she hopes the program will
tackle "community issues" that

have been the subject of recent
debate.

made anti-gay remarks directed
at Matthies' residence Jan. 19.
The incident was subsequently
publicized by University officials,
and Rabois became the target of
widespread community condem

"Stanford has the ability to
come down hard on individuals,"
Ricks said, adding that while he
may not agree with the "method

has a right to have his point of
view."
The program's format will not
match Rabois and Matthies
directly against each other.
Instead, each will speak separate

Ricks said he plans to ask each
guest questions for about 15 min
utes, then will open the phone
lines and allow people to call in
with their questions.
"It's an opportunity to hear
from students about what they're
thinking and feeling," Ricks said,
adding that he is hoping for a "very
