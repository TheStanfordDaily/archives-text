### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
The five-member board of direc
tors of the Association of Chinese
Students and Scholars at Stanford
resigned Monday following com
plaints that the board had blocked
the mtyority of its members from
protesting the actions of the Chi
nese government.
Resolutions binding the board
to seek and implement the will of
the majority were passed at the
meeting, while a proposal describ
ing the organization as non-politi
cal was overwhelmingly rejected,
students and board members said.
Members of the board resigned
after the resolutions were passed.
"Most of us in the board are
not political," said physics gradu
ate student Donghao Zhang, who
resigned as the board's vice presi
dent Monday. "I think the gener
al atmosphere is a little bit politi
cal leaning," he added.
About 160 people attended the
meeting Monday.
The controversy began when
the Independent Federation of
Chinese Students and Scholars,
the national Chinese student
group, "initiated an open letter. ..

to protest (Chinese Premier) Li
Peng's visit to New York," said
fifth-year graduate student
Yongchuan Liu.
According to fourth-year grad
uate student Zhang Hong, the
board "at first refused to do this
. . . because they [thought it was]
too political." The board stated
this position two hours before
the signing deadline imposed by
the national group, Hong said.
Second-year graduate student
Changhong Dai, who resigned as
president of the group's board
Monday, said: "The impression we
got from the election last Novem
ber ... (was that) students would
not like to act on political" issues.
But students conducted a poll
earlier this month using electronic
mail, and a majority of respondents
expressed support for signing the
letter. Students also argued that the
protest was "not a political issue, it
is a moral issue," Hong said.
In an e-mail response, board
members said they were not obli
gated to follow the majority's
opinion on political issues because
their campaigns had not made
any political statements.
