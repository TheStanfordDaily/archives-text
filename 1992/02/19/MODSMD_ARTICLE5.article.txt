## 160 Chinese students meet to shape their group's politics, governance 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
The five-member board of direc
tors of the Association of Chinese
Students and Scholars at Stanford
resigned Monday following com
plaints that the board had blocked
the mtyority of its members from
protesting the actions of the Chi
nese government.
Resolutions binding the board
to seek and implement the will of
the majority were passed at the
meeting, while a proposal describ
ing the organization as non-politi
cal was overwhelmingly rejected,
students and board members said.
Members of the board resigned
after the resolutions were passed.
"Most of us in the board are
not political," said physics gradu
ate student Donghao Zhang, who
resigned as the board's vice presi
dent Monday. "I think the gener
al atmosphere is a little bit politi
cal leaning," he added.
About 160 people attended the
meeting Monday.
The controversy began when
the Independent Federation of
Chinese Students and Scholars,
the national Chinese student
group, "initiated an open letter. ..

to protest (Chinese Premier) Li
Peng's visit to New York," said
fifth-year graduate student
Yongchuan Liu.
According to fourth-year grad
uate student Zhang Hong, the
board "at first refused to do this
. . . because they [thought it was]
too political." The board stated
this position two hours before
the signing deadline imposed by
the national group, Hong said.
Second-year graduate student
Changhong Dai, who resigned as
president of the group's board
Monday, said: "The impression we
got from the election last Novem
ber ... (was that) students would
not like to act on political" issues.
But students conducted a poll
earlier this month using electronic
mail, and a majority of respondents
expressed support for signing the
letter. Students also argued that the
protest was "not a political issue, it
is a moral issue," Hong said.
In an e-mail response, board
members said they were not obli
gated to follow the majority's
opinion on political issues because
their campaigns had not made
any political statements.
Zhang said yesterday that he
later apologized to members of the
group for the wording of the
response. He said it was "oversaid"
and that it was "more of an artistic
expression than anything else."
But according to Liu, "the
board members, and especially
the president, have a different
understanding about the deci
sion-making process of this orga
nization."
Dai said one of the reasons he
opposed acting politically is that
students may be at risk for speak
ing out.
"If we do a lot of politically
related stuff, they get more risk,"
Dai said.
But Xiaorong Li, a fourth-year
graduate student, rejected this
analysis, saying that past experi
ence argued against such concerns.
"In the past, people have done
more serious things" and have
gone back to China without being
discriminated against, she said.
Li said that "if you sign as an

organization, no individual will be
picked out."
A proposal was passed at the
meeting Monday requiring that
"each individual member of the
board should go to the front and
[express] his or her [position on
majority rule]," Hong said. Board
members who did not feel bound
to follow the desires of the major
ity of the members would be
expected to resign.
The purpose of the resolution
was to "allow every individual
board member to speak up," since
students were not sure whether
all the board members held the
same position, Hong said.
When the resolution was
passed, "the president represent
ed all of" the members, said
Hong, adding that she was "puz
zled" by his reluctance to let each
member speak.
Dai told the members that "we
can hardly do more than we
promised," and that the entire
board decided to resign in order to
comply with the will of the majority.
Several students said they
thought the entire board resigned
at once in an effort to discredit
the rest of the group.
