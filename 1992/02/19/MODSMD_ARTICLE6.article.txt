# Getting his business suits dirty
## Bon Appetit director's style earns him employees' loyalty 
### Sara Skinner Staff writer 
Things wouldn't be the same around Tresidder
Union without Richard Calbow, who has become
famous at Bon Appetit for his hands-on managing style,
round-the-clock dedication and concern for students.
His time is not spent in a secluded office. Instead,
Calbow — who manages the Corner Pocket and
other Tresidder concessions — spends his day out on
the floor, supervising and filling in anywhere help is
needed.
Calbow, the director of retail for Bon Appetit,
doesn't talk much about himself, but the people who
work for him are more than willing to do so.
"Just when I was leaving tonight he was putting
the garbage cans back," laughs Krista Fairbairn, a
student manager who has worked for Calbow for
three years.
"He comes back to work at the grill and gets his
business suits all dirty," adds Rachana Tyagi, a junior
who has been working for Calbow since April.
Bon Appetit General Manager Mary Clark sums up
Calbow's management philosophy: "He would never
ask anyone to do anything he wouldn't do." This atti

tude, she says, "changes the whole work ethic. I come
down and Dick's in the middle of it all the time."
Calbow says his day begins at 6:30 a.m. and lasts
until about 6:30 p.m. Clark disagrees. "He leaves the
majority of the time at seven or eight," she says.
"And then he's back on Saturday."
"The man does not go home," Fairbairn says.
When Calbow began his job in 1989, very few stu
dents worked in Tresidder's food services, and he
was told Stanford students wouldn't want to work in
"unglamorous food service positions."
Calbow says the key is how management per
ceives students. He considers students valuable and
has made an effort to hire them.
In fact, he does not merely hire students, Clark
says, but places them in positions of responsibility
such as the cash room, or doing research for new
products. Calbow says he hopes to provide them
with "private business experience" on the job.
He started out with only eight or 10 student
workers. Today, he says, half of the "out-front
labor" are students, he has numerous student man
agers and the Corner Pocket is alipost completely

student-run.
Rven though students are an
important part of his work force,
Calbow is conscious that their pri
ority is not work.
"He's really accommodating to
the fact that we're students first,
and work comes second," Fair

bairn says."He doesn't have to
hire in the University but he likes
the students. They help the atmo
sphere of the place."
Calbow makes an effort to get to
know his workers as well. "He's
interested in the classes they take,
the sports that they're in," Fair
bairn says.
Ana Rincon, a full-time employ
ee, describes how Calbow calls sick
employees to see how they're feel
ing, takes them out to celebrate

birthdays and tries to help when
problems arise.
"He's always joking around,"
says Krista Gasink, who has
worked at Bon Appetit for a year
and a half.
Overall, Calbow makes the
grade with employees and manage
ment alike. "He's a cool boss,"
Gasink says.
Fairbairn agrees. "I wouldn't
want to work anywhere else," she
says.
