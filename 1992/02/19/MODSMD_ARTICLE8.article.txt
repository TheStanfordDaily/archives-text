Buchanan stuns Bush with strong showing
MANCHESTER, N.H. — President Bush gained grudging vic
tory Tuesday night in the New Hampshire presidential primary,
with challenger Patrick J. Buchanan claiming more than 40 per
cent of the Republican vote to fuel his conservative rebellion.
New Hampshire's blighted economy was the consuming issue
in both parties' campaigns, but even so Buchanan's strength was
a surprise that jolted the White House.
While other candidates celebrated in New Hampshire, Bush
accepted his victory, with 57 percent of the vote, in a written
White House statement: "This election was far closer than many
had predicted. I think the opponents on both sides reaped the har
vest of discontent with the pace of New Hampshire's economy."
