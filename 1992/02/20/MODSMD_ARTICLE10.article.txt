# Campus mixed on nickname issue
## Oregonian won't print Native American team names 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
The Oregonian last week
became the first major U.S. news
paper to stop printing Native
American-related team nicknames
— a policy change that drew
mixed reaction from community
members at Stanford, which in
1972 changed its nickname from
"Indians" to "the Cardinal."
"It's very humane," said
Angelique Jackson, co-chair of the
Native American Issues League.
"I wish that more people involved
with the media would take an
honorable stand like that."
The newspaper opted to use
descriptions like "National League
champion Atlanta" or "the Wash
ington football team" rather than
"Atlanta Braves" and"Washing
ton Redskins."
The use of Native American
nicknames for sports teams has
been controversial for several
decades, but has spurred renewed
debate this year after Atlanta's
appearance in the World Series and

Washington's Super Bowl victory.
"In 1992 it's very relevant how
Native Americans are portrayed in
the media and how [the issue] is
brought more into the conscious
ness," said Jackson, a member of the
Sisseton-Wahpeton Dakota tribe.
But Jim Bettinger, deputy
director of the John S. Knight
journalism fellowships, said The
Oregonian may invite "complica
tions" by acting as an "arbiter" of
correctness.
"I like the sentiment behind
it," Bettinger said. But "deciding
not to use the name of an organi
zation because it doesn't meet
with your political agenda is dan
gerous," he added.
He said The Oregonian made a
"gutsy" decision by opening itself
up to "challenges from people
who might not agree."
Bettinger said he does not
believe The Oregonian's decision
will have a significant effect on the
style used by other newspapers.
Some students expressed irri
tation at the newspaper's deci
sion. "They're taking offense at

things that were never meant to
be offensive," said freshman Matt
Hungerford.
He said the use of the name
"Redskins" does not lower his
opinion of Native Americans and
added that it is "just a part of
American culture."
Freshman Dan Gilley said The
Oregonian is not confronting the
real issue. "They're just playing
around with words," he said.
However, many students
expressed support for The Orego
nian's decision.
Senior Dana Tilson, said many
current portrayals of Native
Americans are inaccurate and
harmful.
She said The Oregonian's new
policy forces people to realize that
"every little thing" makes a dif
ference.
"A lot of times people say it's
no big deal," said Tiffany Lee, a
first-year graduate student and
member of various Native Ameri
can student organizations on
campus. "But there's a lot of
power behind the words."
