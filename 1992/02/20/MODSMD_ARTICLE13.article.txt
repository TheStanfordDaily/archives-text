Clinton's letter reveals
questions that are still
pertinent for activists

BILL CLINTON'S 1969 letter
to his ROTC director reveals
the motivations behind the
Arkansas governor and presidential
candidate's recently publicized
change of draft status. The debate
over the revelations confirms every
college activist's fears that he or she
will have to confront repercussions
for today's actions twenty years later.
The letter, while raising some
important issues, does not destroy
Clinton's political viability. In fact,
the careful thought that went into
the decision to admit his lack of
forthrightness should help his
campaign.
Clinton, who passionately dis
agreed with the Vietnam war but not
war in general, had three options:
resist, participate or pull strings to
stay out of the war.
If he had resisted, as he said sev
eral of his friends did, he would have
elected himself out of the political
system. In real terms, someone who
resists the draft has little chance of
being elected to any public office,
much less the White House.
AJternatively, serving in a war he
hated would have taken his voice
thousands of miles away from the
political debate and perhaps silenced
it forever. And Clinton concluded in
the letter that he could never moral
ly pursue the third option— the Dan
Quayle path to safety.
Clinton said he did not perceive
the U. S. system of government as
being inherently corrupt, as others
did at that time, and he wanted to
stay within it while avoiding a war
he despised. A sophisticated sense
of political foresight coupled with a
demanding conscience made him
decide to enter the draft.
Clinton wavered at a difficult
moment, and now he has to
answer for his actions when he
was roughly the age of a Stanford

undergraduate.
This is not reason enough to dis
qualify him as a candidate.
Clinton was committed to effect
ing change from within the system.
It may not be viewed as a particular
ly brave decision, but it is arguably
the best way to get the job done.
Clinton expresses his uncertain
ty at the end of the letter by saying
it "is no longer clear what is ser
vice and what is disservice, or if it
is clear, the conclusion is likely to
be illegal." The activists of today
must also weigh questions of later
accountability against the desir
ability of the immediate effects of
their actions.
Last year, many students orga
nized rallies, wrote letters and
marched to express opposition to the
Gulf war. A few, like Army reservist
Aimee Allison, resisted quite active
ly. Allison refused to serve, a move
that will certainly damage any
chances she would have had in the
political arena. Many more students
opposed to the war did nothing.
No one acted without consider
ing how he or she would someday
answer the questions now asked of
Clinton. Many concluded that
activism is either ineffective or not
worth the cost down the road.
This problem is not unique to
war protesters. There are Stanford
students currently participating in
needle exchange programs who
fear rejection from medical school,
and students who were arrested
for taking over the President's
office three years ago who must
also fear losing their political via
bility. Anyone who is tempted to
pursue changes that do not have
widespread support must some
how negotiate a similar truce
between beliefs and ambitions.
Ideally, this sort of compromise
would not be required, but it is an
unfortunate reality that does
inevitably alter a would-be activist's
course and can lead to apathy. It is
important to remember that
activism does matter — but it
requires people brave enough to
face down critics twenty years in the
future.
