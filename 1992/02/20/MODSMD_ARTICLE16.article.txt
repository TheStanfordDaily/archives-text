## Jewish and Republican ? 
### 
WHEN KEITH RABOIS shouted
his caustic anti-gay comments in
Otero a few weeks back, I was
once again reminded of my sadness at the
rise of Jewish conservatives. Cornel West
— a leading Afro-American Studies intel
lectual — wrote recently that one form of
black anti-Semitism is to have higher
expectations of Jews than of the general
population. I must confess I suffer from
this bias.
I think, however, my relationship to
Jewish people is different from that of
most blacks. My grandparents are Jew
ish. My father is Jewish. And growing up
in New York, I've always had Jewish
friends, classmates and neighbors.
More recently, I've come to see that all
of these Jews were strongly committed to
progressive issues. Whether its my
grandmother, who works twice a week on
a soup kitchen, or my father, who fought
to register black voters in the South dur
ing Freedom Summer, Jewishness for me
has always been deeply entwined with
liberalism.
I only noticed this at Stanford because
for the first time in my life I had Jewish
classmates and neighbors who were con
servative. It came as a real shock to me to
meet Republican Jews. They made no
sense. For me, Jewishness had come to
mean a commitment to social justice,
concern about the underprivileged and a
drive to act according to those beliefs.

The Jews I encountered at Stanford
were certainly active, but as leaders of
the College Republicans and The Stan
ford Review — groups I found quite hos
tile to my values. I didn't know Jewish
conservatives in New York and I didn't
know what to make of them in California.
Were they more assimilated?
I soon learned that a national Jewish
right had emerged in the Reagan '80s. It
seemed that disenchantment with liber
al politics — especially the rise of affir
mative action — drove a lot of Jewish
folks to the conservative end of the spec
trum. In fact, the movement was so
great that a once liberal journal, Com
mentary, shifted rather dramatically to
the right. What I confronted on campus
was actually happening around the
country.
I know I can't define everything that
is right and wrong by my own political
views, but as I said before, my views
have been heavily shaped by the Jewish
people around me. That many campus
conservatives are also Jewish shakes my
faith.
At the same time, I've come to see that
my expectations are not fair. I know that
Jews, just like blacks or any other group,
are not monolithic — even though they
are constantly viewed as such by out
siders and insiders. The full range of
expression from its most inspiring forms
to its most contemptible are what allow

us to be truly human.
Let me be clear: I think Rabois'
actions fall somewhere in the con
temptible department, but I guess I can't
deny him his views because he is Jewish.
I don't expect every African-American
filmmaker to paint blacks in a positive
light, and similarly I oughtn't expect all
Jews to reflect positive views.
Still, I can't help wonder if Rabois
has a sense of his own history. The
same anti-Semites who hunted down
Jews and forced my grandparents out
of Germany also forced gays to wear
pink triangles. In my mind, AIDS is a
contemporary holocaust that has been
allowed to kill through societal inac
tion and a blame-the-victim mentality.
That Rabois repeats the hateful behav
ior of those who annihilated our for
bearers only points to the limits of
Judaism.
Our society is profoundly homophobic,
and Rabois' actions only reflect this prej
udice. He is right to say that he speaks
for many other people — I need to realize
that this includes Jews.
