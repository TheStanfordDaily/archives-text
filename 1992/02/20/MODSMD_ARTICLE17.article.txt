## Small gains of 'pilot program' come at very high cost 
### 
Thank you for continuing
to cover the proposed changes in
undergraduate education at Stan
ford. I write to clarify several confusing
points about the "pilot program" in
which graduate students from other dis
ciplines would teach Freshman English.
First of all, this project has not been
put forward by the English department
or the Freshman English program.
Indeed, the proposed pilot program is of
great concern to those of us who know
how difficult it is to teach Freshman
English and to train graduate students
in this discipline.
There are enough English graduate
students and lecturers to teach Fresh
man English; in fact, under the proposed
pilot project, our advanced graduate stu
dents stand to lose teaching assignments.
It is true that there are not enough

graduate students on fellowship — that
is, students receiving University finan
cial support — to teach all Freshman
English sections. But if we staffed all of
our sections with new student teachers
on fellowship, there would be no experi
enced teachers left in the program to
mentor those new graduate instructors.
As has been stated before, by the
deans as well as by our department and
program administrators, one of the great
strengths of the Freshman English pro
gram is its combination of faculty, lectur
ers, advanced graduate students and new
teaching fellows engaged in teaching and
learning. Unfortunately, this pilot pro
gram, especially if it is carried beyond
the initial three students, threatens the
well-integrated and well-balanced teach
ing program already is in place.
To clarify another point, only a few

lecturers teach six sections; most teach
fewer. Lecturers teach from one to six
courses often adding courses at the last
minute when graduate students take
leaves of absence or when scheduling
changes must be made. This type of flex
ibility is crucial to our program.
More importantly, the lecturers serve
as the foundation of the mentor pro
gram for graduate students, in addition
to supporting and maintaining other
Freshman English programs and inno
vations. This solid core of excellent
instructors will be diminished, along
with support for advanced graduate stu
dents, by the pilot project.
If all proposed changes are imple
mented, we stand to lose the equivalent
of two full-time lecturer positions next
year, in addition to thes7s,ooo in cuts
we are already implementing this year.

The Freshman English program has
supported the writing resource assis
tants in other disciplines. We welcome
the opportunity to work with academics
in diverse fields and have, in fact, insti
tuted a multi-disciplinary faculty adviso
ry group to offer input on our curricu
lum.
However, while the integration of
small numbers of graduate students
from other disciplines into the program
could be useful, this small gain will come
at a very high cost. The Stanford com
munity has reason to be concerned if the
"experiment" gets out of control.
In the current budget climate, it is all
to easy to find solutions that balance
columns in a spreadsheet but destroy
solid programs in the process.
