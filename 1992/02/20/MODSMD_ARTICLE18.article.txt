# Animal abuse details must be made public
## 
### 
We are writing to express our concern
about the recent reports of animal mis
treatment at Stanford's Research Animal
Facility. We feel that the failure to disclose
the specifics of the abuse is unacceptable
in light of the fact that this research is
funded by the public's tax dollars.
The cover up is no doubt an attempt
to diffuse the severity of the issue, which
has been recognized nationally in papers
such as the New York Times.
By not disclosing the details of the
incident, the University has attempted
to inhibit any scrutiny of cases of abuse,
and more so, hamper the discussion of
the merit of the animal research.
Further, the issue of accountability
must be addressed. Although the Uni
versity claims it is investigating the situ
ation, they have a vested interest in
ensuring the preservation of their gov-

ernmental research grants.
We, the members of Students Con
cerned for Animal Welfare (SCAW), rep
resent a wide spectrum of opinions on
the issue — from antivivisectionists
(against all animal experimentation) to
reformists (using as few animals as
humanely as possible); however, we all
agree that if researchers are abusing
animals we must know about it.
In the Feb. 4 issue of The Daily the
facility's director, Dr. Thomas Hamm,
claims that, "Once or twice a year we
have a matter that's serious enough that
we close la researcher] down." Serious
mistreatment cases should not be occur
ring. Period. And what about the inci
dents that involve abuse, but are not
"serious enough?" Does the researcher
slide by without reprimand?
We have reached a stage where so
many animals are being used — 55,000
housed at Stanford alone — that we
must insist that researchers be held
accountable for their actions. Ultimate
ly, we must challenge the widely held

belief that animal research is our only
option for medical advancement.
