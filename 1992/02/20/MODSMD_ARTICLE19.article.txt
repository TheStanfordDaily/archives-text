# Student input counted in cost increase plans

### 
In his Feb. 19 letter to The Daily,
Jason Snyder claims that students were
not involved in the decision to increase
tuition nor the budget process in gener
al. Snyder claims that the University
"has completely and intentionally denied
... [students'] rights by excluding us
from the decision-making process."
Untrue! As a student serving on the
Cabinet Committee on Budget and
Strategic Planning (CCBSP), I was
involved in the discussions that lead to
the increase in tuition. After carefully
weighing all of the options, I believe that
an increase in tuition offset by a reduc

tion in the self-help component of finan
cial aid is the only reasonable and
humane course of action. I was one of
those who argued in favor of this plan.
You can disagree with me if you want,
but you can't say that students weren't
informed and consulted.
As a member of the CCBSP, I have
spent 15 to 20 hours a week for the last
nine months in budget meetings or
reading budget proposals. The faculty
and the administration have listened to
my opinions and treated me with
respect, sometimes more than I
deserved. Many times in the past
months I have seen my comments or
memos change the budget process in
small but substantial ways.
If Snyder wants to make himself
heard and change this institution, he
has only to apply for a post on a Univer
sity committee through the ASSU nomi
nation process and construct a convinc
ing set of arguments.
