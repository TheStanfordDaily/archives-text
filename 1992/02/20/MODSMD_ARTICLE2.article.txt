# Cabinet satisfied with budget proposals
## Rosse: Discussion of cuts 'fruitful' 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The University Cabinet con
cluded a three-day on-campus
retreat yesterday, deciding not to
make major changes to budget
reduction proposals.
"It was a very fruitful exchange
.. . discussion .. . examination,"
Provost James Rosse said yester
day. "We surfaced a number of
issues but did not attempt to
resolve anything.
"The plans that have come to us
have been carefully worked on and,
by and large, they don't present any
significant problems," Rosse said.

Last month, schools and
administrative areas submitted
their proposals to help reduce the
University's $43-inillion deficit.
Task forces are now examining
the plans along six cross-cutting
themes — undergraduate and
graduate education, research,
support services, the arts and
diversity.
The task forces "did a pretty
good job of looking at the proposals
.. . and we may want them to go
back to a few things," Rosse said.
"There will not be any additional

heavy burden."
The task forces examined how
each them would be affected by
the proposed cuts. They present
ed their reports to the Cabinet
Committee on Budget and Strate
gic Planning and the Cabinet at
the retreat.
The Cabinet completed its
retreat yesterday with a smaller
budget discussion.
"We were simply there to flag
whatever issues were of concern,"
said Sharon Parker, director of
the Office of Multicultural Devel

opment and chair of the diversity
task force. "The group was very
receptive."
But Parker said adequate
responses must be made to ques
tions raised by the task force.
"The issue of multiculturalism
was not addressed consistently in
the budget plans," Parker said.
"For the specific recommenda
tions, we need to know what hap
pens next."
English Prof. George Dekker,
chair of the arts task force, said his
group discussed the likely impact
of the proposed cuts on the arts.
"We explained that if you elim
inate positions in departments
and take away a lot of discre
tionary funds, it will cause signif
icant problems," Dekker said.
"The Cabinet is going to mull over
what we told them, and I think
there may be some minor adjust
ments. But I am not expecting
major changes.
"This is not to say that they
were closed to suggestions, but
they have very little flexibility,"
Dekker said.
Graduate and undergraduate
education also received much
attention during the retreat,
according to participants.
"The areas for concern were
brought up, and the task forces
did a particularly good job in
undergraduate education," said
David Bradfute, the graduate stu
dent representative on the cabi
net budget committee and a mem
ber of the task force on graduate
education.
Rosse said he has "worried a
lot about the impact of increasing
the number of graduate students,
and the retreat explored many of
the issues surrounding that."
The Cabinet will now "digest
what we have learned and work

through the concerns. We need to
make sure that the plans fit
together," Rosse said.
Rosse and University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy will present
the completed University budget
reduction proposal to the Board of
Trustees for approval in April.
While the Cabinet works to put
the finishing touches on the bud
get proposal, "phase two" of the
process will also begin.
To be led initially by Chemistry
Prof. Richard Zare and the Facul
ty Senate Committee on Educa
tion and Scholarship at Stanford,

ford's academic and administra
tive organization, considering
such possibilities as dividing the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences into three schools.
Dekker said that although he
was "not happy" with the retreat
because "severe budget cuts" were
being discussed, he believes
"things are a little better now than
before we went into the retreat."
Bradfute said he was "pretty
happy with the way things went"
but that he now has "more ques
tions than answers coming out of
[the retreat],
"Did we really make cuts the
right way? . .. We are not a small
er place, but we may be a less
well-supported place," Bradfute
said. "Everything is really tight.
We have no discretionary budgets
and have become a University
without discretion."
Bradfute added that most of
his major concerns are to be
addressed during "phase two."

The University Cabinet con
cluded a three-day on-campus
retreat yesterday, deciding not to
make major changes to budget
reduction proposals.
"It was a very fruitful exchange
.. . discussion .. . examination,"
Provost James Rosse said yester
day. "We surfaced a number of
issues but did not attempt to
resolve anything.
"The plans that have come to us
have been carefully worked on and,
by and large, they don't present any
significant problems," Rosse said.

Last month, schools and
administrative areas submitted
their proposals to help reduce the
University's $43-inillion deficit.
Task forces are now examining
the plans along six cross-cutting
themes — undergraduate and
graduate education, research,
support services, the arts and
diversity.
The task forces "did a pretty
good job of looking at the proposals
.. . and we may want them to go
back to a few things," Rosse said.
"There will not be any additional

heavy burden."
The task forces examined how
each them would be affected by
the proposed cuts. They present
ed their reports to the Cabinet
Committee on Budget and Strate
gic Planning and the Cabinet at
the retreat.
The Cabinet completed its
retreat yesterday with a smaller
budget discussion.
"We were simply there to flag
whatever issues were of concern,"
said Sharon Parker, director of
the Office of Multicultural Devel

opment and chair of the diversity
task force. "The group was very
receptive."
But Parker said adequate
responses must be made to ques
tions raised by the task force.
"The issue of multiculturalism
was not addressed consistently in
the budget plans," Parker said.
"For the specific recommenda
tions, we need to know what hap
pens next."
English Prof. George Dekker,
chair of the arts task force, said his
group discussed the likely impact
of the proposed cuts on the arts.
"We explained that if you elim
inate positions in departments
and take away a lot of discre
tionary funds, it will cause signif
icant problems," Dekker said.
"The Cabinet is going to mull over
what we told them, and I think
there may be some minor adjust
ments. But I am not expecting
major changes.
"This is not to say that they
were closed to suggestions, but
they have very little flexibility,"
Dekker said.
Graduate and undergraduate
education also received much
attention during the retreat,
according to participants.
"The areas for concern were
brought up, and the task forces
did a particularly good job in
undergraduate education," said
David Bradfute, the graduate stu
dent representative on the cabi
net budget committee and a mem
ber of the task force on graduate
education.
Rosse said he has "worried a
lot about the impact of increasing
the number of graduate students,
and the retreat explored many of
the issues surrounding that."
The Cabinet will now "digest
what we have learned and work

through the concerns. We need to
make sure that the plans fit
together," Rosse said.
Rosse and University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy will present
the completed University budget
reduction proposal to the Board of
Trustees for approval in April.
While the Cabinet works to put
the finishing touches on the bud
get proposal, "phase two" of the
process will also begin.
To be led initially by Chemistry
Prof. Richard Zare and the Facul
ty Senate Committee on Educa
tion and Scholarship at Stanford,
"phase two" will re-examine Stan

ford's academic and administra
tive organization, considering
such possibilities as dividing the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences into three schools.
Dekker said that although he
was "not happy" with the retreat
because "severe budget cuts" were
being discussed, he believes
"things are a little better now than
before we went into the retreat."
Bradfute said he was "pretty
happy with the way things went"
but that he now has "more ques
tions than answers coming out of
[the retreat],
"Did we really make cuts the
right way? . .. We are not a small

said. "Everything is really tight.

his major concerns are to be
