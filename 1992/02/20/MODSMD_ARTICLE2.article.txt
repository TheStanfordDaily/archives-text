# Cabinet satisfied with budget proposals
## Rosse: Discussion of cuts 'fruitful' 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The University Cabinet con
cluded a three-day on-campus
retreat yesterday, deciding not to
make major changes to budget
reduction proposals.
"It was a very fruitful exchange
.. . discussion .. . examination,"
Provost James Rosse said yester
day. "We surfaced a number of
issues but did not attempt to
resolve anything.
"The plans that have come to us
have been carefully worked on and,
by and large, they don't present any
significant problems," Rosse said.

Last month, schools and
administrative areas submitted
their proposals to help reduce the
University's $43-inillion deficit.
Task forces are now examining
the plans along six cross-cutting
themes â€” undergraduate and
graduate education, research,
support services, the arts and
diversity.
The task forces "did a pretty
good job of looking at the proposals
.. . and we may want them to go
back to a few things," Rosse said.
"There will not be any additional

heavy burden."
The task forces examined how
each them would be affected by
the proposed cuts. They present
ed their reports to the Cabinet
Committee on Budget and Strate
gic Planning and the Cabinet at
the retreat.
The Cabinet completed its
retreat yesterday with a smaller
budget discussion.
"We were simply there to flag
whatever issues were of concern,"
said Sharon Parker, director of
the Office of Multicultural Devel

opment and chair of the diversity
task force. "The group was very
receptive."
But Parker said adequate
responses must be made to ques
tions raised by the task force.
"The issue of multiculturalism
was not addressed consistently in
the budget plans," Parker said.
"For the specific recommenda
tions, we need to know what hap
pens next."
English Prof. George Dekker,
chair of the arts task force, said his
group discussed the likely impact
of the proposed cuts on the arts.
