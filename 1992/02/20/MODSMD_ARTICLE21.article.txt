## Women face pesky Huskies 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
The Washington women's basketball team
was a point behind Stanford with mere seconds
left on the game clock. As the Huskies' point
guard brought the ball to the top of the key, she
dropped it. The ball rolled forward into a crowd of
players scrambling desperately to grab it.
A reserve Husky guard who had only been
playing for a minute or two found the ball at her
feet. Barely pausing to aim and pray, she heaved
the ball in the air. As the buzzer sounded, the ball
fell through the net, ending the nation's second
longest home winning streak at 42 games.
That happened the last time the Cardinal
played Washington in Maples Pavilion. The rival
ry continues tonight on the same floor when No.
6 Stanford takes on the No. 16 Huskies at 7:30
p.m. Fans are advised to arrive early, as the game
is a potential sell-out.
As usual, the match-up has big ramifications
for the Pacific 10 Conference race. As has been
the case the past several years, Stanford is the
top dog and Washington the second-place team
aiming to dethrone it.
But this game has a different look than past
contests between the two rivals. The Huskies are
in a four-way tie for second place, two games
behind the Cardinal. They have only recently re
emerged in the Pac-10 race, having recovered
from an unprecedented four-game losing streak.
There is no doubt that the women in purple will
be fired up to face their arch-nemesis. The big
question for them is, can they fire their offense
up?
Although the Huskies have traditionally been a
better defensive team than offensive, this year

they have really had problems getting points on
the board. They are at the bottom of the confer
ence in field goal percentage, at 40.2 percent. They
are ninth in scoring offense, at 68.8 ppg, and only
two Huskies average scoring in double figures.
Since a draining 101-point double-overtime
performance against Northern Illinois early in
the season, Washington has managed over 73
points only once, against Pac-10 cellar dweller
Arizona.
The upshot of all this is that the Huskies will try
to do what they did so successfully last year: slow
the game down and play tough defense.
But against a Stanford offense ranked in the top
five nationally, which averages 87.3 ppg on 48.6
percent shooting, good defense may not be enough.
For the Cardinal, drawing fouls from the
husky guards could be one route to victory. After
losing starter Katia Foucade to injury early this
year, Washington finds itself with only three true
guards on its roster.
More importantly, Stanford will have to keep
Shaunda Greene and Dianne Williams in check.
Of all the Huskies, these two inside players have
the greatest scoring potential.
Finally, the Cardinal will have to keep the ball
away from guard Laura Moore at the end of the
game. Moore, who last weekend sank a game
winning buzzer-beater against Oregon State, is
the reason why Stanford's current home win
streak stands at 13, instead of 56.
Card notes:
Christy Hedgpeth was named Pac-10 Player of the
Week for her heroics last weekend against UCLA and
USC. The sophomore guard scored 26 points on 9 for
10 shooting in Westwood, and followed with a 16 point
performance against the Trojans.
