For those of you that missed it (and I bet just
about everyone did), here's the story: at
Sunken Diamond Tuesday, the Cardinal fell to
San Jose State in ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING
FINISHES TO A GAME OF BASEBALL .. .EVER.
Unfortunately, outside of the 117 fools who
braved four hours of wind, rain and disgustingly
poor defense by the Spartan left fielder, hardly a
soul knows a thing about the game. The Chronicle
paid tribute with a six-centimeter box score. The
Daily tucked away a scant nine-inch story in the cor
ner of page five.

In a nutshell, San Jose's designated hitter Kraig
Constantino is God. Early in the contest, the 6-foot
5, 235-pound behemoth sent a Tim Moore pitch into
orbit. That shot gave the Spartans an early 3-0 lead,
but the best was yet to come.
Cardinal hurler Aaron Dorlarque entered the
ninth looking strong; he had made the Spartan line
up look helpless over the previous 2-1/3 innings. But
Dorlarque had pitched two innings the day before,
and hadn't gone longer than that all season. So
coach Mark Marquess' decision to leave Dorlarque
in after he walked the first batter on four pitches
had Cardinal fans scratching their collective heads.
To get an idea of how truly incredible the final
inning was, you have to understand that everyone in
the park knew Constantino was absolutely, positive
ly the entire Spartan offense. If ever there was a
case for intentionally beaning a guy, this was it.
It was clear, though, that the Stanford dugout
was hardly concerned with losing their late three
run lead â€” how else can you explain sticking with a
short reliever who, struggling to three-ball counts
on every hitter, had obviously lost it?
Of course questioning an individual decision is
easy with 20-20 hindsight, and maybe the Cardinal
coaching staff had some statistical knowledge us lay
persons didn't know about. Maybe Dorlarque really
was holding 200(+)-pound right-handers to a .138
average in overcast afternoon games on grass when
the wind was blowing north-northeast. Then again,
maybe not.
But all second-guessing aside, Dorlarque was still
Hailing away when up strode Constantino with the
bases jammed. And the long-ball wizard pulled
another mammoth drive out of his hat, answering
the prayers of the Spartan bench and sending the
Cardinal faithful into a state of disbelief.
Dorlarque's two-strike pitch was over the left
field wall the moment it struck the aluminum. Stan
ford outfielders Jeffrey Hammonds and David Cor
nell never even moved. Dorlarque fell to his knees.
The San Jose dugout emptied into a euphoric slam
dance pit at home plate. The rest of Sunken Dia
mond was shell-shocked.
As we know, Stanford failed to score in the bot
tom of the ninth and renewed their year-old tradi
tion of finding a way to lose to Northern California's
lesser-knowns. But after briefly muttering about
how ridiculous it was for Dorlarque to have been left
in the game, I joined the remaining crowd in realiz
ing that we had witnessed a game for the ages.
Little leaguers dream of moments like Constanti
no's. Ninth inning, bases loaded, we're down by
three, two strikes . . .it was perfect. They dream of
crushing one over the fence, of rounding the bases
with a fist pumping in the air, of a girl coming down
from the stands with a congratulatory kiss (I saw
her, I swear). They dream of having candy bars
named after them, and of columnists writing cheesy
poems extolling their heroics ...
Okay maybe they don't dream about the last one,
but sometimes it happens anyway.
There was plenty of joy in Spartanville,
Mighty Kraig had not struck out
No, he'd woven his own epic fairy tale,
With one hell of a ninth-inning clout
