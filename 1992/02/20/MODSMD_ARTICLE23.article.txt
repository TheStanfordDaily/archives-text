Ruggers undefeated in PCC
By Trevor Brown
As the rains broke for the week
end, Stanford rugby continued to
storm through the Pacific Coast Con
ference. On Saturday, the Cardinal
defeated Cal State-Chico 25-3,
improving its PCC record to 4-0.
The Stanford ruggers displayed
their strength, mauling a scrappy and
very physical Chico team. The game
became so rough that at one point
even a fan had to be tended for a minor
concussion caused by a Chico late hit.
"I was getting stepped on, punched,
and hit way late," scrumhalf Kevin
Linker said. "They were very aggres
sive. But physically I think we matched
them, we just did it within the rules."
Despite their physical prowess,
however, Stanford was unable to put a
consistent game plan into action.
"We lacked clear-headed thinking
in the first half. And then you can see
in the second half — poof! — we play
with a clear head and that is that,"
head coach Franck Boivert said.
In the second half, Stanford rat
tled off 19 points. "We didn't have
our heads in the game until the sec

ond half," Linker said.
The Cardinal will attempt to stay
undefeated in conference play this
Saturday, Feb. 22, as they take on
the Gaels of Saint Mary's College.
Sailing ninth at Charleston
By Laurie Wackier

In a regatta that featured the
toughest competition and strongest
currents of the season, Stanford
sailed to a ninth place finish last
weekend at the Charleston Spring
Intersectional. Fourth-ranked Col
lege of Charleston, who hosted the
regatta, took top honors in the two
day contest, which was held on the
Ashley River.
Although the annual event usually
attracts a less competitive mix of
sailors, the nation's best teams scram
bled for a berth in last weekend's con
test. Ranked No. 14 by Sailing World
magazine, Stanford shared the waters
with nine other top-15 teams.
Head Coach Blake Middleton
explained the significance of the
regatta: "Normally, this regatta is not
a big deal, but this year, since

Charleston is the host of the National
Championships, it became one of the
most important events of the year."
The biggest challenge of the regatta
was the ripping current, which occa
sionally swept the entire fleet over the
starting line before the race began. In
addition, the tidal currents caused
boats to hit buoys and each other.
Stanford's ninth place finish met
expectations as they were only beat
en by higher ranked schools. "It was
a respectable performance against
the best teams in the country," Mid
dleton reflected. "But we didn't have
quite as good of boat handling and
speed as we could've had."
Seven sailors traveled to South
Carolina for the regatta. Skipper
Matt Sanford represented Stanford
in A division in 16 of the 17 races,
accompanied by crew Kristen Sidell.
Scott Sellers skippered the other A
division race, accompanied by crew
Andi Guerrero.
Stanford will hoist its sails again
this weekend at Shoreline Lake, in
Mountain View. San Jose State hosts
legs three and four of the North
Series, a sequence of regattas that
determines berths to the Pacific
Championships.

Ultimate travels to Hawaii
By Jeff Chen
The Stanford Men's Ultimate
Team (SMUT) and the Gals' Ulti
mate Team of Stanford (GUTS) dis
pensed with all niceties as they
stormed the beaches of Oahu, Hawaii
last weekend in the fifth annual
Kaimana Classic.
Team Blood (the Cardinal men's
first team) smoked everyone the
opening day, hashing its opposition
by a score of 52-14. The second day,
Blood lost a tough, time-capped
game to the No. 1 seed, the Pones. In
quarterfinal action, The Seven Dead
ly Sins, a Seattle squad, scored early
and forced the Cardinal to play
catch-up. After Blood tied the score
at 10, the squirrely Sins arose, scor
ing the last point to win.
The ladies of Stanford performed
exceptionally well the first day, going
2-1. Their sole defeat came at fee
hands of California's all-star team,
which eventually won the women's
tournament. GUTS was not quite as
fortunate the second day, losing a
tough quarterfinal match to the host
Wahines.
