# Nelson to join Walsh's staff
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Just as music artists compile
their greatest hits, new head
football coach Bill Walsh is
bringing back former players and
assistants in forming an all-star
coaching staff on The Farm. Yes
terday, former Stanford and
Minnesota Viking running back
Darrin Nelson became the
newest member of "Bill's
Brethren".
With his appointment to the
running back coach post, Nelson
announced his retirement from
the Vikings after enjoying a 10
year career in the National Foot
ball League. He played for the
Vikings from 1982-89 and again
last season, with a two-year stint
with the San Diego Chargers in
1989 and 1990.
"I had a great time playing
professional football and I
accomplished a great deal," Nel
son said. "But this is a unique
opportunity to return to Stan
ford and coach under Bill Walsh.
I'm excited about the opportuni
ty to return to Stanford and the
college game.
"Coaching will be a new expe
rience for me, but I'm looking
forward to it. There is something
about Stanford that draws you
back. This is a chance for me and
my family to get back to Stanford
and the Bay Area."

Nelson played for the Cardinal
from 1977-1981, and was a half
back under Walsh his freshman
and sophomore seasons. He is
one of only two players in Pacific
10 Conference history to have
been named All-Conference four
times, and finished sixth in the
Heisman Trophy balloting his
senior season.
He set numerous school
records, five of which still stand:
career rushing yards (4,003),
career receptions (214), career
touchdowns (40), career all-pur
pose yardage (6,885), and single
game receiving yards (237). Nel
son's single season rushing
record of 1,069 yards lasted until
this year, when it was broken by
Tommy Vardell, who had 1,084.
"I am very excited and pleased
that Darrin is returning to Stan
ford," Walsh said. "He brings a
wealth of knowledge related to
the game of football. But, more
importantly, he truly represents
the ultimate in the Stanford stu
dent-athlete."
In the NFL, Nelson had a solid
career. He was the seventh play
er chosen in the first-round of
the 1982 NFL draft, and led Min
nesota in rushing five times. His
best effort occurring in the 1985
season when he gained 893 yards
on the season.
Nelson returns to the Farm in
time to see current Cardinal star
running back Glyn Milburn

through his senior season. Many
comparisons have been made
between the two backs in the
past.
"I think it's great," said fresh
man Ozzie Grenardo of Nelson's
appointment. "He's going to
really help out Glyn and the
other backs a lot. He's probably
the greatest running back in
Stanford history, so there's a lot
we can learn from him."
Walsh has now filled eight of
his nine assistant coaching slots.
Nelson's predecessor, Tyrone
Willingham, is now a member of
the coaching staff of the Dallas
Cowboys.
