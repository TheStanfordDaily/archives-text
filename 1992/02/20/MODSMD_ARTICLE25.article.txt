# Another Pauley win?
## Hoops seek third in row on Bruins' court 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
It has been 11 years since UCLA
appeared in the Final Four, and 16
years since the last championship
banner was hung in the rafters of
Pauley Pavilion. But make no mis
take about it—hoops is back with a
vengeance in Westwood.
Tonight, as the Cardinal faces
the Bruins in Los Angeles, it will
not merely be playing another tal
ented UCLA team. This year's
version of the Bruins is deter
mined, focused, ranked No. 2 in
the country, and poised to make a
run at their first national champi
onship since the John Wooden
era. Indeed, their home game on
March 1 against No. 1 Duke could
be a preview of the NCAA tourna
ment finals.
Now in his third year, head
coach Jim Harrick has led the
Bruins to three 20-win seasons
and three NCAA appearances
after succeeding Walt Hazzard.
Unlike what has been the tenden
cy is recent years, UCLA has been
playing as a team rather than as
individuals. Harrick, in bringing
in his own recruits and losing
Hazzard's crops to graduation,
has been able to phase out the
one-on-one play that character
ized Hazzard's tenure. The result
is a very talented basketball team.
"They're awfully good," said
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery
of the Bruins. "They're a big,
strong, veteran team. They don't
really have many weaknesses.
They're focused on what they want
to accomplish, and bouyed by the
fact of being number two in the
country is a tremendous incentive."
"What first strikes me when I
think of UCLA is how physically
talented and gifted they are,"
Stanford All-America candidate

Adam Keefe said. "They have
eignt or nine high school all
Americans on their team, and
they are a very talented team."
Harrick, though, thinks his
team can do even better.
"I think we've played awfully
well on the road and on neutral
floors, haven't played so well at
home, and haven't had a killer
instinct to the point where we've
jumped up and beaten teams that
we should beat and taken care of
business," the coach said. "How
ever, for the most part we keep
getting better, we've shared the
ball awfully well, defended well,
played big in big games, and I've
been mostly pleased."
Anchoring the 20-1 Bruins are
the "M & M Boys," forwards Don
MacLean and Tracy Murray.
Both players are averaging better
than twenty points per game and
shooting over 50% from the field,
with MacLean at 20.9 ppg and
53.4%, and Murray posting 20.6
ppg and 52.7%. Together, they
form perhaps the best forward
tandem in the country.
MacLean, a 6-10 senior All-
America candidate from Simi Val
ley, Calif., is nominated for the
John Wooden and James Naismith
Awards, given annually to college
basketball's best player. "He's just
been a tower of strength for us,"
Harrick said. "He's having a
tremendous basketball season."
Meanwhile, Murray, a 6-9
junior from Glendora, Calif., is
shooting a scorching 54.6% from
three-point range, a mark which
ranks him first in the Pacific 10
conference and second nationally.
"Tracy is one of the best shoot
ers in the country, not just in the
league," Keefe said. "His improved
play has probably helped them
