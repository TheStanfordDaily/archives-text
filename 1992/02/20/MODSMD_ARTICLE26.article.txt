# 'I never realized I was different'
## Kenyan journalist comes to America, finds racism 
### Karen Jordan 
After three months of experi
encing racism firsthand in the
United States, Kenya native
Makena Aritho says she has
found a new respect for African-
Americans.
"I was really arrogant
[toward] African-Americans
when I came" to the United
States, she said. "I thought they

were just whining and trying to
blame someone else. I also felt
envious because they have all
these chances that Africans will
never have."
But now, Aritho says, her
opinion has changed.
"I really admire African-
Americans," she said. Aritho,
currently studying at Stanford in
the John S. Knight journalism
fellowship program, said she had

not experienced racism before
coming to the United States.
"I was shocked when I came,"
she said. "It hit me the hardest
that I was black. I never realized
I was different."
In Kenya, Aritho was chief
features writer and deputy
metro editor at The Kenya
Times, one of Nairobi's three
major daily newspapers. The
Knight fellowship program she is

participating in allows journal
ists to come to Stanford to exam
ine issues from an academic per
spective.
But her most important
learning has not come in the
classroom — it has come in her
daily interactions.
"Since I'm a journalist, I
watch people a lot," Aritho said,
adding that in several instances,
she has seen people's expressions
change when they see her. She
said she even recalls seeing
whites sit in the back of buses to
avoid being near her.
"I can't imagine what it was
like in the '505," she said. "It
breaks your heart."
Aritho said a fellow Knight
fellow has been instructive in
helping her to understand these
issues. Joyce Ingram, an African-
American, gave her "hard talk"
and books to read, Aritho said.
"She's been my teacher,"
Aritho said. "I irritated her [at
first], and I know I did now, but
I've become more sensitive to
African-Americans and their
needs."
She said that before coming to
the United States, she was not
aware of the African-Americans'
struggle against discrimination.
Instead, Aritho said, she had a
childhood bereft of many of the
advantages that African-Ameri
cans have.
"I was born in a very, very
remote part of Kenya," she
said. "It was a place where it
was raging forest, and my parents
had been sent there as medical
staff. ... It was a matter of
clearing forest and bush to set
up our house over there."

But Aritho was able to devel
op a love for reading with the
encouragement of a brother who
attended a Jesuit school.
"Books were very precious,"
she said. "I guess that's when I
learned to appreciate books."
She never imagined as a child
that she would grow up to
become a journalist. "I can't say
that I had this 'passion to
write,'" she said. "It was just
sort of fun for me."
Journalism, however, has
proven less fun at times. A
recent riot in Kenya prompted
Aritho to take a break from her
profession.
She was caught in the riot
shortly after the murder of the
Kenyan foreign minister. After
running from bullets and tear
gas, she and a photographer
were trapped in a car that the
rioters had overturned and set
on fire.
She remembers saying then,
"I'm so tired of my life. It's dan
ger day-in and day-out."
After that incident, Aritho
said, "I told them I'm absolutely
quitting the trade."
Following the advice of a
Reuters reporter, she applied to
the Knight fellowship program.
Although she knew a great
deal about African-American his
tory before coming to the United
States, Aritho said "it never
touched me."
"It was just information until
I came here," she said. "I remem
ber I wrote a couple of articles
about Martin Luther King, and I
thought it was a nice story, that's
all, Very sad, very emotional, but
not personal."

that I was black. I never realized
I was different."
In Kenya, Aritho was chief
features writer and deputy
metro editor at The Kenya
Times, one of Nairobi's three
major daily newspapers. The
Knight fellowship program she is

participating in allows journal
ists to come to Stanford to exam
ine issues from an academic per
spective.
But her most important
learning has not come in the
classroom — it has come in her
daily interactions.
"Since I'm a journalist, I
watch people a lot," Aritho said,
adding that in several instances,
she has seen people's expressions
change when they see her. She
said she even recalls seeing
whites sit in the back of buses to
avoid being near her.
"I can't imagine what it was
like in the '505," she said. "It
breaks your heart."
Aritho said a fellow Knight
fellow has been instructive in
helping her to understand these
issues. Joyce Ingram, an African-
American, gave her "hard talk"
and books to read, Aritho said.
"She's been my teacher,"
Aritho said. "I irritated her [at
first], and I know I did now, but
I've become more sensitive to
African-Americans and their
needs."
She said that before coming to
the United States, she was not
aware of the African-Americans'
struggle against discrimination.
Instead, Aritho said, she had a
childhood bereft of many of the
advantages that African-Ameri
cans have.
"I was born in a very, very
remote part of Kenya," she
said. "It was a place where it
was raging forest, and my parents
had been sent there as medical
staff. ... It was a matter of
clearing forest and bush to set
up our house over there."

But Aritho was able to devel
op a love for reading with the
encouragement of a brother who
attended a Jesuit school.
"Books were very precious,"
she said. "I guess that's when I
learned to appreciate books."
She never imagined as a child
that she would grow up to
become a journalist. "I can't say
that I had this 'passion to
write,'" she said. "It was just
sort of fun for me."
Journalism, however, has
proven less fun at times. A
recent riot in Kenya prompted
Aritho to take a break from her
profession.
She was caught in the riot
shortly after the murder of the
Kenyan foreign minister. After
running from bullets and tear
gas, she and a photographer
were trapped in a car that the
rioters had overturned and set
on fire.
She remembers saying then,
"I'm so tired of my life. It's dan
ger day-in and day-out."
After that incident, Aritho
said, "I told them I'm absolutely
quitting the trade."
Following the advice of a
Reuters reporter, she applied to
the Knight fellowship program.
Although she knew a great
deal about African-American his
tory before coming to the United
States, Aritho said "it never
touched me."
"It was just information until
I came here," she said. "I remem
ber I wrote a couple of articles
about Martin Luther King, and I
thought it was a nice story, that's
all, Very sad, very emotional, but
not personal."

Currently enrolled in the John S. Knight journalism fellowship program, Kenyan Makena Aritho says
her encounters with racism in the United States have greatly impacted the way she regards African-
Americans. "I really admire" them, she says.
