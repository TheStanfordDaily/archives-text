# INTERMISSION
## Beowulf off the coast of Maine 
### Benjamin Lai 
THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY

Editor's Note: This is the second
installment of a four-part story
that will appear in Intermission.

She sat there in the fishing
boat, Mankiewicz from the New
York Times, tracking down the
famous professorial wrestler of
sharks and fisher with bare
hands. This was actually a sab
batical for her, a punishment for
arguing once too many with her
boss the happy liberal. Enjoy
New England for awhile, he said.
Don't come back too early. I love
you too, Mike. I'll come back
when I'm done with Beowulf.
<^s>>
I shall escape from foul mor
tality to live eternal life with you.
The sight of you is food enough
to feed me a thousand years!
Come down and play with me,
sweet nymph, and blast my eyes
awake; come bathe me in your
gentle light, come burn me in
your flame.
So this is where the old bas
tard lives, in the middle of wet
nowhere. Is Mitchell going to try
something funny here, alone
with me, in the middle of the
night? Nope. He's a well-bred
Catholic's son. Not too bloody
exciting, I'm afraid.
Annie sat on the back of the
two-tiered fishing boat, looking
into the horizon. She tried to fin
ish "The Old Man and the Sea";
in case she couldn't find Beowulf
— er, Felix — her story could use
some Hemingway. Mitchell had
refused to tell much about his
own life, knowing it would end
up all over the world in two days.
He had wanted to know more
about her, so she had told him;
but without the right to invade
his privacy, telling him her own
life story was not much fun, so
she just shut up after a while.
The only child of the only chil
dren of rich Polish merchants
and bankers who lost everything
in the Great War, Anna Karena
Mankiewicz grew up believing
that the world was out to get her
kind. She knew how to take a
stand in the City, and she could
stop any drunken asshole with a
loud phrase or two in Brookly
nese.
She worked for the Times
because it gave her the most
power. Everybody who was any
body had heard of the Times. She
could sweet-talk her way out of
muggings, and then she would

always trace their ass until they
were booked. If the world was a
tough place to live in, well, Annie
Mankiewicz was going to be tougher.
She forgot to tell Mitchell that
she had never, to her knowledge,
been in love.
So send a sign from your lofty
chariot, a test of my aspiring vow
unto death for you; yes! Send an
angel of temptation, a demon
from the world beyond, a vessel to
the stars and to the bottom of the
ocean, that I may prove in death
what I cannot prove in life: how
fathomless is my fount for you!
Suddenly the boat shook.
Something solid had tapped the
side. Beowulf. . . ? Nope — just a

buoy. A few more hours, though,
and I'll have Santiago back on
shore. Ernest darling, why
couldn't you be alive today so
that I could respect somebody
with a penis?
Somebody grabbed her shoul
der.
"Mitchell?"
"You've come for me. I will
show you my soul." It wasn't
Mitchell's voice.
"Beo ... Felix?"
"Follow me to my home if you
wish to test my mettle."
Yep; sounds like an English
professor.
"Hold on, old man. Why can't
we talk here?" She shrugged off
his hold on her shoulder.
When she turned to look at
him, she was surprised to see a
wizened, wrinkled, pitifully thin
man leaning on a stick of drift
wood. Not her picture of what he
ought to look like at all. Not San-

tiago, that is.
"We will not talk here. Mitchell
will overhear too much. ... If you
do not come with me now, we
shall never meet again."
"All right, all right! Just wait a
minute while I go tell Mitch I'm
leaving with you." She got up and
started towards the fishing boat's
cabin.
But he grabbed her arm.
"Mitchell is . . . asleep."

"Then I'll wake him up." She
shook his grip off.
u No. If you do not come now, we
do not talk. You lose your story."
He started hobbling back towards
the dinghy he had come on. How'd
that dinghy get here? She hadn't
heard or seen anything.
Hmmm. Is it worth it? Is it
worth it... ?
"Fine, asshole. Look. . . ."
Annie scribbled "Call Coast
Guard" on a grocery receipt and
slipped it into the cabin. "Look,
I'm coming, I'm coming."
Mitchell looked comfortable in
the rope hammock in the cabin,
hands on his stomach, legs
crossed at the ankle, eyes wide
open. His face was blue.
Annie quietly stepped off the
fishing boat onto the little
dinghy. Beowulf seemed harm
less enough. Nothing a veteran
New Yorker hadn't dealt with
before.
