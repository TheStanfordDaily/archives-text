# Street performers shape instability into living art
## 
### Sean Etigson Staff writer 
A voice interrupted one of many pedes
trians walking down University Avenue on
a Saturday afternoon.
"Would you like to hear a song I wrote
this week?" Bill Johnson asked, nylon
stringed guitar in hand.
Launching into a pleasant finger-pick
ing melody, Johnson commented, "This
street is a center for songwriters." Though
his statement may sound surprising, a
number of musicians have taken to per
forming on the streets of downtown Palo
Alto.
Johnson, a recent transplant from the
Los Angeles area, left a telemarketing job
to pursue his music.
"I just decided it was time to start living
rather than existing," he said. "I'm 43 now,
and I'm doing what most people do in their
twenties."
Stationed under the Wiedeman's facade
on University and Bryant, Johnson played
to a few curious observers. Strangely
enough, the building's stone walls provided
excellent acoustics.
One little girl, intrigued by the music,
asked her mother for some money to put in

Johnson's guitar case. Once the coins jin
gled in her hands, though, she hesitated,
uncertain of quite how to approach. Final
ly, her mother took the (" ango and ginger
ly placed it in the case herself.
"I see so many people that are afraid to
smile," Johnson said after the mother and
daughter entered the store ink our
society has a long way to g <:>n under
standing artists."
Performing on the street a ' a way
to try out new material and make contact
with people," he said.
Though he has worked in the produc
tion side of the music industry, Johnson
said that it was a little odd to be playing out
on the street.
"I never thought of doing this kind of
thing before," he explained. "Now, this
type of performing feels like a finishing
school for what I'm in the process of
becoming."
Johnson said his future will include
playing in clubs or cafes. He said he also
hopes that some type of recording contract
wil come of his performing.
A saxophone player further down Uni
versity, on Waverly, was taking time to
explain his art to a pair of elderly gentle
men. While talking about tone and note

choice, he played a few phrases to show
them what he meant.
Although the sax player asked not to be
identified, he did say that he performs on
the street "because I have something to
share with people."
On the street, he said, "You can really
learn something, because you're so close."
Those not afraid to ask questions learn the
most, he added, smiling at the two older
men.
Part of the thrill of street performing, as
Johnson and the saxophonist point out, lies
in the intimate relationship between the
performer and the audience. Without the
distancing aspects of the stage or the con
cert hall, onlookers are left with a uniquely
human spectacle.
The street performers minimizes the
physical distance between themselves and
their audience out of necessity. This practi
cal extension of the performance space,
however, fits in with the intellectual con
cepts at work in an event like John Cage's
Musicircus.
"You can't care what other people think.
You just have to love it to do it. The one or
two people who look you in the eye make it
worth it," said senior Kevin Donlon, who
participated in that avant garde happening.

"Most people were at the Musicircus to
see it. It had the street performing element
to a certain degree, though," he said.
"Some people would just walk by, not nec
essarily watching you or listening to you."
Donlon said that in a situation like
street performance, where very few people
will appreciate the creativity at work, "You
just have to feel that you're touching the
human spirit a little bit."
Some performers say they have prob
lems reaching out to the people because the
shop owners and officers from the Palo
Alto Police Department move them along.
Neither Johnson nor the saxophonist
reported problems with the police, but har
monica player Tom Windam said he can't
stay in one place for more than an hour at
a time.
Because of his ragged appearance, Win
dam said, shop owners don't like him play
ing in front of their establishments and
have the police ask him to move. "I'm just
trying to play and make a few bucks, but
they're all hung up on the way I look,"
Windam said.
A native of New York City, Windam said
"you get some people out on the street in
the Village or in Harlem that can
just flat out play, and nobody
cares what they look like."
But according to a representa
tive from the Police Department,
"There's no ordinances against
[street performing]."
The intrigue of street perform
ing rests partially in this type of
instability. For people like Win
dam, Johnson and tne saxophone
player, the uncertainty of their
performance space relates to the
uncertainty in their lives. Beyond
the perfection of the concert hall,
they create a living art.

wil come of his performing.
A saxophone player further down Uni
versity, on Waverly, was taking time to
explain his art to a pair of elderly gentle
men. While talking about tone and note

choice, he played a few phrases to show
them what he meant.
Although the sax player asked not to be
identified, he did say that he performs on
the street "because I have something to
share with people."
On the street, he said, "You can really
learn something, because you're so close."
Those not afraid to ask questions learn the
most, he added, smiling at the two older
men.
Part of the thrill of street performing, as
Johnson and the saxophonist point out, lies
in the intimate relationship between the
performer and the audience. Without the
distancing aspects of the stage or the con
cert hall, onlookers are left with a uniquely
human spectacle.
The street performers minimizes the
physical distance between themselves and
their audience out of necessity. This practi
cal extension of the performance space,
however, fits in with the intellectual con
cepts at work in an event like John Cage's
Musicircus.
"You can't care what other people think.
You just have to love it to do it. The one or
two people who look you in the eye make it
worth it," said senior Kevin Donlon, who
participated in that avant garde happening.

"Most people were at the Musicircus to
see it. It had the street performing element
to a certain degree, though," he said.
"Some people would just walk by, not nec
essarily watching you or listening to you."
Donlon said that in a situation like
street performance, where very few people
will appreciate the creativity at work, "You
just have to feel that you're touching the
human spirit a little bit."
Some performers say they have prob
lems reaching out to the people because the
shop owners and officers from the Palo
Alto Police Department move them along.
Neither Johnson nor the saxophonist
reported problems with the police, but har
monica player Tom Windam said he can't
stay in one place for more than an hour at
a time.
Because of his ragged appearance, Win
dam said, shop owners don't like him play
ing in front of their establishments and
have the police ask him to move. "I'm just
trying to play and make a few bucks, but
they're all hung up on the way I look,"
Windam said.
A native of New York City, Windam said
"you get some people out on the street in
the Village or in Harlem that can
just flat out play, and nobody
cares what they look like."
But according to a representa
tive from the Police Department,
"There's no ordinances against
[street performing]."
The intrigue of street perform
ing rests partially in this type of
instability. For people like Win
dam, Johnson and tne saxophone
player, the uncertainty of their
performance space relates to the
uncertainty in their lives. Beyond
the perfection of the concert hall,
they create a living art.
A voice interrupted one of many pedes
trians walking down University Avenue on
a Saturday afternoon.
"Would you like to hear a song I wrote
this week?" Bill Johnson asked, nylon
stringed guitar in hand.
Launching into a pleasant finger-pick
ing melody, Johnson commented, "This
street is a center for songwriters." Though
his statement may sound surprising, a
number of musicians have taken to per
forming on the streets of downtown Palo
Alto.
Johnson, a recent transplant from the
Los Angeles area, left a telemarketing job
to pursue his music.
"I just decided it was time to start living
rather than existing," he said. "I'm 43 now,
and I'm doing what most people do in their
twenties."
Stationed under the Wiedeman's facade
on University and Bryant, Johnson played
to a few curious observers. Strangely
enough, the building's stone walls provided
excellent acoustics.
One little girl, intrigued by the music,
asked her mother for some money to put in

Johnson's guitar case. Once the coins jin
gled in her hands, though, she hesitated,
uncertain of quite how to approach. Final
ly, her mother took the (" ango and ginger
ly placed it in the case herself.
"I see so many people that are afraid to
smile," Johnson said after the mother and
daughter entered the store ink our
society has a long way to g <:>n under
standing artists."
Performing on the street a ' a way
to try out new material and make contact
with people," he said.
Though he has worked in the produc
tion side of the music industry, Johnson
said that it was a little odd to be playing out
on the street.
"I never thought of doing this kind of
thing before," he explained. "Now, this
type of performing feels like a finishing
school for what I'm in the process of
becoming."
Johnson said his future will include
playing in clubs or cafes. He said he also
hopes that some type of recording contract
wil come of his performing.
