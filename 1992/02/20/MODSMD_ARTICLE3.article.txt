# 'Kirk or Picard? Why?'
## Tree applicants face unique test 
### John Ford Staff writer 
The Stanford Band yesterday
began its quest to find next year's
Tree, and it includes an applica
tion procedure so bizarre and rig
orous that it makes getting into
Stanford look easy.
The competition for the presti
gious spot drew a total of 52 appli
cants last year, according to Peter
Huyck, the current Stanford Tree.
Other Band sources place last
year's number closer to seven.
Huyck said he submitted appli
cation forms to the Office of Stu
dent Activities yesterday. Poten
tial Trees can pick up applications
at the office, located on the second
floor of Tresidder Student Union.
This year's contestants, Huyck
said, should be prepared to
answer such questions as, "You
must scale a twelve foot sheer
wall. You are given one foot of
rubber hose, half an orange peel,
a small shaved dog and a pint of
lard. How do you do it?"
Huyck, who will make the

application and help choose the
new Tree, Laid he also plans to
ask: "Kirk or Picard? Why?"
After prospective Trees hand
in thei/ applications, the field will
be narrowed to a select few who
are granted "auditions," which
will be held in late February or

early March, according to Huyck.
The audition is a "lengthy and
painful" process that tests the
creativity and enthusiasm of each
applicant, Huyck said.
Although Huyck was reluctant
k) grant specific information about
the auditions, he said that his own
duties will involve "administering
the peanut butter."
Huyck said he will serve as
"Grand High Poobah of Cere
monies" for the auditions. Also on
hand will be a number of wacky
Band personnel to help with the
agonizing decision-making process.
In the past, such campus
celebrities as "the guy from
Tresidder Express" have helped
out with the auditions, according
to Huyck. He said he hopes Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
will participate this year.
When asked about the quali
ties a good Tree candidate should
have, Huyck said, "Sweating is
key. Criminal record is a bonus."
Another prerequisite is a lot of
free time. "It's your life for one
year," Huyck said.
