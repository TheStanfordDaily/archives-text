# Asian-American 'Crucible' asks if we still burn witches
## 
### Erin Jordan 
An old story is given renewed
significance in the joint Drama
Department and Asian-American
Theatre Project production of
Arthur Miller's classic "The Cru
cible."
Set in Salem in 1692, "The
Crucible" is a powerful dramatic
re-telling of the infamous Salem
Witch Hunts.
Written in the 19505, Miller's
play originally served as a scathing
attack on Sen. Joseph McCarthy
and the communist scare that
was sweeping the nation. But as
this production hopes to point
out, "The Crucible" is actually a
reminder of what can happen in
any community, in every avenue
of American life.
In an all-around solid cast, cer
tain performances stand out.
Michi Barall's Abigail Williams is
played powerfully as a young
woman looking desperately for
acceptance from her married,
one-time lover only to become the
ring-leader of the movement that
ultimately causes his execution.
Unfortunately, Russel Lee gives a
somewhat stiff* portrayal of the

former lover, John Proctor, though
his performance improved as the
play progressed.
Paco Farias, on the other hand,
gives a very real and compassion
ate performance as the Reverend
Hale, who grows to realize the
dangerous magnitude of the situa
tion but is too late to stop it.
In the show's most impressive
performance, Alys Shanti plays
Deputy Governor Danforth to the
hilt as an arrogant, frustrating
and rather cruel judge who pre
sides over the hearings.
The roles of Hale and Danforth
are cast interestingly within the
context of this play. Director
David Kurtz chose a member of a
non-Asian minority to play Hale
in order to emphasize the "out
sider" feeling this character
brings to the community. Dan
forth is played by a woman to con
vey the possibility of alternative
feminine power outside of what
Miller's writing allows.
The first half of the show
never quite reaches the tension
level it should, but the second
half, with its well-played court-


Anne Larlarb - Dally
room scenes, more than makes
up for this lack.
The subtle set and sound
design complement the show
beautifully, as well as augmenting
the Asian theme Kurtz has cho
sen. The heavy-handed blocking
feels a bit over-choreographed at
times, but it serves to remind the
viewer of the sternness and rigid
ity of the Puritan community.
This production is both enter

taining and enlightening. By
putting a historical American
play in an Asian-American con
text, the AATP has given new,
universal meaning to Miller's
message.
This show is a pleasure to
watch and should be on every
one's "must see" list.

"The Crucible" will be performed
tonight through Feb. 22 and Feb.
26-29 at 8 p.m. in Memorial
Hall's Little Theater. Tickets are
$5 for students, $8 general, and
are available at Tresidder Ticket
Office or at the door.
