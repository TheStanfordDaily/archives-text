# Improv group delves within to find laughs for everyone

Tad Glauthier, current
director of Stanford improv
group Spontaneous Genera
tion, urges his actors to bring
day-to-day life onstage, aban
doning cheap laughs for more
meaningful humor.
Only recently returned from
the National College Comedy
Festival at Skidmore College,
the group will present the first
of three campus-wide perfor
mances at Ricker Dining Hall
tonight.
Founding producer Karen
Horwitz explained that each
evening will focus on a differ
ent theme. Tonight's show,
titled "Lust, Love, Limprov,"
highlights romance, while Fri
day's show will cover fantasy
with "Snow White and the
Seven Improvs." Their final
performance, "Raiders of the
Lost Art," focuses on adven

ture.
A talented comedian can
make detonating an explosion
of hysterical laughter look as
easy as charging a credit card to
its limit. However, a comic's
technique, like a credit card
bill, must be paid for. This pay
ment is usually in the form of
enormous sums of time and
energy.
Time and energy provide an
important foundation for the
workshop-oriented Sponta
neous Generation, which has
been instrumental in establish
ing a concrete forum for come
dy and improv on campus.
Only a year old, the 30-mem
ber group meets weekly to
practice the art of improvisa
tion, using games and impro
vised scenarios as instructional
aids for schooling new and old
members alike in the theory
