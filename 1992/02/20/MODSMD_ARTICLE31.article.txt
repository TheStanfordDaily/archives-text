# Improv group delves within to find laughs for everyone
## 
### Victor Haseman 
Tad Glauthier, current
director of Stanford improv
group Spontaneous Genera
tion, urges his actors to bring
day-to-day life onstage, aban
doning cheap laughs for more
meaningful humor.
Only recently returned from
the National College Comedy
Festival at Skidmore College,
the group will present the first
of three campus-wide perfor
mances at Ricker Dining Hall
tonight.
Founding producer Karen
Horwitz explained that each
evening will focus on a differ
ent theme. Tonight's show,
titled "Lust, Love, Limprov,"
highlights romance, while Fri
day's show will cover fantasy
with "Snow White and the
Seven Improvs." Their final
performance, "Raiders of the
Lost Art," focuses on adven

ture.
A talented comedian can
make detonating an explosion
of hysterical laughter look as
easy as charging a credit card to
its limit. However, a comic's
technique, like a credit card
bill, must be paid for. This pay
ment is usually in the form of
enormous sums of time and
energy.
Time and energy provide an
important foundation for the
workshop-oriented Sponta
neous Generation, which has
been instrumental in establish
ing a concrete forum for come
dy and improv on campus.
Only a year old, the 30-mem
ber group meets weekly to
practice the art of improvisa
tion, using games and impro
vised scenarios as instructional
aids for schooling new and old
members alike in the theory
and rules of improv.
The group also performs week
ly dorm shows, which, according
to Glauthier, are an essential part
of the group's continuing mission.
"[Our missionj is about teaching
anybody who wants to learn and
getting the word out," he said.
Keeping in stride with this mis
sion, Spontaneous Generation
welcomes all interested parties
regardless of experience.
This openness, of course,
requires Glauthier and other vet
eran members to be exceptionally

accommodating, but at the same
time provides a distinct diversity
that more professionally-oriented
groups lack.
Conceptually, Horwitz and
director Raphe Beck said they
believe this aspect of the group is
the most important. They hope to
establish improv on campus by
appealing to the people most
important to the Stanford com
munity: its residents.
Improvisation is usually
defined a type of performance
where a person or a group of peo
ple devise impromptu comic skits,
usually based on audience sugges
tion. However, Glauthier sums it
up differently.
"What improv is, is getting on

stage and having your pants
down. .. . It's finding an interest
ing story or something other peo
ple are gonna be touched by,
'cause, whether humorously or
genuinely touching, if it's real it's
going to be important. It doesn't
have to be hilariously funny for
people to watch it."
Above all else, Glauthier, Hor
witz and Beck want to get as many
people interested and involved as
possible. Based on the group's sin
cerity, dedication to quality and
two-dollar admission price, they
shouldn't have many problems.

Spontaneous Generation will per
form tonight, Friday and Saturday
at Bp.m. in Richer Dining Hall.
