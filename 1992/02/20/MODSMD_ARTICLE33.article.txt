# An interview with the vampire of rock
## 
### Nicole Sanchez 
If grinding, rattling, blood-suck
ing rock 'n' roll isn't for you, then
neither is LA Guns. Driven by the
hard-edged guitar work of founder
Tracii Guns and the often sexually
adventurous lyrics of vocalist Philip
Lewis, LA. Guns is one of those
bands that you're proud your par
ents don't like.
Often clad in black garb and full
makeup, LA Guns has come to be
known by loyal followers as the "Hol
lywood Vampires."
Their most recent album pos
sesses the same name because, as
Lewis has proclaimed, "We live the
life — up all night, sleep all day."
Lewis and his cronies — lead
guitarist Guns, bassist Kelly Nick
els, rhythm guitarist Mick Cripps
and recently-replaced drummer
Steve Riley — have seen much suc
cess over the last four years with
their three LP's, "L.A. Guns,"
"Cocked and Loaded" and "Holly
wood Vampires," and the chart
breaking "The Ballad of Jayne."
But the amiable Lewis doesn't
want anyone to get the wrong
image of the life of a rock 'n' roll
star such as himself.
"Don't for a second think that
we're millionaires and we're all living
in splendor and 'Oh, God, not the Bel
uga caviar again.' We're as freaked

out as everyone else," he said
Lewis seems to go out of his way
to fight the image of the sunglasses
donning, egotistical rock star, and
to put the emphasis back on the
music and the people it readies.
"I mean, it's very gratifying to go
into an arena or a stadium like we
can do [in Los Angeles], and see
10,000 beaming faces. I think, 'Wow,
this is it. The big time,' " he said.
"But then it's great to get gritty
and nasty in a sweaty club and be
more into that level with the people
that come and see us," he added.
From the concern Lewis displays
for his audience, it is obvious that
this is a major issue in his career.
"I don't use the word 'fan.' Any
thing but that — like 'friends.'
'Fans' is like 'my sycophants and I.'
I hate that word. It just conjures up
awful pictures of some dopey kid
who doesn't know his left hand
from his right. I don't like to think
of us as being any better than the
people we're playing to."
In the same breath, however,
Lewis described himself as being
part of "a generation of fans" and
fondly recalled attending a Ziggy
Stardust concert.
"I remember being right at the
front and I touched Bowie as he
came down the catwalk. I just man
aged to touch his shoe," Lewis said,
his voice cracking as it must have

that night.
"I just didn't want to wash my
hand. It was just unreal. I've
touched a greater species," he said.
As well as Bowie, Lewis credits
T. Rex and Sly and the Family
Stone as his earliest influences.
"I wanted to be a professional
soccer player. And then I started lis
tening to music and I got an old
Egmond guitar, a big old chunk of
wood with some strings on it. I just
used to listen to records and play
the riff over and over," he recalled.

"And now I don't know what I'd
do if I wasn't a professional musi
cian. I'd be involved in music one
way or another. You know, I'm a
lifer," Lewis said.
In keeping with their recurring
vampire theme, LA. Guns also
credits author Anne Rice for having
an impact on their music as well.
"Toward the end of last year, we
played in New Orleans for the very
first time and I got to meet her,"
Lewis said. "It was absolutely
incredible."
To show their gratitude for
Rice's inspiration, LA Guns pre
sented the author with a special
plaque that represented all three of
the band's gold records.
"That was probably the highlight
of last year. She told me they were
thinking of making a movie of [one
of her books], and she said I'd be
perfect for the part of Louis," Lewis
said, his smooth British accent
breaking in adolescent excitement.
Lewis, no matter how ghoulish
and vampiric, is an optimist at heart.
"The thing to do is be charming,"
he remarked. "And ifyou have a good
attitude, people will generally accept
you. I'd like everybody to know about
LA Guns and decide from there."

L_A. Guns begins their tour this
week, bringing them to Petaluma's
Phoenix Theatre on March 1.
