# I've got your mail right here, buddy
## 
### 
You can only ignore your
friends and family for so
long, slothful ones. After
a while, they'll creep up on you
like boxers at the end of a long
lecture.
And we all know how painful
that can be.
The quarter is halfway over,
and odds are you haven't mailed
a single letter since winter
break. Well, there was that one
thing you sent to be a member
of the studio audience of
"Grudge Match," but that was
only a postcard. I'm talking let
ters.
Listen, I understand that
you're busy. You've got impor
tant things to do — like playing
foozball and deciphering the
dirty parts of "A Woman's
Guide to Stanford."
But not me. I've got all the
time in the world. No pesky
women knocking down my door,
trying to monopolize all my
time. No sir. I've got time to kill.
So I'm going to save your
bony little asses. Because if you
don't send something soon,
you'll wind up staying at cheap
motels when you drive across
the country someday. Alone.
Yes, once again I've swooped
down to save you, to rescue you
from the pit of despair, like
Prometheus bringing home
baked goods down from the
mountains.
All you have to do is clip it
out and make sure you address
the envelope correctly.
God, I admire myself.

I Dear ,
Sometimes, when I'm at that really special point just before I •
fall asleep, a big picture of your face appears. Then I bolt straight
upright in my lofted bed and slam my head against the ceiling.
I I feel older than since the last time we spoke. Kind of like that |
I Andrea-on-90210 age warp thing. Not quite mature, not quite I
ready to give away that "Am I Normal?" book my mom bought
me, but older nonetheless.
It's been raining all the time. Not that inconclusive drizzle
I stuff. I'm talking real rain. Manly rain. The kind of rain that |
reminds me of the time Skippy got a little too excited about climb- I
ing the flag pole.
And it makes me think. It makes me think about who's really
I important to me — who would be there if I suddenly gained a lot |
I of weight. And one person came to my mind, and he was wearing l
those tight little running shorts.
But after Richard Simmons came and went, I thought of you.
Even though we don't talk much, I still feel like you're there for |
I me, and that you'd loan me money and let me date your siblings |
I if I wanted to. That's a good feeling. A really good feeling. I
And what more can you ask from life? Maybe a couple thou
sand dollars and oral sex that will make your partner lisp for the
rest of their life, but those are really extras. Basically you just |
I want someone who'll always be there to loan you money and let |
I you date their siblings. I
Write back, and if you make cookies, remember to send them
three-day express.
I Your dutiful servant, I

Well, there you have it. It
may not be the best letter
you ever sent, but at
least there are no spelling errors.
But for now you can sit back
and rest content in the fact that
your loved ones will receive mail.
Real mail. They're probably
thrilled just to receive the Victo
ria's Secret catalog, so imagine
what this one will do. Maybe not,
but at least they won't have to
damage their psyches fantasizing
about being Harry Connick Jr.
And before you know it, you'll
be getting generic mail right back
into your very own P.O. Box. And
I know how much that will mean,
now that Tom Campbell has more
important people to write to.
So toss this puppy in the mail
before spring break comes along
and you find yourself cleaning
highways for a week just to get
your name on one of those annoy
ing signs. But then again, what
else are you going to put on a
resume — dorm president?
The important thing is to stay
in touch with the folks from your
past — because if you don't,
you'll wind up all alone some
where with a half-empty bottle of
Night Train Express, wishing,
you'd just sent one lousy letter.
And you certainly couldn't
blame me, could you?

Joel Stein, for all he knows,
might have been a really good
bobsledder. His column appears
here to give meaning to an other
wise meaningless existence — not
his, you idiot, yours.
