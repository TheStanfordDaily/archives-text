# For Clapton, pain is powerful
## 
### Val Masters 
Heartbreak and pain induce
powerful music — especially in
Eric Clapton.
Last March, Clapton's four
year-old son Connor was tragi
cally killed when he fell from an
open window in his mother's
Manhattan high-rise. In a life
already well-chronicled with the
deaths of friends and associates,
the death of his only son seemed
another unbelievably nightmar
ish chapter in Clapton's bitter
sweet life.
Yet unlike departed friends
and peers, among them guitar
legends like Jimi Hendrix,
Duane Allman and Stevie Ray
Vaughan, Clapton has survived
the turmoil of the last three
decades and translated many of
his personal misfortunes into
music.
On the soundtrack to the
recent motion picture "Rush,"
Clapton has composed a haunt
ing and melancholy original
score that aches from his latest
tragedy, while still managing to
glimmer with the hope and spir
it of a survivor. It's easily the
guitarist's best album in years.
Unlike his last album, the

large flaccid live affair entitled
"24 Nights," and most of his ten
studio albums since 1974's "461
Ocean Blvd," the "Rush" sound
track breathes with real feeling
and relies heavily on Clapton's
once-pure blues playing. Felt
and heard as a journey through
the darkest pain and uncertain
ty, the album's cathartic song
cycle succeeds on an emotional
level where the film fails.
Except for the last three
tracks, the album is all instru
mental and doesn't bury Clap
ton's guitar with a wall of
orchestration like the previous
soundtrack efforts "Lethal
Weapon" and the BBC-televised
"Edge of Darkness." This is
Clapton stripped down and free
from the restraints of the empty
pop formula he's fallen back on
in recent years.
The album flows effortlessly
from one song to the next, tak
ing the listener through a vari
ety of tonal moods without ever
sounding monotonous. "Tracks
and Lines," with its bubbling
organ and simmering guitar,
flows into the coiled and angry
rattlesnake bite of "Realization"

and then drifts back into a spare and
quiet ballad entitled "Kristen and
Jim."
While "Preludin Fugue" and
"Cold Turkey" burst urgently at the
seams with fierce and angry playing,
the ominous "Will Gaines" is simply
cold and nightmarish, with Clapton's
guitar screaming above some rare
orchestration to sound like something
from soundtrack to "The Thing."
In a recent interview Clapton said
that this year he planned to record
an album full of songs about his son,
and two of the three vocal perfor
mances on this album are obviously
cut from that cloth. Both "Help Me
Up" and "Tears in Heaven," which
is receiving heavy air play, evoke the

heavens with plaintive cries for help
and strength.
The simple, Robert Cray-like
fmesse of "Help Me Up" and the ten
der vocal turn and Dobro playing on
"Tears in Heaven" stand out as two
of his finest compositions since any
thing on 1983's "Money and
Cigarettes" album. Despite the qual
ity of these two songs, it's the sound
track's third vocal performance that
simply outclasses the other two.
Returning a favor for Clapton's
appearance on his superb "Damn
Right, I've Got the Blues" album
from last year, guitar legend Buddy
Guy shows why he's the last of the
great Chicago blues man on the late
Willie Dixon's "Don't Know Which
Way to Go." Singing in his raw and
inimitable voice, Guy sings and
trades a steady stream of guitar licks
with Clapton and generally shows
the listener how much Clapton's
guitar playing owes to Guy's.

Neither guitarist ever misses or
wastes a note on "Don't Know
Which Way to Go," and even at near
ly 11 minutes this slow-burning
blues classic seems short — especial
ly when you can hear them fade the
song during another one of Guy's
exquisite solos. There's probably ten
more minutes to this one on the stu
dio floor.
All told, the soundtrack to
"Rush" doesn't have anywhere near
the raw, bleeding intensity of the
"Layla" album, but the album's
arresting texture and Clapton's ten
sion-filled playing are indicative of a
man filled with varied and conflict
ing emotions.
Clapton himself summed up his
recent playing in this months Musi
cian magazine: "I've been playing
very, very quietly so if I hit a note
and hold it with vibrato, you can
hear it sizzling against the fret."
The man's not kidding.
