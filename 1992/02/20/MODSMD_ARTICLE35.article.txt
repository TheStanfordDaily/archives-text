# For Clapton, pain is powerful
## 
### Val Masters 
Heartbreak and pain induce
powerful music â€” especially in
Eric Clapton.
Last March, Clapton's four
year-old son Connor was tragi
cally killed when he fell from an
open window in his mother's
Manhattan high-rise. In a life
already well-chronicled with the
deaths of friends and associates,
the death of his only son seemed
another unbelievably nightmar
ish chapter in Clapton's bitter
sweet life.
Yet unlike departed friends
and peers, among them guitar
legends like Jimi Hendrix,
Duane Allman and Stevie Ray
Vaughan, Clapton has survived
the turmoil of the last three
decades and translated many of
his personal misfortunes into
music.
On the soundtrack to the
recent motion picture "Rush,"
Clapton has composed a haunt
ing and melancholy original
score that aches from his latest
tragedy, while still managing to
glimmer with the hope and spir
it of a survivor. It's easily the
guitarist's best album in years.
Unlike his last album, the

large flaccid live affair entitled
"24 Nights," and most of his ten
studio albums since 1974's "461
Ocean Blvd," the "Rush" sound
track breathes with real feeling
and relies heavily on Clapton's
once-pure blues playing. Felt
and heard as a journey through
the darkest pain and uncertain
ty, the album's cathartic song
cycle succeeds on an emotional
level where the film fails.
Except for the last three
tracks, the album is all instru
mental and doesn't bury Clap
ton's guitar with a wall of
orchestration like the previous
soundtrack efforts "Lethal
Weapon" and the BBC-televised
"Edge of Darkness." This is
Clapton stripped down and free
from the restraints of the empty
pop formula he's fallen back on
in recent years.
The album flows effortlessly
from one song to the next, tak
ing the listener through a vari
ety of tonal moods without ever
sounding monotonous. "Tracks
and Lines," with its bubbling
organ and simmering guitar,
flows into the coiled and angry
rattlesnake bite of "Realization"
