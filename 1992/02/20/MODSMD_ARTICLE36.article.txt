# Blandness crashes 'Radio Flyer'

Take two cute little boys, a dog and lots of open
space for adventures, and you'll have a great movie.
At least, that's what Richard Donner thought when
he made his latest film, "Radio Flyer," but the reality
is that these elements aren't enough to make a good
movie.
Mikey (Elijah Wood) and Bobby (Joseph Mazello)
travel to California with their mother (Lorraine Brac
co) alter their father abandons them. When the moth
er gets remarried, they move to the suburbs.
Sounds pretty boring, right?
It is. So to make it more interesting, and to give it a
serious tone, the stepfather is a drunkard who batters
little Bobby.
The Issue of abuse is presented from the child's point
of view, and although there is no physical violence on
screen, Bobby's psychological conflict is there.

To protect his younger brother, Mikey decides the
best tactic is to be out of the house until sundown, and
so the boys set out on expeditions around their neigh
borhood.
The children enjoy themselves using their imagina
tion. This is the movie's lesson No. 1: back in the late
'60s, when the movie takes place, the imagination
killer (i.e. the video game) hadn't arrived yet.
The best thing by far in the film is the relationship
between the two brothers. Love, trust and all those
secrets shared only by siblings are very well achieved
by Donner. Their acting is superb and definitely the
highlight of the film.
Bracco plays her part as the mother fairly well,
although it certainly won't get her any awards or rave
reviews.
Overall, the movie accomplishes what it sets out to
do: get some laughs, some tears and a final feel-good
mood. It's perfect for taking out your little cousin, or
maybe even your grandmother.

Despite all of the cuteness, "Radio Flyer" has no substance.
