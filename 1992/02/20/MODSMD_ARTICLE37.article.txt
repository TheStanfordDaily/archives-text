# 'Mindwalk' trips on dialogue
## 
### Brad Bruner Staff writer 
Imagine three people sitting on the turret of a
French castle, talking. Imagine them on the beach
near that dreamlike castle, talking and exploring one
another's minds. Imagine them now in a torture
chamber, ignoring all normal cinematic impulses
toward murder or lewd behavior, still simply talking.
"Mindwalk" is a film that unabashedly centers on
the almost forgotten artistic exploit of exploring
ideas.
Though the average viewer may have problems
sitting through this barrage of ideas with little
movement, this movie is worthwhile for those who
like to experience an uncommon implementation of
the medium. Unfortunately, cinema does not seem
to be the correct medium for such an in-depth
undertaking.
Disillusioned physicist Sonia Hoffman (Liv Ull
man) has left her research position to come to this
remote part of France to sort through her ideas and
to elaborate a new doctrine of "ecological thought"
to counter Descartes' "mechanistic view."
Presidential wanna-be Jack Edwards (Sam

Waterston) has just lost a campaign and feels
exploited and unsure about the political establish
ment. His friend and ex-campaign writer Thomas
Harriman (John Heard) is now a poet in self
imposed exile here in France.
After randomly meeting at the picturesque Mont-
St. Michel castle on the Western French coast, they
launch into a conversation that ranges from the dis
services we are doing to future generations to the
theory of light and particles to the development of a
"politics of the impossible."
It's difficult to imagine that a movie focusing on
a Platonic dialogue between three intellectuals
would not be somewhat pretentious.
Often the characters, especially the physicist,
become very loaded down with their didactic rantings.
In these cases we suddenly get the feeling of sitting in
on a lecture rather than watching three people inter
act. In the end, the film comes off more as a PC
"Breakfast Club" for the ecological movement than a
rediscovered intellectual current of filmmaking.
Such a valiant attempt at transforming an intellec
tual exercise into a package suitable for the big screen
is a very formidable task, and one to be applauded
even if the product here is not altogether successful.
