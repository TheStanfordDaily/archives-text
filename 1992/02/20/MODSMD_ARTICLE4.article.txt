# People's Platform may not nominate Presidents slate

People's Platform is unlikely to
nominate a Council of Presidents
slate in this year's ASSU election
because of an identity crisis with
in the party, members said.
"There will not be a party
endorsed COP slate," said party
member Mae Lee, who ran on the
People's Platform slate "Stand
and Deliver" last year.
"But I think people or groups
may individually or collectively
support an [independent] COP
slate," she said.
Another People's Platform
member, sophomore Allyson
Dickson, confirmed that the party
will probably not nominate a slate.
"We won't be running a COP
slate, more than likely," she said.
Dickson, who is also vice chair
of the Black Student Union,
added, "Right now we're going
through some restructuring, and
right now it's pretty tenuous. A
lot of people are just really dis

couraged because of PC and the
backlash" against ideologies
which have been called politically
correct, she said.
People's Platform COP nomi
nees received about 36 percent of
the vote in last spring's runoff
election, after four consecutive
years of victories for the party.
Its ASSU Senate nominees
won 14 of the senate's 40 seats
after commanding a majority of
the seats the year before.
Dickson said members are also
questioning whether People's
Platform will continue to be an
organized political party at all.
She said the group may become
more like "friends helping each
other out."
John Louie, a member of the
Students First COP slate that
ended People's Platform's string
of COP victories last spring, said
the lack of a People's Platform
slate will not change the April 15
ASSU election significantly.
