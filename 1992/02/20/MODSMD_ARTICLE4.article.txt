# People's Platform may not nominate Presidents slate
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
People's Platform is unlikely to
nominate a Council of Presidents
slate in this year's ASSU election
because of an identity crisis with
in the party, members said.
"There will not be a party
endorsed COP slate," said party
member Mae Lee, who ran on the
People's Platform slate "Stand
and Deliver" last year.
"But I think people or groups
may individually or collectively
support an [independent] COP
slate," she said.
Another People's Platform
member, sophomore Allyson
Dickson, confirmed that the party
will probably not nominate a slate.
"We won't be running a COP
slate, more than likely," she said.
Dickson, who is also vice chair
of the Black Student Union,
added, "Right now we're going
through some restructuring, and
right now it's pretty tenuous. A
lot of people are just really dis

couraged because of PC and the
backlash" against ideologies
which have been called politically
correct, she said.
People's Platform COP nomi
nees received about 36 percent of
the vote in last spring's runoff
election, after four consecutive
years of victories for the party.
Its ASSU Senate nominees
won 14 of the senate's 40 seats
after commanding a majority of
the seats the year before.
Dickson said members are also
questioning whether People's
Platform will continue to be an
organized political party at all.
She said the group may become
more like "friends helping each
other out."
John Louie, a member of the
Students First COP slate that
ended People's Platform's string
of COP victories last spring, said
the lack of a People's Platform
slate will not change the April 15
ASSU election significantly.
"The fact that one political
party isn't here won't affect
things that much" because other
slates will fill the gap, he said.
People's Platform members
traced the party's problem to its
background. People's Platform was
formed five years ago by members
of four campus minority groups:
the Asian American Student Asso
ciation, the Black Student Union,
the Stanford American Indian
Organization and MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student group.
Since that time, the party has
fought for "the representation of
people of color explicitly on cam
pus," said Jennifer Pearson, who
also ran on the People's Platform
slate last year.
Such advocacy included cam
paigns for the Cultures, Ideas and
Values program and for additional
distribution requirements focus
ing on ethnic and gender studies.
Dickson said the party's ori
gins and past actions may have
projected the image of a party that
served only minorities. That per
ception, she said, may have lost
the party some student support.
"Regardless of what it really
was, it was conveyed as this party
of students of color," she said.
Pearson said the party has
been trying to include students of
all races.
But the broadening of the coali
tion was not sweeping enough to
prevent the party's current prob
lems, Pearson said.
"You can't create a coalition
party without a coalition," she
said. "You can't create a move
ment from the top down. It has to
come from the grass roots up."
Lee said the party doesn't have
the time to launch a full-scale
COP campaign while struggling to
broaden its student support base.
