# With little 'payback' left, Biddle departs
## Charges made, only litigation remains 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Paul Biddle admits he may be a
man who has outlived his useful
ness at Stanford.
"I resigned now because the
issue has become one of litigation"
between Stanford and the Navy,
Biddle said in a press conference
last week to announce his resigna
tion and likely bid for Congress.
"At this point in time, the payback
for Paul Biddle remaining is not
as great as it has been in the past."
The on-campus Navy regulator
has led a crusade against Stan
ford's indirect-cost practices and
helped to spur similar investiga
tions at universities nationwide.
But his aggressive tactics have
often sparked criticism from both
Stanford and his superiors, and
have recently turned much of the
local media against him.
As Biddle resigns at the end of
this month, he leaves Stanford
with a massive budget deficit and
significant financial questions
which will remain unanswered
for several years.
But, for a man who has often
sought the media limelight, there

does not appear to
be much more for
him to expose.
The yachts and

have already been discovered. Bid
die has repeated his allegations
that Stanford overbilled the gov
ernment by $480 million during
the 1980s more times than most at
the Farm care to remember:
For Stanford and the Navy, the
controversy has shifted to one of
litigation and negotiation over
past and future indirect-cost rates
— not the things Biddle says he
would like to dedicate his time to.
Negotiations will be easier
Although no one involved in
the negotiations will say they are
happy to see Biddle leave, both
sides privately breathed a sigh of
relief last week when he officially
announced his resignation.
Many faculty members, how
ever, are more than willing to say
they are happy to see Biddle's
impending departure.

ies to hone his pool skills on one of the three tables in the Tresidder Union recreation center.
Prof. Robert Simoni said. "He
was here in the most blatant con
flict-of-interest situation imagin
able."
University administrators are
tired of dealing with Biddle's
often unsubstantiated allega
tions, and they will be relieved to
see a new regulator who is less
eager to talk to the media.
Biddle's bosses in the Navy are
not happy with him, either. One
official said several weeks ago
that Biddle has his own agenda —
one not necessarily in line with
the Navy's wishes.
And Biddle readily acknowl
edges that he has disobeyed the
wishes of his superiors when dis
satisfied with the Navy's appar
ent lack of progress in investigat
ing his complaints.
Biddle's departure can only
make resolving the conflict a sim
pler task for everyone involved.
Although no one claims that
Biddle has hindered rate negotia
tions for future years, little
progress has been made on the
issue in recent months, and the
University's outlook is not posi
tive.
University President Donald
Kennedy gave a somber report to

the Faculty Senate last week,
relaying concerns about future
indirect-cost rates, graduate stu
dent tuition remission and Bid
die's allegations about past over
billing.
"We are not going to have com
plete confidence in anything"
unless the government's appeals
board rules in Stanford's favor,
Kennedy told the senate.
With Biddle leaving, the self
proclaimed "pebble in the shoe"
will lose much of his input into
Stanford's indirect-cost contro
versy.
Or will he?
Biddle sues Stanford
Biddle's impending qui tam
suit remains under seal by the
Department of Justice, and nei
ther he nor other government
officials will comment on it.
But when the suit is finally
unveiled — probably some time in
the spring — Biddle and his attor
neys will likely be allowed to
search many of Stanford's finan
cial records in an attempt to prove
his allegations of $480 million in
overbilling.
The University is arguing that
Biddle continues to have a conflict
of interest, as the qui tam suit
compromises his role as a regula
tor.
Biddle, of course, denies any
conflict, while the Navy only

"continues to review" the Univer
sity's request that he be removed
immediately.
With Biddle's resignation
scheduled for the end of the
month, it is doubtful the Navy
will remove him earlier. But Uni
versity officials suggest they may
still challenge Biddle's actions,
claiming some may have been
tainted by the alleged conflict of
interest because the suit was filed
last October.
Much to the regret of Stanford
officials, Biddle's departure does
not require him to cut off his
tongue. With a campaign on the
Peninsula for the Stanford con
gressional seat, he will find plenty
of occasions to comment on indi
rect costs as well as other local
issues.
"Certainly, with Paul Biddle in
the race, he will raise the issue of
Stanford often," said Bob Marks,
campaign manager for Tom
Huening, the current Republican
front-runner. "For now at least, it
may be Paul Biddle's only issue."
With two weeks left before his
resignation takes effect, Biddle
will have a last opportunity to add
to his previous allegations.
Although he realizes that his
oversight role at Stanford has just
about come to an end, he probably
will not resist another opportuni
ty to grab a few headlines and aid
his still unofficial campaign.

pler task for everyone involved.
Although no one claims that
Biddle has hindered rate negotia
tions for future years, little
progress has been made on the
issue in recent months, and the
University's outlook is not posi
tive.
University President Donald
Kennedy gave a somber report to

the Faculty Senate last week,
relaying concerns about future
indirect-cost rates, graduate stu
dent tuition remission and Bid
die's allegations about past over
billing.
"We are not going to have com
plete confidence in anything"
unless the government's appeals
board rules in Stanford's favor,
Kennedy told the senate.
With Biddle leaving, the self
proclaimed "pebble in the shoe"
will lose much of his input into
Stanford's indirect-cost contro
versy.
Or will he?
Biddle sues Stanford
Biddle's impending qui tam
suit remains under seal by the
Department of Justice, and nei
ther he nor other government
officials will comment on it.
But when the suit is finally
unveiled — probably some time in
the spring — Biddle and his attor
neys will likely be allowed to
search many of Stanford's finan
cial records in an attempt to prove
his allegations of $480 million in
overbilling.
The University is arguing that
Biddle continues to have a conflict
of interest, as the qui tam suit
compromises his role as a regula
tor.
Biddle, of course, denies any
conflict, while the Navy only

"continues to review" the Univer
sity's request that he be removed
immediately.
With Biddle's resignation
scheduled for the end of the
month, it is doubtful the Navy
will remove him earlier. But Uni
versity officials suggest they may
still challenge Biddle's actions,
claiming some may have been
tainted by the alleged conflict of
interest because the suit was filed
last October.
Much to the regret of Stanford
officials, Biddle's departure does
not require him to cut off his
tongue. With a campaign on the
Peninsula for the Stanford con
gressional seat, he will find plenty
of occasions to comment on indi
rect costs as well as other local
issues.
"Certainly, with Paul Biddle in
the race, he will raise the issue of
Stanford often," said Bob Marks,
campaign manager for Tom
Huening, the current Republican
front-runner. "For now at least, it
may be Paul Biddle's only issue."
With two weeks left before his
resignation takes effect, Biddle
will have a last opportunity to add
to his previous allegations.
Although he realizes that his
oversight role at Stanford has just
about come to an end, he probably
will not resist another opportuni
ty to grab a few headlines and aid
his still unofficial campaign.
Paul Biddle admits he may be a
man who has outlived his useful
ness at Stanford.
"I resigned now because the
issue has become one of litigation"
between Stanford and the Navy,
Biddle said in a press conference
last week to announce his resigna
tion and likely bid for Congress.
"At this point in time, the payback
for Paul Biddle remaining is not
as great as it has been in the past."
The on-campus Navy regulator
has led a crusade against Stan
ford's indirect-cost practices and
helped to spur similar investiga
tions at universities nationwide.
But his aggressive tactics have
often sparked criticism from both
Stanford and his superiors, and
have recently turned much of the
local media against him.
As Biddle resigns at the end of
this month, he leaves Stanford
with a massive budget deficit and
significant financial questions
which will remain unanswered
for several years.
But, for a man who has often
sought the media limelight, there

does not appear to
be much more for

have already been discovered. Bid

that Stanford overbilled the gov

the 1980s more times than most at

For Stanford and the Navy, the
controversy has shifted to one of
litigation and negotiation over
past and future indirect-cost rates
— not the things Biddle says he
would like to dedicate his time to.
Negotiations will be easier
Although no one involved in
the negotiations will say they are
happy to see Biddle leave, both
sides privately breathed a sigh of
relief last week when he officially
announced his resignation.
Many faculty members, how
ever, are more than willing to say
they are happy to see Biddle's
impending departure.

tired of dealing with Biddle's
