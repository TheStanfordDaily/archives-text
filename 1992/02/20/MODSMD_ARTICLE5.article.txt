# With little 'payback' left, Biddle departs
## Charges made, only litigation remains 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Paul Biddle admits he may be a
man who has outlived his useful
ness at Stanford.
"I resigned now because the
issue has become one of litigation"
between Stanford and the Navy,
Biddle said in a press conference
last week to announce his resigna

"At this point in time, the payback

litigation and negotiation over
past and future indirect-cost rates
— not the things Biddle says he
would like to dedicate his time to.
Negotiations will be easier
Although no one involved in
the negotiations will say they are
happy to see Biddle leave, both
sides privately breathed a sigh of
relief last week when he officially
announced his resignation.
Many faculty members, how
ever, are more than willing to say
they are happy to see Biddle's
impending departure.

him leave. He's a jerk," Biology
