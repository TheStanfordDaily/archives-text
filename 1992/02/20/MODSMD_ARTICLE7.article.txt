# ISC adopts tougher Rush rules
## Sororities told to leave frosh alone until spring 
### Leigh Burnside Staff writer 
The Intersorority Council
approved a new set of pre-Rush
rules last night which will go into
effect immediately, ISC President
Adriana Duffy said.
The rules specifically prohibit
"inviting freshmen to sorority
events intended only for sorority
members" and "inviting fresh
men to sponsored or co-sponsored
closed events."
The new guidelines state that
"Rush does not begin at Stanford
until spring quarter" and that
sororities must "refrain from
rushing freshman women until
the formal Rush period."
Delta Delta Delta President
Kaiyn Goodman expressed support
of the guidelines, saying, "I think

these rules are really just.... The
ISC has gotten its act together."
ISC Rush co-chair Sheryl
Spain said, "We're basically
spelling out a philosophy that
already existed that Rush doesn't
start until spring quarter."
The rules are less severe than a
previously proposed set which the
chapters rejected earlier this
quarter. The earlier rules were
rejected because they "went too
far," according to Duffy, and
"ruled out things (which are) not
really a problem," such as placing
individual freshmen on the guest
list for open campus parties.
The rules were proposed in
response to a complaint filed
against the Pi Beta Phi sorority ear
lier this year for inviting freshman
women to an off-campus social
event, according to Goodman.

Duffy confirmed that the ISC
had filed an incident report
against the Pi Phis on January
24, but ISC judicial board mem
ber Aimee Meisenzahl would not
comment on the details of the
incident, saying the affair was
"not for public knowledge."
Duffy said the new set of rules
has "more of an honor system
philosophy," much like the one
used by the University, and
encourages the sororities to
report violations to the ISC.
The rules state that violations
of the new guidelines will result in
the filing of an incident report to
the ISC "and, if necessary, the
judicial board."
If a violation is found to have
occurred, the implicated sorority
must then pay the fmes established
by the ISC's Rush violation policies.
