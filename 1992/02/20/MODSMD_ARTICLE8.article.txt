### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
More than 30 students, colleagues and friends
yesterday remembered Freshman English lecturer
Arthur Hall as an enthusiastic teacher and caring
friend who always kept a positive outlook — even as
he battled AIDS.
Hall, 43, died Jan. 3 of AIDS-related complications.
In addition to teaching Freshman English for the past
12 years, Hall taught staff development courses and
worked at the Center for Teaching and Learning
while pursuing a graduate degree in education.
People who attended a memorial service yester
day in Tresidder Union said that while Hall strug
gled against his disease and had to cope with the
AIDS-related death of his partner, he still managed
to put others before himself.
"He was about the most selfless person that I've
ever known," said Nora Bacon, a fellow Freshman
English lecturer. She said she would remember Hall
for "how unfailingly kind he could be."

CTL Director Michele Marincovich shared similar
recollections of Hall, emphasizing "the incredibly pos
itive tone he had about everything in life."
She said Hall was "full of courage and optimism" in
the face of death and "was willing to talk about what
lay ahead for him, about the fact that he knew he was
dying."
Several of Hall's former students recalled his
enthusiasm and dedication as both teacher and
friend.
As a teacher, Hall "was really encouraging," junior
Chayo Ureno said. At the same time, she added, "He
really cared about you as an individual. ... He shared
so much of himself to make you feel better."
"He was so dedicated, warm and friendly - just a
good friend to all his students," senior Debbie Koven
said. "Arthur was there for everyone."
For Ureno, Hall's death puts a face on AIDS,
which remains a very impersonal disease for many
students.
"He was the first person close to me who's died of
AIDS," she said.
