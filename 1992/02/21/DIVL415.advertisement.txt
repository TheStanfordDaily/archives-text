RAY YOU TO DO
PUBLIC SERVICE!
Stanford alumni want to help you make a difference! Nine
alumni clubs have volunteered to sponsor Stanford students
to work in public service agencies for eight weeks this sum
mer. In addition to providing a valuable learning opportunity
for students and helping their own communities,
the clubs will provide the student
with housing and a $1500 stipend!
An informational meeting will be
held at Bowman Alumni House
on Tuesday, February 25, at
4 p.m. Some of last year's fel
lows will be on hand to share
their experiences, and re
freshments will be provided.
Applications and detailed informa
tion are available in the lobby of Bowman
Alumni House. For more information about the
Stanford Club Summer Fellowship Program, call the
Stanford Alumni Association at 723-2021 or 725-0684.
