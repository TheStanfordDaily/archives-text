Winnie the Pooh and Woodsy
the Owl went on the offensive in
White Plaza yesterday morning
to make students aware of poten
tial changes in the Endangered
Species Act.
Two students dressed up on
behalf of Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford and
asked people to sign petitions
urging senators and representa
tives to renew the legislation
without weakening it.
Woodsy represented the spot
ted owl, which is threatened by
timber harvesting in Oregon.
Winnie the Pooh was supposed to
be a symbol for the grizzly bear,
which is also endangered.
The two animals were not the
group's first choice. "We couldn't
get the Tree from the band, and
the eagle costumes from the Cos
tume Department were too mean
looking," said SEAS member
Abdi Soltani, who wore the bear
costume and organized the event.
"So we settled for Winnie. At
least he's cute."
"We had a lot bigger response
than I expected," said freshman
Greg Siegel, who dressed up as
Woodsy. "I know that if I were
approached by an owl, I wouldn't
be too responsive."
Siegel and Soltani said they
will be in White Plaza again today.
The Endangered Species Act is
up for renewal by Congress this
year, and two bills have been pro
posed to change it.
