# Activists dress up to save animals

Winnie the Pooh and Woodsy
the Owl went on the offensive in
White Plaza yesterday morning
to make students aware of poten
tial changes in the Endangered
Species Act.
Two students dressed up on
behalf of Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford and
asked people to sign petitions
urging senators and representa
tives to renew the legislation
without weakening it.
Woodsy represented the spot
ted owl, which is threatened by
timber harvesting in Oregon.
Winnie the Pooh was supposed to
be a symbol for the grizzly bear,
which is also endangered.
The two animals were not the
group's first choice. "We couldn't
get the Tree from the band, and
the eagle costumes from the Cos
tume Department were too mean
looking," said SEAS member
Abdi Soltani, who wore the bear
costume and organized the event.
"So we settled for Winnie. At
least he's cute."
"We had a lot bigger response
than I expected," said freshman
Greg Siegel, who dressed up as
Woodsy. "I know that if I were
approached by an owl, I wouldn't
be too responsive."
Siegel and Soltani said they
will be in White Plaza again today.
The Endangered Species Act is
up for renewal by Congress this
year, and two bills have been pro
posed to change it.
One would reduce the number
of animals on the endangered
species list. The second bill would
strengthen the act, but Soltani
said it has many loopholes.
For example, if an environ
mental group sues a government
agency over a project that threat
ens an endangered species, the
suit will automatically be delayed
60 days, during which the project
can continue, Soltani said.
"There is much pressure from
the government and from large
industries to undermine the act,"
he added.
SEAS is organizing a letter
writing campaign to senators and
representatives. Members are also
sending postcards to the Endan
gered Species Committee, which
decides what species are protected.

Helping in the campaign are
dormitory environmental repre
sentatives, including freshman
Lara Kueppers, Rinconada's rep
resentative.
"We are really trying to per
suade senators and representa
tives to vote against weakening
the bill," Kueppers said. "We did
really well last quarter, and I hope
to do equally well this quarter."
"The response was amazing,"
said sophomore Seth Spalding,
the French House environmental
representative. "I think it's great
that people are becoming aware of
what the legislature is doing. It's
important for people to know
what an impact they can have."
According to Catherine Eng
berg, the Branner representative,
"a lot of people were influenced to
write again this quarter" because
they received letters from sena
tors and congressmen.
"I think it will have a great
impact," she said.
