Domino's and Round Table
may now be facing a tough new
competitor â€” Kimball Hall.
Students say Kimball's new
late night pizza operation, which
opened last week, is a welcome
change from ordering from off
campus establishments. The ser
vice allows students to purchase
pizzas with their meal card points
between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. Sun
days through Thursdays.
"It seems like a real pizza ser
vice," said junior Teddy Johnson,
a resident assistant at Kimball,
adding that Kimball's offering "is
not cardboard crusted like Domi
no's.
"It's not especially greasy, but
they maintain some of the greasy
appearance, so it feels like real
college pizza," he said.
Sophomore Mina Satoyoshi,
another Kimball resident, dis
agreed. She said she thinks Kim
ball's daytime pizza is better.
"But at one in the morning, it
doesn't matter," she added.
According to Sheila Wagner,
assistant manager of food service,
Late Night Pizza has been a suc
cessful program so far. "We've
had a pretty good response," she
said, adding that 100 people came
on the opening night, and 150
patronized the new service the
second night.

Several students agreed that
Kimball's prices, wljich range
from $1.75 for a slice to $12 for a
large pizza, are reasonable.
Eleven toppings, including mush
rooms, pineapple and jalapeno
peppers, are available for an extra
charge.
Students also said they were
glad to have a place to get food on
campus during the wee hours.
Previously, Stern Hall's food ser
vice was open latest, serving such
fare as hamburgers, french fries
and cookies until 10 p.m.
"Stern closes just when you're
starting to get hungry," Kimball
resident Sacha Henchman said.
Some students, however, said
they feared running out of food
points because of the late-night
pizza service.
"It's kind of a Catch-22,"
Henchman said. "At the same
time they're raising prices,
they're expanding their hours."
But freshman Prashant Shah,
a Donner resident, said the pizza
is worth the money. "I didn't
think it would be that good,"
Shah said. His only complaint
about the new service is that it
doesn't deliver.
Senior Terry Lee, Resident
Computer Coordinator at Don
ner, said he thinks Kimball's
pizza is better and cheaper than
Domino's.
"Domino's is bummed, basical
ly," he said.
