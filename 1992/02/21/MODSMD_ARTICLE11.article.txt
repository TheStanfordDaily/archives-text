# Insurance for domestic partners on hold
## Cowell program still needs state approval 
### John Ford Staff writer 
Domestic partners of Stanford students
may have to wait until fall for health insur
ance coverage through Cowell Student Health
Center, although the plan was originally
scheduled to take effect this quarter.
Consumers United, the insurance carrier
that Stanford has chosen, is still waiting for
approval fVom the state of California before it
can cover domestic partners at Cowell.
Domestic partners, same-sex and opposite
sex couples who have been in a relationship
for more than one year, gained housing and

other rights last year at Stanford. The part
ners receive spouse cards and access to Uni
versity facilities, and can be treated at Cowell
on a fee-for-service basis.
Consumers United was one of the few
insurance companies willing to provide insur
ance to domestic partners, according to Direc
tor of Student Health Services Harvey Wein
stein.
Weinstein added that many insurance com
panies won't cover domestic partners because
they fear paying costs for AIDS patients.
The states' commission on insurance has
yet to determine that Consumers United has
the adequate "resources to meet the needs of

health claims" of the domestic partners, Wein
stein said.
He said he believes that approval is just a
"matter of time," but coverage probably won't
come until the fall.
Weinstein said last October that Cowell
hoped the state would approve Consumers
United in time for winter quarter.
The domestic partners policy was imple
mented Oct. 9, 1990. The decision, whose pro
ponents included members of the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Center, caused
some controversy over whether unmarried
couples would displace married couples from
on-campus housing.
But University officials said during spring
quarter that spaces where available for every
one who requested housing.
