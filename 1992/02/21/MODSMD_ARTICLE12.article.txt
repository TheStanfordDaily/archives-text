A very special casserole
An oven fire broke out at Synergy House last night, but resi
dents put it out immediately and no one was hurt.
A dish towel that was accidentally left in a gas oven caught fire
when a student turned the oven on to preheat it for dinner,
according to resident Theo Emory.
Because the fire extinguisher did not work, residents picked up
the burning towel with a pair of tongs, put it in a bowl and cov
ered it, resident Jen Fox said.
The smoke did not set off the fire alarm, but two fire engines
came when residents called 911 for help.
Dinner — a special Synergy casserole — went on as usual. One
firefighter on his way back to his truck said, "I wish I were hav
ing what they're having."
