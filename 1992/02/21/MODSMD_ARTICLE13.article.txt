Panel votes to allow breast implants
BETHESDA, Md. (AP) — A federal advisory committee today
voted to allow further use of silicone gel breast implants but
weighed whether to restrict who may receive them.
The Food and Drug Administration panel concluded that there
was no compelling scientific evidence that the implants could
cause disease. It said more study was needed but sought to reas
sure women who have the implants.
The nine committee members voted unanimously not to bar
further use of the implants.
The devices have been voluntarily taken off the market
because of fears they may cause health problems ranging from
mild fatigue to autoimmune diseases.
The panel then debated proposals that use of the implants be
restricted.
Two of the proposed restrictions would limit the types of
patients who would be eligible to receive the devices. The
implants are used by women who lost breasts to cancer and by
women who want to enlarge their breasts.
Siamese twins inseparable, docs say
PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Siamese twins joined at the head
and facing the opposite direction share a large amount of brain
tissue and can't be separated, doctors said yesterday.
The male twins, weighing 12 pounds and 14 ounces, were born
Tuesday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. They will undergo
neurological tests before being sent home in a few days, officials said.
The twins, who appear otherwise healthy and normal, also
share a large portion of the brain's blood vessels, said Dr. Alan
Spitzer, a neonatalogist at Thomas Jefferson.
Doctors will follow the twins' neurological development to
determine the extent of shared brain function, but don't expect
other health problems, he said.
