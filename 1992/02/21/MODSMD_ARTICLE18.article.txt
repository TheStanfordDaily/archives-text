## Are the sheep safe? 
### 
All animal abuse cases
must be made public to
keep community informed

STANFORD SCIENTISTS ARE
not ripping the skin off sheep.
But they have done some
thing to violate animal research
laws, and won't say what.
Medical School officials have
refused to release details of a
recent mistreatment incident at
Stanford'B Research Animal Facili
ty, although they do specifically
deny the sheep rumor.
The Medical School should
change its policy so the community
can make an informed decision
about the value of the experiments
being performed.
Animal research saves human
lives, but it also provides fertile
ground for abuses. Horror stories
detailing animal mistreatment are
a compelling argument for more
openness about discoveries of
improprieties in the laboratory.
Details of mistreatment cases
are among the few things kept
secret â€” specifics of experiments
are available to the public through
Freedom of Information laws. This
openness should be extended to
revealing abuses.
While the policy change could
place researchers in danger from
animal-rights activists, the alter
native is a secretive process that
may obscure serious problems in
the animal research field. With
holding the names of scientists
involved could help, although in
many cases it will be easy to dis
cover who is involved by looking at
the type of animal and the proce
dures being used.
Actions like death threats and
bombings, which have been direct
ed at scientists across the United
States in the past, should be
strongly condemned. But the fear
of angering the small minority of
activists who would stoop to these
tactics must not outweigh the ben

efits of allowing public debate on
the specifics of animal research.
Stanford has had its own experi
ences with animal-rights protests.
The construction of the animal facil
ity was delayed five years ago
because of opposition by a coalition
headed by the Palo Alto Humane
Society. There have also been regular
rallies and demonstrations by local
groups, some of which have resulted
in arrests for climbing on buildings
or occupying research facilities.
Despite these attempts to shut it
down, animal research has resulted
in great strides for science.
At Stanford, animals are essen
tial for research on the immune sys
tem, cancer genetics, developmental
biology and every major disease.
For example, a Stanford research
team successfully implanted a
human immune system into a
mouse about four years ago, allow
ing researchers to follow diseases
such as AIDS as they progress
through the animal's body. Since
the researchers used mice and
undeveloped organs from human
fetuses, however, they came under
fire from animal-rights activists
and anti-abortion groups.
While experiments need to con
tinue despite opposition, declining to
reveal the nature of the incidents
won't help the case for research. In
fact, it has already spurred specula
tion and rumors that might be worse
than the actual mistreatment.
Researchers contend that inci
dents serious enough to merit
stopping an experiment happen
only once or twice a year and are
relatively minor, since any proce
dures that deviate from plans
approved prior to an experiment
are considered violations. If the
abuse cases are really so harmless,
there shouldn't be a problem with
making them public.
Protests must not be allowed to
end the essential medical experi
ments being done at Stanford. But
unless all the details of what goes
on in the laboratories are available,
it will continue to be difficult to
convince the community to accept
animal research as a necessary evil.
