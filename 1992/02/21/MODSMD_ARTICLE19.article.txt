Appreciate similarities instead of opting for separatism

I READ WITH INTEREST Cory
Booker's Feb. 12 column in The
Daily. Let me first say that I agree
with him that people of all races and
ethnic groups must make an effort to
understand each other or there can be
no progress.
I was a graduate student at Stanford
20 years ago. I am white; 21 years ago I
married a beautiful Black woman from
Kenya. We are still happily married and
have three sons, all of whom we have
tried to teach to be proud of their African
heritage. For example, they both have
African and "American" given names.
We have tried to teach them to be
respectful of all people and not to
assume that any group of people is their
enemy. I can only hope they do not har
bor any of the self-hate described in the
column because we have always stressed
that they were lovable, capable and

beautiful. I have never pushed them to
have only white or only black friends
and they seem to get along with all kinds
of people.
As for myself, I am estranged from
my own parents and family, but I love
my wife's family, several of whom live in
the area, as my own. I didn't plan it this
way, but it turns out that everyone on
earth whom I love and care about, and
whom I regard as a friend, is Black.
Having said all of that, I am worried
that there seems to be more and more
ethnic and racial separatism going on
among the very group of people who
should be most open to learning about
other people and cultures, i.e. college
students.
If education does not broaden one's
own narrow, provincial outlook, then
what is the purpose of going to school? I
am not blaming only African-Americans

or only whites or only one group for this
state of affairs, though as the "imyori
ty," for now, whites may be the most to
blame.
I think what bothers me is that there
is so much emphasis on people's differ
ences; admittedly, whites for centuries
emphasized these differences in order to
keep people separated.
But I don't think anyone in America
can afford any longer the "luxury" of
separating themselves from everyone
who isn't just like them. The world has
become too crowded, too interdependent.
Suppose someone says,"I only want
to associate with my fellow whites, eat
our kind of foods, listen to our kind of
music, read books written by our own
people"; such a thing would be very diffi
cult, if not impossible, to do.
The American culture has been so
influenced by different races and ethnic

groups that it is no longer "European"
and WB3 not "invented" by any one
group. As just one example, all of Ameri
can music was and is profoundly influ
enced by people whose ancestors are
from Africa.
For that matter, the culture of Europe
is not monolithic, and was itself pro
foundly influenced by ancient cultures of
Asia, the Middle East and Egypt.
I hope that all Americans, all Stan
ford students, begin to realize that all
human beings are basically far more
alike than different.
Yes, cultural differences are beautiful,
interesting and to be celebrated, but at
the same time, we must realize that each
of us is human.
Why not emphasize what we all have
in common for a change?
