# To cheat or not to cheat: What about honesty?
## 
### 
Asst. Statistics Prof. Michael Martin
made a remarkable comment to The Daily
that was quoted Feb. 13 in its sad report
that 60 percent of Stanford students report
having cheated at one time or another.
He said: "It's a funny thing, because
the Honor Code says we should treat these
people like adults. But what rational adult,
given the opportunity to cheat, wouldn't?"
Martin asked this question rhetorical
ly, but I think he needs to find the
answer. Maybe then he won't be
"amazed at the Ihigh] rate of honesty."
Imagine a freshman making the first
ethical decision of his college career: to
cheat or not to cheat on a test when he
knows he can get away with it. He was
taught that cheating, like lying and
stealing, is simply wrong whether you
are caught or not.

On the other hand, it's the real world,
"everyone does it"and perhaps he's a
schmuck not to. To which path do these
enlightened words of Martin guide this
freshman? And what kind of character is
being formed as each such subsequent
decision is made?
Let's hope that Martin will presently
amend the statements which, as they
stand, reflect so badly on him and cor
rode the honor code system of his school.
