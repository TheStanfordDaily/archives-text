# No one should believe the budget crisis exists

Someone told the faculty, students
and employees at Stanford University
that the budget for 1992 must be cut by
$45 million. Apparently, most people
believed it, but few liked it.
I, however, do not believe it, because

adequate data is not available. When it
becomes available, the data must be sub
ject to scientific statistical analysis.
Lacking that, the cut of $45 million is
merely a personal opinion, merely an
assumption.
Alfred Worth Whitehead wrote: "When
challenging the philosophy of an epoch, do
not chiefly direct your attention to those
intellectual positions which its exponents
feel it necessary explicitly to defend.
"These will be some fundamental
assumptions which adherents of all the
various systems within the epoch uncon
sciously presuppose.
"Such assumptions appear so obvious
that people do not know what they are
assuming because no other way of putting
things has ever occurred to them."
I propose this hypothesis: the 1992
budget does not need to be cut at all! I
propose that adequate data be obtained,
then subjected to scientific statistical
analysis. I believe that there are many
faculty and students at Stanford who are

quite competent to do this.
I see nothing remarkable about chal
lenging assumptions and acting only on
firm data, for I know that many scien
tists, businesspersons and industrialists
do it all the time.
All hypotheses are not equally safe.
The man who killed the goose that laid
the golden eggs hypothesized that mak
ing cuts would bring wealth quicker. He
made the cuts and so destroyed forever
the producer of that wealth.
