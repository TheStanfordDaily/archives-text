ONE STORY THAT HAS NOT
received major media coverage
during the current Haitian crisis is
that of Carlos T.
Carlos is a former supporter of Jean-
Bertrand Aristide who lived in Cit6
Soleil, a shantytown of Port-au-Prince,
Haiti.
Whatever the elite thought of Aris
tide's ideology and style and governing,
the vast majority of the Haitian masses
— urban and rural — saw the democrati
cally elected priest-turned-president as
an alternative to the status quo.
Poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy
had deprived the Haitian people of their
economic livelihood and human dignity
for so long. Aristide's sweeping 67 per
cent election victory was a testament to
that.
Due to their political views, Carlos
and several of his friends were pursued
by the military after the Sept. 30 coup.
Many of his friends were murdered. Car
los' own house was stormed by soldiers
searching for him, during which time his
dog was killed, and his brother had a
revolver menacingly shoved into his
mouth.
After spending much time in hiding,
Carlos boarded a boat heading out of
Haiti — just as nearly 20,000 Haitians
have done for various reasons since the
coup. Carlos' boat was intercepted by the
U.S. Coast Guard, and he and the others

aboard were taken to the Guantanamo
Bay U.S. military base.
Carlos was lucky to be one of the 3,000
Haitians chosen for a hearing on asylum
in the United States, but more than
10,000 others are being sent back to a
very precarious situation.
While Carlos was honored with a
standing ovaticn at the close of a recent
Amnesty International Conference in
Oakland, many other refugees have not
been so lucky.
An article in the Feb. 10 issue of The
New York Times recounted numerous
similar cases, such as the military's pur
suit and murder of Lifete Similus and
other returnees. It demonstrated the
inhumanity of the Bush administration's
recent decision to begin repatriating
Haitians.
Carlos is afraid that more of his politi
cally active friends will be killed if they
are sent back. Their return looks increas
ingly likely.
In Miami, New York, Boston and even
California, demonstrations against the
U.S. policy have occurred. Virtually all
Haitians denounce the hypocrisy of the
Bush administration's decision to label
fleeing Haitians "economic refugees."
Critics of the embargo levied by the
United States and other nations of the
OAS (Organization of American States)
stress that the exodus is due to the polit
ically motivated embargo. Thus, they

conclude, the United States is responsi
ble for the refugees' well-being.
Aristide supporters argue that send
ing Haitians back to a situation of mur
der, terror and repression represents
sheer lunacy. Amnesty International
has stated that at least 1,500 people have
been killed by the military since the
coup.
Currently, intense negotiations are
underway in Haiti to find a compromise
government, while the United States is
deliberating on its future policy.
All sides seem to agree that the situa
tion in the country is going from bad to
worse, and ultimately, as always, it is
the humble civilians of Haiti, a land of
6.5 million people, that have been hit
the hardest by the disastrous turn of
events of the last five months.
Needless to say, the hope of a better
future for Haiti's majority — generated
by Aristide's December 1990 election
and the subsequent promises of massive
assistance from the IMF, the World
Bank and Western nations — has been
utterly dashed.

Paul Namphy went home to Haiti during
the summer of 1991.
