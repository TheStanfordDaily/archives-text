## Revenge: Cagers stomp 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
After yesterday's 83-61 Stan
ford victory over Washington, Val
Whiting jibed her teammate
Molly Goodenbour about just
missing a triple-double. Unfortu
nately for the junior point guard,
the offending statistic was her
nine turnovers.
But all kidding aside, Gooden
bour keyed the Cardinal offense
by dishing off 12 assists and
slashing and burning for 15
points. In the decisive second half,
Goodenbour cut through the
tough Husky defense almost at
will, giving out eight of her assists
in the last 20 minutes.
She only turned the ball over
three times in that half.
44 (Goodenbour's turnovers) are
a credit to Washington's defense,"
said Stanford coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "Their defense forces a
lot of turnovers. Those weren't
careless mistakes."
The major recipients of
Goodenbour's assists were
Whiting and Christy Hedgpeth.
Whiting once again led her
team in both scoring and
rebounding, with 24 points and
nine boards. Hedgpeth poured
in 19 points, including 12 in the
second half.
Many of those second half
points came on fast-break finish
es, as the Cardinal forced
turnover after turnover in a mid
period 16-4 romp.
Stanford began the second half
leading by only five points. The
Washington defense had matched
the home team shot for shot in
the first period, as both squads
went 14-for-30 from the field. The
Cardinal led by virtue of its edge
in free throws.
But after intermission Van-
Derveer unveiled a 2-3 match-up
zone defense which utterly con
founded the Huskies, who had
been successful against Stan

ford's man-to-man and occasional
1-3-1 zone defenses of the first
half.
"We did a horrible job attack
ing that [2-31 zone," said Wash
ington coach Chris Gobrecht. "I
was kind of excited to see that
zone, but I was surprised that we
didn't light it up a little bit."
With 14 minutes and 54 sec
onds on the clock, VanDerveer
sent in Anita Kaplan and
switched to the new look. In the
next five and a half minutes, with
Kaplan anchoring the interior
defense, Stanford extended its
lead from 45-41 to 61-45.
During that period the Cardi
nal forced five turnovers and rang
up points on six layups. The
Husky players looked confused
and listless when confronted with
Stanford's defense. They found
the interior passing lanes air
tight, and their only points during
the run came from perimeter
shots.
Washington center Dianne
Williams attributed the run to a
mental breakdown on her team's
part. "We know how to play
through a zone, but when we're
not thinking we make mistakes. A
zone defense can be effective, if
[the offense] is just standing
around."
"We tend to get into a down
ward spiral," Gobrecht said.
"This is a very young and inexpe
rienced Washington team.. .. We
tend to be susceptible to consecu
tive errors, because the first error
affects us deeply."
Fortunately for Stanford,
Goodenbour was not shaken by
her mistakes. Particularly in the
second half, when the Cardinal
defense sparked its transition
game, Goodenbour shined.
"I'm more confident when
we're out running. . . . That's one
of my strengths," Goodenbour
said.
"Molly and Val have killed us,"
Gobrecht said. "They have really

done a number on us. Molly
Goodenbour is doing a superb job.
I am very, very impressed with
Molly."
Asked about how Gooden
bour's passing helped her offense,
Whiting wryly observed, "You
can't score without the ball."
Goodenbour, although some
what surprised by her turnover
total, was pleased with her perfor
mance. "With every game I just
feel more comfortable on the
floor."
That is good news for Stan
ford, as it charges into the home
stretch of the regular season.
With four out the final six
games at home, Stanford is once
again poised to claim the Pacific
10 Conference championship.
The Cardinal is looking at a likely
No. 1 seed in the NCAA Western
Regional, where it is probable
that the team will face the
Huskies yet again.
The Cardinal's big advantage
now is an intangible. "A big key is
people's attitude," VanDerveer
said. "People are confident right
now, and positive."
