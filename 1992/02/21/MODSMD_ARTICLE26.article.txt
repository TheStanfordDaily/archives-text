# Murray, Bruins too much — UCLA runs over hoopsters

### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — In three previous
gamos against top 15 opponents, Stan
ford had taken it to the wire and lost.
But second-ranked UCLA jumped out
to a 14-2 lead last night and routed
Stanford 96-70 at sold-out Pauley Pavil
ion.
Bruin forward Tracy Murray scored
25 of his game-high 36 points in the
first half, as UCLA built a 48-26 lead.
The Bruins out-rebounded Stanford 25-
16 in the opening stanza, while the
overwhelmed Cardinal shot just 30 per

cent from the field.
"You just saw UCLA at their best
tonight, which consequently meant that
we were never in the game," Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said. "Tonight
we had to play our best and obviously
we didn't do it. UCLA was ready to play
and was fired up. They smelled blood
and went after it."
Stanford turned the ball over 18
times, shot 38 percent from the field
and was out-rebounded 47-39. While
Stanford made just 19 of 38 free throws,
UCLA sank 31 of 39.
Stanford played well enough to beat
the Bruins in their last meeting, an 83-

77 UCLA win at Maples Pavilion, but
never led last night against an intense
Bruin attack.
Murray, hitting two king-kong slams
and four free throws, scored eight of
UCLA's first 12 points and didn't slow
down. Four minutes into the second
half he had out-scored the entire Stan
ford team, 30-28.
"I can't cover every guy on the floor,"
said Stanford forward Adam Keefe, who
scored 18 of a team-high 26 points in
the second half. "When they come out
and play like that, there's really no way
we can beat them."
The blowout snapped an improbable

two-game Stanford win streak at Pauley
and dropped the fourth-place Cardinal
(14-7, 6-5 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
to within a half game of Arizona State.
The Sun Devils (15-9, 6-6) upset No. 5
Arizona (19-4, 9-3) 77-74 last night in
Tempe.
The Bruins (20-1, 11-1) now have a
one-game lead over second-place USC.
The 15th-ranked Trojans beat Califor
nia 94-81 last night and host Stanford
tomorrow at 3 p.m. in the Sports
Arena.
"This is just one loss, people have to
remember that," Keefe said. "We're still
6-5 and in great shape for the NCAA

Tournament."
UCLA built its lead to 31 points in
the second half as both teams went to
the bench. Keefe, hounded by Mitchell
Butler and Gerald Madkins all night,
left with six minutes left and the Bru
ins in control 81-53.
Junior Jason Weaver scored a
career-high eight points in 20 minutes
of action to lead the reserves. Guard
Bobby Patton took a courageous charge
on a dunk by 6-foot-8 monster Ed
O'Bannon and David Harbour hooked
it up with seven-foot goliath Jiri Zidek
as the Stanford reserves came out fir
ing.
