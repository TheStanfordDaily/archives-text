# Card nine goes to the islands, faces 15th-ranked Rainbows
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
It seems that the Stanford baseball
team may have finally figured out how to
avoid the rain-outs that have been going
on lately. Go to Hawaii. The Cardinal
travels to the sands of Honolulu this
weekend as they take on Hawaii for a
three-game series with the Rainbow War
riors, ranked 15th by Collegiate Baseball
in the preseason.
While the Card may be excited to
escape the overcast skies of California, it
would be best if they didn't devote too
much attention to even tans — last
Wednesday's game against San Jose
State perhaps evidenced what happens
when the mind wanders. And the Rain
bows will have to be taken far more seri
ously than the Spartans ever were.
The Rainbow's sixth-place 51 wins in

in Division I last year, after not being
ranked in anyone's polls in the presea
son, surprised many. And, according to
Hawaii head coach Les Murakami, "Tal
ent-wise, we're better this year."
The strength of Hawaii's '92 team,
unlike last year's heavy hitting squad, is
pitching. The leader of the Rainbow's
men of the mound is Bill Blanchette, who
was also a huge surprise when he gar
nered Ail-American honors (14-2 last
year with a 2.68 ERA). Other top per
formers should be Scott Karl (10-4 last
year, 4.36) and Craig Tucker (4-0, 6.19,
13 saves), whose numbers belie his abili
ties.
Perhaps Hawaii's best pitcher is
junior Levon Largusa, whose season last
year (4-5, 5.02) was but a shadow of what
Largusa could have achieved without a
wrist injury suffered at the end of his
freshman campaign. However, the wrist

seems to be fully healed, and Largusa is
projected to be one of the top pitchers in
the nation.
The Rainbow also has an ample
amount of pesky hitters, with little power
but an abundance of persistence. Out
fielders Harold Cabbab and Ken Harri
son hit .369 and .336 respectively last
year, which is quite impressive consider
ing Hawaii's 69 game schedule, providing
plenty of at-bats. Sophomore catcher
Tyler Sheff can also handle the bat, hit
ting .301 in '91, and pitcher Blanchette
plays first base on his off-days, where he
hit .315 last year.
The Cardinal, on the other hand, con
tinues to struggle with the bat on the
whole — freshman designated hitter
Dusty Allen and senior leftfielder Dave
Cornell are the only everyday players hit
ting over .300. However, Jeffrey Ham
monds seems to be coming out of his cus

tomary slow start at the plate. And on the
base paths, Hammonds already has
stolen 10 bases in 11 attempts.
The Cardinal defense continues to
impress, and the pitching has been out
standing. Stanford coach Mark Marquess
has the enviable problem of having four
legitimate front-line starters in Brian

Sackinsky, Jamie Sepeda, Rick Helling
and Willie Adams, whose pitching in
relief has made quite a statement.
And if the Card is able to put it all
together — defense, pitching, and run
manufacturing — in the sunny world of
leis and luaus, their winning ways will
continue to look as bright.
