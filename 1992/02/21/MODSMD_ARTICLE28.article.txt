THIS WEEKEND — Stanford faces the 15th-ranked Hawaii Rainbows in a three-game series in
Hawaii today, tomorrow, and Sunday.
THE RAINBOWS— This year's squad starts with its pitchers. Bill Blanchette, an Ail-American
last year with a 14-2 record, is back and performing well for Hawaii. Other strong hurlers
include Scott Karl, who went 10-4 last year, Craig Tucker, who had 13 saves, and Levon
Largusa, who has recovered from a wrist-injury and is projected to be one of the nation's top
pitchers.
LAST YEAR — The Rainbows had 51 wins last year as they finished a surprising sixth place
in the nation. The team had not been ranked in any preseason polls.
