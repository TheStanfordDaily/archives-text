# Netters squeak by Harvard, 4-2

### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
The Crimson and Cardinal
engaged in a fierce battle yester
day in the second round of, not
the Knowledge Bowl, but the
National Indoor Team Champi
onships of men's tennis in
Louisville, Ky.
Stanford, with a first round
bye, eked out a 4-2 win over
Harvard. Referred to by Cardi
nal head coach Dick Gould as "a
real blood and guts team," the
Crimson dragged five of the six
singles matches to three sets.
After an 8 a.m. win over
eighth-seeded Miami, the indoor
specialists from Cambridge
were warmed up and ready to
upset the third-seeded Cardinal.
But the men of Stanford had
different ideas.
Alex O'Brien led the way,

defeating Albert Chang 6-4, 6-4.
"Alex kept right on top of him
the whole time," Gould said. At
second singles, No. 12 Michael
Flanagan had a much different
match, losing the first set 0-6 to
the 15th-ranked player in the
nation. He rallied back to win
the second 6-3 but dropped the
third set 6-4.
Chris Cocotos and Vimal
Patel kept Stanford squarely in
the match with three*set wins at
third and sixth singles, respec
tively. "Chris hung in there and
did a real good job," assistant
coach John Whitlinger said.
With punishing first serves and
biting volleys, Cocotos defeated
No. 37 Michael Shyjan 6-4, 3-6,
6-4.
With Jason Yee's disappoint
ing three-set defeat in the No. 5
spot, the Cardinal was on the
verge of entering doubles play

and dragging the match on into
the evening.
But sophomore Robert
Devens saved the day by win
ning a tiebreaker in the third set
to clinch a Cardinal victory. "He
was the hero," Gould said. Serv
ing at 5-4 in the third, Devens
cracked and pushed the match
into a tiebreaker, but then
regained his composure and
crushed his opponent 7-2.
"He showed a lot of guts com
ing back," Whitlinger said.
Devens' play reflected the
team's overall performance.
"We competed really well,"
Whitlinger said. "They're a very
good team. We were a bit wor
ried about this one."
Hopefully, the sun-loving
Cardinal men have adapted to
the indoor surfaces because
today they are facing a tradition
ally tough bunch of Bulldogs
from Georgia.
Although the No. 11 team
graduated several top players,
Whitlinger likens their lineup to
the Cardinal's. "They've got a
lot of young hard workers.
They're a lot like us — no real
superstars (with the exception
of O'Brien) but they're solid
down the line."
Card notes:
The format of this tournament is
different than in years past because,
in an effort to conserve time, doubles
matches are only being played if
there is a 3-3 tie in singles play.
Then, doubles matches are played in
eight-game pro sets.
