# Replacement weight facilities likely to get 'equivalent' space
## 
### Craig Kersemeier Staff writer 
Several proposals to allay student concerns about
the closing of Encina Gym would expand the current
weight-lifting facilities in Roble Gym or provide
space for a weight room in the new sports center,
according to Encina manager Chris Horpel.
"Whatever replaces Encina Gym will provide equiv
alent space," Horpel said. Facilities at the new sports
center could be even larger than Encina's, he added.
Students who use the campus weight rooms have
expressed anger recently at the announcement that
Encina will be closed because of the high cost of
making it meet earthquake safety standards.
According to Assoc. Athletic Director Thomas
Beckett, the plans for expanding the weight-lifting
facilities have yet to be determined. "But we're
doing everything we can to answer the needs of the
students and will continue to do so," he added.
Horpel said only the outer dimensions of the new

$15 million DAPER Sports Center are fixed. The allot
ment of space inside is still "up in the air," he said.
The new sports center will contain Athletics Depart
ment offices, a training room, athletic locker rooms and
a varsity basketball practice court. A possible weight
room is "still up for grabs," according to Horpel.
Weight-lifting enthusiasts say they are encour
aged by this possibility.
"I think if they're spending this much money on
the Athletic Department they should spend at least
a little bit for the student body," said sophomore
Atman Shah, a regular gym user. "We're the ones
paying full tuition."
"With all the success of the [department] it's a
shame they don't spread it around more," said
sophomore Naveen Kella. "It would be really cool if
they could get the new place to have a weight room."
"The new facility is one that is badly needed and
will serve the needs of the students," Beckett said.
He said he could not respond to
student criticisms because he has
not heard any.
Horpel said the 77-year-old
Encina will probably close in the
summer of 1993 at the earliest.
"Encina Gym must be reinforced
to meet earthquake standards or
be evacuated by 1995," he added.
Rather than spend the $7.5
million to keep Encina open, the
University decided to raze the
building and put the money
toward a modern facility. Because
of its age, Encina currently costs
about $75,000 a year to maintain.
If space is not available in the
new sports center, the weightlift
ing area at Roble will be expanded
to accommodate Encina's equip
ment, according to Horpel.
"There is actually a lot of
unused space in Roble that people
don't really notice, (such as) lock
ers that haven't been used in 20
years," he said. If this space was
utilized. Roble could match the

"If the facility in Roble is the
same size as Encina it wouldn't be
so bad," sophomore Seth Schelin
said.
Schelin added that Encina
could actually use some more
equipment. "You shouldn't have
to wait for half an hour to use the
bench press," he said.
Horpel said that he and fenc
ing coach Zoran Tulum have also
discussed with the department
the possibility of converting the
recreational basketball court at
Roble into a new weight training
facility.
