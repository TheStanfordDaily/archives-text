# Tennis faces tough Arizona State
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
The cactus is Arizona's state
flower but the Stanford women's
tennis team hopes to stick it to
the Wildcats and the Sun Devils
this weekend.
The No. 5 Cardinal faces No. 7
Arizona today in a match featur
ing several top collegiate players.
Fifth-ranked Heather Willens
meets 1 lth-ranked Danielle Scott
in the No. 1 singles clash.
"Scott is very good. Willy will
have her hands full," Stanford
coach Frank Brennan said.
"[Scott'sl a different kind of play
er than Heather. She's big and
hits hard â€” a real power player."
Willens is coming off a 6-0, 6-1
thrashing of California's Lisa
Albano in the Cardinal's 7-2 vic
tory Monday. "If Heather can
play 90 percent of the way she did
against Lisa, she'll be in good
shape," Brennan said.

'Scott is very good.
Willy will have her
hands full.'

At No. 2 singles Laxmi Poruri
takes on Banni Redhair. The
Stanford sophomore is No. 18 in
the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate poll
while Redhair is No. 40.
Sophomore Kristine Kurth
may make the Cardinal's singles
lineup for the first time in the
dual-match season. Kurth has
had a sore back since January but
saw some doubles action against
the Bears.
"That's one of the benefits (of
finishing the Cal match despite
rain). She got to play and get into
the flow emotionally and physi
cally," Brennan said.
Kurth and Amy Chiminello
beat Lisa Parks and Valerie Pou-

Los in straight sets. Kurth said her
back was a little tight in the first
few games but didn't bother her
the rest of the match.
The condition of her back this
weekend will determine whether
she competes in singles, doubles,
or both.
In the top doubles slot Willens
and Poruri challenge Scott and
Redhair. The Wildcat duo beat
the Stanford pair 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 in
the quarterfinals of the Rolex
Indoor Championships.
However, Arizona doubles
tandems have been blanked in the
their last two dual matches. The
Wildcats led No. 4 UCLA 4-2 after
singles but dropped all three dou
bles contests to lose the match.
The same thing happened against
Arizona State.
The victorious Sun Devils host
the Cardinal Saturday. Arizona
State is led by Krista Amend, Kori
Davidson, Meredith Geiger and
Pam CiofTi.
