# Ryan overcomes injuries, leads Card into postseason
## 
### Peter Marks Staff writer 
Stanford senior Tim Ryan describes himself as a
hyper little monkey when he was a child. Of course,
leaping through trees and springing up ropes is just
the way a potential Olympic gymnast should spend
his childhood, isn't it?
On the advice of his elementary school physical
education teacher, Ryan channeled his primatial
energies into gymnastics, his career began in an
afternoon tumbling program and eventually led him

to Stanford.
In his first season at the Farm, Ryan took sixth
place in the all-around competition at the NCAA
championships. In addition, he earned all-American
honors in two different disciplines.
Ryan rode that wave of success during the follow
ing summer when he traveled to Japan to participate
in a competition between the United States and the
former Soviet Union. He subsequently competed in
the World Sports Fair competition.
At the latter meet, Ryan suffered one of his most
embarrassing moments when he fell twice on the

high bar.
"I had just been introduced as the leading Ameri
can and then I fell on my face on TV," Ryan recalled.
"I trained my butt off for the U.S. Championships
because I sure as hell wasn't going to fall off again."
At that meet, Ryan more than atoned for his TV
bloopers. At 18, he became the youngest U.S.
National all-around champion since Olympian Bart
Connor.
Ryan remembers the incredible feeling his victory
brought him, but he also takes great pride in receiv
ing a congratulatory letter from—believe it or not—
Dean Jean.
But the good times came to an end.
In the beginning of his sophomore year, Ryan
broke the nevicular bone in his wrist while training
for the World Championships. Both Ryan and his
physician failed to realize the athlete had a fracture
and treated the injury like a sprain.
Five months later, Ryan's wrist had not healed
and the sophomore found himself in tremendous
pain and struggling in competition. A second opinion
from another doctor revealed that Ryan had not only
broken his wrist, but re-fractured it.
Ryan suspects that he unknowingly broke the
bone several years ago while skateboarding. The
bone had healed improperly and Ryan simply shook
off the pain he later felt in his wrist as a symptom of
his strenuous sport.
While relieved to find there was a reason for his
wrist pain, Ryan also had to contend with a career
threatening injury.
"I broke one of the worst bones for a gymnast
because we use our hands like people use their feet,"
Ryan said. "I talked to other gymnasts who weren't
the same after."
In February of his junior year, eleven months
later, Ryan finally returned to competition. The long
layoff took its toll on his strength and his perfor
mance disappointed him.
"It seemed as if I was as strong as before, but
everything loosened up," Ryan says."It led to a lot of
injuries, which was frustrating."
But Ryan still made the U.S. team for the Pan
American games during the summer of 1991. Unfor
tunately, the gymnast got sick and was unable to
compete.
"But I got the [commemorative] watch," Ryan
said.
After the Pan Am games, arthroscopic surgery
was performed on Ryan's elbow to remove a bone

chip. With the competition season over, Ryan took a
vacation from gymnastics, spending his days on the
beach and getting a tan.
"I decided to slow down and let my body heal,"
Ryan reflected. "There was no need to rush."
The rest paid off as Ryan found his workouts and
performances improving when he resumed training
this fall. The ultimate vindication came at the Winter
Nationals tournament in Colorado earlier this month.

'I want people to see me
working hard. I won't quit
until I've done what it takes.'
— Tim Ryan

In a competition that marks the first step towards
Barcelona, Ryan burst back into national promi
nence with a sixth-place finish.
"Tim Ryan definitely proved to the people he's
back," Stanford coach Sadao Hamada said.
Although Ryan says he made four major mistakes
in the competition, his performance reassured him
that he could compete at the same level as when he
won the NCAA championships as a freshman.
As he reflects on his role as co-captain of the gym
nastics team, Ryan folds his massive arms on his
chest. One cannot help but envision Popeye doing
flips off of the high bar.
Ryan admits that he is not a very vocal person in
the gym, but prefers to lead by example.
"I want people to see me working hard," Ryan
says."I won't quit until I've done what it takes."
That commitment also applies to Ryan's studies
as a computer systems engineer. His schedule is bro
ken up between long hours in the gym and long
hours in the lab.
Healthy once again, Ryan has set his sights not on
qualifying for the Olympics, but on continuing to
perform what he calls "quality gymnastics."
"If I execute well, the Olympics will be a by-prod
uct," Ryan explains. "If I don't go to the Olympics
and perform well, I'll be happy."
If Ryan continues to perform the way he has in
recent competitions, expect to see one former hyper
little monkey representing the U.S. in Barcelona.

energies into gymnastics, his career began in an
afternoon tumbling program and eventually led him

to Stanford.
In his first season at the Farm, Ryan took sixth
place in the all-around competition at the NCAA
championships. In addition, he earned all-American
honors in two different disciplines.
Ryan rode that wave of success during the follow
ing summer when he traveled to Japan to participate
in a competition between the United States and the
former Soviet Union. He subsequently competed in
the World Sports Fair competition.
At the latter meet, Ryan suffered one of his most
embarrassing moments when he fell twice on the

high bar.
"I had just been introduced as the leading Ameri
can and then I fell on my face on TV," Ryan recalled.
"I trained my butt off for the U.S. Championships
because I sure as hell wasn't going to fall off again."
At that meet, Ryan more than atoned for his TV
bloopers. At 18, he became the youngest U.S.
National all-around champion since Olympian Bart
Connor.
Ryan remembers the incredible feeling his victory
brought him, but he also takes great pride in receiv
ing a congratulatory letter from—believe it or not—
Dean Jean.
But the good times came to an end.
In the beginning of his sophomore year, Ryan
broke the nevicular bone in his wrist while training
for the World Championships. Both Ryan and his
physician failed to realize the athlete had a fracture
and treated the injury like a sprain.
Five months later, Ryan's wrist had not healed
and the sophomore found himself in tremendous
pain and struggling in competition. A second opinion
from another doctor revealed that Ryan had not only
broken his wrist, but re-fractured it.
Ryan suspects that he unknowingly broke the
bone several years ago while skateboarding. The
bone had healed improperly and Ryan simply shook
off the pain he later felt in his wrist as a symptom of
his strenuous sport.
While relieved to find there was a reason for his
wrist pain, Ryan also had to contend with a career
threatening injury.
"I broke one of the worst bones for a gymnast
because we use our hands like people use their feet,"
Ryan said. "I talked to other gymnasts who weren't
the same after."
In February of his junior year, eleven months
later, Ryan finally returned to competition. The long
layoff took its toll on his strength and his perfor
mance disappointed him.
"It seemed as if I was as strong as before, but
everything loosened up," Ryan says."It led to a lot of
injuries, which was frustrating."
But Ryan still made the U.S. team for the Pan
American games during the summer of 1991. Unfor
tunately, the gymnast got sick and was unable to
compete.
"But I got the [commemorative] watch," Ryan
said.
After the Pan Am games, arthroscopic surgery
was performed on Ryan's elbow to remove a bone

chip. With the competition season over, Ryan took a
vacation from gymnastics, spending his days on the
beach and getting a tan.
"I decided to slow down and let my body heal,"
Ryan reflected. "There was no need to rush."
The rest paid off as Ryan found his workouts and
performances improving when he resumed training
this fall. The ultimate vindication came at the Winter
Nationals tournament in Colorado earlier this month.

In a competition that marks the first step towards
Barcelona, Ryan burst back into national promi
nence with a sixth-place finish.
"Tim Ryan definitely proved to the people he's
back," Stanford coach Sadao Hamada said.
Although Ryan says he made four major mistakes
in the competition, his performance reassured him
that he could compete at the same level as when he
won the NCAA championships as a freshman.
As he reflects on his role as co-captain of the gym
nastics team, Ryan folds his massive arms on his
chest. One cannot help but envision Popeye doing
flips off of the high bar.
Ryan admits that he is not a very vocal person in
the gym, but prefers to lead by example.
"I want people to see me working hard," Ryan
says."I won't quit until I've done what it takes."
That commitment also applies to Ryan's studies
as a computer systems engineer. His schedule is bro
ken up between long hours in the gym and long
hours in the lab.
Healthy once again, Ryan has set his sights not on
qualifying for the Olympics, but on continuing to
perform what he calls "quality gymnastics."
"If I execute well, the Olympics will be a by-prod
uct," Ryan explains. "If I don't go to the Olympics
and perform well, I'll be happy."
If Ryan continues to perform the way he has in
recent competitions, expect to see one former hyper
little monkey representing the U.S. in Barcelona.

Stanford senior Tim Ryan describes himself as a
hyper little monkey when he was a child. Of course,
leaping through trees and springing up ropes is just
the way a potential Olympic gymnast should spend
his childhood, isn't it?
