# Gymnastics challenges No. 3 Beavers
##

They have overcome every obstacle in their
way to this point, including inexperience,
injuries and one of the nation's toughest
schedules. Yet for the No. 16 Stanford Cardi
nal women's gymnastics team, one of the
biggest roadblocks of them all awaits.
Tonight, the Cardinal will travel to Corval
lis to take on No. 3 Oregon State as its Pacific
10 Conference dual meet season resumes. To
have an idea of how tough the Beavers are to
defeat, one need only look at the top of their
lineup. Sophomore Chari Knight is a return

ing Ail-American who, according to Stanford
head coach Breck Greenwood, "scores a 9.90
or a 9.95 in every event."
If it takes perfection to emerge victorious,
though, the Cardinal has never been in a bet
ter position to make things interesting. Stan
ford is coming off a record-setting perfor
mance in which it put up 190 out of a possible
200 points, considered nationally to be the
barrier to becoming an elite team.
Freshman Meegan Lannin will compete in
the floor exercise for the first time in her col
legiate career, while sophomore Mollie Brown,
who had an outstanding showing last week
against UC-Santa Barbara, will try a new

tumbling pass in her floor routine. Sophomore
Kerri Kanuka — who finished second to team
mate Jene Elzie in the individual all-around a
week ago — has also taken on more technical
difficulty in her floor program.
So can the ladies rise to the level of their
fierce competition and pull off an upset? All
indications seem to point to that as a plausible
scenario, but Stanford will still have to per
form at the height of its capabilities in order to
make it a reality, a fact Greenwood recognizes.
"Our job is to perform well. We can't control
the scoring," he said. Tonight, his team will
attempt to earn the respect that goes with a com
mand performance by killing a conference giant.
