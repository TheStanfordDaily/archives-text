# Grapplers fall to Bulldogs in season finale
## 
### Larry Liu Staff writer 
The Stanford wrestling team finished its
regular season last Wednesday night against a
powerful Fresno State team. The Bulldogs
proved to be too much for the Cardinal, as
they took a relatively easy 32-12 victory.
Even so, Stanford's Jay Jackson, Matt
Topham, and Mark Graham all enjoyed victo
ries against their opponents. Jackson totally
dominated in his 134-pound bout, taking down
Tony Trujillo 22-7 for a technical fall. Jackson
was never challenged in his match by Trujillo,
who was subbing for an injured teammate.
At 158 pounds, co-captain Matt Topham
eased by Anthony Camancho in a 9-0 msyor

decision. Topham, wrestling down a weight
class, seemed comfortable with his new weight
and dominated his outclassed opponent.
In the final match of the night, co-captain
Mark Graham won his bout against Jeremy
McKean by a margin of 6-2. Though mentally
prepared, Graham was slowed down by a low
blood sugar count, making the match a lot
closer than it should have been.
Coach Chris Horpel was quick to point out
the positives of the dual meet.
"We did well against Fresno State. Cal
State-Bakersfield, whom we lost to earlier this
season, was only able to score six points off of
[Fresno State]. While everyone did not wrestle
to his potential, as a whole our team per
formed close to its best."

Stanford finished its season with a 4-5-1
record in its dual meets. The Cardinal was
paced by Graham (15-4), Topham (16-6), Jack
son (16-7) and junior Lance Johnson (11-5).
Horpel noted, "What the team represented
this year more than most others in the past is
consistency. Eveiyone developed this year and
went up a notch. Though forfeits in two
weight classes put us at a 12 point handicap,
we were still able to win about half our
meets."
The grapplers can now look forward to the
Pacific 10 Conference Championships Feb.
28-29.
"We've worked long and hard hours this
year," Horpel said. "I hope [the wrestlers] will
be at their best next Friday and Saturday."
