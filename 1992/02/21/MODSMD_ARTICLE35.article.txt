# Softball plays at home

When the Stanford Women's
Softball team takes the field
tomorrow afternoon at 1:30
against Humboldt State, it won't
just be season's first home game,
or the first Stanford game held at
the El Camino field. If the rains
stay away, fans will witness Stan
ford's very first home varsity
softball game, period.
In what the Athletic Depart
ment considers a "transition
year," the Cardinal has been
plunged into a full varsity sched
ule, preparing for a full Pacific 10
Conference load next spring. And
this transitional season promises
to be a baptism by fire for the
young Cardinal — the team faces
a grueling 56-game schedule, all
doubleheaders, with only six
home dates.

There is also no department
funding. There are no scholar
ships or batting cages, and there
isn't a level practice field. Gener
ous assistant coaches work on a
volunteer basis, donating their
own equipment to the team.
Fortunately, the Cardinal has
the guts and the talent to com
pete. The team is led by three co
captains: slick third baseman
senior Minerva Tirado, slugging
shortstop junior Lauri Reffelt
and speedy junior outfielder
Kendra "Jackrabbit" Kill
patrick.
Should the poorly-drained El
Camino field remain too soggy
for play tomorrow, fast-pitch
fans can catch the team next Sat
urday at Santa Clara at noon,
and at home March 7 and 8
against powerful Oregon and
Oregon State.
