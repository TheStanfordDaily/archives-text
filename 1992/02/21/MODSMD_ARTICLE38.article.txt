# Chronicling black successes
## Author writes about people who 'achieve against odds' 
### Cheo H. Coker Staff writer 
A career in journalism was
inevitable for Audrey Edwards,
editor-at-large of Essence Maga
zine, a New York-based monthly
publication for black women.
"Having a father who was in
the business, as a living role
model, was very important,"
Edwards said.
The editor and author was at
the Stanford Bookstore yester
day signing copies of her new
book, "Children Of The Dream:
The Psychology of Black Suc
cess." The book was co-written
with Craig Polite, a psycholo
gist.
The book focuses on the
plight of what Edwards terms
"the black baby boom/integra
tion generation." It contains 41
profiles — the result of two
years of interviewing and three
years of writing.
Edwards said he and Polite
"wanted to tell a positive story
about black people. . . . We were
tired with all the books about
what's wrong with black people
— unemployment, the murder
rate."
"The fact is there's always
been a tradition of black suc
cess, there have always been
black people who have achieved
against the odds, and we really
wanted to document some of
those stories," she said.
According to Edwards, suc
cessful African-Americans "take
responsibility for what happens
to them even though racism is
real" and possess "the ability to
be a pioneer."
While some African-Ameri
cans are seen as a threat by cer
tain whites, the successful ones
"manage not to be a threat, but
still to be a factor," she said.
As editor-at-large for
Essence, Edwards is involved
with writing, editing and pro
duction. The magazine has a
circulation of 900,000, and its
growing popularity and suc
cess comes from "managing to

give women what they want,"
according to Edwards.
Essence "covers issues
beyond the traditional woman's
service magazine that are of
interest to black people ... to
try to be cutting-edge, give basic
information, but also informa
tion that enhances people's
knowledge," she said.
Edwards' position gives her
the chance to work not only as
an editor of a national publica
tion, but also as an author and
the owner of a real estate busi
ness in Brooklyn. She has
worked for Essence for more
than 10 years, spending five as

executive editor and five as edi
tor-at-large.
Edwards was raised in
Washington and graduated
from the University of Wash
ington in 1969. She advised
aspiring writers to "read every
thing and to get a solid ground
ing in the social sciences, more
so than training as a journal
ist."
Edwards offered special
advice to female writers of color.
"We really have to learn to read
between the lines and create our
own definitions and not to be
seduced to use the definitions of
others," she said.
