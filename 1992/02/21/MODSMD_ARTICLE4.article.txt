# Fac Sen gets back to academics
## Professors debate changes in graduate administration 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate returned
to less glamorous business yester
day, shifting away from the dis
cussion of budget cuts that has
dominated the last two meetings.
By the end of what Chair James
Sheehan said could be a "meeting
known for its brevity," the senate
approved a master's degree in
immunology and discussed the
impact of last year's decentraliza
tion of graduate studies.
The committee on graduate
studies, responding to a senate
request to examine the reorgani
zation, found that it "did not pro
ceed without pain and difficulty,"
said English Prof. Albert Gelpi,

chair of the committee.
Last year, the Office of Gradu
ate Studies, as well as the Office
of Undergraduate Studies, was
disbanded and its responsibilities
were shifted to individual schools.
"There was recognition that
the new system was legislated and
put into place before the ground
rules for the transition were laid
out," Gelpi said. "We did not find
any expression on the part of
schools to rethink the matter or
reverse the process."
History Prof. David Kennedy
said his department has "enthusi
astically welcomed" the change.
"It conforms to good manage
ment" schemes, Kennedy said. "It
puts the resources closest to
where the decisions are made.

"We do not have to dance to
someone else's tune," he added.
But not all faculty agreed.
"There is a feeling that people
never wanted the change, but it is
seen as irreversible now," Art Prof.
Albert Elsen said. According to
Elsen, the deans do not want to re
create graduate studies "because
the process is too far along."
"My understanding is that
morale among administrators has
never been so bad or so low," he
added.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
said people "realize that this
hasty, ill-timed, badly-planned
decision has led to actions that
cannot be reversed."
