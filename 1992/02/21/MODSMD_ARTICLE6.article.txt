# Panel urges evaluation of tobacco investments
## Trustees asked to bring pressure on industry 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
A panel that advises the Board of
Trustees has recommended that the Uni
versity reexamine its $30 million invest
ment in tobacco industry giant Phillip
Morris and two other tobacco companies.
The Advisory Panel for Investment
Responsibility suggested at the last meet
ing of the Board of Trustees that one of the
board's subcommittees reconsider a previ
ous proposal to begin talks with Phillip
Morris in an effort to influence the firm's
behavior.
The panel, mostly composed of Univer
sity staff, drafted a letter last spring to the
firm's CEO expressing concern about its
lack of effort to curb teen-age smoking; the
detrimental effects of targeting women,
minorities and young people in marketing
campaigns; and the need for accurate
warning labels on exported cigarettes.

As of January, the University held more
than $28 million in Phillip Morris stock,
more than $1 million in Loews Corporation
and $675,000 in American Brands.
The University's stock in tobacco compa
nies makes up about 3 percent of its total
investments, according to Gary Malone, direc
tor of investment responsibility for the semi
autonomous Stanford Management Compa
ny. The management company controls the
University's $1.7 billion endowment.
Malone said he serves as an "unbiased"
source of information for University com
mittees regarding Stanford's investments.
Harvard University and the City Uni
versity of New York dropped their tobacco
company stocks in the summer of 1990.
Johns Hopkins followed suit last March.
The advisory panel first brought the
issue to the Trustees' attention last January
in response to a letter written by State
Health Director Kenneth Kizer.
The letter asked the University to
consider divesting its stocks in
tobacco companies.
The panel's draft letter to the
Phillip Morris CEO had been
scheduled to be presented at a
June Board of Trustees meet
ing, but the Board froze the sub
committees until the Feb. 10
meeting in order to address the
indirect-cost issue, Malone said.
In the letter, the panel stated
that the University was "hopeful"
that the CEO would be "able to
head Phillip Morris and the
tobacco industry to promote the
responsible marketing of tobacco
products," said panel chair Diana
Diamond, special projects editor
in the Medical School's communi
cations office.
Diamond said the University's
investment policy is to communi
cate with companies before taking
any action, and that the Universi
ty has not yet decided whether it
will divest its stocks if Phillip Mor
ris does not respond satisfactorily.
According to Malone, the pur
pose of investment evaluation is
to influence companies and indus
tries. If that fails, he said divest
ment is a "last resort." However,
he added that divestment is
"sometimes necessary."
Now that the issue has been
brought to the Trustees' atten
tion again, Malone said the Uni
versity's goal is still to "find the

Stanford University

tobacco addiction.'

company that is doing harm and
ask it to modify its behavior
before any investment decisions."
Because the University deals
with its investors on a case by case
basis, Malone said it will try to
establish contact with Phillip Mor
ris first as a "test" for the two other
tobacco companies it holds stock in.
In another recent develop
ment, the Tobacco Divestment
Project, a Boston-based organiza
tion of self-titled "pro-health
activists," sent a letter to Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
urging him to "explore what
Stanford University can do to
help stem the tide of teen-age
tobacco addiction."
The Jan. 31 letter reads: "We
ask you to join Harvard, Johns
Hopkins, City University of New
York and others which have
divested their holdings in tobacco
companies. At the very least,
Stanford University should not
profit from tobacco addiction."
Asst. to the President Robert
Hamrdla said the project's letter
should have been forwarded to Mal
one, so the President's office "didn't
make any attempt to answer it."
Malone said he has not
received the letter.
