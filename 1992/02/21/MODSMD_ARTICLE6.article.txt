# Panel urges evaluation of tobacco investments
## Trustees asked to bring pressure on industry 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
A panel that advises the Board of
Trustees has recommended that the Uni
versity reexamine its $30 million invest
ment in tobacco industry giant Phillip
Morris and two other tobacco companies.
The Advisory Panel for Investment
Responsibility suggested at the last meet
ing of the Board of Trustees that one of the
board's subcommittees reconsider a previ
ous proposal to begin talks with Phillip
Morris in an effort to influence the firm's
behavior.
The panel, mostly composed of Univer
sity staff, drafted a letter last spring to the
firm's CEO expressing concern about its
lack of effort to curb teen-age smoking; the
detrimental effects of targeting women,
minorities and young people in marketing
campaigns; and the need for accurate
warning labels on exported cigarettes.

As of January, the University held more
than $28 million in Phillip Morris stock,
more than $1 million in Loews Corporation
and $675,000 in American Brands.
The University's stock in tobacco compa
nies makes up about 3 percent of its total
investments, according to Gary Malone, direc
tor of investment responsibility for the semi
autonomous Stanford Management Compa
ny. The management company controls the
University's $1.7 billion endowment.
Malone said he serves as an "unbiased"
source of information for University com
mittees regarding Stanford's investments.
Harvard University and the City Uni
versity of New York dropped their tobacco
company stocks in the summer of 1990.
Johns Hopkins followed suit last March.
The advisory panel first brought the
issue to the Trustees' attention last January
in response to a letter written by State
