Stanford is finding it is not alone in its
current budget crunch as universities from
Harvard to UC-Berkeley also face large
deficits this year.
Many public and private universities
will be forced to cut student services, lay off
faculty, freeze salaries and merge depart
ments in upcoming years to reduce their
budgets and reprioritize spending.
Yale University faces an $8.8 million deficit
for the current fiscal year and is considering
closing its linguistics and operations research
departments, according to Kate Baicker, pres
ident of Yale's student government.
The university may also have to consoli
date the chemical, electrical and mechani
cal engineering departments into one and
decrease the number of faculty members,

Baicker said, adding that no final decisions
have been made yet.
If eliminated, departments will be
phased out over a 10-year period.
"No one will be fired," Baicker said.
"The cuts will be made through attrition."
Yale has also stopped serving dinner in
the Yale Commons, one of the main cam
pus cafeterias. Last spring, Yale eliminated
its varsity water polo and wrestling teams.
Yale's budget may also be strained by
the costs of upkeep and building mainte
nance. As much as $1 billion may be spent
in upcoming years for the preservation of
the campus' aging facilities.
Harvard University officials are current

1991-92, but final decisions have not yet
