# Colleges across country facing budget problems
## 
### June Fang 
Stanford is finding it is not alone in its
current budget crunch as universities from
Harvard to UC-Berkeley also face large
deficits this year.
Many public and private universities
will be forced to cut student services, lay off
faculty, freeze salaries and merge depart
ments in upcoming years to reduce their
budgets and reprioritize spending.
Yale University faces an $8.8 million deficit
for the current fiscal year and is considering
closing its linguistics and operations research
departments, according to Kate Baicker, pres
ident of Yale's student government.
The university may also have to consoli
date the chemical, electrical and mechani
cal engineering departments into one and
decrease the number of faculty members,

Baicker said, adding that no final decisions
have been made yet.
If eliminated, departments will be
phased out over a 10-year period.
"No one will be fired," Baicker said.
"The cuts will be made through attrition."
Yale has also stopped serving dinner in
the Yale Commons, one of the main cam
pus cafeterias. Last spring, Yale eliminated
its varsity water polo and wrestling teams.
Yale's budget may also be strained by
the costs of upkeep and building mainte
nance. As much as $1 billion may be spent
in upcoming years for the preservation of
the campus' aging facilities.
Harvard University officials are current
ly predicting an $11.7 million deficit for
1991-92, but final decisions have not yet
been made about what programs
to cut.
"Harvard has been conscien
tious about what they're trim
ming," said Student Body Presi
dent David Aronberg. "They're
cutting the fat instead of the mus
cle."
Columbia University is project
ing a $50 million deficit for 1992-
93, according to the Association of
American Universities. The short
fall may reach $86.9 million by
1994.
Public university systems are
also facing deficits. UC-Berkeley
increased tuition fees by 36 per
cent this year and eliminated 163
faculty positions. At Oregon State
University, tuition fees have
increased by 36 percent, and the
Mississippi system's costs could
jump 25 percent.
Most of these universities are
trying to reduce their budgets
through selective trimming,
rather than across-the-board cuts.
"The cutbacks are not random
ly made," Baicker said. "We keep
the strengths so that in the end,
the overall cuts shouldn't be as
devastating, I hope."
Administrators at several uni
versities not facing deficits say
they are redistributing funds.

Brown University budget
director Susan Hauitt said $8 mil
lion from academics, student sup
port services and administrative
services will be reallocated "to
preserve existing (academic) pro
grams.
"Colleges will no longer be
everything for everybody," Hauitt
said. "You have to see what you
do very well, preserve and build
up the things that are strong, but
consolidate or eliminate the weak
nesses."
A few schools, including Dart
mouth and Princeton do not have
immediate financial problems
because they have trimmed their
budgets in recent years.
Dartmouth Service Director
Alex Hupp£ said the university
will have a balanced budget for
the next fiscal year. Though there
have been "modest cuts" in the
past, "Dartmouth looks to be in
pretty sound financial shape," he
said.
"By paring back the proposed
budgets of past years and keeping
them in line with price indexes,
we have been able to keep costs
down," Hupp 6 said. "We also
managed growth during the
1980s very carefully."
Dartmouth reduced its faculty
and personnel by 75 positions
through attrition during the last
three years. Because of the lower
costs, tuition is increasing at its
lowest rate since 1965, while fees

at many other colleges are sky
rocketing, Huppe said.
Princeton University is also
financially stable compared to
other Ivy League schools, accord
ing to Steven Gill, the school's

manager of budget and indirect
cost analysis.
Gill said Princeton is "not in a
cost-cutting mode because we
have already made selective cuts
three years ago."

faculty positions. At Oregon State
University, tuition fees have
increased by 36 percent, and the
Mississippi system's costs could
jump 25 percent.
Most of these universities are
trying to reduce their budgets
through selective trimming,
rather than across-the-board cuts.
"The cutbacks are not random
ly made," Baicker said. "We keep
the strengths so that in the end,
the overall cuts shouldn't be as
devastating, I hope."
Administrators at several uni
versities not facing deficits say
they are redistributing funds.

Brown University budget
director Susan Hauitt said $8 mil
lion from academics, student sup
port services and administrative
services will be reallocated "to
preserve existing (academic) pro
grams.
"Colleges will no longer be
everything for everybody," Hauitt
said. "You have to see what you
do very well, preserve and build
up the things that are strong, but
consolidate or eliminate the weak
nesses."
A few schools, including Dart
mouth and Princeton do not have
immediate financial problems
because they have trimmed their
budgets in recent years.
Dartmouth Service Director
Alex Hupp£ said the university
will have a balanced budget for
the next fiscal year. Though there
have been "modest cuts" in the
past, "Dartmouth looks to be in
pretty sound financial shape," he
said.
"By paring back the proposed
budgets of past years and keeping
them in line with price indexes,
we have been able to keep costs
down," Hupp 6 said. "We also
managed growth during the
1980s very carefully."
Dartmouth reduced its faculty
and personnel by 75 positions
through attrition during the last
three years. Because of the lower
costs, tuition is increasing at its
lowest rate since 1965, while fees

at many other colleges are sky
rocketing, Huppe said.
Princeton University is also
financially stable compared to
other Ivy League schools, accord
ing to Steven Gill, the school's

manager of budget and indirect
cost analysis.
Gill said Princeton is "not in a
cost-cutting mode because we
have already made selective cuts
three years ago."
