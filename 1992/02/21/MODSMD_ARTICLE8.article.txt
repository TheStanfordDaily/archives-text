# The
						day's most important meal

The group of homeless men
gathered outside the Palo Alto
church are waiting for ATO
cook Roza Balint to fix them a
hot meal.
But Balint does more than
cook. She also provides the home

less people with a sympathetic ear.
"I usually stay one or two
hours to see if they want to talk
or if they have stories to tell. It
makes them happy to have
someone to listen," she said.
Balint, who has cooked for
students in ATO since last year,
prepares a special meal every

wee knight for the homeless peo
ple who stay at Trinity Luther
an Church in Palo Alto.
In addition, Balint said she
takes several trips per year to
larger communities such as San
Francisco. She will pack her car
with as much hot food and as
many plates, napkins, and uten
sils as it can carry.
She said she sets up in parks
with signs marked "Food for the
Homeless," and the people line
up by the hundreds. There are
often more people than plates,
Balint said, so she sometimes has
to serve food onto their hands.
The food comes from the
ATO house, which is located in
Cowell Cluster, and SPOON,
the on-campus program which
sends leftovers to the hungry.
Balint and her family immi
grated to the U.S. from Hungary
several years ago and finally set
tled in Mountain View after mov
ing around quite a lot. Balint
then started her food project.
"At first, we were too busy
with our own problems, but now
I have more time and I remem
ber how they helped us. I have
to give back," she said.
The men recognize Balint
immediately, and after exchang
ing greetings, begin talking
with her casually. A program
director unlocks the church door
and the men file in behind him.
They carry their belongings
and begin to set up their beds as
Balint lays the food out on the
counter: baked potatoes, a rice
casserole, fish with tartar sauce,
ham and cheese for sandwiches.
The men take a seat around the
table after helping themselves to
some of everything.
