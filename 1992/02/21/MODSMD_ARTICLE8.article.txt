# The 						day's most important meal
## 
### Kris McNeil 
The group of homeless men
gathered outside the Palo Alto
church are waiting for ATO
cook Roza Balint to fix them a
hot meal.
But Balint does more than
cook. She also provides the home

less people with a sympathetic ear.
"I usually stay one or two
hours to see if they want to talk
or if they have stories to tell. It
makes them happy to have
someone to listen," she said.
Balint, who has cooked for
students in ATO since last year,
prepares a special meal every

wee knight for the homeless peo
ple who stay at Trinity Luther
an Church in Palo Alto.
In addition, Balint said she
takes several trips per year to
larger communities such as San
Francisco. She will pack her car
with as much hot food and as
many plates, napkins, and uten
sils as it can carry.
She said she sets up in parks
with signs marked "Food for the
Homeless," and the people line
up by the hundreds. There are
often more people than plates,
Balint said, so she sometimes has
to serve food onto their hands.
The food comes from the
ATO house, which is located in
Cowell Cluster, and SPOON,
the on-campus program which
sends leftovers to the hungry.
Balint and her family immi
grated to the U.S. from Hungary
several years ago and finally set
tled in Mountain View after mov
ing around quite a lot. Balint
then started her food project.
"At first, we were too busy
with our own problems, but now
I have more time and I remem
ber how they helped us. I have
to give back," she said.
The men recognize Balint
immediately, and after exchang
ing greetings, begin talking
with her casually. A program
director unlocks the church door
and the men file in behind him.
They carry their belongings
and begin to set up their beds as
Balint lays the food out on the
counter: baked potatoes, a rice
casserole, fish with tartar sauce,
ham and cheese for sandwiches.
The men take a seat around the
table after helping themselves to
some of everything.
Many Palo Alto churches pro

sleep for a month at a time. At
Trinity Lutheran, the people
enrolled in the program can stay in
the church from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m.,
but are on their own for the day.
During that time they work or look
for jobs. Some are employed, b\it
need to save money in order to
afford housing in Palo Alto.
A man who has come here from
Oregon has been staying at the
church for almost three weeks. He
says he is a window-washer, but
hasn't worked for almost two
weeks because of all the recent
rain. He says he is 12 credits short
of his bachelor's degree in psy
chology, and describes a book he
plans to write about life in a trail
er park titled "All My Trailers."
The leftovers Balint uses
would have otherwise been
thrown away, but she said she
tries to make them exciting.
"You can make a very nice
meal even if it is only leftover
food. If you cut it nicely, it looks
and tastes better. My children eat
the same leftovers," she said.
Balint says she is very careful
to make sure that each meal is hot
and that there is plenty of food for
everyone. Her family often goes
along with her to serve the food
and talk with the people.
"I go with my family, and I'm
happy they see what I'm doing,"

Balint said.
Conversation among the men
shifts from Bill Walsh's salary to
cars. A TV set showing "Rambo"
glows in the corner, and several
men are already watching intent
ly. Some keep entirely to them
selves, eating in silence, while
others maintain a lively conversa
tion.
Balint chats with a younger
man in the corner who wears an
A's baseball cap and looks like he
could be a college student. They
talk about his job, and what is new
in both of their lives. He says he is
a house-painter, but doesn't get
enough work to rent a Palo Alto
apartment. He speaks of his plans
to go to college in the future and
possibly become a park ranger.
Balint said that when she
brings food the first few times to a
new group of people, they are very
hesitant about talking to her.
"The first time they hurt so
much, they don't want to talk,"
Balint said. "They have very inter
esting stories, but they need some
time. If I stay with them and they
get to know me, then they start to
talk and tell me their stories."
Two newcomers whose names
the director can't remember have
wandered in. They give their names
and he checks them off his list. They
put down their things and make
their way toward the kitchen.
The people who stay at Trinity
Lutheran can't treat the church like
they would a hotel; there are rules.
If anyone is found drinking or

using drugs they won't be allowed
to stay. They are only allowed to
stay for thirty days. Soon this
month will be over, and Balint will
have to say goodbye to this group.
Looking at their faces, there
are a few who seem like they mqy
have given up, but others talk of
big plans for their future and
appear to see the present situation
as little more than a temporary
inconvenience.
One man talks about his fami
ly, and how he believes that being
on his own is what's best for him
right now. "I'm getting to the
point where if they helped me out,
they really wouldn't be doing me
any good," he says.
While advocating the impor
tance of individuals doing all they
can to help the homeless situa
tion, Balint stresses the necessity
of knowing the limits of how
much others can do for a home
less person.
"Sometimes you can only give
food," she said. "You cannot help
people who have serious drinking
and drug problems. They need
special help."
Two men have now pulled their
chairs up to the television and
stare at the screen intently, while
one of the newcomers talks with
Balint about her family. After
everyone has finished eating, and
the conversation seems to be wind
ing down, Balint wishes everyone
a good night. All the men say
goodbye and compliment her on
the rice she brought.
