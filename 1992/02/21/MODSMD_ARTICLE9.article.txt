# Kosher Co-op to be named for Kennedys

The Kosher Co-op will be named after Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy and his wife
Robin Wednesday to acknowledge the couple's
contributions to Stanford's Jewish community.
Members of the community said that nam
ing the co-op, located in Elliott Program Cen
ter, after the Kennedys would be a fitting trib
ute to the president's leadership.
"Donald Kennedy has set the tone for how
the University meets the needs of specific groups
on campus, especially the Jewish community,
and it was altogether fitting that something be
named after him," said Rabbi Ari Cartun, direc
tor of Hillel, the Jewish student organization.
Robin Kennedy said the couple is "just
thrilled. We think it's quite wonderful."
Since becoming president, Kennedy has

been an advocate for the expansion of the Jew
ish studies program as well as the establish
ment of food alternatives like the co-op.
Robin Kennedy, who is Jewish, has been
chair of the Jewish Community Relations
Council and a member of the Hillel board. She
has been actively involved in promoting the
needs of Jewish staff and alumni.
"If there is only one thing that I could
accomplish being the president's wife around
here, if it is making Stanford more hospitable
to Jewish students, it will be a source of pride
for me," Robin Kennedy said. "It's ironic for
me because as an undergraduate, there was no
Jewish life. ... It's a real symbol of how dif
ferent it is."
Although Donald Kennedy is not Jewish,
co-op members decided to put his name before
Robin's because "the Robin and Donald

Kennedy" Kosher Co-op would sound like
Ronald McDonald's, according to David Bian
co, kitchen manager for the co-op.
"It's an honor, but it's also alliterative â€”
Kennedy Kosher Co-op," Robin Kennedy said.
The co-op, established in 1988, was created
to meet the dietary needs of Jewish students
on campus and to attract more Jewish stu
dents to the University. The average group for
Friday's traditional Shabbat meal is about 25,
while attendance swells to more than 50 dur
ing Passover.
The dedication ceremony will take place at
the co-op at 4:30 p.m. Wednesday. A tradition
al mezzuzah ceremony will also be held. A
mezzuzah is a good luck charm that is hung on
doors.
iioth Kennedys will speak, and Cartun will
give a blessing.
