discussing
Black Ice
Lorene Cary will read from and discuss
Black Ice, her insightful account of her
time as a scholarship student at the elite,
formerly all-white, all male St. Paul's
School in the early 1970'5. (just published
in paperback) "Probably the most
beautifully written and the most moving
African-American autobiographical
narrative since I Know Why
The Caged Bird Sings."
- Arnold Rampersad
