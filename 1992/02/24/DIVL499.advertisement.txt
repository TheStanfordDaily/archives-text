VISTA Volunteers share the vision of
a better tomorrow by making a
contribution in the community today.
Brighter futures take shape when
VISTA Volunteers mobilize and
develop community resources to
address the many faces of poverty.
After your college career is
completed, VISTA offers you the
opportunity to put your education to
work in realistic settings. VISTA
Volunteers learn life skills — skills
only a year of unique VISTA
experience can provide.
VISTA Volunteers are assigned to
project sponsors which may be private
or public non-profit organizations. Volunteer
activities may include, but are not limited to,

In addition to acquiring valuable
and rewarding experience, VISTA
Volunteers may receive deferment
or partial cancellation of certain
student loans. VISTA Volunteers
receive a living allowance based on
the economic level of the
communities they serve.
