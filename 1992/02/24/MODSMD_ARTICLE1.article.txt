# Silverberg won't be neurosurgery chair

### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
The Stanford doctor accused of sex
ist behavior by Medical School Prof.
Frances Conley announced Friday that
he has lost his position as acting chair of
the Medical School's Neurosurgery
Department and will not be considered
for the permanent position.
Neurosurgery Prof. Gerald Silver
berg said Dean David Korn and Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
demoted him Wednesday because "the
University couldn't stand any more
adverse publicity" in response to Con
ley's allegations that he demeaned and
propositioned her.
While he declined to comment on
the content of last week's meeting,
Kennedy said, "What Dr. Silverberg

has announced is his own decision,"
adding that Wednesday's meeting
"was the first of what I assume will
be" several discussions.
Korn could not be reached for com
ment yesterday.
Conley, who is also a neurosurgery
professor, received national media
attention last spring when she resigned
the day after Korn said he planned to
promote Silverberg from acting to per
manent chairman of the Neurosurgery
Department.
The announcement was made
shortly after Medical School adminis
trators said the school's $12 million
deficit forced them to call off a nation
al search for a permanent chair.
Last summer, a committee of four
Medical School faculty and staff mem
bers was formed to investigate Con

ley's allegations against Silverberg.
His permanent appointment was post
poned while the committee examined
the charges and produced a report.
The committee submitted its
report to Korn earlier this month, but
its contents have not been made pub
lic.
In an opinion piece that ran in
papers nationwide last June, Conley
detailed repeated episodes of sexism in
her 25 years at the Medical School,
including unwelcome propositions,
sexist remarks and fondling from Sil
verberg.
Insisting that she had no designs on
the position, Conley said last spring that
Silverberg was wrong for the job and
that he "devalues women and, for that
matter, anyone he perceives to be his
inferior."

In September, Conley announced
her decision to return to the Medical
School, saying she could do more to
fight sexism from within the Universi
ty than from outside it.
In response to Conley's allegations,
Silverberg said yesterday,"I don't feel
like I've done anything wrong."
He said he was demoted because
"the school has become very sensitive
to media pressure" and "Dr. Conley
had threatened to turn up the heat" at
the Medical School if changes were not
made.
Medical School spokesperson Spy
ros Andreopoulos said Conley declined
to comment yesterday.
Had he been on the other side of
the issue, Silverberg said, "I might


Silverberg 'devalues
women and, for that
matter, anyone he
perceives to be his
inferior.'

to pressure' to oust
Silverberg.
