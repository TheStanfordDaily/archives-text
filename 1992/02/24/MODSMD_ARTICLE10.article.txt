# Financial aid program: a student affair
## 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
Due to cuts in the Financial Aid Office's
budget, students will organize and fund this
year's Financial Aid Awareness Week.
The event, which begins today and actually
spans two weeks, consists of a series of forums
and open sessions addressing students' ques
tions and concerns about financial aid.
"I am convinced that if our office was not
here, there would be no Financial Aid Awareness
Week this year," said senior Vince Ricci, director
of the ASSU Financial Aid Advocacy Office.
According to Ricci, Cynthia Rife, the assis
tant director of the Financial Aid Office who
organized the event in the past, suffered an
injury and "is out (of the office) for the entire
month."

The office does not have the resources to
replace Rife temporarily, according to Ricci.
As a result, "we're doing this all on our own,"
he said.
The student group received assistance from
the Financial Aid Office in the form of sugges
tions for events to organize. Members of the
office staff will also be present at open sessions
to answer questions, Ricci said.
The rest of the work, however, is being
done by the group. The funding will come out
of the group's budget, which is set by the
ASSU Senate.
According to Ricci, the event will cost
approximately $200. "It seemed like a golden
opportunity to use the funds we've been allo
cated," he said. Ricci said he sees the event as
a "clear-cut example of why our office needs to
be here."

According to Ricci, the University loses
an estimated $100,000 every year because
students who qualify for Cal Grants but
do not apply for them on time. Cal Grants
are need-based grants for California resi
dents attending California schools.
Ricci said he is concerned about the lack of
student interest in financial aid. Students
worry about their own individual packages,
without linking their individual problems to
the overall picture, he said.
"I don't see many students making the sec
ond step," he said.
While the student group has been "effective
as a liaison," there is still a need to "empower
students to [address financial aid issues] on
their own," Ricci said, adding that he wants to
see students turn their concern "into a sort of
activism."
