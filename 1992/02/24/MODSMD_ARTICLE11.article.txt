# Communication dept. under fire
## Profs, resent deans' memo 
### Kristina Aberg Staff writer 
Communication professors are defending the
validity of their field in response to an administra
tion memo that said there is "some question" as to
whether the study of mass media is a "mainstream
scholarly endeavor" deserving of University funds in
a year of major budget cutbacks.
The memo — written by Ewart Thomas, dean of
the School of Humanities and Sciences, and Senior
Associate Dean Carolyn Lougee — was received angri
ly by some Communication professors, who wrote a
letter to Thomas last week saying they were "taken
aback" by the suggestion that their department is not
central to the University's scholastic mission.
Communication faculty said in interviews that
they are upset about being singled out and argued
that their department is misunderstood.
"No other field of study was targeted that way,"
said Communication Prof. Steven Chaffee, one of the
letter's co-signers. "We feel it is because people don't
know what we do."
Thomas and Lougee's Jan. 30 memo to faculty,
which detailed the school's budget plan, said there is
"some question... whether a communication program,
no matter how distinguished in the field, is of sufficient
importance to deserve University resources."
In an interview, Thomas said the question was
raised by critical faculty members and "is something
you are aware of if you are a dean in this office."
Early in the year, it had appeared that the depart
ment was a likely candidate for significant reduction
or closure.
But since the department is funded largely by its
own endowment, closing it would have produced few
economic gains, according to Thomas.
"We examined closing Communication and other
departments," he said. "We looked seriously at our
academic programs and in Communication we
looked hard at the resources and concluded that it
does a very good job," Thomas said.
Under the current proposal, the department
would have to come up with $350,000 of the School
of Humanities and Sciences' $5 million deficit reduc
tion target.
In an effort to explain the importance of mass
media, Chaffee and two colleagues, Department
Chair Donald Roberts and Prof. Byron Reeves, wrote
the emphasizing the discipline's importance.
They noted that many Stanford faculty specialize
in the study of mass media — including Provost
James Rosse, a media economist.
They also argued that universities including
Harvard, the University of Penn
sylvania and Princeton have pro
grams and entire schools devoted
to the study of mass media in
society and communications.
"Communication does not
have the prestige in Humanities
and Sciences afi history may
have," Roberts said, but while
"you may not be able to do
much with a master's degree in

history . . . there is a lot you can
do with a master's in journal
ism."
While the dean's office
acknowledges the apparently neg
ative sentiments within the
school, Thomas said, officials also
recognize that the department
has both strong scholars and an
excellent reputation.
Chaffee said the academic
requirements for the Communi
cation major at Stanford are more
rigorous than at other universi
ties.
"We resisted teaching pop cul

ture and insisted on being aca
demic," he said. "We teach our
students research methods and
how to think."
Communication faculty said
that emphasis has helped gradu
ates to rise quickly within their
fields.
Assoc. Communication Prof.
Jeremy Cohen said the depart
ment has over a 90 percent place
ment of its doctoral students into
tenured tracks at major universi
ties, higher than any other
department in Humanities and
Sciences.
