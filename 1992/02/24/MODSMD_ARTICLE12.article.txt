# Fasting former lecturer unconscious in St. Louis
## 
### Kristen Schmid Staff writer 
For 24 days, her only sustenance has
been water and cranberry juice. The 82-
year-old woman is now unconscious
most of the time in a St. Louis hospital.
A former visiting scholar at Stanford,
Katherine Dunham has deliberately
chosen to put her body in this condition.
This isn't an ordinary act, and she
isn't an ordinary woman.
Dunham became famous throughout
the world as a dancer, choreographer,
actress, writer, producer, composer,
educator and anthropologist. She is now
gaining fame for her hunger strike in
protest of President Bush's decision to
return Haitian refugees who fled to the
United States after the coup in their
country.
Her varied and impressive career
includes being a guest teacher at Stan
ford in 1989. She was brought to Stan
ford by the Committee on Black Per
forming Arts because of her wide range
of expertise, according to dance lecturer
Halifu Osumare.
As a visiting scholar at Stanford, she
taught dance and anthropology.
Because of Dunham's varied accom
plishments, many activities were orga
nized that were related to her work and
to dance in general.
These activities included exhibits
of her books and memorabilia, a dis
play of vintage costumes at Meyer
Library, a film series and demonstra
tions by her former dance company
members.
One of the ideas Dunham stressed in
her teachings at Stanford is that life
should be approached holistically.
"She feels the most important part of
being a whole person is to get back to
real, strong compassion for other
human beings," said Osumare.
Her strong belief in the interrelated
ness of all aspects of life is reflected in
her current political protest.
As Osumare explained, "for [Dun
ham] there is no separation between art,
culture and politics."
Osumare said the Haitians "taught her
how dancing related to everyday living.
She made her name presenting their cul

ture to academia.
She will give her
life to show that
what is happening
is unjust."
Earl Black,
African-American
Studies program
coordinator and a
member of the
committee that
brought Dunham
to Stanford, said
he thought the

Haitian issue was so important to Dun
ham because "she is protesting on
behalf of her people. It is very threat
ening to her to see this happen to them.
"The persecution of the Haitians is
the persecution of Katherine Dunham.
Her strength and their strength are
inseparable."
Dunham is requesting that people
supporting her cause join the hunger
strike or send telegrams to President
Bush, as she has already done.
Dunham's has strong ties to Haiti:
She did field work there for her thesis,
has known past presidents, has lived in
the country off and on for 50 years and
received some of the country's highest
honors, including the Legion of Honor
and Merit.
Dunham's work has never been com
pletely separated from politics.
"In the beginning of her career Dun
ham's objective was to bring African-
American and Caribbean culture to the
west," Black said. "She was the first
person to really do that — she used
dance as a political act."
"As a child, I felt Katherine Dun
ham's work did two things," Black said.
First of all, she "liberated black cul
ture by taking her dancing to the stage,"
he said.
"Secondly, black American women
learned through her to have freer rela
tionships with themselves. There was
persecution of women and sensuality,
and women were liberated by her
work.
They were freer with their bodies,
moves, postures — they were prouder. I
saw the impact she had on my mother's
generation."
