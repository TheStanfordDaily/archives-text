Brown, Tsongas in dead heat in Maine
PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Paul Tsongas and upstart Jerry
Brown battled to a virtual dead heat in Maine's caucuses yester
day in an improbably close contest that reflected the wide-open
race for the Democratic presidential nomination.
First one, then the other, held the lead during a long count — but
never by much. With 645 0f665 precincts reporting and the tally halt
ed, Tsongas had 29.5 percent support and Brown had 29.3 percent.
An uncommitted slate of delegates had 16 percent, Arkansas
Gov. Bill Clinton had 15 percent, and the rest of the field followed.
Predictably, Brown and Tsongas each claimed success. The
former California governor, who refuses contributions larger
than $100, claimed his showing proved that "grassroots citizens
can take back this country."
Tsongas brushed aside a suggestion that the Maine results were
a sign of a fragile candidacy, saying, "My fight is with Bill Clinton
at this point." Brown had finished last in New Hampshire.
Quayle gives up on Cuomo candidacy
WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President; Dan Quayle admitted
defeat yesterday in his efforts to entice New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo into the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Quayle, who had long predicted Cuomo would wind up as Pres
ident Bush's challenger this fall, said on NBC's "Meet The Press"
with a laugh, "I've given up. Mario is no longer my man.
"I was hoping that he would be the candidate," Quayle added.
"It would have been a classic confrontation between a good liber
al Democrat against a good conservative Republican."
Cuomo once objected to Quayle's calling him by his first name.
