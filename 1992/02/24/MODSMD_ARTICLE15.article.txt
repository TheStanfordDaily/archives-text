## Abortion nightmare 
### 
Case in Ireland reveals
frightening effects of
reversing Roe decision

A NIGHTMARE IN IRELAND
may become reality in some
U.S. states if the Supreme
Court overturns Roe vs. Wade, as it
appears increasingly likely to do.
The national media recently
reported the story of a 14-year-old
Irish rape victim who cannot get
an abortion in her country, or any
where else. In the process of press
ing charges against the rapist, she
let the Irish government — which
strictly prohibits abortion — know
that she was pregnant. Now she is
subject to an injunction barring
her from leaving the country.
The girl and her mother had
planned to go to England, where
abortion is legal. Before they left,
however, the two women inquired
as to whether the fetus would be
admissible as evidence in the rape
trial. The Irish government
responded by preventing her from
exiting the country, reasoning that
they must not let a citizen leave the
country to commit a crime — even
when the "crime" is not a crime
outside the country. As a result, the
girl must now carry and give birth
to a child conceived in rape.
At the present time, Roe vs.
Wade is all that prevents similar
tragedies from occurring in this
country.
By this time next year, the
Supreme Court will probably have
overturned the landmark 1973 deci
sion that gives women the right to
choose whether to have an abortion.
States will again have the power to
enact their own abortion legislation.
It is likely that many southern and
mid western states will take advan
tage of this power and either restrict
abortion or outlaw it entirely.
Some states may not allow
women to receive abortions in other
states. Even if they do, this does lit
tle for the women who don't have

the money to travel to other states.
Some states may not accept an
aborted fetus as evidence in a rape
case and may charge the rape vic
tim with murder if she goes ahead
and gets one anyway. These states,
just as in Ireland, will force a preg
nant rape victim to carry the child
in order to press charges against
the rapist. With all of the deter
rents that already exist for women
to report a rape, are we so ready to
add another one?
And even if the state's abortion
law makes exceptions for rape vic
tims, how will the state decide who is
and who is not a victim? If the rapist
must be tried and convicted before
the woman can have an abortion,
the woman must carry the child for
the duration of the trial. If the trial
goes beyond the time where it is no
longer possible to abort the fetus,
the exception becomes meaningless.
If the state does not require a
trial and conviction, the law in effect
encourages women to claim rape in
order to terminate an unwanted
pregnancy. What kind of warped
legal precedent would this set?
Political opponents of Roe vs.
Wade assert that an unborn child
should not be killed to erase the
mother's mistakes; pregnancy is the
consequence of the woman's bad
judgement.
However, it is not the mother's
mistake when she is raped, and it
is not the mother's mistake when
she is too young to understand the
consequences of her actions.
Those who will be most affected
by legislation banning abortion are
those who have the weakest politi
cal voice— teenagers and the poor.
Although the Supreme Court
will find that a right to privacy
does not exist within the Constitu
tion, it is imperative that Congress
puts one there. Roe vs. Wade does
rest on shaky ground, but the pro
choice argument is rock solid.
Instead of bemoaning the right
ward shift of the Supreme Court,
those who support the right to abor
tion should focus their efforts on pass
ing legislation that can prevent this
nightmare from becoming reality.
