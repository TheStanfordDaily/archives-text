Students should get involved with financial aid issue

1 WRITE TO SOUND AN ALARM
over the future of financial aid and to
encourage increased student activism
and involvement on this critical issue.
This has been and will continue to be
the most critical year for financial aid
policy at the University and federal lev
els in recent memory.
From the unreasonable 9.5 percent
tuit ion hike here at Stanford to President
Bush's support for new taxes for graduate
students, the situation looks grave. The
decision-making process in the case of the
tuition hike was disempowering and the
decision itself is very short-sighted.
Turning to federal issues, I applaud The
Daily's Feb. 12 article, "Bush's Financial
Aid Plan Raises Concerns," which touched
upon some of the primary bills which are
currently on the Congressional agenda.
If H.R. 127 is not passed, graduate stu

dents who receive a tuition waiver will
have to start paying taxes on that amount.
In 1986, Employee Educational Assistance
Benefits, which include fees paid by an
employer or by a university grant, to help
fund education, were made taxable.
However, Congress has annually allo
cated funds to continue to make the ben
efits tax exempt. These tax provisions
were extended until June 30, 1992. In
the next month, Congress will be hold
ing hearings to decide the future of the
benefits — i.e. whether or not to contin
ue the tax-exempt status.
President Bush has made it clear that
he will oppose the allocation of any
money unless Congress makes corre
sponding cuts to offset the cost of the
tax exemption. We must put pressure on
both the Congress and the President to
work out a compromise to ensure the

passage of H.R. 127. Come by the Finan
cial Aid Advocacy Office in the ASSU
and sign a letter today!
i For undergraduate students, the key
federal issue is reauthorization of the
higher education act — Pell Grant Enti
tlement being one of the main points of
debate. The Entitlement was proposed
in an effort to try to alleviate the loan
grant imbalance by appropriating a set
amount of money.
Grant funds would be guaranteed to
students annually as long as they ful
filled pre-existing standards of eligibility.
Funding would no longer come from the
discretionary fund of Congress, which
fluctuates each year according to Con
gressional decisions.
Unfortunately, many Congressmen
are pointing at financial constraints and
refusing to support the Entitlement. We

must make them see that unless we take
action now to help students obtain a
degree, the costs to our future national
productivity will be far greater.
In the long run, students can influ
ence the future of higher education. A
good place to start is the ASSU Finan
cial Aid Advocacy Office. We have letters
to sign and campaigns to work on. We
are organizing Financial Aid Awareness
Week from Feb. 24 through Mar. 5.
Look for ads in The Daily and flyers
around campus. We also have six posi
tions open for next year's advocacy
office. Come by the ASSU and pick up
an application. Financial aid is the stu
dent issue for the nineties. Join us.
