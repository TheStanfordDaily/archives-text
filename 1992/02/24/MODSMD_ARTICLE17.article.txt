# Comment on cheating was meant to be ironic
## 
### 
I write in response to Matthew Car
den's letter of Feb. 21 concerning remarks
attributed to me in the Feb. 13 Daily.
Last week, a gentleman introducing
himself as Matthew Carden phoned me
and asked me whether I had made the
remarks attributed to me, and if I "had
cheated throughout my entire career." I
was somewhat taken aback at Carden's
tone, as were the people in my office
when I received his call.
Unfortunately, in his letter to The
Daily, and in his phone call to me, Mr.
Carden seems to have taken my com
ments somewhat out of context, and
completely out of perspective.
Sadly, I cannot blame him for mistak
ing the intent of my remarks, as The
Daily saw fit to liberate them from their
original context. However, I had no con
trol over what The Daily printed.

Let me put into some perspective the
comment reported by The Daily. The
remark reported was an ironic remark
that I made at the end of a lengthy and
somewhat more serious conversation I
had with a Daily reporter two weeks
ago.
In that conversation, I pointed out
that I had encountered some cheating
at Stanford in the few years that I've
been here, but that, since I estimated
that only a very small percentage of the
students I have known were involved
and given the enormous pressure on
Stanford students to succeed, it was
surprising that I had not encountered
more.
In my experience, the mtyority of stu
dents in my classes had not cheated.
However, when I have been made aware
of incidents of cheating, it has angered
and frustrated me, both because it is
grossly unfair to the students who do
not cheat, and because it has been
extremely difficult to successfully isolate
and deal with incidents of cheating.

I have in mind one incident which hap
pened while I was teaching a large under
graduate statistics course. There, a mem
ber of the class reported cheating but was
reluctant to testify against the students
involved in any formal proceedings.
In the absence of evidence, I had no
option but to drop the matter.
To sum up: cheating happens at Stan
ford despite the best efforts of students
and faculty. The Honor Code is a bond
of trust between students and faculty,
but to the student who is willing to get
ahead (and such students, though maybe
rare, demonstrably exist) it affords great
opportunities to cheat. In pointing this
out, I am not endorsing cheating; I am
merely stating a fact that is difficult to
contest.
I am sorry that Carden was upset by
my remark. My ironic statement was
printed out of context in The Daily and
was certainly not intended to be taken
literally.
