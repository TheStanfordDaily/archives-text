# Prof's remarks won't have dangerous effect
## 
### 
I am writing in response to Matthew
Carden's Feb. 21 letter regarding Asst.
Statistics Prof. Michael Martin's opin
ions in the cheating statistics article.
He suggested that Martin's remarks
will have a detrimental effect on morale
at Stanford and requested that Martin
amend his statements.
I disagree with his views. I believe the
effect on morale would be minimal, if
not nil, considering that the comments
were clearly intended to be cynical.
Martin's eclectic sense of humor is well
known around campus and I hope most
students would have enough sense to eryoy
what little media coverage he receives.
Anyhow, not even a freshman would be
so naive as to base moral decisions on a lit
eral interpretation of the cynical remarks.
