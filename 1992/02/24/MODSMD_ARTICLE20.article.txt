## Can Tsongas tsprout claws? 
### 
AS THE DUST SETTLES ON the
nation's excuse for making a moun
tain out of a molehill, Bill Clinton
exits the New Hampshire Democratic pri
mary and heads to the South as the man to
beat in the race for his party's nomination.
The Arkansas governor's spin machine
feasted on the not-so-whopping 25 percent
of the vote he tallied in the Granite State,
happy (after three weeks of negative pub
licity) to receive any good news at all.
Anticipating greater success in states
closer to home, Clinton proclaimed him
self "the comeback kid" and raced off to
spend the satchels of money his cam
paign has raised.
Meanwhile, more dust now covers New
Hampshire's only swimming pool as for
mer Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas
takes his butterfly stroke to Delaware,
Maryland and the rest of the lobster-eating,
almost-but-not-quite New England area.
It was syndicated columnist George
Will who in April 1988 (several months
before George Bush began attacking
Michael Dukakis with the L-word) point
ed out that only two things come from
Massachusetts: lobsters and liberals.
Evidently, recalling the lack of success
one of the latter types met with four
years ago, Tsongas has taken to the
waters every day in the hope of sprouting
claws that may better propel him toward
the Oval Office.
Tsongas has an image problem. Con

ventional wisdom tells voters that he's not
electable. He's the second act of the short-
Greek-Democrat-from-Massachusetts
play. So, voting for him is a waste since he
has no shot at beating President Bush:
Tsongas is too deferential, has no presence
and would be the perfect wimpy foil for
Roger Ailes' campaign machine.
As a result, some Democrats — the
good sheep that we are — are afraid to
support Tsongas. The more we hear, the
more we are impressed with his ideas,
but he can't win so we have to vote for
someone else.
"Uh, I like him, but I just dunno if he
can win. So I think I'll vote for that other
guy. Shame, though, I really like that
Tuh-songas guy."
As for Clinton, he has problems of his
own. For every voter who cast a ballot for
him in New Hampshire, there was anoth
er voter who in an exit poll said he or she
absolutely would not vote for him in
November. And in at least the last seven
elections, no one has been elected presi
dent without having first won in New
Hampshire.
In addition, a New York Times/CBS
news poll late last week bore more bad
news: Clinton's disapproval rating
among Democratic primary voters is
nearly twice as high as Tsongas' (16 per
cent as opposed to 9 percent). Their
approval ratings are the same (33 per
cent).

And when registered voters from all
parties were asked about hypothetical
races against Bush, Clinton lost by 11
percentage points, while Tsongas lost by
only seven.
What's significant about these num
bers is that while Clinton may be the man
to beat among the Democrats, he will also
likely be the man to be beaten by Bush in
the fall.
The campaign has now entered its so
called Tarmac stage — named for the can
didates' high-speed racing through more
than 20 states in less than three weeks,
and Clinton has a major advantage.
His promises of a middle-class tax cut
sound great in small doses and will be
effective since most voters consider
themselves a part of that nebulous demo
graphic and won't have time to get to
know the candidates the way they were
able to in New Hampshire.
Odds are Clinton will have the race won
by the end of March. But not to vote for
Tsongas in a primary because he isn't like
ly to win becomes a self-fulfilling prophe
cy. Sure, a lot of people in fact vote that
way, but that doesn't mean you should.
