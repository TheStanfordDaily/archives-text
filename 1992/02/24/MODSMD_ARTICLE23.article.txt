"The Huns used to ride
their horses to death, and
when they were thirsty, they
would stop and slit the
horses' veins and drink the
blood. I would like to see a
different attitude toward the
faculty by the administra
tion and the deans."
â€” German Prof. Oerald
Gillespie, on the faculty 's
attitude toward the adminis
tration. Gillespie is unhappy
with a decision to consoli
date at least five language
and literature departments.
