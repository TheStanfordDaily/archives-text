## Defeat from the hands of victory... Men lose at USC 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - Al
though the men's basketball
team had already blown upset
opportunities against No. 2
UClj\ and No. 5 Arizona, those
disappointments could not
emotionally prepare the Cardi
nal for Saturday's stupendous
self-destruction.

Men's basketball

Trojans 73

Cardinal 72 (OT)

Stanford led No. 15 USC 62-
54 and had the ball with 1:40
remaining, but the Trojans
came from behind to win 73-72
in overtime at the L.A. Sports
Arena.
"We blew it, no doubt about
it," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery, who continually
shook his head in frustration
as he left the court."It was our
game to win, and we just gave
it to them."
The Cardinal never trailed
in regulation and had whipped
the Trojans for 38 minutes, but
then things went haywire.
Stanford turned it over twice in
the final 30 seconds of regula
tion and two more times in the
last 30 seconds of overtime,
blowing every composure fuse
on the squad.
"Some people didn't want to
handle the ball when it was
time to handle it," Mont
gomery said. "We made some
really screwball turnovers
toward the end of the game. All
we had to do was run the clock
and shoot free throws and it
was over."
Instead, Stanford commit
ted a season-high 23 turnovers
and shot an embarrassing 6 of
17 from the free throw line.
Most of the mistakes were con
densed into the final two min
utes and overtime.
The battle left both teams
emotionally exhausted. While

Stanford assistant Doug Oliver
punched a metal barrier out
side the locker room, USC
coach George Raveling cried
throughout the post-game
interview.
"If there was ever a time in
coaching when I reached back
to my heritage, it was today,"
said Raveling, who compared
the drama of the game to his
travails as an African-Ameri
can. "Here we are 19-4, but
nobody knows the troubles I
have seen. I'm just really proud
of my kids. Just really proud."
With an 11-2 record in the
Pacific 10 Conference and a
game left against first-place
UCLA, USC still has a chance
at the conference title. Stan
ford is now 14-8 and tied for
fourth with Arizona State at 6-
6.
With Brent Williams hound
ing USC super-scorer Harold
Miner (33 points on just 11-for
-33 shooting) and Keefe domi
nating the paint (27 points, 18
rebounds), Stanford jumped
out to a 10-2 lead and was
cruising to the apparent win.
But with two minutes left
Stanford lost its head.
Peter Dukes missed a 3-
pointer with 1:35 left, then
fouled Rodney Chatman as the
Trojan nailed a trey. The four
point play quickly cut Stan
ford's lead to 62-58.
Williams was fouled with
1:02 left and made one of two
free throws, but Chatman
answered with another three
pointer over Dukes. After
a USC timeout, Keefe in
bounded from the backcourt to
Paul Garrett. As Keefe ran up
court, Garrett threw the ball
back to him. But Keefe wasn't
looking for the pass and it
bounced off his shoulder out of
bounds. In two seconds Stan
ford had turned it over.
Miner hit a 17-foot fade
away jumper with 32 seconds
left to tie the game 63-63, giv
ing Stanford a final possession
to win the game.
