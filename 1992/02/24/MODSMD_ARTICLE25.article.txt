## Defeat from the hands of victory... Men lose at USC 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - Al
though the men's basketball
team had already blown upset
opportunities against No. 2
UClj\ and No. 5 Arizona, those
disappointments could not
emotionally prepare the Cardi
nal for Saturday's stupendous
self-destruction.

Men's basketball

Trojans 73

Cardinal 72 (OT)

Stanford led No. 15 USC 62-
54 and had the ball with 1:40
remaining, but the Trojans
came from behind to win 73-72
in overtime at the L.A. Sports
Arena.
"We blew it, no doubt about
it," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery, who continually
shook his head in frustration
as he left the court."It was our
game to win, and we just gave
it to them."
The Cardinal never trailed
in regulation and had whipped
the Trojans for 38 minutes, but
then things went haywire.
Stanford turned it over twice in
the final 30 seconds of regula
tion and two more times in the
last 30 seconds of overtime,
blowing every composure fuse
on the squad.
"Some people didn't want to
handle the ball when it was
time to handle it," Mont
gomery said. "We made some
really screwball turnovers
toward the end of the game. All
we had to do was run the clock
and shoot free throws and it
was over."
Instead, Stanford commit
ted a season-high 23 turnovers
and shot an embarrassing 6 of
17 from the free throw line.
Most of the mistakes were con
densed into the final two min
utes and overtime.
The battle left both teams
emotionally exhausted. While

Stanford assistant Doug Oliver
punched a metal barrier out
side the locker room, USC
coach George Raveling cried
throughout the post-game
interview.
"If there was ever a time in
coaching when I reached back
to my heritage, it was today,"
said Raveling, who compared
the drama of the game to his
travails as an African-Ameri
can. "Here we are 19-4, but
nobody knows the troubles I
have seen. I'm just really proud
of my kids. Just really proud."
With an 11-2 record in the
Pacific 10 Conference and a
game left against first-place
UCLA, USC still has a chance
at the conference title. Stan
ford is now 14-8 and tied for
fourth with Arizona State at 6-
6.
With Brent Williams hound
ing USC super-scorer Harold
Miner (33 points on just 11-for
-33 shooting) and Keefe domi
nating the paint (27 points, 18
rebounds), Stanford jumped
out to a 10-2 lead and was
cruising to the apparent win.
But with two minutes left
Stanford lost its head.
Peter Dukes missed a 3-
pointer with 1:35 left, then
fouled Rodney Chatman as the
Trojan nailed a trey. The four
point play quickly cut Stan
ford's lead to 62-58.
Williams was fouled with
1:02 left and made one of two
free throws, but Chatman
answered with another three
pointer over Dukes. After
a USC timeout, Keefe in
bounded from the backcourt to
Paul Garrett. As Keefe ran up
court, Garrett threw the ball
back to him. But Keefe wasn't
looking for the pass and it
bounced off his shoulder out of
bounds. In two seconds Stan
ford had turned it over.
Miner hit a 17-foot fade
away jumper with 32 seconds
left to tie the game 63-63, giv
ing Stanford a final possession
to win the game.
This time Stanford held
onto the ball 12 seconds before
Miner grabbed it out of Garrett's
hands. Marcus Lollie fouled Trojan
guard Duane Cooper in a three-on
one break at the other end, and the
Trojans had two chances to win
with 16 seconds left.
Cooper bricked both free
throws, but following form, Stan
ford could not get the rebound.
Dukes dove on the floor to tie up a
jump ball, but it was Troy's turn

on the alternating possession.
Cooper drilled the front rim with
a buzzer jumper, extending the
game to overtime.
Stanford led three times in
overtime, but couldn't hold onto
the ball the final 30 seconds.
Dukes and Cooper exchanged 3-
pointers and the game was tied
69-69 with 36 seconds left.
Lollie turned it over
in the backcourt and Miner scored
a layup with 24 seconds left.
Frantic and down 71-69, Stanford
raced down court and Lollie and
Williams both hurled three-point
ers. Both shots mis-fired, but

Stanford grabbed two offensive
rebounds and called timeout with
7.5 seconds left.
II: Keefe's in-bound
pass to Lollie squirted through
his hands and out of bounds,
Stanford's 23rd turnover.
Miner made two free throws
with four seconds left to secure
the win. Although Dukes sank a
trey at the buzzer, the emotional
roller coaster was finally finished.
"We played a great game and
didn't win," said Keefe. "We're a
young team and we made a lot of
young plays down the stretch."
"People were just real down.

Even though we were still up four
or five, there was no confidence,"
he said. "It was a slow bombard
ment, but we looked at it like the
world was falling on us."
Musical Note
The Stanford Band sounded a posi
tive note on an 0-2 trip by performing
at both games and giving the team a
ride home from the airport. The band
provided much-needed comic relief on
the plane and sang happy birthday to
Keefe, who turned 22 Saturday. When
the team bus wouldn't start at the air
port, players and coaches piled in with
the ebullient band for the ride home.
