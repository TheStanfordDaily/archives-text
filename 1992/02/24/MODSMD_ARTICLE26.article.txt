# Champs again! Tennis takes Indoors
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
If there was any doubt as to the legitimacy of the
Cardinal's No. 3 ranking, the men's tennis team
killed it this weekend when they rolled to victory at
the National Indoor Intercollegiate Team Champi
onships in Louisville, Ky.
Solidly defeating No. 13 Harvard 4-2, No. 11
Georgia 6-3, second-ranked USC 4-2 in the semis
and sixth-ranked Texas Christian 5-1 in the finals,
Stanford's two seniors and four sophomores proved
that they are not to be taken lightly this season.
"We hung in there together and stayed with it,"
summed up assistant coach John Whitlinger. "I'm
really proud of them. They were always trying to
find a way to win."
In Friday's match against the Bulldogs, four of
the six singles matches lasted three sets. Alex
O'Brien and Chris Cocotos came out on top while
Michael Flanagan and Jason Yee lost their close
three-setters. Tied at 3-3, the teams went into dou
bles play where the Cardinal swept all three match
es. In an effort to save time, doubles matches were
only played if the teams tied in singles.
Saturday, the men faced perhaps their toughest
opponent, southern rival USC. However, the Tro
jans were without their top singles player, Brian
MacPhie, who was resting a sore elbow. The Cardi
nal triumphed once again when Cocotos won a third
set tiebreaker to clinch the win. O'Brien, Flanagan
and Vimal Patel won in straight sets.
In Sunday's final round, the Cardinal faced a
merciless bunch of Horned Frogs who had trounced
top-seeded UCLA in the semis. Within minutes, the
Texas men were crushing the Cardinal. "They came
out and started so well it was a joke," Whitlinger
said. "But our guys bided their time, hoping that the
other team would come back." And sure enough, the
Cardinal men were soon walking off the courts, vic
torious.
"The guys did extremely well," praised head
coach Dick Gould. "I can't say enough about
Michael's fight and concentration." Flanagan won in
straight sets with two tiebreakers. O'Brien also won
in straight sets over No. 16 Tony Bujan. Both
O'Brien and Patel won every one of their matches at
first and sixth singles, respectively. Robert Devens
and Yee won their matches in three long sets while
No. 49 Luis Ruette squeaked by Cocotos in the third.
Yee showed incredible determination by coming
back to win after he had lost his first three matches
and been down 0-5 in the first set of the finals.
Referring to this tough match, Coach Gould said,
"That's the kind of fight we'll need to be good con
tenders at the end of the season.
"This was not an easy tournament but you have
to keep in mind that USC was playing without Brian
(MacPhie) and TCU does better on slower surfaces.
We did a great job though — the guys responded in
doubles and in many close singles matches."
The 8-0 Cardinal returns home this week to chal
lenge the California Bears and the Cal State-Irvine
Anteaters. With a solid effort the men should
improve their record to a perfect 10-0. In honor of
fan appreciation, admission will be free with stu
