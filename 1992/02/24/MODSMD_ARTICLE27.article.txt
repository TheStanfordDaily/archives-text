# No. 6 cagers destroy WSU

Among Stanford women's basketball fans,
there has been an unspoken but palpable con
sciousness of the absence of an All-American at
either guard position. But the backcourt's 42-
point performance in the No. 6 Cardinal's 86-63
fire-bombing of Washington State demon
strates just how much the current Stanford

Cardinal 86

Cougars 63

guards have come into their own.
While the Cougars clamped down on Stan
ford's post players, often double and triple
teaming center Val Whiting, Christy Hedgpeth
led a three-point scoring barrage in the first half
to help the Cardinal to a 13-point halftime lead.
Despite an offensive letdown in the second
period, Stanford played tight enough defense to
extend its lead to as much as 28 before the final
minutes.
"You have just witnessed what a Final Four
caliber team can do, when you work hard to
take away its strength, and others step up to do
what it takes to win," said Washington State
coach Harold Rhodes.
"Give credit to Harold, though," said Stan
ford coach Tara VanDerveer. "A lot of teams
would have just gone one-on-one with Val and
let her kill them."
But Rhodes knew what he had to do to stop
the All-America candidate. He just didn't have
the answers for Stanford's perimeter play.
"It was important for Hedgpeth to step up
because the two people who hurt us the most in
Washington were Val and (Rachel) Hemmer, so
we were concentrating on stopping them," he
said.
The Cougars had some success, holding
Whiting and Hemmer to a combined 18 points
on 5-of-20 shooting. But the two big players still
managed to grab a total of 18 boards, and they
also combined for five blocks.
Hedgpeth scored 16 of her game-high 18
points in the first half, when she went 5-for-5
from the field and 3-for-3 from beyond the
magic rainbow. Three other Cardinal players lit
it up from outside as well, as Stanford shot 8-
for-11 on three-pointers in the first period.

Val Whiting gets physical in Saturday's 86-63 shellacking of Washington State. With the
Cougars intent on stopping Whiting and fellow paintwoman Rachel Hemmer, the Stan
ford backcourt hit for 42 points.
"We just had some players who
got brain cramps and left their men
open," Rhodes said.
But Hedgpeth was only the van
guard of the Cardinal guard attack.
With Molly Goodenbour in early foul
trouble (but still able to hit 4-of-8
treys), freshman Tanda Rucker
found herself on the floor more than
usual. She responded with a career
high 11 points, five rebounds, four
assists and four steals.

Hedgpeth also helped fill in for
Goodenbour's absence. She dished
out seven assists and pilfered the
ball twice.
The Cardinal finished the game
10-for-19 from beyond the three
point arc, one trey short of the
school record set in the NCAA Final
against Auburn two years ago — a
reminder of a great but bygone era.
Yes, Virginia, there is life after
Jennifer Azzi. And it's not solely
because of Val Whiting. Azzi had
help, and so does Whiting. Stan
ford's backcourt has found a new
age of glory, and perhaps, the key
to another national championship.
