# Women wondrous in Wild West wins
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
In the spirit of the old West,
the 1992 version of the six-shoot
ers blew away Arizona and Ari
zona State.
The Stanford women's tennis
team tamed the Wildcats 5-1 on
Friday. "We expected a titanic
match, but we pounded them
pretty good and got out of town,"
said Coach Frank Brennan.
The following day, the No. 9
Sun Devils started the showdown
with guns blazing. Arizona State
took the first set in four of six
singles contests before Stanford
stormed back to win every match.
"They came out smoking and
we were flat," Brennan said.
"[The match] was a good gut
check. The girls learned they
could win in three sets."
That victory, combined with
the conquest of No. 7 Arizona,
pushes No. 5 Stanford to 8-0.
With the wins, the team has over
come the first big obstacle of the
season — three straight matches
versus top-10 squads. The Cardi
nal beat No. 8 California last
week.
Initially, the Arizona State
match looked far from a 6-0
shutout. In all contests — except
the two involving Heather Wil
lens and Kylie Johnson — the
Sun Devils quickly took the
upper hand by winning the first
set.
"They looked good," Brennan
said. "I was thinking it would be
nice to go 3-3 (in singles) and take
them out in doubles."
Stanford got a boost as John
son, the only player to fall at Ari
zona, dominated Meredith Geiger
6-3, 6-4 in the No. 3 singles slot.
Meanwhile, Willens was
embroiled in a long three-setter
with the Sun Devils' Krista
Amend at No. 1.
"At the beginning she was
missing balls at the end of points.
Then I let up and she started
playing well," Willens said. "It
came down to who was tougher."
The Cardinal junior gutted out a
6-3, 3-6, 7-5 victory.
Laxmi Poruri and Kristine

Kurth, competing at No. 2 and
No. 4 singles respectively, lost
their first sets 6-1. They
rebounded with identical scores
of 6-3, 6-4 to win the contests.
Kurth, returning from a
month layoff due to a back strain,
played singles in dual matches for
the first time this season. She
said the break from competition
affected her mentally more than
physically.
"Going into the matches I
wasn't really nervous but I want
ed to concentrate and win for the
team," Kurth said.
Against Arizona State's Luann
Klimchock, Kurth had problems
staying focused. "I felt my con
centration lapse ... it was 6-1 in
about two minutes. I wanted to
play aggressive and attack but
what I did was hit the ball about
1,000 feet out," she said. "Coach
told me to relax, calm down and
get the ball in the court."
Gaining consistency, Kurth
pulled out the match in three
sets. At No. 5 singles Emma
Woodhouse dropped the first set
6-4 to Joelle Schad. The Cardinal
sophomore roared back to take
the match with two 6-2 sets.
Amy Chiminello tallied a simi
lar score, losing a close first set 7-
5. Like Woodhouse, she stormed
to victory with second and third
set blowouts, 6-1, 6-2.
Chiminello and Woodhouse
led Stanford in dominant wins
against Arizona. Beth Choate
managed only one game versus
Chiminello and Allison Grace lost
to Woodhouse 6-1,6-1.
Willens conquered hard-hit
ting Danielle Scott 6-4, 6-2. "I got
on top early and tied her down,"
Willens said. "She's a streaky
player. With players like that you
can't let them get hot. You've got
to get them off their game right
away."
Poruri crushed Banni Redhair
6-2,6-2. The Wildcats' Alix Creek
defeated Johnson 6-3, 6-1. Kurth
notched a 6-3, 6-4 victory over
Erica O'Neill. No doubles match
es were played.

the conquest of No. 7 Arizona,
pushes No. 5 Stanford to 8-0.
With the wins, the team has over
come the first big obstacle of the
season — three straight matches
versus top-10 squads. The Cardi
nal beat No. 8 California last
week.
Initially, the Arizona State
match looked far from a 6-0
shutout. In all contests — except
the two involving Heather Wil
lens and Kylie Johnson — the
Sun Devils quickly took the
upper hand by winning the first
set.
"They looked good," Brennan
said. "I was thinking it would be
nice to go 3-3 (in singles) and take
them out in doubles."
Stanford got a boost as John
son, the only player to fall at Ari
zona, dominated Meredith Geiger
6-3, 6-4 in the No. 3 singles slot.
Meanwhile, Willens was
embroiled in a long three-setter
with the Sun Devils' Krista
Amend at No. 1.
"At the beginning she was
missing balls at the end of points.
Then I let up and she started
playing well," Willens said. "It
came down to who was tougher."
The Cardinal junior gutted out a
6-3, 3-6, 7-5 victory.
Laxmi Poruri and Kristine

Kurth, competing at No. 2 and
No. 4 singles respectively, lost
their first sets 6-1. They
rebounded with identical scores
of 6-3, 6-4 to win the contests.
Kurth, returning from a
month layoff due to a back strain,
played singles in dual matches for
the first time this season. She
said the break from competition
affected her mentally more than
physically.
"Going into the matches I
wasn't really nervous but I want
ed to concentrate and win for the
team," Kurth said.
Against Arizona State's Luann
Klimchock, Kurth had problems
staying focused. "I felt my con
centration lapse ... it was 6-1 in
about two minutes. I wanted to
play aggressive and attack but
what I did was hit the ball about
1,000 feet out," she said. "Coach
told me to relax, calm down and
get the ball in the court."
Gaining consistency, Kurth
pulled out the match in three
sets. At No. 5 singles Emma
Woodhouse dropped the first set
6-4 to Joelle Schad. The Cardinal
sophomore roared back to take
the match with two 6-2 sets.
Amy Chiminello tallied a simi
lar score, losing a close first set 7-
5. Like Woodhouse, she stormed
to victory with second and third
set blowouts, 6-1, 6-2.
Chiminello and Woodhouse
led Stanford in dominant wins
against Arizona. Beth Choate
managed only one game versus
Chiminello and Allison Grace lost
to Woodhouse 6-1,6-1.
Willens conquered hard-hit
ting Danielle Scott 6-4, 6-2. "I got
on top early and tied her down,"
Willens said. "She's a streaky
player. With players like that you
can't let them get hot. You've got
to get them off their game right
away."
Poruri crushed Banni Redhair
6-2,6-2. The Wildcats' Alix Creek
defeated Johnson 6-3, 6-1. Kurth
notched a 6-3, 6-4 victory over
Erica O'Neill. No doubles match
es were played.
The Cardinal begins the
National Team Indoor Champi
onships Thursday.
