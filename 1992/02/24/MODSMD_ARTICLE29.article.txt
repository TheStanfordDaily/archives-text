# Batsmen battle Rainbow warriors, come away with 2 of 3
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team spent
the weekend in Hawaii, and it looks like
they came away with more than just
sand in their pockets and leftover Cop
pertone in their belly-buttons. In a bat
tle of two top-20 teams, the No. 8 Car
dinal won the series with No. 15 Hawaii
by taking two out of three games from
the Rainbows.
And the Cardinal did it in an unac
customed way — with hitting. Although
Stanford pitchers put in their regularly
excellent performances, it was timely
and ample batting which got it done for
the Cardinal.

In the first game on Friday, Stanford
absolutely slaughtered the Rainbows at
the plate, getting 16 hits to Hawaii's
eight, and defeating the Rainbows 16-4.
The Cardinal didn't even need all those
runs, thanks to hurler Willie Adams.
After starter Brian Sackinsky went only
two and a third innings and got touched
for four runs, Adams came in and fin
ished the game by shutting Hawaii out
for the final six and two-thirds innings
to get his second win.
Big games at the plate came from
just about everyone. Jeffrey Hammonds
had four hits, including a triple, and a
stolen base. Dave Cornell had three
hits, and Chris Kemper, in his new posi
tion at third base, had two hits and four

RBI. There was even a rare show of
Stanford power hitting when senior
first baseman David Holbrook hit a
home run.
Saturday proved to be more of a Car
dinal type game, a pitchers' duel pro
ducing a one run win as Stanford pre
vailed 3-2. Junior Rick Helling showed
that he is quickly becoming another
part of Stanford's history of great pitch
ers. Helling pitched eight and two
thirds innings, giving up only two runs
on eight hits, striking out nine. Aaron
Dorlarque came in to get the final out to
record the save.
Stanford had a great day at the plate
on Saturday as well, getting 10 hits.
The Card started out early, getting two

runs in the top of the first on a Cornell
single, a Dusty Allen double, and a
Mark Skeels single, respectively. How
ever, the Rainbows came back in the
second with an answering two runs, and
it remained all knotted up until the
eighth. In the top of the inning, the
Hawaii found that they had allowed the
bases full, and were facing pesky hitter
Jeff DesJardins at the plate. Rather
than give the sophomore second base
man something to hit, Rainbow pitcher
Craig Tucker pitched out of the strike

third and winning run as the Rainbows
failed to score again.
But Sunday, Hawaii found the magic
which gave them 51 wins last year, as
they used superb pitching to beat the
Cardinal 4-0. Stanford batters were
struck out an amazing 11 times by
Rainbow starter Scott Karl, who
allowed only five hits in his complete
game victory. Cardinal starter Jamie

Outfielder David Cornell slides into second base safely in Sunken Diamond action. Cornell was instrumental in Stanford's
success against No. 15 Hawaii this weekend, going 5 for 12 in the series with four runs scored and a pair of stolen bases.
Stanford pitching allowed only
three Hawaiian hits. But the Car
dinal allowed the Rainbows plen
ty of baserunners with an excess
of errors, bases-on-balls, and hit
batsmen.
In all, it was a pretty success
ful weekend for Stanford base
ball. Dominant Stanford pitching
continued to evidence itself,
allowing only eight runs in 26
innings pitched for an very good

.307 team ERA. And more impor
tantly, Stanford is beginning to
show its head at the plate, getting
an incredible 31 hits. And doing
all this against a ranked team,
the Card can surely be happy
with their performance in par
adise, including the 81 AGT
(average gametime temperature).

absolutely slaughtered the Rainbows at
the plate, getting 16 hits to Hawaii's
eight, and defeating the Rainbows 16-4.
The Cardinal didn't even need all those
runs, thanks to hurler Willie Adams.
After starter Brian Sackinsky went only
two and a third innings and got touched
for four runs, Adams came in and fin
ished the game by shutting Hawaii out
for the final six and two-thirds innings
to get his second win.
Big games at the plate came from
just about everyone. Jeffrey Hammonds
had four hits, including a triple, and a
stolen base. Dave Cornell had three
hits, and Chris Kemper, in his new posi
tion at third base, had two hits and four

RBI. There was even a rare show of
Stanford power hitting when senior
first baseman David Holbrook hit a
home run.
Saturday proved to be more of a Car
dinal type game, a pitchers' duel pro
ducing a one run win as Stanford pre
vailed 3-2. Junior Rick Helling showed
that he is quickly becoming another
part of Stanford's history of great pitch
ers. Helling pitched eight and two
thirds innings, giving up only two runs
on eight hits, striking out nine. Aaron
Dorlarque came in to get the final out to
record the save.
Stanford had a great day at the plate
on Saturday as well, getting 10 hits.
The Card started out early, getting two

runs in the top of the first on a Cornell
single, a Dusty Allen double, and a
Mark Skeels single, respectively. How
ever, the Rainbows came back in the
second with an answering two runs, and
it remained all knotted up until the
eighth. In the top of the inning, the
Hawaii found that they had allowed the
bases full, and were facing pesky hitter
Jeff DesJardins at the plate. Rather
than give the sophomore second base
man something to hit, Rainbow pitcher
Craig Tucker pitched out of the strike

Victor Cheng — Daily file
Outfielder David Cornell slides into second base safely in Sunken Diamond action. Cornell was instrumental in Stanford's
success against No. 15 Hawaii this weekend, going 5 for 12 in the series with four runs scored and a pair of stolen bases.
Stanford pitching allowed only
three Hawaiian hits. But the Car
dinal allowed the Rainbows plen
ty of baserunners with an excess
of errors, bases-on-balls, and hit
batsmen.
In all, it was a pretty success
ful weekend for Stanford base
ball. Dominant Stanford pitching
continued to evidence itself,
allowing only eight runs in 26
innings pitched for an very good

.307 team ERA. And more impor
tantly, Stanford is beginning to
show its head at the plate, getting
an incredible 31 hits. And doing
all this against a ranked team,
the Card can surely be happy
with their performance in par
adise, including the 81 AGT
(average gametime temperature).
The Stanford baseball team spent
the weekend in Hawaii, and it looks like
they came away with more than just
sand in their pockets and leftover Cop
pertone in their belly-buttons. In a bat
tle of two top-20 teams, the No. 8 Car
dinal won the series with No. 15 Hawaii
by taking two out of three games from
the Rainbows.
And the Cardinal did it in an unac
customed way — with hitting. Although
Stanford pitchers put in their regularly
excellent performances, it was timely
and ample batting which got it done for
the Cardinal.

tion at third base, had two hits and four

RBI. There was even a rare show of
Stanford power hitting when senior
first baseman David Holbrook hit a
home run.
Saturday proved to be more of a Car
dinal type game, a pitchers' duel pro
ducing a one run win as Stanford pre
vailed 3-2. Junior Rick Helling showed
that he is quickly becoming another
part of Stanford's history of great pitch
ers. Helling pitched eight and two
thirds innings, giving up only two runs
on eight hits, striking out nine. Aaron
Dorlarque came in to get the final out to
record the save.
Stanford had a great day at the plate
on Saturday as well, getting 10 hits.
The Card started out early, getting two

runs in the top of the first on a Cornell
single, a Dusty Allen double, and a
Mark Skeels single, respectively. How
ever, the Rainbows came back in the
second with an answering two runs, and
it remained all knotted up until the
eighth. In the top of the inning, the
Hawaii found that they had allowed the
bases full, and were facing pesky hitter
Jeff DesJardins at the plate. Rather
than give the sophomore second base
man something to hit, Rainbow pitcher
Craig Tucker pitched out of the strike

Victor Cheng — Daily file
Outfielder David Cornell slides into second base safely in Sunken Diamond action. Cornell was instrumental in Stanford's
success against No. 15 Hawaii this weekend, going 5 for 12 in the series with four runs scored and a pair of stolen bases.
Stanford pitching allowed only
three Hawaiian hits. But the Car
dinal allowed the Rainbows plen
ty of baserunners with an excess
of errors, bases-on-balls, and hit
batsmen.
In all, it was a pretty success
ful weekend for Stanford base
ball. Dominant Stanford pitching
continued to evidence itself,
allowing only eight runs in 26
innings pitched for an very good

.307 team ERA. And more impor
tantly, Stanford is beginning to
show its head at the plate, getting
an incredible 31 hits. And doing
all this against a ranked team,
the Card can surely be happy
with their performance in par
adise, including the 81 AGT
(average gametime temperature).
The Stanford baseball team spent
the weekend in Hawaii, and it looks like
they came away with more than just
sand in their pockets and leftover Cop
pertone in their belly-buttons. In a bat
tle of two top-20 teams, the No. 8 Car
dinal won the series with No. 15 Hawaii
by taking two out of three games from
the Rainbows.
And the Cardinal did it in an unac
customed way — with hitting. Although
Stanford pitchers put in their regularly
excellent performances, it was timely
and ample batting which got it done for
the Cardinal.

In the first game on Friday, Stanford
absolutely slaughtered the Rainbows at
the plate, getting 16 hits to Hawaii's
eight, and defeating the Rainbows 16-4.
The Cardinal didn't even need all those
runs, thanks to hurler Willie Adams.
After starter Brian Sackinsky went only
two and a third innings and got touched
for four runs, Adams came in and fin
ished the game by shutting Hawaii out
for the final six and two-thirds innings
to get his second win.
Big games at the plate came from
just about everyone. Jeffrey Hammonds
had four hits, including a triple, and a
stolen base. Dave Cornell had three
hits, and Chris Kemper, in his new posi
tion at third base, had two hits and four

RBI. There was even a rare show of
Stanford power hitting when senior
first baseman David Holbrook hit a
home run.
