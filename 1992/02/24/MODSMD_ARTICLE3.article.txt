# Plan to combine foreign lit. jeered

A budget-cutting move to reorganize
and combine the University's foreign lit
erature programs is meeting with resis
tance from several faculty members in
the School of Humanities and Sciences.
"We would be the laughingstock of
other universities," said German Prof.
Kurt Mueller-Vollmer. "Pedagogically,
it's very unwise."
The move was announced in January
as part of a plan to reduce the School of
Humanities and Science's operating
budget by $5 million.
It seeks to combine the literature pro
grams that are currently administered
separately by the Departments of Asian
Languages, French and Italian, German
Studies, Spanish and Portuguese, and

Slavic Languages and
Literatures.
Parts of the Classics
Department, the Mod
ern Thought and Liter
ature program and the
Comparative Litera
ture program may also
be integrated into the
new structure.
"What we have now

is simply an outmoded mode of organi
zation," said Carolyn Lougee, associate
dean of Humanities and Sciences.
According to Lougee, the departments
may be combined either into one large
department or several medium-sized
ones. An "area studies model," combin
ing the study of social science, history
and literature, is also being considered.
But faculty disagree over whether

Lougee's assessment of the current sys
tem as outdated is correct.
"The evolution into separate depart
ments was a quantum leap," said Gerald
Gillespie, professor of German. "The deans
are going ahead, steamroller-like, against
the wishes of the faculty involved."
According to Gillespie, the study of
literature was administered by the
European Literature Department until
the early 19605, but this system was
"chaotic and wasteful" and was dis
solved after being deemed "unworthy of
a leading university."
The old system was "unwieldy and
gigantic," said Mueller-Vollmer. "It was
one big bureaucracy and people were
very unhappy."
