# Plan to combine foreign lit. jeered

### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
A budget-cutting move to reorganize
and combine the University's foreign lit
erature programs is meeting with resis
tance from several faculty members in
the School of Humanities and Sciences.
"We would be the laughingstock of
other universities," said German Prof.
Kurt Mueller-Vollmer. "Pedagogically,
it's very unwise."
The move was announced in January
as part of a plan to reduce the School of
Humanities and Science's operating
budget by $5 million.
It seeks to combine the literature pro
grams that are currently administered
separately by the Departments of Asian
Languages, French and Italian, German
Studies, Spanish and Portuguese, and

Slavic Languages and
Literatures.
Parts of the Classics
Department, the Mod
ern Thought and Liter
ature program and the
Comparative Litera
ture program may also
be integrated into the
new structure.
"What we have now

is simply an outmoded mode of organi
zation," said Carolyn Lougee, associate
dean of Humanities and Sciences.
According to Lougee, the departments
may be combined either into one large
department or several medium-sized
ones. An "area studies model," combin
ing the study of social science, history
and literature, is also being considered.
But faculty disagree over whether

Lougee's assessment of the current sys
tem as outdated is correct.
"The evolution into separate depart
ments was a quantum leap," said Gerald
Gillespie, professor of German. "The deans
are going ahead, steamroller-like, against
the wishes of the faculty involved."
According to Gillespie, the study of
literature was administered by the
European Literature Department until
the early 19605, but this system was
"chaotic and wasteful" and was dis
solved after being deemed "unworthy of
a leading university."
The old system was "unwieldy and
gigantic," said Mueller-Vollmer. "It was
one big bureaucracy and people were
very unhappy."
But English Prof. Herbert Linden-


Gillespie
berger contends that separating
the study of literature by nation
ality is a very artificial distinc
tion, one "based in 19th century
nationalism and ideology." Lin
denberger is one of several faculty
members recently named to an
advisory committee on the pro
posed restructuring.
"The sentiment has been to get
rid of small departments," he
said. "While the budget crisis cer
tainly set off the thinking (about
the restructuring), now we're
concerned with what's right intel
lectually. We want more perme
ability between departments."
Lindenberger noted that both
UC-San Diego and UC-Santa
Cruz have organized departments
of literature. However, he said
the savings from the move "will
not be that great."
A small portion of the faculty
agree with the concept because
their departments have been cut
back significantly in recent years,
Gillespie said, and they believe
the new department would allow
for greater financial and political
clout.
However, Gillespie said he
feels that faculty are also con
cerned about a possible exodus of
young people from the depart
ments.
"The departments have
already aged in a dangerous way,"
said Gillespie. "People close to
retirement will stay on, but the
younger people will leave. This

will lead to an average age of
between 61 and 64 in many
departments. There' 3 progres
sively less and less reason to stay
on."
Gillespie also noted that if a
large literature department is cre
ated, budget-cutters will consider
it ripe for trimming. He said this
will lead to "complete intellectual
disintegration."
"I don't think there's anything
to get hysterical about yet," Lin
denberger cautioned. "But profes
sors easily get hysterical."
Gillespie said that the pro
posed reorganization is just
another instance of the "constant
humiliation of the faculty as intel
lectuals by the University."
He added that he senses a dis
tinct lack of confidence in the cur
rent deans and the administra
tion as a whole among his col
leagues.
"The Huns used to ride their
horses to death, and when they
were thirsty, they would stop and
slit the horses' veins and drink
the blood. I would like to see a dif
ferent attitude toward the faculty
by the administration and the
deans," Gillespie said.
Both Lindenberger and Lougee
said that no specific decisions
have been made yet regarding the
reorganization. Lougee said that
further details about the pro
posed changes will be sent to fac
ulty members this week.
She said she anticipates that
the decision-making process will
extend into next year, and that
the new structure will be in place
for the 1993-94 school year at the
earliest.
