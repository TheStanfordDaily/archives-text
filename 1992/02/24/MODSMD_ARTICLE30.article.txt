# Women's gym squad receives mixed reviews from Oregon trip
## 
### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
It has passed all its tests to this point,
but the Stanford Cardinal women's gym
nastics team will have to improve if it
wants to excel on the final.
On Friday night, the No. 16 Cardinal
received a "report card" of its progress at
the midpoint of the 1992 season. A
193.20-188.05 loss to the third-ranked
Oregon State Beavers and an easy
188.05-183.45 victory over Seattle Pacif
ic in a three-way meet at Corvallis, Ore
gon showed the grades to be, in the mind
of head coach Breck Greenwood, average.
"We did an OK job," Greenwood said,
"Not great, not bad, just OK. We need to
do a great job to be one of the top 12
teams in the country."

His concern for being a top-12 team
stems from the fact that 12 teams will
make April's NCAA Championship meet
in Minneapolis, a meet which has been
the focus of Stanford's program in
Greenwood's third year.
As expected, Oregon State sophomore
Chari Knight dominated the individual
all-around competition Friday, winning
every event with a score of 9.75 or better
for a total of 39.35 points. The Beavers'
Amy Durham placed second in three of
the four events and tallied a 38.85 over
all.
Cardinal highlights included the third
and fourth place all-around finishes,
respectively, of freshman Jene Elzie and
sophomore Kerri Kanuka. Elzie earned a
9.50 or better in the vault, bars, beam,
and floor on her way to a solid 38.35 per

formance, while Kanuka's 38.05 total
included team highs in the vault (9.65)
and the floor exercise (9.60).
"I felt OK," Elzie said after the meet,
"We could have pulled it together better,
but we did a pretty good job of focusing
with a big crowd."
The crowd 0f4,230 Oregon State back
ers definitely played a role in intimidat
ing the two visiting teams, but the
Beavers backed it up with the talent to
put the Cardinal away.
"It was a great meet and a great atmo
sphere, but we just didn't get it togeth
er," Kanuka said.
Stanford fell more than two points
short of its record 190-point output of the
previous week, and the difference was
evident in the team's totals in the indi
vidual disciplines. On the uneven bars,

Stanford had set a school record with
47.80 points against UCSB, but the
squad managed only 46.85 Friday night.
Greenwood had felt that the Cardinal
was ready for a great vaulting meet
against Oregon State, but the squad was
only able to equal its total from the week
before with 46.95 points. There was a
drop from 47.40 to 47.00 in the floor
exercise between the two meets, yet most
of it could be attributed to the tougher
routines being tried out by the gymnasts
in Corvallis.
"We threw some new things out on the
floor and we had some success," said
assistant coach Lisa Mitzel-Izzi, "We
need some more hard work on the beam,
though."
Indeed, Stanford's results fell off most
significantly in the balance beam compe

tition against the Beavers. The team had
shattered the school record against
UCSB with three 9.65 scores and two
9.60'5, good for an astounding 48.15
points. Friday night, however, it mus
tered only 47.25 points behind 9.65 per
formances by Elzie and sophomore Ker
rie Kelley and three scores under 9.50.
"We're getting better and better on
the road, but we're not totally there yet,"
said Greenwood.
Stanford's women's gymnasts, who
will begin a two-meet homestand this
Friday night at 7:30 in a three-way tussle
with California and Sacramento State at
Burnham Pavilion, now have a taste of
what it will take to match the nation's
best, but Minneapolis is still a long way
away.
