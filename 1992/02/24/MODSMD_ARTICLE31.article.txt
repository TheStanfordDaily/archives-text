# Track begins season with Bay Area Relays

In what will probably be the most laid back
meet of the year for Stanford track and field, the
Cardinal kicked off their outdoor season on Sat
urday against California and Sacramento State
among other teams, in the open invitational Bay
Area Relays.
No team scores were kept during the meet as
it was mostly an opportunity for individuals to
"work out the first meet kinks," as Stanford
assistant coach Betsy Riccardi said.
Jeff Atkinson, a Stanford graduate who is
among the top 1,500 meter American runners,
was among the myriad former collegiate com
petitors who were at the relays to gauge how
their training is coming along.
"We use (meets like this) to basically get the
foundations down," said Stanford head track
coach Brooks Johnson. "That way we can

always call on the basics later in the season
when we need them."
Although the balmy weather conditions were
hardly conducive to intense competition (among
the field was an open-entry team from Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technology who called
themselves the Has-Beens), many of the Cardi
nal still shined individually.
Sophomore Dave Popejoy is already an
NCAA provisional qualifier after his hammer
throw of 203'1", which is nine feet over his pre
vious personal best. The NCAA has two differ
ent qualifying standards, provisional and auto
matic, and if enough individuals don't qualify
automatically in a given event, the NCAA uses
the highest provisional scores to establish who
goes to the championships.
"The men are going to be very strong in the
hammer and discus, and the women will be
strong in the discus," said Stanford throwing

coach Jed Goldfried. "For an opener I'm pretty
pleased with our effort and performance."
The women sprinters blew away the field as
the 4 hylOO, 4 by 200, and 4 by 800 relay teams
won handily over Cal. Individually, top NCAA
sprinter Chryste Gaines, a senior, established a
new Bay Area Relay record in the 100 meters
with a time of 11.81 seconds.
"The women sprinters did exceptionally well
again," said Stanford distance coach Scott
Chisam. "I think the tide is about turn in the
Stanford-Cal battle."
Johnson also commented on the Stanford-Cal
rivaliy, noting that "three out of the last four
years it has come down to last event for the men,
and I wouldn't be suprised if the same thing hap
pened this year."
The Cardinal will be traveling to USC this
Saturday. Last year, Stanford beat the Tro
jans for the first time since 1954.
