Crew: On Saturday, the men's
and women's crew squads held
their annual Urgathon at Stan
ford Shopping Center. While
the event was primarily a fund
raiser for the self-supported
sports program, there was
extra incentive for participants
to give it their all: a shot at the
Guinness Book of World
Records mark for most meters
rowed in a 24-hour period. Last
year, the Stanford team set the
current record by rowing
almost 385 kilometers. While
this weekend's total —about
367K — didn't quite eclipse the
mark, the event was considered

a success nonetheless.
"It was a pretty fun day, and
a long day," said women's cap
tain Bonnie Baker. "We really
got quite a workout."
Men's volleyball: Stanford
travels to Irvine today to take
on the UC-Irvine Anteaters at 6
p.m. The Cardinal lost a tough
match to No. 1 Long Beach
State on the road Friday, and
last night's game against Pep
perdine took place too late for
this edition of the Daily. Com
plete details of the weekend's
results will appear in tomor
row's paper.
