Despite operating at what
Coach Sadao Hamada called "30

nastics machine pummeled San
Jose State at the Ford Center on

Cardinal 280.75
'

Spartans 225

Stanford exceeded their
coach's expectations for the sec
ond week in a row by posting a
score of 280.75. The visiting
Spartans entered the contest
with a weak lineup that looked
even weaker when it finished
with only 225 points.
Hamada used his top gym
nasts, Jair Lynch and Tim Ryan,
sparingly but Mark Booth picked
up the slack. The sophomore had
four strong events, including a
9.75 on the pommel horse and a
9.6 on the high bars.
"Mark Booth did very well,"
Hamada said. "He showed a huge
improvement since a week ago."
Jeff Bender and Steve Hutch
ings also turned in strong perfor
mances against the Spartans.
Bender scored a 9.85 on the par
allel bars while his new routine
on the rings earned him a 9.7.
Hutchings continued to show
consistency in the floor exercise
with a 9.55, and scored a 9.5 on
the high bar.
Once again, the Cardinal
demonstrated a glaring weakness
in vaulting. Jason Cohen's injury
and Booth's recovery from injury

'Right now, we're
training very hard but
no one's peaked yet.'
— Sadao Hamada

have contributed to Stanford's
low scores in this discipline.
The injuries that inevitably
arise in such a strenuous sport
mark another problem with
which Stanford must contend.
Like Cohen and Booth, Ryan is
also rebounding from injury.
Nonetheless, the team demon
strated remarkable depth at an
early stage in the season.
"Right now, we're training
very hard but no one's peaked
yet," Hamada said.
Hamada has not yet used his
best athletes in each event in
order to give less experienced
gymnasts a chance to improve
their skills. The coach will even
tually replace the weaker gym
nasts at major competitions.
"By [the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships], we should be at
90 percent of our potential and
score about 286 points," Hamada
said. "By the NCAA regionals,
we want to be 95 to 100 percent
and go to 290 points."
Team spirit is another area in
which the Cardinal is improving.
The Berkeley meet two weeks ago
provided one such example.
At that tournament, Chris Sey
turned in a solid performance
despite feeling sick at the time.
"That kind of thing builds
more trust and confidence in
each other and that keeps build
ing and building," Lynch said.

his squad will be at full strength in time for postseason competition.
