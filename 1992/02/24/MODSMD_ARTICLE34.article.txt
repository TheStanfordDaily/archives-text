# Golfers head south for winter matches
## Men finish respectably in Aloha State 
### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
The No. 13 Stanford men's
golf team joined the baseball
squad this weekend as the Car
dinal's first representatives in
the Aloha State since a certain
two-point conversion victim
ized the football team on
Christmas Day.
In hitting the links for the
first time in 1992, head coach
Wally Goodwin's charges came
away with an eighth place tie in
the John A. Burns Invitational
hosted by the University of
Hawaii in Kaneohe, Oahu.
The tournament was domi
nated by the University of Ari
zona, which carded a four-man
total of 827 over three days and
shattered the tournament record
by four strokes. Stanford tied
with Oklahoma at 42 strokes off
the pace, tallying team marks of
292-283-294 on Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday, respec
tively, for an 869 total.
In the individual competi
tion, Manny Zerman of Arizona
put up the lowest total of 204
strokes, while three of his
teammates finished second,

third, and eighth to underscore
the Wildcats' superiority.
The tournament was not
devoid of Cardinal highlights,
however. Sophomore Notah
Begay parlayed a fast start and
a 69-68-73 performance into a
fifth-place showing. At 210
strokes, Begay finished six
under par and was the only
Stanford golfer to break par.
"Notah did a good job," Good
win said after the tournament.
Senior Christian Cevaer tied
for 36th place with 219 strokes,
and if it were not for a 76 on
the final day, would have fin
ished even higher with strong
74 and 69 tallies on Wednesday
and Thursday. "Christian was
solid early on, but his short
game just deserted him on Fri
day," said Goodwin in refer
ence to Cevaer's several missed
putts that day.
Overall, Goodwin called the
team's performance "average,"
but the season is just getting
underway and the Cardinal has
a long time to improve. Stanford
will look to start on the road to
improvement in the Ping Invi
tational in Tucson, Arizona,
next Monday and Tuesday.
