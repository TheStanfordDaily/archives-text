Trading in their umbrellas
for sunglasses, the women's
golf team competes this week
in Tucson, Arizona in the Uni
versity of Arizona Intercolle
giate. The Cardinal will play
two rounds (36 holes) today,
finishing up the competition
tomorrow with an additional
round of golf.
Today, No. 6 Stanford tees
off at the Randolph Park Golf
Course, going head-to-head
with 18 talented collegiate
teams, including the powerful
No. 1 Arizona team.
This will be the only tourna
ment in which the Stanford
golfers are entered this winter,
after a demanding fall season
that saw the Cardinal travel
ling every weekend. "We played
a lot in the fall," said coach Tim
Baldwin. "For us this is more a
tournament to keep us on our
golf games after a long layoff."
Featured in the competition
are Stanford stars Adele Moore
and Audrey Wooding. Moore
won the individual title in the

prestigious Hilton Head, South
Carolina Golf World Classic,
the last tournament that the
Cardinal entered in the fall.
Wooding, usually a consis
tently high placer for the Car
dinal, is a question mark for
the Arizona tournament. She
has been injured this quarter,
suffering from an aggravated
hip and knee, and has been
unable to practice recently.
Martha Richards, Melinda
Daniels and Jamille Jose com
plete the travelling team, hop
ing to score a high team finish
among a talented field that
includes No. 5 Tulsa, No. 7
University of Southern Califor
nia and No. 8 UCLA.
"Arizona is number one, and
it's on their home course ..
Baldwin said. "I don't think
anybody in the field can chal
lenge them unless they really
have an off tournament."
Stanford looks to see some
good weather in Arizona,
which will be a relief consider
ing the past two weeks' rains
and the conditions two years
ago at Arizona, when the
golfers had to play in snow.
