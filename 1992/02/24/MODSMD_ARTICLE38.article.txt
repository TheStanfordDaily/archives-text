# Fighting for freedom, one letter at a time
## 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
Junior Kecia Albright was in
eighth grade when she sent her first
letters as a member of Amnesty
International. The letters pleaded
the case of four men who had been
taken prisoner in Guatemala.
She saw two of the men being
shot dead on the street while
watching a television news report
two weeks later.
Albright now runs the Stan
ford affiliate of Amnesty Interna
tional, an international human
rights advocacy group.
British lawyer Peter Benenson
started the group in 1961 after he

heard about two Portuguese stu
dents who had been imprisoned
for toasting freedom.
Although there are about 30
people in Stanford's chapter of
Amnesty International, only a
"core group" of about seven or
eight are really involved with the
activities, Albright said.
Every Thursday, the group
meets to write letters, organize
trips and plan campus activities
designed to inform students
about the various "campaigns"
Amnesty is working on.
Amnesty works through short
term campaigns that concentrate
efforts around a particular theme.
The student group is currently

working on the children and
refugee campaigns.
The primary goals of the "chil
dren's campaign" are to "protest
and prevent human rights abuses
against children" and to "educate
children about their human
rights," said Albright.
Albright said she is particular
ly concerned with street children
because they don't have anyone
officially speaking up for them.
Junior Anna Olson, another
member of the group, spent last
summer in a refugee shelter in
Texas as part of an Amnesty
International internship program.
The internship program
involved both attending a confer
ence and going to a refugee shelter.
At the conference, a speaker who
runs a shelter for street children in
Guatemala City showed "several
documented cases of children who
had been severely tortured."
He showed "photographs of
[the children's! bodies. Kids who
had their eyes burned out (and)
who had been severely beaten,"
Olson said.
In the shelter, Olson said, the
speaker met "a Guatemalan
street kid who had passed
through and (who) had seen some
of his friends killed on the street."
The experience at the shelter
had a strong impact on Olson's
feelings about human rights and
Amnesty International, she said.
"Working with people who
were victims of human rights
abuses made human rights more
real to me. It gave me a sense of
the power Amnesty has to make
an impact.
"It was really different to
come face to face with people who
had been the victims of such abus
es after only having read about"
them, Olson said.
She has also visited an adult
detention center in El Centro,
California, where inmates had
been allowed to paint a mural in
the cafeteria. They painted the
Statue of Liberty.
For Olson, experiences like

these made her realize how
important Amnesty's work with
refugees is.
However, not all members of
the group are so actively involved.
For many, the experience goes
only as far as writing letters.
"People who write letters prob
ably come to our two letter-writ
ing meetings a month," said
Albright. To her, that "is doing
important work" since "letter
writing is the backbone of
Amnesty's work."
In today's world, "internation
al pressure really means some
thing," said Albright, and so "let
ters from foreigners" help.
Amnesty activists like
Albright are confident that their
efforts are bringing about
progress on human rights,
although they say more work
still needs to be done.
These people "have a strong
sense of what's right and what's
wrong" and they are "struggling
to correct what they perceive to be
injustice," she said.
"The thing that has kept me
involved with Amnesty for so long
is the sense that .. . the [world
situation in terms of] human
rights needs a radical change.
"If people really acted according
to the universal laws on human
rights, the world would be a veiy
different and a much better place."
But, "today [this changel is
within our grasp," Albright said.
Albright remembers another
story from her early days with
Amnesty. Some men who were
detained in Turkey and were
reportedly being tortured, she
wrote letters as part of the Urgent
Action Network.
She said, the men "were actual
ly given a trial when they were to
be summarily executed. ... It
became clear to me that my letters
could actually make a difference.
While the letters may be only
"a drop in the bucket," she said,
"eventually the bucket will over
flow and someone will have to do
something about it."

had their eyes burned out (and)
who had been severely beaten,"
Olson said.
In the shelter, Olson said, the
speaker met "a Guatemalan
street kid who had passed
through and (who) had seen some
of his friends killed on the street."
The experience at the shelter
had a strong impact on Olson's
feelings about human rights and
Amnesty International, she said.
"Working with people who
were victims of human rights
abuses made human rights more
real to me. It gave me a sense of
the power Amnesty has to make
an impact.
"It was really different to
come face to face with people who
had been the victims of such abus
es after only having read about"
them, Olson said.
She has also visited an adult
detention center in El Centro,
California, where inmates had
been allowed to paint a mural in
the cafeteria. They painted the
Statue of Liberty.
For Olson, experiences like

these made her realize how
important Amnesty's work with
refugees is.
However, not all members of
the group are so actively involved.
For many, the experience goes
only as far as writing letters.
"People who write letters prob
ably come to our two letter-writ
ing meetings a month," said
Albright. To her, that "is doing
important work" since "letter
writing is the backbone of
Amnesty's work."
In today's world, "internation
al pressure really means some
thing," said Albright, and so "let
ters from foreigners" help.
Amnesty activists like
Albright are confident that their
efforts are bringing about
progress on human rights,
although they say more work
still needs to be done.
These people "have a strong
sense of what's right and what's
wrong" and they are "struggling
to correct what they perceive to be
injustice," she said.
"The thing that has kept me
involved with Amnesty for so long
is the sense that .. . the [world
situation in terms of] human
rights needs a radical change.
"If people really acted according
to the universal laws on human
rights, the world would be a veiy
different and a much better place."
But, "today [this changel is
within our grasp," Albright said.
Albright remembers another
story from her early days with
Amnesty. Some men who were
detained in Turkey and were
reportedly being tortured, she
wrote letters as part of the Urgent
Action Network.
She said, the men "were actual
ly given a trial when they were to
be summarily executed. ... It
became clear to me that my letters
could actually make a difference.
While the letters may be only
"a drop in the bucket," she said,
"eventually the bucket will over
flow and someone will have to do
something about it."

Kecia Albright, a junior, heads Stanford's branch of Amnesty Interna
tional, a human rights advocacy group that specializes in letter-writ
ing campaigns for victims of human rights violations. While the letters
may be only "a drop in the bucket," she says, "eventually the bucket
will overflow and someone will have to do something about it."
Junior Kecia Albright was in
eighth grade when she sent her first
letters as a member of Amnesty
International. The letters pleaded
the case of four men who had been
taken prisoner in Guatemala.
She saw two of the men being
shot dead on the street while
watching a television news report
two weeks later.
Albright now runs the Stan
ford affiliate of Amnesty Interna
tional, an international human
rights advocacy group.
British lawyer Peter Benenson
started the group in 1961 after he

heard about two Portuguese stu
dents who had been imprisoned
for toasting freedom.
Although there are about 30
people in Stanford's chapter of
Amnesty International, only a
"core group" of about seven or
eight are really involved with the
activities, Albright said.
Every Thursday, the group
meets to write letters, organize
trips and plan campus activities
designed to inform students
about the various "campaigns"
Amnesty is working on.
Amnesty works through short
term campaigns that concentrate
efforts around a particular theme.
The student group is currently

working on the children and
refugee campaigns.
The primary goals of the "chil
dren's campaign" are to "protest
and prevent human rights abuses
against children" and to "educate
children about their human
rights," said Albright.
Albright said she is particular
ly concerned with street children
because they don't have anyone
officially speaking up for them.
Junior Anna Olson, another
member of the group, spent last
summer in a refugee shelter in
Texas as part of an Amnesty
International internship program.
The internship program
involved both attending a confer
ence and going to a refugee shelter.
At the conference, a speaker who
runs a shelter for street children in
Guatemala City showed "several
documented cases of children who
had been severely tortured."
He showed "photographs of
[the children's! bodies. Kids who
had their eyes burned out (and)
who had been severely beaten,"
Olson said.
In the shelter, Olson said, the
speaker met "a Guatemalan
street kid who had passed
through and (who) had seen some
of his friends killed on the street."
The experience at the shelter
had a strong impact on Olson's
