# Race for COP begins; no slate filled
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Some slates were wiped clean this week
end while others were filled as candidates
for ASSU Council of Presidents attempted
to create an election-winning combination.
Several students confirmed yesterday
and Saturday that they intend to try for
COP once they find running mates.
Among the students who said they
may seek a seat on the COP are three cur
rent members of the ASSU Senate: Jason
Snyder, Ron Brown and Raphe Beck.
Snyder, a sophomore who ran as an

independent candidate for senate last
year and pulled in the second highest
number of votes for undergraduate sen
ator, said he is "looking around" for
running mates for the COP.
"I'll only run if I can find some people
who are going to make a difference" to
run with, Snyder said. If he does run, he
said he will "never run with a party,"
but only as an independent.
Brown, who ran for an undergradu
ate senate seat with People's Platform
last year, said rumors of his candidacy
are "fairly accurate."
Snyder said he and Brown are "defi

nitely thinking about" running on the
same slate. However, he said they had
not yet decided whether to do so.
Beck, a senior who ran with the Ham
mer and Coffin party last year, said he is
"considering running" for COP.
Another COP candidate searching for
the perfect slatemates is Joel Stein. Stein,
a former Daily columnist, said he will be
meeting with potential running mates
today but wants to be a COP member.
"If I can make this campus a better
place, by gosh, I'll do it," Stein said.
The Hammer and Coffin party
will definitely back a slate, but is
unsure who will run, according to
party chair David Hyatt. Hyatt,
an undergraduate senator who
ran with Hammer and Coffin last
year, said he was currently
"investigating the legality" of sev
eral unusual slates the party
might endorse.
One possibility the party has
considered is placing three people
on their COP slate and having the
fourth slot filled by random mem
bers of the student body who
would serve for one-week periods,
Hyatt said.
Students First will be sponsor
ing a slate, but has not yet chosen
four people, according to junior
Beth Morgan. Morgan is a member
of the current Students First COP.
She said her party may run
more than one slate. According to
Morgan, the new balloting system

approved by the senate this year for
COP elections makes it possible for
one party to run two slates without
their being in direct competition.
However, she said it was "very
doubtful" that the party would
run multiple slates.
The new voting system, which
eliminates the runoff election,
allows students to rank their
choices for COP.
People's Platform member
Allyson Dickson declined to com
ment yesterday on whether her
party will sponsor a slate. Dickson
said the party is seeking a media
relations spokesperson, but has
not yet found one. Until a
spokesperson is found, no party
officials will speak to the press,
she said.
In an interview last week, Peo
ple's Platform member Mae Lee,
who ran unsuccessfully for COP
last year, said the party would not
back a COP slate for the election.
She added that single party mem
bers or groups of members might
"individually or collectively sup
port an [independent] COP slate."
