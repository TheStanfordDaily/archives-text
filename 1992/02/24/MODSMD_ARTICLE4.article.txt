# Race for COP begins; no slate filled
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Some slates were wiped clean this week
end while others were filled as candidates
for ASSU Council of Presidents attempted
to create an election-winning combination.
Several students confirmed yesterday
and Saturday that they intend to try for
COP once they find running mates.
Among the students who said they
may seek a seat on the COP are three cur
rent members of the ASSU Senate: Jason
Snyder, Ron Brown and Raphe Beck.
Snyder, a sophomore who ran as an

independent candidate for senate last
year and pulled in the second highest
number of votes for undergraduate sen
ator, said he is "looking around" for
running mates for the COP.
"I'll only run if I can find some people
who are going to make a difference" to
run with, Snyder said. If he does run, he
said he will "never run with a party,"
but only as an independent.
Brown, who ran for an undergradu
ate senate seat with People's Platform
last year, said rumors of his candidacy
are "fairly accurate."
Snyder said he and Brown are "defi

nitely thinking about" running on the
same slate. However, he said they had
not yet decided whether to do so.
Beck, a senior who ran with the Ham
mer and Coffin party last year, said he is
"considering running" for COP.
Another COP candidate searching for
the perfect slatemates is Joel Stein. Stein,
a former Daily columnist, said he will be
meeting with potential running mates
today but wants to be a COP member.
"If I can make this campus a better
place, by gosh, I'll do it," Stein said.
