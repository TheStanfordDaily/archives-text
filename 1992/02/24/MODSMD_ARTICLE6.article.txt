### Scott Handleman Staff writer 
A student arrested early Satur
day morning for allegedly throwing
beer on two Stanford police officers
during a party at Kairos has been
charged with battery of a police
officer and resisting arrest, both
misdemeanors.
According to Stanford Police Sgt.
Hilary Karp, two officers were
standing in the foyer of Kairos when
junior Baird MacGuiness sneaked
up behind one of the officers and
"dumped a cup of beer on his back."
Beer hit both officers, he said.
Karp said MacGuiness tried to
run away but was "grabbed and
taken into custody" by the offi
cers. The arrest occurred at 2 a.m.
Saturday, he said.
"The cops came in on a regular
noise complaint," said sophomore
Gary Herman, a Kairos resident.
Herman described the party as
"festive" and "rockm.' "
According to MacGuiness, he
w.?? hit by the police. He refused
to comment further on the inci
dent, but said, "I hope all police
die of AIDS."
Herman said that several resi
dents believe the police used exces
sive force in arresting MacGuiness.
Karp said the officers had a right to
act as they did because MacGui
ness was running from them.

'Considering the fact
that the only contact
between him and
them was a liquid,
they were handling
him pretty roughly.'

According to one resident who
witnessed the arrest, "Considering
the fact that the only contact
between him and them was a liq
uid, they were handling him pretty
roughly."
Herman said he believed party
goers had been "obstructive with
the police, and the police were
kind of pissed off."
Legally, battery is defined as
"the unlawful application of force
or violence" to an individual not
consenting to the act, Karp said.
Pouring beer on an officer is
treated the same as hitting an
officer, he added.
Music from the party could be
heard from nearly two blocks
away, Karp said.
The arrest was not the only
incident associated with the
party, according to Kairos resi
dent Joe Meltzer. "Someone stole
our 7-ball and broke our pool
cue," he said.
