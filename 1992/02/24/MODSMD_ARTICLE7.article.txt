# Home-grown gladiator
## Musclebound junior gears up for weekend 
### Victor Haseman 
Every Saturday night, a group of
patriotically clad, superhuman types
beat the living daylights out of hopeful
contestants.
This Saturday's "American Gladia
tors" lineup includes Vic Chao, a Stan
ford junior, as one of those contenders.
The show, held at the Cow Palace
Arena in South San Francisco, will not
be one of the televised shows because it
is not a national competition.
It's no wonder he thinks the show is
an "awesome thing to do when you come
back on a Saturday night and you don't
really want to go to sleep yet."
Chao — a Stanford cheerleader, a
coach for Menlo Gymnastics Club and a
student in the Mechanical Engineering
Department — competed for the right to
participate in the show two weeks ago at
the Cow Palace.
Fifteen hundred Bay Area residents,
including Chao, spent their afternoon
and evening waiting in line for a chance
to fail the Gladiators' grueling physical
fitness test.
Contestants are chosen for their over
all speed, agility and ability to fake and
turn.
"Flip boy," as Chao is sometimes
referred to by students at home football
games, attributes his successful perfor
mance to his regular gymnastic and
cheerleading workouts.
Although Chao's physical condition is

excellent, he said he never went beyond
his regular workout for the tryouts.
As he puts it,"I would have loved to
have been really intense about it, and run
every day and do push-ups, pull-ups and
sit-ups, and stuff like that. But I'm con
cerned with passing [Engineering! 40 and
[Mechanical Engineering] 103 right now."
Although the Cow Palace show is only
six days away, Chao was very reserved in
forecasting his performance, "I'd be real
ly happy to just come away with lots of
bruises and sprains. There's no way you
can get out of 'American Gladiators'
without getting thrown around a lot.'
At a height of 5 feet 9 inches and
weight of 165 pounds, he said he was com
fortable with the fact that his opponents,
Nitro, Gemini, Laser and Thunder, range
in height from 6 feet to 6 feet 4 inches and
in weight from 225 to 280 pounds.
But Chao was careful in his optimism;
"I'll be happy if I get a six-pack of Pepsi
and a Slurpee out of this thing," he said.
The fitness test narrowed the 1,500
would-be gladiators to four men and four
women.
Chao speculated that the finger-tip
push-up requirement alone erased all
but approximately 150 hopefuls for the
men's team. He said few reached the
goal of 50 push-ups in 60 seconds, and
perhaps only 70 could run a 40-yard
dash in 4.8 seconds or less.
Hopefuls who successfully ran the
dash generally succeeded in hand
pedaling themselves across a
beam in eight seconds or less.
However, the "absolute killer"
was saved for last, Chao said.
Finalists were asked to do 15
wide-arm pull-ups, touching the
back of their neck to the bar. This
chore annihilated all but 25 indi
viduals.
The final cuts were based on
the hopefuls' performance in two
actual "American Gladiator"
events, "Powerball" and " Joust."

Powerball is played on a mat
ted area. At one end stand two
large cans and a contestant play
ing defense, while a contestant
playing offense starts from the
other end. For the offense, the
object of the game is to get past
the defender and put the balls in
the cans.
In Joust, both players stand on
platforms, wearing protective
gear and holding large sticks with
padding on either end. The object
of the game is to knock the oppo
nent off the pedestal.
Unhappy with his performance

in Powerball, Chao said he
redeemed himself in Joust by
knocking his opponent off balance
three times in a row. This perfor
mance, as well as an interview with
"American Gladiators" officials,
earned him one of four positions in
Saturday's Cow Palace show.
Chao said he and 30 members
of his dormitory, Schiff, see the
competition as not so much a
chance for him to win or lose but
a chance to have fun.
If nothing else, Chao will have
a great story to tell his children
and grandchildren one day.
