# New DRs, budget cuts mean fewer classes for majors

Larger classes and fewer course options
will confront students in English, history
and interdisciplinary programs in coming
years, according to some faculty members.
Several professors say the changes are
due to the new distribution requirements
and the replacement of Culture, Ideas and
Values and Freshman English instructors
with English and history faculty.
The History Department "will eventual
ly ... lose eight to 10 courses," said David
Kennedy, chair of the department.
"Our faculty, however, will be required
to teach some courses in American Studies
and CIV," he said. "We will be teaching the
same number of courses, just in different
departments."
Kennedy added that "the big question
has nothing to do with the budget cuts. It
has to do with the change in the distribu
tion requirements, with the addition of the
American Studies requirement," which
may cause increased demand for American
history courses.
The new distribution requirements,
World Cultures and American Cultures,
were added last November.
A similar phenomenon will occur in the
English Department, according to English
Prof. Mary Wack.
She said the department "will have an
increased number of faculty teaching in

Freshman English and CIV. For each one
of these courses taught, another course will
not be offered.
"Unless everyone decides to drop an
English course, there will be an average of
10 more students per class," Wack said.
At least four classes of Freshman English
will be taught by regular faculty, according
to English Department Chair Ron Rebholz.
"This diminishes the number of courses we
can offer," he said, adding that "it is not an
ideal situation, but we can survive it."
According to Assoc. Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Carolyn Lougee, there will be
"some decrease" in the number of courses
offered in the future.
"The most obvious (decrease) will be in
Innovative Academic Courses, which is
closing," she said.
Lougee added that she does not yet know
which courses will be dropped and which
will be taken over by different faculty.
"Any changes will be phased in over the
next three years, and departments are just
right now beginning to put together their
curriculum for next year," she said.
The changes may also affect interde
partmental programs, since "departments
will have to make more intensive use of
their faculty so it will be harder to get them
to teach in programs," said Jay Fliegelman,
chair of the American Studies Program.
If more English professors go to CIV and
Freshman English, there will be fewer
American Studies courses, Fliegelman said.
