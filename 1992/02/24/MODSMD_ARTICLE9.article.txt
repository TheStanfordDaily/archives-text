# Muslims, Jews meet at dinner
## 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
At a time of heightened political ten
sions in the Middle East, it might seem
implausible for Muslim and Jewish stu
dents to be meeting in a non-political atmo
sphere.
But that is what about 100 Arab, Mus
lim and Jewish students did last night
when they gathered at University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's residence for a
"night of good food and good music,"
according to Assoc. University Counsel
Robin Kennedy.
Second year graduate student Ahmed
Taha, a member of the Organization for
Arab-American Students In Stanford, said
he only participated in the event because it
was "a social situation without any political
implication and no political meaning."
The Kennedys and an Arab couple, Dr.
Hasan Diab and Dr. Najah Sharkiah, initiat-

Ed the event, which was sponsored by parents
of Arab and Jewish students at Stanford.
World-renowned Lute player Hamza El-
Din entertained the guests with half an
hour of Nubian music and singing, wishing
them "peace" before he departed.
"OASIS and the Jewish Student Associa
tion have been talking for a while about
doing something together when we got this
suggestion," said junior Tammy Watts, a
JSA member who helped organize the event.
But "this event was the catalyst" that
brought the two groups together, said
third-year law student David Forst, presi
dent of the JSA.
Junior Rabea Ataya, the president of
OASIS, said the event allowed people "who
would normally not get a chance to meet
each other ... form acquaintances" that
may last.
Ataya and Forst said working together
to organize the event "was bridge-building
in and of itself."
