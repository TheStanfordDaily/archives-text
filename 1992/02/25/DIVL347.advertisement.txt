It can't do laundry or find you a date,
but it can help you find more time for both.

classes, activities, projects, and term papers—
and still find time for what makes college
life real life.

your work finished fast. It's a snap to set up
and use. It has a powerful 68030 micro
processor, which means you can run even
the most sophisticated applications with ease
And its internal Apple Super Drive™ disk
drive reads from and writes to Macintosh and
MS-DOS formatted disks—allowing you to
exchange information easily with
almost any other kind of computer.
