Introduction to
Architecture:
The Summer Studio
at Columbia University
New York
A summer program giving university credit which introduces
the student to all aspects of the design, history, theory, and
practice of architecture. The program is intended both for
those without previous academic experience in design who
are interested in architecture as a potential career, and for
those with previous experience in architectural design who
would like to develop studio design skills, perhaps in prepa
ration for application to graduate school.
Studio, seminar, and lectures present a comprehensive
introduction to every aspect of architecture as it is practiced
today. In addition, through field-trips and tours, the student
learns from extraordinary examples of architectural and
urban design in New York City, the world's preeminent cen
ter for architecture and culture
