You can get ? lot more out of life when you
set your sights a little higher. Which is what
applying for the American Card
is all about. When you get the Card, it's
easier to do the things you want to do.
And with the student savings that come
along with it, you can do even more.
Fly roundtrip on
Continental for less than
$100 each way.
Student Cardmembers receive four travel
certificates. They can be used to fly any
where Continental Airlines flies in the
48 contiguous United States. Two for the
school year, and two for the summer* *
Depending on where you fly, each
school year travel certificate is good for
$129 or $189 roundtrip—and each sum
mer travel certificate
is good for $149
or $199 roundtrip.
Savings that
upgrade your lifestyle.
As a student Cardmember you get more
than great travel savings. You also save
money on everything from clothing
to long distance phone
calls. All for a
$55 annual fee.
Obviously, savings like these
say a lot about the value of the Card.
And having the Card will say a lot about
you. For one thing it says you nave a handle
on what you spend, so you don't have to
carry over a balance. It also says you're smart
enough not to pay interest charges that can
really add up. So take a few minutes now to
call (have your bank address and account
number ready), and apply for the American
Express Card.
With all that the Card offers you, not
even the sky is the limit.
Get going, call 1-800-967-AMEX.
If you're already a Cardmember, theret no need to call
