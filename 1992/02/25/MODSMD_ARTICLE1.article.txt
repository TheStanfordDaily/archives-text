## Gorbachev will revisit Stanford in early May 
### Alain Dalva Staff writer 
Two years after his legendary 1990 visit, former
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev plans to return
to Stanford in May.
Hoover Distinguished Fellow George Shultz said
Gorbachev's itinerary for the visit is still "in its
early stages." But Shultz, a former secretary of
state, said he hopes that Gorbachev will speak on
campus.
As part of a 16-day trip through the United
States, Gorbachev will arrive in San Francisco May
7 and come to Stanford the following weekend, on
May 9 and 10, if he sticks to his tentative plan.
"Gorbachev is interested in having a discussion
with Shultz" and will meet him at Stanford,
according to Amy Vossbrinck, logistics coordina
tor for the Gorbachev trip and chief financial offi
cer of the Gorbachev Foundation/USA in San
Francisco.
She added that details of Gorbachev's itinerary
are far from final.
Tentative plans call for Gorbachev to address a
major public meeting while he is in the Bay Area,
according to a statement prepared by the founda
tion. But planners of the trip apparently have not
decided what he will do or say while he is at Stan
ford.
Vossbrinck said she and Jim Garrison, the foun
dation's executive director, will fly to Moscow Fri
day to discuss the details of the trip with Gor
bachev.
Vossbrinck said the main purpose of Gorbachev's
visit to the Bay Area is the inspection of San Fran
cisco headquarters of the newly-created Gorbachev
Foundation, a non-profit institution founded to
support democracy in the former Soviet Union.
Gorbachev stepped down as president of the for
mer Soviet Union last December. In January, Gar
rison met him in Moscow to discuss the creation of
the foundation.
