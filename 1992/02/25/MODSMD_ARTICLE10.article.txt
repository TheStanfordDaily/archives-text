Justice has cancer, will continue working
WASHINGTON (AP) — Supreme Court Justice John Paul
Stevens has prostate cancer but will continue working and is
expected to recover fully, a court spokeswoman said yesterday.
Stevens, 71, one of the conservative court's most liberal mem
bers, was appointed by President Gerald R. Ford in 1975.
"Justice Stevens is expected to continue to participate fully in
all cases to come before the court during and after his radiation
treatment and to make a full recovery without any residual
effects," spokeswoman Toni House said in a prepared statement.
Supreme Court upholds Haitian repatriation
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court yesterday refused
to halt the repatriation of Haitian refugees. Meanwhile, an appar
ent snag arose in talks on implementing an accord providing for
the eventual return of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
The high court's 8-1 ruling upholding the Bush administra
tion's program to forcibly return Haitian refugees shifts the issue
to Congress, which this week will debate emergency legislation to
temporarily halt repatriations.
The political settlement reached late Sunday in Washington
between Aristide and his rivals in Haiti's National Assembly
would set up a "consensus government" before the president's
return to power.
The deal, reached after three days of talks at the Organization
of American States headquarters, set no date for Aristide's return.
