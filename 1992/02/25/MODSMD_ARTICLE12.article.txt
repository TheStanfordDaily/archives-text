## A 						cancerous greed 
### 
University should end
its huge investment in
tobacco company stock

STANFORD IS SUCCUMBING
to a cancerous greed by main
taining its $30 million invest
ment in tobacco companies that
rely on immoral, exploitative tech
niques to sell their products.
The Board of Trustees has been
asked to re-examine the Universi
ty's stock investments in tobacco
companies Phillip Morris, Loews
Corporation and American Brands.
The University's tobacco stock
makes up about 3 percent of its
total investments, with the $28
million of Phillip Morris stock com
prising most of that percentage.
The Advisory Panel for Invest
ment Responsibility suggested at
the last meeting of the Board of
Trustees that one of the board's
subcommittees should consider
opening talks with Phillip Morris
in an effort to influence the com
pany's behavior.
That step should be just a pre
lude. It is the University's respon
sibility to go ahead and divest its
stock, as Phillip Morris — a tobac
co industry giant with total assets
of nearly $5 billion — is extremely
unlikely to change the dubious
marketing practices that have
become the hallmark of most
tobacco companies.
These unsavory practices
include the irresponsible targeting
of those who can least afford the
costs of cigarette addiction: the
young poor in inner cities. It is
hardly a coincidence that this
group includes a large percentage
of minorities and teenage girls,
who are singled out by tobacco
companies' advertising campaigns.
For these disaffected groups,
smoking is perceived as a sign of
resistance — an image fueled by
the tobacco companies' high-pow
ered marketing campaigns.
The advertising strategy is very

similar to that of liquor companies
which target minority groups to
sell "Colt 45" or "Red Bull" malt
liquor — a practice that has been
widely condemned, and is recog
nized as highly degrading.
Tobacco companies' overseas
sales techniques are even more prob
lematic, as many companies inten
tionally avoid placing adequate
warning labels on exported
cigarettes. Most of these products
end up in Third World countries,
where they are passed off as luxury
goods.
Ironically, in these mostly poor
countries, cigarettes become sym
bols of Western material affluence,
rather than being unveiled as
killers.
Certainly, tobacco companies
are not entirely responsible for the
fact that a large number of people
smoke cigarettes, which leads to
their death. Many people con
sciously choose to smoke, knowing
the dangers fully well. A substan
tial percentage of people are not
targeted by the tobacco companies'
marketing campaigns, but still
decide to smoke.
But the least cigarette manufac
turers should be held responsible
for is the accurate portrayal of
their not-so-innocuous products.
It is a responsibility that will
continue to be shirked by Phillip
Morris and the cigarette pushers.
Stanford needs to send a firm mes
sage in response to these compa
nies' depraved advertising prac
tices.
The mission of the University —
a phrase that has been widely
bandied about by the administration
this year as it defends its budget cuts
— should be to promote scholarship
that leads to the advancement of the
human condition.
Maintaining a relationship with
firms such as Phillip Morris, which
act in demonstrably shameful ways
to sell their harmful products,
sends a contradictory message.
Stanford should follow the lead
of other universities — including
Harvard and Johns Hopkins —
and divest its tobacco stocks.
