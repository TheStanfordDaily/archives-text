Columnist simplifies
diversity among Jews
I am writing in response to a few
issues raised by Omar Wasow's column
in last Thursday's Daily. I am concerned
by Wasow's implication that Rabois'
comments had anything to do with his
being Jewish or conservative.
Although many students may support
Rabois' right to freedom of speech, few
think that he showed sound judgement
in exercising those rights in such a hate
ful way. Along with the mtyority of the
Stanford community, most members of
both the Jewish and conservative com
munities on campus find Rabois' senti
ments deplorable.
I am also concerned that Wasow's col
umn may have left his readers with the
incorrect impression that the Jewish
community at Stanford is primarily con
servative.
He writes, "The Jews I encountered
at Stanford were certainly active, but as
leaders of the College Republicans and
the Stanford Review." While Jewish stu
dents may indeed be involved in conser
vative campus organizations, many
Stanford Jews are also involved in pro
gressive student groups such as the
Stanford Homelessness Action Coalition,
Students for Environmental Action at
Stanford, the Women's Center Collec
tive, and the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center.
Wasow points out that he can't
regard the American Jewish community
as monolithic because, in his opinion,
New York Jews are liberal while the
Stanford ones are among the new breed
of '80s conservatives.
However, his assessment commits the
same mistake on the campus and com
munity level that he avoids making on
the national level. Just as Wasow real
izes that he cannot fairly perceive the
American Jewish community as mono
lithic, he cannot fairly characterize the
Stanford Jewish community as mono
lithic.

servative

Although he may not have encoun
tered them, there are conservative Jews
in New York and liberal ones here at
Stanford.
The Jewish community is so charac
terized by diversity, in fact, that there is
even an old adage: Whenever you have
two Jews, you have at least three opin
ions.
Just as is the case with most other
American communities, Jews espouse a
wide variety of interests, cultural prac
tices, political and religious beliefs. Gen
eralizations such as Wasow's unjustly
simplify this diversity.

Eating disorders are
prevalent on campus
I am writing to The Daily because I
know of no other way to reach some peo
ple in our community.
I was out running on Campus Drive
today when I passed two women, at two
separate times, running alone. I ran by
these women with a pain in my heart.
Later, I cried. Looking at them, I saw
myself... when I had anorexia.
I want people to know that it is not a
myth that eating disorders are prevalent
on our campus. Anorexia and bulimia
are devastating, self-inflicted diseases
that affect many of us, women and men.
For the women I saw today and for
others out there, you need to know that
you are not alone. You may be surprised
to learn that anorexia is a disease that is
known to afflict mainly high achieving,
intelligent and independent young
women.
I think the first thing to do to attack
an eating disorder is to admit there is a
problem, be it poor self-esteem or a dis
torted body image (not a simple step). If
you suspect a problem, do some inner
reflection; an eating disorder is usually a
manifestation of other psychological ills.

There are people to talk to and places
to go to get help. Talk to a friend, to the
Bridge, to Counseling and Psychological
Services, or get involved with a body
image group.
Eating disorders come in many shapes
and intensities. I just don't want to see
anyone else going through what I did.

Profs protest plan for
single language dept.
The undersigned professors believe
that the announced plan to group the
various literature programs of the sever
al extant language and literature depart
ments into one department will drop
Stanford University out of the running
as a place where students will be able to
do serious, advanced professional work
in the fields of European and Oriental
literature (including literary language).
Thirty years ago Stanford had such a
grouping, and it was deemed unworthy
of a leading university. The current
departments were formed and soon
achieved importance in the field of each.
They sent their Ph.D.s to positions in
the major departments around the coun
try and were generally rated high in rec
ognized surveys.
To our knowledge, there is no move
ment to weaken the study of national lit
eratures in any of the great universities
of America or Europe. Stanford will be
alone, and the ties of our departments
with their counterparts in sister institu
tions and with professional organiza
tions will be gravely damaged.
This sacrifice of academic excellence
and identity is too high a price to pay for
some minor economy in secretarial pool
ing, which seems to loom large in the
proposal.

Column helps restore
woman's faith in men
I'm writing in response to Cory Book
er's column in the Feb.l9 issue of The
Daily. I just wanted to express my pro
found appreciation of it.
Booker's honesty about his own feel
ings and real ability to listen and hear
the voices of women is remarkable to me.
My faith has been restored somewhat in
a man's ability to understand a woman's
experience, especially in relation to rape.
I teach self-defense here at Stanford
and my class often talks about ways to
make the men in our lives understand
our fear and pain, but we never seem to
get too far on this. We talk about how we
want men to be able to listen to us, really
listen to what we are saying and feeling.
I think that in addition to being able
to do this, Booker also has done some
thing even more valuable through his
column, which is having men communi
cate with other men about these issues
and how they are sociali2ed to rape.
I truly hope that his column has as
much of an impact on at least a few men
as it did on me.
Thanks again for honesty and caring
in dealing with these issues. It is rare to
find someone who approaches these
issues in such an intelligent and sensi
tive way.
