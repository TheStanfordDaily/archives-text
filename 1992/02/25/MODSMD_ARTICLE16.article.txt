## Pulling down barriers 
### 
PANIC GRIPS ME NOW, realizing
that I am a minority. Since coming
to Stanford, I've identified with
being Chinese-American. Yet perhaps
because there are a visible number of
some groups of Asians on campus, I
haven't considered myself a minority.
This is coupled with the fact that I've
generally felt like an equal member of the
Stanford community. But recent events
have made me question my place here.
A few weeks ago I pointed out that
John Bunzel's book, "Race Relations On
Campus: Stanford Students Speak,"
focuses on black and white relations. The
purpose of mentioning this book was not
to discredit the research, for it raises some
interesting points about black and white
relations. But because of its particular
emphasis, I questioned the presentation of
those issues as representative of the state
of race relations on campus as a whole.
There are many groups at Stanford.
While we/they may not historically be the
most vocal or the most visible, the issues
of racism, discrimination and prejudice
that involve us are equally important.
However, some people, including good
friends, have questioned the validity of
this belief. They ask what issues of
racism and discrimination exist for
Asian-Americans. One person suggested
that Asian-Americans and Chicanos have
for the large part assimilated while
African-Americans have not, thus the

greater importance on black and white
relations.
Hello, what do you mean ? The preju
dice I experience isn't worth talking
about ? And what do you mean by assimi
lation ?
A dictionary would define assimilation
as the process of taking in others and mak
ing them a part of the community or coun
try. But does that necessarily entail equal
ity or is it only the ability to work within
the system without ever progressing?
WTiat if you grew up in Chinatown or a
barrio? A reservation or some other
"ghetto"? Are these places a part of
"America"? Have you assimilated then,
or not?
The least assimilated in the U.S. are
the immigrants; they experience the
most discrimination and are least able to
defend themselves. Within any defini
tion, where your family is from, what
generation you are and what neighbor
hood you live in are important factors in
determining the degree of assimilation.
Thus blanket statements about any
racial group are misleading and deny the
diversity of experience.
But what do you mean? People who
have assimilated do not experience
racism or discrimination 1 ? What have I
experienced? Oh, I forgot. It's not worth
talking about. And white people must be
the most assimilated, so certainly they
can't know what it is either.

These past days I have been lost,
unable to understand why suddenly it
didn't matter that I was hurt, why no one
cared about my own prejudices that I
struggle with inside me or face from oth
ers.
And I realized that I truly was a
minority. Relegated to join the ranks of
the white majority as an assimilated Chi
nese-American or face absolute invisibili
ty as a non-player in campus politics or
anything else for that matter.
A great many of us have faced prejudice
at one point or another, whether it was
about race or class, gender or disability,
sexuality or age. More often than not,
these dividing lines are inextricably inter
twined. Rather than targeting black/white
relations, a holistic approach would
accomplish more change. For how can I
challenge prejudice against myself if I do
not also address my own misconceptions
of others?
If we do not address these issues now
while in this relatively safe environment,
we will take our prejudices with us into
the larger world.

Jane Lin is going to take on Chris Harris
next week.
