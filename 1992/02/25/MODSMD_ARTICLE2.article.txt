# Silverberg demotion yields mixed reactions
## 
### Holly Hacker Senior staff writer 
Several faculty and residents
at the Medical School yesterday
expressed outrage at Prof. Gerald
Silverberg's announcement that
he has been demoted, while oth
ers reserved comment and asked
that results of the investigation
into his case be made public.
Silverberg, whom Neurosurgery
Prof. Frances Conley accused of
sexism last year, said Friday that
he was losing his position as acting
chair of the Neurosurgery Depart
ment and will not be a candidate
for the permanent spot.
"I'm outraged," Assoc. Neuro
surgery Prof. Larry Shuer said
yesterday."I think it's a terrible
injustice, and I think the Univer
sity is doing incredible damage to
the reputation of one person."
Neurosurgery resident Allan
Efron, who said he was chosen as
a spokesman by all six residents
in the department, said, "I think
we're all dismayed and outraged
about the outcome. ... I think all
of the residents really resent it."
Medical School spokesman
Spyros Andreopoulos said yester
day that Conley is withholding

comment until she receives offi
cial word from the Medical School
about Silverberg's status.
Although Silverberg said he was
demoted by Medical School Dean
David Korn and University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy Wednesday,
Kennedy would not confirm Silver
berg's demotion in an interview
Sunday and insisted that last


Silverberg
week's meeting was meant to be
the first of several with Silverberg.
A six-page report investigating
Conley's allegations, which has
been seen by only Korn and
Kennedy, was submitted to them
Feb. 13 by a four-member com
mittee of faculty and staff from
the school.
Robert Cutler, the committee
chair and senior associate dean of
the Medical School, said only
Kennedy can release the report.
According to Assoc. Surgery
Prof. Denise Johnson "We don't
have enough information to be out
raged or not outraged. We need to
know what that report had to say."
She added, however, that Silver
berg's announcement leads her to
believe that the committee "must
have found some documentation of
sexual misconduct on his part."
"The problem is that we don't
know what happened," said med
ical student Karen Seal. Howev
er, she said, if Korn truly demot
ed Silverberg, that would be "a
message that the Medical School
is taking sexual harassment seri
ously and that they're starting to
do something about it."
Johnson challenged those who
argue that Silverberg was sacri
ficed by the University to avoid
bad publicity. Noting that the
attention the media paid to Con
ley has largely subsided since last
year, administrators "could've let
it die," she said. "They could've
kept things quiet."
Assoc. Neurosurgery Prof.
Gary Steinberg declined to com
ment, while Asst. Neurosurgery
Prof. John Adler could not be
reached yesterday. The Neuro
surgery department consists of
five professors: Adler, Conley,
Shuer, Silverberg and Steinberg.
Silverberg said Sunday that he
believes he was demoted because
"the school has become very sen
sitive to media pressure" and felt
it "couldn't stand any more
adverse publicity."
Shuer agreed, saying he
believes administrators are
"afraid of negative publicity and
the possibility of incurring a sexu
al harassment suit, which I think
has no merit. I think they're try
ing to limit the damage and
they're willing to sacrifice Dr. Sil
verberg."

Efron said all six residents
"agree he's been railroaded."
He said the residents are con
cerned that losing Silverberg's
leadership as department chair
will adversely affect the medical
training they receive.
"We all think he's a fantastic
educator," he said, adding that
another chair may not give resi
dents the amount of responsibili
ty and time in the operating room
that Silverberg has.
Efron also said that many resi
dents, including himself, came to
Stanford specifically to train
under Silverberg. Now, he said,
residents "are going to end up get
ting training somewhat different
from what they bargained for."
But now, Efron said, "our
recruitment is completely on hold
until there's a new person appoint
ed to the chairmanship. ... A
change such as this paralyzes the
entire department."
Conley resigned last May when
she learned that Silverberg would be
promoted to the permanent chair
manship of the department. He had
been the acting chair for two years.
Conley, who says she has no
designs on the position, accused
him of making sexist remarks,
fondling and propositioning her.
In September, Conley reversed
her decision and announced she
was returning to the Medical
School because she believed she
could make more of a difference
from the inside.

residents "are going to end up get
ting training somewhat different
from what they bargained for."
But now, Efron said, "our
recruitment is completely on hold
until there's a new person appoint

change such as this paralyzes the
entire department."
Conley resigned last May when
she learned that Silverberg would be
promoted to the permanent chair
manship of the department. He had
been the acting chair for two years.
Conley, who says she has no
designs on the position, accused
him of making sexist remarks,
fondling and propositioning her.
In September, Conley reversed
her decision and announced she
was returning to the Medical
School because she believed she
could make more of a difference
from the inside.

Several faculty and residents
at the Medical School yesterday
expressed outrage at Prof. Gerald
Silverberg's announcement that
he has been demoted, while oth
ers reserved comment and asked
that results of the investigation
into his case be made public.
Silverberg, whom Neurosurgery
Prof. Frances Conley accused of
sexism last year, said Friday that
he was losing his position as acting
chair of the Neurosurgery Depart
ment and will not be a candidate
for the permanent spot.
"I'm outraged," Assoc. Neuro
surgery Prof. Larry Shuer said
yesterday."I think it's a terrible
injustice, and I think the Univer
sity is doing incredible damage to
the reputation of one person."
Neurosurgery resident Allan
Efron, who said he was chosen as
a spokesman by all six residents
in the department, said, "I think
we're all dismayed and outraged
about the outcome. ... I think all
of the residents really resent it."
Medical School spokesman
Spyros Andreopoulos said yester
day that Conley is withholding

comment until she receives offi
cial word from the Medical School
about Silverberg's status.
Although Silverberg said he was
demoted by Medical School Dean
David Korn and University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy Wednesday,
Kennedy would not confirm Silver
berg's demotion in an interview
Sunday and insisted that last


Silverberg
week's meeting was meant to be
the first of several with Silverberg.
A six-page report investigating
Conley's allegations, which has
been seen by only Korn and
Kennedy, was submitted to them
Feb. 13 by a four-member com
mittee of faculty and staff from
the school.
Robert Cutler, the committee
chair and senior associate dean of
the Medical School, said only
Kennedy can release the report.
According to Assoc. Surgery
Prof. Denise Johnson "We don't
have enough information to be out
raged or not outraged. We need to
know what that report had to say."
She added, however, that Silver
berg's announcement leads her to
believe that the committee "must
have found some documentation of
sexual misconduct on his part."
"The problem is that we don't
know what happened," said med
ical student Karen Seal. Howev
er, she said, if Korn truly demot
ed Silverberg, that would be "a
message that the Medical School
is taking sexual harassment seri
ously and that they're starting to
do something about it."
Johnson challenged those who
argue that Silverberg was sacri
ficed by the University to avoid
bad publicity. Noting that the
attention the media paid to Con
ley has largely subsided since last
year, administrators "could've let
it die," she said. "They could've
kept things quiet."
Assoc. Neurosurgery Prof.
Gary Steinberg declined to com
ment, while Asst. Neurosurgery
Prof. John Adler could not be
reached yesterday. The Neuro
surgery department consists of
five professors: Adler, Conley,
Shuer, Silverberg and Steinberg.
Silverberg said Sunday that he
believes he was demoted because
"the school has become very sen
sitive to media pressure" and felt
it "couldn't stand any more
adverse publicity."
Shuer agreed, saying he
believes administrators are
"afraid of negative publicity and
the possibility of incurring a sexu
al harassment suit, which I think
has no merit. I think they're try
ing to limit the damage and
they're willing to sacrifice Dr. Sil
verberg."

Efron said all six residents
"agree he's been railroaded."
He said the residents are con
cerned that losing Silverberg's
leadership as department chair
will adversely affect the medical
training they receive.
"We all think he's a fantastic
educator," he said, adding that
another chair may not give resi
dents the amount of responsibili
ty and time in the operating room
that Silverberg has.
Efron also said that many resi
dents, including himself, came to
Stanford specifically to train
under Silverberg. Now, he said,
residents "are going to end up get
ting training somewhat different
from what they bargained for."
But now, Efron said, "our
recruitment is completely on hold
