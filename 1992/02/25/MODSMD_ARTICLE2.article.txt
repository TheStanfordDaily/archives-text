# Silverberg demotion yields mixed reactions
## 
### Holly Hacker Senior staff writer 
Several faculty and residents
at the Medical School yesterday
expressed outrage at Prof. Gerald
Silverberg's announcement that
he has been demoted, while oth
ers reserved comment and asked
that results of the investigation
into his case be made public.
Silverberg, whom Neurosurgery
Prof. Frances Conley accused of
sexism last year, said Friday that
he was losing his position as acting
chair of the Neurosurgery Depart
ment and will not be a candidate
for the permanent spot.
"I'm outraged," Assoc. Neuro
surgery Prof. Larry Shuer said
yesterday."I think it's a terrible
injustice, and I think the Univer
sity is doing incredible damage to
the reputation of one person."
Neurosurgery resident Allan
Efron, who said he was chosen as
a spokesman by all six residents
in the department, said, "I think
we're all dismayed and outraged
about the outcome. ... I think all
of the residents really resent it."
Medical School spokesman
Spyros Andreopoulos said yester
day that Conley is withholding

comment until she receives offi
cial word from the Medical School
about Silverberg's status.
Although Silverberg said he was
demoted by Medical School Dean
David Korn and University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy Wednesday,
Kennedy would not confirm Silver
berg's demotion in an interview
Sunday and insisted that last


Silverberg
