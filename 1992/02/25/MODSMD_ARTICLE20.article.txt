## Card batters combat USF 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Perfect weather for a baseball game, isn't it? The
sunny and cloudless skies provide an excellent
opportunity to watch the Cardinal take on the San
Francisco Dons today at Sunken Diamond.
USF is not of the caliber of Pepperdine or Hawaii,
but, then again, neither was San Jose State.
Stanford seems to have had a mid-week curse.
Last season, the Cardinal lost to such perennial
powerhouses as Sacramento State (twice), San Jose
State, UC-Davis, and Pacific in Tuesday or Wednes
day games. Research shows that these losses, more
times than not, came after Stanford had won two or
all three games from their opponent of the previous
weekend series. In other words, after beating good
teams like Arizona State, USC, or California, the
Cardinal would fall to seemingly lesser opponents.
Just last week, after sweeping a series from fourth
ranked Pepperdine, Stanford dropped an easy win to
San Jose State.
Why does this type of thing keep happening? One
explanation could definitely be one of letdown; after
expending tremendous physical and mental energy
against talented opposition, there is little left for
anyone else, even a "gimme" team.
Another explanation could be that there is no
such thing as a gimme in college baseball. The ol'
"on any given day anything can happen" cliche has
some credibility. One rightly-guessed pitch or one
fielding error can turn the tide of an entire game.
But letdowns and mistakes are things which
great baseball teams must overcome. And at 2 p.m.
today at Sunken Diamond, the Cardinal will show if
the mid-week curse really has any substance.

Bob Hillman of the No. 3 men's volleyball team makes yet another flawless pass. The
spikers lost to No. 1 Long Beach but notched two big road wins against No. 2 Pep
perdins and UC-!rvine this weekend.
