# On the road again
## Softball travels to St. Mary's 
### David Hyatt 
After two weeks of rained out games, including last
Saturday's scheduled home opener against Humboldt
State, the Stanford women's Softball team will try to
take the field once again, visiting St. Mary's this after
noon.
Team members are eager to get their inaugural sea
son moving. Softball action has been rare of late
throughout Northern California, as the recent storms
have rendered most of the area's fields impossibly soggy.
Here at Stanford, infield-outfield drills and batting prac
tices have been replaced by anti-precipitation dances.
• • The Cardinal season began in early February, before
the rains, with losses at Sonoma State, Pacific, and Cal
State Hayward. Bright spots for the team included
heads-up fielding, mature pitching from freshman
Karla Starr, and spectacular diving catches by junior
outfielders Eva Bunker and Kendra Killpatrick.
Bunker wowed the crowd at Hayward by twice taking
out the outfield fence.
The softball team may be Stanford's version of the
endearing Jamaican bobsled team. But, as some good
natured players put it, "at least the Jamaicans have a
bobsled." The new varsity team, with no funding,
faces nationally ranked teams of recruited scholarship
athletes, including players from America's Pan-Am
team.
The team practices at Roble Field, but this year's
mere six home dates will be at the El Camino Field,
across the street from the Stanford Shopping Center.
The Cardinal is forced to sacrifice much of its home field
advantage because NCAA regulations require fields
with outfield fences, and the fenced-in El Camino field,
oft the Stanford campus, sports a limited availability.
Thanks to the rain-outs, the doubleheaders against
Oregon and Oregon State on March 7 and 8 now serve
as home openers. With only four other home dates,
traveling fan support will be key for the nearby road
games. Fast-pitch fans can catch the Cardinal against
St. Mary's in Moraga today at 1:45 p.m., at Santa
Clara's Lafayette Park Saturday at noon, and at San
Jose State's Muni Stadium the following Wednesday at
6 p.m. All dates are doubleheaders of seven inning
games.
