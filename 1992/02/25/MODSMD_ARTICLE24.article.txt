# Spikers go 2 of 3
## Fall to 49ers, beat Waves, Anteaters 
### Laurie Wackier Staff writer 
After stalling against No. 1
Long Beach State in the opening
match of a weekend road trip to
Southern California, the men's
volleyball team revved up and
upset second ranked Pepper
dine, then found the fuel to run
over UC-Irvine. The Card
returns home with a 8-1 confer
ence record and a 10-2 overall
mark.
In what head coach Ruben
Nieves termed "an off night", the
spikers fell to Long Beach State
Friday (15-10, 15-10,17-15), slid
ing to second place in the Wilson
division of the Western Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association,
behind the undefeated 49'ers.
"We just didn't play up to our
standards," explained Nieves of
his third-ranked team. "Our
offense requires a lot of precision
and timing, and we just weren't
clicking."
The squad compiled a chilly
.280 hitting average for the
match, well below their season
average of .393. Duncan Black
man led Stanford with a .387
average on 16 kills.
However, the Card fared bet
ter against Pepperdine Sunday,
bringing their offense back to par
in an exciting five game victory,
16-14, 15-2, 10-15, 14-16, 15-11.
Signs of Friday's frazzled
team surfaced early in the match,
as Stanford trailed throughout
game one. But the spikers turned
things around, seizing control
just in time to steal the game
from the Waves.
Sparked by sophomore Joe
Burghardt and junior John Bez
malinovic, Stanford retained con
trol in game two, posting a 13-0
lead on 14 consecutive sideouts.
While Burghardt turned on the
pressure from the service line,
Bezmalinovic menaced Pepper
dine's hitters with intimidating
blocking.
Down two games to none and
facing the prospect of an upset,
the Waves responded with an
explosive third game, wresting
control from Stanford. "It was
kind of a roller-coaster match,"

'Our offense

precision and tim
ing, and we just

Nieves remarked.
Neither team was willing to
get off the ride. In game four, the
squads battled to a 7-7 tie, before
Stanford streaked to a 14-7 lead.
But Nieves got that sinking feel
ing when Pepperdine's Tom
Sorenson, who collected 45 kills
and hit .470, battered the Cardi
nal defense and tied the score at
two games apiece.
Sorenson continued his tirade
into game five, as the Waves
jumped to a 3-1 lead. That's
when Bezmalinovic decided that
he had been on the roller coaster
long enough.
"They had a lead in game
five," Nieves explained. "Then
Bez kind of took over the match."
Bezmalinovic recorded 14 kills in
the contest, en route to an
impressive .667 hitting percent
age.
Joining Bez for offensive hon
ors were Dave Goss (31 kills),
Duncan Blackman (22 kills) and
Burghardt (18 kills). Burghardt
also tallied five service aces.
Last night the spikers made
their final stop, a quick visit to
Irvine, where they defeated the
Anteaters in three short games,
15-7, 15-6, 15-10. Irvine falls to
1-7 in conference play.
Once again, Burghardt and
Bezmalinovic, the Card's duo of
middle blockers, dominated the
match. In addition to a combined
hitting percentage of .500, the
pair punished the Anteaters with
five service aces.
Coming off the bench in game
two, Jimmy Blackman and Bob
Hillman also gave Stanford a lifl,
with effective, all-around perfor
mances.

Anteaters in three short games,
15-7, 15-6, 15-10. Irvine falls to
1-7 in conference play.
Once again, Burghardt and
Bezmalinovic, the Card's duo of
middle blockers, dominated the
match. In addition to a combined
hitting percentage of .500, the
pair punished the Anteaters with
five service aces.
Coming off the bench in game
two, Jimmy Blackman and Bob
Hillman also gave Stanford a lifl,
with effective, all-around perfor
mances.
