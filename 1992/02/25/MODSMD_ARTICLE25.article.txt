# Gaels surprise ruggers
## 
### Trevor Brown 
Last Friday, Stanford rugby coach Franck
Boivert set a goal for his players in their
upcoming match against the Gaels of Saint
Mary's College. "Cal beat St. Mary's 40-0.
Just think about this score when you play
them tomorrow," he said.
The dominant Cardinal figured to make
easy work of a supposedly unexperienced
and untalented Gael squad. But the Gaels
proved to be more than a patsy, dealing the
Card a bruising defeat.
All started as fly-half Mark Mayfield
zipped through a hole in the Gael defense to
put Stanford on the board first. But Saint
Mary's answered right back and scored a try
of their own. The score was tied 4-4.
For the next 30 minutes, the two squads
traded scores until the tally read 11-10 in
favor of Saint Mary's. It still looked as if
Stanford could work their magic and stay
undefeated in the Pacific Coast Conference,

but in the waning moments of the game the
Gaels erupted offensively, blasting through
the Cardinal defense. In the last 15 minutes,
Saint Mary's scored nine points to bring
Stanford to its knees, 20-10.
The Cardinal ruggers left the field deject
ed and baffled.
"I can't figure it out," said a perplexed
prop John Hamilton. "We dominated them
all over the field, but we couldn't win."
"We played as individuals," said number
eight, Ed Stevens. "Rugby is the consum
mate team sport, and today we shamed the
game of rugby."
With four games left in their PCC sched
ule, Stanford (4-1) has to pull off some big
wins to make it into the playoffs. All four
games are away, and all four games will be
very difficult. But Stanford has proven they
are a high-caliber team, beating the likes of
UC-Santa Clara and Chico State.
The Cardinal ruggers travel this upcom
ing Saturday to combat UC-Davis.
