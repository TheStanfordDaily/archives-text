# An eighth Bookstore manager is provided with a car
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The Daily reported Feb. 5 that
at least seven Bookstore man
agers have use of automobiles
owned or leased by the Bookstore.
Well, make that at least eight. . .
Ken Shark, the store's manag
er of retail operations, appears to
have use of a 1992 Ford Explorer.
Shark was seen Friday driving the
vehicle away from a Stanford
parking lot to Blockbuster Video
on El Camino Real.
The Explorer is owned by the
Stanford Bookstore, according to
Department of Motor Vehicle
records. The Bookstore became the
registered owner in mid-January,
the records show, but the vehicle
has had license plates for only
about a week. (The DMV provides
ownership and registration infor
mation based on plate numbers.)
The Explorer, the interior of
which was custom-made by Eddie
Bauer, likely cost the Bookstore

This 1992 Ford Explorer is owned by the Bookstore and appears to
be driven by Ken Shark, the store's manager of retail operations.
Besides Shark, at least seven other Bookstore employees are pro
vided with vehicles owned or leased by the store. Providing multiple
employees with cars is a practice unheard of elsewhere in the col
lege bookstore industry.
