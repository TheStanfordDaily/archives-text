## 'Phase two' of cuts will restructure University 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
As a leader in Stanford's bud
get-cutting process, Chemistry
Prof. Richard Zare realizes that
once Stanford finishes trimming
its fat, it still faces the perennial
dieter's challenge: keeping it off.
But at the same time, Zare
says he would like to see the Uni
versity build up a little strength.
"If we complete all of the bud
get reductions but do not go
through [the next step], we will

end up with less," said the chair of
the Faculty Senate Committee on
Education and Scholarship at
Stanford. "We want to work
toward elevating people's imagina
tion as to what this place can be."
The next step in the year-long
budget process is "phase two,"
during which faculty will discuss
ways of restructuring the Univer
sity's academic organization.
"We want to examine ways of
reshaping the University. What
type of school divisions should we
have? Should there be depart
ments who belong to more than
one school?" Zare asked.
Although Zare said he prefers
to keep secret his own ideas about
how the University should be
structured, he suggested a variety
of proposals that might be exam
ined in phase two.
"One of the recommendations
from the [senate budget commit
tee] was that we should place
emphasis in dealing with the
undergraduate experience in its
totality. We want to discuss various
models of doing that," Zare said.
Among the ideas considered by
the faculty committee has been
the creation of an undergraduate
college, which would govern every
thing from distribution require
ments to overseas studies.
The restoration of an undergrad
uate dean, or perhaps a similar
administrator with a different

name, is also something Zare wants
to examine, even though it is unlike
ly to produce additional savings.
"It is very likely these ideas will
cost money," Zare said.
Another idea discussed has
been splitting the School of
Humanities and Sciences into
three schools: Natural Sciences,
Humanities and Social Sciences.
The proposal has gained support
as the school struggled through a
budget process which made lines
of cleavage within the school
apparent and agreement on reduc
tions difficult.
"Maybe we should change the
current governance of Humanities
and Sciences.... The point is so
that we can bring to bear better
groups to represent constituents
in processes," Zare said.
"We may decide that what we
have now is best," Zare said. "But
this is the time to rethink it."
University President Donald
Kennedy, an organizer of phase
two, said he wants the process to
find ways to strengthen Stanford.
"The hope is that we can make
some structural changes in the

academic organization. This will
allow us to become a more effec
tive organization at a reduced
level of resources," Kennedy said.
For now, phase two is being led
by the senate budget committee.
Members are meeting for about
one hour with groups of 10 to 15
faculty "representing a cross-cut
of the University," Zare said.
"We want to have a particular
emphasis on involving younger
faculty, because they represent
the future of the institution," he
added. Faculty forums to discuss
ideas emerging from small-group
meetings will also be held.
The senate committee, howev
er, will not be the only group
involved in phase two much
longer. Kennedy said a successor
to the Cabinet Committee on Bud
get and Strategic Planning will be
named "quite soon."
With Kennedy leaving in
August, Zare said he hopes phase
two will allow open discussions
before the new president arrives.
"The idea is not to reach a con
clusion," Zare said. "The idea is to
say to the new president that

these are some of the things we
have discussed."
Kennedy said he wants to "take
a major role, at least in establishing
the process and defining choices."
"I suspect we would not make
any major changes in the academ
ic organization" before the new
president had a chance to arrive,
he added.
Both Zare and Kennedy said
now is the time for phase two
because the University is just con
cluding an intense period of intro
spection to reduce the budget.
<r We have sharpened our under
standing of what this place is
about.... Where we are effective is
to worry about questions of great
academic content," Zare said.
Kennedy said the "urgent mat
ter of budget cuts" had to take first
priority, but the University should
now take advantage of the "knowl
edgeable base" developed among
the faculty and administration.
Beginning a process similar to
phase two "cold" without having
spent months studying the Uni
versity would have been "hard to
do," Kennedy added.

Kennedy said he wants to "take
a major role, at least in establishing
the process and defining choices."
"I suspect we would not make
any major changes in the academ
ic organization" before the new
president had a chance to arrive,
he added.
Both Zare and Kennedy said
now is the time for phase two
because the University is just con
cluding an intense period of intro
spection to reduce the budget.
<r We have sharpened our under
standing of what this place is
about.... Where we are effective is
to worry about questions of great
academic content," Zare said.
Kennedy said the "urgent mat
ter of budget cuts" had to take first
priority, but the University should
now take advantage of the "knowl
edgeable base" developed among
the faculty and administration.
Beginning a process similar to
phase two "cold" without having
spent months studying the Uni
versity would have been "hard to
do," Kennedy added.
As a leader in Stanford's bud
get-cutting process, Chemistry
Prof. Richard Zare realizes that
once Stanford finishes trimming
its fat, it still faces the perennial
dieter's challenge: keeping it off.
But at the same time, Zare
says he would like to see the Uni
versity build up a little strength.
"If we complete all of the bud
get reductions but do not go
through [the next step], we will

end up with less," said the chair of
the Faculty Senate Committee on
Education and Scholarship at
Stanford. "We want to work
toward elevating people's imagina
tion as to what this place can be."
The next step in the year-long
budget process is "phase two,"
during which faculty will discuss
ways of restructuring the Univer
sity's academic organization.
"We want to examine ways of
reshaping the University. What
type of school divisions should we
have? Should there be depart
ments who belong to more than
one school?" Zare asked.
Although Zare said he prefers
to keep secret his own ideas about
how the University should be
structured, he suggested a variety
of proposals that might be exam
ined in phase two.
"One of the recommendations
from the [senate budget commit
tee] was that we should place
emphasis in dealing with the
undergraduate experience in its
totality. We want to discuss various
models of doing that," Zare said.
Among the ideas considered by
the faculty committee has been
the creation of an undergraduate
college, which would govern every
thing from distribution require
ments to overseas studies.
The restoration of an undergrad
uate dean, or perhaps a similar
administrator with a different

name, is also something Zare wants
to examine, even though it is unlike
ly to produce additional savings.
"It is very likely these ideas will
cost money," Zare said.
Another idea discussed has
been splitting the School of
Humanities and Sciences into
three schools: Natural Sciences,
Humanities and Social Sciences.
The proposal has gained support
as the school struggled through a
budget process which made lines
of cleavage within the school
apparent and agreement on reduc
tions difficult.
"Maybe we should change the
current governance of Humanities
and Sciences.... The point is so
that we can bring to bear better
groups to represent constituents
in processes," Zare said.
"We may decide that what we
have now is best," Zare said. "But
this is the time to rethink it."
University President Donald
Kennedy, an organizer of phase
two, said he wants the process to
find ways to strengthen Stanford.
"The hope is that we can make
some structural changes in the

academic organization. This will
allow us to become a more effec
tive organization at a reduced
level of resources," Kennedy said.
For now, phase two is being led
by the senate budget committee.
Members are meeting for about
one hour with groups of 10 to 15
faculty "representing a cross-cut
of the University," Zare said.
"We want to have a particular
emphasis on involving younger
faculty, because they represent
the future of the institution," he
added. Faculty forums to discuss
ideas emerging from small-group
meetings will also be held.
The senate committee, howev
er, will not be the only group
involved in phase two much
longer. Kennedy said a successor
to the Cabinet Committee on Bud
get and Strategic Planning will be
named "quite soon."
With Kennedy leaving in
August, Zare said he hopes phase
two will allow open discussions
before the new president arrives.
"The idea is not to reach a con
clusion," Zare said. "The idea is to
say to the new president that

these are some of the things we
have discussed."
Kennedy said he wants to "take
a major role, at least in establishing
the process and defining choices."
"I suspect we would not make
any major changes in the academ
ic organization" before the new
president had a chance to arrive,
he added.
