# Bookstore faces inquiry by state
## Attorney General launches probe 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
California's Attorney General
has begun an investigation of the
Stanford Bookstore to determine
if the nonprofit store's compensa
tion practices are in violation of
state law.
"We have an open-investiga
tion file on the matter," Deputy
Attorney General Jim Schwartz
said in an interview yesterday.
"We are looking into it."
The probe was apparently
prompted by a Feb. 5 report in
The Daily which disclosed that the
Bookstore provides perquisites
that are unheard of elsewhere in
the industry to its senior employ
ees. The perquisites include use of
a vacation home, a motor home, a
sailboat and several top-of-the
line automobiles.
The vacation home and motor
home are owned by the store's top
two managers, Eldon Speed and
Philip Chiaramonte, and are
leased back to the Bookstore
through a consulting firm the two
managers operate.
In a statement released yester
day afternoon, the Bookstore
pledged full cooperation with the
state's inquiry.
"We have told the Attorney
General's staff that we will coop
erate fully with it, and the cooper
ative effort has already begun,"
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg, one
of the Bookstore's directors, said
in the statement.
The Attorney General's inves
tigation will likely take about

three months,
Schwartz said. If
the Bookstore is
found to have vio
lated California's
Nonprofit Corpo
ration Law, he
said, the state will
seek "voluntary
remedies." These
remedies could

include payments of restitution or
the removal of the corporation's
officers, he said.
Meanwhile, the Bookstore's
board of directors announced yes
terday that its own review of the
store's compensation practices is
now underway. "We want to
know what problems may exist
and whether they involve Califor
nia law, federal law or any other
standards of business propriety,"
Weisberg said in a statement.
"We regard the law as stating
only the minimal standards of
acceptable behavior," he said.
"There may be other matters
which should be corrected,
beyond questions of legal compli
ance, and we intend to address
whatever problems the investiga
tion discloses."
Board members have said previ
ously that they were not aware of
the full range of perquisites the
store provides its senior employees.
The board announced yester
day that it has retained two law
firms to conduct its review: Los
Angeles-based Tuttle & Taylor,
which specializes in tax law; and
