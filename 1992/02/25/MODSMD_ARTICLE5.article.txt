# Bookstore faces inquiry by state
## Attorney General launches probe 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
California's Attorney General
has begun an investigation of the
Stanford Bookstore to determine
if the nonprofit store's compensa
tion practices are in violation of
state law.
"We have an open-investiga
tion file on the matter," Deputy
Attorney General Jim Schwartz
said in an interview yesterday.
"We are looking into it."
The probe was apparently
prompted by a Feb. 5 report in
The Daily which disclosed that the
Bookstore provides perquisites
that are unheard of elsewhere in
the industry to its senior employ
ees. The perquisites include use of
a vacation home, a motor home, a
sailboat and several top-of-the
line automobiles.
The vacation home and motor
home are owned by the store's top
two managers, Eldon Speed and
Philip Chiaramonte, and are
leased back to the Bookstore
through a consulting firm the two
managers operate.
In a statement released yester
day afternoon, the Bookstore
pledged full cooperation with the
state's inquiry.
"We have told the Attorney
General's staff that we will coop
erate fully with it, and the cooper
ative effort has already begun,"
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg, one
of the Bookstore's directors, said
in the statement.
The Attorney General's inves
tigation will likely take about

three months,
Schwartz said. If
the Bookstore is
found to have vio
lated California's
Nonprofit Corpo
ration Law, he
said, the state will
seek "voluntary
remedies." These
remedies could

include payments of restitution or
the removal of the corporation's
officers, he said.
Meanwhile, the Bookstore's
board of directors announced yes
terday that its own review of the
store's compensation practices is
now underway. "We want to
know what problems may exist
and whether they involve Califor
nia law, federal law or any other
standards of business propriety,"
Weisberg said in a statement.
"We regard the law as stating
only the minimal standards of
acceptable behavior," he said.
"There may be other matters
which should be corrected,
beyond questions of legal compli
ance, and we intend to address
whatever problems the investiga
tion discloses."
Board members have said previ
ously that they were not aware of
the full range of perquisites the
store provides its senior employees.
The board announced yester
day that it has retained two law
firms to conduct its review: Los
Angeles-based Tuttle & Taylor,
which specializes in tax law; and


Weisberg
• That the Bookstore has
replaced its longtime outside
auditor and tax preparer, Abbott,
Stringham & Lynch, with the Big
Six accounting firm of Deloitte &
Touche;
• That the store has retained a
compensation consultant to
review the Bookstore's "scheme
of executive compensation"; and
• That the board of directors is
considering the appointment of
"several distinguished outsiders"
to serve as an unpaid advisory
group.
Weisberg also noted yesterday
that he expects the Bookstore to
select a replacement within about
a week for Sociology Prof San
ford Dornbusch, who resigned
from the store's board of directors
on Feb. 12. Upon his resignation,
Dornbusch said he was frustrated
by "the legalistic direction" the
board had taken in addressing the
disclosures in The Daily.
The president of the Book
store's board of directors, History
Prof. Peter Stansky, has refused
to comment in recent days on
matters related to the Bookstore.
Stansky has instead been refer
ring calls to Weisberg, who, he
says, has been designated as the
board's spokesperson.

San Francisco-based Silk, Adler &
Colvin, which specializes in non
profit corporate law. The account
ing firm of Neilson, Elggren &
Durkin & Co. will also assist in
the review, the board said in its
statement.
"These lawyers and accoun
tants all come highly recommend
ed," Weisberg said. "In addition,
none has ever represented the
management or board of the
Bookstore before."
Weisberg said in a brief inter
view that he expects the cost of
the review to be "reasonable." Fie
said he has no reason to believe
that legal and accounting costs
will drive up book prices or result
in a smaller year-end rebate.
According to the board's state
ment, the review will take two to
three months. Upon completion, a
report containing major findings
and recommendations will be
released to the Stanford commu
nity, the statement said.
The Bookstore's board also
announced several other moves
yesterday. Among them:

The review will take two to three months.
Upon completion, a report containing major
findings and recommendations will be
released to the Stanford community.

Asked yesterday if the Book
store's management enjoys the
full confidence of the board of
directors, Weisberg replied: "No
comment."
The vacation home the Book
store leases from Speed and
Chiaramonte's consulting firm is
located in Twain Harte, Calif.,
which is about 125 miles east of
Stanford on the edge of the
Stanislaus National Forest.
In addition to thousands of dol
lars in lease payments made to
Speed and Chiaramonte's con
sulting firm, the Bookstore has
spent more than $69,000 to fur
nish the two-story, 3,100 square
ft. home, The Daily disclosed on
Feb. 5. Purchases made with
Bookstore funds included a
$4,341 hot tub and a $5,888 satel
lite dish.
Speed, the bookstore's general
manager, and Chiaramonte, its

assistant manager, are among the
best-paid college bookstore man
agers in the country. Both make
more than $100,000 a year. The
perquisites they and several other
senior Stanford Bookstore employ
ees receive are unheard of elsewhere
in the industry, The Daily found.
At Harvard University's book
store, for example, where sales
are 60 percent higher than at
Stanford, none of the employees
is provided with vacation facilities
or an automobile.
The only other major college
bookstore known to provide any
of its employees with a vehicle is
the University of Washington,
where the top store manager
drives the bookstore van to and
from work. During the workday,
the same van is used to make
store deliveries.
Speed did not return phone
calls yesterday.
