Picture an Asian-American.
You might see someone who is
Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai,
Filipino, Vietnamese, Cambodian,

freshman class, Assistant Dean
of Student Affairs Rick Yuen
said, "It would difficult to justify
targeting Asians as a whole
because of the numbers.
"But I think there is an argu

certain ethnicities within the
Asian population, like Filipinos,"
Yuen said. "We need to look at
our numbers among Filipinos,
Vietnamese students and other
Southeast Asian students as
well. Then there's the question
of Native Hawaiians."
No policy change yet
James Montoya, Dean of Under
graduate Admissions, agreed that
the issue of diversity within the
Asian-American community mer
its increased discussion. "The
Asian community is comprised of

Murakawa, who is Japanese-
American; Cindy Nguyen,
who is Vietnamese-American;

American; and Rich Lee, who
is Korean-American.
