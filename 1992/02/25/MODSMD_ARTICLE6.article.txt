# Stanford's hidden diversity

### Carrie Chang Staff writer 
Picture an Asian-American.
You might see someone who is
Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai,
Filipino, Vietnamese, Cambodian,
Laotian, East Indian or Native
Hawaiian.
But judging from records at
the Registrar's office, they are all
the same.
Despite the diverse range of
ethnicities within their communi
ty, Asian-Americans are all placed
in one category for the purpose of
statistics and the Office of Under
graduate Admissions.
"What happens a lot of times is
we get lumped into one big group
of Asian-Americans, and people
don't realize there's a big differ
ence between a fourth-generation
Chinese-American and a recent
immigrant from South Asia,"

Under-represented
subgroups within the
Asian-American com
munity are frequent
ly overlooked and
overshadowed.

The various subgroups within
the Asian-American community
are not monitored by the Office
of Undergraduate Admissions.
As a result, ethnicities within
the community that are under
represented on campus — and
might be eligible for recruitment
— can be overlooked.
Since Asians currently com
prise 24.9 percent of Stanford's

freshman class, Assistant Dean
of Student Affairs Rick Yuen
said, "It would difficult to justify
targeting Asians as a whole
because of the numbers.
"But I think there is an argu
ment to be made for targeting
certain ethnicities within the
Asian population, like Filipinos,"
Yuen said. "We need to look at
our numbers among Filipinos,
Vietnamese students and other
Southeast Asian students as
well. Then there's the question
of Native Hawaiians."
No policy change yet
James Montoya, Dean of Under
graduate Admissions, agreed that
the issue of diversity within the
Asian-American community mer
its increased discussion. "The
Asian community is comprised of

Representing the wide range

Asian-American community

ipino-American; Dawnalyn
Murakawa, who is Japanese-
American; Cindy Nguyen,
who is Vietnamese-American;

American; and Rich Lee, who
is Korean-American.

many subgroups with a complex set
of challenges," Montoya said "Our
admissions process should reflect
that."
Montoya added that a
round table discussion with vari
ous ethnic communities will be
held at the end of the quarter to
discuss admissions policies.
In 1989, the review panel of
the University Committee on
Minority Issues recommended
that the University recognize and
target certain Asian subgroups,
especially in areas of admissions
and financial aid. No official
action has been taken on this rec
ommendation, however.
The issue has been discussed by
the Faculty Senate and Provost's
Committee on Faculty Recruit
ment, but no resolution has been
reached, according to Sharon
Parker, director of the Multicul
tural Development Office.
Parker said the issue may be
"too complex" for some, and many
"are not ready to deal with it."
The report recommended that
Filipinos, Southeast Asians and
Native Hawaiians be designated
targeted minorities so they would
be assigned an admissions officer
with primary recruiting responsi
bility and would qualify for finan
cial aid benefits.
To be targeted for affirmative
action, an ethnic group must be
under-represented by both
national and state standards —
with that under-representation
resulting from historical discrimi
nation in this country.
Because Asian-Americans as a
whole are not considered under
represented on campus, none of
the various ethnicities within the
Asian population are considered
targeted minorities. However,
some of the subgroups — when
viewed separately — may match
the profile.
Who should be targeted?
"Way back at some point, there
was a designation system that
tracked Chinese-Americans,
Japanese-Americans, and 'Other,"
said Cecilia Evangelista, Assistant
Director of Admissions. However,
"That 'Other' has been growing
phenomenally in the last few years
because of immigration patterns,
because of growth patterns.

"The demographics have
changed as such and I think it's
almost imperative that we look at
that closely," Evangelista said.
"It's my minimal hope that we
start looking at how the different
subgroups are doing," she said.
"Within the Asian-American
population, you have the Filipino-
Americans, the Southeast Asians,
the Pacific Islanders. All three of
those groups sort of fit the catego
ry of the disadvantaged minori
ty," said Evangelista. "If you look
at the profiles, the kind of schools
they are attending, English as a
second language, recent immigra
tion — things like that. They look
in a lot of ways like students in
the targeted group," she said.
Sophomore Ernie Sibal, who is
president of the Filipino American
Student Union, said "it all comes
down to the economics of it."
"If you look at the Asian popu
lation, Filipinos won't be in the
upper echelon of the income
bracket," Sibal said. "Most Fil
ipinos can't really afford to go to
Stanford, so they choose the
[schools in the University of Cali
fornia system] instead.
"If you look at a place like
UCLA or Berkeley, the numbers
are much higher. There's really
an underrepresentation [at Stan
ford,!" Sibal added.
Sibal estimates that there are
between 50 and 60 Filipino under
graduates at Stanford, although
there are more than a million Fil
ipinos in the United States, half of
which live in California.
And other students, including
Nguyen, agree that statistics on
the Asian-American population as
a whole hide the under-represen
tation of certain Asian sub
groups. Nguyen said she believes
that Filipinos, Native Hawaiians
and Vietnamese-Americans are
under-represented at Stanford
and should be targeted by the
Admissions Office.
However, because no concrete
data exists that track students
from specific backgrounds,
Nguyen and others from under
represented backgrounds must
rely on guesswork to estimate
their numbers.
"My rough guess is that there
are 70 or 80 Vietnamese total,
including grad students," said
Nguyen, who is president of the
Stanford Vietnamese Association.
"In Orange County alone, there
are some 200,000 Vietnamese."
Evangelista agreed that the

inability to detect underrepresenta
tion of ethnic groups such as Fil
ipinos and Vietnamese was "one of
the shortcomings of not having a
specific way of looking at subgroups.
"So I think what Dean Mon
toya wants to do is to look at the
overall policy," she said. "And I
think there are going to be some
changes."
Playing the 'name game'
The "first step" to a policy
change would be to "open up the
numbers" of the various Asian
ethnicities on campus, Yuen said,
adding that the adjustment in
tabulating the subgroups "proba
bly wouldn't cost anything.
"It's really a policy issue, not a
technical issue. It depends on

whether our University feels it's
important to know the ethnic
breakdown of the Asian popula
tion," he said.
For now, however, estimates
can only be made by flipping
through directories and playing
the "name-game."
"The only reason I have a
rough estimate of the number of
Vietnamese students on campus is
that I've gone though lists in the
directory and counted the Viet
namese last names," Nguyen said.
"It's really tough to know,
because Admissions never distin
guishes between Filipinos and
other Asians," said Sibal. "The
way we do it is we look at all the
Hispanic names in the froshbook,
and if the person looks Asian, we'd

guess they'd probably be Filipino."
"Just scanning the surnames, I
would say the largest subgroups
are Chinese, Korean, Japanese
and East Indian," Yuen said.
Diversity tied to immigration
Prior to 1965, the Asian popu
lation in the United States was
mainly Japanese or Chinese,
according to Yuen.
"But with the immigration
reform act of 1965, the numbers
of other ethnicities just started
skyrocketing, ... (bringing) larg
er populations from Hong Kong,
the Philippines, Korea," Yuen
said.
"In 1970, at the end of the
Vietnam war, large numbers of

Vietnamese and Cambodians
(began) arriving. The Asian popu
lation in the United States dou
bled from 1970 to 1980, and dou
bled again from 1980 to 1990. No
other population has seen that
kind of growth," he said.
The 1990 census report reflect
ed the the shifting demographics
within the Asian population,
using for the first time a "nine
category system" to tabulate
numbers of Chinese, Japanese,
Koreans, East Indians, Viet
namese, Filipinos, Cambodians,
Thais and Pacific Islanders.
Yuen said he hoped the census
office's decision to subcategorize
would prompt the Admissions
Office to "further discuss the stu
dent population."
