# Students balancing unity with individuality
## 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Asian Americans at Stanford
are attempting to strike a bal
ance between maintaining a spe
cific cultural identity and inte
grating into the larger group,
according to community leaders.
Because community stereo
types and admissions policies
lump all Asian Americans —
including Filipinos, Native
Hawaiians and East Indians —
into one categoiy, many sub
groups find themselves over
shadowed as they seek to estab
lish their identities.
"People tend to assume that
an Asian is either Chinese or
Japanese," so the opportunity to
draw a distinction between dif
ferent cultures does not even
arise, said Diana Akiyama, asso
ciate dean of Memorial Church.
According to freshman Joe
Huynh, who is Vietnamese-
American, "Before college, it was
hard for me to find my identity
because many people didn't even
realize that Vietnamese was an
Asian nationality. They always
asked if I was Chinese or
Japanese, or maybe Korean."
Huynh said he feels more
"recognized" at Stanford, where
he has met other Vietnamese-
American students. "There is a
greater awareness within the
Asian community here."

But sophomore Ernie Sibal,
who is Filipino-American, was
more critical of the environ
ment fostered by Stanford poli
cy, saying the University "has
made no attempt to separate
sub-groups within the Asian
community."
"Its policy is, 'If they're Asians,
they're Asians,' " he added.
Achieving a balance between
the recognition of separate
national identities and the main
tenance of unity in the Asian
population presents a constant
challenge, according to members
of the Asian community.
Events such as the Asian-
American Students Association
Culture Night, held on a period
ic basis, emphasize bringing
together aspects of each culture
— as well as members of differ
ent Asian subgroups.
Rick Yuen, assistant dean of
student affairs, said that besides
AASA, which is a general organi
zation for all Asian-Americans,
there are about 45 Asian student
organizations here that are
"fairly reflective of the Asian
community at Stanford."
Yuen said these organizations
have been trying to bring aware
ness of less-recognized Asian
cultures into the general student
population by making them
selves more prominent in the
Stanford community.
Sibal said the Pilipino-Ameri

can Student Union recently had a
cultural dance performance in
White Plaza. The organization
spells 'Pilipino' with a 4 P' for
"cultural reasons," according to
Sibal.
Interest in the Sanskrit Club
has also increased this year,
Yuen said. More students have
expressed a desire to learn about
the language, which is a classical
dialect of India.
Some students said the orga
nizations can easily miss their
mark by targeting constituen
cies that are either too narrow or
too broad.
Huynh said he is sometimes
"kind of apathetic" toward the
Asian community at Stanford
because the individual Asian-
American student organizations
tend to "become exclusionary.
"I'm not criticizing the
groups, because they make it
very clear that anyone is wel
come," he said. "But I don't
think many people are comfort
able going to functions of organi
zations that don't represent
their nationality."
Yuen, who is also the director
of the Asian-American Activities
Center, said the desire to explore
one's own culture is common, and
he believes many Asian-American
students at Stanford are "search
ing for identity so they can cele
brate their distinct cultures.
"The cultures are different.

The histories of the countries
are different," Yuen said. "Once
they came to the U.S., they
retained their distinct qualities.
But there is an Asian-American
experience because of the way
we're viewed here.
"For example, at Stanford, we
are all identified as Asian-Amer
icans on paper, and when seen
walking on campus," he said.
Even the term "Asian-Ameri
can" is "very American," Akiya
ma said, adding that "Recent
immigrants don't understand
why we run around calling our
selves 'Asian-Americans' when
they see the different nationali
ties."
She said many immigrants
who do not understand why
Asian-Americans choose to
"lump" themselves in a larger
category realize the importance
of a larger coalition when they
"first experience discrimination,
American-style."
These immigrants eventually
"see the need for a political iden
tity — which is 'Asian-Ameri
can,' " she said.
Huynh said while he recog
nizes the need for distinguishing
separate cultures, he also
believes students should not for
get the Asian community as a
whole.
"You can't really win either
way," he said. "You have to do
something that is in between."

Huynh said he is sometimes
"kind of apathetic" toward the
Asian community at Stanford
because the individual Asian-
American student organizations
tend to "become exclusionary.
"I'm not criticizing the
groups, because they make it
very clear that anyone is wel
come," he said. "But I don't
think many people are comfort
able going to functions of organi
zations that don't represent
their nationality."
Yuen, who is also the director
of the Asian-American Activities
Center, said the desire to explore
one's own culture is common, and
he believes many Asian-American
students at Stanford are "search
ing for identity so they can cele
brate their distinct cultures.
"The cultures are different.

The histories of the countries
are different," Yuen said. "Once
they came to the U.S., they
retained their distinct qualities.
But there is an Asian-American
experience because of the way
we're viewed here.
"For example, at Stanford, we
are all identified as Asian-Amer
icans on paper, and when seen
walking on campus," he said.
Even the term "Asian-Ameri
can" is "very American," Akiya
ma said, adding that "Recent
immigrants don't understand
why we run around calling our
selves 'Asian-Americans' when
they see the different nationali
ties."
She said many immigrants
who do not understand why
Asian-Americans choose to
"lump" themselves in a larger
category realize the importance
of a larger coalition when they
"first experience discrimination,
American-style."
These immigrants eventually
"see the need for a political iden
tity — which is 'Asian-Ameri
can,' " she said.
Huynh said while he recog
nizes the need for distinguishing
separate cultures, he also
believes students should not for
get the Asian community as a
whole.
"You can't really win either
way," he said. "You have to do
something that is in between."
Asian Americans at Stanford
are attempting to strike a bal
ance between maintaining a spe
cific cultural identity and inte
grating into the larger group,
according to community leaders.
Because community stereo
types and admissions policies
lump all Asian Americans —
including Filipinos, Native
Hawaiians and East Indians —
into one categoiy, many sub
groups find themselves over
shadowed as they seek to estab
lish their identities.
"People tend to assume that
an Asian is either Chinese or
Japanese," so the opportunity to
draw a distinction between dif
ferent cultures does not even
arise, said Diana Akiyama, asso
ciate dean of Memorial Church.
According to freshman Joe
Huynh, who is Vietnamese-
American, "Before college, it was
hard for me to find my identity
because many people didn't even
realize that Vietnamese was an
Asian nationality. They always
asked if I was Chinese or
Japanese, or maybe Korean."
Huynh said he feels more
"recognized" at Stanford, where
he has met other Vietnamese-
American students. "There is a
greater awareness within the
Asian community here."

But sophomore Ernie Sibal,
who is Filipino-American, was
more critical of the environ
ment fostered by Stanford poli
cy, saying the University "has
made no attempt to separate
sub-groups within the Asian
community."
"Its policy is, 'If they're Asians,
they're Asians,' " he added.
Achieving a balance between
the recognition of separate
national identities and the main
tenance of unity in the Asian
population presents a constant
challenge, according to members
of the Asian community.
Events such as the Asian-
American Students Association
Culture Night, held on a period
ic basis, emphasize bringing
together aspects of each culture
— as well as members of differ
ent Asian subgroups.
Rick Yuen, assistant dean of
student affairs, said that besides
AASA, which is a general organi
zation for all Asian-Americans,
there are about 45 Asian student
organizations here that are
"fairly reflective of the Asian
community at Stanford."
Yuen said these organizations
have been trying to bring aware
ness of less-recognized Asian
cultures into the general student
population by making them
selves more prominent in the
Stanford community.
Sibal said the Pilipino-Ameri

can Student Union recently had a
cultural dance performance in
White Plaza. The organization
spells 'Pilipino' with a 4 P' for
"cultural reasons," according to
Sibal.
Interest in the Sanskrit Club
has also increased this year,
Yuen said. More students have
expressed a desire to learn about
the language, which is a classical
dialect of India.
Some students said the orga
nizations can easily miss their
mark by targeting constituen
cies that are either too narrow or
too broad.
