Graduation speaker to be announced soon
University officials will announce the identity of the gradua
tion speaker for the 1992 commencement exercises within the
next few days, according to members of the selection committee.
A speaker has been selected but the committee is awaiting a reply,
according to Jennifer Steele, one of the senior class presidents.
"The person we've contacted is very well known within their
field," said Verna Kuo, another senior class president. But she
added that students may not be familiar with the speaker.
According to Kuo, the search committee sought people who are
active in education and public service.
"We wanted someone who really has contributed to society in
their life's work," she said.

Math prof, gets month's reprieve
Mathematics Prof. James Milgram's sentencing, originally
scheduled for yesterday, has been continued until late March.
Mil gram was found guilty on Jan. 8 of a misdemeanor assault
and battery charge.
His dog, Pooky, bit a passing boy on the ankle and caused
three puncture wounds. Milgram then refused to give his name to
an adult who was with the boy, according to Santa Clara County
Assistant District Attorney Catherine Pozos. She said Milgram
then proceeded to use his dog leash to attack the man.
Milgram was also found guilty of violating a leash law and
using words that could provoke a fight.
