# Court battle over inheritance begins today

Attorneys for Stanford and a Los
Angeles museum will ask the Los
Angeles Superior Court this morn
ing for a 90-day delay before the
court decides the fate of a $97 mil
lion trust conditionally bequeathed
to the Christian Science Church.
The University has argued
that because the Boston-based
church may not have fulfilled the
conditions of the trust by publish
ing a controversial biography of
founder Mary Baker Eddy, the
first $22 million should be divided
between the museum and the
University as the trust requires.
"So far, the information that
has been coming in is somewhat
confusing," said Chip Rawlings,
one of two attorneys representing
Museum Associates, a non-profit
group which supports the Los
Angeles County museum. The
museum and University need the
delay to research the will's origi
nal intent, he said.
Senior University Counsel
Carol Swenson said she does not
expect this morning's hearing to

decide the case.
The trust mandates that if the
church does not publish the book
as "authorized literature" and
prominently display it in "sub
stantially all" Christian Science
reading rooms by May 1993, the
first installment — some $22 mil
lion — must be split between
Stanford and Museum Associates.
The church would then have at
least 21 years to prove that it has
met those requirements before it
could receive the remaining $75
million, according to the trust.
In a petition filed in December
1991, the estate's trustees
claimed the church had met the
requirements of the trust and
asked the court to grant the
church the first $22 million.
In response to that petition,
the University and Museum Asso
ciates asked for a delay so that the
church's claim could be verified.
At the center of the case is the
1947 book, The Destiny of the
Mother Church, a biography of
Eddy written by now-deceased
Bliss Knapp.
The church originally refused
to publish the book, saying the

book deifies Eddy — an act many
Christian Scientists consider sac
rilegious.
Although Knapp eventually
published the book on his own, he
was unable to distribute the book
in Christian Science reading
rooms because they are allowed to
carry only matericds published by
the Christian Science Publishing
Society.
His wife and sister-in-law then
established the trust to encourage
the church to publish Knapp's book.
Knapp's wife, Eloise, entered Stan
ford in 1891 as part of the Universi
ty's first class.
Although the church published
the book in August — along with
several other biographies of Eddy
— both Stanford and Museum
Associates have argued that the
church has not met the require
ments of the will.
"We know it has been pub
lished, but it does not look like it
has been published in the way the
trustors wanted it to be done,"
Rawlings said.
According to Rawlings, the
book does not carry the tradition
al "authorized literature" label

found on other church publica
tions. Also, he said, there are ques
tions regarding whether the
church has lived up to the require
ment that it sell and prominently
display the book in "substantially
all" church reading rooms.
"The issue is whether the
church is really complying with
this agreement," Rawlings said.
Nathan Talbot, a church spokes
man, said the church has met all the
requirements of the trust. "Every
thing I have seen causes me to
believe the church has met all the
conditions of the will," he said.
While continuing litigation in
the conflict, both sides have
insisted that the $97 million is not
motivating their actions.
"We have obligations to make
sure the conditions [of the will] have
been met," said Swenson, who is
representing Stanford in the case.
Talbot denied that the book's
tardy publication was prompted
by the 1993 deadline. "The money
was not the issue," Talbot said.
Rather, he said, the book was
finally released as part of a planned
series designed to present a broad
spectrum of views on Eddy.
