Stanford University Guidelines Regarding
HIV Infection and Student Life
February 1992
In response to the reality of HIV infection on college campuses, the HIV Infection Educational Task Force has prepared the following
restatement of the Stanford University Guidelines on HIV Infection and Student Life. The restatement is consistent with current medical
evidence indicating that HIV is not spread by casual contact, and with other current policies and practices of the University in the area of
student affairs.
Stanford University's Statement of Nondiscriminatory Policy reads in part:
(The University) does not discriminate against students on the basis of sex, race, color, handicap, religion, sexual
orientation, or national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational policies, admissions policies,
scholarships and loan programs, and athletic and other University-administered programs.
In administering the nondiscrimination policy, representatives of the University have approached issues concerning individual students on a
case-by-case basis, seeking to make decisions with respect, compassion and sensitivity.
As do other students with special needs—including those with other chronic illnesses—students with HIV infection will receive individual
treatment designed to maximize their education experience and enhance the quality of their lives at Stanford. Decisions about specific
situations will be made after considering factors such as (a) the student's ability to function due to the exigencies of his or her medical
condition, (b) the requirements of confidentiality and privacy, (c) the public health needs of the community, and (d) the limitations and
obligations of the law.
The procedures and guidelines set forth below are intended to protect the rights of all students; assist those students with HIV infection by
providing administrative, physical and psychological support; and encourage education programs designed to reduce risky behavior, create
an informed and supportive community and prevent the spread of HIV infection.
1 • Admissions
Consistent with the University's Statement of Nondiscriminatory
Policy, information about an applicant's HIV infection will not
adversely influence the admission decision.
2. Access to Facilities, Events, and Activities
In general, students with HIV infection will be allowed as much
access as any other student to housing, classrooms, libraries, dining
areas, swimming pools and recreational facilities, and all other
University facilities. In general, students with HIV infection will
also have the right to participate in all classes and social, cultural
and education events and activities.
The University will make reasonable accommodations for students
with HIV infection because of their needs. Access to specific
facilities and activities will not be limited except itt those rare
situations where the student's medical condition or the public
health interests of the community may take precedence. Such
decisions will be made only after careful consideration of the
particular facts and consultation with the student.
3. Athletics
Whether there should be limitation on the participation of a
student with HIV infection in athletic activities sponsored by the
University should be decided on a case-by-case basis, in
consultation with the student and his or her physician.
4. Education and Prevention Programs
Education is a critical means of preventing the spread of HIV
infection and supporting students with HIV infection. The
University should provide institutional support for a variety of
effective education programs aimed at changing individual
behavior and impacting campus-wide attitudes. Aimed at the entire
Stanford community, these programs should:
Provide accurate information regarding HIV infection in
order to develop and maintain a well-informed Stanford
community.
Reduce fears and misconception about HIV infection and
about people with HIV infection
Identify the type of behavior which is especially risky for the
transmission of HIV infection.
Encourage individuals who have participated in high-risk
activity of modify their behavior and seek information and
testing
Foster sensitivity, concern and support for individuals with
HIV infection and for those whom HIV infection has affected
in other ways.
5. HIV Antibody Testing
Cowell Student Health center is planning to provide both
anonymous HIV antibody testing, with peer counselors doing the
pre and post test counseling, and confidential testing, in which only
the physician will know the student's identity; no identifying
records of the blood test or the results will be kept in either case.
6. Treatment, Services and Referrals
Cowell will provide assistance in obtaining (either on-campus or
through appropriate referrals) medical, laboratory, psychological,
financial, and social services for students who are concerned about
or affected by HIV infection.
1 7. Confidentiality
In accordance with California law and University policy, student
medical records are confidential. Except in accordance with law, the
University will not release information concerning the medical
records, HIV antibody testing, or HIV status of a student to any
person or group—including parents and relatives of the student,
agencies, insurers, employers, prospective employers or institutions
without the express written permission of the student.
8. Harassment
Fear, ignorance and anger may lead some people to victimize those
with HIV infection. Stanford educational and counseling programs
are prepared to address these inappropriate and destructive
responses and seek to redirect this energy into more, positive
actions. Failure to show respect for the right of others-is prohibited
by University policy. Violations will be prosecuted through the
appropriate disciplinary procedures.
9. Immunization/Contagious Disease
On a case-by-case basis, a student with HIV infection may be
excused from University requirements for certain live vaccinations
if, due to the compromised status of the student's immune system,
the risks of the vaccine outweigh the benefits. Special provisions to
protect the health of students with HIV infection will be considered
during outbreaks of contagious diseases.
10* Safety Precautions
The University has adopted guidelines proposed by the U.S. Public
Health Service for the handling of blood, blood products and other
body fluids. All students participating in clinical work and who
may be exposed though laboratory work will receive training on
procedures for minimizing occupational risk from contact with such
products.
11 .Continuing Responsibility of the HIV Infection
Educational Task Force
The HIV Infection Educational Task Force (originally named as the
AIDS Task Force) was charged by the Dean of Student Affairs in
1987. It is now responsible to the Vice President for Student
Resources. Comprised of students, staff and faculty, the Task Force
has met regularly to address several campus-wide issues related to
HIV infection. The goals of the Task Force have been:
To monitor current medical, legislative and judicial
developments and other forms of rapidly changing knowledge
about HIV infection.
To review and evaluate institutional guidelines and programs
in light of current knowledge, including guidelines from the
American College Health Association and American Public
Health Association.
To recommend new policy and, where needed, revisions to
existing policy concerning specific issues related to HIV
infection.
To coordinate and evaluate, in active relationship with
Cowell Student Health Center, a comprehensive educational
campaign directed toward prevention education, testing,
early intervention, counseling and support services.
To provide advice, on request, (e.g., from the Chronic Illness
Working Group), concerning HIV issues when these cut
across normal departmental lines.

Stanford University Guidelines Regarding
HIV Infection and Student Life
February 1992
In response to the reality of HIV infection on college campuses, the HIV Infection Educational Task Force has prepared the following
restatement of the Stanford University Guidelines on HIV Infection and Student Life. The restatement is consistent with current medical
evidence indicating that HIV is not spread by casual contact, and with other current policies and practices of the University in the area of
student affairs.
Stanford University's Statement of Nondiscriminatory Policy reads in part:
(The University) does not discriminate against students on the basis of sex, race, color, handicap, religion, sexual
orientation, or national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational policies, admissions policies,
scholarships and loan programs, and athletic and other University-administered programs.
In administering the nondiscrimination policy, representatives of the University have approached issues concerning individual students on a
case-by-case basis, seeking to make decisions with respect, compassion and sensitivity.
As do other students with special needs—including those with other chronic illnesses—students with HIV infection will receive individual
treatment designed to maximize their education experience and enhance the quality of their lives at Stanford. Decisions about specific
situations will be made after considering factors such as (a) the student's ability to function due to the exigencies of his or her medical
condition, (b) the requirements of confidentiality and privacy, (c) the public health needs of the community, and (d) the limitations and
obligations of the law.
The procedures and guidelines set forth below are intended to protect the rights of all students; assist those students with HIV infection by
providing administrative, physical and psychological support; and encourage education programs designed to reduce risky behavior, create
an informed and supportive community and prevent the spread of HIV infection.
1 • Admissions
Consistent with the University's Statement of Nondiscriminatory
Policy, information about an applicant's HIV infection will not
adversely influence the admission decision.
2. Access to Facilities, Events, and Activities
In general, students with HIV infection will be allowed as much
access as any other student to housing, classrooms, libraries, dining
areas, swimming pools and recreational facilities, and all other
University facilities. In general, students with HIV infection will
also have the right to participate in all classes and social, cultural
and education events and activities.
The University will make reasonable accommodations for students
with HIV infection because of their needs. Access to specific
facilities and activities will not be limited except itt those rare
situations where the student's medical condition or the public
health interests of the community may take precedence. Such
decisions will be made only after careful consideration of the
particular facts and consultation with the student.
3. Athletics
Whether there should be limitation on the participation of a
student with HIV infection in athletic activities sponsored by the
University should be decided on a case-by-case basis, in
consultation with the student and his or her physician.
4. Education and Prevention Programs
Education is a critical means of preventing the spread of HIV
infection and supporting students with HIV infection. The
University should provide institutional support for a variety of
effective education programs aimed at changing individual
behavior and impacting campus-wide attitudes. Aimed at the entire
Stanford community, these programs should:
Provide accurate information regarding HIV infection in
order to develop and maintain a well-informed Stanford
community.
Reduce fears and misconception about HIV infection and
about people with HIV infection
Identify the type of behavior which is especially risky for the
transmission of HIV infection.
Encourage individuals who have participated in high-risk
activity of modify their behavior and seek information and
testing
Foster sensitivity, concern and support for individuals with
HIV infection and for those whom HIV infection has affected
in other ways.
5. HIV Antibody Testing
Cowell Student Health center is planning to provide both
anonymous HIV antibody testing, with peer counselors doing the
pre and post test counseling, and confidential testing, in which only
the physician will know the student's identity; no identifying
records of the blood test or the results will be kept in either case.
6. Treatment, Services and Referrals
Cowell will provide assistance in obtaining (either on-campus or
through appropriate referrals) medical, laboratory, psychological,
financial, and social services for students who are concerned about
or affected by HIV infection.
1 7. Confidentiality
In accordance with California law and University policy, student
medical records are confidential. Except in accordance with law, the
University will not release information concerning the medical
records, HIV antibody testing, or HIV status of a student to any
person or group—including parents and relatives of the student,
agencies, insurers, employers, prospective employers or institutions
without the express written permission of the student.
8. Harassment
Fear, ignorance and anger may lead some people to victimize those
with HIV infection. Stanford educational and counseling programs
are prepared to address these inappropriate and destructive
responses and seek to redirect this energy into more, positive
actions. Failure to show respect for the right of others-is prohibited
by University policy. Violations will be prosecuted through the
appropriate disciplinary procedures.
9. Immunization/Contagious Disease
On a case-by-case basis, a student with HIV infection may be
excused from University requirements for certain live vaccinations
if, due to the compromised status of the student's immune system,
the risks of the vaccine outweigh the benefits. Special provisions to
protect the health of students with HIV infection will be considered
during outbreaks of contagious diseases.
10* Safety Precautions
The University has adopted guidelines proposed by the U.S. Public
Health Service for the handling of blood, blood products and other
body fluids. All students participating in clinical work and who
may be exposed though laboratory work will receive training on
procedures for minimizing occupational risk from contact with such
products.
11 .Continuing Responsibility of the HIV Infection
Educational Task Force
The HIV Infection Educational Task Force (originally named as the
AIDS Task Force) was charged by the Dean of Student Affairs in
1987. It is now responsible to the Vice President for Student
Resources. Comprised of students, staff and faculty, the Task Force
has met regularly to address several campus-wide issues related to
HIV infection. The goals of the Task Force have been:
To monitor current medical, legislative and judicial
developments and other forms of rapidly changing knowledge
about HIV infection.
To review and evaluate institutional guidelines and programs
in light of current knowledge, including guidelines from the
American College Health Association and American Public
Health Association.
To recommend new policy and, where needed, revisions to
existing policy concerning specific issues related to HIV
infection.
To coordinate and evaluate, in active relationship with
Cowell Student Health Center, a comprehensive educational
campaign directed toward prevention education, testing,
early intervention, counseling and support services.
To provide advice, on request, (e.g., from the Chronic Illness
Working Group), concerning HIV issues when these cut
across normal departmental lines.
