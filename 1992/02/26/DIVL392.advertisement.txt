WE'RE CLOSING
OUR DOORS!
(Not forever, we're just remodeling.)
Wednesday, Feb. 26th through Mar. Bth
We're clearing out inventory, cleaning out the back stock, and making room
for the work crew. Our doors will open again in a few weeks with
a bigger store, a fresh coat of paint, and new carpet.
So hurry down and pick up some once-in-a-lifetime deals
at The North Face Factory Outlet.
