Dear Kristen,
What can I say except
we are docking in Capt
Town tomorrow and
that 10 days of infor
mation straight from
Archbishop Tutu un
der my cap has
humbled me. Now I
can see Apartheid for
myself with new eyes.
Sony, but I have to run
for the final game in
the volleyball tourna
ment on Prom Deck.
Love,
Brian
