WHY YOU SHOULD STMT PLANNING FOR
RETIREMENT WITH TOUR EYES CLOSED.
For retirement to be the time ofyour life, you
have to dream a little—about the things
you've always wanted to do: travel, explore,
start a business. Just imagine...
With a dream and a plan, you can make it
happen. Your pension and Social Security
should provide a good
basic retirement income,
but what about all those
extras that make your
dreams possible? You'll
probably need some
additional savings.
THE DREAM IS YOUR OWN.
WE CAN HELP YOU WITH THE PLAN.
TIAA-CREF Supplemental Retirement
Annuities (SRAs), tax-deferred annuities for
people like you in education and research, are
a good way to save for retirement and save
on taxes now. SRAs are easy—you make con-
tributions through your institution before your I
taxes are calculated, so you pay less tax now.
You pay no tax on
your SRA contributions
and earnings until you
receive them as income.
And saving regularly
means your contribu
tions and their earnings
Ensuring the future
for those who shape it."
can add up quickly.
What else makes SRAs
so special? A broad range
of allocation choices, from
the safety of TIAA to the
investment accounts of
CREF's variable annuity;
no sales charges; a variety of ways to receive
income, including annuities, payments over a
fixed period, or cash. You may also be able to
borrow against your SRA accumulation
before you retire*
All this, plus the top investment manage
ment that has helped make TIAA-CREF the
largest retirement system in the country.
So start dreaming and planning for the time
of your life. Because the sooner you start your
SRA, the greater your savings and your retire
ment will be.
