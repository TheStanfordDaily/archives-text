# Panel proposes new HIV services
## 
### Holly Hacker Senior staff writer 
Guidelines reaffirming Stan
ford's commitment to supporting
HIV-infected students and pro
grams dealing with the disease
were made public by a University
task force today.
In the document, the HIV
Infection Educational Task Force
—comprised of 20 students, staff
and faculty — detail the Universi
ty's response to HIV infection
and infected students.
The guidelines propose two
new programs: a peer counseling
service and anonymous HIV test
ing. Cowell Student Health Center
currently offers confidential HIV
testing using student ID numbers.
The task force has also formed a
"chronic illness working group"
designed to handle the needs of
HIV-positive students, according
to task force co-chair Virginia Gon
zalez, a Stanford health educator.
Gonzalez said the revised policy
focuses on "how to assist (HlV
infected) individuals with specific
needs," such as continued access to
health care and insurance as well
as protection against discrimina
tion in the dormitory or classroom.
The guidelines, which took a
year and a half to formulate, also
describe Stanford's attempts to
educate students on HIV infec
tion and prevention.
In comparison to the policy
released in November 1988, the
new document focuses on HIV
infection instead of AIDS and
pays more attention to protecting
the rights of infected students.
But Robert Siegel, a task force
member and lecturer in the Bio
chemistry Department, said, "It's
not so much that the [revised
guidelines] represent major
changes from 1988. The important
thing is the message is being
renewed in terms of commitment."
While the 1988 guidelines
focused on the effects of AIDS on
student life, this year's guidelines
address HIV infection.
AIDS is a clinical diagnosis
marking the later stages of infec
tion with HIV, the human
immunodeficiency virus. HlV
infected individuals can live for
more than 10 years before devel
oping AIDS.
Alejandro Martinez, director of
student health services and a task
force member, said that while the
medical community has focused
on AIDS in the past,
"It's now seen as a disease that
needs to be treated from the
moment of infection."
He also noted that emphasiz
ing HIV is important because
most young people with HIV have
not yet developed AIDS.
Martinez said the guidelines

It's now seen as a
disease that needs
to be treated from
the moment of
infection.'

are meant to give HIV-infected
individuals protection and sup
port so students will be encour
aged to get tested and "get medi
cal treatment as early as they
need it."
In 1987, former Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons charged
the AIDS Task Force — the for
mer name of the group — with
creating the original 1988 guide
lines on AIDS and student life.
Three years later, former
health promotion program direc
tor and task force chair Pat Fabi
ano urged the task force to reex
amine the guidelines, according to
current co-chair John Dorman.
In addition, Siegel said several
members expressed interest in
revising the policy, particularly at
the insistence of an HIV-infected
student on the task force.
