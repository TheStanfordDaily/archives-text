Bush pledges $77M for flood relief
LOS ANGELES (AP) — President Bush said yesterday the fed
eral government would provide $77.5 million in disaster relief to
five counties ravaged by storms and flooding, but local officials
said it probably wouldn't be enough.
The money will go to Los Angeles, Kern, Ventura, San
Bernardino and Orange counties, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said as Bush arrived in California for campaign stops.
In his request for a federal disaster declaration, Gov. Pete Wil
son said the damage was estimated at about $125 million.
"I don't know whether this will be enough for all of the coun
ties," said John Flynn, chairman of the Ventura County Board of
Supervisors.
The five counties were pummeled by a series of storms that
began Feb. 9, causing mudslides and flooding. Nine people were
killed and four remain missing, including two skiers believed to
have been buried by an avalanche.
Two arrested for Tetris virus
ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) — Two Cornell University students have
been arrested on charges they unleashed a computer virus that
paralyzed computers at Stanford and in Japan.
David Blumenthal and Mark Pilgrim, both 19-year-old sopho
mores, were arraigned Monday in Ithaca City Court, each on one
count of second-degree computer tampering, a misdemeanor.
Additional charges are pending, said Cornell spokeswoman
Linda G. Kobas. Both students were being held in Tompkins
County Jail on $10,000 bail, she said.
The virus, known as the MBDFA virus, was launched Feb. 14
in three Macintosh computer games: Obnoxious Tetris, Tetriscy
cle and Ten Tile Puzzle, Kobas said. The virus paralyzed the com
puters of people who used Cornell's public computer archive to
play the games, she said.
It also affected Macintosh computers at Stanford, in Osaka,
Japan and computers at other undisclosed locations. The virus
was traced to Cornell on Thursday, she said.
A computer virus is a computer program that secretly attach
es itself to other programs in a person's computer, can reproduce
itself and can produce harmful side effects unexpected by the
user.
