## Defeat brain drain 
### 
With no bombs to build
back at home, Russian
scientists seek new jobs

Thousands of unempiyed
Russian nuclear physicists
who have no more bombs to
build at home may be lured into
sharing their expertise with nations
previously excluded from the nucle
ar club and now ready to pay.
The US. should act to keep
those scientists in Russia. And pri
vate universities like Stanford can
complement government economic
incentives by organizing research
collaborations.
Cold War secrecy had kept most
nuclear technologies from being sold
to the Third World, but now the
once-sequestered Soviet scientific
elite is putting itself on the market
— or, more precisely, looking for one.
Bush's $25 million offer,
announced last week, for a clearing
house is on the right track. As well
as matching Russian scientists with
Western firms and universities, it
ensures that U.S. interests are rep
resented in future Russian research.
But the Russian researchers
who met with Secretary of State
James A. Baker last week had a
proposal of their own: manufac
turing industrial diamonds or
medical equipment.
While those would be good
exportable options for the former
Soviet Union, nuclear physicists
with a lot of time on their hands
might be better utilized in environ
mental cleanup and bomb disposal.
U.S. funding will keep countries
like Libya and North Korea out of
the atomic cookie jar. Future efforts
will, hopefully, focus on disman
tling, not disseminating, weapons
and funds can go toward scaling
down the existing nuclear arsenals.
The American Association for the
Advancement of Science is consider
ing beginning a $200 million endow
ment to bolster funds from both
governments. Getting involved

would be a bargain for Western uni
versities, including Stanford.
Joint ventures with Western uni
versities beat brain drain in every
way — inexpensive researchers
stay in Russia while Americans
keep their jobs here. In the rosiest
scenario, such cooperation will
yield many discoveries only the
marriage of heretofore alienated
technologies could achieve.
However, the spirit of scientific
complicity may dodge the best
intentioned efforts of U.S. research
interests. Former bomb-builders do
not necessarily dump their Cold War
ideological baggage when they arrive
at the doorstep of private industry.
In our enthusiasm to welcome
these scientists into the scientific
challenges of the West, we must
remember that there are Russian
nationalists who have both a
knowledge of weapons and a desire
for a strong Russian state.
Building weapons cannot be an
impartial occupation, and political
ly influential nuclear scientists do
not necessarily possess great polit
ical acuity.
Just as Edward Teller dogmati
cally champions Star Wars from
the Hoover Institution, there are,
assuredly, Russian scientists still
in positions of authority similarly
driven by flashy technological
challenges and an outdated Cold
War mentality. Beating swords
into fiber optics is not necessarily
an apolitical operation.
And the Russian scientific com
munity's inherent problems hamper
an ideal collaboration with the West.
Accusations of anti-Semitism, sex
ism and influence-peddling persist.
These concerns may yet outweigh
the incentives that guaranteed gov
ernment loans and tax breaks can
offer would-be U.S. investors in the
new Commonwealth.
Values are hard to replace, and
dollars cannot buy new loyalties
for a scientific community reduced
to rubble. Ultimately post-Cold
War research should be loyal to the
scientific ideal, which lies neither
in dollars nor defense. It's time to
reinvest in plowshare technology.
