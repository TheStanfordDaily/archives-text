Recognize dangers in confusing seduction and coercion

THE RECENT FLURRY OF media
attention, both on the Stanford
campus and nationwide, about the
dangers of counting coerced sex as rape
deserves careful attention. The idea of
taking seriously charges of sexual
harassment and date rape has raised
fears about "men's rights."
The Thomas hearings, the trials of
William Kennedy Smith and Mike
Tyson, and debates on campus about
whether to include sexual coercion as
part of the definition of rape have all
brought these issues to the forefront.
My statement here will focus on two
issues: the coercion versus seduction
debate and the idea that men will be
increasingly threatened with false accu
sations of rape and sexual harassment.
Seduction and coercion are not the
same things. Sexual coercion is about cap
italizing on another's relative powerless
ness — socialized or physical powerless
ness — and pressuring them physically or

verbally to have sex against their will.
To recognize that coerced sex is rape
is to recognize that force does not have
to be brute to count as a violation. Accu
sations of slander and blackmail can be
brought before law — why not accusa
tions of coerced sex?
Seduction is about sexual play and
sexual pleasure. To count as seduction,
winning consent has to be part of a sexu
al game to which both parties agree.
Sexual play can involve erotic enact
ments of power relationships, but again,
both parties must agree to engage in this
play. Counting sexual coercion as rape is
not about policing anyone's consensual
sexual activity. It is about protecting the
rights of those who are sexually violated
against their will.
Efforts to keep sexual coercion under
the rubric of seduction protect sexual
violators.
What about the perceived threat that
men will be increasingly threatened with

false accusations of rape? Rape is the
crime with the least incidence of false
report. Those cases that are reported
rarely go to court and when they do, the
alleged rapist is almost never booked.
The logic of this concern about false
accusations assumes, first of all, that
there are hordes of women who just
can't wait for a chance to falsely accuse
a man of rape. It utterly trivializes the
enormous social problem that results
from focusing on the victim's credibility
and not on the credibility of the accusa
tion itself.
For example, a rape victim's sexual
history has often been used as evidence
of whether the accused is guilty. If a
rape victim has a licentious sexual past,
we are supposed to think that the
alleged rapist's actions were probably
innocent.
These issues apply to charges of sexual
harassment as well. The bulk of the evi
dence presented during the Thomas hear

ings rested almost entirely on Hill's credi
bility and Thomas' denial of her claim.
A thief is innocent until proven guilty
and our sympathy goes out to the
injured party. In general, we do not
worry about people falsely accusing oth
ers of theft in large numbers.
A rapist is also innocent until proven
guilty, but public sympathy does not go
out to those who allege rape. A fresh
concern about false accusations of rape
can only mean the further victimization
of those who come forward with a
charge of rape. It also means the contin
ued legal protection of rapists.
Fears about recognizing sexual coer
cion as a violation are a call for a "return
to the good old days" when rapists were
defined as strangers who jumped from
behind bushes to attack helpless women
who couldn't effectively press charges
anyway.
