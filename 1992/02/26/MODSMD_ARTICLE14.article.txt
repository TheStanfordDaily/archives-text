# Every discipline uses mass media concepts

So what do we do in the Communica
tion Department? Are we just rabid con
sumers who create pseudo-shows like
"Beverly Hills, 90210"? Well, yes.
But do we study the effects of televi
sion violence on society and specifically
the effects on children? Yes, we do.
Do we also conduct large-scale
research where we determine what pub
lic and social communication strategies
will be most efficacious for educating the
public about heart disease, AIDS and
teenage pregnancy? Why yes, we do.
I believe it was the founding fathers
of our country who recognized the social
responsibility theory of the press and of
the public to communicate in order to
preserve the democracy which we all

profess to uphold.
It seems to me that communication
and the many mediums we use in society
are omnipresent, so does it make sense
not to study them?
I am enervated by the persistent
malignities thrust upon the nature of
my The faculty in the Communi
cation department are some of the most
esteemed researchers in the field.
It still amazes me when people fail to
recognize that communication concepts
pervade almost every department on this
campus. Every discipline concerned with
society or human behavior must be con
cerned with communication.
It is a hybrid of many fields and for
some faculty members not to recognize
this, as an article in Monday's Daily
reported, is an oversight of astounding
proportions.
