# Diversity exists in all races and ethnicities

Yesterday's article concerning the
"hidden diversity" in the Asian-Ameri
can community could just as easily been
written about whites.
Picture a white student. You might
see someone who is German, Russian,
Italian, Polish, Iranian, Scandinavian,
Turkish, Greek, French, Jewish or
Yugoslavian.
But judging from the records at the
Registrar's Office, they are all the same.
The values, historical discrimination and
socioeconomic status of white students
varies greatly.
Rural southern farmers whose
ancestry can be traced back to the pre
revolutionary era have had a totally dif
ferent experience in this country than

an immigrant who arrived here last
year after escaping anti-Semitism in
Russia.
The University, specifically the
Offices of Residential Education and
Multicultural Development, and the stu
dents themselves, seldom acknowledge
and display these differences among
whites.
