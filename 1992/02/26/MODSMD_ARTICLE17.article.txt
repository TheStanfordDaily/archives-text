## Let's talk about sex-uality 
### 
TAGINA, CAROL HAS A vagi
\ / na," I said with a perky smile
V on my face, proud of the new
word I had learned. I was seven. My smile
vanished quickly, however, as the teacher
firmly grasped me by the arm.
With her nostrils flaring and her eyes
glaring, she scolded me: "We don't use
those words."
From that moment on, vagina was a
Power Word, surrounded by an indelible
mystique. What was it? What did it do?
Why did it make people react with such
emotion?
With the advent of health education,
TV and overheard conversations, vagina
soon joined penis, breast and a host of
other anatomical parts in the Power
Word category ; they were words of which
to be wary.
In most contexts their use meant
imminent danger, but with them I could
make my close friends laugh or cheerful
ly groan in disgust with a precise toss of
the tongue.
Now, at 22, I realize that The Power
persists. After years of training I thought
I had mastered it, but alas, it has leapt up
and bit my anterior anatomical area.
You see, I was scolded about my first
few columns. No, their nostrils did not
flare, but some people genuinely thought
I was too profane.
I think I am beginning to realize my
problem. I am trapped between two over

whelming social constructs: a pervasive
Puritan ethic and a pernicious brand of
promiscuity, each one feeding upon the
strength of the other.
Outside of medical journals and clan
destine conversations, issues of sex and
sexuality are almost exclusively relegated
to humor and renegade elements of the
media. Here lies the root of much evil.
The pulpit ministers of sexuality —
Andrew Dice Clay, Budweiser commer
cials, Hustler magazine, summer teen
movies — preach singular images of sex
uality. These images and subsequent
attitudes about sexuality are the main
stream and our society is littered with
their malignant effects.
For example, how many women and
men strive to obtain air-brushed Barbie
doll traits for themselves or their part
ners?
Meanwhile, the purveyors of Puri
tanism revel in disgust. How appalling!
How degrading! We must save the chil
dren! They seek to shut the door on expres
sions of, and dialogue about, sexuality.
Sexual issues remain in the home and
only venture out when couched in terms
of "don't do," "don't say" and often
"don't think." The deleterious conse
quences of these attitudes clutter our
communities; they are the same as those
promulgated by pernicious promiscuity.
Sexually transmitted diseases, rape,
eating disorders, teen pregnancy and a

host of other issues alone merit a new dia
logue about sexuality. We are starved for
rational sexual discourse. Silence is not
the answer, forthright discussions are.
I do not wish to condemn promiscuity,
the word alone implies judgement. I more
than realize that one person's pornogra
phy is another person's art or freedom of
expression (If you do not believe this, just
ask John Frohmayer).
We do not need to be saved from "dam
aging" messages; we need to be better
equipped to deal with them.
This does not mean imposing a set of
sexual morals; for no one should have the
right to construct a universal morality. It
does mean, however, allowing for diverse
sexual expression. Without diversity of
expression, we will be forced toward a
uniform values.
Exploitative magazines like Hustler
may never disappear, but if the human
body, in all its differing forms of beauty
and types of sexual expression, were hon
ored, I know I would be able to talk more
openly and honestly about sex and could
ignore those who choose to exploit it.

Cory bemoans the fact that he did not make
it into The Review like Jane and Omar.
