# Threatened by cuts, programs seek new funds

### Alain Dalva Staff writer 
Surplus funds from the Stanford Directory or an
ASSU special fee may fund the sexual assault
resource center next year, while the Feminist Stud
ies Program board has offered to sponsor the Issues
in Self-Defense for Women SWOPSI class.
The options respond to demands made by Stan
ford Workshops on Political and Social Issues class
supporters who stormed the President's office and a
Board of Trustees meeting two weeks ago.
Budget cuts may force the ASSU to end its year
long support for the Sexual Assault Information and
Resources Center and its coordinator, and the elim
ination of Innovative Academic Courses has endan
gered the future of the class.
Council of Presidents member John Overdeck
said he is working with Dean of Students Michael
Jackson to find new funding for the center and the
coordinator position.
Overdeck said the administration may allow the
ASSU to run the non-profit Stanford Directory and
use the surplus funds to pay for the center and the
coordinator position.
The phone directory's surplus is usually about
$40,000, according to senior Ryan Drant, business
manager of the 1991-92 Directory. He said past sur
pluses have funded the Office of Students Activities
at Tresidder and various students groups, such as
SURE escort service.
Jackson said he did not wish to comment on any
thing concerning the funding for the center, the coor
dinator or the class until after a meeting that will be
held today.
The Coalition Against Sexual Assault is also try
ing to get money for the center and its coordinator
by requesting a special fee in April's ASSU election,
according to current coordinator Susan Epstein.
Epstein said she will not remain in the position
next year because she plans to go to law school.
Anthropology Prof. Jane Collier, chair of the
Feminist Studies Program, said
the program's board members
have offered "to take over the
sponsorship of the (self-defense
for women) class."
But the program does not have
the money to fund the class, Col
lier said, adding that funds may
eventually have to come from the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences.
Collier said a board member,
whose name she did not wish to

reveal, is investigating the origin
of the budget that has funded the
class until this year.
According to Epstein, the class
was funded through SWOPSI,
which has fallen under the ax of
the budget-cutting process. Two
years ago, then-Dean of Under
graduate Studies Thomas Wasow
set aside a special fund for the
class, she said.
Senior Assoc. Dean of Human
ities and Sciences Carolyn Lougee
said three weeks ago that she
used to guarantee a budget line
for the class from 1982 to 1987,
when she was dean of undergrad
uate studies.
