## Olympic hopeful, record-holder Rouse 'an ordinary Joe' 
### Tish Williams Staff writer 
Jeff Rouse is the boy next door.
He's the kid you splashed around
with in the community pool every
summer. He's the kind of guy who
would call your dad "sir" and your
mom "ma'am."
He's also the world record hold
er in the 100-meter backstroke.
"I'd prefer to be thought of as
one of the guys ... an average
Joe," said Rouse, a senior majoring
in economics.
Rouse's accomplishments, how
ever, are anything but average. He
is a three-time NCAA champion in
the 100-yard backstroke, a two
time Pacific 10 100-yard back
champion, and the 1989 NCAA
200-yard backstroke champion, as
well as being world-ranked for the
past three years.
"Jeff Rouse is the definition of a
great athlete, someone who makes
everybody around him better by
the things he does ... his quality
and work ethic.in practice," said
men's swimming coach Skip Ken
ney. "Yet he's never boastful. You
could talk with him for hours and
you'd never guess he was a great
swimmer. He lets his actions speak
for themselves."
His major feat to date remains
the world record, which he swam
in last summer's Pan Pacific
games. Rouse stands as the the
first person in history to break 55
seconds in the 100-meter back
with a 53.93.
The record came as a surprise
for Rouse who became the best in
the world, leading off a 400 medley
relay, after he had failed to do so in
two individual 200-meter back
swims. Rouse shocked the swim
ming community with his time,
bypassing 54 seconds, after a new
rule had banned the extended
underwater dolphin kick — a rule
which was supposed to slow down
backstrokers.

"I'm not even sure it's sunk in
yet," Rouse said. "I don't think of
myself as the best swimmer in the
world. I'm definitely not invinci
ble. I still have to look at all the
competition equally and see that
they can beat me if I let them."
With the Olympic Trials a week
away, Rouse is tiying to deal with
the country's expectations of him.
In many people's eyes a world
record holder should win the gold
medal or else be considered a fail
ure, but Rouse sees it differently.
"In 1988 (Olympic Trials) I
failed miserably. I was ranked No.
2, but I kept thinking of what I
saw as everyone else's expecta
tions of me," Rouse said.
"I was thinking about my fami
ly, friends, neighbors, barber,
teammates and coaches, and what
I felt were their expectations," he
jokes. "It was never, 'I've got to
make the team.' It just broke me
down, but now I've learned to deal
with that part of my emotions."
Rouse has continued the same
training regimen that brought him
the world-record, and has tried to
keep the 1992 Olympic Trials in
perspective.
"I have to think of it as just
another meet," Rouse said."lf you
start changing what's worked in
the past, you might screw up. Like
sitting out from school. You'd
swim the same, just you'd be
stressed out."
Also adding pressure is the
NCAA championship falling two
weeks after Trials, forcing swim
mers to either overcome disap
pointment or refocus after attain
ing a major goal. "[NCAA champi
onships] may be more, or as much,
on my mind as Olympic Trials.
We've never won NCAA's (in his
three years)," said Rouse.
Rouse does admit, however,
that qualifying for the Olympics
would be an incredible experience.
"Going to the Olympics, and win
ning a gold medal, would mean

that all the years, the past fifteen
to seventeen years of swimming
every single day .. . those days
paid off," he said.
He is quick to explain that the
time has been well spent, however.
As an athlete, Rouse enjoys water
skiing snow skiing, and dirtbike
riding, but has put those pursuits
on hold, for now. "Sometimes I'm
bummed that I couldn't go to
Tahoe, but I made the choice to do
swimming. It's a trade off for

something greater. I can go to
Tahoe for the rest of my life."
Even as a world-ranked swim
mer, Rouse would like to appear a
normal Stanford student who, like
most, "enjoys more than anything
hanging out and procrastinating
on school work."
"I hate it when I meet people
and I'm introduced as a world
record holder, or an Olympic hope
ful," Rouse explained. "I'm kind of
a quiet guy. It scares me that I'd be

interpreted as stuck-up or cocky."
After this year, Rouse will fin
ish up at Stanford, but will remain
in competitive swimming until the
World Championships in 1994.
Rouse is still improving his swim
ming and plans to stay competitive
as long as he's getting better — to
"milk it for all it's worth."
"I'm so glad I got to share in
Jeff Rouse, and the experience of
coaching him," Kenney said. "He's
the strongest swimmer, in the

water, that I've ever coached . ..
but he always gives to others and
never takes. If I was going to drive
cross-country, I'd like to drive with
Jeff. He's that kind of guy."
"I'm not the type of guy who
goes looking for a lot of attention.
I'm not a playboy or a show off,"
Rouse asserts, "If you passed by
my room and saw me sitting there,
you probably wouldn't even think
I was an athlete."
Until you saw him swim.

Jeff Rouse at work on his backstroke. Rouse doesn't have much to work on in this area. He is the reigning NCAA champion in the 100-yard
backstroke, and holds the world record in the 100-meter backstroke by over a second.
