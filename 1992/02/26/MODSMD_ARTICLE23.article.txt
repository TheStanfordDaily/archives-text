# Card hockey: the ice men cometh
## 
### 
Hockey is a collision sport. It says an on the watjuog
labels that equipment manufacturers put on their
products:
"Hockey is a collision sport and therefore protec
tion from all injury cannot be guaranteed."
Football equipment has the same kind of warn
ings, but it is deemed only a "contact" sport. In foot
ball people run after each other for the sake of a
tackle. In hockey, players traveling up to 30 miles an
hour try to ram each other in order to break up their
opponent's play. They call it a check, but "crash"
would be a better word. Like a demolition derby on
ice, players collide for the sake of possessing a piece
of Czechoslovakian rubber, in hopes of putting it in
the enemy goal. It is fast and often brutal, but
America loves it, and believe it or not, Stanford has
it.
Introducing the 1991-92 Stanford Ice Hockey
Team.
"We are probably Stanford's best kept secret,"
said Cardinal head coach Ernie Ferrari. "Right
down the road is the world's fastest, most exciting
sport, and our own athletic department only recent
ly realized that we had a team."
Now ranked No. 10 on the national club level as
well as holding first place in the Pacific Coast Hock
ey Association, the 19-6-1 Cardinal has been suc
cessful enough for fans to call Stanford's ticket
office for information. But until a few weeks ago,
those fans were only greeted by silence and surprise.
Ice Hockey? Stanford has a field hockey team, but
this is California — we don't play ice hockey
Au contraire, mon frere. The Golden State may

not have much water, but it has plenty of electricity,
and that is about all you need to make hockey in Cal
ifornia. Much like huge meat freezers in a desert, ice
rinks dot California from Humbolt to San Diego. A
rink in nearby Fremont helped produce gold medal
figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi, and Ferrari hopes
Golden Gate Ice Arena in Redwood City will produce
this year's PCHA champions.
"We definitely have shown the talent to win the
league," said the fifth year coach, whose team is
made up of many players who were recruited by
Division 111 schools back east. "We have the PCHA's
leading scorer and its No.l and No. 2 goalies. We
also have depth, which allows us to just keep coming
at our opponents.
"Stanford hockey is fun to watch, and I hope a lot
of students come out for Friday's game."
Friday would be The Big Skate. Like every other
Stanford sport, the hockey team also shares a heat
ed (or perhaps I should say "chilled") rivalry with


T.C. Hall
the University of California at
Berkeley. This game will actual
ly be the third in a four-game
season series, but as the Cardi
nal's last home game it gets the
distinction of being THE game
between the schools. Stanford
has won the first two games eas
ily, yet we all know that any
thing can happen when Cardinal
meets Blue-and-Gold, and we all
know how much fun it is to be

there and make it happen.
"I didn't know too much
about the (hockey) rivalry when
I got here," said freshman Luke
Winter, who leads the PCHA in
scoring with 60 points. "I knew I
was supposed to hate Cal, but
didn't really understand why. It
wasn't until we played up at
their place and saw how "polite"
their fans were that I hated Cal
and probably will until the day I
die."
Winter went on say that he
hoped Stanford students would
help repay the kindness, along
the way pointing out another rea

son why Friday's game should
appeal to the fan.
"You are a lot closer to the
action than something like foot
ball, and are constantly in dan
ger of being too close, which
means you can never relax,"
Winter said in reference to flying
pucks, sticks and bodies. "It is
also faster than football, with
the only break in action coming
between the periods, not after
every play.
"Plus, it's a hell of a lot cheap
er."
Tickets are $2. Collision
begins at 7 p.m.

Friday would be The Big Skate. Like every other
Stanford sport, the hockey team also shares a heat
ed (or perhaps I should say "chilled") rivalry with


T.C. Hall
the University of California at
Berkeley. This game will actual
ly be the third in a four-game
season series, but as the Cardi
nal's last home game it gets the
distinction of being THE game
between the schools. Stanford
has won the first two games eas
ily, yet we all know that any
thing can happen when Cardinal
meets Blue-and-Gold, and we all
know how much fun it is to be

there and make it happen.
"I didn't know too much
about the (hockey) rivalry when
I got here," said freshman Luke
Winter, who leads the PCHA in
scoring with 60 points. "I knew I
was supposed to hate Cal, but
didn't really understand why. It
wasn't until we played up at
their place and saw how "polite"
their fans were that I hated Cal
and probably will until the day I
die."
Winter went on say that he
hoped Stanford students would
help repay the kindness, along
the way pointing out another rea

son why Friday's game should
appeal to the fan.
"You are a lot closer to the
action than something like foot
ball, and are constantly in dan
ger of being too close, which
means you can never relax,"
Winter said in reference to flying
pucks, sticks and bodies. "It is
also faster than football, with
the only break in action coming
between the periods, not after
every play.
"Plus, it's a hell of a lot cheap
er."
Tickets are $2. Collision
begins at 7 p.m.
