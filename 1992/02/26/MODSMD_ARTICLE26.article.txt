# Cardinal hurlers humble Dons

### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Ugly. That is probably the best word to
describe Tuesday's baseball game between Stan
ford and San Francisco State. Was it ever a mess.
Stanford won the game 10-3, and was clearly the
dominant team. However, before the game ended,
between the two teams there would be six errors,
29 different players, nine pitchers and plenty of
wild pitches and passed balls for everyone.
The game started out fine. The starter for
Stanford was Andrew Lorraine, who usually
comes in from the bullpen, and San Francisco
started Chad Baldwin. The runs came fast, when
a first inning Dave Cornell single, a walk, and a
double steal put runners on second and third.
Then, with Steve Solomon at the plate, coach
Mark Marquess called for a bunt. Solomon
responded by hitting the worst possible bunt, pop
ping it up in between first base and the pitcher's
mound. Fortunately for Solomon and the Cardi
nal, Baldwin wasn't able to get to the ball, and
Cornell scored.
In the bottom of the fourth, San Francisco flat
out lost it. Walk. Hit batsman. Wild pitch, runners
advance. New pitcher. Walk. Walk, run scores.
Passed ball, runners advance, run scores. New
pitcher. Sacrifice bunt, runners advance, run
scores. Walk. Boy, that's good old fashioned base
ball for ya. In the inning, three runs on no hits.

in the sixth, Tim Moore came in to relieve Lor
raine of his unusually long stint, and struck out
two batters in the seventh. But the Don pitchers
had a little tougher time of it. A Jed Hansen sin
gle, a walk, and an error on the San Francisco sec
ond baseman left the bases full for Dusty Allen to
strike out and Mark Skeels to drive in a run with
a sac fly.
In the top of the eighth, Moore again struck
out two Don batters. But again, San Francisco
pitchers looked a little lost in the bottom of the
inning. Chris Kemper led off with a solid single to
left, and John Lynch followed up with a big home
run to left.
The the fun began. New pitcher. Another error
on the shortstop let pinchhitter Matt Bokemeier
get on base. Wild pitch, runner advances. Walk.
Pinch hitter. Walk. Pinch runner. New pitcher.
Walk, run scores. Fielder's choice, safe at first.
Single, RBI. Pinch runner. Wild pitch, runners
advance. Get all that? The five runs on three hits
almost enabled the Cardinal to reach that elusive
as-many-hits-as-runs plateau.
So Lynch comes in to pitch the ninth. His fast
ball put the Dons out of their misery, right?
Wrong. He got knocked. A single, a passed ball, a
wild pitch, and two stand-up doubles (not neces
sarily in that order) led to three San Francisco
runs before three outs were recorded. No shut out
for Stanford, but at least the game came to a mer
ciful end.
