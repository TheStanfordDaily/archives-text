# Gridiron news: Walsh a coup, Nelson a mirage
## Leland: Walsh 'a wild card' 
### Noah Blake Staff writer 
About five weeks ago, Stanford University
needed a football coach badly. Some potential
recruits were wavering on whether they would
come to the Farm, the program seemed in dis
array, and the advances that the Cardinal had
made under Dennis Green seemed in jeopardy
of being lost.
But then athletic director Ted Leland called
ex-Stanford head football coach and coaching
legend Bill Walsh.
"At first, Bill was kind of a wild card. Then I
talked to a mutual friend," Leland said. "He
indicated that Bill might be interested .... We
had a preliminary discussion, and on Tuesday
night Bill indicated that he wanted the job."
Aside from his sterling reputation, Walsh
had lots to offer Stanford, including a closeness
to the program that Leland was looking for.
"With the kind of success that we've had, we
were really interested in keeping continuity,"
Leland said. "I knew that a lot of what coach
Green was implementing was Bill Walsh's
influence. Make no mistake, it was Dennis
Green's program. But the way we traveled, the
way we practiced, the type of offense we ran,
the interaction between the coaches and the
players ... ."
Walsh, of course, had many other attributes
which uniquely qualified him for the job.
"Bill is a great teacher," Leland said. "And
he has said publicly that the most fun that he
ever had in coaching was at Stanford .... He
also clearly indicated that he sees football as a

part of the University."
Leland recognized, however, that the rev
enue that a Walsh-coached team could bring to
Stanford was also a consideration in the hiring
process. He cited potential increases in season
ticket sales and national television appearances
as sources of additional dollars.
"There's so much interest in our program
now," Leland said. "It's highly unlikely that we
would have gotten the Pigskin Classic without
Bill. Normally that game is given to Top 8
teams in the country. Our players earned the
right to play in that game, but Walsh's pres
ence made a difference."
Stanford will play on Aug. 26th against
Texas A&M in the Pigskin Classic, and will
receive both national television exposure and at
least $550,000.
On Walsh's end, however, money was hard
ly a factor in his decision.
"Bill turned down huge amounts of money
to come to Stanford." Leland said. "As a busi
ness person, I might have given him Tresidder
Union. Bill is, maybe, a model for how people
ought to look at their lives, in terms of choosing
what you want to do instead of choosing the
money."
Leland believes that Walsh and all of his
qualities will translate into a highly successful
football program.
"We want the student-athletes to have the best
experience that they can." Leland said. "We'd like
to be a nationally competitive team. When people
talk about the best football teams in the country,
we'd like them to mention Stanford."
Yet even though the future looks very bright
for the Cardinal football program, Leland plays
down his role in the coup of hiring Bill
Walsh.

"Would he have gone to another school?
Probably not." Leland said. "Would he still
have come to Stanford if I wasn't AD? Proba
bly. Sometimes it's better to be lucky than
good. Basically we didn't blow it."
Nelson to stay in Minnesota
One week after he was named running backs
coach, Darrin Nelson has resigned his position
on the Stanford football staff due to the failing
health of his son.
Nelson, who recently wound up a 10-year
National Football League career with the Min
nesota Vikings, will remain in the Minneapolis
area to live with his wife and three-year old son,
Alex. On February 20, Alex underwent surgery
to remove his tumorous left kidney and began a
year-long chemotherapy and radiation treat
ment.
"I was planning to commute between Stan
ford and Minnesota for a while," said Nelson
from Minnesota, "but at this point I feel it is in
the best interest of my family for me to remain
here."
Head coach Bill Walsh, who made the
announcement yesterday, remained optimistic
that Nelson would join his staff at some future
date.
"While we are extremely disappointed that
Darrin is not returning to Stanford, our main
concern at this time is the health of his son,"
said Walsh. "I'm hopeful that we can work
something out in the future and bring Darrin
back to Stanford."
Nelson, recently elected to the Stanford all
time all-star roster, holds several single school
records, including the career touchdowns and
yards rushing marks.
