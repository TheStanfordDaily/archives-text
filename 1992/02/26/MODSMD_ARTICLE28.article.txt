A break in the stormy weather was welcomed by
Stanford's sailing team, who competed in two
regattas, the North Series No. 3 and the Douglas
Cup, this weekend. The sailors cruised to com
mendable first and fifth place finishes in the
respective events, but when the breeze disap
peared with the clouds, Stanford had to pull in its
sails as both races were cut short.
In Saturday's North Series No. 3, hosted by San
Jose State, Stanford posted a convincing first
place finish in a field of eight schools. Berkeley fol
lowed the Cardinal at a distant second .
Head coach Blake Middleton praised the perfor
mance of his squad, as Stanford sailors took top
honors in both A and B division. "At this point, we
are dominating the North Series, and unless
Berkeley wakes up, they won't beat us," Middleton
commented.
Skipper Matt Sanford and crew Kristen Sidell
represented the Cardinal in A division, while skip
per Charles Meade teamed with crew Katherine
Chen atop B division.
The Cardinal also sailed to victory in North
Series No. 1, held several weeks ago. The North
Series determines berths to the Pacific Coast
Championships.
Despite dying winds on Saturday afternoon,
competitors at the Douglas Cup, hosted by the
Long Beach Yacht Club, were able to complete

most of their scheduled races.
This weekend, Stanford hosts the Team Race
Invitational at Port of Redwood City.
Women's lax go to Santa Barbara

Though their goalie was back home, the Stan
ford women's lacrosse team still managed a second
place finish in the Santa Barbara Tournament this
past weekend. The Cardinal "A" team competed in
the 11 team all-college division, losing the champi
onship to host Santa Barbara by a score of 10-7.
"We were pleased with our results, but hope to
beat Santa Barbara in the Western States (Tour
nament)," said senior co-captain Sonya Rudens
tine. "It was tough because we were playing with
out our goalie. We had two players in goal who had
never played before, but did a great job."
The lack of a regular goalie was not evident as
Stanford blew out California 10-2 and Occidental
College 16-2 before squeaking by UC-Davis 7-6.
Though they have been practicing all year, the
tournament provided the first official games for
the Cardinal, and they responded by sending three
players to the all-tournament team, Jessica Bar,
Jennifer Watts, and Rudenstine. Stanford will
play its next home games April 4 and 5 when the
Cardinal meets Santa Cruz on Saturday, and
Humbolt and Chico State on Sunday. The follow
ing weekend Stanford will welcome approximately
15-20 teams to the Farm for the Western States
Tournament.
