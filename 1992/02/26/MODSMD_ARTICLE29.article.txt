After recuperating from the frantically-paced fall
season, the women's golf team competed in Tucson,
Arizona in the Arizona Intercollegiate, placing fourth
in their only meet this winter quarter. The Cardinal
finished with a total score of 926, behind the powerful
Arizona team, UCLA and Texas, narrowly edging out
USC's 927 strokes.
Stanford had promising performances from
Audrey Wooding, Martha Richards and Melinda
Daniels. The tournament, which featured 36 holes on
Monday and 18 on Tuesday, was a mentally taxing
competition.
Wooding finished ninth individually, despite bat
tling an inflamed left hip and knee. She shot 78-74-74
to lead the Cardinal.
"We weren't going to bring her, because she's

injured," said coach Tim Baldwin. "But she really
wanted to come and play ... and boy did she play."
"I know the course and I went into the tournament
with a good attitude," Wooding said. "My knee's been
getting a lot better. My mental game is getting very
strong."
Martha Richards had a highlight performance for
Stanford during the second round on Monday, shoot
ing a 71, one under par. The round was a personal
best for Richards, who has never broken par.
"I've been having great practice sessions, and
that's evident in my game," Richards said. "Golf is
about fine tuning... I had January and February to
work on my game and groove my swing."
Stanford is now gearing up for the busy spring sea
son, hoping the weather stays favorable, as the last
two weeks of rain cut out a lot of their practice time.
"Playing in a lot of tournaments helps," Wooding
said. "You get a momentum going from week to week."
