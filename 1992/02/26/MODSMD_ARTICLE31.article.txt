# Ancient Peruvians lived within means
## Caveman culture set ecological example for modern society

A 10,000-year-old Peruvian culture
that was able to successfully monitor
and manage its environment may hold
some answers to modern problems con
cerning the management of natural
resources, according to Anthropology
Prof. John Rick.
Rick recently presented his research
on ancient societies from the Puna
region of Peru to the American Associa
tion for the Advancement of Science in
Chicago.
After 13 years of working with Stan
ford undergraduates in the Peruvian high
lands, Rick has compiled extensive evi
dence on one of the first known cultures to
create a sustainable environment.
The excavation of human and animal
remains has allowed Rick to make many
assumptions about past behaviors of
this group. High concentrations of
bones in the site indicate that this soci
ety was able to subsist in the area for
8,000 years, a rarity among mobile soci
eties of the time.
Archaeological evidence also sug
gests that the Puna communities main
tained a population size of about 200
group members and that they kept a
plentiful supply of their primary food
source, a llama-like animal called the
vicuna, by primarily hunting aging
adults. These practices were essential
for remaining in one place.
Rick suggested that the successful
resource management of these people

resulted from a "simplified environment
and the high visibility of their
resources."
Aside from the vicuna, there were few
other food sources in the highland's
ecology. The vicuna herds were an oasis
of food in a veritable wasteland.
"The primary resource of this area is
this one animal species so that if you
dealt with this animal species inade
quately, you die or you move out," Rick
said. "Clearly it was an option for people
to go ahead and overexploit the species
or mismanage, but it does not seem to be
what they chose."
The position of the culture's cave
dwellings above the territories where
the vicuna roamed made it easy for the
people to monitor the herds and observe
the effects of their hunting practices.
This direct observation of their impact
on herds and the resulting effect on
their food supply forced behavioral mod
ifications to prevent exhaustion of their
resources.
Comparing that to our situation
today, Rick explained: "Unfortunately,
in an environment as complex as ours
with thousands of species, we are not as
quick to observe or feel the human
impact. Even with our technology today,
how are we going to be able to keep track
of all those species and make sure that
none of them are going to be terminally
threatened?"
Rick said scientific applications alone
are not going to solve our problems. Rec
ognizing that it is impossible to make

every U.S. citizen understand how their
actions and assumptions affect the ani
mal and plant species of the world, Rick
suggested a change in our belief system.
"Somewhere along the way the Puna
peoples created a belief system within
their society that encouraged respect for
the environment," he said. "They might
have thought of killing too many animals
as being offensive to a natural power or
they might have thought of reproducing
themselves as being equally offensive in
relation to some greater power."
The Puna, Rick said, "developed
some sort of a system that undoubtedly
was fully rational to them and which
allowed them to develop a good relation
ship with their environment that was
lasting across thousands of years."
This is a model that Rick said he
would like to see followed today. "What
you have to do is create a belief system
which has the right output in the end;
that creates the right human behavior
and that leads to a good relationship
between humans and their environ
ment," he said.
Although guerilla activity has pre
cluded recent trips to the area, Rick con
tinues to publish information on the
subject. When the region is once again
safe, he intends to return to the area
with fresh ideas and enthusiasm.
In the interim, Rick has been working
with a group of Stanford students and
high school students from a pueblo Indi
an group called the Zuni on summer
excavation projects in New Mexico.

relation to some greater power."
The Puna, Rick said, "developed
some sort of a system that undoubtedly
was fully rational to them and which
allowed them to develop a good relation
ship with their environment that was
lasting across thousands of years."
This is a model that Rick said he
would like to see followed today. "What
you have to do is create a belief system
which has the right output in the end;
that creates the right human behavior
and that leads to a good relationship
between humans and their environ
ment," he said.
Although guerilla activity has pre
cluded recent trips to the area, Rick con
tinues to publish information on the
subject. When the region is once again
safe, he intends to return to the area
with fresh ideas and enthusiasm.
In the interim, Rick has been working
with a group of Stanford students and
high school students from a pueblo Indi
an group called the Zuni on summer
excavation projects in New Mexico.
