## Bug finds vitamin C in unusual places

"The semen would appear both by smell
and taste to be a mawkish kind of sub
stance, but when held in the mouth it pro
duces a warmth similar to spices."

Q: If semen is mostly a sucrose solu
tion, why does it taste salty?
— Anonymous
A : Well, I'm not the connoisseur of
xJLmale ejaculatory fluid that you seem
to be, so I'd never had the chance or the
inclination to ponder this profound mys
tery before you asked. Nonetheless, I hit
the books and came through for you.
First of all, semen is not "mostly"
sucrose, or any kind of sugar. The thing it
comes closest to being "mostly" made of
is protein, which makes up a third to a
half of semen's dry weight. The sperm
cells themselves — there are between 300
and 400 million in the average human
ejaculation — account for most of this
protein.
The rest of the protein — enzymes,
mostly — is floating free in the fluid part
of the semen, called the seminal plasma.
This plasma, which accounts for most of
the fluid volume of the semen, is not
secreted from the testicles themselves
but rather from several accessory glands
further downstream.
Among these accessory glands are the
seminal vesicles, which provide the sperm
with the sugar they will need for the long
journey ahead. The sugar they provide,
however, is not sucrose but fructose.
Sucrose would be a dumb choice as an
energy supply for a couple of reasons. Not
only would sucrose make the semen much
more viscous — making ejaculation some
thing of a chore — it would be much hard
er for the sperm to use than fructose.
See, sucrose is a disaccharide (that's
Science for "two sugars"). Before a
sucrose molecule can be used for energy, a
cell has to cleave it into its constituent
monosaccharides (you guessed it, Sher
lock — "one sugar "), glucose and fructose.
Given that almost every sperm made
by the body is doomed to a pointless
death, to make the poor little sperm per
form this metabolic drudgery would be
adding insult to injury. Instead, the
sperm are provided with raw, easy-to-use
fructose.
But I digress. On to matters of taste:
If semen tastes briny to you, it's prob
ably because it has a pretty high sodium
chloride content. The average ejaculation
contains about half a gram of common
table salt — what your grandmother
would have called a "pinch," if she were
whipping up a batch of semen.
If semen tastes mostly salty to you,
however, you're in the minority. Most peo
ple in a position to know such things find
semen to have a pleasant odor — not
unlike cut grass or fresh pollen, says The
Joy of Sex — but a more or less bitter taste.
"Mawkish," just like Mr. Hunter said.

Another contributor to
semen's sharp flavor is
ascorbate, known to
the Lay Person as
vitamin C.

The bitterness comes partly from cit
ric acid, which is one of the chemicals
that give lemons, limes and oranges their
mouth-puckering tang. Citric acid, an
important intermediate in many of the
body's metabolic pathways, is plentiful,
and there is almost as much of it in
semen as there is protein.
Another contributor to semen's sharp
flavor is ascorbate, known to the Lay
Person as vitamin C. Every milliliter of
semen contains ten milligrams of ascor
bate; this means that the average ejacu
lation contains more than 60 percent of
the U.S. RDA for vitamin C. Volume per
volume, that's a heck of a lot more than
Food Service orange juice. Think about
it.
Finally, for those men among you who
are considering one day using your semen
for something other than a recreational
beverage, consider this: the Vitamin C in
semen might serve to protect the sperm's
all-important cargo, the DNA, from dam
age.
Preliminary findings by Bruce Ames, a
researcher at UC-Berkeley, indicate that
increasing your dietary ascorbate (and
thus the ascorbate concentration in
semen) decreases the incidence of genetic
defects in your sperm.
Pretty interesting work, no? One
might almost say — seminal.
