# Poor diet, not genes, impedes weight gain
## 
### Catherine Ivey 
Significant increases in the
average weight and height of
Asian-American children in the
last decade show that poor health
and nutrition, and not genetic fac
tors, are the primary causes of
stunted growth, according to a
study published in last week's
Journal of the American Medical
Association.
But in a response to the study,
a Stanford researcher emphasized
that similar health statistics for
low-income black children did not
show the same improvements,
and urged policy makers not to
cut health care programs for the
underserved.
The findings show that over a
10-year period, the weights and
heights of Asians rose to equal
level with Hispanics and whites
also receiving public health care.
The remarkable changes are
most likely the result of improve
ments in health conditions, nutri
tion and socio-economic status,
according to the study.
That environmental influences
significantly affected develop
ment throws into question the
assumption that Asians are short
er and lighter than other ethnic
groups for genetic reasons.
Dr. Ray Yip, a researcher in
the nutrition division of the Cen
ters for Disease Control in
Atlanta, believes his findings
demonstrate that other ethnici
ties like the Asian-American
group studied could grow to a
healthy weight and size if their
environments were improved.
However, while the study
showed improved statistics of
growth in Asian children, those
for black children only improved
minimally. In an editorial accom
panying the study, Dr. Victor
Vaughan 111 of the Stanford Uni
versity School of Medicine said
there is a correlation between low
birthweight, socioeconomic and
sociocultural conditions.
The fact that the black popula
tion in this country has not made
the same progress as Asians
shows the need to target this pop
ulation for more and better

health care, especially prenatal
care, he said.
A significant result of this
study, Vaughan pointed out, is
that it documents the need for
public health programs.
"We know the frequency of
low-birth weight can be markedly
adjusted to (national) standards if
(pregnant) black women were
recruited quickly into prenatal
programs," he said.
Vaughan called government
plans to cut back programs that
provide assistance to the under
served "a tragic failure of our
health policy".
Around 90 percent of the Asian
children in the study were
refugees from Southeast Asia.
The study pointed to the radical
change in their environment
when they immigrated and the
resulting improvements in nutri
tion and absence of endemic dis
eases. These improvements
explain the children's rapid
growth, the study concluded.
Within just three years of
immigrating to this country, sig
nificant growth was recorded as
advantages of the new environ
ment began to take effect.
Yip and his colleagues com
pared the growth and develop
ment statistics of the Asian chil
dren with Hispanic, black and
white children of the same age
and low-income status.
Yip found that in the areas of
weight-for-age, height-for-age
and weight-for-height, Asian chil
dren were much more likely to
measure below standard than
Hispanics, blacks or whites.
Yip, along with colleagues, sur
veyed over 28,000 Asian children
under the age of five to determine
how many infants from low
income families were born at a
low birth weight (less than 2500
grams) and how many Asian chil
dren did not meet up to U.S.
growth standards in the 1980s, as
set by the National Center for
Health Statistics.
They gathered their data from
families enrolled in public health
care clinics in 12 cities across the
nation, and compared the weights
of children along racial lines.
