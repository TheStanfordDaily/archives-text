# Senate slams tuition hike
## Bill asks for reconsideration 
### Andy Dworkin Katie Mauro Staff writers 
The ASSU Senate last night advised students to
just say no to the University.
The senate approved a bill and petition drive
opposing next year's tuition hike.
Another bill would have the senate send postcards
to the parents of every undergraduate asking them
to protest the increase by writing to University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy and the Board of Trustees.
The postcard proposal had not yet been consid
ered at midnight.
By a 16-3 vote, the senate passed a bill saying
next year's 9.5 percent increase in tuition "should
be publicly reconsidered with student consultation."
The bill also stated that "additional cuts from the
operating budget and additional sources of revenue
should be explored fully and openly before tuition
increases of this magnitude are implemented."
The bill was proposed in response to a tuition
increase approved by the University Board of
Trustees on Feb. 11. The change would raise tuition
9.5 percent, to $16,536 next year.
The proposal was authored by Council of Presi
dents members John Overdeck and Beth Morgan
and graduate senator Doug Bone.
Overdeck called it a "strong statement," and said
the senate needed to send a mes
sage to the administration oppos
ing the tuition hike.
"Sometime, somebody has to
say this is enough," he said.
According to Overdeck, the
tuition increase is unnecessary if
the University makes all of the
planned budget cuts for the next
fiscal year. If the University fully
implements all the administra
tion's proposed cuts, as well as the
tuition increase, it would be left
with a budget surplus, he said.
The bill is not the only move
senators are taking to oppose the
tuition hike. -Undergraduate sena
tor JRusseU. Calleros .wrote a peti
tion opposing the increase and is
distributing it to senators, who will
in turn gather student signatures.
The petition reads, in part,
"We, the students of Stanford
University, are appalled at the
recent proposal to increase the
University's yearly tuition by 9.5
percent."
It states that students "find

very little confidence that [they]
can deal effectively with these
astronomical costs," and "expect
next year's increase to be due
solely to inflation."
The petition asks the Universi
ty to "consider other alternatives
before hastily deciding on such a
dramatic increase in the costs of
tuition and room and board."
According to Calleros, about
100 students have already signed
the petition. He said he hopes to
collect at least 1,000 student sig
natures. The completed petitions
will eventually be sent to Kennedy,
Provost James Rosse, Board of
Trustees President James Gaither
and Ted Mitchell, an assistant to
Kennedy and Rosse.
The postcard proposal, which
was authored by Morgan, would
cost, the senate $1,562.
Morgan said she was meeting
with Kennedy Friday and would
only launch the mailing campaign if
she found the administration "not
responsive" to student concerns.
In other business, the senate
voted on which organizations'
special fee requests they will put
on the ballot for April's ASSU
election.
