# University granted extension in trust fund case
## 
### Chris Eisenberg Staff writer 
Stanford and a Los Angeles museum
will have at least another 90 days to prove
they — and not the Christian Science
Church —deserve the first installment of a
$92 million trust fund, the Los Angeles
Superior Court decided yesterday.
Judge Edward Ross granted the request
ed delay, filed jointly by the University and
Los Angeles County Museum, to allow the
two potential beneficiaries time to gather
more information. The case will return to
court May 27.
The first installment of the trust is
worth about $22 million.
Senior University Counsel Carol Swenson
said Stanford is "pleased the judge has grant

ed the continuance" and will "be participat
ing in the search for more information."
The trust was originally established to
encourage the Boston-based church to pub
lish Bliss Knapp's controversial 1947 biog
raphy of church founder Mary Baker Eddy,
"The Destiny of Mother Church." Accord
ing to the trust, the church is required to
print the book as "authorized material"
and distribute and display it in "substan
tially all" church reading rooms.
If the church fails to meet the trust's
requirements by May 1993, Stanford and the
museum will split the first installment. The
second installment of $75 million will be
granted, based on the same criteria, 21 years
after the death of its still-living trustee.
The church finally published the book last
August. In December, the trustees claimed

they were satisfied the church had met the
trust's requirements and asked the court to
grant the first $22 million to the church.
Stanford and Museum Associates — the
non-profit group charged with supporting
the museum — objected, claiming it is
unclear whether the church has actually
met the requirements.
According to Chip Rawlings, one of two
attorneys representing Museum Associ
ates, the church has said that 97 percent of
its reading rooms are now carrying
Knapp's book. In contrast, Rawlings cited a
January survey published by the London
Independent that found only 43 of 150
Christian Science reading rooms — about
30 percent — currently carry the book.
Rawlings said these figures "call into
question" the church's claim that Knapp's

book is in "substantially all" reading rooms.
Nathan Talbot, a spokesperson for the
church, said he believes the book is widely
distributed throughout its reading rooms.
"From our point of view, virtually all of the
churches have carried it,"he said.
Of seven local reading rooms contacted
by The Daily, all currently have the book
available to buy or borrow.
Talbot also said that although the book
does not carry a label identifying it as
"authorized literature," it is indeed fully
authorized by the church. In fact, he said,
no church literature carries such a stamp.
Both sides deny they are motivated by
the prospect of financial gain. Rawlings
and Swenson said their only goal is to
ensure that the wishes of the trustee are
being met.
