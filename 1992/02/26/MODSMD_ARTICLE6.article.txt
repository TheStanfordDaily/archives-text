# OUR HIDDEN DIVERSITY
## Inside community, differences abound

At age 12, half-white and half-
Taos Pueblo Indian sophomore
Josh Concha endured a six
month tribal initiation that only
two other half-Native Americans
had completed before.
He refrained from eating any
store-bought foods and had no
contact with anyone outside his
small village, meaning he couldn't
talk to his white father in New
York — a "sacrifice" for them
both that his father supported.

Sheila McCabe, the first student
from the Colorado River Indian
Reservation to attend Stanford,
said the tribal elders are intimi
dated by her when she goes
home. "They think I'm too
good," she said.
Senior Tonya Campbell, a
member of the Paiute tribe of
Nevada, said forced government
relocation "basically destroyed
our tribe." Growing up in a
mostly white community, she
had to make an effort to learn
about her tribe's rapidly disap

The United States govern

Native American Cultural Center

and a Comanche. "People don't
identify themselves by 'American
Indian' or 'Alaska Native,' but by
their tribal background."
He likened putting students
under the category Native
American to expecting all inter
national students from Europe
to be the same.

Stanford's 140 Native Ameri
can students represent more
than 40 tribes, Larimore said.
Navajo, Sioux, Cherokee and
Alaska Native tribes are the
most highly represented.
Muscogee/Creek Bill Bray, a
doctoral student in educational
anthropology, cited a recent gov
ernment survey which found
that while Native Americans
make up only 1 percent of the
United States' population, they
account for 50 percent of its
diversity. And with over 300 lan
guages, they comprise the bulk
of American linguistic diversity.
Perspectives and world views
differ widely among tribes. "It's
