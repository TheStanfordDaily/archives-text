# OUR HIDDEN DIVERSITY
## Inside community, differences abound 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
At age 12, half-white and half-
Taos Pueblo Indian sophomore
Josh Concha endured a six
month tribal initiation that only
two other half-Native Americans
had completed before.
He refrained from eating any
store-bought foods and had no
contact with anyone outside his
small village, meaning he couldn't
talk to his white father in New
York — a "sacrifice" for them
both that his father supported.
Navajo/Sioux sophomore
Sheila McCabe, the first student
from the Colorado River Indian
Reservation to attend Stanford,
said the tribal elders are intimi
dated by her when she goes
home. "They think I'm too
good," she said.
Senior Tonya Campbell, a
member of the Paiute tribe of
Nevada, said forced government
relocation "basically destroyed
our tribe." Growing up in a
mostly white community, she
had to make an effort to learn
about her tribe's rapidly disap
pearing traditions.
The United States govern
ment calls Concha, McCabe and
Campbell "Native Americans."
But they represent a staggering
diversity of cultures, languages
and beliefs.
"'Native American' is a false
category, a vast generalization,"
said Jim Larimore, director of the
Native American Cultural Center

and a Comanche. "People don't
identify themselves by 'American
Indian' or 'Alaska Native,' but by
their tribal background."
He likened putting students
under the category Native
American to expecting all inter
national students from Europe
to be the same.

'Not every tribe
dances in pow
wows, not every
tribe sings.'

Stanford's 140 Native Ameri
can students represent more
than 40 tribes, Larimore said.
Navajo, Sioux, Cherokee and
Alaska Native tribes are the
most highly represented.
Muscogee/Creek Bill Bray, a
doctoral student in educational
anthropology, cited a recent gov
ernment survey which found
that while Native Americans
make up only 1 percent of the
United States' population, they
account for 50 percent of its
diversity. And with over 300 lan
guages, they comprise the bulk
of American linguistic diversity.
Perspectives and world views
differ widely among tribes. "It's

Stanford's Native American community embodies a wide array of cultures, lan
guages and beliefs. Above, from left, are: Tonya Campbell, a Paiute; Mari Hately, a

never, 'My tribe does it this way,'
but, 'This is the way it's done,'"
Campbell said.
Traditional tribal rivalries
often take the form of "friendly
teasing, jokes made about parts of
one culture," said Larimore, who
is the resident fellow for Muwek
ma-Tah-Ruk.
Discovering diversity
Bray, who came from a town of
900 in Oklahoma, didn't know
much about tribes outside his
own and those nearby before
attending college. When he went
to Dartmouth, he began to realize
how diverse the tribes were.
Oklahoma Native Americans
have much in common, he said,
but he was surprised to learn that
some other Native Americans
went to prep schools and that
there were Native Americans in
the Eastern United States. "New
York Indians are different — a
mixture of recognizable Indian
and New York attitudes — more
brusque and hurried," he said.
Alaska Native Mari Hately,
who is one-fourth Yupik, lived in a
small Alaska town called Bethel
until she was 7, when she moved
to a mostly white neighborhood in
Anchorage. The term Alaska
Native, she said, covers a number
of tribes that differ greatly.
And diversity is evident even
within a tribe. According to
McCabe, there are wide cultural
disparities between Navajos from
her Arizona reservation and those
from the Four Corners area.
Does Concha see any common
bonds among Native American
tribes? "There are no similari
ties," he said. He did add, howev
er, that he has great respect for a
Sioux/Lokota woman he knows

who devoutly follows the religious
practices of her tribe, since he is
also deeply religious.
But Sisseton-Wahpeton Dakota
tribe member Angelique Jackson
sees a wealth of commonalties.
"We're bound by one spirituality,"
she said, noting that traditional val
ues transcend the differences
among indigenous peoples in the
western hemisphere. "The only real
division is lines drawn on maps."
"There is a lot of common
experience because we've been
treated the same way by the dom
inant society," Bray said. For
example, many Native Americans
trade horror stories about bad
doctors in the national Indian
Health Care program. Also, talk
about tribal politics peppers many
conversations, he said.
Reconcilable differences
Bringing the various cultures
together under the umbrella of
the Stanford American Indian
Organization poses difficulties,
students said.
Alaska Natives are often "com
pletely ignored altogether," Hately
said, noting that the term Ameri
can Indian doesn't actually include
Alaska Natives. The American
Indian community tends to be
cliquish, she said. "They don't try
to get to know people who aren't
American Indian."
Within SAIO, differences —
and occasional conflicts — persist:
"Not every tribe dances in pow
wows, not every tribe sings,"
McCabe said.
The annual spring powwow
brings with it "big problems,"
Campbell said, with the diverse
coordinating staff "trying to please
everybody." For example, when
the design for last year's powwow
poster was under consideration,
one group was angry that the U.S.
flag was included on the poster.
Campbell said historically
tense Navajo-Hopi relations —

dating back to centuries-old tribal
land conflicts — sometimes "sky
rocket" on campus, with students
arguing in each other's faces. But
such conflicts usually are not a
major problem, Campbell said.
Larimore agreed. "People realize
there's no point in dividing the com
munity since it's so small," he said.
A Native American student
gathering at the beginning of the
year — in which students told each
other what annoyed them —
"cleared a lot of air," Campbell said.
Reservation vs. urban
Differences in the Native
American community are most
pronounced between reservation
and urban students, McCabe said.
Urban Indians "are kind of lost
as to what their roots really are,
which is sad," said Concha, who
was born in Santa Fe but grew up
in the small New Mexico town of
Taos Canyon.

On reservations, there's "no
hurry, no stress about doing any
thing," said Campbell, a theme
associate at Muwekma-Tah-Ruk.
"Even though I don't live [at the
reservation], it's someplace I
could call home."
McCabe's reservation is unusu
al in that four tribes — Mojave,
Chemehuvi, Navajo and Hopi —
live within one border. Her father
was the first Navajo elected chair
man of the reservation, and he still
remains involved in tribal politics.
McCabe said she wants to dis
pel the myth that only Native
Americans can live on reserva
tions. "People picture a fence, or
think they need permission to go
on the reservation," she said, not
ing that Mexican immigrants
comprise a large segment of the
population on her reservation.
Jackson spent her first 15 years
in Kansas, away from her tribe.
When her family moved to a reser
vation in South Dakota, she said she
suddenly felt a "sense of belonging."
While Kansas public schools
were competitive, Jackson said
she was "strongly supported" by
the entire community in the trib
al school, which offered tribal lan
guage and history classes. Jack
son, a sophomore, said she wants
to become a tribal attorney.
But many students agreed edu
cation on the reservations is poor;
those who excel in tribal schools
are often sent off the reservation
to continue in public or private
schools.
Stanford and Dartmouth are
two particularly popular schools
for top Native American students,
mainly because of their strong
Native American communities,
Bray and Hately said.
Whether from a reservation or a
city, many students agreed that the
Cultural Center at Stanford is like
a home, a place where they can
learn from their diversity while
finding strength in numbers.
