# Crash shuts down Sweet Hall computers
## Air-conditioner problem cited as cause 
### John Ford Staff writer 
Two large computer servers,
including the Leland computer
system, crashed Monday night
due to a problem on the first floor
of the Center for Educational
Research at Stanford.
One of three air conditioners
used to cool the servers began to
emit smoke about 7 p.m., accord
ing to Don Intersimone, facilities
manager for Libraries and Infor
mation Resources.

The smoke was caused by fric
tion between a locked bearing and
a moving rubber part, according
to Dennis Michael, the manager
for Distributive Systems Opera
tion for the Network and Commu
nications Services.
The Leland computer system
— one of the servers affected —
was unavailable to students Mon
day night from about 7 p.m. until
2 a.m., according to Michael. The
server for the entire group of

Sweet Hall workstations was also
shut down at the same time,
along with a computer mailbox
service called "Pop-Server," he
said.
The smoke set off a fire alarm,
which then activated a fire sup
pressant system installed beneath
the floor, Michael said.
The fire department dis
patched two fire engines to
CERAS at 7:12 p.m., along with
four other emergency vehicles,

according to Carter French of the
Stanford Fire Department.
Michael described the shut
down as a "hard crash" and said
the University "couldn't provide
service to students for about six
hours."
No one was injured and the
only equipment that suffered
damage was the air conditioning
unit, he said.
Leland provides electronic
mail capabilities and news bul
letins to computers across cam
pus.
