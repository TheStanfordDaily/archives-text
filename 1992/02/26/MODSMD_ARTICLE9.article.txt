# Campus computer theft drops 61 percent

### John Ford Staff writer 
Theft of campus computers dropped dra
matically last year, thanks to increased safety
measures and vigilance by dormitory residents.
The value of computers lost to theft from
offices and dormitories in 1991 was 61 percent
lower than in 1990. Thirty-three computers
worth a total of $201,623 were stolen in 1990.
In 1991, 23 computers — valued at $78,358 —
were stolen.
The University spends between $50,000
and $100,000 on computer security each year,
according to Jay Senna of the Procurement
Department.
Public Safety Manager Dan Smith said a
program begun in 1987 called "STOPP," the
Stanford Office Protection Program, has pre
vented many of the thefts.
The program encourages University
departments to inventory their computers,

have them engraved and use security devices.
Computers can be equipped with standard
security devices for under $100, Smith said.
If a department takes such precautions but
still falls victim to computer theft, the Univer
sity pays the $1,000 insurance deductible,
according to Risk Management Director Bob
Beth. Beth's department co-sponsors the pro
gram along with the Department of Public
Safety and the Procurement Department.
Smith said widespread participation in the
protection program and "greater awareness of
suspicious people" has led to the decline in
computer thievery.
Chris Wand, a resident computer coordina
tor in Florence Moore Hall, said he thought the
decrease in crime is due to residents keeping
strangers out of the computer clusters. RCC
training on security consists only of "basic com
mon sense kind of stuff," Wand added.
Beth and Senna said recent arrests of
thieves may also deter potential criminals.

'Greater awareness of suspicious
people' has led to the decline in
computer thievery.

University departments currently use
either a plate-based security device, which
attaches the computer to a stationary object,
or alarm systems, according to Smith. A
majority of computer clusters and many
departments use security devices and partici
pate in the protection program.
One new anti-theft device is SONICPRO, a
portable alarm placed on the side of a comput
er. Central Stores, an outlet for University
products, sells the alarm for about $60.
In the past four months, Central Stores has
sold 150 of the alarms, according to Marianne
Bithell, a customer service representative.
