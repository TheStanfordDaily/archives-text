The new Apple" Macintosh" Classic® II
computer makes it easier for you to juggle
classes, activities, projects, and term papers—
and still find time for what makes college
life real life.
It's a complete and affordable Macintosh
Classic system that's ready to help you get
your work finished fast. It's a snap to set up
and use. It has a powerful 68030 micro
processor, which means you can run even
the most sophisticated applications with ease.
And its internal Apple SuperDrivfc™ disk
drive reads from and writes to Macintosh and
MS-DOS formatted disks—allowing you to
exchange information easily with
almost any other kind of computer.

In addition to its built-in capabilities, the
Macintosh Classic II can be equipped with up
to 10 megabytes of RAM, so you'll be able to
run several applications at once and work
with large amounts of data.
If you already own a Macintosh Classic,
and want the speed and flexibility of a
Macintosh Classic 11, ask us about an
upgrade—it can be installed in just minutes
and it's affordable.
To put more time on your side, consider
putting a Macintosh Classic II on your desk.
See us for a demonstration today, and while
you're in, be sure to ask us for details
about the Apple Computer Loan.
It'll be time well spent.
