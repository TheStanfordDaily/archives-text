LEADING THE WAY
On March 5, 1991, VLSI Technology launched an exciting new
company — COMPASS Design Automation — fueling it with 10
years of the industry's most respected ASIC software technology and
staffing it with over 150 of VLSI's talented professionals.
COMPASS is leading the way and setting standards in ASIC design
automation. Our success is centered on our ability to satisfy clients'
extremely complex, high performance requirements, while offering a
choice of silicon vendors and workstation platforms, and co-existence
with popular CAE frameworks. Our open, integrated ASIC design
products offer a combination of capabilities not found elsewhere:
Automatic logic synthesis, Built-in Self-Test (BIST) compilers,
advanced test automation tools, floorplanning, standard interfaces
such as EDIF and VHDL, silicon compilers, place and route software,
and more.
With COMPASS' technology, the most sophisticated customers
have greater control and flexibility over the design of highly complex
ASICs. We're the first to offer it, and you can be among the first to
support and expand upon it.
Join a leader in design automation and start on
a unique path towards success.
