# Cutting costs?
## Legal Office eyes University's $1M in outside spending 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Is the Legal Office really cutting its
budget, or is it the beneficiary of some
creative accounting?
The answer varies, depending on
whom you ask.
"The Legal Office is not cutting its
budget a single dollar," Classics Prof.
Marsh McCall told the Faculty Senate
two weeks ago. "There are zero budget
reductions in the Legal Office because
outside billings are not in the Legal
Office's budget now."
But faculty and administrators who
have spent months working on the
cuts insist it is not that simple.
Over the last few months, the office's
search for ways to reduce its budget by
19.2 percent has led to the discovery of

$1 million the Univer
sity spends each year
on outside legal costs.
This money is above
and beyond the Legal
Office's budget of more
than $2.5 million.
Although much of
the complex account
ing still has to be fig
ured out, the Legal

Office says that outside legal expenses
will be reduced by having the office
perform those functions itself, and
that the savings should be applied to
the office's target.
When outside counsel has been
hired by the University, the depart
ment requesting legal service has tradi
tionally paid for it, a procedure which
scatters legal expenses throughout the

operating budget.
The question is whether reductions
in these expenses should be credited to
the Legal Office or to the individual
departments.
"We are saving the University
money," said Senior University Coun
sel Tom Fenner. "It was logical to us,
as well as to the liaison team and visit
ing committee, to make our office
responsible for reducing the overall
legal costs to the University."
Other expenses are not even in the
operating budget, such as costs for liti
gating trusts which have been charged
directly to the source of the funds.
Because the outside legal costs are
paid from a variety of places in the
budget, University Budget Director
