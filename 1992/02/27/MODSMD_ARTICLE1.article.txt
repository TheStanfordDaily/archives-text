# Cutting costs?
## Legal Office eyes University's $1M in outside spending 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Is the Legal Office really cutting its
budget, or is it the beneficiary of some
creative accounting?
The answer varies, depending on
whom you ask.
"The Legal Office is not cutting its
budget a single dollar," Classics Prof.
Marsh McCall told the Faculty Senate
two weeks ago. "There are zero budget
reductions in the Legal Office because
outside billings are not in the Legal
Office's budget now."
But faculty and administrators who
have spent months working on the
cuts insist it is not that simple.
Over the last few months, the office's
search for ways to reduce its budget by
19.2 percent has led to the discovery of

$1 million the Univer
sity spends each year
on outside legal costs.
This money is above
and beyond the Legal
Office's budget of more
than $2.5 million.
Although much of
the complex account
ing still has to be fig
ured out, the Legal

Office says that outside legal expenses
will be reduced by having the office
perform those functions itself, and
that the savings should be applied to
the office's target.
When outside counsel has been
hired by the University, the depart
ment requesting legal service has tradi
tionally paid for it, a procedure which
scatters legal expenses throughout the

operating budget.
The question is whether reductions
in these expenses should be credited to
the Legal Office or to the individual
departments.
"We are saving the University
money," said Senior University Coun
sel Tom Fenner. "It was logical to us,
as well as to the liaison team and visit
ing committee, to make our office
responsible for reducing the overall
legal costs to the University."
Other expenses are not even in the
operating budget, such as costs for liti
gating trusts which have been charged
directly to the source of the funds.
Because the outside legal costs are
paid from a variety of places in the
budget, University Budget Director


Warner
Tim Warner said the "real chal
lenge is to figure out all of the
numbers. We are getting a handle
on that now."
The system has "confused a lot
of people and made it difficult to
tally up," agreed Antoinette Addi
son, a financial analyst in Warn
er's office. "At the beginning (of
the budget-reduction process), we
had to go back to all of the cases in
the last four years and just put it
on one piece of paper."
The discovery of $1 million in
outside legal expenses surprised
many people.
"I was quite suspicious original
ly, but now I am absolutely con
vinced that the problem is just
that no one knows how much was
spent in total," said Law Prof.
Robert Weisberg, who is a member
of the Legal Office's budget liaison
team and heads a group of outside
lawyers analyzing the office.
As the Legal Office searched
for a way to meet its target, the $1
million in outside legal expenses
jumped out as an opportunity.
Under the proposal, the Uni
versity will cut funds spent on out
side legal counsel by $423,000 by
making the Legal Office responsi
ble for handling more cases.
Litigation done by University
lawyers is about half as expensive
as services provided by outside
legal counsel, according to both
Addison and Fenner.
"We will save the University
money by shifting resources and
handling a greater volume of litiga
tion in-house," Fenner said. "My
perception is that we have already
got plenty of legal work here.
"We will handle the increased lit
igation volume by reducing our ser
vices to some parts of the Universi
ty, thereby freeing up some legal
personnel for litigation," he added.
The problem now facing Warner
and Addison is how to credit the
reductions to the Legal Office, which
does not currently pay for outside
legal counsel from its own budget.
Warner said he could not yet
provide a "terribly definitive
answer" on the process because
only a "general principle" has
been established, but added that
the goal is "to get a mechanism by
which the general funds are
removed from the Legal Office's

budget so that it will have met its
reduction target."
Because 95 percent of Stan
ford's legal action involves
defenses against lawsuits, it is dif
ficult to predict which depart
ments will require outside legal
counsel in a given year.
"We are trying to figure out
the way to have the right funds
pay for the expenses and track the
accounts," Addison said. "What
we are not going to do is give [the
Legal Office] more money."
Weisberg said the exact
accounting mechanism is not
important. "Our main concern
was to save the University money,
and we recognized the need to do
some reconfiguration," he said.
But McCall said yesterday that
while he "applauds the Legal
Office for figuring out a way to
save the University over $400,000
in the area of legal expenses," the
Legal Office is "not relieved of its
original task" of meeting its bud
get-reduction target.
"The Legal Office has identi
fied $423,000, but it has not been
taken out of its own budget,"
McCall said. "If it is determined
that the services they provide are
too important to be cut, then so
be it. But then officials should
stand up and say it."
Addison and others empha
sized, however, that the cuts are
real and should be credited to the
Legal Office.
"When you look at the whole
picture, there are true savings,"
Addison said. "We are looking at
how to achieve the cuts and make
sure that nobody is worse off."
While Warner acknowledges
that the Legal Office cuts will
involve "difficult accounting pro
cedures," Fenner and Weisberg
suggested that it will be an
extremely complex process.
It is a "classic budgeting prob
lem," Fenner said. The outside
legal costs were "being monitored
on an individual basis. They were
not all paid, however, out of a sin
gle account.
"It would have been much more
logical to have several years ago
created a single budget account for
all outside litigation costs, but
often accounting systems are not
closely examined until a particular
need arises," he added.
Weisberg said the complexity
of the budget "amazes me. It is
absolutely bizarre. . . . The sys
tem is a labyrinth of accounting."
