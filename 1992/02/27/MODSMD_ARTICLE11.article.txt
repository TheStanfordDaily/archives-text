### 
"In the '60s there were a
lot of protests and the stu
dents even started to have
long hair and dirty clothes
— some didn't even wear
clothes. The '70s were the
same. And then in the '80s,
the students started wearing
Levis."
— Milkman Don Kafka, on
how Stanford has changed
during his 37years making
on-campus deliveries for the
Peninsula Creamery. Kafka
said he liked the '50s best,
"when people were clean."
