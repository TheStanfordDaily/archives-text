Harassed students can sue schools
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sexually harassed students may sue
their schools and school officials for monetary damages, the
Supreme Court ruled unanimously yesterday.
The court, in an opinion by Justice Byron R. White, said Congress
intended to let students sue for such compensation when it passed a
law known as Title DC of the Education Amendments of 1972.
The decision is a victory for a former Gwinnett County, Ga.,
high school student who sued over her alleged sexual encounters
with a teacher she said pursued her ardently.
"A damages remedy is available for an action brought to
enforce Title IX," White wrote for the court.
Marcia Greenberg, president of the National Women's Law Cen
ter, hailed the decision as "a major victory for women" that would
"heighten the sensitivity of school officials to what's going on.'
"We're relieved, especially since the Bush administration had
taken the view that no damages were available," she said.
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and
Clarence Thomas concurred in a separate opinion written by Scalia.
The case had attracted additional attention because it was the
first involving alleged sexual harassment to reach the court since
Thomas became a justice.
Councilwoman's paint job stinks
BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) — All Nancy Skinner wanted was an
ecologically correct paint.
But her all-natural, milk-based paint turned sour and the
stench drove the councilwoman out of her home three months ago.
Despite scrubbing and repainting, the house still smelled like old
socks, and Skinner and her daughter are rooming with friends.
"It really knocked you over," concurred paint distributor
Eugene Dunlap.
Skinner, an avid and now somewhat embarrassed environ
mentalist said the mildly rancid smell of the paint got worse after
it was applied during the Thanksgiving holidays.
"It smelled like really bad compost and body odor all mixed up
together," she told the Oakland Tribune this week. "It's like about
20 guys were in a room who hadn't taken showers for weeks."
