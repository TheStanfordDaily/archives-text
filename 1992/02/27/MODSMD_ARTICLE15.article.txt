## Service, not money 
### 
Gov. Clinton offers plan
to repay student debts
through public service

Governor bill clinton
of Arkansas is the presiden
tial candidate who has ad
vanced the most solid plan to
restructure the ailing student
financial aid system.
In Clinton's plan, students
could pay back their college debts
by serving in some form of volun
tary public service.
The plan would be a welcome
addition to the present system,
making it easier for students to
attend college in these recession
ary times. Also, the plan would
channel human resources into pre
viously neglected occupations.
According to Clinton, all poten
tial students could have their educa
tion paid for by the federal govern
ment in the form of student loans.
In return, students could choose
how to pay back this money. They
could pay either with the income
they receive after graduation or
they could pay nothing and serve
their country for a few years in
some form of-public service.
The public service jobs that
Clinton has mentioned in particu
lar are teaching, child care and
police work. For too long now,
these fields have been difficult and
thankless jobs.
For example, there is little
incentive for college graduates to
teach in the areas that need them
the most: tough inner city schools
and poor rural schools.
More often than not, school dis
tricts do not receive enough money
for books and supplies. Administra
tors are out of touch with the latest
methods in teaching, and motivated
teachers interested in experiment
ing confront incredible amounts of
bureaucracy and red tape.
For these reasons, many gradu
ates who do pursue teaching
become disillusioned and burn out

quickly. Many more graduates
never try teaching: under pressure
to pay back their college loans,
recent graduates are forced to
enter a higher-paying professional
field instead.
The Clinton plan would attract
more and better teachers, because
graduates could pay back their col
lege loans through teaching,
rather than being forced into the
corporate world.
In the case of child care, the bene
fits are even more clear. Ever
increasing numbers of households
have two wage earners. Affordable
child care is a must for these families.
Since several businesses cannot
afford to offer services to their
workers, alternatives must be
made available by the government.
The Clinton plan conveniently
solves two problems at once by
supplying much needed workers to
this field and forgiving student
debts in return for the service.
Funding for Clinton's plan
would come from several places.
First of all, Clinton intends to ask
Congress to set up a trust fund to
enable him to extend Pell grants to
more middle class students and to
increase the amount of money
received by the students with the
greatest financial need.
Secondly, Clinton supports over
hauling the student aid program
itself and finding more efficient
ways to give help. One such way is
to eliminate the middlemen, the
banks. According to the General
Accounting Office, this kind of
direct student loan program would
save the government $1.4 billion.
Staff at the Clinton campaign
headquarters hinted that the gov
ernor was considering diverting
some of the money that presently
goes to the defense industry and
reinvesting it in his education pro
gram.
But no matter how it is funded,
it is imperative that a concrete
plan for financing higher educa
tion is put into effect before exor
bitant college costs and inappro
priate cuts in financial aid squeeze
out middle class students.
