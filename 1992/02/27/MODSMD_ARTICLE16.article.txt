Editorial did not present the pro-life perspective

WE ARE WRITING in response to
the editorial of Feb. 24 referring
to the "Abortion Nightmare" of
the 14-year-old Irish rape victim. We are
entirely sympathetic to her plight and
appreciate The Daily drawing attention
to this matter. What we do not appreci
ate is the way the editorial oversimpli
fied the abortion issue and misrepre
sented the pro-life position.
First of all, rape is indisputably a rep
rehensible crime and we believe that it
merits the strongest condemnation. Fur
thermore, when rape results in pregnan
cy, it raises an acknowledged predicament
for those who hold the pro-life stance.
We agree that rape presents one of
the few instances in which abortion
should be permissible, and that ascer
taining the occurrence of rape within the

limited timespan of the victim's preg
nancy is extremely difficult.
There are no easy answers to this
particular dilemma. However, we do not
think that the entire abortion issue
should be reduced to these rare cases
which account for a minute percentage
of all abortions.
The editorial spuriously claims that
"Roe vs. Wade is all that prevents simi
lar tragedies from occurring in this
country." This is simply not true. Most
legislation supported by pro-lifers would
allow for an abortion in this case.
What the pro-life position does stress
is personal responsibility for one's
actions. The rape victim certainly cannot
be held accountable for the actions of a
criminal.
Furthermore, it is implied that all

"political opponents of Roe vs. Wade"
place the entire blame for unwanted
pregnancies on the "mother's mistakes"
and the "woman's bad judgement."
To state the obvious, sexual inter
course involves two individuals, both of
whom are fully responsible for their
actions. Even if birth control is used, the
potential for the creation of life is inte
gral to the act and must be acknowl
edged.
As two people who vehemently oppose
abortion, we uphold the sanctity of the
unborn child's life. The editorial virtual
ly ignores the millions of babies who are
aborted for less compelling reasons than
rape.
The right to determine the future of
one's own body and welfare is indeed
important, but it does not supersede the

most fundamental right, the child's
right to live. The pro-choice argument is
hardly rock solid when viewed from the
perspective of the unborn child.
Finally, the editorial claims that,
"Those who will be most affected by leg
islation banning abortion are those who
have the weakest political voice â€”
teenagers and the poor."
While teenagers and the poor will
undoubtedly be greatly affected, those
who will be most affected are the one
and a half million human beings who
will each year be allowed to live.
We speak on behalf of these unborn
babies who have no political voice at all.
