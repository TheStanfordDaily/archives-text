# The 						U.S. cannot afford to aid Haitian refugees
## 
### 
Whatever the misery caused by the
political repression going on in Haiti, the
economic situation described by Paul
Namphy in his Feb. 21 column preceded
and will continue until an enlightened
government comes to power.
Perhaps if Aristide can be returned to
power things will improve; and to that
end, I'm led to believe, the Organization
of American States (OAS) and the U.S.
support an embargo. However, Namphy
holds only the U.S. responsible for the
refugees' well-being.
Perhaps Namphy should communi
cate to his friends and relatives in Haiti
the real situation in the U.S. Carlos T.
should have read the newspaper in Oak
land when he was there.
On a daily basis in this country inno
cent people are killed, many more lives
are threatened and probably a number
of times a day someone has a gun shoved

into their mouth.
These situations stem from economic
and other problems, not from political
despotism. They are related to the
inability to deal with increasing prob
lems as we move this country toward
Third World status.
The goose that laid the golden egg is
very sick. Times change. Strip the poetry
away and you'll see the huddled masses
thing was inspired by a soon-to-be indus
trial country looking for cheap labor.
Are Haitian refugees trying to get to
other OAS countries? Where is the
responsibility of the other OAS mem
bers? Is it not enough that the U.S.
Coast Guard is kind and rescues people
in distress? Does that obligate the U.S.
to care for these people for the rest of
their lives?
Look at a map. Jamaica is very close.*
Cuba is much closer than the U.S. Mexi
co, an OAS member, is not much far
ther. There are parts of northern South
America that are quite close to Haiti.
If the motivation for the exodus is
truly political rather than economic, any

of these destinations is just as good and
easier to reach than the U.S.
Please, Namphy, appeal to the gov
ernments of these places to pick up and
grant asylum to Haitian refugees before
you impose on one that has already done
a kindness.
