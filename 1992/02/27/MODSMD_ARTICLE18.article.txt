# Daily should distance itself from hateful ads
## 
### 
We are writing to protest the way in
which The Daily printed the Students
for Equal Rights advertisement in last
Friday's issue, an ad that began "David
Duke: Do you love the message, but not
necessarily the messenger?"
To print such an ad, and especially to
print it with no accompanying editorial or
disclaimer expressing your opposition to
such organizations, displays a fundamen
tal insensitivity to the persistent racism

facing people of color in this country.
What people object to about David Duke
is his message â€” one of blatant modern
day racism. And it is his message that the
advertisement states that it supports.
This country is not being invaded and
colonized by illegal Third World aliens,
as the ad suggests. Instead, we have
been forcibly repatriating Haitian politi
cal refugees to a large extent because of
their skin color.
And affirmative action is not merely
"quotas and reverse discrimination." To
say so and to deny it even on principle is
to callously ignore the overt and struc
tural racism and oppression that people
of color and women continue to struggle
against in this country.
In the future, if The Daily wishes to
print such ads and help them propagate
their racism, we would hope that you
would care enough to at least disassoci
ate yourself from their viewpoint.
