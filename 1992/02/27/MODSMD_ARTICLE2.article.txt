# University dealing with Theta Delts
## $11k debt, membership size crucial as fraternity seeks to regain house 
### Leigh Burnside Staff writer 
Officials from the University
and the Theta Delta Chi fraterni
ty have signed a letter of under
standing detailing the criteria
that must be met before the fra
ternity may move back into its
house at 675 Lomita.
The contract says the fraternity
must repay its debt to the Univer
sity, adopt local bylaws and expand
the 20-member fraternity to
include 45 members and pledges.
Meanwhile, fraternity leaders
are planning a meeting tonight in
order to regain their former resi
dence, currently a co-educational
self-op.
The fraternity's main problem
is an outstanding debt of between
$11,000 and $12,000 incurred
last year as a result of having too
few occupants in the house to
cover the rent to the University,
explained Heather Dunn, pro
gram coordinator for the Office of
Student Activities.
She added that the growing
interest on the debt will prove to
be an even greater problem if it is
not taken care of soon.
Because the debt lies with
members no longer attending
Stanford, Dunn suggested the
Theta Delts take the matter to a
collections agency to recover the

money from those alumni.
The fraternity decided to give
up its house last spring, but the
University agreed that the Theta
Delts could re-occupy it if they
reorganize within five years.
According to Theta Delt orga
nizer Marc Fioravanti, a junior,
"The University is committed to
letting us be a fraternity" and has
been "pretty supportive" through
out the whole process.
The fraternity plans to hold an
informational meeting tonight for
those interested in helping with
the reorganization effort.
Fioravanti said the main rea
son for the meeting is "to see
what kind of interest is out there"
and to begin "setting up a system
to be intact for somebody inter
ested in starting a fraternity from
the ground level.
"This is an important opportu
nity to see that the fraternity sys
tem stays strong here at Stanford
and does not slowly disintegrate
by attrition," he added.
Fioravanti said the meeting is
intended more for those who may
be interested in rushing the frater
nity, though he said the members
would welcome help from anyone.
Dunn said that no freshmen
will be allowed to attend since it is
an informational meeting and the
presence of freshmen would consti
tute a violation of pre-Rush rules.
