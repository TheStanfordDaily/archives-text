## Celebrating Greek Week 
### 
ONCE UPON A TIME I was a frat
dick. Well, maybe not quite a dick,
but I was a member of the Beta
Theta Pi Fraternity, Inc. During my
frosh year a gaggle of Branner guys
decided we'd skip the Draw and try to
take over a Row house. I imagined that
over time we were going to transform a
mostly white, totally male, rotting old
dinosaur-of-a-frat into the coed, multira
cial, social center of campus.
Like all great revolutions, it failed mis
erably.
I "pledged" with about 20 other frosh
— though it wasn't really pledging
because everyone was accepted. It was
our understanding that when we entered
the house there would only be six ancient
Betas in a house of 40. We pretty much
thought the house was going to be ours.
What we didn't realize was that those six
old Betas would be the president, trea
surer, house manager, etc. — the people
who held the power in the house.
For the first quarter and a half or so, I
and a couple of the other guys pushed for
changes in the house to no avail. As it
turns out, few other men were seriously
interested in redefining Betas as I had
envisioned — multiracial and inclusive of
women and gay people.
Through most of the goofy and volun
tary initiation rituals, people remained
loyal to the traditions. It wasn't until the
mid-year "Hell Week" initiation that peo

pie's views started to shift. At the grand
finale, a "special surprise" planned by a
group of alumni Betas proved too much
even for the apathetic.
A stripper had been hired by the alums
and for several hours she entertained 30
howling men by dancing, removing her
clothes and picking $20 bills out of their
mouths with her vagina. My roommate and
I left before it began, astounded and revolt
ed that this was happening in our house.
Over the course of the following days,
all hell broke loose and I think Hell Week
truly began — though surely not as the
older Betas had planned. A third of the
house, most of whom had previously been
conservative about change, now wanted
action. They were sufficiently disgusted
by the hiring of the stripper and her
treatment by their peers that they also
wanted the house transformed.
After meeting a couple of times, we
demanded that the president resign to
take responsibility for the incident that
happened under his watch. We demanded
that the house break all ties with the
national organization and prepare to
become a coed self-op or co-op.
Finally, after too many arguments, too
many votes and too little change, many of
us depledged, gave up four years of guar
anteed housing and prepared to return to
the Draw. Part of what had attracted me
to Betas was the potential to build some
thing new; I just hadn't comprehended

'She entertained
30 howling
men by picking
$20 bills out
of their
mouths with
her vagina.'

how hard it would be to dismantle the old
structure first.
Though the stripper incident was cer
tainly a breaking point in my year at
Betas, it was by no means the only repug
nant behavior I encountered in my year
there. Moreover, I know that other
housed frats engaged in exactly the same
behavior, not to mention some that were
considerably worse.
Betas was mild by frat standards. The
kind of sexism and homophobia displayed
by some members was encouraged by the
frat system itself, with its all-male living
quarters and traditions like the Thurs
day Bar Nights of "beer and sorority
chicks." There was too much history to
be derailed in one year.
Though there are some positive mem
ories of Betas, I'm thankful to be out.
Now that it's Greek Week at Stanford all
those lettered sweatshirts will come out
of the dressers to remind the rest of us
that some people still take pride in their
group affiliations. Having seen some of
Greek life at the front line, however. . .

Though the stripper incident was cer
tainly a breaking point in my year at
Betas, it was by no means the only repug
nant behavior I encountered in my year
there. Moreover, I know that other
housed frats engaged in exactly the same
behavior, not to mention some that were
considerably worse.
Betas was mild by frat standards. The
kind of sexism and homophobia displayed
by some members was encouraged by the
frat system itself, with its all-male living
quarters and traditions like the Thurs
day Bar Nights of "beer and sorority
chicks." There was too much history to
be derailed in one year.
Though there are some positive mem
ories of Betas, I'm thankful to be out.
