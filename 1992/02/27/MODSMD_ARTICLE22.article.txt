## Goodenbour escapes ghosts of Cards past 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
Junior Molly Goodenbour
learned how to play guard from
the best. When she was a fresh
man, she played against two Ail-
Americans in practice. But while
that pair keyed her development,
they also set a standard so high
that the junior has struggled to
establish herself as an individual
free from comparisons to her pre
decessors.
With all the obstacles that
come from playing on a team
which competes on the highest
level of women's basketball,
Goodenbour ranks creating a per
sonal identity as her greatest
challenge so far:
"Trying to come into my own,"
she says, "trying to get out from
under the shadow of Jennifer
(Azzi) and Sonja (Henning), try
ing to show that I can be the point
guard of this team at the level
we've been at for the past two
years.
"I have struggled under the
weight of that sometimes, but it's
been fun this year. I've enjoyed
playing this year, and I think
things are coming around, slowly
but surely."
Stanford women's basketball
coach Tara VanDerveer acknowl
edges the difficulty of Gooden
bour's situation, but also knows
that in the final analysis exterior
expectations are irrelevant.
"She's stepping into some very
big shoes," VanDerveer says.
"But this is something from the
beginning where I've really tried
to just say, you know, 'This is
Molly.' She shouldn't be worried
about Sonja and Jennifer; she
should just concentrate on doing
what she needs to do."
Goodenbour agrees, even
though she still feels somewhat
haunted by the ghosts of Henning
and Azzi. She relishes the oppor
tunity to prove herself. "It was
hard to wait, but now I'm getting
my chance. It's been two years,
but I feel like it's my turn now; I
have the opportunity and I just
have to grab it. I feel like it's time.
It's now or never."

Although she is the most expe
rienced guard on the team and
has started all year — mostly at
the point — Goodenbour has con
tinued to try to improve her play
so that she can cash in on her
opportunity.
"I think I've improved my abil
ity to coordinate the offense, to do
my thing and enable other people
to do their thing, too. In the past
I concentrated on what I have to
be able to do. This year it's more
on what we need to do. It comes
with being the point guard....
"Before, if I was out there I
was just concentrating on what I
needed to do to stay out there. It's
different now because I'm on the
floor more and I feel like I have
more of an impact on what's
going to happen in the game than
I have in the past."
VanDerveer likes the way
Goodenbour's skills fit Stanford's
high-gear offense. "Probably her
biggest strength is her condition
ing," VanDerveer says. "Where a
lot of people get tired, she doesn't;
she's able to keep going. And
especially for the style of basket
ball we play, her conditioning is a
real plus for her because we're
running all the time... .
"She's a lot more effective
when we're running than when
we're trying to play set-up. I don't
think she'd be really happy on a
team that walks the ball up the
floor and has to run a set offense,
nor do I think that's her strength.
Although she really has improved
on that.
"She really has improved
tremendously, and I think she
has a long way to go."
At 6 p.m. tonight against Ari
zona State, Goodenbour and her
cohorts will have the chance to
show how much they have
improved against a defense which
has given the Cardinal fits this
season—the full-court press.
"That's been a problem," Van-
Derveer admits. "That's some
thing our team has to work on.
That's not just Molly's job."
Goodenbour says that Stan
ford's inability to break the press


Molly Goodenbour, Stanford's star point guard. Goodenbour has battled the reputa
tions of past Cardinal point guard All-Americans Jennifer Azzi and Sonja Henning, but
has come into her own this season.
