# Volleyballers resurge in '92
## 
### 
ON THE ONE HAND, the Cardinal men's
volleyball team is an experienced squad
loaded with talent, and shouldn't be sur
prising anyone with their fabulous 10-2 start
and No. 2 national ranking. On the other hand,
we need only rewind the clock 11 months to find
the same team mired in a 10-match league losing

streak, on
their way to
becoming
one of the
conference's
four cellar
dwellers that
didn't even
reach the
post-season

tournament.
In that respect, the play of the Stanford
spikers has been quite a surprise indeed.
To call the Cardinal's 1991 season — in
which they lost 11 out of their last 12 league
matches and 12 out of 15 overall — a horrid
one might be an understatement. Early in the
season the club climbed to a national top-five
ranking. But by the end of the year, the only
reason they were still in the polls was that out
side of California men's collegiate volleyball is
about as oft-played as cricket.
Yet Stanford now stands with defending
national champion Long Beach State at the top
of the volleyball world. They lead the Wilson
division with an 8-1 mark in Western Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association play. Their
sights are legitimately set on not only reaching
the WIVA post-season tournament and then
the Final Four, but on bringing home the
national championship.
But hold on a second. Except for the addi
tion outside hitter Ryan Moos, this year's Car
dinal team looks a lot like the one who suffered
through nine weeks of WIVA futility. Also
most of the country's top volleyball schools
were about as young as Stanford was last sea
son, and outside of USC's all-world hitter
Brian Ivie, most of the sport's top players have
returned. So what has changed?
Says second-year coach Ruben Nieves, it's a
re-emphasis on the "team concept" (which
hopefully means no more free balls falling to
the floor in the midst of four silent would-be
passers), and, of course, experience.
"I don't see us as a young team anymore.
We have Duncan (Blackman) who is a true
