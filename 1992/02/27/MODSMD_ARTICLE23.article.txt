# Volleyballers resurge in '92
## 
### 
ON THE ONE HAND, the Cardinal men's
volleyball team is an experienced squad
loaded with talent, and shouldn't be sur
prising anyone with their fabulous 10-2 start
and No. 2 national ranking. On the other hand,
we need only rewind the clock 11 months to find
the same team mired in a 10-match league losing

streak, on
their way to
becoming
one of the
conference's
four cellar
dwellers that
didn't even
reach the
post-season

tournament.
In that respect, the play of the Stanford
spikers has been quite a surprise indeed.
To call the Cardinal's 1991 season — in
which they lost 11 out of their last 12 league
matches and 12 out of 15 overall — a horrid
one might be an understatement. Early in the
season the club climbed to a national top-five
ranking. But by the end of the year, the only
reason they were still in the polls was that out
side of California men's collegiate volleyball is
about as oft-played as cricket.
Yet Stanford now stands with defending
national champion Long Beach State at the top
of the volleyball world. They lead the Wilson
division with an 8-1 mark in Western Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association play. Their
sights are legitimately set on not only reaching
the WIVA post-season tournament and then
the Final Four, but on bringing home the
national championship.
But hold on a second. Except for the addi
tion outside hitter Ryan Moos, this year's Car
dinal team looks a lot like the one who suffered
through nine weeks of WIVA futility. Also
most of the country's top volleyball schools
were about as young as Stanford was last sea
son, and outside of USC's all-world hitter
Brian Ivie, most of the sport's top players have
returned. So what has changed?
Says second-year coach Ruben Nieves, it's a
re-emphasis on the "team concept" (which
hopefully means no more free balls falling to
the floor in the midst of four silent would-be
passers), and, of course, experience.
"I don't see us as a young team anymore.
We have Duncan (Blackman) who is a true


Kevin
Jeffery
senior, we have five more seniors
with one year of eligibility left play
ing important roles for us. Those
guys are veterans at this point...
they've made the transition. And
our two sophomores, Canyon
(Ceman) and Joe (Burghardt),
have a good solid year under their
belt," Nieves said.
"I think the main difference
from last season is the overall
maturity of the team.. .especially
(kills leader) Dave Goss," echoed
junior outside hitter Bob Hillman.
"He's just gotten better every
year, he's matured to the point
where he's undoubtedly one of the
top players in the league. He's
been carrying a huge load for us,
which in the past few years maybe
he wasn't quite able to do."
In fact, Goss' dramatic improve
ment may as well as anything
explain the change in Cardinal for
tune. Earlier this year, in a key
five-game win at UCLA, he broke
the NCAA record for kills in a
match with 55. His attacking per
centage is currently .355 (63 points
higher than last season) and he is
on pace to finish the year with an
astronomical 650 kills (compared
to last season's 444).
But Goss is quick to give team
mates credit for his stellar indi
vidual totals, as well he should.
Sophomore setter Ceman is aver
aging over 18 assists per game
and is already recognized as one
the nation's top play makers.
Ryan Moos (back from a year in
Japan) earned a starting role at

outside hitter and has solidified
the offense with his steady pass
ing. And Blackman, who played
with Ceman on the U.S. team in
the World University and Pan Am
Games, is hitting .399 with 186
kills and leads the team with 15
aces.
If statistics don't tell the story
of Stanford's turnaround, its
clutch play in pressure situations
— on the road and in five-game
matches — must. This year the
Cardinal is unbeaten in four five
game contests, including wins on
back-to-back nights at UCLA
(down 0-2) and USC (down 1-2).
In '91 Stanford would have quali
fied for post-season play if they
had not been shut out in their
four five-game WTVA matches.
Probably the most impressive
aspect of the Cardinal spikers' 10-
2 mark is that they have had the
benefit of only two home matches.
While they flailed to a 1-6 league
road record last season, their cur
rent division-leading WIVA record
includes six wins in seven road
matches.
Not surprisingly, a rejuvenat
ed confidence has found its way
back into the Cardinal camp.
"We've established ourselves as
one of the top two teams in the
nation ... at this point we deserve
to be ranked right where we are,"
said Nieves. And as Hillman pro
claims, winning the NCAA title is
"absolutely a realistic goal."
Even so, many are still inclined
to call the Cardinal this year's
Cinderella. They may not agree
with the characterization, but if
the slipper fits they'll be glad to
wear it . . . all the way to the
national championship.
