## Willens nails rivals with service return 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
When Stanford women's ten
nis coach Frank Brennan says
Heather Willens really knows
how to hammer, he's not talking
about carpentry.
The topic is Willens' pounding
return of serve, a "Can't Touch
This" stroke which is the founda
tion of her game and a major reason
she's ranked No. 5 in the country.
"For me it is the difference in a
match. Without my return I don't
think I'd be good at all," Willens
said. "I can tell when I'm not
returning well. I don't set up
points so I'm always running
around instead of getting on top
of fmy opponents]."
But when Willens nails the
return, she wins matches. "It's
her way of stepping up and saying,
'Hey, give me ywir best serve and
I'm going to hit it right back twice
as hard as it came to me," Bren
nan said. "It freezes [servers] on
their way in — they're afraid to
serve and volley."
The shot is also effective
against baseliners. "I take it earli
er than most people. As a result, I
can get better angles (on the
return)," Willens said. She can
pull opponents wide, opening the
court for a winner.
"They expect it to come back to
the baseline, so [the return] can
either be a clean winner or set up
a winner for me," Willens said.
"That's what is so good about it
— it works against everyone."
By taking the ball early, hitting

it as it's rising from the court, she
gives adversaries less time to pre
pare for the shot. The ball comes
back before her opponent is ready
for it.
"She just shortens the distance
between her and her opponent,"
Brennan said.
Willens' return also makes her
a formidable doubles player. "In
doubles, besides the serve, Ithe
return J is the most important
shot," she said. "I'm not a great
doubles player, but if I have a

partner who can poach off my
return, we'll be a good team."
She has that kind of partner in
Laxmi Poruri. The Cardinal
sophomore is ready at net to cut
across the middle and pick off a
weak reply.
"Popeye (Poruri) knows what's
going to happen. [The return's]
going to go 100 m.p.h. at the serv
er's feet. That girl's going to pop
it up and Popeye is there to take
it," Brennan said.
Attacking the serve not only
puts opponents on the defensive,
but also demoralizes them. "The
girl puts in a pretty good serve
and it comes right back at her
feet. She volleys up and there's
Popeye to knock her partner's
head off," Brennan said.
The duo is able to play the
return game very aggressively,
reducing points to what Willens
calls two-shot doubles, "just a
return and a poach." The strategy
has worked. Willens and Poruri
are the third-ranked tandem in
the nation and are undefeated in
dual matches this season, their

first year as partners.
But their record doesn't mean
that teams haven't tried to defend
Willens' return. Because her back
hand cros3court is her best shot,
opponents try to take that away
by playing in the I-formation. The
server's net man straddles the
center service line rather than
cover the down-the-line option.
After the serve, the net man
moves either left or right to cut
off a return, with the server
breaking the opposite way. The
opponents hope that, with the net
man covering crosscourt, Willens
is forced to hit down the line.
But even that fails. Brennan
said that Willens' down-the-line
return is strong enough to thwart
the I-formation.
"I honestly feel the [net man]

could stand in the middle and
they could serve to her and she
could say, 'I'm going down the
line on this one,' and the [net
man] still couldn't cover it,"
Brennan said. "She hits it that
hard and that accurately."
For several reasons, Willens'
return is even more potent in
doubles than singles. In the who
ever-controls-the-net-wins world
of doubles, the server almost
always comes in, giving Willens a
better target.
"Also, she already has a ham
mer in position at net and cocked
— that's Popeye," Brennan said.
"She hits the return with such
force that she throws herself
around a bit. (In singles) she's not
in the best position to come in and
put the next shot away. Whereas
(in doubles) she can do that and
gather herself and cut the other
way because she knows Popeye is
crossing. So it's really a double
whammy," Brennan said.
