# Hoops looks to crowd for help
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
It's been three years since bas
ketball coach Mike Montgomery
had to exhort the Maples Pavilion
crowd to calm down. Now he'd
like to rescind the request.
Energized by Stanford's first
NCAA Tournament team in 47
years, students disrupted sever
al games by shaking the floor
and going berserk in the stands.
Students stood for the entire 40
minutes and drew comparison
to the Cameron Crazies of
Duke.
Recently however, Meyer Libraiy
has been louder than Maples.
Although referees threatened
Montgomery with a technical if
he didn't make the students stop
bouncing on the floor, Stanford
was 13-0 at home in 1988-89 and
finished with a No. 13 national
ranking. In an 83-78 upset of
No. 7 Arizona, student enthusi
asm helped the team overcome a
21-4 deficit and distract Wildcat
free throw shooters down the
stretch.

It may have looked silly, but it
worked.
With Stanford (14-8, 6-6 in
the Pacific 10 Conference) on
the bubble for a third-ever
NCAA Tournament berth,
Montgomery is looking to the
student body for a similar lift.
The Cardinal has four home
games left and needs to win all
four to assure a tournament
invitation. Washington visits
Maples Pavilion tonight at 7:30
p.m., followed by Washington
State Sunday at 3 p.m.
"In order to get into a competi
tive situation, a postseason situa
tion, that takes everything — all
of our energies," said Mont
gomery. "Then we might be able
to build to the next level. We can't
do it with part-time help."
"I think the kids would
respond to to some help right now
(from the fans)," he said. "We're
trying to accomplish this thing
together."
Stanford's final four home
opponents — Washington, Wash
ington State, Oregon and Oregon
State — are all beneath the Cardi

nal in the Pac-10 standings and
have traditionally been poor
draws. Nevertheless, they shape
up as Stanford's four most impor
tant games of the year.
"We have to win at home. We
have to win these games," said
Montgomery. "There's no more
margin for error."
Stanford went 3-1 on the road
in the Northwest, but will need a
home sweep to fend off Arizona
State (6-6), Washington State (6-
7) and Oregon State (4-8) for
fourth place in the conference.
The Cardinal plays at Arizona
State and Arizona next week.
Stanford fans have been
dynamic for Arizona, UCLA and
California the past few seasons,
but sedate for the rest of the
Pac-10. At the last home game
Montgomery yelled to the
comatose crowd, "Are you alive?"
while his Cardinal pounded Ari
zona State.
Stanford is 8-3 at home this
year, with all three losses coming
against top 15 teams. The past
five years Stanford has the third
best home record (68-16) in the
Pac-10, behind Arizona (85-6)
and UCLA (79-15). But Mont
gomery is concerned that with the
bottom of the Pac-10 visiting, the
Cardinal and fans may be compla
cent.
"We need to support the kids
when they need the support. And
we still have a chance to reach
some goals this year. (But) if
we're only going to support the
basketball team in a champi
onship environment, then we've
got a problem," he said.
