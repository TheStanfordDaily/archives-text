Cycling: The Stanford cycling team's first race of
the season took place at UC-Davis on Sunday,
February 15. The two events, the Sheep Barn Indi
vidual Time Trial and the High Solids Bio-Gassifi
cation Project Team Time Trial (TTT), followed
the same course. Despite some miserable weather
conditions, Stanford took first place in the individ
ual meet, scoring 242 points to runner-up Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo's 178. UC-Davis finished with 175
points, while California came in fourth with 168.
Bob Myers led Stanford men in the event, finishing
second by a scant six seconds in the men's A race
despite stopping to fix his wheel during the compe
tition. Nicole Calakos and Martina Lauchengco
took first and second, respectively, in the women's
"B" race. The men's "D" team dusted the field by
taking seven of the nine scoring places in the event.

In team competition, both the women's "A"
and the men's "A" TTT squads finished second in
their categories. Cal Poly's strong showing in the
men's "A" and "B" competitions allowed them to
take first place in the TTT race, with the Cardinal
taking second over California.
The 1-2 finish in the first two races of the season
represents Stanford's best start in several years.
Coach Art Walker is optimistic that the team will
go into Western Collegiate Cycling Conference
championships undefeated with eight wins.
Men's volleyball: Action from last night's Stan
ford-California match at Berkeley took place too
late for this edition of the Daily. No. 2 Stanford
resumes play Monday at home at 7:30 p.m.
against Cal State-Northridge.
