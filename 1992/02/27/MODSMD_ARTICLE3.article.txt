# 4 groups denied spot on fee-request ballot
## 36 others on after ASSU Senate vote 
### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate decided late
Tuesday night which campus
groups vying for special fee fund
ing will be automatically placed
on April's elections ballot.
Of the 40 organizations voted on,
the Coffee House Concert Series,
the Concert Network, The Daily
and the Stanford-Novosibirsk
Exchange — formerly the Stanford-
Soviet Exchange Program — were
denied placement on the ballot.
The Concert Network and The
Daily can override the decision by
gathering signatures from 10 per
cent of the student body.
Because it has not been on the
ballot before, the Coffee House
Concert Series needs signatures
from 20 percent of students. The
Stanford-Novosibirsk Exchange is
asking for a fee increase of more
than 15 percent, so it must also
obtain signatures from 20 percent
of the students.
The Coffee House Concert
Series, which brings live music to

the Coffee House twice a week,
asked for approximately $15,000.
Senator Doug Bone, a graduate
student, expressed disapproval of
this fee. "I urge you to defeat
this," he said. "What this is, is
Tresidder using funds to put on
CoHo projects."
ASSU Financial Manager Mike
Risch also asked senators to
defeat the proposal. "Please vote
it down," he said. "It smells like
the University."
The senate voted unanimously
against placing the request on the
ballot.
Coffee House Concert Series
organizers could not be reached
for comment last night.
The Concert Network request
ed $37,500 to "enrich the cultur
al, social and educational life of
the University" through concerts
and entertainment events,
according to their application.
Last year, the group sponsored
events including a concert by
EMF and a comedy presentation
by Emo Phillips.
Senators were somewhat divid
ed on this proposal. Risch argued,
"I think that, in general, the Con
cert Network is a good thing pro
viding musical diversity to this
campus."
Deputy Chair Neil Crellin,
however, was not so convinced.
"This organization just gets a
lot of money, loses money on pro
jects and then puts it back into
the group. It is sort of a dubious
operation at best," he said.
The request for placement on the
ballot failed on an undivided voice
vote. Concert Network officials
could not be reached for comment.
The Daily, which requested
$55,775, failed to have its request
placed on the ballot in an 8-9
vote, with one abstention. Senate
Chair Kevin Warsh, a senior, said
most senators believe that The
Daily will be able to collect signa
tures from 10 percent of the stu
dent body and that the debate
was more "a matter of principle."
Organizations which are self
supporting should not receive
student funds, he said.
But according to Daily Busi
ness Manager Michael Londgren,
"Although The Daily does an
excellent job covering most of its
costs through advertising sales,
we are still not able to provide the
Daily free of charge to students."

He likened the fee to a sub
scription rate, which he said is
the equivalent of $4.28 per stu
dent per year.
The Novosibirsk program,
which requested over $14,000 to
send Stanford students to the for
mer Soviet Union and host Soviet
students here, was voted down 6-
7.
Coordinator Adele Cooper said
the bulk of the funds requested
would have paid the airfares of
visiting Russian students. The
exchange students pay for part of
the trip themselves, Cooper said,
but cannot pay for $400 plane
tickets because the airlines accept
only western currencies.
Cooper said the group did not
receive a senate recommendation
last year and had to collect stu
dent signatures to be placed on
the ballot then.
The group's request was suc
cessful in the general election,
and Cooper said she hopes it will
be approved again.
If the exchange did not receive
funding it would cause a "big
problem" for next year's
exchange students, she said.
In speaking out against the
group's fee request, Bone said the
program is "not educational."
"Sure, it is of some benefit to
Stanford," he said. "But it mostly
benefits people in Novosibirsk."
Other proposals which
sparked debate but were eventu
ally passed included the Women's
Center Collective; the Solar Car
Project; OASIS, an Arab-Ameri

can organization; and the Free
Aerobics Program.
Graduate Senator Brian
Flachs said he found it difficult to
grant nearly $30,000 to the Solar
Car Project, which allows 30 stu
dents to create a solar-powered
mode of transportation for com
petition in in two national races.
"Here we have $30,000 being
spent on what is essentially 30
people in the group," he said.
"It's just not useful on campus."
Mark Scheeff, co-coordinator
of the project, said he believed
that the project is indeed very
useful on campus. "Most people
have heard of the Solar Car Pro
ject and have therefore learned
from it. Here we are creating
environmentally friendly trans
portation," he said.
The Women's Center Collective
had a problem because it never
interviewed with Appropriations
Committee Chair Peter Thiel.
Thiel maintained that the
group should have known inter
views were taking place last week.
"People have got to under
stand that they have to arrange
for an interview," he said.
But Jenn Pearson, a represen
tative from the Women's Center,
said no one ever reached her for
an interview.
The fee eventually passed and
a $3,670 request will be placed on
the ballot.
Of the 40 organizations up for
funding, representatives from 11
appeared to answer questions or
speak on behalf of their groups.

Senator Doug Bone, a graduate
student, expressed disapproval of
this fee. "I urge you to defeat
this," he said. "What this is, is
Tresidder using funds to put on
CoHo projects."
ASSU Financial Manager Mike
Risch also asked senators to
defeat the proposal. "Please vote
it down," he said. "It smells like
the University."
The senate voted unanimously
against placing the request on the
ballot.
Coffee House Concert Series
organizers could not be reached
for comment last night.
The Concert Network request
ed $37,500 to "enrich the cultur
al, social and educational life of
the University" through concerts
and entertainment events,
according to their application.
Last year, the group sponsored
events including a concert by
EMF and a comedy presentation
by Emo Phillips.
Senators were somewhat divid
ed on this proposal. Risch argued,
"I think that, in general, the Con
cert Network is a good thing pro
viding musical diversity to this
campus."
Deputy Chair Neil Crellin,
however, was not so convinced.
"This organization just gets a
lot of money, loses money on pro
jects and then puts it back into
the group. It is sort of a dubious
operation at best," he said.
The request for placement on the
ballot failed on an undivided voice
vote. Concert Network officials
could not be reached for comment.
The Daily, which requested
$55,775, failed to have its request
placed on the ballot in an 8-9
vote, with one abstention. Senate
Chair Kevin Warsh, a senior, said
most senators believe that The
Daily will be able to collect signa
tures from 10 percent of the stu
dent body and that the debate
was more "a matter of principle."
Organizations which are self
supporting should not receive
student funds, he said.
But according to Daily Busi
ness Manager Michael Londgren,
"Although The Daily does an
excellent job covering most of its
costs through advertising sales,
we are still not able to provide the
Daily free of charge to students."

He likened the fee to a sub
scription rate, which he said is
the equivalent of $4.28 per stu
dent per year.
The Novosibirsk program,
which requested over $14,000 to
send Stanford students to the for
mer Soviet Union and host Soviet
students here, was voted down 6-
7.
Coordinator Adele Cooper said
the bulk of the funds requested
would have paid the airfares of
visiting Russian students. The
exchange students pay for part of
the trip themselves, Cooper said,
but cannot pay for $400 plane
tickets because the airlines accept
only western currencies.
Cooper said the group did not
receive a senate recommendation
last year and had to collect stu
dent signatures to be placed on
the ballot then.
The group's request was suc
cessful in the general election,
and Cooper said she hopes it will
be approved again.
If the exchange did not receive
funding it would cause a "big
problem" for next year's
exchange students, she said.
In speaking out against the
group's fee request, Bone said the
program is "not educational."
"Sure, it is of some benefit to
Stanford," he said. "But it mostly
benefits people in Novosibirsk."
Other proposals which
sparked debate but were eventu
ally passed included the Women's
Center Collective; the Solar Car
Project; OASIS, an Arab-Ameri

can organization; and the Free
Aerobics Program.
Graduate Senator Brian
Flachs said he found it difficult to
grant nearly $30,000 to the Solar
Car Project, which allows 30 stu
dents to create a solar-powered
mode of transportation for com
petition in in two national races.
"Here we have $30,000 being
spent on what is essentially 30
people in the group," he said.
"It's just not useful on campus."
Mark Scheeff, co-coordinator
of the project, said he believed
that the project is indeed very
useful on campus. "Most people
have heard of the Solar Car Pro
ject and have therefore learned
from it. Here we are creating
environmentally friendly trans
portation," he said.
The Women's Center Collective
had a problem because it never
interviewed with Appropriations
Committee Chair Peter Thiel.
Thiel maintained that the
group should have known inter
views were taking place last week.
"People have got to under
stand that they have to arrange
for an interview," he said.
But Jenn Pearson, a represen
tative from the Women's Center,
said no one ever reached her for
an interview.
The fee eventually passed and
a $3,670 request will be placed on
the ballot.
Of the 40 organizations up for
funding, representatives from 11
appeared to answer questions or
speak on behalf of their groups.

For 37 years, Don Kafka has loaded up his butter-colored Peninsu
la Creamery truck and delivered milk, butter and cheeses all over
campus. What's changed in that time? "Stanford has grown into a
city since then," he says.
The ASSU Senate decided late
Tuesday night which campus
groups vying for special fee fund
ing will be automatically placed
on April's elections ballot.
Of the 40 organizations voted on,
the Coffee House Concert Series,
the Concert Network, The Daily
and the Stanford-Novosibirsk
Exchange — formerly the Stanford-
Soviet Exchange Program — were
denied placement on the ballot.
The Concert Network and The
Daily can override the decision by
gathering signatures from 10 per
cent of the student body.
Because it has not been on the
ballot before, the Coffee House
Concert Series needs signatures
from 20 percent of students. The
Stanford-Novosibirsk Exchange is
asking for a fee increase of more
than 15 percent, so it must also
obtain signatures from 20 percent
of the students.
The Coffee House Concert
Series, which brings live music to

the Coffee House twice a week,
asked for approximately $15,000.
Senator Doug Bone, a graduate

this fee. "I urge you to defeat
