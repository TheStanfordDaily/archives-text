## 36 others on after ASSU Senate vote 
### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate decided late
Tuesday night which campus
groups vying for special fee fund
ing will be automatically placed
on April's elections ballot.
Of the 40 organizations voted on,
the Coffee House Concert Series,
the Concert Network, The Daily
and the Stanford-Novosibirsk
Exchange — formerly the Stanford-
Soviet Exchange Program — were
denied placement on the ballot.
The Concert Network and The
Daily can override the decision by
gathering signatures from 10 per
cent of the student body.
Because it has not been on the
ballot before, the Coffee House
Concert Series needs signatures
from 20 percent of students. The
Stanford-Novosibirsk Exchange is
asking for a fee increase of more
than 15 percent, so it must also
obtain signatures from 20 percent
of the students.
The Coffee House Concert
Series, which brings live music to

the Coffee House twice a week,
asked for approximately $15,000.
Senator Doug Bone, a graduate
student, expressed disapproval of
this fee. "I urge you to defeat
this," he said. "What this is, is
Tresidder using funds to put on
CoHo projects."
ASSU Financial Manager Mike
Risch also asked senators to
defeat the proposal. "Please vote
it down," he said. "It smells like
the University."
The senate voted unanimously
against placing the request on the
ballot.
Coffee House Concert Series
organizers could not be reached
for comment last night.
The Concert Network request
ed $37,500 to "enrich the cultur
al, social and educational life of
the University" through concerts
and entertainment events,
according to their application.
Last year, the group sponsored
events including a concert by
EMF and a comedy presentation
