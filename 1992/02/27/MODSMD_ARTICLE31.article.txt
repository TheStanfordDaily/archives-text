A joint effort by the Stanford,
Palo Alto and Menlo Park police
nabbed three men who allegedly
burgled cars in the Governor's 1 *
Corner parking lot early Tuesday
morning, according to Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Two 20-year-olds and a minor
were arrested on charges of
breaking into three automobiles
and stealing stereo equipment.
Jake Rin of East Palo Alto,
Jeremy Salcedo of Menlo Park
and the minor were charged with
possession of stolen property,
conspiracy, possession of burglary
tools, evading arrest and petty
theft. A fourth suspect is still at
large.
According to Niemeyer, a stu

dent called police at 2:30 a.m.
Tuesday to report suspicious
behavior in the dormitory parking
complex.
"The suspects were breaking
into the cars with rocks," said
Niemeyer. "They were all wearing
gloves and dark clothing. One
even had a fanny pack with tools
to break in with."
When police arrived, the sus
pects fled the scene and darted
into nearby fields, Niemeyer said.
Police dispatched a canine unit
but were unable to find the sus
pects.
However, the suspects had left
their own car — ironically
equipped with an alarm — at the
scene of the alleged crime,
Niemeyer said, and police traced
the car to its owner's address.
The suspects escaped to a

Menlo Park cemetery where they
phoned an unsuspecting friend
and told him they had been drink
ing and needed rides home,
Niemeyer said.
The police greeted the suspects
as the unidentified driver
attempted to drop one of them off.
Rin, Salcedo and the minor admit
ted to stealing assorted audio
equipment and a variety of music
tapes, according to Niemeyer.
Rin and Salcedo are being held
at North County Jail; the minor
was sent to Juvenile Hall. The
unsuspecting chauffeur was
released.
Niemeyer called the arrests a
"group effort" by the area's police
forces.
"It's really important that we
all work together for the common
good," he said.
