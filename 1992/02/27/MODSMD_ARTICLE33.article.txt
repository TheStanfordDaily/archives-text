# INTERMISSION
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY. Local breweries top beechwood aging gimmick.

In a beer-ad mirage, just
about anything would go down
all right. But buxom blondes
never strip down to string bikinis
when I twist the cap off — and
the beer is still lousy.
Does it get any better than
this? Why ask why, you ask.
Because it's high time the king of
beers abdicated.
Fortunately, there is a huge
disparity between what is highly
advertised and what is good,
especially here in the Bay Area.
Small beer pubs and microbrew
eries abound on the local land
scape, producing some fantastic
beers. It does get better than the
huge American brands. In fact,
much better.
Gordon-Biersch, a beer pub
right in downtown Palo Alto,
makes German-style lagers, pri
marily for restaurant consump
tion. You can't find their beer in
the store yet, but they're working
on it.
Watching brewmaster Mike
Ferguson monitor the brewing,
move hoses and switch levers, it
felt good to know that people still
do things like this the old-fash
ioned way — by hand.
It was a stark contrast to the
massive, completely automated
and geared-for-volume Budweiser
factory I had toured this past sum
mer. "Beechwood aging" turned
out to be throwing some wood
chips into the fermenting tanks.
And the Clydesdales are just for
show; they don't really use them.
I tasted three Gordon-Biersch
beers: an Export, a Marzen and a
Dopleboch. The Export is a light

Pilsener, the Marzen is a little
darker and the Dopleboch is a
heavy dark beer Gordon-Biersch
makes during the winter.
It's very flavorful, but you
wouldn't want to drink it if you
had anything more strenuous to
do than getting up from the

use them.

table. Generally the darker the
beer is, the stronger its flavor
and the higher its alcohol con
tent.
If you don't want to go out to
have a decent beer, you can pick
up one of Anchor Steam's beers
in the local store. They make a
variety of ales and lagers. Anchor
Steam Beer, Liberty Ale and
Anchor Porter are three of the
more popular bottled varieties.
Anchor Steam brews on a
larger scale than a brew pub like
Gordon-Biersch. However, it is
still an intimate outfit. Its pro
duction is about 45,000 barrels
per year (about a day's produc
tion for Budweiser).
The company can afford to
stay small because it is owned by
Fritz Maytag, a Stanford alum
nus (think laundry). His first
commitment is to brew a great
beer for people who enjoy great
beers. For this brewery, the rest
has taken care of itself.

offers a brewery like Anchor
Steam the latitude to focus on
brewing distinctive beers, and to

take some chances. For example,
Anchor Steam brews a wheat
based ale. According to them,
when they started brewing this
ale back in 1984, they were the
first American company to do so
in 60 years.
Both Anchor Steam and Gor

don-Biersch go back to the basics,
using only four ingredients in
their beer: malt barley, yeast,
hops and water (no preservatives
or added chemicals). They use the
same ingredients as someone
would making their own home
brew.
