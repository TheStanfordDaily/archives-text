# Beowulf off the coast of Maine

Editor's note: This is the third
installment of a four-part short
story that will appear in Inter
mission.

"So, Mr. . . . can I call you
Felix?" Annie nearly dropped the
notepad she had taken out. For
some reason, she felt she was in
some kind of danger she
shouldn't know about. Good.
Something to make this vacation
a little exciting. They floated
unusually quickly away from the
fishing boat she was just on. She
wondered how they were going to
get back. There were no oars on
Felix's little dinghy.
"What message have you
brought from the world I have
forsaken?" He stared straight at
her with his one good eye.
"Well, Felix, the world you left
behind wants to know all about
you. People have heard stories
about how you wrestle sharks
and catch fish with your bare
hands. People..."
"In the name of my love, I lift
whales out of water and ride tidal
waves in storms. I eat schools of
fish and command armies of por
poises."
Metaphors, no doubt.
"Metaphors, of course."
"You test my patience. Good. I
mean all I say."
Ooh, a live one.
They had floated out of sight
of the fishing boat; she could no
longer see it anywhere. No prob
lem. There's plenty of light from
that full moon tonight. If the
Coast Guard comes looking, we'll
be as bright as a Jew in Harlem.
"How long have you been out
here, Mr. . . . Felix?"
"As long as the stars have kept
time, as long as the ocean has
kept its heartbeat."
"Okay. Let's try this: why are

you out here?"
"Mismankiewicz, why are
you?"
Annie hadn't remembered
introducing herself.
"You know who I am, then." He
might have seen her picture some
where. She was a journalist, after
all. From The Times, after all.
"Why are you here, Misman
kiewicz?"

Some mad beggar
fortuneteller... had
told her she would
never live to have
children.

"I'm asking the questions
here, old man." She didn't like
mind tricks. She had seen some
strange characters in Chinatown
some years ago try some on her.
Some mad beggar fortuneteller
whom she wouldn't honor with
change had told her she would
never live to have children come
out of her womb, and the next
week her gynecologist had found
a fucking cyst in her one remain
ing ovary.
She had tried to track the old
lady down, punish her somehow,
get even somehow, but of course
to no avail.
• Journalist or no, amateur
sleuth or no, no one fitting that
description had been around that
neighborhood since . . . since old

Lao Shiaji had died a month
before.
"Mismankiewicz, I am here for
much the same reason as you are.
But I have succeeded in finding
my one true love, and she is ever
lasting."
He pointed straight to the
moon behind him without looking.
Annie saw the moon, but it
was not a moon. Somehow, it
burned darker tonight. Darker,
but more passionately. It burned
so deeply that she could feel it,
feel a heat enveloping her face,
her arms, her breast, her body.
She didn't want to feel that, but
was powerless to feel otherwise.
This story is starting to be less
exciting. I might not get back in
time for my next assignment if
this guy has any more tricks up
his sleeve .. .
"Look ... I don't know what
you're talking about. What do you
mean, for the same reason? I'm
out here to do a story on your
fucking royal insanitiness." The
words spilled out uncontrollably.
She hadn't even wanted to say
them. Why couldn't she keep
cool? Why couldn't she play his
game?
He smiled. "Oh yes ... oh yes.
I remember. You sentries from
the world beyond, you need to
test my spiritual resolve. You
want me to believe that there is
no moon, that the world is round,
that I've lived my entire life for
an illusion. Yes, yes: I remember.
The moon is but a shadow of the
millionfold more powerful sun;
she — or it — " (chuckle) "is but a
ball of rock swinging eternally
about this earth. I've heard this,
Mismankiewicz; pray save your
breath."

want me to believe that there is
no moon, that the world is round,
that I've lived my entire life for
an illusion. Yes, yes: I remember.
The moon is but a shadow of the
millionfold more powerful sun;
she — or it — " (chuckle) "is but a
ball of rock swinging eternally
about this earth. I've heard this,
Mismankiewicz; pray save your
breath."
Editor's note: This is the third
installment of a four-part short
story that will appear in Inter
mission.

"So, Mr. . . . can I call you
Felix?" Annie nearly dropped the
notepad she had taken out. For
some reason, she felt she was in
some kind of danger she
shouldn't know about. Good.
Something to make this vacation
a little exciting. They floated
unusually quickly away from the
fishing boat she was just on. She
wondered how they were going to
get back. There were no oars on
Felix's little dinghy.
"What message have you
brought from the world I have
forsaken?" He stared straight at
her with his one good eye.
"Well, Felix, the world you left
behind wants to know all about
you. People have heard stories
about how you wrestle sharks
and catch fish with your bare
hands. People..."
"In the name of my love, I lift
whales out of water and ride tidal
waves in storms. I eat schools of
fish and command armies of por
poises."
Metaphors, no doubt.
"Metaphors, of course."
"You test my patience. Good. I
mean all I say."
Ooh, a live one.
They had floated out of sight
of the fishing boat; she could no
longer see it anywhere. No prob
lem. There's plenty of light from
that full moon tonight. If the
Coast Guard comes looking, we'll
be as bright as a Jew in Harlem.
"How long have you been out
here, Mr. . . . Felix?"
"As long as the stars have kept
time, as long as the ocean has
kept its heartbeat."
"Okay. Let's try this: why are

you out here?"
"Mismankiewicz, why are
you?"
Annie hadn't remembered
introducing herself.
"You know who I am, then." He
might have seen her picture some
where. She was a journalist, after
all. From The Times, after all.
"Why are you here, Misman
kiewicz?"

Some mad beggar
fortuneteller... had
told her she would
never live to have
children.

"I'm asking the questions
here, old man." She didn't like
mind tricks. She had seen some
strange characters in Chinatown
some years ago try some on her.
Some mad beggar fortuneteller
whom she wouldn't honor with
change had told her she would
never live to have children come
out of her womb, and the next
week her gynecologist had found
a fucking cyst in her one remain
ing ovary.
She had tried to track the old
lady down, punish her somehow,
get even somehow, but of course
to no avail.
• Journalist or no, amateur
sleuth or no, no one fitting that
description had been around that
neighborhood since . . . since old

Lao Shiaji had died a month
before.
"Mismankiewicz, I am here for
much the same reason as you are.
But I have succeeded in finding
my one true love, and she is ever
lasting."
He pointed straight to the
moon behind him without looking.
Annie saw the moon, but it
was not a moon. Somehow, it
burned darker tonight. Darker,
but more passionately. It burned
so deeply that she could feel it,
feel a heat enveloping her face,
her arms, her breast, her body.
She didn't want to feel that, but
was powerless to feel otherwise.
This story is starting to be less
exciting. I might not get back in
time for my next assignment if
this guy has any more tricks up
his sleeve .. .
"Look ... I don't know what
you're talking about. What do you
mean, for the same reason? I'm
out here to do a story on your
fucking royal insanitiness." The
words spilled out uncontrollably.
She hadn't even wanted to say
them. Why couldn't she keep
cool? Why couldn't she play his
game?
He smiled. "Oh yes ... oh yes.
I remember. You sentries from
the world beyond, you need to
test my spiritual resolve. You
want me to believe that there is
no moon, that the world is round,
that I've lived my entire life for
an illusion. Yes, yes: I remember.
The moon is but a shadow of the
millionfold more powerful sun;
she — or it — " (chuckle) "is but a
ball of rock swinging eternally
about this earth. I've heard this,
Mismankiewicz; pray save your
breath."
