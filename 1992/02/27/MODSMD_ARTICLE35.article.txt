# 'SNL' creator storms box office

Lome Michaels is obviously relieved at the initial
success of "Wayne's World."
"We got lucky," Michaels says."I don't think any
of us thought it would be this successful. We're very
lucky and very fortunate."
Best known as the creator and executive produc
er of "Saturday Night Live," Michaels, a seven-time
Emmy-winner, is also the man responsible for
bringing the cult "SNL" sketch "Wayne's World" to
the big screen for mass consumption.
Considering the $18 million the film made in its
first weekend of release, it's obvious that "Wayne's
World," which was budgeted at $14 million, has
already exceeded Michaels' modest aspirations for
the film. As he is quick to point out, "That's a stu
dio $14 million — that's like $3 million in real
money."
For Michaels, "Wayne's World" was the natural
choice to be his first Paramount feature film. "I

went to Paramount and they wanted me to make
low-budget comedies, and ['Wayne's World'] was
one of the first things I wanted to do," he says.
After getting the studio's backing, Michaels
enlisted "SNL" cast members Mike Myers and Dana
Carvey to recreate their roles as "Wayne" and
"Garth," and hired "SNL" writers Bonnie and
Terry Turner to write the screenplay.
"Before you know it we were shooting," Michaels
says. "We went into it not so much concentrating on
how to make a four-minute sketch a movie, but
rather how to make a funny movie."
The film was written in a little more than a
month last spring, after the final "SNL" show of the
season. Shooting started and ended in July.
"Because it was low-budget, and because we only
had 25 days to shoot it in, we were like a small com
mando unit," Michaels says."It was so inexpensive
that the studio pretty much left us alone."
Michaels' production deal with Paramount

includes at least two more pic
tures for the studio, but Michaels
says he hasn't thought about a
"Wayne's World" sequel or the
possibility of translating other
"SNL" sketches to the big screen.
Besides, he says, he enjoys pro
ducing "SNL" now more than
ever. When the inevitable ques
tions about the "glory years" of
the series arise — the days of
Belushi, Radner, Murray,
Akroyd, etc., etc. — Michaels
sighs with resignation.
"I was there for the glory
years, and it wasn't that much
fun," he says."I think the essen
tial difference between now and
the beginning is that back then
we were making it up as we went
along. We didn't know quite often
what we were doing. We were just
desperate to fill 90 minutes each
week.
"Now there's an environment
here which is like you have to be
in shape to go from a blank page
to on the air in six days. You just
need to be in shape, because
there's a lot of other guys around
that are after your ass."
Michaels thinks the movie
business, by contrast, is usually
uncreative. "The format tends to
be more and more getting some
one really funny together with
the world's most beautiful girl,
and I think that format is rather
tiresome," he says.
How much longer does
Michaels intend to produce
"SNL"?
"The rest of my life."
