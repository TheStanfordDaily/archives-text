Lome Michaels is obviously relieved at the initial
success of "Wayne's World."
"We got lucky," Michaels says."I don't think any
of us thought it would be this successful. We're very
lucky and very fortunate."
Best known as the creator and executive produc
er of "Saturday Night Live," Michaels, a seven-time
Emmy-winner, is also the man responsible for
bringing the cult "SNL" sketch "Wayne's World" to
the big screen for mass consumption.
Considering the $18 million the film made in its
first weekend of release, it's obvious that "Wayne's
World," which was budgeted at $14 million, has
already exceeded Michaels' modest aspirations for
the film. As he is quick to point out, "That's a stu
dio $14 million â€” that's like $3 million in real
money."
For Michaels, "Wayne's World" was the natural
choice to be his first Paramount feature film. "I

went to Paramount and they wanted me to make
low-budget comedies, and ['Wayne's World'] was
one of the first things I wanted to do," he says.
After getting the studio's backing, Michaels
enlisted "SNL" cast members Mike Myers and Dana
Carvey to recreate their roles as "Wayne" and
"Garth," and hired "SNL" writers Bonnie and
Terry Turner to write the screenplay.
"Before you know it we were shooting," Michaels
says. "We went into it not so much concentrating on
how to make a four-minute sketch a movie, but
rather how to make a funny movie."
The film was written in a little more than a
month last spring, after the final "SNL" show of the
season. Shooting started and ended in July.
"Because it was low-budget, and because we only
had 25 days to shoot it in, we were like a small com
mando unit," Michaels says."It was so inexpensive
that the studio pretty much left us alone."
