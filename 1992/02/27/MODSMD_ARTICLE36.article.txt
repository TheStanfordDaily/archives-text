# Sir Mix-A-Lot's album seeks soul
## 
### Cheo H. Coker Staff writer 
Despite the multi-platinum Success of his "Swass
and Seminar," Sir Mix-A-Lot isn't widely respected
by many hip-hop purists. Dante Ross, A&R man for
Elektra Records who signed Brand Nubian and KMD,
said at a recent rap conference that Mix "has no soul."
While his national sales match those of Ice Cube and
DJ Quik, he hasn't commanded the same hardcore
respect outside of the Northwest.
"Mack Daddy," Sir Mix-A-Lot's new release on
Rick Rubin's Def American label, is an attempt to
change all of that. While the raps are formula Mix-A-
Lot (oft-times humorous tales about Seattle's inner
city, matched with high intensity tech no-beats and
heavy bass lines), certain tracks definitely attempt to
win East Coast respect.
Does it work? At times, yes. While some tracks
lend validity to the criticism, others defy it. Either
way, Sir Mix-A-Lot is going to laugh all the way to the
bank with this one.
"One Times Got No Case," a clever send-up of a
Rodney King-like run in with the police, has a funky
Stevie Wonder sample. The song contains scathing,
yet hilarious, comments about black policemen:
"So she stuck a billy club in my back/She said don't
think because your black/That I won't beat
ya/Crack!/Hit you with the gat/Her partner starts to
laugh." The lyrics are an example of Mix's way of slip
ping in social commentary with his humor.
"Baby Got Back," a catchy celebration of that part
of the female anatomy that has inspired the lyrics of
many a rapper, is a foray into Miami Bass. If the suc
cess of "Pop That Coochie" is any example, this song
will be a smash. Mix's rendition, unlike 2 Live Crew's,

is humorous without being overly degrading or sexist.
"Seattle Ain't Bullshittin"' re-afiirms the impor
tance of this scene within the hip-hop nation. A funky
guitar lick, punctuated by a kickin' drum track,
makes this track very listenable.
"Lockjaw," however, is the cut that will silence all
detractors. Even a jaded New York hip-hop junkie will
have to admit that this cut slams. Over a succinct
"There Was A Time" James Brown sample, Mix pro
ceeds to abandon his customary ironic vocal twang in
favor of a more versatile rhyme style. Punish, his DJ,
cuts the beat like a surgeon with a scalpel; easily the
fastest hands in the West.
While "Testerossa," "A Rapper's Reputation" and
"Sprung On the Cat" momentarily detract from the
album's musical merits, "Jack Back" and "I'm Your
New God" put it right back on track. In "Jack," an
anti-Klan tirade, Mix adds a political edge to his
rhyme. He's not Chuck D., but his lyrics are thought
provoking.
"I'm Your New God" is a '90s remake of James
Brown's "King Heroin." Mix-A-Lot personifies the
drug, looking at crack addiction and distribution from
Cocaine's point of view. The effect is ironic and chill
ing. Musically, the track churns along with a bass
heavy track, reminiscent of a factory's production
line, adding even more to the song's symbolism.
Overall, "Mack Daddy" is an album worth check
ing out. The tape kicks enough bass for the boomin'
system, and should soon be heard from many of
them.
This album should win Mix-A-Lot some new fans
without insulting the sensibilities of his core audi
ence. Sir Mix-A Lot is the king of the Northwest rap
scene, and "Mack Daddy" will expand his con
stituency.
