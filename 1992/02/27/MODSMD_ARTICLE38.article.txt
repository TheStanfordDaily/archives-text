# Despite hard touring, band still unknown
## 
### Jennifer Maxwell 
Perhaps it's because their name
has a link to traveling. Or because
they are one of America's best live
club bands. Whatever the reason,
success for the Atlanta band Driv
in' N' Cryin' has come down to
three words: hit the road.
Although Drivin' N' Cryin' has
released four albums since its for
mation in 1985, the band has had to
rely on virtually constant touring to
get its music out to the people.
However, the members of Driv
in' N' Cryin' — singer/guitarist
Kevn Kinney, bassist Tim Nielsen,
drummer Jeff Sullivan and gui
tarist Buren Fowler — are willing
to work hard to win crowds over to
their unique musical vision.
Nielsen explains, "We're all
obsessed with our music. ... We
just want to last. We're going to
leave a mark for playing for years
and years, not to just jump on some
bandwagon or gimmick to get a hit
record."
Drivin' N' Cryin's music derives
from a wide variety of styles. Their
songs range from standard rock 'n'
roll to more progressive combina
tions of rock, country and folk. The
band claims influences as diverse
as Hank Williams Jr., Bob Dylan
and AC/DC.
Dogged club touring has gained
Drivin' N' Cryin' a large under

ground fan base, but has had little
impact on national radio and a
mass audience. Their lack of
widespread success is something
Nielsen can't explain.
"It's kind of weird because
around here in Atlanta and the
Southeast, we're like the biggest
band around ... but then on the
West Coast, we're still an under
ground sensation."
Drivin' N' Cryin' focused on
their hard-rocking side with their
latest album, "Fly Me Courageous,"
in an attempt to reach a larger audi
ence. "The objective with 'Fly Me
Courageous' was to win over the
AOR radio stations across the coun
try," Nielsen explained.
The plan worked. Radio stations
and MTV picked up on singles
"Build A Fire" and the title track
Nielsen is quick to point out
that Drivin' N' Cryin' has not left
behind their country and folk influ
ences. "We've still got those kind of
songs, we just didn't put them on
the record," he said. "It's some
thing that our true fans under
stand, that no matter what kind of
music we play, it's all us."
While the band plans its next
album to be in the same rock vein
of "Fly Me Courageous," they hope
to immediately follow that release
with a folk album.
One thing that won't continue is
Drivin' N' Cryin's hard-touring

ethic. Nielsen says the band has
learned that a singular devotion to
music leaves little time for families
and friends. "I'm just getting really
burned out on touring," he said.
"We all are ... Kevn and Buren,
their kids are growing up, and they

don't get to see them. It's not like
you get to have a do-over in life."

Drivin' N' Cryin' will play at Slim's
in San Francisco on Tuesday,
March 3. Tickets are $10; phone
621-3330 for more information.
