# Tensely facing off with a cap and gown

Graduation. The final showdown. The
maverick cowboy's last big gunslinging
duel against the forces who'd run him
out of town and into a 9-5 desk job for the rest
of his life. High noon. Now or never. I normal
ly wouldn't take ofT my bandana of denial to
think about these things, but last month I
rode a bull, and it raised my concern for the
future as high as it did my voice's pitch.
It was a cool, dry Thursday. The California
dust dangled like a participle in the still
evening air. It was Senior Pub Night at The
Saddlerack, a rootin', tootin' Western saloon
near San Jose. Whiskey was flowin', fiddles
were fiddlin', and I was all gussied up in my

The joint was called 'The
Saddlerack,' but all I left
with was a rattled sac.

best flannel, but there was no time for two
steppin'. I had a job to do. I was gonna tame
the bull. Dah bull. Ditka couldn't have said it
better.
I strode into the saloon, spit out my plug of
Tootsie Roll, and let my lazy eye wander
around the bar. The locals, sensing who it
was, averted their eyes in fear. But for all the
noise, you could've heard a pin drop.
"It's Harris the Kid!" they murmured. I
wondered if that meant I wasn't going to get
served.
"So," I thought, "these are the hicks who've
been buying up all those Garth Brooks
albums."
Then I saw it. Dah bull. From somewhere
in the distance came that whistle from"The
Good, the Bad, and the Ugly." Or it might've
been"The Andy Griffith Show" theme. Either
way, it was showdown time.
Dah bull is a mechanical bucking bronco
specifically designed to cause as much pain as
possible where it matters most to a man. Col
lege boys, trying to be macho, wait in line for
20 minutes to get on this device, so that, once
it starts moving, they can continuously slam
their private parts against a poorly-padded

handle ("Dah bull whammy") until they dive
off in agony.
Being one such macho college boy, I strut
ted past all the Marlboro ad extras, signed the
form giving the bull permission to accidental
ly kill or dismember me, and hopped on . . .
. . . After less than a minute, I let myself
slip off, trying not to whimper too loudly. Dah
bull won. Dah balls lost.
C'mon, Chris, groin and bear it. I hobbled
away, careful that no one brushed up against
my own tenderloin district.
Sure, the joint was called "The Saddler
ack," but all I left with was a rattled sac.
That's not what I'd meant when I'd said,
"Let's go out and get some bruise, guys . . ."
I got home and I've been feeling testes since
then. I was immobile for days, which left
me with plenty of extra time. Time to fin
ish up my "Studs" contestant application.
Time to catch up on the lovable antics of Fred
Bassett. Time to make the donuts. But most
of all, I could now ponder life's $64,000 ques
tions: What's the purpose? What's the point of
it all? Why can't I think up better transitions?
There's gotta be more to life than just prop
agation of the species — I already blew my
chances for that on the bull.
Or is there a point? I've tried to read the
writing on the wall, but all I can make out are
stupid grout jokes.
Y'see, I done been considerin' the "normal
life" here. There ain't nothin' really wrong
with it, I guess. Heck, I don't need disgusting
amounts of money, gold, jewels . . . Er, actual
ly, a couple jewels are important to safeguard,
I've discovered.
Gotta stop thinking 'bout that damn bull.

But there's gotta be more. If I don't do
something soon, my whole life will be like one
long bad trip to the Saddlerack: me busting
my balls just to stay on top of all the bull I
have to deal with.
So, I'm getting off the machine for a while.
I'm graduating early and spending my last
months here writing a book. Then I plan to
teach for a year or two in some exotic locale,
like Islamabad or Bali or Oakland. Just to
spend some time out of the mainstream. After
all, most people don't write books. Of course,
most people aren't investment bankers either,
but I'm ignoring that line.
After graduation is probably the best time
one'll ever have to do something original, so
I'm trying it. And if I somehow find a way to
make a living doing it, or even get rich and
famous and popular and loved and hugged and
kissed and called George in the process, then
all the better. Slim Goodbody found a way;
maybe I can too.
It's me against the world, I know. I'm stand
ing alone at the end of a dusty, deserted main
street. High Noon approaches, and that eerie
Eastwood/Griffith whistle is playing again.
I'm face-to-face with and 20 paces away
from an average life. "Draw!" it'll say, and I'll
say, "Awll riyyyyght, howoo's theeiss?" and
it'll say, "Not drawl - draw!" and I'll say "I
can't draw, but damn, do I got other talents!"
and then the showdown will start.
And with a little luck, as the dust clears and
the day closes, you'll catch me, still very much
alive, still very much myself, writing off into
the sunset.
