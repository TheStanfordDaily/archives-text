# 'To assist her suicide':
## Prof, pleads no contest in strangling of wife 
### June Fang Staff writer 
Harry Banoff, a retired associate profes
sor at the Medical Center, pleaded no con
test yesterday morning to charges that he
strangled his wife.
The plea reduced the original charge of
murder to voluntary manslaughter for
Banoff, who said he suffocated his terminal
ly ill wife Alice after she made an unsuccess
ful attempt at committing suicide, according
to defense attorney Ken Robinson.
Banoff, who has been associated with
Stanford for more than three decades, is a
member of the voluntary clinical faculty — a
group of local doctors who occasionally teach
classes at the Medical Center. An ophthal
mologist, he most recently worked at the Vet

eran's Administration eye clinic in Palo Alto.
Police arrested the 76-year-old BanofT
Aug. 31 shortly after the death of his 69-
year-old wife.
BanofT told police that his wife suffered
from a combination of debilitating and
painful illnesses, including cancer of the
bowel, shingles, encephalitis and muscle
inflammation, according to Deputy District
Attorney Richard Titus.
Robinson said yesterday that Alice
BanofT had been in deteriorating health
and was addicted to methadone, a high
powered painkiller.
"Harry loved Alice so much that it com
pelled him to end the tremendous suffering
she had endured for the last 20 years,"
Robinson said. "Harry finally did
something to put her out of her
misery."
According to Titus, Banoff told
police that his wife expressed an
intention that night to commit
suicide and that he strangled her
after her own attempted overdose
failed.
Initial observations by the
coroner's investigator and later
confirmation by an autopsy indi
cated that Alice Banoff had been
suffocated.
Banoff originally attributed his
wife's death to an overdose of
medication, but admitted stran

gling her following the release of
the autopsy report.
"After the police told him that
the cause of death was strangula
tion, Banoff admitted to assisting
her," said Titus. "He has main
tained that it was to assist her
suicide."
According to the police report,
Banoff said, "I shut off her
breathing because the pills
weren't doing it."
Robinson said that Alice
Banoff had even asked her hus
band to buy a copy of the contro
versial best seller "Final Exit," a
how-to suicide manual.
A second charge for felony
spousal abuse against Banoff was
dropped by the District Attor
ney's Office, which cited insuffi
cient evidence.
