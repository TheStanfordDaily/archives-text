# 'To assist her suicide':
## Prof, pleads no contest in strangling of wife 
### June Fang Staff writer 
Harry Banoff, a retired associate profes
sor at the Medical Center, pleaded no con
test yesterday morning to charges that he
strangled his wife.
The plea reduced the original charge of
murder to voluntary manslaughter for
Banoff, who said he suffocated his terminal
ly ill wife Alice after she made an unsuccess
ful attempt at committing suicide, according
to defense attorney Ken Robinson.
Banoff, who has been associated with
Stanford for more than three decades, is a
member of the voluntary clinical faculty â€” a
group of local doctors who occasionally teach
classes at the Medical Center. An ophthal
mologist, he most recently worked at the Vet

eran's Administration eye clinic in Palo Alto.
Police arrested the 76-year-old BanofT
Aug. 31 shortly after the death of his 69-
year-old wife.
BanofT told police that his wife suffered
from a combination of debilitating and
painful illnesses, including cancer of the
bowel, shingles, encephalitis and muscle
inflammation, according to Deputy District
Attorney Richard Titus.
Robinson said yesterday that Alice
BanofT had been in deteriorating health
and was addicted to methadone, a high
powered painkiller.
"Harry loved Alice so much that it com
pelled him to end the tremendous suffering
she had endured for the last 20 years,"
