## Classical Stevie Wonder 
### Cheo H. Coker 
"Saturday Night Fever"
doesn't immediately come to
mind when someone mentions
the '70s. Instead, my childhood
flashes before my very eyes:
Sooooooul Train!; Afro picks
with the black fist at the end; the
theme song to "Sanford and
Son"; the Jeffersons' "Deee-luxe
apartment in the Sky-Hi-Hi!";
"Songs In The Key Of Life."
"Songs In The Key Of Life"?
Oh yeah, that Stevie Wonder
album, the one with the shady
brown circles with Stevie in the
middle, complete with an Afro
and sunglasses. The jammie
with "Isn't She Lovely," "I
Wish" and "Sir Duke" on it.
Man, why you wanna write
about that old thing? What
about Blacksheep, or that new
Juice soundtrack.
New music isn't necessarily
improved music. "Key" is old,
but it's classical. It deserves a
place beside Beethoven for the
simple reason that it has music
that will never play out. It's like
hearing Slick Rick's "La-Di-Da-
Di" for the umpteenth millionth
time; the music gets fatter after
every repetition.
In one album, Stevie Wonder
summarizes an entire decade;
the despair, joy, tears, laughter
and love that was the '70s.
"Key" has everything: beautiful
ballads, funky uptempo songs
and lyrics that speak as much to

one's political conscience as they
do to one's imagination. Musical
perfection is no farther than a
copy of this album.
Following a pleasant intro
duction calling for the eradica
tion of prejudice through love,
"Have A Talk With God" sets
the first album in motion. Stevie
comes off with a subdued rum
bling electronic keyboard line
that just moves.
The resulting buzz simulta
neously stimulates and relaxes
the listener, while a simple har
monica line on top of the groove
evens things out like the choco
late frosting on a birthday cake.
Stevie's voice is the candle; the
lyrics flicker like the flame.
"Village Ghetto Land" is sat
urated with irony. In a satirical
tone, coupled with purposefully
ebullient organ music, Stevie
takes the listener for a walk
through the 'hood. The lyrics
are a chilling example of Won
der's innervisions; despite the
loss of visual sight, he paints as
clear a picture of ghetto reality
as Ice Cube ever could:
"Families buying dog food
now/Starvation roams the
street/ Babies die before they're
born/Infected by the grief."
While "Sir Duke" and"I
Wish" were among Stevie's
biggest hits in the '70s, "Pas
time Paradise" and "Ordinary
Pain" are the true gems of the
first record.

"Paradise" is a work of sheer
brilliance that defies verbal
description. The song works from
a rumbling bassline and African
drums, adding strings and a "call
and response" dialogue between
a Gospel Choir and Hare Krish
nas. The song swings harder
than a pendulum.
"Ordinary Pain" starts off as a
lovely, yet typical ballad, with
Stevie relating to the listener
how his woman did him wrong.
Things change, however, once we
hear the story from her point of
view. The second half picks up
with an uptempo funk change
up, along with an innovative
"ord-in-ary pain" background
chorus.
The second album is unique. It
continues the first, yet stands
alone on its own merits. "Joy
Inside My Tears" is a classic bal
lad, complete with strings, piano,
Stevie and the whole nine.
"If It's Magic" features only a
harp and Stevie's voice: the ulti

mate test for a vocalist, since
there are no instruments to cover
mistakes. Steveland's vocals pass
with flying colors, enveloping the
listener with their sheer beauty.
"As," however, is the climax of
this side. It starts off as a soft
ballad, but continues to build in
intensity. The result is a roller
coaster ride, probably the most
exciting seven minutes in soul
music, before and since.
"Easy Goin' Evening" ends
the album on a laid-back note;
just Stevie and his harmonica,
serenading the sunset.
"Songs In The Key Of Life" is
one of those albums worth dust
ing off. It testifies to the trans
formation Stevie Wonder made
from"the blind kid with the har
monica" to one of soul music's
greatest lyricists, producers, and
composers.
Compact discs were made to
preserve musical moments like
this. Pull on a faded pair of bell
bottoms, dust off that brown
polyester shirt with the butterfly
collar, pour yourself a nice big
glass of grape Kool-Aid and let
Stevie's music take you back to
the old school. I'm out like shout.

are a chilling example of Won
der's innervisions; despite the
loss of visual sight, he paints as
clear a picture of ghetto reality
as Ice Cube ever could:
"Families buying dog food
now/Starvation roams the
street/ Babies die before they're
born/Infected by the grief."
While "Sir Duke" and"I
Wish" were among Stevie's
biggest hits in the '70s, "Pas
time Paradise" and "Ordinary
Pain" are the true gems of the
first record.

"Paradise" is a work of sheer
brilliance that defies verbal
description. The song works from
a rumbling bassline and African
drums, adding strings and a "call
and response" dialogue between
a Gospel Choir and Hare Krish
nas. The song swings harder
than a pendulum.
"Ordinary Pain" starts off as a
lovely, yet typical ballad, with
Stevie relating to the listener
how his woman did him wrong.
Things change, however, once we
hear the story from her point of
view. The second half picks up
with an uptempo funk change
up, along with an innovative
"ord-in-ary pain" background
chorus.
The second album is unique. It
continues the first, yet stands
alone on its own merits. "Joy
Inside My Tears" is a classic bal
lad, complete with strings, piano,
Stevie and the whole nine.
"If It's Magic" features only a
harp and Stevie's voice: the ulti

mate test for a vocalist, since
there are no instruments to cover
mistakes. Steveland's vocals pass
with flying colors, enveloping the
listener with their sheer beauty.
"As," however, is the climax of
this side. It starts off as a soft
ballad, but continues to build in
intensity. The result is a roller
coaster ride, probably the most
exciting seven minutes in soul
music, before and since.
"Easy Goin' Evening" ends
the album on a laid-back note;
just Stevie and his harmonica,
serenading the sunset.
"Songs In The Key Of Life" is
one of those albums worth dust
ing off. It testifies to the trans
formation Stevie Wonder made
from"the blind kid with the har
monica" to one of soul music's
greatest lyricists, producers, and
composers.
Compact discs were made to
preserve musical moments like
this. Pull on a faded pair of bell
bottoms, dust off that brown
polyester shirt with the butterfly
collar, pour yourself a nice big
glass of grape Kool-Aid and let
Stevie's music take you back to
the old school. I'm out like shout.
"Saturday Night Fever"
doesn't immediately come to
mind when someone mentions
the '70s. Instead, my childhood
flashes before my very eyes:
Sooooooul Train!; Afro picks
with the black fist at the end; the
theme song to "Sanford and
Son"; the Jeffersons' "Deee-luxe
apartment in the Sky-Hi-Hi!";
"Songs In The Key Of Life."
"Songs In The Key Of Life"?
Oh yeah, that Stevie Wonder
album, the one with the shady
brown circles with Stevie in the
middle, complete with an Afro
and sunglasses. The jammie
with "Isn't She Lovely," "I
Wish" and "Sir Duke" on it.
Man, why you wanna write
about that old thing? What
about Blacksheep, or that new
Juice soundtrack.
New music isn't necessarily
improved music. "Key" is old,
but it's classical. It deserves a
place beside Beethoven for the
simple reason that it has music
that will never play out. It's like
hearing Slick Rick's "La-Di-Da-
Di" for the umpteenth millionth
time; the music gets fatter after
every repetition.
In one album, Stevie Wonder
summarizes an entire decade;
the despair, joy, tears, laughter
and love that was the '70s.
"Key" has everything: beautiful
ballads, funky uptempo songs
and lyrics that speak as much to

one's political conscience as they
do to one's imagination. Musical
perfection is no farther than a
copy of this album.
Following a pleasant intro
duction calling for the eradica
tion of prejudice through love,
"Have A Talk With God" sets
the first album in motion. Stevie
comes off with a subdued rum
bling electronic keyboard line
that just moves.
The resulting buzz simulta
neously stimulates and relaxes
the listener, while a simple har
monica line on top of the groove
evens things out like the choco
late frosting on a birthday cake.
Stevie's voice is the candle; the
lyrics flicker like the flame.
"Village Ghetto Land" is sat
urated with irony. In a satirical
tone, coupled with purposefully
ebullient organ music, Stevie
takes the listener for a walk
through the 'hood. The lyrics
are a chilling example of Won
der's innervisions; despite the
loss of visual sight, he paints as
clear a picture of ghetto reality
as Ice Cube ever could:
"Families buying dog food
now/Starvation roams the
street/ Babies die before they're
born/Infected by the grief."
