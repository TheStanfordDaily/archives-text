# diminuendo and CRESCENDO
## Classical Stevie Wonder 
### Cheo H. Coker 
"Saturday Night Fever"
doesn't immediately come to
mind when someone mentions
the '70s. Instead, my childhood
flashes before my very eyes:
Sooooooul Train!; Afro picks
with the black fist at the end; the
theme song to "Sanford and
Son"; the Jeffersons' "Deee-luxe
apartment in the Sky-Hi-Hi!";
"Songs In The Key Of Life."
"Songs In The Key Of Life"?
Oh yeah, that Stevie Wonder
album, the one with the shady
brown circles with Stevie in the
middle, complete with an Afro
and sunglasses. The jammie
with "Isn't She Lovely," "I
Wish" and "Sir Duke" on it.
Man, why you wanna write
about that old thing? What
about Blacksheep, or that new
Juice soundtrack.
New music isn't necessarily
improved music. "Key" is old,
but it's classical. It deserves a
place beside Beethoven for the
simple reason that it has music
that will never play out. It's like
hearing Slick Rick's "La-Di-Da-
Di" for the umpteenth millionth
time; the music gets fatter after
every repetition.
In one album, Stevie Wonder
summarizes an entire decade;
the despair, joy, tears, laughter
and love that was the '70s.
"Key" has everything: beautiful
ballads, funky uptempo songs
and lyrics that speak as much to

one's political conscience as they
do to one's imagination. Musical
perfection is no farther than a
copy of this album.
Following a pleasant intro
duction calling for the eradica
tion of prejudice through love,
"Have A Talk With God" sets
the first album in motion. Stevie
comes off with a subdued rum
bling electronic keyboard line
that just moves.
The resulting buzz simulta
neously stimulates and relaxes
the listener, while a simple har
monica line on top of the groove
evens things out like the choco
late frosting on a birthday cake.
Stevie's voice is the candle; the
lyrics flicker like the flame.
"Village Ghetto Land" is sat
urated with irony. In a satirical
tone, coupled with purposefully
ebullient organ music, Stevie
takes the listener for a walk
through the 'hood. The lyrics
are a chilling example of Won
der's innervisions; despite the
loss of visual sight, he paints as
clear a picture of ghetto reality
as Ice Cube ever could:
"Families buying dog food
now/Starvation roams the
street/ Babies die before they're
born/Infected by the grief."
While "Sir Duke" and"I
Wish" were among Stevie's
biggest hits in the '70s, "Pas
time Paradise" and "Ordinary
Pain" are the true gems of the
first record.
