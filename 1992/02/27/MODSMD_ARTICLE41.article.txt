# 'Interpreters' serves up more than wine, vodka
## 
### Trevor Payne 
The dickering between British
and Russian diplomats working
out the menu and theater
arrangements for an upcoming
visit by the Soviet President is
the backdrop for "Interpreters,"
a tragic love farce playing in Palo
Alto.
The banal intrigue over "wine
or vodka?" is supplemented by
under-the-table negotiations
between the translators, who
manage to surreptitiously
arrange an affair and a plan for
defection.
From the opening monologue
to the last scene, the play grasps
the attention of the audience and
compels them through a myriad
of emotional responses. We start
out laughing, end up contempla
tive and walk out feeling full.
Talk of defection and KGB
agents seems somewhat anachro
nistic. However, the play is not
primarily about interpreting
communication between political
systems, but rather between men
and women.
Cliche Cold War holdovers (a
brash, vodka-guzzling diplomat
and a thin, dried-out British
bureaucrat) serve not to highlight
a political parody, but to repre
sent the insensitive male-domi
nated bureaucracies. This theme
of miscommunication between

the sexes is timeless.
From the outset, the emotion
al sphere is centered around
Nadia, acted wonderfully by Vicki
Willy. The play opens with witty
dialogue and light sexual spar
ring, yet the banter fatally fore
shadows the intense and com
pelling ending.
The men in the play, with their
emotions well-cloaked in diplo
macy, are a striking contrast to
the female figures. Indeed, their
dealings with women seem like
foreign relations.
The play, however, is not with
out a strong female influence.
Miriam Babin does a great job
playing Nadia's 93-year-old
grandmother, Sophia, who seems
just to want Nadia to be indepen
dent of the male world which has
tied her down for so long.
But as the stage fades to black
in the final seconds, without a
glint of levity retained, we are left
contemplating Nadia's tragic sit
uation. Is willing victimization
the best she can hope for?
This is a splendid play, well
acted, funny, thought-provoking
and very much open to interpre
tation.
