# 'Hear My Song' quirky, but never off-key
## 
### Susan Brockenbrough 
Not just any movie would send its main
character off into the sunset astride a wreck
ing ball — but "Hear My Song" is no ordi
nary film.
Adrian Dunbar plays Micky O'Neill, an
Irishman in Liverpool trying to find fame
and fortune by booking acts into a nightclub
called Heartleys.

After several failed attempts at finding a
profitable act, including an appearance by
"Franc Cinatra," O'Neill is on the brink of
failure. He and his portly sidekicks fmagle
one last chance to keep their jobs by bringing
in Joe Locke, a famous Irish tenor exiled for
tax evasion.
O'Neill's luck is bad, though, and the Joe
Locke he finds is a phony who is discovered
by O'Neill's girlfriend's mother, an ex-beau

ty queen who was the real Locke's lover
before he escaped the tax collectors. Convo
luted? Yes — and that's all the fun.
Once the phony Locke (William Hootkins)
is exposed, the chase is on for O'Neill to find
the true tenor before losing his love and
livelihood forever.
The film's quirkiness comes from unex
pected plot twists — like a sudden change of
identity, or the salvation of a cow that nearly
plunges into an impossibly deep well.
Minor characters, including Hootkins'
phony Locke, also add verve. Micky's friend
ship with the always sincere, yet never
schlocky, Fintan O'Donnell (James Nesbitt)
adds warmth to their adventuresome search
for Locke.
Dunbar's Micky steals the show, though.
He can't hide his charm underneath the
feigned oily exterior of the salesman he tries
to be. It's hard to resist a man in love on a
mission for his woman. Especially when he
"was bo in in peacetime," and he "doesn't
know what you know."
What's refreshing about the film is its
simplicity — an adventure in the name of
love — and its style. The '40s musical feel
makes a nice change from the fiery crashes,
exploding heads and body doubles that make
so many contemporary films seem the same.
English movies generally demand a little
more thinking on the part of the audience.
"Hear My Song" — written for the screen
and directed by Englishman Peter Chelsom
— is no exception.
Chelsom's demand has its reward, though.
"Hear My Song" is one of those movies that
lets you leave the theater singing.
