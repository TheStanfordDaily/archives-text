# 'Masala' pleases with sugar and spice
## 
### Paul Curthoys Editorial staff 
Masala, as Mina (Sarita
Choudhury) shyly tells her new
boyfriend, is an Indian mixture
of hot spices.
And the film itself, "Missis
sippi Masala," is a spicy blend of
racial relations and world poli
tics, with an added dash of
humor. A few minor flaws mar
the movie's final flavor, particu
larly in scenes where weak act
ing doesn't support the emotions
the audience is asked to believe.
Regardless, director Mira
Nair has produced an excellent
concoction that tells a moving
story of interracial love blended
with a subplot of a family's exile
from their homeland.
Though Indian by the color of
their skin, Mina's family hails
from Uganda. For the past 20
years or so, they have lived in
Mississippi, where they own and
run a roadside motel.
Mina meets Demetrius (Den
zel Washington) when she acci
dentally rear-ends his van. When
she encounters him in a bar later
that night, they both use each
other to escape from unpleasant
dating situations.
However, with a speed that is
both confusing and unexplained,
they quickly move from a rela
tionship of convenience to a
steamy love affair.
The suddenness of their
"love" leaves an empty spot in

the movie; they jump from hesi
tant friends to passionate lovers
so rapidly, I didn't buy it. But
the problem, caused by slightly
inexpressive acting, is small —
Nair quickly moves the film
away from the love story and
into the heat of interracial strife.
When Mina's cousins discover

the couple in a motel room, they
unleash the forces of white
racism against the couple, and,
more importantly, spark an
uproar in both the Indian and
the black communities:
"Boy, don't you know the
rules?" demands Demetrius'
father when he learns of the

relationship, and the couple is
plunged into a sea of recrimina
tion and racism.
Despite an ending that comes
ofT as corny instead of breathtak
ing, Nair has created a multi-lay
ered movie that, at the end,
stands in the viewer's mind like
a beautiful tapestry.
