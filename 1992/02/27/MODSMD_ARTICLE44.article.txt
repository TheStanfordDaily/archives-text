# Dorm sports let you clobber away stress

### Mark Byer Staff writer 
Pressure can be released in many ways: par
tying, sleeping, whining — or competing in
dorm sports.
Dorm sports are strange, often one-time
events that last for a few hours and result in
many inside jokes, only to be forgotten in a few
weeks. However, a few newer additions found
on campus provide Stanford with a bit of spice:
Sock Wars
Official rules call for a dorm room, some
regulation silver duct-tape and many socks.
The duct-tape evenly divides the room. There
are two people to a team.
Both members on a team must kneel, on
their respective sides of the room, and remain
kneeling throughout the game. In front of
each of the players is a "large" pile of socks. At
the sound of a referee's whistle, the game
begins.
Sock Wars is faster than team handball, and
requires a cohesive team structure and complex
yin-yang strategies. For every sock thrown to
the opponents' side, ten more are returned in a
frantic struggle to clear one's side.
After two minutes of play, the whistle is
blown and a sock count is taken. The winning
team is the team with fewer socks on its side.
For fun, the socks used for play may be dirty as
well, and a wager be made: the losing team
does the laundry for the winning team.
Sure, the strategies might be complex, yet
the rules remain simple enough for the aver
age baseball fan.

Jousting
Grab your mattress and prepare to get tipsy.
The Betas recently revived the time of King
Arthur. Two knights face off 10 paces from one
another, holding mattresses to their bodies.
At the appropriate cue — a scarf dropped by
a fair maiden — the heavily loaded nights
charge each other. The knight left standing is

Eric Yoon — Daily
the winner of the fair maiden's hand.
These two sports are only a few of the many
that Stanford dormitories invent each year.
Such innovative sports are excellent ways of
relieving the psychosis that has been linked to
studying.
Unfortunately, the rules for most dorm sports
are never recorded, and through time, the oral
tradition is broken and the sport is forgotten.
