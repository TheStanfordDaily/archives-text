# Although you'll escape food service, don't plan to study

Although Cafe Montmartre
is not as well-known as other
restaurants in the area, it
should be. Most people don't
think of cafes as a good place to
eat dinner, but the eclectic
menu offers a variety of excel
lent choices.
I sat down with my guest and
decided to order from the menu
because every buffet reminds me
a little too much of food service,
and I wanted to keep my appetite.
The menu doesn't assume
that people go there only for the
buffet. Instead, it offers a vari
ety of unique pasta dishes made
fresh to order, several salads
(everything from Greek to Chi
nese Chicken) and other inter
esting creations.
The place is a little too yuppie
to be a real cafe, but no worse
than Cafe Borrone, which has a
huge following.
In the end, I relented and
took a look at the buffet. This is
not a salad bar, nor a soup-and -
salad bar, but a feast with four
soups; a huge salad bar with cold
pastas; four hot entrees; and
jello and pudding for dessert.

My friend had the tequila
chicken pasta, just one of the
many interesting choices. It had
a unique flavor combination
that is definitely worth trying. I
had the Pelmeni, which are
strange but good dumplings
served with a thick, tangy dip
ping sauce on the side.
After dinner we had cakes
and cafTe latte for dessert. The
chocolate cakes are excellent but
really rich. Afterward, we were
invited to come back at nine to
listen to some local music.
When I returned I was sur
prised to find the place much
more crowded than it had been
at dinner, with a good mix of
Stanford students and younger
Palo Altoans. The atmosphere
was much more subdued, and
though it was still too open
spaced to feel like a real cafe, the
music made it worth staying.
It's a great place to eat, a cool
place to see a band (like Cliff
Goldmacher, who will be there
this Friday at 9 p.m.), but not
really a cafe that I'd feel com
fortable studying at.

Cafe Montmartre is located at
150 University Ave., 324-9536.
