# Yeast, hops toil for daily brew

### Trevor Payne 
There are really no revolutionary ways to brew
beer — all of the techniques are variations on a
theme. After all, beer has been around since
grains have been farmed and people decided they
could not live on bread alone.
A beer's ingredients are largely responsible for
its taste. What you start out with determines
what you end up with. The process of brewing
basically involves setting up the most favorable
circumstances to let ingredients do their stuff —
au naturel.
After the mixture is crushed, soaked in water
and heated, enzymes in the malt turn starches
into fermentable sugars. The sugar water is natu
rally filtered through the barley mash and is then
concentrated by boiling.
By heating and cooling to activate and deacti
vate the process, Anchor Steam and Gordon-Bier
sch avoid using chemicals that pervert the taste of
the beer. Heating during the initial stages encour
ages the enzymes to operate. More intense heat
ing inactivates them. Altering the temperature
also deactivates the yeast.
Hops are the dried flower of a perennial vine.
They are responsible for imparting to the beer its
distinctive aroma and bitter quality — forget the
hops and the beer is deflowered.
Neither brewery uses cheaper grains such as
rice or corn. These weaken the beer's impact on
the palate, making it for mass consumption rather
than enjoyment.
