Bechtel International Center may close its Office
of International Visitors next year if it is unable to
find outside funding for the program, according to
director Maria Bun.
The I-Center took a 15 percent cut in its operating
budget this year and is facing even greater cuts in April.
If the office is to survive, it must rely on grants,
primarily from the United States Information Agen
cy, Bun said.
The office provides opportunities for internation
al politicians, academics, journalists and other guests
to visit faculty or students at Stanford. The office's
survival will depend on the agency's response and
further University cuts to the I-Center.
"We've already cut the number of visitors by more
than half," Bun said.
According to the office's annual report, there were
769 international visitors to Stanford last year between
Sept. 1990 and Aug. 1991. There were 1,706 in 1985.
Bun's position was cut from full time to 75 per
cent time in Sept. 1991. The rest of the office staff
consists of 10 volunteers, Bun said.
"I can't program 1,700 visitors a year on part-time
only," she added.
Many faculty and staff members have written the
I-Center in recent months to protest the office's
potential closure. The letters stressed a need for
Stanford to enhance its international reputation.
For example, Kathleen Morrison, assistant director
of the Center for Latin American Studies, wrote in a
Nov. 4 letter that the Center was able to solicit a gift
of $400,000 as a result of a visit last winter by the
president of a Venezuelan philanthropic organization.
However, I-Center Director John Pearson said
that, given the severity of the budget cuts, "if the
Office of International Visitors doesn't disappear,
something else will."
If the I-Center does not reduce funding for the office,
cuts will have to be made in other programs, such as
immigration advising to faculty and students or study
abroad services for American students, Pearson said.
The office is in the process of applying for a Unit
ed States Information Agency grant to fund its oper
ating costs for next year. The I-Center will not make
a decision about the office's future until it hears
