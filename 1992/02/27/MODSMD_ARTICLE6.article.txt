# I-Center may close Visitors' Office due to lack of funds

Bechtel International Center may close its Office
of International Visitors next year if it is unable to
find outside funding for the program, according to
director Maria Bun.
The I-Center took a 15 percent cut in its operating
budget this year and is facing even greater cuts in April.
If the office is to survive, it must rely on grants,
primarily from the United States Information Agen
cy, Bun said.
The office provides opportunities for internation
al politicians, academics, journalists and other guests
to visit faculty or students at Stanford. The office's
survival will depend on the agency's response and
further University cuts to the I-Center.
"We've already cut the number of visitors by more
than half," Bun said.
According to the office's annual report, there were
769 international visitors to Stanford last year between
Sept. 1990 and Aug. 1991. There were 1,706 in 1985.
Bun's position was cut from full time to 75 per
cent time in Sept. 1991. The rest of the office staff
consists of 10 volunteers, Bun said.
"I can't program 1,700 visitors a year on part-time
only," she added.
Many faculty and staff members have written the
I-Center in recent months to protest the office's
potential closure. The letters stressed a need for
Stanford to enhance its international reputation.
For example, Kathleen Morrison, assistant director
of the Center for Latin American Studies, wrote in a
Nov. 4 letter that the Center was able to solicit a gift
of $400,000 as a result of a visit last winter by the
president of a Venezuelan philanthropic organization.
However, I-Center Director John Pearson said
that, given the severity of the budget cuts, "if the
Office of International Visitors doesn't disappear,
something else will."
If the I-Center does not reduce funding for the office,
cuts will have to be made in other programs, such as
immigration advising to faculty and students or study
abroad services for American students, Pearson said.
The office is in the process of applying for a Unit
ed States Information Agency grant to fund its oper
ating costs for next year. The I-Center will not make
a decision about the office's future until it hears
from the agency, Pearson said.
Although Bun said she believes
the office will have to be cut if no
outside funds are found, Pearson
said the office will not necessarily
be closed. "University funding will
be eliminated provided that other
funds are found," Pearson said.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson was unavailable for com
ment yesterday but had an assis
tant tell The Daily that his posi
tion is the same as Pearson's.
While some faculty praise the

services of the office, others have
complained that meetings with
visitors waste time and are often
irrelevant to their academic inter
ests, Pearson said.
In response to some faculty
concerns, an advisory group was
formed in 1987 to review the ser
vices of the office.
According to the group's
report, U.S. government-spon
sored visitors — officials of for
eign governments who are "on
the grand tour" — are considered
to be "of less interest and more of
an imposition."
Pearson said the office per
forms an important service for
the U.S. government because the

visitors "think very highly of
Stanford."
"The office is a PR center,"
Pearson said. "But can that justify
its getting funds? We need to work
with fewer visitors, who are more
relevant to the University's needs."
Bun said that until now Stan
ford has not been eligible for long
term grant money from the U.S.
agency, which has targeted volun
teer groups with no other sources
of funding.
This year, the agency changed
its rules because of Stanford's
budget cuts, Bun said. The office
"should be entitled to apply for a
grant, since 40 percent of the time
we work for the agency," she said.

According to last year's Office
of International Visitors annual
report, 38 percent of Stanford's
international visitors were spon
sored by the United States Infor
mation Agency, for whom the
office coordinated programs.
The remaining 62 percent of
international visitors, including
scholars and representatives from
private industries, came at their
own or their government's
expense, according to the report.
Visitors hosted by the office
program have included President
F.W. de Klerk of South Africa,
who visited in 1976, and Presi
dent Alfredo Christiani of El Sal
vador, who visited in 1986.
