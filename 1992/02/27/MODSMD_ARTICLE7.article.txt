# Milkman delivering to Stanford for 37 years
## Much changed: Nonfat replaces homogenized 
### Susan Brockenbrough 
Not many things at Stanford are the same
as they were in the '50s.
Back then, men wore ties, and women wore
skirts. But the milk that Stanford students of
the '50s drank was delivered by the same man
who brings milk to most of the campus today
— Don Kafka.
Kafka (no relation to the author), has load
ed up his butter-colored Peninsula Creamery
truck and delivered milk, butter, cheeses, half
and-half and cream all over campus for 37 of
his 63 years.
His first delivery to campus was in 1955.
"Stanford has grown into a city since then,"
he said.
"I still remember in the '50s when girls
wore dresses and the boys wore white shirts
and ties," Kafka said wistfully.

"In the '60s there were a
lot of protests and the stu
dents even started to have
long hair and dirty clothes —
some didn't even wear
clothes. The '70s were the
same. And then in the '80s,
the students started wearing
Levis."
Kafka said he liked the '50s
best, "when people were

' • ■ iiv iviimmaii
clean.
Milk hasn't changed much over the years,
but the Stanford community's drinking habits
have.
When he first hit the roads as a milkman,
people used to drink "homogenized milk. Now,
it's all nonfat and lowfat," he said. "People

used to eat butter, now they eat margarine."
"Everyone's diet-conscious," he said.
Some things have stayed the same, though.
Winter "has always been a slow milk quarter,"
he said. "It's been that way for years."
Kafka's delivery day ends when most peo
ple's begins. At 8:30 a.m., his light blue shirt
with a red "Don" stitched on the pocket is a lit
tle rumpled.
He takes a pen from this pocket at the start
of each delivery. He scans the order posted on
the door to each dorm and puts a check mark
on the order after he's read it.
Then, he picks up stacks of empty, gray
milk crates, some of which hold foggy glass
bottles and sets it by the door. Kafka fills these

with fresh supplies from his truck.
Glass bottles have made a come
back, "for environmental reasons,"
Kafka said. The Medical Center
still gets little cartons, though.
Kafka's shift starts at mid
night and ends at around 10 a.m.,
depending on how many deliver
ies he has to make, he said. Usu
ally, there are many.
"It would be a lot easier to
name the dorms I don't deliver to
than the dorms I do," he said.
"Golly, I guess I deliver to just
about all of them," he added,
grinning.
Kafka admits that he doesn't
drink milk regularly. "It's like if
you work in a candy factory. You
eat it until you get sick and then
you don't eat it anymore."
After so many years, Kafka still
likes what he does. "I like the people
I work for and I really like the Stan
ford students. They're all great."
He has also joined the Kappa
Sigma fraternity. "The guys just
like me, so they made me an hon
orary member," he said.
When the last pint of milk is
packed away in Stanford refriger
ators, Kafka goes home to his
wife Shirley. The pair has been
married 43 years.
Kafka describes himself as "but
terbrickle ice cream. And his wife?
"Shirley would be nonfat
yogurt — that's for sure."
