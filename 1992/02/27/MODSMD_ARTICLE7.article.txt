# Milkman delivering to Stanford for 37 years
## Much changed: Nonfat replaces homogenized 
### Susan Brockenbrough 
Not many things at Stanford are the same
as they were in the '50s.
Back then, men wore ties, and women wore
skirts. But the milk that Stanford students of
the '50s drank was delivered by the same man
who brings milk to most of the campus today
— Don Kafka.
Kafka (no relation to the author), has load
ed up his butter-colored Peninsula Creamery
truck and delivered milk, butter, cheeses, half
and-half and cream all over campus for 37 of
his 63 years.
His first delivery to campus was in 1955.
"Stanford has grown into a city since then,"
he said.
"I still remember in the '50s when girls
wore dresses and the boys wore white shirts
and ties," Kafka said wistfully.

"In the '60s there were a

same. And then in the '80s,
the students started wearing

When he first hit the roads as a milkman,
people used to drink "homogenized milk. Now,
it's all nonfat and lowfat," he said. "People

used to eat butter, now they eat margarine."
"Everyone's diet-conscious," he said.
Some things have stayed the same, though.
Winter "has always been a slow milk quarter,"
he said. "It's been that way for years."
Kafka's delivery day ends when most peo
ple's begins. At 8:30 a.m., his light blue shirt
with a red "Don" stitched on the pocket is a lit
tle rumpled.
He takes a pen from this pocket at the start
of each delivery. He scans the order posted on
the door to each dorm and puts a check mark
on the order after he's read it.
Then, he picks up stacks of empty, gray
milk crates, some of which hold foggy glass
bottles and sets it by the door. Kafka fills these
