For some, computer clusters
are highly sophisticated torture
chambers, but others have learned
to bend the instrument to their
wills.
Today, multitudes use comput
ers as a means of communication,
recreation and study. Computer
networks — which originated in
the 1960s as a scheme to link the
military and its contractors —
have gone mainstream, as univer
sities and private industry use
them to facilitate the rapid
exchange of information.
At Stanford, one manifestation
of this protean concept is elec
tronic mail, which has replaced
the heaps of memos cluttering
desks and wallpapering bulletin
boards.
But it can have more interest
ing uses as well.
E-mail can be "the ultimate
blind date," said psychology gradu
ate student Mickey Phoenix, whose
e-mail address is sykopath@leland.
Wandering around the net, he was
delighted to find that someone at
the University of Washington was
named asparagi.
This instantly set her apart
from more mundane vegetables,
he decided. "So I sent her a mes
sage at three in the morning, and
she was crazy enough to reply to a
complete stranger named
sykopath," Phoenix said. "So I
met my best friend over e-mail.
OK, I'm weird."
He said some revel in the
anonymity permitted by electron
ic communications. "It's a great
equalizer," said Phoenix, a self
confessed net addict. "A 16-year
old and a 65-year-old can talk as
equals. It gets rid of aIL the exter
nal baggage that people normally
carry around."
Phoenix, who happens to be 6-
foot-6, said that some people are
intimidated by his height, so he

finds computer communications
liberating. "On the net, you are
judged by your behavior, and not
by your appearance," he said.
E-mail is also used in news
groups, another example of net
works' potentially exciting appli
cations.
News groups are excellent
forums for discussion of issues,
many students said. "I'll post
something to the group, and
someone will respond directly by
sending me e-mail," said Brad
Chamberlain, a senior majoring
in computer science.
Chamberlain said he thinks
the future of electronic communi
cations will extend accessibility to
the general public. "The networks
have the capability to expand and
displace a lot of mail and newspa
pers," he said.
Kevin McGuire, a graduate
student teaching "Cyberspace,"
an Undergradute Studies course
about information technology and
its implications, agrees.
The networks "have great pos-

sibilities for the dissemination of
information," he said, pointing
out the group soc.rights.human,
which posts Amnesty Interna
tional bulletins.
However, this freedom of
expression has some limitations.
Notorious in the subculture of
groups are "flame wars," which
are vicious exchanges of personal
insults on the net.
A "flame" is a response to a
question or comment that some
one else considers stupid. Some
times tensions and postings can
escalate. Homosexuality and reli
gion are two topics that easily
generate controversy, according
to Chamberlain.
"Once a fundamentalist Chris
tian posted that everyone was going
to hell, something like that, and the
responses increased exponentially,
with everyone putting their two
cents in," Chamberlain said.
One drawback that both
McGuire and Chamberlain pointed
out is that communication via com
puter terminal might reduce, or

even eliminate, personal contact.
"They said TV would keep
everyone indoors and they
wouldn't do as many things," said
Chamberlain, who added that he
can spend hours reading news
groups. "I can see that happening
with networks."
For some, e-mail takes the
place of letter-writing.
Bespectacled first-year gradu
ate student Ed Vail, peering up
from his electrical engineering
homework, says he sends about
four e-mail messages per day to
his friends at Caltech. "E-mail is
better than normal mail, but not
as good as the telephone," he said.
However, fiber optics, the com
munication lines used in certain
nets, have bound many a relation
ship together. An alternative to
mind-boggling phone bills, the
"talk" function permits Dan Cory,
a senior and former resident com
puter coordinator, to type mes
sages whose characters appear
simultaneously on his friend's
terminal at Princeton.
