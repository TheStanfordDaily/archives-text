'We were out in the trenches, running from the dogs and
firehoses. (But) we became like a little family. ... We didn't
think we were doing anything so important. I still pinch myself.'

After a lifetime in the public
eye, one of the civil rights move
ment's most important players
has slipped quietly onto the
Stanford campus.
Dorothy Cotton is described
by Stewart Burns, associate edi
tor of the Martin Luther King,
Jr. Papers Project, as "a hero of
the civil rights movement" and
"the highest woman leader in
the Southern Christian Leader

Cotton said. "We had to be."
King was a great influence on
the group's closeness. "He was a
fun person to be with and work
with," Cotton said. Easygoing
and friendly, he was "the life of
the party. He loved to tell jokes."
Cotton and King met for the
first time when he came to help

Virginia, where she lived. The
