# Leader recalls rights battle

'We were out in the trenches, running from the dogs and
firehoses. (But) we became like a little family. ... We didn't
think we were doing anything so important. I still pinch myself.'

After a lifetime in the public
eye, one of the civil rights move
ment's most important players
has slipped quietly onto the
Stanford campus.
Dorothy Cotton is described
by Stewart Burns, associate edi
tor of the Martin Luther King,
Jr. Papers Project, as "a hero of
the civil rights movement" and
"the highest woman leader in
the Southern Christian Leader
ship Conference, which Martin
Luther King headed."
Cotton has come to Stanford
to work on a book about her
experiences in the movement
and will also speak as a part of
Women's Herstory Month.
She was first introduced to
Stanford by History Prof. Clay
borne Carson, director of the
Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers
Project. Carson invited her to
Stanford for a week last summer
to survey the project's work, and
then offered her the opportunity
to return as a visiting scholar.
During an interview, she
wore a colorful, flowered silk
skirt and blouse, and a gently
encouraging smile. She turned
from her tiny portable computer
to speak in a smooth southern
accent about her life and the
book she is writing about it.
She said being a member of
King's group was one of the most
powerful experiences of her life.
"We were out in the trench
es, running from the dogs and
firehoses," she said. But the
effect of the adversity was to
boost the group's camaraderie.
"We became like a little family,"
Cotton said. "We had to be."
King was a great influence on
the group's closeness. "He was a
fun person to be with and work
with," Cotton said. Easygoing
and friendly, he was "the life of
the party. He loved to tell jokes."
Cotton and King met for the
first time when he came to help
with a boycott in Petersburg,
Virginia, where she lived. The
boycott was a protest against a
policy that forbade black people
from using the library.
"Each night we had mass
meetings," she said. In these

Dorothy Cotton, once a leader in the Southern Christian Leader
ship Conference headed by Martin Luther King, is now visiting
Stanford. She will use her time here to prepare a book on her
experiences in the civil rights movement and to speak as part of
Women's Herstory Month.
meetings they sang, read poetry
and prayed before discussing the
day's protest. This mix of enter
tainment, business and spirituali
ty is typical of black culture,
according to Cotton.
At a dinner after one of the
meetings, King invited Cotton
and others to his headquarters in
Atlanta, so that they could help
him organize the Montgomery
bus boycott.
"I said 'OK, I'll go for six
months,' " she remembers. "And
I stayed in Atlanta for 23 years."
The group King invited to
Atlanta gave birth to the SCLC,
the key organization of the civil
rights movement. Cotton looks
back on that time as the "most
pervasive experience."
But, she admitted, "we didn't
think we were doing anything so
important. I still pinch myself."
As part of King's close circle,
Burns said, Cotton was involved
with putting the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act
of 1965 into effect. Her work also
focused on making "black people
feel self-esteem and self-respect,"
he said.
Cotton stayed with the SCLC
after King's death until 1972,
when she took a position in the
Head Start preschool program in
Birmingham.
Even though King was a very
important personality in her life,
Cotton made it clear that the book
she is writing is not about him.
She said the focus of her book

will emerge later, but she hopes to
describe "the culture of the civil
rights movement as I experienced
it — my personal story."
Cotton said it is helpful not
only to have the support of gradu
ate students and the King papers
to do research, but to have Car
son, "who really knows the move
ment," to stimulate her ideas.
"He can get me to talk about
things I've forgotten," she said.
Burns said most scholars,
when they examine the civil
rights movement, "just look at
laws." But he said "a lot was
accomplished that was less tangi
ble," including efforts sponsored
by Cotton to encourage black peo
ple to feel more valuable as a
member of society.
During the 19605, Cotton said,
people "were programmed to
think they were less than other
people."
The goal of the Citizenship
Education Program, an organiza
tion that Cotton directed early in
the civil rights movement, was to
teach people who had been disen
franchised "how to un-brainwash
themselves and remove the
scars," Cotton said. It aimed at
convincing people that "they had
a right to have a voice" in politics.
"We like to say that the Citi
zenship Education Program was
the base for the civil rights move
ment," Cotton said, adding that
"we're seeing the results of it"
today, with thousands of black
officeholders where before there
were none.
Cotton said she believes there
is still much to be done in promot
ing citizenship for all races. "We
have abdicated our responsibility

six months." And I

23 years.'

that we have government of the
people, by the people and for the
people," she said.
She lamented that too many
people feel their input doesn't
matter and that committees and
special interest groups control
government. It is important to
remember, she said, that "we the
people send elected officials to
these high places."
To remedy this apathy, Cotton
said "people need to be a part of
the debate," rather than letting
the media focus on minor issues
like a candidate's personal life.
She suggests a first step would be
"a place on the local level where
people can hang out and discuss
politics."
Cotton, who has been active in
the Atlanta chapter of the Nation
al Organization for Women, also
conducts workshops on women's
issues and the women's move
ment. Women's issues are at a
crossroads, Cotton said, where
"things aren't what they used to
be, but they're also not what
they're going to be."
"Women need freedom from
oppressive domesticity," she said,
but cannot "abandon that arena.
At the same time, she said,
men need to "fully accept their
part in the nurturing."
Cotton has been working as an

independent consultant since she
resigned her position of nine
years as the director of student
activities at Cornell last May.
She said she had been receiving
numerous invitations to do work
shops in non-violent conflict reso
lution and other areas, and was
simply "enjoying that more. I felt
called to do this work full time,
and I responded to the call. It feels
right."
She will speak as a part of
Women's Herstory Month activi
ties on March 5, giving a presen
tation titled "Songs and Stories
from the Civil Rights Movement."
Bums describes her as "a great
storyteller." He added, "She's
lived a very rich and full life."
Just as in the time of the civil
rights movement, Cotton plans to
include singing in her presenta
tion.
As a part of her speech, she will
incorporate songs she learned as a
song leader in the civil rights
movement. Cotton cautioned that
she is not a performer and has
never been trained, but said, "I
like to sing the freedom songs."
She said she hopes people will not
only listen, but sing along.
The Stanford Gospel Choir and
Everyday People will also per
form.
Songs and spirituality are
important parts of Cotton's life.
So is cooking. "I love to make
beautiful meals," she said. She
laughed, saying that one of her
friends gives this advice: "If
Dorothy invites you to dinner,
make sure you go."
Even if the food weren't good,
the conversation would make the
meal worth it.
