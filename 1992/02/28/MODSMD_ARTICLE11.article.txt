# Financial aid budget to increase next year
## 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
The number of students receiving financial
aid grants will increase by 20 to 25 students
because of next year's tuition hike, according to
Robert Huff, director of the Financial Aids Office.
In addition, the University will reduce the
self-help component for all students on finan
cial aid. To make these changes, the Universi
ty will add $2.5 million to the financial aid
budget, Huff said.
The office's budget had originally been slat
ed for cuts of $2.5 million over four years, but
when the University announced the 9.5 per
cent tuition hike Feb. 12, it also decided to
increase financial aid funding.
About $600,000 of the $2.5 million increase

will be used "to reduce students' self help," Huff
said, adding that students with the highest level
of self-help will get the largest reduction.
Student leaders questioned some of Huff's
estimates yesterday, as well as whether the
rise in financial aid will be sufficient to meet
increased need.
Senior Vince Ricci, director of the ASSU
Financial Aid Advocacy Office, said: "I trust
Dr. Huff and his staff to make calculations to
the best of their ability." But "their crystal
ball is not reliable," he added.
Ricci said he is concerned because the
future of the economy is hard to predict. If it
gets worse, he said the financial resources of
students' parents could decline significantly.
Council of Presidents member Beth Mor
gan said, "They'll bring down self-help, which

is a great service to students." But students
whose financial resources are just above the
level required to get financial aid "will still
have great trouble coming here," she said.
Morgan said the loss of even one student who
is academically qualified but financially unable
to come to Stanford would be "a true shame."
"This university was founded as a free uni
versity and to now say that students can't
come here because they can't afford it... is a
real hardship for the University," she said.
The Financial Aids Office is still trying to
increase its revenue by $1 million this year
through changes in the way financial need is
calculated, as well as ensuring that all stu
dents eligible for Cal grants get them. This
move was initially designed to reduce the Uni
versity's contribution to financial aid.
