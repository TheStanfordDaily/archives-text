U.S. to Mobutu: Watch it
KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) — The top U.S. official for Africa gave
President Mobutu Sese Seko what amounted to a warning against
attacks on anti-government protesters yesterday.
Church leaders plan an anti-government march Sunday. On Feb.
16, Mobutu's presidential guard opened fire on demonstrators, killing
at least 32 people, according to the Zaire Human Rights League.
Protesters were demanding the government reconvene a
national conference on democracy to end Mobutu's 28 years of
corrupt and brutal rule. The government suspended the confer
ence last month after the opposition took control of the meeting.
The U.S. statement came during a visit with Mobutu by Assis
tant Secretary of State Herman Cohen, who said he had come to
avert "a great catastrophe."
Articles on prostitution lead to crack down
SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) — Police said yesterday they were
cracking down on the owners of seedy bars and nightclubs who
lure teen-age girls to the gold mining regions of Brazil's northern
jungle, then force them into prostitution.
Federal police spokesman Joao Martins said several nightclub
owners have been arrested and many of the girls had been
returned home by state and federal police.
The crackdown followed a series of articles in the Fojha de Sao
Paulo newspaper that said hundreds of poor girls, many as young
as 13, have been lured from their homes with promises of well
paying jobs in shops and restaurants.
When they arrive at villages near the mines, they are taken to
nightclubs and forced into a vicious cycle of near-slavery; forced to
prostitute themselves to pay for room and board, transportation,
medicine and their clothes and perfume, the newspaper reported.
It said the girls are often beaten, tortured and sometimes killed
if they try to escape.
