## Wage war on waste 
### 
Use inevitable leftovers
for compost and to feed
needy through SPOON

IN THESE FINANCIALLY
troubled times, both in this
area and around the country, it
is shameful how much food dormi
tories and other types of student
housing waste every day.
Ask any Food Service hasher—
they know how much food is scraped
off plates, dumped out of bowls and
poured from glasses. They also see
the numerous Food Service "experi
ments" that go virtually uneaten.
There are good moral, financial
and environmental reasons to be
upset with this situation.
The dumping of uneaten pre
pared food is tragic. Students often
take more than they will eat, leaving
far too much. Als£>, it is impossible
for Food Services to anticipate what
students will and will not eat —
they must always make extra, just
to be sure. Although the leftovers
are usually re-heated and re-served,
there are only so many possible tries
before the food is thrown away.
leftover beef Stroganoff, while it
may be rejected by students who
also can choose from an assortment
of newly-prepared dishes, is a full
meal for other, less fortunate people.
Every tray of food tossed into the
dumpster could have fed people who
are homeless and hungry instead.
With the current recession, the
number of these individuals is on
the rise and there is an even
greater need for donated food to
meet the new demand.
The excuse that it is too difficult
to donate this food should no
longer be tolerated. The Stanford
Project on Nutrition will pick up
useable food and take it to a shel
ter or soup kitchen.
In addition, Food Service and Row
houses should keep track of how
many dishes they dump and how
many they donate to SPOON. They
should make it an ongoing competi

tion with each other. If anything, this
should make them a bit more effi
cient and would certainly be a wind
fall for soup kitchens and shelters.
Cutting down on waste would
also have its financial rewards. On
one hand, food service has had prob
lems keeping its head above water.
On the other hand, disgruntled stu
dents complain that they are forced
to pay a board plan that costs twice
as much as they would spend if they
cooked for themselves.
Food Service must pay for the
food that students throw out after
every meal. In order not to loose
money, they build the cost of the
wasted food into the board plans.
At the end of every meal, the tray
racks and conveyor belts carry
away hundreds of dollars.
If students want to keep board
bills down, they must take what
they'll eat and eat what they take.
To make people aware of how
much food they waste every week,
Food Service could place a garbage
can by the conveyor belts, trash
cans, sinks and racks. Students
would dump their wasted food in
this can and let it accumulate for a
week. At the end of the week, the
weight of the contents would let
everyone know how many pounds
of food they have paid to toss out.
Even the way Food Service deals
with waste could be changed to
make use of the unavoidable
scraps that are tossed out.
Food waste is an excellent natu
ral fertilizer; just ask the residents
of any co-operative. They are quite
willing to put up with the ridicule
they sometimes receive because
they maintain compost heaps.
They put all of their uneaten veg
etable material in a large garbage
can, or in a pile outside, and let it
decompose. They then put it back in
the earth— thus fertilizing a new
crop of vegetables that they will eat.
In the course of preparing food
for an entire house or dorm, there
will always be unused or uneaten
vegetable material. A compost
heap is a much more productive
use for this material than
throwing it away.
