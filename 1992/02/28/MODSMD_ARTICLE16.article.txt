Betas who stayed in fraternity chanyed it for the better

WE BELIEVE THAT OMAR
Wasow's column in yesterday's
Daily misrepresents both the
events that occurred over two years ago
and the current living conditions in the
Beta House.
He suggests that during his stay 34
people were under the direct control of
four house officers — this was certainly
not the case. Wasow refuses to accept
the fact that many other people living in
the house, including his peers whose
views he respected, simply did not agree
with all aspects of his political agenda.
As Wasow wrote, "... few other men
were seriously interested in redefining
Betas as I had envisioned . .." This is
much closer to the truth. His frequent

use of the word "demanded" in the col
umn is indicative of the attitude he
adopted, and the difficulty we experienced
in accommodating some of his ideas.
The house certainly benefited from
the discussions that were prevalent
throughout that year. Members decided
that several of the traditions, including
the one so graphically described in
Wasow's column, were unacceptable and
that they should be abolished.
However, other traditions were kept
and new ones begun that continue to
have meaning for us. While Wasow
describes the year as a series of moral
outrages, many of us found much that
was valuable and rewarding.
It is unfortunate that Wasow has had

no contact with the Beta House since his
departure two years ago. Those of us who
have remained committed to the house
are extremely proud of its development.
For instance, many women have com
mented that they feel particularly com
fortable "hanging out" in the Beta
House. Also, we nave nurtured tradi
tions such as hosting a Halloween Party
in cooperation with the local Big Broth
ers/Big Sisters organization and partici
pation in Stanford Special Olympics.
Thursday Bar Nights, seemingly a
playground for homophobia and sexism,
according to Wasow, are actually valu
able and rare opportunities for all Stan
ford students to interact in a relaxed and
familiar setting.

Wasow, it is ironic that in your clos
ing comments you deride us because of
our pride in our group affiliation while
you yourself identify very closely with
the black and Jewish communities.
Just as we would never attempt to
devalue your affiliation, we refuse to
allow you to devalue ours. Your personal
"great revolution" at the Beta House
may have failed miserably, but, like all
great evolutions, ours is progressing
gradually.
