# Colleagues wrong on Perlroth's discipline
## 
### 
In their letter in the Feb. 18 issue of
The Daily, three friends and colleagues
of Dr. Mark Perlroth sought to put their
own "spin" on the resolution of the dis
ciplinary charges brought against him.
For instance, they suggested, incor
rectly, that the discipline imposed con
sisted solely of a letter of censure. As
noted in the public statement that was
part of the very agreement to which they
alluded, "the resolution includes disci
plinary measures that are contained in a
letter of censure" (emphasis added.)
The facts remain that Perlroth has
been disciplined based on the charges
brought by University President Donald
Kennedy last June; that disciplinaiy
measures were taken and remain confi
dential; that the two students involved
reviewed and approved the details of the
resolution; and that Perlroth has pub
licly apologized to the students.
