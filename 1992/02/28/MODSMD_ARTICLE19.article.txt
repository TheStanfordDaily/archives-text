## Toward a peaceful Croatia 
### 
SLOVENIA'S AND CROATIA'S
drive toward independence has been
far too costly.
The New York Times estimates that the
conflict in Croatia has resulted in almost
10,000 deaths and countless displacements.
Skirmishes heightened into a full-blown
conflict when the Serbian-dominated
Yugoslav Federal Army began attacking
Croatia to "protect" the Serbian minorities.
The international community has shud
dered with horror at the massacre of Croa
tian civilians at Vocin and the equally trag
ic murder of Serbian civilians elsewhere.
Why has this violence occurred and
who is responsible? The Yugosav Federal
Army seems the most guilty for the high
toll of death and destruction. But view
points vary, even among those interested
in the conflict here at Stanford.
Wolfgang Palaver, an Austrian theolo
gian at the Center for International Secu
rity and Arms Control at Stanford,
believes that this conflict has blurred the
lines of guilt and innocence. He under
lined the importance of scrutinizing both
sides' claims of self-determination.
While Croatians have sought an inde
pendent state, the Serbians in the Kraji
na region of Croatia — where they form a
large segment of the population — advo
cate links with Serbia.
Palaver suggested studying alterna
tive outlets of self-determination before
moving toward independence, which he

sees as a "potentially dangerous prece
dent." He said he would encourage a
relaxation of borders throughout Europe,
a move he believes would calm tensions.
"Had there been fair treatment of
Croatians and a respect for justice and
human rights by the central authorities,
nationalistic feelings never would have
exploded into such violence," he added.
Palaver noted that while the Croatian
conflict has received large publicity,
other civil wars in places like Somalia and
Sudan have been given scant attention.
A Croatian student at Stanford, speak
ing on the condition of anonymity,
expressed his horror at the violence. He
said he never dreamed it would be so
massive. He has been disappointed by the
European Economic Community's lack
of action early on in the conflict, which he
sees as fundamentally an "unfair fight."
He pointed out that it took Germany's
recognition of Croatian independence to
convince the Federal Army to suspend
their massive bombing of Croatia and to
accept the cease-fire sponsored by the
United Nations.
Graduate student Charlie Galunic, a
Canadian national originally from Croat
ia, agreed. However, he emphasized the
economic factors of the conflict.
The standard of living has plummeted
due to the war. Originally, the ideal solu
tion to the conflict would have been fed
eration and free trade between Croatia

The Yugoslav
Federal Army
seems the
most guilty
for the high
toll of
destruction/

and Serbia, he said.
Galunic now hopes for Croatian and
Serbian admission into the EEC and eco
nomic security. Only then can their pop
ulations live in peace.
Both he and Palaver see the war as the
result of deep-rooted hatred coupled with
two legitimate concerns pushed to the
extreme.
All three condemned the massive dis
placement of civilians and agreed that the
Yugoslav Federal Army is guilty of wides
pead destruction throughout Croatia,
including the famous historic city of
Dubrovnik, a place without a substantial
Serbian population.
They hope that the presence of the
United Nations in Croatia will bring
peace, but they are skeptical about the
parties' trust in each other and the abate
ment of long-lasting hatred.
Throughout the world, the affirma
tion of ethnic and cultural identities, tol
erance and democratic principles must be
given a new thrust to establish norms
agreeable to those who will be subject to
them.
