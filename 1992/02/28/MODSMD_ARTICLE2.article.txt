Two men arrested by Stanford
Police on charges of breaking into
cars in Governor's Corner are
being held in connection with a
separate investigation of an
attempted murder and armed
robbery in Menlo Park Monday.
Matthew Mac Donald, 20, a res
ident of Menlo Park, confessed to
the foiled armed robbery under
the "skillful interrogation" of Sgt.
John McMullen, said Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
The other suspect is a 17-year
old currently being held in San
Mateo County Juvenile Hall.
At 9:30 p.m. Monday, Mac Do
nald and the 17-year-old allegedly
attempted to rob the director of a
driving school at Nealand Park
Community Center in Menlo Park.
Niemeyer said Mac Donald was
armed with a broken gun and the
juvenile had a .22 pistol.
The director of the driving
school escaped with the school's
money when his girlfriend arrived
and the two drove away in her car.
The 17-year-old shot at the car,
shattering a window, Niemeyer
said.
The 17-year-old was arrested
Tuesday morning along with two
other men, Jake Rin of East Palo
Alto and Jeremy Salcedo of Menlo

Park, for allegedly breaking into
cars in the Governor's Corner
parking lot and stealing stereo
equipment.
Mac Donald, who police said
was also involved in the car bur
glary, was not caught at the time.
However, he left his car in the
Governor's Corner parking lot
and police traced it to him.
Police arrested Mac Donald
Wednesday afternoon when he
came to the station to retrieve his
car, Niemeyer said.
Niemeyer said police suspected
Mac Donald of more serious
crimes than burglary when they

discovered two ski masks and an
automatic pistol in the trunk of
his car.
Although Mac Donald was
informed of his Miranda rights,
he "agreed to talk to us in the
absence of a lawyer," Niemeyer
said.
Speculating as to why Mac-
Donald confessed, Niemeyer sug
gested that "he felt that he need
ed to tell somebody about what
they did."
Mac Donald, who has a previ
ous criminal record, is being held
in the North County Jail in Palo
Alto.
