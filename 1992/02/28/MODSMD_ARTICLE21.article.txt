## Keefe ties his career-best 36 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
After Sunday's heartbreaking loss to USC in Los
Angeles, the Cardinal needed a victory badly. And
who better to provide the impetus for it than All-
America forward Adam Keefe?
As the Cardinal started faltering on its 20-point
lead, the 6-9 senior from Irvine, Calif., took the
game against visiting Washington into his own
hands, pulling down rebounds on the defensive end
of the floor, and calling for the ball inside on
offense.
"Washington started off the game in zones, and
Adam got a little distracted," Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery said. "But once they went man-to
man, they became the aggressor. Keefe answered
the bell for us and came through for us as he has all
season."
Keefe rang the bell in the scoring column for 36
points, shooting 14-for-24 from the field. His scoring
mark tied his career-high which he set earlier this
year in Maples against Virginia.
"I think the reason that I got 36 was because I
was concentrating on my shot," Keefe said. "I'm
happy we won, but I didn't think that I played a good
game ... it was almost as if it was last year with
Andrew (Vlahov) as the team guy and me as the
scorer. I didn't play well in the team concept."
Yet Keefe did what was needed for the team. The
young Cardinal needed someone to take charge, and
as the team leader, Keefe was the man to get the job
done. Keefe continually frustrated Husky freshman
Mark Pope with a barrage of power moves, manag
ing to score even when he was triple-teamed.
"Pope kind of pissed me off by hitting me with his
third elbow in two games," Keefe commented. "He's
a freshman and shouldn't be doing that, and that
kind of got me going."
In addition to his scoring, Keefe grabbed 12
boards, six on each end of the floor.
"Keefe did what he does best," said Washington
coach Lynn Nance. "They (Stanford) had to go to
Adam. Their perimeter game wasn't working, so he
did what senior players are supposed to do in those
situations."
"It's nice to have the ball in your hands when you
want it there," Keefe said. "The guys were passing it
very well. I'm a senior and I've been here four years,
so I feel in those situations that I should get the ball."
