### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Hail to the Six-Pac! At last, the regular season opens for the Stan
ford baseball team as the Cardinal travels to Tempe for a weekend
series against the Arizona State Sun Devils. Going into the trio of
conference games, the Cardinal is 12-5 and ranked fifth in the
nation by Baseball America, while the Sun Devils are rated 13th.
And these rankings bring up an interesting question here at
the beginning of conference play. For years, Six-Pac teams have
dominated college baseball. In the 44 years of the College World
Series, Six-Pac teams have won 22 titles, including a record 11 by
Southern Cal. However, since 1990, the Southeastern Conference
has emerged as a new super-conference, and have won the last
two CWS's. Which is better?
"Obviously, I'm prejudiced," said Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess, "but I think we have the toughest conference."
"There's no doubt that the SEC is the toughest conference in
the country," Tennessee coach Rod Delmonico said.
And it is very close this year. Of the 12 teams in the SEC, six are
ranked in the top 30 by either Baseball America or Collegiate Base
ball, with No. 1 Florida, No. 4 Mississippi State (who have yet to
play a game), No. 10 Louisiana State, No. 14 South Carolina, No.
25 Georgia and No. 29 Alabama. All six of the teams in the Six-Pac
are also ranked, with No. 5 Stanford, No. 13 Arizona State, No. 18
California and Arizona, No. 23 USC, and No. 26 UCLA.
"The Six-Pac is a tough conference because generally each club
has three or four guys who have an awfully good chance to play in
the big leagues," said Arizona State head coach Jim Brock. "Major
league prospects don't really stand out in our conference because
there are so many of them."
And coach Brock definitely has his share of pro prospects.
Heading the list is Doug Newstrom, who not only at last check
had a .458 batting average, but also a 3.66 ERA with 18 strikeouts
as a pitcher. Junior center fielder Todd Steverson (.289 average,
10 home runs, 50 RBI last year) is another headliner, who report
edly has amazing potential. Shortstop Kurt Ehmann (.331, 3, 39),
and outfielders Scott Samuels (.299, 9, 39) and Brett Weinberger
(currently hitting .409) round out the hitting corps.
The Cardinal is coming off an impressive preseason where it
went 6-3 against ranked opponents, including a three-game sweep
of then fourth-ranked Pepperdine. Indeed, the preseason bodes
well for the Six-Pac as a whole, as the ranked teams have 58 wins
(against very tough opposition) as contrasted to 31 wins for the
SEC. And with the regular season poised to begin, Stanford is out
to show that not only are they the class of the Six-Pac, but of the
nation as well.
