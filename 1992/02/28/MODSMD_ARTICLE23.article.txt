# Card shoots down Washington by 12
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
In the first of four must-wins
at Maples Pavilion, Stanford
ambushed Washington 40-20 in
the first 13 minutes then safely
retreated to a 78-66 victory.
Coupled with an 80-72 Oregon
State upset of Arizona State,
Stanford (15-8, 7-6) is again alone
in fourth in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence and back on track for the
NCAA Tournament. The Cardi
nal hosts fifth-place Washington
State (19-8, 7-7) Sunday at 3 p.m.
in another must-win situation.
After a crushing overtime
defeat at USC Saturday, Stanford
circled the team wagon and came
out blazing against the Huskies.
Three-point sharpshooter Peter
Dukes scored eight points to lift
Stanford to a 40-20 lead with six
minutes and 47 seconds left in the
first half. The Cardinal ran short
of ammunition in the second half
(36 percent shooting), but the
Huskies never got closer than six
points.
"Well, we saw some wounded
psyches. We came out well and
wanted to play, but we just
couldn't sustain it," Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said.
"Once Washington got back in
the game, they played very well."
Adam Keefe tied a career-high
with 36 points and Marcus Lollie
tallied 12 points and eight assists
as Stanford survived down the
stretch. The victory was Stan
ford's sixth straight against
Washington at Maples and
assured the Cardinal of its sixth
consecutive winning season.
Washington cut the lead to 55-
49 on a baseline jump-hook from
center Rich Manning, but Lollie

'We just really needed
a win tonight. The
kids have suffered and
we need to get our
selves some confi
dence.'
— Mike Montgomery

answered with a trey and then
Keefe took over the fight. The
next six minutes he scored all of
Stanford's 14 points as the lead
ricocheted back to 14 points. Lol
lie added three free throws to get
Stanford safely to Sunday.
"We just really needed a win
tonight," Montgomery said. "The
kids have suffered and we need to
get ourselves some confidence."
With wins against WSU, Ore
gon and Oregon State in its
remaining home games, Stanford
will be difficult to catch. Arizona
State (6-7) would have to beat
Stanford next Thursday at home,
then win at either No. 4 UCLA or
No. 13 USC. Washington State,
meanwhile, would have to sweep
USC, UCLA and Washington in
Pullman. Oregon State (6-8)
needs to beat No. 5 Arizona Sat
urday to get back in the fourth
place picture.
Washington State beat Stan
ford 67-59 earlier this year in
Pullman as the Cardinal shot just
39 percent from the floor and
didn't get the ball to Keefe when
it counted. The Cougars beat Cal
ifornia last night at Berkeley and
are looking for their first 20-win
season since Lewis and Clark mis
takenly discovered Pullman.
