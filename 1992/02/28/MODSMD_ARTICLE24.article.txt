# Cagers fall to A-State under 'press'ure
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
Last night the Stanford women's basket
ball team learned the meaning of the phrase
"the quick and the dead," after Arizona
State's quicker lineup pressed the Cardinal
offense into oblivion, 77-65.
Stanford, ranked No. 5 nationally, played
like a team without a future, all but forfeiting
its chance at a No. 1 seeding in the NCAA
tournament. In handing over the ball 24
times to the Sun Devil press, the Cardinal
handed over the game, as well.
Arizona State, on the other hand, after
finishing at or near the bottom of the Pacific
10 Conference for several years, improved its
chances to move up from fourth place and in
the process virtually assured itself of an
NCAA tournament berth.
It was the first time that Stanford had

faced a full-court press since an upset by Ore
gon State on Feb. 6, and it was the first time
the Cardinal had lost since that date.
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer said sev
eral days ago that breaking the full-court
press has been a problem this year. "This
team lacks the hustle factor," she noted.
And until the Cardinal finds the will to
assert that factor, "There is no Final Four
without it," she said.
There will be no more wins for Stanford,
either, until the team can solve the full-court
press. After this game, every team in the
country which might possibly face Stanford
this year will be practicing its press.
"It really should play into our hands,"
VanDerveer said, "because we want to run."
But without an effective press-breaker,
there is no running. Against the Sun Devils,
Stanford either found itself giving the ball to
its opponent, or setting up its half-court

offense, which is not the team's strength.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal could have won
yesterday's game if it had executed its half
court set better.
Although neither team shot well from the
field (both hitting for 37 percent), the Sun
Devils demolished Stanford on the boards
and shot 83.3 percent from the free throw
line — 20 percent higher than the team's
season average.
The Cardinal will face a weaker Arizona
team tomorrow at 6 p.m. However, the Wild
cats' first-year coach Joan Bonvicini has gen
erated excitement in Tucson over the
women's game, as they have drawn crowds of
four or five thousand on occasion this season
— impressive for the 10th place team in the
Pac-10.
"They're the kind of team that will lose,
lose, lose, and then —BOOM — they get real
ly up for one game," VanDerveer said.
