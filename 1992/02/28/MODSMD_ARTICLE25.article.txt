The Stanford women's tennis team can
breathe a collective sigh of relief.
The No. 5 Cardinal survived a 5-3 nailbiter
against No. 14 Indiana to advance to the sec
ond round of the National Team Indoor
Championships.
Kylie Johnson and Emma Woodhouse
nipped Rachel Epstein and Jody Yin in the
No. 2 doubles slot to clinch the match for
Stanford. The Cardinal duo took the first set
6-4 but fell down a break in the second. The
tandem pulled even and took the set to a
tiebreaker, which the pair won 7-6(7-5).
"Both teams played really well," Stanford
coach Frank Brennan said. "It was a matter
of us rising to the occasion."
The Cardinal tallied four victories in sin
gles. Laxmi Poruri and Kristine Kurth over
came erratic first sets to win their matches.
"(In the first set) they were missing in gener
al, making a lot of errors," Brennan said.
Poruri survived several match points to
earn the 3-6, 7-6(7-5), 6-4 victory. Kurth
edged Susie Starrett by a 3-6, 7-5,6-3 margin.

At No. 1 singles, Heather Willens scraped
by Deborah Edelman 6-4, 7-6(7-4). Notching
the only blowout for Stanford, Woodhouse
mastered Epstein 6-2, 6-1.
The two losses came at No. 3 and No. 6 sin
gles. Indiana's Jody Yin defeated Kylie John
son 6-4, 6-1 and Danielle Paradine beat Amy
Chiminello 6-2, 6-0.
"Amy didn't play too well. She was making
errors and making them too soon. She didn't
give her opponent time to make errors,"
Brennan said. "She was embarrassed about
how she played. She's a good player so that's
the right reaction."
Chiminello rebounded in doubles as she
and Kurth were up a set when Johnson and
Woodhouse ended the match with the Cardi
nal's fifth victory. Third-ranked Poruri and
Willens lost to fifth-ranked Edelman and
Reece 6-3, 7-5.
Stanford faces No. 6 Duke today. The Blue
Devils beat William and Mary yesterday 5-1.
Brennan expects the close contests with the
Hoosiers will help the team against a tough
Duke squad. However, he anticipates another
nailbiter. "They're a good, solid team," he
said. "I don't think we'll win it in singles."
