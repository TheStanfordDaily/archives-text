# Road to Barcelona begins in Indy for swimmers
## 
### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
After a season full of one-sided vic
tories, the women's swimming team
will face its greatest challenge of the
season over the next several days. The
Stanford swimmers will spend the
first six days of Mareh vying for a spot
in Barcelona, as Olympic trials begin
this Sunday.
"I'm feeling very nervous, but I'm
also really excited," junior Anne
Mahoney said. Mahoney will race
Tuesday in the 100 backstroke.
"I remember last time, everyone
told me, 'Oh, Anne, I know you're dis
appointed, but four years isn't that
long,'" said Mahoney, recalling
Olympic trials in 1988, "I'm relieved

that it's finally here."
Senior Karen Kraemer, who also
went to Olympic trials four years ago,
has memories of that experience.
"In 1988, our club team sent about
five people to Olympic trials, and this
year, we have 17 or 18," she commented.
"It's great to be part of a team like this."
Kraemer will be competing in the
200 freestyle and the 200 individual
medley despite the fact that she has
competed for the most part in longer
races this year.
"I've been swimming distance
mostly because we needed distance
swimmers," she said, "but I'm more of
a short-distance swimmer."
When asked about the potential dif
ficulties of participating in the trials
only a few weeks before the NCAA

Championships, Kraemer acknowl
edged the challenge.
"It could be difficult if people have a
disappointing meet (at Olympic trials)
and have to bounce back for NCAAs, but
we're trying to keep the team concept
this week," said Kramer, alluding to the
fact that most of Stanford's women
swimmers will be participating in
Olympic Trials. "Having team support
takes off a lot of individual pressure."
Summer Sanders and Jenny
Thompson, each competing in four
events, stand to face the most pres
sure.
Sanders will be competing in the
100 and 200 butterfly and the 200 and
400 IM, while Thompson will swim the
50, 100 and 200 free and the 200 IM.
"Summer and Jenny have to be

looked on as favorites to make the
Olympic team, but there are no shoo
ins," Kraemer said.
Other Stanford swimmers with the
best chances to represent the USA in
Barcelona are Lori Heisick, Janel Jor
gensen and Lea Loveless.
Most of the other Stanford swim
mers feel that, although they must
have outstanding days to qualify,
making the Olympics is well within
their grasp.
"I can't control what others do,"
Mahoney said, "but if I swim my best,
then I have a really good chance."
"I'm not going in thinking that I
have an outstanding chance to make
it," Kraemer said, "but if I go and have
a great day, then anything can hap
pen."
