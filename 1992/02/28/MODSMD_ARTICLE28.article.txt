# Card faces SJSU

### Peter Marks Staff writer 
Despite losing by 55 points to Stanford's gym
nastics team last weekend, San Jose State keeps
coming back for more. The Spartans get a second
shot at the Cardinal Saturday night in San Jose.
Realizing that a home-court advantage can only
go so far, Stanford coach Sadao Hamada said he will
not put his strongest team together against the
Spartans. Instead, Hamada will use his top gym
nasts sparingly while giving younger team mem
bers a chance to gain tournament experience.
However, the Cardinal will turn up its intensity
the following weekend in the UC-Santa Barbara
Invitational. This tournament begins a grueling
series of matchups for Stanford that culminates at
the NCAA Championships in April.
The new NCAA rankings place Stanford third in
the nation behind Nebraska and Ohio State, respec
tively. In the individual disciplines, the Cardinal
ranks first in the pommel horse and parallel bars.
"I was surprised because we haven't put a really
strong team together," Hamada said. "I expected
fifth or sixth."
The rankings were particularly encouraging
because, according to Hamada, Nebraska and Ohio
have competed at full strength for the past six
weeks. Last week Hamada said his club was operat
ing at only 30 percent power.
Stanford normally averages around 283 points
by the end of the season but already posted a score
of 283.55 at California Feb. 15.
With two months left in the season, Stanford is
gunning for 290 points. In order for that to happen,
the Cardinal must improve its scores in the rings
and vaulting competitions. Jason Cohen's return
from injury will increase the team scores in these
disciplines, Hamada noted.
