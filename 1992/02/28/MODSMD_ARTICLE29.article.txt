# Women battle Cal, Sac State
## 
### Brandi Shipp Staff writer 
What do you call a young gymnastics team
who, despite having won just a few meets, are sure
to leave a mark on the women's collegiate gym
nastics scene this year? You call them persistent,
powerful, and you call them the Cardinal.
Once again, the Stanford women's gymnastics
team puts on the gloves as they prepare to duke
it out this evening in a three-way meet at Burn
ham Pavilion. Although both of the evening's
contenders, Sacramento State and California,
are no easy match, the Stanford women hope to
be standing tall and victorious at the final bell.
It will be anything but a quick fight, however.
"Cal will be a very strong competitor," assistant
coach Lisa Mitzel-Izzi said. "Although it is hard
to compare two different teams when they are
not in the same meet on the same night, we know
that it is going to be a challenge."
Unfortunately, the Cardinal will not have use
of all of its fighting power to punch back at full
strength. In a continuous effort for improve
ment, a few members of the team have been
injured, forcing the Cardinal to make some
changes in the line-up.
Junior Erin McCann is completely out of the
evening's competition with what appears to be a
bruised tailbone, while freshman Tina Snowden
will probably not compete on beam, after injur
ing her foot in practice.
