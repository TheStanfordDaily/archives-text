The Graduate School of Busi
ness will study the possibility of
making significant changes to its
core curriculum, Dean Michael
Spence announced yesterday
afternoon.
Responding to a "faculty man
date" last month, a recently creat
ed committee will consider "what
might be called radical changes,"
Spence said in separate speeches
to students and staff.
Proposals to be examined
include a slight reduction in the
number of core courses and the
establishment of some form of a
distribution requirement system.
Business students are current
ly required to take 13 core cours
es, such as accounting, economics
and organizational behavior.
But in January, the faculty
voted to reduce the number of
core courses for next year to 11. A
human resources management

course will be added to the core
for 1993-94.
Assoc. Dean Charles Bonini
said the changes will "allow us to
spread out a little bit and provide
flexibility in the courses students
take."
The January vote also reduced
the minimum number of courses
students must take in the Busi
ness School from 27 to 25, anoth
er change that will provide "more
flexibility to students," Bonini
said.
"Students can take more class
es outside the Business School,
such as language courses, or pur
sue a dual degree," Bonini said.
