# B-school courses may face revisions
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The Graduate School of Busi
ness will study the possibility of
making significant changes to its
core curriculum, Dean Michael
Spence announced yesterday
afternoon.
Responding to a "faculty man
date" last month, a recently creat
ed committee will consider "what
might be called radical changes,"
Spence said in separate speeches
to students and staff.
Proposals to be examined
include a slight reduction in the
number of core courses and the
establishment of some form of a
distribution requirement system.
Business students are current
ly required to take 13 core cours
es, such as accounting, economics
and organizational behavior.
But in January, the faculty
voted to reduce the number of
core courses for next year to 11. A
human resources management

course will be added to the core
for 1993-94.
Assoc. Dean Charles Bonini
said the changes will "allow us to
spread out a little bit and provide
flexibility in the courses students
take."
The January vote also reduced
the minimum number of courses
students must take in the Busi
ness School from 27 to 25, anoth
er change that will provide "more
flexibility to students," Bonini
said.
"Students can take more class
es outside the Business School,
such as language courses, or pur
sue a dual degree," Bonini said.
The core curriculum commit
tee, a permanent group to be


Michael Spence
chaired by Bonini, will "oversee
the courses and manage the evo
lutionary changes in the core,"
Spence said.
Business Prof. James Van
Home, a committee member, said
he sees it as having a two-fold
responsibility.
"We are to propose to the fac
ulty possible alternatives to what
is now the revised core ... and
coordinate the courses in the
future," Van Horne said. "The
first phase is obviously the more
important one."
Spence said the committee will
initially study many options,
ranging from a reduction of one
or two classes in the core to a
complete revision of the core sys
tem. It will make its recommen
dations to the faculty by spring
or, at the latest, early next fall.
The major change, which
Spence termed the "radical
option," is to reduce the core to
between four and six courses of
the "basic underlying disciplines"
and "build on top an elective
structure, maybe with distribu
tion requirements."
The committee has only met
once for a brief introduction, and

members declined to discuss
plans in any detail.
It would be "premature" to
comment on alternatives, Van
Home said. "There are both
advantages and disadvantages to
the proposals."
But Business Prof. V. Srini
vasan, who advocates the change,
said the "principal advantage is
that it gives students the choice of
what they want to learn as
opposed to what we force them to
take."
He said that because more stu
dents come into the Business
School with working experience,
"they are in a good position to fig
ure out what they can learn to
maximize what they can gain
[from] this institution."
A reduced core might require
four basic courses — economics,
organizational behavior, quanti
tative methods and accounting —
and a group of distribution
requirements from which stu
dents could pick four or five,
Srinivasan said.
"The limitation of such as pro
posal is that it might be possible
to come out of here without a
broad-based education, but I
think that it strikes a good bal
ance," he said. "The intention is
to have a core program that is not
'command economics,' but is
instead 'demand economics.' "
