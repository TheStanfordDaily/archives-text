Head volleyball coach Ruben
Nieves cites experience and matu
rity as key factors in his team's abil
ity to win in pressure situations,
but Nieves got a pleasant surprise
Wednesday at California when he
gave his veterans a night off.
A group of reserves which
included four freshmen seized the
opportunity, pulling off a tense
five-game victory in a non-league
match against the Golden Bears,

15-3, 8-15,17-15, 8-15,15-10.
Although they struggled
throughout the match, Nieves was
pleased with his squad's clutch
play.
"We had committed ourselves
before the match to not bringing in
our starters," Nieves explained.
"We stuck to our guns, and they
pulled it out."
Starting at middle blocker,
Freshman Brian Garrett took on
the leading role for the Card. "Gar
rett had the most dominant hit
ting and blocking on either side of

the net," Nieves said.
Another bright spot was the
play of David Fischer, a red-shirt
freshman. Fischer made his debut
as a swing hitter, a position that
entails extensive defensive respon
sibilities. According to Nieves, Fis
cher's passing allowed Stanford to
execute their offense.
Cal, a club team, suffered a
three-game punishing from Stan
ford's first-string lineup earlier in
the season. At 10-2, the Cardinal
spikers are ranked second in the
nation.
