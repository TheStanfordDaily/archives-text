# Sexual harassment ruling is applauded
## Some worry it will lead to false claims 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Campus leaders said yesterday
that they support a Supreme
Court ruling allowing students to
sue schools for damages for sexual
harassment by faculty and staff.
But some said they feared peo
ple would abuse the ability to seek
damages — announced in a 9-to-0
decision Wednesday — by making
false accusations.
The ruling's implications "go
both ways," said Senior Universi
ty Counsel Michael Vartain.
"The allowable damages
encourage victims to come forward
and find legal counsel," he said.
"But they also at times encourage
attorneys of 'untrue' victims to
charge (sexual harassment) in
order to gain financial reward."
Senior Jennifer Pearson, a
member of the Women's Center

Collective, said she hopes the
precedent will "encourage Stan
ford to have more set sexual
harassment policies."
A University committee — con
sisting of several staff members
and administrators, including
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole
— is in the process of revising the
University's sexual harassment
and sexual assault policies.
Pearson said she thinks sexual
harassment is a problem at Stan
ford, based on her discussions
with students.
"I'm blown away by how many
times I've encountered cases of sex
ual harassment," she said. "Stan
ford needs to be held accountable
(for its employees' actions)."
She added that the financial
incentive would encourage more
victims to come forward and
could even make the process
more empowering and rewarding
for them.
University Ombudsperson Leah
Kaplan said that although sexual
harassment deserves attention, it
cannot "be legislated out of exis
tence — people are people."
Kaplan echoed Vartain's con
cern that although the ruling will
increase awareness, the "risk of
exploitation — falsely charging sex
uad harassment — is hazardous."
She said she deals with sexual
harassment victims on an "infor
mal and clinical basis." Many vic
tims come to Kaplan first to find
out what options exist, and she
helps them decide which course
of action to take.
With the new ruling, the Uni
versity will "have to be sure its
(sexual harassment) policy is
stated clearly" and must "address
itself to the problem of prevent
ing it," she said.
According to some faculty
members and administrators, the
University's policies already
reflect the strong anti-sexual
harassment stand of the ruling.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson said University employ
ees "hold themselves to high
standards."
"I would hope that all employ
ees would conduct themselves in
a way that they would never be
charged with harassment," Jack
son said. "They don't need this
ruling to tell them it's wrong."
