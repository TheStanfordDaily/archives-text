# COP to request tuition review
## 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
The Council of Presidents will
meet with University President
Donald Kennedy this morning to
demand that the Board of Trustees
promise to avoid increasing tuition
substantially in future years.
The COP will suggest funding
the proposed policy with money
generated by Stanford's $2 billion
endowment. The COP's proposal
would halve the amount of
endowment money used for
growth each year.
A draft of the letter the COP
will give to Kennedy asks for a
pledge from the Board of Trustees
to avoid substantially increasing
tuition unless it uses more of the
money generated by the endow
ment.
The Trustees decided Feb. 11
to raise tuition for next year by 9.5
percent — abandoning its two
year-old pledge to limit tuition
increases to 1 percent over infla
tion.
The COP's proposal would let
the Board increase tuition by
more than that amount only if
the endowment funds still do not
cover the budget deficit.
COP member John Overdeck
said that while he does not know
if it is reasonable to hope that the
University will back down on the
tuition hike, "they should." The
increase was "a terrible mistake,"
he said.
Kennedy, reached last night,
said he'll "be glad to hear their
arguments." But he added that
there is no chance that next year's
tuition increase will be rescinded.
The increase has not been set
for future years, he said, adding
that "if conditions turn favorable,
it might be a lbwer increase."
According to COP member
Beth Morgan, the COP's proposal
is "very reasonable and well
thought out." The COP hopes
Kennedy will recommend it at
Monday's Board meeting, she
added.
The proposal centers around
changing the payout rate — the
percentage of money the Univer
sity takes out of the endowment
each year — on the endowment.
