# COP to request tuition review
## 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
The Council of Presidents will
meet with University President
Donald Kennedy this morning to
demand that the Board of Trustees
promise to avoid increasing tuition
substantially in future years.
The COP will suggest funding
the proposed policy with money
generated by Stanford's $2 billion
endowment. The COP's proposal
would halve the amount of
endowment money used for
growth each year.
A draft of the letter the COP
will give to Kennedy asks for a
pledge from the Board of Trustees
to avoid substantially increasing
tuition unless it uses more of the
money generated by the endow
ment.
The Trustees decided Feb. 11
to raise tuition for next year by 9.5
percent — abandoning its two
year-old pledge to limit tuition
increases to 1 percent over infla
tion.
The COP's proposal would let
the Board increase tuition by
more than that amount only if
the endowment funds still do not
cover the budget deficit.
COP member John Overdeck
said that while he does not know
if it is reasonable to hope that the
University will back down on the
tuition hike, "they should." The
increase was "a terrible mistake,"
he said.
Kennedy, reached last night,
said he'll "be glad to hear their
arguments." But he added that
there is no chance that next year's
tuition increase will be rescinded.
The increase has not been set
for future years, he said, adding
that "if conditions turn favorable,
it might be a lbwer increase."
According to COP member
Beth Morgan, the COP's proposal
is "very reasonable and well
thought out." The COP hopes
Kennedy will recommend it at
Monday's Board meeting, she
added.
The proposal centers around
changing the payout rate — the
percentage of money the Univer
sity takes out of the endowment
each year — on the endowment.
That rate is now 4.75 percent.
But the University projects a 6.75
percent earning after inflation, so
the remaining 2 percent is a
"buffer zone" that allows for
growth, Morgan said.
Currently, the University budgets
that 2 percent for increasing en
dowed professorial salaries and sub

sidies to other programs, she said.
Morgan said the COP has cal
culated that its proposed change
would generate about $20 million
annually.
According to Overdeck, he sug
gested this figure to Provost James
Rosse and Rosse "didn't disagree."
Rosse was out of town yester
day and could not be reached for
comment.
The $20 million would be used
to keep tuition increases down in
the future, Morgan said, and also

help ease the budget deficit.
Budgeting for only 1 percent
real growth — as the COP propos
es—is "more realistic," Morgan
said. "We're not saying it
shouldn't grow anymore," but
"allowing for 2 percent growth is
unfair to students," she said.
Kennedy disagreed with the
COP's proposal to budget for only 1
percent real growth. A 6.75 percent
annual increase in the endowment
is what is hoped for, he said, but
the University "can't expect" it.

"Because the economy is cycli
cal, we need to protect the endow
ment," Kennedy said.
But Overdeck said the University
"doesn't have to worry if it doesn't
make 6.75 percent" one year. "They
have done better than that in the 10-
year average," he said.
He added that the University is
"in a position where if it suffers a
small loss one year it can make it
up double the next."
Kennedy said he hopes the COP
and others who have criticized the

University's decision to raise
tuition substantially will look at
other universities' cost increases.
Stanford's increase places it in
"only a slightly changed position"
in relation to other schools' costs,
he said.
COP members Overdeck, Mor
gan and Benny Sandoval will attend
die 8 a.m. meeting. John Louie, the
fourth member, is out of town.

Kennedy disagreed with the
COP's proposal to budget for only 1
percent real growth. A 6.75 percent
annual increase in the endowment
is what is hoped for, he said, but
the University "can't expect" it.

"Because the economy is cycli
cal, we need to protect the endow
ment," Kennedy said.
But Overdeck said the University
"doesn't have to worry if it doesn't
make 6.75 percent" one year. "They
have done better than that in the 10-
year average," he said.
He added that the University is
"in a position where if it suffers a
small loss one year it can make it
up double the next."
Kennedy said he hopes the COP
and others who have criticized the

University's decision to raise
tuition substantially will look at
other universities' cost increases.
Stanford's increase places it in
"only a slightly changed position"
in relation to other schools' costs,
he said.
COP members Overdeck, Mor
gan and Benny Sandoval will attend
die 8 a.m. meeting. John Louie, the
fourth member, is out of town.
