# Conley: Report on Silverberg should be out
## 
### Holly Hacker Senior staff writer 
Medical School Prof. Frances Conley said yester
day the University should make public the six-page
report examining her charges of sexism against Neu
rosurgery Prof. Gerald Silverberg.
A four-person committee, formed last September
to investigate Conley's charges, submitted the report
earlier this month to Medical School Dean David
Korn and University President Donald Kennedy.
"It would probably be valuable for the Stanford
community to see (the committee's) report," as long
as the confidentiality of the 10 to 40 people inter
viewed in the investigation is maintained, Conley said.
Silverberg announced last Friday that he had been
demoted by the University, but officials have refused
to say what the report may have concluded or
whether Silverberg was demoted.
Medical School spokesperson Spyros Andreopoulos
said an official statement is not expected for at least a
week, until lawyers representing Stanford and Silver
berg discuss the issue.
According to The New York Times, Silverberg said
he has seen the report and that it notes "minor insen
sitivities" but no "chargeable" offenses.
Conley also said yesterday she was "surprised" by
Silverberg's announcement, but
added that if Silverberg was actu
ally demoted, it would be a strong
move by the University.
"I think it's wonderful the Uni
versity has acknowledged the fact
that gender-based insensitivities
are corrosive to the people they're
directed against," she said.
Silverberg said last week he
had been informed by Korn and
Kennedy that he was losing his

position as acting chair of the
Neurosurgery Department and
would not be considered for the
permanent position.
Conley resigned last May when
she learned Silverberg would be
promoted from acting to perma
nent department chair, alleging
that he demeaned women. She
also accused other Medical School
colleagues of subtle sexism.
However, Silverberg said Sun
day, "I don't feel like I've done
anything wrong."
Since Silverberg's announce
ment, several colleagues and resi
dents in the department have

'I think it's wonderful the University has
acknowledged the fact that gender-based
insensitivities are corrosive. . .

come forward and expressed indig
nation at his reported demotion.
"It does not surprise me in the
least that they are outraged,"
Conley said, adding that not
knowing the reasons for Silver
berg's reported demotion must be
"very disturbing to them."
Conley said she was surprised,
however, at Silverberg's announce

ment because "all along" she has
requested only that the Medical
School "re-open the national
search" for a permanent chair.
Silverberg's promotion was
announced last year shortly after
budget cuts forced the Medical
School to call off its national search.
Andreopoulos said Silverberg
is currently out of town.
