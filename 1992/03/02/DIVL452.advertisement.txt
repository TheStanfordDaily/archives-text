March 1- 8 f 1992
Women's Herstory Month
Celebration
'Herstory' is a deliberate play on words, designed to
draw attention to the historical emphasis placed on
male-centered traditions. 'History' is not etymologi
cally derived from 'His', but the story usually belongs
onlytohim. Women'scontributionsareoften ignored
in traditional historical records and texts.
Herstory, then, is a reappropriation and long overdue
celebration of women's pasts, with an eye to the
future. Herstory is a recognition of women's lives —
our creations, struggles and achievements.
The Stanford Women's Center
and Ms. magazine in celebration
of our 20th anniversaries will be
holding a Ms. magazine subscrip
tion drive. Subscriptions will be
available at major events and at
the Women's Center throughout
the week.

March 1- 8 f 1992
Women's Herstory Month
Celebration
'Herstory' is a deliberate play on words, designed to
draw attention to the historical emphasis placed on
male-centered traditions. 'History' is not etymologi
cally derived from 'His', but the story usually belongs
onlytohim. Women'scontributionsareoften ignored
in traditional historical records and texts.
Herstory, then, is a reappropriation and long overdue
celebration of women's pasts, with an eye to the
future. Herstory is a recognition of women's lives —
our creations, struggles and achievements.
The Stanford Women's Center
and Ms. magazine in celebration
of our 20th anniversaries will be
holding a Ms. magazine subscrip
tion drive. Subscriptions will be
available at major events and at
the Women's Center throughout
the week.
