How many times have you found refuge in the Coffee
House by either listening to the live music, getting down at
"Hip Hop Night" or laughing hysterically at Comedy
Nights?
In the past, all of these events were funded by the University.
Unfortunately, due to budget cuts, all funding for the live entertainment in
the Coffee House has been terminated. It is for this reason the Stanford
Concert Network and the Office of Student Activities needs your help.
They want to inform you, the Stanford community, that all funding has
been terminated for Coffee House programming and that you, as a
concerned member of the community can do something to bring back the
music. Between now and Tuesday, March 3, WE, students and faculty
alike, must all come together and sign the petitions in the Coffee House
and/or Office of Student Activities in order to place Coffe House
programming on the ballot for ASSU funding. In order to be considered,
WE must aquire at least 3,000 names by Tuesday, March 3.
The opportunity to preserve the music at Stanford has been placed in all of
our hands. Only WE can save the live entertainment in the Coffee House;
the entertainment we so often enjoy and call upon after a long day. It's up
to all of us to see to it that we
don't let the music die...
