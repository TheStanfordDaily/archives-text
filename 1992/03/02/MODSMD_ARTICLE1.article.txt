First, Jenny Thompson broke a
world record that had stood more than
five years. Then she got what she real
ly wanted â€” a spot on the U.S.
Olympic swimming team.
The Stanford freshman became the
first American in 59 years to hold the
100-meter women's freestyle record,
with a time of 54.48 seconds in yester
day's preliminaries at the Olympic trials.
"Jenny had a phenomenal swim,"
said Stanford women's swimming
coach Richard Quick. "She has trained
and thought and performed thinking
[that she could break the record]. I'm
not surprised."

It wasn't until Sunday night's
finals that Thompson's triumph was
complete, as she earned one of the
United States' two Olympic berths in
the event, finishing first in 54.63 sec
onds. That also was faster than the
previous record of 54.73 set by Kristin
Otto while swimming for East Ger
many in 1986.
"My biggest goal is to make the
Olympic team," Thompson told the
Associated Press"after the preliminar
ies. "I felt extreme joy. I just started
bawling after I touched the wall. It
was the first time I've ever cried of
happiness."
Sophomore Summer Sanders also
qualified for the Olympic team, win
ning the 400-individual-medley with a

time of 4:40.79.
Thompson, whose best time in the
event had been 55.84, beat that time
by almost one-and-one-half seconds
and bested the previous record by an
impressive 0.25 second.
A second and a half is considered an
enormous amount of time in a sprint
event, roughly equivalent to a 50-
point difference in a basketball game.
Thompson's time also shattered
Angel Martino's American record of
55.00, which had been set earlier that
day in the third preliminary heat.
Thompson said she expected that
after "a two-hour nap and a good
lunch" she would be fine for the finals.
