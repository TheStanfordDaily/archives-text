# Swimmer smashes world record
## 
### George Malone Editorial staff 
First, Jenny Thompson broke a
world record that had stood more than
five years. Then she got what she real
ly wanted — a spot on the U.S.
Olympic swimming team.
The Stanford freshman became the
first American in 59 years to hold the
100-meter women's freestyle record,
with a time of 54.48 seconds in yester
day's preliminaries at the Olympic trials.
"Jenny had a phenomenal swim,"
said Stanford women's swimming
coach Richard Quick. "She has trained
and thought and performed thinking
[that she could break the record]. I'm
not surprised."

It wasn't until Sunday night's
finals that Thompson's triumph was
complete, as she earned one of the
United States' two Olympic berths in
the event, finishing first in 54.63 sec
onds. That also was faster than the
previous record of 54.73 set by Kristin
Otto while swimming for East Ger
many in 1986.
"My biggest goal is to make the
Olympic team," Thompson told the
Associated Press"after the preliminar
ies. "I felt extreme joy. I just started
bawling after I touched the wall. It
was the first time I've ever cried of
happiness."
Sophomore Summer Sanders also
qualified for the Olympic team, win
ning the 400-individual-medley with a

time of 4:40.79.
Thompson, whose best time in the
event had been 55.84, beat that time
by almost one-and-one-half seconds
and bested the previous record by an
impressive 0.25 second.
A second and a half is considered an
enormous amount of time in a sprint
event, roughly equivalent to a 50-
point difference in a basketball game.
Thompson's time also shattered
Angel Martino's American record of
55.00, which had been set earlier that
day in the third preliminary heat.
Thompson said she expected that
after "a two-hour nap and a good
lunch" she would be fine for the finals.

Freshman Jenny Thompson catches her breath after breaking a world record in the 100-meter women's freestyle
that stood more than five years. Thompson achieved her time of 54.48 in Sunday's preliminaries at the Olympic tri
als. Later that day she won a spot on the Olympic team.
"She has certain goals," said
Mike Parratto, her coach with
the Seacoast swim club."I think
she just went right past them.
That's her first, true big record."
The 5-foot-10-inch Thomp
son, from Dover, N.H., finished
third in the 50-meter freestyle in
the 1988 Olympic trials. In the
tlOO-meter

freestyle, she
was ranked
fourth in the
world in 1990
and seventh last
year. But she
has posted out
standing times
in meets this
year.

Sanders was also on world
record pace until the freestyle leg
of the event when she faded
slightly.
"Just because Summer didn't
set a world record shouldn't take
away from making the Olympic
team — that's amazing," Quick
said.
Former Stanford star Janet
Evans finished third in the
event. Sophomore Laurie Gan
drud came in 19th.
Junior Janel Jorgenson fin
ished ninth in the 100 freestyle,
missing the Olympic team by just
09 second.
The last American to hold the
100-freestyle record was Helene
Madison with a time of 1:06.6 in
Boston on April 20, 1931. That
stood until Willy den Ouden of
The Netherlands swam 1:06.0 on
July 9, 1933 in Antwerp.
Since then, only swimmers
from The Netherlands, Australia
and East Germany have held the
record. The East Germans had a
lock on it since Kornelia Ender
set her mark in 1973. Barbara
Krause broke it in 1978, and
Otto had it since Aug. 19, 1986.
Thompson, 19, was just five
months old when Ender began
the East German stranglehold in
Berlin on July 13, 1973.
