# Kennedy-COP talk 'a good first step'

### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Despite disagreement over
budget numbers, University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy and Coun
cil of Presidents members said
their hour-long Friday meeting
about tuition increases went well.
"I think this is the beginning of
the sort of analysis we need,"
Kennedy said, adding that it is
"too early" to make any decisions
about the COP's demands.
The COP has asked the Board
of Trustees to promise that it will
not substantially increase tuition
in future years. The COP has pro
posed that the board take an extra
1 percent from the University's
endowment each year in order to
keep these costs down.
"The decisions must be made,"
said COP member John Overdeck.
"Unless the trustees provide some
relief, things could get ugly in the
next 12 months in terms of fees,
cuts, tuition and other things."
The COP had estimated that
increasing the endowment payout
rate by 1 percent would generate
$20 million each year. But
Kennedy told the group it would
provide only about $9.7 million
for the operating budget, accord
ing to Overdeck.
"I think he did convince me
that [our] number" may not be
right, Overdeck said, adding that
he doesn't believe Kennedy's $9.7
million estimate either.

"We may not be talking about
these things in the same way," he
said.
Overdeck said he will be meet
ing with University Budget Direc
tor Tim Warner to discuss the
budget numbers. The meeting
time has not yet been set, he said.
COP member Beth Morgan
said Kennedy "seemed receptive"
to the proposal.
But since a decision on tuition
increases for the 1993-94 school
year will not be made for about a
year, she said there is "no hurry."
The group plans to continue the
discussion, she said.
Kennedy agreed that there is
"lots of time" to make a decision.
"I told them that figures for [the
1993-94 academic year] are very
tentative," he said. "The issues
won't come up yet."
Kennedy said if the COP takes
"the time necessary to dig into the
issue," it could be very helpful to
the Trustees. "Expressions to the
Board of Trustees could be very
useful," he said.
He added that the Trustee
committee that deals with finan
cial strategy is meeting tomorrow.
One of the ideas they are examin
ing is changing the payout rate â€”
the percentage of money the Uni
versity takes out of the endow
ment each year.
Overdeck called the meeting a
"good first step" and said he is
"glad the University is talking
about these issues."

But he added that the meeting
was only the beginning of student
pressure.
"We're optimistic, but, on the
other hand, we haven't seen any
results," he said. "We are still at the
level of talk, and we have seen what
talk is worth at this university."
The COP will be presenting their
case publicly in a week or two,
Overdeck said, after they have done
more research. "We hope that
administrators like Donald Kennedy
will be willing to discuss this in pub
lic meetings," he added.
The University is willing to
consider not making a large
tuition increase after next year,
Overdeck said, adding that the
COP's role is to make the best
argument it can for that.
In addition to meeting with
Kennedy, the COP backed a bill
passed by the ASSU Senate last
Tuesday condemning next year's
9.5 percent tuition hike, which was
approved by the Trustees Feb. 11.
The increase broke the Univer
sity's two-year-old pledge to limit
tuition hikes to 1 percent over
inflation.
The senate also decided to
begin circulating petitions oppos
ing the increase.
Another proposal, which Mor
gan said she may introduce at the
next meeting, would have the sen
ate send postcards to the parents
of every undergraduate asking
them to protest the hike by writ
ing to Kennedy and the Trustees.
