# Educator pushes for reform
## 
### Marc Chun 
While other countries have
"seen the future in education,"
the United States "has seen the
future and is not willing to act on
it," California Superintendent of
Public Instruction Bill Honig told
a Stanford audience Friday.
American teachers are lower on
the professional salary schedule,
teach larger classes and have
shorter academic years than those
in other industrialized countries,
said Honig, a national education
leader, to a crowd of about 100 in
a History Corner lecture hall.
Suggesting that additional
funding would enable the state to
"have the schools our kids
deserve," Honig urged students to
consider educational issues and to
participate in school reforms.
Honig also criticized the voucher
program currently being advocated
by President Bush and Secretary of
Education Lamar Alexander.
The voucher system is the
"antithesis of public collective
responsibility for educating our

kids," Honig said, to applause.
He said that under such a pro
gram, in which state funds follow
students to the schools — public or
private — of their choice, schools
would not have to meet the state
determined performance stan
dards, would discriminate among
students and would syphon off
public funds into private schools.
While California spends
approximately $4,600 per student
annually, New Jersey spends
$9,000 and Mississippi spends
$3,000-$3500, Honig said.
California teachers function at a
"20 percent discount compared to
the rest of the country," he said,
adding that it is "not very smart to
under-fund education at that level."
Honig said polls suggest that a
majority of the public favors fund
ing education and raising taxes to
educate kids.
California will also have to
adapt its curriculum and teaching
methods to an increasingly diverse
student population, Honig said.
California's school-age popula
tion is 43 percent white, 37 per

cent Latino, 9 percent African-
American and 9 percent Asian-
American, Honig said, making it
the first state with a non-majority
student body.
He said the key issues in a
state as diverse as California are
instructional program content
and delivery. "California has a
head of steam behind the whole
reform idea" in this area, he said.
Outlining his reform plan, Honig
advocated the use of statewide
assessment standards that reflect a
more demanding curriculum but
give teachers flexibility in determin
ing methods.
Noting that California has a
"hybrid form" of organization
that is balanced between entirely
decentralized and centralized
models, Honig said, "I think it's
the best of both."
California should also "invest
heavily in teachers" to bring them
"up to speed," Honig said. He
endorsed the use of different
kinds of classroom materials and
technology to aid in the teaching
process.
