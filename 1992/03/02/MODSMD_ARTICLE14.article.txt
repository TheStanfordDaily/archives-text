### 
NEA director's firing a
frightening example of
government censorship

THE ANNOUNCED resigna
tion of the director of the
National Endowment for the
Arts, John Frohnmayer, is a dan
gerous chapter in the story of gov
ernment sponsorship of art in this
country. It is no secret that he
resigned last week in response to
pressure from the Bush adminis
tration.
The Bush administration, in
turn, was reacting to political pres
sure from the President's far-right
challenger, Patrick Buchanan.
Buchanan's campaign advertise
ments have used some of the more
explicit and provocative artworks
sponsored by the NEA to question
Bush's commitment to conserva
tive values.
That President Bush responded
to such base assaults with the
peremptory action of firing Frohn
mayer is reprehensible.
This incident demonstrates the
need for setting up a buffer
between the government and the
funding of the arts. Otherwise,
artists will be at the mercy of shift
ing political winds. The arts serve
as an invaluable source of commen
tary on existing social relations,
and need to be made autonomous
to retain their value as an indepen
dent arena of cultural criticism.
This buffer could take the form
of a commitment to respecting the
director's term of office or appoint
ing a bipartisan committee to
make decisions about appoint
ments to the NEA.
There is a lesson to be learned
about the state sponsorship of art
from the erstwhile communist
countries in this regard. The social
function of art was lost because
artists were forced to kowtow to
the official party line; not only did
this deprive the arts of their cre
ative energy, but state-sponsored

art also degenerated into a mere
instrument of propaganda for the
government.
The work of dissidents like
Vaclav Havel, who had very impor
tant insights to offer about the
functioning of his society, had to be
published clandestinely, against
much opposition.
Unlike these countries, artistic
production in the U.S. is not limited
to government-funded performance.
There are numerous channels for
the private funding of the arts.
Moreover, there are opportunities
for non-governmental public fund
ing like the Public Broadcasting Ser
vice's support for innovative art.
However, it is the role of the gov
ernment to make sure that a forum
is provided for those provocative
voices which are not heard else
where. This includes the voices of
artists whose work falls outside the
realm of the current trends dictat
ed by the market. In addition, it is
important that the government
assist the creative work of minority
artists who might not otherwise
find sponsorship.
Conservatives like Buchanan
make their argument in favor of
the withdrawal of state funds from
the NEA, by citing majority opin
ion.
It is true that the works of con
troversial artists like Robert Map
plethorpe aroused public anger
when they were exhibited a couple
of years ago. However, there was
also considerable support for the
works. Many of those who were
offended by Mapplethorpe's work
also spoke out in favor of the prin
ciple of supporting art, regardless
of the message it conveys.
It is a matter of great concern
that President Bush's action
comes at a moment when the arts
are under siege nationwide. Even
at Stanford, students and artists
had to fight hard to save the visual
and performing arts.
Artistic production is a crucial
barometer of the vitality of any
culture, and the muzzling of the
arts for short term political benefit
is dangerously myopic.
