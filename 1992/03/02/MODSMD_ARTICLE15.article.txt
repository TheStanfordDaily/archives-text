Letter on rape conflates different degrees of i coercion 9

Helen gremillion's Feb. 26
letter to The Daily was typical of
the way that feminists misrepre
sent all opposition to their views as anti
women and even pro-rape instead of
acknowledging that people are only dis
agreeing with their extremist positions.
The concept of "sexual coercion" has
taken on local significance for two rea
sons. One is that it has been incorporat
ed into the University's new policy on
sexual assault. The other is because the
Stanford Rape Education Project pam
phlet promotes a definition of rape that
includes "sexual coercion," which is
defined as cases where women go along
with sex they don't really want to have.
This expanded definition of rape aims
to protect women, not just from men
who don't give a damn whether they say

no, but from their own reluctance or
inability to say no. No reference to force
— now groping ambiguity is to be
included as rape.
There are two things wrong with this
expanded definition of rape. First, it is
not the law. The legal definition of rape
requires force or the threat of force
unless the victim is unconscious or inca
pacitated. Lying to people about the law,
possibly encouraging them to press false
charges, is a serious violation.
Second, it would be a disaster if the
expanded definition of rape were the
law, and even more of a disaster if the
full concept of "sexual coercion" were
called rape, as Gremillion wants.
An unfortunate proportion of mutual
ly consensual sex proceeds without
explicit consent or non-consent, and

often, I am sure, with a certain amount
of confusion about whether having sex is
really a good idea. Sometimes this kind
of activity is going to go wrong.
If the woman does not go along — if
she says no and he forces himself on her
— that is rape. The existing definition of
rape perfectly covers that. The only
issue is whether a woman who goes
along with sex after being persuaded, or
who for some reason can't manage to
say no, can legally charge rape.
If we do start charging men with rape
for persuading women to have sex, we will
be lumping a violent and terrible crime
together with something that is a relative
ly insignificant violation, when it is prop
erly punishable at all. This would create a
huge inefficiency in the legal system.
Rather than giving each offense its

proper punishment, we would be forced
to give neither its proper punishment.
Severe punishments for rape would
become impossible, and the real protec
tion that women need against men who
use force would be sacrificed to provide
women with unnecessary protection
against their own inability to say no.
Gremillion is correct to note that the
great problem now is not the danger to
men of false accusations of rape, but the
fact that charges of rape are not treated
with proper seriousness and credibility.
So why in the world does she want to
attack the credibility of rape charges at
the root by expanding the definition of
rape to include things that are not prop
erly punishable?
