# Huge tuition increase must be reconsidered
## 
### 
I write to add my voice to the chorus of
students calling for a reconsideration of the
whopping 9.5 percent tuition increase
recently approved by the Board of Trustees.
So far, I have been completely
unmoved by the explanations offered by
the administration or its student yes-men.
In his Feb. 12 interview on KZSU,
University President Donald Kennedy
talked of "sharing the pain" of bud
getary problems with students.
A 9.5 percent tuition hike is not shar
ing the pain, it is a kick in the groin.
In his Feb. 20 letter to The Daily,
graduate student and member of Cabi
net Committee on Budget and Strategic
Planning David Bradfute tried to con
vince us that "an increase in tuition off
set by a reduction in the self-help com
ponent of financial aid is the only rea
sonable and humane course of action."
I wish to refute Bradfute. The options

are infinite. This action appears reasonable
to the administration because they would
rather stick it to students in the form of a
massive tuition increase than stick it to the
faculty in the form of program cuts.
They don't think we will protest. I
propose a third option. Use the endow
ment. We are sitting on a $2 billion nest
egg to be spent in the case of emergency.
This is such a case.
The Board of Trustees knows that
this is an incredibly unpopular proposal,
and the administration is incredibly sen
sitive to bad press on this one.
Well, we're going to have to give it to
them. We love this institution and are
ashamed at the way it has been behav
ing. We expect to be heard. Sign the peti
tion that is circulating.
If we simply roll our eyes every time
Stanford proposed a tuition increase, we
will be looking at $160,000 in tuition by
the time our kids are considering wearing
Cardinal red.
