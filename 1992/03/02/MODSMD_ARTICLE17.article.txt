# Judicial policy is still the same, officials note

A couple of weeks ago, The Daily
reported some students expressing
alarm at the possibility that misconduct
cases would be publicly discussed by
administrators and others.
There has been no change in either
policy or procedure. Requests for judi
cial action are investigated confidential
ly; if charges are filed and a judicial pro
cess ensues, that too is confidential; if
penalties are levied, those too are confi
dential.
The concern about a possible policy
change arose in the various responses to a
homophobic incident in Otero several
weeks ago. Dean of Students Michael
Jackson and others discussed it in a public
fashion and made known their own views.
It was not, however, an exception to
the confidentiality requirement of the
judicial process because the incident
itself was never put in the judicial arena.

From the outset, it was clear that the
latest "Otero Incident" was not a viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard Inter
pretation concerning free expression and
discriminatory harassment. That policy,
however, sets a basement-level standard
— the level below which one may not
sink without repercussions.
Our expectations are much higher,
and the public outcry that followed the
problem at Otero spoke to what we hope
and strive for rather than what our
rules require.
We do not intend to use The Daily or
other public settings to air student con
duct problems that are the subject of
judicial investigation and action.
We do, however, intend to comment
on events, issues and problems that
effect the campus community. Debate,
learning and exchange are the stuff of
life of a college campus, and we wouldn't
have it any other way.
