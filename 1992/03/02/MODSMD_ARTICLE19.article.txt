## Searching for a speakeasy 
### 
Are you a freshman who's
looking to get drunk? Do little
things like California laws and the
University alcohol policy seem like gnats
circling your head — annoying pests
impeding your progress?
Take heart. At least six dormitories
and three fraternities held parties that
served alcohol Friday night. All you had
to do was choose the right one, and alco
hol was free and bountiful — no matter
what your age.
If, however, you made your way to a
party where the alcohol policy was being
seriously enforced, you were probably
spared the trouble of a hangover.
You see, back on Oct. 1, 1990, the
Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act
went into effect. In a classic case of
attaching strings, the federal govern
ment told universities (among other
institutions) that their precious funding
would disappear should they fail to guar
antee a drug- and underage drinking-free
environment.
So, Stanford changed its policy, and to
make a long story short, that explains the
rent-a-cops outside those parties where
you weren't able to drink.
Stanford's position used to be that
students should know the laws of the
state and then make their choices accord
ingly. The big plus side was that no one in
the University acted like the police.
Everyone was here to help, to talk with

you about drinking and to let you experi
ence both its bright and dark sides.
There was a recognition that college
students, newly freed from the shackles of
their parents, tend to seize the opportuni
ties presented by their freedom to force
themselves to vomit. And resident assis
tants were there to get you that glass of
water your burning throat required and
to suggest that maybe the floor of the stall
didn't offer the best view on campus.
The big down side was not all the stu
dents who puked made it to the bath
room.
But back to all those parties Friday.
Just looking at the ways in which they
adhered to the alcohol policy you
wouldn't know they all took place on the
same campus.
Some organizers went to great lengths
to control who got in to their parties.
Others didn't do so thorough a job. Simi
larly, some houses made a bona fide
attempt to ensure that only people of
legal drinking age had access to alcohol.
Others, well, didn't do so thorough a job.
On balance, is the drinking that occurs
today more responsible than it was two
years ago? If so, the current policy would
have to be termed a success, enforcement
imperfections notwithstanding.
But if, as one RA suggested, obtaining
alcohol has become so difficult for fresh
men who organize parties that they
spend all their energy just figuring out

how to make the party wet — to the
exclusion of other party preparations —
things are not going well at all.
Dorm funds are no longer supposed to
buy alcohol — in part to reduce the focus
on alcohol at parties. But has alcohol in
fact become any less of a focus? Fresh
men now "pass the hat," as another RA
put it, so that those who don't want to
drink and break the law are not required
to subsidize those who do.
It is axiomatic that college students
drink. What we must strive for is the
safest and most supportive environment
possible. One promising note about
freshmen drinking habits comes from RA
Michelle Landrey, who said of Larkinites,
"When they hold parties here, they don't
drink as much as when they go out."
Which suggests an encouraging level
of responsibility. And indeed, Larkin has
been spared any drinking problems at its
parties this year, according to Landrey.
But is this responsibility matched
around campus? The scene Friday night —
with certain houses' serious attempts at
control scarred by the presence of a few
campus speakeasies — wouldn't suggest it.

the rent-a-cops
at the parties
where you
couldn't drink.
