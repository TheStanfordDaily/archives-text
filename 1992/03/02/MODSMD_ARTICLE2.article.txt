## Slates announce candidates for COP elections 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Ending weeks of speculation, members
of three would-be Council of Presidents
slates announced their candidacy this
weekend. In addition, the Students First
and People's Platform parties endorsed 28
candidates for ASSU Senate.
Both the Hammer and CofTin Party and
Students First announced yesterday that
they will endorse COP slates, while anoth
er candidate announced his intention to
run on an independent slate.
People's Platform still does not intend
to endorse a COP slate, according to Rus
sell Calleros, a party member and under
graduate senator.
"I don't see four people within our party"
who want to run for COP, Calleros said.
The Students First slate is made up of
juniors John Hall, Preeti Malladi and Joel
Stein. Rounding out the slate is Stanford
football player Glyn Milburn, a senior.
Hammer and Coffin party chair David
Hyatt confirmed that, as of yesterday, the
party intended to run a COP slate. But he
said he would not release the names of slate
members until March 3, the filing deadline
for all ASSU candidates.
"That's going to kind of be the modus
operandi for the entire campaign â€” waiting
'til the last possible minute," Hyatt said.
Senior Ed Mun confirmed yesterday that
he will run on an independent slate. Mun,
an undergraduate senator, said that because
one of his chosen running mates is still
uncertain about running, Mun would not
release the names of other slate members.
"If one drops out, I'll replace" that per
son, he said.
Another independent slate that may run
for COP would include current undergradu-

ate senators Ron Brown
and Jason Snyder.
Brown said he and
Snyder are considering
running but do not
know how likely their
candidacy is or who

would fill the other two spots on the slate.
"We probably won't have a decision
about whether we're going to run or who
it's going to be [with] until the last
minute," he said.
Hall is currently chair of Students First.
Malladi is a resident assistant in Cedro and
is a member of Sanskriti, an Indian group on
campus. Stein is a former Daily columnist.
Although a senior, Milburn has another
year of athletic eligibility and will return to
Stanford next year. In addition to being a
running back on the Cardinal football
team, he is also involved in the Big Broth
ers program.
"I'm the common man of the slate," Mil
burn said.
Parties endorse senate candidates
Students First and People's Platform
each endorsed 10 candidates for under
graduate senate seats. In addition, Stu
dents First endorsed seven graduate senate
candidates, while People's Platform
endorsed one. People's Platform also
announced an affiliation with two indepen
dent candidates.
Candidates for undergraduate senate
running with People's Platform are Allyson
Dickson, Paula Dybdahl, Luz Herrera,
Tyler Kim, Gabriel Lucas, Robert Milk,
Anoop Prakash, Virginia Rosas, Stacey
Strong and Tony Wagner.
