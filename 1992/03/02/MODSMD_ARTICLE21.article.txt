## Greek system advocates respond to columnist's allegations 
### 
Stereotyping of Greeks
as racist, sexist unfair
I #
I am writing in response to to Omar
Wasow's column in the Feb. 27 issue of
The Daily. As a leader in the Greek com
munity, I take great offense at Wasow's
comments. There are several misleading
points that need to be addressed.
First, a fraternity is vastly different
than a self-op or co-op, and I would have
hoped Wasow would have investigated
those options before joining Beta Theta Pi.
Second, the Greek system is a mul
tiracial system. There are no exclusion
ary barriers in place or overt tactics used
to keep out minorities.
What restrains the Greek system
from expanding its diversity is the con
tinual assault on it and the brainwash
ing of freshmen by the Black Student
Union; MEGhA, the Chicano/Latino stu
dent group; and the Office of Residential
Education. These groups claim that the
Greek system is racist, sexist and homo
phobic.
I categorically deny these charges and
challenge freshmen to investigate the
basis of tlje Greek system for themselves
rather than allowing others to unduly
influence their beliefs.
Third, Wasow seems to be very "edu

cated" on the Greek system for someone
who had no real interest in being Greek
and barely spent any time in the system.
His assumptions that Bar Nights with
sororities are sexist is quite naive and
demeaning to the women involved.
I am confused with his logic in railing
Greeks for socializing with women,
drinking beer and displaying brother
hood. Is he claiming men and women
cannot socialize responsibly with one
another? If he is, he has a very narrow
and critical perception of people.
The Greek system does have its faults
just like any other large organization,
but over 20 percent of the Stanford stu
dent body see a place for themselves in
the Greek community.
Wasow may want to re-evaluate his
problem of continually stereotyping and
generalizing people. This only serves to
increase the discrimination against indi
viduals.
I am proud to be a Greek member and
to be associated with the other Greeks on
this campus. The Greek system has many
rewards to offer to those who are serious
about joining a Greek organization.
Though Wasow and I differ in our
opinion of the merits of Greek life, we do
share one thing in common. We are both
thankful that he is out.

Hiring strippers isn't
unique to fraternities
Omar Wasow's comments are dis
turbing not because of his vivid descrip
tions of life at the Beta Theta Pi House,
but because of the blanket statements he
made concerning fraternities and sorori
ties at Stanford.
What is most offensive to me is that
Wasow assumes that there is a direct
link between the incidents that occurred
at the Beta House and the fact that it is
a housed fraternity.
In my freshman dormitory, a group of
men hired a stripper for someone's
birthday. Those men had no Greek affili
ations whatsoever and lived in a dormi
tory that was "multiracial and inclusive
of women and gay people."
Thus, sexist and homophobic behav
ior can occur and be encouraged any
where, not just in the confines of housed
fraternities.
I am very proud to wear my Greek
letters at Stanford. I encourage mem
bers of the Stanford community to judge
the Greek system not by Wasow's isolat
ed comments but by the Greeks that are
student leaders in the academic field,
The Daily, the Haas Center for Public
Service, the ASSU Senate and many

other campus organizations.

Frats can be tolerant,
positive organizations
While I do not seek to condone or
defend the events which Omar Wasow
described as having occurred during his
time as a Beta Theta Pi, I do take issue
with the blanket generalizations of fra
ternity life that he attempts to promul
gate.
Like Wasow, I had mixed feelings
about the Greek system during my first
year at Stanford. I had heard all kinds of
negative stories about fraternities: that
they were racist, sexist, homophobic
organizations whose members only
drank beer and chased women.
Freshman year, I allowed these gen
eralizations to form my opinion of
Greeks. So when Rush came, I had
already decided that fraternities were
not for me.
Three years later, I am glad that a
friend of mine twisted my arm and made
me go with him to the Rush parties one
night. At the time, one opportunity to
speak with these "fraternity animals"

was all that was necessary to make me
realize that not all fraternity men were
prejudiced and narrow minded â€” like
Wasow seems to insinuate.
At the end of three weeks, I did "the
unspeakable" and accepted a bid from a
fraternity.
Before doing this, however, I took
great pains to assure that it was the
right fraternity for me. I wanted a group
that was not looking for its "token Mexi
can," one that was genuinely interested
in what I had to offer.
Also, I made sure I chose a fraternity
that had a strong commitment to com
munity service and whose members
respected the rights and lifestyles of oth
ers.
I am sorry that Wasow had such a
negative experience with the Betas, but
to use this as a basis for an indictment
of the entire Greek system is both unfair
and ignorant.
While I will be the first to admit there
exist pockets of racism, sexism and
homophobia in the Greek community, I
believe that one also can say the same
for the rest of Stanford.
Moreover, Wasow's accusations make
him guilty of the very prejudicial and
generalizing assessments that he pur
ports to be working against.
