## Hoops crushes foul-happy WSU 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
In a basketball game that had
all the finesse of ice hockey, high
sticking Washington State
watched from the penalty box as
Stanford skated nimbly to an 85-
70 victory yesterday at Maples
Pavilion.
Three Cougar defensive goons
fouled out trying to pulverize
Stanford forward Adam Keefe,
but Keefe scored a Wayne Gret
zky-like 33 points and the Cardi
nal converted the power play,
sinking a season-best 27 of 33
from the free throw line.
Thanks to the Pacific 10 Con
ference victory, Stanford does
not have to believe in miracles to
be thinking about the NCAA
Tournament. The Cardinal — 16-
8 oyerall, 8-6 and alone in fourth
in the Pacific 10 Conference with
four games to play — visits fifth
place Arizona State (16-11, 7-7)
Thursday with a chance to ice
fourth place and a probable invi
tation to March Madness.
The Cardinal couldn't be
caught looking past the Cougars
(19-8, 7-8), who stifled Stanford
67-59 in Pullman earlier this
year. WSU will need to beat No. 4
UCLA, No. 13 USC and Washing
ton at home to have any hope of
catching the Cardinal for fourth.
"They're a legitimate, solid,
good basketball team. I think we
had to play very well to beat
them," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery, who abandoned his
usual quixotic approach and
refused to speculate on Stanford
tournament hopes. "We played
like a whole team and everybody
was working hard."
The Cardinal opened the game
on an 18-4 rampage, but the
streak-shooting Cougars clawed
back to take a 26-24 lead. Slash
ing guards Neil Derrick (22
points) and Terrence Lewis (20
points) scored from all over the
floor, but couldn't overcome
Stanford's inside advantage.

Unrattled, Stanford point
guard Marcus Lollie answered
with a 3-pointer and Peter Dukes
converted a 4-point play as Stan
ford built a 41-34 halftime lead.
"We felt like we were in con
trol. Of course, that can be dan
gerous. Up there (Pullman) we
were up by six points and lost,"
said Keefe.
In the second half the Cougars
whittled a 12-point Stanford lead
down to 63-57 with seven min
utes left, but Dukes drained his
fourth trey and Stanford was per
fect on its last 11 free throws.
Paul Garrett, a free throw goat
last week at USC, was 7 for 8
from the charity stripe.
Keefe was cross-body blocked
into a 5 for 15 night at Pullman,
but all the Cougar defensemen
could do yesterday was watch
from the bench. Starting power
forward Ken Critton played just
12 minutes and scored 2 points.
He fouled out with 5:17 left,
joining starting center Brian
Paine and back-up Tommie
"Twinkie" Oatis at the end of the
bench.
"We were allowed to bang at
our place. The same plays were
called a foul today," said Cougar
coach Kelvin Sampson. "Critton
is our horse. He's as important to
us defensively as Keefe is to Stan
ford."
With skinny 6-foot-8 sopho
more forward Rob Corkrum
assisted by four guards, Wash
ington State had no way to stop
Keefe.
The Cougars tried a 1-3-1 zone
around him, but it left the cor
ners open for Dukes to shoot
treys. Stanford shot 58 percent
from the field yesterday, com
pared to 39 percent in the setback
at Pullman.
Aside from short stints by
freshman David Harbour and
sophomore center Jim Morgan,
Montgomery relied on his
starters. Guard Kenny Hicks
tweaked his ankle in the first half
and went to the training room.

Montgomery indicated the injury
was not serious and Hicks would
be ready for Arizona State.
Pac-10 Notes
After an upset loss at Oregon
State Thursday, ASU had to
come from behind to topple last
place Oregon 58-48 yesterday at
Mac Court. In other Pac-10
action, No. 1 Duke survived a
horrible first half to beat No. 4
UCLA 75-65 at Pauley Pavilion.
After clobbering Stanford last
week, the Bruins have lost three
in a row and are tied for the con
ference lead. Coach Jim Harrick
seems to have his super-talented
squad gelling for tournament
time again.
In pre-March Madness hype
yesterday, CBS basketball ana
lysts predicted that the Pac-10
would receive five invitations to
the tournament.
"We still control our own des

tiny," said Keefe. "USC, UCLA
and Arizona are in the driver's
seat, but we have four games left
and we're in good position."
