# Florida edges Stanford at Indoors, Card moves to No. 2

Going into doubles competition, No. 5
Stanford and No. 1 Florida were knotted
at 3-3 in the Finals of the National Indoor
Tennis Championships.
Doubles was a question mark for both
teams. The Gators struggled against
UCLA in the semis, winning only at No.
3 to edge the Bruins 5-4. And judging
how the Cardinal would handle pressure
doubles was difficult. The squad had
completed all three doubles contests just
once in the last six dual matches.
Stanford grabbed the early lead.
Heather Willens and Laxmi Poruri took
the first set from Lisa Raymond and
Krika Kuttler 6-4 in the top match. Kris
tine Kurth and Amy Chiminello nabbed
the first set at No. 3 against Kristin
Osmond and Jill Brenner.
In the No. 2 slot, Kylie Johnson and
Km ma Woodhouse dropped a set to Holly
Lloyd and Kay Louthian, 6-4, but
rebounded to take a 5-2 lead in the sec
ond set.
The Cardinal appeared in good shape
to win two contests and capture the tour
nament for the third time in four years.
But appearances can be deceiving. The

'We may have underesti
mated them. They were
certainly not the same
team (that lost two doubles
against UCLA).'
â€” coach Frank Brennan

Gators, victors in 1988 and 1991, came
back. Raymond and Kuttler pushed the
match to three sets and won 4-6, 6-4,6-3.
Johnson and Woodhouse let their lead
slip away in the second set, succumbing
to Lloyd and Louthian in a tiebreaker 7-
6(7-5). With the match decided, No. 3
doubles was called off.
The Florida victory clinched the team
title for the Gators 5-3. "They played bet
ter doubles," Stanford coach Frank
Brennan said. "We may have underesti
mated them. They were certainly not the
same team (that lost two doubles against
UCLA)."
In singles, No. 1 Raymond defeated
No. 5 Willens 6-0, 3-6, 6-3 and Lloyd
edged Poruri 6-7(6-8), 6-2, 6-4.

Stanford notched victories in the No.
3-5 contests. Johnson beat Louthian 6-2,
6-4. Bouncing back from a first set
tiebreaker, Kurth waxed Kuttler 6-7(5-
7), 6-2, 6-1. Woodhouse thrashed
Osmond 6-0, 6-2.
With the title, Florida will keep the
top ranking in next week's poll while
Stanford will move to No. 2.
The Cardinal will take over the slot
from Georgia, who Stanford beat 5-1 in
the semis. The Bulldogs competed with
out their former No. 3 player, Laura
Kimel, who is out for the year with heart
problems.
Despite her absence, few expected the
Cardinal to win in singles. Brennan
attributed the lopsided victory to several
causes. "We're starting to get used to the
indoor courts and we're coming together
as a team," he said. "When the pressure
was on we seemed to play better."
A Cardinal jinx may have plagued the
Bulldogs. In 1990 and 1991 Georgia
faced Stanford in the semis. Each time
the Cardinal sent them packing.
"That's probably building on them,"
he said. "They may be trying too hard to
beat us."
At No. 1 singles, Shannan McCarthy
didn't have to over-exert herself against

Willens. The Georgia senior, a powerful
serve-and volleyer, used the fast indoor
surface to her advantage by relentlessly
attacking Willens. McCarthy rolled, 6-1,
6-2.
"She's your worst nightmare on an
indoor surface. Heather was overpow
ered," Brennan said. "On a slow outdoor
court, Heather would definitely win. On
a fast outdoor court, it would be close."
Poruri tallied a straight-set victory
over Angela Lettiere while Kylie John
son did the same against Shawn
McCarthy. Tonya Bogdonas took Wood
house to a tiebreaker in the second set
but lost to the Cardinal sophomore 6-3,
7-6(8-6).
Kurth secured the team win with a
gutwrenching three-set victory over
Stacy Sheppard. Kurth captured the first
set but lost the second 6-4. She led 4-1 in
the third but the lead slipped through
her fingers as Sheppard pulled even.
Kurth dug in and rolled off a few games
to seal the 7-6(7-2), 4-6, 7-5 victory.
"Kristine is a streaky player," Bren
nan said. "She's up, down and sideways."
He added, "She is just going to get better.
Kristine has made a lot of progress (since
recovering from her back injury). She's
not even close to the top of her game yet."

For Kurth the match must have been
a bit of deja vu. The day before, in a clash
with Monica Mraz of No. 6 Duke, she had
split sets and gone up 4-1 in the third.
But Kurth didn't hang on for the win,
dropping the last five games.
However, that was the only loss for
the Cardinal. Willens beat Julie Exum 6-
2, 6-4 and Poruri thumped Susan Som
merville. Christine Neuman fell to John
son.
Woodhouse won a see-saw battle with
Tracey Hiete and Chiminello nipped
Wendy Lyons in three sets.
In the four matches no Stanford play
er finished worse than 2-2 in singles and
Woodhouse led the squad with a
sparkling 4-0 record. Two of the victories
were blowouts and only Hiete pushed the
Stanford sophomore to three sets.
By finishing one-two, Stanford and
Florida proved they're still the teams to
beat in the collegiate ranks. A year ago,
the Gators crushed the Cardinal 6-0 at
National Indoors but Stanford walked off
with the NCAA trophy.
Brennan's club may again get the last
laugh at Stanford Stadium in two
months. "We proved we're not the No. 5
team," he said. "Next is to prove we're
No. 1."
