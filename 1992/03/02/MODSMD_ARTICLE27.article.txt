# Batters lead way as Cardinal takes two of three from ASU
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
It was a wild, wild weekend in
Tempe for the Stanford baseball
team. The Card played well
enough to take two out of the
three games from Arizona State
— and they didn't do it with good
pitching, but uncharacteristically
impressive hitting.
"Anytime you go on the road
and win two out of three in our
conference, it is a great accom
plishment," said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess. "And to
beat Arizona State here is great
for us or for any team."
Indeed, the Sun Devils have a
history of near invincibility at
Packard Stadium, a hitter's ball
park characterized by short
fences and a plethora of vocal
fans. And it seemed Friday night
that Packard was going to collect
its annual toll of at least two
games from the Cardinal.
The Sun Devils exploded for
eight runs in the second inning
against usually sure-throwing
Stanford starter Brian Sackinsky.
And Arizona State didn't let up,
as they went on to score five more
runs in the course of the next
seven innings against a platoon of
Stanford pitchers, bringing the
final score to 13-3.

Stanford did get some hits in
the game, but not at the right
times as the Cardinal stranded an
amazing 14 runners. One bright
spot in the game for Stanford
came from the bat of freshman
shortstop Jed Hansen, who hit
his second home run of the year, a
solo shot.
Saturday would bring another,
even bigger blowout, but this
time the score favored the Cardi
nal. In the battle of winning mar
gins, Stanford prevailed by
outscoring the Sun Devils by 13
runs in an 18-5 win.
The Cardinal bats were abso
lutely electric on the day, accruing
a season-high 21 hits. Exceptional
performances were turned in by
Jeffrey Hammonds and Mark
Skeels, who each collected four
hits and scored three runs. In
addition, Hammonds stole three
bases and Skeels had four RBI.
Chris Kemper continued his tor
rid hitting since returning to the
starting lineup, getting three hits
and three RBI, and John Lynch
hit his second home run in three
games, a two-run rocket to left, in
a bid to secure a starting spot.
Sunday brought the rubber
match, and clutch play by the
Cardinal. Arizona State had built
a 5-1 lead by virtue of excellent
Sun Devil pitching bv sophomore

Doug Newstrom, until he began
to tire in the seventh. Ham
monds, Dave Cornell, Dusty
Allen, and Skeels all walked, load
ing the bases and bringing one
run across to mitigate the lead to
three. A Lynch sacrifice fly and a
Kemper single brought the lead
to one.
Then, senior David Holbrook,
who was injured in Saturday's
game and not expected to see any
playing time, limped to the plate
in a Kirk Gibsonesque fashion
and promptly delivered a pinch
hit single to drive in the tying
run. A Jeff DesJardins double
and Hansen single brought three
more runs across as the Cardinal
in all touched home plate seven
times in the inning.
A DesJardins homer in the top
of the ninth helped extend the
Cardinal lead to five, and it turned
out that the runs were excellent
insurance, as the Sun Devils
would score three more in the
ninth to make the final score 10-8.
Cornell exhibited a move of
consummate sportsmanship and
team play in the ninth. Facing a
full count with a twelve game hit
ting streak on the line and his
team up by five, Cornell, rather
than attempt to further his
streak and bolster his own stats,
let ball four sail bv uncontested.
