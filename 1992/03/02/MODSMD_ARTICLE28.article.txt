# Cagers kill 'Cats

### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
Stanford's women's basketball
team bounced back from a demor
alizing defeat in fine fashion Sat
urday, blowing the Arizona Wild
cats out of their own arena, 97-66.
Coupled with Arizona State's
63-52 defeat of California, the win
kept Stanford firmly in the Pacific
10 Conference lead. The Cardinal
now has only three games remain
ing on its regular season schedule,
all at home. Two victories are
required to clinch the team's
fourth straight Pac-10 title.
Prior to Saturday's game, the
squad met together to renew
their resolve to win the Pac-10
and gear up for the NCAA tour
nament.
The determination paid off, as
the team overcame a slow start to
take a 20-point lead in the first
half, allowing coach Tara Van-
Derveer to play her bench exten
sively throughout the game. The
reserves scored a total of 36
points, more than compensating
for All-America candidate Val
Whiting's eight-point output.
As in the Washington State
game last weekend, Whiting was
double and triple-teamed, and
other players picked up their
scoring. However, Whiting's
streak of 40 consecutive games
with double-figure scoring was
broken.
The leader for Stanford
against Arizona was Chris Mac-
Murdo, who shot 6-of-ll from the
field and 6-of-7 from the line in
racking up 19 points. She made
her only three-point attempt of
the game and also had three
steals and six rebounds.
Christy Hedgpeth and Molly
Goodenbour reappeared for the
Cardinal, after both had off
games against Arizona State.
They combined for 29 points.
Stanford's bench warrior was
Kelly Dougherty, who accrued 11
points and a team-high eight

rebounds in only 17 minutes of
play.
The Cardinal did two things in
particular against the Wildcats
that were different from what the
team did against the Sun Devils.
One, it improved its transition
game by reversing its turnover
ratio. Stanford gave the ball away
only 11 times. Led by Tanda
Rucker's five thefts, the Cardinal
collected more steals than
turnovers, a rare accomplishment
by any team.
The second improvement over
Thursday's beating was Stan
ford's shooting. The Cardinal got
its running game going Saturday
and shot 50 percent from the
field, 13 percent higher than
against Arizona State.
The one statistic which
remained negative for Stanford
was its rebounding ratio. The
Wildcats got to the boards 10
times more than the Cardinal did,
including eight times more on the
offensive caroms.
Stanford entered the weekend
as the Pac-10's statistical leader
in rebound margin.
Despite the presence of so
many juniors on such a young
team, the Cardinal players are
determined to go all the way this
year.
"We don't look at it as a two
year project," Goodenbour said.
"We want to win it this year, and
then worry about next year."
