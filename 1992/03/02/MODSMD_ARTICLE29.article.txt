### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Playing for a full house and television audiences, the
Cardinal men's tennis team soundly defeated both No. 14
California and No. 21 UC-Irvine this weekend. Their shin
ing performances reflected their new status as the nation's
top team. r .j ,
"We are 10-0 and ranked first going into Spring Break.
At the beginning of the season, not many people would've
thought that we'd be here," said assistant coach John
Whithngeiv "The guys have earned it, they've really worked
hard — it'i not luck."
The moil proved their strength Saturday afternoon by
destroying'the Weenies, 9-0.
"They came out strong and determined," Whitlinger
said. "Thfey got after Cal and never looked back. It was an
impressive display."
Eveiy Stanford singles player stormed through his match
in two sets. Especially impressive was Alex O'Brien's 6-4, 6-
0 first singles win over Matt Lucena, a U.S. Open doubles
quarterfinalist and two-time NCAA doubles champion.
"He can be a really dangerous player when he's hitting
well," O'Brien said. "I tried to keep him on his back foot. I
didn't serve too well, I just did what it took to win — noth
ing too radical."
In doubles, O'Brien and sophomore Chris Cocotos
teamed up to defeat Lucena and partner Tommy Phanco in
three sets.
"We returned pretty well but didn't have a very good ser
vice game," O'Brien noted. "We tried to work on moving —
not hitting returns and just standing there."
All three doubles teams crushed Cal, an accomplishment
which pleased Whitlinger. "I like what they're doing.
They're doing in matches what they've been showing us in
practice."
Yesterday, the Cardinal improved its unblemished
record with a 7-2 victory over the Anteaters. Again, the

Stanford men swept singles, however victory was not
reached quite as easily.
Michael Flanagan and Cocotos had nerve-wracking
three-setters which eventually clinched a Stanford victory.
Flanagan began in a hurry, rushing through every point.
After dropping the set 1-6, he came back with more patience
and a steady pace to win the next two sets 6-1, 7-5.
"I was trying to make things happen too quickly," he
said. "I played really tough and that was important, but I
didn't play too well."
On the next court, Cocotos was duking it out in a simi
lar three-set nail-biter. After winning the first set 6-1, he
was serving for the match at 5-3, 40-0. He lost concentra
tion and squandered away several opportunities and the
set, 5-7. Finally, in a third-set tiebreaker he found victory.
"I thought it was over (at 5-3, 40-0)," he said. "I got
casual and he got his confidence back and lifted his
game."
The bottom half of the lineup did not have nearly the
excitement that the top half did: with the exception of one
set, Robert Devens, Vimal Patel and Jason Yee lost only
four games total.
"I can't say enough about how they're playing down
there," Whitlinger said.
Last year, the team often had problems pulling out wins
at the four, five and six spots, but this year is a new show.
Devens destroyed his opponent 6-2, 6-1 while Yee double
bageled his. Patel came back after rushing his first set to
win 2-6, 6-0, 6-1.
The lower half of the ladder also carried the Cardinal in
doubles. Patel and Yee teamed up to win in the first slot
while juniors Roman Sydorak and Ken Pedroza, at second,
lost their first doubles match of their dual match career, 6-
4, 7-6. Billy Wright and Mihir Mankad also lost two tough
sets at third doubles.
The whole Stanford squad will be shining up their dou
bles play this week as they prepare for next weekend's
Pacific Coast Doubles Championships in La Jolla.
