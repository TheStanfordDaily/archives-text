# Men's swimmers reach for Barcelona
## 
### Tish Williams Staff writer 
Seventeen Stanford swimmers have
begun competing in the most competi
tive swim meet this year, the U.S.
Olympic Trials.
The Trials are being held in Indi
anapolis, and due to the incredible depth
of U.S. swimming, involve more intense
competition than the Olympics.
Two men's events have been decided
so far, and Cardinal swimmers have
already begun to make their mark on
these Olympic trials.
Stanford 3tands to send several other
swimmers to Barcelona this summer,
but sine 1 each country is only entitled
two swimmers in each event, not includ
ing relays, those whose performance is
not the very best will be left behind.
Events already decided yesterday
include the men's 200-meter freestyle
and the 100-meter breaststroke. Joe
Hudepohl, who will be a freshman at
Stanford next fall, placed first in the 200
freestvle. Cardinal freshman Dan Kan

ner finished 11th in the event.
In the men's 100 breaststroke, J.J.
Freytag came in fourth place with
1:02.78, just .64 seconds behind a sec
ond-place Olympic berth. Tyler Mayfield
finished tied for twelfth.
Jeff Rouse leads Stanford's remain
ing hopes, as the reigning world-record
holder in the 100-meter backstroke.
Rouse will have to deal with a powerful
contingent to win a spot, however.
Only the qualifying swimmers are
sent to Barcelona, regardless of world
records and Olympic gold medals.
Staging a personal comeback, Pablo
Morales will have another chance to
prove himself to the swimming world
this week.
Morales, a Stanford alumnus with 11
NCAA titles and a gold medal from the
'84 Olympics under his belt, failed to
make the '88 team, as a world record
holder.
"Though I was disappointed after '88,
I didn't leave competitive swimming with
a sour taste in my mouth," Morales said.
"Sometimes I'd get lost in all the

work I did. You put your heart and soul
in it and it doesn't come out. . . But this
year, as each day went by I realized that
this (comeback) was something I really
wanted to do."
Freshman Ray Carey will be in the
running for one of the spots in the 200
butterfly.
Carey is ranked fifth in the world in
that event. He won the 200 fly at the
World University Games in '91.
"The tough thing is that the U.S. is
such a dominant swimming country,"
Carey said. "Olympic Trials beforehand
is the bigger race . . . the more nerve
racking race."
Other top hopefuls for the Cardinal
are American record-holder Brian Ret
terer, Derek Weatherford, ranked
eleventh in the world in the 400 individ
ual medley and Trip Zedlitz, ranked
ninth in the 200 I.M.
The Cardinal squad is sending over
half its swimmers to Indianapolis, while
the others continue to train for the
NCAA Championships to be held on
March 26-28.
