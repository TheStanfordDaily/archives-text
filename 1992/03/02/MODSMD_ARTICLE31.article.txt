### Larry Liu Staff writer 
The Stanford grapplers turned in a
decent performance at the Pacific 10
Championships, with six of the eight
Cardinal competitors placing and three
qualifying for the NCAAs. The compe
tition was held Friday and Saturday at
the University of Oregon in Eugene.
Lady luck was not on Stanford's
side in drawing first round opponents.
For their opening round bouts, four
wrestlers were matched against the
No. 1 seed of their respective weight
divisions and one drew the No. 2 seed.
At 118 pounds, Phil Nowick lost to
Dan Vidlak, the No. 1 seed from Ore
gon, 20-5 in a technical fall.
The loss bumped Nowick to the con
solation bracket, where he subse
quently upset Boise State's Larry
Duran 4-3.
The win put him in the semifinals,
but Nowick did not make his second
weigh-in and had to forfeit the rest of
his matches, leaving him in sixth place.
At 126 pounds, Phil's twin brother
Dave also faced a rough draw and fell
to Oregon State's Babac Mohammadi

by a score of 24-8. In consolation, he
won two bouts, including a 7-0 upset
over Boise State's Chris Ward, giving
him fifth place overall.
At 134 pounds, Jay Jackson drew
another No. 1 seed in Arizona State's
Marco Sanchez and lost a close 6-2
decision. In consolation, Jackson beat
Oregon's Cory Sonnen 12-1 and No. 3
seed Larry Garrison from Boise State
8-7 to finish in fourth place.
Jackson was also named first alter
nate to the NCAAs and will compete if
anyone withdraws in the next two
weeks due to injuries.
At 142 pounds, Cardinal Lance
Johnson qualified for the NCAAs with
a fourth place finish in his division.
Johnson had wins over Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo's Pat Morrissey and Cal
State-Fullerton's Jason Roberts.
By coaches' vote, Johnson was given
one of seven wildcards to participate in
the NCAAs.
At 158 pounds, No. 3 seed Matt
Topham also received a wildcard to the
NCAAs for his fifth place finish.
Topham went 2-2 with wins over Boise
State's Andy Leathers and Cal Poly-
SLO's Don Miller.

And at 190 pounds, Mark Graham
had the best Cardinal showing with a
third place finish and an automatic bid
to the NCAAs. Graham, the No. 2 seed,
lost in sudden death overtime to even
tual Pac-10 champion Jeff Monson of
Oregon State in the semifinals, but
rebounded to defeat Cal Poly-SLO's
Aaron Cantrell 12-3 and No. 1 seed
Jassen Froehlich 6-1.
"We did good and bad," said head
coach Chris Horpel. "Compared to last
year, we had two more place winners
and the same number of NCAA quali
fiers, but we did not produce any Pac
-10 Champions like last year.
"For the most part, overall team
performance was good, but things
could have been better if we pulled out
some of the close matches we had in
the semis. It is difficult to be at your
best in high-pressure situations," Hor
pel added.
The NCAA Championships will be
held on the weekend of March 19-21 in
Oklahoma City.
Graham, Johnson, Topham, and
possibly Jackson will compose the Car
dinal delegation that will compete for
All-American status.
