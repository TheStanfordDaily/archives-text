# Divers splash at Pac-10s

While many of the swimmers spent
the weekend vying for spots on the U.S.
Olympic team, the divers ventured to
Tucson for the Pacific 10 Champi
onships.
The women's team solidified their
stance as one of the nation's best by dom
inating both the one-meter and three
meter springboard competitions. Sopho
more Eileen Richetelli led the way by
placing second in the one-meter on Fri
day and following that up with victories
in the three-meter on Saturday and the
10-meter platform on Sunday.
Richetelli, a gold medalist at the Pan
Am games this past summer, was "sim
ply great" according to coach Rick
Schavone. "There wasn't any competi
tion" for her or the women's team as a
whole, and coach Schavone gushed about
his women's chances at the NCAA's.
Kristin Jensen and Melisa Kuller were
also spectactular, enabling the women to
take three out of the first four places in
all three events. "They're diving the best
they've ever dove," Schavone said of his

two senior stars.
Only two men competed for Stanford,
but both dove impressively enough to
make their presence felt by placing high
in the top ten. Freshman James Edwards
finished seventh in the three-meter and
fifth in the one-meter competition, a
result that Schavone wouldn't have pre
dicted for his young diver at the begin
ning of the year.
Coach Schavone had lowered his
expectations for the men's team when
captain Brad Wightman went down with
an injury earlier this year. But Mark
Kraus, a junior, finished fourth in both
events and missed the top three by the
narrowest of margins. With Wightman
gone, Kraus has emerged as Stanford's
best hope for the NCAA Championships.
"This puts me where I need to be for
nationals qualifying," Kraus said of his
diving over the past weekend. He battled
a stomach illness as well as the other
divers, and had hoped to place higher
than he did. Finishing as high as he did
despite the adversity raises his hopes for
the NCAA qualifying meet, to be held at
Brigham Young University in two weeks.
