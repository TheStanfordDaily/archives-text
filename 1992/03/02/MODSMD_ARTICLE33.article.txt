# Track competes at USC

Sometimes quantity DOES matter.
The Stanford track team, outnumbered
by as much as three to one in some events,
found themselves in a numbers crunch on
Saturday at USC. Competing in a quadran
gular meet with USC, UC-Irvine and Cal
State-Northridge, the Cardinal men fin
ished second and the women finished
fourth despite some strong individual per
formances.
"We only were able to take forty-two
athletes to this meet, about twenty men
and twenty women," said Stanford assis
tant coach Scott Chisam. "On the other
hand, Northridge took a warmup lap where
their runners stretched all the way around
the track.
"That's how it is with away meets.
There's just no way that you can compete
when you can't fill all the events."
As expected, the Cardinal led the field in
the men's throwing events as they swept
the hammer throw. Dave Popejoy finished
first after qualifying provisionally for the
NCAA Championships last week in the Bay
Area Relays.
Toby Norwood, finishing second, quali
fied for the Pacific 10 Championships with
a toss of 191 feet, two inches. Ramon Aler
con completed the sweep with a third place
throw of 180 feet, five inches.
"I really want to give the hammer
throwers some credit for their perfor
mance," said Chisam. "Their plane took off
an hour late and they were the first event

of the day. It's tough when you're getting
up at six in the morning for an 11 o'clock
meet."
In other men's competitions, Gary
Stohls and Dave Scudamore finished one
two in the 5,000 meter run with times of
14:51 and 14:58. In the 3,000 meter run,
Fred Carter, Stohls, and Scudamore fin
ished two-three-four as all three topped the
best Cardinal 3,000 meter time run in last
year's USC quadrangular meet.
Alex Accetta set a personal best time of
3:49.1 as he ran to a victory in the 1500
meters. He also won in the 800 meters with
a time of 1:51.24.
On the women's side Jackie Edwards
had the best day of any of the Cardinal,
according to Chisam.
Edwards won the triple and long jumps,
ran in the 400 meter relay team that took
second, and ran a 55.9 second lap in the
mile relay, which is the best 400 meter leg
time for the women in the mile relay this
year.
The meet also featured two of the top
NCAA women's sprinters in Stanford's
Chryste Gaines and USC's Ingrid Miller.
They tied for first in the 100 meter dash in
11.34 seconds.
"The photo they took at the finish line
could not distinguish who won the race.
That's how close it was," said Chisam.
"This was one of the fastest races Chryste
has ever won that wasn't wind-aided."
Next Saturday the Cardinal will be at
home against San Francisco State and
Sonoma State.
