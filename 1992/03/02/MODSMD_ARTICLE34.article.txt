# Spikers tangle with Matadors
## 
### Laurie Wackier Staff writer 
When Dave Goss recorded 55 kills against UCLA
early in the season, head volleyball coach Ruben
Nieves had one message: "That was no fluke."
In the five game upset over the Bruins, ranked sec
ond at the time, Stanford embarked on a crusade to
communicate their message.
Now, after compiling an 8-1 conference record and
climbing the national rankings from seventh to their
current No. 2 billing, the message is all too clear to
Stanford's opponents: Cardinal volleyball is no fluke.
The spikers have been chipping away at the elite
and leveling the mediocre all season. Last weekend,
the Cardinal avenged a pre-season loss to host Pep
perdine, depriving them of their No. 2 national rank
ing and claiming the spot for themselves.
Tonight at Burnham, Cal State-Northridge won't
need a prophet to read the writing on the wall. At 3-
1, the Matadors will have to come up with some
clever responses to answer the Cardinal challenge.
In a match against No. 4 UCLA last week, CS-
Northridge responded with an astute solution: in a
four game upset, middle blocker Ken Lynch led the
Matadors with 33 kills and 10 digs.
An interdivision match, tonight's contest features
the second place teams of the Western Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association. Stanford follows first-ranked
Long Beach State in the Wilson division, while the
Matadors are second to Pepperdine (currently ranked
third) in the Burt DeGroot division.
CS-Northridge will provide Stanford a final home
match before taking it on the road. The 7:00 match is
the spikers' last home contest until April.
