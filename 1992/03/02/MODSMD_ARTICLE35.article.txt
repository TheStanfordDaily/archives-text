# Golfers face tough test

It will be their final test before the sea
son begins in earnest.
For the Stanford Cardinal men's golf
team, the Ping Arizona Intercollegiate
Invitational, to take place today and
tomorrow in Tuscon, will be a litmus test
of how far they have come. The tourna
ment will be the Cardinal's last of winter
quarter, and it is the fall and winter com
petitions that give head coach Wally
Goodwin an idea of how competitive the
squad will be in spring's "crunch time" â€”
when the Pacific 10 and NCAA Champi
onship matches take place. "I feel that
this team will get more and more power
ful as the season goes on," Goodwin said.
Stanford's linksters had better give a
powerful showing over the next two days,
as they will be seeing many of their 17
opponents again. Included in the strong
field are 12 of the top 20 teams in the
nation, led by Pac-10 rivals Arizona (the
host school) and Arizona State, who share
the NCAA poll's top spot.

The Cardinal's delegates at this impor
tant event constitute a largely veteran
lineup. Stanford's top two golfers, sopho
more Notah Begay and senior Christian
Cevaer, will attend; they are neck-and
neck atop the Cardinal's individual
stroke-per-round rankings at 71.2 and
71.8, respectively. Juniors Mike Milliken
and Dave Rutkowski will make a return
to the lineup after missing last week's
Burns Invitational in Hawaii; both
golfers played most of last season and in
all of the Cardinal's fall tournaments this
year. Fresh man Steve Burdick will be the
only Stanford golfer appearing in the
Ping tournament who has no intercolle
giate experience.
Coach Goodwin feels that a team used
to playing together will play better. "This
older team has terrific chemistry," Good
win said.
What does Goodwin predict as the out
come of a midseason tournament at a
hostile site against the best the nation
has to offer?
"I'm sure they will do well," Goodwin
said. "They never disappoint me."
