# Cal barely beats women gymnasts
## 
### Brandi Shipp Staff writer 
The heat was on and the tension was
thick Friday night in Burnham Pavilion
as the Stanford women's gymnastics
team faced off in a three-way contest
against the gymnasts of Sacramento
State and California. While the Hornets
of Sacramento State proved to be no
real threat, the contest between the
18th-ranked Cardinal and the Bruins,
ranked No. 15, was like a game of tug-o
war, as the lead constantly changed
hands between the rivals. In the end,
however, Cal got the last decisive pull,
scoring 189.65, barely more than Stan
ford's 189.05. Sacramento State fin
ished far behind with a 180.5.
"I think that our team did a great
job, considering that our power was
dwindled," head coach Breck Green
wood said. Greenwood attributes the
Stanford loss to Cal primarily to a lack
of depth. As the Cardinal women add
more difficulty into their routines in
preparation for the Pacific 10 Confer
ence and NCAA Championships, they
become more prone to injuries.
Although these injuries are usually

minor, in a team pool of only nine peo
ple, even the smallest ripple can be felt.
Despite being outwomaned, the
Stanford gymnasts did their best to
prove that big things can come from lit
tle packages, or, in this case, little
teams. Unfortunately, the team's
injuries had an impact at the onset of
the meet. In two of the four events,
there were only five Cardinal women
competing, as opposed to the usual six.
Since the best five out of six scores are
usually tallied, every minor detail
counted for the Cardinal.
After the first two events, the Cal
gymnasts had a small, but noticeable,
lead over the Stanford women, who had
competed on the bars and the vault.
One of the highlights of the Cardinal's
bars performance was freshman Jene
Elzie smashing the old bar record of
9.70 with an incredible 9.85. This score
later gave Elzie second place in the indi
vidual event competition.
When Stanford headed to the beam
in the third rotation, however, the tide
started to roll the Cardinal's way. The
Stanford gymnasts had incredibly solid
beam performances, as none of the six
gymnasts had any falls on beam. Each

woman scored a 9.3 or better, and
injured freshman Katie Clancy scored a
9.8, which broke the old beam record of
9.75.
Clancy's strong beam performance
earned her the second place ribbon.
Sophomore Kerrie Kelley and Elzie fol
lowed not far behind, earning 9.7 and
9.65, respectively. When all of the
smoke cleared after the third rotation,
the Cardinal were on top of the Golden
Bears, with Sacramento State trailing
behind.
The entire meet came down to the
final event, as Stanford was on the floor
and the gymnasts from Cal were vault
ing. The Cardinal women started off with
a handicap, as only five gymnasts were
competing in this event. However, the
Cardinal women, hungry for a win over
Berkeley, had three major falls on floor
which cost them the event and the meet.
Despite the loss, the Stanford gym
nasts are still confident in their ability
to beat the higher-ranked teams,
including Cal. "When [both teams] are
healthy and hit all of our routines, we
think that we can beat them. Our time
will come and we will be tough to beat,"
Greenwood said.
