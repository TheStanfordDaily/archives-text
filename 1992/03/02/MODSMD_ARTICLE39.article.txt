# Women's celebration focuses on leaders
## 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
After a year in which Anita Hill
and the William Kennedy Smith
rape trial captivated the public's
attention, the timing seems right
to focus on women's issues.
But instead of highlighting the
problems women are facing, the
organizers of this year's Women's
Herstory Month Celebration
"wanted to focus on celebrating
women," said senior Amy Whit
comb, a member of the Women's
Center Collective.
"We deal with the problems
every day," agreed senior Kari
Rosenthal, a member of Kappa
Alpha Theta sorority. "So it's nice
to take a week and pat ourselves
on the back and look at how much
we've accomplished."
According to Whitcomb, "There's
already so many negative messages
out there saying 'women are being
oppressed.' But the focus of our pro
gram is very different."
The theme of this year's cele
bration, which begins today and
will run through March 8, is
"Women Taking the Lead: Creat
ing Choices for Ourselves."
And the week's events, spon
sored by the Women's Center
Collective in conjunction with
several other campus groups,
reflect this theme. Speeches will
be delivered by prominent women

leaders in politics, academia and
science.
"We want to start thinking
about ways that we can create
choices for ourselves," said
senior Jenn Pearson, a member
of the collective. "Instead of just
challenging male models of lead
ership, we want to take a step
back and think about what
we're trying to achieve — with
out using a reference that is
male."
In comparing men's and
women's styles of leadership,
senior Pamela Huberman said,
"I'm hesitant of making general
izations because women are just
as capable of being effective lead
ers as men. The key to good lead
ership is assertiveness, and
assertiveness is based on having
confidence that you have some
thing to offer."

A week of leaders
Pearson said this year's events
and speakers were selected to rep
resent a sampling of successful
women's leadership styles. They
were not, however, intended to be
exhaustive.
"I'm really thankful that we
can't talk about all of women's suc
cesses in one week," Pearson said.
This year's celebration drew on
a broader base of support than
ever before, organizers say.
Groups including Sisters in Stan
ford, Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford, Hillel, the
Martin Luther King Papers Pro
ject and MEChA, a Chicano/Lati
no student organization, support
ed the week's activities.
The week's events will kick off
today at 4 p.m. with the Women's
Center open house and reception
for their newly-formed advisory
board, which includes faculty,
staff and students.
Bell Hooks, a professor of
English at Oberlin College and
noted feminist author, will deliver
the celebration's keynote address,
"The Feminist Challenge: Insur
gent Leadership," in Kresge Audi
torium tonight.
Other speakers include Patricia
Hynes, professor of urban studies
at MIT and director of the Institute
for Women and Technology, who
will speak Tuesday about "The

Pocketbook and the Pill: Reflec
tions on Green Consumerism and
Population Control."
On Wednesday, UC-Berkeley
Linguistics Prof. Robin Lakoff,
who pioneered research on gender
differences in communication,
will speak about "Eradicating
Sexism in the English Language."
Dorothy Cotton, a civil rights
activist who worked with the late
Martin Luther King Jr., will pre
sent — or perform — "Songs and
Stories from the Civil Rights
Movement" in Ricker Dining Cen
ter Thursday.
Why 'Herstory'?
In choosing the leadership
theme for this year's celebration,
collective members said they tried
to determine — by distributing
surveys and holding informal
dorm discussions — which
women's issues were viewed as
most important by students.
Of the 300 completed surveys,
one common response questioned
the decision to call the celebration
"Women's Herstory Month."
The term "herstory" is a deliber
ate play on words, according to pro
gram organizers. The term draws
attention to the fact that "history,"
though not etymologically derived
from "his-story," has been male
dominated for centuries, and has
generally excluded women's
achievements and perspectives.

will run through March 8, is
"Women Taking the Lead: Creat
ing Choices for Ourselves."
And the week's events, spon
sored by the Women's Center
Collective in conjunction with
several other campus groups,
reflect this theme. Speeches will
be delivered by prominent women

leaders in politics, academia and
science.
"We want to start thinking
about ways that we can create
choices for ourselves," said
senior Jenn Pearson, a member
of the collective. "Instead of just
challenging male models of lead
ership, we want to take a step
back and think about what
we're trying to achieve — with
out using a reference that is
male."
In comparing men's and
women's styles of leadership,
senior Pamela Huberman said,
"I'm hesitant of making general
izations because women are just
as capable of being effective lead
ers as men. The key to good lead
ership is assertiveness, and
assertiveness is based on having
confidence that you have some
thing to offer."

A week of leaders
Pearson said this year's events
and speakers were selected to rep
resent a sampling of successful
women's leadership styles. They
were not, however, intended to be
exhaustive.
"I'm really thankful that we
can't talk about all of women's suc
cesses in one week," Pearson said.
This year's celebration drew on
a broader base of support than
ever before, organizers say.
Groups including Sisters in Stan
ford, Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford, Hillel, the
Martin Luther King Papers Pro
ject and MEChA, a Chicano/Lati
no student organization, support
ed the week's activities.
The week's events will kick off
today at 4 p.m. with the Women's
Center open house and reception
for their newly-formed advisory
board, which includes faculty,
staff and students.
Bell Hooks, a professor of
English at Oberlin College and
noted feminist author, will deliver
the celebration's keynote address,
"The Feminist Challenge: Insur
gent Leadership," in Kresge Audi
torium tonight.
Other speakers include Patricia
Hynes, professor of urban studies
at MIT and director of the Institute
for Women and Technology, who
will speak Tuesday about "The

Pocketbook and the Pill: Reflec
tions on Green Consumerism and
Population Control."
On Wednesday, UC-Berkeley
Linguistics Prof. Robin Lakoff,
who pioneered research on gender
differences in communication,
will speak about "Eradicating
Sexism in the English Language."
Dorothy Cotton, a civil rights
activist who worked with the late
Martin Luther King Jr., will pre
sent — or perform — "Songs and
Stories from the Civil Rights
Movement" in Ricker Dining Cen
ter Thursday.
Why 'Herstory'?
In choosing the leadership
theme for this year's celebration,
collective members said they tried
to determine — by distributing
surveys and holding informal
dorm discussions — which
women's issues were viewed as
most important by students.
Of the 300 completed surveys,
one common response questioned
the decision to call the celebration
"Women's Herstory Month."
The term "herstory" is a deliber
ate play on words, according to pro
gram organizers. The term draws
attention to the fact that "history,"
though not etymologically derived
from "his-story," has been male
dominated for centuries, and has
generally excluded women's
achievements and perspectives.
