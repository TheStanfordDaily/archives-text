# Paaso powers her way to Gladiator gold
## 
### Leigh Burnside Staff writer 
Junior Kristi Paaso took the gold medal at
the American Gladiators competition Satur
day at the Cow Palace.
Paaso, a varsity volleyball player, was ini
tially told she could not compete because it
might violate her amateur status. She was
allowed to participate because the show will
not be televised and is therefore permissible
under NCAA regulations.
"I was kind of intimidated by Ice," Paaso
said of the five-foot seven-inch, 155-pound
gladiator who toppled her from the Joust com
petition. "But it was a fun time."
Paaso defeated three other Bay Area
women by amassing the most points in the
Assault, the Wall, Powerball, Atlasphere,
Joust and the Eliminator. The events involve
a test of strength and skill as the competitors

battle against the Gladiators: women of
incredible size and muscular proportion.
In Assault, the first event, gladiator Diamond
eliminated Paaso by firing a tennis ball at her head.
According to the announcer, the balls reach
speeds of more than 100 miles an hour. Paaso
was wearing a helmet and escaped uninjured.
The second event — the Wall — had her
attempting to scale a 35-foot wall with gladia
tor Jazz in hot pursuit. Paaso came within
seven feet of the top before being pulled down
by the red-white-and-blue lycra-clad gladiator.
But Paaso scored three goals in Powerball,
in which contestants scored points by
attempting to place balls in three containers
against the efforts of gladiators who tried to
wrestle them to the ground.
After the first round of competition and the
elimination of the two lowest scorers, Paaso
said, "It's been a lot of fun.... I really like the
challenge."

"There's a lot more pressure after the first
three events," she added, "but I like to do it."
She clinched the victory in the second
round, despite an embarrassingly early exit
from the Joust in which Ice knocked her off
the platform in four seconds.
Paaso beat her opponent to the finish line
with ease in the final event, the Eliminator,
which pits contestants against each other in
an obstacle-course race.
Paaso said her interest stemmed from a
history of watching and enjoying the show.
Her 23-year-old sister Tracy, a former
track-and-field athlete at the University of
Oregon, will participate in a televised broad
cast of the show later this year.
Vic Chao, a junior mechanical engineering
student and Stanford cheerleader, also com
peted but did not qualify for the second round.
"I feel really good," Chao said after his last
event."I just need a lot of Bactine."
