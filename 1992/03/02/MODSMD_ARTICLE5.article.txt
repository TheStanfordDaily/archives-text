# Unexplained 'ill will' behind burning bush
## Arson at Dekes marks fifth dangerous act 
### Leigh Burnside Staff writer 
In what police say could be the fifth
potentially lethal act aimed at the Delta
Kappa Epsilon fraternity in less than a
year, an unidentified person set fire to a
bush outside the fraternity's house shortly
after midnight Friday.
The attempted arson was the second vio
lent crime committed against the fraterni
ty within the past month, according to
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
It follows a February incident in which
the gas jets in the house's kitchen were
turned completely on and the pilot lights
were shut off.
"Somebody really has ill will for reasons
we have not been able to determine,"
Niemeyer said.
Deke member John Pink, a junior,
smelled smoke, saw the bush on fire and

subsequently put out the flames with a fire
extinguisher, Niemeyer said.
Pink was unable to give the police a phys
ical description of the suspect. He reported
ly chased a car that was leaving the scene
and dislocated his shoulder in the process.
Police were unable to collect enough phys
ical evidence to make an arrest, Niemeyer
said. He added that it is "too early to make
any comments about how it's going to go."
The fire was apparently started with an
electric charcoal lighter, Niemeyer said.
Deke members said they have been told
by fraternity leaders not to talk about the
incident.
John Momtazee, the fraternity's presi
dent, did not return repeated phone calls
made to his room this weekend. Pink also
did not return calls.
Interfraternity Council President Steve
Jarrett said last month that pub
licity about the incidents is
unwelcome because it might hurt
the Dekes' spring Rush.
In a similar incident that
occurred on Feb. 4, a still-at-large
suspect entered the Deke kitchen,
shut off the oven pilot lights and
allowed the gas to free-flow, a sit
uation Detective Tim Frecceri
described as having "a great
potential for danger."
Fraternity members reported
two separate incidents of
attempted poisoning last April in

which coffee and grape juice were
tainted with plant fertilizer and
paint thinner, repectively.
A suspect also started a fire in
the kitchen that month by melt
ing two 54-ounce containers of
lighter fluid in the oven.
No arrests have been made in
any of the incidents.
After the two incidents in April,
Deke members improved the
house's security by rekeying the
building and installing automatic
locking fixtures on the doors.
Momtazee said after the Feb. 4
incident that there was "no cause
for alarm."
But a Deke member who asked
not to be identified said Friday
that "it's really kind of scary."
