# Student dies after fall
## Friends remember her as 'courageous' 
### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
Sophomore Amy Potter, remembered by
her friends as a comforting confidante and
an engaging wit, died early yesterday
morning at Stanford Medical Center.
Last night, friends and fellow Kimball
residents gathered to discuss her loss and
support each other in their grief.
Potter spent nearly a week at the medi
cal center after she fell in a local Safeway,
fracturing her skull. Friends and doctors
watched her improve last week, then suffer
a fatal blood clot yesterday morning.
Friends remembered her slightly sarcas
tic sense of humor, her penchant for story
telling and her tireless good cheer. They
described her as the person people went to
when they needed a lift.
"She took a personal interest in every
one aroundJtier," said sophomore Carolyn
Baek. "She liked meeting people. She liked
having a good time."
"She made everyone feel at ease immedi
ately," said Kimball Resident Fellow
Angela Rickford. "She was always encour
aging, asking me how my day was, or if I
had a cold, telling me to take this or that,"
she said. "She was such a strong woman."
Rickford said Kimball is "in shambles"

over Potter's death.
Fellow members of the Kappa Alpha
Theta sorority gathered in the Quad last
night to remember Potter.
Friends said they had admired Potter's
courage in the face of a childhood immune
disease that devastated her muscle tissue,
making walking difficult. Potter herself
planned to become a physician, hoping to
specialize in childhood illnesses.
"She was very frail and fragile," said
Kimball RF John Rickford. "Yet she was
remarkably strong and courageous. You
could never feel sorry for her. She wouldn't
allow it."
Friends remembered the way her sense
of humor and stocked refrigerator made
her room a constant gathering place.
Nadine Skuble, a sophomore who lived in
Twain with Potter last year, said, "Amy was
the best person I met my freshman year.
She was always happy and always in a good
mood. She made the dorm very special."
Angela Rickford said, "She was always in
control, despite the fact that life must have
been, at times, incredibly painful for her.
She had such dignity and maturity for such
a young girl. At 19 she knew so much."
