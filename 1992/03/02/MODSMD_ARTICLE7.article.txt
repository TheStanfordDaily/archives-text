# Biddle postpones exit, reviewing legal documents

### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
He's going .. . going. .. but not quite gone.
Paul Biddle, the on-campus Navy regulator,
postponed his resignation Friday, saying it is
unlikely he will stay on the job any later than
Wednesday.
"The General Counsel of the Navy wants me to
review documents relevant to litigation and admin
istrative proceedings," Biddle said. "The work they
want me to complete is germane to their efforts to
enforce the government's rights."
But the Navy says that Biddle has chosen on his
own to postpone his resignation.
"Biddle informed us early this morning that he
would not be leaving at this time," said Norm Han
son, spokesman for the Office of Naval Research.
"He said he needs the time to consult with his attor
neys over some materials we sent him."
Biddle announced two weeks ago that he would
be resigning at the end of February to pursue a run
for Congress.
"The decision to delay his retirment was all news
to us. We had assumed that he was going to do what
he said, but we accept that he is going to delay
things," Hanson said.
But Biddle said, "I don't know what Norm Han
son is talking about. They couldn't get the materials
to me in time to answer their questions, and so I
remained on the job at their request."
Hanson said Biddle postponed his resignation to
review "legal materials dealing with the conflict of
interest." He declined to provide any more informa
tion and said the Navy lawyers would also have no
comment.
The University has charged
that Biddle has been in a conflict
of interest in his position at Stan
ford since October.
At that time, he filed a qui tam
suit alleging that the University
overtoiled the government by $480
million in indirect costs and other
expenses. Biddle could recover up
to 30 percent of any damages.
"The conflict of interest per
sists, and we remain concerned
about that," said Larry Horton,
associate vice president for public
affairs. "There has been no change
in the situation."

Although Biddle initially
would not say that the documents
involve the conflict of interest, he
did acknowledge that "part, of it
relates to those allegations. But I
am not at liberty" to provide any
more information.
Biddle said he is now gearing
up to campaign for the 14th Con
gressional District, which will
become vacant as Rep. Tom
Campbell, R-Stanford, runs for
Senate.
He said his supporters have
completed gathering the signa
tures necessary for him to join the
Republican primary in January,
and said it is likely his petitions
will be accepted by the end of this
week and he will be declared an
official candidate.
