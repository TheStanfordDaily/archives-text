# Biddle postpones exit, reviewing legal documents

### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
He's going .. . going. .. but not quite gone.
Paul Biddle, the on-campus Navy regulator,
postponed his resignation Friday, saying it is
unlikely he will stay on the job any later than
Wednesday.
"The General Counsel of the Navy wants me to
review documents relevant to litigation and admin
istrative proceedings," Biddle said. "The work they
want me to complete is germane to their efforts to
enforce the government's rights."
But the Navy says that Biddle has chosen on his
own to postpone his resignation.
"Biddle informed us early this morning that he
would not be leaving at this time," said Norm Han
son, spokesman for the Office of Naval Research.
"He said he needs the time to consult with his attor
neys over some materials we sent him."
Biddle announced two weeks ago that he would
be resigning at the end of February to pursue a run
for Congress.
"The decision to delay his retirment was all news
to us. We had assumed that he was going to do what
he said, but we accept that he is going to delay
things," Hanson said.
But Biddle said, "I don't know what Norm Han
son is talking about. They couldn't get the materials
to me in time to answer their questions, and so I
remained on the job at their request."
Hanson said Biddle postponed his resignation to
review "legal materials dealing with the conflict of
interest." He declined to provide any more informa
tion and said the Navy lawyers would also have no
comment.
