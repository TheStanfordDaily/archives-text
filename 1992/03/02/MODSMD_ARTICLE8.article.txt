College Bowl team advances to nationals
College Bowl may be similar to Jeopardy, but "it's not as easy,"
said team member John Overdeck, referring to Stanford's win
this weekend over Pomona College in the Western Regional Col
lege Bowl tournament in Sacramento.
Seventeen teams from all over California took part in the tour
nament this weekend. The Stanford team played 15 games, and
only lost one against Cal State-Los Angeles, Overdeck said.
Winning the Western Regional gives the Stanford team the
chance to participate in the National College Bowl championship
that will take place in April in Washington, D.C.
Sixteen teams from all over the country go to the national
tournament in Washington.
Last year Stanford was sixth in the national tournament, and
the team hopes to win this year. "I think we have a chance," said
Overdeck, a graduate student in statistics.
"We are a more balanced team than last year," said team cap
tain Douglas Bone, a graduate student in electrical engineering.
The team's other members are juniors Dave Frazee and Steve Lin
and freshman Gerard Magliocca.
The College Bowl team has been practicing every Monday since
November. Practices take place mostly in the ASSU office.
"We've taken over a lot of ASSU space," Overdeck said.
"They're both very trivial pursuits."
