# Greek groups make good Friends for Youth
## 
### Leigh Burnside Staff writer 
As part of a redesigned Greek
Week 1992, members from every
sorority and fraternity participat
ed in a community service day
with the Friends for Youth orga
nization Friday.
The four-hour event in the
Oval involved 19 elementary and
middle school-aged children from
various East Palo Alto and Red
wood City schools.
Friends for Youth is an organi
zation that pairs underprivileged
children with "senior friends" to
provide a positive role model in
their lives.
Divided into groups of five, the
children attended four 20-minute
workshops led by students, who
discussed listening skills, study
skills, environmental issues and
leadership skills, according to ser
vice day organizer and Theta Xi
member Jason Pate.
They spent the rest of the
afternoon playing games like soc
cer and frisbee and feasting on
free pizza provided by the Oasis
and Pizza-a-Go-Go.
"Eat, eat, eat, eat," cried 9-
year-old Ernie Feddersen of
Henry Ford Elementary School in
Redwood City as he smeared his
beaming face with pizza sauce.
Greek Week co-organizer and
Sigma Chi member Rip Waters
said the event "was good for the
kids and good for us, too."
Waters called it a "big activity
for the IFC and ISC," whose goal,
he said, was to assure the children

'Eat, eat, eat, eat.'

Feddersen, 9

that there are "people that care
about them and really want to be
their friends."
Organizers originally planned
to invite youngsters from the
Stanford area, but decided instead
to invite underprivileged children
who are still on the waiting list to
receive a senior friend.
The community service day
was part of a five-day educational
and celebratory event the Greek
system conducted through Satur
day.
While previous Greek Weeks
consisted of "three parties and a
canned food drive," this year's
activities focused more on multi
cultural issues in order to "show
the campus there's a lot more to
being Greek than the impression
sometimes given," Waters said.
Tuesday's event was a two
hour multicultural program led
by Multicultural Educator Greg
Ricks, attended by about 70 stu
dents.
Most students "don't usually
relate the Greek system and mul
ticulturalism together," Waters
said, contending that "we care
about these issues."
Waters and Pate said they hope
to see the community service day
with the Friends for Youth orga
nization become an annual event.
