# New CIV courses in the works
## Drama Dept. administrator: It's 'crass,' but it's for money 
### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
Four new Cultures, Ideas and Values
tracks — three of them slated to begin this
fall — have been recommended by the
committee that oversees the CIV program.
The new courses — "Science, Litera
ture, and the Imagination," "Myth and
Modernity," "Performance and Cul
ture" and"The (In)Human(ities)" —
are the only new tracks other than
"Europe and the Americas" proposed
since CIV began in 1988.
Ronald Davies, the Drama Depart
ment administrator who proposed the
"Performance and Culture" track said
the reason behind the proposals is
"crass" — "It's for money," he said.
Departments sponsoring the new
CIV courses get "credit" toward their
own departmental budgets for removing

a teaching load from the CIV program,
Davies said
Proposals for the new courses were
submitted by individual departments
and recommended by a subcommittee of
the Committee on Undergraduate Stud
ies. The full committee will make the
final decision on the CIV tracks at an
undecided future date.
Financial motives
Davies said the CIV program current
ly spends a certain amount of money pay
ing "para-faculty" — the lecturers and
the graduate student teaching assistants
— to teach the CIV courses. Depart
ments can save the program's money by
having their own faculty and graduate
students, who are already on the depart
ment payrolls, teach those courses.
Each of the four courses is expected
to include three sections of 18 students,

according to History Prof. Paul Seaver,
the chair of the subcommittee making
the recommendation.
The nine new sections created for
next year's three additional CIV classes
would allow existing CIV tracks to drop
nine sections. The program could then
cut lecturers, saving about $40,000 in
salary and benefits for each lecturer
they eliminate, Davies said.
Although the proposals are budget
driven, students may find the results
beneficial because of the increased fac
ulty involvement, said Davies. "That
was in the original conception of CIV —
that students were going to be taught by
regular faculty," he said.
But the greatest cost of the new CIV
courses is that faculty teaching CIV
"won't be free to teach other courses" in


G.B Manriquez — Daily
their department, Seaver said.
Ambitious proposals
Seaver said the proposals,
which were submitted in early
January, were initiated by the
departments. The subcommittee
then went over the four proposals
and made suggestions to the
respective departments.
"The main problem with most
of them was that they were too
ambitious," Seaver said. "They
were too complex and required
too much reading, so we asked
them to scale it down."

In a report filed at the ASSU
office, committee member Amy
Feldman, a sophomore, explained
other reasons the subcommittee
approved the applications.
One was to reduce the large
class sizes in the current tracks,
the report said.
Another factor was fear the
that the existing CIV tracks may
lose faculty interest, according to
Feldman's report.
Descriptions of the new cours
es have already been submitted to
Approaching Stanford, a hand
book sent to incoming freshmen
and transfer students.
"Myth and Modernity" is spon
sored by the German Studies
Department. The proposal, writ
ten by German Prof. Russell

Berman, says the course will
examine "the continued viability
of some mythic forms in moderni
ty, as well as the modernity inher
ent in some myths," focusing on
"literature, logos and language."
The Drama Department pro
posed "Performance and Cul
ture," which Davies said will
focus on "a broader definition of
performance, including public
ceremonies and activities."
The faculty teaching "The
(In)human(ities)" will be from the
Departments of Comparative Lit
erature and History of Science.
Prof. Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht,
the comparative literature chair,
said he hoped the course would
incorporate more of the sciences
into CIV, which he said is cur

rently "humanities-based."
A CIV course sponsored by the
French and Italian department,
"Science, Literature and the
Imagination," will begin in 1993-
94, since French and Italian Prof.
John Freccero, the main lecturing
professor, will be at Stanford-in-
Florence next year.
According to the proposal, the
course will examine "some of the
imaginative patterns that litera
ture and the sciences seem to
have in common."
Seaver said the tracks will initial
ly be "experimental. . . . Once
they've launched them, they proba
bly won't be taught every year — the
Drama Department and the French
and Italian Department are so small
that it would be hard to," he said.

erature and History of Science.
Prof. Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht,
the comparative literature chair,
said he hoped the course would
incorporate more of the sciences
into CIV, which he said is cur

rently "humanities-based."
A CIV course sponsored by the
French and Italian department,
"Science, Literature and the
Imagination," will begin in 1993-
94, since French and Italian Prof.
John Freccero, the main lecturing
professor, will be at Stanford-in-
Florence next year.
According to the proposal, the
course will examine "some of the
imaginative patterns that litera
ture and the sciences seem to
have in common."
Seaver said the tracks will initial
ly be "experimental. . . . Once
they've launched them, they proba
bly won't be taught every year — the
Drama Department and the French
and Italian Department are so small
that it would be hard to," he said.
Four new Cultures, Ideas and Values
tracks — three of them slated to begin this
fall — have been recommended by the
committee that oversees the CIV program.
The new courses — "Science, Litera
ture, and the Imagination," "Myth and
Modernity," "Performance and Cul
ture" and"The (In)Human(ities)" —
are the only new tracks other than
"Europe and the Americas" proposed
since CIV began in 1988.
Ronald Davies, the Drama Depart
ment administrator who proposed the
"Performance and Culture" track said
the reason behind the proposals is
"crass" — "It's for money," he said.
Departments sponsoring the new
CIV courses get "credit" toward their
own departmental budgets for removing

a teaching load from the CIV program,
Davies said
Proposals for the new courses were
submitted by individual departments
and recommended by a subcommittee of
the Committee on Undergraduate Stud
ies. The full committee will make the
final decision on the CIV tracks at an
undecided future date.
Financial motives
Davies said the CIV program current
ly spends a certain amount of money pay
ing "para-faculty" — the lecturers and
the graduate student teaching assistants
— to teach the CIV courses. Depart
ments can save the program's money by
having their own faculty and graduate
students, who are already on the depart
ment payrolls, teach those courses.
Each of the four courses is expected
to include three sections of 18 students,

according to History Prof. Paul Seaver,
the chair of the subcommittee making
the recommendation.
The nine new sections created for
next year's three additional CIV classes
would allow existing CIV tracks to drop
nine sections. The program could then
cut lecturers, saving about $40,000 in
salary and benefits for each lecturer
they eliminate, Davies said.
Although the proposals are budget
driven, students may find the results
beneficial because of the increased fac
ulty involvement, said Davies. "That
was in the original conception of CIV —
that students were going to be taught by
regular faculty," he said.
But the greatest cost of the new CIV
courses is that faculty teaching CIV
"won't be free to teach other courses" in


G.B Manriquez — Daily
their department, Seaver said.
Ambitious proposals
Seaver said the proposals,
which were submitted in early
January, were initiated by the
departments. The subcommittee
then went over the four proposals
and made suggestions to the
respective departments.
"The main problem with most
of them was that they were too
ambitious," Seaver said. "They
were too complex and required
too much reading, so we asked
them to scale it down."

In a report filed at the ASSU
office, committee member Amy
Feldman, a sophomore, explained
other reasons the subcommittee
approved the applications.
One was to reduce the large
class sizes in the current tracks,
the report said.
Another factor was fear the
that the existing CIV tracks may
lose faculty interest, according to
Feldman's report.
Descriptions of the new cours
es have already been submitted to
Approaching Stanford, a hand
book sent to incoming freshmen
and transfer students.
"Myth and Modernity" is spon
sored by the German Studies
Department. The proposal, writ
ten by German Prof. Russell

Berman, says the course will
examine "the continued viability
of some mythic forms in moderni
ty, as well as the modernity inher
ent in some myths," focusing on
"literature, logos and language."
The Drama Department pro
posed "Performance and Cul
ture," which Davies said will
focus on "a broader definition of
performance, including public
ceremonies and activities."
The faculty teaching "The
(In)human(ities)" will be from the
Departments of Comparative Lit
erature and History of Science.
