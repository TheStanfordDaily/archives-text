# New CIV courses in the works
## Drama Dept. administrator: It's 'crass,' but it's for money 
### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
Four new Cultures, Ideas and Values
tracks — three of them slated to begin this
fall — have been recommended by the
committee that oversees the CIV program.
The new courses — "Science, Litera
ture, and the Imagination," "Myth and
Modernity," "Performance and Cul
ture" and"The (In)Human(ities)" —
are the only new tracks other than
"Europe and the Americas" proposed
since CIV began in 1988.
Ronald Davies, the Drama Depart
ment administrator who proposed the
"Performance and Culture" track said
the reason behind the proposals is
"crass" — "It's for money," he said.
Departments sponsoring the new
CIV courses get "credit" toward their
own departmental budgets for removing

a teaching load from the CIV program,
Davies said
Proposals for the new courses were
submitted by individual departments
and recommended by a subcommittee of
the Committee on Undergraduate Stud
ies. The full committee will make the
final decision on the CIV tracks at an
undecided future date.
Financial motives
Davies said the CIV program current
ly spends a certain amount of money pay
ing "para-faculty" — the lecturers and
the graduate student teaching assistants
— to teach the CIV courses. Depart
ments can save the program's money by
having their own faculty and graduate
students, who are already on the depart
ment payrolls, teach those courses.
Each of the four courses is expected
to include three sections of 18 students,

according to History Prof. Paul Seaver,
the chair of the subcommittee making
the recommendation.
The nine new sections created for
next year's three additional CIV classes
would allow existing CIV tracks to drop
nine sections. The program could then
cut lecturers, saving about $40,000 in
salary and benefits for each lecturer
they eliminate, Davies said.
Although the proposals are budget
driven, students may find the results
beneficial because of the increased fac
ulty involvement, said Davies. "That
was in the original conception of CIV —
that students were going to be taught by
regular faculty," he said.
But the greatest cost of the new CIV
courses is that faculty teaching CIV
"won't be free to teach other courses" in
