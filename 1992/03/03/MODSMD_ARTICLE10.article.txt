Guidelines proposed by
task force suggest ways
to facilitate HIV testing

INSTITUTING FREE, anony
mous HIV testing at Cowell
Student Health Center will be
an important first battle in the
war against a deadly disease.
The switch from confidential,
$20 tests to free tests that never
link results with a name has been
called for in the HIV Infection
Education Task Force's newly
released guidelines.
The task force announced last
week that it plans to have the new
system — under which peer coun
selors would replace physicians in
advising those being tested — in
place by next quarter. These
changes represent only a small
segment of the guidelines, but they
are the most important in terms of
community impact.
The importance of this new ser
vice becomes especially clear in
light of the rising demand for test
ing at Cowell. The number of peo
ple undergoing HIV testing has
more than doubled in the past
three years, going from 163 in
1988 to 379 last year.
The health center already has
an efficient system in place, as
results are available within three
to nine days, while many other Bay
Area testing sites require at least
two weeks.
Also, while Cowell's previous
lack af anonymity may have made
some people hesitant about being
tested, their system was actually
more private than the "confiden
tial" testing at most medical facili
ties, since Cowell results do not go
on permanent health records.
Besides encouraging members of
the Stanford community to undergo
testing for the virus that causes
AIDS, the changes will also give stu
dents a chance to learn more about
the disease as peer counselors.
The switch from doctor to stu

dent counseling will save the cen
ter about 100 "physician-hours"
per month, which should make up
for the testing costs, previously
subsidized by the $20 fee.
While the task force did have
concerns that people who wanted
to be tested would worry about
knowing the peer counselor, they
found a workable solution: They
plan to post a list of counselors and
their schedules so those being test
ed can choose an appropriate time.
One hurdle Cowell will have to
overcome is finding and training
these counselors. There are only
three available right now, and
many more will be needed to make
the service easily accessible.
Also, the period before and direct
ly after testing provides an ideal
opportunity to educate the person
being tested, so it is imperative that
the quality of the counseling does
not suffer because of the change to
peer counselors.
These peer counselors could be
available to answer questions and
hold presentations as well. Accord
ing to a national survey, one in 500
college students is infected with
Hiy and there have been students
and faculty members here at Stan
ford who have already succumbed
to the disease.
Yet widespread education is a rel
atively new phenomena. The shock
and confusion expressed after Magic
Johnson's October announcement
that he is HIV positive shattered the
perception that most people are well
educated about AIDS. Cowell's
newest counselors could help clear
up some of the confusion and
encourage testing.
There are still some procedural
decisions to be made about the new
testing system. For example, it has
not been determined whether test
ing will be done by appointment or
on a walk-in basis. While it might
be more difficult and costly, walk-in
testing is far preferable.
The urgency of the AIDS epidem
ic mandates the removal of all barri
ers between community members
and HIV testing. The task force's
proposals may save a few lives.
