## Identity: freedom to choose 
### 
A PERSISTENT QUESTION in the
development of multiculturalism at
Stanford has been the place for
white American students.
Some feel guilt for their positions of
privilege. Others feel that they will be
attacked and declared a racist for any mis
construed comment or question involving
race. Just describing someone by their race
can be problematic. Others feel excluded
from the "celebration of diversity." They
ask, What culture can we celebrate ?
As a writer, I have been inspired by
Alice Walker and other African-American
authors who wrote with a sense of their
history of discrimination.
I used to wish that I had my own great
historical injustice to give me strength, to
make me righteous and legitimate my
writing, and to give me something worth
while to write about in the first place.
But my parents didn't come through
Angel Island or Ellis Island. They didn't
come here to escape persecution. They
weren't here yet during the Japanese
internment, even though they are Chi
nese anyway. So what could I write from ?
What perverse thoughts.
1c is this kind of reasoning that leads
us to think that we have no culture of our
own or that we need to be some sort of
minority and face discrimination to feel
acceptable instead of feeling like a mem
ber of the privileged class responsible for
the problems that exist today.

I finally realized that I couldn't go
looking for some injustice to write about.
I could only draw upon myself, my own
experiences and feelings. And whatever
that was, it would be enough. Alice Walk
er, James Baldwin and Richard Wright
wrote from their own beliefs and strug
gles, not what they have learned in a
book. Not to be politically correct. Not to
capitalize on a trend.
Where does identity come from? Some
people think that today many Americans,
particularly those of our generation, are
"lost" in this society because they have
no heritage. If you are Mexican-American
but don't speak Spanish. If you are
Native American but don't live on a
reservation. If you are white but don't
know where your ancestors came from.
But who can determine our identities
except ourselves? Who can tell us what it
means to be Asian-American, African-
American, or "white American"? Who
can tell us that we are not American?
It is only in the past two years that I
have come to acknowledge and identify
myself as a Chinese-American. I am not
representative of the Asian community.
My identification with other Asian-Amer
icans stems from an interest in issues
such as the lack of recognized, published
Asian-American writers. My concern for
the victims of hate crimes. A letter
promising "death to all former internees"
sent to a Marin County Buddhist church.

'We think
we need
to face
discrimination
to feel
accepted.'

A Japanese-American man killed in Los
Angeles two weeks after an unemployed
man came to his house asking for money,
blaming the Japanese for the fact that he
lost his job.
We find strength in different places.
When a white American tells me they
have no culture, I ask them to look
around and remember their lives, their
experiences.
Identity is shaped by experiences,
which in turn determine our beliefs. Not
everyone needs to find strength in eth
nicity; however, those who don't identify
should not do so because they are
ashamed of their cultural heritage. I was
no less of a person when I did not identi
fy myself as Asian-American. And even
now I am not singularly defined by eth
nicity. I am a woman. I am a writer. I am
an American.
Now is the time for us to question who
we are. We need to be comfortable with
our own identities and understand the
source for our identification. Then we
will understand why someone may cele
brate their ethnicity, and we will not per
ceive it as a threat to ourselves.
