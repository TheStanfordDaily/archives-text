Diverse entertainment offered by CoHo being threatened

HOW MANY PEOPLE ENJOYED
the Bay Area Blues Society in the
Coffee House last Thursday?
For those who missed out, it was a co
sponsored by the Alpha Phi Alpha Fra
ternity, the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority
and the Coffee House as part of the cele
bration of Black Liberation Month.
Now imagine the Coffee House with
out music. Imagine the Coffee House
without acoustic folk music on Tuesday
evenings and without the Thursday
Night Jazz series.
What would the Coffee House be like
without professional stand up comedy
and improvisation troupes in February?
No Alex Gregory?

What would the Coffee House really
be like if it did not host the livest bi
monthly dance party on campus? Hip-
Hop Night killed? Can you hear the
silence?
Well, no, you can't, because you
would be hearing "Brown Eyed Girl"
100 times a day. Hope you enjoy those
17 compact discs, because without live
music and a diverse programming calen
dar in the Coffee House, your only musi
cal outlet would be the jukebox.
The Coffee House Concert Series
shares a history as diverse as the Coffee
House itself. Born of the same 1960s
student activist spirit that transformed
the Tresidder Memorial Student Union

ping-pong parlor into a sit-in space
where people brought their own coffee
and their own music, the Concert Series
has evolved into a fabulously popular
program which brings live music to the
Coffee House twice a week.
The Coffee House Concert Series will
be eliminated next year due to budget
cuts. Tresidder, which currently funds
the entertainment in the Coffee House,
is cutting its overall budget by 42 per
cent and its Programs Budget by 98 per
cent.
If music is to survive in the Coffee
House, it needs to be on the ASSU Spe
cial Fee ballot. Because the ASSU Sen
ate rejected our fee proposal, the Cof

fee House Concert Series needs a peti
tion with 20 percent of student signa
tures.
If we do not get the required 20 per
cent, then the Coffee House Concert
Series will not appear on the ballot this
spring; music and the diverse program
ming calendar offered in the Coffee
House will be dead.
Entertainment and musical program
ming in the Coffee House will not exist
without your help and your vote.
Together let us make music and contin
ue the tradition of diversity in the Coffee
House.
