# Network brings artists to on-campus concerts
## 
### 
I am writing on behalf of the 1991-92
Concert Network staff in response to
Thursday's article in The Daily about
the Network's being denied a spot on the
fee-request ballot by the ASSU Senate.
The Concert Network has been book
ing contemporary music events at Stan
ford for a decade, and has brought such
artists as Santana, Frank Zappa, EMF,
Joan Baez, The Grateful Dead, Kenny G,
Miles Davis, Jay Leno and The Red Hot
Chili Peppers.
Even during a time of economic
crunch, the organization has managed to
produce over ten concerts since last
August, seven of which were provided
free for Stanford students. And we have
at least six more presently in the works
(two of them are summer shows in Frost
Amphitheater, and another two will be
free events).
We are circulating petitions with a
clarified information packet in order to
assure a place on the spring ballot. We
need student funding to continue quality

on-campus concert programming next
year, a year when Coffee House and
Noontime Concerts may be entirely
eliminated and the Lively Arts faces cut
backs as well.
Likewise, the Music and Drama
departments are facing cuts, adding to a
dismal future for live performance on
campus. It sounds like next year's choic
es for weekly live entertainment will be
watching your roommate's ant farm or
the settling of the dust when the "big
one" finally hits Memorial Church.
When the music's over ... Turn out the
lights .. .
— Jim Morrison
Something touched me deep inside, the
day the music died. . .
— Don McLean
Okay, so the quotes are corny. But they
illustrate an important point.
Our organization has been dedicated
to producing a wide range of affordable,
quality events for students on campus,
especially for those who do not own cars
or find it difficult to get off campus to
see concerts.

Although we have difficulty securing
on-campus venues and making the dates
coincide with the touring schedules of the
bands we wish to promote, this year's
season has been quite successful and next
year's promises to be even better.
