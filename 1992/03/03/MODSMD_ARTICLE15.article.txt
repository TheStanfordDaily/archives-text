# Novosibirsk program is link to life in Russia
## 
### 
The Stanford-Novosibirsk Exchange
is seeking a 5.7 percent increase in its
special fee, which was not placed on the
ballot by the ASSU Senate last week.
The reason ASSU Senator Doug Bone
gave against our request was that the
Exchange "mostly benefits people in
Novosibirsk."
This very narrow and uninformed
point of view does not take into account
the benefits Stanford students receive
from a cross-cultural program such as
ours. It is true that the bulk of the funds
will be used to bring the Russians to Stan
ford; however, Stanford students receive
tremendous benefits from this program.

The Stanford-Novosibirsk Exchange
places twelve Russian students in six
dormitories across campus. Clearly, all
of the students in these dormitories ben
efit from interaction and exchange of
ideas with their Russian guests.
Stanford alumni participate in the
Exchange by hosting the students from
Novosibirsk on excursions in California.
Additional dormitories and fraternities
host the Russians for dinners and pro
grams during their time here at Stan
ford.
In these times of rapid change within
the former Soviet Union, the view we
receive of life in Russia is extremely pes
simistic. The ability to interact with stu
dents from Russia allows us to form our
own opinions from first-hand accounts,
not from one-sided media portrayals.
Without the support of the Stanford
community in the form of a special fee
request, it would be impossible to con
tinue our exchange, and the student
body would lose a substantial link to life
and events in Russia.
