## Morales qualifies, capping comeback 
### Tish Williams Staff writer 
After failing to make the '88
Olympic swim team as a world
record holder and reigning
Olympic champion and staging a
comeback four years later, Pablo
Morales has finally redeemed
himself. Morales won the finals in
the 100-meter butterfly yesterday
in the Olympic Trials, thus
clinching a spot for himself in this
summer's Olympic games.
"There was a little disbelief there
at first because that was an
extremely tough race," Morales told

the Associated Press. "When I hit
the wall, I looked back. I was ecstat
ic to make the Olympic team."
Morales is a testament to
swimming in a sport whose stars
are getting older and older. Fin
ishing in 54.05 for victory,
Morales will see Olympic competi
tion once more, as he did as a
gold-medalist in the '84 Olympics.
In addition to that, in 1986 he set
the world-record of 52.84 in the
event.

Four years ago, Morales failed
to make the Olympic team after
winning 11 NCAA titles in his col
legiate career. He retired from
swimming to go to law school, but
made the decision last August to
stage a comeback.
"My main fear was to be four or
five months into this comeback,
after putting law school on hold,
and to realize that I really didn't
want to do this," said Morales,
prior to the Olympic Trials.
Morales has been training for
six months to get in shape for Tri
als, held this week in Indianapo
lis, Ind. He had feared that he had
not given himself enough time
after three years off, but in the
final competition proved his
swimming talent and training are
still top notch.
Stanford has a few qualifiers
so far, including Jenny Thompson
who broke the world record on
Sunday. Thompson earned a spot
in the 100 free, after coming into
the meet ranked fourth in the
field in that event.
Summer Sanders won the
finals in the 400 Individual Med
ley to insure herself a trip to
Barcelona. Sanders was the
favorite, leading the competition
as the '90 Goodwill Games gold
medalist and '91 World Champi
onships bronze medalist in that
event. Former Stanford star Janet
Evans came in a surprising third
place, failing to make the team in
the event. Wednesday she will
compete in her strongest events,
the 400- and 800-meter freestyle.
Jill Johnson, another recent
Stanford alumni took second in
the 200 breaststroke, good for a
place on the Olympic team, after
going into the race ranked fourth.
Jeff Rouse, Ray Carey, and
Brian Retterer from Stanford all
are strong competitors for spots
on the men's team. Lea Loveless
has a good chance for the women.
