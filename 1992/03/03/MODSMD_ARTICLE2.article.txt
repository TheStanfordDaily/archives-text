# Reviewing the Presidents
## COP gets mixed reviews Some say constituents were ignored 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
With only three months remaining in
their term, members of the ASSU
Council of Presidents say they have
accomplished many of their goals this
year — despite the distraction of the
University's budget crisis.
But many who have worked with the
COP throughout the past year say the
slate has been negligent in dealing with
such issues as the tuition hike, multi
culturalism and the proposed change in
the burden of proof for student judicial
cases.
Junior Beth Morgan said the COP
had planned to spend much of its time
addressing traditional campus concerns
but ended up concentrating largely on
the issue raised by Stanford's recent
budget troubles.
Budget, tuition main concerns
The COP's main project this year,
according to member John Overdeck,
was increasing student representation
in the budget process.
The administration originally planned
for two students to be involved in budget
committees, but Morgan said the COP
negotiated with the University to increase
that number to about 30 students.
One way the COP stayed involved in
budget issues, Overdeck said, was by

meeting with University administra
tors, including University President
Donald Kennedy.
According to Kennedy, he met with
the COP "every month or two." At those
meetings, Kennedy said, the COP
brought its own agenda of items to dis
cuss, including "a lot of discussion of the
budget cuts."

There's no hurry. The
tortoise wins the race.'

"More recently, we've been dis
cussing tuition," he added. At a meeting
with Kennedy Friday morning, the COP
presented a plan to use an extra 1 per
cent from the endowment each year to
avoid future tuition increases.
While Kennedy said his relationship
with the COP this year has been "cor
dial," he admitted "the tuition increase
has produced some tension."
The COP supported a bill and petition
drive protesting next year's 9.5 percent

with financial aid advocacy.
how to deal with the issues.
Vince Ricci, chair of the Finan
cial Aid Advocacy Office, said his
office's relationship with the COP
was rough at first but has become
more cordial and beneficial.
"They were committed to the
issue of financial aid, but they
were not committed to the FAAO,"
he said. "That's turned around."
Ricci said the COP's main con
tribution to the fight for financial
aid was its opposition to the
increase in tuition.
According to Ricci, the COP's
work on the financial aid issue
has caused the slate to break one
promise, a pledge to limit their
activities to campus. The nature
of the financial aid issue required
the COP to focus on the national
level as well as the local, he said.
"They broke their promise on
that one, but they had to," he said.
Promises kept and broken
COP members kept their main
campaign promise by cutting
their salaries 20 percent — from
$5,000 per member last year to
$4,000 per member this year. And
the slate did obtain funding for
the Sexual Assault Information
and Resource Center.
But promises to install safety
lights and bring a video store to
campus have not been fulfilled.
COP member John Louie, a
senior, said the group investigated
the possibility of installing safety
lights but decided the lights would
be an inefficient use of funds.
Overdeck said the lights would
have cost "hundreds of thou
sands" of dollars.
Snyder said one promise he felt
the COP had not kept was a
pledge to be fully accountable to

tuition hike, approved by the
Board of Trustees Feb. 11.
Although the administration
has not yet acted on the plan,
Overdeck said he doesn't feel
immediate action on the increase
is crucial.
"There's no hurry," he said.
"The tortoise wins the race."
Morgan admitted, however,
that opposition to next year's
tuition hike has "lost a lot of
momentum" over the past two
weeks.
People's Platform Senator
Russell Calleros agreed that
"some momentum was lost by not
acting right away" in response to
the tuition hike. Calleros said he
would have liked to see the COP
act on the increase as soon as they
found out about it.
Overall, however, Calleros said
he thinks COP members "have
really been accountable and open
to student input."
'Leadership' needed
But Jason Snyder, an under
graduate senator who ran as an
independent in last year's elec
tion, said the COP has not fought
fiercely enough for the students in
their dealings with the University.
"There was even more of a need
for leadership in the tough times
than normally," he said. "That
hasn't been entirely visible."
Snyder said he would have
liked the COP to both participate
in more discussion on the budget
and tuition issues and put for
ward more concrete proposals on

students. "While the COP worked
hard and long on some issues, I
don't think they lived up to their
name — Students First," he said.
Snyder said he also felt the COP
was "embroiled in party politics"
during debate over certain issues.
Questions on Proof proposal
One example of the COP siding
with one party against another,
Snyder said, was the slate's oppo
sition to the Committee of 15 pro
posal to change the standard of
proof in University judicial cases
from a "beyond a reasonable
doubt" standard to one requiring
"clear and convincing evidence."
Another undergraduate senator
who said the COP mishandled the
proof proposal is senior Raphe
Beck. Beck, who ran with the Ham
mer and Coffin party, said overall
the COP had done "a terrific job."
"They have stayed true to most
of their promises," Beck said,
"but there's one implicit promise
they haven't lived up to."
Beck said an unspoken agree
ment exists between COP mem
bers and students promising that
men and women on the COP will
be "accountable to their different
groups on campus."
However, Beck said he did not
feel COP members lived up to
that requirement when consider
ing the change in standards of
proof earlier in the year.
The Women's Center support-

Ed the recommendation, Beck
said, but the COP vigorously
opposed it. Beck said the COP did
not contact the Women's Center
about the issue, and so had bro
ken their implicit promise to the
students.
Morgan confirmed that the
COP had no meetings with the
Women's Center about the proof
recommendation but said they
had discussed the proposal with
Susan Epstein, coordinator for
the Sexual Assault Information
and Resources Center.
Diversity efforts discussed
According to junior Benny San
doval, the fourth COP member, the
group has made good on its pledge
to work for diversity on campus.
Sandoval said the COP fought
to preserve campus ethnic centers
from having their budgets
reduced in the second round of
University budget cuts.
Calleros, however, said the
COP has not made a great
attempt to work for diversity on
campus.
"They said they were commit
ted to fostering multicultural
ism," he said. "As far as concrete
action concerning that, I haven't
seen any."
Sandoval said the COP had
also scheduled an ethnic commu
nity celebration for early April
but has cancelled the celebration
due to lack of student interest.

in the budget process.
The administration originally planned
for two students to be involved in budget
committees, but Morgan said the COP
negotiated with the University to increase
that number to about 30 students.
One way the COP stayed involved in
budget issues, Overdeck said, was by

meeting with University administra
tors, including University President
Donald Kennedy.
According to Kennedy, he met with
the COP "every month or two." At those
meetings, Kennedy said, the COP
brought its own agenda of items to dis
cuss, including "a lot of discussion of the
budget cuts."

"More recently, we've been dis
cussing tuition," he added. At a meeting
with Kennedy Friday morning, the COP
presented a plan to use an extra 1 per
cent from the endowment each year to
avoid future tuition increases.
While Kennedy said his relationship
with the COP this year has been "cor
dial," he admitted "the tuition increase
has produced some tension."

how to deal with the issues.
Vince Ricci, chair of the Finan
cial Aid Advocacy Office, said his
office's relationship with the COP
was rough at first but has become
more cordial and beneficial.
"They were committed to the
issue of financial aid, but they
were not committed to the FAAO,"
he said. "That's turned around."
Ricci said the COP's main con
tribution to the fight for financial
aid was its opposition to the
increase in tuition.
According to Ricci, the COP's
work on the financial aid issue
has caused the slate to break one
promise, a pledge to limit their
activities to campus. The nature
of the financial aid issue required
the COP to focus on the national
level as well as the local, he said.
"They broke their promise on
that one, but they had to," he said.
Promises kept and broken
COP members kept their main
campaign promise by cutting
their salaries 20 percent — from
$5,000 per member last year to
$4,000 per member this year. And
the slate did obtain funding for
the Sexual Assault Information
and Resource Center.
But promises to install safety
lights and bring a video store to
campus have not been fulfilled.
COP member John Louie, a
senior, said the group investigated
the possibility of installing safety
lights but decided the lights would
be an inefficient use of funds.
Overdeck said the lights would
have cost "hundreds of thou
sands" of dollars.
Snyder said one promise he felt
the COP had not kept was a
pledge to be fully accountable to

tuition hike, approved by the
Board of Trustees Feb. 11.
Although the administration
has not yet acted on the plan,
Overdeck said he doesn't feel
immediate action on the increase
is crucial.
"There's no hurry," he said.
"The tortoise wins the race."
Morgan admitted, however,
that opposition to next year's
tuition hike has "lost a lot of
momentum" over the past two
weeks.
People's Platform Senator
Russell Calleros agreed that
"some momentum was lost by not
acting right away" in response to
the tuition hike. Calleros said he
would have liked to see the COP
act on the increase as soon as they
found out about it.
Overall, however, Calleros said
he thinks COP members "have
really been accountable and open
to student input."
'Leadership' needed
But Jason Snyder, an under
graduate senator who ran as an
independent in last year's elec
tion, said the COP has not fought
fiercely enough for the students in
their dealings with the University.
"There was even more of a need
for leadership in the tough times
than normally," he said. "That
hasn't been entirely visible."
Snyder said he would have

students. "While the COP worked
hard and long on some issues, I
don't think they lived up to their
name — Students First," he said.
Snyder said he also felt the COP
was "embroiled in party politics"
during debate over certain issues.
Questions on Proof proposal
One example of the COP siding
with one party against another,
Snyder said, was the slate's oppo
sition to the Committee of 15 pro
posal to change the standard of
proof in University judicial cases
from a "beyond a reasonable
doubt" standard to one requiring
"clear and convincing evidence."
Another undergraduate senator
who said the COP mishandled the
proof proposal is senior Raphe
Beck. Beck, who ran with the Ham
mer and Coffin party, said overall
the COP had done "a terrific job."
"They have stayed true to most
of their promises," Beck said,
"but there's one implicit promise
they haven't lived up to."
Beck said an unspoken agree
ment exists between COP mem
bers and students promising that
men and women on the COP will
be "accountable to their different
groups on campus."
However, Beck said he did not
feel COP members lived up to
that requirement when consider
ing the change in standards of
proof earlier in the year.
The Women's Center support-

Ed the recommendation, Beck
said, but the COP vigorously
opposed it. Beck said the COP did
not contact the Women's Center
about the issue, and so had bro
ken their implicit promise to the
students.
Morgan confirmed that the
COP had no meetings with the
Women's Center about the proof
recommendation but said they
had discussed the proposal with
Susan Epstein, coordinator for
the Sexual Assault Information
and Resources Center.
Diversity efforts discussed
According to junior Benny San
doval, the fourth COP member, the
group has made good on its pledge
to work for diversity on campus.
Sandoval said the COP fought
to preserve campus ethnic centers
from having their budgets
reduced in the second round of
University budget cuts.
Calleros, however, said the
COP has not made a great
attempt to work for diversity on
campus.
"They said they were commit
ted to fostering multicultural
ism," he said. "As far as concrete
action concerning that, I haven't
seen any."
Sandoval said the COP had
also scheduled an ethnic commu
nity celebration for early April
but has cancelled the celebration
due to lack of student interest.
With only three months remaining in
their term, members of the ASSU
Council of Presidents say they have
accomplished many of their goals this
year — despite the distraction of the
University's budget crisis.
But many who have worked with the
COP throughout the past year say the
slate has been negligent in dealing with
such issues as the tuition hike, multi
culturalism and the proposed change in
the burden of proof for student judicial
cases.
Junior Beth Morgan said the COP
had planned to spend much of its time
addressing traditional campus concerns
but ended up concentrating largely on
the issue raised by Stanford's recent
budget troubles.
