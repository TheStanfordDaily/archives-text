# Reviewing the Presidents
## COP gets mixed reviews Some say constituents were ignored 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
With only three months remaining in
their term, members of the ASSU
Council of Presidents say they have
accomplished many of their goals this
year — despite the distraction of the
University's budget crisis.
But many who have worked with the
COP throughout the past year say the
slate has been negligent in dealing with
such issues as the tuition hike, multi
culturalism and the proposed change in
the burden of proof for student judicial
cases.
Junior Beth Morgan said the COP
had planned to spend much of its time
addressing traditional campus concerns
but ended up concentrating largely on
the issue raised by Stanford's recent
budget troubles.
Budget, tuition main concerns
The COP's main project this year,
according to member John Overdeck,
was increasing student representation
in the budget process.
The administration originally planned
for two students to be involved in budget
committees, but Morgan said the COP
negotiated with the University to increase
that number to about 30 students.
One way the COP stayed involved in
budget issues, Overdeck said, was by

meeting with University administra
tors, including University President
Donald Kennedy.
According to Kennedy, he met with
the COP "every month or two." At those
meetings, Kennedy said, the COP
brought its own agenda of items to dis
cuss, including "a lot of discussion of the
budget cuts."

There's no hurry. The
tortoise wins the race.'

"More recently, we've been dis
cussing tuition," he added. At a meeting
with Kennedy Friday morning, the COP
presented a plan to use an extra 1 per
cent from the endowment each year to
avoid future tuition increases.
While Kennedy said his relationship
with the COP this year has been "cor
dial," he admitted "the tuition increase
has produced some tension."

cized by some. "It just has to do with accountability," undergraduate
senator Jason Snyder said. "I don't think they lived up to their name
— Students First." Others, however, praise the COP for their work
with financial aid advocacy.
