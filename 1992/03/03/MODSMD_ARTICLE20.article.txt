### Peter Marks Staff writer 
For the second weekend in a
row, the Stanford men's gymnas
tics team spoiled San Jose State's
Saturday night. This time, Stan
ford humiliated the Spartans in
front of their home crowd.
The Cardinal posted a team
score of 280.65, a total that
seemed all the more impressive
considering Stanford's sloppy
performance and the absence of
Josh Stein and Jason Cohen. The
Spartans scored only 255 points,
a devastating loss for most teams
but an improvement from last
week's total of 225 points.
Stanford had problems of its
own. Several of the Cardinal's gym
nasts failed to hit their routines
successfully, including the dynamic
duo of Jair Lynch and Tim Ryan.
Lynch fell off the high bar twice
and scored only an 8.65 out of 10.
The junior redeemed himself with a
near-perfect 9.9 on the pommel
horse, and a team-leading perfor
mance in the floor exercise. Like

Lynch, Ryan's routines were some
what sluggish, according to Hama
da. Nonetheless, an outstanding 9.8
performance on the rings propelled
Ryan to victory in the all-around
competition with a score of 56.90.
Lynch and Ryan tied for first in
the parallel bars with a 9.55. Mark
Booth won the high bar competi
tion with a 9.5 and ranked first on
the pommel horse with a 9.75.
Hamada said that by the NCAA
Championships, Ryan and Lynch
should earn scores of 58 points.
The two potential Olympians, as
well as Chris Sey, competed in all
six individual events for the first
time in several tournaments.
Before turning the three loose
against San Jose State, Hamada
had allowed other gymnasts a
chance to improve their skills in
those earlier competitions.
Having dispatched with patsies
like the Spartans, Stanford now
faces tough competition for the
rest of the season, including a
match-up with top-5 ranked
Brigham Young University at the
UCSB Invitational on Friday.
