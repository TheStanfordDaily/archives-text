# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Cardinal athletes proved themselves to be
among the best in the nation this weekend.
From the bright spotlight of the Olympic tri
als to Pacific 10 Conference tournaments in
Eugene, Ore., Stanford students did them
selves and their school proud.
Both selections for Athletes of the Week led
their respective teams with outstanding perfor
mances. While the differences between the two
athletes and their respective marks might seem

more obvious than the similarities, one thing
stands out about each: both distinguished
themselves in their field in high-pressure situa
tions. For that Jenny Thompson and Mark
Graham are this week's Athletes of the Week.
Freshman Jenny Thompson made a legit
imate claim for Athlete of the Year on the
basis of two short deeds on Sunday. In fact it
was the shortness of the performances that
is of note. Thompson established a world
record in the 100-meter freestyle at the
Olympic trials in the fifth preliminary heat
Sunday morning, posting 54.48 mark which
was a full .25 seconds better than the old
record of 54.73 held by Kristin Otto of East
Germany. The time had stood since 1986.
Thompson is the first American in 59 years
to hold the record in the 100 freestyle. Her
previous best had been a 55.84.
As if that weren't enough, she put the
icing on the cake later that same day as she
swam the second-best time ever posted, a
54.63, to take first-place in the event and
win a spot on the 1992 Summer Olympic
which will compete in Barcelona.

Senior Mark Graham didn't set any
world-records, but he had the best finish of
any Stanford wrestler this weekend at the
Pac-lOs. Graham was the No. 2 seed at the
tournament in the 190-pound weight class
and only lost once, to eventual champion
Jeff Monson in sudden-death overtime.
Graham distinguished himself by over
powering Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo's Aaron

Cantrell 12-3 and then upsetting the No. 1
seed, Jassen Froehlich 6-1 on the way to an
eventual third-place finish and an automatic
invitation to the NCAA Tournament in
Oklahoma City, Okla., March 19-21. Gra
ham's performance was the best Cardinal
placing at the tournament.
He, along with teammates Lance John
son, Mark Topham, and possibly Jay Jack
son will represent Stanford and will compete
for Ail-American status.
