# Spikers down Matadors in four
## 
### Ed Donovan 
The Stanford men's volleyball team was too
tough a bull for the Cal State-Northridge Matadors
last night, winning in four games in Burnham
Pavilion.
In the first game, the Matadors jumped out to a
5-2 lead behind a pair of service aces from senior
Mike Mesnik. But Stanford stormed back behind
the hitting of Dave Goss and the southpaw serve of
Ryan Moos to win the game in a rout, 15-8.
Northridge was first out of the blocks again in the
second and third games as well, scoring the first three
and four points respectively. Although Stanford
briefly led in game two, 10-9, Cal State closed out the
game by capitalizing on several missed serves.
"They had such a good game plan," remarked
coach Ruben Nieves on the Matadors' strategy.
According to Nieves, CS-Northridge repeatedly
served at senior Duncan Blackman, rattling him
into an uncharacteristically low 12 kills and .258
hitting percentage.
In game three, with CS-Northridge leading 4-0,
Nieves recognized that Blackman had been shaken
and removed him in favor of Bob Hillman. Hillman
responded with the performance of the night.
"When I came in, both sides were a little flat," he
explained. "Mainly, I was just trying to do a lot of
talking to the other players, trying to be a spark
plug. I take that role pretty seriously".
No kidding. Hillman ignited the Cardinal comeback
with great hitting, several key blocks, and an ace. He
finished with 11 kills in only a game and a half.
"Bob was the key man tonight," Nieves said. "He
gives the team an emotional lift, adding spirit when
we need it"
If there was one thing not lacking from the Car
dinal effort, it was spirit. In addition to Hillman's
sparks, freshman Canyon Ceman inspired his team
mates and the crowd with a celebratory dance that
would be penalized in the N.F.L.
When it came down to the crucial fourth game,
however, Dave Goss carried the team in customary
fashion. He finished the match with forty-one kills
and a .565 hitting percentage.
"Dave had a really good hitting night," according
to Nieves. "He hit tonight the way he did when he
broke the NCAA kill record(ss kills) against
UCLA".
The match finished with the Cardinal victorious
in four games, 15-8, 11-15, 15-9, 15-9. With this
win, Stanford solidifies its #2 national ranking and,
more importantly, remains just one game behind
top-ranked Long Beach State in the division. The
Cardinal want to stay close in anticipation of the
upcoming showdown at home on April 4.
