Baseball:
The No. 4 Stanford base
ball team takes on UC-Davis
today at 2 p.m. at the Sunken
Diamond in a non-confer
ence matchup. Although the
Cardinal nine is expected to
overrun the Mustangs, UC-
Davis pulled an upset last
year at Davis to win 8-7.
The Stanford batsmen are
looking to avenge that loss
with their continued strong
hitting. While the Cardinal
bats were silent during the
first few games of the season,
they have come on strong as
the team has been preparing
for conference play.
Stanford piled up a sea
son-high 21 hits during last
Saturday's contest while
pummeling the Arizona State
Wildcats 18-5 in Tempe. The
Cardinal took two out of
three from the 'Cats.
Stanford returns to Six-
Pac conference play Friday as
the team hosts archrival USC
for a weekend series.
