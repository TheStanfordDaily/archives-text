# Hoops reaching for NCAA berth

At top-ranked Duke they're talk
ing repeat, but mention title
defense in the Stanford locker room
and you may catch a stray elbow.
Stanford is the defending
National Invitation Tournament
champion, but NIT talk is taboo.
Although the Cardinal (16-8, 8-6
in the Pacific 10 Conference) has
guaranteed itself an NIT invita
tion, the team couldn't care less.
No offense to the fine folks at
the NIT, but with three visits in
the past four years, Stanford isn't
too excited about going back.
"That's not what we're con
cerned with right now," said
coach Mike Montgomery.
Believing that fourth place in
the Pac-10 will get it into the NCAA
Tournament, the men's basketball
team is in a four-game sprint to the
finish. With a win Thursday (6:30
p.m., KZSU 90.1 FM) at fifth-place
Arizona State, the Cardinal can
secure fourth, eliminate any NIT
rumors and make reservations for
March Madness. Realistically,

Stanford needs just two more wins
to finish fourth, but a victory over
the Sun Devils (16-11, 7-7) would
end the drama early.
"We need a minimum of 10
wins, but 11 would really solidify
things," Montgomery said.
Speculation about how many
Pac-10 teams will make the NCAA
Tournament is of course, educated
guessing. With USC, UCLA and
Arizona in the top 15, the Pac-10
hasn't weakened, but will be hard
pressed to get five teams into the
Tournament as CBS has predicted.
Montgomery feels Stanford must
finish fourth to have a chance.
Stanford embarks on its final
Pac-10 roadtrip with a scheduling
advantage on the competition.
Fifth-place Arizona State finishes
on the road at No. 4 UCLA and No.
13 USC, while sixth-place Wash
ington State (7-8) must sweep the
Southern California schools when
they travel to Pullman. By winning
Thursday at ASU, Stanford won't
need to count on those losses.
"They both (WSU, ASU) have
to play USC and UCLA and that
should figure in there somewhere.

They'll have a tough time winning,
but that's their concern now, not
mine," Montgomery said. "Those
teams cost us four losses."
Meanwhile Stanford will return
home to face last-place Oregon and
an overachieving Oregon State
team weakened by team defections.
Although Stanford is 0-6 against
teams in the top 15, the Cardinal
has beaten the teams it should beat
and has been blown out only once
all year, at UCLA. Beyond the six
losses to ranked teams, Stanford
lost at NCAA-hopeful Notre Dame
and at Washington State, a proba
ble 20-game winner.
Two more wins would give
Stanford an 18-10 record, still
two short of the magical 20-win
mark. But since Stanford plays
only 28 games, there is nothing
magical about 20. The last time
Stanford made the Tournament it
played 32 regular season games.
The Cardinal would like to
have the last two minutes back
against USC and Arizona, but
should get another chance at
giant-killing in the NCAA Tour
nament.
