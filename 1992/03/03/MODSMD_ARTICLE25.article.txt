# Frustrated softballers struggle over weekend
## 
### David Hyatt 
This first year of varsity play
for Stanford softball was expected
to be tough, and so far those expec
tations have been fulfilled. The
young Cardinal endured a week
end of frustrating results, drop
ping doubleheaders to Santa Clara
and Chico State, but the team
showed encouraging improvement
in the field and on the mound.
Saturday's games against
Santa Clara were close affairs,
with the Broncos prevailing 2-0
and 4-2.
In game one, sophomore pitch
er Linda Shpegel confounded
opposing hitters, allowing just one
unearned run in seven innings of
relief. Specializing in control and
off-speed deliveries, Shpegel
struck out a career-high seven.
In game two, Stanford's hit
ters started to connect against
Santa Clara pitching. Freshman
Stanford pitcher Karla Starr kept
the Cardinal within striking dis
tance, but her teammates had
trouble moving runners around
the bases, stranding eight.
In Saturday's games, Stanford's
defense, which had been commit
ting over five errors a game, proved
much stingier. The infield nailed

several napping Bronco base run
ners, and also turned some nifty
double plays.
Catching, previously a liability,
showed dramatic progress this
weekend, with sophomore Alice
Acemyan commanding authority
behind the plate.
Sunday's games against a more
talented Chico State team were
not as close (8-2 and 4-0), but they
showed that the Cardinal can
hang tough against more
formidable opponents than weak
hitting Santa Clara. Defense again
proved strong, improving in the
second game to yield just one
harmless error. But while fielding
is keeping Stanford competitive,
defense alone can't win games. A
consistently aggressive hitting
attack will simply take more time
to develop.
Unfortunately, just as Stan
ford is beginning to make noise
against moderately skilled teams,
the Cardinal now faces two
nationally ranked opponents.
The team plays doubleheaders
against San Jose State at Muni
Stadium Wednesday night at 6,
and hosts Oregon Saturday at 2
p.m. at Stanford's new "home
away from home," Santa Clara's
Lafayette Park.
