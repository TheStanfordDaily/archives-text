# Have directors spied SLAC's awful truth?
## SLAC horror flick in the works 
### Marie Save de Beaurecueil Staff writer 
Inspired by a video production
class they took together last quar
ter, three students have written
and are casting parts for a movie
called "It Came From SLAC."
But Burton Richter, director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, said their script depicts
events that could never happen.
The 30-minute spoof is a come
dy-horror starring a female stu
dent who is mutated by exposure
to radiation at SLAC. She goes on
to become what junior Eric
Manchester, one of the film's pro
ducers, describes as a "mutant
psychokiller," murdering several
other Stanford students.
But Richter said it would be
"impossible for anyone to get radia
tion exposure here." Three separate
levels of locked doors, he said, "pro

tect all visitors from exposure."
Even if a freak accident were to
occur and someone were to be
exposed to radiation, Richter con
tinued, they would not be mutated.
"Radiation exposure will kill cells
resulting in the loss of hair and
bone marrow," he said. "You don't
get mutated — your offspring will."
He did admit that some psycho
logical damage could occur through
radiation exposure if brain cells
were killed. However, he said
SLAC has no records of anyone
ever being exposed to more than
the accepted level of radiation, nor
of anyone becoming psychotic as a
result of radiation exposure.
Richter said he found the
movie idea "funny," but suggest
ed that the producers sign up for a
tour of SLAC "so they can find
out how it works."
Manchester and seniors Chris
McKenna and lan Brown are cur

rently advertising for actors,
actresses and crew members.
"We decided to do our own pro
ject because there are not many
opportunities or outlets for film
making here," Manchester said.
"We thought a comedy-horror
movie would push the (technical)
limitations of the equipment, and
... would be very entertaining,"
he added. "It will afford the
opportunity for technical set-ups
and camera work."
The movie will use top-of-the
line, Hi-8 video equipment,
McKenna said.
"It's a campy, tongue-in-cheek
spoof on a horror movie," Manch
ester said. "It makes fun of just
about everything you can think of.
This movie is a friend to no one."
It "is definitely not going to be
rated 'PC,'" he added.
Although the movie does have
a "Stanford bent," Manchester
said the producers want to give it
universal appeal so that it "could
be seen and enjoyed by anybody

'You don't get
mutated — your
offspring will.'
— Burton Richter

from anywhere."
The producers hope to have a
campus showing of the completed
movie at the end of spring quarter,
Manchester said. "We want to give
this as much exposure as we can at
Stanford and create enough
awareness that maybe we could
have a few more screenings."
But Manchester said, "We're
not in this for the money. This is
for our own amusement, and for a
unique learning experience."
The producers expect to spend
about seven hours a day during
the spring to produce the movie.
"We hope this will be a big movie,"
Manchester said.
