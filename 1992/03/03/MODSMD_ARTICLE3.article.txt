# 'It's a very imaginative choice'
## Modern art expert to speak at graduation 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
Stanford alumnus Kirk Varnedoe,
director of the Department of Painting
and Sculpture at New York's Museum of
Modern Art, will be this year's com
mencement speaker, University officials
announced yesterday.
"Varnedoe is an acknowledged intel
lectual leader in defining the role of the
arts in modern American life," Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy said in a
statement.
"Through distinguished scholarship
and a notable creative flair, this Stanford
graduate has helped shape our under
standing of the relationship between art
and popular culture," he said.
Varnedoe, an authority on 19th- and
20th-century European painting and
sculpture, law and visual art, received
his master's and doctorate in art history
from Stanford in 1970 and 1972.
Art Prof. Albert Elsen, Varnedoe's
former adviser, said Varnedoe "has been
responsible for several major provoca
tive art exhibitions at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York. He holds the
single most important position in the
world of modern art."
"It's a very imaginative choice," Elsen
said.
But students who were told of the

choice did not share Elsen's enthusiasm.
"What's he going to tell us?" asked
senior Dave Cornell. "I like the paint
ings [at the museum], but he didn't do
them. All he does is look at them."
Cornell added, "Last year's guy
talked about public service. I guess this
guy will tell us to paint."
John Gardner, Haas Centennial Pro
fessor of Public Service, was last year's
commencement speaker. His selection
drew criticism from seniors last year, who
said he lacked instant name recognition.
Seniors made similar comments yes
terday about Varnedoe.
"He may be an excellent speaker, but
I wouldn't call him a widely known
luminary or anything of that sort," said
senior John Pilafidis.
The selection of a speaker involved in
the arts comes during a year of contro
versy over deep budget cuts in Stanford's
art, drama and music departments.
"It's an appropriate time for Stanford
to recognize the importance of the arts,
and we're lucky to have a Stanford grad
uate of Varnedoe's stature to help us,"
Kennedy said yesterday.
Art Department Chair Wanda Corn
said Varnedoe's selection is "terrific for
the arts."
"I guess the University is trying to
tell us they're not going to let us down
after all," she added.

Elsen speculated that Varnedoe will
speak on the role of arts in society and at
Stanford, and may also discuss the
recent controversy surrounding the
National Endowment for the Arts.
Varnedoe "has a very strong commit
ment to Stanford," Elsen said. "This
year, he wrote letters on behalf of the
photography program when it was
under scrutiny" in the budget process,
Elsen said.
