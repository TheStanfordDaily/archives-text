# 'It's a very imaginative choice'
## Modern art expert to speak at graduation 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
Stanford alumnus Kirk Varnedoe,
director of the Department of Painting
and Sculpture at New York's Museum of
Modern Art, will be this year's com
mencement speaker, University officials
announced yesterday.
"Varnedoe is an acknowledged intel
lectual leader in defining the role of the
arts in modern American life," Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy said in a
statement.
"Through distinguished scholarship
and a notable creative flair, this Stanford
graduate has helped shape our under
standing of the relationship between art
and popular culture," he said.
Varnedoe, an authority on 19th- and
20th-century European painting and
sculpture, law and visual art, received
his master's and doctorate in art history
from Stanford in 1970 and 1972.
Art Prof. Albert Elsen, Varnedoe's
former adviser, said Varnedoe "has been
responsible for several major provoca
tive art exhibitions at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York. He holds the
single most important position in the
world of modern art."
"It's a very imaginative choice," Elsen
said.
But students who were told of the

choice did not share Elsen's enthusiasm.
"What's he going to tell us?" asked
senior Dave Cornell. "I like the paint
ings [at the museum], but he didn't do
them. All he does is look at them."
Cornell added, "Last year's guy
talked about public service. I guess this
guy will tell us to paint."
John Gardner, Haas Centennial Pro
fessor of Public Service, was last year's
commencement speaker. His selection
drew criticism from seniors last year, who
said he lacked instant name recognition.
Seniors made similar comments yes
terday about Varnedoe.
"He may be an excellent speaker, but
I wouldn't call him a widely known
luminary or anything of that sort," said
senior John Pilafidis.
The selection of a speaker involved in
the arts comes during a year of contro
versy over deep budget cuts in Stanford's
art, drama and music departments.
"It's an appropriate time for Stanford
to recognize the importance of the arts,
and we're lucky to have a Stanford grad
uate of Varnedoe's stature to help us,"
Kennedy said yesterday.
Art Department Chair Wanda Corn
said Varnedoe's selection is "terrific for
the arts."
"I guess the University is trying to
tell us they're not going to let us down
after all," she added.

Elsen speculated that Varnedoe will
speak on the role of arts in society and at
Stanford, and may also discuss the
recent controversy surrounding the
National Endowment for the Arts.
Varnedoe "has a very strong commit
ment to Stanford," Elsen said. "This
year, he wrote letters on behalf of the
photography program when it was
under scrutiny" in the budget process,
Elsen said.

A committee of students, sev
eral senior class presidents, pro
fessors and administrators nomi
nates commencement speakers
each year. The speaker is then
selected by Kennedy.
This year the committee sub
mitted to Kennedy an unranked
list of candidates, according to
Bob Hamrdla, assistant to the
president.
Varnedoe served as an assis
tant professor of art history at
Stanford in 1973-74 and later
taught at Columbia University
and at New York University's
Institute of Fine Arts.
After organizing the exhibit
"Primitivism in 20th-century
Art: Affinity of the Tribal and
the Modern" for the Museum of
Modern Art in 1984, Varnedoe
was appointed adjunct curator
of the museum in 1986 and
became director of the Depart
ment of Painting and Sculpture
in 1988.
As director, he has developed
an exhibit series called "Artist's
Choice," in which artists select
and install temporary exhibitions
of works from the museum's vast
collection of painting and sculp

tures. In addition to his work at
the museum, Varnedoe organizes
exhibitions for other institutions
nationwide.
He is als6 the author of several
books, including "A Fine Disre
gard: What Makes Modern Art
Modern," and "Northern Light:
Nordic Painting at the Turn of
the Century."
Varnedoe was decorated by the
King of Norway for his work with
Scandinavian art, Elsen said.
Varnedoe, who is also interest
ed in the history of photography,
was recently awarded a visiting
professorship in Art History at
Oxford University.
While at Stanford, Varnedoe
was a member of several organiza
tions, including a non-violent stu
dent group that put itself between
police and violent protesters,
Elsen recalled. Varnedoe also
played rugby.
Commencement is scheduled
for Sunday, June 14.
Over the past decade, com
mencement speakers have
included "Nightline" host Ted
Koppel, New York Gov. Marie
Cuomo, retired Speaker of the
House of Representatives Tip
O'Neill, Oakland Tribune editor
Robert Maynard, "Doonesbury"
cartoon creator Garry Trudeau,
and Children's Defense Fund
founder Marion Wright Edelman.
