# In the wake of cuts Popular lecturer won't get new contract

A budget-cutting decision to eliminate a
popular American Studies lecturer's job
has raised questions about the program's
future, with many students and professors
saying its quality will be severely damaged.
Acting Assoc. Prof. Richard Gillam, a
senior lecturer who acts as coordinator for the
program, learned recently that he will not be
rehired after six years, effective June 21.
Faculty and students described Gillam as
the core of American Studies, saying his ter
mination threatens the program's success.
"American Studies needs him," said
English Prof. George Dekker, who teaches
in American Studies. "He is clearly partly
responsible for the large number of majors
in the program."
Interdisciplinary programs in the School
of Humanities and Sciences — such as
American Studies, Feminist Studies and
Human Biology — must cut $600,000 from
their budgets.
The budget-reduction plan for American
Studies includes replacing "the teaching of
a full-time lecturer" by shifting responsibil
ity for teaching core courses to the History
and English departments, according to a
School of Humanities and Science memo
distributed to faculty in January.
Gillam currently teaches "The American
Character," the core seminar taken by all
majors. Other teaching in the program is
done mainly by History and English faculty.
According to the memo, school officials
agree with the report of the Faculty Senate's
Committee on Education and Scholarship at
Stanford. The committee's report said: "A
strong interdisplinary meyor or honors pro
gram should have faculty at the center of its

program — for example, in
running core seminars."
It continued, "In the
long run, substantial use
of non-academic council
instructors at the intellec
tual core of an interdis
plinary major or honors
program is not acceptable
at Stanford; for we aim in
our majors and honors pro-

grams at bringing the best undergraduates
together with world-class scholars and
researchers."
But Assoc. English Prof. Jay Fliegelman,
chair of American Studies, said the princi
ple that lecturers cannot teach as effective
ly as faculty will ultimately harm American
Studies.
"There is a need symbolically to have
someone there in Building 70 who repre
sents American Studies," Fliegelman said.
"This is seen as a luxury that is no longer
affordable by the administration."
The school's memo said that shifting to
faculty teaching would "net savings in pro
grams" like American Studies, in which core
courses are primarily taught by lecturers.
"This is a policy we've not always been
able to adhere to which now we have to
adhere to because of the budget crisis," said
Senior Assoc. Dean Carolyn Lougee.
Thomas said there will not be another
continuing appointment within the program.
But he said he expects that faculty will
want to teach most of the courses now being
offered. "There are a lot of faculty with
interest in American Studies," he said. "If
there's a vacuum, it will be filled very early."
