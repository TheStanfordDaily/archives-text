# In the wake of cuts Popular lecturer won't get new contract
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
A budget-cutting decision to eliminate a
popular American Studies lecturer's job
has raised questions about the program's
future, with many students and professors
saying its quality will be severely damaged.
Acting Assoc. Prof. Richard Gillam, a
senior lecturer who acts as coordinator for the
program, learned recently that he will not be
rehired after six years, effective June 21.
Faculty and students described Gillam as
the core of American Studies, saying his ter
mination threatens the program's success.
"American Studies needs him," said
English Prof. George Dekker, who teaches
in American Studies. "He is clearly partly
responsible for the large number of majors
in the program."
Interdisciplinary programs in the School
of Humanities and Sciences — such as
American Studies, Feminist Studies and
Human Biology — must cut $600,000 from
their budgets.
The budget-reduction plan for American
Studies includes replacing "the teaching of
a full-time lecturer" by shifting responsibil
ity for teaching core courses to the History
and English departments, according to a
School of Humanities and Science memo
distributed to faculty in January.
Gillam currently teaches "The American
Character," the core seminar taken by all
majors. Other teaching in the program is
done mainly by History and English faculty.
According to the memo, school officials
agree with the report of the Faculty Senate's
Committee on Education and Scholarship at
Stanford. The committee's report said: "A
strong interdisplinary meyor or honors pro
gram should have faculty at the center of its

program — for example, in
running core seminars."
It continued, "In the
long run, substantial use
of non-academic council
instructors at the intellec
tual core of an interdis
plinary major or honors
program is not acceptable
at Stanford; for we aim in
our majors and honors pro-

grams at bringing the best undergraduates
together with world-class scholars and
researchers."
But Assoc. English Prof. Jay Fliegelman,
chair of American Studies, said the princi
ple that lecturers cannot teach as effective
ly as faculty will ultimately harm American
Studies.
"There is a need symbolically to have
someone there in Building 70 who repre
sents American Studies," Fliegelman said.
"This is seen as a luxury that is no longer
affordable by the administration."
The school's memo said that shifting to
faculty teaching would "net savings in pro
grams" like American Studies, in which core
courses are primarily taught by lecturers.
"This is a policy we've not always been
able to adhere to which now we have to
adhere to because of the budget crisis," said
Senior Assoc. Dean Carolyn Lougee.
Thomas said there will not be another
continuing appointment within the program.
But he said he expects that faculty will
want to teach most of the courses now being
offered. "There are a lot of faculty with
interest in American Studies," he said. "If
there's a vacuum, it will be filled very early."
Assoc. Dean Susan Stephens, who over-


Gillam
sees the American Studies pro
gram, would not comment on the
situation.
Gillam also would not com
ment, saying he did not want to
bias his case.
According to Dekker, Gillam
filed a grievance with Thomas,
but it has been rejected. Gillam's
next step will be to file an appeal
with the provost, Dekker said.
"The general rules are that we
hire on the basis of programmatic
need," Thomas said. Although
Thomas said American Studies is
a strong program meeting its
objectives, he added that part of
being interdisciplinary is remain
ing flexible to meet future needs.
Faculty, students react angrily
Faculty and students in the
program said Gillam's termina
tion could have dangerous ramifi
cations.
Gillam "devised the core semi
nar that has been the course
required for many years," said
History Prof. George Frederick

son, who teaches in the program.
That course, "The American
Character," is "the way of giving a
focus to a rather diffuse major,"
Fredrickson said.
The seminar may be replaced
next year with two seminars that
are cross-listed from the History
and English departments, Fliegel
man said.
The problem with eliminating
non-tenured faculty in programs
like American Studies "is that it is
hard to get the regular faculty to
teach the necessary core courses,"
Fliegelman said.
"American Studies requires
["The American Character"] as a
seminar and we haven't found
enough faculty to teach it,"he said.
Senior Quan Phung said "The
American Character" was the
course that convinced him to
major in American Studies.
"It's difficult for students in an
interdisciplinary program to find
a base," he said. "That course
gives students the basis from
which to find a base."
"It will just be harder to unify
the American Studies program,"
said Thomas Kim, a junior Amer
ican Studies major. "Without
small seminar classes, it will be an

entirely different major and I am
not sure how it will work out."
Another impact of the Gillam's
departure could be less effective
advising for students in the pro
gram, Fredrickson said. "All of
the advising will be done by facul
ty in other departments. There
will be no readily available advice
for students," he added.
Gillam "is invaluable to the
American Studies program,"
Dekker said. "We are making the
necessary adjustments to deal with
his loss, but it will not be easy."
Dekker would exactly not say what
adjustments would be made.
"Gillam is indispensable to the
program. He is the spirit of the
program. He represents the best
of what American Studies has to
offer," said sociology graduate
student David Schmidt, a teach
ing assistant in the Gillam's class.
"I think there is a really danger
ous possibility of [losing] the Amer
ican Studies program," he added.
"He is an outstanding lecturer
and a really dedicated teacher in
terms of being available to stu
dents," said modern thought and
literature graduate student Car
rie Bramen, another of Gillam's
TAs. "He essentially runs the

American Studies program."
American Studies had 90
undergraduate majors at the
beginning of this academic year,
according to registration statis
tics.
A budget-cutting decision to eliminate a
popular American Studies lecturer's job
has raised questions about the program's
future, with many students and professors
saying its quality will be severely damaged.
Acting Assoc. Prof. Richard Gillam, a
senior lecturer who acts as coordinator for the
program, learned recently that he will not be
rehired after six years, effective June 21.
Faculty and students described Gillam as
the core of American Studies, saying his ter
mination threatens the program's success.
"American Studies needs him," said
English Prof. George Dekker, who teaches
in American Studies. "He is clearly partly
responsible for the large number of majors
in the program."
Interdisciplinary programs in the School
of Humanities and Sciences — such as
American Studies, Feminist Studies and
Human Biology — must cut $600,000 from
their budgets.
The budget-reduction plan for American
Studies includes replacing "the teaching of
a full-time lecturer" by shifting responsibil
ity for teaching core courses to the History
and English departments, according to a
School of Humanities and Science memo
distributed to faculty in January.
Gillam currently teaches "The American
Character," the core seminar taken by all
majors. Other teaching in the program is
done mainly by History and English faculty.
According to the memo, school officials
agree with the report of the Faculty Senate's
Committee on Education and Scholarship at
Stanford. The committee's report said: "A
strong interdisplinary meyor or honors pro
gram should have faculty at the center of its

program — for example, in
running core seminars."
It continued, "In the
long run, substantial use
of non-academic council
instructors at the intellec
tual core of an interdis
plinary major or honors
program is not acceptable
at Stanford; for we aim in
our majors and honors pro-

grams at bringing the best undergraduates
together with world-class scholars and
researchers."
But Assoc. English Prof. Jay Fliegelman,
chair of American Studies, said the princi
ple that lecturers cannot teach as effective
ly as faculty will ultimately harm American
Studies.
"There is a need symbolically to have
someone there in Building 70 who repre
sents American Studies," Fliegelman said.
"This is seen as a luxury that is no longer
affordable by the administration."
The school's memo said that shifting to
faculty teaching would "net savings in pro
grams" like American Studies, in which core
courses are primarily taught by lecturers.
"This is a policy we've not always been
able to adhere to which now we have to
adhere to because of the budget crisis," said
Senior Assoc. Dean Carolyn Lougee.
Thomas said there will not be another
continuing appointment within the program.
But he said he expects that faculty will
want to teach most of the courses now being
offered. "There are a lot of faculty with
interest in American Studies," he said. "If
there's a vacuum, it will be filled very early."
Assoc. Dean Susan Stephens, who over-


Gillam
sees the American Studies pro
gram, would not comment on the
situation.
Gillam also would not com
ment, saying he did not want to
bias his case.
According to Dekker, Gillam
filed a grievance with Thomas,
but it has been rejected. Gillam's
next step will be to file an appeal
with the provost, Dekker said.
"The general rules are that we
hire on the basis of programmatic
need," Thomas said. Although
Thomas said American Studies is
a strong program meeting its
objectives, he added that part of
being interdisciplinary is remain
ing flexible to meet future needs.
Faculty, students react angrily
Faculty and students in the
program said Gillam's termina
tion could have dangerous ramifi
cations.
Gillam "devised the core semi
nar that has been the course
required for many years," said
History Prof. George Frederick

son, who teaches in the program.
That course, "The American
Character," is "the way of giving a
focus to a rather diffuse major,"
Fredrickson said.
The seminar may be replaced
next year with two seminars that
are cross-listed from the History
and English departments, Fliegel
man said.
The problem with eliminating
non-tenured faculty in programs
like American Studies "is that it is
hard to get the regular faculty to
teach the necessary core courses,"
Fliegelman said.
"American Studies requires
["The American Character"] as a
seminar and we haven't found
enough faculty to teach it,"he said.
Senior Quan Phung said "The
American Character" was the
course that convinced him to
major in American Studies.
"It's difficult for students in an
interdisciplinary program to find
a base," he said. "That course
gives students the basis from
which to find a base."
"It will just be harder to unify
the American Studies program,"
said Thomas Kim, a junior Amer
ican Studies major. "Without
small seminar classes, it will be an

entirely different major and I am
not sure how it will work out."
Another impact of the Gillam's
departure could be less effective
advising for students in the pro
gram, Fredrickson said. "All of
the advising will be done by facul
ty in other departments. There
will be no readily available advice
for students," he added.
Gillam "is invaluable to the
American Studies program,"
Dekker said. "We are making the
necessary adjustments to deal with
his loss, but it will not be easy."
Dekker would exactly not say what
adjustments would be made.
"Gillam is indispensable to the
program. He is the spirit of the
program. He represents the best
of what American Studies has to
offer," said sociology graduate
student David Schmidt, a teach
ing assistant in the Gillam's class.
"I think there is a really danger
ous possibility of [losing] the Amer
ican Studies program," he added.
"He is an outstanding lecturer
and a really dedicated teacher in
terms of being available to stu
dents," said modern thought and
literature graduate student Car
rie Bramen, another of Gillam's
TAs. "He essentially runs the
