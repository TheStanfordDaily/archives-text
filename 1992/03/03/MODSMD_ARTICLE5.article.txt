# No tax break for profs

Stanford faculty and staff
living on campus saw their
hopes for a property-tax
exemption disappear when
the California Supreme
Court ruled against faculty
at UC-Irvine last week.
The Court ruled Thurs
day that university employ
ees living on college property
are not exempt from proper
ty taxes. Stanford had filed a
claim similar to UC-Irvine's
last spring, but last week's
ruling effectively ends the
Stanford appeal.
The ruling overturned an
Orange County Superior
Court decision in a case in
which UC-Irvine faculty
argued for a tax exemption on
the grounds that they live on
educational property.
Land used for educational
purposes is typically exempt
from property taxes.
Stanford, in response to a
request from the Stanford
Campus Residential Lease
holders' Association, filed a
similar claim with Santa
Clara County last spring,
said Sean Flavin, legal consultant
for the group.
The Stanford proposal was
more extensive than UC-Irvine's
in that it also requested refunds
for taxes on physical improve
ments made to the houses, not
just taxes on the land itself.
University Counsel Tom Fen
ner said the University had not
taken a position in the case but
filed the papers on the associa
tion's behalf.
Several of the University's 856
leaseholders subsequently filed
for refunds on property taxes paid
during the last four years.
Some faculty were critical of
the action. Filing for the exemp
tion was "a matter of oppor
tunism and greed," Education
Prof. Henry Levin said.
"I don't think the fact that
people live on campus is some
thing that has educational bene
fit," Levin said.
Property taxes are assessed by
Santa Clara County and support a
variety of services, including the
Palo Alto Unified School District
and police, fire and road services.
All Palo Alto homeowners and
leaseholders must pay property
taxes.
However, Stanford residents'

tax money does not go to Stanford
police, fire or road departments.
Instead, faculty and staff with
houses on campus pay an addi
tional tax for these services based
on the size of their property.
Flavin argues that because
Stanford residents have to double
pay for many of those services,
they are being double-taxed.
A newsletter sent by the home
owners association to faculty last
spring said Stanford residents
pay an additional $150 each
month for those basic services.
But Levin said the overwhelm
ing nuyority of the property taxes
— which are 1 percent of the
assessed value of land and improve
ments and total as much as $7,000
each year — go to support educa
tion and other social services.
A former Palo Alto school
board member, Levin said his
greatest concern about the
exemption was the effect it would
have had on funding for local pub
lic schools.
Levin said that even if the UC-
Irvine case had been upheld, Stan
ford residents were "stretching it"
when they applied for refunds,
because the conditions of their
lease agreements are different.
While the Irvine residents must
agree not to resell their lease for
more than the inflation-adjusted
price they paid for it, Stanford res
idents can make enormous profits
when they sell, he said.
