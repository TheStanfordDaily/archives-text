# For the record
## 
### 
On Feb. 24 and 25, The Daily
mistakenly reported that Neuro
surgery Prof. Gerald Silverberg
had been accused by Neuro
surgery Prof. Frances Conley of
making sexist and demeaning
comments, and fondling. Silver
berg has not been accused of
fondling. The Daily regrets the
error.
