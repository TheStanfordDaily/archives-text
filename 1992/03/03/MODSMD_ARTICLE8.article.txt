Bush approval rating hits new low
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President Bush's approval rating is
down to 40 percent in the latest New York Times-CBS poll, but he
would still beat the major Democratic presidential candidates in a
head-to-head matchup.
Among the Democrats, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton had 28 per
cent support of likely Democratic voters and former Mas
sachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas had 19 percent, said the poll in
today's editions of the Times and reported by CBS Monday night.
Against an unnamed Democrat, Bush was defeated 44-40. But
when stacked against the current crop, Bush won: against Clinton,
50-40; against Tsongas 49-39; and Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey, 52-35.
More than half of the Democrats, 52 percent, said they were
dissatisfied with the candidates running and wish someone else
would ender the race. That was up from 45 percent who felt that
way in a similar poll a few weeks ago.
On the economy, 82 percent said it is either "fairly bad" or
"very bad."
Bush's overall approval rating of 40 percent is accompanied by
a 19 percent approval rating on how well he is handling the econ
omy, the lowest rating in the New York Times-CBS poll for any
president since Jimmy Carter.
Clinton: Tsongas a coal-giver
STONE MOUNTAIN, Ga. (AP) - Bill Clinton tried to turn
Paul Tsongas's campaign metaphor against him yesterday, call
ing him the "Santa Claus" candidate who will give a "lump of
coal" to the middle class instead of a tax cut.
Clinton sharpened his rhetoric against Tsongas the day before
seven primaries and caucuses in which the Arkansas governor
and the former Massachusetts senator are favored.
"In a way, he's the Santa Claus candidate," Clinton said. "He
doesn't even understand the story of Santa Claus. Santa Claus
makes a list, checks it twice, knows who's been naughty and nice
and doesn't give anybody something for nothing.
"The real Santa Claus gives you a lump of coal if you're
naughty," Clinton continued. Tsongas, he said, "gives nothing to
the middle class except more pain and more agony,"
Tsongas has repeatedly said on the campaign trail that he
wasn't "running to be Santa Claus," giving out treats like a mid
dle-class tax cut when he said the economy needed to be repaired
through other means.
During the conversation on the campaign plane, Clinton gave
Tsongas grudging respect for framing the campaign debate on the
economy. But Clinton said Tsongas had done so by misrepresent
ing his and Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey's proposal to cut the mid
dle class tax cut.
