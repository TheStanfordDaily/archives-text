The New
LSAT PREMIUM
PROGRAM:
The Best Way To Prepare For The LSAT
These are the facts. In law school
admissions, the competition is tough: 95,000
applicants, 44,000 slots. Among those that do
get in, most won't be accepted by their first
choice school. A high LSAT score and expert
admissions assistance
can make the difference
for you.
That's why The
Ronkin Educational
Group created the
LSAT Premium
Program, with three
levels of assistance:
OUR LSAT PREP COURSE
Using the most
up-to-date curriculum
available, our 40-hour
course stresses critical
thinking, argument
analysis, and logical
reasoning. It also
includes live tutorials,
three diagnostic exams,
three practice exams, a
computer-based
vocabulary review,
homework materials
including released
LSAT's, and a toll-free
Dial-A-Teacher helpline.
