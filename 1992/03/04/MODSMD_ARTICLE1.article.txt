# Edmonds settles into her new job
## 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
Although her furniture hasn't been
delivered yet and she still harbors a
fear of earthquakes, Stanford's newest
arrival, Mary Edmonds, is quickly
making herself at home on campus.
Edmonds, Stanford's new vice pres
ident for student resources, quietly
assumed her position Sunday and has
been busy meeting with administra
tors and students this week.
"One of my first priorities will be to
deal with the consolidation of what's left
after the budget cuts," Edmonds said. "I
started yesterday, meeting with differ

ent people and hearing their concerns."
In her role as Stanford's highest
ranking student services official,
Edmonds plans to emphasize multi
culturalism and graduate students'
concerns.
"I really want to put some empha
sis on graduate student needs, and see
what issues they have that we can
address," Edmonds said. "Having
been a graduate student several times,
I know that there are things that
many times don't get spelled out. I
want to hear from them, too. Gradu
ate life can be very stressful."
Edmonds, who comes to Stanford
after serving as the vice president of

student affairs at Bowling Green State
University, holds degrees from Spel
man College, the University of Wis
consin, Western Reserve University,
Case Western Reserve University and
the University of Michigan.
Edmonds' office, Student Resources,
supervises residential education, finan
cial aid, undergraduate admissions and
other services that have a large impact
on student life.
She said she plans to organize
informal and formal student forums
in order to familiarize herself with
student concerns.

Mary Edmonds, the new vice president for student resources, is easing into Stanford life after taking over the job
on Sunday. She said she plans to emphasize multiculturalism and graduate student concerns in her new role.
But she has already had sever
al conversations with students.
"I had the opportunity to hang
out in the Coffee House and talk
with students, and I was really
impressed," she said. "Stanford
students aren't afraid to speak
their minds, and I think that's
very positive."
Edmonds defended the recent
ly announced 9.5 percent tuition
hike. "At some point it becomes
necessary to look and see how
important [a hike] is to preserve
the quality of education," she
said. "It was necessary."
Edmonds also stressed the
importance of multicultural ism on
campus in a time of budget cuts.
"Every culture has so much to
give to our understanding of the
human race, and on Stanford's
campus this idea is much more
well developed than I've seen any
place else," she said.
Stressing the importance of
including all students in multi
cultural education, Edmonds said
she hopes to make ethnic theme
houses "places not only where
students of certain nationalities
go but. . . places where other eth
nic groups interact with them so
that it will be a learning experi
ence on both ends."
Edmonds replaces Sally Ma
honey, who had served as acting
vice president since the position
was created in spring 1990.
Mahoney, who was formerly the
Registrar, has not announced her
future plans.
