Although her furniture hasn't been
delivered yet and she still harbors a
fear of earthquakes, Stanford's newest
arrival, Mary Edmonds, is quickly
making herself at home on campus.
Edmonds, Stanford's new vice pres
ident for student resources, quietly
assumed her position Sunday and has
been busy meeting with administra
tors and students this week.
"One of my first priorities will be to
deal with the consolidation of what's left
after the budget cuts," Edmonds said. "I
started yesterday, meeting with differ

ent people and hearing their concerns."
In her role as Stanford's highest
ranking student services official,
Edmonds plans to emphasize multi
culturalism and graduate students'
concerns.
"I really want to put some empha
sis on graduate student needs, and see
what issues they have that we can
address," Edmonds said. "Having
been a graduate student several times,
I know that there are things that
many times don't get spelled out. I
want to hear from them, too. Gradu
ate life can be very stressful."
Edmonds, who comes to Stanford
after serving as the vice president of

student affairs at Bowling Green State
University, holds degrees from Spel
man College, the University of Wis
consin, Western Reserve University,
Case Western Reserve University and
the University of Michigan.
Edmonds' office, Student Resources,
supervises residential education, finan
cial aid, undergraduate admissions and
other services that have a large impact
on student life.
She said she plans to organize
informal and formal student forums
in order to familiarize herself with
student concerns.
