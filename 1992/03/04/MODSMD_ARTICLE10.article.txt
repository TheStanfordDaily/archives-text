# Underground work to finish this week

The construction work on the
avenue between the Quad and the
School of Education will be nearly
finished by the end of this week,
according to Construction Man
ager for Underground Utilities
Lewis Lane.
The project, to replace a cor
roded steam pipe, has obstructed
traffic on that avenue since win
ter break.
The pipe that is being replaced
returns water used in the School
of Education's heating system to
the Central Energy Facility on
campus, Lane said.
That facility provides steam to
heat a number of academic build
ings and student dormitories. The
steam is conducted to the build
ings by one pipe, then returned
after it has condensed to be treat
ed and reused, Lane said.
Lane said the fences around

the construction area will likely
be removed by the end of the
week, when the pipe work and
most of the repaying is finished.
Workers will perform some sur
face restoration and clean-up as
late as Dead Week, he said.
The project was undertaken
after the University discovered
that the pipe was leaking and had
to be replaced, Lane said. Work
was delayed until the beginning of
winter break when students
would not be on campus.
Working in that area posed
some problems, Lane said,
because in addition to having to
plan for pedestrian and bike
access, workers also had to work
around other utilities that are
concentrated in the vicinity.
"It's an older part of campus
and there are a lot of existing util
ities that run under that area,"
Lane said. "We had to dig below
them and thread the new pipe
through."
