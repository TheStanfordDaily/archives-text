Clinton, Tsongas, Brown, Bush all win
WASHINGTON (AP) — With Bill Clinton's Georgia primary
sweep and a road-show victory for Paul Tsongas in Maryland,
each of the front-running Democrats won what he needed most
yesterday — but neither could vault past the other.
President Bush won three Republican primaries, but chal
lenger Patrick Buchanan came close enough in Georgia to end
any White House hope that his conservative rebellion can be
quashed soon.
Jerry Brown — a forgotten man in the Democratic field — took
a surprising, slender lead in Colorado and became the third
Democratic primary winner of the night.
Buchanan was gaining 30 percent or more of the vote in all
three Republican races, but Bush said his victories in Georgia,
Maryland and Colorado put him "well on our way to the nomina
tion." He won 90 percent of the available delegates and said he
was "committed to regaining" the support of voters who deserted
him for Buchanan.
