# Virus giving computer users the jitters

Finally, art history and computer science
majors have something in common —
Michelangelo.
Michelangelo is a computer virus pro
grammed to destroy computer files on IBM
PCs and PC-compatible computers around the
world on March 6, the artist's 517 th birthday.
On campus, the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center is the only place where the virus has
been detected so far.
Tim Weai, director of computer services at
the Graduate School of Business, said
Michelangelo spreads to computers through
the use of infected disks, and can also infect
disks used on computers that have contracted
the virus.
The virus will rewrite the hard disk of an

infected computer, effectively erasing all of
the files, Weai said.
The origin of the virus remains unknown,
according to Richard Anderson, a program
mer/analyst for University Library Systems.
Anti-virus programs that will prevent
Michelangelo from taking effect are being dis
tributed free of charge on the second floor of
Sweet Hall. Another way to protect against
the virus is by making backup copies of the
hard disk, Weai said.
If a computer has not been protected
against the virus, its hard disk "is going to
take a beating," said Lance Nakata, systems
programmer for Libraries and Information
Resources.
Student concern over Michelangelo has
been widespread, Nakata said, adding that an
unprecedented number of people have
requested the anti-virus program this week.

He said increased awareness will benefit all
computer users by eliminating Michelangelo
and any other viruses that might exist on com
puters around campus.
But Weai, who directs a cluster of more
than 200 IBMs, said the threat of the virus has
been "blown way out of proportion," noting
that Michelangelo can be quite easily con
trolled by protecting the IBMs.
Nadeem Hussein, assistant director of Res
idential Education Computing, said some
Macintosh owners "were getting very ner
vous" about the virus before learning it
wouldn't affect their computers.
SLAC representative Patricia Hittrick said
faculty and staff there have "very definitely"
been scared about the virus. Anti-virus pro
grams have been run on the computers at
SLAC every morning this week, according to
Bittrick.
