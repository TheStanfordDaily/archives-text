## Editorial Revealing diversity

University should start
studying differences in
its one 'Asian' category

Although meant to be descrip
tive, the term Asian-Ameri
can has proven to be decep
tively vague.
There are at least nine different
subgroups within the Asian-Ameri
can community in which members
have vastly different backgrounds
and experiences than the others.
But the University treats these
people exactly the same, without
gathering the information neces
sary to determine whether certain
groups deserve special attention.
The Office of Undergraduate
Admissions should begin monitor
ing the hidden diversity within the
Asian community by dividing the
blanket category of Asian-Ameri
can/Pacific Islander into nine sub
groups, as the U.S. Census office
did for the first time in 1980.
This way, the University can
determine whether any of the
nationalities should be designated
targeted minorities, who then
would be eligible for recruitment
and financial aid benefits.
Although it would be difficult to
argue that Asian-Americans as a
whole — who comprise about 25
percent of this year's freshman
class — are underrepresented at
Stanford, certain subgroups within
the community — such as Filipinos
and Vietnamese-Americans — Eire
believed to be underrepresented.
However, since the Registrar's
Office does not collect data on indi
vidual ethnicities, no one at the
University can use concrete data
as an arguing point either way. In
fact, members of these subgroups
don't even know for sure — they
must skim the Stanford Directory
looking for appropriate last names
to approximate their numbers.
The 1989 report of the Univer
sity Committee on Minority Iss
ues recommended that University

recognize and target certain Asian-
American subgroups, including
Filipinos, Native Hawaiians and
Southeast Asians.
And while this issue has been
discussed by University officials, no
action has been taken yet. Sharon
Parker, the director of the Office of
Multicultural Development said
last week that many "are not ready
to deal with it,"and the issue "may
be too complex for some."
The issue is indeed complex, but
it is also very real. There are signif
icant differences between groups
such as Japanese- and Chinese-
Americans who came to the coun
try in masses after the 1964 Immi
gration Act, and more recent new
comers, such as Filipino-Ameri
cans. Socioeconomic status plays a
big role in these differences, as
does their educational background
and whether they learn English as
a first or second language.
If the University would follow
the census report and include nine
sub-groups on the admissions
application, administrators could
gain a better sense of the status of
these groups at Stanford, and a bet
ter understanding of what action is
needed to ensure a real balance
within the Asian community.
If the new information shows
that certain ethnicities are not
adequately represented, the Uni
versity could then debate whether
to make those groups targeted
minorities.
Targeted minority status means
that members pf that group can
qualify for certain financial aid
benefits. To be a targeted minority,
a group must be underrepresented
on campus due to historical dis
crimination in this country.
By simply changing the admis
sions application and compiling
the data, it can be determined
whether Stanford is really as
diverse as it could be. Once the
facts are available, there will be a
better basis for a continued discus
sion of hidden diversity, and
admissions officers could at least
have the hard facts to look at
instead of playing a guessing game.
