## Bridging the religious gap 
### 
IWAS UNDER SIEGE, Intellectual
Atheists to the left of me and The God
Squad to the right.
I encountered the first group in West
ern Torture. In it we studied the great lit
erary pillars of the Western World from
Plato to Marx. My discussion section
seethed with brilliance and a splash of
sycophancy, which made for intense
debate.
I loved this environment. I came to
class each day armed with an unread text
in my hand and a host of football analo
gies in my mind. Soon, however, I began
to get smacked across the face with sober
ing challenges to my basic beliefs. "Reli
gion," Marx cried, "is the opium of the
people." Freud vociferated, "Religion is a
grand delusion," and Nietzsche simply
concluded, "God is dead."
The moment I admitted I was a Chris
tian, the altercation began. They hurled
condemnations at me couched as ques
tions: "How could you believe . . . ?" or
"Do you really think . . . ?". I desperately
searched to find religious evidence which
would meet their academic standards.
But nay, all I could stammer was, "Guys,
it's just like running a pattern against a
two deep zone — you can't see it, but you
know its there."
Thank goodness, however, for the God
Squad — the group of Christians that fre
quented my freshmen dorm. They were
on a mission from God, saving our cam

pus from Satan. "Conversion" was their
chant and I wasn't spared their atten
tion. However, my quiet assurances to
them that Christ was in my life saved my
soul from persecution and judgement,
not to mention fire and brimstone.
I still remember my friend coming to
me literally in tears. She was tired of her
roommates continuous judgement and
attempts to coerce her into accepting
Christ in her life. She wanted to know
what to do. I thought this called for dras
tic action, so I told her to put up a few
Hell's Angels posters and get a large jar
of (lubricated) condoms.
I suggested that each day, when her
roommate was out, she take oiie condom,
unroll it and conspicuously leave it on the
edge of the trash can. Our Satanic Slut Plan
never was initiated, but planning it gave us
a good laugh and made us both feel better.
Thanks to these groups and some per
sonal weakness, I became embarrassed of
my religious beliefs and subsequently
buried them deep within me, safe and
secure from any scrutiny or adverse judge
ment. I still believed in God, but now reli
gion was personal and intimately private.
Fortunately, a few campus leaders and
some family members countered my sup
pression with some stiff doses of logic.
Through discussion and trial and error, I
have come to a few conclusions.
Unexamined faith is like having no
faith at all. Something as deeply a part of

me as my religious beliefs deserves open
examination.
Further, whether one is Moslim or
Mormon, atheist or agnostic, religion
profoundly shapes all of our lives. Our
government, social interactions and fam
ily lives are steeped in a religious ethos.
Religion merits a more sufficient dia
logue. However, dialogue does not mean
coercion or condemnation; it means
working to achieve understanding.
What do we believe in ? Why do we hold
—these beliefs ? Hxtw do these beliefs shape
our lives? These are essential questions,
which I have rarely heard asked.
It amazes me how many of my friends,
myself included, rarely discuss or examine
our spiritual beliefs. Multicultural discus
sions have become pleasant axioms on cam
pus, but religious exchanges are rarities.
Spirituality, race, ethnicity and gender
are all self-defining elements which neces
sitate our attention and understanding.
However, our many forms of spirituality
have sadly been left out of the equation.

Cory thanks Bob Gregg and Floyd
Thompkins for their contributions to this
column and to his life. They're sweeter
than a touchdown against USC.
