COP members defend their term, list accomplishments

T") EADING THE RETROSPECTIVE
of our term in yesterday's Daily,
JL Vprinted the day that candidate dec
larations are due, we can't help believing
that The Daily was intentionally con
tributing to the bitter partisanship which
plagues this campus every spring. By
printing unsubstantiated, scurrilous
claims of candidates for next year's Coun
cil of Presidents, The Daily has launched
this year's campaign prematurely.
We feel that we must set the record
straight on several points.
We promised to focus on Stanford stu
dent issues and that is exactly what we've
done. Financial aid, at the local and
national levels, is a Stanford student issue.
Simply because an issue affects life outside
Campus Drive does not mean a priori that
the student government cannot act on it.
This has never been our contention.
Anyone who reads The Daily or is
involved in the budget process knows
that we have led the fight for fair tuition

and financial aid. We have participated
actively both inside and outside the Uni
versity process. We spearheaded the
markedly successful fight against the
half-million dollar student health fee.
Admittedly, to this point, we have
shown restraint, not calling for sit-ins or
strikes. But we have not compromised
our principles. We have been influential
because we have been thoroughly pre
pared and reasoned in our dealings with
our University.
We have sought common ground for
students wherever possible, but some
times divisive campus issues require a
controversial stand.
John Overdeck attended meetings of
the Coalition Against Sexual Assault and
discussed the burden-of-proof changes
before fighting to keep the "beyond a
reasonable doubt" standard. While our
view on the subject was obviously not
held unanimously, we sought out other
perspectives and took the majority view

of students.
Aside from taking our pay cut (a
peripheral promise), we also followed
through on a variety of other things not
discussed in this retrospective. Hard
work is less glamorous than partisan
politics, but no less valuable.
We have developed a Course Guide.
We have involved many graduate stu
dents in University decision-making. We
held a leadership summit.
We also developed a laser-printing
service, but were thwarted by the very
senators who accuse us of not being
accountable. They evidently thought the
service would be better put in the Storke
Publications Building instead of Tresid
der Union.
We have printed the ASSU News,
which has included complete funding
results and roll-call voting records. We
held open meetings about the budget
process with administration representa
tives including University President

Donald Kennedy, Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Ewart Thomas and Busi
ness School Dean Michael Spence.
We have developed a proposal to
improve Food Service pricing, which is
currently being discussed. We have
argued that graduate housing could even
make money for Stanford.
Finally, we have worked hard, but
maybe not hard enough, to welcome all
students into our office, to work with
them and to foster a sense of shared val
ues and community, instead of division.
In the future, we hope that candi
dates for office this year are given equal
coverage in The Daily and that the
reporting will center on their pro-active
views rather than their cheap shots at
the outgoing COP.
