# Majority control of art a fairer way to decide
## 
### 
Public taste is often poor and always
fickle. That George Bush was elected by
a majority of American voters doesn't
make him a great president. That a
majority of people are offended by
Robert Mapplethorpe's fist-in-sphincter
camera work doesn't make him a bad
artist, either.
There is a difference, though,
between protecting offensive art and
sponsoring it. There is a difference
between censoring offensive art and sim
ply ignoring it. There is a difference
between saying, "You can't print that"
and"I won't print that." One suppresses
liberty, the other expresses it.
Unfortunately, freedom of the press
does not mean everyone who wants it

can afford it. That's why we have a
National Endowment for the Arts.
But even the NEA can only afford so
many printing presses: some projects will
inevitably be excluded, if for nothing else
than lack of funds. Someone will have to
make a choice. Will it be the self-appointed
iwant garde, or the backward American
taxpayer?
Perhaps it will be tyranny all around:
the tyranny of a tenured, incestuous
Ministry of Taste, telling us what "post
moderns" should like or will like when
we get hip enough to understand it.
Perhaps it will be a tyranny of the
majority, where all we get is Guess?
jeans and Hallmark poetry.
But if it must be a tyranny, I prefer
the "dictatorship of the proletariat." I
may be shouted down, but there, at
least, I have a voice.
