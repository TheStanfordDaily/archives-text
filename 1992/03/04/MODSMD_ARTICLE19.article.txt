# Vulgarity cannot pass as artistic expression

"The arts under siege," reads the head
line over the editorial in Monday's Daily.
This same editorial continues by stating
that the firing of the director of the Nation
al Endowment of the Arts is "a frightening
example of government censorship."
Well, let's see how frightening it is. I
won't get into a discussion as to whether
the government should ever be put into a
position where it can decide what is or isn't
art. That's a whole other ballgame. I want
to discuss some of the projects the NEA
directly or indirectly underwrote by grants.
For example, there was the famous
"Piss-Christ" exhibit which caused a stir
in Cincinnati not too long ago. Now sup
posing the pail of urine had as its exhibit
not Jesus Christ but the Star of David and

Moses holding the tablet of the Ten Com
mandments? Would Jews have a right to
protest such a government grant on the
grounds that the exhibit was anti-Semitic?
Supposing the pail of urine had as its
exhibit the Crescent and a drawing of
Mohammed and it was called Piss-Islam.
Would Moslems have a right to protest
such a government grant as anti-Islamic?
And how about if the pail of urine
contained a map of Africa and a photo
graph of Jesse Jackson? Would African-
Americans have a right to demand that
such an exhibit be destroyed as insulting
to black people?
Or is it art only when you make a
mockery of Christianity and Christ?
Your editorial embraces the principle
that art should be supported "regardless
of the message it conveys." Racism?
Male chauvinism?
