# Quarterly student fee for Cowell is rejected
## Health center won't have to meet budget target 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The University will not institute a quar
terly fee for Cowell Student Health Center,
University President Donald Kennedy
announced yesterday.
"There was a broad consensus that we
should not add that charge," Kennedy said.
"We had a hard look ... and considered the
charge to be inappropriate."
Rather than face severe cuts, Cowell
will not be required to meet its reduction
target and reductions will be spread else
where in the University, Kennedy said.
The Cabinet Committee on Budget and
Strategic Planning had been considering
imposing a quarterly student fee of $8 to
avoid drastic reductions in services provid
ed by Cowell.
The original proposal from Student
Resources contained a $14 fee per quarter,
but the cabinet budget committee rejected
that in early January.

The $8 fee was designed to generate
$300,000 in additional revenue — about
half of Cowell's overall target — to avoid
cutting the free specialty referral service.
"We fought long and hard to prevent the
University from opening loopholes," said
Council of Presidents member John
Overdeck, a member of the Student Resources
budget committee and the Cowell advisory
committee. "I am glad that the University
feels students have given enough for this year
and will give more than enough next year.
"We avoided the fee and will not be
transferring the cost to insurance, which
would have been a tremendous burden on
graduate students. The University realized
that it has to keep doing what it is
doing," Overdeck said.
Kennedy said he was concerned
that a series of small fees would
eventually add up.
"People feel they are being nib
bled to death by small ducks," he
said.
Overdeck agreed with Kennedy's
assessment. "The fees are an effort
at nickel and diming students. I do
not want us to get in a situation like
Harvard, which has $1,100 in small
student fees," he said.
Although the University "is
not quite sure where" the
$300,000 will be found, Kennedy
said Cowell will not be forced to
make additional cuts.
"We will eat it somewhere. ...
Cowell will not eat it,"he said.
Kennedy added that while Stu
dent Resources will not be forced
to cut the additional $300,000
from its budget, the cuts will
come from an administrative area
rather than academics.
Slicing Cowell's target in half
will not eliminate all of its pain,
Overdeck said.
"It is still a sizable cut," he
said. "I wish we were able to save
aerobics and more of the psycho
logical services, as well as more of
the afler-hours care."
