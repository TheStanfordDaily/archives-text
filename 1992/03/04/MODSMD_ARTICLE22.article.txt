"People feel they are
being nibbled to death by
small ducks."
â€” University President Don
ald Kennedy, on yesterday's
decision to reject a quarterly
fee for Coivell Student
Health Center. Instead, the
center will not be required to
meet its budget reduction
target and reductions will be
spread elsewhere in the Uni
versity. Kennedy said he was
concerned that instituting a
series of small fees would
eventually add up. See story,
