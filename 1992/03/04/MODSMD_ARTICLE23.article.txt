## Bill Walsh's expectations are high for Stanford 
### T.C.Hall Senior staff writer 
Bill Walsh came to Stanford surround
ed by much hoopla and excitement —
excitement that still has not died down.
The Daily recently caught up with Walsh
to help the University better understand
the man behind the headlines. This is the
first of a two-part interview.
Daily: Your decision to come here caught
the sports world by surprise, especially
Stanford. People are still wondering—
why Stanford at this point in your
career, why now?
Walsh: I think it is a wonderful opportu
nity for me to return to Stanford, to be
on a college campus and exchange,
communicate, and commiserate with
faculty and students, to teach, the
thing I have trained myself to do for
many years ... and also to effect, I
hope in a positive way, the athletes
themselves. It was a great experience
the previous time and I think I have
more to offer this time around.
Daily: You haven't even coached a game
here yet, and there had already been
rumblings the day after you got here
that you are already planning to move
on, that you have alternate plans. How
long are planning to be here? Will you
end your career here?
Walsh: I have a five year contract, and I
don't plan to leave before then, but I
think if there was a massive uprising of
the student body and the local commu
nity, I could be driven out. In the mean
time I am very happy. There isn't any
thing I would prefer to do, and it cer
tainly wouldn't be professional sports,
so I don't know what other alternatives
I have. This is what I've chosen.
Daily: Do you have a specific agenda for
the Stanford football program?
Walsh: Not really, I think we will just
carry on as Dennis Green had done.
We'll hopefully refine certain areas as
he probably would have done. We'd like
to think we could raise the perfor
mance of the team to another level at
some point and look toward a Rose
Bowl, but the only real response to that
kind of question is how we do on the
field. ... If it improves, or if we can
hold our own and then improve, then
we are looking to try to reach the next
level and I think itjs well within reason
to believe that Stanford can contend
for the Rose Bowl at some point within
these next five years.
Daily: In relation to your last stint as a

coach, do you think that history can
repeat itself?
Walsh: [The current] team is much bet
ter than the teams that I coached at
Stanford. Unfortunately the opposition
is much better ... so everything has
equated itself. We are in the same
arena, and the schedule is very difficult
— adding Texas A&M (the August 26
Pigskin Classic opponent) is a shocking
development — but on the other hand
it will be a challenge to us. ... It is as
tough a schedule that you can find, and
as challenging as any schedule in the
country.

*1 like the idea of being
ranked in the top 20 every
year as a football power. I
think that is a real state
ment for this university.'

Daily: Ted Leland wouldn't admit this in
the press conference, but you must real
ize that there are a lot of expectations of
you personally and the team. What
would happen next year if you started
out the schedule 0-3?
Walsh: It could happen. I'm not going to
worry that much about those kinds of
things. All I concern myself with is that
my players reach their own potential
under our direction, and they have the
chance to play the best football they are
capable of playing. ... It is a challenge
to the Stanford student, but it is a wel
come challenge and the guys will thrive
on it just as they did with Denny Green.
Daily: What does Stanford need — in
terms of players, facilities, and money
— that could bring the school a nation
al championship?
Walsh: I don't think we need anything. A
national championship may or may not
occur in football for Stanford, just as in
basketball. ... I like the idea of being
ranked in the top 20 every year as a
football power. I think that is a real
statement for this university. Now to
be No. 1, gosh, I'm not even going to
think about it.
Daily: Do you have a coaching philoso
phy? - ... . , .. . .
Walsh: [My] coaching philosophy is preci
sion, execution; it is interdependence
between one athlete and another; it is
the ability perform under incredible

stress, as they will have to do later in
their lives; it is the bonding of athletes
and coaches; it is all of those experi
ences that successful and happy people
who get the most out of their lives as
adults [go through].
Daily. What about expectations? Do you
think the expectations of yourself are
unfair?
Walsh: As far as the team's success ...
well, that will have to take place one
way or another. I'm not here to make
any bravado statements about how the
team will do. All I want is for us to play
to our ultimate potential as a team,
that's what my job is.
Daily: What kind of a coach are you? Do
you yell and scream? Do you get excited?
Walsh: I'm not (emotional), I don't think.
There is some profanity here and there.
It is a very personal approach, it is
hands on.
Daily: What is more stressful, college or
the pros?
Walsh: They're the same. The support
system in college is much better, espe
cially in this day and age. The pres
sures on the professional coach are
almost impossible to deal with over a
period of time, but in college you get
much more support through the ath
letic department, through the student
body, through the alumni network. But
as far as the competition, there is no
difference whatsoever (between college
and the pros) in intensity and the will
to win and the determination and
everything that goes with it. Of course,
I was a high school coach at one time
and I say the same thing about that.
Daily: The converse to that is what is
more fun, collegiate or professional
coaching?
Walsh: I think this is more fun, no ques
tion. These are amateur athletes.
These are people who play because they
thoroughly enjoy playing . . . this is not
the atmosphere in which you are going
to get the selfish materialism that can
develop in all of us that we often see in
the professional athlete.
Daily: In closing, what kind of statement
would you give Stanford University
about what to expect from Bill Walsh
and from the Stanford football team?
Walsh: We are going to have class, we are
going to play with precision, we are going
to play with great intensity, and we are
going to reach our full potential. But
that is not always going to spell victory.

Walsh: It could happen. I'm not going to
worry that much about those kinds of
things. All I concern myself with is that
my players reach their own potential
under our direction, and they have the
chance to play the best football they are
capable of playing. ... It is a challenge
to the Stanford student, but it is a wel
come challenge and the guys will thrive
on it just as they did with Denny Green.
Daily: What does Stanford need — in
terms of players, facilities, and money
— that could bring the school a nation
al championship?
Walsh: I don't think we need anything. A
national championship may or may not
occur in football for Stanford, just as in
basketball. ... I like the idea of being
ranked in the top 20 every year as a
football power. I think that is a real
statement for this university. Now to
be No. 1, gosh, I'm not even going to
think about it.
Daily: Do you have a coaching philoso
phy? - ... . , .. . .
Walsh: [My] coaching philosophy is preci
sion, execution; it is interdependence
between one athlete and another; it is
the ability perform under incredible

stress, as they will have to do later in
their lives; it is the bonding of athletes
and coaches; it is all of those experi
ences that successful and happy people
who get the most out of their lives as
adults [go through].
Daily. What about expectations? Do you
think the expectations of yourself are
unfair?
Walsh: As far as the team's success ...
well, that will have to take place one
way or another. I'm not here to make
any bravado statements about how the
team will do. All I want is for us to play
to our ultimate potential as a team,
that's what my job is.
Daily: What kind of a coach are you? Do
you yell and scream? Do you get excited?
Walsh: I'm not (emotional), I don't think.
There is some profanity here and there.
It is a very personal approach, it is
hands on.
Daily: What is more stressful, college or
the pros?
Walsh: They're the same. The support
system in college is much better, espe
cially in this day and age. The pres
sures on the professional coach are
almost impossible to deal with over a
period of time, but in college you get
much more support through the ath
letic department, through the student
body, through the alumni network. But
as far as the competition, there is no
difference whatsoever (between college
and the pros) in intensity and the will
to win and the determination and
everything that goes with it. Of course,
I was a high school coach at one time
and I say the same thing about that.
Daily: The converse to that is what is
more fun, collegiate or professional
coaching?
Walsh: I think this is more fun, no ques
tion. These are amateur athletes.
These are people who play because they
thoroughly enjoy playing . . . this is not
the atmosphere in which you are going
to get the selfish materialism that can
develop in all of us that we often see in
the professional athlete.
Daily: In closing, what kind of statement
would you give Stanford University
about what to expect from Bill Walsh
and from the Stanford football team?
Walsh: We are going to have class, we are
going to play with precision, we are going
to play with great intensity, and we are
going to reach our full potential. But
that is not always going to spell victory.


• Ernest Villanueva — Daily
In an interview with the Daily, coach Bill Walsh spoke about Stanford football next
year. "We are going to have class, we are going to play with precision, we are going
to play with great intensity, and we are going to reach our full potential."
Bill Walsh came to Stanford surround
ed by much hoopla and excitement —
excitement that still has not died down.
The Daily recently caught up with Walsh
to help the University better understand
the man behind the headlines. This is the
first of a two-part interview.
Daily: Your decision to come here caught
the sports world by surprise, especially
Stanford. People are still wondering—
why Stanford at this point in your
career, why now?
Walsh: I think it is a wonderful opportu
nity for me to return to Stanford, to be
on a college campus and exchange,
communicate, and commiserate with
faculty and students, to teach, the
thing I have trained myself to do for
many years ... and also to effect, I
hope in a positive way, the athletes
themselves. It was a great experience
the previous time and I think I have
more to offer this time around.
Daily: You haven't even coached a game
here yet, and there had already been
rumblings the day after you got here
that you are already planning to move
on, that you have alternate plans. How
long are planning to be here? Will you
end your career here?
Walsh: I have a five year contract, and I
don't plan to leave before then, but I
think if there was a massive uprising of
the student body and the local commu
nity, I could be driven out. In the mean
time I am very happy. There isn't any
thing I would prefer to do, and it cer
tainly wouldn't be professional sports,
so I don't know what other alternatives
I have. This is what I've chosen.
Daily: Do you have a specific agenda for
the Stanford football program?
Walsh: Not really, I think we will just
carry on as Dennis Green had done.
We'll hopefully refine certain areas as
he probably would have done. We'd like
to think we could raise the perfor
mance of the team to another level at
some point and look toward a Rose
Bowl, but the only real response to that
kind of question is how we do on the
field. ... If it improves, or if we can
hold our own and then improve, then
we are looking to try to reach the next
level and I think itjs well within reason
to believe that Stanford can contend
for the Rose Bowl at some point within
these next five years.
Daily: In relation to your last stint as a

coach, do you think that history can
repeat itself?
Walsh: [The current] team is much bet
ter than the teams that I coached at
Stanford. Unfortunately the opposition
is much better ... so everything has
equated itself. We are in the same
arena, and the schedule is very difficult
— adding Texas A&M (the August 26
Pigskin Classic opponent) is a shocking
development — but on the other hand
it will be a challenge to us. ... It is as
tough a schedule that you can find, and
as challenging as any schedule in the
country.

*1 like the idea of being
ranked in the top 20 every
year as a football power. I
think that is a real state
ment for this university.'

Daily: Ted Leland wouldn't admit this in
the press conference, but you must real
ize that there are a lot of expectations of
you personally and the team. What
would happen next year if you started
out the schedule 0-3?
Walsh: It could happen. I'm not going to
worry that much about those kinds of
things. All I concern myself with is that
my players reach their own potential
