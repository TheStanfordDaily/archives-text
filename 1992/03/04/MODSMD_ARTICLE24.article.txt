# Card nine crushes Davis with hitting
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
The mid-week curse very
nearly claimed another victim
Tuesday. The Stanford base
ball team, currently ranked
fourth in the nation, won 9-7
over the UC-Davis Aggies, but
not without some effort. For
the fourth game in a row, the
Cardinal, due to ineffective
starting pitching, had to rely
upon its bats.
The starting pitcher for
Stanford was Jamie Sepeda.
Unfortunately, Sepeda did not
have his best stuff on Tuesday,
as he allowed five runs in three
innings pitched. His reliever,
Tim Moore, did not fare much
better, allowing two more runs
in two and two-third innings.
However, Stanford made up
for any problems by swinging
the bat well. Banner games at
the plate were turned in by
Dave Cornell, who had three
hits, scored three runs and had
a stolen base, and Steve
Solomon, who had two hits,
two RBIs and a stolen base.

The score stood at 7-4 in favor
of Davis going into the bottom
of the sixth.
The mighty Steve Solomon
began the rally by nailing a
"skyball" solo shot to right
field, his first of the season.
Next, the only slightly less
mighty Dusty Allen reached
base thanks to an Aggie E-5,
and then scored on a Mark
Skeels RBI single, who in turn
scored on another error by the
Davis third baseman, tying the
score at seven.
In the seventh, freshman
shortstop Jed Hansen led off
the inning with a stand-up
double to left, extending his
hitting streak to eight games.
Cornell then laid down a sacri
fice bunt which was over
thrown by the pitcher, allowing
Hansen to score and Cornell to
reach second. Solomon fol
lowed with a second sacrifice
bunt, and Allen drove in the
run with a long sac fly to right.
The Cardinal would hold on to
its 9-7 lead thanks to the pitch
ing of Andrew Lorraine and
Aaron Dorlarque.
