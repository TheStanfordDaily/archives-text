# Rugby crushes Aggies
## 
### Trevor Brown 
The Stanford rugby team
loosened the noose around its
throat this weekend, harvesting
the Aggies of U.C. Davis 25-7.
With the annual rugby Big Game
this upcoming weekend against
Cal, the Cardinal (5-1) played
well enough to remain in the
hunt for a play-off berth.
In typical fashion, Stanford
started off slow. It was 20 min
utes into the game before the
Cardinal scored their first try
against Davis. Stanford then
dominated the opposition, scor
ing the bulk of their points in the
middle for 40 minutes of the
match. Only in the final
moments df the game did the
Cardinal defense fold, allowing
the Aggies to plough through
and score.

"We need pressure, pressure,
pressure all game long. This day
we were not putting the pressure
on together," said Stanford
coach Franck Boivert.
The Card needs to work out
the kinks this week if they stand
a chance of toppling perennial
Pacific Coast Conference cham
pion Cal this weekend. The
match between Cal and Stanford
marks the centennial anniver
sary of the first rugby Big Game
played in 1906.
"We've haven't beaten them
in 12 years. We've got to go out
and win," said senior captain
John Hamilton.
But the Cardinal is knocking.
In their most recent match, little
over a month ago, Stanford lost
by only nine points, a narrow
margin in a game as dynamic as
rugby.
