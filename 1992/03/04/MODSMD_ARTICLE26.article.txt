# Slow day, error hurt golf

It was a mistake that anyone could have
made.
After all, the golfers at the Ping Arizona
Intercollegiate Invitational were in a hurry to
get out to their "shotgun" start around the
Tucson Country Club course, looking to play
the 18 holes that would make up for Mon
day's rain and provide the minimum of 36
needed for the tournament to count.
Understandably, Stanford junior Mike
Milliken was unaware of the fact that he had
placed his putter in the bag of teammate Dave
Rutkowski, also a junior. When Rutkowski
was found to have 15 clubs with him at each
of the first two holes, he was penalized a total
of four strokes, taking his total on the day
from a two-over-par 74 to a six-over 78.
For the Cardinal, the Ping competition
ultimately resulted in a tenth-place tie at 584,
18 strokes behind top-ranked Arizona State,
who won with a four-man total of 566. How
ever, the Stanford linksters will remember
their final tournament of winter quarter more
clearly as one of the "could-have-beens."
For instance, it could have been a 54-hole
tourney as scheduled if a driving rainstorm
hadn't made it impossible to play half of Mon

day's 36 scheduled holes. This would have
given the Cardinal another trip around the
course to improve on its 12th-place standing
at the time; in fact, at 16 strokes back, Stan
ford had lost most of its ground on the Sun
Devils on the first day. Tuesday's three
under-par performance for the Cardinal was
the second best total among the 17 partici
pating teams.
"We have to get over our slow starts," head
coach Wally Goodwin said. "This is the third
or fourth tournament this year where we've
had an outstanding second round but
couldn't overcome a bad first day."
Without the penalty situation, Stanford
would have vaulted into an eighth place tie just
three strokes out of the top five.
On the positive side, it could have been the
beginning of the "Steve Burdick era" for the
Cardinal golf program. Burdick, a freshman
from Rocklin, California, who was taking part
in his first collegiate tournament, shot a five
under 67 on Tuesday. It was the lowest score
of any Stanford golfer either day. Coupled
with a 76 on Monday, his total of 143 strokes
tied Burdick atop the team's leader board.
"I was thrilled for Steve," Goodwin said.
"He upheld all the confidence I've had in him
since we recruited him. He'll be tough to get
out of the lineup now."
