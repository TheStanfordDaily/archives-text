For the first time in Stanford history, the
men's polo team defeated UC-Davis 15-13 in the
NCAA regional playoffs to clench the champi
onship title.
"It was an incredible battle," said junior John
Mcßitchie, president of the Stanford Polo Club.
"I was never sure who was ahead. It was very
close, and very intense."
"The team really came together — that's how
we won. We made them play our game, a more
technical, thinking game," Mcßitchie said. Stan
ford scored eight of their 15 goals on penalty shots,
whereas UC-Davis was unable to convert a single
one. This is the first time that UC-Davis will not
compete at Nationals.
For sophomore John Harris, who scored 13 of
Stanford's 15 goals, the pressure was "huge," he
said. Winning regionals meant a chance at compet
ing against Harris' older brother, a senior at the
University of Virginia, who makes up part of the
nation's top ranked team. "I had to try not to think
of winning and just play a great game," he said.
The Stanford men's team had to overcome a
lack of experience, which was only visible in the
first few minutes of the game against Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo, Stanford's opponent the day before.
The Mustangs were able to score three goals in the
first minute of play before Stanford pulled togeth
er as a team to win 15-6. Thereafter, the strength
of Stanford's teamwork never wavered.
The Stanford women's team was also able to
score a upset over Washington State.
