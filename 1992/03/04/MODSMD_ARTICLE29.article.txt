## Undergrad researchers ponder laboratory animal use 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
If you 'rein biology, you probably have this fascination
with living things, and you have respect for them....
But then here I am, snipping spinal cords.... [T]he
methods of biology are just so ugly. You just go in and
tear things apart to understand how they work. It
seems so antithetical.
— T. K., a senior, on the experience of under
graduate animal research.
Although undergraduate research is one of the
most coveted academic experiences at Stanford, many
students who work with animals in research laborato
ries find that the jump into real-world research is
accompanied by a host of confusing and distressing
emotional, moral and ethical dilemmas.
Some student researchers complain that they can't
express their reservations to their supervisors for fear
of losing their respect. But administrators say there
are outlets for discussing issues of the ethics of animal
research if students know where to look. v
The students interviewed for this article said they
wished to remain anonymous to preserve their work
ing relationships with their supervisors and because of
their fear of harassment from animal rights organiza
tions.
"When I first started my research project, I
thought the science was very interesting, but immedi
ately I had qualms about operating and sacrificing
animals," said T. K., who works in a lab studying
behavior.
"When I mentioned this to my professor, he just
gave me a pamphlet that all scientists distribute to
people who say anything about animal research. Basi
cally the pamphlet was just about all the benefits of
animal research.
"Of course, I know animal research has been bene
ficial, but it just didn't seem to me that he was empa
thetic. He didn't really seem to want to help me really
think through the issues," said T. K.
However, Thomas Hamm, chair of the comparative
medicine department, said he encouraged students
who feel uncomfortable raising the issue with their
researchers to talk with him or take his one unit class
— Intro to the Humane Use of Lab Animals, offered
through the Medical School.
"To people who have used animals for a long time in
research, these issues may seem trivial," Hamm said.
"I'm willing to give a talk or to debate and discuss
these issues with students. I don't consider these
issues trivial at all."
Unlike other animal research projects, which have
predictable medical applications, D. N.'s lab is con
ducting basic research on animal behavior.

"While the work is interesting, I have to wonder if
it will have any direct impact," said D. N. "If it's pure
ly for our own curiosity, I don't know if it's justifiable."
"My subjects are interesting, but it's 'basic
research' and I have to wonder what percentage of
basic research has any use," said T. K. "Is it 10 percent
or 90 percent? I don't know. If it's 10 percent, then it's
a big problem for me."
But according to Barbara Snapp, the undergradu
ate research coordinator in biology, "Many medical
problems can't be addressed until basic biology is
understood."
Students noted that their superiors' lack of sensi
tivity to the issues faced by first-time researchers may
be attributable to the fact that they grew up in a time
when animal research was widespread and animal
rights were almost unheard of.
With today's computer-modeling and tissue culture
techniques, undergraduates are more aware of the
alternatives to animal research.
"Part of that might be a generation gap thing — 30

years ago, when my professor was being trained,
nobody asked these questions," said S.H., a junior who
works in a lab at the medical school. "The moral status
of animals was never even considered the way it is by
some people today. Back then, everything was justifi
able. Now, not everyone's so sure."
T. K., D. N. and other first-time researchers com
plain that there is not enough information presented
in science classes about the methods of gathering
knowledge.
It was not until taking a neurobiology course that
T. K. learned of the invasive measures used to collect
data. "Finally, one day our teacher showed us a movie
about how they get I micro-electrode recordings]," said
T. K.
"They have to shave a monkey's head and drill four
holes into it, cut the skull, lift a piece of it off and then
drop an electrode into the brain," T. K. recalled.
"Everyone was freaked out because no one had any
idea about it.
"Most professors probably wouldn't even show a

film about research methods, and students would go
out into the world completely naive," said T. K. "You'd
be a scientist with absolutely no idea how biological
knowledge is gathered. That is a big gripe of mine —
no one ever talked about the methods, so I had never
thought about it before I got into research. I felt really
resentful. Though it was partially my fault, I really felt
deceived."
But Biology Prof. Patricia Jones says that com
pared to other universities, Stanford does a good job of
educating students about the use of animals in
research.
"In Biology 31 and 32 we always try to include not
only what the facts are, but we teach about tech
nique," said Jones.
While biology students may get some exposure to
the methods before they enter the lab, students in
human biology, psychology and other majors may not
receive any preparation. But even some biology stu
dents said they feel there is not enough attention paid
to the thorny issues that animal research raises.
D. N. suggested that there should be a separate
ethics requirement for biology majors offered outside
the department.
Lab meetings and reserve materials about the
ethics of research would also be helpful, student
researchers say.
"I think it would be great for us to have a lab meet
ing on it, but I don't think we ever will," said T. K. "I
wouldn't want to bring it up. It's the sort of thing you
can discuss in asides but not head-on."
Jones, who works in a separate lab with rats, said
that no student has ever come to her with questions
about the ethics of animals in research. "But I would
hope that there would be no barriers to discussion,"
she said. "Concerns about animal ethics shouldn't
serve as a barrier to being involved in research — there
are many types of research that don't involve animal
sacrifice at all.
"Some people don't feel right about some of the
work that goes on with animals and those philosophi
cal feelings should be respected," said Jones.
Some students, however, don't agree that the
atmosphere is open enough. Others note that the
presence of vocal animal rights groups often stifles
discussion.
"It's a very defensive climate because of all the ani
mal rights groups bothering the researchers.
Researchers are unwilling to admit that they're uncer
tain or that they have reservations, because that's
seen as an admission of weakness and then people will
jump on it," said T.K.
"If either side shows any sign of tentativeness
about their position, they are going to get pounced on.
Neither side wants to admit that maybe there's a mid
dle ground."


Biology Prof. Pat Jones holds one of her lab rats. She said that concerns about animal ethics shouldn't
prevent involvement in research, since there are many types of research that don't use animals at all.

"Part of that might be a generation gap thing — 30

years ago, when my professor was being trained,
nobody asked these questions," said S.H., a junior who
works in a lab at the medical school. "The moral status
of animals was never even considered the way it is by
some people today. Back then, everything was justifi
able. Now, not everyone's so sure."
T. K., D. N. and other first-time researchers com
plain that there is not enough information presented
in science classes about the methods of gathering
knowledge.
It was not until taking a neurobiology course that
T. K. learned of the invasive measures used to collect
data. "Finally, one day our teacher showed us a movie
about how they get I micro-electrode recordings]," said
T. K.
"They have to shave a monkey's head and drill four
holes into it, cut the skull, lift a piece of it off and then
drop an electrode into the brain," T. K. recalled.
"Everyone was freaked out because no one had any
idea about it.
"Most professors probably wouldn't even show a

film about research methods, and students would go
out into the world completely naive," said T. K. "You'd
be a scientist with absolutely no idea how biological
knowledge is gathered. That is a big gripe of mine —
no one ever talked about the methods, so I had never
thought about it before I got into research. I felt really
resentful. Though it was partially my fault, I really felt
deceived."
But Biology Prof. Patricia Jones says that com
pared to other universities, Stanford does a good job of
educating students about the use of animals in
research.
"In Biology 31 and 32 we always try to include not
only what the facts are, but we teach about tech
nique," said Jones.
While biology students may get some exposure to
the methods before they enter the lab, students in
human biology, psychology and other majors may not
receive any preparation. But even some biology stu
dents said they feel there is not enough attention paid
to the thorny issues that animal research raises.
D. N. suggested that there should be a separate
ethics requirement for biology majors offered outside
the department.
Lab meetings and reserve materials about the
ethics of research would also be helpful, student
researchers say.
"I think it would be great for us to have a lab meet
ing on it, but I don't think we ever will," said T. K. "I
wouldn't want to bring it up. It's the sort of thing you
can discuss in asides but not head-on."
Jones, who works in a separate lab with rats, said
that no student has ever come to her with questions
about the ethics of animals in research. "But I would
hope that there would be no barriers to discussion,"
she said. "Concerns about animal ethics shouldn't
serve as a barrier to being involved in research — there
are many types of research that don't involve animal
sacrifice at all.
"Some people don't feel right about some of the
work that goes on with animals and those philosophi
cal feelings should be respected," said Jones.
Some students, however, don't agree that the
atmosphere is open enough. Others note that the
presence of vocal animal rights groups often stifles
discussion.
"It's a very defensive climate because of all the ani
mal rights groups bothering the researchers.
Researchers are unwilling to admit that they're uncer
tain or that they have reservations, because that's
seen as an admission of weakness and then people will
jump on it," said T.K.
"If either side shows any sign of tentativeness
about their position, they are going to get pounced on.
Neither side wants to admit that maybe there's a mid
dle ground."

If you 'rein biology, you probably have this fascination
with living things, and you have respect for them....
But then here I am, snipping spinal cords.... [T]he
methods of biology are just so ugly. You just go in and
tear things apart to understand how they work. It
seems so antithetical.
— T. K., a senior, on the experience of under
graduate animal research.
Although undergraduate research is one of the
most coveted academic experiences at Stanford, many
students who work with animals in research laborato
ries find that the jump into real-world research is
accompanied by a host of confusing and distressing
emotional, moral and ethical dilemmas.
Some student researchers complain that they can't
express their reservations to their supervisors for fear
of losing their respect. But administrators say there
are outlets for discussing issues of the ethics of animal
research if students know where to look. v
The students interviewed for this article said they
wished to remain anonymous to preserve their work
ing relationships with their supervisors and because of
their fear of harassment from animal rights organiza
tions.
"When I first started my research project, I
thought the science was very interesting, but immedi
ately I had qualms about operating and sacrificing
animals," said T. K., who works in a lab studying
behavior.
"When I mentioned this to my professor, he just
gave me a pamphlet that all scientists distribute to
people who say anything about animal research. Basi
cally the pamphlet was just about all the benefits of
animal research.
"Of course, I know animal research has been bene
ficial, but it just didn't seem to me that he was empa
thetic. He didn't really seem to want to help me really
think through the issues," said T. K.
However, Thomas Hamm, chair of the comparative
medicine department, said he encouraged students
who feel uncomfortable raising the issue with their
researchers to talk with him or take his one unit class
— Intro to the Humane Use of Lab Animals, offered
through the Medical School.
"To people who have used animals for a long time in
research, these issues may seem trivial," Hamm said.
"I'm willing to give a talk or to debate and discuss
these issues with students. I don't consider these
issues trivial at all."
Unlike other animal research projects, which have
predictable medical applications, D. N.'s lab is con
ducting basic research on animal behavior.

"While the work is interesting, I have to wonder if
it will have any direct impact," said D. N. "If it's pure
ly for our own curiosity, I don't know if it's justifiable."
"My subjects are interesting, but it's 'basic
research' and I have to wonder what percentage of
basic research has any use," said T. K. "Is it 10 percent
or 90 percent? I don't know. If it's 10 percent, then it's
a big problem for me."
But according to Barbara Snapp, the undergradu
ate research coordinator in biology, "Many medical
problems can't be addressed until basic biology is
understood."
Students noted that their superiors' lack of sensi
tivity to the issues faced by first-time researchers may
be attributable to the fact that they grew up in a time
when animal research was widespread and animal
rights were almost unheard of.
With today's computer-modeling and tissue culture
techniques, undergraduates are more aware of the
alternatives to animal research.
