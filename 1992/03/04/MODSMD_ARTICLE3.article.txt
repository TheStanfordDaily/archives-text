# Kennedy will host D.C. environmental program

### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Imagine spending winter quarter living
with University President Donald Kennedy
in Washington, D.C.
Fifteen students will have that opportu
nity next year, as the University expands
its Stanford in Washington program to
include a winter quarter session limited to
undergraduates interested in environmen
tal issues.
Kennedy, whose resignation takes effect
in August, will serve as the faculty member
in residence during the program's first
year while also working as a visiting mem
ber of the World Resources Institute.
"At this point, it looks to me to be the
ideal way to get re-engaged with teaching,
working closely with Stanford undergradu
ates," said Kennedy, a biology professor
and former head of the Food and Drug

Administration. "I am
very enthusiastic about
the program."
The only significant dif
ference between the new
winter quarter program
and the other two quarters
is the environmental focus,
according to Jeanne Hal
leck, program coordinator
for Stanford in Washington.

"It will be very much like the fall and
spring," Halleck said. "Students will con
tinue to work in internships at a whole
range of government agencies and advoca
cy groups, as well as participate in the sem
inars and tutorials."
Political Science Prof. David Danelski,
director of Stanford in Washington, said
the environment is "one of the most impor-


Kennedy
tant issues for not only the U.S.,
but the world."
"The Washington program
will allow undergraduates to do
in-depth research and fully uti
lize the University's resources in
Washington, D.C.," Danelski
said, adding that the program "is
a big part of what undergradu
ates at Stanford will be doing in
environmental issues in the
future."
The first two years of the pro
gram will be funded by a
$160,000 expendable grant from
the Washington, D.C.-based
Summit Foundation, and Halleck
said Stanford in Washington is
"in the process of beginning
fundraising."
Having Kennedy as the first
faculty member "will be wonder
ful, both in terms of fundraising
and recruiting excellent stu
dents," Halleck said.
While Kennedy said he is look
ing forward to the program, his
biggest fear is that it will not
attract any students.
"Now that we have raised the
money, organized the program
and made the announcement,
there is a sudden feeling of 'sup
pose we give a party and no one
comes,'" Kennedy said. "I am
holding my breath, hoping for
applicants."
But Halleck said Kennedy's
fears are unfounded. "We have
always had students interested
in environmental issues," she
said.
Sophomore Eric Selmon, who
will major in the recently
approved Earth Systems, said he
"definitely plans to look into the
new program. ... It might
encourage me to go to Washing
ton, D.C., when otherwise I might
not go."
Halleck said a timeline has not
been worked out, but applications
will likely be due sometime in
April. Students will be selected by
early May, she said.
