# Silicone implants may pose danger
## Stanford plastic surgery head contests proposed restrictions

Although the Food and Drug Admin
istration has questioned the safety of
silicone breast implants, the head of the
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery
Department in the Medical School says
the implant surgery should continue.
"A small but very vocal minority can
influence a decision against scientific
evidence, while the one million women
who were happy with the breast
implants were not heard from," said
Prof. Lars Vistnes.

In January, the FDA placed a mora
torium on silicone gel breast implants
because of increasing concern over their
possible harmful effects.
Roughly ten breast implants a month
were performed in the community and
at Stanford Hospital before the morato
rium on silicone gel implants, Vistnes
estimated. About half of these implants
were silicone gel and the other half were
saline implants.
In reconstruction, silicone gel
implants are preferred because they last
longer and are softer than saline

implants, explained Dr. Linda Waters,
assistant professor of Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgery.
The FDA has received complaints
from women who claim their silicone
implants have caused them to suffer
autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid
arthritis and lupus, in which the body
attacks its own tissues. Complications
can occur if the silicone gel leaks
through the sac into the body, or when
the entire implant ruptures.
In a well-publicized case, talk show
host Jenny Jones developed a hard ridge
between her breasts after her silicone
gel implant ruptured.
While the department as a whole per
forms about 80 percent of its implants
on women who have had breast cancer
surgery, most of Vistnes' patients seek
breast enlargement surgery for cosmet
ic reasons.
Right now, Vistnes said he is recom
mending saline implants to his patients
and is telling those who already have sil
icone implants to "wait and see what
the final outcome [of the FDA's deci
sion] will be."
Last month, an expert panel appointed
by the FDA advised that the use of silicone
breast implants be substantially
restricted. FDA commissioner David A.
Kessler is expected to act on the panel's
recommendation by the end of the month.
"Kessler is in a difficult position. A
lot of his decisions are going to be influ
enced by politics rather than science,"
Vistnes said.
Although there is not enough scien
tific evidence at present to link silicone
implants to disease, the FDA panel has
advised that the restrictions be used to
track women obtaining these implants
in order to study potential side effects.
The panel advised that eligibility for
silicone breast implants be restricted.
Women with serious breast deformities
and those needing reconstruction after
breast cancer surgery would be automat
ically eligible. However, those wanting
implants solely for breast enlargement
would have more difficulty qualifying.
The eligible women would then be
part of the testing process.
"The panel has been very restrictive
in its recommendation," said Vistnes.
"It's totally warranted to have additional
research and vigilance in these operations,
but to force every woman who wants to
have [silicone gel] breast implants
into study groups is very restrictive."
Most women, Vistnes explained,
don't want the public to know they are
getting breast implants. Clinical trials
force women to give up some of their
privacy and interfere in the doctor
patient relationship, he said.
Restricted access to silicone gel
implants, Vistnes said, could force many
women to turn to saline implants, the most
common alternative to silicon gel. Saline
implants are more prone to leakage, which
can be cosmetically "disastrous," he said.


Dr. Lars Vistnes, head of the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Department in
tho Medical School, holds a silicone breast Implant. He says an FDA expert
panel's recommendation to limit the silicone implants is too restrictive.
