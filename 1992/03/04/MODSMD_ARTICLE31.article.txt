## Earth's turning doesn't set vortex direction Science Bug

Q. Why does the earth rotate ? If the
% earth were to cease rotating, what
would happen to us? We have often heard
that in the Southern Hemisphere, water
will drain from a sink with the vortex
turning in the opposite direction from
that which we see in the Northern Hemi
sphere. So, would water go straight down
the drain if the earth stopped rotating?
Would toilets continue to flush properly ?

A. Before I answer your question,
• guys, allow me to share with the rest
of the readership the smug satisfaction I
feel at being asked for physics help by
engineering grad students. Either I'm
really smart or you're a few aces short of
a deck. Anyway, here goes.
The earth has been rotating for a long,
long time — since before it was the earth,
even. Our solar system evolved from a big
cloud of interstellar dust, which possessed
some intrinsic angular momentum. As
the dust accumulated into clumps, this
spin was conserved as the revolution of
planets around the sun and the rotation
of the planets about their axes.
Now, Dave and Stephen, I want you
guys to rev up your tiny mental engines
and think about what the earth's rota
tion means to you. Every day, you travel
in a BIG circle — roughly 25,000 miles
around if you're at Stanford— which
means that at any moment you and your
pocket protectors have a velocity of 800
miles per hour tangent to the earth's
surface. Fortunately, gravity, which
always pulls perpendicular to the earth's
surface, is constantly correcting the
direction of your velocity such that you
stay a constant distance from the center
of the planet.
If the earth were to suddenly cease
rotating, you would still have an instan
taneous tangential velocity of 800 miles
per hour, and gravity would still be
pulling at a right angle to your velocity.
You would still be wanting to move in a
circle. Unfortunately, the ground
beneath your Hush Puppies would not,
and you would find yourself moving hor
izontally at 800 miles per hour.
Consequently, you'd find yourself
travelling a goodly distance without any
time to pack. After you hit the road
(smack!) you'd make it about eight miles
before whatever was left of you skidded
to a halt. This calculation disregards any
energy-draining events like punching
through the walls of a building — assum
ing, of course, that any buildings could
withstand the immense sheer forces
associated with the sudden halt.
In short, everyone would be dead, and
no one would be around to find out

whether sinks still drained and toilets
still flushed — making the rest of your
question irrelevant. Hard worker that I
am, however, I came up with an answer
anyway:
To put it as gently as possible, the
assertion that water vortexes turn in dif
ferent directions in the two hemispheres
is dead wrong.
This lovely bit of folk wisdom is an
erroneous extension of a well-document
ed phenomenon called the Coriolis effect.
The Coriolis effect arises due to the
interaction of the earth's rotation with
the motion of large bodies of fluid (liq
uids or gases) over its surface, and it does
explain why hurricanes turn clockwise in
the Southern Hemisphere and counter
clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere.
When it comes to the scale of a bath
room sink, however, Coriolis forces are
negligible. Water does indeed vortex as it
drains from a sink or bathtub, but the
direction of rotation depends almost
entirely on the shape of the drain and the
initial swirl of the water. Since these fac
tors would still be present if the world
stopped turning, they would continue to
govern the unpredictable vortex direc
tion of draining water.
Toilet flushes do not depend on such
subtle factors for the whirling action
Stephen and Dave seem to know so inti
mately. (Perhaps one too many
"swirlies" when they were kids?)
Instead, the vortex direction during a
flush is imparted by the slant of the noz
zles hidden under the rim.
If you don't believe me, take a look.

If the earth were to suddenly cease
rotating, you would still have an instan
taneous tangential velocity of 800 miles
per hour, and gravity would still be
pulling at a right angle to your velocity.
You would still be wanting to move in a
circle. Unfortunately, the ground
beneath your Hush Puppies would not,
and you would find yourself moving hor
izontally at 800 miles per hour.
Consequently, you'd find yourself
travelling a goodly distance without any
time to pack. After you hit the road
(smack!) you'd make it about eight miles
before whatever was left of you skidded
to a halt. This calculation disregards any
energy-draining events like punching
through the walls of a building — assum
ing, of course, that any buildings could
withstand the immense sheer forces
associated with the sudden halt.
In short, everyone would be dead, and
no one would be around to find out

whether sinks still drained and toilets
still flushed — making the rest of your
question irrelevant. Hard worker that I
am, however, I came up with an answer
anyway:
To put it as gently as possible, the
assertion that water vortexes turn in dif
ferent directions in the two hemispheres
is dead wrong.
This lovely bit of folk wisdom is an
erroneous extension of a well-document
ed phenomenon called the Coriolis effect.
The Coriolis effect arises due to the
interaction of the earth's rotation with
the motion of large bodies of fluid (liq
uids or gases) over its surface, and it does
explain why hurricanes turn clockwise in
the Southern Hemisphere and counter
clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere.
When it comes to the scale of a bath
room sink, however, Coriolis forces are
negligible. Water does indeed vortex as it
drains from a sink or bathtub, but the
direction of rotation depends almost
entirely on the shape of the drain and the
initial swirl of the water. Since these fac
tors would still be present if the world
stopped turning, they would continue to
govern the unpredictable vortex direc
tion of draining water.
Toilet flushes do not depend on such
subtle factors for the whirling action
Stephen and Dave seem to know so inti
mately. (Perhaps one too many
"swirlies" when they were kids?)
Instead, the vortex direction during a
flush is imparted by the slant of the noz
zles hidden under the rim.
If you don't believe me, take a look.
