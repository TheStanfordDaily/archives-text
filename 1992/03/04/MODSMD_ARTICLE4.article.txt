# Hospital nurses threaten strike if negotiations break down
## 
### Julia Sobrevilla Editorial staff 
Nurses at Stanford Hospital
are threatening to strike if their
union makes no significant
progress in bargaining with hospi
tal authorities.
The 1,026-member union
passed a strike vote Monday that
"essentially authorized a strike,"
said Sue Weinstein, president of
the Committee for Recognition of
Nursing Achievement. Seventy

eight percent of the union's mem
bers voted for the proposal.
Before a strike can take place,
federal law requires the union to
give a 10-day advance notice.
Union leaders have members'
authorization to file the strike
notice, although they have not
done so yet.
The union did file a strike
notice two years ago, the last time
the contract between the hospital
and the union expired. An agree
ment was reached four days

before the deadline, however. "We
were much closer to a strike last
time," said union spokesperson-
Donalda Dunnett.
In the current negotiations,
she said, the union didn't want
to file notice as long as talks
continue with hospital negotia
tors. "Basically, what we're
doing is evaluating the need for
a strike notice on a daily basis,"
she said. "We'll just have to play
it by ear."
But she said if no major agree

ments are reached soon, the
union "will come to a decision
sometime within next week."
A team of union members will
negotiate with a hospital team led
by Senior University Counsel
Michael Vartain. The teams have
been negotiating for the past
eight weeks. The union's two-year
contract expired at midnight last
Saturday.
Vartain said "it is especially
important that [the union] act
quickly in concert with the hospi

tal to expedite progress in the
negotiations."
Vartain said the union's pay
and benefits proposal is "the
greatest obstacle to a settlement."
The union, he said, is asking for
hikes in pay and benefits that
would increase the hospital's
expenditures in that area by
about 25 percent over a two-year
period.
"These increases would be dra
matically out of line with the cost
of most hospital settlements," he

said. The union's members con
stitute about 50 percent of the
hospital workforce.
Union leaders, however, say
money is not the main issue in the
discussions. "Maybe economics is
the big sticking point for Mr. Var
tain, but the nurses' main con
cern is working conditions,"
Weinstein said.
Dunnett said nurses are over
burdened with too many patients,
especially since last March, when
budget cuts at the hospital began
to take their toll.
Nurses are now responsible for
six to eight patients, while some
years ago they were only responsi

ble for three or four, Dunnett said.
"Floating" — when nurses are
asked to work on floors they don't
normally work on — is another
issue, according to Dunnett.
For example, she said a neuro
surgery nurse might be sent to an
oncology floor, which cares for
cancer patients. A nurse in that
situation must "watch for side
effects of drugs she isn't familiar

with," Dunnet
said, adding that
the problem has
been an issue for
the past few
years.
Overall, Dun
nett said she is
optimistic about
the outcome. "It
seems to me

there should be some common
ground" in the negotiations, she
said.
In past years, the union has
filed a strike notice before taking
the vote, but union leaders want
ed a "feel from the membership
about working conditions," Dun
nett said. "We needed to know
from the membership if they
wanted to file a strike notice."
