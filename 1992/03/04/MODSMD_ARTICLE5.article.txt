# Tradeoffs are part of plan to add CIV tracks
## 
### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
If a proposal to begin four new Cultures, Ideas and
Values tracks in the next two years is approved, it will
mean a heavier teaching load for faculty in the
departments sponsoring them and, in some cases,
fewer classes for majors.
But faculty involved with the CIV proposals say the
decision to implement them will be better than the
alternative — cutting their own departments' budgets.
"We've been squeezed and we have to do more,"
said Drama Asst. Prof. Rush Rehm. "But I think this
change is right on the money. We are offering a
bloody good CIV track and I hope people realize that."
The departments' CIV proposals were motivated
by the budget cuts they face.
Because faculty members will be teaching the new
tracks, the University can cut lecturers in other CIV
tracks, saving about $40,000 in salary and benefits for
each lecturer they eliminate. The departments, in turn,
will get credit toward their own budget reduction targets.
Three of the tracks — proposed
separately by the Drama, German
Studies, and French and Italian
departments — would begin next
year. The fourth, proposed by the
Comparative Literature and His
tory of Science departments,
would begin in 1993-94.
The tracks were recommended
by a subcommittee of the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies.
The full committee will make the
final decision on the CIV tracks at
an undecided future date.
Ronald Davies, a Drama
Department administrator, said
he feels that using faculty mem
bers to teach the department's
"Performance and Culture" track
will not have a major impact, out
side of increased teaching loads.
"If anything, it will strengthen
it," Davies said. "Surely, ffaculty!
will be teaching and working a lot
harder, but they will have the
help of many of the other mem
bers of the department."
If the new CIV tracks are

approved, Rehm will teach the fall
quarter track, Drama Asst. Prof.
Alice Rayner will teach in the win
ter and Drama Assoc. Prof. Harry
Elam will teach in the spring.
"All of these teachers have a
very heavy work load, and some of
them are even involved in direct
ing plays for the department,"
Davies said. "With other depart
ment members helping them
along, however, they will do well."
Rehm said he is excited about
the new program. "This whole
change is really to the depart
ment's advantage," he said. "There
is a lot of teaching that we will have
to do with the new tracks, but at
this point, we have to do it."
Davies said he sees the new
track as an opportunity to prove
the department's quality in a year
in which the department was con
sidered for elimination and even
tually had its budget reduced 30
percent.
"Our department wants to be
seen in a more broad light, not
just as an arts and language facil
ity," Davies said, adding that the
department is "trying desperately
to get involved in undergraduate
education."

'There is a lot of teach
ing that we will have to
do with the new
tracks, but at this
point, we have to do it.'

Rehm agreed, saying, "Our
department has been under so
much scrutiny, which I do not
understand or support, that this
change will be very good for us."
The German Studies depart
ment, which proposed "Myth and
Modernity" to begin next year,
will "have to cut back on the
teaching that we normally do,"
said German Prof. Ted Anders
son, who will teach the fall seg
ment of the new CIV track if it is
approved.
Andersson said the depart
ment "universally agreed on this
proposal and we are standing
behind it."
The cutback on teachers will
not damage the department, he
said.
"We are sacrificing the courses

with low enrollment which proba
bly shouldn't be taught anyway,"
he said. "More advanced courses
will be substituted for more basic
classes."
German Prof. Russell Berman
will teach the course in winter
and German Profs. Orrin Robin
son and Patricia Mueller-Vollmer
will teach in the spring.
"We are a small department,"
Andersson said. "All the sections
will be taught by the regular
department."
Michael Wyatt, a graduate
student who helped draft the
French and Italian department's
proposal for "Science, Literature
and the Imagination," said the
changes in that department will
be "nothing but positive."
"Our department is very small;
therefore the track will be taught
entirely by [French Prof.] John
Freccero, a wonderful and excit
ing lecturer," he said. "After the
first year, however, we will be able
to expand and include more and
more people."
He said he hopes the change
"will increase the visibility of the
department and demonstrate
what is available to students."
