# Tradeoffs are part of plan to add CIV tracks

If a proposal to begin four new Cultures, Ideas and
Values tracks in the next two years is approved, it will
mean a heavier teaching load for faculty in the
departments sponsoring them and, in some cases,
fewer classes for majors.
But faculty involved with the CIV proposals say the
decision to implement them will be better than the
alternative â€” cutting their own departments' budgets.
"We've been squeezed and we have to do more,"
said Drama Asst. Prof. Rush Rehm. "But I think this
change is right on the money. We are offering a
bloody good CIV track and I hope people realize that."
The departments' CIV proposals were motivated
by the budget cuts they face.
Because faculty members will be teaching the new
tracks, the University can cut lecturers in other CIV
tracks, saving about $40,000 in salary and benefits for
each lecturer they eliminate. The departments, in turn,
will get credit toward their own budget reduction targets.
