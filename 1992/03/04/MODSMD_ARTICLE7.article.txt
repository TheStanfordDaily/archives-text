Four Council of Presidents slates and 60 would-be
ASSU senators have filed to run in the upcoming ASSU
election, according to Hearings Officer Jason Moore.
Moore said the number of candidates is still
unofficial, but as of yesterday's filing deadline 43
undergraduates and 17 graduate students had reg
istered to run for senate seats.
Ten voting and 10 non-voting senate positions
are available for undergraduates, and graduates
have the same number of seats.
Also, four students have announced their candi
dacy for seats on the Student Conduct Legislative
Council. One slate has filed to run for senior class
president, Moore said.
The Hammer and Coffin and Students First parties
will each back a COP slate. In addition, two indepen
dent slates have announced that they intend to run.
The Hammer and Coffin party endorsed the YOU!
slate, which will run on a "randomocracy" system,
according to Party Chair David Hyatt.
