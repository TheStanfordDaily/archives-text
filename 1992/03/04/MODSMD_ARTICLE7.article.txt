# Four slates file to run for COP
## Petitions still need review 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Four Council of Presidents slates and 60 would-be
ASSU senators have filed to run in the upcoming ASSU
election, according to Hearings Officer Jason Moore.
Moore said the number of candidates is still
unofficial, but as of yesterday's filing deadline 43
undergraduates and 17 graduate students had reg
istered to run for senate seats.
Ten voting and 10 non-voting senate positions
are available for undergraduates, and graduates
have the same number of seats.
Also, four students have announced their candi
dacy for seats on the Student Conduct Legislative
Council. One slate has filed to run for senior class
president, Moore said.
The Hammer and Coffin and Students First parties
will each back a COP slate. In addition, two indepen
dent slates have announced that they intend to run.
The Hammer and Coffin party endorsed the YOU!
slate, which will run on a "randomocracy" system,
according to Party Chair David Hyatt.
Under a randomocracy system,
Hyatt said slate members will
leave the slate "as soon as some
one gets decapitated, debilitated
or accidentally graduates." The
remaining spot on the COP slate
will then be filled by a student
selected at random, Hyatt said.
"So many people wanted to get
on our slate, we figured this was
the best way to accommodate
them all," he added.
Currently, the slate consists of
sophomore Tony Sirna, junior
Srinivas Kumar and seniors Hyatt
and Chris McKenna. All four slate

members are on the staff of the
Chapparal, the campus humor
magazine connected with the
Hammer and Coffin Party.
Hyatt claimed that the current
four slate members were chosen
at random out of the phone book,
and only coincidentally happened
to work for the Chapparal.
Candidates for COP running
with Students First are sopho
more John Hall, juniors Preeti
Malladi and Joel Stein and senior
Glyn Milburn. Hall is Students
First Party chair. Malladi is a
member of Sanskriti, a campus
Indian organization. Stein is a
former Daily columnist, and Mil
burn is a running back on the
Stanford football team.
One independent slate running

for the COP is Independents: A
New Era, with members Ron
Brown, Jason Snyder, Delia Lopez
and Sherri Wolson.
Brown and Snyder, both sopho
mores, are currently undergradu
ate senators. Lopez, a sophomore,
is program coordinator for El Cen
tro Chicano, and Wolson, a junior,
is chair of Stanford in Government.
Brown said the slate wants "to
bring student government back to
the students."
"We'd like to bring our experi
ence with leadership to the COP,"
Brown said.
The second independent slate,
I Prefer Not To Have A COP, is
composed of junior Blake Ilstrup
and seniors Ed Mun, Ted Lai and
Paul Kwon.

Mun is currently an ASSU sen
ator. Ilstrup is a resident assis
tant in Burbank, and Kwon is an
RAin Toyon. Lai is head academ
ic adviser in Burbank.
Ilstrup said the slate is "in
favor of trimming the fat in stu
dent government." He said the
slate believes the COP is a largely
unnecessary body, and added
that, if elected, the slate would
"try and get rid of [the COP] from
the inside out."
As of yesterday, Moore said 10
undergraduate and two graduate
senate candidates are running
with People's Platform. Eight
undergraduates and seven gradu
ate students are running for sen
ate with Students First, he said,
and four undergraduates are run
ning with Hammer and Coffin.
In addition, Moore said 21 under
graduates and six graduate students
are listed as independent candidates
for the senate. Two graduate senate
candidates have asked that their
affiliation be left blank.

The candidates will not be offi
cially approved until their peti
tions, turned in yesterday, have
been reviewed. Moore said he
could not release the candidate's
names until the petitions have
been checked, which will probably
be done by March 13.
According to People's Platform
member Russell Calleros, the 10
undergraduates are Allyson Dick
son, Paula Dybdahl, Luz Herrera,
Tyler Kim, Gabriel Lucas, Robert
Milk, Anoop Prakas'ii, Virginia

Rosas, Stacey Strong and Tony
Wagner. People's Platform gradu
ate senate candidates are Colin
Hampson and Derek Miyahara.
According to Hyatt, Hammer
and Coffin will run five candi
dates for undergraduate senate.
The candidates are Peter Cousins,
Andy Collins, James Barrese,
James Frary and Srinivas Kumar.
Hammer and Coffin is also
running Stanford football coach
Bill Walsh for an SCLC seat,
Hyatt said.
