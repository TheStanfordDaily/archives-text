# Kennedy: Endowment is key to stability
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The strength of Stanford's endowment will
allow it to overcome current and future financial
challenges, University President Donald Kennedy
said yesterday.
"The endowment has performed very well over
the last 20 years, and we should be able to take
some hits without damaging the quality of the
institution," Kennedy said in an interview.
He pointed to the "record performance" of
Stanford's investments, increased donations and
the "conservative and future-oriented" methods
of financing physical improvements.
"The result is that we have developed a Firm and
solid basis with which to deal with short to medium
range financial downturns," Kennedy said.
Three weeks ago at a Faculty Senate meeting,
Kennedy warned that the University might face
significant budget shortfalls above and beyond
the current $43-million deficit.
In yesterday's interview, he declined to specu
late on what the future deficit might be because of
the "volatility of estimates."
"The numbers are sufficiently jumpy that we
do not want to be more specific," Kennedy said.
"The real clarification is going to arrive when we
get the results of our major costs studies .. . and
when real progress is made with negotiating the
1992 (indirect-cost) rate."
All of the studies except for libraries will likely be
completed by May, Kennedy said. "Even without the
library study, we should be able to justify substantial
increases in indirect-cost recovery," he added.

Kennedy said his two biggest budget concerns
are the "failure of the government to accept cost
studies and make progress with us toward negoti
ating a cost rate" as well as the "insistence" of the
Defense Contract Audit Agency to "audit the years
of 1981 to 1988 while disregarding the memoran
da of understanding."
Of less concern is the future of tuition remis
sion, which he said he does "not believe is in
immediate jeopardy."
If the policy of reimbursing the University for
the tuition of graduate students involved in gov
ernment-sponsored research through the staff
benefits pool is ended, Kennedy said it will likely
be phased out over a long period, such as five
years. The decision on that may come as early as
August, he said.
If the University does face new deficits in the
next two years, Kennedy said the Board of
Trustees has committed to avoiding future cuts.
"I can't speak for what the Board might do
down the road ... but Ido not anticipate any
future cuts," he said. "I feel quite a lot of confi
dence in that."
With Kennedy leaving in August, some may
question whether he is simply leaving the next
president with a host of problems.
The answer, according to Kennedy, is no.
He said phase two — the examination of how
the University is structured — has put in place
"the best way to generate choices" for the next
administration.
"It won't be I who makes these recommenda
tions" as to how the University should be orga
nized, Kennedy said.
