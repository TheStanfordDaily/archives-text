Who Says Opportunity Knocks Only Once?
Certainly not Stanford Federal Credit
If you received a bank or dealership new car loan within the last two
years and you don't like the interest rate you are paying, we might be
able to help you.
Whether you are looking to buy a New Vehicle or have recently
bought one, Stanford Federal Credit Union can save you some
money. Our current interest rates on New Vehicle Loans are the
lowest in our Credit Union's history.
If you have a 1991 or 1992 car, van, or truck, and have fewer than
24,000 miles on your odometer, we'll refinance your vehicle as if it
were new (on approved credit and inspection of the vehicle).
March Interest Rates for New Vehicle Loans:
8.5% Fixed or 8% Variable, 36 months
8.75% Fixed or 8.25% Variable, 48 months
8.9% Fixed or 8.5% Variable, 60 months
Borrowers who select the automatic transfer method to repay their
loans receive an additional I A% off these rates.
