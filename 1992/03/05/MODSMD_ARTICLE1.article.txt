# Four years' housing for class of '96
## 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
The University has approved four years of guar
anteed housing for next year's freshmen, officials
said yesterday.
"It's really a dream that is finally coming true,"
said Director of Residential Education Alice Supton.
The decision is contingent on the construction of
new residences to replace the three earthquake
damaged houses on San Juan Hill, Supton said.
Although she cautioned that "there are still
many things up in the air about it," Supton said the
University has "a commitment" to build the hill
house replacements.
The Board of Trustees must first approve the new
residences, but Supton said their approval is very like
ly and construction would begin shortly thereafter.
The new residences would open in 1994, she said.
University officials had been hedging on a guar
anteed housing pledge as they debated whether to
reduce the number of students living in the over
crowded Manzanita trailers instead.
Under the new plan, the trailers will be occupied
entirely by graduate students.
"In general, Manzanita works better as a gradu
ate residence where each resident can have his or
her own bedroom," Supton said, adding that there
will be three graduate students in each trailer.
Manzanita II — the tentatively named under
graduate dormitory currently under construction —
will open this fall, adding 204 spaces to next year's
undergraduate pool.
But even with the new dormitory, the University
will still be short on housing by about 125 spaces,
the number lost when the hill houses were closed
after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
The new residences — which would probably be
located on the Knoll, the area
behind Florence Moore Hall —
will replace those spaces, allowing
the University to guarantee hous
ing for incoming freshmen.
Guaranteed housing will not be
applied retroactively to current stu
dents, Supton said. "It only applies
to the class entering next year and
subsequent classes," she said.
Georges said a system similar
to the current one, which allows
students to have a chance at bet
ter housing in two out of their
three years, will be maintained
for incoming freshmen and subse
quent classes.
He said the system would prob
ably set up "one or two years of
preferred housing," in which stu
dents draw from a better pool
than they do in other years. But
they would be guaranteed on
campus housing even during
their unpreferred years.
Although current undergradu
ates would participate in the same
housing draw as future students,
the current students would still
be required to have one year of
unguaranteed housing, Georges
said.
But he added that the opening
of Manzanita II will help relieve
current students' housing bur
den.
"Even though technically [cur
rent students] wouldn't be guar
anteed, they still would be" effec
tively guaranteed housing if the
hill house replacements open as
planned, Georges said.
Dean of Admissions Jim Mon
toya said he had received a memo
from Residential Education about
the guaranteed housing decision.
He said that in conversations
with prospective freshmen this
year, the Admissions Office has

"indicated to them that we had
evexy hope" that they would receive
four years of guaranteed housing.
He said residential life is an
"important factor" in convincing
students to attend, and the four
year guarantee will make
prospective freshmen more likely
to choose Stanford.
The Housing Operations Advi
sory Committee is currently gath
ering information to make a pro
posal for the new residences to
the Trustees by the summer,
Georges said.
The committee is currently
surveying 1,000 students by tele
phone to fmd out what kind of
housing they prefer.
"We want to answer a variety
of questions," Georges said. "We
want to know what [students]
like and dislike about their cur
rent residences."
He said the results of the sur
vey "will form part of the deci
sion" on the design of the new
residences.
According to Supton, Universi
ty officials have not yet deter
mined how they will finance the
new residences. She said that
although outside gifts "would be
welcome," the University will
assume that it will have to fund
the residences on its own.
Since the closure of the dam
aged hill houses displaced many
students, the Manzanita trailers
have been occupied by a large
number of undergraduates.
One factor in the decision to
move graduate students into the
trailers was to accommodate the
200 additional graduate students
the University will admit next
year, Georges said.
He said switching the trailers
to graduate housing will open up
90 additional spaces for single
graduate students.
