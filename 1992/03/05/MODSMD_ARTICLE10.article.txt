# 'The green guys are really intelligent'
## Computer whiz designs his own video games 
### Michelle Duran Staff writer 
In 1983, while most 16-year-olds were playing
video games, Will Harvey was already designing his
first one.
By the time he entered Stanford as a freshman,
Harvey, now a graduate student, had written Musi
cal Construction Set, the first widely available musi
cal editor program.
In high school he taught himself assembly lan
guage and wrote some simple games that he says
were as good as other video games in those days.
Today, he says, computer technology has reached
such advanced levels that only a professional ani
mator or musician could write games up to the
industry's standards.
The summer after his freshman year, he started

a video game company in Palo Alto. The company,
Sand Castle, employs several Stanford students and
industry professionals.
It designs and writes video games for sale to com
puter game companies, including Nintendo and
Sega. Its latest creation is The Immortal, an adven
ture game with a moral.
Harvey said that while the underlying theme in
most video games is "just shoot as many bad guys as
you can and get a lot of points," The Immortal
"rewards making rational sympathetic decisions,
and this is unique."
"For example, there are green guys in this game,"
Harvey said. "You can go through the game trying
to shoot them, but later on you find out that the
green guys are really intelligent creatures. It turns
out that you have to cooperate with them in order to
win the game."

Sand Castle has created five titles. Three of them
have won gold and platinum disks, which are award
ed for sales of 100,000 and 250,000 million copies,
respectively.
Musical Construction Set went platinum, while
Zany Golf, one of the gold disks, is a miniature golf
game on an obstacle course with castle and windmill
pitfalls. The Immortal has gone gold and is expected
to reach platinum soon, Harvey said.
Harvey said he is "taking it easy on being the
president of the company ... so that I can just be a
graduate student." At Stanford he is studying Arti
ficial Intelligence and teaching Computer Science
110, Introduction to Computer Systems.
Harvey said CS 110 was anything but exciting in
past years, when students were given small comput
er assignments. But this quarter, Harvey combined
his video game experience with the curriculum in
order to make the class more fun.
One of the class projects this quarter was to
design a program for an intelligent robot that could
"find out where the walls are, conquer territory,
shoot other robots and avoid being shot yourself,"
Harvey said.
Last week the four best programs in the class
competed in the "Robot War Superbowl."
During halftime; the students with "cheating
robots" played each other. Some would confuse
their opponents or make them wreck their guns.
"One of the cleverest robots figured out how to
change the walls and enclose all the other robots so
they had nowhere to go," Harvey said.
Harvey worked with students on their programs
at Tresidder until 2 a.m. some nights. "It was a lot
of work, but it didn't matter because it was really
interesting," said Chris Hondl, the student who won
the robot contest.
Harvey said his long-term goal "is to create a new
medium of interactive movies where you can inter
act with the characters or the aliens."
The two major challenges confronting him and
other researchers, Harvey explained, are the lack of
a computer technology fast enough to react and ani
mate the game and the problem of making an ani
mation appear intelligent enough to interact with
people.
The speed will be available in a decade, he said,
"to fly the X-Wing fighter or combat Darth Vader"
in Star Wars. But the technology necessary to inter
act with characters is much more complicated, Har
vey said, because it "requires that we understand
something about what intelligence is."
Harvey said he is studying artificial intelligence
in order to "understand how much you have to con
strain your interaction with something in order for
it to appear to be intelligent."

Graduate student Will Harvey has designed a video game that teaches a lesson. "You can go through
the game trying to shoot" the green figures, he says, "but... it turns out that you have to cooperate
with them in order to win the game."
