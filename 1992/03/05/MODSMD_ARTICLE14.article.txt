Supreme Court decision
on sex harassment suits
encourages prosecution

Last week's supreme
Court ruling on a student's
right to seek damages in sex
ual harassment suits is a bold step
forward.
The 9-0 decision is based on the
Title IV section of the 1972 educa
tion law passed by Congress,
which bans sexual discrimination
in any education program or activ
ity receiving federal financial assis
tance.
Responsibility is placed rightful
ly on the schools for disciplining
employees who abuse positions of
authority by taking advantage of
students.
Sexual harassment cases are
typically the most difficult to try
since boundaries between what is
and is not lawful are hazy and
there are usually no witnesses.
Because of this, as well as the gen
eral tendency of society to down
play the seriousness of such cases,
many victims are afraid to con
front the issue by filing charges.
At a university, students are
invariably in awe of their teachers
and professors. They may be
intimidated by those who have
control over their grades and their
career prospects. This new ruling
provides a greater incentive for
students to pursue a suit if they
have been harassed.
Schools and universities that
use public funds must face this lia
bility with clear proposals and poli
cies. Now, the government can
withdraw federal funds from
schools found guilty of not ade
quately addressing a victim's com
plaint of sexual harassment.
Under the existing legal frame
work, employees are able to file
suit for sexual harassment and
win compensation for damages.
The Supreme Court's decision
extends this right to students.

Before the Court made its deci
sion, the Bush Administration
argued against allowing monetary
damages to be awarded in students'
harassment suits. The Administra
tion said that under Title IY stu
dents could file only suits for back
pay or to get an injunction against
the unlawful behavior.
Unfortunately, such measures
were inadequate because most stu
dents would graduate before the
injunction could be granted. Back
pay is not relevant for students
who are not employed by the
school. The new ruling corresponds
more closely to student needs.
Here at Stanford, administrators
are making efforts to deal with the
issue of sexual harassment. There
is a University committee, now in
the process of revising the sexual
assault and harassment policies, set
up to ensure Stanford's continued
commitment to the issue.
These efforts should be applaud
ed and encouraged. The University
needs to develop a clear and com
prehensive policy. By doing so, per
petrators can be appropriately dis
ciplined without the victim's hav
ing to face the trauma that often
comes with a court case.
Some at Stanford fear that as a
result of the decision the number
of false accusations will rise.
Although such a fear is valid, it is
unlikely that any increase would
present a major problem.
As lawyers and legal experts will
attest, sexual harassment, assault
and rape cases are extremely diffi
cult to win. In the past, this has
been reason enough to discourage
complaints. A significant propor
tion of these crimes go unreported
every year. These realities will not
change with one Supreme Court
decision.
Although this decision won't
solve the many problems associat
ed with sexual harassment, it is an
important move toward encourag
ing women to step forward with
their stories. The ruling re-empha
sizes the validity of their claims by
providing them with another
channel for seeking justice.
