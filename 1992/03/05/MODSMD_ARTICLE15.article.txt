A PHRASE CAME TO MIND while
reading Alexander Rawls' letter
Monday. It is a phrase I have
heard women use. A phrase I never
thought I would use, because I am a
man. But, men just don't get it.
Rawls has a very narrow view of what
constitutes rape. To him, rape occurs
when "she says no and he forces himself
on her." It does not include instances were
the woman is unable to say "NO." In that
case, according to Rawls, it is "something
that is a relatively insignificant violation,
when it is properly punishable at all."
The very same law in which he pur
ports to be an expert, covers at least
some instances in which the victim need
not say no.
Rape occurs when the victim cannot
legally consent because she is underage.

Rape also occurs "where a person sub
mits under the belief that the person
committing the act is the victim's
spouse," and where the victim submits
because she experiences menace or
duress and feels an implied threat of
something bad happening to her if she
does not submit. It is the victim's per
ception of the situation that counts here.
The only time rape does not occur is
when the parties consent. Consent is
defined by the law as positive coopera
tion in act or attitude when the parties
have knowledge of the nature of the act.
This surely brings the legal definition
of rape much closer to that in the Stan
ford Rape Education Project pamphlet
than Rawls believes it to be, if not in line
with it. And the definition of rape is ever
changing, with less and less force or

threat being required.
Will this cause an increase in the
number of false claims of rape? Probably
not. Rape is still very much something
that men do to women.
Even in the rare instances where a
woman rapes a man, the results are the
same. The victim is not believed. The
victim is raped all over again in the
court room.
Just look at what happened in the
Tyson case, a case where the jury con
cluded that he was guilty. There are still
many people out there who believe him
to be innocent.
We all know of one case where the
perpetrator pleaded guilty and walked
out of the courtroom with nothing more
serious than a slap on the hand.
Maybe that popular slogan of the Roe

vs. Wade days was right — "Abortion
would be a sacrament if men could get
pregnant." Rape would be a death penal
ty offense if men were raped at the rates
women are raped.
A point worth keeping in mind is that
men have a well earned reputation for
violence against women. It is a reputa
tion reinforced by the media and evi
denced by the statistics for violent
crime. It is primarily men who do the
battering and the killing. It is primarily
women who get battered and are killed.
Just watch television for a day or two, or
even a few of the popular action films,
and you will see this is true.
Sexual coercion IS rape. Even if men
would prefer not to believe it.
