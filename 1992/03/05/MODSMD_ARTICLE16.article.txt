# Indigenous peoples are ecological model for all
## 
### 
As a Peruvian, I read the article
"Ancient Peruvians lived within means"
(Daily, Feb. 26) with genuine interest.
Anthropologist John Rick's findings
are most interesting but what he fails
to understand is that the indigenous
people of the Andes have a totally dif
ferent approach to life than people in
the West.
Many think the agrarian reform that
took place in my country in the late '60s
failed due to the lack of productivity
shown by the indigenous peasants.
What actually happened is that they
were content with growing only what
they needed in order to survive, rejecting
trade and becoming rich and powerful.
In this sense, the indigenous people of
the Andes set an ecological example for
modern society.
