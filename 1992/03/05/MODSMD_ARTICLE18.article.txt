The pernicious notion that whites
have no race or culture has allowed many
to escape any soul-searching about ways
they have been shaped by their own race
and culture. In fact, it's difficult to have
very comprehensive discussions about
race with a lot of white people because
they are uncomfortable acknowledging
the simple fact that they are white.
I've begun to wonder if Stanford needs
an organization for white students. Not
quite a White Student Union, but rather
a discussion group where progressive
white students could begin thinking
about their role here in our multicultural
Disneyland. I envision an organization
dedicated to channelling issues of white
student identity from frustration into
positive action.
It's hard to think of such an organiza
tion without white robes and burning
crosses coming to mind, considering the
history of this country and white
supremacy around the world. Neverthe
less, we need to move forward, if cau
tiously, in our multicultural experiment.
Multiculturalism at Stanford has
tended to focus almost exclusively on the
stories of people of color — which makes
sense given the tremendous historical

trivialization of non-white peoples. I sus
pect, however, that part of the reason for
the resentment some white people feel is
that their voice is not included in this
framework. Everyone who comes to
Stanford has a particular story and is the
product of a set of experiences uniquely
their own — even white people.
Through my own introspective explo
ration I have come to see how all of us
who grow up in America are infected with
the illness of racial animus. All of our
minds are packed thick with racial myths
and nightmares. No one is immune — I
have spent too many years trying to
cleanse my soul of the racism that haunts
me to believe that I will never be totally
free. For the rest of my life, I will be a
recovering racist.
And like a recovering alcoholic, I have
moved past the state of denial. It's crucial
for us all to recognize how profoundly the
dominant culture in America forms our
thoughts and views — especially around
race. Moreover, it is essential that all of
us — not just people of color — spend a
lot of time wrestling with, thinking about
and discussing how race and culture
affect us.
Now that I am more attuned to black
ness, I am beginning to see whiteness as
well. Spotting blackness in this country is
easy: it is focused, visible and different.
Whiteness, in contrast, is like air; it's
everywhere yet no one can see it.

White
culture
is like
air; it's
everywhere
yet no one
can see it.

As Cathy Thomas, a white female
writer, defined it: "Whiteness: a privilege
enjoyed but not acknowledged, a reality
lived in but unknown." In order for white
people in this country to grow beyond
their contemporary strains of bias and
bigotry they must also see whiteness. Not
whiteness just as skin color, but white
ness as culture, history and politics.
Whiteness as the experiences and privi
leges that fairer people have in this soci
ety.
To be perfectly honest, I'm not entire
ly comfortable with the idea of a white
student organization. I'm not sure how
effective such a group could be. Perhaps
people have to step outside of main
stream white society to genuinely be able
to see it. If this is so, then the burden of
educating people about race and culture
will ultimately always fall on the periph
eral people of color. Either way, it is cru
cial for all of us, WSU or not, to think
about the impact of race on each of our
lives, not just the lives of others.
