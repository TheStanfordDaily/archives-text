## Williams: shooter's headache 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Some games he is superman,
others the invisible man. Sopho
more forward Brent Williams is a
super-hero searching for a perma
nent role.
Williams can fly over flat-foot
ed defenders in a single bound and
slam over the most nefarious bas
ketball villains on the planet. But
Stanford's future man of steel is
sometimes a man of stealth.
The same hero who soared for 22
points at Oregon was a court jester
at Michigan State: one for eight
from the field with one rebound.
Two days after allowing UCLA
forward Tracy Murray to mug
Stanford for a career-high 36
points, he hauled USC guard
Harold Miner into the basketball
hall of justice. When covered by
Williams, Miner was a mortal
four for 24 from the field.
"The consistency, the little
things are what he needs to work
on. Brent's athletically able to
stick with many of the better ath
letes in the league," said coach
Mike Montgomery.
"He's had some major contri
butions as far as his offense.
Where he is right now, he tends to
do the spectacular — the great
rebounds, the dunks. He's not as
consistent with the everyday,
steady stuff," he said.
A slender 6-foot-6 slasher from
Tacoma, Wash., Williams has had
difficulty figuring out his role on
the team. Although he has the
tools to be a great scorer, Stan
ford's offense is focused on Ail-
American Adam Keefe.
"I'm still trying to work into a
role," said Williams, who is third
on the team in points (10.7 per
game ) and rebounds (4.5) and
has started all 24 games. "I'm a
player that the coaches expect a
lot out of, but it's hard to know
exactly which things I'm sup
posed to do at which times."
"They're pushing me in every
direction. Sometimes I know

there's a lot of things I can do; it's
just hard to know. I'm still not
totally comfortable," he said.
As the small forward, Williams
frequently matches up with the
best offensive player from the
other team, whether it's Miner,
Murray or Terrence Lewis of
Washington State. Tonight at
Arizona State he'll cover Jamal
Faulkner, last year's Pac-10
Freshman of the Year, and Satur
day Williams will take on Chris
Mills, Arizona's top scorer (16.3

points per game).
"I'm not especially worried.
They have to guard me too," said
the soft-spoken Williams. "I'm
going to do a good job on them
and we're going to win two."
With Keefe taking the inside
shots and Peter Dukes bombing
from outside, Williams frequently
disappears into the offense. After
scoring in double figures for eight
of the first 10 Pac-10 games, he

the season. Williams, a 6-foot-6 sophomore, has blossomed this
season into a solid defensive player, although the forward is still
searching for offensive consistency.
has been stuck in the single digits
for the past four.
"They want me to play defense
and rebound. Scoring takes third
priority right now," Williams
said. "Early in the season I was
focusing on my defense so much,
my offense suffered. My jumpshot

has kind of slumped off the past
few games, but everything else is
coming along pretty nicely."
The responsibility of covering
the opposition's best player has
clearly cut into Williams' offensive
production, but he has the poten
tial to be a great player on both
ends of the floor. He has shown
flashes of offensive mastery, with a
baseline drive and dunk against
UCLA and above-the-rim rebound
ing against Colorado.

With a season 45 percent field
goal percentage and a kryp
tonite—like 59 percent free
throw percentage mark, Williams
has yet to play to his offensive
potential on a consistent basis.
After scoring 20 points per game
as a prep at Curtis High School,
Williams red-shirted his freshman
year at Stanford. Last year he
started four games and averaged
four points a game in a reserve role.
Montgomery has been careful not
to raise expectations too early.
"Brent is a little bit fragile psy
chologically. He tends to take things
literally," Montgomery said. "We're
still trying to get him to understand
how good he can be without putting
a lot of pressure on him."
With Marcus Lollie, Dukes and
Kenny Hicks returning in the back
court, Williams will have to adjust
to a new role as a super-scorer.
"I look forward to it — I like
scoring," said Williams. "I just
have to wait my time."
