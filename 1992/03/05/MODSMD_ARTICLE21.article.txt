# Walsh looks beyond Stanford
## Says NCAA did 'excellent job' raising entrance standards 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
This is the second of a two-part
interview.
Daily: With Denny Green gone
and with Long Beach State
dropping football, there are
now no Division LA black head
coaches. Do you think this a
problem within the sport; do
you think the numbers will rise
in the future?
Walsh: Well,the numbers will
continue to rise, they will rise;
there isn't any question. I
think we are very late in get
ting minority coaches directly
involved with the sport, but
we'll have a strong representa
tion on our staff and I have had
experience developing minority
coaches — black coaches — in
my career, and many of them
have gone on to be head coach
es and otherwise, so I think
that program will be sustained
here. I'm hopeful that the next
time I go to a coaches associa
tion meeting that I will see
black coaches among the head
coaches in the country in repre
sentative numbers, and I think
there are many people striving
to develop.
Daily: Do you think that college
sports, and college football in
particular, has gotten out of
hand?
Walsh: No. I think it has gotten
under better control to be hon
est with you. I think the NCAA
has taken some very proper and
expedient and valid steps in
dealing with some of the ques
tionable tactics and some of the
questionable procedures and
behavioral patterns of certain
schools in the United States. I
think the NCAA has done an
excellent job of raising entrance
requirements and the student
athletes have responded around
the country; and in shortening
the recruiting cycle, which is
best for the student athlete and
everybody involved; and short
ening the practice limits, I
think that has been excellent.

Daily: As the football coach, how
can you bridge the gap between
the football team and the stu
dent body? How can you get the
students more behind the pro
gram and the team?
Walsh: That is just a matter of
over a period of time people
developing an appreciation for
what the student-athlete goes
through in the way of sacrifice
and commitment and dedica
tion, and appreciating that.
Stanford will never be a school
where the football player is an
idol, and that is a reason many
of these players are here. A
football player is simply
another member of the stu
dent body taking part in an
"extra-curricular" activity
that takes a lot of time and
sacrifice, and typically the
player thoroughly enjoys what
he is doing and gets great
gratification in playing the
game. (The players) thorough
ly appreciates the support
they get from the student
body.
Daily: They moved the student
section away from the 50-yard
line a few years back. Are you
in favor of moving it back?
Walsh: I am here for the stu
dents, and of course the criti
cal thing for me is to be
accepted by the undergradu
ates .... Student activities,
student involvement — meet
ings such as this — have first
priority, it's that simple. I
don't expect to answer to any
one but the students really, so
if it is in the student's interest
to return to where they were,
I think they should work
toward attaining that. I'm not
sure it's in my hand, but I do
know that my existence is
basically related to the stu
dents and no others.
Daily: Some people from other
top academic schools say that
Stanford puts too much
emphasis on football. Do you
think that Stanford as an aca
demic institution puts too
much emphasis on its sports?

Walsh: Oh no. I think we have
great balance here. You see,
we have a dimension that
many of the Ivy League
schools don't have and that is
a common bond among the
students. Athletics can be a
bonding factor for the student
body that no other activity
can because it can work for
community .... By degree
some are excited about it and
some are indifferent to it. You
run the full breadth of a scale
as to how much interest a
given student has, but they
know one thing: the athletes
that are competing for Stan
ford are in the mainstream of
the student body, there are no
special admits, there are no
special treatments given to
the athlete. The athlete makes
much sacrifice, and I think
there should be an apprecia
tion of that, or an acknowl
edgment of that .... Under
graduates should appreciate
. . . just how much sports
mean to the alumni, because
(it is how) they identify with
their school. They themselves
will be graduates themselves,
living in North Piatt, Neb. or
Duluth, or Spokane, Wash.,
and they will really take pri#e
in their athletic teams
because that is really a way"lo
measure and reflect on their
own school.

they get from the student
body.
Daily: They moved the student
section away from the 50-yard
line a few years back. Are you
in favor of moving it back?
Walsh: I am here for the stu
dents, and of course the criti
cal thing for me is to be
accepted by the undergradu
ates .... Student activities,
student involvement — meet
ings such as this — have first
priority, it's that simple. I
don't expect to answer to any
one but the students really, so
if it is in the student's interest
to return to where they were,
I think they should work
toward attaining that. I'm not
sure it's in my hand, but I do
know that my existence is
basically related to the stu
dents and no others.
Daily: Some people from other
top academic schools say that
Stanford puts too much
emphasis on football. Do you
think that Stanford as an aca
demic institution puts too
much emphasis on its sports?

Walsh: Oh no. I think we have
great balance here. You see,
we have a dimension that
many of the Ivy League
schools don't have and that is
a common bond among the
students. Athletics can be a
bonding factor for the student
body that no other activity
can because it can work for
community .... By degree
some are excited about it and
some are indifferent to it. You
run the full breadth of a scale
as to how much interest a
given student has, but they
know one thing: the athletes
that are competing for Stan
ford are in the mainstream of
the student body, there are no
special admits, there are no
special treatments given to
the athlete. The athlete makes
much sacrifice, and I think
there should be an apprecia
tion of that, or an acknowl
edgment of that .... Under
graduates should appreciate
. . . just how much sports
mean to the alumni, because
(it is how) they identify with
their school. They themselves
will be graduates themselves,
living in North Piatt, Neb. or
Duluth, or Spokane, Wash.,
and they will really take pri#e
in their athletic teams
because that is really a way"lo
measure and reflect on their
own school.

This is the second of a two-part
interview.
Daily: With Denny Green gone
and with Long Beach State
dropping football, there are
now no Division LA black head
coaches. Do you think this a
problem within the sport; do
you think the numbers will rise
in the future?
Walsh: Well,the numbers will
continue to rise, they will rise;
there isn't any question. I
think we are very late in get
ting minority coaches directly
involved with the sport, but
we'll have a strong representa
tion on our staff and I have had
experience developing minority
coaches — black coaches — in
my career, and many of them
have gone on to be head coach
es and otherwise, so I think
that program will be sustained
here. I'm hopeful that the next
time I go to a coaches associa
tion meeting that I will see
black coaches among the head
coaches in the country in repre
sentative numbers, and I think
there are many people striving
to develop.
Daily: Do you think that college
sports, and college football in
particular, has gotten out of
hand?
Walsh: No. I think it has gotten
under better control to be hon
est with you. I think the NCAA
has taken some very proper and
expedient and valid steps in
dealing with some of the ques
tionable tactics and some of the
questionable procedures and
behavioral patterns of certain
schools in the United States. I
think the NCAA has done an
excellent job of raising entrance
requirements and the student
athletes have responded around
the country; and in shortening
the recruiting cycle, which is
best for the student athlete and
everybody involved; and short
ening the practice limits, I
think that has been excellent.

Daily: As the football coach, how
can you bridge the gap between
the football team and the stu
dent body? How can you get the
students more behind the pro
gram and the team?
Walsh: That is just a matter of
over a period of time people
developing an appreciation for
what the student-athlete goes
through in the way of sacrifice
and commitment and dedica
tion, and appreciating that.
Stanford will never be a school
where the football player is an
idol, and that is a reason many
of these players are here. A
football player is simply
another member of the stu
dent body taking part in an
"extra-curricular" activity
that takes a lot of time and
sacrifice, and typically the
player thoroughly enjoys what
he is doing and gets great
gratification in playing the
game. (The players) thorough
ly appreciates the support
they get from the student
body.
Daily: They moved the student
section away from the 50-yard
