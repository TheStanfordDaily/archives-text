# Women have a mission
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
Two years ago a loss to Washington
helped give Stanford's women's basket
ball team the drive to capture the
national championship. This year it has
taken three losses to put more oomph in
the Cardinal, and the team has three
home games left in the regular season to
prove it is once again playing like a dom
inant Final Four squad.
Tonight at 7:30 p.m. on the Maples
Pavilion floor, Stanford will take on Ore
gon and try to show that its 31-point
shellacking of Arizona last Saturday was
merely a tune-up for what is to come.
The Ducks are 14-10, 6-8 and in sev
enth place in the Pacific 10 Conference.
However, their best player has missed 10
games this season with an injury, includ
ing a loss to the Cardinal, and is back in
the line-up and regaining her old form.
The Ducks have little or no chance of
making the NCAA tournament, but can
still be a dangerous team if center Deb
bie Sporcich and forward Staci Wallen
born are not contained.
Meanwhile, Stanford still has an out
side shot at one of the four No. 1 seeds
in the NCAAs. The Cardinal could get
picked from its current position at No. 6
in the AP poll, as the NCAA Selection
Committee does not necessarily follow
the AP rankings. Stanford is ranked No.
4 in the USA Today poll.
But the Cardinal's chances could
greatly improve by Mar. 15, the day that
the seedings are announced. Both the

Atlantic Coast Conference and the South
eastern Conference play post-season con
ference tournaments, and with the AP's
top four teams in those conferences, at
least two of those teams are likely to fall.
The most likely scenario is that No. 3
Mississippi and No. 4 Maryland will lose
to No. 2 Tennessee and No. 1 Virginia,
respectively. Should that happen, Stan
ford would probably receive the No. 1
seed in the NCAA Western Regional.
The only catch is that the Cardinal
must win the remainder of its games.
And Stanford has plenty of reasons to
be fired up for its last games. Two of
them are against teams which defeated
the Cardinal earlier this year. Oregon
State comes to town on Saturday, fol
lowed by California next week.
Also, Stanford coach Tara Van-
Derveer has complained all year of a lack
of fire in the collective belly of her squad.
After the Cardinal ripped through its
non-conference games early, she has wor
ried that expectations are so high that the
team lacks the motivation to exert the
efTort necessary to win, since winning
may have become an assumed outcome.
If Stanford is to go to the Final Four
for a third consecutive year, it has to
show the desire to do so. The team must
begin showing that desire no later than
7:30 p.m. tonight, and it cannot let
down until the evening of Apr. 5, in the
Los Angeles Sports Arena.
It may be a tall order to maintain
that level of intensity for that long, but
a national championship requires noth
ing less.
