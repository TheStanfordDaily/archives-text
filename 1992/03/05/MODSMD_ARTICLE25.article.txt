# Laxmen toy with 'Jacks

Like men playing with boys, the Stan
ford men'B lacrosse team lit up the score
board against Humboldt State last Satur
day, downing the seemingly hapless Lum
beijacks 25-2 in a Western Collegiate
Lacrosse League game played at Stanford.
Humboldt State suffered a rash of
penalties totaling 13 and a half minutes,
almost a quarter of the game time. This
factor, along with the weakness of the
opposing defense, gave the Stanford
attack a chance to hone their goal scoring
skills all day. Senior Curt Cetrulo had a
field day, scoring an impressive nine
goals and adding three assists. Sopho

more Mike Larson, a transfer from
Haverford College, pumped in eight tal
lies himself, assisting on three others.
The defense, led by tri-captain Mark
Reed and senior Kori Jacobs, held its
opponents to an unheard of two goals
for the second time this season.
Coach Bill Garvey hopes this win will
put the Cardinal on a positive note head
ing into this weekend's games. The team
faces a vital game against St. Mary's on
Saturday at 1 p.m. at the lacrosse field.
On Sunday, they travel to UC-Santa
Cruz for a Northern Conference match
up against the Banana Slugs which is
important for Stanford's chances to
make the play-offs at season's end.
