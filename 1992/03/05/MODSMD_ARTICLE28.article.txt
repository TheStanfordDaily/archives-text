# Ultimate to host weekend match
## 
### Dave Donahue Staff writer 
This weekend, the Stanford campus will be infest
ed with hordes of despicable vermin. Sporting dread
locks, upside-down golf visors, and in some cases
skirts (even the men), these hippie-athletes will inflict
a stark insult on many people's conception of sport.
Who are these crazed apparitions, these simpering
fruits, these side-show freaks?
They are ultimate players.
The Bth Annual Stanford Invitational Ultimate
Tournament is to be hosted this weekend by the
Stanford Men's Ultimate Team (SMUT) and the
Gals' Ultimate Team of Stanford (GUTS).
It will feature eight of the top 10 ranked men's
teams in the country, including national champion
UC—Santa Cruz, three time national champion
UC—Santa Barbara, and the unseen Eastern threat,
UNC—Wilmington, a school that placed second in
the nation the last three years running. The tour
nament will also feature the nation's top three

ranked women's teams, Santa Barbara, California,
and UNC—Wilmington.
At 15-1 and ranked No. 1 in the nation, the
Goliathan SMUT first team, known to the world as
Team Blood, will tenaciously defend its lofty territo
ry from would-be Davids, determined to unseat the
Blood from its precarious, lofty perch.
"A number of teams are gunning for us,"
observed team exorcist Mike "Pipe Organ" Casey.
"SLO (Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo) has lost to us twice
this year, and to nobody else. And of course, every
body else just hates Stanford."
The GUTS are also slated to have a challenging
tournament. "I'm not a gambler by any means, but if
I were a gambling woman, I would say the safe money
for this tournament would be on Stanford finishing
close to the top," said Sharon "Hurricane Zelda"
Amick. "We're a young team, but we're psyched."
Games will take place on the IM fields this Satur
day and Sunday, March 7-8, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
each day. The quarters, semis, and finals should
occur Sunday afternoon.
