# House for rent
## Bookstore to sublet vacation home, suspend use by employees 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Bookstore has
stopped providing its senior employ
ees with free use of a central Califor
nia vacation home — at least for now.
The Bookstore's board of directors
announced yesterday that, pending the
completion of an internal investigation
of the store's compensation practices,
its employees will not be allowed to use
the vacation facility in Twain Harte,
Calif., that the Bookstore has leased for
the last several years.
Instead, the Bookstore will try to
sublet the hot-tub-equipped vacation
home through a commercial rental

agency, Law Prof. Robert Weisberg, a
member of the Bookstore's board of
directors, said yesterday.
The Bookstore leases the two
story, four-bedroom home from Col
leagues Management Services, a con
sulting firm privately owned and
operated by the Bookstore's top two
managers, Eldon Speed and Philip
Chiaramonte.
Weisberg said the board did not
feel "a drastic need" to terminate the
lease agreement while its review
takes place. The review is expected to
take about two months.
The Bookstore's compensation
practices are also the subject of an
investigation by the California Attor

ney General. That probe, to determine
if the Bookstore's practices violate
state law, was prompted by disclo
sures in The Daily last month about
lavish perquisites provided to several
of the store's senior employees.
Some of the Bookstore's board
members have said that they were not
aware of the full range of perquisites,
which include free use of the vacation
home, a motor home, a sailboat and
several top-of-the-line automobiles.
Board members came under heavy
fire yesterday at a meeting of the
Bookstore's association, a group of
Stanford faculty, staff and students
who are responsible for electing the
nonprofit store's directors.

"I have no confidence in the board
whatsoever," said one faculty mem
ber. "I get the impression you didn't
know what the hell was going on.
Obviously what happened is dead
wrong and shouldn't have hap
pened."
The Daily was allowed to attend
the meeting on the condition that
members of the association who
spoke not be identified by name in
this article.
Throughout the meeting, several
of the dozen faculty and staff mem
bers who attended said they were
frustrated by the limited information
the board members were willing
to prbvide them.
The board has hired a battery
of outside lawyers and accoun
tants to conduct its internal
review. Until that review is com
pleted, the board will be unable to

provide members with many
specifics, explained Weisberg, who
has been designated as the
board's spokesman.
Weisberg said that when the
review is completed, its findings will
be made public. Saying too much
about the situation before then, he
said, would provide a "partial" and
"perhaps misleading" picture.
The board did announce yes
terday that it had appointed a

three-person audit committee to
coordinate its internal investiga
tion. Members, who will not be
compensated, include:
• Albert Hastorf, a professor
emeritus in psychology;
• Leslie Luttgens, a 1942 Stan
ford graduate who was the first
woman to head a regional United
Way chapter, and who currently
sits on several boards of nonprofit
corporations; and

• Morton Winston, a founding
board member of the nonprofit
Museum of Contemporary Art in
Los Angeles.
The audit committee met for
the first time last night in San
Francisco, according to Weisberg.
At yesterday's meeting of associ
ation members, several faculty and
staff suggested they play a greater
role in governing the Bookstore.
History Prof. Peter Stansky,

the board's president, said that
was a strong possibility. "It's likely
that a totally different governance
structure will emerge," he said.
Board members also pledged to
provide stronger oversight in the
future.
In addition to thousands of dol
lars in lease payments to Speed
and Chiaramonte's consulting
firm, the Bookstore has paid more
than $69,000 to furnish the

Twain Harte vacation home. Pur
chases made with Bookstore
funds include a $4,341 hot tub
and a $5,888 satellite dish.
Speed, the Bookstore's general
manager, is provided with a 1991
model year InfLniti Q45. Chiara
monte, its assistant manager, is
provided with a 1990 Cadillac
Eldorado Biarritz, one of three
Cadillacs the store has purchased
in recent years.
