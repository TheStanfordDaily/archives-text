## Bookstore to sublet vacation home, suspend use by employees 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Bookstore has
stopped providing its senior employ
ees with free use of a central Califor
nia vacation home â€” at least for now.
The Bookstore's board of directors
announced yesterday that, pending the
completion of an internal investigation
of the store's compensation practices,
its employees will not be allowed to use
the vacation facility in Twain Harte,
Calif., that the Bookstore has leased for
the last several years.
Instead, the Bookstore will try to
sublet the hot-tub-equipped vacation
home through a commercial rental

agency, Law Prof. Robert Weisberg, a
member of the Bookstore's board of
directors, said yesterday.
The Bookstore leases the two
story, four-bedroom home from Col
leagues Management Services, a con
sulting firm privately owned and
operated by the Bookstore's top two
managers, Eldon Speed and Philip
Chiaramonte.
Weisberg said the board did not
feel "a drastic need" to terminate the
lease agreement while its review
takes place. The review is expected to
take about two months.
The Bookstore's compensation
practices are also the subject of an
investigation by the California Attor

ney General. That probe, to determine
if the Bookstore's practices violate
state law, was prompted by disclo
sures in The Daily last month about
lavish perquisites provided to several
of the store's senior employees.
Some of the Bookstore's board
members have said that they were not
aware of the full range of perquisites,
which include free use of the vacation
home, a motor home, a sailboat and
several top-of-the-line automobiles.
Board members came under heavy
fire yesterday at a meeting of the
Bookstore's association, a group of
Stanford faculty, staff and students
who are responsible for electing the
nonprofit store's directors.

"I have no confidence in the board
whatsoever," said one faculty mem
ber. "I get the impression you didn't
know what the hell was going on.
Obviously what happened is dead
wrong and shouldn't have hap
pened."
The Daily was allowed to attend
the meeting on the condition that
members of the association who
spoke not be identified by name in
this article.
Throughout the meeting, several
of the dozen faculty and staff mem
bers who attended said they were
frustrated by the limited information
