# New president chosen by IFC
## Focus will be on improving image of Greek system 
### Laurel Sullivan Staff writer 
The Interfraternity Council
elected junior Rip Waters presi
dent last night.
Waters, who ran unopposed,
said he wants to encourage a pos
itive relationship between the IFC
and the University. "I want to
focus on improving the image
with the administration," he said.
Waters served as the IFC's
social chair last year and is co-
Rush chair for Sigma Chi. His
term as IFC president will begin
after Rush this spring.
Next year, the IFC will focus
more on public service than it has
in the past, according to Waters.
He said he hopes to target a service
group like Friends For Youth, an

organization that pairs Stanford
students with underprivileged
children. The group was included
in Greek Week activities last week.
Waters said he would also like
the IFC to host three-on-three
basketball tournaments to raise
money for charity. Fraternity res
ident assistants organized the
activity this year.
He said he would support
increasing fraternity housing "if
it would add to the strength of the
Greek system," but added that he
plans to concentrate on keeping
the current fraternity system as
strong as possible.
Elections were held earlier
than usual this year to allow for a
longer transition period for new
officers, according to current vice
president Chris Flanagan.

Other changes made this year
include combining the social chair
and secretary jobs into a new vice
president of operations position.
The current vice president posi
tion will be renamed vice presi
dent of judicial affairs.
Other officers elected last
night were:
• Matt Moran of Theta Xi as vice
president of judicial affairs;
• Kevin Efrusy of Kappa Sigma
as vice president of operations;
• Matt Wulfstat of Phi Delta
Theta as treasurer;
• Mike Champney of Sigma Chi
as Rush chair; and
• Michael Ehrman of Alpha
Epsilon Pi, Mike Flanagan of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sean
O'Malley of Sigma Nu and Gerry
Lares of Sigma Phi Epsilon as the

four at-large members of the
council.
Three students were also elect
ed to the Judicial Board: Jason
Vanacour of SAE, Chris Freeburg
of Sigma Chi and Jason Pate of
Theta Xi.
