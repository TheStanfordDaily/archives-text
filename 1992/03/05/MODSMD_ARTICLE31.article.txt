# Basket case puzzler
## Irreplaceable relics stolen from Anthropology Dept. 
### June Fang Staff writer 
Approximately 12 small, rare Indian baskets were
taken from the Department of Anthropology
between 10 p.m. Tuesday night and 8 a.m. yesterday
morning.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer, someone apparently unhinged the door
and removed the baskets from their display cabinet.
According to Assoc. Anthropology Prof. John
Rick, "Someone managed to get through the back of
the case, taking the padlock with them. Someone
had wanted to get to them badly."
Made by the Karuk Indians, a tribe from North
ern California, the baskets were crafted between the
1890 sand the 19305. They are decorated with geo
metric patterns and are 4 inches by 8 inches in size.

Rick said he does not know the dollar value of the
baskets because an appraisal would have to be made
by an art expert rather than an anthropologist. The
baskets had not been appraised.
Niemeyer said they are worth a considerable sum
because they are irreplaceable relics.
Police have not identified a motive or a suspect.
"We have no explanation other than the obvious,
that someone wanted them for the money," Rick
said.
In the display, the baskets were accompanied by
photographs of the tribe's members using them in
daily tasks, he said.
A wide variety of people ranging from elementary
school students to scholars visit the display.
"It served a good educational and cultural func
tion," Rick said. "We've had all sorts of people use
the display in the past."
