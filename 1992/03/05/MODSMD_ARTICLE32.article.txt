# Sailors battle through home meet
## 
### Scott Reiss Staff writer 
The Stanford sailing team
continued its winning ways last
weekend, as they overcame tough
conditions and tough opponents
at the Stanford Team Race Invi
tational in Redwood City.
The Cardinal, ranked No. 14 in
the country, showed a lot of poise
and determination as the "A"
team sailed its "flying juniors"
undefeated through the 10-team
Invitational, while the "B" team
mounted a very respectable 5-4
record. In a regatta which includ-

Ed west coast rivals USC and No.
18 California, the young Cardinal
squad stepped up for coach Blake
Middleton and did what they
needed to do.
"Considering that we have
basically a fairly young and
inexperienced team, I was really
excited and pleased by the
results this weekend," said Mid
dleton. "From a team racing
perspective, we've got a long
way to go, but it's nice to know
that we're already in a decent
position."
Middleton went on to note
that team racing is the most com

plex type of regatta, because it
involves not only sailing skill, but
mathematics as well. Each indi
vidual race matches three two
person boats from one school
against three from another
school, and the winner is deter
mined by the combined finishing
order of all six boats.
Perhaps the best single race of
the day pitted the Cardinal "A"
team against USC. Stanford, led
by senior skipper Mike Sanford
and crew Kristen Sidell, pulled off
a last minute victory when they
sailed from behind to achieve a
winning 2-3-4 combination.
