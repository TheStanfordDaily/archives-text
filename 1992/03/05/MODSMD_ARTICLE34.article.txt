# INTERMISSION
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY SHARK ATTACK Hockey's big fish devour Bay Area 
### Trevor Payne 
Thursday, March 5,1992

"Jaws" has gone belly-up. The
San Jose Sharks, the newest
National Hockey League fran
chise, may not have much bite
(they're last in the standings, and
hockey players don't have teeth
anyway), but they have succeeded
the great white as America's
favorite cartilaginous fish.
Hockey at first glance looks
like twelve goons with knives on
their feet and wooden scythes in
their hands, skating around a
contained ice surface crashing
into each other.
Violence, particularly fighting,
is a big part of the sport, but it's
no problem. Actually, there is an
understood ritual to fighting in
hockey. Rarely is anybody jumped
unaware.
Two opponents circle each
other like cats about to rumble.
Once activation energy is reached
— wham! They grab hold of each
other's jerseys and go at it, each
skating forward in an attempt to
put their opponent off balance.
The rest of the players on the ice
grab hold of a partner and look
on.
Besides being entertaining for
the crowd, a good scrap once in a
while has a cathartic effect for the

players.
This type of excitement is one
reason why 10,888 people have
migrated to a pit, aptly named the
Cow Palace, for 31 straight home
games this year. It certainly isn't
because of the building. The seat
ing sucks, and it smells. It isn't
even in San Jose. Fortunately,
they are building a new arena in
San Jose for the '93-'94 season.
People even filled
the place against the
Quebec Nordiques,
who, if it weren't for SSfeh
the Sharks, would XffiaJgjgS®
be the worst team I
in the league. Que
bee is, in fact, only a
few points ahead of the Sharks.
So it also isn't because of either
team's winning tradition.
Despite the hardships, people
in Northern California have gone
Shark-crazy. Going to a game is
like seeing a demographic cross
section of the Bay Area, from
yuppie types to construction
workers.
Here are some reasons why
some members of the sell-out
crowd went to see the Sharks
devour the Nordiques last week.

"I live for hockey. It's action
packed. It's a lot of fun."
Dana Wilson, San Francisco:
"The fights!"
Scott Delvacky, Foster City:
"The action."
Sam Hagar, Oakland, former
Washington Capitals season-tick
et holder: "Because it's the great
est sport on foot."
Eric, an unstable youth:
"You'd better move."
Sue Grossen, San Jose: "Keeps
moving, not like baseball."
Dylan Pollard, Stanford
undergrad: "Because there's no
pretense about it. People come to
watch hockey fights, and (Shark
defenseman) Link Gaetz usually
delivers."
Action, pace, excitement,
fights — this sport has it all. You

would have to go to two or three
other sports to get all that. With
the Sharks it's all there at once.
Another refreshing thing
about hockey is the lack of egos
involved. These athletes, con-

Yes, that thing that
cleans the ice is
really called a Zam
boni, and yes, it
has a fin.

trary to their appearance on the
ice, are amiable guys. You don't
see any Ricky Henderson types
on the Sharks' roster. I've seen
hockey players give an interview
while they were practically being
stitched together. They're just
happy to be talked to.

Nordique goalie John Tanner
lamented that goonish defense
man Curtis Leschyshyn was out
of action, because then he
couldn't get into a scrap with
Gaetz. According to Tanner, the
Nordiques' attitude was
defeatist, but it didn't seem to
bother him too much. Mostly he
talked about bars in Quebec City.
He looked like he could put a few
away.
If you manage to get tickets to
a game, there are a couple of
things you might want to know.
Nobody knows why they
announce "one minute remain
ing in the period." Nothing dif
ferent happens in the last
minute, and anyone who wants
to can look up at the clock. Yes,
that thing that cleans the ice is
really called a Zamboni, and yes,
it has a fin. And no, hockey is not
Canada's national sport —
lacrosse is.

Thursday, March 5,1992

"Jaws" has gone belly-up. The
San Jose Sharks, the newest
National Hockey League fran
chise, may not have much bite
(they're last in the standings, and
hockey players don't have teeth
anyway), but they have succeeded
the great white as America's
favorite cartilaginous fish.
Hockey at first glance looks
like twelve goons with knives on
their feet and wooden scythes in
their hands, skating around a
contained ice surface crashing
into each other.
Violence, particularly fighting,
is a big part of the sport, but it's
no problem. Actually, there is an
understood ritual to fighting in
hockey. Rarely is anybody jumped
unaware.
Two opponents circle each
other like cats about to rumble.
Once activation energy is reached
— wham! They grab hold of each
other's jerseys and go at it, each
skating forward in an attempt to
put their opponent off balance.
The rest of the players on the ice
grab hold of a partner and look
on.
Besides being entertaining for
the crowd, a good scrap once in a
while has a cathartic effect for the

players.
This type of excitement is one
reason why 10,888 people have
migrated to a pit, aptly named the
Cow Palace, for 31 straight home
games this year. It certainly isn't
because of the building. The seat
ing sucks, and it smells. It isn't
even in San Jose. Fortunately,
they are building a new arena in
San Jose for the '93-'94 season.
People even filled
the place against the
Quebec Nordiques,
who, if it weren't for SSfeh
the Sharks, would XffiaJgjgS®
be the worst team I
in the league. Que
bee is, in fact, only a
few points ahead of the Sharks.
So it also isn't because of either
team's winning tradition.
Despite the hardships, people
in Northern California have gone
Shark-crazy. Going to a game is
like seeing a demographic cross
section of the Bay Area, from
yuppie types to construction
workers.
Here are some reasons why
some members of the sell-out
crowd went to see the Sharks
devour the Nordiques last week.

"I live for hockey. It's action
packed. It's a lot of fun."
Dana Wilson, San Francisco:
"The fights!"
Scott Delvacky, Foster City:
"The action."
Sam Hagar, Oakland, former
Washington Capitals season-tick
et holder: "Because it's the great
est sport on foot."
Eric, an unstable youth:
"You'd better move."
Sue Grossen, San Jose: "Keeps
moving, not like baseball."
Dylan Pollard, Stanford
undergrad: "Because there's no
pretense about it. People come to
watch hockey fights, and (Shark
defenseman) Link Gaetz usually
delivers."
Action, pace, excitement,
fights — this sport has it all. You

would have to go to two or three
other sports to get all that. With
the Sharks it's all there at once.
Another refreshing thing
about hockey is the lack of egos
involved. These athletes, con-
