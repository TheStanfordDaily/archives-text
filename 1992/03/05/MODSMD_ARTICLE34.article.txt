## THE
						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY SHARK ATTACK Hockey's big fish devour Bay Area

"Jaws" has gone belly-up. The
San Jose Sharks, the newest
National Hockey League fran
chise, may not have much bite
(they're last in the standings, and
hockey players don't have teeth
anyway), but they have succeeded
the great white as America's
favorite cartilaginous fish.
Hockey at first glance looks
like twelve goons with knives on
their feet and wooden scythes in
their hands, skating around a
contained ice surface crashing
into each other.
Violence, particularly fighting,
is a big part of the sport, but it's
no problem. Actually, there is an
understood ritual to fighting in
hockey. Rarely is anybody jumped
unaware.
Two opponents circle each
other like cats about to rumble.
Once activation energy is reached
— wham! They grab hold of each
other's jerseys and go at it, each
skating forward in an attempt to
put their opponent off balance.
The rest of the players on the ice
grab hold of a partner and look
on.
Besides being entertaining for
the crowd, a good scrap once in a
while has a cathartic effect for the

players.
This type of excitement is one
reason why 10,888 people have
migrated to a pit, aptly named the
Cow Palace, for 31 straight home
games this year. It certainly isn't
because of the building. The seat
ing sucks, and it smells. It isn't
even in San Jose. Fortunately,
they are building a new arena in
San Jose for the '93-'94 season.
People even filled
the place against the
Quebec Nordiques,
who, if it weren't for SSfeh
the Sharks, would XffiaJgjgS®
be the worst team I
in the league. Que
bee is, in fact, only a
few points ahead of the Sharks.
So it also isn't because of either
team's winning tradition.
Despite the hardships, people
in Northern California have gone
Shark-crazy. Going to a game is
like seeing a demographic cross
section of the Bay Area, from
yuppie types to construction
workers.
Here are some reasons why
some members of the sell-out
crowd went to see the Sharks
devour the Nordiques last week.
