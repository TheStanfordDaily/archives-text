# Beowulf off the coast of Maine

Editor's note: This is the final installment of a
four-part short story that has appeared in Intermis
sion.

"What makes you believe that the moon is alive?"
Ah. Finally. Her journalistic flair did not fail her.
She didn't have to erupt into infuriated, impatient
scorn. She had been on the verge.
Calmly, now. Just a witty lunatic between you

and wet damnation. Just
an impossibly tiny splin
tered raft between journal
ism and shark bait. This is
just a story. .. . Just
remember that, Annie,
and milk this guy for all
he's worth. . . . All the

news that's fit to print. . . . But don't push your
luck.
He smiled again. "Please test me some other way.
I'm tired of answering the same questions each
time."
Annie just stared at him. He was sharp. She just
stared at him, so that she could think of something
to say while parrying his gaze. Finally, she spoke.
"Prove to me how deeply you love her."
"Thank you." Instantly, he stood up and gazed at
the moon for a long, long time. Then he jumped into
the water and did not come up for some ten minutes.
When he finally surfaced, a fish hung on his hand.

MOMIX dancers combine virtuosity with startling effects in "Eiva" and other pieces.
Its eyes glowed in the moonlight,
and its viper-long teeth dug into
one of his wrists.
"I love my princess this
deeply." He pried the dead fish's
teeth from his wrist and threw it
back into the water. Annie had
seen fish like that only in encyclo
pedias. They came from miles
under the sea.
Annie suddenly felt like she
had had enough of this show. She
didn't know who this freak was,
nor why he wanted to do this to
people. She didn't care. She want
ed to go home to her pet pig
Wilbur, to forget about all of this
stupid nonsense, to tell her grand
children about this someday â€”
her foster grandchildren, she
meant. Just stop it already, okay,
Felix?
"I'm sorry that you will never
have grandchildren, Misman
kiewicz."
"How the hell do you know
that? I mean, how the fuck do you

know that about me?" Only her
gynecologist and her dead mother
knew about that. And her gyne
cologist would tell somebody only
after Chinese water torture. She
knew how much the cyst had hurt
Annie.
"Who in the fuck are you, you
sick old man? What do you want
from me?"
She started to cry. Jesus, she
hadn't cried since her mother died
five years ago. She had decided
that she just couldn't muster up
that much love for anybody any
more, it was just too painful. She
had never settled some things
with her mother, but she had
gone just like that .. . after a
month in a coma. Why? Why did
the only person in the world that
mattered have to die in a fucking
coma? What's the point in that,
dear God?
"Ask not what I want from
you; 'tis you who want from me,
and I shall give to you."
"What? What do I want? Do I
want your fucking moon?" Sud
denly his countenance changed.
What had she said? Fucking
moon? His eyes got more intense.

He stared at her as if he saw the
end of the world behind her.
"Oh, your goddamn princess,
the mighty moon. I wonder
what's so special about that
round collection of piss-shine."

How did one insult
the moon? One didn't
need to do that very
often.

Shifting down to Brooklynese.
"Yeah, I don't know what you see
in that vast bright shit-hole in the
sky. It's just a shiny toilet-hole, a
round rusty brass hole for space
shit to pass through." How did
one insult the moon? One didn't
need to do that very often. But if
one had to, she thought, that's
probably how one would do it.
"I've let pass everything you've
said but this, Mismankiewicz, I've
swallowed it all for love; but no
one, not the fish, not the whales,
not the waves nor the wind nor

thunderstorms, not even messen
gers from the world beyond can so
brashly mock her majesty."
He closed his eyes.
The moon clouded over.
After a moment of dark silence,
he opened his eyes again. As the
moon cleared, the clothes of a
journalist from the New York
Times lay uninhabited on one
side of his little dinghy. These
clothes would condemn Felix
Monamor Lupus to the electric
chair for two first-degree murders
and several other disappearances
in the Luny Harbor area.
Mr. Lupus would go smiling to
his grave knowing he made the
ultimate sacrifice for his beloved
who waited for him in the night
sky. His last words would thank
her for this test of his fidelity.
I join you in your nightly walk,
I chase you in your dreams; I
embrace you each night with
greater grip until I envelop your
body whole. Our love renews itself
each month. This love cannot be
exhausted. I've died a mortal
death for you, but live in your
body eternally.
