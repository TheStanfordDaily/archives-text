Editor's note: This is the final installment of a
four-part short story that has appeared in Intermis
sion.

"What makes you believe that the moon is alive?"
Ah. Finally. Her journalistic flair did not fail her.
She didn't have to erupt into infuriated, impatient
scorn. She had been on the verge.
Calmly, now. Just a witty lunatic between you

and wet damnation. Just
an impossibly tiny splin
tered raft between journal
ism and shark bait. This is
just a story. .. . Just
remember that, Annie,
and milk this guy for all
he's worth. . . . All the

news that's fit to print. . . . But don't push your
luck.
He smiled again. "Please test me some other way.
I'm tired of answering the same questions each
time."
Annie just stared at him. He was sharp. She just
stared at him, so that she could think of something
to say while parrying his gaze. Finally, she spoke.
"Prove to me how deeply you love her."
"Thank you." Instantly, he stood up and gazed at
the moon for a long, long time. Then he jumped into
the water and did not come up for some ten minutes.
When he finally surfaced, a fish hung on his hand.
