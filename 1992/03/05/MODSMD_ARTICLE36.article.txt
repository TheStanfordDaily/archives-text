# Dance show dazzles with feats, surprises
##

Dancers stretch. They jump,
turn, twist and tumble. They
often seem superhuman — but
they are always obviously people.
Yet MOMIX, a modern dance
company coming to Stanford this
weekend, makes even that basic
assumption less than obvious.
The troupe presents abstract
images formed by the human
body, but many of these images
could be featured on "Ripley's
Believe It or Not."
The first-time audience mem
ber is bound to say, "That's not a
person. Human bodies don't do
that." But be assured that
MOMIX's moving shapes are in
fact humans — accompanied by
some really wild lighting and
props.
MOMIX is the 10-year-old
brain-child of Moses Pendleton,
professional dancer, creator and
free-thinker. A former cross
country skier at Dartmouth Col
lege, Pendleton is a consummate
athlete.
His choreography makes
incessant demands on the physi
cal capacities of the MOMIX

dancers in order to "create exten
sions of the human body that are
unusual and amazing," as he
describes it. From back-bending
contortions to gymnastic feats,
the athleticism of MOMIX perfor

MOMIX also makes ultimate
use of lighting and props. The
lighting is so skillfully done that
it seems to metamorphosize the
stage space and give the contours
of the dancers' bodies new dimen
sions.
Props range from such simple,
Fred Astair-esque canes to man
nequins, skis and abstract sculp
ture. Every MOMIX production
is genuinely multimedia — com
bining slides, dance, music and
innovative staging.
This weekend's performances
will feature the West Coast pre
mieres of two new works by
Pendleton — "Passion" and a
still-untitled work about baseball,
possibly to be named "Pitcher at
an Exhibition Game" or "The
Umpire Strikes Back."
Set to Peter Gabriel's "Music
for the Last Temptation of
Christ," "Passion" is a surreal,
