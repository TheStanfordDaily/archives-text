# Dance show dazzles with feats, surprises
## 
### Tracy Shinn Staff writer 
Dancers stretch. They jump,
turn, twist and tumble. They
often seem superhuman — but
they are always obviously people.
Yet MOMIX, a modern dance
company coming to Stanford this
weekend, makes even that basic
assumption less than obvious.
The troupe presents abstract
images formed by the human
body, but many of these images
could be featured on "Ripley's
Believe It or Not."
The first-time audience mem
ber is bound to say, "That's not a
person. Human bodies don't do
that." But be assured that
MOMIX's moving shapes are in
fact humans — accompanied by
some really wild lighting and
props.
MOMIX is the 10-year-old
brain-child of Moses Pendleton,
professional dancer, creator and
free-thinker. A former cross
country skier at Dartmouth Col
lege, Pendleton is a consummate
athlete.
His choreography makes
incessant demands on the physi
cal capacities of the MOMIX

dancers in order to "create exten
sions of the human body that are
unusual and amazing," as he
describes it. From back-bending
contortions to gymnastic feats,
the athleticism of MOMIX perfor
mances is startling.
MOMIX also makes ultimate
use of lighting and props. The
lighting is so skillfully done that
it seems to metamorphosize the
stage space and give the contours
of the dancers' bodies new dimen
sions.
Props range from such simple,
Fred Astair-esque canes to man
nequins, skis and abstract sculp
ture. Every MOMIX production
is genuinely multimedia — com
bining slides, dance, music and
innovative staging.
This weekend's performances
will feature the West Coast pre
mieres of two new works by
Pendleton — "Passion" and a
still-untitled work about baseball,
possibly to be named "Pitcher at
an Exhibition Game" or "The
Umpire Strikes Back."
Set to Peter Gabriel's "Music
for the Last Temptation of
Christ," "Passion" is a surreal,
thought-provoking presentation
that mixes projected images such
as the Virgin Mary and Buddha,
sunflowers and old army photos.
From behind a scrim front
cloth the dancers form images
that weave in and out of the slide
projections as their movements
are illuminated from the rear.
Constantly evolving, the
images combine the earthly and
the spiritual without hardening
the combination into a static
entity. In this way, the piece
allows audience members to cre
ate their own combination of
spirituality and materiality.
The baseball piece is the result
of a collaboration with the San
Francisco Giants. The presenta
tion has a strong spring theme,

with the color green pervading
the stage space. A combination of
baseball slide projections, crowd
noise and anthems serves to cre
ate a stadium feel.
Some distinctive movements
include Pete Rose's "belly slide"
into third base, the "staple
dance" catchers practice to get
their legs in shape to pounce on
pop flies and the "MOMIX
Swing," a Pendleton invention
that he hopes to teach the Giants.
Pendleton himself is an inter
esting character. As the creative
energy source of MOMIX, he has
materially regimented his life so
he can be spiritually free. As he
gains much of his inspiration
from nature, Pendleton walks six
miles and swims one mile each
day, in addition to spending time
free dancing in his favorite envi
ronments.
A few of his favorite places to

commune with nature are Oak
wood in New England and the
Arizona desert, not to mention
the Swiss Alps — skis and speed
are always good for spiritual
growth, of course.
Pendleton also practices horti
culture, particularly growing
Russian Mammoth flowers, a few
of which are pictured in "Pas
sion." He describes his work as
an "eternal pursuit," a quest to
convey the inexhaustible forces of
"light, water and energy"
through dance.

MOMEX will perform Friday and
Saturday nights at 8 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium. Tickets
are $20, $18, $16 and $14 (stu
dents $3 off) at Tresidder Ticket
Office and through BASS. Unsold
tickets will be available at half
price "student rush" rate 15 min
utes before curtain.
