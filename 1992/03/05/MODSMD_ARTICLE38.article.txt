# Leave your lover â€” the other 45 ways
## 
### 
Life is a zero-sum game. A race to beat
everyone else to a fruit-juicy pulp before
they do the same to you. The only way to
get a head without putting someone else
behind is to flip a coin, and even then it's only
a 50-50 shot. Get rude, or get screwed. Nice
has no place in this world outside of Southern
France.
Just take a look at this week's Review for
proof. Now, I've been easy on my treatment of
the ultra-conservative dogvomi-, er, dogma
this year. No cracks at Buchanan or Duke.
When the Reagan library opened, I didn't
make fun of the "Reagan Documents" room
they were to include (e.g., "What? A stationery
store?" or "What'll they call his philosophy
section? The Tao of Babble?"). I even steered
clear of all the Rabois/"Raw-boys" jokes when
they were in style. No, I kept quiet, hoping
that if I just ignored them, then maybe they'd
go away.
And what do I get in return? Read the
Review's headline: "ASSU Senate and The
Stanford Daily Butt Heads." Unfair!
Moral: being nice won't get you anything in
this world, except maybe a brief mention in a
Herb Caen column. You must show no mercy.
Don't give in to nothin' or nobody. Never sur
render.
So what am I getting at with all this biz
schoolesque/Corey Hart kind of talk? Rela
tionships, bucko.
Y'see, a relationship is basically an emo
tional form of ye olde prisoner's dilemma
game. If neither person tries to break up, then
everything is all happy-happy we're-so-cute
together-we-make-our-friends-puke bliss. If
both people try to break up, that's when tem
pers flare, picture frames are broken and
large, pointed objects get thrown at each
other. If only one person breaks up, however,
that one gets freedom and a feeling of power,
while the other is left emotionally shattered,
lying boneless on the floor in a pool of nose

dribble, listening to K-Schmaltz.
So what's the best option for the prisoner
of a relationship? Remember, kid: no mercy.
Get out while you can. Dump or be dumped.
What? Know I'm right, but too girlie-man to
do the dirty deed?
That's where Paul Simon comes in. After
he parted ways with that Ralph Malph guy,
and long before he got into his current
Time/Life one-album-per-continent series, he
wrote a catchy little number.
"50 Ways to Leave your Lover" promised to
help the poor man who didn't quite know how
to get rid of his woman. Alas, of the 50, he only
mentions five in his song, and that's including
"You don't need to be coy, Roy," which isn't so
much a way as just a really bad rhyme.
But worry no more. Yes, folks, breaking
new ground in breaking up, we now present to
you the newly-discovered, complete list of 50
ways to leave your lover. Hope it proves useful.
The trouble is all with Paul's poor math she
laughed at me,
The number is fifty, but five were all we could
see.
The other forty-five are shown here finally,
And that makes fifty ways to leave your lover:

Shuh, as if. Chris Harris doesn't
really go for all that "you stab my
back, I'll stab yours" philosophy.

Thank God for Harris

39) Say you'd rather look fer'

Mel,
Then don't you blame us, Amos.

Shuh, as if. Chris Harris doesn't
really go for all that "you stab my
back, I'll stab yours" philosophy.
Life is a zero-sum game. A race to beat
everyone else to a fruit-juicy pulp before
they do the same to you. The only way to
get a head without putting someone else
behind is to flip a coin, and even then it's only
a 50-50 shot. Get rude, or get screwed. Nice
has no place in this world outside of Southern
France.
Just take a look at this week's Review for
proof. Now, I've been easy on my treatment of
the ultra-conservative dogvomi-, er, dogma
this year. No cracks at Buchanan or Duke.
When the Reagan library opened, I didn't
make fun of the "Reagan Documents" room
they were to include (e.g., "What? A stationery
store?" or "What'll they call his philosophy
section? The Tao of Babble?"). I even steered
clear of all the Rabois/"Raw-boys" jokes when
they were in style. No, I kept quiet, hoping
that if I just ignored them, then maybe they'd
go away.
And what do I get in return? Read the
Review's headline: "ASSU Senate and The
Stanford Daily Butt Heads." Unfair!
Moral: being nice won't get you anything in
this world, except maybe a brief mention in a
Herb Caen column. You must show no mercy.
Don't give in to nothin' or nobody. Never sur
render.
So what am I getting at with all this biz
schoolesque/Corey Hart kind of talk? Rela
tionships, bucko.
Y'see, a relationship is basically an emo
tional form of ye olde prisoner's dilemma
game. If neither person tries to break up, then
everything is all happy-happy we're-so-cute
together-we-make-our-friends-puke bliss. If
both people try to break up, that's when tem
pers flare, picture frames are broken and
large, pointed objects get thrown at each
other. If only one person breaks up, however,
that one gets freedom and a feeling of power,
while the other is left emotionally shattered,
lying boneless on the floor in a pool of nose

dribble, listening to K-Schmaltz.
So what's the best option for the prisoner
of a relationship? Remember, kid: no mercy.
Get out while you can. Dump or be dumped.
What? Know I'm right, but too girlie-man to
do the dirty deed?
That's where Paul Simon comes in. After
he parted ways with that Ralph Malph guy,
and long before he got into his current
Time/Life one-album-per-continent series, he
wrote a catchy little number.
"50 Ways to Leave your Lover" promised to
help the poor man who didn't quite know how
to get rid of his woman. Alas, of the 50, he only
mentions five in his song, and that's including
"You don't need to be coy, Roy," which isn't so
much a way as just a really bad rhyme.
But worry no more. Yes, folks, breaking
new ground in breaking up, we now present to
you the newly-discovered, complete list of 50
ways to leave your lover. Hope it proves useful.
The trouble is all with Paul's poor math she
laughed at me,
The number is fifty, but five were all we could
see.
The other forty-five are shown here finally,
And that makes fifty ways to leave your lover:
1) Slip out the back, Jack.
2) Make a new plan, Stan.

3) Don't need to be coy, Roy.
4) Hop on the bus, Gus.
5) Drop off the key, Lee.
6) Give her the slip, Kip.
7) Tell her she's fat, Matt.
8) Reject her, Hector.
9) Spit on her mom, Tom.
10) Call her a canine, Rich.
11) Stick a sword in her, Mortimer.
12) Give her the axe (the axe, the axe), Max.
13) Hire a hit man, Rip Van.
14) Barf on her shoe, Bartholomew.
15) Just be yourself, Dick.
16) Take the knot and sever it, Everett.
17) Call her a bimbo, Jimbo.
18) Ignore her call, Paul.
19) Tell her you're gay, Ray.
20) Tell her you're straight, Kate.
21) Give her the dis', Chris.
22) Whenever she asks you to do something,
wait a few seonds, turn your head slowly,
stare straight into her eyes, and say, "Like
Hell!," Michael.
23) Use your auto, Otto.
24) Why not just cheat, Pete.
25) Give her "Boo! Hiss!"'s, Ulysses.
26) Keep on fartin', Martin.
27) Compare her to Q*Bert, Hubert.
28) Take BART, Bart.
29) Serve her a notice, Otis.
30) Start wearing a skirt, Bert.
31) Start sportin' bras, Fortinbras.
