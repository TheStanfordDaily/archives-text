"You gotta make [rap] mean
something. . . . People who
fraudulate, who write butt
lyrics and think the tracks can
get you over, that's cool, but
what's gonna happen if you
don't have no more beats to
sample, and you ain't a musi
cian, and you can barely write
rhymes ? Then you 're gonna fall
off."
â€” Q-Tip, A Tribe Called Quest
Rap is out of control. The
raw, uncompromising ghetto
music that many critics dis
missed as a passing fad has
been around for nearly 20
years. Every major record com
pany now has a rap label. R&B
artists often use elements of
the genre to spice up otherwise
bland singles and everyone
from Bob Hope to Bart Simp
son has tried to flip a phrase.
Rap's commercialization,
however, has been simultane
ously beneficial and damaging
to the art form. While the
artists are finally earning their
due respect, compensation and

worldwide recognition, a lot of
B.S. records are being released.
Just about any fool who can
loop an old Issac Hayes break,
rhyme the words "sucka" and
"muthafucka" and claim Co
mpton as hometown is a poten
tial platinum-selling hardcore
artist.
M.C. Hammer, Freedom
Williams and Marky Mark,
among other commercialized
artists who can barely rhyme,
are selling millions of records
as "rappers," while the Busta
Rhymes, Grand Puba Maxwells
and Q-Tips of the world go
unrecognized by the general
public . This deluge of mediocre
talent, pushed by major finan
cial support, is leading to the
downfall of the genre.
That is, until the "teacher"
returned to bring back mea
sures of quality control to the
new school of hip-hop.
Kris Parker, known in rap
circles as KRS-One, is a rapper
who has paid his dues. "The
Teacher," with his crew, Boogie
Down Productions, has released

an album that injects some needed integrity back
into rap music.
"Sex and Violence" is pure, unadulterated hip
hop. A true rapper doesn't need 20 dancers, baggy

pants and samples of
proven hits like "Super
Freak" and "When Doves
Cry" to get over: all he or
she needs is a funky
breakbeat, a microphone
and dope lyrics. KRS-One,
by scaling back on the pro
duction, does the genre a
favor by returning it to its
old school roots.
"The Original Way"
sets the agenda for the

rest of the LP. The kickin' 808 beat, the strains of
a ska record and KRS-One's verbal toasting take
the listener all the way back to the South Bronx.
KRS-One gives "no respect to a commercial DJ"
and shouts out only to fellow hardcore artists.
"Duck Down" is a throwback to the days when
winning a rap battle meant saving one's reputation
and body from a beatdown. Kris rips sucka DJ's to
shreds over an agitated bass line and rugged break
beats.
"Build and Destroy" finds KRS-One dissing
those "blabbering fuckin' fools" who have used
message-conscious rap as a means to further them
selves rather than uplifting humanity. He also
urges Muslims in the Five Percent Nation to get
beyond blaming the "devil" white man for every-

'If you just do rap without its
culture or rebellious meaning,
you fail to advance rap. You
only advance your pocket.'
- KRS-One

thing and instead acknowledge devils within the
black community. "The white man ain't the devil, I
promise/You wanna see the devil, take a look at
Clarence Thomas."
"Ruff Ruff," "Poisonous Products," "We In
There," "Drug Dealer" and "How Not to Get

Jerked" are also songs
that perpetuate the
hardcore quality of the
album. Solid produc
tion by Pal Joey, Prince
Paul and Kenny Parker
keep the beats rugged
and the bass lines
funky. KRS, on all
accounts, proves that
his "metaphysics"
haven't interfered with
his ability to kick a

verse with the hardest of the hardcore.
"Sex and Violence" is easily the best BDP album
since "Criminal Minded." It's a funky mix of social
ly conscious lyrics, humor and much-needed criti
cism about the commercialized aspect of the rap
music industry. The production, reduced to the
barest essentials, proves that samples should sup
port instead of compensate for lyrical skills. Rap
that's devoid of integrity is meaningless.
Perhaps "The Teacher" himself says it best: "If
you just do rap without its culture or rebellious
meaning, you fail to advance rap. You only advance
your pocket."
For rap to survive another 20 years, all other
rappers, like Kris Parker, must never sacrifice
quality for commercialism.
