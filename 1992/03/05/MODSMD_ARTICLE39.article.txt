"You gotta make [rap] mean
something. . . . People who
fraudulate, who write butt
lyrics and think the tracks can
get you over, that's cool, but
what's gonna happen if you
don't have no more beats to
sample, and you ain't a musi

Rap is out of control. The
raw, uncompromising ghetto
music that many critics dis
missed as a passing fad has
been around for nearly 20
years. Every major record com

artists often use elements of
the genre to spice up otherwise

however, has been simultane

to the art form. While the
artists are finally earning their
due respect, compensation and

worldwide recognition, a lot of
B.S. records are being released.
Just about any fool who can
loop an old Issac Hayes break,

Williams and Marky Mark,
among other commercialized
artists who can barely rhyme,
are selling millions of records
as "rappers," while the Busta
Rhymes, Grand Puba Maxwells
and Q-Tips of the world go
unrecognized by the general
public . This deluge of mediocre
talent, pushed by major finan
cial support, is leading to the
downfall of the genre.
That is, until the "teacher"
returned to bring back mea
sures of quality control to the
new school of hip-hop.

circles as KRS-One, is a rapper
