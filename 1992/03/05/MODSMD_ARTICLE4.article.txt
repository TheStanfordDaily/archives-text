For their efforts in everything from
preventing sexual assault to coordi
nating advising programs and charity
fundraisers, 10 students were recog
nized last night as the fall and winter
quarter recipients of the James W.
Lyons Award for Service.
Dean of Students Michael Jackson

presented undergraduates Traci
Baird, Sarah Birkeland, Brian Cook,
Tracy Goode, Joy St. John, Solina
Kwan, Dmitri Mehlhorn, James Wu
and Rolando Zeledon with the award.
Baird, a senior in human biology,
was commended for her "multi
faceted commitment to issues of cam
pus safety" through her work on such
programs as Project HEAR (Heighten
ing Education on Acquaintance Rape),
the Sexual Assault Task Force and the
Special Services Unit of the Stanford
Police.
She was nominated by Susan
Epstein, coordinator of Sexual Assault,
Prevention, Education and Referral
Resources.
Sophomores Birkeland and Cook
accepted the award on behalf of the
1990-91 residents of Trancos who
worked last year to support the Cre
ative Adventures Learning Center.
Dorm residents tutored at the cen
ter and organized "Operation Lily
pad," a 10-day, 1,000-mile leap-frog
ging event that broke the world's
record and raised $10,000 for the
after-school learning program located
in East Palo Alto.
They were nominated by Trancos
resident fellow Barbara Mendelsohn
and former resident assistant David
Chang.

Goode and Wu, who have served as
resident assistants in Roble Hall, were
honored for their "amazing level of
commitment, energy and accomplish
ment in their residential settings — as
house officers, RAs, Orientation coor
dinators, and both formal and infor
mal advisers."
Kwan was recognized for her
involvement in the ASSU. A senior in
economics and history, she has served
as senate chair and as a member of the
Cabinet Committee on Budget and
Strategic Planning. Fellow senior Kris
Carpenter, who nominated Kwan,
noted her "keen ability to bring people
and organizations together."
St. John received the award for her
efforts in coordinating the advising
associate program last year and for
volunteering for Sophomore Celebra
tion and Centennial Week activities.
Lee, a senior majoring in interna
tional relations, was nominated by
Greg Ricks, multicultural educator for
Residential Education, Virginia Mac of
the Career Planning and Placement
Center and Rick Yuen, assistant dean
of students.
The nominators cited Lee's work in
organizing the orientation program
"Faces of Community" and her lead
ership in the Asian American Activi
ties Center as a few of several reasons

why she deserved the award.
For "his dogged determination to
save the moribund Stanford Debate
Society," Mehlhorn was nominated by
students Helen Chen, Bob Hohman
and Bradford Carter Johnson.
In addition, Mehlhorn, a senior in
political science, has actively recruited
freshman debaters and has served as a


Dmitri Mehlhorn


Mae Lee
volunteer coach for local high
school debate teams.
As co-founder of the Latino
Student Association and a leader
in the Society of Chicano/Latino
Engineers and Scientists, Zeledon
was praised for encouraging stu
dents to become involved in the
activities of El Centro Chicano.
Zeledon has also been an
advising associate, a board mem
ber of the Stanford Engineering
Association and a member of Bal
let Folkorico de Stanford.
The award, which is given quar
terly, was established to recognize
service contributions made by
Stanford students. All enrolled
students are eligible for the award.
