# Hurling rice, toast in movie theaters
## 
### Erin Jordan 
It's about 12:30 on a Saturday night.
The streetlights on University Avenue have
been turned off and the quiet town of Palo
Alto seems to have closed down for the
evening. But here at the Varsity Theater,
the fun has just begun as the reels start to
roll "The Rocky Horror Picture Show."
Still recovering from the rice-throwing
war I had with the total stranger two rows
in front of me, I manage to yell something
to the hero of the film about castles not
having phones or something. Then, all of
a sudden the music starts and RifT-Raff
introduces the "Time Warp":
"It's astounding."
"No it's not. It's a skeleton!" is the
response from some lively audience mem
bers.
"Time is fleeting. Madness takes its
toll."
"Ding! Dong!" The next thing I know,
everybody is rushing into the aisles to put
their hands on their hips and join the
actors in doing the Pelvic Thrust.
Normally, such outbursts by audience
members would be greeted with angry
glares and an escort to the nearest exit by
an annoyed management. But here, the

interruptions are encouraged. They're
even mandatory. In fact, that's what this
whole experience is all about.
This strange cult phenomena has a
simple history. Basically, this successful
British musical was converted into an
American movie, but the distribution
company for the film could only book it at
houses that would play it at midnight.
Oddly enough, people did attend, and the
producers thought the film was actually
doing good business â€” until they were
told that the audience consisted of the
same people every week, and that these
people knew the movie so well that they
were talking back to the screen. It was the
beginning of the Rocky Horror tradition.
It grew from there to include a full stage
show consisting of a group of actors in
front of the screen imitating the characters
as well as augmenting their actions with
some hilarious variations. Audience partic
ipation now spans everything from yelling
at the screen to throwing rice at each
other during the opening wedding scene.
And there are no rules. Of course,
there are the standard chants and
responses that all Rocky Horror partici
pants must learn, but people are always
improvising. Even first-timers can catch

on pretty quick.
And for those of you who haven't been
yet, how can you pass up the chance to
see Susan Sarandon in her only musical
role before her gun-toting days of "Thel
ma and Louise"?
The Varsity is a great place to go to
The Show if you just want to see what all
the fuss is about, but it lacks the hard
core experience that any true Rocky Hor
ror fan is after. The Varsity doesn't allow
water guns or squirt bottles, so there is
no rain during the storm scene. Lighters
aren't allowed either. However, they do
allow the rice, toast and hot dogs, and
their stage show is pretty good.
The Show is bound to be an experi
ence unlike anything you're used to. It's
even rather twisted if you really think
about it, but then you'd be missing the
whole point. This is a perfect chance to
get together a group of friends who are
feeling especially rambunctious on a Sat
urday night and spend two hours being
lewd, crude and totally rude.

"The Rocky Horror Picture Show"plays
at the Varsity Theater every Saturday at
midnight, accompanied by the stage
show group Erotic Nightmares.
