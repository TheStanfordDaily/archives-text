# Stale plot trounces 'Gladiator'
## 
### Victor Haseman Staff writer 
Usually the worst thing
about a boxing flick is the pre
dictable, sappy conclusion. Let's
face it, after Rocky stumbled
around the ring calling for his
woman, Hollywood rewrote the
book on celluloid prize fighting.
However, you know you're
watching a wanna-be when an
entire audience starts chanting
"Adrian ... Adrian" in a pseu
do-Brooklyn accent.
This was the unfortunate
fate of director Rowdy Herring
ton's newly released "Gladia
tor."
In his film debut, James Mar
shall of "Twin Peaks" plays
Tommy Riley, a misplaced sub
urban kid living in the worst
part of Chicago.
His father's sales job and
gambling debts leave Tommy
alone for the majority of the
movie, and it is on his own that
he runs into racial tensions, a
romantic interest and the
underground amateur boxing
world of promoter Mr. Horn
(Brian Dennehy).
After setting these elements
in motion, Tommy and black
buddy Abraham Lincoln Hayes
(Cuba Gooding of "Boyz 'n the
Hood") trot through the film's
remaining 50 minutes, annihi
lating the competition until
Horn, in search of a "Great
White Hope," sets up a bout
between the white boy and the
black boy.
As you might guess, the pre
dictability inherent in Lyle
Kessler's screenplay gives Mar
shall and Gooding little room to
interpret their excessively
stereotyped roles.
Furthermore, barring both
actors' athletic build, few char
acteristics distinguish them as
suitable choices. Gooding per
forms a variation of his Tre
character from "Boyz 'n the

Hood," while Marshall seems to
mimic Gooding. Marshall comes
off like a cross between Chris
tian Slater and Val Kilmer. It's
no wonder Lincoln nicknamed
Tommy "Shadow."
Perhaps the most disturbing
aspect of the film is that every
able-bodied young man, in one
way or another, is involved in
Horn's boxing circuit. It may
have been a bit more believable
if they didn't all go to the same
high school.
As for direction, Herrington's
technique is decidedly negligi

ble, though the flick's boxing
scenes succeed as a group of
visual metaphors on the
destruction of the human brain.
However, we can thank boxing
choreographer Jimmy Nicker
son ("Rocky" and "Raging
Bull") for this.
The really awful thing about
this film is that, unless you real
ly can't stand watching a good
guy and a really bad guy beat
each other to a blood}' pulp, you
get drawn into the flick's action.
Save this one for a Saturday
night Blockbuster run.
