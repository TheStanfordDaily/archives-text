# After freak accident, Chevy Chase is transparent — and so is his movie

It's tempting to take a cheap shot at "Memoirs of
an Invisible Man," poking fun at its "invisible" plot
and "zero-dimensional" characters. But then again,
"Invisible Man" never promises to be an intellectual
bombshell, and if you lower your expectations, the
movie can be mindlessly entertaining and moderate
ly amusing.
"Invisible Man" is the story of San Francisco

stock analyst Nick Hol
loway (Chevy Chase).
Nick passes out in the
sauna at a high-tech
research facility after
drinking too much the
night before, sleeps
through a freak industrial
accident — caused by a
careless worker who
spilled a cup of coffee on
his keyboard — and

wakes up to find himself invisible.
Instead of helping Nick restore his visibility, evil
CIA operative David Jenkins (Sam Neill) wants to
use him as the ultimate spy. When Nick refuses, the
manhunt begins.
Alice Monroe (Daryl Hannah), the blond knock
out Nick meets before he disappears, becomes his
sole confidante, and the two plot their escape.
While the film officially gives Chase and Hannah
top billing, the real star is special effects provider
Industrial Light & Magic, the same outfit that revo
lutionized the industry in "Terminator 2."
Though Nick's body is invisible, the food he
ingests and the cigarette smoke he inhales are not.
In one of the most revolting vomit scenes on screen,
Nick sees his stomach digesting the leftover Chi
nese dinner he just ate, and then proceeds to throw
it up.

ers draw closer to Nick, he is forced to switch to a
diet of clear food — bullion and vodka.
In one of the most impressive uses of special
effects, the outline of Nick's invisible body is illumi
nated by rain as the water droplets reflect the
images around him.
The invisibility theme leads to a host of pre
dictable — though still funny and clever — special
effect tricks, like a pair of shorts and a headband jog
ging down a beach.
The weakest spots in the movie are where it

attempts to be dramat
ic and deep.
Nick's physical
invisibility is actually
the outward manifes
tation of his emotional
condition before the
accident. As Jenkins
remarks, he was invisi
ble before he became
invisible.
Nick is a man with

no family and no real close friends. No one realizes
he's missing except for Alice, who thinks he's stood
her up for lunch, and his secretary, who believes
he's out with the flu.
The movie attempts to make some poignant
points about the need to be recognized, but never
follows through on them.
The most unbelievable part of the movie is Alice's
sudden devotion to Nick after only spending a brief,
although impassioned, 15 minutes with him in the
ladies' room.
Their relationship is based on nothing, and it is
difficult to take their emotions for each other very
seriously. The chemistry between them is poor, and
goofy one-liners like Nick's "Women always used to
say they could see right through me" do not help to
deepen their bond.
Although it's neither deep nor moving, "Invisible
Man" is worth seeing, if only for the special effects.
