# Stunning blend of performance, video pushes limits of drama
## 
### Mike Curry Staff writer 
If you've ever tried to watch
television while driving a car,
you'll begin to get an idea of what

it's like to watch "The Laborato
ry of Hallucinations."
Matthew Causey, a graduate
student in drama, presents "Lab
oratory" as the latest addition to
his dramatic series, "The History

of the Avant-garde." It follows up
last year'B "Kill The Dog."
Not your run-of-the-mill
Shakespearean tragedy, "Labora
tory" is a dramatic experiment in
which traditional drama meshes

with MTV. Supplementing the
play's actors and their dialogue
are four prominent video moni
tors, a booming sound system,
two synthesizers and a camera
man supplying live video.
These technical goodies add a
punch to the pop-culture video
clips and songs that Causey uses
to add meaning to his creation.
Based mainly on Jean Genet's
1947 play, "The Maids," "Labora
tory" includes clips of Hitchcock
movies, interviews with the Man
son family, documentaries on the
Black Panthers, cuts from the
movie "Hairspray," songs from
the movie "Batman" and even
hilarious video splices of Sally
Jessie Raphael.
"Laboratory" is not framed on
a traditional plot structure.
Instead, pieces of different source
texts are chaotically woven into
several competing narratives.
Although "Laboratory" doesn't
attempt to provide answers,
Causey's play does explores how
we view ourselves through images
and how images change us. His
play also challenges our ideas of
artistic originality and questions
image ownership.
But with an eclectic format of
video and live acting, these
themes and many others are not
obvious.
Jumping more quickly than a

music video from the disturbing
(actors vomiting) to the comedic (a
Sinatra lip-sync), "Laboratory" is
often confusing and hard to digest.
We seem to be transported into a
Warhol-esque nightmare loaded
with cultural icons. Nevertheless,

this disorder is Causey's goal.
Admitting that "Laboratory"
is a challenging puzzle for the
spectator, Causey explains, "If we
have 85 people in the audience, I
want them to leave with 85 inter
pretations."
