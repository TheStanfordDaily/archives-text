# Mascot migrates to San Jose

San Jose Sharks mascot Dean
Schoenfield is the rather brave
fish who gambled $25,000 of his
own money that the team's
management would take to
sushi running around the
stands.
That's right. Schoenfield
didn't even ask them first; he
just showed up Jan. 2, dressed to
kill, walked into their office and
said, "Try me out." And so they
did.
After two games Schoenfield
and the management started
negotiating, and this mascot was
hatched.
It was a big risk for Schoen
field. He had to prove he could
improve an already good situa
tion.
The Sharks were selling out
(their games, that is) and already
led the league in merchandise
sales.
But the management felt the
mascot really added something,
and he does.
If you go to a game, you can't
miss the shark. This fish dances,
bites people's heads off, throws
popcorn on opposing fans.
He's a riot. He said his follow
ers should "look for bungee jump
ing off the ceiling" some day.
Putting on these antics is a rigor
ous business.
He says he loses 10-12 pounds
per game (that smell isn't sup
posed to be simulated shark).
Schoenfield has also been the
Philadelphia eagle for 13 years.
"I'll be commuting," he said.
"I'll be fowl on the East Coast and
marine life on the West." Come
warm weather, the fish will go
fowl.

San Jose Sharks mascot Dean Schoenfield may run around in
endangered-animal skin, but that didn't seem to bother these young
hockey fans at last Wednesday's game against the Nordiques.
