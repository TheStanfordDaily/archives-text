# Menlo resident making a stink
## He says retirement complex will suffocate neighborhood 
### John Ford Staff writer 
Stanford's proposed retirement community is
already facing its first challenge — and his name is
Bill Watson.
Watson said he and other Menlo Park residents
are opposed to the University's retirement complex,
which would consist of up to 400 condominiums and
750 apartments on a 72-acre site near the Stanford
Shopping Center.
The proposal will be the subject of public hear
ings in about nine months, and then it will be con
sidered by the Palo Alto City Council.
The complex will add to the "tremendous densi
ty" of construction and traffic on West Campus,
Watson said. Although the University has pledged
to respect a 16-acre archaeological preserve around
San Francisquito Creek, Watson said the buildings
would take away much-needed open space.
He said large increases in traffic and noise pollu
tion are his greatest concerns.
Andy Doty, Stanford's director of community
relations, said the University wasn't surprised by
Watson's challenge. Doty said he remains convinced
that "reasonable people would realize Stanford has
a right to build on that land."
Current zoning laws allow the 72-acre plot to be
used for housing.
According to Doty, the retirement project is "con
sistent with Palo Alto's interests" because it would
help relieve the local housing shortage. Doty said he
is optimistic about the project's success.
But Watson said he believes the City Council will
reject the project because the council has been
"extremely reasonable in the past."
He added that if the project does get approval, his
group will go to court to stop it.
A previous Stanford proposal for the extension of
Sand Hill Road to El Camino Real was halted by a
similar challenge brought by local residents.
Palo Alto Mayor Gary Sazzino said that the
years-old debate over Sand Hill Road may be
reopened because of the proposal for the retirement
complex.
The University has tried for several years to
extend the road, which currently dead-ends in the
Stanford Shopping Center's parking lot, causing
daily traffic bottlenecks. Palo Alto residents have
successfully opposed the proposal, arguing that the
extension would send hundreds of cars across El
Camino Real onto Alma Street.
The University has since re-initiated the project
