Crooks had good year
Thefts from campus residences,
offices and vehicles increased this year,
according to police.
"There are a lot of crooks afoot who will
relieve you of your property quite easily,"
said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Over the past two months, 149 bicy
cles were stolen; 88 were stolen during
the same period last year. Bicycle theft
had already increased 28 percent from
1990 to 1991.
More thefts were also reported in
offices and dormitories. As of Jan. 1, vic
tims had reported 12 workplace thefts
and 13 dorm thefts.
Niemeyer said thieves concentrate on
lifting wallets, purses, cash and credit
cards, though such items as expensive
pen-and-pencil sets and video equip
ment have also been taken.
Fifty cases of theft from a vehicle
have been reported. Niemeyer said that
about 46 of those thefts involved stereo
equipment and such related accessories
as speakers and music. Skis and cellular
phones have also been taken this year.
Motor vehicle thefts also increased
between 1990 and 1991.

Virus paints bleak picture
Michelangelo is making the most of
his 15 minutes of fame.
The computer virus — named for the
artist on whose March 6 birthday it is
programmed to erase hard drives

around the world — was identified yes
terday on five computers in the Political
Science Department, according to Bill
Barodell, information security officer at
the Data Center.
Before yesterday, the only known
cases of Michelangelo at Stanford were
found at the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center.
Staff in the department identified the
virus while they were running software
to protect against it, Barodell said.
The deadly computer virus is pro
grammed to erase the hard disks of IBM
personal computers and PC-compatibles
on Friday.
There are between 3,000 and 4,000
IBM PCs used on campus, Barodell esti
mated.
As the deadline for the virus draws
closer, Stanford faculty and staff are
getting increasingly nervous about
Michelangelo.
Barodell said he has received numer
ous calls regarding the virus in the past
two days. Hundreds of faculty and staff
have been using the anti-virus software,
according to Barodell.
Barodell is warning users to run anti
virus software and make backup copies
of their hard disks. He discourages alter
native ways of coping with the virus,
such as changing the date on a comput
er or not turning a computer on during
March 6.
The virus does not affect Macintosh
computers.
