# How to bypass a DR:
## CIV to exempt transfers, burden fewer lecturers 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Future transfer students will not take Cul
tures, Ideas and Values if the Faculty Senate
approves a current budget-reduction proposal.
The proposal would replace the require
ment that transfer students take CIV with
one that they take three quarters of upper
level classes on subjects similar to those
studied in CIV, said History Prof. Paul
Seaver, chair of the Area One Committee.
That would save money by distributing
the transfer students among regular cours
es and reducing the number of lecturers
needed for CIV, said Senior Assoc. Dean
Carolyn Lougee.
Currently about 100 transfer students
take CIV each year. The proposal would
allow the school to cut back "about a lec
turer and a half," according to Lougee.
The loss would be absorbed by adjusting
the number of students and lecturers in
each CIV track. Lougee said she did not
know which tracks would be affected.
She said the change will likely be in
effect by fall quarter. It must first be
approved by the Area One Committee and

the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
then voted on by the senate this spring.
The change "has both academic and
financial gain to it," Lougee said, because
"transfer students have not found CIV at
the right level for them."
Engineering Assoc. Dean David Frey
berg, chair of the Committee on Under
graduate Studies, said, "CIV faculty have
argued that when a transfer student goes
into a class with all freshmen, the student
either tends not to participate due to bore
dom or fear of intimidating the class, or
participates and intimidates the class."
Seaver agreed. "Transfer students are
upperclassmen and generally don't fit in
very well in a freshman course," he said. "I
would assume the majority would want to
take more advanced courses."
Lougee said that a transfer student who
wanted to take CIV could still do so on a
space-available basis. "The intention is not
to rob the transfer student of the CIV expe
rience," she said, "but to give the student
more options."
The idea to eliminate CIV for transfer
students originated last fall in discussions
of the Area One Committee, Freyberg said.
