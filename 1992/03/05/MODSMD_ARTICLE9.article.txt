Aides say Kerrey will quit
WASHINGTON (AP) — Nebraska Sen. Bob
Kerrey told Democratic colleagues yesterday he
was abandoning his campaign for the Democrat
ic presidential nomination, a Senate aide said.
"He's going to announce tomorrow that he's
pulling out," said the aide to a senator who
attended a meeting Kerrey had with Democrat
ic senators and supporters yesterday in the
Capitol. The aide requested anonymity.
Kerrey scheduled a news conference for this
morning in Washington and a welcome home
rally later in Omaha.
A close aide to Kerrey, insisting on anonymity,
said Kerrey would quit the race barring a last
minute influx of financial and political support.
And Leo Perrotta, his Rhode Island cam
paign manager, who was preparing for the
March 10 primary there, said, "Kerrey is drop
ping out of the race."
"They've shut down all their outlying offices,"
said another Democrat who insisted on anonymi
ty. "Apparently they've got a $1 million debt."
Kerrey was the only Democratic candidate who
did not chalk up a victory Tuesday night. And he
was at or near the bottom in every contest — 5
percent in Georgia and Maryland, 8 percent in
Idaho, 11 percent in Utah, 12 percent in Colorado
Asked Tuesday night where he expected to
win in next week's multiple Super Tuesday cau
cuses and primaries, Kerrey replied, "Nowhere."
Infertility doctor convicted
ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — To some women,
Cecil Jacobson remains a godsend, a "wonder
ful" and dedicated medical pioneer who helped
them bear children when all other hope seemed
lost. Others say the physician's conviction yes
terday on 52 counts of fraud and perjury was
exactly what he deserved.
After deliberating four days, a federal jury
found the former infertility specialist guilty of
every charge in the bizarre case, including the
fraudulent use of his own sperm to inseminate
patients and lying to other women about
whether they were pregnant.
Jacobson, 55, could face a prison sentence of
up to 280 years and a fine of up to $500,000. He
was expressionless as the lengthy verdict was
announced, but later told reporters "I spent my
life trying to help women have children. It's a
shock to be found guilty of trying to help people."
"I have no scheme. ... I did not break any
law," Jacobson said. His sentencing was sched
uled for May 8.
