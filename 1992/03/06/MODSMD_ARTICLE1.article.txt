# Storage in summer to be cut back

Students in many dormitories will no longer
be able to store their belongings at Stanford
during the summer because of budget cuts in
the Office of Residential Education.
Beginning in 1993, summer storage will be
cancelled in Wilbur Hall, Stern Hall, Florence
Moore Hall, Roble Hall, Lagunita Court and
possibly Toyon Hall and parts of Governor's
Corner, according to Associate Res Ed Director
Elizabeth Hiyama.
In addition, restrictions will be placed on
storage during the school year. Students will
not have access to storage areas except at the
beginning and end of each quarter and around
vacations such as Thanksgiving, Hiyama said.

Ed will not have to pay for storage room atten

and during the academic year, Hiyama said.
She said she did not know how much money
will be saved by the change.
Storage in residences where attendants are
not needed, such as the Suites, will not be
affected.
Res Ed had originally planned to cancel stor

Advising Committee convinced the office to
delay the move, according to Council of Presi
dents member John Overdeck.
Hiyama said the decision is justified because
many students already go off-campus for sum

its. "Storage just gets crowded so quickly and
there were many students who were unable to
use it. It just has not been a service that has
been good for students," she said.
But COP member John Louie disagreed, say
ing, "Stanford does a good job of attracting stu
dents from around the world. To suddenly renege
on its promise of summer storage is unacceptable."
"The cost of shipping stuff back and forth is
exorbitant," he added.
Overdeck said he does not see "why storing
stuff in empty rooms is so expensive."
"It is a great convenience on campus. If it is
