## 
### June Fang Staff writer 
Stanford Art Museum officials yesterday
estimated the value of the Karuk Indian bas
kets stolen earlier this week at more than
$50,000.
They also said they would let the matter
drop if the baskets are returned immediately.
"We deplore this theft and hope that the
perpetrator will return the objects to the
museum immediately, and we will accept
them without asking any questions," said Art
Museum Director Thomas Seligman.

Though the baskets have not been
appraised, Seligman said similar baskets have
sold at art auctions in the past for $2,000 to
$4,000 dollars apiece.
The museum has alerted the FBI, local
police and local art dealers about the miss
ing baskets, hoping to make it as difficult as
possible for the thieves to sell the stolen
goods.
The baskets were made by the Karuk tribe
of Northern California and are decorated with
geometric patterns and designs. A total of 18
baskets dating from the late 1880s were stolen
from a display in the Anthropology Depart-

ment between 10 p.m. Tuesday and 8 a.m.
Wednesday.
Fourteen of the baskets were "basketry
hats" worn by tribal women. They are about 9
to 10 inches in diameter. Of the other four,
two are flat, circular trays.
The baskets were commonly used items
and were "never intended to be ceremonial,"
said Seligman.
Almost all of the baskets have been part of
the Jane Stanford Collection since the Univer
sity's founding. They were on loan to the
Anthropology Department for an educational
display when the theft occurred.
