## A 						cynical tokenism 
### 
While speaker will be
excellent, selecting him is
ironic after cuts to arts

KIRK VARNEDOE, this year's
commencement speaker, is a
person with impressive cre
dentials.
Art Prof. Albert Elsen, who was
Varnedoe's adviser when he attend
ed Stanford in the early 19705, said
the art scholar now holds "the sin
gle most important position in the
world of modern art."
As director of the Department of
Painting and Sculpture at New
York's Museum of Modern Art,
Varnedoe oversees one of the
world's foremost art collections,
and has created provocative exhibi
tions that challenge some of the
restricting conventions in art today.
Varnedoe's selection is welcome.
He should be an intriguing speaker,
regardless of some seniors' tire
some, predictable complaints that
he lacks instant name recognition.
Their yearly groaning should be
ignored, and is symptomatic of a
misguided insecurity that makes
any speaker other than a "big
name" automatically unacceptable.
But regardless of Varnedoe's
undeniable value as a speaker, the
University's selection of him — in
a year in which the arts were
degraded and severely cut in the
budget-cutting process — smacks
of a cynical tokenism.
University President Donald
Kennedy, in announcing the selec
tion, said, "It's an appropriate
time for Stanford to recognize the
importance of the arts, and we're
lucky to have a Stanford graduate
of Varnedoe's stature to help us."
"Help" is exactly what Kennedy
was looking for when he chose
Varnedoe from an unranked list of
other candidates. Selecting Varne
doe was a convenient way to main
tain a facade of supporting the arts,
while allowing them to be slashed
and contorted into previously

unthinkable shapes.
The music performance doctor
al program was completely elimi
nated this year, effectively ending
Stanford students' opportunities
to perform music in an intellectu
al, University-supported setting.
The drama department — con
sidered for complete closure earli
er in the year but saved by an
effective grass roots campaign —
was cut 30 percent and is now
struggling to make that reduction
without crippling its ability to
teach the dramatic arts effectively.
One-quarter of the department's
tenured faculty positions will be
lost, and several senior lecturers
and acting faculty may also be told
to find another place to work.
The department is considering
scaling back the number of big pro
ductions and switching to smaller,
less elaborate productions instead.
And students may have to go
somewhere other than Stanford to
learn about the technical side of
theater, as set design and produc
tion are being considered for dras
tic reductions.
Simply selecting a speaker
involved in the arts does not atone
for budget-cutting decisions that
will have devastating effects on the
arts at Stanford for years to come,
and will severely curtail students'
opportunities to study the arts here.
The University must find con
crete ways to protect the arts at
Stanford, rather than making
meaningless public relations moves
that do nothing to prevent the con
tinued degradation of the arts.
The bureaucratic nonsense of
"not central to the University's
academic mission" cannot be
allowed to overcome real concerns
about the people — especially
those involved in the arts — whose
lives will be changed by the deci
sions made this year.
And hopefully, in his speech
June 14, Kirk Varnedoe — who
sent letters defending the photog
raphy program when it was consid
ered for closure earlier this year —
will challenge the University to
renew its commitment to the arts.
