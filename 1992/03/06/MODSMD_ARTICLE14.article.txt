Chairman must separate personal views from group 9 s

IN HIS MARCH 2 LETTER to The
Daily, IFC Rush Chairman Matt
Moran selfishly jeopardizes the posi
tive and non-discriminatory image that
fraternal organizations on this and other
university campuses have worked so
hard to achieve.
He accuses both the Black Student
Union and MEChA, the Chicano/Latino
student group, of "brainwashing fresh
men" to believe that the Greek system is
''racist, sexist and homophobic."
I, as a member of MEChA, am sin
cerely disappointed to find that so many
Stanford students are in fact associating
Moran's ignorant and unmerited attacks
on the BSU and MEChA with all IFC
organizations.
Though Moran, like Keith Rabois or

any other individual, is certainly entitled
to his opinion, he should however make
it clear that his attacks on student
groups do not necessarily reflect the
opinion of the IFC. And the IFC should
likewise publish a statement disassociat
ing itself from such destructive and pos
sibly racist comments.
Both MEChA and the BSU have his
torically and do continue to promote
diversity on this campus and in the sur
rounding community. Like other Chi
cano student groups at colleges and uni
versities throughout the nation, the
Stanford MEChA has been at the fore
front in addressing issues like accessibil
ity and financial aid.
Here on campus, MEChA, in con
junction with other Chicano/Latino

student groups — Casa Zapata, El Cen
tro Chicano and the ASSU Program
Board — has always worked hard to
reach out to the Stanford community
by organizing cultural and educational
events and activities throughout the
year.
Annual events sponsored by MEChA
and the Chicano/Latino community here
at Stanford include Dia de los Muertos,
Zoot Suit Week, student talent shows
and the Cinco de Mayo celebration. All
events are open to and well attended by
many Stanford students.
It is therefore unfortunate that
Moran should attempt to discredit the
community-building efforts of groups
like the BSU and MEChA by hurling
wholly false accusations at them.

In his letter, Moran says he is proud
"to be a Greek member and to be asso
ciated with other Greeks on this cam
pus". I too am proud to know a num
ber of Greeks and am extremely
pleased to have had many an opportu
nity to discuss both the merits and
shortcomings of the Greek system with
them.
It would seem, however, that Mr.
Moran has not been so fortunate. I
would therefore urge him to get out and
meet more people, particularly non
Greeks. And hell, why not even a
MEChista or two!!
Who knows, you may actually discov
er that we're pretty decent people.
