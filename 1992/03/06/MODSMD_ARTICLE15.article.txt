# MEChA has no policy against Greek system
## 
### 
In attempting to show that Omar
Wasow's stereotype of the Greek system
is unfair, other student groups such as
MEChA, the Chicano/Latino student
group, were submitted to the same gen
eralizations.
For example, one letter in the March
2 Daily accused MEChA of "continual
assault(s) on ... and the brainwashing
of freshmen" against the Greek system
and of placing barriers for the system to
expand "its diversity."
As an active member of the Chicano/
Latino community and as a freshman, I am
deeply disturbed by such allegations.
Just as Wasow was encouraged to "re
evaluate his problem of continually
stereotyping and generalizing people," I
encourage all those who have stereo
types of MEChA and the Chicano/Latino
community to do the same.
I feel that people outside of the orga
nization make many false assumptions

about MEChA and its policies. It is
against the ideology of MEChA to dis
courage any system from attaining diver
sity. MEChA does not have a policy that
discourages the Greek system nor has it
ever been implied in principle or practice.
Prejudices against the Greek system's
"selectivity" prevail in people from all
backgrounds, not just individuals in
organizations such as MEChA and the
Black Student Union.
I hope that before we make general
izations, we are all well-informed and we
do not make statements on unfounded
assumptions which can stigmatize orga
nizations and individuals.
