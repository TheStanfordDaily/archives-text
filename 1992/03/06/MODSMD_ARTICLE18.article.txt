## Consider the Eritreans 
### 
IMAGINE A COUNTRY where people
have to conceal themselves from
deadly bombing raids by living at
night or under trees. Where an under
ground hospital 5 kilometers long pro
duces high-tech pharmaceuticals. Where
a 30-year foreign occupation has finally
ended in the people's freedom.
The land that you are imagining is
Eritrea, where the Eritrean People's Lib
eration Front expelled the last of the
troops loyal to Ethiopia's former ruthless
dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam, shortly
after his fall from power last spring.
A formal referendum next year is
expected to ratify independence until
which time the fighters of the EPLF have
agreed, without pay, to help reforge the
country's institutions.
Reliable sources estimate that more
than 50,000 people, mostly innocent
Eritrean civilians, were killed during
Ethiopia's 30-year direct occupation and
massive bombing of the country.
Yemani Gedde and his wife Margaret
have been the driving force behind the
Stanford Medical Aid Committee for
Eritrea, which has organized numerous
symposiums at Stanford, and has sent
books and medical supplies to Eritrea.
SMAC planned a massive demonstration
during Gorbachev's visit to Stanford,
protesting Soviet military aid to the
Mengistu regime.
Yemani is elated at the recent turn of

events: "I am very proud to be an
Eritrean, a country which is finally free.
I am overwhelmingly happy that after
30 years, my dream has finally come
true."
Tewolde Stefanos, a former Stanford
student living in Sunnyvale, recently
spent three months in his native
Eritrea. He was amazed by the region's
progress since its liberation, and the
pragmatism of the EPLF's policies,
which focus on promoting rural develop
ment and protecting the environment.
He believes the EPLF's strongest asset
is their popular backing: "The people's
support was the main factor in the
EPLF's victory."
Both he and fellow Eritrean Issayas
Mariam, of Stanford's Hoover Institu
tion, underline the irony of current peace
and exceptional security throughout the
country after decades of warfare and suf
fering. As for the Amhara group, which
traditionally dominated Ethiopia, Issayas
says they will have to get used to an inde
pendent Eritrea. "The game is over" for
them, he said.
The Eritreans are not the only people
bitter over Mengistu's violent, arbitrary
rule. Stanford doctoral candidate Awetu
Simesso is from the long-oppressed
Oromo ethno-linguistic group, which he
stresses forms the majority of Ethiopia's
population.
The Red Terror campaign staged by

'The Red Ter
ror campaign
staged by
Mengistu's sup
porters horri
fied many
Ethiopeans.'

Mengistu's supporters horrified many
Ethiopians and led Awetu, a journalist at
the time, to escape the country in 1977.
While groups such as the Oromo Lib
eration Front remain skeptical of the new
government's capacity to look after
Oromo interests, other Ethiopians, such
as an anonymous Bay Area resident from
Addis Ababa, are optimistic.
Coming from the Tigray ethnicity, of
which President Meles Zinawi is a mem
ber, the resident is confident that
Mengistu's fall — and a conference that
dealt with the nationality question last
July — will allow Ethiopia to move for
ward, in a manner agreeable to all of its
different groups.
While Eritrea has unquestionably
asserted its independence, and now
moves toward progress and development,
Ethiopia will have to undergo an impor
tant re-examination. As Awetu pointed
out, disenfranchised groups such as the
Oromos must be given recognition as
part of an absolute democratization and
decentralization process, if Ethiopia is to
remain a united country.

Paul Namphy supports worldwide self
determination.
