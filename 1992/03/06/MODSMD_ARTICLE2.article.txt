# Library to see major changes
## Meyer will be reorganized 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
Meyer Library will get a new look this summer as
most of the books are condensed onto the third floor
and media services moves into an expanded space on
the second floor.
In addition, about 65 Green Library employees
will moved to Meyer's fourth floor and the circula
tion and reserves desks will be placed on the ground
floor, Meyer director Michael Miller said.
Green's technical services department will vacate
its current space in the west wing so damages from the
1989 earthquake can be repaired, according to Joan
Krasner, head of Green's access services department.
Technical services, which is responsible for cata
loging books and processing orders for books and jour
nals, will remain on Meyer's fourth floor until recon
struction of Green's west wing is completed in 1995.
Miller said Meyer's fourth floor collection will be
moved to the third floor, where shelving will be
rearranged to create more space for the collection.
Joe Leggette, a library specialist at Meyer, said
that while the new arrangement may not be "aes-
thetically pleasing" to students,
placing the bulk of Meyer's collec
tion on one floor could be more
convenient.
But "it may give the appear
ance of being more crowded on
the third floor," he said.
Meyer's collection has shrunk
during the last three years
because budget cuts have pre
vented the library from buying
new books, while outdated and
unused books have been steadily
discarded.
The restructuring will also

expand the media center and lan
guage lab, which are not duplicat
ed at other branch libraries.
"It will be the first time the
library will be able to give [the
media services] the space they'll
need to grow for the future,"
Miller said.
The media center's video collec
tion has grown "800 percent in the
last five years," with no space to
accommodate it, said Michael Gray,
Meyer's media services director.
"We're at our limits here," he
said, adding that the center could
use "twice as much space."
Language Lab Coordinator
Renata Albrecht said the main
reason for moving the language
lab to the second floor was to keep

all the media services, including
the computer clusters, together
on one floor.
The second floor reference desk
will be eliminated due to budget
cuts, and students will be directed
other libraries for this service.
Leggette said books currently
on the second floor will be trans
ferred to Green and other
libraries. "Most of the students
who have used this library in the
past [for books] will have to get
used to .. . Green."
"I think it will be interesting to
see how [the restructuring] is all
going to work out," Leggette said
He said he hopes the changes will
not "cut back our ability to serve
students."
