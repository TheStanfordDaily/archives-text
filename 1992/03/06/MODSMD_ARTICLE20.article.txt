## Cheo H. Coker Switching messengers does not change anything at all 
### 
WHEN I FIRST SAW the caption,
I thought I read it wrong. David
Duke? Students For Equal
Rights? The Daily's ad section? Yeah.
Welcome To The Terrordome.
With coded, politically correct word
ing, the conservative student organiza
tion implies with their advertisement —
which ran in The Daily Feb. 21 — that
David Duke's overall message can be
separated from his racist, cross-burning
past.
"Do you love the message, but not nec
essarily the messenger?" The rest of the
ad uses images that invoke the same
kind of paranoia that has brought Duke
to political prominence, that put George
Bush in office with the success of his
"Willie Horton" campaign and is now
being used by Pat Buchanan to win over
more disenfranchised whites.
By invoking images of American val
ues and Western Culture under attack
by "illegal, Third World aliens," these
conservatives are able to attract those
whites who are frightened by the notion
of a truly multiracial, multi-ethnic
America.
Even Stanford is caught up in the
same debate. Many critics decry the
alteration of the "Western Culture" his
tory track, saying that recognizing the
contributions of non-Europeans to West
ern heritage "undermines" the structure
as a whole.
What many fail to realize is that this
new focus doesn't distort this historical
vision, but instead sharpens it; people
whose stories and accomplishments have
long been ignored now have the opportu
nity to add their narratives to the Canon
long dominated by works of privileged
white males.
One of the many disturbing elements

of the ad, however, is that conservatives
are now using the arguments of the
oppressed and neglected to perpetuate
their holdings on power and their self
implied notions of superiority.
Like Political Science Prof. Lucius
Barker said at a recent cultural event:
"We are witnessing the triumphs of
symbols and rhetoric over substance and
reality."

'One would condone the
systematic slaughter of
Jews and all other
undesirables, but not
Hitler himself.'

The notion of separating David Duke
from his message is ludicrous. Whether
one condones Duke's neo-Nazi past is
irrelevant; if one loves the message, one
ultimately loves the man.
Replace David Duke in this ad with
Adolf Hitler and the notion is even less
ambiguous. One would condone the sys
tematic slaughter of Jews and all other
undesirables (i.e. people of color and
homosexuals), but not Hitler himself.
After a point, the messages and policies
far outweigh the horror of the particular
individual who puts them in action.
Other messages inclosed in the ad are
also misleading. The very notion of
"anti-white racism in the forms of quo
tas and reverse discrimination" goes
against the very spirit of these policies.

Affirmative action is one of the means
being used to compensate for centuries
of discrimination. People of color,
regardless of ability, couldn't hold posi
tions of power or even attend high-pow
ered institutions like Stanford for the
simple fact that they were born with the
wrong skin color.
Affirmative action policies attempt to
even things up, to chip away at the "old
boy" network that has been running
things since this country's inception.
Most troubling is the ad's notion of
"the massive, ongoing invasion and colo
nization of America by illegal Third
World aliens."
America itself was invaded and colo
nized by white European aliens.
The merits and cultural history of the
Native Americans who preceded the
Europeans have been long neglected and
distorted.
The message of Emma Lazarus' son
net on the base of the Statue Of Liberty
has been altered. "Give me your tired,
your poor, your huddled masses yearn
ing to breathe free," it reads. This open
door policy, however, has applied only to
immigrants from "white" countries.
The Mexican, Cuban and Haitian
immigrants of the world have received
fifth-class treatment and their numbers
are being limited.
They come seeking a better life, not
unlike the Polish, Russian, Italian, Ger
man and Irish immigrants who arrived
at Ellis Island at the beginning of the
twentieth century or the Pilgrims who
landed in Massachusetts. An equal
chance, not world domination, is what
these "aliens" invariably seek.
Students For Equal Rights is an orga
nization which obviously doesn't believe
in equality. Their call to "rethink the

direction of America" obviously calls for
reinforcing domination by a white power
structure that keeps "the mud people"
in their place.
To neglect the contributions of people
of color, to perpetuate their positions of
subservience and to limit their share of

the wealth does nothing to move this
country forward.
Cosmetic surgery and a three-piece
suit are not enough to hide that white
hooded robe hanging in the closet. Sym
bols and rhetoric must never distort sub
stance and reality.

Most troubling is the ad's notion of
"the massive, ongoing invasion and colo
nization of America by illegal Third
World aliens."
America itself was invaded and colo
nized by white European aliens.
The merits and cultural history of the
Native Americans who preceded the
Europeans have been long neglected and
distorted.
The message of Emma Lazarus' son
net on the base of the Statue Of Liberty
has been altered. "Give me your tired,
your poor, your huddled masses yearn
ing to breathe free," it reads. This open
door policy, however, has applied only to
immigrants from "white" countries.
The Mexican, Cuban and Haitian
immigrants of the world have received
fifth-class treatment and their numbers
are being limited.
They come seeking a better life, not
unlike the Polish, Russian, Italian, Ger
man and Irish immigrants who arrived
at Ellis Island at the beginning of the
twentieth century or the Pilgrims who
landed in Massachusetts. An equal
chance, not world domination, is what
these "aliens" invariably seek.
Students For Equal Rights is an orga
nization which obviously doesn't believe
in equality. Their call to "rethink the

direction of America" obviously calls for
reinforcing domination by a white power
structure that keeps "the mud people"
in their place.
To neglect the contributions of people
of color, to perpetuate their positions of
subservience and to limit their share of

the wealth does nothing to move this
country forward.
Cosmetic surgery and a three-piece
suit are not enough to hide that white
hooded robe hanging in the closet. Sym
bols and rhetoric must never distort sub
stance and reality.

WHEN I FIRST SAW the caption,
I thought I read it wrong. David
Duke? Students For Equal
Rights? The Daily's ad section? Yeah.
Welcome To The Terrordome.
With coded, politically correct word
ing, the conservative student organiza
tion implies with their advertisement —
which ran in The Daily Feb. 21 — that
David Duke's overall message can be
separated from his racist, cross-burning
past.
"Do you love the message, but not nec
essarily the messenger?" The rest of the
ad uses images that invoke the same
kind of paranoia that has brought Duke
to political prominence, that put George
Bush in office with the success of his
"Willie Horton" campaign and is now
being used by Pat Buchanan to win over
more disenfranchised whites.
By invoking images of American val
ues and Western Culture under attack
by "illegal, Third World aliens," these
conservatives are able to attract those
whites who are frightened by the notion
of a truly multiracial, multi-ethnic
America.
Even Stanford is caught up in the
same debate. Many critics decry the
alteration of the "Western Culture" his
tory track, saying that recognizing the
contributions of non-Europeans to West
ern heritage "undermines" the structure
as a whole.
What many fail to realize is that this
new focus doesn't distort this historical
vision, but instead sharpens it; people
whose stories and accomplishments have
long been ignored now have the opportu
nity to add their narratives to the Canon
long dominated by works of privileged
white males.
One of the many disturbing elements

of the ad, however, is that conservatives
are now using the arguments of the
oppressed and neglected to perpetuate
their holdings on power and their self
implied notions of superiority.
Like Political Science Prof. Lucius
Barker said at a recent cultural event:
"We are witnessing the triumphs of
symbols and rhetoric over substance and
reality."

'One would condone the
systematic slaughter of
Jews and all other
undesirables, but not
Hitler himself.'

The notion of separating David Duke
from his message is ludicrous. Whether
one condones Duke's neo-Nazi past is
irrelevant; if one loves the message, one
ultimately loves the man.
Replace David Duke in this ad with
Adolf Hitler and the notion is even less
ambiguous. One would condone the sys
tematic slaughter of Jews and all other
undesirables (i.e. people of color and
homosexuals), but not Hitler himself.
After a point, the messages and policies
far outweigh the horror of the particular
individual who puts them in action.
Other messages inclosed in the ad are
also misleading. The very notion of
"anti-white racism in the forms of quo
tas and reverse discrimination" goes
against the very spirit of these policies.

Affirmative action is one of the means
being used to compensate for centuries
of discrimination. People of color,
regardless of ability, couldn't hold posi
tions of power or even attend high-pow
ered institutions like Stanford for the
simple fact that they were born with the
wrong skin color.
Affirmative action policies attempt to
even things up, to chip away at the "old
boy" network that has been running
things since this country's inception.
