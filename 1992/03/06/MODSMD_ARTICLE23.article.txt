## Rouse stuns 'em in Indy with two record swims 
### Brian Egan Editorial staff 
JefT Rouse swam the second and third
fastest 100-meter backstrokes ever at the
U.S. Olympic Trials yesterday, and
became the first Stanford men's swimmer
to qualify for the U.S. Olympic team.
Rouse won the morning's preliminaries
in 54.13 seconds, just two-tenths of a sec
ond shy of the world record of 53.93 he set
last summer in the Pan Pacific Games. In
last night's finals, Rouse bettered his
morning's time by .06 seconds, finishing
first with a time of 54.07 seconds.
Both of Rouse's times broke the U.S.
Open record of 54.67 set by Martin Zubero
last year. The senior owns the two fastest
100-back times ever swum in the United
States, along with six of the nine fastest
times overall.
Two other Cardinal swimmers compet
ed in the 100-back finals as well. Derek
Weatherford and Brian Retterer finished
fifth and sixth, respectively. Neither qual
ified for the Olympic team in that event
(the top two swimmers in each category
make the Olympic squad).

Summer Sanders qualified for her third
Olympic event, winning the 200-meter IM
with a time of 2:13:10. The sophomore
had previously qualified for the 400-meter
IM along with the 100-meter butterfly.
Janel Jorgensen narrowly missed qualify
ing in the 200 IM, finishing third at
2:16:85.
In the men's 200 IM, Ray Carey narrow
ly missed the cut, finishing fourth in the
finals with an impressive time of 1:59:83.
Qualifying time in the event was 1:59:66.
Ex-Stanford swimmer Janet Evans, a
three-time gold medalist in the 1988 Seoul
Olympics, qualified for her second event
by winning the 800-meter freestyle in
8:27.24. Evans kept intact her 800
freestyle unbeaten streak that began in
August 1987.
"I could have gone faster but I'm satis
fled," she said. "I never go into a race
expecting to set a record. Athletes should go
into a race focusing on the race and win
ning."
The Indianapolis trials end today.
