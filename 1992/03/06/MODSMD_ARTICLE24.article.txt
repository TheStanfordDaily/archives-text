# Hoops lose big one

### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
TEMPE(Ariz.) — Procrasti
nating college students at the
core, the men's basketball team
requested an extension last
night on the NCAA Tourna
ment entrance exam.
Arizona State was happy to
comply, beating the Cardinal
76-71 before 6,907 fans at the
University Activity Center.
• Faced with the opportunity
to secure a tournament bid, the
Cardinal postponed any deci
sion at least 10 days. With
games tomorrow at No. 4 Ari
zona and next week at home
against Oregon and Oregon
State, Stanford will rest on the
jjl tournament bubble until bids
are announced a week from
Sunday.
Stanford (16-9, 8-7) is now
tied with Arizona State (17-11,
8-7) for the coveted fourth spot
in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Squarely back in the tourna
ment hunt, the Sun Devils play
California and at USC and
UCLA to finish their schedule.
"This helps Arizona State. It
keeps them alive," said Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery.
"Our job is still to come in
fourth. What happens if there
is a tie for fourth? I don't know.
A lot of people think the Pac-10
should get five teams, but other
conferences think they deserve
eight."
Stanford plays at the
McKale Center tomorrow at 3
p.m. PST with no expectations
of an upset. Stanford is 1-15 at
McKale, and the Wildcats have
won their last seven home
games by an average of 31
points. But if the Cardinal can
sweep Oregon (0-12 on the
road) and Oregon State, it will
force ASU to beat either USC
or UCLA to tie for fourth.
After trailing by 14 to start
the second half, Stanford got as
close as 71-68 on a 12-foot
baseline jumper by Brent

Williams with 55 seconds left.
Williams hit all eight shots he
took from the field for 20
points.
Two fatal mental mistakes
in the final minute thwarted a
Cardinal comeback. First,
Stanford failed to foul on the
inbound until center Paul Gar
rett hacked Dwayne Fontana
on a dunk. Instead of a shaky
free throw shooter on the line,
the Sun Devils got a 3-point
play to go ahead 74-68.
Williams nailed a trey with
10 seconds left to cut the lead
back to 74-71, but then made
mental mistake No. 2. With
two men covering him, ASU
guard Stevin Smith — a 90 per
cent free throw shooter — got
the ball on the inbound pass.
Immediately fouled, he made
both free throws to ice the
game.
"The statistics look good
compared to the way we
played," said Montgomery,
whose club shot 54 percent
from the field and 81 percent
from the line. "Most of our mis
takes were mental mistakes.
We didn't play as intelligently
as we can, as we have to. We
wanted to foul, but we didn't
want to foul Smith. Those
plays were indicative of the
whole game."
Adam Keefe scored a team
high 23 points on 8-of-14
shooting, but was held to four
shots in the first half by aggres
sive ASU freshmen Mario Ben
nett and Tony Ronaldson.
"When I get 13 shots and
nobody else is stepping up,
we're going to lose," said Keefe,
who took two desperation treys
at the end.
With Williams and Peter
Dukes on the bench with two
fouls, ASU took off on an 18-6
run through halftime. After
Keefe scored the first bucket of
the second half to pull Stanford
within 44-37, the Cardinal
turned it over three straight
times and ASU scored on the other
end. Montgomery called a timeout
with the Cardinal trailing 51-37.
"Those were all unforced
turnovers," said Montgomery,
whose team coughed it up 17
times.
Montgomery turned to some
new faces to spark the comeback.
Freshman David Harbour played
a season-high 15 minutes, all at
fast-forward speed. He tallied six
points and four fouls, but gave
the Cardinal a much-needed
intensity boost. Harbour caught
the full attention of ASU senior
guard Lynn Collins with a diving
effort at a loose ball between
Collins' feet.
"That's the type of player I am
— just trying to get the job done,"
said Harbour. "The ball was on
the floor and I thought I had a
chance at it. Collins was a little
upset, but he understood I was
going after the ball."
Harbour substituted for Dukes,
who was limited to three points by
ASU's Smith. Smith hit five treys

for a team-high 20 points.
"I've been pleased with Har
bour's play and we gave him a
good look," said Montgomery.
The Sun Devils had four play
ers in double figures, and neither
were their top guns, Faulkner
and Neal.

run through halftime. After
Keefe scored the first bucket of
the second half to pull Stanford
within 44-37, the Cardinal
turned it over three straight
times and ASU scored on the other
end. Montgomery called a timeout
with the Cardinal trailing 51-37.
"Those were all unforced
turnovers," said Montgomery,
whose team coughed it up 17
times.
Montgomery turned to some
new faces to spark the comeback.
Freshman David Harbour played
a season-high 15 minutes, all at
fast-forward speed. He tallied six
points and four fouls, but gave
the Cardinal a much-needed
intensity boost. Harbour caught
the full attention of ASU senior
guard Lynn Collins with a diving
effort at a loose ball between
Collins' feet.
"That's the type of player I am
— just trying to get the job done,"
said Harbour. "The ball was on
the floor and I thought I had a
chance at it. Collins was a little
upset, but he understood I was
going after the ball."
Harbour substituted for Dukes,
who was limited to three points by
ASU's Smith. Smith hit five treys

for a team-high 20 points.
"I've been pleased with Har
bour's play and we gave him a
good look," said Montgomery.
The Sun Devils had four play
ers in double figures, and neither
were their top guns, Faulkner
and Neal.

TEMPE(Ariz.) — Procrasti
nating college students at the
core, the men's basketball team
requested an extension last
night on the NCAA Tourna
ment entrance exam.
Arizona State was happy to
comply, beating the Cardinal
76-71 before 6,907 fans at the
University Activity Center.
• Faced with the opportunity
to secure a tournament bid, the
Cardinal postponed any deci
sion at least 10 days. With
games tomorrow at No. 4 Ari
zona and next week at home
against Oregon and Oregon
State, Stanford will rest on the
jjl tournament bubble until bids
are announced a week from
Sunday.
Stanford (16-9, 8-7) is now
tied with Arizona State (17-11,
8-7) for the coveted fourth spot
in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Squarely back in the tourna
ment hunt, the Sun Devils play
California and at USC and
UCLA to finish their schedule.
"This helps Arizona State. It
keeps them alive," said Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery.
"Our job is still to come in
fourth. What happens if there
is a tie for fourth? I don't know.
A lot of people think the Pac-10
should get five teams, but other
conferences think they deserve
eight."
Stanford plays at the
McKale Center tomorrow at 3
p.m. PST with no expectations
of an upset. Stanford is 1-15 at
McKale, and the Wildcats have
won their last seven home
games by an average of 31
points. But if the Cardinal can
sweep Oregon (0-12 on the
road) and Oregon State, it will
force ASU to beat either USC
or UCLA to tie for fourth.
After trailing by 14 to start
the second half, Stanford got as
close as 71-68 on a 12-foot
baseline jumper by Brent

Williams with 55 seconds left.
Williams hit all eight shots he
took from the field for 20
points.
Two fatal mental mistakes
in the final minute thwarted a
Cardinal comeback. First,
Stanford failed to foul on the
inbound until center Paul Gar
rett hacked Dwayne Fontana
on a dunk. Instead of a shaky
free throw shooter on the line,
the Sun Devils got a 3-point
play to go ahead 74-68.
Williams nailed a trey with
10 seconds left to cut the lead
back to 74-71, but then made
mental mistake No. 2. With
two men covering him, ASU
guard Stevin Smith — a 90 per
cent free throw shooter — got
the ball on the inbound pass.
Immediately fouled, he made
both free throws to ice the
game.
"The statistics look good
compared to the way we
played," said Montgomery,
whose club shot 54 percent
from the field and 81 percent
from the line. "Most of our mis
takes were mental mistakes.
We didn't play as intelligently
as we can, as we have to. We
wanted to foul, but we didn't
want to foul Smith. Those
plays were indicative of the
whole game."
Adam Keefe scored a team
high 23 points on 8-of-14
shooting, but was held to four
shots in the first half by aggres
sive ASU freshmen Mario Ben
nett and Tony Ronaldson.
"When I get 13 shots and
nobody else is stepping up,
we're going to lose," said Keefe,
who took two desperation treys
at the end.
With Williams and Peter
Dukes on the bench with two
fouls, ASU took off on an 18-6
run through halftime. After
Keefe scored the first bucket of
the second half to pull Stanford
within 44-37, the Cardinal
turned it over three straight
times and ASU scored on the other
end. Montgomery called a timeout
with the Cardinal trailing 51-37.
