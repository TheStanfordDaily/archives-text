# Cagers prevail 92-70 in emotional game
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
In a highly emotional contest
last night, the Stanford women's
basketball team outhustled Ore
gon, 92-70, and in the process
showed that it is on the track to
elevate its play for NCAA's, even
if it hasn't quite gotten there yet.
Three of the Ducks' major
players were not able to play in
the game. Scoring leader Staci
Wallenborn was among them.
Her brother's recent death gave
the Ducks extra incentive to
upend the Cardinal.
But Stanford was on a mission
to show that it has elevated its
play in preparation for the NCAA
tournament. In addition, unusu
ally creative officiating fired up
the Cardinal and the Maples
PaViUoh fans.
With both teams playing on
emotion, the less athletically tal
ented Ducks simply ran out of gas
and were overpowered by Stanford.
The Cardinal displayed some of
the intangible fire that coach
Tar a VanDerveer has lately been
insisting upon from her team.
"I didn't see it at the begin
ning," VanDerveer said, "but I
saw it in spurts.... It has to be a
given."
Indeed, Stanford found itself
behind 9-4 after two and a half
minutes of play. Reserve fresh
man guard Jessica Schutt scored
the Ducks' first six points and tal
lied all of her 11 points in the first
seven minutes of the game.
Schutt had replaced starter
Vanessa Selden, who was unable
to make the trip from Oregon.
Stanford's perimeter defense
arrived at the game somewhat
later than the rest of the team, as
the Ducks rained treys in the first
five minutes. After the squads
traded 10-0 runs, the emotional
tone of the game was set.
With 6:51 on the clock, official
Dom Bosque called an offensive
foul on Kelly Dougherty for being
poked by her defender. The call fol
lowed several other questionable
ones, and VanDerveer didn't like it.
"I thought the call was ridicu
lous," she said. "I just told him

that I thought it was ridiculous."
Official Larry Shepard called
her for only her second technical
foul since picking up one six years
ago in her first year on the Farm.
"I was out of the coach's box,"
VanDerveer explained. But as far
as her comments were concerned,
she said, "I don't think I got my
money's worth for that technical."
Regardless, the successive calls
by the officials pitted all 2,323
fans decidedly against the refer
ees. Although the crowd was
about 1,000 below average, it was
the loudest one since the UCLA
game on Jan. 18.
Stanford went on a 14-6 run
before the Ducks could handle the
crowd-buoyed Cardinal attack.
Stanford finished the half up 43-40.
In the second half the Cardinal
stifled the Oregon perimeter,
while doing its own three-point
damage. Led by Christy Hedg
peth's 3-for-4 three-point shoot
ing and 18 second-half points,
Stanford ran away from the
Ducks.
Within a four-minute period in
the middle of the second half,
Hedgpeth drained two threes and
a 19-footer, while Molly Gooden
bour nailed a three and a 17-foot
er. Three of those shots were off
of Val Whiting passes.
Whiting again found herself
faced with multiple defenders,
but showed why calling her a
mere candidate for All-America
status is like damning with faint
praise.
Worried Ducks doubled down
on the star center, leaving Hedg
peth and Goodenbour open and
allowing Whiting to dish it out to
the guards for the big baskets.
"No one can stop fWhiting] one
on one," VanDerveer said, "so
they're double and tripling her,
and then she picks up the fouls
and she scores on foul shots."
After tallying 21 points, seven
offensive boards, four assists,
three blocks and a steal, Whiting
looked forward to playing Oregon
State and Judy Shannon tomor
row. The Beavers upset the Cardi
nal earlier this season.
"We're gonna come back and
get 'em," Whiting said.

freshman center scored five points and grabbed five rebounds in
Stanford's emotionall charged 92-70 win over the Ducks.
In a highly emotional contest
last night, the Stanford women's
basketball team outhustled Ore
gon, 92-70, and in the process
showed that it is on the track to
elevate its play for NCAA's, even
if it hasn't quite gotten there yet.
Three of the Ducks' major
players were not able to play in
the game. Scoring leader Staci
Wallenborn was among them.
Her brother's recent death gave
the Ducks extra incentive to
upend the Cardinal.
But Stanford was on a mission
to show that it has elevated its
play in preparation for the NCAA
tournament. In addition, unusu
ally creative officiating fired up
the Cardinal and the Maples
PaViUoh fans.
With both teams playing on
emotion, the less athletically tal
ented Ducks simply ran out of gas
and were overpowered by Stanford.
The Cardinal displayed some of
the intangible fire that coach
Tar a VanDerveer has lately been
insisting upon from her team.
"I didn't see it at the begin
ning," VanDerveer said, "but I
saw it in spurts.... It has to be a
given."
Indeed, Stanford found itself
behind 9-4 after two and a half
minutes of play. Reserve fresh
man guard Jessica Schutt scored
the Ducks' first six points and tal
lied all of her 11 points in the first
seven minutes of the game.
Schutt had replaced starter
Vanessa Selden, who was unable
to make the trip from Oregon.
Stanford's perimeter defense
arrived at the game somewhat
later than the rest of the team, as
the Ducks rained treys in the first
five minutes. After the squads
traded 10-0 runs, the emotional
tone of the game was set.
With 6:51 on the clock, official
Dom Bosque called an offensive
foul on Kelly Dougherty for being
poked by her defender. The call fol
lowed several other questionable
ones, and VanDerveer didn't like it.
"I thought the call was ridicu
lous," she said. "I just told him

that I thought it was ridiculous."
Official Larry Shepard called
her for only her second technical
foul since picking up one six years
ago in her first year on the Farm.
"I was out of the coach's box,"
VanDerveer explained. But as far
as her comments were concerned,
she said, "I don't think I got my
money's worth for that technical."
Regardless, the successive calls
by the officials pitted all 2,323
fans decidedly against the refer
ees. Although the crowd was
about 1,000 below average, it was
the loudest one since the UCLA
game on Jan. 18.
Stanford went on a 14-6 run
before the Ducks could handle the
crowd-buoyed Cardinal attack.
Stanford finished the half up 43-40.
In the second half the Cardinal
stifled the Oregon perimeter,
while doing its own three-point
damage. Led by Christy Hedg
peth's 3-for-4 three-point shoot
ing and 18 second-half points,
Stanford ran away from the
Ducks.
Within a four-minute period in
the middle of the second half,
Hedgpeth drained two threes and
a 19-footer, while Molly Gooden
bour nailed a three and a 17-foot
er. Three of those shots were off
of Val Whiting passes.
Whiting again found herself
faced with multiple defenders,
but showed why calling her a
mere candidate for All-America
status is like damning with faint
praise.
Worried Ducks doubled down
on the star center, leaving Hedg
peth and Goodenbour open and
allowing Whiting to dish it out to
the guards for the big baskets.
"No one can stop fWhiting] one
on one," VanDerveer said, "so
they're double and tripling her,
and then she picks up the fouls
and she scores on foul shots."
After tallying 21 points, seven
offensive boards, four assists,
three blocks and a steal, Whiting
looked forward to playing Oregon
State and Judy Shannon tomor
row. The Beavers upset the Cardi
nal earlier this season.
"We're gonna come back and
get 'em," Whiting said.
