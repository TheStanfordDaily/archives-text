# Gymnasts host two meets at Burnham
## Women face Nittany Lions 
### Brandi Shipp Staff writer 
Never let it be said that the Stanford
women's gymnastics team doesn't like a
challenge. And a challenge it will have
tonight at Burnham Pavilion, as the
Cardinal host the gymnasts of Penn
State for the last home meet of the sea
son.
Despite coming off of a mixed triple
meet last week, where the Cardinal lost
in a close battle against the Golden
Bears of California, the No. 18 Stanford
women hardly flinch at the thought of
facing the Nittany Lions of Penn State, a
perennial powerhouse in women's gym
nastics, now ranked No. 5 in the coun
try. .
And how does a small, young team
plan to hold their ground against Penn
State? Surprisingly, the Cardinal have
made few out of the ordinary adjust
ments in preparation for tonight's
match-up. "We are on a cycle where we
add difficulty once a week, and just see
how it works," head coach Breck Green
wood said. He notes, however, that in
this meet with such tough competition,
the key is strong, solid performances.
"We just can't take too many chances,"
Greenwood said.

This meet closes an up and down
home season for the Stanford gymnasts.
Despite having only three wins at home,
the Stanford gymnasts have made great
strides since their first outing at the
onset of the season. The young team,
with four freshmen and four sopho
mores, has been slashing individual and
team records since day one.
The competition against Penn State
will also help gear the Cardinal up for
their next big challenge, the Pacific 10
Championships, which will be held
three weeks from now at the Universi
ty of Arizona in Tucson. The Pac-10 is
an impressive conference in women's
gymnastics â€” seven of the teams are in
the top 20 in the country. "To be hon
est, there is no weak link," Greenwood
said.
Men take on Golden Bears

After acing its midterms, the men's
gymnastics team will take its final exam
ination of the regular season this week
end. The Cardinal will compete in the
UC-Santa Barbara Invitational tonight
and battle California Saturday night.
At Santa Barbara, Stanford faces its
toughest competition of the season

against Brigham Young University, a
top-five ranked squad.
Though Stanford defeated Cal earlier
in the season, the next evening's match
up will be no time for rest. According to
Stanford coach Sadao Hamada, the
Golden Bears are an up-and-coming
gymnastics squad.
"They're a young team but with a
new coaching staff," Hamada said.
"They're doing so much better than
before."
At its next two meets, Stanford will
begin to field its strongest team of the
season in preparation for the Pacific 10
Championships at the end of March. The
Cardinal spent much of the regular sea
son finding out which athlete to use in
each gymnastic discipline.
"Each guy knows his responsibilities
now, what they are going to compete in,
and what they need to work on," Hama
da said. "We're going to get the top six at
each position."
The Cardinal hopes to improve on the
No. 3 ranking it received one week ago.
By doing so, Stanford can gain national
recognition among the judges in the east
and mid-west, most of whom have not
yet seen the Cardinal in action.
"We want them to know we're good,"
Hamada said. "There's no doubt that
judges can be biased (against teams they
do not recognize.)
