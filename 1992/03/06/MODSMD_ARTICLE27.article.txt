## Netmen catch rays at doubles tourney 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Once again, as the rain starts falling
on the Farm, the men's tennis team
hops on a plane and escapes to a sunnier
climate. Today's destination is the La
Jolla Beach and Tennis Club, host of the
103 rd Pacific Coast Doubles Champi
onships.
The tournament is unlike most
because it is open to non-collegiate play
ers. Active low-level players and high
school and junior college athletes will
also compete.
In past years, the Cardinal has done
very well at this event. Alums Jonathan
Stark and Jared Palmer won the tour
nament in both 1990 and 1991. This
year, three Stanford pairs will vie to
carry on the tradition.
Top-ranked singles player Alex
O'Brien and sophomore Chris Cocotos
will team up, followed by sophomores
Michael Flanagan and Robert Devens,
who are currently ranked ninth nation
ally. Their classmate Vimal Patel will
pair up with veteran Jason Yee to round
out the lineup.
Flanagan sees this tournament as a

stepping stone to achieving the team's
long-term goal for the end of the season.
"I'm excited to have the opportunity to
focus solely on doubles because that's
what it all comes down to at NCAAs," he
said.

Head coach Dick Gould is also look
ing forward to concentrating on dou
bles, a nagging weak spot in the Cardi
nal armour this season. "Some team
matches, like (National Intercollegiate)
Indoors, don't have doubles. It's not
always easy to practice doubles."
With the dual meet schedule com
plete until after Spring Break, the tim
ing of this event is perfect for the team.
"There's no big singles hanging on the
horizon this weekend, we're just going
to sit back and work on doubles," Gould
said. "This is a great time for us."
