# When second is top priority: Card, UCLA battle for No. 2 ranking
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's tennis team
faces its biggest home dual-match chal
lenge of the season today as the squad
hosts UCLA.
"This is really an epic battle, espe
cially here. They play better here than
they play at home," Cardinal coach
Frank Brennan said.
Both clubs are 11-1 coming off close
losses to Florida in the National Indoor
Championships. Stanford fell to the
Gators 5-3 while UCLA was edged 5-4.
Besides Florida, all other top-ranked
teams have lost to either the Bruins or
the Cardinal.
"Everyone else is behind us and
we're going at it for No. 2," Brennan
said.
While the squads have not met head
to-head, several of their top players
have. Heather Willens beat UCLA's No.
1, Iwalani McCalla, in the first round of
the National College Classic in January.
The two wouldn't have met in the
initial round except that McCalla played
pro events (as an amateur) in the fall
and thus doesn't have a collegiate rank
ing.
At the end of the tourney, the clubs'
No. 2 players collided. Laxmi Poruri
took the title by beating Mamie Ceniza.
Brennan thinks both Bruins have
improved but McCalla may be especially
difficult to overcome. "She's playing the

best tennis of her life," he said. "She
plays a lot like Heather. She's bigger,
but not quite as quick and Heather's a
little more focused."
The match between Kylie Johnson
and Cammie Foley evokes memories of
the 1991 NCAA Championships. Last
year Johnson clinched the Cardinal's
sixth-straight national title when she
triumphed over Foley in front of thou
sands of people wrapped around court
six. Now they battle at No. 3.
At slots 4-6 the UCLA lineup is hazy.
"They've been the team over the years
that has switched the lineup the most,"
Brennan said. "We're an open book. ...
I think its counterproductive for the
team to be jerked around so much."
The Bruins went with Paige
Yaroshuck, Lee Ann Rostovsky and
Jenny Hilt at National Indoors but have
also played Jenny Baker at various posi
tions. Brennan doesn't expect UCLA's
juggling act to distract the Cardinal.
"I think there's a mentality where we
have to feel we're good and just go out
and play our game," he said. "If a Stan
ford player plays well then she's going
to win. [The opponent] can play any way
they want and its not going to make a
difference."
What may make the difference is
doubles. McCalla and Ceniza create a
formidable team while Baker and Hilt
recently upset Florida's Lisa Raymond
and Erika Kuttler.
However, the Cardinal has been hon

ing doubles skills in practice and Bren
nan believes they're ready for the Bru
ins.
Fan support may also be a critical
factor. "When we go to Wisconsin (for
National Indoors) and we play Holly
Lloyd, who is from the Chicago area,
there are people at her matches scream
ing all over the place," Brennan said.
"So the girls appreciate it when we
come back here.
They can feel the difference when
someone's cheering in the stands."
Today is Fan Appreciation Day at Stan
ford Tennis Stadium. Students get in
