# Three more dorms will be focus houses
## All of Sterling Quad to be theme-oriented; new residences could also get designation 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
Potter, Schiff and Murray Houses will
become focus houses next year, making all
four Sterling Quad residences theme-ori
ented and increasing the total number of
focus houses to five.
"American Society: the Sixties Through
the Nineties," will be Potter's focus, and
"Arts and Performing Arts" will be examined
in Schiff. Murray, in Governor's Corner, will
explore "Modern Culture and Thought."
The programs were developed by the
current resident fellows in the houses and
the Office of Residential Education as a
way to "increase student involvement" in
the residences and "better utilize RFs,"
said Alice Supton, director of Res Ed.

the upperclass houses in Manzanita II —
Manzanita North and South — could
become focus houses in 1993-94.
The two existing focus houses are

Adams House, which examines human
biology, and Robinson House, which deals
with gender issues.

into Res Ed by providing a focus," said Law
Prof. Robert Weisberg, resident fellow in
Murray.
Students will be awarded special assign
ment priorities if they commit to planning
and participating in focus activities. For
the "Modern Culture and Thought" house,
students majoring in the humanities and
social sciences or students who plan to take
advanced courses in these areas will be
given priorities, Weisberg said.
Twenty percent of the spaces in Potter
and Schiff and 25 percent of Murray's
spaces will be reserved for students with
priorities, according to Supton.
"I think it's important to have at least a
critical mass of students who come into Pot
ter with an interest in the kind of program
ming we're best at doing," Carson said.
The new programs will be instituted on
a trial basis, said Supton. If next year's
