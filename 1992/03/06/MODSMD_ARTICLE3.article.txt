# Three more dorms will be focus houses
## All of Sterling Quad to be theme-oriented; new residences could also get designation 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
Potter, Schiff and Murray Houses will
become focus houses next year, making all
four Sterling Quad residences theme-ori
ented and increasing the total number of
focus houses to five.
"American Society: the Sixties Through
the Nineties," will be Potter's focus, and
"Arts and Performing Arts" will be examined
in Schiff. Murray, in Governor's Corner, will
explore "Modern Culture and Thought."
The programs were developed by the
current resident fellows in the houses and
the Office of Residential Education as a
way to "increase student involvement" in
the residences and "better utilize RFs,"
said Alice Supton, director of Res Ed.
Supton also said the office "may think
about having all upperclass houses have
some kind of focus or theme designation."
She said there is a "strong possibility"
the upperclass houses in Manzanita II —
Manzanita North and South — could
become focus houses in 1993-94.
The two existing focus houses are

Adams House, which examines human
biology, and Robinson House, which deals
with gender issues.
"We're trying to put a little more 'ed'
into Res Ed by providing a focus," said Law
Prof. Robert Weisberg, resident fellow in
Murray.
Students will be awarded special assign
ment priorities if they commit to planning
and participating in focus activities. For
the "Modern Culture and Thought" house,
students majoring in the humanities and
social sciences or students who plan to take
advanced courses in these areas will be
given priorities, Weisberg said.
Twenty percent of the spaces in Potter
and Schiff and 25 percent of Murray's
spaces will be reserved for students with
priorities, according to Supton.
"I think it's important to have at least a
critical mass of students who come into Pot
ter with an interest in the kind of program
ming we're best at doing," Carson said.
The new programs will be instituted on
a trial basis, said Supton. If next year's


Marcos Najera — Daily
programs are deemed successful,
new focus houses may be pro
posed as RFs change.
Focus houses are different
from theme houses such as the
Italian House or Haus Mitteleu
ropa in that theme house resi
dents "commit to an in-house
seminar or other course work
together so that there is some
shared intellectual orientation,"
while there is no such require
ment in focus houses, Supton said.
But Weisberg indicated that
there may be an optional interdis
ciplinary four-unit evening course
in Murray next year dealing with
modern intellectual theory.
Next year, Schiff and Potter
will be each have two resident
assistants — a change from this

year, when each house had three.
Each house will also have one or
two focus assistants. Murray will
continue to have one RA and will
add one focus assistant.
"I wish we were not losing an
RA," Carson said. "But we'll try
to live with it by bringing in FAs.
I think that's a step in the wrong
direction."
Supton said the reduction in
RAs is a budget-cutting measure,
but that the addition of focus
assistants, who receive guaran
teed housing but no pay, will com
pensate for the loss.
"A great deal of the impetus is
from the resident fellows them
selves, unlike the Gender Issues
[house] and Human Biology
[house] which came primarily
from students organizing and
thinking through their desire for
a residential setting to explore
some topics," Supton said.
Field trips to art galleries, poet

ry readings, opera, dance and musi
cal and theatrical performances are
planned for the "Arts and Perform
ing Arts" house, according to the
description written for this year's
guide to the Draw.
Interdisciplinary programs on
such topics as the black freedom
struggle, the ecology movement,
the women's movement and the
gay and lesbian rights movement
are slated for the "American Soci
ety" house, said Carson.
The "Modern Thought and
Culture" house will focus on top
ics in culture, social theory and
the general intellectual history of
the 19th and 20th centuries,
Weisberg said. A major theme will
be the exploration of relationships
between disciplines.
"We'll focus on the modern,"
he said. "We could look at any
thing from Marxist theory to psy
choanalytic theory."
Supton emphasized that "the

Sterling Quad houses and Murray
will continue to have a wide array
of activities, events, programs and
outings."
"What it means to be a focus
house is that some subset of activ
ities will cluster on whatever the
focus topic is," she said. "It
should not be seen as limiting or
constricting."
"I think it's a great idea," said
Scott Hines, an RAin Schiff.
"Stanford lacks a dialogue on the
arts."
"I know that [RF Michael]
Ramsaur is going to try to create a
balance between traditional Res
Ed programs and the focus pro
gramming," said Hines.
Neither Supton nor Weisberg
would speculate on how the
change would affect this year's
Draw.
"I don't understand the stock
market or the housing draw," said
Weisberg. "It's too complex."
