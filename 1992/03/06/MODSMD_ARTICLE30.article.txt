# Hurlers expected to dominate weekend's Card-Trojan matchup

### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Pretty darned big. This weekend, the Southern
California Trojans visit Sunken Diamond for a three
game set with the Stanford baseball team in what
can be described as a pretty doggonned important
series. Stanford is currently tied with two other
teams for first in the Six-Pac at 2-1, while USC is
tied with the other two at one game back. However,
the team from Troy forms an imposing squad, who
despite their 8-9 record as of last weekend, are still
ranked 23rd by Baseball America.
The importance of the series for the Cardinal has
something to do with home field advantage. With
Six-Pac as tough as it is, teams never know how
they'll do against conference opponents; the "on any
given day" cliche definitely holds true among the six
teams. Therefore, as any coach will tell you, if a team
ever has any advantage, and is going to beat anyone,
it is playing at their home field. Home wins have to
be counted on in the Six-Pac. Just ask Arizona State
coach Jim Brock if he was happy about losing two of
three to the Cardinal in Tempe.
Nevertheless, beating the Trojans is a tall order.
Mike Gillespie's squad last year hosted the West
regional by virtue of a 44-15 regular season record,
and a Six-Pac title. However, Southern Cal lost six
position players and two top relievers from that
squad, and now rely on their pitching.
Southern Cal has the Six-Pac's Pitcher of the
Year for '91 in the person of senior Jackie Nickell,
who incidentally is from Palo Alto. Nickell is even
exceeding last year's performance thus far with a 3-
1 record, a 1.55 ERA and 39 K's in 40.7 innings.
Nickell is joined in the rotation by righthanders Dan

Hubbs (2-2, 1.85 ERA with 39 K's in 34 innings this
year) and Kent Donnelly (2-2, 2.39). Gillespie is con
fident that his starting three can match up with any
one in the Six-Pac, and he may be right.
"I really like our pitching and I like our defense,"
said Gillespie. "While we lost substantially from our
offense of last year, we'll be much more difficult to
score on than since I've been here."

'I really like our pitching and I like our
defense . . . we'll be much more difficult
to score on than since I've been here.'
— USC coach Mike Gillespie

The talent for the Trojans does not continue at
the plate to such an extent. Sophomore catcher
Bobby Hughes is leading the Trojans in hitting
where his .378 average, four homers, and 11 RBI are
very impressive. Super-hyped freshman Aaron
Boone, son of Bob, is currently hitting .370 at third
base, while over at second, Lionel Hastings is hitting
.391 and providing excellent defense.
But their opponent, the Cardinal, ranked fifth in
the nation by Baseball America, is looking as good as
they ever have this year from the plate. Dusty Allen,
David Cornell, Chris Kemper and Jeffrey Hammonds
are all hitting over .300. The Stanford outfield of
Cornell, Hammonds and Steve Solomon have a com
bined 32 stolen bases.
Game time at Sunken Diamond is at 2 p.m. Fri
day and 1 p.m. on both Saturday and Sunday. The
probable starters are Brian Saclunsky, Rick Helling
and Willie Adams, respectively.

Senior Tony Detter at the plate against Pepperdine University. The versatile Detter has seen time at 3B
and DH, and can play both 2B and SS as well. Although Detter and the rest of the Cardinal have been
hitting better in recent weeks, the squad Is still batting a paltry .265 on the year.
