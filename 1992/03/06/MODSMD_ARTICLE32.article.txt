# Track holds dual meet
## 
### Nick Clements 
Stanford Track will officially
kick off its home opener on Satur
day by holding Fan Appreciation
day. All students and faculty will
be admitted free to the double
dual meet against San Francisco
State and Sonoma State.
"We just want the students to
be able to see their friends com
pete if they're only in one event"
said Assistant Coach Scott
Chisam. "The baseball team will
be playing USC across the parking
lot, so it should be a great day for
the fans."
The women's team will be
without Jackie Edwards, who will
be attempting to qualify for the
NCAA Championships in the long
and triple jumps this weekend at
the University of Wyoming at
Laramie.
"We're going to miss her this
Saturday, but we'll still have
Chryste (Gaines) and Rhonda
(Oliver) in the sprints, and they'll
do a great job," said Chisam.
Gaines will be using this week
end as tune-up for the NCAA

Indoor Championships next week
end in Indianapolis. She will be
competing in the 55-meter dash.
The men should take both the
discus and the hammer throw
events. Last weekend at USC, the
men swept the hammer throw, led
by NCAA provisional qualifier
Dave Popejoy. In the discus, Pat
Stowell wiil be attempting to con
tinue his undefeated season.
Ron George, Stanford Foot
ball's star linebacker, is expected
to lead off the 4XIOO meter relay
as he did last week in Los Angeles.
The meet will also highlight
Fred Carter's seasonal debut in
the 3000-meter steeplechase,
where he is expected to qualify for
the Pacific 10 Championships this
year. The steeplechase is one of
the most fascinating running
events because once a lap every
runner has to jump over a pool of
water. As they began to do last
year, the team will be dying the
water Cardinal red.
"We did that against Cal last
year and they got really pissed
off," said Chisam. Fred will get his
feet red to start off the season."
