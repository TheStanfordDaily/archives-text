The recently completed Cen
tennial Campaign raised $130
million more than its original
goal, for a total of $1,269 billion,
Vice President for Development
John Ford told the Faculty Sen
ate yesterday afternoon.
The five-year Centennial Cam
paign, which at times lagged
behind schedule, raised $32 mil
lion in one month during the fall
Of the total money pledged, Ford
said the University has already
received $1.12 billion.
Faculty praised the efforts of
the Office of Development in the
campaign. "Given the negative
publicity ... the office has done
an absolutely extraordinary job,"
said Political Science Prof.
Stephen Krasner.
Areas of the campaign consid
ered "successful" by Ford included
endowed financial aid and profes
sorships, student residences, ath
letics, the Haas Public Service Cen
ter and the library endowment.
But fund raising for some fea
tured objectives fell short, includ
ing that for Meyer Library, resi
dential education and the arts.
"The basic problem is identify
ing the constituent groups that
will respond in a competitive envi
ronment," Ford said, explaining
why it is difficult to attract donors
to some programs. "Our near
misses were some very big gifts."
The campaign's efforts to raise
funds for campus buildings was
only partially successful. Only
donations for student residences,
which totalled $15.6 million,
exceeded the actual goal. Fund
raising for the Near West Campus
met only half its original target of
$180 million.
"Our cumulative goal was
probably too ambitious, and we
did not reach it," Ford said. "But
you can see a number of successes
around campus," he added, citing
Kimball and Manzanita II dormi-

Tories, Gilbert Biological Sciences
Building and the Ford Center.
The majority of the funds
donated to the campaign came
from a small number of people â€”
the 227 people who gave at least
$1 million accounted for $817
million.
"We do very well at the upper
end of the gift scale," Ford said.
But he said he was also "very
impressed with the way Stanford
has increased its base of donors"
