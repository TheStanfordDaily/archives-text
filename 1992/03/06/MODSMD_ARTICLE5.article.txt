The recently completed Cen
tennial Campaign raised $130
million more than its original
goal, for a total of $1,269 billion,
Vice President for Development
John Ford told the Faculty Sen
ate yesterday afternoon.
The five-year Centennial Cam
paign, which at times lagged
behind schedule, raised $32 mil
lion in one month during the fall
Of the total money pledged, Ford
said the University has already
received $1.12 billion.
Faculty praised the efforts of
the Office of Development in the
campaign. "Given the negative
publicity ... the office has done
an absolutely extraordinary job,"
said Political Science Prof.
Stephen Krasner.
Areas of the campaign consid
ered "successful" by Ford included
endowed financial aid and profes
sorships, student residences, ath
letics, the Haas Public Service Cen
ter and the library endowment.
But fund raising for some fea
tured objectives fell short, includ
ing that for Meyer Library, resi
dential education and the arts.
"The basic problem is identify
ing the constituent groups that
will respond in a competitive envi
ronment," Ford said, explaining
why it is difficult to attract donors
to some programs. "Our near
misses were some very big gifts."
The campaign's efforts to raise
funds for campus buildings was
only partially successful. Only
donations for student residences,
which totalled $15.6 million,
exceeded the actual goal. Fund
raising for the Near West Campus
met only half its original target of
$180 million.
"Our cumulative goal was
probably too ambitious, and we
did not reach it," Ford said. "But
you can see a number of successes
around campus," he added, citing
Kimball and Manzanita II dormi-

Tories, Gilbert Biological Sciences
Building and the Ford Center.
The majority of the funds
donated to the campaign came
from a small number of people —
the 227 people who gave at least
$1 million accounted for $817
million.
"We do very well at the upper
end of the gift scale," Ford said.
But he said he was also "very
impressed with the way Stanford
has increased its base of donors"
in comparison to past campaigns.
Ford credited the campaign's
success to a number of factors,
including the "well-planned"
efforts of the people in his office,
faculty support and the "strong
leadership" of University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, who "bold
ly asked for large sums of money."
Ford said he did not expect
fund raising to drop significantly
now that the campaign is over,
although he does suspect he will
see "some tailing off."
The senate also discussed mak
ing significant changes to its com
mittee structure, possibly estab
lishing a permanent faculty plan
ning and policy board.
An ad hoc committee estab
lished 18 months ago called Stan
com has recommended reducing
the number of senate standing
committees and establishing a
faculty body to study long-term
issues in depth.
Yesterday's discussion was
limited to the planning and policy
board. Although members gener
ally supported the idea, there was

some disagreement over whether
it should be a committee of the
senate or an independent commit
tee accountable to the Academic
Council.
The board might study ideas

such as "strategic planning for
the academic enterprise," the bal
ance between humanities and sci
ences and the impact of athletics
on undergraduate education,
according to the proposal.
