### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
Stanford's overseas pro
gram in Salamanca, Spain,
will close after this year
despite recent announce
ments to the contrary, accord
ing to Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Ewart Thomas.
In yesterday's Faculty
Senate meeting, Thomas said
Stanford may arrange for
students who had planned to
go to Salamanca next year to
attend other universities'
overseas programs in Spain.
The School of Humanities
and Sciences had announced
last week that Salamanca
would stay open for another
year, according to Michael
Predmore, chair of the Span
ish and Portuguese Depart
ment.
"There's been a major
breakdown in communication,"
he said "Last week we were told yes,
and on Tuesday we were tdd that
there was not enough funding to keep
it open."
He called Thomas' suggestion
of sending students to other pro
grams "an alternative — but a
poor one," adding that "other pro
grams are not comparable to
Stanford's."
For example, Stanford's pro

gram houses students in the Uni
versity of Salamanca dormitories,
which gives the students more inte
gration into Spanish life, he said.
Thomas said Salamanca must
be cut for the Overseas Studies
program to meet its budget reduc
tion target.
He said he had tried to keep
the program open another year.
But he added that he decided it
"was wiser to close Salamanca"
when he saw that only a few stu
dents would be affected and that
"there was a good chance these
students could be accommodated

by other programs."
However, Spanish Prof. Mary
Pratt said at the senate meeting
that the program should not have
been cut because it makes money
for the University. Salamanca's
tuition is much lower them Stan
ford's, but students in the pro
gram paid regular Stanford
tuition.
Thomas said he did raise that
point with the Cabinet Commit
tee on Budget and Strategic Plan
ning, but "somehow it wasn't per
suasive. They have a different
way of calculating cuts."
