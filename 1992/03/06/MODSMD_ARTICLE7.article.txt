# Survey on sexual orientation: Some ask how helpful it will be
## 
### Anush Yegyazarian Staff writer 
A survey due back today from all stu
dents, faculty and staff will be used by
the Office of the Dean of Students to pin
point the problems faced by lesbians,
gays and bisexuals on campus.
But some lesbian, gay and bisexual
community members say the survey is
too general and input from people outside
the community will not be very helpful.
The questionnaire, put together by a
working group formed by Dean of Stu

dents Michael Jackson in October, asks
respondents to "tell us what you know or
perceive about life for Stanford students
who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or unsure
of their sexual orientation."
The survey also asks for evaluations in
categories including academic life, resi
dential life and students services. It was
mailed out Feb. 24.
Sophomore Benjamin Morgan, a staff
member at the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center, summed up some reac
tions he had heard by saying, "Who went
out to ask heterosexuals what we need?"

But other community members were
more positive. Eleanor Feingold, a coordi
nator for the LGBCC and a working
group member, said the group is "primar
ily interested in getting responses from
members of the community, but there are
a lot of people, especially undergrads, who
aren't sure of their sexual orientations."
"It's very important to hear from this
group, and [the group] couldn't think of
any other way to reach this group except
through a survey sent out to all members
of the Stanford community," she said.
Asst. Dean of Students Bobbi Braden,

who chairs the working group, said that
as of yesterday she had received about
600 replies.
Braden said survey is designed to get
information not only from community
members but also from other students,
staff and faculty who interact with them.
"We wanted to know what people's
perceptions are," she said.
But Morgan said some of the cate
gories were so broad that he had a diffi
cult time completing the survey. Regard
ing the category "academic life," he said,
"Are they asking if there are gay classes,

if there are professors who are openly
gay, if the homosexuality of historical fig
ures is suppressed?"
Sophomore Rachel Maddow, an
LGBCC staffer, said, "It's important to
get a general assessment of the needs,
but I'm wondering, since [the survey] is
so open-ended and ambiguous, if it will be
possible to implement anything from it."
However, Braden said that based on
some of the responses she has received
people seem to be dealing with the ques-
tions well.
She added that the group's
final recommendations to the
Dean of Students' Office will be
based on more than the informa
tion from the survey.
According to Braden, some of
the survey respondents have
volunteered their names and
phone numbers and the group
will follow up to get more infor
mation.
The group also has informa
tion from questionnaires passed

out by the Gay, Lesbian and
Bisexual Speaker's Bureau after
each of their programs, she said,
and plans to interview student
services providers about their role
in serving the community.
"After we analyze all the data
from the survey and the other
sources, we'll see if there's a need
for more," she said.
According to Braden, the
group modeled the survey on. a
similar one taken by the Universi
ty of Michigan, tailoring it to suit
their own needs.
The results of the survey will
be analyzed beginning in spring
quarter and possibly through fall
quarter, she said.
