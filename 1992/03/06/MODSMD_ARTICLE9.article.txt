# 'Queen squirrel': Meet the most popular rodent on campus
## 
### Jason Montiel Staff writer 
Life is tough when you're a squirrel. Cats
and blue jays and even errant skateboarders
are a threat to your small existence.
But for one little black squirrel named
Dizzy, life is one long feast of walnuts and
peanuts, thanks to the campus staff that have
adopted her.
"When she comes to see me, she stands
there with her little paws up, and peeks
around the door until she catches my eye,"
said Bette Tribbie, secretary for the School of
Earth Sciences.
"She's had quite a history of making
friends wherever she goes," said Tribbie,
adding cautiously, "Then, of course, we do
have the problem of some people that dislike
rodents. They consider squirrels rodents."
But Tribbie and others know better.
Dizzy's visits have become a ritual. "I take
Dizzy breaks every day," Tribbie said. "Every
one else takes coffee breaks."
Tribbie keeps a bowl full of peanuts on her
desk for the times when Dizzy drops by, just as
she has for the past few years.
"It's so unusual to see a squirrel that will
come to you and knows her name," Tribbie
said. "She's got more friends than enemies."
Most of her enemies are the blue jays who
swoop down and steal her peanuts or the cats
who watch from afar. "She has a lot to con
tend with around here," said Tribbie. "But
she's a much better climber than the cat. She
can go right straight up the wall."
Tribbie said Dizzy comes more often when
she has a litter of babies to feed, suggesting
that this may be the mother of all squirrels.
"She's probably responsible for the squirrel
population around here," Tribbie said with a
laugh.
So how did this one squirrel get so wise to
the ways of the world? A lot of it has to do with
a doctoral student who befriended and trained
Dizzy back in 1986.
Nancy Franklin was a student in psycholo
gy when she met Dizzy while sitting in the
summer sun near Terman Engineering Build
ing. She began bringing walnuts for the squir

rel, and within a year, Dizzy was sitting on her
shoulder during each lunchtime.
"I didn't really intend to tame her or teach
her tricks or anything," said Franklin, who grad
uated from Stanford in 1989 and now is a pro
fessor at State University of New York at Stony
brook. "It was just kind of a natural friendship."
Dizzy would come and take walnuts from
Franklin's hand, run away to bury them, then
return for more. "You could see her after
awhile all out of breath and her eyes getting
crossed," said Franklin, describing the squir
rel's wild penchant for nuts that earned her
the name "Dizzy."
"When I first started feeding her, I had no
idea that this was possible," Franklin said.

'She's real smart. I'm kind of
waiting for her to reach up
and open the door or call me
on the phone.'

But this is a squirrel with attitude and
ambition.
"Some of the other squirrels started moving
in the direction of befriending me," Franklin
said. "They really didn't have a chance because
Dizzy wouldn't let them near me."
Franklin cared for her friend for three
years, then various campus employees in
Dizzy's feeding territory took over when she
graduated.
One of these people is Marc Macy, a former
messenger for the Office of Development, who
for four years met Dizzy each day on his cam
pus rounds.
Macy left his job last week to open a pet
supply store and to pursue animal photogra
phy, but he has lots of fond memories of this
sociable squirrel.
"Dizzy is definitely the queen squirrel of
the area," Macy said. "She's the big cheese,
and highly respected by other squirrels. You
can just see it. They just clear the way when

Dizzy comes around."
"She's such a social thing," Macy added. "I
can call her from 50 yards away and she'll
come running."
Macy has even taken care of Dizzy during
weekends and holidays. Last fall, when she
broke a tooth, he nursed her back to health by
bringing her soft food.
"Thank God her tooth grew back really fast
and she's back chowing down," Macy said.
The times he spent petting and visiting
with Dizzy often drew some stares, Macy said.
But overall, he said Dizzy proved to many that
squirrels are not just pests.
"They're not all rabid. They don't all bite,"
Macy explained. "People see this gentle squir
rel jump on my shoulder and they just can't
believe it.
"There's a lot more going on in that little
head than people realize," Macy said. "Squirrels
just don't get the credit they deserve. That's
true with animals in general. This is just a sweet
little creature that we're all nuts about."
As Macy leaves Stanford to tend his new
business, it will mean he will have less time to
care for Dizzy. "I'm going to miss seeing her
daily, but I know she's in good hands," he said.
That includes the hands of Pam Nettle, an
office assistant at Publication Services. Nettle
serves up a variety of fare, but Dizzy prefers
walnuts and the pine cones off of a nearby tree.
Nettle talks to Dizzy and scolds her when
she slips into the office building right behind
human visitors.
"She's real smart," Nettle said. "I'm kind of
waiting for her to reach up and open the door
or call me on the phone."
Although Nettle admits Dizzy can be a little
obnoxious, she still fears for her small friend's
safety in a world full of cats, birds and people.
"I'm kind of protective of her," Nettle said.
"She almost got creamed out here when a kid
on a skateboard passed by."
Reflecting on Dizzy's situation, Nettle notes,
"She's got an easy life, but yet a rough life."
"She's got a rough life if you compare it to
a family pet like a dog," she said. "But she's
got it easy versus a lot of other squirrels,
because she always knows she can come here
and get food."
