Quote of the Day
"Some weren't surprised
at all, but I have one friend
who without fail says Tabba
dabba doo' every time he
calls.''
â€” Tom Petika, on his
friends' reactions to his
house, which has no right
angles. The round house is
hard to miss when driving
up Highway 280 toward
San Francisco, and complete
strangers often ask for tours.
