touchable") village

with my music prof in
a palace setting. Can't
begin to describe In
dia. You'll have to
see the contrasts your
self. Relax! If s only
been a week since you
turned in your appli
cation to Semester at
Sea. I'm sure youll hear
from them soon Glad
to hear that Jamie and
Ben want to apply
too. Tell them to call
800-854-0195 for ap
plications.
