Here's a way to learn faster and work
smarter without putting a lot of cash down.
It's called the Apple Computer Loan.
Right now, qualifying students, parents
borrowing on behalf of students, and faculty
and staff members with an annual income
of at least $15,000, can purchase an Apple*
Macintosh" computer system using a special
financing plan set up just for you.
Apply to borrow from $1,500 to $10,000
for a Macintosh computer, other Apple
products—including the ApploCare'
extended service plan, and up to three soft
ware packages.
If you're a student, you'll be able to defer
principal payments for up to 48 months while
in school, making interest-only payments until
30 days after you graduate or leave school.
Interest rates arc surprisingly low, and you can
take up to eight years to repay*
So stop by today and fill out a loan
application.
Because this is one way to afford a
Macintosh, even if you can't afford
