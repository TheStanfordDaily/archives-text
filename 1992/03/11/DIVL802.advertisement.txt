We give credit where
it's due.
New graduates are critical to the success of Household Credit
Services. That's why we established the Management Associ
ate Program (MAP). It's the quickest way to turn your degree
into solid work experience, while making wise decisions about
long-term careers in the growing field of financial services.
MAP offers you the chance to see the inner workings of
different business units here at Household. It's a great way
to gauge your aptitude, find your area of interest, and earn a
good salary. Upon completion of the program, you'll be ready
for a rewarding opportunity with Household Credit Services,
one of America's leading credit card issuers. A company
known for its environment of innovation and support.
On-campus interviews will be held on
Monday, April 20th.
For the July program, Household is particularly interested in
students about to earn an Economics or Communications
degree. Visit the Career Planning and Placement Office now
to sign-up for an interview. If your schedule doesn't allow for
an on-campus interview, send your resume to Household
