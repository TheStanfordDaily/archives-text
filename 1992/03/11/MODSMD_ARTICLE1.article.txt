Former Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev will deliver an address
open to students when he returns to
Stanford May 9, according to
Hoover Institution Distinguished
Fellow George Shultz.
Shultz, a former secretary of
state, said arrangements have
not yet been made for distribut
ing tickets. A lottery system was
used during Gorbachev's visit
two years ago.
Gorbachev will also visit the
Law School and Hoover, if he fol
lows his tentative schedule. Law
School Dean Paul Brest said he
and Shultz, who is chairing the
host committee for Gorbachev's
16-day trip to the United States,
have been planning the visit "for
several months."
"But it is a fast-changing situ
ation," Brest warned, adding that
Gorbachev's campus itinerary
will likely be finalized in a meet
ing next Monday.
Gorbachev currently plans to
arrive in the United States May 1.
He will meet with former presi
dents Ronald Reagan and Jimmy
Carter according to a statement
prepared by an international
media coordination group.
The former Soviet leader will
also speak at Harvard University
and give the commencement
address at Emory University in
Atlanta, Georgia.
He will arrive in San Francisco
May 7 and address a large public
gathering before heading for
Stanford.
A main reason for Gorbachev's
visit to the Bay Area is the inspec
tion of the San Francisco headquar
ters of the newly created Gorbachev
Foundation/USA, a non-profit insti
tution founded to support democra
cy in the former Soviet Union.
