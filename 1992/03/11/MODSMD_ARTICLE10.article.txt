# Enforcement of policy on Dead Week is questioned
## 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
Many students complain that Dead Week is
anything but "dead." Hoping the week will allow
them to catch up on their studies, they find them
selves writing term papers and doing problem sets
instead.
And students aren't the only ones complaining.
At a Jan. 23 Faculty Senate meeting, Classics
Prof. Marsh McCall called for "more vigilance of
the Dead Week policy."
University President Donald Kennedy told the
senate, "A chronic student complaint deals with
violations of the Dead Week exam and paper poli
cy. I care about it because I get blamed."
The University's Dead Week Policy Statement,
regularly printed in time schedules and Courses
and Degrees, reads: "Instructors should neither

make extraordinary assignments nor announce
additional course meetings" during Dead Week,
excepting optional review sessions.
Students have typically complained about
heavy reading assignments and term papers due
during Dead Week. For example, students use the
laser printers at the Tresidder LaIR cluster 70
percent more during Dead Week than during the
rest of the quarter, as measured by the number of
pages printed.
"Certainly there are violations of Dead Week
policy," said Assoc. Education Prof. Edward
Haertel, co-chair of the Committee on Academic
Achievement and Appraisal.
But Haertel said that although it is easy to
mandate a University-wide policy, it is difficult to
insist that individual faculty members "do things
in a certain way."
But Council of Presidents
member Beth Morgan said that
because the policy is not enforced,
"for a lot of people, Dead Week is
a lot more burdensome than
finals week, even."
Morgan, a junior, said a better
policy would be a "two-day read
ing period" similar to those used
at other schools.
At Stanford, when new materi
al is given during the last week of
classes, the present policy
"doesn't give you enough time to
ask questions to fully understand
it," she said.
Several East Coast universities
that use the semester system,
including Harvard and Princeton,
have reading periods. Duke Uni
versity has both a Dead Week and
a two-day reading period.
Gerald Wilson, Duke's Senior
Assoc. Dean of Arts and Sciences,
said that at Duke, no professor
can hold a class during the read
ing period and no work is due dur
ing the reading period.
But Haertel rejected the read
ing period idea as impractical for
Stanford. "I personally would find
it troublesome because the quar
ter is so short," he said.
The Dead Week Policy also states
that "no musical, dramatic or ath
letic events involving compulsory

student participation may be sched
uled, unless approved as exceptions
by the Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement."
But Haertel said the question
of athletic events at Stanford has
"always been a difficult area. ... I
think there are some exceptions
made."
Acting Registrar Jack Farrell
agreed, adding that "special con

sideration is given" by faculty
members to the students who
participate in athletic events.
Morgan said the ASSU Senate
and other student organizations
occasionally hold meetings in vio
lation of the Dead Week Policy
Statement.
The statement prohibits meet
ings normally requiring student
participation during Dead Week.
