# Pilot project on computerized registration gets good reviews
## 
### John Ford Staff writer 
Last quarter 500 students got
a sneak preview of the Universi
ty's new computerized registra
tion system, and so far, the
results are a big "thumbs up."
The system — whose name has
been changed from "Student
Access" to the more Stanford
friendly "Axess" — will be used by
all students beginning next quarter.
Members of the pilot group,
who used the system to submit
their study lists and perform
other functions like declaring a
mostly said they liked the
new system.
"It was one of the highlights of
my year," said senior Brett Toll
man, a pilot group member, who
said he far preferred the new sys
tem to waiting in line to turn in
his study list.
"Who wants to go to Old
Union?" asked junior A 1 Namath,
who also used the system.
Axess will also allow students
to view their courses and grades,

change their official address, order
transcripts and apply for gradua
tion, according to Elizabeth
Hodge, systems development ana
lyst for the Office of the Registrar.
The Registrar's office conduct
ed a survey of the pilot group ear
lier this quarter and found that
52 percent thought the system
was "very easy to use." Another
41 percent said it was "okay," and
seven percent felt the system was
"somewhat difficult" or "diffi
cult" to use.
Most students listed conve
nience as the best aspect of the new
program, according to Hodge.
The biggest complaints came
at the beginning of winter quarter
when a problem with the main
frame computer made the system
unavailable to students for about
a day, according to Tim Flood,
application programming manag
er for the Network for Student
Information.
Some students also complained
that the system was too slow,
according to Hodge.
The bulk of the pilot group —

which used the computerized sys
tem to register for winter quarter
classes — was made up of stu
dents from Serra and graduate
students from selected depart
ments, he said.
The project — originally slated
to take about five years to com
plete — is being put into place "a
couple of years ahead of sched
ule," Flood said.
Hodge said the project is being
put into place early partly because
of budget cuts. The computerized
process will "take the middle man
out" by reducing the need for
employees to enter student infor
mation into the computers,
according to Hodge.
Hodge said "the jury is still
out" on how much money the sys
tem will save the University, say
ing it will depend upon how many
departments use it as a labor-sav
ing device.
The Financial Aids Office and
the Bursar's Office may use the
system to allow students to apply
for loans or view their current
account, Flood said.
