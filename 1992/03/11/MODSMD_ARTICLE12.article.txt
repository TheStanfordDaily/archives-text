# Inside local landmark's rounded walls
## 
### Kristen Schmid Staff writer 
Complete strangers stand in his
driveway and take pictures every
day when the weather is good, and
about three times a month they'll
venture up to the door and ask to
look through his house.
You would think it's the home
of a movie star, or a historical land
mark — but it's the private resi
dence of Tom Petika and his wife.
For some reason, the fact that
their house has no right angles is
an irresistible attraction to people.
Admittedly, it's almost impos
sible not to notice the house when
driving down Interstate Highway
280 toward San Francisco; the
joined cluster of dome-like rooms
is a definite contrast to the the
surrounding All-American, Brady
Bunch homes.
Living in a house where all the
walls are rounded can pose some
interior decorating problems.
"There are no pictures on the
wall," Petika said. "Instead we
have rugs and art objects. It just
wasn't appropriate to have
frames on a curved wall."
The Petikas' decision to live in

a round world received mixed
reactions from their friends.
"Some weren't surprised at all,
but I have one friend who without
fail says 'Yabba dabba doo' every
time he calls," Petika said.
The house's unusual architec

ture was what appealed to him. He
saw the house six years ago and
bought it immediately. "I'm
impulsive," he said.
And Petika seems very happy
to have followed this impulse.
This is his twelfth home, but now

he says,"I hope I never have to
move. It's a fun house, comfort
able, bright and airy with plenty
of room. It's just a neat place — I
haven't been disappointed."
The house was built about 12
years ago by an unknown archi
tect who, according to Petika,
"liked the concept (of a complete
ly round house) so much he went
ahead and built one. He was sure
he would be able to sell a lot (of
similar houses) somewhere, but
he encountered financial difficul
ty and never pursued the idea."
The idea was certainly an
ambitious one. All the rooms of
the 3,200 square-foot house were
formed by steel girders with aero
nautical strength balloons and
gunnite on the inside, and con
crete on the outside. All this was
necessary to build a house with no
right angles.
Could this mode of housing
become the norm? "I hope people
will build more," Petika said. "If
they are truly interested in energy
efficiency they should. This is the
most energy efficient house I've
ever lived in — warm in the win
ter and nice and cool in the sum
mer."

The unique "rounded" home of Tom Petika, visible to anyone driving
north on Interstate 280, has become something of a tourist attraction.
