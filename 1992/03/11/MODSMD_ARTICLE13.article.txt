Clinton, Bush big Super Tuesday winners
WASHINGTON (AP) — Bill Clinton won an unbroken string
of Southern landslides yesterday, brushing past Paul Tsongas to
establish front-runner credentials in the Democratic presidential
race. President Bush notched an eight-state Republican shutout
of Patrick Buchanan.
Bush emerged from Super Tuesday with half the delegates need
ed to secure renomination, while Clinton had a third of the dele
gates needed on the Democratic side.
On the busiest night of the primary season, Bush won eight
states, from Boston to Austin. Buchanan's protest vote dwindled
somewhat from earlier elections and Bush picked up at least 65
percent of the GOP vote in each state but Rhode Island and
Louisiana, where he came close.
Clinton, the Democrats' pre-primary favorite until confronted
with a sequence of character questions in February, piled up
Southern margins so lopsided that Tsongas was left limping as
the primary calendar turns to Illinois and Michigan.
The Arkansas governor was winning twice as many Super
Tuesday delegates as Tsongas and flexed his muscles in the key
states of Florida and Texas. He enjoyed margins of 65 percent or
more of the popular vote in Texas, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Missis
sippi and Louisiana and the Missouri caucuses.
