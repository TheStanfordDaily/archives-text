Hospital and nurses reach agreement
Stanford University Hospital and representatives of its nurs
es' union yesterday reached a tentative agreement on a two-year
contract after lengthy negotiations and a threatened nurses'
strike.
"It's tentative until the voters pass it," said Kim Griffin, the
union's executive vice president. The union membership will vote
to accept or reject the revised contract Thursday.
The union passed a strike vote March 2, in response to unsuc
cessful negotiations with the Hospital over wages and working
conditions. The proposed strike authorized by the vote was never
called.
Although neither Griffin nor hospital officials would disclose
details of the new contract, Griffin said she "expects that our
members will be satisfied by the agreement."
The union represents the hospital's staff of 1,026 registered
nurses.
Stanford meets recycling goal early
The Stanford community met its state-mandated recycling
goal five years early, according to statistics collected by Peninsu
la Sanitary Service.
Stanford recycled 25.4 percent of its solid waste in 1990, the
most recent year for which statistics are available. Assembly Bill
939 requires communities to divert a quarter of their solid waste
by 1995, increasing that percentage to half by the year 2000.
The Stanford Recycling Center currently accepts glass, alu
minum, tin, cardboard, newspapers, magazines, paper, telephone
