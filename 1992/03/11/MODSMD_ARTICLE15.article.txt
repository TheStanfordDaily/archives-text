# Varnedoe to stress importance of the arts

Kirk who? Glad you asked.
Putting function over form, Stanford has
chosen art curator Kirk Varnedoe as this
year's commencement speaker. And although
his may not be a household name, Varnedoe
promises to deliver a substantive two cents on
a number of topics, including the arts and
humanities at Stanford and beyond.
"So much important information in the
world today is visual," Varnedoe said. "Being
able to control, generate and understand visu
al media is at least as important as reading
books in contemporary society."
Varnedoe, director of the Department of
Painting and Sculpture at New York's Museum
of Modern Art, regards his selection as a recog
nition of the importance of the arts at Stanford.
"I'm someone to speak for the side of a
Stanford education representing the arts and
a well-lived life," he said. "I want to emphasize
the importance of arts in education and serve
as a spokesman of the arts in general."
Varnedoe, who received his master's and

doctoral degrees in art history
from Stanford in 1970 and
1972, said he has been affect
ed by recently proposed cuts
to art programs as both a
museum curator and a Stan
ford alumnus.
"At [the museum], we've
been forced to rethink our
programming priorities as
we've been faced with

reduced funds," he said. "It's inspired what we
like to call 'creative thinking.' "
Varnedoe has also been keeping abreast of
the proposed cuts at Stanford. "I wrote a letter
on behalf of the art and photo departments,"
he said. "Deep cuts in arts and humanities are
the wrong way to go."
Varnedoe has a history of defending what
he values. As a Stanford student in the politi
cally turbulent days of the early 19705, he was
involved in several conflicts between student
demonstrators and police.
"The whiff of tear gas is a distinct memo
ry," Varnedoe said. "There were nightly con
frontations and demonstrations on campus.

In these frays, professors were standing out
defending the new art building. Everyone was
totally obsessed with the day-to-day drama,
and people were defending what was impor
tant to them."
Art Prof. Albert Elsen remembers that in
one clash, Varnedoe was sprayed with tear
gas, stumbled into the art building and had to
be rinsed off by people inside.
But Varnedoe prefers the more peaceful
memories of his student life. "I had an excep
tionally good educational experience at Stan
ford," he said.
As a curator, Varnedoe has organized
exhibits on everything from "Protest Art from
California Campuses" to "Realism and Sym
bolism in Scandinavian Painting."
Varnedoe said he has never spoken at a
graduation before and, in fact, did not attend
his own Stanford graduation because he was
doing research in Europe. But he knows this
engagement won't be an ordinary speech.
"The problem for me as an artist is that I'm
used to two slide projectors in a darkened
room," he said. "Stanford Stadium and 30,000
people is a little different."
