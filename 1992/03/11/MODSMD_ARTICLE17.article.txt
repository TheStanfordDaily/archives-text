## Save storage service 
### 
Res Ed must reverse a
budget-cutting plan to
slash summer storage

IN A BUDGET-CUTTING MOVE
that would further deteriorate the
quality of life for students at Stan
ford, the Office of Residential Educa
tion plans to cancel summer storage
at most large dormitories. And
they're only saving about $4,000.
Beginning in 1993, summer
storage will be canceled in Wilbur
Hall, Stern Hall, Florence Moore
Hall, Roble Hall, Lagunita Court
and possibly Toyon Hall and parts
of Governor's Corner.
To end such a valuable service
— one that is extremely inexpen
sive and has been a conve
nience for frazzled students during
finals week — is simply silly
Council of Presidents member
John Overdeck, one of the members
of the committee that recommend
ed the change, opposed it. He said
he does not see "why storing stuff in
empty rooms is so expensive."
Overdeck argues that the Uni
versity should continue the ser
vice, which costs "less than one or
two dollars per student." Accord
ing to Associate Director of Res Ed
Elizabeth Hiyama, cutting storage
will save $4,200.
That paltry amount does not
warrant ending a successful service.
Hiyama, defending the cut, said her
office is "really trying to see what
the high priority items are — and
storage was not one of those items."
Res Ed has miscalculated the
extent to which students depend
on summer storage. The vast
majority of undergraduates use
storage for at least one year of
their Stanford career, because it is
the most efficient, least costly and
least time-consuming way to store
their belongings.
And most undergraduates don't
have cars, making access to expensive
off-campus storage — which aver
ages about $35 per month — difficult.

In addition, cutting storage would
discriminate against poorer stu
dents, who are less likely to have
cars and would be harder hit by the
$100 or so they would pay for stor
age each summer.
Hiyama's suggestion to create
an ASSU "storage shuttle" that
would ferry students and their pos
sessions to these off-campus busi
nesses is not an adequate solution.
Her proposal would hand the
ASSU another business project —
and hand local businesses more
profits at the expense of students
— when the same service can be
provided for only $4,200 by the
University.
A better solution would be to
charge each student wishing to
store belongings a nominal fee.
University President Donald
Kennedy opposes creating new stu
dent fees as a remedy for budget
problems. When the University
announced that it had rejected Cow
ell's proposal to add a quarterly fee,
he said: "People feel they Eire being
nibbled to death by small ducks."
In this case, however, a fee
would be preferable to the alterna
tives the University and the ASSU
are currently exploring.
Storing bicycles for the summer
already costs $10, and adding an
extra $2 or so would be a vastly
better option than creating a "stor
age shuttle" that would provide a
service exactly the same as the cur
rent one, but more expensively and
less conveniently.
An even better solution than
charging a fee, however, is this:
Res Ed should find a different
place to cut $4,200. The office has
clearly misread students' reliance
on summer storage, and needs to
rethink its decision in terms of stu
dent needs.
For example, if Res Ed officials
conducted a random telephone poll
of undergraduates they would find
that most students want to see
summer storage continued in its
present form.
Res Ed's decision should be re
versed and summer storage should
receive the priority it deserves.
