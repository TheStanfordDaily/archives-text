Graduation speaker not really an 6 imaginative choice 9

THE SELECTION OF Kirk Varne
doe as graduation speaker this
year is indeed "a very imaginative
choice," to borrow the words of Art Prof.
Albert Elsen.
It takes a great deal of imagination to
believe that his name would be recog
nized by more than a tiny minority of
students or guests at graduation. It
takes further imagination to conclude
that Varnedoe would have any broad
appeal whatsoever among the senior
class.
A quick and informal poll of seniors
yielded a nearly universal response won
dering what Varnedoe had to say about
commencement or our future. Perhaps,
then, there is a discrepancy between the
expectations of students and the expec

tations of those who are responsible for
selecting the commencement speaker.
The problem with name recognition
pops up immediately. Since we attend a
significant national university, we believe
it is reasonable to expect a commence
ment speaker of national importance.
It is also much easier to explain to
your friends and family that Ted Koppel
is speaking than Kirk Varnedoe. Grant
ed, name recognition is not sufficient to
make a good commencement speaker.
Inspiration comes not only from a
recognized name, but also from a speak
er's accomplishments. Varnedoe is not
an artist; he is "an authority on 19th
and 20th century European painting and
sculpture, law and visual art" and he is
currently the director of the Department

of Painting and Sculpture at New York's
Museum of Modern Art.
He has been a professor at Stanford
and Columbia. Apparently a peaceful
person, he was a nonviolent protestor
while at Stanford. He also played rugby.
Basically, we would prefer a creator to
a curator.
It seems that there were substantial
Stanford politics involved in his selec
tion. With the cuts proposed to the arts
at Stanford, this seems slightly ironic
and akin to handing back to a decapitat
ed man his head.
We feel this is an inappropriate place
to try to make a statement in support of
the arts at Stanford. The choice of a
commencement speaker "in support of
the arts" will not bring back their bud

get. In addition, the statement seems
weak, because Varnedoe is not an artist.
We have no qualms about Varnedoe
as a person, nor are we aware of his
speaking ability. We also do not object to
having an artist to speak at commence
ment.
In 20 years, we will probably most
remember Kirk Varnedoe because of our
initial objection to him. We still hope for
a good speech, but we believe a more
qualified speaker could have been select
ed to give it.
