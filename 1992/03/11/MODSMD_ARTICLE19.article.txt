# Govt interference in the arts is intolerable
## 
### 
I write in response to Arnold Beich
man's letter published in the March 4
issue of The Daily. Beichman cleverly
dismisses the real question (which is
precisely whether government should
decide what is art) and raises instead
some hypothetical situations which
seem calculated to offend his readers.
try a different hypothetical sit
uation. What if the Jesse Ilelmses of
this world decided to poke their noses
into the work of Hoover Institution
research fellows? What if the pervading
attitude in Congress was that research
in Beichman's subject area was a waste
of public money or even offensive?
Beichman might well object that
Congress should leave the work of
scholars to scholars, who, it is to be
hoped, cherish intellectual freedom. Or
would he be happy to do whatever
research was deemed "acceptable" by
the (moral) majority? I hardly th nk so.

It seems to me that we should leave
art to artists and that the decision as to
who shall receive government support is
best made on aesthetic grounds by
artists' peers.
Where would we be without Manet's
"D6jeuner sur l'herbe" or Duchamp's
clever toilet seat — both of which were
vilified in their time?
If we had been forced to listen to
those who shout the loudest, we would
have been deprived of the opportunity to
view Robert Mapplethorpe's pho
tographs.
Many who saw these photographs will
agree, I think, that they are of uncom
mon beauty. Indeed, an important part
of their interest consists in precisely the
fact that such ostensibly vulgar subjects
can be seen in such a light.
To answer his question: since the
alternative is unacceptable, yes, art
should be supported "regardless of the
message it conveys." If you don't like it,
don't look, but at least allow me to
decide for myself whether I will.
