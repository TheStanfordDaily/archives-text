# Women urged to make their own voices heard

I went to a fraternity formal recently.
The night was drawing to a close when
several of the people at the party began
smoking cigarettes. One brother was
walking around the room exhaling his
smoke in other people's faces.
He came to me, mouth full of smoke,
and I reached up and put my hand over
his mouth and pushed him away. He
pushed my hand away and said to me,
"You're cute but you're not that cute."
I said to him, "All I wanted was for
you not to blow smoke in my face." He
took another drag, again filled his mouth
with smoke, and again I put my hand
over his mouth and pushed him away.
He shoved my hand away once more,
blew the smoke in my face, and said,
"Don't get cocky."
I repeated what I said before. He then
held his hand up, ready to accept my
high-five. Just a joke. No hard feelings.
Perhaps it was my fault though after

all. Perhaps if I were a little bit "cuter" I
would have been spared this man's
cigarette smoke in my face, but, my physi
cal appearance being what it is, I was not
exempted from such an obnoxious gesture.
And perhaps I was asking for it the
second time when I dared to try to stop
him. If resistance by a woman (and one,
moreover, not even that cute!) to such a
disgusting act denoted "cockiness" then
surely I was at fault.
At this same party I was shocked by
the number of women I saw who had
evident eating disorders.
Women, wake up! These men for
whom you are starving yourselves are
the same ones who objectify you and
dehumanize you, who judge you on the
basis of your looks and condemn you for
showing any signs of insurgency.
When a man blows smoke in your face
don't laugh like it's all just a funny joke.
Sure, you may look cuter smiling and gig
gling, but in a world where a woman who
stands up for herself is condemned for being
cocky, it is imperative that you get angry.
