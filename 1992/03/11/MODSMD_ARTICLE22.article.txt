'It's the
month when
office copier
machines
get their
toughest
workouts.'

IT'S THE GREATEST MONTH in
sports — when everyone from a CPA
to a comparative literature major lets
the bookie in him consume his conscience.
The month when office copier
machines get their toughest workouts as
everyone jumps into the pool.
The month when 64 of the best college
basketball teams in the country do battle
in a two-and-a-half week, one-loss-and
you-go-home tournament known simply
as March Madness.
Gone are the days of Dick Vitale stand
ing on his head because a team from a col
lege whose cheer is "Let's go (Austin)
Peay" somehow managed to defeat Illinois.
With all 63 of the tournament games
now televised by CBS, there is no longer
any room for a bunch of not-ready-for
prime-time fanatics at ESPN to guide
junkies through the 32-games-in-36-
hours marathon that is the first round of
the tournament.
But the spectacle of dunks and basketball
punks Ls still the greatest show on Earth —
the one sporting event that does Yogi Berra
proud: It truly ain't over till it's over.
The Madness easily tops the Super
Bowl, all too often a 45-minute game fol
lowed by a three-hour, all-you-can-drink
fest. Even the World Series places second.
Yes, there have been great moments —
unforgettable homers from Fisk, Jackson,
Gibson and Puckett stand out from our
lifetime — but the tournament is fantastic

every year and through all of its games.
Though you never bet on the right
ones, you know upsets are going to hap
pen. If it's not Austin Peay who surprises
the experts, it's Cleveland State or East
Tennessee State, or just last year, the
Richmond Spiders, who gave Syracuse
the quick boot in a first-round upset.
Then there are the superhuman indi
vidual performances. Like when David
Robinson propelled Navy over Syracuse.
(They do the losing thing a lot.) Or when
Michigan's Rumeal Robinson lived out
every fan's dream, stepping up to the foul
line to tie and then beat Seton Hall in
overtime of the 1989 finals.
Two years ago, there was Tate George's
baseline jumper off a length-of-the-court
pass with less than a second to go to lift
Connecticut. And then Duke's Christian
Laettner returned the favor with a buzzer
beater of his own in the next round.
Keith Smart beat Syracuse (If by now
you're thinking maybe Jim Boeheim isn't
that great a coach, well, you're right.) in
the closing seconds of the 1987 finals.
And Lorenzo Charles somehow showed
up at the base of the rim to grab Derrick
Whittenberg's prayer to give the North
Carolina State Wolfpack an incredible
championship win over the Phi Slamma
Jamma fraternity from Houston.
But even more stunning than the
efforts of the individuals have been the
teams that have peaked at just the right

time. Some have been powerhouses like
UNLV and Duke the last two years. Oth
ers like the Wolfpack and the 1988
Kansas team were never given a chance
to win until after it was over. And then
there was Villanova.
To call any college basketball game the
greatest or even one of them is to ignore
the innumerable great games that have
been played. But if one had to be picked,
the 1985 final between the Patrick
Ewing-led Georgetown Hoyas and Rollie
Massimino's Wildcats would have to be
the choice here. In a spectacular team
effort, Villanova played a near perfect
game and somehow managed to frustrate
the Hoyas just enough to win.
It's the emotion — of the fans, the
players, the coaches, even the announc
ers — that makes the NCAA tournament
what it is. No sporting event can stimu
late the same adrenaline rush — especial
ly for the viewer at home. Indeed, the
broadcast team is rendered superfluous
as the grace, skill and hard work of the
athletes engulfs the attention and pas
sion of all those who watch.

Ari Richter likes Niemeyer to repeat in
the Calcutta.
