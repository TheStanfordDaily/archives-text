Suppression of expressions of dissent is indoctrination

THE MARCH 2 DAILY EDITORIAL
warns against government censor
ship of the arts. Two days later,
Arnold Beichman, in a letter to The
Daily, tells us that he is concerned.
He worries that we are all being
duped. Under the guise of freedom of
expression, the government funds art
that displeases Arnold.
Serrano's "Piss-Christ" provides his
case in point. How can we condone
putting Jesus in urine while condemning
the desecration of a symbol of Black
Pride or a Star of David?
Fair and equal treatment of ideas is
under attack once again. Political cor
rectness (Beichman doesn't name the
double standard he purports to expose,
so I take the liberty to label it for him)
strikes another blow against democracy
and justice. Or does it?
Comparing the plight of (white)

Christians and that of African Ameri
cans or Moslems or Jews in this country
is sadly simplistic. Furthermore, it is
profoundly anti-intellectual. The Cross
is a symbol that carries great spiritual
and religious significance to many.
Those individuals have every right to
take personal offense to its immersion in
urine.
But, to many others, the Cross is also
a symbol of religious, cultural and often
political hegemony. For them, there is
no double standard here.
As an undergraduate, I attended a
university founded by Presbyterian min
isters. Princeton continues to hold a part
of commencement services in its chapel.
Stanford is the proud owner of a beauti
ful church.
Seconds after the last forkful of
turkey and stuffing are consumed, we
are bombarded by the trappings of the

"winter holidays."
Most students take winter vacation.
Television airs Frosty the Snowman,
Rudolph the Red-Nose Reindeer and The
Little Drummer Boy. Employees get
"winter" bonuses. The major depart
ment stores display Nativity scenes, pur
chase enormous Christmas trees, offer
special "holiday time" credit lines.
Of course, none of these are about
generic winter. They are about Christ
mas, White Christmas, the holiday
proudly celebrated by a vast majority of
this nation's residents.
This past December, I purchased a
sandwich at a local deli. As I was leaving,
the clerk wished me a Merry Christmas.
He is Iranian. I am Jewish.
Christianity is a part of all of our lives
regardless of our heritage. African cul
ture, Islam and Judaism are not. Should
art (or scholarship) that seeks to be con

troversial be judged by the same stan
dards as that which seeks to reinforce
cultural norms?
There is an adage popular among edu
cators: everyone likes to teach critical
thinking, but few want a class full of
critical thinkers.
The demand for equal time, fair treat
ment of ideas and an "even" playing
field promises such an outcome.
Critical thought can be heard all
right. It's protected under free speech.
But what does it take to convey an
understanding of a non-mainstream
position?
To demand that the same standards
be applied to assessing the appropriate
ness of art that seeks to take one pebble
off the hegemonic wall of dominant cul
ture is to deny the value of real and
forceful dissent. That, quite simply, is
indoctrination.

Americans' obsession with fairness
and justice belies a closeted disdain for
the very jewel of our Constitution: the
right to fight for change through dissent
protected under the law - not because
safeguarding unpopular ideas is fair, but
because it is essential.
Protecting established, mainstream
political and cultural norms from
expressions of dissent, whether liberal,
radical or off-the-wall does not promote
freedom of expression, but rather denies
it.
To demand equal treatment of main
stream and minority ideas is to preserve
the status quo, no more, no less. But
that is, after all, what Beichman and his
colleagues at Hoover are all about.
Fair is fair, right? As long as it's a
white, white world.
