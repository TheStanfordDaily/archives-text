# Seniors ought to shed Philistine disposition
## 
### 
This year's commencement speaker
has been announced and it's time for the
Annual Stanford Seniors' Moaning Con
test to be reported in your pages.
"He may be an excellent speaker, but
I wouldn't call him a widely known
luminary or anything of the sort," says
one. "What's he going to tell us?" asks
another. "Last year's guy (the Hon.
John W. Gardner) talked about public
service. I guess this guy will tell us to
paint."
For those of us still struggling to
retain the belief that this is (in Jane
Stanford's phrase) "a university of
high degree," as well as those who
would like to affirm the decisions of

the admirable former Dean of Admis
sions Jean Fetter, these annual bleats
are dispiriting.
Whence came these anti-intellectual
Philistines? (If you don't know the word
you might look it up. Hint: Goliath was
a Philistine luminary).
Why were their parents willing to pay
Stanford's tuition if four years on the
Farm were going to teach them no more
than they exhibit in their comments?
Presumably, their ideal commence
ment speaker would be some combina
tion of Pat Buchanan and Gennifer
Flowers — plenty of name recognition
there, even for non-readers.
"What's he going to tell us?" Well,
if he knew you, which fortunately he
does not (after all, he did accept the
invitation to come here), he might
suggest that you discover, however
belatedly, the joys of intellectual

curiosity. Or he might tell you that
smugness, arrogance and ignorance,
each bad in itself, are truly lethal in
combination.
Or he might just tell you, "Grow up!"
