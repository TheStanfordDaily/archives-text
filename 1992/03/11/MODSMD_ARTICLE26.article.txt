# Scholars' insights can affect our perceptions

### 
About the fine, imaginative choice of
art historian and alumnus Kirk Varne
doe as a commencement speaker, it is
sad indeed that some beneficiaries of a
Stanford education would react with a
preference for a widely known lumi
nary.
Or that they would say "What is he
going to tell us?" or "He didn't do them

(the paintings in the Museum of Modern
Art). All he does is look at them."
Those seniors might realize . . . some
day .. . that the arts and the profound,
original thinking and writing of such
scholars as Varnedoe have to do with
culture and language and asthetics, with
perceptions and judgement.. . with life.
May it dawn on them after gradua
tion.
