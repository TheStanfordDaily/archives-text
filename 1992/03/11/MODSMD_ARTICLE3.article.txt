# Dekes get a sharp warning on house
## They'll lose it if danger continues 
### Leigh Burnside Staff writer 
Delta Kappa Epsilon mem
bers could be forced to vacate
their house during spring
quarter if the potentially fatal
acts directed at the fraternity
continue, according to Row
Director Diana Conklin.
Meanwhile, the Deke mem
bers, who are keeping night
watches to find out who has
started fires, created a gas leak
and poisoned drinks there in
the last year, warned that the
potential for eviction might
encourage the culprit.
"We clearly can't let the inci
dents continue indefinitely,"
Conklin said. The University is

"out of options" and "cannot
justify letting the risk go on any
longer."
But Deke President John
Momtazee said leaving the
house is not "a viable alterna
tive" because the fraternity
and the administration should
not "give in to terrorism."
If members are forced to
vacate the house, the Universi
ty will place the 30 residents in
draw-assigned housing, said
Row Office Coordinator Gari
De-Jauregui.
Five dangerous acts have
been committed against the
Dekes in the last year. In April,
members found coffee and
grape juice in the house laced with
paint thinner and plant fertilizer,
respectively. An unknown person
also started a fire by placing two
containers of kerosene in the oven.
Last month, someone turned
on the gas and extinguished the
pilot lights in the Dekes' oven,
allowing the gas to free-flow. The
University subsequently replaced
the gas oven with an electric one.
Most recently, a bush behind
the house was set ablaze Feb. 28.
The Stanford Police have no
suspect in the incidents, but have
linked the crimes and say the cul
prit will face a long list of felony

charges if caught.
Conklin said the perpetrator
might also face a civil suit, could be
expelled if he is a Stanford student
and could have his degree rescind
ed if he is a Stanford graduate.
A fraternity member said the
Dekes have attempted to deter
mine who might bear such ani
mosity toward them, cataloguing
past romantic relationships and
recalling confrontations.
At least two of the residence's
five boarders have said they will
move out over spring break.
But fraternity members, who
spoke on condition of anonymity,
said they would like to remain in
the house and argued that the
culprit's attempts to break their
solidarity would be rewarded if
the Dekes had to move.

Momtazee said he is "comfort
able with the efforts taken to
ensure the Deke house is a safe
place to live."
Asst. Tresidder Director Nanci
Howe, who deals with Greek
affairs, said the University's main
concern is for the individuals in
the house and that any action
taken would not be disciplinary in
nature.
Conklin said the University
will not necessarily respond by
moving the fraternity members to
other residences and that the
University is committed to help
ing the fraternity first.
Stanford Police Detective Tim
Frecceri refused to discuss the
police investigation, but said, "We
don't consider it a prank â€” we're
taking it very seriously."
