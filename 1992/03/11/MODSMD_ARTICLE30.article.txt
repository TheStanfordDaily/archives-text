Downing 36 beers in a single
evening wasn't anything
unusual for Paul, a gradu
ate student in one of Stanford's
professional schools.
Neither were "blackouts" —
periods of time when Paul was so
drunk he didn't know what he
was doing, and didn't remember
anything when he woke up the
next afternoon. Paul would bond
with his drinking buddies the
next day by swapping stories
about the things each other had
done.
"They were usually stupid
things," Paul said, "like a friend
standing on a table, tearing off
his clothes and streaking."
One experience shocked him
into thinking he might have a
problem with alcohol.
After a night of drinking
games, Paul went back to the
well-stocked bar in his room and
knocked back two shots of scotch.
He remembers "talking to a knot
of friends in the hall," and then
stumbling around in the bath
room while getting ready for bed.
"What I would learn," Paul
said, "is that I grabbed the near
est fire extinguisher and started
hosing this guy down."
Paul said he chased his quarry
around the dorm and outside,
where the campus police joined
suit. He escaped "after doing
some acrobatic feats," but his
friend got caught and gave Paul's
name to the police.
"I remember waking up the
next morning, afternoon — what
ever it was — and hearing my
roommate talking on the phone
about it. I thought he was setting
me up for a practical joke — that
it was a lie.
"And then I noticed that my
clothes were soaking wet" from
the fire extinguisher.
But the scare — like earlier
ones — wasn't enough to prompt
Paul to seek help. Neither did the
disciplinary "slap on the wrist" he
got from his Ivy League universi
ty.
For years, Paul denied his
alcoholism — which began
when he took his first drink
at age 12 or 13. "I'm one of the
born alcoholics."
Tom, another graduate stu
dent in a professional school, said
he's the same way. "From the
time I took my first drink of
cheap wine. . . . Oh God. I never
had a healthy relationship with
alcohol."
Tom described his "love-hate
relationship" with the drug, but
later admitted, "I have a deep
hatred toward alcohol." The
ambiguity he feels is clear in the
way he says "alcohol," slowly and
clearly, as if he were defusing a
bomb.
Both Tom and Paul graduated
from Ivy League colleges. Tom
comes from a small, midwestern
town — "We were shit-poor farm
ers" — while Paul, the son of pro
fessionals, grew up in New York
City.
Their backgrounds were dif
ferent, but neither could control
what happened when he touched

alcohol. "Part of me says 'drink,'
"Tom said. "There's a craving."
Paul, who is fiercely articulate,
also lacks control over alcohol. "I
cannot drink safely. I don't have
two drinks. I don't drink a half a
drink and leave it on the table."
"Control was something a per
son in an elite college was expect
ed to have," Tom said. "If I was
the best and brightest, why
couldn't I control my drinking
problem?"
Paul's alcoholism began to
control him. He entered college as
a near straight-A student. But in
the fall of his junior year, when
his drinking and extracurricular
activities were at their peak, he
got two D's.
Drinking also interfered with
his social life. Although "he was
vivacious with friends and
women seemed to be attracted" to
him, "drinking got in the way."
"Alcohol helped me talk and
dance, but I was too drunk to deal
with it,"he said. "I would run
away from it, I felt so bad about
myself."
Paul said, "Alcohol is a key
part of the college experi
ence. For the mgyority of
people this is not a problem. They
can drink safely. But there are
those who cannot."
Since Stanford adopted a
tighter alcohol policy in October
1990, some marginally successful
attempts have been made to regu
late parties more closely. Typical
ly, fraternities hire security
guards or bartenders to regulate
consumption.
At a fraternity party Saturday
night, security guard Bubba Mal
oney checked Stanford identifica
tion and drivers' licenses of two
male international students
wearing stickers that read "BIG"
across their crotches.
Maloney marked their hands,
and the two signed a waiver that
said, "I do hereby declare that I
am 21 years of age or older and do
declare that I will asume (sic) all
responsibility for my actions. I
will not hold [the fraternity] or
their charter fraternaties
(sic)/sororities responsible for
any of my actions."
All party-goers, including
minors, were required to sign this
waiver. Maloney said his compa
ny would call the fraternity and
make sure they had a different
form for underage participants
next time.
Inside the fraternity house,
students bobbed and gyrated to
Salt 'n' Pepa's "Push it,"and
later, "YMCA," by the Village
People. In an adjoining room
crowded with sweating people
holding plastic Budweiser cups,
men shot pool while couples
drank and shouted over the noise.
A group of men gathered
around four kegs near the center
of the room. Several couples
played a beer-tasting game in
which the winning team would
recognize the cheapest and most
expensive beers, as well as brand
names.
No one appeared to be check
ing identification.
A half-dozen flushed men sat
at a table playing "quarters." The
object of quarters is to bounce a
quarter against a table and make
it land in a cup. Losers must
drink. One player reached back
periodically to pump pressure

into the keg.
"It's unusual for drinking
games to be going on during a
party," according to one fraterni
ty member who stood in a corner
by the soda machine. He said
party organizers bought smaller
cups and hired Maloney to cut
back on excessive drinking. "It's a
lot of money for bartenders," he
said, looking at the crowd sur
rounding the kegs.
Freshman Tim Yarnall, who
claimed he was 21, said he went
to parties "to have a good time
and dance." He said he wasn't
planning on drinking more than
the cup of beer he was holding.
Yarnall said, "I can get beer
whenever I want. I have friends

with ID. I have ID. At parties,
getting alcohol is easy."
Yarnall, a baseball player, said
he didn't know any alcoholics on
the team, although he "knew peo
ple in the dorm with problems."
He said a lack of self-esteem
drives people to alcohol. Ignoring
his friends' teasing, he leaned for
ward and said, "They don't feel
confident being themselves."
When Paul was in high
school, his nickname was
"Alcohol Paul." As an
undergraduate, he used to pro
vide alcohol to his friends using a
service he called, "alcoholics
unanimous." The name choice
was an omen, he said.
Alcohol had become part of his
persona — a sign, Paul said, that
he was an alcoholic.
Genes and environment are
contributing factors to the onset
of this disease that "doesn't dis
criminate," Paul said. He esti
mated that about 10 to 12 per
cent of the population is alco
holic. About two-thirds of its
victims are men.
"There's no cookie-cutter
behavior pattern" for alcoholics,
Paul said. "An alcoholic is some
one whose life gets better when
they stop drinking."
Just as there's no stereotypi
cal alcoholic, there are many
reasons why people drink exces
sively. Tom said it was difficult
to understand why rich kids
needed to drink. "They weren't
poor. I couldn't fathom it,"he
said.
Now, he recognizes alco
holism's multiple causes. "An
overriding factor is lack of spiri
tuality," he said. "Poor people
lost faith through work, rich
kids through success."
Spirituality, both Tom and
Paul said, is not necessarily
organized religion, but personal
contact with "higher powers"
that is an essential aspect of
Alcoholics Anonymous' 12-step
recovery program.
In Tom's rural hometown,
drinking was a way of life. "We
used to lose two kids a year to
drinking and driving. That's a
lot of the population."
Both Tom's grandfathers, his
father and an older brother were
alcoholics. His grandmother
killed his grandfather, then her
self, with a shotgun to put an
end to "the hallucinations of
pink elephants in the bathroom"
that alcohol caused.

At his Ivy League college,
there was "tremendous alco
holism with undergraduates.
They used to drink fancy wines.
They knew the good years."
Tom became a bartender
because "it was good money for a
poor kid."
Paul's upper middle-class fam
ily doesn't have the same history
with alcoholism.
He said he always felt "pres
sure to drink," though, and that
his father treated it "like a rite of
passage." The first time Paul
came home drunk, when he was
15, his father gave him a hang
over remedy, while his mother
told him that "gentlemen
shouldn't drink to get drunk."
For many alcoholics, includ
ing Tom and Paul, tragedy
helped them realize their
drinking was out of control.
Tom's fiancee died of cancer
during his senior year. "I took
care of her for six months," he
said. "Then she died."
Because he "didn't know how
to deal with dying," Tom went to
an Alcoholics Anonymous meet
ing but was turned off because
"everyone was smoking — it was
one addiction for another."
He thought he could control
his disease. "Rather than try to
live without alcohol, I wanted to
control it through willpower."
But when he got drunk overseas
doing graduate school field
work, he realized he had to do
something differently. Last fall,
he joined Alcoholics Anony
mous.
"I was finally making a step
toward accepting that I have a
disease. I am powerless to con
trol it. That's the way it is."
When Paul lost a family mem
ber, he did not stop drinking
immediately. But, he calls the
tragedy a "catalyst" for his
recovery.
Paul said certain "red flags"
indicated that he had a problem.
He craved booze, drank until he
blacked out and lost control of
himself when he was drunk. "I
was beginning not to be a nice
drunk anymore," he said.
He also paid close attention to
how much he drank and what
sort of liquor it was — such close
attention that he remembers
specific numbers and brands,
four years into sobriety.
Despite the abundance of
signs, Paul still didn't recognize
he had the disease.
English Prof. Ken Fields, who
is an alcoholic, called this oblivi
ousness typical.
"The amount I drank
increased until I was drinking a
great deal of alcohol and smok
ing a great deal of marijuana. I
smoked it every day," Fields
said. "I did not think I was an
addict."
He described his alcoholism as
a "roll-top desk, where pieces of
evidence were stashed in differ
ent drawers." He edited his
description: "There were roll-top
desks all around my house. The
pieces were everywhere. I
couldn't see the whole picture."
For Paul, the signs of his alco
holism would surface during
blackouts, when he would
express grief and anger at his
family member's death. He
turned to an alcoholic priest for
help. "I wanted him to tell me if
I was an alcoholic," he said.
After attending an AA meeting,
Paul cut back on his drinking.
"I got the best grades I got
that semester," he said.
But that summer, while trav
eling with friends, Paul began
drinking more ferociously than
ever. He started worrying that
alcohol might kill him. "I had
already experienced a death," he
said, "I wasn't interested in
being the next one."

His grief and low self-esteem
broke through frequently during
his blackouts, friends told him.
In August, he realized he wanted
to stop. It wasn't until that fall,
after drinking 17 glasses of beer
and the "lion's share of a bottle
of Maker's Mark bourbon" that
Paul turned to a friend who
didn't drink much and told him
"I want to stop."
The next day, each of his
friends "intervened" at the
advice of the school alcoholism
counselor, telling Paul he had a
problem with drinking. Paul
began meeting with the coun
selor, who gave him literature on
the disease and a list of ques
tions that were designed to
determine whether he had a
problem.
Paul began a self-prescribed
"moderation program," in which
he limited his drinks to five on
weekdays, eight on weekends.
He couldn't stick to it, though,
and set a date by which he would
go cold turkey.
Withdrawal was painful. "I
was sleepy, depressed," he said.
"I was not able to do the work I
needed to do."
Picking up a 12-step recovery
book was a turning point. "I was
not used to needing other people
to help me do things," he said.
Four months into sobriety, he
started going to AA meetings. "I
felt very humble. Here I was the
self-proclaimed star of every
thing "
For Tom, admitting his
alcoholism last fall meant
recognizing that drinking
caused a problem in his life, and
that he would always be an alco
holic. "I wanted to say I was an
alcoholic, not I am an alcoholic."
Denial was easier. For Paul,
"There were always people who
were 'worse' than I was. And I
would say, if I'm not as bad as
so-and-so, who tended to be
druggies, then I don't have a
problem."
Fields describes his own 20-
year denial period "a mechanism
by which the mind does not let
you take full measure of your
alcoholism."
"Your mind takes certain
turns to protect your addiction.
It makes it seem remarkable
that anyone could stop drink
ing," he said.
According to Fields, story
telling is a principle tool of
recovery. Fields tells a story like
Hemingway, with forceful,
meaty sentences punctuated by
thick pauses. He pauses over the
story of Daniel Lichstein, the
junior who committed suicide
last November.
"His suicide note [that said 'I
am an alcoholic. I could not
withdraw'] was the first step to
admitting he was powerless —
that his life was unmanageable.
It's too bad he did it all by him
self.
"To break through denial
before you have any means of
recovery is horrifying. You
either go back to drinking or you
have to die," he said.
Alcoholics Anonymous' 12-
step recovery program has pro
vided Tom with this means.
Tom calls recovery a "concept of
sobriety that has nothing to do
with whether I'm drinking. I'm
completely honest. I accept
responsibility for everything I
do. It's where I try every
moment of the day to follow a
higher power and spiritual path
rather than the material."
"Stanford's culture. . . is
highly materialistic, no matter
how 'wacky' people act. There's
a high premium on how you look
whether you're wearing ratty
clothes to make a political state
ment, or three-piece suits," he
said.

would say, if I'm not as bad as
so-and-so, who tended to be
druggies, then I don't have a
problem."
Fields describes his own 20-
year denial period "a mechanism
by which the mind does not let
you take full measure of your
alcoholism."
"Your mind takes certain
turns to protect your addiction.
It makes it seem remarkable
that anyone could stop drink
ing," he said.
According to Fields, story
telling is a principle tool of
recovery. Fields tells a story like
Hemingway, with forceful,
meaty sentences punctuated by
thick pauses. He pauses over the
story of Daniel Lichstein, the
junior who committed suicide
last November.
"His suicide note [that said 'I
am an alcoholic. I could not
withdraw'] was the first step to
admitting he was powerless —
that his life was unmanageable.
It's too bad he did it all by him
self.
"To break through denial
before you have any means of
recovery is horrifying. You
either go back to drinking or you
have to die," he said.
Alcoholics Anonymous' 12-
step recovery program has pro
vided Tom with this means.
Tom calls recovery a "concept of
sobriety that has nothing to do
with whether I'm drinking. I'm
completely honest. I accept
responsibility for everything I
do. It's where I try every
moment of the day to follow a
higher power and spiritual path
rather than the material."
"Stanford's culture. . . is
highly materialistic, no matter
how 'wacky' people act. There's
a high premium on how you look
whether you're wearing ratty
clothes to make a political state
ment, or three-piece suits," he
said.

Downing 36 beers in a single
evening wasn't anything
unusual for Paul, a gradu
ate student in one of Stanford's
professional schools.
Neither were "blackouts" —
periods of time when Paul was so
drunk he didn't know what he
was doing, and didn't remember
anything when he woke up the
next afternoon. Paul would bond
with his drinking buddies the
next day by swapping stories
about the things each other had
done.
"They were usually stupid
things," Paul said, "like a friend
standing on a table, tearing off
his clothes and streaking."
One experience shocked him
into thinking he might have a
problem with alcohol.
After a night of drinking
games, Paul went back to the
well-stocked bar in his room and
knocked back two shots of scotch.
He remembers "talking to a knot
of friends in the hall," and then
stumbling around in the bath
room while getting ready for bed.
"What I would learn," Paul
said, "is that I grabbed the near
est fire extinguisher and started
hosing this guy down."
Paul said he chased his quarry
around the dorm and outside,
where the campus police joined
suit. He escaped "after doing
some acrobatic feats," but his
friend got caught and gave Paul's
name to the police.
"I remember waking up the
next morning, afternoon — what
ever it was — and hearing my
roommate talking on the phone
about it. I thought he was setting
me up for a practical joke — that
it was a lie.
"And then I noticed that my
clothes were soaking wet" from
the fire extinguisher.
But the scare — like earlier
ones — wasn't enough to prompt
Paul to seek help. Neither did the
disciplinary "slap on the wrist" he
got from his Ivy League universi
ty.
For years, Paul denied his
alcoholism — which began
when he took his first drink
at age 12 or 13. "I'm one of the
born alcoholics."
Tom, another graduate stu
dent in a professional school, said
he's the same way. "From the
time I took my first drink of
cheap wine. . . . Oh God. I never
had a healthy relationship with
alcohol."
Tom described his "love-hate
relationship" with the drug, but
later admitted, "I have a deep
hatred toward alcohol." The
ambiguity he feels is clear in the
way he says "alcohol," slowly and
clearly, as if he were defusing a
bomb.
Both Tom and Paul graduated
from Ivy League colleges. Tom
comes from a small, midwestern
town — "We were shit-poor farm
ers" — while Paul, the son of pro
fessionals, grew up in New York
City.
Their backgrounds were dif
ferent, but neither could control
what happened when he touched

alcohol. "Part of me says 'drink,'
"Tom said. "There's a craving."
Paul, who is fiercely articulate,
also lacks control over alcohol. "I
cannot drink safely. I don't have
two drinks. I don't drink a half a
drink and leave it on the table."
"Control was something a per
son in an elite college was expect
ed to have," Tom said. "If I was
the best and brightest, why
couldn't I control my drinking
problem?"
Paul's alcoholism began to
control him. He entered college as
a near straight-A student. But in
the fall of his junior year, when
his drinking and extracurricular
activities were at their peak, he
got two D's.
Drinking also interfered with
his social life. Although "he was
vivacious with friends and
women seemed to be attracted" to
him, "drinking got in the way."
"Alcohol helped me talk and
dance, but I was too drunk to deal
with it,"he said. "I would run
away from it, I felt so bad about
myself."
Paul said, "Alcohol is a key
part of the college experi
ence. For the mgyority of
people this is not a problem. They
can drink safely. But there are
those who cannot."
Since Stanford adopted a
tighter alcohol policy in October
1990, some marginally successful
attempts have been made to regu
late parties more closely. Typical
ly, fraternities hire security
guards or bartenders to regulate
consumption.
At a fraternity party Saturday
night, security guard Bubba Mal
oney checked Stanford identifica
tion and drivers' licenses of two
male international students
wearing stickers that read "BIG"
across their crotches.
Maloney marked their hands,
and the two signed a waiver that
said, "I do hereby declare that I
am 21 years of age or older and do
declare that I will asume (sic) all
responsibility for my actions. I
will not hold [the fraternity] or
their charter fraternaties
(sic)/sororities responsible for
any of my actions."
All party-goers, including
minors, were required to sign this
waiver. Maloney said his compa
ny would call the fraternity and
make sure they had a different
form for underage participants
next time.
Inside the fraternity house,
students bobbed and gyrated to
Salt 'n' Pepa's "Push it,"and
later, "YMCA," by the Village
People. In an adjoining room
crowded with sweating people
holding plastic Budweiser cups,
men shot pool while couples
drank and shouted over the noise.
A group of men gathered
around four kegs near the center
of the room. Several couples
played a beer-tasting game in
which the winning team would
recognize the cheapest and most
expensive beers, as well as brand
names.
No one appeared to be check
ing identification.
A half-dozen flushed men sat
at a table playing "quarters." The
object of quarters is to bounce a
quarter against a table and make
it land in a cup. Losers must
drink. One player reached back
periodically to pump pressure

into the keg.
"It's unusual for drinking
games to be going on during a
party," according to one fraterni
ty member who stood in a corner
by the soda machine. He said
party organizers bought smaller
cups and hired Maloney to cut
back on excessive drinking. "It's a
lot of money for bartenders," he
said, looking at the crowd sur
rounding the kegs.
Freshman Tim Yarnall, who
claimed he was 21, said he went
to parties "to have a good time
and dance." He said he wasn't
planning on drinking more than
the cup of beer he was holding.
Yarnall said, "I can get beer
whenever I want. I have friends

with ID. I have ID. At parties,
getting alcohol is easy."
Yarnall, a baseball player, said
he didn't know any alcoholics on
the team, although he "knew peo
ple in the dorm with problems."
He said a lack of self-esteem
drives people to alcohol. Ignoring
his friends' teasing, he leaned for
ward and said, "They don't feel
confident being themselves."
When Paul was in high
school, his nickname was
"Alcohol Paul." As an
undergraduate, he used to pro
vide alcohol to his friends using a
service he called, "alcoholics
unanimous." The name choice
was an omen, he said.
Alcohol had become part of his
persona — a sign, Paul said, that
he was an alcoholic.
Genes and environment are
contributing factors to the onset
of this disease that "doesn't dis
criminate," Paul said. He esti
mated that about 10 to 12 per
cent of the population is alco
holic. About two-thirds of its
victims are men.
"There's no cookie-cutter
behavior pattern" for alcoholics,
Paul said. "An alcoholic is some
one whose life gets better when
they stop drinking."
Just as there's no stereotypi
cal alcoholic, there are many
reasons why people drink exces
sively. Tom said it was difficult
to understand why rich kids
needed to drink. "They weren't
poor. I couldn't fathom it,"he
said.
Now, he recognizes alco
holism's multiple causes. "An
overriding factor is lack of spiri
tuality," he said. "Poor people
lost faith through work, rich
kids through success."
Spirituality, both Tom and
Paul said, is not necessarily
organized religion, but personal
contact with "higher powers"
that is an essential aspect of
Alcoholics Anonymous' 12-step
recovery program.
In Tom's rural hometown,
drinking was a way of life. "We
used to lose two kids a year to
drinking and driving. That's a
lot of the population."
Both Tom's grandfathers, his
father and an older brother were
alcoholics. His grandmother
killed his grandfather, then her
self, with a shotgun to put an
end to "the hallucinations of
pink elephants in the bathroom"
that alcohol caused.

At his Ivy League college,
there was "tremendous alco
holism with undergraduates.
They used to drink fancy wines.
They knew the good years."
Tom became a bartender
because "it was good money for a
poor kid."
Paul's upper middle-class fam
ily doesn't have the same history
with alcoholism.
He said he always felt "pres
sure to drink," though, and that
his father treated it "like a rite of
passage." The first time Paul
came home drunk, when he was
15, his father gave him a hang
over remedy, while his mother
told him that "gentlemen
shouldn't drink to get drunk."
For many alcoholics, includ
ing Tom and Paul, tragedy
helped them realize their
drinking was out of control.
Tom's fiancee died of cancer
during his senior year. "I took
care of her for six months," he
said. "Then she died."
Because he "didn't know how
to deal with dying," Tom went to
an Alcoholics Anonymous meet
ing but was turned off because
"everyone was smoking — it was
one addiction for another."
He thought he could control
his disease. "Rather than try to
live without alcohol, I wanted to
control it through willpower."
But when he got drunk overseas
doing graduate school field
work, he realized he had to do
something differently. Last fall,
he joined Alcoholics Anony
mous.
"I was finally making a step
toward accepting that I have a
disease. I am powerless to con
trol it. That's the way it is."
When Paul lost a family mem
ber, he did not stop drinking
immediately. But, he calls the
tragedy a "catalyst" for his
recovery.
Paul said certain "red flags"
indicated that he had a problem.
He craved booze, drank until he
blacked out and lost control of
himself when he was drunk. "I
was beginning not to be a nice
drunk anymore," he said.
He also paid close attention to
how much he drank and what
sort of liquor it was — such close
attention that he remembers
specific numbers and brands,
four years into sobriety.
Despite the abundance of
signs, Paul still didn't recognize
he had the disease.
English Prof. Ken Fields, who
is an alcoholic, called this oblivi
ousness typical.
"The amount I drank
increased until I was drinking a
great deal of alcohol and smok
ing a great deal of marijuana. I
smoked it every day," Fields
said. "I did not think I was an
addict."
He described his alcoholism as
a "roll-top desk, where pieces of
evidence were stashed in differ
ent drawers." He edited his
description: "There were roll-top
desks all around my house. The
pieces were everywhere. I
couldn't see the whole picture."
For Paul, the signs of his alco
holism would surface during
blackouts, when he would
express grief and anger at his
family member's death. He
turned to an alcoholic priest for
help. "I wanted him to tell me if
I was an alcoholic," he said.
After attending an AA meeting,
Paul cut back on his drinking.
"I got the best grades I got
that semester," he said.
But that summer, while trav
eling with friends, Paul began
drinking more ferociously than
ever. He started worrying that
alcohol might kill him. "I had
already experienced a death," he
said, "I wasn't interested in
being the next one."

His grief and low self-esteem
broke through frequently during
his blackouts, friends told him.
In August, he realized he wanted
to stop. It wasn't until that fall,
after drinking 17 glasses of beer
and the "lion's share of a bottle
of Maker's Mark bourbon" that
Paul turned to a friend who
didn't drink much and told him
"I want to stop."
The next day, each of his
friends "intervened" at the
advice of the school alcoholism
counselor, telling Paul he had a
problem with drinking. Paul
began meeting with the coun
selor, who gave him literature on
the disease and a list of ques
tions that were designed to
determine whether he had a
problem.
Paul began a self-prescribed
"moderation program," in which
he limited his drinks to five on
weekdays, eight on weekends.
He couldn't stick to it, though,
and set a date by which he would
go cold turkey.
Withdrawal was painful. "I
was sleepy, depressed," he said.
"I was not able to do the work I
needed to do."
Picking up a 12-step recovery
book was a turning point. "I was
not used to needing other people
to help me do things," he said.
Four months into sobriety, he
started going to AA meetings. "I
felt very humble. Here I was the
self-proclaimed star of every
thing "
For Tom, admitting his
alcoholism last fall meant
recognizing that drinking
caused a problem in his life, and
that he would always be an alco
holic. "I wanted to say I was an
alcoholic, not I am an alcoholic."
Denial was easier. For Paul,
"There were always people who
were 'worse' than I was. And I
would say, if I'm not as bad as
so-and-so, who tended to be
druggies, then I don't have a
problem."
Fields describes his own 20-
year denial period "a mechanism
by which the mind does not let
you take full measure of your
alcoholism."
"Your mind takes certain
turns to protect your addiction.
It makes it seem remarkable
that anyone could stop drink
ing," he said.
According to Fields, story
telling is a principle tool of
recovery. Fields tells a story like
Hemingway, with forceful,
meaty sentences punctuated by
thick pauses. He pauses over the
story of Daniel Lichstein, the
junior who committed suicide
last November.
"His suicide note [that said 'I
am an alcoholic. I could not
withdraw'] was the first step to
admitting he was powerless —
that his life was unmanageable.
It's too bad he did it all by him
self.
"To break through denial

rather than the material."
"Stanford's culture. . . is
highly materialistic, no matter
how 'wacky' people act. There's
a high premium on how you look
whether you're wearing ratty
clothes to make a political state
ment, or three-piece suits," he
said.

holism would surface during
blackouts, when he would
express grief and anger at his
family member's death. He
turned to an alcoholic priest for
help. "I wanted him to tell me if
I was an alcoholic," he said.
After attending an AA meeting,
Paul cut back on his drinking.
"I got the best grades I got
that semester," he said.
But that summer, while trav
eling with friends, Paul began
drinking more ferociously than
ever. He started worrying that
alcohol might kill him. "I had
already experienced a death," he
said, "I wasn't interested in
being the next one."

His grief and low self-esteem
broke through frequently during
his blackouts, friends told him.
In August, he realized he wanted
to stop. It wasn't until that fall,
after drinking 17 glasses of beer
and the "lion's share of a bottle
of Maker's Mark bourbon" that
Paul turned to a friend who
didn't drink much and told him
"I want to stop."
The next day, each of his
friends "intervened" at the
advice of the school alcoholism
counselor, telling Paul he had a
problem with drinking. Paul
began meeting with the coun
selor, who gave him literature on
the disease and a list of ques
tions that were designed to
determine whether he had a
problem.
Paul began a self-prescribed
"moderation program," in which
he limited his drinks to five on
weekdays, eight on weekends.
He couldn't stick to it, though,
and set a date by which he would
go cold turkey.
Withdrawal was painful. "I
was sleepy, depressed," he said.
"I was not able to do the work I
needed to do."
Picking up a 12-step recovery
book was a turning point. "I was
not used to needing other people
to help me do things," he said.
Four months into sobriety, he
started going to AA meetings. "I
felt very humble. Here I was the
self-proclaimed star of every
thing "
For Tom, admitting his
alcoholism last fall meant
recognizing that drinking
caused a problem in his life, and
that he would always be an alco
holic. "I wanted to say I was an
alcoholic, not I am an alcoholic."
Denial was easier. For Paul,
"There were always people who
were 'worse' than I was. And I
would say, if I'm not as bad as
so-and-so, who tended to be
druggies, then I don't have a
problem."
Fields describes his own 20-
year denial period "a mechanism
by which the mind does not let
you take full measure of your
alcoholism."
"Your mind takes certain
turns to protect your addiction.
It makes it seem remarkable
that anyone could stop drink
ing," he said.
According to Fields, story
telling is a principle tool of
recovery. Fields tells a story like
Hemingway, with forceful,
meaty sentences punctuated by
thick pauses. He pauses over the
story of Daniel Lichstein, the
junior who committed suicide
last November.
"His suicide note [that said 'I
am an alcoholic. I could not
withdraw'] was the first step to
admitting he was powerless —
that his life was unmanageable.
It's too bad he did it all by him
self.
"To break through denial
before you have any means of
recovery is horrifying. You
either go back to drinking or you
have to die," he said.
Alcoholics Anonymous' 12-
step recovery program has pro
vided Tom with this means.
Tom calls recovery a "concept of
sobriety that has nothing to do
with whether I'm drinking. I'm
completely honest. I accept
responsibility for everything I
do. It's where I try every
moment of the day to follow a
higher power and spiritual path
rather than the material."
"Stanford's culture. . . is
highly materialistic, no matter
how 'wacky' people act. There's
a high premium on how you look
whether you're wearing ratty
clothes to make a political state
ment, or three-piece suits," he
said.

Downing 36 beers in a single
evening wasn't anything
unusual for Paul, a gradu
ate student in one of Stanford's
professional schools.
Neither were "blackouts" —
periods of time when Paul was so
drunk he didn't know what he
was doing, and didn't remember
anything when he woke up the
next afternoon. Paul would bond
with his drinking buddies the
next day by swapping stories
about the things each other had
done.
"They were usually stupid
things," Paul said, "like a friend
standing on a table, tearing off
his clothes and streaking."
One experience shocked him
into thinking he might have a
problem with alcohol.
After a night of drinking
games, Paul went back to the
well-stocked bar in his room and
knocked back two shots of scotch.
He remembers "talking to a knot
of friends in the hall," and then
stumbling around in the bath
room while getting ready for bed.
"What I would learn," Paul
said, "is that I grabbed the near
est fire extinguisher and started
hosing this guy down."
Paul said he chased his quarry
around the dorm and outside,
where the campus police joined
suit. He escaped "after doing
some acrobatic feats," but his
friend got caught and gave Paul's
name to the police.
"I remember waking up the
next morning, afternoon — what
ever it was — and hearing my
roommate talking on the phone
about it. I thought he was setting
me up for a practical joke — that
it was a lie.
"And then I noticed that my
clothes were soaking wet" from
the fire extinguisher.
But the scare — like earlier
ones — wasn't enough to prompt
Paul to seek help. Neither did the
disciplinary "slap on the wrist" he
got from his Ivy League universi
ty.
For years, Paul denied his
alcoholism — which began
when he took his first drink
at age 12 or 13. "I'm one of the
born alcoholics."
Tom, another graduate stu
dent in a professional school, said
he's the same way. "From the
time I took my first drink of
cheap wine. . . . Oh God. I never
had a healthy relationship with
alcohol."
Tom described his "love-hate
relationship" with the drug, but
later admitted, "I have a deep
hatred toward alcohol." The
ambiguity he feels is clear in the
way he says "alcohol," slowly and
clearly, as if he were defusing a
bomb.
Both Tom and Paul graduated
from Ivy League colleges. Tom
comes from a small, midwestern
town — "We were shit-poor farm
ers" — while Paul, the son of pro
fessionals, grew up in New York
City.
Their backgrounds were dif
ferent, but neither could control
what happened when he touched

alcohol. "Part of me says 'drink,'
"Tom said. "There's a craving."
Paul, who is fiercely articulate,
also lacks control over alcohol. "I
cannot drink safely. I don't have
two drinks. I don't drink a half a
drink and leave it on the table."
"Control was something a per
son in an elite college was expect
ed to have," Tom said. "If I was
the best and brightest, why
couldn't I control my drinking
problem?"
Paul's alcoholism began to
control him. He entered college as
a near straight-A student. But in
the fall of his junior year, when
his drinking and extracurricular
activities were at their peak, he
got two D's.
Drinking also interfered with
his social life. Although "he was
vivacious with friends and
women seemed to be attracted" to
him, "drinking got in the way."
"Alcohol helped me talk and
dance, but I was too drunk to deal
with it,"he said. "I would run
away from it, I felt so bad about
myself."
Paul said, "Alcohol is a key
part of the college experi
ence. For the mgyority of
people this is not a problem. They
can drink safely. But there are
those who cannot."
Since Stanford adopted a
tighter alcohol policy in October
1990, some marginally successful
attempts have been made to regu
late parties more closely. Typical
ly, fraternities hire security
guards or bartenders to regulate
consumption.
At a fraternity party Saturday
night, security guard Bubba Mal
oney checked Stanford identifica
tion and drivers' licenses of two
male international students
wearing stickers that read "BIG"
across their crotches.
Maloney marked their hands,
and the two signed a waiver that
said, "I do hereby declare that I
am 21 years of age or older and do
declare that I will asume (sic) all
responsibility for my actions. I
will not hold [the fraternity] or
their charter fraternaties
(sic)/sororities responsible for
any of my actions."
All party-goers, including
minors, were required to sign this
waiver. Maloney said his compa
ny would call the fraternity and
make sure they had a different
form for underage participants
next time.
Inside the fraternity house,
students bobbed and gyrated to
Salt 'n' Pepa's "Push it,"and
later, "YMCA," by the Village
People. In an adjoining room
crowded with sweating people
holding plastic Budweiser cups,
men shot pool while couples
drank and shouted over the noise.
A group of men gathered
around four kegs near the center
of the room. Several couples
played a beer-tasting game in
which the winning team would
recognize the cheapest and most
expensive beers, as well as brand
names.
No one appeared to be check
ing identification.
A half-dozen flushed men sat
at a table playing "quarters." The
object of quarters is to bounce a
quarter against a table and make
it land in a cup. Losers must
drink. One player reached back
periodically to pump pressure

into the keg.
"It's unusual for drinking
games to be going on during a
party," according to one fraterni
ty member who stood in a corner
by the soda machine. He said
party organizers bought smaller
cups and hired Maloney to cut
back on excessive drinking. "It's a
lot of money for bartenders," he
said, looking at the crowd sur
rounding the kegs.
Freshman Tim Yarnall, who
claimed he was 21, said he went
to parties "to have a good time
and dance." He said he wasn't
planning on drinking more than
the cup of beer he was holding.
Yarnall said, "I can get beer
whenever I want. I have friends

with ID. I have ID. At parties,
getting alcohol is easy."
Yarnall, a baseball player, said
he didn't know any alcoholics on
the team, although he "knew peo
ple in the dorm with problems."
He said a lack of self-esteem
drives people to alcohol. Ignoring
his friends' teasing, he leaned for
ward and said, "They don't feel
confident being themselves."
When Paul was in high
school, his nickname was
"Alcohol Paul." As an
undergraduate, he used to pro
vide alcohol to his friends using a
service he called, "alcoholics
unanimous." The name choice
was an omen, he said.
Alcohol had become part of his
persona — a sign, Paul said, that
he was an alcoholic.
Genes and environment are
contributing factors to the onset
of this disease that "doesn't dis
criminate," Paul said. He esti
mated that about 10 to 12 per
cent of the population is alco
holic. About two-thirds of its
victims are men.
"There's no cookie-cutter
behavior pattern" for alcoholics,
Paul said. "An alcoholic is some
one whose life gets better when
they stop drinking."
Just as there's no stereotypi
cal alcoholic, there are many
reasons why people drink exces
sively. Tom said it was difficult
to understand why rich kids
needed to drink. "They weren't
poor. I couldn't fathom it,"he
said.
Now, he recognizes alco
holism's multiple causes. "An
overriding factor is lack of spiri
tuality," he said. "Poor people
lost faith through work, rich
kids through success."
Spirituality, both Tom and
Paul said, is not necessarily
organized religion, but personal
contact with "higher powers"
that is an essential aspect of
Alcoholics Anonymous' 12-step
recovery program.
In Tom's rural hometown,
drinking was a way of life. "We
used to lose two kids a year to
drinking and driving. That's a
lot of the population."
Both Tom's grandfathers, his
father and an older brother were
alcoholics. His grandmother
killed his grandfather, then her
self, with a shotgun to put an
end to "the hallucinations of
pink elephants in the bathroom"
that alcohol caused.

At his Ivy League college,
there was "tremendous alco
holism with undergraduates.
They used to drink fancy wines.
They knew the good years."
Tom became a bartender
because "it was good money for a
poor kid."
Paul's upper middle-class fam
ily doesn't have the same history
with alcoholism.
He said he always felt "pres
sure to drink," though, and that
his father treated it "like a rite of
passage." The first time Paul
came home drunk, when he was
15, his father gave him a hang
over remedy, while his mother
told him that "gentlemen
shouldn't drink to get drunk."
For many alcoholics, includ
ing Tom and Paul, tragedy
helped them realize their
drinking was out of control.
Tom's fiancee died of cancer
during his senior year. "I took
care of her for six months," he
said. "Then she died."
Because he "didn't know how
to deal with dying," Tom went to
an Alcoholics Anonymous meet
ing but was turned off because
"everyone was smoking — it was
one addiction for another."
He thought he could control
his disease. "Rather than try to
live without alcohol, I wanted to
control it through willpower."
But when he got drunk overseas
doing graduate school field
work, he realized he had to do
something differently. Last fall,
he joined Alcoholics Anony
mous.
"I was finally making a step
toward accepting that I have a
disease. I am powerless to con
trol it. That's the way it is."
When Paul lost a family mem
ber, he did not stop drinking
immediately. But, he calls the
tragedy a "catalyst" for his
recovery.
Paul said certain "red flags"
indicated that he had a problem.
He craved booze, drank until he
blacked out and lost control of
himself when he was drunk. "I
was beginning not to be a nice
drunk anymore," he said.
He also paid close attention to
how much he drank and what
sort of liquor it was — such close
attention that he remembers
specific numbers and brands,
four years into sobriety.
Despite the abundance of
signs, Paul still didn't recognize
he had the disease.
English Prof. Ken Fields, who
is an alcoholic, called this oblivi
ousness typical.
"The amount I drank
increased until I was drinking a
great deal of alcohol and smok
ing a great deal of marijuana. I
smoked it every day," Fields
said. "I did not think I was an
addict."
He described his alcoholism as
a "roll-top desk, where pieces of
evidence were stashed in differ
ent drawers." He edited his
description: "There were roll-top
desks all around my house. The
pieces were everywhere. I
couldn't see the whole picture."
For Paul, the signs of his alco
holism would surface during
blackouts, when he would
express grief and anger at his
family member's death. He
turned to an alcoholic priest for
help. "I wanted him to tell me if
I was an alcoholic," he said.
After attending an AA meeting,
Paul cut back on his drinking.
"I got the best grades I got
that semester," he said.
But that summer, while trav
eling with friends, Paul began
drinking more ferociously than
ever. He started worrying that
alcohol might kill him. "I had
already experienced a death," he
said, "I wasn't interested in
being the next one."

broke through frequently during

passage." The first time Paul
came home drunk, when he was
15, his father gave him a hang
over remedy, while his mother
told him that "gentlemen
shouldn't drink to get drunk."
For many alcoholics, includ
ing Tom and Paul, tragedy
helped them realize their
drinking was out of control.
Tom's fiancee died of cancer
during his senior year. "I took
care of her for six months," he
said. "Then she died."
Because he "didn't know how
to deal with dying," Tom went to
an Alcoholics Anonymous meet
ing but was turned off because
"everyone was smoking — it was
one addiction for another."
He thought he could control
his disease. "Rather than try to
live without alcohol, I wanted to
control it through willpower."
But when he got drunk overseas
doing graduate school field
work, he realized he had to do
something differently. Last fall,
he joined Alcoholics Anony
mous.
"I was finally making a step
toward accepting that I have a
disease. I am powerless to con
trol it. That's the way it is."
When Paul lost a family mem
ber, he did not stop drinking
immediately. But, he calls the
tragedy a "catalyst" for his
recovery.
Paul said certain "red flags"
indicated that he had a problem.
He craved booze, drank until he
blacked out and lost control of
himself when he was drunk. "I
was beginning not to be a nice
drunk anymore," he said.
He also paid close attention to
how much he drank and what
sort of liquor it was — such close
attention that he remembers
specific numbers and brands,
four years into sobriety.
Despite the abundance of
signs, Paul still didn't recognize
he had the disease.
English Prof. Ken Fields, who
is an alcoholic, called this oblivi
ousness typical.
"The amount I drank
increased until I was drinking a
great deal of alcohol and smok
ing a great deal of marijuana. I
smoked it every day," Fields
said. "I did not think I was an
addict."
He described his alcoholism as
a "roll-top desk, where pieces of
evidence were stashed in differ
ent drawers." He edited his
description: "There were roll-top
desks all around my house. The
pieces were everywhere. I
couldn't see the whole picture."
For Paul, the signs of his alco
holism would surface during
blackouts, when he would
express grief and anger at his
family member's death. He
turned to an alcoholic priest for
help. "I wanted him to tell me if
I was an alcoholic," he said.
After attending an AA meeting,
Paul cut back on his drinking.
"I got the best grades I got
that semester," he said.
But that summer, while trav
eling with friends, Paul began
drinking more ferociously than
ever. He started worrying that
alcohol might kill him. "I had
already experienced a death," he
said, "I wasn't interested in
being the next one."

His grief and low self-esteem
broke through frequently during
his blackouts, friends told him.
In August, he realized he wanted
to stop. It wasn't until that fall,
after drinking 17 glasses of beer
and the "lion's share of a bottle
of Maker's Mark bourbon" that
Paul turned to a friend who
didn't drink much and told him
"I want to stop."
The next day, each of his
friends "intervened" at the
advice of the school alcoholism
counselor, telling Paul he had a
problem with drinking. Paul
began meeting with the coun
selor, who gave him literature on
the disease and a list of ques
tions that were designed to
determine whether he had a
problem.
Paul began a self-prescribed
"moderation program," in which
he limited his drinks to five on
weekdays, eight on weekends.
He couldn't stick to it, though,
and set a date by which he would
go cold turkey.
Withdrawal was painful. "I
was sleepy, depressed," he said.
"I was not able to do the work I
needed to do."
Picking up a 12-step recovery
book was a turning point. "I was
not used to needing other people
to help me do things," he said.
Four months into sobriety, he
started going to AA meetings. "I
felt very humble. Here I was the
self-proclaimed star of every
thing "
For Tom, admitting his
alcoholism last fall meant
recognizing that drinking
caused a problem in his life, and
that he would always be an alco
holic. "I wanted to say I was an
alcoholic, not I am an alcoholic."
Denial was easier. For Paul,
"There were always people who
were 'worse' than I was. And I
would say, if I'm not as bad as
so-and-so, who tended to be
druggies, then I don't have a
problem."
Fields describes his own 20-
year denial period "a mechanism
by which the mind does not let
you take full measure of your
alcoholism."
"Your mind takes certain
turns to protect your addiction.
It makes it seem remarkable
that anyone could stop drink
ing," he said.
According to Fields, story
telling is a principle tool of
recovery. Fields tells a story like
Hemingway, with forceful,
meaty sentences punctuated by
thick pauses. He pauses over the
story of Daniel Lichstein, the
junior who committed suicide
last November.
"His suicide note [that said 'I
am an alcoholic. I could not
withdraw'] was the first step to
admitting he was powerless —
that his life was unmanageable.
It's too bad he did it all by him
self.
"To break through denial
before you have any means of
recovery is horrifying. You
either go back to drinking or you
have to die," he said.
Alcoholics Anonymous' 12-
step recovery program has pro
vided Tom with this means.
Tom calls recovery a "concept of
sobriety that has nothing to do
with whether I'm drinking. I'm
completely honest. I accept
responsibility for everything I
do. It's where I try every
moment of the day to follow a
higher power and spiritual path
rather than the material."
"Stanford's culture. . . is
highly materialistic, no matter
how 'wacky' people act. There's
a high premium on how you look
whether you're wearing ratty
clothes to make a political state
ment, or three-piece suits," he
said.

Downing 36 beers in a single
evening wasn't anything
unusual for Paul, a gradu
ate student in one of Stanford's
professional schools.
Neither were "blackouts" —
periods of time when Paul was so
drunk he didn't know what he
was doing, and didn't remember
anything when he woke up the
next afternoon. Paul would bond
with his drinking buddies the
next day by swapping stories
about the things each other had
done.
"They were usually stupid
things," Paul said, "like a friend
standing on a table, tearing off
his clothes and streaking."
One experience shocked him
into thinking he might have a
problem with alcohol.
After a night of drinking
games, Paul went back to the
well-stocked bar in his room and
knocked back two shots of scotch.
He remembers "talking to a knot
of friends in the hall," and then
stumbling around in the bath
room while getting ready for bed.
"What I would learn," Paul
said, "is that I grabbed the near
est fire extinguisher and started
hosing this guy down."
Paul said he chased his quarry
around the dorm and outside,
where the campus police joined
suit. He escaped "after doing
some acrobatic feats," but his
friend got caught and gave Paul's
name to the police.
"I remember waking up the
next morning, afternoon — what
ever it was — and hearing my
roommate talking on the phone
about it. I thought he was setting
me up for a practical joke — that
it was a lie.
"And then I noticed that my
clothes were soaking wet" from
the fire extinguisher.
But the scare — like earlier
ones — wasn't enough to prompt
Paul to seek help. Neither did the
disciplinary "slap on the wrist" he
got from his Ivy League universi
ty.
For years, Paul denied his
alcoholism — which began
when he took his first drink
at age 12 or 13. "I'm one of the
born alcoholics."
Tom, another graduate stu
dent in a professional school, said
he's the same way. "From the
time I took my first drink of
cheap wine. . . . Oh God. I never
had a healthy relationship with
alcohol."
Tom described his "love-hate
relationship" with the drug, but
later admitted, "I have a deep
hatred toward alcohol." The
ambiguity he feels is clear in the
way he says "alcohol," slowly and
clearly, as if he were defusing a
bomb.
Both Tom and Paul graduated
from Ivy League colleges. Tom
comes from a small, midwestern
town — "We were shit-poor farm
ers" — while Paul, the son of pro
fessionals, grew up in New York
City.
Their backgrounds were dif
ferent, but neither could control
what happened when he touched

alcohol. "Part of me says 'drink,'
"Tom said. "There's a craving."
Paul, who is fiercely articulate,
also lacks control over alcohol. "I
cannot drink safely. I don't have
two drinks. I don't drink a half a
drink and leave it on the table."
"Control was something a per
son in an elite college was expect
ed to have," Tom said. "If I was
the best and brightest, why
couldn't I control my drinking
problem?"
Paul's alcoholism began to
control him. He entered college as
a near straight-A student. But in
the fall of his junior year, when
his drinking and extracurricular
activities were at their peak, he
got two D's.
Drinking also interfered with
his social life. Although "he was
vivacious with friends and
women seemed to be attracted" to
him, "drinking got in the way."
"Alcohol helped me talk and
dance, but I was too drunk to deal
with it,"he said. "I would run
away from it, I felt so bad about
myself."
Paul said, "Alcohol is a key
part of the college experi
ence. For the mgyority of
people this is not a problem. They
can drink safely. But there are
those who cannot."
Since Stanford adopted a
tighter alcohol policy in October
1990, some marginally successful
attempts have been made to regu
late parties more closely. Typical
ly, fraternities hire security
guards or bartenders to regulate
consumption.
At a fraternity party Saturday
night, security guard Bubba Mal
oney checked Stanford identifica
tion and drivers' licenses of two
male international students
wearing stickers that read "BIG"
across their crotches.
Maloney marked their hands,
and the two signed a waiver that
said, "I do hereby declare that I
am 21 years of age or older and do
declare that I will asume (sic) all
responsibility for my actions. I
will not hold [the fraternity] or
their charter fraternaties
(sic)/sororities responsible for
any of my actions."
All party-goers, including
minors, were required to sign this
waiver. Maloney said his compa
ny would call the fraternity and
make sure they had a different
form for underage participants
next time.
Inside the fraternity house,
students bobbed and gyrated to
Salt 'n' Pepa's "Push it,"and
later, "YMCA," by the Village
People. In an adjoining room
crowded with sweating people
holding plastic Budweiser cups,
men shot pool while couples
drank and shouted over the noise.
A group of men gathered
around four kegs near the center
of the room. Several couples
played a beer-tasting game in
which the winning team would
recognize the cheapest and most
expensive beers, as well as brand
names.
No one appeared to be check
ing identification.
A half-dozen flushed men sat
at a table playing "quarters." The
object of quarters is to bounce a
quarter against a table and make
it land in a cup. Losers must
drink. One player reached back
periodically to pump pressure

into the keg.
"It's unusual for drinking
games to be going on during a
party," according to one fraterni
ty member who stood in a corner
by the soda machine. He said
party organizers bought smaller
cups and hired Maloney to cut
back on excessive drinking. "It's a
lot of money for bartenders," he
said, looking at the crowd sur
rounding the kegs.
Freshman Tim Yarnall, who
claimed he was 21, said he went
to parties "to have a good time
and dance." He said he wasn't
planning on drinking more than
the cup of beer he was holding.
Yarnall said, "I can get beer
whenever I want. I have friends

with ID. I have ID. At parties,
getting alcohol is easy."
Yarnall, a baseball player, said
he didn't know any alcoholics on
the team, although he "knew peo
ple in the dorm with problems."
He said a lack of self-esteem
drives people to alcohol. Ignoring
his friends' teasing, he leaned for
ward and said, "They don't feel
confident being themselves."
When Paul was in high
school, his nickname was
"Alcohol Paul." As an
undergraduate, he used to pro
vide alcohol to his friends using a
service he called, "alcoholics
unanimous." The name choice
was an omen, he said.
Alcohol had become part of his
persona — a sign, Paul said, that
he was an alcoholic.
Genes and environment are
contributing factors to the onset
of this disease that "doesn't dis
criminate," Paul said. He esti
mated that about 10 to 12 per
cent of the population is alco
holic. About two-thirds of its
victims are men.
"There's no cookie-cutter
behavior pattern" for alcoholics,
Paul said. "An alcoholic is some
one whose life gets better when
they stop drinking."
Just as there's no stereotypi
cal alcoholic, there are many
reasons why people drink exces
sively. Tom said it was difficult
to understand why rich kids
needed to drink. "They weren't
poor. I couldn't fathom it,"he
said.
Now, he recognizes alco
holism's multiple causes. "An
overriding factor is lack of spiri
tuality," he said. "Poor people
lost faith through work, rich
kids through success."
Spirituality, both Tom and
Paul said, is not necessarily
organized religion, but personal
contact with "higher powers"
that is an essential aspect of
Alcoholics Anonymous' 12-step
recovery program.
In Tom's rural hometown,
drinking was a way of life. "We
used to lose two kids a year to
drinking and driving. That's a
lot of the population."
Both Tom's grandfathers, his
father and an older brother were
alcoholics. His grandmother
killed his grandfather, then her
self, with a shotgun to put an
end to "the hallucinations of
pink elephants in the bathroom"
that alcohol caused.

At his Ivy League college,
there was "tremendous alco
holism with undergraduates.
They used to drink fancy wines.
They knew the good years."
Tom became a bartender
because "it was good money for a
poor kid."
Paul's upper middle-class fam
ily doesn't have the same history
with alcoholism.
He said he always felt "pres
sure to drink," though, and that
his father treated it "like a rite of
passage." The first time Paul
came home drunk, when he was
15, his father gave him a hang
over remedy, while his mother
told him that "gentlemen
shouldn't drink to get drunk."
For many alcoholics, includ
ing Tom and Paul, tragedy
helped them realize their
drinking was out of control.
Tom's fiancee died of cancer
during his senior year. "I took

said. "Then she died."

ward and said, "They don't feel
confident being themselves."
When Paul was in high
school, his nickname was
"Alcohol Paul." As an
undergraduate, he used to pro
vide alcohol to his friends using a
service he called, "alcoholics
unanimous." The name choice
was an omen, he said.
Alcohol had become part of his
persona — a sign, Paul said, that
he was an alcoholic.
Genes and environment are
contributing factors to the onset
of this disease that "doesn't dis
criminate," Paul said. He esti
mated that about 10 to 12 per
cent of the population is alco
holic. About two-thirds of its
victims are men.
"There's no cookie-cutter
behavior pattern" for alcoholics,
Paul said. "An alcoholic is some
one whose life gets better when
they stop drinking."
Just as there's no stereotypi
cal alcoholic, there are many
reasons why people drink exces
sively. Tom said it was difficult
to understand why rich kids
needed to drink. "They weren't
poor. I couldn't fathom it,"he
said.
Now, he recognizes alco
holism's multiple causes. "An
overriding factor is lack of spiri
tuality," he said. "Poor people
lost faith through work, rich
kids through success."
Spirituality, both Tom and
Paul said, is not necessarily
organized religion, but personal
contact with "higher powers"
that is an essential aspect of
Alcoholics Anonymous' 12-step
recovery program.
In Tom's rural hometown,
drinking was a way of life. "We
used to lose two kids a year to
drinking and driving. That's a
lot of the population."
Both Tom's grandfathers, his
father and an older brother were
alcoholics. His grandmother
killed his grandfather, then her
self, with a shotgun to put an
end to "the hallucinations of
pink elephants in the bathroom"
that alcohol caused.

At his Ivy League college,
there was "tremendous alco
holism with undergraduates.
They used to drink fancy wines.
They knew the good years."
Tom became a bartender
because "it was good money for a
poor kid."
Paul's upper middle-class fam
ily doesn't have the same history
with alcoholism.
He said he always felt "pres
sure to drink," though, and that
his father treated it "like a rite of
passage." The first time Paul
came home drunk, when he was
15, his father gave him a hang
over remedy, while his mother
told him that "gentlemen
shouldn't drink to get drunk."
For many alcoholics, includ
ing Tom and Paul, tragedy
helped them realize their
drinking was out of control.
Tom's fiancee died of cancer
during his senior year. "I took
care of her for six months," he
said. "Then she died."
Because he "didn't know how
to deal with dying," Tom went to
an Alcoholics Anonymous meet
ing but was turned off because
"everyone was smoking — it was
one addiction for another."
He thought he could control
his disease. "Rather than try to
live without alcohol, I wanted to
control it through willpower."
But when he got drunk overseas
doing graduate school field
work, he realized he had to do
something differently. Last fall,
he joined Alcoholics Anony
mous.
"I was finally making a step
toward accepting that I have a
disease. I am powerless to con
trol it. That's the way it is."
When Paul lost a family mem
ber, he did not stop drinking
immediately. But, he calls the
tragedy a "catalyst" for his
recovery.
Paul said certain "red flags"
indicated that he had a problem.
He craved booze, drank until he
blacked out and lost control of
himself when he was drunk. "I
was beginning not to be a nice
drunk anymore," he said.
He also paid close attention to
how much he drank and what
sort of liquor it was — such close
attention that he remembers
specific numbers and brands,
four years into sobriety.
Despite the abundance of
signs, Paul still didn't recognize
he had the disease.
English Prof. Ken Fields, who
is an alcoholic, called this oblivi
ousness typical.
"The amount I drank
increased until I was drinking a
great deal of alcohol and smok
ing a great deal of marijuana. I
smoked it every day," Fields
said. "I did not think I was an
addict."
He described his alcoholism as
a "roll-top desk, where pieces of
evidence were stashed in differ
ent drawers." He edited his
description: "There were roll-top
desks all around my house. The
pieces were everywhere. I
couldn't see the whole picture."
For Paul, the signs of his alco
holism would surface during
blackouts, when he would
express grief and anger at his
family member's death. He
turned to an alcoholic priest for
help. "I wanted him to tell me if
I was an alcoholic," he said.
After attending an AA meeting,
Paul cut back on his drinking.
"I got the best grades I got
that semester," he said.
But that summer, while trav
eling with friends, Paul began
drinking more ferociously than
ever. He started worrying that
alcohol might kill him. "I had
already experienced a death," he
said, "I wasn't interested in
being the next one."

His grief and low self-esteem
broke through frequently during
his blackouts, friends told him.
In August, he realized he wanted
to stop. It wasn't until that fall,
after drinking 17 glasses of beer
and the "lion's share of a bottle
of Maker's Mark bourbon" that
Paul turned to a friend who
didn't drink much and told him
"I want to stop."
The next day, each of his
friends "intervened" at the
advice of the school alcoholism
counselor, telling Paul he had a
problem with drinking. Paul
began meeting with the coun
selor, who gave him literature on
the disease and a list of ques
tions that were designed to
determine whether he had a
problem.
Paul began a self-prescribed
"moderation program," in which
he limited his drinks to five on
weekdays, eight on weekends.
He couldn't stick to it, though,
and set a date by which he would
go cold turkey.
Withdrawal was painful. "I
was sleepy, depressed," he said.
"I was not able to do the work I
needed to do."
Picking up a 12-step recovery
book was a turning point. "I was
not used to needing other people
to help me do things," he said.
Four months into sobriety, he
started going to AA meetings. "I
felt very humble. Here I was the
self-proclaimed star of every
thing "
For Tom, admitting his
alcoholism last fall meant
recognizing that drinking
caused a problem in his life, and
that he would always be an alco
holic. "I wanted to say I was an
alcoholic, not I am an alcoholic."
Denial was easier. For Paul,
"There were always people who
were 'worse' than I was. And I
would say, if I'm not as bad as
so-and-so, who tended to be
druggies, then I don't have a
problem."
Fields describes his own 20-
year denial period "a mechanism
by which the mind does not let
you take full measure of your
alcoholism."
"Your mind takes certain
turns to protect your addiction.
It makes it seem remarkable
that anyone could stop drink
ing," he said.
According to Fields, story
telling is a principle tool of
recovery. Fields tells a story like
Hemingway, with forceful,
meaty sentences punctuated by
thick pauses. He pauses over the
story of Daniel Lichstein, the
junior who committed suicide
last November.
"His suicide note [that said 'I
am an alcoholic. I could not
withdraw'] was the first step to
admitting he was powerless —
that his life was unmanageable.
It's too bad he did it all by him
self.
"To break through denial
before you have any means of
recovery is horrifying. You
either go back to drinking or you
have to die," he said.
Alcoholics Anonymous' 12-
step recovery program has pro
vided Tom with this means.
Tom calls recovery a "concept of
sobriety that has nothing to do
with whether I'm drinking. I'm
completely honest. I accept
responsibility for everything I
do. It's where I try every
moment of the day to follow a
higher power and spiritual path
rather than the material."
"Stanford's culture. . . is
highly materialistic, no matter
how 'wacky' people act. There's
a high premium on how you look
whether you're wearing ratty
clothes to make a political state
ment, or three-piece suits," he
said.
