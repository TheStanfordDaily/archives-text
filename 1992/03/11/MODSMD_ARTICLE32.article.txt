## No. 2 tennis humbles UCLA, USC 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Prior to this weekend, the Stanford women's
tennis team and the UCLA Bruins have fol
lowed similar paths. Through National Indoors
both squads had 11-1 records, with top-ranked
Florida barely winning those matches.
But that is where their paths diverged.
Stanford clobbered UCLA 6-3 Sunday, follow
ing a 6-0 thrashing of USC Saturday.
To exacerbate the trip north, UCLA lost
after starting with a default victory. The Car
dinal's No. 3 player, Kylie Johnson, aggravat
ed a lower back injury Saturday against the
Trojans. Normally, coach Frank Brennan
could then move every player up a notch to fill
the void at No. 3.
However, Pacific 10 Conference rules forbid
position changes once written lineups are
exchanged. The UCLA contest was scheduled for
Friday and was rained out, but not before lineups
were set, with a healthy Kylie Johnson at No. 3.
However, the default only increased the Car
dinal's determination to pull out the match.
Laxmi Poruri notched the first victory as she
breezed by Mamie Ceniza 6-4, 6-2 at No. 2.
Heather Willens and Amy Chiminello soon
put Stanford ahead 2-1 with straight-set victo
ries. Willens rebounded from 1-4 and 2-4 down
to take both sets from Iwalani McCalla at 6-4.
"She's too big for me to hit tons of winners
off her so I just tried to hit the angles," Wil
lens said.
Willens came to net on several shots, some
thing she has done more frequently in the last
few matches. "That's the sign that I'm playing
well. I should get some high balls for me to
come in on," she said.
While Willens had to claw her way back in
each set, Chiminello was in the driver's seat the

entire match with Jenny Baker at No. 6. "I've
been concentrating on moving forward and
controlling my opponent," Chiminello said.
While Chiminello waxed Baker, Kristine
Kurth was fighting tooth-and-nail with Lee
Ann Rostovsky at No. 4. Kurth dropped the
first set, 1-6. "She tries to play at a very high
level in the first game. Nobody can do that.
You gradually increase your level as you get
into the match," Brennan said.
Kurth rebounded from 2-3 in the second set
to win 6-4. Rostovsky had several line rails over
ruled but her bad calls didn't make much differ
ence as Kurth captured 10 of the last 12 games.
Up 4-1, Stanford needed just one more win
to clinch the team victory. Emma Wood
house's match looked like it might be the last
nail in the UCLA coffin. But the Bruins'
Jenny Hilt had other plans.
HUt went on a tear in the third-set tiebreak
er, using blistering first serves to set Wood
house back on her heels. Hilt ran the score to
6-2, one point from victory. Fans, who packed
along the rail overlooking court No. 4, tensely
watched what appeared to be a quick end of a
tough battle.
But Woodhouse wasn't quite ready to leave
the court. She hit a clutch service winner and
Hilt double faulted. Woodhouse managed to
save a fourth match point, but not the fifth as
one of her groundstrokes sailed out. Hilt won
6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7-5).
"She served really well and I didn't play my
best. She was drilling the ball hard and deep. I
couldn't attack her shots," Woodhouse said.
With the No. 5 match over, attention
turned to the No. 1 doubles match. McCalla
and Ceniza had already taken the first set 6-3.
When Willens and Poruri saw that Wood
house had lost, "we realized that the match
was going to count. That's when we got ener

gized," Poruri said.
Willens and Poruri took advantage of a
UCLA letup to win the second set 6-2. The
Cardinal duo battled to 4-4 in the third. Poruri
won her service game. McCalla, however, dou
ble faulted twice and missed three other first
serves in the final game.
"As soon as they miss a first serve I almost
want to say 'Yes,'" said Willens with both fists
clenched. "I feel my chances of hitting a good
return go from 50-50 to 80-20."
"With second serve you can be the aggres
sor," Poruri said. "The server has to watch out
for a really low volley so it's a total reversal."
The Cardinal pair finished the match with
a high forehand volley from Willens. Pumping
her arms upward, Willens hugged Poruri
while the crowd erupted in celebration of the
match-clinching victory.
Woodhouse and Carruth quickly defaulted
the No. 2 doubles match.
At No. 3 Kurth and Chiminello won the
sluggish battle 5-7, 6-2, 6-3 over Foley and
Rostovsky.
The 6-3 win over UCLA followed a shutout
of USC. The toughest match was Johnson's
battle at No. 3.
By the end of the first set, Johnson was in
obvious pain. She couldn't move at full speed
and sudden twisting movements were nearly
impossible. Brennan suggested she default.
Johnson refused. "I've never quit a match and
I was determined to finish," she said.
After the trainer assured Brennan that
Johnson could play without exacerbating the
injury, she continued. She pulled out the tor
tuous last two sets, 6-4 and 6-3. "In the third
set she was literally crying on the court,"
Brennan said, describing her match as "one of
the most courageous things I've seen in my 13
years here."

to take both sets from Iwalani McCalla at 6-4.
"She's too big for me to hit tons of winners
off her so I just tried to hit the angles," Wil
lens said.
Willens came to net on several shots, some
thing she has done more frequently in the last
few matches. "That's the sign that I'm playing
well. I should get some high balls for me to
come in on," she said.
While Willens had to claw her way back in
each set, Chiminello was in the driver's seat the

entire match with Jenny Baker at No. 6. "I've
been concentrating on moving forward and
controlling my opponent," Chiminello said.
While Chiminello waxed Baker, Kristine
Kurth was fighting tooth-and-nail with Lee
Ann Rostovsky at No. 4. Kurth dropped the
first set, 1-6. "She tries to play at a very high
level in the first game. Nobody can do that.
You gradually increase your level as you get
into the match," Brennan said.
Kurth rebounded from 2-3 in the second set
to win 6-4. Rostovsky had several line rails over
ruled but her bad calls didn't make much differ
ence as Kurth captured 10 of the last 12 games.
Up 4-1, Stanford needed just one more win
to clinch the team victory. Emma Wood
house's match looked like it might be the last
nail in the UCLA coffin. But the Bruins'
Jenny Hilt had other plans.
HUt went on a tear in the third-set tiebreak
er, using blistering first serves to set Wood
house back on her heels. Hilt ran the score to
6-2, one point from victory. Fans, who packed
along the rail overlooking court No. 4, tensely
watched what appeared to be a quick end of a
tough battle.
But Woodhouse wasn't quite ready to leave
the court. She hit a clutch service winner and
Hilt double faulted. Woodhouse managed to
save a fourth match point, but not the fifth as
one of her groundstrokes sailed out. Hilt won
6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7-5).
"She served really well and I didn't play my
best. She was drilling the ball hard and deep. I
couldn't attack her shots," Woodhouse said.
With the No. 5 match over, attention
turned to the No. 1 doubles match. McCalla
and Ceniza had already taken the first set 6-3.
When Willens and Poruri saw that Wood
house had lost, "we realized that the match
was going to count. That's when we got ener

gized," Poruri said.
Willens and Poruri took advantage of a
UCLA letup to win the second set 6-2. The
Cardinal duo battled to 4-4 in the third. Poruri
won her service game. McCalla, however, dou
ble faulted twice and missed three other first
serves in the final game.
"As soon as they miss a first serve I almost
want to say 'Yes,'" said Willens with both fists
clenched. "I feel my chances of hitting a good
return go from 50-50 to 80-20."
"With second serve you can be the aggres
sor," Poruri said. "The server has to watch out
for a really low volley so it's a total reversal."
The Cardinal pair finished the match with
a high forehand volley from Willens. Pumping
her arms upward, Willens hugged Poruri
while the crowd erupted in celebration of the
match-clinching victory.
Woodhouse and Carruth quickly defaulted
the No. 2 doubles match.
At No. 3 Kurth and Chiminello won the
sluggish battle 5-7, 6-2, 6-3 over Foley and
Rostovsky.
The 6-3 win over UCLA followed a shutout
of USC. The toughest match was Johnson's
battle at No. 3.
By the end of the first set, Johnson was in
obvious pain. She couldn't move at full speed
and sudden twisting movements were nearly
impossible. Brennan suggested she default.
Johnson refused. "I've never quit a match and
I was determined to finish," she said.
After the trainer assured Brennan that
Johnson could play without exacerbating the
injury, she continued. She pulled out the tor
tuous last two sets, 6-4 and 6-3. "In the third
set she was literally crying on the court,"
Brennan said, describing her match as "one of
the most courageous things I've seen in my 13
years here."

Heather Willens blasts a forehand return during her No. 1 singles
match Sunday. Willens crushed Iwalani McCalla of UCLA 6-4,6-4 as
the Cardinal beat the Bruins 6-3.
Prior to this weekend, the Stanford women's
tennis team and the UCLA Bruins have fol
lowed similar paths. Through National Indoors
both squads had 11-1 records, with top-ranked
Florida barely winning those matches.
But that is where their paths diverged.
Stanford clobbered UCLA 6-3 Sunday, follow
ing a 6-0 thrashing of USC Saturday.
To exacerbate the trip north, UCLA lost
after starting with a default victory. The Car
dinal's No. 3 player, Kylie Johnson, aggravat
ed a lower back injury Saturday against the
Trojans. Normally, coach Frank Brennan
could then move every player up a notch to fill
the void at No. 3.
However, Pacific 10 Conference rules forbid
position changes once written lineups are
exchanged. The UCLA contest was scheduled for
Friday and was rained out, but not before lineups
were set, with a healthy Kylie Johnson at No. 3.
However, the default only increased the Car
dinal's determination to pull out the match.
Laxmi Poruri notched the first victory as she
breezed by Mamie Ceniza 6-4, 6-2 at No. 2.
Heather Willens and Amy Chiminello soon
