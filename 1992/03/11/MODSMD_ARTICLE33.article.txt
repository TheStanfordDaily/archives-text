## Three make the team 
### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's swimming team boast
ed several exceptional individual performances at
Olympic trials in Indianapolis last week.
Summer Sanders led the charge by qualify
ing for four events, the most of any American
swimmer. Jenny Thompson qualified for three
events, setting a world record and an Ameri
can record in the process, and Lea Loveless
qualified in one event to lead what may be the
strongest U.S. women's swimming team ever.
I The Olympic team looks to improve upon
; its 1988 performance. Janet Evans' three vic
• tories were the only gold medals won by Amer
ican female swimmers, with the only other
. medal a bronze earned by Mary T. Meagher. "I
; think we'll have a lot more medals than in
; 1988," Sanders said.
Sanders won the 200- and 400-meter indi
vidual medley before finishing second in the
! 100 butterfly. She followed these exceptional
; performances with a victory in the 200 fly.
; Thompson crushed the world record in the
• 100 freestyle by a quarter of a second in her
• preliminary heat, then followed that by beat
, ing the old standard again in the final heat.
; She then set an American record in the 50 free
; and qualified in the 200 as well.

Looking to the future, she commented that
she felt certain that the team "will come
together at NCAAs. We definitely have the
ability to win the championship."
The swim team will vie for that champi
onship on March 26-28, as the N0.2-ranked
Texas Longhorns look to avenge their perfor
mance against Stanford earlier this year.
Stanford followed their rout over the two
time defending national champions by out
shining them once again in the University of
Texas Invitational. However, the Cardinal
expects a better performance from the
Longhorns at NCAAs, where Texas always
seems to shine.
