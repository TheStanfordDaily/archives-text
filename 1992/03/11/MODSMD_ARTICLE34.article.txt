# Men challenge Texas

After a scant two week break after the
Olympic Trials, the Stanford men's swim team
will head back to Indianapolis during Spring
Break, competing March 26-28 as the favorite
to win the NCAA Championships team title.
Stanford qualified only one swimmer for
the US Olympic team, world record-holder
Jeff Rouse in the 100-meter backstroke, in
this difficult Olympic year. Rouse was one of
only three collegiate swimmers to make the
Olympic team.

"I'm upset with US swimming, with the
month they held the trials," said men's head
coach Skip Kenney. "College guys really took a
beating."
College swimmers were at a disadvantage
not only because of the proximity of conference
and the NCAA championship meets to the Tri
als, but also the effort needed to meet the out
rageous NCAA qualifying standards required
for swimmers to compete at the NCAA cham
pionships. Many swimmers finishing in the
top-five in individual events at the Olympic
Trials did not make the NCAA cut-off times.
Stanford will no doubt have more success
at the NCAAs, looking to win its first title
since 1987. The Stanford squad has united
again, after sending over half of its swimmers
to the trials, concentrating on dethroning the
reigning champions of Texas.
The Cardinal looks to come on strong on
the first day, featuring two relays, the 50
freestyle and the 200 Individual Medley. In
the past, the first day was Stanford's weakest,
but this year should be a strong one for the
Cardinal.
"I should be able to tell you after the first
day who's going to win," Kenney said. "Either
we'll put ourselves in the driver's seat, or we'll
give it up."
Rouse will have key swims for the Cardinal,
individually as well as in the relays, along with
Chas Morton who has a chance to win an indi
vidual title himself.
