nasties team now have to regret
about the 1992 season is that the

leaving the school's record books
in shambles after yet another
\ high-powered performance, a

190.30 that the squad had set on

• who eclipsed her own school
' record in the all-around by a
l quarter of a point, raising the
standard from 38.70 to 38.95.
• Elzie put up a Stanford-record
; 9.90 on the uneven bars (slightly

• and a 9.70 on the balance beam.
J Considering that she had hyper

after tallying a 9.55 on her first
attempt, the record may have
stood in the 39 range when the
night was over.
Sophomore Kerri Kanuka also
bettered the old 38.70 mark, fin
ishing second to Elzie in the all
around with a 38.80 total.
"Nuke" also entered her name in
the Cardinal record books, tally
ing a 9.90 in the floor exercise to
go with a 9.80 on the bars.
"Jene and Kerri are both doing
a tremendous job," said Stanford
head coach Breck Greenwood.
"They both rose to the occasion."
Freshman Katie Clancy, who
established her own collegiate
best of 38.25 in the all-around,
including a personal-best 9.70 on
the bars, best summarized the
attitude of the Cardinal in the
wake of such an electrifying out
ing.
As great an impression the
women may have made Friday
night, the prevailing feeling was
that the team could have reached
an even higher plateau had it not
been for Elzie's injury and other
ailments afflicting the squad at
this stage of the season.
"We took out a lot of difficulty
because of fatigue-type injuries,
so these next two weeks should let
us get healthy again," said sopho
more Laurie West, who contribut
ed to the team's scores in the
vault, bars, and beam.
The team will return to action
with a dual meet at San Jose
State March 21. The Pacific 10
Conference Championship meet
will follow on March 28 in Tuc
son, Ariz., as the Cardinal vies for
a spot in NCAA regional competi
tion in April.
