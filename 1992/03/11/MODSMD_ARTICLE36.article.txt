# Gym vaults to top
## 
### Peter Marks Staff writer 
The wave of confidence the
men's gymnastics squad rode
into this weekend turned into a
tidal wave after two phenome
nal tournaments.
The Cardinal won the UC-
Santa Barbara Invitational
Friday, then set a new school
record for points Saturday
against California.
Stanford beat seven other
teams at Santa Barbara includ
ing Brigham Young, its tough
est opponent of the year. In
January, BYU defeated the
Cardinal in its first meet of the
season.
Stanford showed its
improvement since that meet,
beating BYU by two points, an
impressive victory margin in
gymnastics. Stanford scored
283.95 points.
"We proved there was no
way they could beat us," said
Stanford coach Sadao Hamada.
Jair Lynch came in second
in the all-around competition
behind BYU's Jing-Wei Liang,
a Chinese national team mem
ber who may transfer to Stan
ford. Liang won the meet only
after Lynch struggled on the
high bar, the last individual
event.
Lynch won the pommel
horse and parallel bars, with

Mark Booth taking second in
the latter competition. Chris
Sey triumphed in vaulting and
Tim Ryan came away with a
fourth-place finish in the all
around.
The Cardinal's true test
came the next night when they
faced California at home.
Rather than appear fatigued,
Stanford looked as though it
had just been on Spring Break.
The Cardinal scored 288.40
points, beating the school
record established last year by
nearly two points.
In posting the highest score
of any team in the nation this
season, Stanford almost cer
tainly claimed the top ranking
in the NCAA.
Once again, Lynch led the
way for the Cardinal, breaking
his own school record in the
all-around with a score of
58.55. The junior set the previ
ous record of 58.30 last year.
"I'm happy with the whole
team coming together and hav
ing that fire," Lynch said. "It's
remarkable to do this well
being tired."
Not just Lynch but the
entire squad dazzled its home
crowd at Burnham Pavilion.
According to Hamada, the
team is progressing according
to plan and should be able to
score 290 points by the NCAA
Championships in April.
