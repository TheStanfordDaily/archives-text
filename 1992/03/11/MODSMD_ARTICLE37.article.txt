# Card nine batters USC
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
What the heck is going on
here? The book on Stanford's
baseball team was supposed to
say "great pitching, not so great
hitting." Wins were to come by
dominant pitching, solid pitching,
and a few manufactured runs.
Games were to be close. Well, for
get about all of that.
Stanford established itself as a
hitting as well as a pitching club
in its performance last weekend
against USC, taking two out of
three from the Trojans. All three
games featured blowouts, amaz
ing complete game pitching per
formances, and serious Stanford
hitting.
Following a Friday rainout, the
first game of a Saturday double
header pitted Stanford's Brain
Sackinsky against Southern Cal's
Dan Hubbs. But the pitcher's dual
was not to be, as Hubbs pitched
nine solid innings, and Sackinsky
got nailed. Down 1-0 in the third,
the Trojan bats absolutely erupt
ed, and USC scored 12 runs in the
next five innings. However, while
the final 13-4 score correctly
implies poor Stanford pitching, it
need not imply poor hitting.
The Cardinal amassed 12 hits
in the game, only three less than
their opponents. The number 1-2-
3 hitters went a collective 8-14,
including a 4-5 performance be
Dave Cornell, and Steve Solomon
managed a late inning home run.

But the hitting wasn't timely
enough, the defense not solid
enough (two errors), and the pitch
ing definitely not good enough.
The second game would see
complete Cardinal dominance.
Once again, the apparent great
pitching matchup, Stanford phe
nom Rick Helling against 1991
Six-Pac Pitcher of the Year Jackie
Nickell, turned out to not be no
match at all. Nickell allowed eight
runs in less than five innings,
while Helling pitched an absolute
gem. In a complete game perfor
mance, Helling allowed only one
HIT, striking out eight, and fac
ing only seven over the minimum
in an 8-0 complete game win.
Meanwhile at the plate, Stan
ford showed that the first game
was no fluke. The Cardinal col
lected 16 hits in the game. Chris
Kemper was on fire, going 4-5
with two doubles, three RBI, and
a stolen base. Cornell had three
hits, and Jeffrey Hammonds went
2-4 with a pair of stolen bases.
Sunday dawned clear and
sunny for the rubber match, that
once again proved to be over after
a few innings. The Cardinal
exploded for five runs in the first
two innings, which is all Stanford
starter Willie Adams would need
as he pitched a 11-4 complete
game win, striking out six.
Solid hitting performances
were put in all around. Cornell,
Dusty Allen, and Solomon all col
lected three hits, and Mark Skeels
and Tony Detter both hit homers.
