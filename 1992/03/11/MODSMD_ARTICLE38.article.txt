# STANFORD CATCHES TOURNEY FEVER
## One Val-uable player Whiting on top of women's basketball world 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
On an electric evening in December of 1989, in
the Stanford women's basketball team's fourth
game of the season, a then-record 5,425 fans gath
ered in Maples Pavilion to watch two of the most
important events in Cardinal history take place.
One was an 85-71 thumping of defending nation
al champion Tennessee, which more than any other
game marked Stanford's ascendence to the highest
level of women's basketball.
The other was the play of a certain freshman.
Immediately after the game, talk could already be
heard among the fans of a passing of the torch. "The
Jennifer Azzi era is ending," they said. "But the Val
Whiting era is beginning."
Everyone in the stands knew that she provided
the physical dimension which was necessary to beat
Tennessee and elevate the Cardinal to the top, and
they greeted her performance with deafening noise.
It was no coincidence that Stanford achieved that
milestone victory after Whiting joined the team.
Back then she was just one name on a team loaded
with big ones. Now she is the marquee player on a
young Cardinal team that is ranked No. 3 in the nation.
Two years after being named the National Fresh
man of the Year by the Women's Basketball News
Service, Whiting is a virtual lock for the Kodak All-
America team and is a favorite to win Pacific 10 Con
ference Player of the Year honors.
Washington coach Chris Gobrecht has called
Whiting "the best player in the country." And an
ever-growing number of coaches have at some point
or another said something like, "No one can go one
on-one with Val," or "We couldn't stop Val Whiting."
Whiting's role has evolved steadily but surely
since she was known as a "supersub" in her fresh
man year. This is the first year that she has not split
time in the post with Trisha Stevens and Julie Zeil
stra, the team's leading scorers for the past two
years respectively. Consequently she has assumed
more of the scoring burden.
After garnering a reputation as more of a
rebounder and defender than a scorer her first two
years, Whiting has tweaked her offensive machinery
to the tune of 19 ppg, good for sixth in the Pac-10. In

a perfectly average game she will get 8.6 rebounds,
1.6 blocks, 1.6 steals, and 2.0 assists. She leads the
team in every category except assists.
But many say that she is the best interior passer
in the Pac-10, if not the country. And it is the team
aspect of the game that she enjoys the most.
"I like to fire other people up," she said. "I think
I do that well sometimes."
"She brings electricity to the game," VanDerveer
said. "Her play gets the crowd involved .... And prob
ably the best thing about Val is — and I her put her
in a class with Jennifer Azzi and Sonja Henning —
she's very unselfish. She is excited when our team
does well. She might have 33 points, which she did
against Cal, and she was devastated because our
team didn't do well."
Her unselfishness and her ability to pump herself
and her teammates up are two of the reasons why
Whiting is much more valuable to her team than
even her statistics indicate.
"She's quiet but she shows through her actions
how the game should be played," said VanDerveer.
And on a team with one sophomore and two
freshman post players, that is something that Van-
Derveer particularly appreciates.
Anita Kaplan is one of those freshmen. The 6-
foot-5 center has looked to Whiting for inspiration
since her days as a freshman in high school.
"When I was in ninth grade I played in a tourna
ment in Virginia, the same tournament that Val
did," Kaplan said. "And my AAU coach and my
father had seen her play one night, and they said,
'Oh my gosh, there is this incredible basketball play
er, and you have to see her.'
Kaplan said that she sees her elder as a valued
teacher.
"She's taught me a lot of things," Kaplan said,
"not necessarily tangible things .... She helps
encourage me and said 'Get mad, get mean.. ..'
That kind of ripple effect of making everyone
around her better is what makes Whiting the obvi
ous choice for Pac-10 Player of the Year. Her game
simply has few weaknesses, if any.
Of course, Whiting herself will be the first to tell
you that she is still far from perfect: "As Tara said,
you can never rebound too much or play too much
defense, so I think I need to improve those things."

According to coach Tara VanDerveer, the Cardinal has rediscovered a killer instinct that it had
seemingly lost after the Tennessee game on Dec. 14.
