# Adkins's fortunes rise with success of team
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Stanford women's basketball
has progressively improved since
coach Tara VanDerveer took over
at the helm in the 1985-86 season.
Ann Adkins, the lone senior on
this year's Cardinal squad, has
witnessed that improvement first
hand, participating in Stanford's
ascendance to the top of the
women's basketball ranks.
The Cardinal bettered its
record in each of Adkins' first
three years on the Farm, and the
fifth-year senior has likewise
improved her play. In 1988,
Adkins' freshman year, the Cardi
nal made it to the NCAA West
Regional semifinals before bow
ing out to Texas. She saw action
in 21 of 32 games, including a
strong eight-point performance
against Cal on 4-for-5 shooting.
In 1989, Stanford went one
step further, losing in the Mid
west Regional final to Louisiana
State. Likewise, Adkins played in
one more game, appearing in 22 of
Stanford's 31 contests. With two
seconds remaining in an ESPN
nationally televised game against
Pacific 10 Conference rival USC,
Adkins hit two free throws to give
Stanford a 100-85 victory.
In 1990, Stanford reached the
pinnacle, defeating Auburn to
claim the national title. Adkins,
however, did not suit up the
entire season, but followed the
Cardinal on the road to the cham
pionship — as the team's student
trainer.
"My sophomore year was very
difficult for me, both in academics
and in basketball," Adkins said.
"Basketball was not fun at all for
me. A team is only as good as its
weakest link, and I didn't want to
pull them all down, so I decided to
take a year off."
Does she regret that the year
she decided to redshirt was the
year the Cardinal won it all?
"I regret it a little bit, and at the
championship I sort of wished I
could put on a uniform and play, but

in the long run, I made the right
choice," Adkins said. "The year off
was very good for me mentally."
After her one-year hiatus,
Adkins had high hopes for the 1991
campaign, but again remained a
spectator for a large part of the sec
ond half of the season due to a

stress fracture in the tibia of her
foot. However, she did recover in
time to knock down a 3-pointer in
the Cardinal's NCAA national
semifinal loss to Tennessee.
"For me, the high point of my
career so far was New Orleans
and the Final Four. Playing in

that game — there's nothing like
it," she said.
The fifth-year senior has par
ticipated in the Stanford women's
basketball team rise to national
prominence. "It's (the transfor
mation) been really amazing.
When I was recruited Stanford
was a .500 team," she said. "But
people like Jennifer (Azzi), Katy
(Steding), Trisha (Stevens), and
Sonja (Henning) really worked
hard, spending their summers
(practicing), and setting such a
great example."
This year, the Huntington, W.
Va. native has truly come into her
own, having played in 23 of Stan
ford's 27 games thus far. She
scored a career-high 14 points
earlier this year against Oral
Roberts, and also scored in dou
ble-figures on two other occa
sions: against San Diego, and at
Oregon State, a game in which
she started.
Adkins is a good outside shoot
er who provides the Cardinal with
added scoring punch off of the
bench. She especially likes to fire
from long range, and is shooting
32.6% from 3-point country.
"I am more confident in my
ability to shoot the ball when I'm
open," Adkins commented. "Tara
has more confidence in me and so
do my teammates. I'm in the rota
tion this year going in for Chris
MacMurdo, and that helps
because I'm getting a lot more
playing time."
"Ann definitely helps us play
together. She tries to make the
most of what she has, and she's
very smart," VanDerveer said.
Also, because this is her fifth
year, she is looked to as a role
model. "Ann's almost like a moth
er to us," said center Val Whiting.
A Converse Academic Ail-
American out of high school,
Adkins is mtgoring in human biol
ogy, and hopes to become a physi
cal therapist. But all that can
wait, for though Adkins will be
getting her degree, she wants to
leave Stanford with something
else as well — the NCAA title.
