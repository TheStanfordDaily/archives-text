## 'If we had known, we could have helped him' Parents of student suicide victim contest Stanford's policy on parental notification 
### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
During Freshman Orientation, parents
are advised to "butt out," Hoover Institu
tion fellow Thomas Sowell wrote in a
recent edition of Forbes magazine.
That advice is based on Stanford's
belief that "students should be treated as
adults," said Dean of Students Michael
Jackson.
And while this philosophy raises few
eyebrows when applied to bills and
grades, the real question is what happens
in more serious cases, such as alcohol
abuse or disciplinary problems. Should
parents be notified in these scenarios?
According to Jackson, the answer is usu
ally no.
But Janine and Henry Lichstein —
whose son, Daniel, committed suicide this
fall — disagree. In his suicide note,
Daniel, a junior, referred to his alcohol
dependency — a problem known to the
University but not to his parents.
"If we had known about Daniel's prob
lems, we could have helped him," Mr. Lich
stein said in an interview. "Stanford is
clearly on the wrong end of the spectrum
on the issue of parental notification."

Stanford's belief is that
students should be
treated as adults.

Though there is "no blanket rule of
thumb," Jackson said University policy is
to "deal with students as adults" — mean
ing students are sent grades and bills. It is
then the students' responsibility to commu
nicate that information to their parents.
"As a rule, we generally do not notify
parents," Jackson said. "But it really
depends on the situation — it is on a case
by-case basis."
And it is only in rare cases that the
University deems it appropriate to notify
parents. Even cases of suspension and
expulsion will not result in a parent being
contacted, said Diana Conklin, associate
director of residential education.
Conklin said she encourages students
to communicate with their parents, but
leaves the actual action up to the
student.
When students are known to
have a problem, they are asked to
check in with the deans, according
to Jackson. "But after a certain
period of time, we trust the stu
dent's judgment," and do not check
up on them anymore, he said.
Stanford, like all post-sec
ondary institutions, must follow
the Buckley Amendment, a feder
al law that defines the restrictions
on parents' access to the stu
dent's education record.
Conklin said she has gotten
numerous complaints from par
ents about Stanford's policy,
including surprise that bills and
grades are not sent home.
However, grades and bills are
not the real problem. Jackson said
parents have the most difficulty
understanding the University's
reticence when a student gets into
trouble.
'We were not informed'
Alice Bender, residence dean of
Toyon and several other dorms,
said the decision to contact par
ents is a "judgment call" made by
the residence dean — alone or in
conjunction with Jackson. Bender
said that in her year here, she has
not yet called any parents.
And the call that was not made
to the parents of Daniel Lichstein
is what has his parents so upset.
Lichstein was found dead in his
Toyon Hall room on November 9,
an apparent suicide.
His parents said they had no
knowledge of their son's alcohol
problem or of the fact that the
University had placed him on pro
bation for an alcohol-related inci
dent his freshman year.
An unsigned note found in his
room after his death read, "I am an
alcoholic, but I could not withdraw."

Toyon Resident Fellow James
Fox said students told him that
Daniel Lichstein "didn't drink
very frequently, but when he did
he got out of control" and acted in
ways that made other students
uncomfortable.
In a letter they circulated
among their friends and sent to
Jackson, the Lichsteins expressed
concern that they were never told
about their son's problems.
"Most of our friends were as sur
prised as we were that we were told
nothing about what happened," the
letter says. "Few of us realize how
completely we (parents) are cut off
from what happens when our chil
dren are at school."
The Lichsteins said they could
have helped their son had they
known of his problems. "We were
not informed, and we were not
involved in the response to a prob
lem known by Stanford but not by
us," they say in the letter.
"To Stanford, Daniel 'appeared
on the radar screen, then disap
peared' in his freshman year," the
letter continues. "Unfortunately,
Daniel did not resolve his problem,
could not withstand the pain it
caused him, and is dead as a result."
"If we had known, we would
have been involved," Mr. Lich
stein said in an interview. "But
that's the disadvantage of being
3,000 miles away."
However, some students
believe they should be treated as
adults, and don't think parents
should be notified about their
problems. One freshman, who has
hospitalized for alcohol poisoning
earlier this year, said he was glad
his parents were not told of his
hospital stay.
His parents found out about it
eventually, because of the hospi
tal bill, but "It worked out better
that way," he said. "I called them
and talked about it with them
later."
But other parents — such as
Happy Dumas, president of the
Mother's Club at Stanford — sup

port the Lichsteins.
"Parents should be notified —
particularly if there's a drug or
alcohol problem," Dumas said,
adding that parents could help
the most in situations like these.
"Even if you're 50, you need help.
We all need help."
Releasing the information
If parents won't be notified
about their child's problems, they
should at least know that they
won't be told, the Lichsteins argue.
"The rules of the school should
be known to students and par
ents," Mr. Lichstein said, adding
that Stanford's policy is not clear
ly stated in the various student
handbooks. "Parents should real
ize that they are going to be told
nothing."
Jackson said the policy of not
notifying parents about students'
problems is "a natural outgrowth
of the policy on bills and grades. It
isn't written anywhere explicitly."
"If it turns out it would be
more helpful if it were (written
out explicitly), that may be a valid
criticism," he said.
One option Lichstein suggested
is a release form signed by the stu
dent that allows the school to
inform the parents if the student
does "anything which could be rea
sonably expected to cause injury to
him or herself or to others," or if
the student is suspended, hospital
ized or put on probation.
If the student does not sign the
form, then the parents at least
know they will not be notified and
"will know to find other mecha
nisms to establish contact," Mr.
Lichstein said in the letter.
Lee Rooker, director of the
Family Policy Compliance Office
in Washington D.C. — which
administers the Buckley Amend
ment — said such a consent form
would be acceptable as long as it
details exactly which information
can be released.
Jackson declined to comment
specifically on the Lichstein case,

but said he and the Lichsteins
have talked, and he foresees no
changes in policy as a result of the
exchange.
"What they've done for me is
heighten my awareness of the
concerns of parents," Jackson
said. "I have discussed this with
the residence deans and we will
always keep the parents' concerns
in mind."
Defining rights of access
The Buckley Amendment,
known officially as the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy
Act, lays out the rights of stu
dents and parents in accessing a
student's education record.
Rooker said that in general, the
1974 amendment to the General
Education Provisions Act defines
an education record as anything
"personally definable and main
tained by the university."
According to the document itself,
the rights to the education record
belong to the parents until the stu
dent becomes "eligible" — that is,
until the student turns 18 or enters
a postsecondary institution.
At that point, "anyone who
wants access to a student's
records must have the student's
written permission — even par
ents," Rooker said.
However, there is an exception.
Rooker said if the student is a
dependent of his or her parents —
that is, if the student is listed as a
dependent on the parents' tax
form for the Internal Revenue
Service — the parents do not need
the student's permission to see
the records.
Just paying a student's tuition
is not enough to qualify the stu
dent as a dependent, though,
according to Rooker. "The par
ents must be the majority
providers in all ways," he said.
If a student is a dependent, the
university can release any infor
mation to his or her parents, even
if the student specifically asks the
university not to, Rooker said. It

is not required that the university
release the records, though. "It's
up to the university," he said.
'A hollow stick*
As a private university, Stan
ford can choose not to abide by
the Buckley Amendment. Howev
er, it risks losing Department of
Education funds — which include
research grants — if it does not
comply, according to Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole.
However, Rooker said, "There
aren't any schools that would risk
losing [funding] over FERPA (the
Buckley Amendment)." He added
that in the 18 years the amend
ment has been in effect, his office
has not yet taken funding away
from any university.
There is "sufficient latitude"
within the amendment for uni
versities to have very different
policies, said Sheldon Steinbach,
the general counsel for the Amer
ican Council on Education.
"Generally, most schools do
not disclose health or disciplinary
matters to parents," Steinbach
said. "But there are schools that
do notify parents as part of the
disciplinary procedure. The stu
dents are required to call their
parents themselves as part of the
procedure."
Those schools that do this "are
probably violating the intent of
Buckley, but the termination of
all Department of Education
funds has not happened in all 18
years, and it's not likely to occur,"
he said. "[Buckley] is a very hol
low stick."
'In loco parentis'
Stanford's approach to parental
notification, which is more confi
dential than some other schools,
actually pre-dates the Buckley
Amendment by several years,
according to Conklin.
Conklin said the current policy
was an extension of the general
movement in the late '60s and
early '70s toward individual pri

vacy and responsibility. She
added that she hoped Stanford
would not go back to the previous
policy of "in loco parentis" — by
which the University acted as a
surrogate parent to students.
UC-Berkeley follows a policy
similar to Stanford's. "For the
most part, we don't notify the
parents — not even in the case of
suspension and expulsion," said
Berkeley Dean of Student Life
Francisco Hernandez.
Parents will only be notified if
there is "a great urgency, such as
death or impending death," Her
nandez said.
Some other private and inde
pendent colleges take more liberty
with the Buckley Amendment
than Stanford does. According to
Cris Roosenraad, the Dean of Stu
dents at Carleton College, Car
leton's policy tries to balance stu
dent privacy with parental notifi
cation.
"We don't notify parents rou
tinely," he said, "only in cases of
jeopardy to health, academic jeop
ardy or disciplinary jeopardy." If a
student were suspended or
expelled, the parents would always
be notified, Roosenraad said.
In any situation that led to judi
cial action — even if the student
were caught cheating — Carleton
parents would be told, he said.
Conklin said that in her years
as director of the residence deans,
from 1985 until last September,
she only called the parents of two
students.
In one case, the student had
been hospitalized with a .4 blood
alcohol count. Conklin said the
University had already been
working with the student — who
had a "pattern of drinking" — for
a year, and that all Stanford
resources, including Counseling
and Psychological Services, had
not been able to "effect a change."
In that instance, she said, she
believed calling the students' par
ents was justifiable. "We had run
out of alternatives," Conklin said.
During Freshman Orientation, parents
are advised to "butt out," Hoover Institu
tion fellow Thomas Sowell wrote in a
recent edition of Forbes magazine.
That advice is based on Stanford's
belief that "students should be treated as
adults," said Dean of Students Michael

is a release form signed by the stu
dent that allows the school to
inform the parents if the student
does "anything which could be rea
sonably expected to cause injury to
him or herself or to others," or if
the student is suspended, hospital
ized or put on probation.
If the student does not sign the
form, then the parents at least
know they will not be notified and
"will know to find other mecha
nisms to establish contact," Mr.
Lichstein said in the letter.
Lee Rooker, director of the
Family Policy Compliance Office
in Washington D.C. — which
administers the Buckley Amend
ment — said such a consent form
would be acceptable as long as it
details exactly which information
can be released.
Jackson declined to comment
specifically on the Lichstein case,

but said he and the Lichsteins
have talked, and he foresees no
changes in policy as a result of the
exchange.
"What they've done for me is
heighten my awareness of the
concerns of parents," Jackson
said. "I have discussed this with
the residence deans and we will
always keep the parents' concerns
in mind."
Defining rights of access
The Buckley Amendment,
known officially as the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy
Act, lays out the rights of stu
dents and parents in accessing a
student's education record.
Rooker said that in general, the
1974 amendment to the General
Education Provisions Act defines
an education record as anything
"personally definable and main
tained by the university."
According to the document itself,
the rights to the education record
belong to the parents until the stu
dent becomes "eligible" — that is,
until the student turns 18 or enters
a postsecondary institution.
At that point, "anyone who
wants access to a student's
records must have the student's
written permission — even par
ents," Rooker said.
However, there is an exception.
Rooker said if the student is a
dependent of his or her parents —
that is, if the student is listed as a
dependent on the parents' tax
form for the Internal Revenue
Service — the parents do not need
the student's permission to see
the records.
Just paying a student's tuition
is not enough to qualify the stu
dent as a dependent, though,
according to Rooker. "The par
ents must be the majority
providers in all ways," he said.
If a student is a dependent, the
university can release any infor
mation to his or her parents, even
if the student specifically asks the
university not to, Rooker said. It

is not required that the university
release the records, though. "It's
up to the university," he said.
'A hollow stick*
As a private university, Stan
ford can choose not to abide by
the Buckley Amendment. Howev
er, it risks losing Department of
Education funds — which include
research grants — if it does not
comply, according to Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole.
However, Rooker said, "There
aren't any schools that would risk
losing [funding] over FERPA (the
Buckley Amendment)." He added
that in the 18 years the amend
ment has been in effect, his office
has not yet taken funding away
from any university.
There is "sufficient latitude"
within the amendment for uni
versities to have very different
policies, said Sheldon Steinbach,
the general counsel for the Amer
ican Council on Education.
"Generally, most schools do
not disclose health or disciplinary
matters to parents," Steinbach
said. "But there are schools that
do notify parents as part of the
disciplinary procedure. The stu
dents are required to call their
parents themselves as part of the
procedure."
Those schools that do this "are
probably violating the intent of
Buckley, but the termination of
all Department of Education
funds has not happened in all 18
years, and it's not likely to occur,"
he said. "[Buckley] is a very hol
low stick."
'In loco parentis'
Stanford's approach to parental
notification, which is more confi
dential than some other schools,
actually pre-dates the Buckley
Amendment by several years,
according to Conklin.
Conklin said the current policy
was an extension of the general
movement in the late '60s and
early '70s toward individual pri

vacy and responsibility. She
added that she hoped Stanford
would not go back to the previous
policy of "in loco parentis" — by
which the University acted as a
surrogate parent to students.
UC-Berkeley follows a policy
similar to Stanford's. "For the
most part, we don't notify the
parents — not even in the case of
suspension and expulsion," said
Berkeley Dean of Student Life
Francisco Hernandez.
Parents will only be notified if
there is "a great urgency, such as
death or impending death," Her
nandez said.
Some other private and inde
pendent colleges take more liberty
with the Buckley Amendment
than Stanford does. According to
Cris Roosenraad, the Dean of Stu
dents at Carleton College, Car
leton's policy tries to balance stu
dent privacy with parental notifi
cation.
"We don't notify parents rou
tinely," he said, "only in cases of
jeopardy to health, academic jeop
ardy or disciplinary jeopardy." If a
student were suspended or
expelled, the parents would always
be notified, Roosenraad said.
In any situation that led to judi
cial action — even if the student
were caught cheating — Carleton
parents would be told, he said.
Conklin said that in her years
as director of the residence deans,
from 1985 until last September,
she only called the parents of two
students.
In one case, the student had
been hospitalized with a .4 blood
alcohol count. Conklin said the
University had already been
working with the student — who
had a "pattern of drinking" — for
a year, and that all Stanford
resources, including Counseling
and Psychological Services, had
not been able to "effect a change."
In that instance, she said, she
believed calling the students' par
ents was justifiable. "We had run
out of alternatives," Conklin said.
During Freshman Orientation, parents
are advised to "butt out," Hoover Institu
tion fellow Thomas Sowell wrote in a
recent edition of Forbes magazine.
That advice is based on Stanford's
belief that "students should be treated as
adults," said Dean of Students Michael
Jackson.
And while this philosophy raises few
eyebrows when applied to bills and
grades, the real question is what happens
in more serious cases, such as alcohol
abuse or disciplinary problems. Should
parents be notified in these scenarios?
According to Jackson, the answer is usu
ally no.
But Janine and Henry Lichstein —
whose son, Daniel, committed suicide this
fall — disagree. In his suicide note,
Daniel, a junior, referred to his alcohol
dependency — a problem known to the
University but not to his parents.
"If we had known about Daniel's prob
lems, we could have helped him," Mr. Lich
stein said in an interview. "Stanford is
clearly on the wrong end of the spectrum
on the issue of parental notification."

Stanford's belief is that
students should be
treated as adults.

Though there is "no blanket rule of
thumb," Jackson said University policy is
to "deal with students as adults" — mean
ing students are sent grades and bills. It is
then the students' responsibility to commu
nicate that information to their parents.
"As a rule, we generally do not notify
parents," Jackson said. "But it really
depends on the situation — it is on a case
by-case basis."
And it is only in rare cases that the
University deems it appropriate to notify
parents. Even cases of suspension and
expulsion will not result in a parent being
contacted, said Diana Conklin, associate
director of residential education.
Conklin said she encourages students
to communicate with their parents, but
leaves the actual action up to the
student.
When students are known to
have a problem, they are asked to
check in with the deans, according
to Jackson. "But after a certain
period of time, we trust the stu
dent's judgment," and do not check
up on them anymore, he said.
Stanford, like all post-sec
ondary institutions, must follow
the Buckley Amendment, a feder
al law that defines the restrictions
on parents' access to the stu
dent's education record.
Conklin said she has gotten
numerous complaints from par
ents about Stanford's policy,
including surprise that bills and
grades are not sent home.
However, grades and bills are
not the real problem. Jackson said
parents have the most difficulty
understanding the University's
reticence when a student gets into
trouble.
'We were not informed'
Alice Bender, residence dean of
Toyon and several other dorms,
said the decision to contact par
ents is a "judgment call" made by
the residence dean — alone or in
conjunction with Jackson. Bender
said that in her year here, she has
not yet called any parents.
And the call that was not made
to the parents of Daniel Lichstein
is what has his parents so upset.
Lichstein was found dead in his
Toyon Hall room on November 9,
an apparent suicide.
His parents said they had no
knowledge of their son's alcohol
problem or of the fact that the
University had placed him on pro
bation for an alcohol-related inci
dent his freshman year.
An unsigned note found in his
room after his death read, "I am an
alcoholic, but I could not withdraw."

Toyon Resident Fellow James
Fox said students told him that
Daniel Lichstein "didn't drink
very frequently, but when he did
he got out of control" and acted in
ways that made other students
uncomfortable.
In a letter they circulated
among their friends and sent to
Jackson, the Lichsteins expressed
concern that they were never told
about their son's problems.
"Most of our friends were as sur
prised as we were that we were told
nothing about what happened," the
letter says. "Few of us realize how
completely we (parents) are cut off
from what happens when our chil
dren are at school."
The Lichsteins said they could
have helped their son had they
known of his problems. "We were
not informed, and we were not
involved in the response to a prob
lem known by Stanford but not by
us," they say in the letter.
"To Stanford, Daniel 'appeared
on the radar screen, then disap
peared' in his freshman year," the
letter continues. "Unfortunately,
Daniel did not resolve his problem,
could not withstand the pain it
caused him, and is dead as a result."
"If we had known, we would
have been involved," Mr. Lich
stein said in an interview. "But
that's the disadvantage of being
3,000 miles away."
However, some students
believe they should be treated as
adults, and don't think parents
should be notified about their
problems. One freshman, who has
hospitalized for alcohol poisoning
earlier this year, said he was glad
his parents were not told of his
hospital stay.
His parents found out about it
eventually, because of the hospi
tal bill, but "It worked out better
that way," he said. "I called them
and talked about it with them
later."
But other parents — such as
Happy Dumas, president of the
Mother's Club at Stanford — sup

port the Lichsteins.
"Parents should be notified —
particularly if there's a drug or
alcohol problem," Dumas said,
adding that parents could help
the most in situations like these.
"Even if you're 50, you need help.
We all need help."
Releasing the information
If parents won't be notified
about their child's problems, they
should at least know that they
won't be told, the Lichsteins argue.
"The rules of the school should
be known to students and par
ents," Mr. Lichstein said, adding
that Stanford's policy is not clear
ly stated in the various student
handbooks. "Parents should real
ize that they are going to be told
nothing."
Jackson said the policy of not
notifying parents about students'
problems is "a natural outgrowth
of the policy on bills and grades. It
isn't written anywhere explicitly."
"If it turns out it would be
more helpful if it were (written
out explicitly), that may be a valid
criticism," he said.
One option Lichstein suggested
is a release form signed by the stu
dent that allows the school to
inform the parents if the student
does "anything which could be rea
sonably expected to cause injury to
him or herself or to others," or if
the student is suspended, hospital
ized or put on probation.
If the student does not sign the
form, then the parents at least
know they will not be notified and
"will know to find other mecha
nisms to establish contact," Mr.
Lichstein said in the letter.

Family Policy Compliance Office

would be acceptable as long as it
details exactly which information

And while this philosophy raises few
eyebrows when applied to bills and
grades, the real question is what happens
in more serious cases, such as alcohol
abuse or disciplinary problems. Should
parents be notified in these scenarios?
According to Jackson, the answer is usu
ally no.
But Janine and Henry Lichstein —
whose son, Daniel, committed suicide this
fall — disagree. In his suicide note,
Daniel, a junior, referred to his alcohol
dependency — a problem known to the
University but not to his parents.
"If we had known about Daniel's prob
lems, we could have helped him," Mr. Lich
stein said in an interview. "Stanford is
clearly on the wrong end of the spectrum
on the issue of parental notification."

Stanford's belief is that
students should be
treated as adults.

Though there is "no blanket rule of
thumb," Jackson said University policy is
to "deal with students as adults" — mean
ing students are sent grades and bills. It is
then the students' responsibility to commu
nicate that information to their parents.
"As a rule, we generally do not notify
parents," Jackson said. "But it really
depends on the situation — it is on a case
by-case basis."
And it is only in rare cases that the
University deems it appropriate to notify
parents. Even cases of suspension and
expulsion will not result in a parent being
contacted, said Diana Conklin, associate
director of residential education.
Conklin said she encourages students
to communicate with their parents, but
leaves the actual action up to the
student.
When students are known to
have a problem, they are asked to
check in with the deans, according
to Jackson. "But after a certain
period of time, we trust the stu
dent's judgment," and do not check
up on them anymore, he said.
Stanford, like all post-sec
ondary institutions, must follow
the Buckley Amendment, a feder
al law that defines the restrictions
on parents' access to the stu
dent's education record.
Conklin said she has gotten
numerous complaints from par
ents about Stanford's policy,
including surprise that bills and
grades are not sent home.
However, grades and bills are
not the real problem. Jackson said
parents have the most difficulty
understanding the University's
reticence when a student gets into
trouble.
'We were not informed'
Alice Bender, residence dean of
Toyon and several other dorms,
said the decision to contact par
ents is a "judgment call" made by
the residence dean — alone or in
conjunction with Jackson. Bender
said that in her year here, she has
not yet called any parents.
And the call that was not made
to the parents of Daniel Lichstein
is what has his parents so upset.
Lichstein was found dead in his
Toyon Hall room on November 9,
an apparent suicide.
His parents said they had no
knowledge of their son's alcohol
problem or of the fact that the
University had placed him on pro
bation for an alcohol-related inci
dent his freshman year.
An unsigned note found in his
room after his death read, "I am an
alcoholic, but I could not withdraw."

Toyon Resident Fellow James
Fox said students told him that
Daniel Lichstein "didn't drink
very frequently, but when he did
he got out of control" and acted in
ways that made other students
uncomfortable.
In a letter they circulated
among their friends and sent to
Jackson, the Lichsteins expressed
concern that they were never told
about their son's problems.
"Most of our friends were as sur
prised as we were that we were told
nothing about what happened," the
letter says. "Few of us realize how
completely we (parents) are cut off
from what happens when our chil
dren are at school."
The Lichsteins said they could
have helped their son had they
known of his problems. "We were
not informed, and we were not
involved in the response to a prob
lem known by Stanford but not by
us," they say in the letter.
"To Stanford, Daniel 'appeared
on the radar screen, then disap
peared' in his freshman year," the
letter continues. "Unfortunately,
Daniel did not resolve his problem,
could not withstand the pain it
caused him, and is dead as a result."
"If we had known, we would
have been involved," Mr. Lich
stein said in an interview. "But
that's the disadvantage of being
3,000 miles away."
However, some students
believe they should be treated as
adults, and don't think parents
should be notified about their
problems. One freshman, who has
hospitalized for alcohol poisoning
earlier this year, said he was glad
his parents were not told of his
hospital stay.
His parents found out about it
eventually, because of the hospi
tal bill, but "It worked out better
that way," he said. "I called them
and talked about it with them
later."
But other parents — such as
Happy Dumas, president of the
Mother's Club at Stanford — sup

port the Lichsteins.
"Parents should be notified —
particularly if there's a drug or
alcohol problem," Dumas said,
adding that parents could help
the most in situations like these.
"Even if you're 50, you need help.
We all need help."
Releasing the information
If parents won't be notified
about their child's problems, they
should at least know that they
won't be told, the Lichsteins argue.
"The rules of the school should
be known to students and par
ents," Mr. Lichstein said, adding
that Stanford's policy is not clear
ly stated in the various student
handbooks. "Parents should real
ize that they are going to be told
nothing."
Jackson said the policy of not
notifying parents about students'
problems is "a natural outgrowth
of the policy on bills and grades. It
isn't written anywhere explicitly."
"If it turns out it would be
more helpful if it were (written
out explicitly), that may be a valid
criticism," he said.
One option Lichstein suggested
is a release form signed by the stu
dent that allows the school to
inform the parents if the student
does "anything which could be rea
sonably expected to cause injury to
him or herself or to others," or if
the student is suspended, hospital
ized or put on probation.
If the student does not sign the
form, then the parents at least
know they will not be notified and
"will know to find other mecha
nisms to establish contact," Mr.
Lichstein said in the letter.
Lee Rooker, director of the
Family Policy Compliance Office
in Washington D.C. — which
administers the Buckley Amend
ment — said such a consent form
would be acceptable as long as it
details exactly which information
can be released.
Jackson declined to comment
specifically on the Lichstein case,

but said he and the Lichsteins
have talked, and he foresees no
changes in policy as a result of the
exchange.
"What they've done for me is
heighten my awareness of the
concerns of parents," Jackson
said. "I have discussed this with
the residence deans and we will
always keep the parents' concerns
in mind."
Defining rights of access
The Buckley Amendment,
known officially as the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy
Act, lays out the rights of stu
dents and parents in accessing a
student's education record.
Rooker said that in general, the
1974 amendment to the General
Education Provisions Act defines
an education record as anything
"personally definable and main
tained by the university."
According to the document itself,
the rights to the education record
belong to the parents until the stu
dent becomes "eligible" — that is,
until the student turns 18 or enters
a postsecondary institution.
At that point, "anyone who
wants access to a student's
records must have the student's
written permission — even par
ents," Rooker said.
However, there is an exception.
Rooker said if the student is a
dependent of his or her parents —
that is, if the student is listed as a
dependent on the parents' tax
form for the Internal Revenue
Service — the parents do not need
the student's permission to see
the records.
Just paying a student's tuition
is not enough to qualify the stu
dent as a dependent, though,
according to Rooker. "The par
ents must be the majority
providers in all ways," he said.
If a student is a dependent, the
university can release any infor
mation to his or her parents, even
if the student specifically asks the
university not to, Rooker said. It

is not required that the university
release the records, though. "It's
up to the university," he said.
'A hollow stick*
As a private university, Stan
ford can choose not to abide by
the Buckley Amendment. Howev
er, it risks losing Department of
Education funds — which include
research grants — if it does not
comply, according to Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole.
However, Rooker said, "There
aren't any schools that would risk
losing [funding] over FERPA (the
Buckley Amendment)." He added
that in the 18 years the amend
ment has been in effect, his office
has not yet taken funding away
from any university.
There is "sufficient latitude"
within the amendment for uni
versities to have very different
policies, said Sheldon Steinbach,
the general counsel for the Amer
ican Council on Education.
"Generally, most schools do
not disclose health or disciplinary
matters to parents," Steinbach
said. "But there are schools that
do notify parents as part of the
disciplinary procedure. The stu
dents are required to call their
parents themselves as part of the
procedure."
Those schools that do this "are
probably violating the intent of
Buckley, but the termination of
all Department of Education
funds has not happened in all 18
years, and it's not likely to occur,"
he said. "[Buckley] is a very hol
low stick."
'In loco parentis'
Stanford's approach to parental
notification, which is more confi
dential than some other schools,
actually pre-dates the Buckley
Amendment by several years,
according to Conklin.
Conklin said the current policy
was an extension of the general
movement in the late '60s and
early '70s toward individual pri

vacy and responsibility. She
added that she hoped Stanford
would not go back to the previous
policy of "in loco parentis" — by
which the University acted as a
surrogate parent to students.
UC-Berkeley follows a policy
similar to Stanford's. "For the
most part, we don't notify the
parents — not even in the case of
suspension and expulsion," said
Berkeley Dean of Student Life
Francisco Hernandez.
Parents will only be notified if
there is "a great urgency, such as
death or impending death," Her
nandez said.
Some other private and inde
pendent colleges take more liberty
with the Buckley Amendment
than Stanford does. According to
Cris Roosenraad, the Dean of Stu
dents at Carleton College, Car
leton's policy tries to balance stu
dent privacy with parental notifi
cation.
"We don't notify parents rou
tinely," he said, "only in cases of
jeopardy to health, academic jeop
ardy or disciplinary jeopardy." If a
student were suspended or
expelled, the parents would always
be notified, Roosenraad said.
In any situation that led to judi
cial action — even if the student
were caught cheating — Carleton
parents would be told, he said.
Conklin said that in her years
as director of the residence deans,
from 1985 until last September,
she only called the parents of two
students.
In one case, the student had
been hospitalized with a .4 blood
alcohol count. Conklin said the
University had already been
working with the student — who
had a "pattern of drinking" — for
a year, and that all Stanford
resources, including Counseling
and Psychological Services, had
not been able to "effect a change."
In that instance, she said, she
believed calling the students' par
ents was justifiable. "We had run
out of alternatives," Conklin said.
During Freshman Orientation, parents
are advised to "butt out," Hoover Institu
tion fellow Thomas Sowell wrote in a
recent edition of Forbes magazine.
That advice is based on Stanford's
belief that "students should be treated as
adults," said Dean of Students Michael
Jackson.
And while this philosophy raises few
eyebrows when applied to bills and
grades, the real question is what happens
in more serious cases, such as alcohol
abuse or disciplinary problems. Should

"will know to find other mecha
nisms to establish contact," Mr.
Lichstein said in the letter.
Lee Rooker, director of the
Family Policy Compliance Office
in Washington D.C. — which
administers the Buckley Amend
ment — said such a consent form
would be acceptable as long as it
details exactly which information
can be released.
Jackson declined to comment
specifically on the Lichstein case,

but said he and the Lichsteins
have talked, and he foresees no
changes in policy as a result of the
exchange.
"What they've done for me is
heighten my awareness of the
concerns of parents," Jackson
said. "I have discussed this with
the residence deans and we will
always keep the parents' concerns
in mind."
Defining rights of access
The Buckley Amendment,
known officially as the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy
Act, lays out the rights of stu
dents and parents in accessing a
student's education record.
Rooker said that in general, the
1974 amendment to the General
Education Provisions Act defines
an education record as anything
"personally definable and main
tained by the university."
According to the document itself,
the rights to the education record
belong to the parents until the stu
dent becomes "eligible" — that is,
until the student turns 18 or enters
a postsecondary institution.
At that point, "anyone who
wants access to a student's
records must have the student's
written permission — even par
ents," Rooker said.
However, there is an exception.
Rooker said if the student is a
dependent of his or her parents —
that is, if the student is listed as a
dependent on the parents' tax
form for the Internal Revenue
Service — the parents do not need
the student's permission to see
the records.
Just paying a student's tuition
is not enough to qualify the stu
dent as a dependent, though,
according to Rooker. "The par
ents must be the majority
providers in all ways," he said.
If a student is a dependent, the
university can release any infor
mation to his or her parents, even
if the student specifically asks the
university not to, Rooker said. It

is not required that the university
release the records, though. "It's
up to the university," he said.
'A hollow stick*
As a private university, Stan
ford can choose not to abide by
the Buckley Amendment. Howev
er, it risks losing Department of
Education funds — which include
research grants — if it does not
comply, according to Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole.
However, Rooker said, "There
aren't any schools that would risk
losing [funding] over FERPA (the
Buckley Amendment)." He added
that in the 18 years the amend
ment has been in effect, his office
has not yet taken funding away
from any university.
There is "sufficient latitude"
within the amendment for uni
versities to have very different
policies, said Sheldon Steinbach,
the general counsel for the Amer
ican Council on Education.
"Generally, most schools do
not disclose health or disciplinary
matters to parents," Steinbach
said. "But there are schools that
do notify parents as part of the
disciplinary procedure. The stu
dents are required to call their
parents themselves as part of the
procedure."
Those schools that do this "are
probably violating the intent of
Buckley, but the termination of
all Department of Education
funds has not happened in all 18
years, and it's not likely to occur,"
he said. "[Buckley] is a very hol
low stick."
'In loco parentis'
Stanford's approach to parental
notification, which is more confi
dential than some other schools,
actually pre-dates the Buckley
Amendment by several years,
according to Conklin.
Conklin said the current policy
was an extension of the general
movement in the late '60s and
early '70s toward individual pri

vacy and responsibility. She
added that she hoped Stanford
would not go back to the previous
policy of "in loco parentis" — by
which the University acted as a
surrogate parent to students.
UC-Berkeley follows a policy
similar to Stanford's. "For the
most part, we don't notify the
parents — not even in the case of
suspension and expulsion," said
Berkeley Dean of Student Life
Francisco Hernandez.
Parents will only be notified if
there is "a great urgency, such as
death or impending death," Her
nandez said.
Some other private and inde
pendent colleges take more liberty
with the Buckley Amendment
than Stanford does. According to
Cris Roosenraad, the Dean of Stu
dents at Carleton College, Car
leton's policy tries to balance stu
dent privacy with parental notifi
cation.
"We don't notify parents rou
tinely," he said, "only in cases of
jeopardy to health, academic jeop
ardy or disciplinary jeopardy." If a
student were suspended or
expelled, the parents would always
be notified, Roosenraad said.
In any situation that led to judi
cial action — even if the student
were caught cheating — Carleton
parents would be told, he said.
Conklin said that in her years
as director of the residence deans,
from 1985 until last September,
she only called the parents of two
students.
In one case, the student had
been hospitalized with a .4 blood
alcohol count. Conklin said the
University had already been
working with the student — who
had a "pattern of drinking" — for
a year, and that all Stanford
resources, including Counseling
and Psychological Services, had
not been able to "effect a change."
In that instance, she said, she
believed calling the students' par
ents was justifiable. "We had run
out of alternatives," Conklin said.
