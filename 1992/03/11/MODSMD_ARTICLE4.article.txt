## 'If we had known, we could have helped him' Parents of student suicide victim contest Stanford's policy on parental notification 
### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
During Freshman Orientation, parents
are advised to "butt out," Hoover Institu
tion fellow Thomas Sowell wrote in a
recent edition of Forbes magazine.
That advice is based on Stanford's
belief that "students should be treated as
adults," said Dean of Students Michael
Jackson.
And while this philosophy raises few
eyebrows when applied to bills and
grades, the real question is what happens
in more serious cases, such as alcohol
abuse or disciplinary problems. Should
parents be notified in these scenarios?

But Janine and Henry Lichstein —
whose son, Daniel, committed suicide this
fall — disagree. In his suicide note,
Daniel, a junior, referred to his alcohol

"If we had known about Daniel's prob

students should be
treated as adults.

Though there is "no blanket rule of
thumb," Jackson said University policy is

depends on the situation — it is on a case
by-case basis."
And it is only in rare cases that the
University deems it appropriate to notify
parents. Even cases of suspension and
expulsion will not result in a parent being
contacted, said Diana Conklin, associate
director of residential education.
Conklin said she encourages students
to communicate with their parents, but
