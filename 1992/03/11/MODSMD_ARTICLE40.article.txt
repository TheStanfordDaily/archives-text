# OSU crushed 103-68
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
Stanford's women's basket
ball team started Saturday's
game against Oregon State
looking hungrier than an alli
gator in a beaver dam. It came
away from the feast with the
tastes of sweet revenge and
shredded Beavers in its mouth,
as it mauled them in a 103-68
feeding frenzy.
Stanford clinched at least a
share of the team's fourth con
secutive Pacific 10 Conference
title. It also avenged its previ
ous two games against Oregon
State, a pair of losses by a total
of 32 points.
The game showed that Stan
ford has turned what were its
two biggest weaknesses into
strengths. One of those weak
nesses, which plagued the Cardi
nal all year and keyed upsets to
both Oregon State and Arizona
State, was an inability to break
the full-court press.
Saturday night Stanford
cut through the press like a
lightning bolt through the
air, striking for 31 points in
the first nine minutes, before
the Beavers got back under
the shelter of the half-court
line.
The other weakness, which
concerned coach Tara Van-
Derveer the most, was a lack of
a firey desire to win. But as Sat
urday's series of emphatic fist
pumpings and bone-shattering
high-fives showed, the Cardi
nal has rediscovered a killer
instinct that it had seemingly
lost after the Tennessee game
on Dec. 14.
After the slaughter, Van-
Derveer looked ahead to Fri
day's regular season finale with
California, another team that
handed Stanford a loss earlier
this year.
"We'll have a couple of sur
prises for them," VanDerveer

said. "The best thing would be
to have Maples full. It would
really be a message to Cal that
we have the fans and the sup
port over here.
"I've heard that a lot of [Cal
fans] have called the ticket
office," she added. "And I
would hate to see a lot of blue
out there."
So far, over 6,000 tickets
have been sold for the game,
which begins at 7:30 p.m. Fri
day night. Even though as
many as several hundred Wee
nies could show up, the game
has a chance to be the first reg
ular season women's basketball
game to sell out at Stanford.
Maples Pavilion has a seating
capacity of 7,500.
The Cardinal may also get a
boost from the twin powers
known as Fate and the NCAA
Selection Committee. In one
interesting development, Wash
ington appears to be on the
bubble for even making the 48-
team tournament field.
The Huskies are 16-10, 8-8
and in sixth place in the Pac
-10. It is expected that the
NCAA will take five teams
from the Pac-10 this year. No
more than four have ever been
invited in the past.
If the Huskies do not make
the tournament, Stanford will
not have to worry about
encountering 8,000 howling,
rabid Dawg fans.
In addition, both then-No.
3 Mississippi and then-No. 4
Maryland lost early-round
games in their respective
conference tournaments to
unranked teams. They are
now ranked No. 5 and No. 8,
respectively. Stanford moved
from No. 6 to No. 3, and now
controls its own destiny as to
its NCAA seeding.
The entire 48-team bracket
will be announced on Mar. 15
on ESPN at 9:30 a.m. in a half
hour show.
