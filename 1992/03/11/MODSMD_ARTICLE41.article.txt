# STANFORD CATCHES TOURNEY FEVER
## Card men gain credibility in losing effort 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
* TUCSON — Stanford showed Sat
urday it is one of the top 64 teams in
• the nation, but the Cardinal will have
to sweep Oregon and Oregon State at
home to prove it.
There were no doubters in Arizona
after Stanford (16-10, 8-8) nearly
knocked off the fourth-ranked Wildcats,
♦ 89-83. Senior guard Matt Othick drained
two 3-pointers in the final three minutes
1 to halt a fierce Stanford comeback.
I "We can be real proud with the way
we played. This was a great accom
plishment for us," said battered senior
Adam Keefe. "It says to the guys that
we can play on any level."
Trailing 62-48 in the meanest gym
in the Pacific 10 Conference, Stanford
could have easily followed historical
: precedent. Arizona (24-4, 12-3) had
won its last seven games at the
McKale Center by an average of 31
- points and destroyed the Cardinal last
year 89-51. Besides Pac-10-leading
I UCLA, no other team had come closer
: than 22 points in McKale.
» But with a career-best game from
- sophomore Brent Williams (22 points)
* and tireless toil from Keefe (27 points,
;10 rebounds, 5 assists), Stanford
caught the Wildcats at 78-78 with 3
- minutes and 20 seconds left.

It took two Othick rainmakers — the
second from 24 feet — and four straight
free throws for Arizona to avert the
upset. Plus, Stanford sophomore
Kenny Hicks missed the front end of a
one-and-one with 31 seconds left that
could have tied the game at 85-85.
"I can't really find too much to
fault my team today. I thought they
played hard," said Stanford coach
Mike Montgomery. "This is an awful
ly tough place to play and I thought we
played them a heck of a ballgame."
In the first half, Arizona was shoot
ing 58 percent from the field and
attacking the offensive boards, so
Stanford shifted to a zone in the sec
ond half.
"We were killing them on the man
to-man," said Arizona coach Lute
Olson. "Anyone coming in here and
zoning is making a big-time gamble.
In most cases we shoot teams out of it
easily."
The zone worked and Williams
capped a gradual comeback with an
18-foot jumper over Chris Mills that
tied the game.
"Despite losing to Arizona, there
were many positive things there," said
Montgomery. "We played well under
some extremely adverse circum
stances, never lost our poise, battled
back and put ourselves in a position to
win. Despite the fact we didn't win,

this will give us some confidence."

NCAA Notes
With a sweep of Oregon and Oregon
State, Stanford expects an NCAA Tourna
ment bid, but the Cardinal postseason fate
partly hinges on what transpires in Los
Angeles this weekend.
While the men's basketball team battles
for fourth place in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, it hopes Arizona State will be swept
by second-place USC Thursday and first
place UCLA Saturday. The Sun Devils (18-
11, 9-7) lost to both teams at home, but can

clinch at least a tie for fourth with Stan
ford by splitting on the road.
"They (USC and UCLA) have given us
four of our losses and I expect they'll have
trouble," said Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery. "We just have to do our job. You
can't control what you can't control."
If Stanford wins both games, it can fin
ish no worse than alone in fifth place. If
ASU is swept on the road, the Cardinal
would leapfrog into fourth and would be a
shoe-in for a Tournament berth.
"There are three teams above them in
the top 10 in the country. This has been
the rationale by the Big East and ACC the
past few years," said Arizona coach Lute
Olson. "If they're 10-8 there's no question
in my mind they'll make the NCAA Tour
nament."
Should the Cardinal lose one, however,
all NCAA bets are off. Both Washington
State and Oregon State could catch Stan
ford for an ugly fifth place tie, and then any
thing could happen.
The NCAA Tournament invitations —
30 automatic qualifiers and 34 at-large
teams — will be announced Sunday after
noon, with first-round games starting
Thursday, March 19.
Meanwhile, the Pac-10 title will be
decided between UCLA, USC and Arizona
this weekend. Trailing first-place UCLA by
one game and tied with USC, Arizona will
play at both schools with a shot at the out
right title.
