# Reserves provide big defensive spark
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
At the beginning of the season, the NCAA
Tournament seemed a hopeful dream for a
young Cardinal squad anchored by All-Ameri
ca Adam Keefe. Aside from Kenny Hicks and
Jim Morgan, the bench loomed as a real ques
tion mark. Yet two freshmen, David Harbour
and Andy Poppink, along with Hicks and Mor
gan, have given Stanford solid depth off of the
bench, and have provided coach Mike Mont
gomery with an added luxury: being able to go
nine-men deep in his player rotation.
"We've got great confidence in the guys
coming off the bench," Montgomery said. "Its
tough when you're trying to have young kids
win for you, but we go eight or nine deep pret
ty much every game with good results. We
don't have the guy who comes in and gets 23
(points), but the keys that come in play good
defense and have good intensity."
Though the Cardinal does not have the
reserve scorer that Montgomery alluded to,
the reserves provide the intangibles that help
teams win bailgames.
Harbour and Poppink, though only fresh
men, have developed quickly and have seen
significant action. Poppink has appeared in all

26 of the Cardinal's games, while Harbour has
played in 20. Both realize that their duty is not
so much as to score, but to give the team a
spark while providing the starters with rest.
"I'm happy that we've found our niche —
defensive hustle," Poppink said. "Our job is to
fire up the other guys and get them going."
Poppink has seen a lot of minutes at the
small forward spot, spelling sophomore Brent
Williams. The Tecumseh, Mich., native is
especially noted for his defensive skills, and
saw significant action against Washington two
weeks ago in Maples, playing 17 minutes.
"He gets up and down the floor, and has made
a nice transition (from high school) to the type of
athletes we play against," Montgomery said.
Harbour, who hails from Camarillo, Calif.,
fills in at the off-guard for Peter Dukes, and is
noted for his determination on the court.
"David is fearless, nothing bothers him,"
Montgomery said. "They (Harbour and Pop
pink) give us some hard-nosed play, aggres
siveness, and toughness."
Both members of the tandem thrive on
competition, and like playing in noisy arenas,
which is what they will encounter if the Cardi
nal is selected for March Madness.
What makes this year's group of reserves
stand out is unity, all the players supporting

each other to create a true team atmosphere.
"They really get things going with their
enthusiasm, and we (the starters) kind of feed
off that," Keefe said.
"There's a great attitude on the bench,"
Montgomery commented. "The guys are fired
up, helping others, giving us a lift. Unlike oth
ers, this group stays focused, trying to help us
win, and always keeping a positive attitude.
There's no jealousy or animosity on this team."
Harbour and Poppink both emphasize the
team concept, putting the team's success
ahead of their own personal goals.
"Obviously, any player would like to play
more, but our team is doing well, and I'm just
pleased with the success of our team," Har
bour said.
The question remains, however, about
what will happen next year when Keefe is in
the NBA. Keefe feels that these two have what
it takes to help fill the void.
"This year the guys on the team aren't
putting any pressure on them to push to the
limit because they're freshmen, and there's kind
of an unspoken rule not to do that," Keefe said.
"But next year, they will be expected to step up."
For now though, Harbour and Poppink are
getting used to the basketball system on the
Farm, and are doing an admirable job.
