# Keefe says goodbye once again
## Stanford's premier big man plays last home game 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
California cool Adam Keefe might not be crying
Saturday after his last game at Maples Pavilion, but
that's because he's played the last game before.
The senior all-everything considered jumping to
the NBA last season, but passed on a million dollar pro
contract to stay on the Farm one more year. Since he
had to think about the significance of leaving last
spring, Keefe has had one whole season to be nostalgic.
"The best decision of my life was to come to Stan
ford, and the second best was to decide to stay for a
fourth year," said Keefe, who Monday was named a
Second Team Ail-American by Basketball Weekly.
"It's gone very well."
Keefe's initial swan song was the 1991 home
finale against Houston and it could have been his
last. After averaging 21.5 points and 9.5 rebounds
per game and taking his team to the NIT title, Keefe
had some rich chips to cash in the NBA.
The rest of the starting lineup, including friend
and basketball bodyguard Andrew Vlahov, was head
ing out into the real world and Keefe felt the itch to
escape. His senior year promised needless bruises at
slave pay and a supporting cast of unproven young
sters.
But Keefe, more for social and academic than for
athletic reasons, passed on the draft. His second —
and he promises final — swan song will be Saturday
at 5 p.m. when Stanford battles Oregon State at
Maples Pavilion. Admission is free with Stanford I.D.
"I thought it would be a lot rougher than this. I'm
still taking a pretty good pounding, but it's gone
really well," Keefe said. "School has gone real well
and I've had a lot more time to step back and enjoy
myself. Last year there were games I would go out
there and play because I had to."
Even though it may have cost him a million dollars,
Keefe stayed his senior year to experience the Stanford
he wasn't getting on the basketball court. Keefe real
ized he could never return to the fun of college.
"I'm going to go out on the back deck of the house
and relax, play some sand volleyball and work on my
tan. I'm expecting a little bit of a slowdown. It's
going to be a nice situation," said Keefe, who will
graduate in June with an A.B. in political science.
However, Keefe's sleepy dreams of spring betray
his intensity on the basketball court and his desire
to return to the NCAA Tournament.
As a 6-foot-9, 215-pound freshman from Irvine,
Calif., Keefe was the sixth man on Stanford's best
team since 1942. With Keefe as pupil and Todd Lichti,
Howard Wright and Eric Rcveno as teachers, Stan
ford went 26-7 and reached the NCAA Tournament.
"I really owe a lot to those guys. Most of it was
showing me — not in direct ways — how important
it was to work hard. Most of those guys were consid
ered overachievers," he said.
In a first-round loss to Siena, Keefe began to
implement his learning, scoring 22 points. Since

Lichti's graduation to the NBA, Keefe has been the
heart and hope of the Stanford program, setting sin
gle-season records in points and rebounds.
Over the course of his four year career, Keefe has
engraved his name in the Stanford and Pac-10
record books. With 1,090 career rebounds, he has
already passed Kimberly Belton as Stanford's top
rebounder. With 661 points, he needs 49 more to
break his own Stanford single-season record and 90
to pass Lichti as the top Cardinal career scorer.
With Keefe as leading scorer and All-Conference
selection, Stanford reached the NIT the past two sea
sons, but he wants one more shot at March Madness.
"I don't want to go back to the NIT. My only goal is
to get back to the NCAA Tournament. That would be
the nicest thing anybody could do for me besides giv
ing me my diploma," said Keefe, ranking the NIT as a
great experience, but preferably once in a lifetime.
Besides having more fun this year, Keefe has
improved his numbers (25.4 points, 12.5 rebounds, 1.8
steals per game), gotten stronger (230 pounds) and
emerged as a team leader. It is his ability to work with
the players around him that has catapulted surprising
Stanford toward an NCAA Tournament berth.
"He's stronger, more mature and more confident.
I think it has been a nice development. What Adam
has accomplished is a hell of a story," said Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery, who will miss Keefe as
much as anyone. "Everybody who is involved in
Stanford athletics has to feel pretty good because
we've got guys like Keefe in the program."
Keefe is nominated for numerous national awards
and will be a certain first round draft pick. While he
is ready to move on in basketball, he is glad he stayed
for a final Stanford spring and his favorite things:
"Spring time or early fall, when everyone is going to
class in shorts and thongs. Working hard. Having good
friends. The green foothills, with the volleyball or bas
ketball game going on. The loud music playing, with
the guys getting ready to go out and have a good time."
Don't expect Keefe to get emotional about his
final home game. After all, he's already played in
one. But one of Stanford's greatest basketball play
ers is happy he stayed for a final year on the Farm.

Adam Keefe attempts one of his 219 1991-92 free throws. Keefe has redefined the word 'ironman', aver
aging an unheard-of 37 minutes per game this season.
California cool Adam Keefe might not be crying
Saturday after his last game at Maples Pavilion, but
that's because he's played the last game before.
The senior all-everything considered jumping to
the NBA last season, but passed on a million dollar pro
contract to stay on the Farm one more year. Since he
had to think about the significance of leaving last
spring, Keefe has had one whole season to be nostalgic.
"The best decision of my life was to come to Stan
ford, and the second best was to decide to stay for a
fourth year," said Keefe, who Monday was named a
Second Team Ail-American by Basketball Weekly.
"It's gone very well."
Keefe's initial swan song was the 1991 home
finale against Houston and it could have been his
last. After averaging 21.5 points and 9.5 rebounds
per game and taking his team to the NIT title, Keefe
had some rich chips to cash in the NBA.
The rest of the starting lineup, including friend
and basketball bodyguard Andrew Vlahov, was head
ing out into the real world and Keefe felt the itch to
escape. His senior year promised needless bruises at
slave pay and a supporting cast of unproven young
sters.
But Keefe, more for social and academic than for
athletic reasons, passed on the draft. His second —
and he promises final — swan song will be Saturday
at 5 p.m. when Stanford battles Oregon State at
Maples Pavilion. Admission is free with Stanford I.D.
"I thought it would be a lot rougher than this. I'm
still taking a pretty good pounding, but it's gone
really well," Keefe said. "School has gone real well
and I've had a lot more time to step back and enjoy
myself. Last year there were games I would go out
there and play because I had to."
Even though it may have cost him a million dollars,
Keefe stayed his senior year to experience the Stanford
he wasn't getting on the basketball court. Keefe real
ized he could never return to the fun of college.
"I'm going to go out on the back deck of the house
and relax, play some sand volleyball and work on my
tan. I'm expecting a little bit of a slowdown. It's
going to be a nice situation," said Keefe, who will
graduate in June with an A.B. in political science.
However, Keefe's sleepy dreams of spring betray
his intensity on the basketball court and his desire
to return to the NCAA Tournament.
As a 6-foot-9, 215-pound freshman from Irvine,
Calif., Keefe was the sixth man on Stanford's best
team since 1942. With Keefe as pupil and Todd Lichti,
Howard Wright and Eric Rcveno as teachers, Stan
ford went 26-7 and reached the NCAA Tournament.
"I really owe a lot to those guys. Most of it was
showing me — not in direct ways — how important
it was to work hard. Most of those guys were consid
ered overachievers," he said.
In a first-round loss to Siena, Keefe began to
implement his learning, scoring 22 points. Since

Lichti's graduation to the NBA, Keefe has been the
heart and hope of the Stanford program, setting sin
gle-season records in points and rebounds.
Over the course of his four year career, Keefe has
engraved his name in the Stanford and Pac-10
record books. With 1,090 career rebounds, he has
already passed Kimberly Belton as Stanford's top
rebounder. With 661 points, he needs 49 more to
break his own Stanford single-season record and 90
to pass Lichti as the top Cardinal career scorer.
With Keefe as leading scorer and All-Conference
selection, Stanford reached the NIT the past two sea
sons, but he wants one more shot at March Madness.
"I don't want to go back to the NIT. My only goal is
to get back to the NCAA Tournament. That would be
the nicest thing anybody could do for me besides giv
ing me my diploma," said Keefe, ranking the NIT as a
great experience, but preferably once in a lifetime.
Besides having more fun this year, Keefe has
improved his numbers (25.4 points, 12.5 rebounds, 1.8
steals per game), gotten stronger (230 pounds) and
emerged as a team leader. It is his ability to work with
the players around him that has catapulted surprising
Stanford toward an NCAA Tournament berth.
"He's stronger, more mature and more confident.
I think it has been a nice development. What Adam
has accomplished is a hell of a story," said Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery, who will miss Keefe as
much as anyone. "Everybody who is involved in
Stanford athletics has to feel pretty good because
we've got guys like Keefe in the program."
Keefe is nominated for numerous national awards
and will be a certain first round draft pick. While he
is ready to move on in basketball, he is glad he stayed
for a final Stanford spring and his favorite things:
"Spring time or early fall, when everyone is going to
class in shorts and thongs. Working hard. Having good
friends. The green foothills, with the volleyball or bas
ketball game going on. The loud music playing, with
the guys getting ready to go out and have a good time."
Don't expect Keefe to get emotional about his
final home game. After all, he's already played in
one. But one of Stanford's greatest basketball play
ers is happy he stayed for a final year on the Farm.
