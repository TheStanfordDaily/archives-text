# Netters dominate Pacific Coast Doubles
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
It is safe to say that the No. 1-ranked men's
tennis team is not dominated by pairs of world
class doubles players. However, this weekend
at the 103 rd Pacific Coast Doubles Champi
onships, the Card added two more names to
the legendary/impressive list engraved on the
tournament's championship trophy.
Following in the footsteps of old teammates
Jon Stark and Jared Palmer, Alex O'Brien and
Chris Cocotos won the La Jolla tournament,
while teammates Jason Yee and Vimal Patel
reached the quarterfinals.
"This was a tremendous win," said head
coach Dick Gould. "It's really very, very
impressive. It's a real tribute to Alex and Chris
that they could do that well their first time."
The second-seeded duo cruised through
most of their matches in straight sets but were

pushed to three in the finals by Bay Area
rivals Tommy Phanco and Matt Lucena,
ranked third.
"We got better and better as the tourna
ment went on," O'Brien said. "We had a solid
match (in the finals). It wasn't easy but we
knew what we had to do to win and we did it."
This was the second time in less than two
weeks that the duo has defeated the Cal team.
The final match had a bit less pressure than
expected because the top seed, USC's Jonathan
Leach and Brian MacPhie, were eliminated in
the semis. The Trojan pair has defeated
O'Brien and Cocotos twice this season, so the
Cardinal men were hoping to seek revenge.
Meanwhile, Yee and Patel were busy win
ning their own matches, all three in straight
sets. "Jason played especially well this week
end," Gould said. "He might have been our
best player down there."
Losing a close three-setter to the team that

O'Brien and Cocotos defeated in the semis, the
Cardinal duo played very well. "It was a nice
achievement for them," Gould said.
Tenth-seeded Michael Flanagan and
Robert Devens suffered a disappointing loss in
the second round. "They lost one that they
should have won," Gould said. "But they'll
bounce back."
Devens had similar sentiments: "It was a
team we would've killed if we'd been playing
well."
With a home match against Brigham
Young and away matches at Arizona and Ari
zona State during spring break, the men will
be busy. Easing in to dual match play against
the Cougars, the team should be in fine form
to battle the altitude of Arizona and tough
competition at both schools.
"Both schools are better in singles than in
doubles I think," Cocotos said, "so it should be
a good challenge for us."
