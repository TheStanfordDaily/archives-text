The Stanford track and field team won
handily over San Francisco State and Sonoma
State in front of a relatively small crowd Sat
urday. No matter. In three weeks, Stanford
Stadium will harbor enough athletes to
declare itself a small city.
From March 26-28, the Stadium will host
approximately 3500 athletes from the ranks of
high school, college, and beyond, including
Butch Reynolds, the current world-record
holder in the 400-meter dash. The meet's high
light will be the two-hour nationally-televised
Pacific 10 Conference-Big 10 Conference chal
lenge on March 28. Athletes from eight Big-10
and five Pac-10 teams will be squaring off

against each other in a battle between two of
the premier athletic conferences in the nation.
"This is certainly the centerpiece of the sea
son," said Stanford Assistant Coach Scott
Chisam. "Usually, the bigger the meet is, the
more hassles there usually are. But here we
take pride in making this a free-flowing, fun
event. We have a tremendous group of officials
helping us out and compiling all the entries in
two weeks leading up to the Invite."
Two of Stanford's star athletes, Chryste
Gaines and Jackie Edwards, will first be travel
ling to Indianapolis next week to compete in the
NCAA Indoor Championships. Edwards was in
Laramie, Wyo. Saturday qualifying in both the
triple and long jump competitions. She placed
second nationally in the long jump last year.

Gaines, gunning for the national champi
onship in the 55 dash, turned in a first place fin
ish on Saturday in both the 100 and 200 sprints.
As for the San Francisco State-Sonoma
State meet, several Cardinal athletes turned
in outstanding individual performances.
The hammer throw team took first and sec
ond place behind Toby Norwood and Ramon
Alercon, both of whom set personal bests.
Norwood's throw of 194-feet-2-inches made
him an NCAA divisional qualifier.
In the discus, Pat Stowell threw a personal
best 177-0, although he had one throw of over 180
feet that was disallowed because of a foot fault
"I'd be a lot more thrilled if he had gotten
that 181," said men's throwing coach Jeff
Goldfried of Stowell's performance.
