# Spikers leap to No. 1
## 
### Laurie Wackier Staff writer 
With dead week just then
around the corner, Stanford's sec
ond-ranked volleyball was intent
to put the books aside and teach a
few lessons of their own last
weekend. The unfortunate pupils
of the Card spikers — San Diego
State and Loyola Marymount —
failed the test, each falling to
Stanford in three games.
The victories, along with a Cal
State-Northridge upset over No. 1
Long Beach State, leaves the Car
dinal alone atop the Western Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association.
At 11-1, Stanford boasts a slight
edge over previously undefeated
Long Beach (6-1).
At San Diego State Friday,
Stanford's offense made the
grade with nine service aces and a
.541 team kill percentage en route
to a 15-6, 15-4, 15-6 victory.
"We started fast and never
looked back," said head coach
Ruben Nieves of the easy victory.
"If we're the superior team, we

don't want to drag things out."
Ryan Moos helped keep the
match short and sweet, serving
three aces, and recording 10 kills.
At the net, John Bezmalinovic pun
ished the Aztecs on an astounding
.714 hitting percentage behind 11
kills Bezmalinovic is third in the
nation in hitting percentage.
"Bez is consistently hitting
very well," Nieves remarked.
"He's a good hitter surrounded by
good hitters. Opponents can't key
on him because there are too
many other weapons."
After a strong start against
host Loyola Marymount (0-10)
Saturday, the spikers faltered, let
ting the persistent Lions back into
the contest before escaping with a
victory in the third game to seal
the match(ls-5, 15-10, 15-13).
Although Nieves was disap
pointed that his squad did not fin
ish as strongly as they started, he
was pleased with their composure
under pressure. "A characteristic
of our team is that we find ways
to win when it comes down to the
wire," Nieves said.
