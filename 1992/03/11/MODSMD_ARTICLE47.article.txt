## 
### Larry Liu Staff writer 
For Mark Graham, Lance
Johnson, and Matt Topham,
the culmination of a grueling,
five-month season will take
place next week when the grap
plers travel to Oklahoma City
to compete in the NCAA
Championships. The tourna
ment will take place March 19-
21, when the Cardinal
entourage will face off against
the other top wrestlers in the
nation.
By virtue of last week's
solid, but slightly disappoint
ing, showing at the Pacific 10
Championships, the three Car
dinal wrestlers earned berths
to the NCAAs. The status of
sophomore Jay Jackson,
named first alternate, is still
on hold. Jackson will find out
Monday whether he will able to
compete next week or not.
Though qualifying three
wrestlers equals last year's
turnout, Graham, Johnson,
and Topham have their work
cut out for them if they hope to
duplicate Steve Buddie's and
Steve Yarbrough's top-12 per
formances.
Of the three, Topham is the
only returning NCAA partici
pant, having competed at 158

pounds in the 1991 Champi
onships. After wrestling most
of the season at 167 pounds,
Topham will return to the 158
pound weight class in hopes to
improve from last year's per
formance. The senior co-cap
tain has compiled an 18-8
record this season.
At 190 pounds and 142
pounds respectively, senior co
captain Mark Graham and
junior Lance Johnson will be
making their first appearance
at the NCAAs. Graham's pre
vious best Pac-10 finish was a
sixth place in 1990 while John
son placed fifth in last year's
Pac-lOs. But both wrestlers
have looked strong in their
matches this year; they nar
rowly missed making their
respective weight class finals
at the Pac-lOs by losing tough
matches in sudden death over
time. Graham has posted an
18-5 record while Johnson is
13-7.
According to head coach
Chris Horpel, the Cardinal trio
has a good shot to bring home
national honors.
Though Horpel is concerned
that the large crowds and
intense matches may faze the
wrestlers, he feels they have
the necessary elements to
make a strong showing.
