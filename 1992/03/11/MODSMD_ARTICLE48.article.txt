first place honors. The sabre team finished
second, as Stanford's Keith Hurley, Leonard
D'Amico, and Glenn Long finished 2-3-4 in
the event. The Cardinal finished third in
epee competition.

Audrey Wooding leads the Cardinal into
the competition after a ninth-place individu
al finish in the Arizona Intercollegiate late
in February. Wooding has been suffering
