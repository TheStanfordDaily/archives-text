The Hoover Institution has
struck a deal with the Russian Fed
eration to preserve on microfilm
the archives of the former Commu
nist Party of the Soviet Union.
According to Hoover Deputy
Director Charles Palm, an editori
al board of prominent interna
tional scholars will select docu
ments "relevant to modern Rus
sian history," from 1917's revolu
tion to 1991's failed coup, to be
put on microfilm.
History Prof. Terence Emmons
said the board members, who have
not yet been chosen, will face a dif
ficult task in selecting the docu
ments to be filmed. "But if the job
is done well," he added, "this will
be a sort of guide, a Magellan's
voyage through the archives."
Hoover will begin its joint

preservation project with Rosko
markhiv, the Committee on
Archival Affairs of the Russian
Federation, in April. The project
will take four to five years to com
plete, according to Palm. "It is the
only large microfilm project of
this sort," he said.
Hoover, which has one of the
largest collections of materials on
modern Russian history outside of
Russia, will help provide financial
support for the $3 million project
and will have access to the Rosko
markhiv archives. In exchange,
Hoover will provide microfilm
copies of their own Russian collec
tion to Roskomarkhiv.
"There is a defmite exchange
aspect" to the project, Emmons
said.
Palm said Hoover "had devel
oped good relations" with Dr.
