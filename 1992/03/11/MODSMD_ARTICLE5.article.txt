# Hoover wins deal for preservation of Soviet archives
## 
### Alain Dalva Staff writer 
The Hoover Institution has
struck a deal with the Russian Fed
eration to preserve on microfilm
the archives of the former Commu
nist Party of the Soviet Union.
According to Hoover Deputy
Director Charles Palm, an editori
al board of prominent interna
tional scholars will select docu
ments "relevant to modern Rus
sian history," from 1917's revolu
tion to 1991's failed coup, to be
put on microfilm.
History Prof. Terence Emmons
said the board members, who have
not yet been chosen, will face a dif
ficult task in selecting the docu
ments to be filmed. "But if the job
is done well," he added, "this will
be a sort of guide, a Magellan's
voyage through the archives."
Hoover will begin its joint

preservation project with Rosko
markhiv, the Committee on
Archival Affairs of the Russian
Federation, in April. The project
will take four to five years to com
plete, according to Palm. "It is the
only large microfilm project of
this sort," he said.
Hoover, which has one of the
largest collections of materials on
modern Russian history outside of
Russia, will help provide financial
support for the $3 million project
and will have access to the Rosko
markhiv archives. In exchange,
Hoover will provide microfilm
copies of their own Russian collec
tion to Roskomarkhiv.
"There is a defmite exchange
aspect" to the project, Emmons
said.
Palm said Hoover "had devel
oped good relations" with Dr.
Rudolph Pikhoia, chairman of
Roskomarkhiv. Pikhoia visited
Hoover last May and Hoover offi
cials met him again in February
"to develop together" the preser
vation project, Palm said.
Transferring the archives to
microfilm will make them more
available to scholars for research,
Palm said.
Roskomarkhiv, Hoover and the

International Committee of Schol
arly Advisers will select and publish
the microfilms of greatest interest
to scholars. Copies will go to the
U.S. Library of Congress and the
Russian National Library, accord
ing to Emmons.
The Russian archives were
opened March 1. According to
Emmons the main goal of the pro
ject is "to preserve them and make
them even more accessible," he said.
Emmons said he thinks the
board selection process will evolve
along themes such as the internal
control of the Communist party in

Russia, its ideological functions, its
policy regarding to Soviet culture
and its role in the Soviet economy.

For the record

An article in last Monday's
Daily headlined "Women's cele
bration focuses on leaders" had
an inaccurate byline. The article
itself was accurate and fair.
All responsibility for The
Daily's editorial decisions rests
with the editor in chief.
