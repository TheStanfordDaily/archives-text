# Sleep jerks are normal
## People twitch before dozing off, Bug says 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
night when my
W • boyfriend and I go to bed, he
jerns and twitches on and off for
about an hour before falling asleep.
I haven't said anything about it to
him yet, but I'm concerned. Also it
keeps me awake and it's kind of
weird. Is this normal ?
— Tossing and Turning
A .When I picked up your ques
• tion and read the first clause, I
actually got my hopes up. I thought
you were going to ask me for sexual
advice. Something about compara
tive genital anatomy, maybe. But
nooo — instead, you had to ask
about twitching.
Let me ask you a question: Is
that all that ever happens when you
two go to bed, or is there more to
your nightlife than a few involun
tary muscle spasms? Where do you
go to school, anyway? Stanford?
The medical term for any brief,
shocklike muscle contraction is
myoclonus. The word itself is derived
from Greek roots meaning "muscle
agitation," and its usage is fairly
broad: A facial tic is a myoclonus, but
so is a spasm powerful enough to
throw the victim to the ground.
Although myoclonus typically has
a fairly inoffensive cause, it is some
times indicative of profound or even
life-threatening pathology. For
example, myoclonus is often a sequel
to diffuse cerebral anoxia, the loss or
impairment of oxygen supply to the
brain that might occur after, say, a
botched strangulation attempt.
Myoclonus also characterizes
many progressive neural disorders
associated with extensive degenera
tion of brain tissue.
If, however, your main squeeze
hasn't been drooling, muttering and
wetting himself a lot recently — and
you haven't been trying to add spice
to your sex life by throttling him at
the moment of climax — then we'll
have to turn away from the esoteric
and satisfy ourselves with a more
mundane explanation.
Your boyfriend's twitching is
simply hypnagogic myoclonus,
which is Medicalese for "twitching
right before you fall asleep." It is
perfectly healthy and normal, and
just about everyone experiences it.
When your boyfriend goes to bed
with the intention of sleeping (and
now that he's dating a Stanford stu
dent, what other intention could he
have?), his brain gradually relin
quishes control of motor functions
and he enters the "hypnagogic state"
— a period of curtailed consciousness
characterized in most people by the
swift appearance and disappearance

of incoherent thoughts and images.
This is the time of night when
you get thoughts like, "Well, yes,
I've got that exam tomorrow, and
then I have to go to the Bursar's
office and get some of that nice pie."
In many people, hypnagogia is
accompanied by a sensation of
falling, or a feeling that an invisible
fluid is flowing through the body.
During this period, the brain is
sort of unsure whether it is awake
or asleep, and its responses get a lit
tle funny. A mild stimulus that
would have evoked a coherent reac
tion during wakefulness — an itch,
for example, or an unpleasant odor
(no comment) — can instead cause
an undirected, inappropriate
response like a twitch or jerk.
Sometimes hypnagogic myoclonus
is strong enough to wake a person up
a little bit, prolonging the descent
into sleep and thus the window of
time during which the sluggish
brain's inadequate processing abili
ties can trigger myoclonic responses.
Some people's hypnagogic halluci
nations are vivid enough to trigger
myoclonus — absent external stimuli,
the classic example being an amplifica
tion of the aforementioned generalized
falling sensation to a dream of actually
plummeting toward the earth.
Impact, with all its messiness, is
replaced by a single myoclonic jerk,
and the dreamer is jarred into a low
level of wakefulness rather than
being put through the ordeal of being
splattered over imaginary pavement.
A final aside: Another possible
cause of hypnagogic myoclonus is
anxiety — resulting, for example,
from upcoming exams, stressful term
papers or hopeless sexual desperation.
