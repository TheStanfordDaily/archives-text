# Satellite to test gravity theories
## Scientists examine Einstein's relativity theory with spinning balls 
### Laura Stroud 
In 1959, when Stanford Physics Prof.
Leonard SchifT came up with an experi
ment that would test Einstein's general
theory of relativity, the idea was little
more than a "thought experiment."
Now, more than three decades later,
Schiffs "thought experiment" may
become a reality as scientists at Stan
ford complete the final research and
development of Gravity Probe B — a
small space satellite containing gyrating
balls and a telescope.
Currently, about 90 people at Stan
ford are involved in the 30-year-old pro
ject, including 14 undergraduates.
A test launch has been scheduled for
1995 at the Kennedy Space Flight Cen
ter. The launching of the complete
probe will probably take place at the
turn of the century, according to
Physics Prof. John Turneaure, who
helps run the project.
Although much of astrophysics
depends on Albert Einstein's general
theory of relativity, it is very difficult to
prove the theory either true or false.
The Gravity Probe is one of the few
experiments that have been designed to
test the theory.
The Gravity Probe tests two phe
nomena predicted by Einstein's theory:
geodetic precession and frame dragging.
Geodetic precession is when an object
remains in the same plane but rotates,
much like the needle of a compass.
Frame dragging is when a massive,
spinning object like Earth or a black
hole drags space-time with it as it spins.
Einstein's theory of general relativity
— that gravity warps space and time —
was a direct challenge to Isaac Newton's
theory of gravity.
Newton claimed that gravity was a
force that traveled instantaneously out
ward from massive objects to pull on
anything in their vicinity. Einstein,
however, thought that no signal could
travel faster than the speed of light.
According to Einstein, massive objects
curved space-time around themselves as
they moved.

To test for geodetic precession and
frame dragging, Schiff and his col
leagues decided to use gyroscopes: spin
ning, metal-coated balls about one and a
half inches in diameter.
Gyroscopes were first invented in the
mid-19th century as an instrument for
studying the Earth's rotation by means
of a freely suspended wheel.
In all gyroscopes, the underlying
principle is that rotating systems should
stay pointing in the same direction in
space.
By lining up the four gyroscopes with
a distant star, scientists could measure
whether the Earth's rotation was drag
ging space-time along with it.
The idea is to experimentally mea
sure how close spin direction agrees
with Einstein's theory of gravity warp
ing space-time.
Gravity Probe B is made up of four
gyroscopes and a 14-inch telescope with
an 150-inch focal length that will align
the gyroscopes with Rigel, the guide star.
The gyroscopes and telescope are
housed inside a large dewar vessel, a
double-walled flask with a vacuum
between the walls, resembling a ther
mos bottle. The dewar maintains the
instruments at a temperature close to
absolute zero and stays cold for two
years.
The dewar vessel holds 400 gallons of
superfluid helium, whose initial charge
is expected to last for over two years.
The probe itself is made of aluminum
along with other materials and includes
a lead foil shield, which keeps the mag
netic field around the gyroscope to a
constant, low level.
Many parts of the probe involve some

form of state-of-the-art technology. For
example, a 22-hour lapping and polish
ing process creates gyroscopes that are
spherical to less than one millionth of
an inch and polished until they could be
used as magnifying glasses.
The metal coating on the gyroscopes,
a thin layer of niobium, has an average
uniformity of a millionth of an inch. The
coating is applied in a special dustless
room because the tiniest piece of dust
could cause the coating to flake.
The telescope to be used in the probe
is "the first to point this accurately,"
Turneaure said.
The project, which is funded by
NASA, is housed primarily on the Stan
ford campus, in three laboratories
behind the Physics Tank. Over the
years, funding for the project has been
somewhat inconsistent, but Turneaure
seemed hopeful about funding prospects
for next year.
The four faculty members involved in
the project are Research Prof. Francis
Everitt, the principal investigator, along
with Turneaure, and Aeronautics and
Astronautics Profs. Brad Parkinson and
Dan Deßra. Also working on the project
are 20 physics and engineering graduate
students and several foreign researchers.
Work on the gravity probe has result
ed in 27 doctoral dissertations
The Gravity Probe will be placed into
a North-South polar orbit 600 kilome
ters above the earth, and will circle the
earth for 16-17 months.
The first year of orbit will be devoted
to the experiment itself, and the next
four or five months will include checks
on the orbit and the calibration of any
disturbances.
