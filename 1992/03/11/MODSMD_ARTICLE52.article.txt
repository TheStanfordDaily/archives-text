# Salamanders slither back to Lake Lag
## Amphibians thought to be extinct on Peninsula were spotted at Stanford

Water isn't the only thing that has
returned to Lake Lag. The tiger salaman
der — a shy, sedentary denizen of the lake
and woods, once thought to be extinct in
the San Francisco Peninsula — was spot
ted after the recent rains.
The night of the first sighting, a group of
local salamander devotees flocked to the
intersection of Campus Drive and Junipero
Serra and transported the creatures safely
across the street. Despite their efforts,
some of the salamanders were unsuspect
ing victims of oncoming cars.
Unfortunately, Stanford biologists were
not among the rescuers, and did not get a
live specimen.
"We have road kills that look like a cross
between a toad and a banana peel,"
bemoans Dennis Murphy, director of the
Center of Conservation Biology at Stan
ford. "But if you look carefully, you can
identify them by their characteristic yel
lowy-cream and purplish markings."
The 6 to 8-inch-long California tiger
salamander is black, with so-called "tiger"
splotches. Murphy speculated that the
unique markings may warn predators that
the creature is noxious or distasteful.
According to Murphy, the tiger salaman
der is interesting from the evolutionary
biologist's point of view, since it is found
only in isolated communities scattered
across the United States and the separate
populations have little interaction with
each other.
UC-Davis zoologist H. Bradley Shaffer
believes the California tiger salamander is
different enough from other subspecies of
tiger salamanders to be considered an
entirely new species.
Conservation biologists are interested in
tiger salamanders because they have man
aged to exist in a fragmented habitat.
Maintaining the population of California
tiger salamanders is "an exemplar of the
challenge of protecting any species in a
rapidly developing area," Murphy said.
The last sighting of a tiger salamander
at Stanford was 17 years ago, in 1975. But
Murphy said a few may have been around
since then, because "no one at Stanford has
been looking for them."
California tiger salamanders live in an

area from Sonoma County in the north to
Santa Barbara County in the south, but the
only other population nearby is near
Gilroy. On the East Coast, the tiger sala
mander is so common that the larvae, or
juveniles, are used as fish bait.
Lake Lagunita is a historical breeding
ground for the tiger salamander. They
awake from aestivating, or summer hiber
nation, and migrate from the hills west of
campus to the shores of Lake Lag, where
mating and egg-laying occur.
Murphy speculates that the larvae
mature in the lake and emerge as adults
when the lake dries up. Larvae were found
in Lake Lag last spring.
Lakes that don't stay full throughout the
year, such as Lake Lag, are better for the tiger
salamander, because there is less of a chance
that their larvae will be eaten up by fish.
Murphy shared anecdotal evidence of
their previous abundance: "A frat alum
said to me, 'Oh yeah, those. We used to bat
them back and forth with tennis rackets.'"
Murphy said that in normal circum
stances, the tiger salamander would breed
annually, but that the droughts may have
caused them to miss a cycle occasionally.

The lower numbers may be responsible for
the lack of sightings.
The tiger salamander can live up to 20
years in captivity, and can remain dormant
for long periods of time.
The resuscitation of this rare salaman
der population could be aided by creating
trenches under Junipero Serra, enabling
the salamanders to pass under, instead of
over, the busy road, Murphy suggested.
He mentioned that areas with large pop
ulations of newts often post signs to warn
motorists of the crossing amphibians.
A further measure would be to limit the
number of fish entering Lake Lag by filter
ing the water that is diverted periodically
from San Francisquito Creek. Murphy also
suggested that the University strictly
enforce the prohibition against four-wheel
drive vehicles in the area because they tear
up the south shore of the lake.
Shaffer has petitioned to have the tiger
salamander placed on the California endan
gered species list.
The Center of Conservation Biology and
Stanford's Planning Department have
begun discussions about ways to protect
the salamander, Murphy said.
