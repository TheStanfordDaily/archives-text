Med school wins major diabetes grant
The School of Medicine has been chosen as one of six "Programs
of Excellence" to receive mayor funding for diabetes research.
The $20 million grant, given jointly by the National Insti
tutes of Health and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation Interna
tional, will fund five research projects at the Medical School.
The projects will use as research subjects non-obese diabet
ic mice, which develop diabetes in a way very similar to humans.
Results of the study will help researchers analyze type I or
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, which is also known as
juvenile diabetes.

The disease is an autoimmune disease in which the body's
own immune system destroys islet cells of the pancreas that
normally make insulin.
The researchers will try to explain the genetic and immuno
logic events that trigger the immune system to start recogniz
ing pancreatic cells as "foreign" and begin attacking them.
The researchers are also working to develop strategies for
preventing the disease, which afflicts about 14 million Ameri
cans, from ever getting started.
A single autoimmune event initiates the cascade of "immune
effector" events that lead to autoimmune destruction of pan
creatic beta cells, the researchers argue.
