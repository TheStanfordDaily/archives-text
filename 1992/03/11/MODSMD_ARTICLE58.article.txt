Alfred Hitchcock's only daughter, Patricia, spoke
to a packed house about her father's life and work,
supplying the audience with a host of amusing and
informative anecdotes about life on the set.
Perhaps one of the best-kept secrets revealed
that evening was the importance of Hitchcock's
wife, Alma, to the making of his films. "She was
absolutely an integral part of everything he did,"
IJatricia Hitchcock said. "She worked as a writer,
worked as an editor. And in later years ... he
d find stories, and immediately she would read
to see if she thought he could make a movie.
\said no, he wouldn't even pursue it any fur
(iyttie was with him every single part of the
rag-nost impressive example of Alma Hitch-

Hitchcock's indispensable value
to her husband's work was
revealed during an early screen
ing of "Psycho."
Patricia Hitchcock recalled
that everyone at the screening
reacted positively — except her
mother, who had noticed that the
film's heroine, Vera Miles, had
taken a breath when she was sup
posed to be dead.
An only child, Patricia Hitch
cock also took an active role in her
father's films. Having established
a love for acting while still in
boarding school, she starred in
two plays that opened in New
York as a child, and later studied
at the Royal Academy of Dramat
ic Art in London.
While her father filmed "Shad
ow of a Doubt" in Santa Clara,
Calif., she coached the child
actress chosen by her father for a
role in the film. Nearly ten years
later, Ms. Hitchcock played Bar
bara Morton in her father's
"Strangers on a Train," an oppor
tunity, she says, she "couldn't
pass up."
The 1951 film stars Farley
Granger as a champion tennis
player drawn into a psychopath's
demented murder pact.
Robert Walker, as the psy

chopath, was instrumental to the
film's success. He took a Hitch
cock character that was at bottom
a demented delinquent, and pro
ceeded to bathe and dress him in
charm, elegance and cunning.
Walker presents a stunning con
trast to Granger's handsome,
brash jock character.
Hitchcock's use of innovative
camera angles, lighting and edit
ing embellished the eerie mood of
the picture, and foreshadowed his
gripping technique in later films.
Recently, Hollywood's idea of a
suspense thriller has suffered from
unnecessary predictability and
redundancy. It's refreshing to see a
group of films that in no way resem
ble "The Silence of the Lambs."
You won't want to miss this
tribute to the genius of Hitch
cock, since, as his daughter
mused, "My father made movies
to entertain people; he made
movies for you, the audience."

The Hitchcock festival ends April
3 with the final showing of "Psy
cho" and"The Birds," hailed as
Hitchcock's greatest films. Along
the way, the Stanford Theatre will
present such classics as "Rope,"
"Dial 'AT for Murder," "The
Wrong Man," "The Trouble with
Harry," "Vertigo" and "North by
Northwest."
