"Talk damion," I typed on the keys of a dorm
Macintosh.
As if in a sudden snowstorm, the screen filled
white â€” clean except for the dashes halfway
down, the asphalt road. In the top corner, "[con
nection established]" said that we'd linked over
the network.
"hiya jen" appeared under the dashes, a
ghost-writing initiated by short, thick fingers
typing on the other end.
My own faded-tan fingers replied, mirroring

his casual lower-case
voice. I felt like a wind
whipped, heavily-bur
dened traveller in the
winter countryside.
More words asked,
"how was your day?
what've you been up
to? did you get any
sleep?"

I struggled to answer, my thoughts crowding
together. The rounded, black print protected me
with its bold letters. The first two questions I
answered briefly, but I delayed with a little story
for the last. I told him how I'd been locked out of
my room at 4 a.m. while visiting the restroom. I
ended up sleeping in the computer cluster
because no one could he awakened.
"that's terrible," he wrote, sympathy flooding
through his curved letters.
A moment of silence, and I wonder if I should
step out, mar the pristine white snow of screen
