# Wintry travels

### Jennifer Chien 
"Talk damion," I typed on the keys of a dorm
Macintosh.
As if in a sudden snowstorm, the screen filled
white — clean except for the dashes halfway
down, the asphalt road. In the top corner, "[con
nection established]" said that we'd linked over
the network.
"hiya jen" appeared under the dashes, a
ghost-writing initiated by short, thick fingers
typing on the other end.
My own faded-tan fingers replied, mirroring

his casual lower-case
voice. I felt like a wind
whipped, heavily-bur
dened traveller in the
winter countryside.
More words asked,
"how was your day?
what've you been up
to? did you get any
sleep?"

I struggled to answer, my thoughts crowding
together. The rounded, black print protected me
with its bold letters. The first two questions I
answered briefly, but I delayed with a little story
for the last. I told him how I'd been locked out of
my room at 4 a.m. while visiting the restroom. I
ended up sleeping in the computer cluster
because no one could he awakened.
"that's terrible," he wrote, sympathy flooding
through his curved letters.
A moment of silence, and I wonder if I should
step out, mar the pristine white snow of screen

and risk the unseen bottom.
I mark the soft surface, "did
you mean anything by that poem
you showed me last night?"
He replies, "which one?" A
breeze blows up, cold.
I turn to withdraw, but the
momentum of my step pulls me
forward, "the one by e. e. cum
mings, your favorite author."
"oh that one. 'i carry your
heart in my heart'?"
I touch solid ground under
neath. "no," he continued, "that
was the first poem of his i read
and got me interested in him. why
do you ask?"
Unseen ice cracks with my
weight. My body plunges into the
snow, "um, nothing..."
"no, what's up?"
"I find that..." I turned from
the white screen. A tide of emo
tions clogged my arteries and
blocked the blood to my brain.
Then in a quick burst, "i'm
feeling a way about you that i find
difficult to cope with considering
what we've discussed about our
relationship before."
He hesitated, and I couldn't
imagine his face, my eyes pressed
in snow. Slowly, letter by letter,
appeared, "i'm not sure that i
understand."
I typed a few fragments, com
pleting his understanding. Inside,
my frustration — aware of the
danger, yet toppling through the
ice helplessly — worked its pain.

"j . . . " His electronic feelers
reached earnestly, "i think you're a
wonderful person, i think you're
intelligent and humorous ... and i
really enjoy hanging out with you...
you've got a great personality, and
you're a hell of a poet..."
Ice formed a thin coat on my
skin, a familiar chill to one who
has fallen several times before.
He wrote, "but i'm not ready
for a relationship right now."
"i know."
Consideration flowed through
the electronic stream: "What do
you think we should do?"
"well, i'd still like to see you," I
wrote. Then a little less timid, "I
think I'm just confusing myself. I
knew how you felt and how I
wanted to be alone for awhile, but
I couldn't keep to it." I reached for
a branch, a rock, anything, to pull
me up.
"you can't be perfect." Noth
ing.
My limbs numbed in the sub
zero snow, stiffening. "I think I
need to pray."
"sure, if that works for you,
that's fine." Cold, so cold. My
blood slowed in its circulation,
and with it, my flow of typed char
acters.
Perhaps sensing this, he
reached out with a zap of electron
ic compassion, "are we still going
out for cocoa?"
I'd almost forgotten. Kneeling
next to me in the snow, his out
stretched, mittened hand reached
for mine.
"Sure."
I clasped his hand and let him
pull.
