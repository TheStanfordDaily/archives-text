# Mandela to visit in November
## Law School will award him prize 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
South African anti-apartheid
leader Nelson Mandela will speak
at Stanford in early November
during a three-day visit to accept
the Stanford Law School's Jack
son H. Ralston Prize.
So far, Mandela's visit to Stan
ford is the only stop planned on his
trip to the United States, according
to Law Prof. William Gould, chair
man of the Ralston Committee,
which is arranging Mandela's visit.
"I think it will be a marvelous
opportunity for Stanford [to get]
direct insight" into the changing
political situation in South Africa,
said David Abernethy, a political
science professor specializing in
African politics.
"By the time Mandela arrives, a
lot of important developments will
have occurred in the negotiations
over the transition to a democrati
cally-elected government," he added.

In a referendum next Tuesday,
white voters in South Africa will
decide whether they support Pres
ident de Klerk's reforms aimed at
ending apartheid. The country's
30 million black citizens cannot
participate in the referendum.
Abernethy said the results of
the referendum will largely deter
mine the nature of South Africa's
political transition, and Man
dela's role in the process.
Gould, who traveled to Johan
nesburg in January to encourage
Mandela to come to Stanford, said
the prize was awarded for Man
dela's work in promoting "inter
national peace through law."
"We found Mandela to be par
ticularly appropriate because of
his commitment to constitutional
reform in South Africa... and his
role in influencing international
opinion," Gould said.
However, Hoover Institution
Senior Fellow Lewis Gann ex
pressed "an overriding objection"

to the choice of Mandela as the
award recipient. He said he was
unhappy with Mandela "not on the
grounds of his personal charac
ter," but because he is "unhappy
with a politician whose party (the


Nelson Mandela
African National Congress) remains
linked with the Communist Party of
South Africa."
Responding to Gann's criti
cism of the choice, Gould said: "In
my view . . . there is no one in this
century who, by his audacious
words and deeds supporting all
humankind, is more qualified
than Mr. Mandela."
Gould said Mandela's speech
— tentatively scheduled for Nov.
9 in Memorial Auditorium — will
discuss the "constitutional pro
cess in South Africa." The speech
will be free and open to students,
but information on obtaining
tickets is currently unavailable.
Senior Owen Maubane, one of 15
South African students at Stanford,

expressed excitement at the news of
Mandela's visit. "He's a very im
pressive man," Maubane said.
The South African government
jailed Mandela for 27 years to
block his efforts to end South
Africa's white majority rule. He
was released Feb. 11, 1990.
Later that year, Stanford Law
School awarded him the Ralston
Prize. Gould said there was "real
difficulty in getting a response"
from Mandela regarding his
acceptance of the award at the
time. Confusion over whether
Mandela received the letters from
Stanford accounted for the delay
between the award date and his
acceptance, according to Gould.
The Ralston Committee also
invited Winnie Mandela to Stan
ford, but currently "there are no
plans for her to come," Gould said.
Winnie Mandela has been
embroiled in controversy since

last year, when several of her per
sonal body guards were convicted
in the beating death of a South
African boy. Related charges
against Mandela are on appeal,
and she has subsequently taken a
less prominent political role.
Nelson Mandela was chosen
for the prize by Law School Dean
Paul Brest, University President
Donald Kennedy and then-Secre
tary General of the United
Nations Javier Perez de Cuellar.
The prize is awarded no more
than once a year, and is accompa
nied by a cash award of $30,000
from the endowed Ralston fund.
Former Canadian Prime Minis
ter Pierre Trudeau and Oscar Arias,
former president of Costa Rica,
have received the award in the past.
Mandela's other plans while at
Stanford include two dinners and
a seminar with students and fac
ulty members.

humankind, is more qualified
than Mr. Mandela."
Gould said Mandela's speech
— tentatively scheduled for Nov.
9 in Memorial Auditorium — will
discuss the "constitutional pro
cess in South Africa." The speech
will be free and open to students,
but information on obtaining
tickets is currently unavailable.
Senior Owen Maubane, one of 15
South African students at Stanford,

expressed excitement at the news of
Mandela's visit. "He's a very im
pressive man," Maubane said.
The South African government
jailed Mandela for 27 years to
block his efforts to end South
Africa's white majority rule. He
was released Feb. 11, 1990.
Later that year, Stanford Law
School awarded him the Ralston
Prize. Gould said there was "real
difficulty in getting a response"
from Mandela regarding his
acceptance of the award at the
time. Confusion over whether
Mandela received the letters from
Stanford accounted for the delay
between the award date and his
acceptance, according to Gould.
The Ralston Committee also
invited Winnie Mandela to Stan
ford, but currently "there are no
plans for her to come," Gould said.
Winnie Mandela has been
embroiled in controversy since

last year, when several of her per
sonal body guards were convicted
in the beating death of a South
African boy. Related charges
against Mandela are on appeal,
and she has subsequently taken a
less prominent political role.
Nelson Mandela was chosen
for the prize by Law School Dean
Paul Brest, University President
Donald Kennedy and then-Secre
tary General of the United
Nations Javier Perez de Cuellar.
The prize is awarded no more
than once a year, and is accompa
nied by a cash award of $30,000
from the endowed Ralston fund.
Former Canadian Prime Minis
ter Pierre Trudeau and Oscar Arias,
former president of Costa Rica,
have received the award in the past.
Mandela's other plans while at
Stanford include two dinners and
a seminar with students and fac
ulty members.
