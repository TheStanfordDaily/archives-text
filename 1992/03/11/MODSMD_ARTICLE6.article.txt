## Law School will award him prize 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
South African anti-apartheid
leader Nelson Mandela will speak
at Stanford in early November
during a three-day visit to accept
the Stanford Law School's Jack
son H. Ralston Prize.
So far, Mandela's visit to Stan
ford is the only stop planned on his
trip to the United States, according
to Law Prof. William Gould, chair
man of the Ralston Committee,
which is arranging Mandela's visit.

30 million black citizens cannot
participate in the referendum.

the referendum will largely deter

political transition, and Man
dela's role in the process.
Gould, who traveled to Johan
nesburg in January to encourage
Mandela to come to Stanford, said
the prize was awarded for Man
dela's work in promoting "inter
national peace through law."
"We found Mandela to be par
ticularly appropriate because of
his commitment to constitutional
reform in South Africa... and his
role in influencing international
opinion," Gould said.
However, Hoover Institution
Senior Fellow Lewis Gann ex
pressed "an overriding objection"

to the choice of Mandela as the
award recipient. He said he was
unhappy with Mandela "not on the
grounds of his personal charac

with a politician whose party (the
