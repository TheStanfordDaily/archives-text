# Photographer seeks striking look, not 'meaning'
## 
### David Goldenberg 
When asked about the "meaning" of his multime
dia art show currently on display in the Coffee House,
senior Gil Blank laughed.
"I really try not to take myself too seriously," he
said. Blank, who plans on going into fashion photog
raphy after graduation, refuses to call what he does
"art."
"I just want people to say 'cool' and walk away," he
explained. "Don't sit there and drill into it, just look at
it and then go order your coffee."
Even the focus of the show, works done during the
Gulf War which include an American flag, are "not
meant to preach â€” they're just random observa
tions," he said.
Blank does not want to assign the large flag paint
ed on pieces of newsprint any more significance than
what you see at first glance. "I know people will look
at the text and try to find some meaning," Blank said,
"but I just liked the look of small print, the texture of
it."
Many of Blank's photographs are done in what is
called "regeneration photography." For instance, one
of his favorite pieces is a "print of a photograph of a
painting of a videotape." Blank combined this fourth
generation image of a girl's face with a different neg
ative of some old German manuscript. The result is
one of the most striking photos in the show.
"I just take pictures of a lot of little bits," Blank
said. "I don't do panoramas, I never try to capture the
whole scene. Then I go into the darkroom and put all
these pieces together until it looks right. All my pic
tures are just manipulated images."

To create this stunning photograph, Senior Gil Blank used video, painting and text from an old German
manuscript.
The main influence for his "regeneration"
pieces comes from working in London for
David Hiscock, who did the Enya "Water
mark" album cover as well as several Cocteau
Twins album covers.
"I did an album cover too," Blank said,
"and people say, 'Really? What group?
Michelle Shocked? U2?' No, it was the
Screaming Pigs. But you gotta start some
where."
Yet knowing he has to start somewhere
doesn't seem to stop him. Blank, like many
other seniors, may be applying for jobs for
next year, but investment banking isn't in his
future. He's applying for positions with mag
azines like Elle and Sports Illustrated.
"I started in high school," he said. "When
the other kids got the Sports Illustrated
swimsuit calendar, I said to myself, 'There's a
job here. Why sit here when you can do that."'
So he went out and did it. Blank has
already been on several professional shoots
and has worked with renowned fashion pho
tographer Giles Bensimo on a cover of Elle
magazine.
He said, "College for me is one giant exper
iment before I have to start the rest of my life.
It's a time to get your look, then once you
know what you like to do, take it to fashion."
Blank may be experimenting, but he
doesn't see his time at Stanford as a waste. "If
I wasn't here I would have just cranked out
fashion photos by copying what I saw," he
said. "Thanks to (photography professors)
Laura (Volkerding) and Joel (Leivick), I have

really learned a lot about myself and my pho
tography."
Yet unlike other fine arts rmyors, Blank
doesn't see what he does as terribly impor
tant. "Elle doesn't say anything, it just looks
cool," he said. "It may make you want to go

out and buy something, but mostly it just
grabs you. That's all I'm trying to do."
"Photography for me is a means to an end. The
end is the look. Don't think about why I choose
the colors I do, don't read in messages, just
shut your mind off for a little bit and eryoy it."
