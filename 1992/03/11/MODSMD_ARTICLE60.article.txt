# Photographer seeks striking look, not 'meaning'
## 
### David Goldenberg 
When asked about the "meaning" of his multime
dia art show currently on display in the Coffee House,
senior Gil Blank laughed.
"I really try not to take myself too seriously," he
said. Blank, who plans on going into fashion photog
raphy after graduation, refuses to call what he does
"art."
"I just want people to say 'cool' and walk away," he
explained. "Don't sit there and drill into it, just look at
it and then go order your coffee."
Even the focus of the show, works done during the
Gulf War which include an American flag, are "not
meant to preach â€” they're just random observa
tions," he said.
Blank does not want to assign the large flag paint
ed on pieces of newsprint any more significance than
what you see at first glance. "I know people will look
at the text and try to find some meaning," Blank said,
"but I just liked the look of small print, the texture of
it."
Many of Blank's photographs are done in what is
called "regeneration photography." For instance, one
of his favorite pieces is a "print of a photograph of a
painting of a videotape." Blank combined this fourth
generation image of a girl's face with a different neg
ative of some old German manuscript. The result is
one of the most striking photos in the show.
"I just take pictures of a lot of little bits," Blank
said. "I don't do panoramas, I never try to capture the
whole scene. Then I go into the darkroom and put all
these pieces together until it looks right. All my pic
tures are just manipulated images."
