Americans have what you might call a
superiority complex. Then again, "com
plex" may be a generous word, since the
philosophy doesn't usually run much deeper
than "We're the best and you guys suck."
And it's not just the pool-playing, Chevro
let-driving, Jim "Hacksaw" Dugan kind of
crowd, either. All Americans take just a little
too much pride in their home — both the
entire country and their more specific resi
dence. Just in California, we get such enticing
locales as "The Happiest Place on Earth,"
"The Garlic Capital of the World," and of
course "Home of the Cup-flipper."
When I was "studying" in Berlin, one of my
neighbors was a young architect from England
named Luke. Apparently, people in England
are a bit behind the times and think that
"Luke" is still a pretty cool name to give your
kid, when it in fact went out of style, if not with
the Old Testament, then at least by the time
"The Dukes of Hazzard" went off the air.
We were sitting at the kitchen table when
Luke started complaining about that excessive
American patriotism. Naturally, my loyalty
was aroused, and I could not let this blasphe
my pass without proper rebuttal:
"Well, that's 'cause we're the best and you
guys suck."
"Oh, and wot geeves you such an uppity
attichyude?"
"Hey man, look at the world today — the
U.S.A. has made it what it is. Like, when was
the last time your prime minister or queen —
may I call her Liz? — did anything that went
against U.S. policy?"
"Don't make fun of ahr queen."
"C'mon, aren't you guys one of our states
yet? Oh, sorry, that's right — you're a constitu
tional monarchy. How very Lockeian of you."
"Don't make fun of ahr queen."
"What, got a crush on her? Wanna get in on
the in-breeding? Do some bucking in Bucking
ham? Perform the Royal Scam? Go for — "

"J SAID DON'T MAKE FUN OF AHR
QUEEN!!" His eyes had that "Bill Bixby's
about to get really angry" look, so I told him to
chill out. Get a grip. Confront reality.
"So sorry, ol' chap. But let's face it, England
isn't exactly the world power it used to be. Oh,
'the sun never sets on the British Empire' ...
Yeah, sure, until about seven-thirty."
"Shut the hell up."
"Hmph. You're just still bitter about losing
the war."
"Wot do you mean, bitteh? We won. We
were on the same side, you turd. You Ameri
cans really do stink at history."
"No, no. The Revolutionary War, you
maroon. Boy, we sure whupped you there.
What a slaughter, a complete trouncing, a
drubbing. Not even funny."
"Oh, the rebellion, you mean? Some 'war'
you call it. A bunch of drunks wear in' makeup
toss some tea over a boat — I wouldn't exactly
call that a 'trouncing' or whatever your baby
word was."
"Baby word?"
"Yes, you Americans use such baby words.
'Oh, I go to school in California.' You don't
bloody go to school. Twelve-year-olds go to
school. You go to a Univahsity. And 'oh, I have
to write a paper.' It's called a thesis. You write
on a paper, dammit. And what do you call
those disgusting little orange cakes you've got,

with the cream inside that looks like some
body's - "
"Twinkies?"
"Yes, 'Twinkies.' What a cute, baby name.
And that thing that keeps a car quiet. What do
you call it, a shusher or shoosher or something?"
"Muffler?"
"Oh yes, 'muffler.' How cute. Just like what
a baby would say. Goes along just dandy with
your baby beers."
"Hey, man, don't make fun of Old Milwau
kee!"
"You can't get pissed off that crap."
"Pissed? Who said I was — oh, you mean
drunk. What a cute baby word, Luke. But
wait, I'm sorry. Brits don't have baby words.
And it's a jolly-good pip-pip cheerio thing
they don't, or else — hullo, what's this? —
they'd bloody well be bloody bloody ridiculed
a whole bloomin' lot, wouldn'tcha say,
gov'nuh?"
"All royght, you colonial, that's enough."
His conversation had become tiresome.
There was only one way out of this verbal Val
ley Forge:
"Now those Frenchmen, on the other hand..."
"Bloody bastards! Got their arrogant noses
stuck in wine glasses ..."
"Land of the brie, home of depraved, that's
what I always say."
"Sittin' outside in their bloody cafes, even
when it's sleeting and ten below ..."
"Too bad they didn't have that kind of
endurance during World War 11, huh?"
"Yeah, bloody 'Maginot Lines.' Brilliant."
"More like i-maginot lines, huh? Some
world power. Nice token seat on the UN Secu
rity Council..."
And so it went.

"Twinkies?"
"Yes, 'Twinkies.' What a cute, baby name.
And that thing that keeps a car quiet. What do
you call it, a shusher or shoosher or something?"
"Muffler?"
"Oh yes, 'muffler.' How cute. Just like what
a baby would say. Goes along just dandy with
your baby beers."
"Hey, man, don't make fun of Old Milwau
kee!"
"You can't get pissed off that crap."
"Pissed? Who said I was — oh, you mean
drunk. What a cute baby word, Luke. But
wait, I'm sorry. Brits don't have baby words.
And it's a jolly-good pip-pip cheerio thing
they don't, or else — hullo, what's this? —
they'd bloody well be bloody bloody ridiculed
a whole bloomin' lot, wouldn'tcha say,
gov'nuh?"
"All royght, you colonial, that's enough."
His conversation had become tiresome.
There was only one way out of this verbal Val

"Now those Frenchmen, on the other hand..."
"Bloody bastards! Got their arrogant noses
stuck in wine glasses ..."
"Land of the brie, home of depraved, that's
what I always say."
"Sittin' outside in their bloody cafes, even
when it's sleeting and ten below ..."
"Too bad they didn't have that kind of
endurance during World War 11, huh?"
"Yeah, bloody 'Maginot Lines.' Brilliant."
"More like i-maginot lines, huh? Some
world power. Nice token seat on the UN Secu

And so it went.

Americans have what you might call a
superiority complex. Then again, "com
plex" may be a generous word, since the
philosophy doesn't usually run much deeper
than "We're the best and you guys suck."
And it's not just the pool-playing, Chevro
let-driving, Jim "Hacksaw" Dugan kind of
crowd, either. All Americans take just a little
too much pride in their home — both the
entire country and their more specific resi
dence. Just in California, we get such enticing
locales as "The Happiest Place on Earth,"
"The Garlic Capital of the World," and of
course "Home of the Cup-flipper."
When I was "studying" in Berlin, one of my
neighbors was a young architect from England
named Luke. Apparently, people in England
are a bit behind the times and think that
"Luke" is still a pretty cool name to give your
kid, when it in fact went out of style, if not with
the Old Testament, then at least by the time
"The Dukes of Hazzard" went off the air.
We were sitting at the kitchen table when
Luke started complaining about that excessive
American patriotism. Naturally, my loyalty
was aroused, and I could not let this blasphe
my pass without proper rebuttal:
"Well, that's 'cause we're the best and you
guys suck."
"Oh, and wot geeves you such an uppity
attichyude?"
"Hey man, look at the world today — the
U.S.A. has made it what it is. Like, when was
the last time your prime minister or queen —
may I call her Liz? — did anything that went
against U.S. policy?"
"Don't make fun of ahr queen."
"C'mon, aren't you guys one of our states
yet? Oh, sorry, that's right — you're a constitu
tional monarchy. How very Lockeian of you."
"Don't make fun of ahr queen."
"What, got a crush on her? Wanna get in on
the in-breeding? Do some bucking in Bucking
ham? Perform the Royal Scam? Go for — "

"J SAID DON'T MAKE FUN OF AHR
QUEEN!!" His eyes had that "Bill Bixby's
about to get really angry" look, so I told him to
chill out. Get a grip. Confront reality.
"So sorry, ol' chap. But let's face it, England
isn't exactly the world power it used to be. Oh,
'the sun never sets on the British Empire' ...
Yeah, sure, until about seven-thirty."
"Shut the hell up."
"Hmph. You're just still bitter about losing
the war."
"Wot do you mean, bitteh? We won. We
were on the same side, you turd. You Ameri
cans really do stink at history."
"No, no. The Revolutionary War, you
maroon. Boy, we sure whupped you there.
What a slaughter, a complete trouncing, a
drubbing. Not even funny."
"Oh, the rebellion, you mean? Some 'war'
you call it. A bunch of drunks wear in' makeup
toss some tea over a boat — I wouldn't exactly
call that a 'trouncing' or whatever your baby
word was."
"Baby word?"
"Yes, you Americans use such baby words.
'Oh, I go to school in California.' You don't
bloody go to school. Twelve-year-olds go to
school. You go to a Univahsity. And 'oh, I have
to write a paper.' It's called a thesis. You write
on a paper, dammit. And what do you call
those disgusting little orange cakes you've got,

with the cream inside that looks like some
body's - "
"Twinkies?"
"Yes, 'Twinkies.' What a cute, baby name.
And that thing that keeps a car quiet. What do
you call it, a shusher or shoosher or something?"
"Muffler?"
"Oh yes, 'muffler.' How cute. Just like what
