## New 'Heavies,' old R&B 
### Cheo H. Coker 
New Jack Swing is beyond
tired. Commercial black radio
has bled the style dry of any
originality and quality.
With the exception of En
Vogue's "Hold On," nothing
has sounded as refreshing as
the introductory singles of the
style. Keith Sweat's "I Want
Her," A 1 B. Sure's "Night And
Day"and Bobby Brown's "My
Prerogative" were the perfect
combination of soulful croon

It was the first R&B music
in a long time that could tickle
the fancy of both the Flygirls
and Da Fellas; the vocals made
the girlies wet, while the
rhythm tracks had enough fla

The success of New Jack has
changed R&B as we know it.
Every producer with a sam
pling keyboard and a drum
machine has tried to duplicate
the sound and success of Teddy
Riley, LA and Babyface, and
Jam N' Lewis. Artists ranging
from Patti Labelle to Michael
Jackson have had rap cameos

on their albums, while count
less "one-hit wonders" have
duplicated the formula to score
forgettable number-one sin
gles.
The result is a genre almost
completely devoid of artistic
n\erit; formula has superseded
musical integrity.
The London-based group the
Brand New Heavies, however,
have saved R&B from the New
Jack nemesis. To salvage the
funk pioneered by Rufus and
Chaka Khan, James Brown's
J.B's, and Sly and the Family
Stone, the Heavies have
thrown away the samplers,
drum machines and MIDI
sequencing in favor of live
instru mentation.
Live, in this case, entails
funky basslines, kickin' break
beats and soulful vocals, topped
off with a jazz-fusion vibe that
extends endlessly. From the
first song to the last, this solid
debut effort reassures even the
harshest critic that R&B isn't
completely dead.
"BNH," the opening track,
kicks with mad flavor. The
