## New 'Heavies,' old R&B 
### Cheo H. Coker 
New Jack Swing is beyond
tired. Commercial black radio
has bled the style dry of any
originality and quality.
With the exception of En
Vogue's "Hold On," nothing
has sounded as refreshing as
the introductory singles of the
style. Keith Sweat's "I Want
Her," A 1 B. Sure's "Night And
Day"and Bobby Brown's "My
Prerogative" were the perfect
combination of soulful croon
ing and hip-hop music and atti
tude.
It was the first R&B music
in a long time that could tickle
the fancy of both the Flygirls
and Da Fellas; the vocals made
the girlies wet, while the
rhythm tracks had enough fla
vor to make the brothas sweat.
The success of New Jack has
changed R&B as we know it.
Every producer with a sam
pling keyboard and a drum
machine has tried to duplicate
the sound and success of Teddy
Riley, LA and Babyface, and
Jam N' Lewis. Artists ranging
from Patti Labelle to Michael
Jackson have had rap cameos

on their albums, while count
less "one-hit wonders" have
duplicated the formula to score
forgettable number-one sin
gles.
The result is a genre almost
completely devoid of artistic
n\erit; formula has superseded
musical integrity.
The London-based group the
Brand New Heavies, however,
have saved R&B from the New
Jack nemesis. To salvage the
funk pioneered by Rufus and
Chaka Khan, James Brown's
J.B's, and Sly and the Family
Stone, the Heavies have
thrown away the samplers,
drum machines and MIDI
sequencing in favor of live
instru mentation.
Live, in this case, entails
funky basslines, kickin' break
beats and soulful vocals, topped
off with a jazz-fusion vibe that
extends endlessly. From the
first song to the last, this solid
debut effort reassures even the
harshest critic that R&B isn't
completely dead.
"BNH," the opening track,
kicks with mad flavor. The

bassline is a brilliant reworking of
the classic "Brick House" groove
used by the Commodores, coupled
with a riveting drum track. Once
the keyboard, guitar and horns
come in, there's no escape from
the retro-funk journey in
progress.
"Dream Come True" is the
first vocal-accompanied track of
the pack, featuring the beautiful
and very talented N'Dea Daven
port. N'Dea's voice is reminiscent
of a young Chaka Khan; she has a
solid vocal range, but doesn't try
to impress the listener with tire
some vocal gymnastics a la Mari
ah Carey.
The rest of the band plays
Rufus to her Chaka, backing her
up with music that simultaneous
ly accentuates and supports her
voice.
"Never Stop" is the perfect
radio single. It's commercial
enough to have wide appeal, but
never sacrifices the integrity of
the funk sound. The keyboard
drops heavy lines over a break
beat that was so funky KRS-One
had to sample it on "Questions
and Answers" on his "Sex and
Violence" LP.
"Put The Funk Back In It" is
an instrumental that does just
that. The track is incredibly

funky, matching the fervor of
classic James Brown instrumen
tals like "The Grunt" and
"Gimme Some More." The best
songs don't need vocals; the
grooves speak for themselves.
These grooves speak so much
they almost rap. Best instrumen
tal jam on a recent album since
Lenny Kravitz's "Freedom
Train."
"Sphynx" is a laid-back instru
mental that gives the drummer
and bassist some space. Tight
horn lines punctuate the rhythm
track with a jazz-like flavor, cre
ating true New Jack "Swing."
"Stay This Way," the LP's sole
ballad, is perhaps the most fully
realized song. Davenport's pas
sionate vocals are the perfect
complement to the Heavies'
funk/jazz accompaniment, mak
ing for five minutes of great
music. Press repeat and start the
CD from the beginning.
The Brand New Heavies' self
titled debut is one of the freshest
releases of the year. Its biggest
selling point is its authenticity; no
samples from the infamous "Ulti
mate Breaks and Beats" collec
tion or ghost vocals from Martha
Wash.
Go buy this record to put the
funk back in your life, and wait
for the new release featuring
vocals by Gangstarr, Grand Puba
Maxwell and Large Professor
from Main Source among others.
I'm Out!
