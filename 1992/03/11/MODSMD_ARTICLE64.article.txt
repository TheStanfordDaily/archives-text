# Special effects repair 'Lawnmower'
## 
### Paul Curthoys Editorial staff 
There actually is one good rea
son to see the new Stephen King
movie "The Lawnmower Man" —
the special effects are absolutely
dazzling.
The rest of the movie is not.
Both horrible acting and a stale,
predictable plot plague this film.
Yet remarkably, the high-tech
scenes where actors cavort in a
virtual-reality world are enough
to glue the ragged edges of this
movie together.
Pierce Brosnan stars as Dr.
Angelo, the stereotypically
obsessed scientist. In a storyline
rehashed from the novel "Flow
ers For Algernon," he perfects a
technology that can be used to
advance intelligence levels and
develop psychic abilities.
Unfortunately, the directors
dodge all opportunities for origi
nality, and the film wears on pre
dictably. Angelo entices Jobe (Jeff
Fahey), a simple-minded garden
er, to take part in his experiment.
The acting barely transcends the
level of a grade school musical,
but the vivid virtual-reality
sequences continually resurrect
the vitality of the movie.
Jobe develops profound intelli
gence, every psychic ability men
tioned in all those bad science fic
tion novels, and, of course, a love
interest. In one of the more inter
esting scenes, the couple has
"cyber-sex" within virtual reality.

Kinky, huh?
But when the evil military
intelligence goons who provide
Angelo's funding discover his
work, they decide to twist Jobe
into a tool of war. Angelo
protests, but the goons silence
him — after all, there needs to be
something resembling a conflict

in the plot.
Something goes awry, and
Jobe becomes an evil Franken
stein they all must try to destroy
in order to save the world.
As the movie wound down, I
found myself actually caring
what happened in the end —
mostly because I had just invest-

Ed two hours sitting in the the
ater, but also because the "wow"
factor of all the computer graph
ics justified that time. The con
clusion is almost tense, but never
gripping, and the directors do
save the best special effects for
the end. But wait for the rental —
this one isn't worth seven bucks.
