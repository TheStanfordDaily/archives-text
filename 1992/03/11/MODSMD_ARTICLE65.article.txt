# Four-hour 'Noiseuse' simply nauseous
## 
### Liz Lempert Editorial staff 
"La Belle Noiseuse" is the kind of slow-mov
ing, arty foreign flick that most people are
afraid to hate. But at Friday night's showing at

the Aquarius, among the small crowd inside the
anonymity of the ladies' room, the consensus
was close to universal: four hours is too long for
any movie, especially one that drives you nuts.
It's not the stunning beauty of Marianne
(Emmanuelle Beart) that gets under your skin.

Rather it is the egotistical self-absorption of the
aging artist who paints her that ultimately
sends the viewer over the edge.
"La Belle Noiseuse" tells the story of a
young couple — Marianne and her artist/lover
Nicolas (David Bursztein) — who travel to the
south of France to meet with Edouard (Michel
Piccoli), a once-celebrated painter who hasn't
produced anything in the past 10 years.
Edouard suffers from a painter's block,
brought on by the difficulties he had in
attempting to paint his wife, Liz (Jane Birkin),
in a work entitled "La Belle Noiseuse."
Nicolas, eager to see the old master return to
his art, offers to have Marianne model for him,
and Marianne reluctantly complies. What ensues
for the next three-and-a-half hours is a somewhat
tortured version of PBS's "Joy of Painting."
Before he moves on to paints, Edouard
makes preliminary sketches of Marianne with
painfully scratchy quills and charcoal blocks.
The sound of the drawing instrument as it
inches across the canvas resembles too closely
the hair-raising screech of fingernails on a
blackboard.
Just as irritating as the scraping sounds are
the repetitive scenes with Edouard and Mari
anne: he twists her in a pretzel and spouts deep,
artistic feelings of angst, and twists her in a
pretzel again.
Mercifully, the south of France provides a
beautiful backdrop for the film, and Edouard's
home, an old chateau, is also magnificent.
Another bit of relief is the short intermission
after the first two and a half hours. It allows an
easy escape for those who find that "noiseuse" is
the perfect adjective for the artist's creative process.
