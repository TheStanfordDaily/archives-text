# Dancers mesh steps with poetry
## 
### Sean Etigson Staff writer 
If a dancer creates with the body and a poet
crafts words, how can bodies be made to speak and
words to dance?
The Delia Davidson Dance Company came to
Roble Gym to answer that question with a preview
of their latest show, "The Ten PM Dream," which
runs March 11-15 at the Theater Artaud in San
Francisco.
The work is based on "Transformations," a
series of haunting Anne Sexton poems that retell
the dark side of Grimm's Fairy Tales.
Delia Davidson, an acclaimed choreographer
based in San Francisco, told the crowd at the Feb.
21 preview, "I became interested in 'Transforma
tions' 15 years ago. I loved the poetry; I just didn't
know how to deal with it yet."
When the time came to re-approach "Transfor
mations" with her dance company, Davidson said
it was important to "take on the metaphorical
aspects of the poems."
The performance integrates movement, poetry
and music in a manner that disarms traditional
criticism. Similarly, the subject matter of Sexton's
poetry moves between dreams and childhood,
eluding conventional boundaries.
In effect, the music and poetry collaborate with
the dancers to create a dark, disturbing fantasy
world. Three actors playing witches roam the
periphery of the stage, reinventing the poetiy
while the dancers interpret the words and music at

center stage. The bodies move in
harsh, wrenching motions, convey
ing the torment that Sexton uncov
ered in the fairy tales.
A varied, moody soundtrack
aids the emotional power of the
performance. On many of the
pieces, the witches sing, adding to
the eerie quality of the show.
Especially in the sketch of "Sleep
ing Beauty/Briar Rose," the deep
trauma of an incestuous encounter
comes through in the troubled
movements of the dancers and the
careening, falsetto voice of one of the
witches, screaming, "Daddy!"
Davidson explained Sleeping
Beauty as a character that was
"psychologically asleep, overcome
by this tremendous weight."
The dancer interpreting Sleep
ing Beauty exudes insomnia and
heaviness in her movements, even
as the voices of the witches call out,
"I must not dream It's not the
prince at all, but my father drunk
enly bent over my bed."
After the performance, Diane
Middlebrook, an English professor

and the author of a recent best
selling biography of Sexton, said:
"I think the work made fabulous
use of the language. It found new
voices and colors and tones and
dramas inside of the poems."
The actors rendering the witch
es do indeed turn the poetry into
theater. The three of them share
lines originally spoken by one
witch. By conferring in duos and
trios, they augment the sinister
storytelling already at work in
Sexton's poems.
The performance as a whole
rides the line between the intellec
tual and the visceral. In dealing
with heady issues such as mad
ness, child abuse, sexuality and
confusing gender roles, Davidson
said it is important to "build up
energy and violence on the stage."
In striving for this effect,
Davidson weaves manic, hysterical
moments, where the dancers run
laps around the stage and each
other, with staccato passages that
focus on very few movements.
Bodies, voices and instruments
collaborate to form unexpected
and powerful images. Together,
they invent new art out of old; they
coax the words to dance and make
the bodies read like a lyric.
