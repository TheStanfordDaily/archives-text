# Supergroup trips, but doesn't fall
## 
### Ari Richter Senior staff writer 
In theory, supergroups should
work — bring together an all-star
team of musicians and you've got
a sure thing.
The plan worked more than 20
years ago, for instance, when
David Crosby (who came from
The Byrds), Stephen Stills (Buffa
lo Springfield) and Graham Nash
(The Hollies) united.
But whether because of a lack
of chemistry or the clashing of
egos, when they take to the stu
dio, supergroups are by no means
guaranteed to succeed.
The latest such experiment
brings together blues-rock gui
tarists John Hiatt and Ry Cooder,
bassist Nick Lowe and drummer
Jim Keltner, all of whom have
proven their merits over the
course of lengthy careers. But
their combined effort, "Little Vil
lage," doesn't measure up to the
sum of its parts.
And at its worst, "Little Vil
lage" fails miserably, offering
lyrics such as "Don't go away

mad/ 'Cause that'd really make
me sad" and the track "Don't Bug
Me When I'm Working," whose
monotony is only barely out
stripped by the sounds of a pneu
matic drill.
On the other hand, Little Vil
lage is clearly a band having a
good time. Like The Traveling
Wilburys a few years before
them, Cooder, Hiatt, Keltner and
Lowe seem to have gotten togeth
er to have fun — which, com
bined with the fact that they'll
have to play some of the band
members' older songs when they
tour, should make for an enjoy
able live show.
As far as the studio effort goes,
though, only a few good songs
emerge. The album's opening
track, "Solar Sex Panel," has all
the makings of a hit — from a
catchy tune to light-hearted lyrics
— as Hiatt assumes the persona
of a bald man who achieves
tremendous virility by soaking up
the sun's rays through his head
turned-solar reflector:
"Got a fire up on top of my
head/ I'm a love regenerator/ Why

don't you get up off your tanning
bed? I'm an ultra-violet Penetra
tor."
Another song, "Don't Think
About Her When You're Trying to
Drive," comes up just short of
greatness. Anyone who's ever
gone for a drive to vent some frus
tration (and then nearly gotten
into an accident because of a lack
of concentration) can empathize
with the song's theme.
Unfortunately, that theme
isn't developed very far; the lyrics
struggle to go beyond the superfi
cial, and some of the metaphors
are strained: "A heart in your
condition/Shouldn't be out on
that road tonight/Bad clutch and
your load keeps shiftin'/But hold
on, Buddy you'll be alright.''
Considering the wealth of tal
ent the band members brought to
the project, "Little Village" disap
points.
Call it the curse of the super
group.

Little Village will be performing
at the Warfield in San Francisco
on April 7.
