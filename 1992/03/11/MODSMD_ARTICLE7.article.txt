# Policy teaches dangers of liability, not drinking
## Year-old alcohol policy hasn't changed attitudes nor made campus much safer

Rather than educate the community
about the dangers of alcohol abuse, the
University alcohol policy — now in its sec
ond year — has mainly taught students to
avoid liability, most students and staff say.
"I'm not so sure that there's been an
increase in awareness of the problems of
drinking alcohol," said junior Adriana Duffy,
president of the Intersorority Council. "But
there's definitely more awareness of liability
— of problems that can occur if you have
parties that are not well-managed."
Party organizers are taking measures
to protect themselves, such as hosting

smaller parties and advertising less, but
some say the policy has not made the cam
pus a safer place to drink.
In fact, they say, these measures have
created an environment where students
are more likely to drink off-campus, at
fraternity parties or alone in their dorm
rooms, preventing residence staff from
effectively monitoring drinking behavior.
"It's more of a big deal to drink now," said
senior Garner Weng, a resident assistant at
Branner. "And it's less in check by RAs."
Since its implementation in October
1990, the policy — in which the Universi
