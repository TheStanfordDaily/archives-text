# Policy teaches dangers of liability, not drinking
## Year-old alcohol policy hasn't changed attitudes nor made campus much safer 
### Elisa Nino-Murcia Staff writer 
Rather than educate the community
about the dangers of alcohol abuse, the
University alcohol policy — now in its sec
ond year — has mainly taught students to
avoid liability, most students and staff say.
"I'm not so sure that there's been an
increase in awareness of the problems of
drinking alcohol," said junior Adriana Duffy,
president of the Intersorority Council. "But
there's definitely more awareness of liability
— of problems that can occur if you have
parties that are not well-managed."
Party organizers are taking measures
to protect themselves, such as hosting

smaller parties and advertising less, but
some say the policy has not made the cam
pus a safer place to drink.
In fact, they say, these measures have
created an environment where students
are more likely to drink off-campus, at
fraternity parties or alone in their dorm
rooms, preventing residence staff from
effectively monitoring drinking behavior.
"It's more of a big deal to drink now," said
senior Garner Weng, a resident assistant at
Branner. "And it's less in check by RAs."
Since its implementation in October
1990, the policy — in which the Universi

use on campus — has drawn crit
icism for contradicting Stanford's
long standing philosophy of trust
ing students to make responsible
decisions on their own.
The policy was mandated by a
1990 federal law threatening loss
of education funds for postsec
ondary institutions that failed to
implement anti-alcohol rules.
"There's a problem with what
the government wants us to do
versus what we've had in the
past," said Okada Resident Fel
low Virginia Mak. "There seems
to be two prevailing values — one
a law, and one a value that stu
dents can decide for themselves.
That gets to be a sticky question."
These two values conflict
sharply when dorms, traditional
centers of campus social life, orga
nize parties. RAs say the new pol
icy, which prohibits the use of
University funds to purchase
alcohol, has confused their role.
It has the potential to make
them into police-like enforcers,
threatening their position as stu
dent friend and adviser, they say.
And the Greek system, con
fronted with both the University
guidelines and more restrictive
national insurance policies, has
also been redefining its role on
campus, slowly shifting away
from its open-door tradition
toward tighter security and more

closed parties.
"The social atmosphere (here)
is becoming more closed and less
comfortable," said senior Steve
Jarrett, president of the Interfra
ternity Council. "Hard security
has become more and more popu
lar, because of both the alcohol
policy and greater insurance risk."
'Forced exclusivity'
"Liability" has been the opera
tive word in the Greek system's
response to the alcohol policy, serv
ing as the prime motivation for fra
ternities and sororities to host
fewer, smaller parties and institute
tighter security measures.
"I'm not sure that [the policy
has] changed attitudes as much as
it has changed the way people run
parties — so they don't get sued
for millions," Duffy said.
And concern over liability has
catalyzed a gradual decline in
both the number of open parties
and the number of total parties
held by Greek organizations, sev
eral students said.
"Stanford's Greek system has
always been very open," Duffy
said. "But the alcohol policy is
forcing exclusivity."
"The Greek system's becoming
what the stereotype has been,"
Duffy continued. "But I don't
think anyone's happy with that.
We want to have large parties
open to everyone, but it's hard to
control things [when you do]."

And for unhoused fraternities,
just finding a place to throw a
party has become a problem since
the institution of the policy. Jar
rett said his fraternity, Sigma Nu,
encountered difficulty finding a
dorm to host their recent party
with Alpha Phi Alpha.
"We were talking to Lagunita
for quite some time before con
vincing them to let us hold our
party there," Jarrett said. "And
that was without alcohol. We
were unable to find a dorm that
was willing to let us throw a party
with alcohol."
With dorms throwing fewer
and fewer parties on their own,
fraternities may be gaining a
monopoly on the campus social
scene, a role not relished by many
fraternity members.
"I really hope there won't be
more students trying to get into
the Greek system just because
that's where the parties are," Jar
rett said. "I'd hate to see the
Greek system get bigger just
because people want to party. But
that may happen."
'RA's are in a tough position'
Residence staff say they find
the policy's focus on liability par
ticularly troubling.
The policy expressly holds
"event planners ... individually
and collectively responsible for
planning and carrying out events
in compliance with the policy,"
and also forbids the use of Uni
versity funds to purchase alcohol.
To comply with the policy, many
RAs disengage from the party
planning process.
. And as dorms host fewer and
fewer parties, the drinking pat
terns that develop make alcohol
consumption much more difficult
to monitor, RAs say.
"The alcohol policy puts RAs in
a tough position because we can
not take the same active role in
planning parties," said senior
Geoff Carter, an RA at Gavilan.
And senior Ingrid Happoldt, a
Cardenal RA, voiced similar frus
trations. "It's harder to get a
sense of where people are at. Peo
ple drink among themselves in
their rooms, so you don't know
what's happening."
Some RAs said the liability
issue has also made it difficult for
them to define their roles as
friend rather than enforcer.
"I was not interested in being
an RA if it meant being an
enforcer,"said senior Lara Filson,
a Paloma RA. "It's not that we
don't care. It's just not our place."
Anne Porteus, Associate Direc
tor of Residential Education, said
her office wants their "RAs to be
confidantes. But the minute you
put a disciplinary function on
them, it changes everything."
Jose Antonio Burciaga, RF at
Casa Zapata, said he believes eth
nic dorms are placed under even
heavier burdens by the alcohol
issue.

"Ethnic RAs are looking out
twice as hard for this because
they suffer twice as much," said
Burciaga, adding that alcohol
related problems cause more seri
ous setbacks for ethnic theme
houses because of community
perceptions.
However, senior Omar Wasow,
an RA at Ujamaa, said the new
alcohol policy has not affected his
dorm that much. "Historically,
alcohol has not been a focus of the
black community.
'Everyone's more careful'
Most students agree that the
policy, instead of changing views
or educating students, has just
made party organizers more cau
tious about their plans.
"Everyone's a lot more care
ful," said Rhee. "It's not like we
can't have the alcohol. [The new
policy] just makes us stop and
think about it more rather than
stop the parties. [Student's views
on alcohol] haven't changed sig
nificantly."
And the preliminary results of
a survey conducted by Jamie
Nekich of Counseling and Psychi
atric Services (CAPS), confirm
Rhee's comments.
The fall quarter segment of the
three-part survey involved inter
views with social chairs and presi
dents of various groups on cam
pus, including all-freshmen
dorms, four-class dorms, Row
houses, fraternities and sororities.
Questions centered around
campus trends in party planning
and the change in behavior and
attitudes towards alcohol since
the policy's implementation.
Of the students interviewed,
80 percent felt alcohol was what
defined a party, and only 10 per
cent felt a party could be success
ful with no alcohol.
Students interviewed also said
that "security and control have
been implemented to some degree
... but many see controls as an
'empty exercise' done to avoid lia
bility," according to the results.
About 70 percent of the students
interviewed described ways they
could "circumvent the controls."
Junior Rip Waters, president
elect of the Intrafraternity Coun
cil, said fraternities are starting to
prioritize security measures such
as checking IDs, making sure peo
ple don't leave with open beers,
and not serving more beer to peo
ple who are already intoxicated.
"We're making these things
more of an issue, where they
weren't before,"Waters said.
But many said these controls
merely pay lip service to the poli
cy, since nearly everyone is admit
ted to parties and anyone can get
a drink if they want to.
The CAPS survey found that
none of the students interviewed
felt comfortable refusing alcohol
to students who had already had
enough to drink.

Painful memories
This year's alcohol-related inci
dents — including the sexual
assault in Stern Hall, and the
death of a Toyon resident whose
suicide note mentioned an alcohol
dependency — have sparked
renewed discussion about the con
sequences of alcohol use.
"Students continue to feel
immortal and invincible. And I
don't blame them. I felt the same
way at that age," said Burciaga.
But for Burciaga, the alcohol
issue "brings many painful memo
ries about September," he said,
hesitating to recall the sexual
assault in his dormitory this fall.
Senior Stuart Thomas pleaded
no contest to misdemeanor charges
of statutory rape and providing
alcohol to a minor in connection
with the incident.
Alcohol causes significant prob
lems in many campus residences.
At Branner's first party this year,
two males had a drinking contest
— each drinking 25 shots of hard
alcohol — that landed them in the
emergency room with alcohol poi
soning. Branner's subsequent par
ties, as a result, have been more
tightly controlled.
So far, "getting in trouble" has
been the only successful way to
motivate groups to "implement
more alcohol management poli
cies," the CAPS survey stated.
And students are getting in

trouble at about the same frequen
cy they did before the policy was
instituted, according to Stanford
Police Captain Raoul Niemeyer,
who has seen no significant decline
in alcohol-related incidents on
campus in the past few years.
'Deeper than paper'
Many argue that a university
policy, no matter how complete or
strictly enforced, simply isn't
enough. "Our commitment has to
go deeper than paper," Burciaga
said. "Policies are one thing. Self
control or self-discipline should be
what we're addressing."
And EUise Lenox, Director of
Project (Risk Reduction of
Intoxicants in the Stanford Com
munity), agrees. "If anything's
changing the students' attitudes,
it's training, not the policy."
Project R 2 ISC offers a "Social
Host Training Workshop" for
party planners to learn how to
refuse alcohol to students who
"have had too much to drink."
One of the study's findings sug
gests creating more programming
for freshmen that address the unique
social pressures of this group.
And Burciaga encouraged
installing the "familia concept" in
dorms, having students watch out
for each other.

Questions centered around
campus trends in party planning
and the change in behavior and

as checking IDs, making sure peo

and not serving more beer to peo
ple who are already intoxicated.
"We're making these things
more of an issue, where they
weren't before,"Waters said.
But many said these controls
merely pay lip service to the poli

a drink if they want to.
The CAPS survey found that
none of the students interviewed
felt comfortable refusing alcohol
to students who had already had
enough to drink.

Painful memories
This year's alcohol-related inci
dents — including the sexual
assault in Stern Hall, and the
death of a Toyon resident whose
suicide note mentioned an alcohol
dependency — have sparked
renewed discussion about the con
sequences of alcohol use.
"Students continue to feel
immortal and invincible. And I
don't blame them. I felt the same
way at that age," said Burciaga.
But for Burciaga, the alcohol
issue "brings many painful memo
ries about September," he said,
hesitating to recall the sexual
assault in his dormitory this fall.
Senior Stuart Thomas pleaded
no contest to misdemeanor charges
of statutory rape and providing
alcohol to a minor in connection
with the incident.
Alcohol causes significant prob
lems in many campus residences.
At Branner's first party this year,
two males had a drinking contest
— each drinking 25 shots of hard
alcohol — that landed them in the
emergency room with alcohol poi
soning. Branner's subsequent par
ties, as a result, have been more
tightly controlled.
So far, "getting in trouble" has
been the only successful way to
motivate groups to "implement
more alcohol management poli
cies," the CAPS survey stated.
And students are getting in

trouble at about the same frequen
cy they did before the policy was
instituted, according to Stanford
Police Captain Raoul Niemeyer,
who has seen no significant decline
in alcohol-related incidents on
campus in the past few years.
'Deeper than paper'
Many argue that a university
policy, no matter how complete or
strictly enforced, simply isn't
enough. "Our commitment has to
go deeper than paper," Burciaga
said. "Policies are one thing. Self
control or self-discipline should be
what we're addressing."
And EUise Lenox, Director of
Project (Risk Reduction of
Intoxicants in the Stanford Com
munity), agrees. "If anything's
changing the students' attitudes,
it's training, not the policy."
Project R 2 ISC offers a "Social
Host Training Workshop" for
party planners to learn how to
refuse alcohol to students who
"have had too much to drink."
One of the study's findings sug
gests creating more programming
for freshmen that address the unique
social pressures of this group.

'Stanford's Greek
system has always
been very open.
But the alcohol
policy is forcing
exclusivity'
— Adriana Duffy
Rather than educate the community
about the dangers of alcohol abuse, the
University alcohol policy — now in its sec
ond year — has mainly taught students to
avoid liability, most students and staff say.
"I'm not so sure that there's been an
increase in awareness of the problems of
drinking alcohol," said junior Adriana Duffy,
president of the Intersorority Council. "But
there's definitely more awareness of liability
— of problems that can occur if you have
parties that are not well-managed."
Party organizers are taking measures
to protect themselves, such as hosting

smaller parties and advertising less, but
some say the policy has not made the cam
pus a safer place to drink.
In fact, they say, these measures have
created an environment where students
are more likely to drink off-campus, at
fraternity parties or alone in their dorm
rooms, preventing residence staff from
effectively monitoring drinking behavior.
"It's more of a big deal to drink now," said
senior Garner Weng, a resident assistant at
Branner. "And it's less in check by RAs."
Since its implementation in October
1990, the policy — in which the Universi

use on campus — has drawn crit
icism for contradicting Stanford's
long standing philosophy of trust
ing students to make responsible
decisions on their own.
The policy was mandated by a
1990 federal law threatening loss
of education funds for postsec
ondary institutions that failed to
implement anti-alcohol rules.
"There's a problem with what
the government wants us to do
versus what we've had in the
past," said Okada Resident Fel
low Virginia Mak. "There seems
to be two prevailing values — one
a law, and one a value that stu
dents can decide for themselves.
That gets to be a sticky question."
These two values conflict
sharply when dorms, traditional
centers of campus social life, orga
nize parties. RAs say the new pol
icy, which prohibits the use of
University funds to purchase
alcohol, has confused their role.
It has the potential to make
them into police-like enforcers,
threatening their position as stu
dent friend and adviser, they say.
And the Greek system, con
fronted with both the University
guidelines and more restrictive
national insurance policies, has
also been redefining its role on
campus, slowly shifting away
from its open-door tradition
toward tighter security and more

closed parties.
"The social atmosphere (here)
is becoming more closed and less
comfortable," said senior Steve
Jarrett, president of the Interfra
ternity Council. "Hard security
has become more and more popu
lar, because of both the alcohol
policy and greater insurance risk."
'Forced exclusivity'
"Liability" has been the opera
tive word in the Greek system's
response to the alcohol policy, serv
ing as the prime motivation for fra
ternities and sororities to host
fewer, smaller parties and institute
tighter security measures.
"I'm not sure that [the policy
has] changed attitudes as much as
it has changed the way people run
parties — so they don't get sued
for millions," Duffy said.
And concern over liability has
catalyzed a gradual decline in
both the number of open parties
and the number of total parties
held by Greek organizations, sev
eral students said.
"Stanford's Greek system has
always been very open," Duffy
said. "But the alcohol policy is
forcing exclusivity."
"The Greek system's becoming
what the stereotype has been,"
Duffy continued. "But I don't
think anyone's happy with that.
We want to have large parties
open to everyone, but it's hard to
control things [when you do]."

And for unhoused fraternities,
just finding a place to throw a
party has become a problem since
the institution of the policy. Jar
rett said his fraternity, Sigma Nu,
encountered difficulty finding a
dorm to host their recent party
with Alpha Phi Alpha.
"We were talking to Lagunita
for quite some time before con
vincing them to let us hold our
party there," Jarrett said. "And
that was without alcohol. We
were unable to find a dorm that
was willing to let us throw a party
with alcohol."
With dorms throwing fewer
and fewer parties on their own,
fraternities may be gaining a
monopoly on the campus social
scene, a role not relished by many
fraternity members.
"I really hope there won't be
more students trying to get into
the Greek system just because
that's where the parties are," Jar
rett said. "I'd hate to see the
Greek system get bigger just
because people want to party. But
that may happen."
'RA's are in a tough position'
Residence staff say they find
the policy's focus on liability par
ticularly troubling.
The policy expressly holds
"event planners ... individually
and collectively responsible for
planning and carrying out events
in compliance with the policy,"
and also forbids the use of Uni
versity funds to purchase alcohol.
To comply with the policy, many
RAs disengage from the party
planning process.
. And as dorms host fewer and
fewer parties, the drinking pat
terns that develop make alcohol
consumption much more difficult
to monitor, RAs say.
"The alcohol policy puts RAs in
a tough position because we can
not take the same active role in
planning parties," said senior
Geoff Carter, an RA at Gavilan.
And senior Ingrid Happoldt, a
Cardenal RA, voiced similar frus
trations. "It's harder to get a
sense of where people are at. Peo
ple drink among themselves in
their rooms, so you don't know
what's happening."
Some RAs said the liability
issue has also made it difficult for
them to define their roles as
friend rather than enforcer.
"I was not interested in being
an RA if it meant being an
enforcer,"said senior Lara Filson,
a Paloma RA. "It's not that we
don't care. It's just not our place."
Anne Porteus, Associate Direc
tor of Residential Education, said
her office wants their "RAs to be
confidantes. But the minute you
put a disciplinary function on
them, it changes everything."
Jose Antonio Burciaga, RF at
Casa Zapata, said he believes eth
nic dorms are placed under even
heavier burdens by the alcohol
issue.

"Ethnic RAs are looking out
twice as hard for this because
they suffer twice as much," said
Burciaga, adding that alcohol
related problems cause more seri
ous setbacks for ethnic theme
houses because of community
perceptions.
However, senior Omar Wasow,
an RA at Ujamaa, said the new
alcohol policy has not affected his
dorm that much. "Historically,
alcohol has not been a focus of the
black community.
'Everyone's more careful'
Most students agree that the
policy, instead of changing views
or educating students, has just
made party organizers more cau
tious about their plans.
"Everyone's a lot more care
ful," said Rhee. "It's not like we
can't have the alcohol. [The new

them into police-like enforcers,
threatening their position as stu
dent friend and adviser, they say.
And the Greek system, con
fronted with both the University
guidelines and more restrictive
national insurance policies, has
also been redefining its role on
campus, slowly shifting away
from its open-door tradition
toward tighter security and more

closed parties.
"The social atmosphere (here)
is becoming more closed and less
comfortable," said senior Steve
Jarrett, president of the Interfra
ternity Council. "Hard security
has become more and more popu
lar, because of both the alcohol
policy and greater insurance risk."
'Forced exclusivity'
"Liability" has been the opera
tive word in the Greek system's
response to the alcohol policy, serv
ing as the prime motivation for fra
ternities and sororities to host
fewer, smaller parties and institute
tighter security measures.
"I'm not sure that [the policy
has] changed attitudes as much as
it has changed the way people run
parties — so they don't get sued
for millions," Duffy said.
And concern over liability has
catalyzed a gradual decline in
both the number of open parties
and the number of total parties
held by Greek organizations, sev
eral students said.
"Stanford's Greek system has
always been very open," Duffy
said. "But the alcohol policy is
forcing exclusivity."
"The Greek system's becoming
what the stereotype has been,"
Duffy continued. "But I don't
think anyone's happy with that.
We want to have large parties
open to everyone, but it's hard to
control things [when you do]."

And for unhoused fraternities,
just finding a place to throw a
party has become a problem since
the institution of the policy. Jar
rett said his fraternity, Sigma Nu,
encountered difficulty finding a
dorm to host their recent party
with Alpha Phi Alpha.
"We were talking to Lagunita
for quite some time before con
vincing them to let us hold our
party there," Jarrett said. "And
that was without alcohol. We
were unable to find a dorm that
was willing to let us throw a party
with alcohol."
With dorms throwing fewer
and fewer parties on their own,
fraternities may be gaining a
monopoly on the campus social
scene, a role not relished by many
fraternity members.
"I really hope there won't be
more students trying to get into
the Greek system just because
that's where the parties are," Jar
rett said. "I'd hate to see the
Greek system get bigger just
because people want to party. But
that may happen."
'RA's are in a tough position'
Residence staff say they find
the policy's focus on liability par
ticularly troubling.
The policy expressly holds
"event planners ... individually
and collectively responsible for
planning and carrying out events
in compliance with the policy,"
and also forbids the use of Uni
versity funds to purchase alcohol.
To comply with the policy, many
RAs disengage from the party
planning process.
. And as dorms host fewer and
fewer parties, the drinking pat
terns that develop make alcohol
consumption much more difficult
to monitor, RAs say.
"The alcohol policy puts RAs in
a tough position because we can
not take the same active role in
planning parties," said senior
Geoff Carter, an RA at Gavilan.
And senior Ingrid Happoldt, a
Cardenal RA, voiced similar frus
trations. "It's harder to get a
sense of where people are at. Peo
ple drink among themselves in
their rooms, so you don't know
what's happening."
Some RAs said the liability
issue has also made it difficult for
them to define their roles as
friend rather than enforcer.
"I was not interested in being
an RA if it meant being an
enforcer,"said senior Lara Filson,
a Paloma RA. "It's not that we
don't care. It's just not our place."
Anne Porteus, Associate Direc
tor of Residential Education, said
her office wants their "RAs to be
confidantes. But the minute you
put a disciplinary function on
them, it changes everything."
Jose Antonio Burciaga, RF at
Casa Zapata, said he believes eth
nic dorms are placed under even
heavier burdens by the alcohol
issue.

"Ethnic RAs are looking out
twice as hard for this because
they suffer twice as much," said
Burciaga, adding that alcohol
related problems cause more seri
ous setbacks for ethnic theme
houses because of community
perceptions.
However, senior Omar Wasow,
an RA at Ujamaa, said the new
alcohol policy has not affected his
dorm that much. "Historically,
alcohol has not been a focus of the
black community.
'Everyone's more careful'
Most students agree that the
policy, instead of changing views
or educating students, has just
made party organizers more cau
tious about their plans.
"Everyone's a lot more care
ful," said Rhee. "It's not like we
can't have the alcohol. [The new
policy] just makes us stop and
think about it more rather than
stop the parties. [Student's views
on alcohol] haven't changed sig
nificantly."
And the preliminary results of
a survey conducted by Jamie
Nekich of Counseling and Psychi
atric Services (CAPS), confirm
Rhee's comments.
The fall quarter segment of the
three-part survey involved inter
views with social chairs and presi
dents of various groups on cam
pus, including all-freshmen
dorms, four-class dorms, Row
houses, fraternities and sororities.
Questions centered around
campus trends in party planning
and the change in behavior and
attitudes towards alcohol since
the policy's implementation.
Of the students interviewed,
80 percent felt alcohol was what
defined a party, and only 10 per
cent felt a party could be success
ful with no alcohol.
Students interviewed also said
that "security and control have
been implemented to some degree
... but many see controls as an
'empty exercise' done to avoid lia
bility," according to the results.
About 70 percent of the students
interviewed described ways they
could "circumvent the controls."
Junior Rip Waters, president
elect of the Intrafraternity Coun
cil, said fraternities are starting to
prioritize security measures such
as checking IDs, making sure peo
ple don't leave with open beers,
and not serving more beer to peo
ple who are already intoxicated.
"We're making these things
more of an issue, where they
weren't before,"Waters said.
But many said these controls
merely pay lip service to the poli
cy, since nearly everyone is admit
ted to parties and anyone can get
a drink if they want to.
The CAPS survey found that
none of the students interviewed
felt comfortable refusing alcohol
to students who had already had
enough to drink.

Painful memories
This year's alcohol-related inci
dents — including the sexual
assault in Stern Hall, and the
death of a Toyon resident whose
suicide note mentioned an alcohol
dependency — have sparked
renewed discussion about the con
sequences of alcohol use.
"Students continue to feel
immortal and invincible. And I
don't blame them. I felt the same
way at that age," said Burciaga.
But for Burciaga, the alcohol
issue "brings many painful memo
ries about September," he said,
hesitating to recall the sexual
assault in his dormitory this fall.
Senior Stuart Thomas pleaded
no contest to misdemeanor charges
of statutory rape and providing
alcohol to a minor in connection
with the incident.
Alcohol causes significant prob
lems in many campus residences.
At Branner's first party this year,
two males had a drinking contest
— each drinking 25 shots of hard
alcohol — that landed them in the
emergency room with alcohol poi
soning. Branner's subsequent par
ties, as a result, have been more
tightly controlled.
So far, "getting in trouble" has
been the only successful way to
motivate groups to "implement
more alcohol management poli
cies," the CAPS survey stated.
And students are getting in

trouble at about the same frequen
cy they did before the policy was
instituted, according to Stanford
Police Captain Raoul Niemeyer,
who has seen no significant decline
in alcohol-related incidents on
campus in the past few years.
'Deeper than paper'
Many argue that a university
policy, no matter how complete or
strictly enforced, simply isn't
enough. "Our commitment has to
go deeper than paper," Burciaga
said. "Policies are one thing. Self
control or self-discipline should be
what we're addressing."
And EUise Lenox, Director of
Project (Risk Reduction of
Intoxicants in the Stanford Com
munity), agrees. "If anything's
changing the students' attitudes,
it's training, not the policy."
Project R 2 ISC offers a "Social
Host Training Workshop" for
party planners to learn how to
refuse alcohol to students who
"have had too much to drink."
One of the study's findings sug
gests creating more programming
for freshmen that address the unique
social pressures of this group.
And Burciaga encouraged
installing the "familia concept" in
dorms, having students watch out
for each other.

'Stanford's Greek

But the alcohol
policy is forcing
exclusivity'
— Adriana Duffy
Rather than educate the community
about the dangers of alcohol abuse, the
University alcohol policy — now in its sec
ond year — has mainly taught students to
avoid liability, most students and staff say.
"I'm not so sure that there's been an
increase in awareness of the problems of
drinking alcohol," said junior Adriana Duffy,
president of the Intersorority Council. "But
there's definitely more awareness of liability
— of problems that can occur if you have
parties that are not well-managed."
Party organizers are taking measures
to protect themselves, such as hosting

smaller parties and advertising less, but
some say the policy has not made the cam
pus a safer place to drink.
In fact, they say, these measures have
created an environment where students
are more likely to drink off-campus, at
fraternity parties or alone in their dorm
rooms, preventing residence staff from
effectively monitoring drinking behavior.
"It's more of a big deal to drink now," said
senior Garner Weng, a resident assistant at
Branner. "And it's less in check by RAs."
Since its implementation in October
1990, the policy — in which the Universi

use on campus — has drawn crit
icism for contradicting Stanford's
long standing philosophy of trust
ing students to make responsible
decisions on their own.
The policy was mandated by a
1990 federal law threatening loss
of education funds for postsec
ondary institutions that failed to
implement anti-alcohol rules.
"There's a problem with what
the government wants us to do
versus what we've had in the
past," said Okada Resident Fel
low Virginia Mak. "There seems
to be two prevailing values — one
a law, and one a value that stu
dents can decide for themselves.
That gets to be a sticky question."
These two values conflict
sharply when dorms, traditional
centers of campus social life, orga
nize parties. RAs say the new pol
icy, which prohibits the use of
University funds to purchase
alcohol, has confused their role.
It has the potential to make
them into police-like enforcers,
threatening their position as stu
dent friend and adviser, they say.

immortal and invincible. And I
don't blame them. I felt the same
way at that age," said Burciaga.
But for Burciaga, the alcohol
issue "brings many painful memo
ries about September," he said,
hesitating to recall the sexual
assault in his dormitory this fall.
Senior Stuart Thomas pleaded
no contest to misdemeanor charges
of statutory rape and providing
alcohol to a minor in connection
with the incident.
Alcohol causes significant prob
lems in many campus residences.
At Branner's first party this year,
two males had a drinking contest
— each drinking 25 shots of hard
alcohol — that landed them in the
emergency room with alcohol poi
soning. Branner's subsequent par
ties, as a result, have been more
tightly controlled.
So far, "getting in trouble" has
been the only successful way to
motivate groups to "implement
more alcohol management poli
cies," the CAPS survey stated.
And students are getting in

trouble at about the same frequen
cy they did before the policy was
instituted, according to Stanford
Police Captain Raoul Niemeyer,
who has seen no significant decline
in alcohol-related incidents on
campus in the past few years.
'Deeper than paper'
Many argue that a university
policy, no matter how complete or
strictly enforced, simply isn't
enough. "Our commitment has to
go deeper than paper," Burciaga
said. "Policies are one thing. Self
control or self-discipline should be
what we're addressing."
And EUise Lenox, Director of
Project (Risk Reduction of
Intoxicants in the Stanford Com
munity), agrees. "If anything's
changing the students' attitudes,
it's training, not the policy."
Project R 2 ISC offers a "Social
Host Training Workshop" for
party planners to learn how to
refuse alcohol to students who
"have had too much to drink."
One of the study's findings sug
gests creating more programming
for freshmen that address the unique
social pressures of this group.
And Burciaga encouraged
installing the "familia concept" in
dorms, having students watch out
for each other.
