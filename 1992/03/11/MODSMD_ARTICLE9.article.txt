### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
The number of undergradu
ates running for senate this year
increased from 32 last year to 43
this year, according to a list of
candidates released yesterday by
Elections Commissioner Enda
Hu.
Both the Students First and
People's Platform parties filed to
run 10 candidates for undergrad
uate senate, but each party had
one candidate disqualified.
The increase left 20 candidates
unaffiliated this year, up from
eight last year.
According to Hu, freshman
Robert Milk will not be placed on
the ballot because he only collect
ed 30 student signatures out of
the 50 required. Milk intended to
run with People's Platform.
Sophomore Silvia Ferroni,
acurrent senator who was going
to run with Students First, was
disqualified because she did not
turn in her candidacy materials
by the March 3 deadline, Hu said.
Forty-three students will run
for 20 undergraduate senate
seats. Seventeen graduate stu
dents will appear on the ballot,
vying for 20 graduate senate
seats.
Hu said that while only 17 stu
dents have filed to run for gradu
ate senate, all twenty seats will be
filled once write-in votes are
counted.
After the votes are counted,
Hu said he will contact the gradu
ate senate write-in candidates
who get the greatest number of
votes to see if they accept the sen
ate seat. Hu said a winning write
in candidate must file a declara
tion of intent to run within 24
hours after the polls close in order
to claim the seat.

Last year 18 candidates for
graduate senate appeared on the
ballot.
Three students — graduate
student Doug Bone, freshman
John Griggs and junior Beth Mor
gan — will run for spots on the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council. All three SCLC candi
dates are running with the Stu

dents First party.
The SCLC is the legislative
body that decides what actions
violate the fundamental standard.
It has three student members.
Only one slate has filed for the
senior class presidents race. The
slate, called The Final Four, con
sists of Brad Budney, Jason Dicks,
Tina Hua and Rosa Villagomez.
