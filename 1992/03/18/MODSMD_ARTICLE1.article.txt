### Miranda Doyle Peter Robison Editorial Staff 
Gerhard Casper, provost
at the University of Chicago,
was named Stanford's ninth
president yesterday. The
Board of Trustees approved
the selection during a Monday
teleconference.
Casper, 54, arrived in
Palo Alto last night and said
he is looking forward to taking
over at Stanford. "The quali
ties we have at this institution
are by every measure the most
special in the world," he said.
James Gaither, president of
the Board of Trustees, said, "We
are absolutely ecstatic with the
choice and what this means for
the future of Stanford."
Casper's selection "follows an
extensive national — indeed,
worldwide — search," he said.

Casper is the first outsider in nearly
25 years to become Stanford's president.
But Jean Fetter, the search com
mittee's executive vice chair, said
"there was no deliberate focus on
inside or outside. The focus was on
finding the very best person."
The search committee recommend
ed Casper to the Board fewer than two
months after it finished accepting
nominations.
Fetter said the search process,
which had originally been scheduled to
produce a president by mid-June, was
"not sped up."
"We just worked hard and were
well-led," Fetter said.
Gaither said he has spent much of

the last week discussing the position
with Casper.
University officials will formally
announce Casper's selection at a noon
press conference today.
Casper was a finalist for the presi
dential position at Harvard last year,
according to Harvard Sociology Prof.
David Riesman, whose book, "Choosing
a College President," was used as a
guide by the Stanford search committee.
Jason Frank, student body presi
dent at Chicago, said Casper was "gener
ally liked, both by students and faculty."
"He's a very intelligent man and
you're lucky to get him," Frank said.
Born in Hamburg, Germany, on
Christmas Day, Casper studied law in
Hamburg and received his degree in

1961. He came to the United States the
next year to attend Yale Law School.
Casper was dean of Chicago's law
school from 1979 until 1987, and has
been provost since 1989.
He announced his resignation as
provost at Chicago Jan. 13, effective at
the end of this academic year. Casper
had been considered the obvious choice
to be Chicago's next president, and his
resignation took many by surprise.
He said then that he wanted to
return to teaching, but Frank said
many at Chicago "anticipated [Casper]
would get a president's job at one of
the better universities."
One of Casper's actions as provost
was founding an ad-hoc committee to
