# Casper prepared to weather storm
## 
### Steve McCarroll Editorial staff 
Higher education is struggling fis
cally, losing federal research support
and facing a crisis in public trust. But
Gerhard Casper says he isn't worried.
"I have all the confidence in the
world for the future at Stanford,"
Casper said in an interview in his
Menlo Park hotel room last night.
Casper described, in his trade
mark German accent, the reverence
for American higher education that led
him to emigrate from Germany in
1964 to become an assistant professor
at UC-Berkeley.
He said Stanford will lead higher
education out of its morass through
excellence in teaching and research.
"We will weather all this," Casper
said. "The most important thing is
that we maintain the quality of the
enterprise."
He said undergraduate education
will be one of his special concerns at
Stanford. "The attention we give to
undergraduate teaching, the quality of
undergraduate teaching and the under
graduate curriculum [are] matters that
deserve a lot of examination," he said.
Casper dealt jokingly with a ques

tion about the budget crisis that has
dominated University discussion this
year. "I thought that President
Kennedy and Provost Rosse have dealt
with this problem," Casper said.
"That's what they said to me."
The art to managing a university
is not managing it too much, Casper
said. "The most important thing about
a university presidency is that the
president remain a faculty member,"

he said. "I will not for a minute think
of myself as an administrator."
Casper said he sees a "glimmer" of
light in the future of Stanford's negoti
ations with the federal government
over indirect-cost recovery.
"I do think that relations are bound
to improve because the federal govern
ment will understand that universities
are among the best institutions that we
have in the country," he said.
Casper corrected Board of Trustees
President James Gaither when the lat
ter introduced him as Dr. Gerhard
Casper. "I never use the 'doctor' title,"
Casper said.
Disagreeing with academics who
call the University of Chicago "tradi
tionalist," Casper said multicultural
ism will be a concern of his presidency.
"I myself have lived a multicultur
al experience," Casper said of his
immigration into the United States.
But "universities will have to maintain
what they are most about — teaching
and research."
Casper said he was "fundamental
ly impressed" by the "professionalism"
of the presidential selection committee.
"They asked me lots of very
searching questions," Casper said.
"They didn't give me a break."
