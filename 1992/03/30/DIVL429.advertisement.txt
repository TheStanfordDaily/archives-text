How Many More Will Die
Before You Say "No!" To The
Animal Rights Movement?
The cure for AIDS will come like every
cure before it, through animal research.
And yet, there is a growing movement of
animal rights activists who oppose any
use of animals in biomedical
research. As one of their
leaders, Ingrid Newkirk,
stated: "Even if animal
research resulted in a cure for
AIDS.. . we'd be against it. "
Although a tiny minority in our society, the
animal rights movement will stop at
nothing to achieve its aims. Their methods
range from disinformation, to intimida
tion, to outright terror. Their efforts must
be stopped, or all medical research may
one day come to a dead halt.
Americans for Medical Progress salutes
the dedicated scientists who continue
working against AIDS and other
diseases, despite fear and intimidation.
More importantly, we've formed the
Americans for Medical Progress
Educational Foundation to
spearhead the critical effort to
educate American opinion
leaders and citizens about the
necessity for animal research, if new
cures are to be found.
