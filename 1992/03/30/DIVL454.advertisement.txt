• Accepted students receive admissions letters (and later
transcripts) directly from a full college of Oxford University.
• Students are directly enrolled as full students of the Oxford
college. Qualified students who apply early may have a choice
among six full colleges: St. Catherine's. St. Edmund Hall,
Hertford, Keble, St. Antony's, and New College.
• Qualified early applicants may share a co-ed Student Residence
associated with St. Catherine's College, Oxford (fully Integrated
with British students).
• Students accepted before May 1 (for next year) are guaranteed
housing with British students.
• Students will NOT be taught In (and receive transcripts from) an

completely integrated (academically and in housing) overseas
programs in the UK.
• Previous students from your college or In your field will speak to
you on the phone.
