## Are ASSU senators worthy? 
### 
Perhaps the toughest part
of running for student government
is getting anybody to care.
Consider the unfortunate but neces
sary dual battle candidates for the ASSU
Council of Presidents must face: Even
before they can demonstrate their quali
fications to serve, they must first con
vince the student body the office matters.
As the annual elections rapidly
approach, and as the campus is blighted
with campaign fliers and placards in the
upcoming weeks, some will doubtless ask
what the ASSU actually does and why it
matters.
And as always, the minimum chal
lenge confronting those running for COP
will be to give just enough students a sat
isfactory answer to win. A slate hardly
need reach out to, let alone excite, the
whole campus to be elected.
But imagine if a slate were to excite
the whole campus. It would take some
effort, but not as much as one might
think, since ideological differences aren't
relevant to the ASSU's ability to provide
student services.
Certainly, the ASSU's image problem
must be overcome. Senators are
maligned as resume-packers who don't
give a damn and would be powerless to do
anything meaningful even if they wanted
to. And the COP gets flack for receiving a
comfortable stipend without producing
tangible results.

Such attitudes are not held by every
one on campus, nor do they reflect accu
rate portrayals of the majority of student
government officials. But those attitudes
are very much at issue.
Students need to be convinced of the
ASSU's value. (The onus is on those run
ning, not those being served.) What's in it
for us? And what channels can we go
through to get heard?
Sophomore John Hall, a member of
the Students First COP slate, has begun
the discussion; he suggests changing the
ASSU Senate so that students would
have a particular senator represent them
depending upon where they live. The idea
would maintain at-large elections of the
senators, assigning them to districts just
after the spring elections.
The plan has definite merits. Say, for
instance, Senator X was assigned to
Larkin and Donner. When the freshmen
arrived in the fall, they would receive in
their orientation packets a general
description of the ASSU as well as a spe
cific biography of their senator with a
phone number where constituents could
reach him or her.
In addition, resident assistants would
be encouraged to refer their residents to
that senator when any student services
related issues arose. Respect comes from
the top. If RAs were convinced of the
ASSU's value, they would pass on this
respect to their freshmen.

Hall would also change the ranking of
senators so that each voting senator
would be paired up with a non-voting
senator in being assigned to a district. If
the former failed to attend a senate meet
ing, he or she would be replaced by the
other senator from that district, not sim
ply by the non-voting senator who
received the most votes in the election.
Then, if both failed to attend, District
X's lack of representation at the meeting
would be appropriate cause for outcry
among the constituency.
Hall should add one more part to his
plan: Allow for the constituents of Dis
trict X to initiate recall proceedings
against their senator in a district-wide
election if 25 percent of the district signs
a petition to that effect.
Then, the plan would have teeth —
accountability — as well as the increased
contact between the students and the
ASSU that the plan already offers.
The discussion has started, but a lot of
us are still sleeping. The COP candidates
are hereby challenged to wake us up.
