Business opportunity exists in basement ofTresidder

THE CURRENT ASSU Senate
inherited a financial system in dis
array. Several years of misplaced
budgets and misplaced priorities have
robbed students of valuable, needed stu
dent services while creating "special
funds" and "discretionary accounts" to
accommodate the student leaders' desire
for secrecy. Members of the XXII Senate
have gone a long way to rectify these
past abuses.
In the process, we also discovered that
our predecessors, perhaps unwittingly,
held the keys to a vast reservoir of oppor
tunity. The ASSU By-Laws rightfully
mandate that 150 percent of annual oper
ating expenses be set aside as reserves.
The rest, however, ought be reinvested in
students and for students. The following
sets forth our preliminary proposal.
Although we do not argue with the 16
percent return on capital which our
money managers yielded since last
spring, we contend that this money
could best serve students by investing in

on-campus services so that students may
reap the fruits of the ASSU's accumulat
ed earnings.
Thus, we wish to develop the 10,000
square feet in the basement of Tresidder
Union, half of which currently houses
the Stanford Copy Center.
If the University believes this portion
of Tresidder is without redemptive value
and thus plans to leave much of it
vacant, we respectfully ask that it be
turned over to the ASSU for commercial
development.
Obviously, the University would
remain the ultimate custodian of this
space and would retain supervisoiy
authority vis-a-vis choice of tenants,
architectural design, etc.
Alternatively, the ASSU would act as
a Joint Venture Partner with the Uni
versity and as an outside organization to
provide for the construction, manage
ment and continued support of the
aforementioned space.
We wish to contribute the following

to the Joint Venture Partnership:
1) Capital reserves in excess of $1 mil
lion. We believe that this money could
serve as a portion of the collateral need
ed to transform the unoccupied space
into a valuable student service.
Given the changing winds of campus
politics, we would set aside funds in an
escrow account which the Joint Venture
Partnership would require in the fore
seeable future.
2) Institutional framework. We
understand the need to maintain the
property upon completion of its develop
ment.
We would amend our own ASSU By-
Laws so that student leadership in the
future fulfills its obligations to and
responsibility for the leased space. We
would also institute changes in our
internal organizational scheme so as to
accommodate these additional responsi
bilities.
3) Entrepreneurial spirit. In these
days of fiscal austerity and budget

restraint, we believe that students
should be offered the opportunity to par
ticipate in a new and exciting business
enterprise.
We maintain that harnessing the
energies of a whole new group of people
in the ranks of the ASSU leadership and
elsewhere would impact positively the
prevailing sentiments on campus.
New ideas and a new vision would
replace the "old paradigm" of top-down
bureaucratic decision-making. The "new
paradigm" offers opportunities for a
genuine partnership between the stu
dents, the administration and the vital
business community whose genesis can
proudly be traced to Stanford.
University President Donald Kennedy
summoned us, the ASSU leaders, to his
office last fall. His charge: to bring a new
idea, along with our pocketbooks, to the
table. We have made a good faith effort.
The ball is now in his court.
