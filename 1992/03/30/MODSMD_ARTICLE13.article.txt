In the wake of the decisions sur
rounding budget cuts in the Overseas
Studies program at Stanford, I feel
utterly drained, helpless and angry.
The Salamanca program will be cut,
thus officially making it the money
crunch's latest victim.
I came to Stanford partly because of
the opportunity to study in a Spanish
university, where I planned to become
fluent in Spanish so I could teach it in
the future.
Unfortunately, I have been left out of
any decisions about the future of the
program. From people I have talked to, I
know that my input was offered too late
in the decision-making process to make

a difference.
The Overseas Studies program com
mittee members had been working on
the decisions for so long that they felt
they had nothing more to say to stu
dents. That was a huge mistake.
One significant group of students was
left out. The eight to 15 people who
wanted to go next year, of which I am
one, were never formally asked how they
felt about this decision. Our input never
even counted.
Students have already put in the time
in classes preparing for Salamanca, mak
ing sure they would fulfill the require
ment of six quarters of Spanish classes.
The University should accommodate
its students with the program for which
they have so diligently prepared.
I'm the one paying tuition each quar
ter, and this university is set up for me.
If any decisions are going to be made in

this budget crisis about my undergradu
ate career, I want to be included from
the beginning.
This letter may seem somewhat belat
ed, but I really haven't been informed
enough to write until now.
I am not giving up on Salamanca. If
we can just make the right people see
how much we are losing in cutting it, we
will keep this program around to benefit
us all.
