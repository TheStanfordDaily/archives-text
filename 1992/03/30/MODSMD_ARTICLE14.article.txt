# Spiritual inquiry adds to academic discourse

Cory Booker's column "Bridging the
Religious Gap" in the March 4 issue of
The Daily was right on target.

By not doing more to encourage the
serious examination of religion and reli
gious issues, universities are starving
themselves. I cannot think of a better
topic for discussion on college campuses
than one which blends intellectual
excitement with spiritual inquiry.
Hopefully, Booker's column will start
a trend.
