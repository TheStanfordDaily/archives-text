The Stanford men's swim team didn't
travel to any exotic beach locales over
Spring Break. But members still had the
most exciting vacation imaginable, win
ning the NCAA championships with 632
points over second-place University of
Texas' 356.
Their point total was the highest ever
recorded in the meet's 69-year history.
The Cardinal went to the champi
onships in Indianapolis aspiring not only
to regain the NCAA crown after a four
year drought, but also to prove itself as
possibly the best collegiate swim team in
history.
"They took the best team there's ever
been in the sport to this meet," said Texas
coach Eddie Reese. "Their meet was just
phenomenal."
Stanford was led by senior captain and
world-record holder Jeff Rouse, who ended
his collegiate career by setting five Ameri
can records. Rouse won three individual
events and swam on three winning relay
teams during the three-day meet, held
Thursday through Saturday.

"I ended my career with a meet that I
couldn't have scripted better," Rouse said.
"This was my ultimate challenge and the
reward has been fantastic."
Rouse captured the individual title in
the 200-yard backstroke, leading Cardinal
swimmers Brian Retterer in fourth place
and Derek Weatherford in fifth. He won
with a record time of 1:40.64, nearly two
seconds faster than his time in the prelim
inaries, which also beat the standing
American record.
Rouse was equally impressive in the
100 back, winning in 46.12 and earning
another national record, followed by Ret
terer in second.
One of three collegiate swimmers to
qualify for the U.S. Olympic Team, Rouse
showed his versatility by winning the 200
Individual Medley, followed by teammates
Trip Zedlitz and Weatherford in third and
fifth, respectively.
Rouse also demonstrated his prowess as
a relay swimmer, anchoring the 400-free
relay team comprised of Retterer, Erik

The best collegiate swim team in history? Jeff Rouse's performance in the 400-meter medley relay capped a record-setting
weekend for both himself and Stanford. Rouse set five new American records, and the Cardinal's 632-point total was the
highest ever recorded in the 69-year history of the NCAA Championships.
event in 25 years.
Before the meet, men's coach
Skip Kenney stressed the impor
tance of the first day of competi
tion, which had been dominated by
Texas in recent years. The first day
features relay and freestyle events
— typically Texas' strengths.
However, the Cardinal awed
the nation by gaining full control
on the meet's opening day, with
Stanford swimmers winning four
of five events and gaining a 200-
117 lead over the Longhoms.
Maurer and Retterer finished
first and second respectively in
the crucial 50-free, proving that
Stanford would be a powerful
contender in freestyle events.
It was also imperative for
Stanford to overpower Texas in
the relay events, one of Texas'
strengths, in order to end the
Longhoms' four-year NCAA title
streak. Stanford rose to the occa
sion, breaking national records to
win the 200 and 400 medley
relays and winning the 200 and

400 free relays.
Rouse set an American record
in the backstroke leg of the 400
Medley relay, breaking the Amer
ican record of 3:09.70 in 3:08.39
with the help of Tyler Mayfield,
Brad Budney and deGroot. A
team of Rouse, Mayfield, Zedlitz
and Maurer won the 200 Medley
relay in 1:25.88, breaking the
American record of 1:27.31.
Bill Schell, Retterer, deGroot
and Maurer combined for a victo
ry in the 200 Free relay, with
Eddie Parenti, Retterer, Dan
Kanner and Weatherford winning
the 800 free relay to complete a
sweep of all five relay events. The
relay titles counted for double the
points of individual ones, giving
Stanford a huge lead over the
competition.
Another testament to Stan
ford's depth was Mayfield, who
took second in the 100 breast
stroke in 53.99. Kurt Grote took
fifth in the 200 breaststroke, with
Mayfield coming in sixth, as
freshman Ray Carey took fourth
in the 200 butterfly.
