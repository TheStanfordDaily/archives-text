### Tish Williams Staff writer 
The Stanford men's swim team didn't
travel to any exotic beach locales over
Spring Break. But members still had the
most exciting vacation imaginable, win
ning the NCAA championships with 632
points over second-place University of
Texas' 356.
Their point total was the highest ever
recorded in the meet's 69-year history.
The Cardinal went to the champi
onships in Indianapolis aspiring not only
to regain the NCAA crown after a four
year drought, but also to prove itself as
possibly the best collegiate swim team in
history.
"They took the best team there's ever
been in the sport to this meet," said Texas
coach Eddie Reese. "Their meet was just
phenomenal."
Stanford was led by senior captain and
world-record holder Jeff Rouse, who ended
his collegiate career by setting five Ameri
can records. Rouse won three individual
events and swam on three winning relay
teams during the three-day meet, held
Thursday through Saturday.

"I ended my career with a meet that I
couldn't have scripted better," Rouse said.
"This was my ultimate challenge and the
reward has been fantastic."
Rouse captured the individual title in
the 200-yard backstroke, leading Cardinal
swimmers Brian Retterer in fourth place
and Derek Weatherford in fifth. He won
with a record time of 1:40.64, nearly two
seconds faster than his time in the prelim
inaries, which also beat the standing
American record.
Rouse was equally impressive in the
100 back, winning in 46.12 and earning
another national record, followed by Ret
terer in second.
One of three collegiate swimmers to
qualify for the U.S. Olympic Team, Rouse
showed his versatility by winning the 200
Individual Medley, followed by teammates
Trip Zedlitz and Weatherford in third and
fifth, respectively.
Rouse also demonstrated his prowess as
a relay swimmer, anchoring the 400-free
relay team comprised of Retterer, Erik
Maurer and John deGroot. The group was
Stanford's first victorious team in that
