# Our cup runneth over: Lake Lag to be filled after a soggy winter
##

Yes, it really does hold water.
Lake Lagunita will be full and avail
able for recreational use this spring, after
a stormy end of winter. An afternoon life
guard will go on duty April 7, and a truck
is scheduled to dump sand on the lake's
grassy shores this week.
The lake's current nine feet of water
is largely runoff from its own watershed

and from Felt Lake, a reservoir in the
Foothills, according to Dennis Culp, asso
ciate vice president for facilities.
In addition, the facilities department
has been pumping excess water into the
lake from San Francisquito Creek.
The Lake Commission, which regulates
lake use and policy, decided Friday to allow
the lake to fill up to its nine-foot capacity.
"We can't go above nine feet because
then we have the potential for a safety
problem," said Culp, noting that the

man-made lake was designed to hold only
that much water.
If the water level rises above nine feet,
"we will have to drain some of it out," he
said.
The lake is mainly being filled for the
Athletic Department's use, according to
Culp. Students can sign up today for
windsurfing and sailing classes, sched
uled to begin on the lake April 7.
According to Blake Middleton, the
windsurfing and sailing instructor, his

classes were "among the most popular
classes on campus up until three years
ago," when low water levels forced them
to relocate off campus.
"It's much more convenient to do
[these activities! at Lake Lag," Culp said.
Yesterday, Stanford faculty, staff and
students and area residents were already
bringing their families and pets to the
lake to swim, raft and enjoy the view of
water — a rare sight in recent years
because of the drought.

However, Cu!p warned that "the lake
bed is pervious — it doesn't hold water
very well." He added that the lake's full
ness will depend on the weather and the
availability of excess water.
Culp said there is "no guarantee" that
water will remain in the lake indefinitely,
adding, "As long as we have water avail
able we will try to maintain a reasonable
water level [by pumping more into the
lake] for its recreational and educational
benefits."
