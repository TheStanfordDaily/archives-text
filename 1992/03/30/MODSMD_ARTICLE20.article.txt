# Final Four bound!
## Cardinal faces No. 1 Virginia in rematch of 1990 national semifinal 
### Tyson Vaughn Senior Staff Writer 
SEATTLE — The Stanford women's basketball team picked a
heck of a time to achieve its collective goal of hitting 12 three
pointers in one game.
Saturday in Hec Edmundson Pavilion, led by NCAA West
Regional MVP Molly Goodenbour's six treys, the Cardinal
bombed USC back to Los Angeles, 82-62, where the Trojans will
play host to Stanford's third consecutive Final Four appearance
this weekend.
USC coach Marianne Stanley successfully shut down Pacific
10 Conference Player of the Year Val Waiting, holding the center
to 13 points below her average. But the Cardinal backcourt shot
down Stanley's dream of leading USC to its first Final Four since
1986.
"We knew we were taking a gamble, giving up the outside
shot," Stanley said. "But I thought that if they shot in the low
40's or lower, we would have had a game. Obviously they shot
very well."
Stanford's two leading outside shooters, Goodenbour and
Christy Hedgpeth, possessed season three-point shooting aver
ages in the low 40's but they nailed 57.9 percent of their bombs
over the Trojans' 2-3 zone. Goodenbour's six treys tied an NCAA
tournament individual record with, among others, 1990 Stanford
graduate Katy Steding.
The team's 12 three-pointers broke the NCAA tournament
team record of 11 achieved by, among others, Stanford in the
1990 NCAA final.
Despite the record fireworks, Stanley predicted that other
teams will zone the Cardinal in the future, including Stanford's
semifinal opponent, top-ranked Virginia.
"If Val Whiting goes two for eight 10 times, we'll win more
often than we'll lose," she said.
"This team hasn't seen a lot of zone this year," said Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer. "But getting ready for (West Regional
Semifinal opponent) Texas Tech really helped us, because we
worked against the zone all week in practice." The Lady Raiders
had been known for their 2-3 zone defense.
USC began the game with a bang. The Trojans played their
zone defense to perfection and cut through the Cardinal press to
get easy baskets on fast breaks. But once VanDerveer made some
offensive adjustments, Stanford roared ahead.
"We moved Christy from Lisa Leslie's side, and Molly just took
a step back," she said.
With the 6-foot-5 Leslie coming out on one side of the perime
ter, the Cardinal bombed from the other side.
"Molly's key contribution," Stanley said, "was not so much
her threes, but her great defense. That is why she is the MVP."
Goodenbour limited USC's All-Pac-10 point guard Tammy
Story to two of nine shots, and forced three turnovers. Story also
had to deal with foul trouble during the second half, eventually
disqualifying with six minutes left.
Leslie was even scarcer for the Trojans, as she played only
about seven minutes in the second half and fouled out with nine
minutes left to play.
"The biggest thing," Stanley said, "is that they have a lot of
weapons to use. You have to decide what you're going to take
away and what you're going to sacrifice. They were coming from
Tacoma with those jump shots."
Stanford 75, Texas Tech 63
When Stanford faced a home-grown Texan team, it was a Car
dinal player from Austin who dominated the game. Freshman
Rachel Hemmer racked up 21 points, eight rebounds and three
steals in leading Stanford to a 75-63 victory last Thursday in
Seattle.
Hemmer, who also got 15 points and nine rebounds against
USC, was the other Cardinal player named All-Regional, in addi
tion to Goodenbour.
The Lady Raiders employed a 2-3 match-up zone, triple-team
ing Whiting to force outside shots, much as the Trojans did on
Saturday. But Whiting slid outside to give Hemmer room on the
baseline and at the post. She also scored 17 points and grabbed
11 rebounds despite the triple-teams.

While Hedgpeth struggled somewhat outside, Goodenbour
chalked up five treys out of 11 attempts and scored 19 points
total. Her three-game tournament total of 13 treys is one short of
the record held by Steding.
But one of the biggest keys for Stanford was the defense of for
ward Chris MacMurdo, who held 6-foot wundergard Sheryl
Swoopes to 17 points, five points below her average. Swoopes, the
Junior College National Player of the Year last year, and the
Sports Illustrated National Player of the Year in the Division I
this year, never seemed to hit the shots when they counted.
The other big key was rebounding. The Cardinal outworked
the Raiders on the boards, 43-25, negating a poor shooting night
(41 percent, compared to Texas Tech's 49 percent).
Stanford 82, UC-Santa Barbara 73
The Gauchos gave the Cardinal the toughest game of the
tournament so far on March 21 in a second-round game in
Maples Pavilion, pushing Stanford to the limit in an 82-73 loss.
The never-say-die Big West Conference champions took a 17-
4 Stanford second-half run in the gut and came back from 14
behind with 8:21 on the clock to within three at 3:26.
But an open back-door play to Rachel Hemmer took some
wind out of the Gauchos, and the Cardinal reopened its lead. But
Santa Barbara continued to fight even when half of its roster had
fouled out and only four players were left on the floor.
Stanford 83, California 81
The regular season ended with one of the most thrilling games
of the year in Maples on March 13. Stanford clinched its third
outright Pac-10 title in four years and assured itself a No. 1 seed
in the NCAAs when it defeated rival California 83-81 in a down
to-the-wire finish.
Both of Stanford's home-court losses in the last four years
have come on last-second shots. With the Bears gaining posses
sion of the ball with only seconds to go, it looked as if it might
happen again.
But Whiting blocked a Milica Vukadinovic jumper with four
seconds left and then stole the ball from Vukadinovic after the
guard had recovered her own rebound.
It was salvation of sorts for Whiting. The previous year, Wash
ington guard Laura Moore had taken the ball from Waiting's
hands and sunk a buzzer-beater that ended Stanford's 42-game
home court winning streak.
The block and steal also stymied Vukadinovic's superhuman
performance. The 6-foot-1 point guard took over the game in the
final minutes, outscoring every other player on the floor 17-12,
and pouring in 24 of her 29 points in the second half.

Hemmer, who also got 15 points and nine rebounds against
USC, was the other Cardinal player named All-Regional, in addi
tion to Goodenbour.
The Lady Raiders employed a 2-3 match-up zone, triple-team
ing Whiting to force outside shots, much as the Trojans did on
Saturday. But Whiting slid outside to give Hemmer room on the
baseline and at the post. She also scored 17 points and grabbed
11 rebounds despite the triple-teams.

While Hedgpeth struggled somewhat outside, Goodenbour
chalked up five treys out of 11 attempts and scored 19 points
total. Her three-game tournament total of 13 treys is one short of
the record held by Steding.
But one of the biggest keys for Stanford was the defense of for
ward Chris MacMurdo, who held 6-foot wundergard Sheryl
Swoopes to 17 points, five points below her average. Swoopes, the
Junior College National Player of the Year last year, and the
Sports Illustrated National Player of the Year in the Division I
this year, never seemed to hit the shots when they counted.
The other big key was rebounding. The Cardinal outworked
the Raiders on the boards, 43-25, negating a poor shooting night
(41 percent, compared to Texas Tech's 49 percent).
Stanford 82, UC-Santa Barbara 73
The Gauchos gave the Cardinal the toughest game of the
tournament so far on March 21 in a second-round game in
Maples Pavilion, pushing Stanford to the limit in an 82-73 loss.
The never-say-die Big West Conference champions took a 17-
4 Stanford second-half run in the gut and came back from 14
behind with 8:21 on the clock to within three at 3:26.
But an open back-door play to Rachel Hemmer took some
wind out of the Gauchos, and the Cardinal reopened its lead. But
Santa Barbara continued to fight even when half of its roster had
fouled out and only four players were left on the floor.
Stanford 83, California 81
The regular season ended with one of the most thrilling games
of the year in Maples on March 13. Stanford clinched its third
outright Pac-10 title in four years and assured itself a No. 1 seed
in the NCAAs when it defeated rival California 83-81 in a down
to-the-wire finish.
Both of Stanford's home-court losses in the last four years
have come on last-second shots. With the Bears gaining posses
sion of the ball with only seconds to go, it looked as if it might
happen again.
But Whiting blocked a Milica Vukadinovic jumper with four
seconds left and then stole the ball from Vukadinovic after the
guard had recovered her own rebound.
It was salvation of sorts for Whiting. The previous year, Wash
ington guard Laura Moore had taken the ball from Waiting's
hands and sunk a buzzer-beater that ended Stanford's 42-game
home court winning streak.
The block and steal also stymied Vukadinovic's superhuman
performance. The 6-foot-1 point guard took over the game in the
final minutes, outscoring every other player on the floor 17-12,
and pouring in 24 of her 29 points in the second half.

Another bench celebration: the women whoop it up during
the Cardinal's 83-81 regular season-ending triumph over the
Golden Bears.
SEATTLE — The Stanford women's basketball team picked a
heck of a time to achieve its collective goal of hitting 12 three
pointers in one game.
Saturday in Hec Edmundson Pavilion, led by NCAA West
Regional MVP Molly Goodenbour's six treys, the Cardinal
bombed USC back to Los Angeles, 82-62, where the Trojans will
play host to Stanford's third consecutive Final Four appearance
this weekend.
USC coach Marianne Stanley successfully shut down Pacific
10 Conference Player of the Year Val Waiting, holding the center
to 13 points below her average. But the Cardinal backcourt shot
down Stanley's dream of leading USC to its first Final Four since
1986.
"We knew we were taking a gamble, giving up the outside
shot," Stanley said. "But I thought that if they shot in the low
40's or lower, we would have had a game. Obviously they shot
very well."
Stanford's two leading outside shooters, Goodenbour and
Christy Hedgpeth, possessed season three-point shooting aver
ages in the low 40's but they nailed 57.9 percent of their bombs
over the Trojans' 2-3 zone. Goodenbour's six treys tied an NCAA
tournament individual record with, among others, 1990 Stanford
graduate Katy Steding.
The team's 12 three-pointers broke the NCAA tournament
team record of 11 achieved by, among others, Stanford in the
1990 NCAA final.
Despite the record fireworks, Stanley predicted that other
teams will zone the Cardinal in the future, including Stanford's
semifinal opponent, top-ranked Virginia.
"If Val Whiting goes two for eight 10 times, we'll win more
often than we'll lose," she said.
"This team hasn't seen a lot of zone this year," said Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer. "But getting ready for (West Regional
Semifinal opponent) Texas Tech really helped us, because we
worked against the zone all week in practice." The Lady Raiders
had been known for their 2-3 zone defense.
USC began the game with a bang. The Trojans played their
zone defense to perfection and cut through the Cardinal press to
get easy baskets on fast breaks. But once VanDerveer made some
offensive adjustments, Stanford roared ahead.
"We moved Christy from Lisa Leslie's side, and Molly just took
a step back," she said.
With the 6-foot-5 Leslie coming out on one side of the perime
ter, the Cardinal bombed from the other side.
"Molly's key contribution," Stanley said, "was not so much
her threes, but her great defense. That is why she is the MVP."
Goodenbour limited USC's All-Pac-10 point guard Tammy
Story to two of nine shots, and forced three turnovers. Story also
had to deal with foul trouble during the second half, eventually
disqualifying with six minutes left.
Leslie was even scarcer for the Trojans, as she played only
about seven minutes in the second half and fouled out with nine
minutes left to play.
"The biggest thing," Stanley said, "is that they have a lot of
weapons to use. You have to decide what you're going to take
away and what you're going to sacrifice. They were coming from
Tacoma with those jump shots."
Stanford 75, Texas Tech 63
When Stanford faced a home-grown Texan team, it was a Car
dinal player from Austin who dominated the game. Freshman
Rachel Hemmer racked up 21 points, eight rebounds and three
steals in leading Stanford to a 75-63 victory last Thursday in
Seattle.
Hemmer, who also got 15 points and nine rebounds against
USC, was the other Cardinal player named All-Regional, in addi
tion to Goodenbour.
