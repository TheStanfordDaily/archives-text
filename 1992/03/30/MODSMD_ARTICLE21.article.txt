# Bravin wins foil championship as fencers take sixth at NCAAs
## 
### George Malone Editorial Staff 
Look out, East Coast schools. The
Stanford fencing team served notice last
week at the NCAA Championships that
sunny California can produce more than
just nice tans and dominant volleyball
teams. The Cardinal showed that it can
not only compete with traditional fencing
powers such as Penn State and Harvard,
but also that it can beat them.
Led by 1992 Men's Foil champion
Nick Bravin, who was undefeated for the

entire season, Stanford fought its way to
an admirable eighth-place showing at the
NCAA Tournament in South Bend, Ind.
Bravin and Leonard D'Amico gained Ail-
American honors in foil and sabre,
respectively, and the Cardinal qualified
an impressive six individuals for NCAA
honors. Stanford women's coach Sherry
Posthumus also was named the women's
NCAA Coach of the Year.
After breezing through the rest of the
competition, Bravin's victory in the finals
over Kwame Vanlewen, a freshman at
Harvard, was a fierce match, men's coach

Zoran Tulum said.
"It was a hard bout because there was
so much pressure on those two guys,"
Tulum said.
Bravin, who also won the foil event in
1990, is the youngest fencer to ever win
NCAAs, Posthumus said.
"He's just a baby, for fencing any
way," she said.
The next day in the sabre, D'Amico
almost became Stanford's next champi
on. In the best two-out-of-three format
he lost twice by only one touch, 6-5, 5-6,
6-5 to place sixth overall. His two losses

were to Thomas Starzalkowsky, the
eventual champion, and Peter Nazlimov,
last year's winner, both of Penn State.
"Leonard deserved to win the title,"
said Tulum.
After the grueling individual bouts,
the Cardinal suffered a slight letdown in
team competition the next day. Both
Bravin and D'Amico were sluggish in
their respective events at first, and the
slow start cost Stanford somewhat.
The Cardinal placed fifth, losing each
bout by the score of 5-4.
It was the same situation in men's

sabre as D'Amico came out weakly at
first before regaining his composure.
Once again the team lost both its match
es 5-4 and finished sixth overall.
Men's epee member David Brody and
women's foil member Lana Kang con
tributed to help the Stanford team to an
eighth-place finish overall, bettering last
year's twelfth-place showing.
Bravin will probably go to the
Olympics in Barcelona in foil. The trials
are in April and June, with the top three
fencers making the team, Posthumus
said.
