# Women crush Longhorns
## 
### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's swimming team completed
their dream season over Spring Break, outclassing the
rest of the field and winning the 1992 NCAA title con
vincingly over the second-place Longhorns of Texas,
735.5-651.
Texas had won the meet in each of the past two sea
sons and was expected to be the Cardinal's main com
petition in the event. However, despite having taken
the early lead in the contest, the Longhorns could sim
ply not keep up with Stanford's dynamic swimmers.
The Cardinal began the meet by digging a huge hole
for itself as freshman sensation Jenny Thompson
flinched before the starter's gun in the 200 freestyle
relay and was called for a false start.
The Cardinal had been heavily favored in that
event, so the team's automatic disqualification cost
them the 40 points that a victory would have earned.
The loss, rather than disheartening the Cardinal,
may actually have served to enhance the team's per
formance throughout the rest of the meet.
"(The disqualification) just made us madder,"
Senior Karen Kraemer said. "It really made us fight."
Kraemer went on to score in four events, including a
first-place finish in the 800 freestyle relay with Lea
Loveless, Janel Jorgensen, and Thompson.
The team made up some of the ground that it had
lost and trailed by thirty points by the end of the first
day of swimming.
Top Stanford scorers were: Summer Sanders, who
won the 200 individual medley in 1:55.54 (an NCAA
record); Jenny Thompson, who won the 50 free in
22:14; Sanders, Thompson, Loveless, and Lori Heisick,
who won the 400 medley relay in a time of 3:35.64
paced by Loveless' American-record leadoff leg of 52.79
seconds; Eileen Richetelli, who took third-place honors
in one-meter diving with a score of 417.45, and Krae
mer, who took fifth in the 500 free in 4:44.97.
It was on the event's second day that the Cardinal
began to take firm control. Paced by four first-place fin
ishers, two seconds and one third, the Cardinal seized
the overall lead in the meet and never looked back.
Sanders won her third event, the 400 IM, in 4:02.28
(an American record). Loveless took first in the 100
backstroke in 52.82 seconds. Richetelli won the 3-
meter competition with a score 0f536.30, and the team
rounded out the day with their victory in the 800 free
relay.
Jorgensen took second place in the 100 butterfly

with a time of 52.80 seconds, and Thompson took sec
ond in the 200 freestyle, finishing in 1:43.61. Kendra
Thayer finished third in the 400 EM with a time of
4:12.44. Lori Heisick led all Stanford finishers in the
100 breaststroke, finishing sixth with a time of 1:01.70.
Stanford notched four more victories on the meet's
third and final day to seal the victory. Thompson won
the 100 free convincingly, setting an American record
with atime of 47.61. Sanders won the 200 fly in 1:53.42
seconds. Richetelli completed a fantastic meet with a
victory in the platform event, defeating teammate
Kristin Jensen with a score off 582.90. Jensen scored a
512.35 to take second.

'It's easy to rest on your laurels.
Two years ago, we were set up to
win (NCAA's), but we were over
confident and finished second.'
â€” Karen Kraemer

Loveless took second place in the 200 back in
1:54.45, and Kraemer finished third in the grueling
1650 free with a time of 16:18.23. Lori Heisick finished
in third place in the 200 breast in 2:12.31.
In the meet's final event, the 400 free relay, Mary
Edwards, Sanders, Jorgensen, and Thompson, took
first place in 3:16.41 seconds long after Stanford had
already clinched the national title.
Florida finished a distant third at the contest with
294 points. The Gators were followed by SMU, Ari
zona, UCLA, Michigan, Auburn, Georgia, and Min
nesota.
Although Stanford entered the meet as the clear
favorites, the victory was anything but automatic. The
team could not relax for a moment until victory had
been assured.
"It's easy to rest on your laurels," Kraemer said.
"Two years ago, we were set up to win (NCAA's), but
we were overconfident and finished second." The next
year, Texas simply proved to be the better of the two
archrivals, but finally in 1992 Stanford turned the
tables on the Longhorns, clearly proving that they
were the best team in the water.
With the victory, Stanford ended Texas' two-year
reign atop the NCAA, and earned the bragging rights
befitting the national champions.
