# Tide proves too much for Card, 80-75

CINCINNATI— Senior Ail-
American Adam Keefe carried
Stanford back to the NCAA Tour
nament, but his second journey to
the tourney was as short as the
first.
Keefe scored a game-high 23

points in his final college game,
but fifth-seed Alabama eliminated
twelfth-seed Stanford 80-75 in
the first round of the Southeast
regional. Predicted to finish near
the bottom of the Pacific 10 Con
ference, Stanford finished with an
18-11 overall record and only its
second invitation to the NCAA
Tournament since a l942nation

al championship.
"I would have loved to go on,
and we could have won this
game," said Keefe, who ended his
career as Stanford's all-time lead
ing rebounder and second all-time
scorer. "But everybody goes out
somewhere. We did a good job get
ting here. Stanford basketball is
at a new level."
Stanford played one of its best
games of the year, but aggressive
Alabama played just a little better
before 16,000 fans at Cincinnati's
Riverfront Coliseum.
Stanford out-rebounded Alaba
ma 33-28, turned it over just 12
times and shot a torrid 10-of-20
from 3-point territory, but the
Crimson Tide absorbed every
thing the Cardinal could give.
After four second-half lead
changes, Alabama point guard
James Robinson settled matters
with a gutsy 3-pointer. His 21-
footer over Marcus Lollie gave
Alabama a 76-69 lead with 1:34
remaining.
There wasn't much more Stan
ford could do against an athleti
cally superior team that was
shooting well. Alabama (26-9),
which lost to North Carolina two
days later, was on a roll after fin
ishing second in the Southeastern
Conference tournament.
"We didn't play badly. Had
they not played well we would
have beaten them," said Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery after his
second Tournament visit in four
seasons.
"This was fun. No matter how
you slice it, being in the NCAA
Tournament was fun. We want to
be back. Right now I'm very, very
proud of the progress of this bas
ketball team. We have nothing to
hang our heads about," he said.
After trailing by as much as
eight points in the first half, Stan
ford took charge in the second
stanza with 56 percent shooting,
including 9-of-14 from 3-point

territory. Point guard Marcus
Lollie iced four second-half treys

'We made some very
small mistakes. A long
rebound here, a loose
ball there. That was
the difference.'

and forward Brent Williams did
not miss from the field as Stan
ford shot ahead 51-44.
But back-to-back three-point
ers from Crimson Tide forward
Latrell Sprewell quickly closed
the gap, and his fifth trey of the
day put Alabama ahead for good,
66-64 with five minutes left.
"We'd have a five-point burst,
then they'd have a six-point
burst. That's how it was to the
wire," said Williams, who tied a
career high with 22 points on 10-
of-13 shooting.
Unlike an 80-78 upset defeat to
Siena in the 1989 Tournament,
the team didn't feel disappointed
with the effort. There were no
threats, tantrums or tears after
the loss. Despite the distractions
of finals, the Cardinal came ready
to play.
"When I saw them on tape I
knew we could beat them," said
Keefe. "We were right there. It
wasn't a fluke. We made some
very small mistakes. A long
rebound here, a loose ball there.
That was the difference."
