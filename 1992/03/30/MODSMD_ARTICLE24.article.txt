# Keefe leaves with several records

### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Adam Keefe fell 17 points short of
the Stanford career scoring record, but
he leaves the Farm as one of the most
honored players in Stanford basketball
history.
With 23 points and nine rebounds in
the NCAA Tournament game, Keefe
completed his career with 2,319 points,
1,119 rebounds and 141 steals in 125
games. He holds 16 school and one Pac
-10 record.
Keefe is Stanford's all-time leading
rebounder and second to Todd Lichti
(2,336) in scoring.
Keefe (25.4 points, 12.4 boards per
game) and Shaquille O'Neal of LSU
were the only two players to be in the
top 25 nationally in scoring and
rebounding this year.
Keefe and Lichti played together in
1988-89 when Stanford went 26-7 and
was ranked No. 12 in the nation. Lichti
now plays for the Denver Nuggets.

Although Keefe was second in the
Pacific 10 Conference in scoring, first
in rebounding, fourth in field goal per
centage and third in steals, he lost the
Player of the Year race to flashy junior
Harold Miner of USC.
Miner averaged 26.7 points and 7.2
rebounds per game, but shot 44 percent
from the field and had a one-to-two
assist-turnover ratio.
"Miner is a great player and Keefe is
a great player, and I congratulate
Harold. But in my mind Keefe is MVP
and always will be," said Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery.
Joining Keefe on the All-Pac-10
team were Don Mac Lean and Tracy
Murray of UCLA, Duane Cooper of
USC, Chris Mills and Sean Rooks of
Arizona, Terrence Lewis of Washington
State, Scott Haskin of Oregon State
and Brian Hendrick of California.
Mark Pope of Washington was
named Freshman of the Year and
George Raveling of USC Coach of the
Year.

Keefe has been named an Ail-Ameri
can by two basketball publications.
Basketball Weekly named him Second
Team with Mac Lean, Byron Houston of
Oklahoma State, Todd Day of Arkansas
and Walt Williams of Maryland.
O'Neal, Christian Laettner of Duke,
Alonzo Mourning of Georgetown,
Jimmy Jackson of Ohio State and
Miner were First Team. Basketball
Times named Keefe Third Team Ail-
American.
Card Notes
Defense and rebounding were the
key to Stanford's success. Stanford was
tops in the Pac-10 in scoring defense,
allowing 67.5 points per game, while fifth
in scoring offense at 75.7. Stanford was
second in rebounding and rebounding
margin behind Arizona.
Finally, Stanford was third in three
point field goal percentage (39.3), but
attempted the fewest in the conference
(303). For comparison, uninhibited USC
made 218 of 574 (38 percent).


Marcus Lollle and Peter Dukes will need more than an occasional helping hand next
year to offset the loss of Keefe, who will leave the Farm with 16 school records in hand.
