# Gymnasts win despite Ryan's injury
## 
### Scott Reiss Staff Writer 
The Stanford men's gymnastics team did what it was
expected to do last weekend, breezing through the Pac
-10 tournament at Maples Center to win its second con
ference title in three years.
No other school came close to the No. 1 ranked Car
dinal in the team competition on Friday, as Stanford
beat last year's champion, UCLA, by seven points. Cal
finished a distant third.
"The team did excellent, and I am very satisfied,"
said coach Sadao Hamada, who was recently named
Pac-10 Coach of the Year. "I have a good feeling that we
can go all the way and win the NCAA championship."
Stanford also showed well in the all-around competi
tion, as junior Jeff Bender finished third and freshman
Josh Stein took fourth-place overall. Pac-10 Player of
the Year Jair Lynch was leading at the conclusion of
Friday's events, but faltered in two events on Saturday.
Lynch, however, put on quite a one-man show in the
individual finals, winning three events. He scored a
near-perfect 9.9 on both the pommel horse and the high
bar, while achieving a winning score of 9.6 in the vault
ing competition.
The Cardinal was able to win the tournament with
out much help from one of their top competitors, Tim
Ryan. Ryan, the only senior on the squad, was limited
to just two events due to a bruised heel which was caus
ing him a great deal of pain.
"We knew we could beat UCLA without him,"
remarked Coach Hamada, "but it is important to have
a healthy Tim Ryan for Regionals and NCAAs."
The gymnasts will head to Alberquerque, New Mex
ico in two weeks for the Western Regionals. The top
four teams from that tournament will then go on to
compete in the NCAA finals in Lincoln, Nebraska.

It was merely another day at the gym for Jair Lynch and the rest of the Stanford
men's gymnastics squad during the Pacific 10 Conference Championships Friday
at Maples Pavilion. Lynch, Pac-10 Gymnast of the Year, captured three individual
titles (high bar, pommel horse, and vault), and the Cardinal breezed to its second
conference title in three years.
