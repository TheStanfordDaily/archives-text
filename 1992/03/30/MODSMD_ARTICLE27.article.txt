# Card splits in desert
## 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
Stanford Baseball performed
a Jekyll and Hyde act in Tucson
yesterday, splitting a double
header against the Arizona
Wildcats at Frank Samcet Field.
In the first game, the Cardi
nal (20-10 on the season)
picked up 12 hits but could not
produce runs in a 5-2 defeat.
Mike Schiefelbein struck out
seven and walked three to push
his record to 5-0. Carlos Rico
entered the game with two outs
in the sixth inning and finished
up to earn the save.
Rick Helling struggled in his
first start since beating UCLA
the weekend before, giving up
five runs and 13 hits while
striking out three. The loss was
only his second of the season
against six wins. The Cardi
nal's main problem, however,
was their lack of scoring punch.
David Cornell was the only
standout at the plate, going
three- for-four and driving in
both Stanford runs.
Mark Skeels, Steve Solomon,
and Chris Kemper each picked
up two hits in the first game but

could not bunch them together
for runs. The nightcap was a
different story, with the bats
springing to life and a torrent
crossing home plate. Stanford
punished four different Arizona
pitchers in a 15-3 rout.
Chris Kemper shined, pick
ing up three hits, including a
double and a homer, and driv
ing in four runs. On the pitch
ing side, sophomore Willie
Adams went the distance,
striking out five while scatter
ing seven hits to pick up his
fourth win of the year.
The Cardinal will play the
third and final game of the
series today before returning
home. Heavy rains washed out
play on Friday and Saturday
and pushed the games back.
The Arizona series was not
the only action Stanford base
ball saw over spring break. The
weekend before, the Cardinal
took two out of three games
against the Bruins at UCLA.
Last Wednesday, they dropped
a close 5-4 decision against
then eleventh-ranked Pepper
dine. All of this has happened
without star centerfielder Jef
frey Hammonds.
