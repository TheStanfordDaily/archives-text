# Track performs well
## 
### Nick Clements Staff writer 
There was a lot of sunny, balmy weather
for track and field fans last Friday and Sat
urday at the Stanford Invite as approximate
ly 3000 athletes from the ranks of high
school, college, and beyond flooded Stanford
Stadium to participate in one of the top track
and field invites in the United States today.
The meet was highlighted by a two hour
Pacific 10 — Big 10 Challenge on Saturday
that featured the strongest athletes from
both conferences. The Pac-10 won by a score
of 58 to 48.
Stanford senior and NCAA women's
indoor sprint champion Chryste Gaines
shined again as she and USC's Inger Miller
led the Pac-10 to an easy victory in the 100-
meter dash. Gaines and Miller finished in a
dead heat three weeks ago in Los Angeles,
but this time Gaines was the clear victor as
she hit the finish line in 11.34 seconds to
Miller's 11.58.
Jackie Edwards, another Cardinal star
athelete, took second in the triple jump as
the Pac-10 recorded a 9-0 shutout in that
event. Edwards had also won the long jump
on Friday in separate competition with a leap
of 20-feet,lo-inches, showing no signs of
slacking off after capturing the NCAA indoor
long jump title two weeks ago.
Stanford's Fred Carter placed second to
Arizona's Martin Keino in the 3000-meter
steeplechase, leading the Pac-10 to a 9-0
shutout in that event. Other Cardinal ath
letes who excelled during the challenge were
Alex Accetta and Susan Helfter, who ran legs
for the winning men and women's 4-by-880
Pac-10 relay teams.
In competition previous to the Pac-10 —

Big Ten challenge, Stanford's Travis Clark
qualified for the Pac-10 Track and Field
Championships in the high jump on Friday
as he won with a leap of 6-feet, 10-and-3/4
inches.
"I think the main appeal of the Invite was
the overall ambience, the overall fun," said
Stanford head track coach Brooks Johnson.
"There weren't any sinister aspects to the
meet. Everyone was relaxed, having a good
time."
However, despite the fun aspects of bring
ing together athletes from all ranks, the
meet was not without some controversy.
Butch Reynolds, world record-holder in the
400 meters, had been hoping to participate in
an exhibition race at some point during the
weekend but instead had to settle on a train
ing run. Reynolds is currently undergoing a
two-year suspension from the International
Amateur Athletic Federation for illegal
steroid use.
Johnson, who is Reynolds' coach, said
that Reynolds was in risk of violating the
suspension if he officially participated in the
meet. Reynolds has denied ever using any
performance-enhancing drugs and actually is
appealing his suspension in order to partici
pate in the 1992 Summer Olympics in
Barcelona.
Reynolds wasn't the only world-class ath
lete at the Stadium this past weekend.
Robert Weir in the hammer throw, PattiSue
Plumer in the 1,500 meters, and Andre
Phillips in the 200-meter dash were also on
hand this weekend to add to the festivities. A
passing high school athlete summed up the
vast talent level on hand when he said to a
friend, "You know, I think I'd do a lot better
in the hammer throw if I just let Weir throw
me AND the hammer."
