# Women's gym places fifth at Pac 10's

Call it good timing. Call it vast improvement over
the course of the season. Call it good luck, even.
The Stanford Cardinal women's gymnastics team
enjoyed two successful meets over spring break and has
put itself in position to do some damage when it really
counts.
After defeating San Jose State and Sacramento
State in a three-way meet on March 21, the Cardinal
performed solidly in the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onship meet last Saturday at Tucson, Arizona.
For their efforts, head coach Breck Greenwood's
charges have earned a third seed in the West regional
national championship qualifier, to be held April 11 in
Berkeley; a good showing there could get the Cardinal
an invitation to the NCAA Championship meet, the
ultimate destination for an up-and-coming program.
In San Jose, Stanford continued its season-long
record-setting ways at the expense of two already-over
matched competitors, establishing three new school
marks by the end of the evening.
The Cardinal's team all-around score of 192.45 shat
tered its previous high of 191.75, which had been post
ed just two weeks earlier in a loss to Penn State.
Two Stanford bests were also achieved by the squad
in the vault and floor exercise competitions, where five
person 47.70 and 48.80 totals, respectively, rounded
out the "cycle" for the 1992 team, which has now bro
ken school records in all four women's disciplines.
The team's performance in its final regular-season
competition actually startled its coach, who didn't
think the Cardinal had come into the meet fully pre
pared.
"The real accomplishment of that meet was that
it came after dead week and finals, when NCAA and
Stanford rules prevented us from having mandatory
practices," Greenwood said. "There was no reason
for them to be confident after a virtual two-week lay
off."
Individual highlights for the Cardinal included

freshman Jene Elzie's 38.90 all-around mark, a first
place score that included a 9.80 on the balance beam;
sophomore Kerri Kanuka's 38.60 second-place finish,
which included a 9.70 in the vault, a 9.80 on the
uneven bars, and a 9.90 on the floor; and freshman
Katie Clancy's solid 38.15 all-around score, good for
third place and a Stanford sweep of the all-around com
petition.
In the Pac-10 meet, following a week of spring break
practices, the Cardinal repeated its fifth-place finish of
a year ago, but against a much stronger conference
field. Stanford's 191.20 total ranked the squad behind
national powerhouse Oregon State, homestanding Ari
zona, UCLA, and Arizona State.
The Cardinal got off to what Greenwood dubbed a
"consistent, good start" by posting a 47.50 in the vault.
Freshman Meegan Lannin posted a personal-best 9.40
in the event, while Clancy and Elzie earned solid 9.65
and 9.75 tallies, respectively.
Next came a 47.70 performance on the bars which
Greenwood tabbed as "not perfect, but not bad," and
which featured a 9.45 by sophomore Kerrie Kelley, who
was filling in for injured teammate Laurie West.
Stanford then garnered a 47.65 total on the beam,
an event which was led off by Kanuka's strong 9.65.
"Kerri went out there and competed like it was ten feet
wide," Greenwood later said.
Finally, the Cardinal gave what was by far their best
performance of the evening in the floor exercise com
petition.
Lannin reached a career-high 9.55 in the event,
while freshman Tina Snowden earned a 9.70 and
Kanuka and Elzie scored 9.75'5.
When it was all said and done, Kanuka had turned in
an excellent 38.70 total in the all-around, and Elzie had
earned a sixth-place tie with her 38.85.
Now it's on to the regional competition just a hop
across the bay next Saturday. "It's important that we
get people out to support us, to make it like a home
meet for us," Greenwood said. "The day we started
practice, we were preparing for the regionals. We think
we're peaking right when we need to."
