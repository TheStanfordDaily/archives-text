# Stanford hosts US-China soccer game
## 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
The United States National Soccer Team
will play China at 1:00 p.m. next Saturday at
Stanford Stadium. It will be the first time the
U.S. has played China since 1977.
The game is part of the national team's
preparations for the World Cup, to be hosted
by the United States in 1994. The team has
just finished a five-game tour of three conti
nents.
Stanford Stadium is one of nine sites select
ed for the 1994 Soccer World Cup Finals last
Monday by the Federation de Internationale
Football Association (FIFA), the world govern
ing body of soccer.
Stanford, the Rose Bowl in Pasadena and
the Cotton Bowl in Dallas will host first-round
games for two of the six four-team groups of
World Cup teams. Each stadium will host four
games.
"Stanford was a very successful venue" for
the 1984 Olympics soccer games, said Peter
Bridgwater, co-chair of the committee which
proposed Stanford and Candlestick Park in San
Francisco as possible venues for the games.
Bridgwater said it is important to bring
such a large soccer event to the Bay area.

In addition, he said, "Obviously there's a big
financial benefit to the Bay area of hosting the
World Cup." He estimated the event will bring
about $300 million into the area's hotels,
restaurants, public transportation and taxis.
"We've already booked ten thousand hotel
rooms," and some thirty to fifty thousand for
eign visitors are expected during the games,
Bridgwater said.
"It also gives Stanford the opportunity of
having improvements (to the stadium), some
of which may be permanent," he added.
The improvements would be financed by
the national and local organizing committees.
The World Cup, the championship of what
is considered the world's most popular sport, is
the most-watched sporting event.
The twenty-four finalists are made up of
thirteen European teams, four from South
America, three from Africa, two from North
and Central America and two from Asia and
Oceania.
The U.S. team qualifies automatically as
the host country, as does defending champion
Germany. The remaining teams will qualify by
winning regional games to be played between
now and summer, 1993.
Stanford has also made a bid to host the
opening ceremonies, as well as some second

round, quarterfinal and semifinal games.
Bridgwater said the likelihood that Stan
ford will host second-round games is "very
good" but that hosting the quarterfinals is less
likely.
"Eight of the nine venues (selected) are all
bidding" for the semifinals, Bridgwater said,
and "FIFA was concerned with Stanford's con
dition." The world body considered the stadi
um old and in need of work, he said.
That is why Bridgwater considers the U.S.
vs. China game next Saturday important.
"One way to counter [the] negatives in FIFA's
mind" about Stanford Stadium is to produce a
large turnout for the game, he said.
Bridgwater says that if Stanford gets one of
the semifinals "we'd sell it out." But proving
this to FIFA is another matter. So far, only
about fifteen thousand tickets have been sold.
"Ticket sales through Stanford have been
very disappointing," he said. Tickets are avail
able from the Athletics Department's ticket
office.
The game next Saturday is part of the U.S.
National Team's preparations for the World
Cup. Because the U.S. qualifies for the games
automatically, the team will not have played as
many games as some of the other teams by the
time the tournament begins.
