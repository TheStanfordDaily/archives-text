Stanford garners graduate honors
Stanford's Graduate School of Business was chosen the nation's top
business school in an annual evaluation of graduate schools conducted
by U.S. News & World Report. Stanford's psychology, history and eco
nomics graduate programs also garnered top honors in the survey.
The rankings were based on reputational surveys as well as
statistical data that measured such attributes as student selectiv
ity, faculty resources, placement success and graduation rate.
Other Stanford schools and graduate programs also ranked highly
on the list. Stanford's engineering school was second, its law school
third, and its medical school eighth. The graduate program in English
ranked third, political science ranked fourth and sociology was sixth.
Yale Law School, MlT's engineering program and Harvard
University's medical program also drew top honors.
Professor Gorbachev?
Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev will accept a one
day appointment as a visiting professor of law and deliver a pub
lic lecture in Memorial Auditorium on "The Rule of Law" when
he and his wife return to Stanford on May 9.
The Gorbachevs will also tour a Hoover Institution exhibit
assembled for their first campus visit on June 4,1990. Due to time
constraints, they were unable to see the exhibition on that trip.
Former Secretary of State George Shultz, a Hoover distin
guished fellow, and his wife will host the couple at their campus
home on May 8.
Arrangements for tickets to Gorbachev's lecture in Memorial
Auditorium have not been finalized. However, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy said a block of seats would be reserved for
Law School students, faculty and the school's board of visitors.
As part of a 16-day trip through the United States, the Gor
bachevs will visit seven major cities.
