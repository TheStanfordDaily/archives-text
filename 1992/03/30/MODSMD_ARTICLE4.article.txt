# The
						man they picked
## Stanford's next president a teacher first 
### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
Stanford's next president began his teaching
career at a county jail.
Gerhard Casper joined the Berkeley faculty as a
political science professor in 1964, at the birth of the
free speech movement. One morning early fall quar
ter, about half the students were missing from his
class of 150.
"I was told they were all in the Alameda County
jail," Casper said, characteristically deadpan. Appar
ently, the students had been arrested at a free
speech rally.
"The judge said he would release them on their
professor's recognizance," he explained. "So off I
marched to jail to get my students back."

When Casper becomes president Sept. 1, he will go to
bat for students again — by improving the quality of
undergraduate teaching. Casper, the provost and for
mer law school dean at the University of Chicago, said
he wants Stanford to be thought of not only as a great
research institution, but as a great teaching institution.
Teaching and research should not be at odds, he
said. "They are opposite sides of the same coin."
The first Stanford president in 25 years to be
brought in from the outside, Casper said he will
work closely with the University's next provost,
whom "I clearly want [to be] a person presently on
the Stanford faculty."
Stanford's "immensely complex" administration will
come under scrutiny as well. " 'Elimination' (of posi
tions) is an unkind word," he said — but it's possible.
The feasibility of need-blind admission will also
be examined, he said.
Casper, who is widely described as scholarly, witty
and diplomatic, was named Stanford's ninth president
March 17 after a highly secretive search process. The
Board of Trustees had approved the search commit
tee's choice in a telephone conference the day before.
Plucked from a pool of 677 nominees, Casper decid
ed to take the job after a long conversation March 16

with Board of Trustees President James Gaither, who
assured Casper that financial support would be avail
able for growth and "intellectual innovation."
"If the notion was that for the next few years the
administration had no other task but to reduce expen
ditures," Casper said, "the job was not for me."
Casper would not go into details of their discus
sion, but he said a fund-raising drive will begin
"almost immediately," an unusual move for a univer
sity that has just completed a major capital campaign.
He said he plans to implement fully the package of
budget cuts the University has negotiated this year.
