# The 						man they picked
## Stanford's next president a teacher first 
### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
Stanford's next president began his teaching
career at a county jail.
Gerhard Casper joined the Berkeley faculty as a
political science professor in 1964, at the birth of the
free speech movement. One morning early fall quar
ter, about half the students were missing from his
class of 150.
"I was told they were all in the Alameda County
jail," Casper said, characteristically deadpan. Appar
ently, the students had been arrested at a free
speech rally.
"The judge said he would release them on their
professor's recognizance," he explained. "So off I
marched to jail to get my students back."

When Casper becomes president Sept. 1, he will go to
bat for students again — by improving the quality of
undergraduate teaching. Casper, the provost and for
mer law school dean at the University of Chicago, said
he wants Stanford to be thought of not only as a great
research institution, but as a great teaching institution.
Teaching and research should not be at odds, he
said. "They are opposite sides of the same coin."
The first Stanford president in 25 years to be
brought in from the outside, Casper said he will
work closely with the University's next provost,
whom "I clearly want [to be] a person presently on
the Stanford faculty."
Stanford's "immensely complex" administration will
come under scrutiny as well. " 'Elimination' (of posi
tions) is an unkind word," he said — but it's possible.
The feasibility of need-blind admission will also
be examined, he said.
Casper, who is widely described as scholarly, witty
and diplomatic, was named Stanford's ninth president
March 17 after a highly secretive search process. The
Board of Trustees had approved the search commit
tee's choice in a telephone conference the day before.
Plucked from a pool of 677 nominees, Casper decid
ed to take the job after a long conversation March 16

with Board of Trustees President James Gaither, who
assured Casper that financial support would be avail
able for growth and "intellectual innovation."
"If the notion was that for the next few years the
administration had no other task but to reduce expen
ditures," Casper said, "the job was not for me."
Casper would not go into details of their discus
sion, but he said a fund-raising drive will begin
"almost immediately," an unusual move for a univer
sity that has just completed a major capital campaign.
He said he plans to implement fully the package of
budget cuts the University has negotiated this year.

"I would be utterly foolhardy to intervene in that
process that has been about the most thorough
debate of such issues that I have seen at any Ameri
can university," he said.
Casper said although they did not negotiate a
change in the endowment payout rate, the topic will
be approached "with an open mind."
A whirlwind tour
The swift selection came three months before the
search committee's deadline, which Executive Vice
Chair Jean Fetter called "ambitious." Shortly after
accepting the post, Casper packed three shirts, one
warm suit and one light suit and rushed to the air
port.
He spent a dizzying six days at Stanford, meeting
the press, Nobel laureates, board members and phi
lanthropist David Packard. His wife Regina, a psy
chiatrist, joined him for the weekend, when he
caught his first Stanford basketball game.
By Saturday, the schedule had just about
exhausted Casper. After a 45-minute photo session,
during which he posed under bright lights and sev
eral sets of sandstone arches, Casper's humor
emerged as a defense mechanism.
"On Thursday I sat in this office trying to deter
mine what day it was," Casper said. He pulled out a
calendar to demonstrate. "But all these appoint
ments were for Chicago."
Stooping to pick up some yellow post-it notes that
fell out of his pocket, he recalled that he only knew
it was Thursday because he saw his picture on the
front page of the San Francisco Chronicle.
Taking on teaching
During his visit, Casper stressed his commitment
to improving the quality of teaching at Stanford. His
own fame as a teacher with a good sense of humor
seems surprising given his traditional academic
background and upright, deliberate bearing.
A graduate of German universities in Freiburg
and Hamburg, Casper came to the United States to
study law — and remained because he was "capti
vated" by American universities. He graduated from
Yale Law School in 1962, then taught political sci
ence at UC-Berkeley. Since he joined the University
of Chicago law school faculty in 1969, Casper has
served as dean of the law school from 1979-87 and
provost from 1989 to the present.
His Jan. 17 announcement that he would resign
as provost in June took many by surprise, because
he was widely expected to succeed Chicago President
Hanna Gray, who has led the university for 12 years.
The Chicago Maroon reported some faculty mem
bers' speculation that tension between Gray and
Casper over the university's budget uncertainties
led to his resignation — a charge Casper and others
denied.
Casper told the student paper he missed teaching.
His eight-year tenure as dean of Chicago's law
school bears this out.

He won their hearts, minds
Casper said he has rarely had a discussion with
students in which his own opinion of something
hasn't been changed. "Students challenge faculty on
their very own academic ground."
Douglas Baird, who graduated from Stanford
Law School in 1979 and is now a law professor at the
University of Chicago, said Casper's commitment to
teaching was legendary.
When Casper was dean, he would regularly invite
students to his home in Beverley Shores, an hour's
drive from Chicago. "He wasn't the kind of teacher
who would appear in the classroom and disappear,"
Baird said.
Casper deserves credit for a "dramatic improve
ment in the quality of teaching in the law school. . . .
He won the hearts and minds of students," Baird
said. Professors who did not teach well sometimes
did not get tenure, he added. Casper also rearranged
the curriculum so that larger courses would be
taught by better teachers.
He tried to rehabilitate poor teachers, Baird said,
"but some people were beyond saving."
"Casper created an atmosphere in which [teach
ingl mattered. ... It was talked about," Baird said.
When Casper stepped down as dean, his students
bought the school an expensive 18th-century map of
Philadelphia.
"It's rare thtft a dean was so beloved that students
would buy a very nice gift to honor him," Baird said.
In a press conference during his visit to Stanford,
Casper said even an institution with Stanford's rep
utation can be "mediocre in some ways." Mediocre
teaching — if he finds it — is something he said he
intends to ferret out.
He plans to talk at length with deans and students
about teaching, although he said students don't
always recognize good instruction. "The most enter
taining teachers are not necessarily the best," he said.
Casper said he "takes a very dim view" of faculty
recruited from the outside who get lighter teaching
loads.
He didn't abandon his own commitment to teach
ing when he became provost. According to Bill Mur
phy, Chicago's assistant vice president for university
news and publications, Casper initiated a council on
teaching to address common teaching problems. The
council was intended to complement a similar
research-oriented group. Additionally, Casper started
a three-step teacher training program, Murphy said.
Stanford freshman Nerissa Wong has already
taken advantage of Casper's reputation by inviting
him to dinner at Stern Hall. She got his home
address from her boss at the Center for Economic
Policy Research, she said, and invited him for food
service dinner.
Casper said he will take her up on the offer when
he visits in mid-April.
Wong plans to make a pitch for the SWOPSI pro
grams, which will be eliminated in budget cuts. She
has her own concerns about teaching quality. "From
looking at my friends' experiences, some of the

undergraduate science teachers, like chemistry and
mathematics, could be improved," she said.
Plans to listen
Casper's management reputation echoes his atti
tude toward teaching: Listen and you will learn.
He said he will talk with students, faculty and
staff before he makes specific plans. "I would be fool
hardy if I now had plans to change Stanford," he
said. "I will just have to do for many months to
come, if not longer, a lot of listening."
He said he has already heard that Stanford's
humanities programs need more support, so he
plans to investigate.
At Chicago's law school, Casper set up town meet-

ings where he met with students.
Baird, who was Casper's associ
ate dean, said discussions ranged
from faculty hiring to the price
of coffee at the school.
Casper, Baird said, didn't get
bogged down in the little details,
but instead had his assistants
investigate. When Baird was
looking into the coffee com
plaints, he found out that the
brew was actually more expen
sive at Stanford. Nonetheless,
when the vendor's contract came
up for renewal, students took
bids and decided to change to
another company.
"He was responsive here
exactly the way you'd want him
to be. He makes sure the prob
lem goes away," Baird said.
On larger issues, like comput
ers for students and library
hours, Baird said, Casper was
equally effective.
Casper has some characteris
tics, Baird said, that take getting
used to. "He does not traffic in
false praise," Baird said — some
thing that might be difficult for
Californians.
When asked how he would
restore sagging morale at Stan
ford, Casper turned the question
around. "What do you suggest I
do? I will get a lot of guidance."
He said he will rely on input
from "physicists and molecular
biologists" to keep Stanford on
the intellectual frontier. "I'm not
an expert on where that frontier
is. I'm a mere lawyer," he said.

G.B. Manriquez—Daily
He called his perspective as an outsider a strength
because it enables him to ask questions that others
may have overlooked for a while. One thing he has
noticed already is "an immensely complex adminis
trative structure" that is compounded by several
committees of faculty, staff and students.
"I almost find it dizzying," he said. If streamlining
the administration is possible, Casper said he will do it.
Some faculty have expressed concern that an
administrator from a reputedly conservative place like
Chicago will undermine progress toward diversity that
Stanford has made under Kennedy. But Casper denies
that Chicago is traditionalist.
"That is one of those stereotypes that is about as
correct as the opposite stereotype that at Stanford,
students play tennis all day,"he said. "[Chicago] has
not been traditional except that it has always put a
lot of emphasis on the quality of scholarship that
takes place at the University."
Casper said his own experience has been multi
cultural. "My [German] background is not of such a
kind that everybody embraces me with open arms,"
he said in a press conference. "I would really resent
it if the views I expressed here 0r... in the future or
.. .in the past were attributed to my ethnic origin."
Facing financial difficulty
Diversity at Stanford may be threatened if need
blind admission is eliminated under Casper's leader
ship, a possibility he hasn't ruled out.
But in the Feb. 7 Chicago Maroon, Casper said
the policy "has characterized the University of
Chicago and its student body perhaps more so than
that of any other university."
There is no conflict between the two positions, he
said. "I am as committed as you can be to need-blind
admission."
He cited uncertainty with the economy, the federal
budget and the indirect cost rate as threats to the pol
icy, which will last "as long as we can afford it, includ
ing making sacrifices in other, unspecified areas."
Casper, who last fall initiated a $500 million fund
raising campaign at Chicago, said he wants to con
centratefund-raising efforts on unrestricted money
that would help Stanford out of its current troubles.
Casper said he hoped that Stanford will be able to
persuade the government to maintain the indirect
cost recovery practice, to implement simplified rules
and to recognize ideologically and financially the
necessity of research.
"If we abandon the approach, then the alternative
is likely to be pork barrel, that is, highly politicized,"
he said.
"Universities cannot absorb all the overhead
costs of the research enterprise," he said. "The gov
ernment has to pay the real costs of the research
effort."
