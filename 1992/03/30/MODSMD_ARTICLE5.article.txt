# Casper may face hurdles as he adjusts to new environment
## 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
Amid all the praise for Gerhard
Casper, the person selected as
Stanford's ninth president two
weeks ago, some faculty members
are wondering privately whether
Casper's outsider status and his
tenure at the more traditional
University of Chicago will prevent
his smooth integration into the
Stanford community.
But presidential search com
mittee members say they dis
cussed several potential hurdles
— among themselves and with

Casper — and con
cluded that the
Chicago provost,
who has a reputa
tion as an articu-

late, consensus-building manag
er, is capable of adjusting to Stan
ford's vastly different atmo
sphere.
Among the questions being
asked:
• Will Casper, as an outsider
with no previous connections to
Stanford, be able to make the
transition from a completely dif
ferent environment and effective
ly lead the University as it strug

gles through some of the most
turbulent years in its history?
• Will he have a strong commit
ment to multiculturalism, consid
ering that he has been dean of
Chicago's conservative law school
and has spent 25 years at the col
lege, which designed the tradi
tional Western culture curricu
lum that has sparked so much
friction at Stanford?
Committee members thor
oughly discussed Casper's status
as an outsider, eventually con
cluding that it would not present
values, and creates a network of
support among staff and faculty
members.
"I think he's going to have to
learn a lot about Stanford before
he begins major changes," Shee
han said. "He's going to have to
find people in the staff and faculty
he can rely on."
Casper's management style is
naturally low key, according to
members of the committee, which
conducted several hours of inter
views with him. Physics Prof.
Steven Chu, one of the members,
said that "in order to get some
thing done," Casper would proba
bly work "in a quiet way with the
line people" — members of the
staff and faculty in the Universi
ty's various departments.
Rather than making "public
statements," Chu said, Casper's
style would be to consider prob
lems and correct them "very qui
etly and not make a big hurrah

major difficulties. The last time
Stanford chose an outsider as
president was in 1968, when it
tabbed Kenneth Pitzer — whose
term was a fiasco, lasting only 18
months.
"The largest question, one that
will always arise when you choose
an outsider, is how well will this
person work in a new environ
ment," said History Prof. James
Sheehan, the search committee's
vice chair. He added that he is
confident Casper can make a suc
cessful transition.
Committee members say
Casper may keep a low profile at
first — a necessary step as he edu
cates himself about a completely
new institution, with its own
characteristics and its own set of

"I think [Casper] is going to have to learn a lot

about it."
Jean Fetter, the committee's
executive vice chair, said the com
mittee received 3,000 letters con
taining nominations or advice
about finding the right candidate,
and the majority of those letters
favored picking an outside candi
date rather than an insider.
But Fetter said the committee
did not specifically focus on choos
ing an outsider, and Casper's
eventual selection was "just a
coincidence."

Not *laying down the law'
Responding to concerns that
Casper would be conservative on
multicultural and academic
issues, many committee members
said he does have a more tradi
tional sense of a university's mis
sion. Regardless, they said,
Casper realizes that Stanford is a
different institution than Chica
go, and he will not force Stanford
to conform to a different model.
Casper, according to Chu, "has
a very good sense of what the dif

ferences might be between Stan
ford and Chicago, and he in no
way intends to mold Stanford in
Chicago's image."
Chu said Casper is "willing to
go deeply into a problem, compre
hend it all" and find a compromise
— a skill that means he will not
simply dictate instructions, but
will listen to all sides of issues
before making decisions.
"Instead of marching off in a
certain direction and 'laying down
the law,' he has a reputation for
building a consensus," Chu said.
Medical School Prof. Saul Rosen
berg said Casper is a person "of
tremendous breadth — he wants to
make changes and to take advan
tage of opportunities" at Stanford.
"On the other hand, he's prin
cipled and he respects traditions
in terms of what the university is
and what the disciplines are,"
Rosenberg said.
Fetter said she will have no

idea what Casper's positions are
until he begins serving as presi
dent. "The test," she said, "will be
in how he handles specific issues."
It is unfair to judge Casper in
"a different context" by using the
Stanford community's idea of
multiculturalism as a compari
son, Fetter said.
She noted that Casper himself,
as a German native, "is from a
very different culture — and
while that's not exactly the same
as multiculturalism at Stanford,
it's certainly a variation of a
theme on that."
Fetter said that at one of the
committee meetings, "somebody
said [Casper] will certainly chal
lenge Stanford's tradition.
"I said it will also be a test for
Stanford in how well it handles a
different person. If Stanford can't
cope with someone very different
coming in, it's not living up to its
own values, either."
