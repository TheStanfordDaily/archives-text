# Silverberg distressed by report
## Neurosurgery Prof. agrees to gender sensitivity training 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Neurosurgery Prof. Gerald Sil
verberg will participate in gender
sensitivity training and submit to
reviews of his behavior as a result
of Prof. Frances Conley's allega
tions of sexism.
In a March 20 statement, Med
ical School Dean David Korn said
an investigation into Conley's
accusations found that some of
Silverberg's behavior reflected "a
troubling insensitivity, especially
toward gender issues."
Prof. Larry Shuer replaced Sil
verberg as acting chair of the
Neurosurgery Department March
20. The search for a permanent

chair has been suspended indefi
nitely, Korn said.
In the statement, Korn also
said Silverberg could be consid
ered for the permanent position
in the future.
"It is my hope that Dr. Silver
berg will be able to modify his
behavior. ... In that event, I see
no reason that he could not quali
fy as an appropriate candidate,"
Korn said.
According to Conley, "The
action taken by the school is a
powerful message" about how
people should treat each other. "I
applaud that," she said.
Conley resigned last May after
Korn named Silverberg, the act
ing chair for two years, to the per

manent position without a
national search. She accused Sil
verberg of demeaning her and
failing to treat her as an equal in
the operating room.
Conley called Shuer "decent
and honest," saying that his
appointment to the position is
"fine."
But the suspension of the
search is not, she said.
"I find that unacceptable. I
read that as saying 'wait another
year to find leadership to see if
Dr. Silverberg can be rehabilitat
ed.'
"It is tragic that the dean has
not seen fit to open the search"
and find new leadership for the
department, she added.
In the statement, Korn said
plans to resume the search are still
unclear because of the school's dif
ficult financial situation. The
school is currently implementing a
plan to cut $77 million from its
budget over the next five years.
Conley said she is "pessimistic"
about whether the sensitivity
training will remedy the problems
she sees with Silverberg's attitude
toward women. No details have
been released about the training,
she said.
The Medical School does not
currently have gender sensitivity
programs, but plans to hire a con
sultant to develop workshops on
gender issues.
Assistants to Korn and Silver
berg said they will not comment
on the decision. Medical School
spokesman Spyros Andreopolous
said the statement, written in the
form of a news release, was draft
ed at a meeting with Silverberg,
Korn and attorneys for Silverberg
and the University.
Conley resigned last June, citing
"pervasive sexism" in the Medical
School. She returned in Septem
ber, saying she could make more of
a difference from the inside.
Silverberg announced last
month that he had been asked to
step down, but University offi

cials refused to confirm that he
had been demoted.
According to the statement,
Korn said he and University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy met with
Silverberg and told him they
found the behavior described by
his co-workers inconsistent with
his role as department chair.
They also told Silverberg that
"it would not be in the interests of
the school for him to continue in
the position of acting chair," the
statement said.
The University has not
released the six-page report on
Silverberg, which describes the
findings of an investigation into
Conley's allegations by four Medi
cal School faculty and staff. Con
ley has said that the report should
be made public.
In the statement, Silverberg said
he had "a very emotional reaction"
to the report. "I was amazed and
distressed by it, particularly since
some of the accounts it contained
were from women whom I consider
to be friends.... I regret that there
were times when I didn't realize
how I was coming across, and hope
they can believe that I didn't intend
to insult or humiliate them."
He said it was never his inten-

tion to "demean or insult" any
women. But "it is now clear to me
that some of the things I said or did
in jest or from affection were taken
as signs of disrespect," he added.
According to the statement,
the Medical School will set up a
procedure to review Silverberg's
behavior and monitor the work
environment in the department.
Korn said that under the mon
itoring procedure he "will be
reviewing events as they unfold in
the department."
Neurosurgery resident Allan
Efron said he was surprised by
the statement. Silverberg has
been "unjustly accused," Efron
said, and his acquiescence to the
terms of the decision "must mean
he's been directed to do so by a
higher authority."
Efron also expressed concern
about the suspension of the
search for a permanent chair.
"We all hoped for a speedy resolu
tion, but there is no end in sight,"
he said. "We are just wondering
who our new boss will be and if we
are going to have one."
One of the department's six
residents, Steve Brown, said he
intends to leave the Medical
School. He refused to say whether

he is leaving because of the recent
controversy, but said things are
"rough" in the department.
Shuer, who has been on the
faculty since 1984, called the con
troversy "very unfortunate," but
said he plans to try to lead the
department "much as Dr. Silver
berg did."
"I wish my ascension to the
chair came under different cir
cumstances," he said, adding that
he has sent out a memo on his goal
of having the department contin
ue to "function and grow."
When Silverberg announced in
February that Korn and Kennedy
had asked him to step down as
chair, Shuer was one of Silver
berg's most outspoken defenders.
"I'm outraged," he said last
month. "I think it's a terrible
injustice, and I think the Univer
sity is doing incredible damage to
the reputation of one person."
At the time, Shuer also agreed
with Silverberg that administra
tors demoted him to prevent more
negative publicity. "I think
they're trying to limit the damage
and they're willing to sacrifice Dr.
Silverberg," he said in February.
But Shuer said Friday that
although "some people were hurt
in the process" of dealing with
Conley's allegations, he now sees
his role "as trying to bring the
department together."
"I think the school has its own
reasons for doing what it did," he
added. "At this point, we're all
trying to work toward a positive
outcome."

to be friends.... I regret that there
were times when I didn't realize
how I was coming across, and hope
they can believe that I didn't intend
to insult or humiliate them."
He said it was never his inten-

tion to "demean or insult" any
women. But "it is now clear to me
that some of the things I said or did
in jest or from affection were taken
as signs of disrespect," he added.
According to the statement,
the Medical School will set up a
procedure to review Silverberg's
behavior and monitor the work
environment in the department.
Korn said that under the mon
itoring procedure he "will be
reviewing events as they unfold in
the department."
Neurosurgery resident Allan
Efron said he was surprised by
the statement. Silverberg has
been "unjustly accused," Efron
said, and his acquiescence to the
terms of the decision "must mean
he's been directed to do so by a
higher authority."
Efron also expressed concern
about the suspension of the
search for a permanent chair.
"We all hoped for a speedy resolu
tion, but there is no end in sight,"
he said. "We are just wondering
who our new boss will be and if we
are going to have one."
One of the department's six
residents, Steve Brown, said he
intends to leave the Medical
School. He refused to say whether

he is leaving because of the recent
controversy, but said things are
"rough" in the department.
Shuer, who has been on the
faculty since 1984, called the con
troversy "very unfortunate," but
said he plans to try to lead the
department "much as Dr. Silver
berg did."
"I wish my ascension to the
chair came under different cir
cumstances," he said, adding that
he has sent out a memo on his goal
of having the department contin
ue to "function and grow."
When Silverberg announced in
February that Korn and Kennedy
had asked him to step down as
chair, Shuer was one of Silver
berg's most outspoken defenders.
"I'm outraged," he said last
month. "I think it's a terrible
injustice, and I think the Univer
sity is doing incredible damage to
the reputation of one person."
At the time, Shuer also agreed
with Silverberg that administra
tors demoted him to prevent more
negative publicity. "I think
they're trying to limit the damage
and they're willing to sacrifice Dr.
Silverberg," he said in February.
But Shuer said Friday that
although "some people were hurt
in the process" of dealing with
Conley's allegations, he now sees
his role "as trying to bring the
department together."
"I think the school has its own
reasons for doing what it did," he
added. "At this point, we're all
trying to work toward a positive
outcome."
Neurosurgery Prof. Gerald Sil
verberg will participate in gender
sensitivity training and submit to
reviews of his behavior as a result
of Prof. Frances Conley's allega
tions of sexism.
In a March 20 statement, Med
ical School Dean David Korn said
an investigation into Conley's
accusations found that some of
Silverberg's behavior reflected "a
troubling insensitivity, especially
toward gender issues."
Prof. Larry Shuer replaced Sil
verberg as acting chair of the
Neurosurgery Department March
20. The search for a permanent

chair has been suspended indefi
nitely, Korn said.
In the statement, Korn also
said Silverberg could be consid
ered for the permanent position
in the future.
"It is my hope that Dr. Silver
berg will be able to modify his
behavior. ... In that event, I see
no reason that he could not quali
fy as an appropriate candidate,"
Korn said.
According to Conley, "The
action taken by the school is a
powerful message" about how
people should treat each other. "I
applaud that," she said.
Conley resigned last May after
Korn named Silverberg, the act
ing chair for two years, to the per

manent position without a
national search. She accused Sil
verberg of demeaning her and
failing to treat her as an equal in
the operating room.
Conley called Shuer "decent
and honest," saying that his
appointment to the position is
"fine."
But the suspension of the
search is not, she said.
"I find that unacceptable. I
read that as saying 'wait another
year to find leadership to see if
Dr. Silverberg can be rehabilitat
ed.'
"It is tragic that the dean has
not seen fit to open the search"
and find new leadership for the
department, she added.
In the statement, Korn said
plans to resume the search are still
unclear because of the school's dif
ficult financial situation. The
school is currently implementing a
plan to cut $77 million from its
budget over the next five years.
Conley said she is "pessimistic"
about whether the sensitivity
training will remedy the problems
she sees with Silverberg's attitude
toward women. No details have
been released about the training,
she said.
The Medical School does not
currently have gender sensitivity
programs, but plans to hire a con
sultant to develop workshops on
gender issues.
Assistants to Korn and Silver
berg said they will not comment
on the decision. Medical School
spokesman Spyros Andreopolous
said the statement, written in the
form of a news release, was draft
ed at a meeting with Silverberg,
Korn and attorneys for Silverberg
and the University.
Conley resigned last June, citing
"pervasive sexism" in the Medical
School. She returned in Septem
ber, saying she could make more of
a difference from the inside.
Silverberg announced last
month that he had been asked to
step down, but University offi

cials refused to confirm that he
had been demoted.
According to the statement,
Korn said he and University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy met with
Silverberg and told him they
found the behavior described by
his co-workers inconsistent with
his role as department chair.
They also told Silverberg that
"it would not be in the interests of
the school for him to continue in
the position of acting chair," the
statement said.
The University has not
released the six-page report on
Silverberg, which describes the
findings of an investigation into
Conley's allegations by four Medi
cal School faculty and staff. Con
ley has said that the report should
be made public.
In the statement, Silverberg said
he had "a very emotional reaction"
to the report. "I was amazed and
distressed by it, particularly since
some of the accounts it contained
were from women whom I consider
to be friends.... I regret that there
were times when I didn't realize
how I was coming across, and hope
they can believe that I didn't intend
to insult or humiliate them."
