# Silverberg distressed by report
## Neurosurgery Prof. agrees to gender sensitivity training 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Neurosurgery Prof. Gerald Sil
verberg will participate in gender
sensitivity training and submit to
reviews of his behavior as a result
of Prof. Frances Conley's allega
tions of sexism.
In a March 20 statement, Med
ical School Dean David Korn said
an investigation into Conley's
accusations found that some of
Silverberg's behavior reflected "a
troubling insensitivity, especially
toward gender issues."
Prof. Larry Shuer replaced Sil
verberg as acting chair of the
Neurosurgery Department March
20. The search for a permanent

chair has been suspended indefi
nitely, Korn said.
In the statement, Korn also
said Silverberg could be consid
ered for the permanent position
in the future.
"It is my hope that Dr. Silver
berg will be able to modify his
behavior. ... In that event, I see
no reason that he could not quali
fy as an appropriate candidate,"
Korn said.
According to Conley, "The
action taken by the school is a
powerful message" about how
people should treat each other. "I
applaud that," she said.
Conley resigned last May after
Korn named Silverberg, the act
ing chair for two years, to the per

manent position without a
national search. She accused Sil
verberg of demeaning her and
failing to treat her as an equal in
the operating room.
Conley called Shuer "decent
and honest," saying that his
appointment to the position is
"fine."
But the suspension of the
search is not, she said.
"I find that unacceptable. I
read that as saying 'wait another
year to find leadership to see if
Dr. Silverberg can be rehabilitat
ed.'
"It is tragic that the dean has
not seen fit to open the search"
