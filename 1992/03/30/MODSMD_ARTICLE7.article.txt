# The 						Search is Over
## 'We didn't want any surprises' Wide consultation and calculated risks guided search 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
Midway through the five
month search to find Stanford's
ninth president, Jean Fetter —
the selection committee's execu
tive vice chair — got a call from a
high-ranking administrator who
was concerned about warnings he
had received that the search was
not going well.
"This person told me, 'The
rumor is that the Stanford search
is disorganized and unfocused,' "
Fetter said. "I laughed." Every
one on the committee, she said,
"had a laugh about how we looked
to the outside when we knew
exactly where we were going."
In examining candidates, com
mittee members made thousands of
phone calls, interviewed hundreds
cf people and sent 162,000 letters
asking for advice about a wide
range of topics, according to Fetter.
It was a process that may have
seemed slapdash to many of those

who came into contact with it.
But committee members say
the process worked extremely
well, continuing methodically
through hundreds of hours of
meetings that first defined what
members wanted in a president,
and eventually assessed the
strengths and weaknesses of spe
cific candidates.
The person the committee
finally selected, Gerhard Casper,
was widely praised by academics,
administrators and the local news
media. Fetter said Casper fit the
stringent criteria the committee
had outlined "about as well as any
human being could be expected."
And even though the commit
tee interviewed hundreds of peo
ple to get evaluations of Casper
and other candidates, the mem
bers managed to keep the process
confidential, surprising nearly
everyone with both the new pres
ident's identity and the speed
with which he was appointed.
Making the calls to outside peo

pie was "an essential part of the
process," Fetter said, but the prac
tice was also risky: people contact
ed by the committee could have
leaked the names of candidates.
Fetter said the committee tried
to stem that by asking people to
keep the names of candidates
strictly confidential — and by
conducting a wide-ranging search
that seemed so unfocused.
"We made so many calls that
we confused everybody," Fetter
said, adding that she got at least
three calls from newspapers in
other states that wanted the
names of candidates confirmed,
but were completely off-base.
"I heard some incredible
rumors — such as the job had been
offered to (U.S. Trade Representa
tive) Carla Hills," Fetter said.
During committee members'
thorough reference check of
Casper and other candidates, the
members were amazed to discover

After five months of long hours, long-distance phone calls and extensive interviews, search committee
members seem pleased, if not overjoyed, with their selection of Gerhard Casper as Stanford's ninth
president. Surrounding Casper are search committee members Peter Bing, George Hume, Jim Larimore
and Condoleezza Rice.
that no one seemed to have any
thing negative to say about Casper.
"Every person with a 25-year
history in academics has enemies,"
said Physics Prof. Steven Chu, one
of the committee members. "In a
certain sense, you're bound to
make enemies — that's a part of
doing the right things. But [Casper]
seemed to be doing the right things
without making enemies."
Committee members contacted
mainly faculty and staff at Chica
go, from secretaries in the Office
of Student Affairs to his col
leagues at the law school, to get a
full picture of Casper — and to
find any glaring shortcomings.
"You try to find if there any
skeletons in the closet," Chu said.
"We didn't want any surprises."
Early in the process, the com
mittee solicited advice from a
number of people — including all
of the University's deans and vice

presidents, faculty members,
presidents of other universities,
chairs of other universities' presi
dential searches, major donors
and prominent alumni — who
provided their input on how the
search should be conducted and
what they would like to see in a
president.
Three University administra
tors, for example, nominated for
mer Secretary of State George
Shultz, now a Hoover Institution
distinguished fellow, as Stanford
president.
In a Dec. 20 letter to the search
committee, Budget Director Tim
Warner, Senior University Coun
sel Tom Fenner and Frederick
Biedenweg, assistant vice presi
dent in Libraries and Information
Resources — all Stanford alums
— said Shultz, using his govern
ment experience, could "restore
Stanford's credibility — and with
it Stanford's image."
Other candidates said to have
been nominated include Nan Keo
hane, president of Wellesley Col
lege; Michael Boskin, a Stanford

economics professor who is now
President Bush's top economic
adviser; A. Michael Spence, dean
of Stanford's Graduate School of
Business; Brown University Pres
ident Vartan Gregorian; Rice
President George Rupp; and
James Gibbons, dean of Stan
ford's Engineering School.
"As a search committee, you
listen to people's advice and then
measure how you weigh it," Fet
ter said. The committee will nei
ther confirm nor deny the names
of specific candidates.
Prominent individuals that
committee members contacted to
get advice about the search pro
cess include Yale President Benno
Schmidt; Cecil Green, a major
Stanford donor; Harvard Presi
dent Neil Rudenstine; and May
nard Parker, editor in chief of
Newsweek and a Stanford alum
nus (see graphic).
"We interviewed friends of Stan
ford considered well-informed in
issues of higher education," Fetter
said "We just wanted to make sure
we consulted as widely as possible."
