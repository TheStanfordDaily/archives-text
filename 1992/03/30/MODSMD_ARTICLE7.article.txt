# The
						Search is Over
## 'We didn't want any surprises' Wide consultation and calculated risks guided search 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
Midway through the five
month search to find Stanford's
ninth president, Jean Fetter —
the selection committee's execu
tive vice chair — got a call from a
high-ranking administrator who
was concerned about warnings he
had received that the search was
not going well.
"This person told me, 'The
rumor is that the Stanford search
is disorganized and unfocused,' "
Fetter said. "I laughed." Every
one on the committee, she said,
"had a laugh about how we looked
to the outside when we knew
exactly where we were going."
In examining candidates, com
mittee members made thousands of
phone calls, interviewed hundreds
cf people and sent 162,000 letters
asking for advice about a wide
range of topics, according to Fetter.
It was a process that may have
seemed slapdash to many of those

who came into contact with it.
But committee members say
the process worked extremely
well, continuing methodically
through hundreds of hours of
meetings that first defined what
members wanted in a president,
and eventually assessed the
strengths and weaknesses of spe
cific candidates.
The person the committee
finally selected, Gerhard Casper,
was widely praised by academics,
administrators and the local news
media. Fetter said Casper fit the
stringent criteria the committee
had outlined "about as well as any
human being could be expected."
And even though the commit
tee interviewed hundreds of peo
ple to get evaluations of Casper
and other candidates, the mem
bers managed to keep the process
confidential, surprising nearly
everyone with both the new pres
ident's identity and the speed
with which he was appointed.
Making the calls to outside peo

pie was "an essential part of the
process," Fetter said, but the prac
tice was also risky: people contact
ed by the committee could have
leaked the names of candidates.
Fetter said the committee tried
to stem that by asking people to
keep the names of candidates
strictly confidential — and by
conducting a wide-ranging search
that seemed so unfocused.
"We made so many calls that
we confused everybody," Fetter
said, adding that she got at least
three calls from newspapers in
other states that wanted the
names of candidates confirmed,
but were completely off-base.
"I heard some incredible
rumors — such as the job had been
offered to (U.S. Trade Representa
tive) Carla Hills," Fetter said.
During committee members'
thorough reference check of
Casper and other candidates, the
members were amazed to discover

After five months of long hours, long-distance phone calls and extensive interviews, search committee
members seem pleased, if not overjoyed, with their selection of Gerhard Casper as Stanford's ninth
president. Surrounding Casper are search committee members Peter Bing, George Hume, Jim Larimore
and Condoleezza Rice.
