Ninth president has the
potential to boldly steer
Stanford into the future

Gerhard casper must
be more than the damage
control president.
Most of the news coverage of
Stanford's ninth president has
focused on Casper's potential to
clean up the image of a university
plagued by scandals. But his abili
ty to move the University forward
is just as important.
And when he does bring his
experience in dealing with Wash
ington to bear over indirect costs,
he should be both bold and
unapologetic. As part of a new
administration, Casper won't bear
the burden of being seen as "part
of the problem," like University
President Donald Kennedy.
The indirect-cost rate needs to
be much higher than the current
55.5 percent. Casper can afford to
demand fairness; yachts and
flowers aren't inextricably tied to
his name. This is one of the dis
tinct advantages of his "outsider"
status.
Unfortunately, there are also
disadvantages. It is vital that
Casper move immediately to learn
about the particular concerns and
priorities of Stanford's students,
staff and faculty. He will need to
understand everything that
makes this University unique.
Open forums, meetings and an
effort to be accessible must be an
important part of his schedule. If
Casper is available to listen and
respond to the concerns of the
community, he will do a great deal
to ward off potential resentment.
As part of moving Stanford into
the future, Casper will have to
confront the fact that higher edu
cation is under siege and tackle
the notion that universities like
Stanford cater only to the elite.
Casper's statements two weeks
ago regarding need-blind admis
sion are troubling. The new presi

dent said he would not rule out
the possibility of reconsidering
Stanford's position on this topic
due to the budgetary problems the
University is going through.
Maintaining need-blind admis
sions is an essential part of pro
moting diversity and convincing
the country that universities are
not elitist havens for the rich.
Sacrificing the opportunity for
an important segment of the stu
dent body to receive a college edu
cation would be a tragic step back
ward. The need-blind policy con
tributes to the Stanford's reputa
tion as one of the better universi
ties in the country.
Another very important part of
Stanford's reputation, and one
one of its greatest strengths, is the
focus on undergraduate educa
tion. Casper should not only con
tinue with what has been done,
but should introduce innovative
ideas that rejuvenate this area of
the University.
Multiculturalism and ethnic
diversity are two other issues to
which Stanford is deeply commit
ted, and Casper should follow the
lead of his predecessors.
And it looks like the new presi
dent is willing to do just that.
Casper has expressed interest in
this issue and has said the quality
of teaching and curriculum should
receive close attention.
He also has said that the multi
cultural experience is very close to
him and that he is aware of the
existence of differences among the
communities.
As someone coming from out
side Stanford, he should bring a
willingness to listen with his new
outlook and fresh solutions.
In its story about Casper's
selection, The New York Times
said Stanford is considered some
thing of a "rags-to-riches-to-rags
story" within higher education
because of its "dazzling rise and
frightening fall."
The new president has the
chance to help prove not only that
Stanford hasn't fallen, but that it
is still on the way up.
