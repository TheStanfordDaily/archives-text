# Bookstore suffered investment 'tragedy' last year
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Daily has learned, as part of that office's
ongoing investigation into whether the
Bookstore has complied with state laws
governing nonprofit corporations.
During the Bookstore's 1989-90 fiscal
year, Weisberg said, several million dol
lars of the store's reserve funds were
invested in "rather speculative" stocks by
the Bookstore's controller. The con
troller, Patrick McDonald, acted without
the knowledge of the store's general man
ager or board of directors, Weisberg said.
Upon learning of the investment
activity, the store's general manager
told McDonald to correct the situation,
and when McDonald did not, he was
asked to resign, Weisberg said.
Following McDonald's resignation in

The Stanford Bookstore lost close to
$2 million in the stock market last year,
due in large part to what a director of
the nonprofit store said last week were
"horrendous" investment decisions
made by a former employee.
The incident has become another focal
point of an ongoing internal investigation
of the Bookstore's business practices, law
professor and Bookstore board member
Robert Weisberg acknowledged in
response to an inquiry by The Daily last
week.
The incident is also under review by
the California Attorney General, The

The loss amounts to roughly six times the money
the store returned to students and faculty in
rebates on textbook purchases.

September 1990, the store proceeded to
sell off millions of dollars worth of
stocks at substantial losses.
McDonald, reached at home last
week, said the store should have taken a
"longer-term view" and not sold the
stocks as quickly as it did following his
resignation.
"If they lost money, I'm sorry,"

McDonald said. "But the ultimate deci
sions weren't mine. I can't be held respon
sible for what happened after I left."
Weisberg would not specify the exact
amount of the Bookstore's loss, saying it
was "a complicated matter."
A copy of the Bookstore's year-end
financial statement obtained by The
Daily, however, shows a $1.8 million loss

"from the sale of marketable securities"
for the store's fiscal year ending June
30, 1991.
While the statement lacks much
detail, it, combined with interviews with
several people with knowledge of the sit
uation, suggests that the store lost
money on its investment activities dur
ing the previous fiscal year as well.
The Bookstore is a tax-exempt, non
profit corporation run independently of
the University and overseen by a board
of directors composed of seven Stanford
faculty, staff members and students.
Weisberg was designated as the board's
spokesperson several weeks ago.
The internal investigation of the
Bookstore's business practices was
prompted by the disclosure in The Daily
in early February that senior Bookstore
employees receive perquisites unheard
of elsewhere in the industry, including
the free use of a vacation home, motor
home, sailboat and luxury automobiles.
The vacation home and motor home
are owned by the store's general man
ager and assistant manager and are
leased back to the Bookstore through
the managers' privately owned con
sulting firm.
The Bookstore has retained two law
firms and an accounting firm to assist
with its internal review.
The disclosure of the perquisites
also prompted an investigation by the
California Attorney General's office to
determine if the store's business prac
tices violate any state laws. Deputy
Attorney General Jim Schwartz said
yesterday that the Bookstore's invest
ment activities are being scrutinized as
part of his office's investigation.
In particular, the Attorney Gener
al's office will look at whether the
Bookstore's investment practices have
complied with Section 5240 of the Cal
ifornia Corporation Code. The code
permits nonprofit corporations to
invest a portion of their funds in the
stock market, but says they are sup
posed to "avoid speculation."
Report due 'in weeks'
Weisberg said a complete accounting
of the investment loss and what led to
it will be made public upon completion
of the store's internal investigation,
which he expects to be in "a matter of
weeks." Until then, he said, it would
not be "feasible or constructive" to
offer many details about the incident.
The Bookstore's internal investiga
tion "is looking into every legal aspect
of everything the Bookstore does,"
Weisberg said.
The store's general manager, Eldon
Speed, and assistant manager, Philip
Chiaramonte, did not return numer
ous phone calls placed last week and
yesterday.
Speed, in a memo distributed to
Bookstore employees last September,
referred to the investment loss as a
"tragedy." A copy of the memo was
obtained by The Daily.
The money the Bookstore lost on
the stock market last year represents
almost one-tenth of the store's total
assets, according to figures in the
store's financial statement.
The loss also amounts to roughly six
money the store returned to
students and faculty in rebates on text
book purchases last year. Weisberg
would not comment on whether or not
the investment loss had an effect on the
amount of money the board of directors
approved for rebates last year.
About $309,000 was returned to
students and faculty last year, accord
ing to the store's financial statement.
'We parted ways'
According to Weisberg, Speed and
Chiaramonte learned in spring 1990
that McDonald had invested substan
tial sums of the store's money in the
stock market. McDonald was given an
opportunity to correct "a horrendous
error in judgement," but that summer
it was discovered he had not done so,
Weisberg said. McDonald was "official
ly terminated" in September 1990,
according to Weisberg.
Upon McDonald's departure,
Chiaramonte assumed the controller's
duties, Weisberg said, and continues to
serve in both that position and as the
store's assistant manager.
In an interview, McDonald refused
to discuss the events leading to his
departure from the Bookstore in much
detail. Asked if his resignation had been
requested, McDonald said "it depends
on whose eyes you're looking at it with.
They decided we should part ways and
we parted ways. I've tried to put all that
behind me, as hard as it's been."
McDonald confirmed that, as the
store's controller, he was responsible
for managing the Bookstore's invest
ment portfolio. But he declined to com
ment on whether his superiors had
knowledge of the investments he made
on the store's behalf at the time he was
making them. "I won't comment on
that," he said.
Asked if he was ever told by the
store's top managers to retreat from
speculative investments, McDonald
replied: "There were disagreements.
There were discussions and argu
ments. That's all I have to say."
Investment committee formed
Several months after McDonald's
departure, in March 1991, the matter
of the investment loss was discussed at
the annual meeting of the Bookstore's
association. The association is a group
of about 30 Stanford faculty, staff
members and students who are
responsible for electing the Book
store's board of directors.
At the meeting, some members of
the association voiced skepticism when
presented with the managers' con
tention that McDonald had been able
to invest large sums of the store's
money without their knowledge,
according to several people who
attended the meeting.
Following the meeting, the Book
store's board established an ad hoc
committee comprised of two board
members and two association mem
bers to examine the status of the
store's investments.

Weisberg would not comment on
what actions, if any, the board of direc
tors took during the seven months
between McDonald's resignation and the
formation of the investment committee.
The committee was chaired by
Shannon Brown, a member of the
Bookstore association and, at the time,
a member of the University's internal
audit department.
According to Brown, the four-mem
ber investment committee met in late
April or early May and rfcommended
that the store "get the hell out of stocks"
by the end of June. The committee,
Brown said, felt the Bookstore "had no
business investing in volatile stocks."
'Risky business'
Brown said there was "some talk"
about whether or not the store would
be better off holding onto the stocks
with the hope that they would recover
some of their value. "But this was
risky business," Brown said. The com
mittee, he said, thought it would be
best "to take the hit in one year."
The committee also recommended
that the Bookstore "move in the direc
tion of a very conservative portfolio" in
the future, Weisberg said.
Information about the types of
stock the Bookstore had invested in
and how much of the store's money
was involved remains sketchy.
Weisberg said he believes some of
the Bookstore's money was invested in
"margin accounts." This type of
investment allows the investor to bor
row a large part of a stock's purchase

price from a broker, and can therefore
pose additional risks to the investor.
As of June 30, 1990, the Bookstore
held close to $5 million in marketable
securities, according to the store's finan
cial statement. By the end of the year,
the store had sold off all but $537,497 of
its securities, taking a $1.8 million loss
in the process, the statement indicates.
An 'unrealized loss'
The store's investment activity in
the preceding year is more difficult to
disentangle, but it appears to have
yielded a net loss as well.
The financial statement shows an
$835,768 gain from sales of securities
during the 1989-90 fiscal year. But the
Bookstore also reports an $858,554
"unrealized loss" on its investment
portfolio for the same year. Apparent
ly, the market value of the store's
remaining portfolio had declined con
siderably, and there was no hope of it
recovering its value.
Thus, for the 1989-90 year, the
store's gain on security sales is over
shadowed by the write-down on the
value of the securities it still held onto.
Taking these two factors into account,
the financial statement shows a net
loss charged to income of $22,786 on
the portfolio for the 1989-90 year.
The $835,768 gain reported for that
year also shows up in the store's 1989-
90 tax return, a copy of which was
obtained by The Daily. In the tax
return, the Bookstore says it achieved
the gain by selling for $9 million secu
rities it had previously purchased for

roughly $8.2 million. It is not clear if
this was a single transaction or if the
figures represent combined values on a
series of purchases and sales.
Two loans obtained
Weisberg would not discuss what the
Bookstore's policy on investments had
been prior to the formation of the
investment committee or what role the
board had played in setting the invest
ment policy. "I'm not going to comment
on details of board history," he said.
According to an examination of the
Bookstore's last seven federal tax
returns, the store appears to have
invested little, if any, of its money in
marketable securities before the 1989-
90 fiscal year.
Last year, the Bookstore obtained
two loans, the store's financial state
ment indicates, one for $2.5 million,
the other for $600,000. Weisberg would
not comment on whether the loans
would have been necessary if the store
had not suffered the investment loss.
"There can't be any simple answer
to that question," he said. Weisberg
said the loans were secured primarily
to ensure the Bookstore could finish
the multi-million dollar remodeling of
the main campus store.
Prior to his resignation as con
troller, McDonald appears to have
been the third-highest paid employee
of the Bookstore, behind Speed and
Chiaramonte. McDonald's salary for
the Bookstore's 1988-89 fiscal year
was $61,000, according to information
the store provided to the Internal Rev
enue Service. McDonald, who began
working at the store in 1980, was also
permitted to use the vacation home
leased by the Bookstore free of charge.
Financing employee homes
In 1984, the Bookstore also helped
McDonald finance a new home in Fre
mont, contributing $29,308 in Book
store funds to McDonald's down pay
ment in exchange for a percentage of
the profit when the home is sold. In
addition, the Bookstore co-signed a
$100,000 loan McDonald acquired to
finance the home purchase, according
to documents obtained by The Daily.
According to Weisberg, the Book
store has had a long-standing policy of
helping employees finance homes in
exchange for a percentage of the
home's equity. At least four employees
have entered into such equity-sharing
agreements with the Bookstore in
recent years, according to records
obtained by The Daily.
The agreement on McDonald's
home remains in effect. Weisberg
would not say when or if the Bookstore
plans to terminate it.
As of last June, the Bookstore had
$338,706 invested in "single-family"
homes, according to its financial state
ment. The investments were not consid
ered as part of the investment commit
tee's deliberations, according to Brown,
who chaired the committee. Brown said
he only learned of the equity-sharing
agreements in recent months.
The Bookstore's policy on equity
sharing agreements "is pretty much
consistent" with the University's poli
cy of helping professors and senior
administrators to finance homes when
they move into the area, Weisberg said.
Nevertheless, he said, this policy "is
under review" as part of the store's
internal investigation of its business
practices.


Above is part of a page from the Stanford Bookstore's year-end financial statement dated June 30,1991. The
statement shows a net loss charged to income of $22,786 on the Bookstore's investment portfolio for the
store's 1989-90 year, and a $1.8 million net loss for 1990-91. As of June 30,1990, the store held nearly $5 mil
lion in marketable securities; a year later it had sold off all but $537,497 worth of the stocks.

prompted by the disclosure in The Daily
in early February that senior Bookstore
employees receive perquisites unheard
of elsewhere in the industry, including
the free use of a vacation home, motor
home, sailboat and luxury automobiles.
The vacation home and motor home
are owned by the store's general man
ager and assistant manager and are
leased back to the Bookstore through
the managers' privately owned con
sulting firm.
The Bookstore has retained two law
firms and an accounting firm to assist
with its internal review.
The disclosure of the perquisites
also prompted an investigation by the
California Attorney General's office to
determine if the store's business prac
tices violate any state laws. Deputy
Attorney General Jim Schwartz said
yesterday that the Bookstore's invest
ment activities are being scrutinized as
part of his office's investigation.
In particular, the Attorney Gener
al's office will look at whether the
Bookstore's investment practices have
complied with Section 5240 of the Cal
ifornia Corporation Code. The code
permits nonprofit corporations to
invest a portion of their funds in the
stock market, but says they are sup
posed to "avoid speculation."
Report due 'in weeks'
Weisberg said a complete accounting
of the investment loss and what led to
it will be made public upon completion
of the store's internal investigation,
which he expects to be in "a matter of
weeks." Until then, he said, it would
not be "feasible or constructive" to
offer many details about the incident.
The Bookstore's internal investiga
tion "is looking into every legal aspect
of everything the Bookstore does,"
Weisberg said.
The store's general manager, Eldon
Speed, and assistant manager, Philip
Chiaramonte, did not return numer
ous phone calls placed last week and
yesterday.
Speed, in a memo distributed to
Bookstore employees last September,
referred to the investment loss as a
"tragedy." A copy of the memo was
obtained by The Daily.
The money the Bookstore lost on
the stock market last year represents
almost one-tenth of the store's total
assets, according to figures in the
store's financial statement.
The loss also amounts to roughly six
money the store returned to
students and faculty in rebates on text
book purchases last year. Weisberg
would not comment on whether or not
the investment loss had an effect on the
amount of money the board of directors
approved for rebates last year.
About $309,000 was returned to
students and faculty last year, accord
ing to the store's financial statement.
'We parted ways'
According to Weisberg, Speed and
Chiaramonte learned in spring 1990
that McDonald had invested substan
tial sums of the store's money in the
stock market. McDonald was given an
opportunity to correct "a horrendous
error in judgement," but that summer
it was discovered he had not done so,
Weisberg said. McDonald was "official
ly terminated" in September 1990,
according to Weisberg.
Upon McDonald's departure,
Chiaramonte assumed the controller's
duties, Weisberg said, and continues to
serve in both that position and as the
store's assistant manager.
In an interview, McDonald refused
to discuss the events leading to his
departure from the Bookstore in much
detail. Asked if his resignation had been
requested, McDonald said "it depends
on whose eyes you're looking at it with.
They decided we should part ways and
we parted ways. I've tried to put all that
behind me, as hard as it's been."
McDonald confirmed that, as the
store's controller, he was responsible
for managing the Bookstore's invest
ment portfolio. But he declined to com
ment on whether his superiors had
knowledge of the investments he made
on the store's behalf at the time he was
making them. "I won't comment on
that," he said.
Asked if he was ever told by the
store's top managers to retreat from
speculative investments, McDonald
replied: "There were disagreements.
There were discussions and argu
ments. That's all I have to say."
Investment committee formed
Several months after McDonald's
departure, in March 1991, the matter
of the investment loss was discussed at
the annual meeting of the Bookstore's
association. The association is a group
of about 30 Stanford faculty, staff
members and students who are
responsible for electing the Book
store's board of directors.
At the meeting, some members of
the association voiced skepticism when
presented with the managers' con
tention that McDonald had been able
to invest large sums of the store's
money without their knowledge,
according to several people who
attended the meeting.
Following the meeting, the Book
store's board established an ad hoc
committee comprised of two board
members and two association mem
bers to examine the status of the
store's investments.

Weisberg would not comment on
what actions, if any, the board of direc
tors took during the seven months
between McDonald's resignation and the
formation of the investment committee.
The committee was chaired by
Shannon Brown, a member of the
Bookstore association and, at the time,
a member of the University's internal
audit department.
According to Brown, the four-mem
ber investment committee met in late
April or early May and rfcommended
that the store "get the hell out of stocks"
by the end of June. The committee,
Brown said, felt the Bookstore "had no
business investing in volatile stocks."
'Risky business'
Brown said there was "some talk"
about whether or not the store would
be better off holding onto the stocks
with the hope that they would recover
some of their value. "But this was
risky business," Brown said. The com
mittee, he said, thought it would be
best "to take the hit in one year."
The committee also recommended
that the Bookstore "move in the direc
tion of a very conservative portfolio" in
the future, Weisberg said.
Information about the types of
stock the Bookstore had invested in
and how much of the store's money
was involved remains sketchy.
Weisberg said he believes some of
the Bookstore's money was invested in
"margin accounts." This type of
investment allows the investor to bor
row a large part of a stock's purchase

price from a broker, and can therefore
pose additional risks to the investor.
As of June 30, 1990, the Bookstore
held close to $5 million in marketable
securities, according to the store's finan
cial statement. By the end of the year,
the store had sold off all but $537,497 of
its securities, taking a $1.8 million loss
in the process, the statement indicates.
An 'unrealized loss'
The store's investment activity in
the preceding year is more difficult to
disentangle, but it appears to have
yielded a net loss as well.
The financial statement shows an
$835,768 gain from sales of securities
during the 1989-90 fiscal year. But the
Bookstore also reports an $858,554
"unrealized loss" on its investment
portfolio for the same year. Apparent
ly, the market value of the store's
remaining portfolio had declined con
siderably, and there was no hope of it
recovering its value.
Thus, for the 1989-90 year, the
store's gain on security sales is over
shadowed by the write-down on the
value of the securities it still held onto.
Taking these two factors into account,
the financial statement shows a net
loss charged to income of $22,786 on
the portfolio for the 1989-90 year.
The $835,768 gain reported for that
year also shows up in the store's 1989-
90 tax return, a copy of which was
obtained by The Daily. In the tax
return, the Bookstore says it achieved
the gain by selling for $9 million secu
rities it had previously purchased for

roughly $8.2 million. It is not clear if
this was a single transaction or if the
figures represent combined values on a
series of purchases and sales.
Two loans obtained
Weisberg would not discuss what the
Bookstore's policy on investments had
been prior to the formation of the
investment committee or what role the
board had played in setting the invest
ment policy. "I'm not going to comment
on details of board history," he said.
According to an examination of the
Bookstore's last seven federal tax
returns, the store appears to have
invested little, if any, of its money in
marketable securities before the 1989-
90 fiscal year.
Last year, the Bookstore obtained
two loans, the store's financial state
ment indicates, one for $2.5 million,
the other for $600,000. Weisberg would
not comment on whether the loans
would have been necessary if the store
had not suffered the investment loss.
"There can't be any simple answer
to that question," he said. Weisberg
said the loans were secured primarily
to ensure the Bookstore could finish
the multi-million dollar remodeling of
the main campus store.
Prior to his resignation as con
troller, McDonald appears to have
been the third-highest paid employee
of the Bookstore, behind Speed and
Chiaramonte. McDonald's salary for
the Bookstore's 1988-89 fiscal year
was $61,000, according to information
the store provided to the Internal Rev
enue Service. McDonald, who began
working at the store in 1980, was also
permitted to use the vacation home
leased by the Bookstore free of charge.
Financing employee homes
In 1984, the Bookstore also helped
McDonald finance a new home in Fre
mont, contributing $29,308 in Book
store funds to McDonald's down pay
ment in exchange for a percentage of
the profit when the home is sold. In
addition, the Bookstore co-signed a
$100,000 loan McDonald acquired to
finance the home purchase, according
to documents obtained by The Daily.
According to Weisberg, the Book
store has had a long-standing policy of
helping employees finance homes in
exchange for a percentage of the
home's equity. At least four employees
have entered into such equity-sharing
agreements with the Bookstore in
recent years, according to records
obtained by The Daily.
The agreement on McDonald's
home remains in effect. Weisberg
would not say when or if the Bookstore
plans to terminate it.
As of last June, the Bookstore had
$338,706 invested in "single-family"
homes, according to its financial state
ment. The investments were not consid
ered as part of the investment commit
tee's deliberations, according to Brown,
who chaired the committee. Brown said
he only learned of the equity-sharing
agreements in recent months.
The Bookstore's policy on equity
sharing agreements "is pretty much
consistent" with the University's poli
cy of helping professors and senior
administrators to finance homes when
they move into the area, Weisberg said.
Nevertheless, he said, this policy "is
under review" as part of the store's
internal investigation of its business
practices.


Above is part of a page from the Stanford Bookstore's year-end financial statement dated June 30,1991. The
statement shows a net loss charged to income of $22,786 on the Bookstore's investment portfolio for the
store's 1989-90 year, and a $1.8 million net loss for 1990-91. As of June 30,1990, the store held nearly $5 mil
lion in marketable securities; a year later it had sold off all but $537,497 worth of the stocks.


Brian Bedell — Dally
Students perform the quarterly ritual of buying textbooks at the Bookstore
yesterday.
Daily has learned, as part of that office's
ongoing investigation into whether the
Bookstore has complied with state laws
governing nonprofit corporations.
During the Bookstore's 1989-90 fiscal
year, Weisberg said, several million dol
lars of the store's reserve funds were
invested in "rather speculative" stocks by
the Bookstore's controller. The con
troller, Patrick McDonald, acted without
the knowledge of the store's general man
ager or board of directors, Weisberg said.
Upon learning of the investment
activity, the store's general manager
told McDonald to correct the situation,
and when McDonald did not, he was
asked to resign, Weisberg said.
Following McDonald's resignation in

The Stanford Bookstore lost close to
$2 million in the stock market last year,
due in large part to what a director of
the nonprofit store said last week were
"horrendous" investment decisions
made by a former employee.
The incident has become another focal
point of an ongoing internal investigation
of the Bookstore's business practices, law
professor and Bookstore board member
Robert Weisberg acknowledged in
response to an inquiry by The Daily last
week.
The incident is also under review by
the California Attorney General, The

The loss amounts to roughly six times the money
the store returned to students and faculty in
rebates on textbook purchases.

September 1990, the store proceeded to
sell off millions of dollars worth of
stocks at substantial losses.
McDonald, reached at home last
week, said the store should have taken a
"longer-term view" and not sold the
stocks as quickly as it did following his
resignation.
"If they lost money, I'm sorry,"

McDonald said. "But the ultimate deci
sions weren't mine. I can't be held respon
sible for what happened after I left."
Weisberg would not specify the exact
amount of the Bookstore's loss, saying it
was "a complicated matter."
A copy of the Bookstore's year-end
financial statement obtained by The
Daily, however, shows a $1.8 million loss

"from the sale of marketable securities"
for the store's fiscal year ending June
30, 1991.
While the statement lacks much
detail, it, combined with interviews with
several people with knowledge of the sit
uation, suggests that the store lost
money on its investment activities dur
ing the previous fiscal year as well.
The Bookstore is a tax-exempt, non
profit corporation run independently of
the University and overseen by a board
of directors composed of seven Stanford
faculty, staff members and students.
Weisberg was designated as the board's
spokesperson several weeks ago.

stock market. McDonald was given an
opportunity to correct "a horrendous
error in judgement," but that summer
it was discovered he had not done so,
Weisberg said. McDonald was "official
ly terminated" in September 1990,
according to Weisberg.
Upon McDonald's departure,
Chiaramonte assumed the controller's
duties, Weisberg said, and continues to
serve in both that position and as the
store's assistant manager.
In an interview, McDonald refused
to discuss the events leading to his
departure from the Bookstore in much
detail. Asked if his resignation had been
requested, McDonald said "it depends
on whose eyes you're looking at it with.
They decided we should part ways and
we parted ways. I've tried to put all that
behind me, as hard as it's been."
McDonald confirmed that, as the
store's controller, he was responsible
for managing the Bookstore's invest
ment portfolio. But he declined to com
ment on whether his superiors had
knowledge of the investments he made
on the store's behalf at the time he was
making them. "I won't comment on
that," he said.
Asked if he was ever told by the
store's top managers to retreat from
speculative investments, McDonald
replied: "There were disagreements.
There were discussions and argu
ments. That's all I have to say."
Investment committee formed
Several months after McDonald's
departure, in March 1991, the matter
of the investment loss was discussed at
the annual meeting of the Bookstore's
association. The association is a group
of about 30 Stanford faculty, staff
members and students who are
responsible for electing the Book
store's board of directors.
At the meeting, some members of
the association voiced skepticism when
presented with the managers' con
tention that McDonald had been able
to invest large sums of the store's
money without their knowledge,
according to several people who
attended the meeting.
Following the meeting, the Book
store's board established an ad hoc
committee comprised of two board
members and two association mem
bers to examine the status of the
store's investments.

Weisberg would not comment on
what actions, if any, the board of direc
tors took during the seven months
between McDonald's resignation and the
formation of the investment committee.
The committee was chaired by
Shannon Brown, a member of the
Bookstore association and, at the time,
a member of the University's internal
audit department.
According to Brown, the four-mem
ber investment committee met in late
April or early May and rfcommended
that the store "get the hell out of stocks"
by the end of June. The committee,
Brown said, felt the Bookstore "had no
business investing in volatile stocks."
'Risky business'
Brown said there was "some talk"
about whether or not the store would
be better off holding onto the stocks
with the hope that they would recover
some of their value. "But this was
risky business," Brown said. The com
mittee, he said, thought it would be
best "to take the hit in one year."
The committee also recommended
that the Bookstore "move in the direc
tion of a very conservative portfolio" in
the future, Weisberg said.
Information about the types of
stock the Bookstore had invested in
and how much of the store's money
was involved remains sketchy.
Weisberg said he believes some of
the Bookstore's money was invested in
"margin accounts." This type of
investment allows the investor to bor
row a large part of a stock's purchase

price from a broker, and can therefore
pose additional risks to the investor.
As of June 30, 1990, the Bookstore
held close to $5 million in marketable
securities, according to the store's finan
cial statement. By the end of the year,
the store had sold off all but $537,497 of
its securities, taking a $1.8 million loss
in the process, the statement indicates.
An 'unrealized loss'
The store's investment activity in
the preceding year is more difficult to
disentangle, but it appears to have
yielded a net loss as well.
The financial statement shows an
$835,768 gain from sales of securities
during the 1989-90 fiscal year. But the
Bookstore also reports an $858,554
"unrealized loss" on its investment
portfolio for the same year. Apparent
ly, the market value of the store's
remaining portfolio had declined con
siderably, and there was no hope of it
recovering its value.
Thus, for the 1989-90 year, the
store's gain on security sales is over
shadowed by the write-down on the
value of the securities it still held onto.
Taking these two factors into account,
the financial statement shows a net
loss charged to income of $22,786 on
the portfolio for the 1989-90 year.
The $835,768 gain reported for that
year also shows up in the store's 1989-
90 tax return, a copy of which was
obtained by The Daily. In the tax
return, the Bookstore says it achieved
the gain by selling for $9 million secu
rities it had previously purchased for

roughly $8.2 million. It is not clear if
this was a single transaction or if the
figures represent combined values on a
series of purchases and sales.
Two loans obtained
Weisberg would not discuss what the
Bookstore's policy on investments had
been prior to the formation of the
investment committee or what role the
board had played in setting the invest
ment policy. "I'm not going to comment
on details of board history," he said.
According to an examination of the
Bookstore's last seven federal tax
returns, the store appears to have
invested little, if any, of its money in
marketable securities before the 1989-
90 fiscal year.
Last year, the Bookstore obtained
two loans, the store's financial state
ment indicates, one for $2.5 million,
the other for $600,000. Weisberg would
not comment on whether the loans
would have been necessary if the store
had not suffered the investment loss.
"There can't be any simple answer
to that question," he said. Weisberg
said the loans were secured primarily
to ensure the Bookstore could finish
the multi-million dollar remodeling of
the main campus store.
Prior to his resignation as con
troller, McDonald appears to have
been the third-highest paid employee
of the Bookstore, behind Speed and
Chiaramonte. McDonald's salary for
the Bookstore's 1988-89 fiscal year
was $61,000, according to information
the store provided to the Internal Rev
enue Service. McDonald, who began
working at the store in 1980, was also
permitted to use the vacation home
leased by the Bookstore free of charge.
Financing employee homes
In 1984, the Bookstore also helped
McDonald finance a new home in Fre
mont, contributing $29,308 in Book
store funds to McDonald's down pay
ment in exchange for a percentage of
the profit when the home is sold. In
addition, the Bookstore co-signed a
$100,000 loan McDonald acquired to
finance the home purchase, according
to documents obtained by The Daily.
According to Weisberg, the Book
store has had a long-standing policy of
helping employees finance homes in
exchange for a percentage of the
home's equity. At least four employees
have entered into such equity-sharing
agreements with the Bookstore in
recent years, according to records
obtained by The Daily.
The agreement on McDonald's
home remains in effect. Weisberg
would not say when or if the Bookstore
plans to terminate it.
As of last June, the Bookstore had
$338,706 invested in "single-family"
homes, according to its financial state
ment. The investments were not consid
ered as part of the investment commit
tee's deliberations, according to Brown,
who chaired the committee. Brown said
he only learned of the equity-sharing
agreements in recent months.
The Bookstore's policy on equity
sharing agreements "is pretty much
consistent" with the University's poli
cy of helping professors and senior
administrators to finance homes when
they move into the area, Weisberg said.
Nevertheless, he said, this policy "is
under review" as part of the store's
internal investigation of its business
practices.


Above is part of a page from the Stanford Bookstore's year-end financial statement dated June 30,1991. The
statement shows a net loss charged to income of $22,786 on the Bookstore's investment portfolio for the
store's 1989-90 year, and a $1.8 million net loss for 1990-91. As of June 30,1990, the store held nearly $5 mil
lion in marketable securities; a year later it had sold off all but $537,497 worth of the stocks.


Brian Bedell — Dally
Students perform the quarterly ritual of buying textbooks at the Bookstore
yesterday.
Daily has learned, as part of that office's
ongoing investigation into whether the
Bookstore has complied with state laws
governing nonprofit corporations.
During the Bookstore's 1989-90 fiscal
year, Weisberg said, several million dol
lars of the store's reserve funds were
invested in "rather speculative" stocks by
the Bookstore's controller. The con
troller, Patrick McDonald, acted without
the knowledge of the store's general man
ager or board of directors, Weisberg said.
Upon learning of the investment
activity, the store's general manager
told McDonald to correct the situation,
and when McDonald did not, he was
asked to resign, Weisberg said.
Following McDonald's resignation in

The Stanford Bookstore lost close to
$2 million in the stock market last year,
due in large part to what a director of
the nonprofit store said last week were
"horrendous" investment decisions
made by a former employee.
The incident has become another focal
point of an ongoing internal investigation
of the Bookstore's business practices, law
professor and Bookstore board member
Robert Weisberg acknowledged in
response to an inquiry by The Daily last
week.
The incident is also under review by
the California Attorney General, The

The loss amounts to roughly six times the money
the store returned to students and faculty in
rebates on textbook purchases.

September 1990, the store proceeded to
sell off millions of dollars worth of
stocks at substantial losses.
McDonald, reached at home last
week, said the store should have taken a
"longer-term view" and not sold the
stocks as quickly as it did following his
resignation.
"If they lost money, I'm sorry,"

McDonald said. "But the ultimate deci
sions weren't mine. I can't be held respon
sible for what happened after I left."
Weisberg would not specify the exact
amount of the Bookstore's loss, saying it
was "a complicated matter."
A copy of the Bookstore's year-end
financial statement obtained by The
Daily, however, shows a $1.8 million loss

"from the sale of marketable securities"
for the store's fiscal year ending June
30, 1991.
While the statement lacks much
detail, it, combined with interviews with
several people with knowledge of the sit
uation, suggests that the store lost
money on its investment activities dur
ing the previous fiscal year as well.
The Bookstore is a tax-exempt, non
profit corporation run independently of
the University and overseen by a board
of directors composed of seven Stanford
faculty, staff members and students.
Weisberg was designated as the board's
spokesperson several weeks ago.
The internal investigation of the
Bookstore's business practices was
prompted by the disclosure in The Daily
in early February that senior Bookstore
employees receive perquisites unheard
of elsewhere in the industry, including
the free use of a vacation home, motor
home, sailboat and luxury automobiles.
The vacation home and motor home
are owned by the store's general man
ager and assistant manager and are
leased back to the Bookstore through
the managers' privately owned con
sulting firm.
The Bookstore has retained two law
firms and an accounting firm to assist
with its internal review.
The disclosure of the perquisites
also prompted an investigation by the
California Attorney General's office to
determine if the store's business prac
tices violate any state laws. Deputy
Attorney General Jim Schwartz said
yesterday that the Bookstore's invest
ment activities are being scrutinized as
part of his office's investigation.
In particular, the Attorney Gener
al's office will look at whether the
Bookstore's investment practices have
complied with Section 5240 of the Cal
ifornia Corporation Code. The code
permits nonprofit corporations to
invest a portion of their funds in the
stock market, but says they are sup
posed to "avoid speculation."
Report due 'in weeks'
Weisberg said a complete accounting
of the investment loss and what led to
it will be made public upon completion
of the store's internal investigation,
which he expects to be in "a matter of
weeks." Until then, he said, it would
not be "feasible or constructive" to
offer many details about the incident.
The Bookstore's internal investiga
tion "is looking into every legal aspect
of everything the Bookstore does,"
Weisberg said.
The store's general manager, Eldon
Speed, and assistant manager, Philip
Chiaramonte, did not return numer
ous phone calls placed last week and
yesterday.
Speed, in a memo distributed to
Bookstore employees last September,
referred to the investment loss as a
"tragedy." A copy of the memo was
obtained by The Daily.
The money the Bookstore lost on
the stock market last year represents
almost one-tenth of the store's total
assets, according to figures in the
store's financial statement.
The loss also amounts to roughly six
money the store returned to
students and faculty in rebates on text
book purchases last year. Weisberg
would not comment on whether or not
the investment loss had an effect on the
amount of money the board of directors
approved for rebates last year.
About $309,000 was returned to
students and faculty last year, accord
ing to the store's financial statement.
'We parted ways'
According to Weisberg, Speed and
Chiaramonte learned in spring 1990
that McDonald had invested substan
tial sums of the store's money in the
stock market. McDonald was given an
opportunity to correct "a horrendous
error in judgement," but that summer
it was discovered he had not done so,
Weisberg said. McDonald was "official
ly terminated" in September 1990,
according to Weisberg.

Brown said, felt the Bookstore "had no
business investing in volatile stocks."
'Risky business'
Brown said there was "some talk"
about whether or not the store would
be better off holding onto the stocks
with the hope that they would recover
some of their value. "But this was
risky business," Brown said. The com
mittee, he said, thought it would be
best "to take the hit in one year."
The committee also recommended
that the Bookstore "move in the direc
tion of a very conservative portfolio" in
the future, Weisberg said.
Information about the types of
stock the Bookstore had invested in
and how much of the store's money
was involved remains sketchy.
Weisberg said he believes some of
the Bookstore's money was invested in
"margin accounts." This type of
investment allows the investor to bor
row a large part of a stock's purchase

price from a broker, and can therefore
pose additional risks to the investor.
As of June 30, 1990, the Bookstore
held close to $5 million in marketable
securities, according to the store's finan
cial statement. By the end of the year,
the store had sold off all but $537,497 of
its securities, taking a $1.8 million loss
in the process, the statement indicates.
An 'unrealized loss'
The store's investment activity in
the preceding year is more difficult to
disentangle, but it appears to have
yielded a net loss as well.
The financial statement shows an
$835,768 gain from sales of securities
during the 1989-90 fiscal year. But the
Bookstore also reports an $858,554
"unrealized loss" on its investment
portfolio for the same year. Apparent
ly, the market value of the store's
remaining portfolio had declined con
siderably, and there was no hope of it
recovering its value.
Thus, for the 1989-90 year, the
store's gain on security sales is over
shadowed by the write-down on the
value of the securities it still held onto.
Taking these two factors into account,
the financial statement shows a net
loss charged to income of $22,786 on
the portfolio for the 1989-90 year.
The $835,768 gain reported for that
year also shows up in the store's 1989-
90 tax return, a copy of which was
obtained by The Daily. In the tax
return, the Bookstore says it achieved
the gain by selling for $9 million secu
rities it had previously purchased for

roughly $8.2 million. It is not clear if
this was a single transaction or if the
figures represent combined values on a
series of purchases and sales.
Two loans obtained
Weisberg would not discuss what the
Bookstore's policy on investments had
been prior to the formation of the
investment committee or what role the
board had played in setting the invest
ment policy. "I'm not going to comment
on details of board history," he said.
According to an examination of the
Bookstore's last seven federal tax
returns, the store appears to have
invested little, if any, of its money in
marketable securities before the 1989-
90 fiscal year.
Last year, the Bookstore obtained
two loans, the store's financial state
ment indicates, one for $2.5 million,
the other for $600,000. Weisberg would
not comment on whether the loans
would have been necessary if the store
had not suffered the investment loss.
"There can't be any simple answer
to that question," he said. Weisberg
said the loans were secured primarily
to ensure the Bookstore could finish
the multi-million dollar remodeling of
the main campus store.
Prior to his resignation as con
troller, McDonald appears to have
been the third-highest paid employee
of the Bookstore, behind Speed and
Chiaramonte. McDonald's salary for
the Bookstore's 1988-89 fiscal year
was $61,000, according to information
the store provided to the Internal Rev
enue Service. McDonald, who began
working at the store in 1980, was also
permitted to use the vacation home
leased by the Bookstore free of charge.
Financing employee homes
In 1984, the Bookstore also helped
McDonald finance a new home in Fre
mont, contributing $29,308 in Book
store funds to McDonald's down pay
ment in exchange for a percentage of
the profit when the home is sold. In
addition, the Bookstore co-signed a
$100,000 loan McDonald acquired to
finance the home purchase, according
to documents obtained by The Daily.
According to Weisberg, the Book
store has had a long-standing policy of
helping employees finance homes in
exchange for a percentage of the
home's equity. At least four employees
have entered into such equity-sharing
agreements with the Bookstore in
recent years, according to records
obtained by The Daily.
The agreement on McDonald's
home remains in effect. Weisberg
would not say when or if the Bookstore
plans to terminate it.
As of last June, the Bookstore had
$338,706 invested in "single-family"
homes, according to its financial state
ment. The investments were not consid
ered as part of the investment commit
tee's deliberations, according to Brown,
who chaired the committee. Brown said
he only learned of the equity-sharing
agreements in recent months.
The Bookstore's policy on equity
sharing agreements "is pretty much
consistent" with the University's poli
cy of helping professors and senior
administrators to finance homes when
they move into the area, Weisberg said.
Nevertheless, he said, this policy "is
under review" as part of the store's
internal investigation of its business
practices.


Above is part of a page from the Stanford Bookstore's year-end financial statement dated June 30,1991. The
statement shows a net loss charged to income of $22,786 on the Bookstore's investment portfolio for the
store's 1989-90 year, and a $1.8 million net loss for 1990-91. As of June 30,1990, the store held nearly $5 mil
lion in marketable securities; a year later it had sold off all but $537,497 worth of the stocks.


Brian Bedell — Dally
Students perform the quarterly ritual of buying textbooks at the Bookstore
yesterday.
Daily has learned, as part of that office's
ongoing investigation into whether the
Bookstore has complied with state laws
governing nonprofit corporations.
During the Bookstore's 1989-90 fiscal
year, Weisberg said, several million dol
lars of the store's reserve funds were
invested in "rather speculative" stocks by
the Bookstore's controller. The con
troller, Patrick McDonald, acted without
the knowledge of the store's general man
ager or board of directors, Weisberg said.
Upon learning of the investment
activity, the store's general manager
told McDonald to correct the situation,
and when McDonald did not, he was
asked to resign, Weisberg said.
Following McDonald's resignation in

The Stanford Bookstore lost close to
$2 million in the stock market last year,
due in large part to what a director of
the nonprofit store said last week were
"horrendous" investment decisions
made by a former employee.
The incident has become another focal
point of an ongoing internal investigation
of the Bookstore's business practices, law
professor and Bookstore board member
Robert Weisberg acknowledged in
response to an inquiry by The Daily last
week.
The incident is also under review by
the California Attorney General, The

The loss amounts to roughly six times the money
the store returned to students and faculty in
rebates on textbook purchases.

September 1990, the store proceeded to
sell off millions of dollars worth of
stocks at substantial losses.
McDonald, reached at home last
week, said the store should have taken a
"longer-term view" and not sold the
stocks as quickly as it did following his
resignation.
"If they lost money, I'm sorry,"

McDonald said. "But the ultimate deci
sions weren't mine. I can't be held respon
sible for what happened after I left."
Weisberg would not specify the exact
amount of the Bookstore's loss, saying it
was "a complicated matter."
A copy of the Bookstore's year-end
financial statement obtained by The
Daily, however, shows a $1.8 million loss

"from the sale of marketable securities"
for the store's fiscal year ending June
30, 1991.
While the statement lacks much
detail, it, combined with interviews with
several people with knowledge of the sit
uation, suggests that the store lost
money on its investment activities dur
ing the previous fiscal year as well.
The Bookstore is a tax-exempt, non
profit corporation run independently of
the University and overseen by a board
of directors composed of seven Stanford
faculty, staff members and students.
Weisberg was designated as the board's
spokesperson several weeks ago.
The internal investigation of the
Bookstore's business practices was
prompted by the disclosure in The Daily
in early February that senior Bookstore
employees receive perquisites unheard
of elsewhere in the industry, including
the free use of a vacation home, motor
home, sailboat and luxury automobiles.
The vacation home and motor home
are owned by the store's general man
ager and assistant manager and are
leased back to the Bookstore through
the managers' privately owned con
sulting firm.
The Bookstore has retained two law
firms and an accounting firm to assist
with its internal review.
The disclosure of the perquisites
also prompted an investigation by the
California Attorney General's office to
determine if the store's business prac
tices violate any state laws. Deputy
Attorney General Jim Schwartz said
yesterday that the Bookstore's invest
ment activities are being scrutinized as
part of his office's investigation.
In particular, the Attorney Gener
al's office will look at whether the
Bookstore's investment practices have
complied with Section 5240 of the Cal
ifornia Corporation Code. The code
permits nonprofit corporations to
invest a portion of their funds in the
stock market, but says they are sup
posed to "avoid speculation."
Report due 'in weeks'
Weisberg said a complete accounting
of the investment loss and what led to
it will be made public upon completion
of the store's internal investigation,
which he expects to be in "a matter of
weeks." Until then, he said, it would
not be "feasible or constructive" to
offer many details about the incident.
The Bookstore's internal investiga
tion "is looking into every legal aspect
of everything the Bookstore does,"
Weisberg said.
The store's general manager, Eldon
Speed, and assistant manager, Philip
Chiaramonte, did not return numer
ous phone calls placed last week and
yesterday.
Speed, in a memo distributed to
Bookstore employees last September,
referred to the investment loss as a
"tragedy." A copy of the memo was
obtained by The Daily.
The money the Bookstore lost on
the stock market last year represents
almost one-tenth of the store's total
assets, according to figures in the
store's financial statement.
The loss also amounts to roughly six
money the store returned to
students and faculty in rebates on text
book purchases last year. Weisberg
would not comment on whether or not
the investment loss had an effect on the
amount of money the board of directors
approved for rebates last year.
About $309,000 was returned to
students and faculty last year, accord
ing to the store's financial statement.
'We parted ways'
According to Weisberg, Speed and
Chiaramonte learned in spring 1990
that McDonald had invested substan
tial sums of the store's money in the
stock market. McDonald was given an
opportunity to correct "a horrendous
error in judgement," but that summer
it was discovered he had not done so,
Weisberg said. McDonald was "official
ly terminated" in September 1990,
according to Weisberg.
Upon McDonald's departure,
Chiaramonte assumed the controller's
duties, Weisberg said, and continues to
serve in both that position and as the
store's assistant manager.
In an interview, McDonald refused
to discuss the events leading to his
departure from the Bookstore in much
detail. Asked if his resignation had been
requested, McDonald said "it depends
on whose eyes you're looking at it with.
They decided we should part ways and
we parted ways. I've tried to put all that
behind me, as hard as it's been."
McDonald confirmed that, as the
store's controller, he was responsible
for managing the Bookstore's invest
ment portfolio. But he declined to com
ment on whether his superiors had
knowledge of the investments he made
on the store's behalf at the time he was
making them. "I won't comment on
that," he said.
Asked if he was ever told by the
store's top managers to retreat from
speculative investments, McDonald
replied: "There were disagreements.
There were discussions and argu
ments. That's all I have to say."
Investment committee formed
Several months after McDonald's
departure, in March 1991, the matter
of the investment loss was discussed at
the annual meeting of the Bookstore's
association. The association is a group
of about 30 Stanford faculty, staff
members and students who are
responsible for electing the Book
store's board of directors.
At the meeting, some members of
the association voiced skepticism when
presented with the managers' con
tention that McDonald had been able
to invest large sums of the store's
money without their knowledge,
according to several people who
attended the meeting.
Following the meeting, the Book
store's board established an ad hoc
committee comprised of two board
members and two association mem
bers to examine the status of the
store's investments.

Weisberg would not comment on
what actions, if any, the board of direc
tors took during the seven months
between McDonald's resignation and the
formation of the investment committee.
The committee was chaired by
Shannon Brown, a member of the
Bookstore association and, at the time,
a member of the University's internal
audit department.
According to Brown, the four-mem
ber investment committee met in late
April or early May and rfcommended
that the store "get the hell out of stocks"
by the end of June. The committee,
Brown said, felt the Bookstore "had no
business investing in volatile stocks."
'Risky business'
Brown said there was "some talk"
about whether or not the store would
be better off holding onto the stocks
with the hope that they would recover
some of their value. "But this was

mittee, he said, thought it would be

tion of a very conservative portfolio" in
