# Bookstore suffered investment 'tragedy' last year

Daily has learned, as part of that office's
ongoing investigation into whether the
Bookstore has complied with state laws
governing nonprofit corporations.
During the Bookstore's 1989-90 fiscal
year, Weisberg said, several million dol
lars of the store's reserve funds were
invested in "rather speculative" stocks by
the Bookstore's controller. The con
troller, Patrick McDonald, acted without
the knowledge of the store's general man
ager or board of directors, Weisberg said.
Upon learning of the investment
activity, the store's general manager
told McDonald to correct the situation,
and when McDonald did not, he was
asked to resign, Weisberg said.
Following McDonald's resignation in

The Stanford Bookstore lost close to
$2 million in the stock market last year,
due in large part to what a director of
the nonprofit store said last week were
"horrendous" investment decisions
made by a former employee.
The incident has become another focal
point of an ongoing internal investigation
of the Bookstore's business practices, law
professor and Bookstore board member
Robert Weisberg acknowledged in
response to an inquiry by The Daily last
week.
The incident is also under review by
the California Attorney General, The

The loss amounts to roughly six times the money
the store returned to students and faculty in
rebates on textbook purchases.

September 1990, the store proceeded to
sell off millions of dollars worth of
stocks at substantial losses.
McDonald, reached at home last
week, said the store should have taken a
"longer-term view" and not sold the
stocks as quickly as it did following his
resignation.
"If they lost money, I'm sorry,"

McDonald said. "But the ultimate deci
sions weren't mine. I can't be held respon
sible for what happened after I left."
Weisberg would not specify the exact
amount of the Bookstore's loss, saying it
was "a complicated matter."
A copy of the Bookstore's year-end
financial statement obtained by The
Daily, however, shows a $1.8 million loss

"from the sale of marketable securities"
for the store's fiscal year ending June
30, 1991.
While the statement lacks much
detail, it, combined with interviews with
several people with knowledge of the sit
uation, suggests that the store lost
money on its investment activities dur
ing the previous fiscal year as well.
The Bookstore is a tax-exempt, non
profit corporation run independently of
the University and overseen by a board
of directors composed of seven Stanford
faculty, staff members and students.
Weisberg was designated as the board's
spokesperson several weeks ago.
