# Back to basics
## Students help staff members improve English, learn to read 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
Taking a few hours each week, a group of
50 Stanford students are hoping to improve
adult literacy among University employees.
Working in conjunction with a Stanford Hos
pital program, the Stanford Literacy Improve
ment Project's student volunteers offer free
classes and individual tutorials for employees
who would like help in improving their English.
Ambrocio Chavez, a hospital custodian who
has received only a second grade education and
two years of adult school in Redwood City, said
he is "very glad" to be enrolled in the program,
in which he has participated for three years.
"I didn't have a chance to go to school in
Mexico," Chavez said, adding that he now
studies one to two hours every night.
Because workers enroll in the program on a
voluntary basis, they usually come eager to
learn, many of the tutors said.
"Employees love .. . coming to their tutor
ing sessions to practice their English," said
sophomore Atman Shah, one of the project's

coordinators.
But the group presently suffers a tutor
shortage, Shah said. Many prospective tutors
prefer to work with kids "because they're just
cuter," he said. Adults don't have the "same
appeal" that children do, although their desire
to learn often runs much deeper, he said.
Like Chavez, many workers in the program
are learning English as a second language,
working toward their high school General
Equivalency Diploma. Others said they
enrolled because they want to communicate
more effectively.
Students said they enjoy the patience and
self-motivation of their tutees, as well as the
flexibility and two-way process of the pro
gram. "There's no standard way to approach"
tutoring, said sophomore Chris Dahl.
If the employees ever experienced reluc
tance or uneasiness about learning from a
younger generation, they easily conquered
those fears with their boundless enthusiasm
and determination.
"There is nothing wrong with learning
from younger people," said Refugio Flores, a

custodian at Yost House. The tutors "are
younger than ine, but they. . .are very intelli
gent," he said.
Flores, 35, emigrated from Mexico in 1979
with only a fourth grade education. He said he
is grateful to his tutors, the program directors
and the University for his second chance at an
education.
The Stanford Hospital program, the English
Language Improvement Training Effort, has
been forced to make structural adjustments in
the past few years due to a loss of funding.
However, with the help of some private
sponsors, it has remained an integral part of
many employees' lives, said ELITE'S educa
tional administrator, Lauren Kirsch.
The program has "worked out beautifully,"
she said, although she stressed the need for
more tutors. According to Kirsch, the individ
ualized attention of the tutors is directly relat
ed to the employees' rapid progress.
Chavez said he will continue in the pro
gram for as long as he can. He hopes to receive
his GED soon. With steadfast determination,
he declared, "I will keep going until I get it."
