# For your viewing pleasure: videotape vending machine premiers
## 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
Starting tomorrow, students
will no longer have to drive all the
way to Blockbuster to check out
the latest video releases.
A new video rental machine at
Tresidder Union may have stu
dents throwing out their video
membership cards and pulling out
their credit cards instead.
The machine, located in
Tresidder Recreation Center, is a
cross between an automated teller
machine and a vending machine.
Students can insert a credit card,
type in a code, and take home a
video.
To return movies, students
again insert the credit card into
the machine and then slip the
tape into its individual drawer.
The machine will feature new
releases and other popular titles
such as "Do the Right Thing" and
"Total Recall," according to Dan
Stephan, operations manager of
Palo Alto's Holland Video, which
owns this and several similar
machines throughout the state.
Directors at Tresidder Union,
which will share in the machine's
profits, agreed to a "short-term

commitment" of 90 days, depend
ing on the success of the service,
Tresidder Director Roberta
Braden said.
Stephan said the machine, cur
rently only half full, will reach its
136-movie capacity by next week.
"We've had trouble finding the
right tapes," he said, noting that
"this community really likes top
quality films."
Aside from the new releases
and top rental titles, Stephan said
he hopes to stock the machine
with "more intelligent films,"
including "a substantial number
of foreign films, American classics
and maybe a few old Hollywood
movies like 'Citizen Kane* and
'Gone With the Wind.' "
However, Stephan said that
"ultimately, over time, we'll rely
on what [students! tell us" in
order to determine the movie
selection, which will be updated
monthly.
"Everybody who walks by [the
machine] notices and asks about
it," said Robert Gross, equipment
manager at Tresidder Recreation
Center. Installed during spring
break, the machine "has garnered
a lot of interest" from students,
he said.

Gross said the machine will
probably be popular with stu
dents because of its convenient
location and low rental rate of
$2.70 (tax included) per video for
a 24-hour period.
According to Stephan, students
will only be able to use their VISA
or Mastercard to pay for rentals
from the machine, which he called
"sophisticated and reliable."
Off campus, the nearest large
video store is Palo Alto's Block
buster Video, 15 minutes by car
from campus. Blockbuster, with its
selection of more than 5,000
movies, charges $3.25 (tax included)
per video for a three-evening rental.
Although Meyer Library's
Media Center does not rent any of
its 4,600 titles, it does allow in
house viewing for the student
body and loan privileges for facul
ty and staff members from the
Office of Residential Education,
including resident assistants.
Although Stephan admitted
that the machine may not become
popular right away, he remains
optimistic about its eventual suc
cess.
"We're going to make every
effort to see that it works," he
added.

campus.
