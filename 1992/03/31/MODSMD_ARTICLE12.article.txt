'Silence' sweeps 'JFK' in Oscars
LOS ANGELES (AP) — "The Silence of the Lambs," the thriller
about a fledgling FBI agent who needs the help of an evil genius,
swept the five top Oscars last night, including best picture and act
ing awards for Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster.
"Silence" also brought Oscars to director Jonathan Demme and
to Ted Tally for best adapted screenplay.
The film becomes only the third to sweep the five major awards.
"JFK," Oliver Stone's assassination polemic nominated for best
picture, won for film editing and cinematography.
Callie Khouri won the original screenplay award for the female
buddy film, "Thelma & Louise."
Composer Alan Menken won the award for best original score for
his music for "Beauty and the Beast," and he and his late partner, lyri
cist Howard Ashman, won a second Oscar for the movie's title song.
Ashman recently died of complications from AIDS at age 40.

"Howard, I wish you could have seen the finished product. . . you
would have been proud," Menken said.
Pessimistic Clinton targets pesky Brown
NEW YORK (AP) — Bill Clinton yesterday challenged Democrat
ic rival Jerry Brown to as many as a dozen debates before next
week's New York primary, saying he needed head-to-head show
downs to make his case before the "sand runs out of the hourglass."
Clinton's challenge is a reversal of the normal rules of politics.
The clear front-runner for the Democratic nomination, Clinton as
recently as late last week was telling aides to limit the number of
debates with lone challenger Brown.
Clinton sounded decidedly pessimistic about his chances in the
April 7 primaries in New York and Wisconsin and stepped up his
charges that Brown's anti-politics message was an insincere attempt
to tap voter anger.
