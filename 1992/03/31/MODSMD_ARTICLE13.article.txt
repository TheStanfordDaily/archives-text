electing the store's board of direc
tors. The letter alerts them to the
"unhappy news" that the Book
store is having problems with
investment portfolio.

March 12,1991
The issue of the store's investment
situation is raised at a meeting of
the Bookstore association. A deci
sion is made to form a four-member
ad hoc committee to examine the
status of the Bookstore's invest
ments. Bookstore association

ber of the University's internal audit
department, is appointed chair.

Late April or early May, 1991
