## It's Spring and All 
### 
A small rebellion raged
at our feet and now the
campus is green again

T) Y THE ROAD TO THE con
tagious hospital under the
M J surge of blue mottled clouds
. . . the poppies are in bloom.
The Annual Spectacular is on.
It's free and quiet, and very well
attended. Everyone traveling along
Campus Drive near the Medical
School can expect to be entertained
— not by celebrities and speeches,
but by flowers.
And if this welcome to people
returning from break is not partic
ularly loud, it is certainly bright —
brighter and more colorful than
fireworks.
In fact, the most wonderful
thing about these spring flowers is
that they aren't representing any
thing. For us they mean absolutely
nothing. They are not even in Stan
ford colors. They are beautiful in
their very uselessness.
They do show an abundance of
diversity, but they offer absolutely
no sage advice about multicultural
ism or community-building. They
stand idly by as tuition goes up and
summer storage disappears. They
have done nothing to get more can
didates to run for the ASSU Coun
cil of Presidents, save the arts, find
jobs for graduating seniors or recy
cle plastics.
Elsewhere on campus —
between the tiles in the quad and
cracks in the pavement — there is a
similar insidious, groping weedy
voice of exuberant defiance. Green
shoots are taking on both the grim
concrete that ordered the winter
landscape and a whole battalion of
gardeners armed with weedkillers.
For the moment, the weeds are
winning beautifully.
And when the wildflowers on
Campus Drive wilt, no gardener
will replace the clashing mix of yel
lows, oranges, purples and reds
with a tidy arrangement in Stan

ford cardinal and white. The con
crete street dividers will return to
unremarkable drab utility, and we
will have to rely on our short mem
ories to ensure another vibrant
surprise next March.
Meanwhile, the poppies remind
us of the immediacy of spring.
Their entire lives are packed into
two grading periods.
While we weathered our winter
deadlines with all-nighters and
late night runs to Tresidder
Express for chocolate, a small
scale rebellion happened at our
feet. And now that winter is
behind us, we should throw our
selves behind the cause.
Delightful, unexpected insur
gencies are almost a requirement
of both spring and universities; it is
time to protest indoor discussion
sections and swim in a strictly Off-
Limits lake. It is time to demand
that homework and tanning be
done together — assuming the
rains stop soon.
Zen Buddhism, windsurfing,
William Carlos Williams poems and
Sleep and Dreams are in season.
Late night studying in Meyer, long
sleeves and lines at Old Union for
grades are definitely out.
An idyllic Stanford surrounded
by green hills will welcome back
Mikhail Gorbachev, greet a new
president and give a hard sell to
prospective freshmen.
Maintaining energy for every
thing — classes, jobs and national
and on-campus elections — will not
be easy in a iovetjrplace where the
volleyball courts operate twenty
four hours a day.
Soon the rhythm of papers and
problem sets will once again rule
our lives. But for a few weeks the
world will be changing colors
around us and making this place an
especially beautiful container for
beautiful thoughts. Casting off the
winter greyness, poppies and peo
ple have returned to start the new
season.
. . . the profound change has
come upon them: rooted, they grip
down and begin to awaken.
