Individuals in MEChA do harbor anti-Greek sentiment

AS A MEMBER OF the Chicano/Lati
no community and the Greek sys
tem here at Stanford, I was aston
ished to read the March 2 letter by Inter
fraternity Council Rush Chairman
Matthew Moran charging MEChA, the
Chicano/Latino student group, of "brain
washing" freshmen and stifling the
diversity of the Greek system.
However, while disagreeing that the
group itself promotes anti-Greek senti
ments, I believe Moran had sufficient
basis for making such accusations.
After having met a few MEChistas
and attending various programs, I can
truly state that the group does not par
ticipate in Greek bashing activities. In

fact, the group has had enough trouble
gaining support for its own purpose that
it could not partake in such anti-Greek
events.
The justification for Moran's accusa
tions lies in the fact that various leaders of
the Chicano/Latino community who par
ticipate in MEChA affairs not only influ
ence students to avoid Rush, they ingrain
the idea that to become Greek is to become
"racist, sexist and homophobic."
While the group itself does not
endorse such actions, leaders of the com
munity constantly express comments
that can be taken as racist and exclu
sionary.
Recently, one student leader said jok

ingly, "La raza does not join fraterni
ties," while speaking to an interested
freshman. Excuse me, but this comment
is not only ignorant, it is also unfounded.
Having people in positions of authori
ty expressing such biased, close-minded
views not only reveals the feelings of ani
mosity toward the Greek life, but it also
greatly influences freshman who have
had no previous interactions with the
system.
Having personally experienced such
opinions expressed in the Chicano/Lati
no community by student leaders forces
me to concur with Moran's accusations.
Individual members should always
uphold the ideals of an organization but,

apparently they do not. I encourage peo
ple who think that their organizations
are impeccable to open their eyes and re
evaluate themselves.
I, like Moran, also challenge interest
ed students to investigate the basis of the
Greek system. Ask for opinions; howev
er, do not formulate your decision solely
on what other people tell you.
I am a proud member of the Theta Xi
fraternity. But if the price to become
Greek is relinquishing my membership
in such a warped, closed-minded commu
nity, I will gladly pay it. After all, I know
my culture.
