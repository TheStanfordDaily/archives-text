# Indirect-cost charges ignore Stanford's role
## 
### 
The indirect-cost controversy has con
centrated on finding fault with Stan
ford's use of government research
monies. The media had a field day and
saw no need to put anything in perspec
tive by looking at the government's direct
benefit from Stanford's contribution.
Thus, it is important for us to ask,
"What has Stanford contributed?" and
"How has the government benefited from
its investment of its research dollars at
Stanford?" and get the message across.
Aside from the fact that we probably
would not have a Silicon Valley and
therefore might have had to fight the
Gulf War in the trenches at great losses
to our military forces, the U.S. govern
ment has greatly benefit from a direct,
monetary return on its investment in the
form of taxes resulting from new prod
ucts and companies and employment
generated by Stanford research.
First, let's look at Stanford technology
licensed to industry: our Office of Tech
nology Licensing's annual royalty income
is over $25 million. If the average royalty

rate is assumed to be a mere 1 percent (it
likely is considerably higher), the corre
sponding product sales amount to $2.5
billion per year.
Using a figure of $100,000 of sales per
employee, we have at least 25,000
employees paying taxes on their income.
This would mean that at least $50 million
per year result from business taxes and at
least another $50 million from income
taxes of employees.
Thus, the government recovers in
direct, financial benefits at least one
third of its annual research investment at
Stanford about $300 million on formally
licensed Stanford technology alone.
Add to this taxes by businesses formed
as spinoffs from Stanford. We know of
more than 100 such firms and estimate
they have at least $20 billion annual sales
and 200,000 employees (Hewlett-
Packard, Varian and Sun Microsystems
alone have $16 billion sales and 155,000
employees).
Using the above ratios, one estimates
these businesses' taxes to be at least $500
million per year, and their employees'
taxes adding another $400 million, or
more.
In short, the government recovers sev
eral times its investment in direct tax

income alone, not counting any other
benefits.
If the government wanted to act ratio
nally, it would have to look at Stanford as
a proverbial goose that lays golden eggs.
It is time for Stanford to get that mes
sage across.
