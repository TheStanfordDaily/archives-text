# Spiritual issues need more than lip service
## 
### 
This letter is in response to Cory Book
er's March 4 column, "Bridging the reli
gious gap." I am encouraged that some
one has finally brought up the issue of
spiritual beliefs, since it is one that is not
often dealt with on our campus.
In past decades, the issue of the exis
tence of God was up for debate, but in our
generation, it is no longer a topic for dis
cussion. People simply bypass it as either
being too controversial or too involved.
We consider tolerance and open-mind
edness to be our virtues here at Stanford,
but when it comes to spiritual beliefs,

people barely look at both sides. The truth
is, there is evidence on the other side that
needs to be examined so that one doesn't
have to take a blind "leap of faith" or com
mit intellectual suicide if one chooses to
believe in the existence of God.
I am involved in a panel of students
that goes around to different dorms and
offers to answer any question that resi
dents have about Christianity. Our goal is
to promote discussion and show people
that there are reasons to believe.
It is amazing to see the number of
dorms which has allowed our program.
I sincerely hope that people on this
campus do not simply give lip service to
dealing with the issue of spiritual beliefs
in their lives, but also go and seek it out.
