A pilot program to use gradu
ate students from fields other
than English as Freshman
English instructors has been
postponed for at least one year
because of logistical problems,
officials said yesterday.
The program — proposed by
the School of Humanities of Sci
ences — would have acted as an
experiment to assess how effective
ly non-English graduate students
can teach Freshman English.
Currently, 60 percent of the
teaching in Freshman English is
done by graduate students in
English, Modern Thought and
Literature and Comparative Lit
erature, with the rest done by
non-tenured lecturers.
If the pilot program went well,
the school hoped to increase the
number of outside graduate stu
dents and perhaps reduce the
number of lecturers in Freshman
English, as part of the school's
budget-cutting process.
A number of English profes
sors have opposed the idea of
using non-English graduate stu
dents as Freshman English
instructors, arguing it will dam
age the quality of teaching.
Assoc. Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Susan Stephen, who has
financial oversight of Freshman
English, said the pilot program
was delayed because there was
not enough time to organize it.
She said it was particularly dif
ficult to prepare program descrip
tions and requirements in time
