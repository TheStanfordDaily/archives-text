# Freshman English changes postponed
## 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
A pilot program to use gradu
ate students from fields other
than English as Freshman
English instructors has been
postponed for at least one year
because of logistical problems,
officials said yesterday.
The program — proposed by
the School of Humanities of Sci
ences — would have acted as an
experiment to assess how effective
ly non-English graduate students
can teach Freshman English.
Currently, 60 percent of the
teaching in Freshman English is
done by graduate students in
English, Modern Thought and
Literature and Comparative Lit
erature, with the rest done by
non-tenured lecturers.
If the pilot program went well,
the school hoped to increase the
number of outside graduate stu
dents and perhaps reduce the
number of lecturers in Freshman
English, as part of the school's
budget-cutting process.
A number of English profes
sors have opposed the idea of
using non-English graduate stu
dents as Freshman English
instructors, arguing it will dam
age the quality of teaching.
Assoc. Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Susan Stephen, who has
financial oversight of Freshman
English, said the pilot program
was delayed because there was
not enough time to organize it.
She said it was particularly dif
ficult to prepare program descrip
tions and requirements in time
for publication in next year's
Courses and Degrees and
Approaching Stanford.
Ann Waters, acting director of
Freshman English, added that
quickly organizing the training
process for new instructors would
have been problematic.
"The program will be very dif
ficult to implement anyway, and
the plan to push was foolhardy,"
Watters said. "I think the deans
finally realized that this kind of
change required planning and
training, and that next year was
just too soon."
Rich Holeton, one of the pro

gram's 14 lecturers, said he would
like to use the year's reprieve to
continue the debate over using
more outside graduate students
in Freshman English. "It's still an
issue," he said.
But Stephens said it is difficult
to debate the effectiveness of the
plan without first evaluating the
results of the pilot program,
which she hopes to implement
beginning in the year after next.
"Right now, we're having a
debate in a vacuum," Stephens
said. Those opposed to the change,
she said, "say it won't work, but we
don't know if it will work at all."
Holeton said the proposal
would have "increased the pro
portion of inexperienced teachers
in the program, which serves the
students poorly.

"It's the displacement of expe
rienced teachers by inexperienced
teachers. . . .1 don't think even
the deans would say that [the
plan] serves undergraduates,"
Holeton said.
But Stephen said the debate
over the program is being obscured
by Freshman English lecturers'
concerns about losing their jobs.
She noted that the pilot program
"would have cut at the most one
Freshman English lecturer." ,
"People are very protective of
their jobs," Stephen said, "and
that's clouding what ought to be a
more reasoned academic debate."
According to Watters, six faculty
from the English Department will
teach one Freshman English sec
tion each next year, in order to
replace the savings that would have

been achieved by the pilot program.
However, these faculty are not
increasing their teaching loads,
meaning there will be a reduced
number of classes offered in the
English Department because fac
ulty who usually teach regular
English classes will be teaching
Freshman English instead.
"It's equivalent to losing one
full-time lecturer in English,"
Watters said.
Despite the one-year delay,
Holeton expressed frustration
with the budget-cutting process
and the effects of cutting $75,000
from Freshman English.
"As we continue to implement
the $75,000 in cuts, we can't con
tinue to fund programs within
Freshman English for which
we've received national attention.
