## An alternative Spring Break 
### 
SHE WAS LEANING across the
chair, telling me about her two little
boys as I sat eating the dinner we'd
cooked. She'd been hospitalized for hep
atitis and when she came out, she didn't
have a job or any money after the bills
were paid. Her father wouldn't take her
in, her husband was still stationed in Jor
dan after the Gulf War, and until she
could find a home, her sons would have to
remain in Jordan too.
She didn't have a drug problem. She
wasn't an alcoholic. But even with welfare
or any other assistance the government
would give her, housing was still too
expensive.
she knew she was lucky. She was
accepted into a transitional shelter, where
she could stay for up to four months, and
she'd found a job. The next few weeks
would give her the chance to save some
money until she could afford a place.
I think about her and think about my
brother's response when I told him about
the Alternative Spring Break trip I just
went on through the Public Service Cen
ter — Homelessness in the Bay Area.
The lack of affordable housing is prob
ably the greatest factor in causing home
lessness. Many of the jobs that have been
created in the past ten years are service
jobs that pay only minimum wage.
I used to think, "Well, why can't this
guy on the street asking for money go
work at Burger King or something?" I

never realized that he probably couldn't
even get that job without having a home
—a phone number or address to give, a
place to shower, clean clothes. Not that a
job like that could pay for rent and food
anyway, much less support a family.
Even if he could take the time to look
for a job. To get a meal at a soup kitchen
or to enter the lottery for an overnight
space at a shelter, he needs to wait in lines
for several hours at each place.
According to the National Coalition for
the Homeless, 40 percent of the homeless
are families with children. In San Mateo
County, more than a third of the home
less are children.
My brother is 28 years old and a Cor
nell graduate. He believes that people are
homeless because they've made some mis
take sometime in their lives. He also
thinks the government should not "take
care" of people.
We usually think of the homeless as
dangerous people, alcoholics and drug
addicts, and we look away when we pass
them on the street. We think they're lazy
and trying to live off of others. We don't
see the women and children. We don't see
the elderly who worked all their lives but
now have health problems, medical bills
and can't work anymore. We don't see the
adults with jobs. Twenty-five percent of
the homeless are employed but can't
make enough to survive. We don't see the
growing members of middle class people

who are laid off and suddenly can't afford
to keep paying the rent.
Are we going to wait until the majority
of the population is homeless to protest,
to take action against those in govern
ment unwilling to acknowledge this grow
ing problem?
My brother tells me that he struggles
to be able to have the things that he does.
I don't know what he would do if my par
ents didn't help support him.
Many homeless people are victims. A
woman who was once homeless tells me
how she was assaulted. Others are
mugged for their General Assistance
checks at the beginning of the month.
A number of homeless do have drug,
alcohol or mental problems. Does this
mean that they should be left to die?
I think of the many children in the
family shelter, craving attention, craving
a home. I think of the battered women in
the transitional homes. I think of people
desperate for life, perhaps unable to kick
an addiction or just save some money.
And I think of the compassion we must
have for one another. For all those who
suffer.
