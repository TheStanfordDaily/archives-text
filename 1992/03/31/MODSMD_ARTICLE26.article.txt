## Pain, weather, opponents no match for mighty netters Injury-riddled women win 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior Staff Writer 
Members of the Stanford women's tennis team
may have winced when they hit spring break. What
the injuiy-riddled squad sorely needed was rest and
time to recover from various aches, pains, and
strains.
What the players got was Harvard, San Diego
State and San Diego in three days. While the Cardi
nal blanked the Crimson and only dropped one match
to each southern California school, the squad didn't
return any healthier than it left.
One of the four injured starters is Kylie Johnson,
who has spent the past month getting treatment for
compressed disks in her spine. Although her back is
sore, no ligament tears showed up on a recent MRI
scan. After sitting out the UCLA match, Johnson
returned to the lineup, but at No. 6 instead of No. 3
which she plays when she's healthy.
The senior lost only five games in her three match
es, ending the trip south with a 6-1, 6-1 thrashing of
the Toreros' Maddy Diekmann at No. 5. While John
son creamed her foes, her back is still aggravating
her.
"Amputate it — just get rid of it. It gets worse for
a few days but it doesn't really get better," said a
frustrated Johnson, who's been wearing a heated pad
on her back during matches to keep it warm and
loose.
Kristine Kurth has also been dealing with a nag
ging back injury. The muscle strain had bothered
Kurth on her serve for a while but last week it also
limited her mobility and agility.
The injury hampered Kurth in her 6-4, 4-6, 6-1
loss to San Diego's Sakolwan Kacharoen. "I couldn't
arch my back (on the serve) so I just pushed it in,"
Kurth said. "I'm surprised she didn't take advantage
of my serve more than she did."
Although Kacharoen didn't attack the serve, she
exploited Kurth's limited reach at net by lobbing and
making the sophomore stretch wide for balls. "It was
frustrating when I would hit a good shot, come to net
and she would lob me. I thought, 'Oh no, a lob — not
again,"' Kurth said.
"If Kristine plays her game, she would win but her
back limited her ability to serve. She couldn't get
points on her serve and it was harder for her to get to
the net," coach Frank Brennan said. "Under the cir
cumstances, I thought she did a great job."
Kurth beat Harvard's Kim Cooper 6-1, 7-5 and
the Aztecs' Eva Olivarez 6-3, 6-0.
Joining Kurth on the injury list was Laxmi Poruri,
who has a groin pull. While the injury has made quick
direction changes more difficult, the Cardinal sopho
more won her three matches in straight sets.
The feature showdown of the week was No. 4
Heather Willens against Harvard's Erika deLone, the
second-ranked collegiate player in the nation. After a
few seesaw games, Willens took control. The Crimson

freshman missed some first
serves, playing into Willens'
strength — the return of serve.
"My serve was off," deLone
said. "I started a lot of points on
the defensive because she was
attacking my second serve."
Depite hitting heavy topspin
off the forehand, deLone blistered
several winners. But they weren't
enough as she lost in only her sec
ond outdoor match this year 6-3,
6-4.
However, deLone will likely be
a strong contender for the NCAA
singles' title in May. She has
already proven herself against top
competition on the pro tour. After
graduating from high school,
deLone played pro tournaments
as an amateur and reached as
high as No. 95 before opting for
Harvard.
"I didn't want to pass up my
education and not see what col
lege is like," said deLone, who is
unsure about when she'll turn
pro.
While Willens battled deLone

in the top singles slot, Amy
Chiminello moved up to No. 4.
She filled in for Emma Wood
house, who was sidelined with a
hamstring pull. Chiminello won
all her matches despite facing a
partisan crowd at San Diego State
and a match point versus the
Toreros' Tracy Ishii.
Moving into the starting lineup
at No. 5 was Mario Carruth. The
junior was crushed by San Diego
State's Tonya Lauer 6-0, 6-3.
"She wasn't there mentally but
she played well the second day,"
said Brennan, referring to Car
ruth's waxing of San Diego's
Paula Hansen 6-2, 6-0.
Card notes
The new ITCA rankings were
released March 24, the day of the
San Diego State match. In sin
gles, Willens dropped from No. 4
to No. 5. Poruri, who was ranked
somewhere in the mid-sixties in
the pre-season poll, has moved
from No. 14 to No. 8. Johnson
jumped up 20 spots to No. 23
while Kurth fell to No. 59. Wood
house and Chiminello entered the
poll in the low 70's. In doubles,
Poruri and Willens fell from No. 5

climbed five spots to No. 12.

high as No. 95 before opting for
Harvard.
"I didn't want to pass up my
education and not see what col
lege is like," said deLone, who is
unsure about when she'll turn
pro.
While Willens battled deLone

in the top singles slot, Amy
Chiminello moved up to No. 4.
She filled in for Emma Wood
house, who was sidelined with a
hamstring pull. Chiminello won
all her matches despite facing a
partisan crowd at San Diego State
and a match point versus the
Toreros' Tracy Ishii.
Moving into the starting lineup
at No. 5 was Mario Carruth. The
junior was crushed by San Diego
State's Tonya Lauer 6-0, 6-3.
"She wasn't there mentally but
she played well the second day,"
said Brennan, referring to Car
ruth's waxing of San Diego's
Paula Hansen 6-2, 6-0.

The new ITCA rankings were
released March 24, the day of the
San Diego State match. In sin
gles, Willens dropped from No. 4
to No. 5. Poruri, who was ranked
somewhere in the mid-sixties in
the pre-season poll, has moved
from No. 14 to No. 8. Johnson
jumped up 20 spots to No. 23
while Kurth fell to No. 59. Wood
house and Chiminello entered the
poll in the low 70's. In doubles,
Poruri and Willens fell from No. 5
to No. 9. Johnson and Woodhouse
climbed five spots to No. 12.
Members of the Stanford women's tennis team
may have winced when they hit spring break. What
the injuiy-riddled squad sorely needed was rest and
time to recover from various aches, pains, and
strains.
What the players got was Harvard, San Diego
State and San Diego in three days. While the Cardi
nal blanked the Crimson and only dropped one match
to each southern California school, the squad didn't
return any healthier than it left.
One of the four injured starters is Kylie Johnson,
who has spent the past month getting treatment for
compressed disks in her spine. Although her back is
sore, no ligament tears showed up on a recent MRI
scan. After sitting out the UCLA match, Johnson
returned to the lineup, but at No. 6 instead of No. 3
which she plays when she's healthy.
The senior lost only five games in her three match
es, ending the trip south with a 6-1, 6-1 thrashing of
the Toreros' Maddy Diekmann at No. 5. While John
son creamed her foes, her back is still aggravating
her.
"Amputate it — just get rid of it. It gets worse for
a few days but it doesn't really get better," said a
frustrated Johnson, who's been wearing a heated pad
on her back during matches to keep it warm and
loose.
Kristine Kurth has also been dealing with a nag
ging back injury. The muscle strain had bothered
Kurth on her serve for a while but last week it also
limited her mobility and agility.
The injury hampered Kurth in her 6-4, 4-6, 6-1
loss to San Diego's Sakolwan Kacharoen. "I couldn't
arch my back (on the serve) so I just pushed it in,"
Kurth said. "I'm surprised she didn't take advantage
of my serve more than she did."
Although Kacharoen didn't attack the serve, she
exploited Kurth's limited reach at net by lobbing and
making the sophomore stretch wide for balls. "It was
frustrating when I would hit a good shot, come to net
and she would lob me. I thought, 'Oh no, a lob — not
again,"' Kurth said.
"If Kristine plays her game, she would win but her
back limited her ability to serve. She couldn't get
points on her serve and it was harder for her to get to
the net," coach Frank Brennan said. "Under the cir
cumstances, I thought she did a great job."
Kurth beat Harvard's Kim Cooper 6-1, 7-5 and
the Aztecs' Eva Olivarez 6-3, 6-0.
Joining Kurth on the injury list was Laxmi Poruri,
who has a groin pull. While the injury has made quick
direction changes more difficult, the Cardinal sopho
more won her three matches in straight sets.
The feature showdown of the week was No. 4
Heather Willens against Harvard's Erika deLone, the
second-ranked collegiate player in the nation. After a
few seesaw games, Willens took control. The Crimson

freshman missed some first
serves, playing into Willens'
strength — the return of serve.
"My serve was off," deLone
said. "I started a lot of points on
the defensive because she was
attacking my second serve."
Depite hitting heavy topspin
off the forehand, deLone blistered
several winners. But they weren't
enough as she lost in only her sec
ond outdoor match this year 6-3,
6-4.
However, deLone will likely be
a strong contender for the NCAA
singles' title in May. She has
already proven herself against top
competition on the pro tour. After
graduating from high school,
deLone played pro tournaments
as an amateur and reached as
high as No. 95 before opting for
Harvard.
"I didn't want to pass up my
education and not see what col
lege is like," said deLone, who is
