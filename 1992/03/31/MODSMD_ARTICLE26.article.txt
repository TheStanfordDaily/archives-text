## Pain, weather, opponents no match for mighty netters Injury-riddled women win 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior Staff Writer 
Members of the Stanford women's tennis team
may have winced when they hit spring break. What
the injuiy-riddled squad sorely needed was rest and
time to recover from various aches, pains, and
strains.
What the players got was Harvard, San Diego
State and San Diego in three days. While the Cardi
nal blanked the Crimson and only dropped one match
to each southern California school, the squad didn't
return any healthier than it left.
One of the four injured starters is Kylie Johnson,
who has spent the past month getting treatment for
compressed disks in her spine. Although her back is
sore, no ligament tears showed up on a recent MRI
scan. After sitting out the UCLA match, Johnson
returned to the lineup, but at No. 6 instead of No. 3
which she plays when she's healthy.
The senior lost only five games in her three match
es, ending the trip south with a 6-1, 6-1 thrashing of
the Toreros' Maddy Diekmann at No. 5. While John
son creamed her foes, her back is still aggravating
her.
"Amputate it — just get rid of it. It gets worse for
a few days but it doesn't really get better," said a
frustrated Johnson, who's been wearing a heated pad
on her back during matches to keep it warm and
loose.
Kristine Kurth has also been dealing with a nag
ging back injury. The muscle strain had bothered
Kurth on her serve for a while but last week it also
limited her mobility and agility.
The injury hampered Kurth in her 6-4, 4-6, 6-1
loss to San Diego's Sakolwan Kacharoen. "I couldn't
arch my back (on the serve) so I just pushed it in,"
Kurth said. "I'm surprised she didn't take advantage
of my serve more than she did."
Although Kacharoen didn't attack the serve, she
exploited Kurth's limited reach at net by lobbing and
making the sophomore stretch wide for balls. "It was
frustrating when I would hit a good shot, come to net
and she would lob me. I thought, 'Oh no, a lob — not
again,"' Kurth said.
"If Kristine plays her game, she would win but her
back limited her ability to serve. She couldn't get
points on her serve and it was harder for her to get to
the net," coach Frank Brennan said. "Under the cir
cumstances, I thought she did a great job."
Kurth beat Harvard's Kim Cooper 6-1, 7-5 and
the Aztecs' Eva Olivarez 6-3, 6-0.
Joining Kurth on the injury list was Laxmi Poruri,
who has a groin pull. While the injury has made quick
direction changes more difficult, the Cardinal sopho
more won her three matches in straight sets.
The feature showdown of the week was No. 4
Heather Willens against Harvard's Erika deLone, the
second-ranked collegiate player in the nation. After a
few seesaw games, Willens took control. The Crimson

Robert Devens smacks a backhand against the University of Hawaii earlier in the season. The sopho
more was the only Cardinal player to win three singles matches over Spring Break.
