The men's tennis machine rumbled over three
more hapless opponents last week, extending their
undefeated record to 13-0. The Cardinal's first vic
tim was Brigham Young at home, followed by Ari
zona State and Arizona in a dessert road trip.
"It was a real productive time for us," head coach
Dick Gould said.
On Wednesday at the Stanford Tennis Stadium,
the Cardinal began their victory march by crushing
the Cougars 7-2. This was especially impressive
since top hitter Alex O'Brien sat out the singles play
and the team had just completed heavy conditioning
earlier in the week. "They were sore and aching but
they still did really well," Gould said.
Robert Devens, Vimal Patel, Jason Yee and Billy
Wright all won in straight sets at the third through
sixth spots while Michael Flanagan, playing in the
first slot, and Chris Cocotos, shooting in the second,
had the match's only losses.
In doubles action, O'Brien and Cocotos teamed
up for a handy straight set victory while at second
doubles Yee and Patel also trounced their opponents
in straight sets. Devens and Roman Sydorak needed
a third set to pull off the Cardinal's final victory of
the day.
Travelling down to the desert, the Cardinal deliv
ered an even more devastating blow to their second
opponent of the week, Arizona State.
The victorious Cardinal packed up their rackets
and headed back to their Tempe hotel only 70 min
utes after the match had begun.
"It was a devastating performance," Gould noted.
Although the Sun Devils had a few injured players,
the top-ranked Cardinal dropped only one set during
Friday's romp.
O'Brien defeated his opponent in straight sets
while Flanagan chalked up a three-set win to even
out his week's record at 1-1.
Cocotos, at third, pounded his opponent merci
lessly at the net. "I played pretty aggressively,"
Cocotos said. "The guy was kind of a baseliner. I just
kept coming to the net and finishing points early."
Due to rain after the singles action, doubles play
was cancelled.
Facing a tougher opponent and the high altitude
of Tucson had little visible effect on the Cardinal
men. "The guys reacted well to the altitude," Gould
said. "The balls were real quick off the court."
The top four singles players and all three doubles
teams gave the Cardinal a 7-2 win. Patel lost his first
dual match of the season in an agonizing three-set
ter at fifth singles. Yee also lost in three long sets.
Although the Cardinal appears unstoppable after
last week'B matches, the real challenge will come
this weekend when Stanford takes on UCLA and
USC at home.
