# A 						tale of two basketball programs: Card lacked Duke magic
## 
### 
A Duke player said it was like watch
ing The Natural, and with 2.1 sec
onds left in the Eastern regional
final against Kentucky, Christian Laot
tner did seem to have some Roy Hobbs in
him. Like the role that Robert Redford
made famous, Laettner did not disap
point in the end. You can string together
all the adjectives you want and spout
hyperbole till you drop, yet unless you
saw the game yourself you wouldn't real
ly understand. It was all there: two great
teams, a trip to the collegiate mecca that
is the Final Four on the line, lead
changes, intense emotion and dramatic
shots that in story book fashion saved the
best for last.
And you knew Duke would do it.
Great teams, championship teams,
always rise to the occasion; and Duke is a
great team. They did it against Connecti
cut two years ago (Laettner again hitting

a buzzer beater to send his team to the
national semis), and you knew they
would do it again this year. Like Hobbs in
the movie, we as an audience were teased
throughout with excellence while given a
hint of failure. But a hint is all we got. We
wondered if Kentucky would pull off the
upset just like we wondered if Hobbs
would strike out, but it wasn't what we
really wanted, and it's not what we knew
would happen. In magic better suited for

Tinsletown than Philadelphia, Laettner
stepped up to the plate and shot the Wild
cats' lights out with a turnaround jumper
no less colossal than Redford's Holly
wood homer.
No doubt the Stanford basketball
team watched the game and likewise
were awed by the spectacle. Probably
they, like many other viewers, secretly
wished it were them hitting the winning
shot and sending their team off the court
in victory instead of just watching it on
TV. Yet the flaw in the Cardinal's season
is that while Duke played out the movie,
Stanford stayed true to its academic
ethos and read the book instead.
Bernard Malamud's 1952 original is a
little different than what made it to the
big screen. The book teases just like the
movie, but the end is more melancholy.
Like the mighty Casey before him, Hobbs
comes up to bat with it all on the line and

strikes out.
This is not to say there is no joy in
Stanfordville—quite the contrary. The
boys from Maples proved just about
everybody wrong by putting together an
18-11, NCAA tourney season that they,
and all of Stanford, should reflect upon
with pride. It was an exciting season, but
like Malamud's literature, you couldn't
help expecting more.
"Just another tease," said a fellow
viewer after the Cardinal lost to Alabama
80-75, and it was hard not to agree. Stan
ford has a right to feel satisfied with its
effort (one of the best games they had
played all year), but for the fan it was yet
another bittersweet taste of what could
have been. All season long the Cardinal
flirted with big-time brilliance, and all
season long the results were the same.
UCLA at home, USC in L.A., Arizona in
Tucson: they all had us on the edge of our

seats only to end up with our head in our
hands.
In the end, Stanford was competitive
in its first round loss. Adam Keefe was
Adam Keefe and Marcus Lollie and Brent
Williams were superb from the three
point line, but the Crimson Tide was just
a little better. Like they had all season,
the Cardinal played well against its high
er ranked foe. Yet like they had all sea
son, the Cardinal could not pull off the
upset. Once again you knew they had the
talent to win, and once again fate man
aged to step in at the end and send Stan
ford packing.
This is not to imply that the Cardinal
are not heros. They deserve that moniker
as much as Natural-esque Duke. Yet
unlike the Blue Devils, the Cardinal's
Hobbsian heroism ran a bit more tragic
They were, however, good reading all
the way through.

Adam Keefe and Marcus Lollie and Brent
Williams were superb from the three
point line, but the Crimson Tide was just
a little better. Like they had all season,
the Cardinal played well against its high
er ranked foe. Yet like they had all sea
son, the Cardinal could not pull off the
upset. Once again you knew they had the
talent to win, and once again fate man
aged to step in at the end and send Stan
ford packing.
This is not to imply that the Cardinal
are not heros. They deserve that moniker
as much as Natural-esque Duke. Yet
unlike the Blue Devils, the Cardinal's
Hobbsian heroism ran a bit more tragic
They were, however, good reading all
the way through.
