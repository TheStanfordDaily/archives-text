# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
It was definitely a Spring Break to
rememeber for Stanford Athletics. The Car
dinal picked up two NCAA swimming titles,
made appearances in both NCAA basketball
tournaments, and ended the week ranked in
the top-10 in nine varsity sports (baseball,
women's basketball, fencing, men's gymnas
tics, men's and women's swimming, men's
and women's tennis, men's volleyball).
Perhaps most impressive about this

week's Athletes of the Week is the list of per
formers who weren't selected. In the
women's department, Summer Sanders set
seven NCAA records at the nationals in
Austin. Freshman Rachel Hemmer scored
36 points and grabbed 17 rebounds as the
women's basketball breezed through the
Western Regionals at the University of
Washington. Jackie Edwards took the triple
jump and long jump titles at the Stanford
Invitational last weekend.
There were several male stars as well.
Nick Bravin took home an NCAA individual
championship in Foil. Mark Graham and
Matt Topham both placed in the top-16 in
their weight classes at the NCAA Wrestling
Championships. Brent Williams tied a
career high with 22 points in Stanford's 80-
75 loss to Alabama in the NCAA Men's Bas
ketball Tournament.

But Molly Goodenbour and Jeff Rouse
clearly shone above even these illustrious
achievements. Goodenbour drained an
unheard-of six three pointers in Stanford's
82-62 regional final win over USC, tying an
NCAA Tournament record in the process.
The NCAA Western Regional MVP also
excelled on defense, limiting 'SC's Tammy
Story to two field goals and forcing three
turnovers.
Rouse's efforts at the Men's Swimming
NCAA Championships in Indianapolis
ranked nothing short of superhuman. The

self-proclaimed "guy who lives next door"
set five American records in the three day
event, as Stanford tallied the highest team
point total in the 69-year history of the
event. Rouse, who earlier in the month qual
ified for the 1992 U.S. Olympic squad, set
new marks in the 100 and 200-yard back
stroke, and was part of a record setting quar
tet in the 200 and 400-yard medley relays as
well as the 400-yard freestyle relay.
