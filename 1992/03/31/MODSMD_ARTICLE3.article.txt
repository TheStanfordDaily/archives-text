Easy Axess?
Students wait in line — in vain — yesterday to use Axess, the new computerized student access
system. Frustrated students were turned away at 4 p.m., when the system was supposed to
become available, because an overload of users on Forsythe caused the system to shut down. The
system was unavailable from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. yesterday.
