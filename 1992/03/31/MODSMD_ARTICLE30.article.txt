# Volleyball dominates Nittany Invitational

### George Malone Editorial staff 
The No. 2 Stanford men's vol
leyball team tuned up for this
weekend's big home conference
matches by traveling across the
country over Spring Break and
stomping some of the best the
east coast had to offer.
Playing four matches in four
days, the Cardinal only dropped
one game during the entire road
trip to its non-conference oppo
nents. Stanford defeated George
Mason last Wedr sday, 15-8, 15-
7, 15-13, and Penn State on
Thursday, 6-15, 15-9, 15-10, 15-
10. Then the Cardinal dominated
the Dutch Country Classic Tour
nament, crushing Rutgers on Fri
day, 15-13, 15-5, 15-12, and Penn
State again, 15-10, 15-9, 15-7.
According to head coach
Ruben Nieves the matches were
successful not just because they
added to Stanford's win-column
total, but also because they gave
several players a chance for
extensive court-time and got
eveprone used to playing matches
again after a two-week break for
Dead Week and final exams.
"You don't want to go into
your last four league matches

rusty," Nieves said.
Nieves used several different
combinations on the court during
the trip, giving him a good look at
the strength of his bench.
"This was reassurance that we
do have a lot of depth," Nieves
said. "We got good performances
out of both our setters [and] all
our middle-blockers."
"Jimmy Blackman came into
the Penn State game and played
really well," middle-blocker John
Bezmalinovic said. "John Rhibar
also played great."
Rhibar had 13 kills and zero
errors in 16 attempts for an out
standing .812 hitting percentage.
After swamping George Mason
easily, Stanford found itself in
trouble early against the Nittany
Lions Thursday. Whereas the
Cardinal seemed sluggish, Penn
State came out fired up and
jumped all over Stanford in the
first game, winning 15-6.
"Penn State came out really
strong," Bezmalinovic said.
"Dave Muir is a great athlete and
they came ready to play. We
weren't as sharp .... Penn State
is a solid team."
"We weren't as sharp as I'd
