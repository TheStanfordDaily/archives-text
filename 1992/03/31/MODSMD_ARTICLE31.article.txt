# Grapplers go to NCAA Tourney
## 
### Larry Liu Staff Writer 
On the weekend of March 19-21, Stanford
wrestlers Lance Johnson, Matt Topham and Mark
Graham faced off against the other top grapplers in
the nation at the NCAA Championships. Though
none of the Cardinal grapplers brought home All-
American honors, the trio wrestled well and won
several hard-fought matches, showing that they
could compete at a national level.
At 142 pounds, junior Lance Johnson faced Cen
tral Connecticut's Mike Kocsis. The bout was close,
but Kocsis prevailed in sudden-death overtime by a
margin of 6-4. Since those who lose to eventual
quarterfinalists are allowed to compete in the con
solation bracket, Johnson had to hope for a strong
showing by Kocsis. But Kocsis fell in the next
round, ending Johnson's bid for national honors.
However, Johnson, who redshirted his freshman
year, figures to be a strong contender at the NCAAs
in his last two years of collegiate eligibility.
At 158 pounds, senior Matt Topham wrestled
four rounds, finishing with a respectable 2-2 record.
After losing his first round bout 9-4 to No. 8 seed
Mike Schyck of Ohio State, Topham rebounded in
the consolation bracket to defeat Lockhaven's Ker
nal Pegram 8-5. Topham then met Oregon's Darrin
Gustafsson, who defeated Topham at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships en route to a second
place finish. This time, however, Topham came out
on top with a 4-2 victory. The win put Topham one
match away from All-American honors. But No. 7
seed Mike Marzetta of Minnesota edged Topham 8-
6by reversing Topham's last minute near-takedown
attempt. Topham thus finished with top-12 honors.
"He was at his absolute best," head coach Chris
Horpel said. "Though it was frustrating to have
come so close [to making All-America], I am excited
that Matt won so many matches at such a competi
tive level."

At 190 pounds, senior Mark Graham also com
piled a 2-2 record. Graham defeated Central Michi
gan's lan Hearn 7-3 in his first round match. The
win advanced Graham to a second round meeting
against No. 1 seed Rex Holman from Ohio State.
Holman lived up to his seeding, pinning Graham
with 2:37 left in the second period; the loss dropped
Graham to the consolation bracket. Graham subse
quently defeated Slippery Rock's Ray Baldwin 5-4 to
make the round of 16. However, Graham lost to No.
8 seed Dave Malecek of Northern lowa in a close 5-
4 match.
Horpel was generally pleased with the strong

Cardinal performance.
"The boys did good. This year's team was consid
ered decent, but most coaches didn't figure us as
possible Ail-Americans. I think we surprised them
at nationals; we outperformed teams that finished
ahead of us at the Pac-lOs."
With the completion of the collegiate season, the
grapplers and assistant coaches will now shift their
focus to the National Freestyle Championships, the
first step in qualifying for the U.S. Olympic team.
The competition will be held in Las Vegas on April
23-25, and the team will continue to train in hopes
of turning out a strong performance.
