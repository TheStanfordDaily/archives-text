The Stanford women's golf team came back from
their trip to Hawaii this Spring Break with more
than just a tan. After competing only once since the
hectic Fall season, the Cardinal performed outstand
ingly in the University of Hawaii Intercollegiate, los
ing by only one point to top-ranked University of Ari
zona.
There were no signs of a quarter-long layoff in sev
enth ranked Stanford's performance, as the Cardinal
caught fire in their best tournament of the year.
Stanford was edged out by Arizona 892 to 893, with
fifth ranked UCLA finishing in the leader's dust with
a total of 914 strokes.
"It wasn't a heartbreaking loss," coach Tim Bald
win said. "It was a tremendous emotional lift for our
team, to be coming down the stretch against the
Number One team, and see it was the Arizona swings
that came apart."
Stanford trailed by eleven strokes going into the
last round, but pulled off one of the Cardinal's first
sub-290 rounds in several years, finishing with 289
strokes. Stanford managed to adjust better than the
Arizona squad to the windy conditions of the Kaneo
he course, which lies on the windward side of the
ocean.
Leading the Cardinal in a surprise finish was
freshman Jamille Jose, who came in fifth overall
among the top-notch competition, shooting a 70 and
71 on the first and last days of the tournament,
respectively. Senior Adele Moore was one stroke
behind in sixth place, with Martha Richards another
stroke bdck in seventh place overall.
Audrey Wooding finished up in thirteenth place to
enable the Cardinal to vault past a difficult field
including third ranked Oklahoma State and ninth
ranked Tulsa.
"This was our best tournament in a long time,"
Baldwin said. "It's amazing.
