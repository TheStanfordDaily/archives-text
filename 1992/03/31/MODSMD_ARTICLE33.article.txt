# Road-weary Cardinal drops slugfest to Wildcats, 11-6
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
With the opening of Spring
Quarter, the Stanford baseball
team arrived at midseason with a
series against the University of
Arizona in Tucson. As far as the
series, well, the Cardinal maybe
left something to be desired.
However, that something can be
found in Stanford's overall per
formance in this half season. The
Card is turning out to be a sur
prise to the college baseball
world.
The series was battle for first
as both Stanford and Arizona
shared the lead in the Six-Pac.
The first game of a Sunday dou
ble-header looked as if it were
going to be a pitching dual, pit
ting Stanford's Rick Helling
against Arizona's Mike Schiefel
bein. However, Helling didn't
have his usual stuff in a 5-2 loss.
Despite 12 hits, leaving the bases
loaded (the tying run on first!) in
the ninth characterized the futili
ty of Stanford hitting for the day,
leaving 12 men on base.
The second game was a com
plete reversal of the prequel.
Willie Adams pitched a master
piece, going the distance with five
K's and no walks in a 15-3 win.
The Cardinal bats were electric,

accumulating 14 hits. Offensive
standouts included David Hol
brook, Steve Solomon, and Chris
Kemper, who went 3-5 with a
homer, a double, and four RBl's.
On Monday, the Card seemed
to slip into their habits of two
games before. Brian Sackinsky
had a tough start, and reliever
Aaron Dorlarque put the game
out of reach by allowing four runs
in an inning and a third. Howev
er, neither was backed up with
very solid defense, as the Card
committed four errors on the day.
Surprisingly enough, the Wild
cats committed five errors, but
had enough firepower from the
plate and mound to make up for
it.
With the loss, Stanford
dropped out of the Six-Pac lead,
with a record of 7-5 to Arizona's
6-3. However, the Card is looking
good with a 20-11 overall record
against arguably the toughest
competition in the nation.
But the biggest surprise has
been the Stanford bats. In the
pre-season, Stanford was thought
to have stellar pitching with little
offense. But the gritty Cardinal is
proving all the critics wrong, pro
viding plenty of punch from the
plate, especially when the pitch
ing has been below standard. The
entire team is hitting above

expectations, highlighted by
exceptional performances from
Dave Cornell and superfrosh
Dusty Allen, not to mention Kem
per's conference heroics. Even in
the Arizona series, the Card out
hit the Wildcats 35-34, with the
latter being a notoriously good
hitting club.

loaded (the tying run on first!) in
the ninth characterized the futili
ty of Stanford hitting for the day,
leaving 12 men on base.
The second game was a com
plete reversal of the prequel.
Willie Adams pitched a master
piece, going the distance with five
K's and no walks in a 15-3 win.
The Cardinal bats were electric,

accumulating 14 hits. Offensive
standouts included David Hol
brook, Steve Solomon, and Chris
Kemper, who went 3-5 with a
homer, a double, and four RBl's.
On Monday, the Card seemed
to slip into their habits of two
games before. Brian Sackinsky
had a tough start, and reliever
Aaron Dorlarque put the game
out of reach by allowing four runs
in an inning and a third. Howev
er, neither was backed up with
very solid defense, as the Card
committed four errors on the day.
Surprisingly enough, the Wild
cats committed five errors, but
had enough firepower from the
plate and mound to make up for
it.
With the loss, Stanford
dropped out of the Six-Pac lead,
with a record of 7-5 to Arizona's
6-3. However, the Card is looking
good with a 20-11 overall record
against arguably the toughest
competition in the nation.
But the biggest surprise has
been the Stanford bats. In the
pre-season, Stanford was thought
to have stellar pitching with little
offense. But the gritty Cardinal is
proving all the critics wrong, pro
viding plenty of punch from the
plate, especially when the pitch
ing has been below standard. The
entire team is hitting above

expectations, highlighted by
exceptional performances from
Dave Cornell and superfrosh
Dusty Allen, not to mention Kem
per's conference heroics. Even in
the Arizona series, the Card out
hit the Wildcats 35-34, with the
latter being a notoriously good
hitting club.

he scored two of Stanford's six runs.
With the opening of Spring
Quarter, the Stanford baseball
team arrived at midseason with a
series against the University of
Arizona in Tucson. As far as the
series, well, the Cardinal maybe
left something to be desired.
However, that something can be
found in Stanford's overall per
formance in this half season. The
Card is turning out to be a sur
prise to the college baseball
world.
The series was battle for first
as both Stanford and Arizona
shared the lead in the Six-Pac.
The first game of a Sunday dou
ble-header looked as if it were
going to be a pitching dual, pit
ting Stanford's Rick Helling
against Arizona's Mike Schiefel
bein. However, Helling didn't
have his usual stuff in a 5-2 loss.
Despite 12 hits, leaving the bases
loaded (the tying run on first!) in
the ninth characterized the futili
ty of Stanford hitting for the day,
leaving 12 men on base.
