# Linkmen survive tough tourney
## Goodwin 'not least bit discouraged' by 13th-place finish 
### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
It was the perfect spring break.
For the Stanford Cardinal men's golf team, the
UCSB Pacific Coast Invitational, held last Thursday
and Friday at Santa Barbara's Sandpiper Golf Club,
had all the makings of an ideal vacation. Sunny
Southern California, a road trip with friends, tee time
bright and early in the morning. ..
Well, the weather was less than ideal, and the road
may not have been too friendly to the Cardinal
linksters, but the squad escaped with a 13th-place fin
ish among 22 of the nation's top schools. Conference
rival UCLA won the event, while local foes Fresno
State and the University of the Pacific placed second
and fourth, respectively.
As has been their pattern so far in 1992, Stanford
started slowly, with their four lowest scores of Thurs
day's morning round totalling 308, or 20 over par.
However, the Cardinal came back and had a team
score of 285, or three under par, that afternoon.
"We hadn't done anything in three weeks, so I was
pleased with how quickly they recovered from that
morning round," said head coach Wally Goodwin,
referring to the Dead Week and finals period that pre
ceded the competition.
Tournament officials then decided to change the 18

pin locations and make several holes longer before the
third round of play on Friday, making for what Good
win said were "impossible" conditions under which
the Stanford team had to attempt to gain in the over
all standings.
Still, Goodwin saw many individual performances
that he could be proud of, especially those of senior
Christian Cevaer and sophomore Notah Begay.
Cevaer finished at 78-69-74 for the three rounds, for a
54-hole sum of 221; Begay, who is neck-and-neck with
Cevaer for the lowest per-round average on the squad,
wound up with a 77-68-77 tally, good for a 222.
Begay's 68, which led the Cardinal's second-round
charge, was the lowest round carded by a Stanford
golfer in the tournament.
Junior Brad Lanning followed the top two with a
225, with sophomore Casey Martin and freshmen
Jerry Chang close behind at 226 and 227, respective
ly. Freshman Steve Burdick, who had come on strong
in the Cardinal's previous match three weeks before
in Arizona, cooled off considerably with the time off
and shot a 236.
While Goodwin expects the Cardinal to finish in the
top two or three places in each tournament, he is not
disappointed with their showing in Santa Barbara.
"I'm not in the least bit discouraged," Goodwin
said. "I know what kind of team we have. We just
need to get out there and play to our capabilities."
