# Credit offered for some off-campus work
## International students to benefit most from change in policy 
### Leta Hong Fincher 
International students concerned about
finding a summer job in light of restrictive
new government regulations may find the
solution on their study lists.
This quarter, two Stanford departments
will begin offering academic credit for summer
work experience, in an effort to circumvent
the 1990 Immigration Act.
The act makes it "practically impossible" for
students on F-l visas to find off-campus sum
mer employment in the United States, accord
ing to Rolando Villalobos, the foreign student
adviser at Bechtel International Center.
The Graduate School of Business and the
Petroleum Engineering Department will offer
courses worth one unit of credit to any stu
dent in the department who pursues off-cam
pus work during spring quarter. Three small
er programs already offer credit for school
related jobs.
The new courses will enable international
students to work off campus, since the
employment will be considered by the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service as

"curricular practical training" — ofT-campus
work which is an integral part of a student's
education, Villalobos said.
John Pearson, director of the I-Center,
called the new government regulations "a
nightmare," saying that for most internation
al students at Stanford, off-campus employ
ment this summer is "no longer an option."
Under the new INS regulations, off-campus
employers can hire foreign students before
completion of their degrees only if the employ
er has actively recruited U.S. workers for 60
days. The new rules went into effect five
months ago, making this summer the first in
which international students face this obstacle.
Because many employers are unwilling to
satisfy the new regulation, curricular practical
training is the only way to "get around the
Immigration Act problem," Villalobos said.
In order to meet the INS's definition of cur
ricular practical training, the departmental
course must be listed in the catalog and spon
sored by a faculty member, Villalobos said.
In addition, a student can only qualify for
curricular practical training offered in his or
her field of study.

Engineering Prof. Lynn Orr, who chairs the
Petroleum Engineering Department, said the
decision to establish a new course for interna
tional graduate students was "not a tough call,
because the benefits to students are clear."
To help international students with the
"sometimes rocky process with the INS, we
needed the appropriate verbiage in the cata
log, saying that we consider the work experi
ence to be of educational value," Orr said.
The Stanford Teacher Education Program,
the doctoral program in engineering-economic
systems and the Geophysics Department's
master's program in exploration and develop
ment are the only programs that currently
provide opportunities for curricular practical
training, Villalobos said.
Villalobos said several departments are con
sidering making the change but face institu
tional barriers. "It's not easy to change the cur
riculum just because students want it,"he said.
However, Villalobos said that "more and
more international students will demand from
their departments" that they offer curricular
practical training. The courses "make life eas
ier for everybody," he said.
