Six students have been awarded the
1992 Deans' Award for Academic
Achievement. The award, now in its
fifth year, is given annually to excep
tional undergraduates nominated by
faculty members and selected by a com
mittee established by the deans of the
three Stanford schools that offer under
graduate degrees.
Sophomore Stark Draper, a history
major, was cited for excellence in both a
fast-track electrical engineering course
and an advanced history colloquium.
He was praised for his impressive
breadth of knowledge, with academic
interests from engineering to the
humanities.
Senior Marshell Jones was honored
for blending theater, writing and
African-derived dance with anthropolo
gy, her major.
She has worked with the KanKouran

West African Dance Company and with
Katherine Dunham, a world-famous
choreographer and former Stanford vis
iting scholar who recently completed a
highly publicized hunger strike to sup
port Haitian refugees.
Balazs Kralik, a co-terminal senior,
was hailed by professors as one of the
most outstanding math and physics
students to attend Stanford in the past
decade. Professors said his academic
record in physics and math coursework
is nearly impeccable.
Senior Daniel Levitin served as
course administrator and head teaching
assistant for Psychology 1, as well as
president of the Stanford Undergradu
ate Psychology Association. He was
commended for his energetic leadership
and interpersonal skill.
Junior Christopher Patil excelled in
Chemistry 32 and made major improve
ments in the course, rewriting the entire
laboratory text and devising new experi
ments. He was cited for his exceptional

academic record, including high marks
in advanced, difficult math courses.
Senior Lea Wolf, a Modern Thought
and Literature major, was honored for
her work in the Dance Program. Her
thesis traces the historical development
of the female dancer, and she was
praised for her work in dance, which
professors said would be outstanding in
any forum.
The award was originally created by
Thomas Wasow, former dean of under
graduate studies, to celebrate under
graduate achievement.
This year, the award was re-named
the Deans' Award, because responsibil
ity for undergraduate education is now
shared among the schools of Humani
ties and Sciences, Earth Sciences and
Engineering.
The 1992 recipients were announced
at a reception held earlier this month
and presided over by Ewart Thomas,
dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences.
