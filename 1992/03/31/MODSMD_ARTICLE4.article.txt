Hoover Institution Senior
Research Fellow James Stockdale
yesterday was named "interim
running mate" in Texas billion
aire H. Ross Perot's independent
bid for the White House.
Late last week, Perot asked
Stockdale, a retired vice admiral
and former Vietnam prisoner of
war, to serve as the vice presiden
tial candidate in his growing peti
tion drive to get his name on the
ballot in all 50 states.
"I'm not here for me. I'm here
for Ross Perot," Stockdale said at a
news conference yesterday. He said
he has no political ambitions and
thinks Perot will replace him with
a "real running mate" if his presi
dential candidacy gets serious.
"Admiral Stockdale is an out
standing American patriot who
has served his country in peace
and in war," Perot said of his run

ning mate, who was shot down in
Vietnam and spent eight years as
a prisoner of war in Hanoi.
Stockdale, 68, is the only
three-star officer in the Navy to
have both aviator wings and the


James Stockdale
Congressional Medal of Honor.
He was tortured several times in
captivity and most of his later
writings relate to his war experi
ence.
"Until mid-summer (he) will
bring great credibility" to the
Perot bid, said Hoover Senior
Research Fellow John Bunzel.
Since March 12, when Perot
established a 1-800 number for
his campaign, more than 1 mil
lion calls have been fielded from
throughout the country by volun
teers who want to put him on the
ballot.
Bunzel, an expert on U.S. poli
tics and elections, said he thinks
that "in a close race, [Stockdale]
can spell the difference."
Although Bunzel said Perot will
not likely become president, his
candidacy could "influence the
outcome of the election" if a size
able number of Republicans or
Democrats desert their party and

vote for an independent candi
date.
In a statement prepared by his
petition committee, Perot said he
had to name a running mate so
his supporters can place his name
on the ballot in all 50 states.
Twenty-eight states require that
independent candidates' running
mates be named.
Bunzel said Perot has not yet
clearly spelled out his programs
and policies. He argued that
Perot, "a brilliant businessman,"
may face tough challenges in the
"messiness" of national politics,
where orders are not followed as
easily as in a business.
Stockdale spent two years as a
Stanford graduate student before
his 37 years in the Navy. Stock
dale also served two years as Pres
ident of the Naval War College in
Newport, Rhode Island.
