p
tanford dorm rooms cause
claustrophobia. Neither
Tresidder Union or Food Ser-
vice serves real pizza. Joggers'
lungs are getting blacker by the minute as
they make the Campus Drive loop. Memo
rial Church, with campus' most inspiring
architecture, has been closed for two
years. And no student can watch a movie
on Memorial Auditorium's big screen
without being bombarded by paper air
planes and rolls of Charmin.
Yes, Stanford has its limitations. But if
you want to fill in the gaps, the Bay Area
has plenty of resources.
There is something for everyone, espe
cially if you're willing to look around a bit.
The variety of diversions in the arts, din
ing, sightseeing and shopping is remark
able. So explore your options.
Let the kid in you play with comics, or
snuggle up with some good poetry. Culti
vate your appreciation for performing arts
with an evening at the symphony, ballet or
theater. Burn off some stress with a bike
ride, hike or jog, or let a day of beach relax
ation clear your mind.
Go on a shopping spree uptown on San
Francisco's classy Union Street, or try
bargain hunting at the San Jose Flea Mar
ket. Satisfy your appetite for quality cui
sine at a local deli, or try a new restaurant.
Take in the Bay Area's most famous sights
on a guided tour, or try out some lesser
known spots. Enjoy some spectacular Cali
fornia architecture, or learn about the art
of ancient Egypt.
The possibilities are limitless. It's all up
to you. So dress up or dress down, spend a
little or spend a lot. Try something new or
stick with your old favorites. Take on a
challenge or opt for a more relaxing alter
native.
Take your pick, and enjoy.
