# Fabulous Fluff
## You're never too old to have comic book heroes

Nowadays, when a con
cerned parent wants to

blame all of society's ills

on something, it's usually
one of the Big Three: sex,
drugs or rock 'n' roll. So,
one might ask, "What
about when I was

younger?" Heck, when I

was in third grade, I had no

idea what sex, drugs or rock

'n' roll were. Why did I get in

so much trouble back then? Well,

the answer is simple. Comic books.

Everyone, at some point or another, has read
at least one comic book, be it "Archie" or "The
Avengers." And if you were reading it when you
shouldn't have been, you probably got yelled at.
Heck, even if you had nothing else to do and you
were reading a comic book, your parent/teacher/
authority figure would probably say something
along the lines of, "Why are you reading that
trash/*& A %s!/fluff? Those funny books are
going to turn your mind into pea soup. Now put
that down and go do your homework/do your
chores/read Moby Dick instead." But you kept
reading them anyway.
