I actually thought I was learning from them. Comics were
a great source of new vocabulary for a young child. Once in
elementary school, I had to write an essay answering the
vital question: "Which animal is superior, a dog or a cat?" (A
testimonial to the value of my primary school education,
yes?) Eager to show off what I had learned in one of my
"Avengers" comics, 1 wrote the line, "When considering the
merits of the dog and the cat, the cat is clearly the supre
mor."
I was pretty proud of that new word I had read. It was

originally used in the context
of one Skrull (random alien
race for those of you who are
not familiar with the millenia
spanning Kree-Skrull war)
referring to his leader as
supremor.
However, much to my cha
grin, when I got the paper
back, that word was circled
in red and accompanied by
the comment, "What in the
world does this mean?" I
should have realized there
might be something lost in
the translation from Skrull
ese to English.
But that didn't stop me. I
kept reading my comics and
kept getting yelled at, and I
still read them now. Since
I'm over 2,000 miles away
from my parents, they can't
yell at me.
The comics industry has

grown and changed considerably in the last 15 years. It,
along with Frosted Flakes, has gained an element of legiti
macy in the adult world. Specialty stores like Comics and
Comix on California Avenue and Lee's Comics on El Camino
Real, both in Palo Alto, have started popping up to support
the comics habits of individuals like myself.
Comics and Comix is a short drive from campus — it prob
ably takes me less time to get to Comics and Comix than it
does for me to get to Forsythe or Pine Hall, those Stanford
buildings that time forgot. The store is a fairly large and
prominent feature of Palo Alto society — it was even includ-

I leek, even if you had nothing
else to do and you were read
ing a comic book, your par
ent/teacher/authority figure
would probably say some
thing along the lines of, "Why
are you reading that
trash/*& A %s! /fluff?"

Ed in the "Storefronts of Palo Alto" poster. Occupying a cor
ner spot on California Avenue across Printer's Inc, C&C is
part of a large chain of Comics and Comix stores that
includes a branch in San Francisco.
As comic shops go, C&C Palo Alto is a good one. With a
wide selection of everything from graphic novels and hard
cover artwork collections to a reasonably large selection of
back issues, action figures and models, it's easy to spend
money. The selection of new comics is complete, with a
separate section for new (recently shipped) comics, wall

racks for comics shipped in
the past few months and
boxes of plastic-bagged
back issues of a wide vari
ety of titles. C&C carries all
of the titles from Marvel
and DC, and most of the
popular independent comic
titles as well.
If you need help deciding
what to buy, the staff at
C&C is more than willing to
help. They are surprisingly
well informed on what's
going on both in the comic
books themselves and with
the various comics produc
tion teams.
You can ask them ques
tions like "How did Danny
Ketch become Ghost Rider,
replacing Johnny Blaze, pre
viously the sole claimant to
the title 'The Living Spirit of

Vengeance'?" or "Is that
rumor true that Jim Lee is no longer going to be pencilling
the X-Men?" (By the way, that rumor is true.) There is even
a C&C "hotline, updated several times weekly, that lists the
comics that have just been shipped on a certain date. This
way you can make sure the issues you're looking for are in
before you make the trip.
Even if you're not a hard-core comics fan, you're bound to
find a funny Star Trek post-card to send to a friend, a role
playing game for your little brother, a poster for your room,
a model of the Enterprise-D, or even hockey cards. ("Hey,
you've got doubles of Wayne Gretzky?!")
