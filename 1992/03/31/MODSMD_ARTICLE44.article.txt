It was Thomas Jefferson who said,
"Behind every great bookstore stands a
great poetry section." Or maybe that
was Emerson.
Anyway, I tried to keep that thought
in mind as I entered City Lights Book
store, because if I'd started judging the
place from the outside I would have
started around negative 42 in the Book
store Rating Index.

We reached City Lights only after
walking past several blocks of high-pro
file clubs that only allow you in if
you're prepared to pay a quarter for a
special screening booth.
Inside, the poetry room looked like
the rest of the store — a used bookstore
that someone had mistakenly filled
with new books. A lot of them.
In 1956, City Lights Books in San
Francisco published "Howl," a book of
poetry by Alan Ginsberg. After a court

battle over censorship, the book was
released. The book, and especially the
title poem, became one of the literary
cornerstones of the Beatnik genera
tion.
"I have seen the best minds of my
generation . . the poem begins, and
goes on to describe the trials those
minds endure.
Now, 35 years later, I was standing
in City Lights Bookstore, right next to
the Beatnik section — shelves full of
Ginsberg, Kerouac and Dylan. Shuf
fling past me was a man who might
have been one of those minds. He was
not exceedingly elderly, but he looked
almost as worn out as the drab olive
jacket he wore draped over his bony
shoulders.
"Do you know where I can find some
penny westerns?" he asked.
I told him I didn't and suggested he
ask the person at the bookstore's infor
mation booth. But I had already lost
him. Arrested by a tiny black-and-white
postcard tacked to the wall, he pointed
at it and asked no one in particular,
"Do you suppose that's Mr. Hyde?"
The old man may have eventually
found his penny westerns, because, as I
soon discovered, the selection of books
at City Lights is remarkably eclectic. In
the basement I found a Green section
for earthno-ecology types, as well as a
Red section for the Marxists in the
crowd. Gay studies was big, and so was
"Commodity Aesthetics" (which means,
I guess, the study of how to evaluate
the comeliness of porkbellies).
City Lights Bookstore proudly dis
plays artifacts from its glorious, rebel
lious past. They are strewn about the
walls of the store in the form of
abstract posters, photos of demonstra
tions, portraits of various Beat writers,
and articles from the time. This place
even smells historic — the upstairs like
dusty wooden shelves and the basement
like damp stone walls.
It is a strange contrast: the raw
energy of Beat poetry resting upon
placid, dusty shelves. But all of its spirit
is not dead, for City Lights retains its
eclectic standards and willingness to
take risks with what it publishes and
offers for sale. At City Lights you will
find not only poetry by such notables as
sometime Stanford professor Denise
Levertov, but also copies of SLUT mag
azine, a locally published — well,
Xeroxed really — rag.
So don't go to City Lights looking for
a host of hand-picked classics. You'll
find some gems, but only after wading
through some distinctly "alternative"
literature.
