# Uplifting Melodies
## Enjoy a night on the town with the San Francisco Symphony 
### James Kuffner 
This Friday night you could partake in a San Francisco
cultural adventure. Picture this: you leave behind your t-shirt
and shorts in favor of your seldom-used, semi-formal attire;
you wine and dine upon the culinary delights of downtown;
and finally, you top off the evening with a cool, brisk walk
down Van Ness Avenue toward Davies Symphony Hall for an
evening performance by the San Francisco Symphony.
Surprisingly, such an outing is not restricted to the afflu
ent, highbrow population of the Bay Area. It is actually with
in the reach of all music enthusiasts, even those under the
constraints of a limited student budget. Every Stanford stu
dent should spend at least one evening listening to the deli
cate sounds, seeing the flash of a baton, and experiencing the
power of a full orchestra's live performance.
Celebrating its 80th season, the San Francisco Symphony is
internationally renowned for its diverse repertoire and distin
guished guest conductors and soloists. Under the direction of
Herbert Blomstedt since 1985, the Symphony has garnered sev
eral distinctions, and was recently awarded the 1991 Gramo
phone Award for the Best Orchestral Recording of the year.
But one doesn't have to be a classical music buff to enjoy
the beautiful sounds of the San Francisco Symphony. Pro
grams are arranged with the novice concert-goer in mind,
and every subscription concert is preceded by a free pre-con
cert talk entitled "Inside Music." These lively and informa
tive discussions, presented by a symphony staff member one
hour prior to the performance, introduce the composers and
the works that are to be performed.
All of the Symphony's regular concerts are held in Davies
Symphony Hall, a modern, architecturally alluring, building
that is the permanent home for the vibrant sounds of San
Francisco's premier orchestra. Built in the 19705, the Hall
features a massive, 9,000-pipe Ruffatti organ behind center
stage, and a grand lobby with hundreds of glass panels offer-

ing a silent view of the city's
traffic.
Inside the auditorium, one
immediately notices the
uniqueness and modernity of
the design. The first balcony
extends along the side walls,
and continues above and
behind the orchestra in a
semicircle. Suspended above
the stage are unusual, con
vex, plexiglass panels that are
actually computer-controlled
sound reflectors that can be
raised or lowered individually
in order to enhance the
acoustics in the auditorium.
In most areas of the hall,
the sound is fine, excepting
perhaps the side extremities
and the seats behind the
orchestra. (However, even
though the latter seats are
not the best acoustically,
they certainly provide a
rare opportunity to sit up
close and observe the
orchestra.) The hall is cur-

rently undergoing major acoustical reconstruction, and will
close in mid-April as the final stage in its $10 million reno
vation begins.
Besides getting the chance to hear a top-notch orchestra,
attending a San Francisco Symphony concert is also a chance
to experience a different cultural atmosphere. Relative to other
symphony halls around the country, audiences in San Francis
co generally dress more casually (one wouldn't feel out of place
wearing a nice sweater). In addition, there are proportionately
more students in attendance, especially at concerts that are

part of the Wednesday and Friday Student Concert Series.
For those who fear slipping into slumber during the perfor
mance (after pulling an all-nighter, it can sometimes be
unavoidable), one popular place to get a breath of fresh air
during intermission or before the concert is the outdoor bal
cony, accessible by the second tier lobby. This balcony provides
a panoramic view of the sparkling San Francisco skyline.
So you've decided to go to the Symphony with your dorm,
or even better yet, your date, and you are wondering what to
do after the concert. Here are a few suggestions that are
within walking distance from Davies Symphony Hall:
Max's Opera Cafe: An immensely popular hangout both
before and after concerts, this restaurant is known for its

waiters and waitresses who
sing arias and excerpts from
famous operas. The desserts
at Max's are always deli
cious and come in large por
tions.
Stars: This somewhat
expensive grand cafe fea
tures an upbeat 1920s atmo
sphere with live piano jazz.
The crowd is usually young,
and the desserts rival Max's.
Like Max's, Stars is always
crowded after a Symphony
performance, so dash out
the door after the concert to
get a seat.
Spuntino: If you don't
want to wait for a seat at
Max's or Stars, you should
hit Spuntino for a good cup
of coffee and a post-Sympho
ny snack. The cheesecake is
particularly good. The atmo
sphere at Spuntino is quieter
and more yuppie than Stars,
but nevertheless conducive
to a good conversation.

part of the Wednesday and Friday Student Concert Series.
For those who fear slipping into slumber during the perfor
mance (after pulling an all-nighter, it can sometimes be
unavoidable), one popular place to get a breath of fresh air
during intermission or before the concert is the outdoor bal
cony, accessible by the second tier lobby. This balcony provides
a panoramic view of the sparkling San Francisco skyline.
So you've decided to go to the Symphony with your dorm,
or even better yet, your date, and you are wondering what to
do after the concert. Here are a few suggestions that are
within walking distance from Davies Symphony Hall:
Max's Opera Cafe: An immensely popular hangout both
before and after concerts, this restaurant is known for its

waiters and waitresses who
sing arias and excerpts from
famous operas. The desserts
at Max's are always deli
cious and come in large por
tions.
Stars: This somewhat
expensive grand cafe fea
tures an upbeat 1920s atmo
sphere with live piano jazz.
The crowd is usually young,
and the desserts rival Max's.
Like Max's, Stars is always
crowded after a Symphony
performance, so dash out
the door after the concert to
get a seat.
Spuntino: If you don't
want to wait for a seat at
Max's or Stars, you should
hit Spuntino for a good cup
of coffee and a post-Sympho
ny snack. The cheesecake is
particularly good. The atmo
sphere at Spuntino is quieter
and more yuppie than Stars,
but nevertheless conducive
to a good conversation.

This Friday night you could partake in a San Francisco
cultural adventure. Picture this: you leave behind your t-shirt
and shorts in favor of your seldom-used, semi-formal attire;
you wine and dine upon the culinary delights of downtown;
and finally, you top off the evening with a cool, brisk walk
down Van Ness Avenue toward Davies Symphony Hall for an
evening performance by the San Francisco Symphony.
Surprisingly, such an outing is not restricted to the afflu
ent, highbrow population of the Bay Area. It is actually with
in the reach of all music enthusiasts, even those under the
constraints of a limited student budget. Every Stanford stu
dent should spend at least one evening listening to the deli
cate sounds, seeing the flash of a baton, and experiencing the
power of a full orchestra's live performance.
Celebrating its 80th season, the San Francisco Symphony is
internationally renowned for its diverse repertoire and distin
guished guest conductors and soloists. Under the direction of
Herbert Blomstedt since 1985, the Symphony has garnered sev
eral distinctions, and was recently awarded the 1991 Gramo
phone Award for the Best Orchestral Recording of the year.
But one doesn't have to be a classical music buff to enjoy
the beautiful sounds of the San Francisco Symphony. Pro
grams are arranged with the novice concert-goer in mind,
and every subscription concert is preceded by a free pre-con
cert talk entitled "Inside Music." These lively and informa
tive discussions, presented by a symphony staff member one
hour prior to the performance, introduce the composers and
the works that are to be performed.
All of the Symphony's regular concerts are held in Davies
Symphony Hall, a modern, architecturally alluring, building
that is the permanent home for the vibrant sounds of San
Francisco's premier orchestra. Built in the 19705, the Hall
features a massive, 9,000-pipe Ruffatti organ behind center
stage, and a grand lobby with hundreds of glass panels offer-

ing a silent view of the city's
traffic.
Inside the auditorium, one
immediately notices the
uniqueness and modernity of
the design. The first balcony
extends along the side walls,
and continues above and
behind the orchestra in a
semicircle. Suspended above
the stage are unusual, con
vex, plexiglass panels that are
actually computer-controlled
sound reflectors that can be
raised or lowered individually
in order to enhance the
acoustics in the auditorium.
In most areas of the hall,
the sound is fine, excepting
