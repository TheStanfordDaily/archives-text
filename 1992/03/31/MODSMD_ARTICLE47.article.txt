# More than Tu-tus and Toe shoes
## SAN JOSE CLEVELAND BALLET SHOWS OFF VIVID COLOR AND DYNAMIC MOVEMENT 
### Tracy Shinn 
I had never been to "the Ballet." I
hoped I would feel wonderfully cul
tured, yet at the same time anticipated
boredom and feared rejection by the
social elite that I was sure would domi
nate the audience. Did I really have to
go? llow important could tu-tus and toe
shoes be? But I knew that, as a service
to my beloved Stanford community, I
had to venture out into that threaten
ing world of people who know their
pickle forks from their shrimp forks
and bring back an enlightening lesson
in sophistication.
It was in this frame of mind that I
salied forth to witness the San Jose
Cleveland Ballet's performance of
"Suite Caracteristique," "Wu T'ai
Shih," and"The Unsung." Was I in for
a surprise.
I was dressed moderately nicely
(slacks and a sweater), and I blended
right in. No one gave me the "What the
!@*# are you doing here?" look that I
had been bracing myself for. I sat
myself down in a surprisingly comfort
able seat, still skeptical, and awaited
the appearance of the ballerinas â€” sev
eral animated clones of the figure that
had stood atop my jewelry box when I
was a girl, I was sure.
Wrong again. They were vibrant col
ored banners; detailed costumes
imbued with character (I had never pic
tured tu-tus quite like these); both pow
erful and delicate musical accompani
ments by the San Jose Symphony
Orchestra; and, best of all, amazingly
agile, athletic, commanding dancers.
They glided, they leaped, they spun,
and they performed. The company was

thoroughly engaged in its presentation,
communicating physically with the
audience. It was not simply a delicate
showcase of pretty movement.
It was a (dare I say it?) multicultural
evening, starting off with Artistic

Director Dennis
Nahat's "Suite Car
acteristique," set to
Tchaikovsky's Suite
N0.2 in C, Opus 53.
This piece displayed
its Eastern Euro
pean roots with col
orful Gypsy-esque
costumes and festive
accordion music.
Then came Jose

Limon's powerful work, "The
Unsung." This dramatic tribute to the
Native American is composed of an all
male cast of dancers whose perfor
mance is accompanied only by the
sounds of their own movements. The
intensity of the performance was strik
ing, and the strength, grace and digni
ty of the Native American were
uncompromisingly conveyed. Finally,
San Jose Cleveland closed the
evening's performance with "Wu T'ai
Shih," a colorful, dynamic piece which
combines traditional dance with the
martial arts.
An eclectic presentation to say the
least. Not elitist and definitely not
superficial, San Jose Cleveland had
conquered my skepticism.
Organized in 1985 as a cooperative
venture in innovative arts financing,
the San Jose Cleveland Ballet performs
in both cities, sharing artistic staff,
dancers, sets and costumes. The compa
ny has 60 ballets in its repertoire,

including classics such as "Swan Lake"
and "Romeo and Juliet" along with
original works by Artistic Director Den
nis Nahat and others. Nahat's remark
able career has included such diverse
projects as performing on Broadway,

choreographing for opera, television
and movies, and staging Shakespearean
plays. He has worked with such greats
as Martha Graham and Antony Tudor,
and last season drew Rudolf Nureyev to
San Jose Cleveland for the American
premier of "The Overcoat."
As artistic director, Nahat has
sought to make San Jose Cleveland "a
dancer's company," emphasizing the
atricality and technical achievement.
Unquestionably, he has developed the
company into a vital, vibrant compo
nent of the California cultural scene.

Jose. Tickets are available through
