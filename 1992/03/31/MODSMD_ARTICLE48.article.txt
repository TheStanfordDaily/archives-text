# Try It, Its Good for You

As Mary Poppins was fond of saying,
a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine
go down. Going to the theater ranks as
one of the more palatable ways to be
spoon-fed a dose of "culture."
Hut even with the many theater
going opportunities available on-cam
pus, in neighboring communities and in
the City, most of us rarely find our
selves partaking in the dramatic arts.
The main obstacle: accessibility.
Theater sometimes just isn't accessi
ble, whether physically, financially or
intellectually (to those without a mas
ter's degree in drama). Luckily, San
Francisco's American Conservatory
Theater provides a delectable way to
get your fill of entertainment that's
both a good time and "good for you.'
Now celebrating its silver anniver
sary, ACT enjoys a reputation as one of
the premiere regional theaters in the
country. Perhaps its greatest strength
is the variety of productions it presents
each year, with at least one show guar
anteed to suit your tastes.
ACT is one of the most accessible

San Francisco theaters in a variety of
ways, including its location, only a
short walk from the Powell Street or
Civic Center BART stations, eliminat
ing the pesky S.F. parking problem. Its
cost is not overly prohibitive either,
with low-price preview shows, student
rush tickets and special school group
matinees.
Naturally, ACT presents the classics,
such as this season's recent production
of "Cyrano de Bergerac." Quite often
ACT dresses up these older shows by
adding a little twist. Shakespeare's
"Twelfth Night "with a Caribbean
motif? Oedipus as a gospel-tinged musi
cal? ACT does it all, making you won
der why CIV can't be this entertaining.

Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" with a
Caribbean motif? Oedipus as a gospel-tinged
musical? ACT has done it, making you won
der why CIV can't be this entertaining.

The company also takes pride in pre
senting world premieres of new plays.
The opportunity to see shows that may
one day play on Broadway (at much
higher prices) is a rare treat that ACT
regularly offers, such as last season's
"Food and Shelter" about a homeless
family camping out at Disneyland.
Prominent Broadway shows like this
season's "The Piano Lesson," about the
African-American experience, also pass
through ACT.
ACT's national prominence also
allows it to attract some amazing talent,
much of which is cultivated in its own
in-house training program, one of the
most selective around. Noted character
actors â€” the kind whose faces make you
