# Law grants students access to admissions records

Have you ever wondered why you got
into Stanford? Under one interpretation of
a federal law, you have a right to know.
Harvard alumnus Joshua Gerstein
cited the 1974 Federal Educational Records
Privacy Act in March of last year after Har
vard balked at his earlier request to see
"reader comments" admissions officers
wrote about his application.
The Department of Education, the agen
cy reponsible for enforcing FERPA, even
tually ruled in Gerstein's favor. Harvard —
and by implication all schools that receive
federal money — could either comply with
the law or risk losing funding.
Gerstein, a former Harvard Crimson
editor, has invited several student newspa-

pers, including The Daily, to examine
admissions practices at their universities.
But when nearly two dozen Stanford
students — most of whom are on The Daily
staff — requested their information in mid-
March, Dean of Admissions James Mon
toya turned them down.
Yesterday, after Montoya learned of the
Department of Education's ruling, he
changed his mind. He said he would pre
sent the information to Assoc. General

Counsel Iris Brest for a formal interpreta
tion of the law.
If Stanford must comply, he said, stu
dents will be allowed to see their records.
Stanford maintains "work cards" of
admissions officers' comments for three
years and then shreds them, according to
an admissions office insider.
The admissions office refers to these
cards to get perspective on the selection
process, Montoya said, to create "a better
understanding of why certain students
were more successful" during their years at
Stanford.
This practice makes it likely that the
University will have to comply with the
law.
In Harvard's case, the Department of
Education's Family Compliance Office
Director Leßoy Rooker ruled that similar

comments written by admissions officers,
called "summary sheets," were education
records and therefore subject to FERPA.
Rooker defined education records as all
documents maintained by an educational
institution or proxy that contain informa
tion directly related to a student.
Students must enroll in the university
to have access to their records. Former stu
dents also have access to their records,
Rooker said.
A front-page story in the April 1 issue of
The Chronicle of Higher Education said
admissions officers were "disturbed" by the
intimate access to the admissions process
afforded by Rooker's interpretation.
