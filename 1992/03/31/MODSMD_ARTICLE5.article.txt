# Law grants students access to admissions records

### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
Have you ever wondered why you got
into Stanford? Under one interpretation of
a federal law, you have a right to know.
Harvard alumnus Joshua Gerstein
cited the 1974 Federal Educational Records
Privacy Act in March of last year after Har
vard balked at his earlier request to see
"reader comments" admissions officers
wrote about his application.
The Department of Education, the agen
cy reponsible for enforcing FERPA, even
tually ruled in Gerstein's favor. Harvard —
and by implication all schools that receive
federal money — could either comply with
the law or risk losing funding.
Gerstein, a former Harvard Crimson
editor, has invited several student newspa-

pers, including The Daily, to examine
admissions practices at their universities.
But when nearly two dozen Stanford
students — most of whom are on The Daily
staff — requested their information in mid-
March, Dean of Admissions James Mon
toya turned them down.
Yesterday, after Montoya learned of the
Department of Education's ruling, he
changed his mind. He said he would pre
sent the information to Assoc. General

Counsel Iris Brest for a formal interpreta
tion of the law.
If Stanford must comply, he said, stu
dents will be allowed to see their records.
Stanford maintains "work cards" of
admissions officers' comments for three
years and then shreds them, according to
an admissions office insider.
The admissions office refers to these
cards to get perspective on the selection
process, Montoya said, to create "a better
understanding of why certain students
were more successful" during their years at
Stanford.
This practice makes it likely that the
University will have to comply with the
law.
In Harvard's case, the Department of
Education's Family Compliance Office
Director Leßoy Rooker ruled that similar

comments written by admissions officers,
called "summary sheets," were education
records and therefore subject to FERPA.
Rooker defined education records as all
documents maintained by an educational
institution or proxy that contain informa
tion directly related to a student.
Students must enroll in the university
to have access to their records. Former stu
dents also have access to their records,
Rooker said.
A front-page story in the April 1 issue of
The Chronicle of Higher Education said
admissions officers were "disturbed" by the
intimate access to the admissions process
afforded by Rooker's interpretation.
Frank Burtnett, executive director of
the National Association of College Admis-
sion Counselors, told the Chroni
cle, "You are going to see people
being a lot less candid" in their
comments.
Montoya, however, doesn't
share Burtnett's concern.
"The admissions staff is very
thoughtful and in tune with
issues of bias," he said. "We have
worked very hard to ensure we
have an admission process that is
as bias-free as possible."
Gerstein, whose own work
card described him as a "budding
journalist. . . a bit self-congratu
latoiy," said part of his interest in
the project was to detect bias on
the part of admissions officers.
Montoya's only concern, he
said, is that high school teachers
and counselors would be afraid to
write honestly about students if
they could get access to those
comments.
Because Stanford does not
require applicants to sign a waiv
er relinquishing their rights to

mation will see the one- to three

mendations that appear on Stan
ford's work cards.
In the future, applicants may
be asked to waive their rights to
this information, Montoya said.
Another solution would be to
shred the comments before stu
dents enroll, he said.
