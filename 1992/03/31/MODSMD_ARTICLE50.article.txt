# On (and Off) the Road Again
## Tear your bike away from those familiar campus routes and explore new terrain 
### Coulter Richardson 
Stanford is practically its own Utopia — a nice campus, a
nice climate, a nice student body and a plethora of social
events. It does lack one very important thing, though —
environmental diversity. But nearby, there are beautiful,
interesting places to visit, and you can get there by bicycle.
The following tips will hopefully expose you to the many
places to ride your road or mountain bikes. It's up to you
how far to go. Trips closer to campus will start off the guide.
But first, go buy a map. You won't need to bring it with you,
but it's important to look at it once, just to get a picture of
where you are and where you want to be.
The Dish: Three years ago I might have suggested riding
your mountain bike up by the Dish, but that has been illegal
since 1989, so save yourself a ticket and don't do it. It does bring
up a good point, however, about how you should ride. When rid
ing on trails, stay on them so you don't trample the environ
ment. Trailblazers were responsible for the ban on bikers.
Also, you should always wear a helmet — bikes don't have
seat belts. Finally, if a car beeps at you, wave back. If the
motorist was being friendly, then you reciprocated. If they
were being obnoxious, then you confused them.
Arastradero Preserve (Mtn. Bike): Take Alpine Road
toward the mountains and turn left on Arastradero Road
right by Rossoti's. Alpine is fiat but there is usually a head
wind going out — and a tailwind coming home. There are
two entrances to the preserve along the road on the right
side that are hard to miss. Once inside, just go exploring.
Round Trip: 12-15 miles.
Dirt Alpine (Mtn. Bike): r I 'ake Alpine Road and never
leave it. Alpine will climb after passing Portola Road, steeply
for about 700 feet, but gently from then on. You'll pass over
the San Andreas Fault along the way. Climb about two miles
until you get to a gate. Thow your bike over the gate (it's
legal), and you're on Dirt Alpine, a fire road.
This road also climbs for about four miles, all dirt. You may
cringe at the thought of climbing for six miles, but the joy of
this ride is that once you get to the the top where Alpine meets
Page Mill and turn around, it's all downhill and tailwind home.
Round trip is about 25 miles but the second half is easy. All
along Alpine there are great tall trees, long shady stretches
and some beautiful vistas. You could drive to the beginning of
the climb to shorten the ride . . . but that's cheating.

If a car beeps at you, uuaue back. If
the motorist was being friendly, then
you reciprocated, if they lucre being
obnoxious, then you confused them.

L.A. Hills (Road Bike): Take Foothill south for three to
four miles, turn right into Los Altos Hills and go explore. A
good sense of direction is helpful, but if you get lost, find a big
ger road and follow it to Highway 280 or Foothill. Either will
help you orient yourself.
There are endless rows of beautiful houses to drool over,
and quite a few ugly ones too. Most of them are of modest size,
say 4,000 square feet. Round trip: 12-20 miles.
The Noon Loop (Road Bike): I won't bother giving
directions, it's too confusing. This loop takes you through
many beautiful tree lined roads. There's a nice view at the

top of Sand Hill Road, if it's not too smoggy.
Meet the Stanford Cycling Team at 3:30 p.m. by the post
office, with your helmet. Mondays and Fridays are the easy
days, if you're afraid of them going too fast. They always
make sure everyone gets home. Round trip: 22 miles.
Canada Road (Road Bike): Take Sand Hill to the
foothills, and take a right on Whiskey Hill Road, then left on
Woodside Road/Highway 84. At the bottom of the hill, take a
right onto Canada Road. Canada goes all the way out to
Highway 92, which is where most people turn around.
This route is wide open and sunny. Like Alpine, there
tends to be a headwind going out, and tailwind coming home,
but the terrain is more undulating.
There's plenty to see. The Santa Cruz Mountains on your

left are often shrouded in clouds, creeping over the top and
flowing down the sides like white lava. The Pulgas Water
Temple, a Grecian temple dedicated to the water we depend
on, is right out of a Homerian epic or Star Trek episode. It is
often the site of weddings, and rightly so.
There's also the San Andreas Resevoir, where much of the
Bay gets it's water, sparking in the sun. The topographic
images left by the receding water is a testament to how much
there was or could be.
Canada tends to be cooler farther out, so look forward to it
if it's hot, but bring a jacket if it's already cool out. On the
way back, just before Edgewood Road, if you look to the right
you will see the roof of a very large house. That is the Filoli
mansion, where they filmed the opening sequence to
Dynasty. Round trip: 28 miles.
Arastradcro State Preserve (Mtn. Bike): Take Dirt
Alpine to the intersection of Page Mill Road and turn left. Go
about a half-a-mile and turn right into the preserve. Maps of
the trails are available. Stevens Creek Park is a good ride —
mostly downhill with sharp hairpins and single tracks.
Watch out for the creek, which will probably be flowing this
time of year. You will cross it twice. The second time is fasci
nating but dangerous. The dirt will have turned to pavement
by now and the stream cascades over the road. Go straight
though and slow down before or after you cross it, not while in
it, or else you will lock up your rear and eat it. You will come
out on Stevens Canyon Road. This passes by another resevoir
and feeds into Foothill Expressway. Round Trip: 40 miles.
Kings/Canada (Road Bike): This is one of the best. Take
Woodside Road to Kings Mountain Road and turn right. Kings
will climb for about four miles at about seven to 10 percent. This
is not for the weak. It will take about a half hour to get to Skyline
Boulevard, but the flora, fauna and vistas are rewarding.
At Skyline turn right and go to Highway 92. Skyline will
roll for about four miles and then go downhill to 92. If it is
clear you can see the coast on your left, and San Francisco and
Oakland to your right. Turn Right at Highway 92, which is
also downhill, and come home on Canada Road, (with tail
wind). The total climbing is about 2,700 feet in about 40 miles.
Ride safe, and remember, you can do more than you think
vou can and feel better about it too.

This route is wide open and sunny. Like Alpine, there
tends to be a headwind going out, and tailwind coming home,
but the terrain is more undulating.
There's plenty to see. The Santa Cruz Mountains on your

left are often shrouded in clouds, creeping over the top and
flowing down the sides like white lava. The Pulgas Water
Temple, a Grecian temple dedicated to the water we depend
on, is right out of a Homerian epic or Star Trek episode. It is
often the site of weddings, and rightly so.
There's also the San Andreas Resevoir, where much of the
Bay gets it's water, sparking in the sun. The topographic
images left by the receding water is a testament to how much
there was or could be.
Canada tends to be cooler farther out, so look forward to it
if it's hot, but bring a jacket if it's already cool out. On the
way back, just before Edgewood Road, if you look to the right
you will see the roof of a very large house. That is the Filoli
mansion, where they filmed the opening sequence to
Dynasty. Round trip: 28 miles.
Arastradcro State Preserve (Mtn. Bike): Take Dirt
Alpine to the intersection of Page Mill Road and turn left. Go
about a half-a-mile and turn right into the preserve. Maps of
the trails are available. Stevens Creek Park is a good ride —
mostly downhill with sharp hairpins and single tracks.
Watch out for the creek, which will probably be flowing this
time of year. You will cross it twice. The second time is fasci
nating but dangerous. The dirt will have turned to pavement
by now and the stream cascades over the road. Go straight
though and slow down before or after you cross it, not while in
it, or else you will lock up your rear and eat it. You will come
out on Stevens Canyon Road. This passes by another resevoir
and feeds into Foothill Expressway. Round Trip: 40 miles.
Kings/Canada (Road Bike): This is one of the best. Take
Woodside Road to Kings Mountain Road and turn right. Kings
will climb for about four miles at about seven to 10 percent. This
is not for the weak. It will take about a half hour to get to Skyline
Boulevard, but the flora, fauna and vistas are rewarding.
At Skyline turn right and go to Highway 92. Skyline will
roll for about four miles and then go downhill to 92. If it is
clear you can see the coast on your left, and San Francisco and
Oakland to your right. Turn Right at Highway 92, which is
also downhill, and come home on Canada Road, (with tail
wind). The total climbing is about 2,700 feet in about 40 miles.
Ride safe, and remember, you can do more than you think
vou can and feel better about it too.
Stanford is practically its own Utopia — a nice campus, a
nice climate, a nice student body and a plethora of social
events. It does lack one very important thing, though —
environmental diversity. But nearby, there are beautiful,
interesting places to visit, and you can get there by bicycle.
The following tips will hopefully expose you to the many
places to ride your road or mountain bikes. It's up to you
how far to go. Trips closer to campus will start off the guide.
But first, go buy a map. You won't need to bring it with you,
but it's important to look at it once, just to get a picture of
where you are and where you want to be.
The Dish: Three years ago I might have suggested riding
your mountain bike up by the Dish, but that has been illegal
since 1989, so save yourself a ticket and don't do it. It does bring
up a good point, however, about how you should ride. When rid
ing on trails, stay on them so you don't trample the environ
ment. Trailblazers were responsible for the ban on bikers.
Also, you should always wear a helmet — bikes don't have
seat belts. Finally, if a car beeps at you, wave back. If the
motorist was being friendly, then you reciprocated. If they
were being obnoxious, then you confused them.
Arastradero Preserve (Mtn. Bike): Take Alpine Road
toward the mountains and turn left on Arastradero Road
right by Rossoti's. Alpine is fiat but there is usually a head
wind going out — and a tailwind coming home. There are
two entrances to the preserve along the road on the right
side that are hard to miss. Once inside, just go exploring.
Round Trip: 12-15 miles.
Dirt Alpine (Mtn. Bike): r I 'ake Alpine Road and never
leave it. Alpine will climb after passing Portola Road, steeply
for about 700 feet, but gently from then on. You'll pass over
the San Andreas Fault along the way. Climb about two miles
until you get to a gate. Thow your bike over the gate (it's
legal), and you're on Dirt Alpine, a fire road.
This road also climbs for about four miles, all dirt. You may
cringe at the thought of climbing for six miles, but the joy of
this ride is that once you get to the the top where Alpine meets
Page Mill and turn around, it's all downhill and tailwind home.
Round trip is about 25 miles but the second half is easy. All
along Alpine there are great tall trees, long shady stretches
and some beautiful vistas. You could drive to the beginning of
the climb to shorten the ride . . . but that's cheating.

If a car beeps at you, uuaue back. If
the motorist was being friendly, then
you reciprocated, if they lucre being
obnoxious, then you confused them.

L.A. Hills (Road Bike): Take Foothill south for three to
four miles, turn right into Los Altos Hills and go explore. A
good sense of direction is helpful, but if you get lost, find a big
ger road and follow it to Highway 280 or Foothill. Either will
help you orient yourself.
There are endless rows of beautiful houses to drool over,
and quite a few ugly ones too. Most of them are of modest size,
say 4,000 square feet. Round trip: 12-20 miles.
The Noon Loop (Road Bike): I won't bother giving
directions, it's too confusing. This loop takes you through
many beautiful tree lined roads. There's a nice view at the

top of Sand Hill Road, if it's not too smoggy.
Meet the Stanford Cycling Team at 3:30 p.m. by the post
office, with your helmet. Mondays and Fridays are the easy
days, if you're afraid of them going too fast. They always
make sure everyone gets home. Round trip: 22 miles.
Canada Road (Road Bike): Take Sand Hill to the
foothills, and take a right on Whiskey Hill Road, then left on
Woodside Road/Highway 84. At the bottom of the hill, take a
right onto Canada Road. Canada goes all the way out to
Highway 92, which is where most people turn around.
