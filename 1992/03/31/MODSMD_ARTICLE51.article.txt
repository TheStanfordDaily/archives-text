# Take a Hike
## Venture beyond Campus Drive for a run or walk in a new environment 
### Jill Shenkle 
For runners, hikers or anybody who
appreciates the outdoors, the familiar
campus loops (the Dish, Campus Drive,
Lake Lag . . . the Dish, Campus Drive,
Lake Lag . . .the Dish . . .) can get a lit
tle monotonous. But if you're willing to
hop in a car or hit the road with your
bike or feet and venture a few miles off

Ambitious runners or
hikers should tackle
Wildcat, a popular loop
with lots of switchbacks

campus, numerous parks and preserves
await you. Here are a few places that
will put a little spice into your recre
ational activity. Guaranteed.
The first "fun running" is at Rancho
San Antonio Park â€” heaven for people
who enjoy running or walking on dirt
trails. Trails range from 1.75 to 8 miles
long, but combining trails can change
the distances and add variety. Ambi
tious runners or hikers should tackle
Wildcat, a popular loop with lots of
switchbacks. A special bonus at Rancho
San Antonio is the Deer Hollow Farm,
which provides the park with an abun

dance of plants and animals. An array of
fat, ugly pigs highlighted our last visit.
The park is located right off Highway
280 at the Foothill Expressway exit. A
right on Foothill and an immediate
right on Cristo Rey Drive will lead you
through some housing developments
and then to the park. Once at the park
entrance, the truly adventurous can
take off and explore the numerous
trails. However, for those who like to
know where they are going, trail maps
are provided. With a 20 to 40 minute
walk or jog, the whole excursion can be
done in less than an hour.
For a drastically different type of
scenery, away from the mountains and
hills and towards the bay, the Palo Alto
Baylands and Shoreline Park provide
good biking, running and walking. Both
of these parks are accessible by foot,
bike or car.
The Baylands is a Palo Alto city
park, located at the very end of Embar
cadero Road. There are a number of
mini-attractions here. On one side of
the road is a duck pond, and on the
other side are bay inlets and marshy
areas. Dirt trails lead in and around
these inlets. Not only are there good
trails to be walked on, but some of the
birds living off the marshes are enjoy
able to watch. To aid those who want to
know more about the habitat at the

Baylands, there is a small nature center
across the street.
For people who are tired of routine
walks, the Baylands has a unique route.
Across a marsh-like field of amber and
orange grains, there is a wooden walk
way. On these wide balance beams, one
can walk out to a vista point that over
looks the bay to the north. This is a
great spot to ponder the meaning of
life, the order of the universe, who you
should include in your draw group, and
other such weighty topics.
Shoreline at Mountain View Park is
just about two to three miles south of
the Baylands. At Shoreline, there are
both paved and dirt trails winding

around a golf course, a lake and a bay.
The tents of the Shoreline amphithe
atre, a major concert venue, are a beau
tiful backdrop for the grass, calm water
and rolling landscape within the park.
Pelicans, in addition to many other
birds and animals, can sometimes be
seen on the bay.
Not to be caught lacking in unique
attractions, Shoreline offers a stunt
kite flying area for those of you who
haven't brought out your stunt kite in
a while. (Actually, it looks just like a big
greener Wilbur Field, but it sounds fun
nonetheless.) There is also an "inter
pretive" nature trail with signs posted
around the park explaining the natural
occurences (wind, currents, tides, etc.)
in the area.
By car, Shoreline Park can be reached
off Highway 101. Exit on Shoreline Road
going east towards Century 10 movie
theaters and the Shoreline amphithe
ater, and follow Shoreline Road until it
ends at the park entrance. The park can
also be reached by foot or by bike from
Embarcadero Road or the pedestrian
bridge over Highway 101. Turn right off
Embarcadero and follow the Baylands
bike path to Shoreline park.
