# Beach Blankets and Sand Shovels
## Make a pie in Pescadero Marsh mud, or build a castle in Santa Cruz sand

Ah, California Beaches! Beautiful,
bikini-clad girls and strapping, Speedo
clad guys blissfully soaking up the Sun.
The Sand. The Surf. The Sea breeze.
But how many beaches can boast a
Marsh?
Pescadero Marsh Natural Preserve
This extraordinary site is one of the
largest and most ecologically diverse
coastal marshes in California. Picture a
combination of beach, swamp and for
est filled with over 180 species of birds
and 380 species of plant life. A West
Coast Everglades, if you will.

Picture a combination of
beach, swamp and for
est filled with over 1 so
species of birds and 380
species of plant-life. A
West Coast Everglades,
if ijou will.

Every Saturday throughout the
year, weather permitting, from 10:30
a.m.-12:30 p.m. and every Sunday
from 1-3 p.m. you can take a two-mile
guided tour of the area. If you're up
for a fairly involved hike and you want
a breathtaking, botanical, bird-watch
ing bonanza, then this is the place for
you.
A docent or park ranger will lead
you through the main part of the 587-
acre preserve, explaining the intricate
ecology and geology of the marshland.
The trail starts on Pescadero State
Beach and moves inland to where the
flora and fauna thrive. The serene,
twisty Pescadero and Bulano Creeks
add to the swamp effect. Eventually,
you travel up to the top of a large hill
where you can take a long, look over
the gorgeous California coast.
But be prepared. It can get cold at
Pescadero, even during the spring and
summer. So it is a good idea to take a
warm jacket and a few layers of clothes.
Sturdy shoes and thick socks are a
must, since there are ticks and poison
oak at several places all through the
trail, which can damage if they touch
your skin. Binoculars, a camera, a hat
and good physical stamina are also key.
After the tour, it is very refreshing
to go back onto the beach and have

lunch on the rocks. We were all hungry
when we finished our trek, and turkey
sandwiches tasted really good.
The Pescadero Marsh Natural Pre
serve is located just south of where
Highway 84 intersects Highway 1. Meet
in the first parking lot south of the
Highway 1 bridge over the Pescadero
lagoon. For more information, call
(415) 879-0832.
But there is another side to Califor
nia beaches. Let's say you want more
than just scenery and want to be
around more people. The answer lies
about an hour south of Stanford, in
Santa Cruz.
Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk
Fashioned in the style of old-time
amusement parks, like Coney Island,
the Santa Cruz Boardwalk offers a
large variety of rides, games, refresh
ments and gift shops. During the sum
mer there are often concerts and spe
cial attractions here. The Boardwalk is
open Saturdays and Sundays from 12
to 5 p.m.
Allow plenty of time to see as much
as you want of Santa Cruz without hav
ing to rush. It is easy to over-exert
yourself here, especially in the summer,
so be aware of your physical limita
tions. It is also a good idea to pack your
own food and drinks, since these items
are expensive on the Boardwalk.
Most rides on the Boardwalk cost
about two or three dollars, but they are
usually worth it. The longest lines tend
to be for the roller coaster, called the

Giant Dipper, and the log ride. If you
want to ride these, time goes faster
talking with a friend, doing a crossword
puzzle, or drinking a slushie while you
wait in line.
Santa Cruz also offers the wonder
fully warm sands and surf that many
of us East Coast Stanfordites expected
to find more of in California. The
Golden State may not actually be one
gigantic sandbox, but this beach is a
stellar example of the reality that
sparked the myth. As sure as the sun
rises, there are bound to be bronzed
bodies reclining on Santa Cruz's
beach, soaking up as many ultra-violet
rays as they can.
The Santa Cruz Boardwalk is located
two miles south of the intersection of
Highways 1 and 17. There are two
parking lots close to the Boardwalk, but
they fill up fast, so it is advisable to get
there early on peak days. Parking costs
$5. For more information about the
Boardwalk, call (408) 423-5593 or (408)
426-7433.

open Saturdays and Sundays from 12
to 5 p.m.
Allow plenty of time to see as much
as you want of Santa Cruz without hav
ing to rush. It is easy to over-exert
yourself here, especially in the summer,
so be aware of your physical limita

own food and drinks, since these items
are expensive on the Boardwalk.
Most rides on the Boardwalk cost
about two or three dollars, but they are
usually worth it. The longest lines tend
to be for the roller coaster, called the

want to ride these, time goes faster

puzzle, or drinking a slushie while you
wait in line.
Santa Cruz also offers the wonder
fully warm sands and surf that many
of us East Coast Stanfordites expected
to find more of in California. The

rays as they can.
The Santa Cruz Boardwalk is located
two miles south of the intersection of
Highways 1 and 17. There are two
parking lots close to the Boardwalk, but
they fill up fast, so it is advisable to get
there early on peak days. Parking costs
$5. For more information about the
Boardwalk, call (408) 423-5593 or (408)

Ah, California Beaches! Beautiful,
bikini-clad girls and strapping, Speedo
clad guys blissfully soaking up the Sun.
The Sand. The Surf. The Sea breeze.
But how many beaches can boast a
Marsh?
Pescadero Marsh Natural Preserve
This extraordinary site is one of the
largest and most ecologically diverse
coastal marshes in California. Picture a
combination of beach, swamp and for
est filled with over 180 species of birds
and 380 species of plant life. A West
Coast Everglades, if you will.

Every Saturday throughout the
year, weather permitting, from 10:30
a.m.-12:30 p.m. and every Sunday
from 1-3 p.m. you can take a two-mile
guided tour of the area. If you're up
for a fairly involved hike and you want
a breathtaking, botanical, bird-watch
ing bonanza, then this is the place for
you.
A docent or park ranger will lead
you through the main part of the 587-
acre preserve, explaining the intricate
ecology and geology of the marshland.
The trail starts on Pescadero State
Beach and moves inland to where the
flora and fauna thrive. The serene,
twisty Pescadero and Bulano Creeks
add to the swamp effect. Eventually,
you travel up to the top of a large hill
where you can take a long, look over
the gorgeous California coast.
But be prepared. It can get cold at
Pescadero, even during the spring and
summer. So it is a good idea to take a
warm jacket and a few layers of clothes.
Sturdy shoes and thick socks are a
must, since there are ticks and poison
oak at several places all through the
trail, which can damage if they touch
your skin. Binoculars, a camera, a hat
and good physical stamina are also key.
After the tour, it is very refreshing
to go back onto the beach and have

lunch on the rocks. We were all hungry
when we finished our trek, and turkey
sandwiches tasted really good.
The Pescadero Marsh Natural Pre
serve is located just south of where
Highway 84 intersects Highway 1. Meet
in the first parking lot south of the
Highway 1 bridge over the Pescadero
lagoon. For more information, call
(415) 879-0832.
But there is another side to Califor
nia beaches. Let's say you want more
than just scenery and want to be
around more people. The answer lies
about an hour south of Stanford, in
Santa Cruz.
Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk
Fashioned in the style of old-time
amusement parks, like Coney Island,
the Santa Cruz Boardwalk offers a
large variety of rides, games, refresh
ments and gift shops. During the sum
