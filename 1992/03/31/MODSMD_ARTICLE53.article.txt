# BARGAINS
## For San Jose Flea Market shoppers, there's a Blue-light Special at every booth, every day

For most of you, all the recession means is that
Daddy has to lease you an Acura instead of a BMW.
But for the rest of this country, the recession
means real sacrifices, like cutting down on Nintendo
cartridges and switching back to rotary phones. And,
as this recession drags on and on like a situation come
dy on location, many people find themselves facing the
question: "Are flea markets for me?"
So come along on the Gedanken experiment of the
'90s, a physical jaunt — but a mental trek — to the

nearby San Jose Flea Market, open Wednesday
through Sunday afternoons.
Upon taking the 13th Street exit off of U.S. High
way 101 south and approaching the mammoth garage
sale misnomered "the flea market," an overwhelming
thought immediately strikes the potential customer's
mind: "Three bucks for parking?"
Yes, it's three bucks for parking, but, as you'll soon
discover, that's something of a bargain in an economy
where huge pink rugs decorated with murals of the
last supper are valued at $15.
These kinds of introspections into and commen-

taries on American culture by no means end in
the parking lot. Quite the contrary, the flea
market offers more topics for a sociology
research paper than the Lollapalooza tour.
Take underwear, for instance. The women's
variety is scooped out of large crates as if the
Benny Hill Show were casting extras next door.
After a while, one becomes peculiarly accus
tomed to women stooped over mounds of three
for-$5, pink Jockeys-for-her. But the white,
synthetic-satin pairs with googly eyes and pink
mustaches never fail to jar one into a complete
ly new perspective — not to mention making
really swell Mother's Day gifts.
Three words sum up the experience of the
flea market: bargains, bargains, bargains. A
flea market regular named Mario Viramontez
sets up shop every Saturday and Sunday to sell
such items as used car stereos, used car phones,
used Nintendo sets, used jewelry and plenty of
spare tools.
Mario was slightly nebulous as to the source
of his wares, saying only that he gets his mer
chandise from "warehouses around here." And
although his products are in fine shape, he asks
a mere $50 for a complete Nintendo system —
and he's willing to bargain.
"You have to fight here to get the price," he
explained. "That's how it works."
So pervasive is this attitude that not even
the wrath of the Holy Trinity deters (lea mar
ket goers from haggling. Lorenzo's Religious
Supplies, run by Catholic Church member and
supporter Lorenzo Ro, sells such typical
Catholic trinkets as rosary beads ($3-$18) and
statuettes of Jesus, which range from 6 inches
($l2) to 4 feet ($80).
"Some people try to bargain," Ro said, "and I
let them, but it shows a lack of respect." Ro
seemed to take satisfaction in the fact that
although customers may be able to shave off a
few dollars now, they're sure to pay many times

over in eternal damnation.
The plethora of booths at the

flea market range from the

generic, where locals fill
empty crates with 99-cent

cans of Aqua Net, to the
specific, where booths
offer nothing but large,
standing, blatantly fake,
cloth house plants.
In fact, there's not an
American need that goes
unmet amid the acres and

acres of dead human con
sumption that make up

this garage sale with

an overblown pitu-

itary gland. Toys,
beauty supplies,
tires, old typewrit
ers, skateboards,
TVs and fishing
gear can be seen

within sight of each other. Bargain hunters can
even get a copy of their keys made while they
shop; and unless the words "Stanford Universi
ty, do not duplicate" also appear in Spanish on
the keys, odds are the friendly locksmith won't
give you a smidgen of trouble.
Even food can be purchased at the flea mar
ket. And as unappetizing as this may seem to
the first-time shopper, many a Palo Alto folk
has found it worth a few hours of slumming for
yams at three pounds for a dollar.
And the slummers come out in full force,
standing out like David Duke at a Parliament
Funkadelic concert. They come in their jogging
suits and gawk unabashedly at Simpsons
inspired, Bart Sanchez T-shirts which say "Que
pasa ese?" — proudly offering it forth to their
young children as some twisted version of mul
ticulturalism.
For those who have always dreamed of reliv
ing the episode of Little House on the Prairie
where the entire town of Walnut Grove gets
swindled of all its money, an auction house is
open on weekends. Second in excitement only
to actually being a studio audience member on
the Home Shopping Network, eager shoppers
at the auction house get to make exciting nois
es and offer money to a short, fat, untrustwor
thy man whose only semi-redeeming quality is
his ability to speak incredibly quickly — kind
of like buying tickets to a Van Morrison con
cert.
When you've finished all the shopping and
haggling you're little Gedanken can take, and
you and your enormous, pink last-supper rug
are about to head out into the parking lot to
find your Acura — you'll see a small toy, known
only as the "Amphibious Pal." This small
mechanical frog, which costs less than $7,
attempts to swim in a tiny tray of water, but it
succeeds only in knocking into the tray's side at
every stroke.
And you'll try to buy that Amphibious Pal,

but the man selling them won't take your dad's
American Express Gold card, and you'll be sad.

And then the meaning of this recession will

jump out at you, like a facial blemish

on Claudia Schiffer, and you'll

drown yourself in a large

body of water

Should've gone to Har-

vard after all, eh

Quentin?
