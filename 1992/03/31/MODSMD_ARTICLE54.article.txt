# Shopping, San Francisco Style

### Hope Flannery Illana Zauderer 
Union Street is a unique, beautiful
place to spend the day. This quaint little
spot provides an escape from the dol
drums of the everyday department stores
and shopping malls. It is a wonderful com
bination of distinctive shops that offer a
wide variety of items to suit the needs and
fancies of many different walks of life.
The Union Street atmosphere is
wonderful. The area's appearance is
one of a friendly little neighborhood,
made up of beautiful town houses deco
rated with well-kept flower boxes. But
as you take a closer look, you will notice
that unique shops and restaurants are
actually the residents of these charac
ter-laden buildings. This quaint setting
gives a fun, yet warm flavor to the place
as a whole.
The shops offer a huge selection of
merchandise, settings and prices. The
street hosts both distinctive specialty
shops and a myriad of well-known
chain stores. The designer stores show
case one-of-a-kind items ranging from
jewelry to clothing to novelties.

Antique British coffee tables,
engraved Chinese vases, art-deco wall
hangings and oriental rugs. Cashmere
sweaters and silk blouses, Italian suits
and crocodile leather shoes. Designer
teddy bears, amazingly deceptive plas
tic food, comical coffee mugs and fish
ties. It's all here, from smooth, polished
items for elite consumption to peculiar
gadgets perfect for practical jokesters.
Pimico boutique is a perfect example
of the extraordinary shops on Union
Street. This elegant shop is run by a
woman who travels all over the Far
East to find the gorgeous shawls, hats
and jewelry to be found her shop. The
personal service and beautiful trea
sures offered in this store are represen
tative of the magnificent quality found
all along the street.
You will also find the more well
known shops, such as Laura Ashley,
Banana Republic, Victoria's Secret, and
others tucked away in the nooks of
town houses. They too, are put togeth
er in first class style and offer all the
favorite items we know and love.
When you embark on your trip to this
lovely street, make sure to go with a

empty stomach, for you aren't going to
want to miss out on the food. Every type
is offered: Italian, Indian, Thai, Chinese
and French, in addition to great cafes and
delis. The quality of the food is fantastic,
and there is a colorful mixture of differ
ent atmospheres to choose from. Prices
come in all ranges, depending on the level
of dining at which you wish to indulge.
But save room for dessert! The
tempting aromas of bakeries, homemade
pies and fudge are prevalent throughout
the street. And for ice cream fans, there
is even a Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream shop
(one of our personal favorites).
So if you are looking for a relaxing
fun way to spend your Saturday, go
search this delightful place out. It
should not be missed!
