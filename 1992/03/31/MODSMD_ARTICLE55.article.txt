Do you ever get the urge to nosh? Does a mid-day snack of
bagels, smoked salmon and potato salad sound good to you?
Will coffee and a danish get you through the day? Well,
you're in luck.
Palo Alto offers a wide variety of high quality deli
catessens just off the Stanford campus. Each offers its own
comfortable atmosphere and tempting specialty foods. Peak
hours for these delis are usually from late morning to early
afternoon, so it is best to come at around 2 p.m. when they
are less crowded. Otherwise, just sit back and enjoy the food.
The Bagel Works, 642 Ramona, is a kosher deli with a
huge selection of bagels and sandwiches. For a moderate
price you can buy a bag of awesome smelling, freshly made
bagels, plus a container of butter, cream cheese, lox, or what
ever turns you on. The Egg Bagels and Raisin Bagels are
especially delicious. Perfect for a munchfest.
The Bagel Works also offers a wide range of meat and
non-meat sandwiches. If you order one, save plenty of room
because each is a meal by itself. The turkey sandwich is very
good and very filling.
The vegetarian sandwich, a deluxe compared with some
basic lettuce-and-tomato versions you may have encountered
elsewhere, also gets high marks for including sprouts, avoca
do, mushrooms and cheese along with the staples.
For a slightly different palate, the Stanford Delicatessen,
83 Stanford Shopping Center, offers a great variety of Middle
Eastern food. For a gustatory adventure, the specialties here
include hummus, babaganooj, tabuleh, falafel, dolmas and
baklava. Try them, particularly if you enjoy strong or spicy
tasting food. It will add tremendously to your multicultural
Stanford experience.
You'll also find many other deli favorites, including four
different kinds of lasagne, quiches, calzone, aram sandwiches
and an array of both cold-cut sandwiches and fancy salads.
The pasta with smoked salmon and the Greek village salad
are particularly agreeable to more conservative American
tastebuds. The cheesy and mild turkey lasagne is also recom
mended. Portions are generous, so come hungry.
With its crisp red and white decor, indoor and outdoor
seating and friendly service, the Stanford Delicatessen is the
perfect college off-campus hangout.
Finally, the Plantation Deli Cafe, 109 California Ave., is a
coffee-house type deli in a Southernesque setting. The menu
includes sandwiches, salads, quiches and daily specials, along

with every type of coffee drink imaginable, Italian sodas,
muffins, cookies, cakes and breads. The quiche is particular
ly good.
The Plantation's relaxed atmosphere, with its wood decor
and fans turning slowly overhead, and the pervasive aroma
of freshly brewed coffee, make this spot a great one for a
tasty study break. And don't worry, the southern theme isn't
taken so far as to include hats and boots on the staff or coun
try music. The Plantation is a good cafe for a light lunch,
snack or dessert.
