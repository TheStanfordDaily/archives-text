Like most people, I was told as a
child not to fill up on bread at restau
rants. And like most children, I didn't
enjoy the warnings — I wanted to
indulge my carbohydrate craving and
prove my mother wrong.
The Florentine Restaurant and
Pasta Market in is the place to do just
that.
Their bread — made, like their
pizza, from mondako flour and served
in pizza-like wedges with dill weed and
butter on top — defies the Bay Area's
obsession with white sourdough.
And because your mother may find
that the rest of the meal — from the
generic salad to the less-memorable
entrees — is anticlimatic, she'll wish
she had eaten more bread.
Attractive, well-lit and impeccably
clean, Florentine has almost everything
it takes to become a star attraction.
And indeed, locals fill the bar and wait
ing area on weekend evenings, making
reservations almost a necessity.

Italian restaurants fail, and that may
be the secret to its success in the
health-conscious south Bay Area.
Although some-what weak, the
sauces are light, taste healthy and leave
the customer feeling pleasantly full. You
can eat, and eat, and eat their PASTA,
and won't leave with the sickened greasy
feeling that many restaurants bequeath
to their most enthusiastic diners.
We also tried the tender veal piccata
and the salmon ravioli with basil cream
sauce. Our verdict: stick with the trdi
tional pasta — and the bread.
Manager Dan Vargas, who has been
at Florentine's for a year and a half,
says his philosophy is that "The cus
tomer always comes first.
"I tell my staff they're VIPs no mat
ter how they dress or how they look,"
said Vargas in a telephone interview.
His staff lived up to that command
the night we popped in. Waiter Bob
llollard was attentive and deferential,
bustling around to serve customers'
every whim and apparently taking joy
in the smallest of requests.
Florentine enjoys a wide diversity of
clientele, from dating couples to large
families who ordered Florentine's piz
zas, which we didn't try.
We did try the tiramisu, an Italian
lady finger cake topped with a tasty
chocolate sauce. It is memorable, a pos-

Florentine is a fine place to carbo
