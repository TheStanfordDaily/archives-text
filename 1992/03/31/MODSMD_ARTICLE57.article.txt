## Pesto

But it doesn't take too much to carve
out a niche in this neck of the woods,
and Florentine is living proof.
They take pride in their pasta, enu
merating its virtues in capital letters on
their red-and-green menus. "We make
our own PASTA products fresh every
day,"the menu reads.
And it shows The pasta is terrific,
well put together and cooked "to the
tooth," as they say in the trade.
It's the sauces that leave a little
something to be desired. Weakly fla
vored and, they let the rest of the meal
down, failing to create a dish that grabs
the customer and says "Remember me,
the PASTA."
But Florentine shines where many
