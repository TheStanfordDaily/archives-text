So, parents are coming to visit, eh? What to do, what to do. . .? When you've
got a midterm and you just don't have time to cart around mom and dad, cousin
Bill, aunt Mary or sister Suzy to all the hottest spots on and off the Farm, it often
seems like you've got no choice â€” you can't study. You know you're going to bomb
the exam, but what can you do? Well, here's the answer: send them on a tour. Let
someone else lead them in circles. And go study... (sigh).
So Uncle Bob likes Picasso? For art-lovers, San Jose Art Tours offers compre-

hensive tours of the galleries and museums in downtown San Jose. Eileen Bradshaw, founder
and director of the organization, takes her group through a walking tour of the vast San Jose
Museum of Art, plus six other fine art galleries. These exhibits include the Katia Lacoste
Gallery, the Bingham Gallery, and the Macchu Picchu Gallery of the Americas, which contains
Inca art. The route is flexible, depending on time and stamina, but usually lasts at least 3 hours.
Bradshaw, who has studied art for 10 years at San Jose State University, University of Cali
fornia at Irvine, Mission College and galleries throughout Europe, loves to pass on her knowl
edge and background of art to other people. Many friends she has made giving tours have writ
ten expressing their gratitude and satisfaction with her tours.
Bradshaw enjoys all art, but her main focus is on the 20th century. Most of the art seen on
the tour is modern and post-modern, with some traditional work, and involves oils, mixed
media, watercolors, installation, collage, assemblage, and photography. "Hopefully, people will
come back (from the tour) having gained new insights about contemporary art." Bradshaw said.
Bradshaw charges a flexible rate of $10 per person and lower group rates are applicable.
Tours run from 10:00 a.m.-6:00 p.m. Tuesdays-Saturdays. Call a day in advance at (408)295-
5368.
What if mom wants to look at houses? For those with an eye for architecture, one needn't
look further than Stanford's own back yard to suit his or her fancy. The Palo Alto-Stanford
Heritage Tour organization (PAST) offers two different historic walking tours of Palo Alto and
its early urban planning: the Downtown Palo Alto tour and the Professorville tour.
