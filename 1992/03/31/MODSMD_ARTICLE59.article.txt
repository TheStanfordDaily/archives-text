## Main Attractions 
### 
The Downtown Palo Alto Tour winds around one of the older parts
of the city and examines many houses built around the 19205. One of
the dominant styles of architecture is Spanish-Colonial Revival, which
is visually similar to the architecture on the Stanford campus. Meet at
the Palo Alto City Hall.
The Professorville Historic Tour shows the houses of the first pro
fessors to teach at Stanford. This tour combines a study of architec
ture with a human interest perspective on how these people lived and
how they helped create early Palo Alto. Meet at 1005 Bryant Street, at
the Addison St. intersection.

Fach tour leaves Saturdays at 10 a.m. and lasts about an hour. A $2 donation is requested

Cousin Billy (from Nebraska) wants to see The City? Well, the Bay Area just wouldn't be the
Bay Area without San Francisco. Sue Oksanen offers a special tour of The City through her
organization, (/lassie I ours Unlimited. A 1989 custom-designed van takes a maximum of twelve
people on an eight-hour excursion from the Stanford Shopping Center to San Francisco, and
back again. Oksanen also offers a tour of the wine country, lasting 11-12 hours, complete with a
choice of wine tasting, mineral baths, or shopping.
Oksanen tries to integrate as much history, geology, culture and sights as she can into the
time allotted, while still keeping a comfortable pace. One guest remarked, "The tour is not like a
tour, it's like seeing the city with a friend." Oksanen, describing her approach to tour guiding,
says,"I treat people as if they were my own personal guests and give many the best tour they've
had anywhere."
The San Francisco Tour costs $75 per person and includes a Continental breakfast, a full
restaurant lunch, a Cable Car ride, and the tour itself. The Wine Country Tour costs $80 per
person and includes Continental breakfast, restaurant lunch, and either tasting at two to three
