# Grad student work load increases as funds drop
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Stanford's $43-million bud
get deficit is not the only thing
forcing cuts within the School
of Humanities and Sciences.
In the wake of last year's
decentralization of the Office
of Graduate Studies, the school
is also facing a $1.5 million
reduction in University sup
port for graduate students.
Although each department
has proposed its own plan for
making up its share of the $1.5
million, almost all departments
in humanities and social sci
ences will require increased
teaching loads — something
that has upset many graduate
students already concerned
about the time it takes to com
plete a doctoral degree.
In addition, students say the

school's solution is only short
term because it relies upon fed
eral funding in the form of
tuition remission, which may be
ended by the government in the
next two years.
But many graduate stu
dents say they are not sur
prised by the current plans. It
is, they say, merely one more
example of the University's
lack of support for graduate
studies.
Students will teach more
Individual departments cur
rently set their own require
ments as to how many quarters
graduate students must be
teachers or research assistants
in their first four years. The
requirements range from zero
quarters in Asian languages to
all 12 quarters in the natural sci
ences, according to Assoc. Dean
Anne Peck.
The school will put into place in
fall a plan, individually tailored for
each department, to alter funding
for graduate students. The pro
posal's most prominent feature is
increased graduate-student teach
ing loads for many departments
that currently have low require
ments, according to Peck, who has
led the planning effort.
In addition to the significant
fiscal benefits, the plan is more
equitable because it makes the
teaching requirements more even
across departments, Peck said.
But according to David Schmid,
a graduate student in English and
Modern Thought and Literature,
equitable teaching loads should
not be the school's goal.
"Anne Peck does not have suf
ficient appreciation for differ
ences within Humanities and Sci
ences," he said.
For example, many of the 12
quarters of work responsibility in
the natural sciences are not teach
ing, but research closely associat
ed with a student's dissertation.
Peck said that in the humani
ties as well, "there should be some
relationship between a graduate
student's responsibilities in a
department and his or her disser
tation."
"Graduate students are often
preparing for academic careers, and
learning to teach is part and parcel
of that preparation," Peck said.
Plan lengthens time to degree
"The problem with this plan is
its effect on the time to completion
of a degree," Schmid said.
"Increasing teaching loads, in
addition to reducing summer
funding, will dramatically increase
the time to completion of a
degree."
German Studies graduate stu
dent Ellen Anderson, who is cur
rently required to teach for six

quarters, said the commitment
"definitely means it takes longer
to complete a degree.. .. We are
very frustrated and overbur
dened."
But Peck said the additional
teaching requirements will not
have a significant effect.
"It is of general concern, but it
is not a foregone conclusion that
increasing the teaching require
ment by one or two quarters will
dramatically increase the length
of time to completion," she said.
"There is virtually no relationship
between the time to a degree and
the number of classes a student is
required to teach."
Anthropology Chair George
Collier said that while progress to
the degree is "likely to slow down
some," his department has
"ingested some of our require
ments to compensate downward.
"Students may differ as to
their readiness to teach, and I
can't say this isn't going to pose
problems," he added.
In history, the four quarters
the department will require grad
uate students to teach is still
below the two years recommend
ed by the Mellon Foundation,
according to History Chair David
Kennedy.
The Mellon Foundation is a
strong advocate of reducing the
time it takes graduate students to
complete their doctorate, and the
University is currently negotiat
ing with the foundation to receive
a grant to fund graduate students
in English, anthropology, history
and philosophy.
Money may disappear
In the meantime, some stu
dents are questioning why the
school plans to secure more fund
ing from the staff benefits pool —
a source of support that may be
cut in the next several years as
the Office of Naval Research
redesigns its indirect-cost policies.
When graduate students work
as teaching or research assistants,
part of their tuition is billed to the
staff benefits pool as indirect
costs and is paid by the govern
ment. If a student works more

quarters, more tuition is paid by
the staff benefits pool and less
comes from the school's own
money.
"This solution will eventually
be a non-solution," said English
graduate student John Gonzalez.
"Given that [tuition remission] is
likely to be phased out in the next
three to five years, it is sleight-of
hand accounting."
Neither University adminis
trators nor Navy officials will dis
cuss the likelihood that tuition
remission will remain in effect,
but a decision will likely be made
by August.
Anthropology graduate stu
dent Diane Nelson said the Uni
versity is "merely changing the
group of money it is dipping into,
but it may not be there in the
future."
Peck said that she, too, is con
cerned about the future of the
staff benefits pool, but said rely
ing on that support was the only
course of action the school could
pursue.
"We have made the best set of
decisions we can given the infor
mation we have at the time the
decisions had to be made," Peck
said. "If we knew everything that
will happen in the next 18
months, we might not do this
plan.
"My approach was to try to
minimize the effects of the cur
rent deficit on the size of the
departments now," she added.
Peck said the alternative would
likely have been to force some
departments to reduce the num
ber of fellowships they offer —
possibly forcing some to close for
lack of a minimum number of
graduate students.
Departments benefit
But some chairs predict the
new plan will actually increase
support for graduate students in
their departments because the
school will provide them other
funding that is currently taken
away.
In the past, when graduate stu
dents obtained outside grants to
fund their tuition or research, the

department simply lost the fund
ing from the University. "There
used to be a 100 percent tax"
when students received outside
support, Collier said.
In the future, the funding will
instead be credited to the depart
ment. That will allow the Anthro
pology Department, for example,
to consider providing summer
support for students "to do the
kinds of things that are really
valuable," he said.
Kennedy said he hopes the His
tory Department could now offer
one or two more fellowships —
allowing more graduate students
to come to Stanford with financial
support.
"This plan creates an incentive
to encourage students to seek out
side awards more aggressively,"
he said.
Lack of commitment?
Many graduate students say
the disagreement over the current
plan exemplifies the inadequate
graduate-studies support provid
ed by the University.
"The long-term danger is that
we are getting into a situation
where the graduate programs and
whole package are less attractive
and less competitive with other
institutions," Schmid said. "The
combination of this plan plus the
negative publicity is going to have
an effect."
Peck said it is too early to tell
whether the plan might deter
future applicants, but said it is
"something we will have to look
at." She added that she had not
heard of any significant decline in
the number or quality of appli
cants this year.
But David Bradfute, a member
of the Cabinet Committee of Bud
get and Strategic Planning as well
as the Humanities and Sciences
liaison team and the graduate
studies cross-cutting theme
group, said insufficient study was
put into the plan.
"I really don't see anybody who
is looking at how graduate stu
dents' standard of living will be
impacted. That bothers me a lot,"
he said.
