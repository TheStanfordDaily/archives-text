# Dare to be Different

Imagine a tower that looks like a 1935 fruit cock
tail can but is actually a water tank. Or a lighthouse

that is also a storehouse of American surfing mem
orabilia. Or even a store that sells garlic lollipops

(yes, garlic lollipops). These bizarre little places
are hidden in areas right nearby Stanford, but

most people have probably missed seeing

them. Until now.
These Bay Area oddities are strange yet
historical, and they are sure to get a giggle
— or at least a curious stare — from a visit
ing friend who has asked you to show him or

her the less touristy, truly "unique" California
sights.
The Libby Can Water Tower

The fruity colors and motifs of the Libby Can Water
Tower provide a cheery contrast to the maze of somber grey
buildings in the Sunnyvale Business Park. The Can has
been a silent, but not so unchanged, witness to a farm town
that transformed itself to a high-tech center for the world.
The 100-foot tower, which was re-built in the shape of a
can in 1965, served as the water source for the Libby,
McNeil & Libby Cannery Co. The cannery dates back to the
early part of this century when businesses began tapping
California's blossoming fruit market. The Libbys started
shop in Sunnyvale in 1906 and continued for 75 years until
the silicon chips took over the landscape. At its peak in
1922, the cannery employed over 800 people during its busy
seasons.

The tower is connected with the his
torical roots of the city. In 1973, when
Libby changed its logo and tried to re
paint the tower, the Sunnyvale City
Planning Commission vetoed the paint
job in the name of tradition. But finally
in 1976, at a cost of $7,000, the tower
was painted to resemble a fruit cocktail
can.
The 150,000 gallon water tank was
honored with Sunnyvale Historical
Landmark status in 1984. To mark the
event the Can received another coat of
paint — a 25-gallon coat — so that the
slogan 'Fancy Fruit Salad' and the
glossy visuals of fruity fruits might keep
their luster.
Garlic World
The unending monotony of Highway
101 is disturbed by whiffs of garlic that
with the moving vehicle rapidly intensi
fies to block off anv other sense of smell.

If you are a garlic freak, off Monterey High-

way you will be enticed into a store that

the Vermoouth," garlic chewing gum
and garlic-flavored lollipops, to little

calls itself the Garlic World. It is

Gilroy, the "Garlic Capital of
the World," home of the spec-

tacular annual Gilroy Garlic
Festival.
The range of garlicky items in

Garlic World is a sheer tribute to

human ingenuity. From Tipsy Garlic
that says on its label "got too close to

key-chains proclaiming Gilroy to be "Gar
lic capital of the world," this place has it

all. The shop is also the proud owner of the
world-famous 215 foot long garlic braid.

Gilroy will prove to you that Garlic can be a
part of any meal. I wonder if they've tried gar-

lic pancakes?

The Santa Cruz Surfing Museum
The Mark Abbot Memorial Lighthouse is in perfect harmo
ny with the clear blue-green seas of Santa Cruz. In the sur
rounding waters, wailing seals perched on a rocks oversee all
human antics, while the startled ducks paddle briskly away
from any novice surfer.
The lighthouse contains the Santa Cruz Surfing Museum,
which is a collection of trivia and artifacts from American
surfing history. Old wooden surfboards — they weighed 105
pounds — and assorted equipment provide quite a contrast to

fiberglass, day-glow modern surfing
regalia.
The museum was opened in 1984,
after young surfer Mark Abbott died in
an accident just off the coast and his
parents decided to donate his life
insurance money to the creation of a
museum. There is an official plaque
dedicated to him at the lighthouse,
which reads: Mark Abbott, 18, "chal
lenged the sea and lost." This state
ment testifies to the spirit of adventure
that goaded the early surfers into the
rough seas, along with the danger that
awaited them there.
If you're lucky, you might get to talk
to one of the founding members of the
Santa Cruz Surfing Club. The club was
founded in the 19305, when there were
fewer than 30 surfers in the country,
all of whom used those 105 pound
wooden surfboards and ventured out
into the shark-infested, freezing cold
waters sans wet suit.

Imagine a tower that looks like a 1935 fruit cock
tail can but is actually a water tank. Or a lighthouse

that is also a storehouse of American surfing mem
orabilia. Or even a store that sells garlic lollipops

(yes, garlic lollipops). These bizarre little places
are hidden in areas right nearby Stanford, but

most people have probably missed seeing

them. Until now.
These Bay Area oddities are strange yet
historical, and they are sure to get a giggle
— or at least a curious stare — from a visit
ing friend who has asked you to show him or

her the less touristy, truly "unique" California
sights.
The Libby Can Water Tower

The fruity colors and motifs of the Libby Can Water
Tower provide a cheery contrast to the maze of somber grey
buildings in the Sunnyvale Business Park. The Can has
been a silent, but not so unchanged, witness to a farm town
that transformed itself to a high-tech center for the world.
The 100-foot tower, which was re-built in the shape of a
can in 1965, served as the water source for the Libby,
McNeil & Libby Cannery Co. The cannery dates back to the
early part of this century when businesses began tapping
California's blossoming fruit market. The Libbys started
shop in Sunnyvale in 1906 and continued for 75 years until
the silicon chips took over the landscape. At its peak in
1922, the cannery employed over 800 people during its busy
seasons.

The tower is connected with the his
torical roots of the city. In 1973, when
Libby changed its logo and tried to re
paint the tower, the Sunnyvale City
Planning Commission vetoed the paint
job in the name of tradition. But finally
in 1976, at a cost of $7,000, the tower
was painted to resemble a fruit cocktail
can.
The 150,000 gallon water tank was
honored with Sunnyvale Historical
Landmark status in 1984. To mark the
event the Can received another coat of
paint — a 25-gallon coat — so that the
slogan 'Fancy Fruit Salad' and the
glossy visuals of fruity fruits might keep
their luster.
Garlic World
The unending monotony of Highway
101 is disturbed by whiffs of garlic that
with the moving vehicle rapidly intensi
fies to block off anv other sense of smell.

If you are a garlic freak, off Monterey High-

way you will be enticed into a store that

the Vermoouth," garlic chewing gum
and garlic-flavored lollipops, to little

calls itself the Garlic World. It is

Gilroy, the "Garlic Capital of
the World," home of the spec-

tacular annual Gilroy Garlic
Festival.
The range of garlicky items in

Garlic World is a sheer tribute to

human ingenuity. From Tipsy Garlic
that says on its label "got too close to

key-chains proclaiming Gilroy to be "Gar
lic capital of the world," this place has it

all. The shop is also the proud owner of the
world-famous 215 foot long garlic braid.

Gilroy will prove to you that Garlic can be a
part of any meal. I wonder if they've tried gar-

lic pancakes?

The Santa Cruz Surfing Museum
The Mark Abbot Memorial Lighthouse is in perfect harmo
ny with the clear blue-green seas of Santa Cruz. In the sur
rounding waters, wailing seals perched on a rocks oversee all
human antics, while the startled ducks paddle briskly away
from any novice surfer.
The lighthouse contains the Santa Cruz Surfing Museum,
which is a collection of trivia and artifacts from American
surfing history. Old wooden surfboards — they weighed 105
pounds — and assorted equipment provide quite a contrast to

fiberglass, day-glow modern surfing
regalia.
The museum was opened in 1984,
after young surfer Mark Abbott died in
an accident just off the coast and his
parents decided to donate his life
insurance money to the creation of a
museum. There is an official plaque
dedicated to him at the lighthouse,
which reads: Mark Abbott, 18, "chal
lenged the sea and lost." This state
ment testifies to the spirit of adventure
that goaded the early surfers into the
rough seas, along with the danger that
awaited them there.
If you're lucky, you might get to talk
to one of the founding members of the
Santa Cruz Surfing Club. The club was
founded in the 19305, when there were
