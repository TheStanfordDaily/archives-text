# Step into 'Lives of the Rich and Famous at the Filoli mansion
## 
### Julia Sobrevilla 
It happens to everyone. After
living in a dorm for more than a
quarter, you start wondering if
there is any possible escape. Do
rooms where you can strech out
both arms and not hit a wall
still exist?
Well, take heart — they do.
Visiting the Filoii Mansion
will remind you that some people
actually get to live in rooms the
size of your dorm dining-room.
When you arrive, the first
thing you will notice is the
never-ending driveway. A cou
ple of miles long, it seems to
almost rival the freeway section
of the trip. But this scenic route
is a pleasure, with trees are all
around.
If the natural scenery isn't
enough, the entrance to the
mansion alone will make the
excursion more than worth
while.
Red bricks, french windows,
white pillars and a huge carved
door. All the elements of a

showcase mansion. No wonder
the producers of 'Dynasty', the
famous television series, chose
Filoli as the house of the illus
trious Carrington family. The
mansion appeared in the open
ing shots of each program.
The mansion is probably so
impressive and movie-like
because of the man who origi
nally built it in 1917.
William Bourn 11, a silver
magnate from San Francisco
who also owned the Spring Val
ley Water Company, bought the
654-acre site because he and his
wife thought it was similar to
the Lakes of Killarney in Ire
land, where their daughter
lived. While he lived in the
house, Mr. Bourn had the trees
trimmed in such a way that he
could easily gaze upon the lake
near the property.
The doors of the mansion are
made of dark cedar, and are
carved with the Bourn family's
coat of arms. The door is so stur
dy that even if a mob of raging
vikings with a battering ram

wouldn't be able to break it down.
Of course a place like this
immediately raises the ques
tion: what about parties ?
The elements of the mansion
show that parties were impor
tant to the Bourns' — the
demands of large-scale enter
taining were obviously a deter
mining factor in their plans.
An example of this is the cir
cular entrance hall, which has a
door to each side; to one side
there is a men's bathroom and
to the other a women's.
Then there's the music room.
The walls are painted light
green with real gold mouldings.
A perfectly polished parquet
floor invites you to dance. And
the baccarat chandeliers are
exact replicas of the ones that
hang in the hall of mirrors in
the palace of Versailles, where
the peace treaty following World
War I was signed.
Music, oddly enough, is the
only thing missing in the ball-

room. You will expect it to
come pouring out of nowhere
any minute.
A huge mansion, and a
party room that could have
well been the inspiration for
the one in Beauty and the
Beast — you might think
that would be all you can
take. But wait, there's more.
There are 43 rooms to
explore, 12 of which were
servants' quarters.
Twelve rooms for servants
and a butler's pantry? What
a life, huh?
The butler's pantry has an
innovative predecessor of the
microwave oven — an inge-

nious small glass oven for heating food and drinks on short
notice (imagine doing this in 1943 for 15 people). There's also a
central household switchboard where all the rooms are labeled
and a small red light flashes when a resident makes a call.
What's more, in the butler's pantry there is a vault the
size of a dorm room, where the family that bought Filoli
from the Bourn family kept their silverware. Trusted ser
vant, that butler.
I would usually say that a vault for keeping silverware
might be just a little bit much.
However, considering that a three-day auction was needed
to sell only two-thirds of the silver, the vault probably was a
'necessity.' You can go into the vault and still see some pieces

of silver that were not sold
or given out as inheritance.
There are a myriad of
other things to see.
Sixteen acres of gardens
are a central part of the
estate. The gardens were
planned and laid out with
as much care as the man
sion. They are divided into
various "rooms" — the
bowling green, the walled
in garden and the working
garden are some examples.
Every year in April,
15,000 tulips are flown in
from Holland and planted
in the garden, making for a
spectacular view. In June,
roses bloom.
Volunteer docents that

have taken courses in the history of the house, its past resi
dents and the gardens give tours almost every day. They are
friendly and knowledgeable-especially in family gossip.
All in all, while you may end up wondering what it was
that you did wrong to end up where you are and not living in
a house like Filoli, the tour is most certainly worth it.
For those interested in nature, Filoli also offers nature
hikes through lesser-developed areas of the property, such as
the Ohlone Indian digs and the San Andreas fault.
The house and gardens are closed from early November to
mid-February, and the house tours are only for people over
eight years. The nature hikes are open to all ages. For more
information and reservations call (415) 364-2880.
