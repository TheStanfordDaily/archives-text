# Step into 'Lives of the Rich and Famous at the Filoli mansion
## 
### Julia Sobrevilla 
It happens to everyone. After
living in a dorm for more than a
quarter, you start wondering if
there is any possible escape. Do
rooms where you can strech out
both arms and not hit a wall
still exist?
Well, take heart — they do.
Visiting the Filoii Mansion
will remind you that some people
actually get to live in rooms the
size of your dorm dining-room.
When you arrive, the first
thing you will notice is the
never-ending driveway. A cou
ple of miles long, it seems to
almost rival the freeway section
of the trip. But this scenic route
is a pleasure, with trees are all
around.
If the natural scenery isn't
enough, the entrance to the
mansion alone will make the
excursion more than worth
while.
Red bricks, french windows,
white pillars and a huge carved
door. All the elements of a

showcase mansion. No wonder
the producers of 'Dynasty', the
famous television series, chose
Filoli as the house of the illus
trious Carrington family. The
mansion appeared in the open
ing shots of each program.
The mansion is probably so
impressive and movie-like
because of the man who origi
nally built it in 1917.
William Bourn 11, a silver
magnate from San Francisco
who also owned the Spring Val
ley Water Company, bought the
654-acre site because he and his
wife thought it was similar to
the Lakes of Killarney in Ire
land, where their daughter
lived. While he lived in the
house, Mr. Bourn had the trees
trimmed in such a way that he
could easily gaze upon the lake
near the property.
The doors of the mansion are
made of dark cedar, and are
carved with the Bourn family's
coat of arms. The door is so stur
dy that even if a mob of raging
vikings with a battering ram

wouldn't be able to break it down.
Of course a place like this
immediately raises the ques
tion: what about parties ?
The elements of the mansion
show that parties were impor
tant to the Bourns' — the
demands of large-scale enter
taining were obviously a deter
mining factor in their plans.
An example of this is the cir
cular entrance hall, which has a
door to each side; to one side
there is a men's bathroom and
to the other a women's.
Then there's the music room.
The walls are painted light
green with real gold mouldings.
A perfectly polished parquet
floor invites you to dance. And
the baccarat chandeliers are
exact replicas of the ones that
hang in the hall of mirrors in
the palace of Versailles, where
the peace treaty following World
War I was signed.
Music, oddly enough, is the
only thing missing in the ball-
