# IT ALL STARTED IN EGYPT
## Fill in some of the gaps CIV left: See artifacts from Egypt's advanced pre-Greek civilization 
### Jennifer Roberts 
If your CIV track started with Homer, your knowledge of
ancient Egyptian civilization is probably little more than a
sketchy amalgam of random images gleaned from all the
King Tut documentaries you saw as a kid. If so, don't miss
the opportunity to visit the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum
in San Jose. The extensive collection, featuring everything
from ancient toys to mummified fish, will bring you face to
face with this highly developed culture that flourished more
than 2,000 years before classical Greece.
The museum houses the largest collection of Egyptian
artifacts on exhibit in the western United States. The col
lection spans a period from the first paleolithic glimmers of
human civilization in Northern Africa through Egypt's
early Christian era.
Certainly the most mesmerizing artifacts, if only for
their rather macabre appeal, are those in the mummifica
tion gallery. Here, watching the spooked but fascinated
children as they stare in disbelief at the mummies is half
the fun.
Along with intricately painted coffins and mummy cases
is a beautifully carved collection of canopic jars, vessels that
were used to hold the preserved organs of the deceased.

Most fascinating are the carefully
preserved cats, fish, gazelles, baboons,
hawks, baby crocodiles and of course,
humans.
Usermontu, a priest who died in
approximately 630 BC, lies quietly in
a glass case, complete with hair,
tongue, teeth, fingernails and facial
expression. It's hard to think of
ancient history as a distant abstrac
tion when you come face-to-face with
a man who was there. This section
also includes hourly tours through a
walk-in reproduction of a rock tomb,
providing explanations of burial prac
tices and tomb art.
Other sections of the museum dis
play ceramics, glass, jewelry, musical
instruments, amulets, Coptic textiles
and sculpture.
Stanford students will of course
wish to focus their concentration on
the images of Thoth, the god of intel
ligence and writing. While perusing

While perusing the
exquisitely cctrued stone,
bronze and uuood tomb
figures, it is wise to remem
ber that the Egyptians
taught the art of sculpture
to the Greeks. . . .
