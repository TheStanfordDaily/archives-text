# IT ALL STARTED IN EGYPT
## Fill in some of the gaps CIV left: See artifacts from Egypt's advanced pre-Greek civilization 
### Jennifer Roberts 
If your CIV track started with Homer, your knowledge of
ancient Egyptian civilization is probably little more than a
sketchy amalgam of random images gleaned from all the
King Tut documentaries you saw as a kid. If so, don't miss
the opportunity to visit the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum
in San Jose. The extensive collection, featuring everything
from ancient toys to mummified fish, will bring you face to
face with this highly developed culture that flourished more
than 2,000 years before classical Greece.
The museum houses the largest collection of Egyptian
artifacts on exhibit in the western United States. The col
lection spans a period from the first paleolithic glimmers of
human civilization in Northern Africa through Egypt's
early Christian era.
Certainly the most mesmerizing artifacts, if only for
their rather macabre appeal, are those in the mummifica
tion gallery. Here, watching the spooked but fascinated
children as they stare in disbelief at the mummies is half
the fun.
Along with intricately painted coffins and mummy cases
is a beautifully carved collection of canopic jars, vessels that
were used to hold the preserved organs of the deceased.

Most fascinating are the carefully
preserved cats, fish, gazelles, baboons,
hawks, baby crocodiles and of course,
humans.
Usermontu, a priest who died in
approximately 630 BC, lies quietly in
a glass case, complete with hair,
tongue, teeth, fingernails and facial
expression. It's hard to think of
ancient history as a distant abstrac
tion when you come face-to-face with
a man who was there. This section
also includes hourly tours through a
walk-in reproduction of a rock tomb,
providing explanations of burial prac
tices and tomb art.
Other sections of the museum dis
play ceramics, glass, jewelry, musical
instruments, amulets, Coptic textiles
and sculpture.
Stanford students will of course
wish to focus their concentration on
the images of Thoth, the god of intel
ligence and writing. While perusing

that the Egyptians taught
the art of sculpture to the
Greeks, and that many of
the greatest monuments of
western civilization ulti

works.
Some of the most intrigu
ing objects on display are
those designed not for the
afterworld but for everyday
life â€” combs, tweezers,
razors, fish hooks, mirrors,
sandals, cosmetic pots and
childrens' toys. The muse
um has also compiled a sub
stantial collection of Assyri
an, Babylonian and Sumeri
an objects, including
cuneiform tablets dating
from 2,800 BC.

Along with the original artifacts, the museum houses
replicas of several of the best-known Egyptian and Mediter
ranean monuments, including the code of Hammurabi and
the Rosetta Stone.
The building, architecturally inspired by the Temple of
Amon at Karnak and guarded by a giant sculpture of Taurt,
the hippopotamus deity, is almost an artifact in itself. Be

plants) alongside the muse
um. Upstairs, a little out of
place, the Contemporary Art
Gallery features monthly
shows that highlight the
work of contemporary artists
in all media.
The museum caters pri
marily to a lay audience, so
don't expect a consistently
scholarly presentation of the
objects and their history.
Because the pieces tend to be
organized into broad themat
ic categories, the historical
evolution of styles and
typologies is underempha
sized.
The museum also suffers
from a conspicuous lack of
informative brochures to
help explain the objects in
depth. Luckily, the plackards
explain the basics, and the

exquisite artifacts tell their own stories.
Open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. seven days a week, the muse
um is located about 25 minutes by car from Stanford, at
Park and Naglee avenues in San Jose.
Admission is $4 for adults and $3.50 for students, so
don't forget your Student ID (you can put that extra 50
cents to good use at the gift shop). For more information,
call (408) 287-2807.
