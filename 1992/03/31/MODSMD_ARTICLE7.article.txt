# Better late than never
## Chicano input on presidential search not heard until after decision 
### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
Bad timing has left one group
of faculty disappointed about the
presidential search process — but
they still think Gerhard Casper is
a good man for the job.
Stanford's 13 Chicano faculty
members sent a letter in late
February requesting a meeting
with the search committee, think
ing they had plenty of time to
share their views on diversity
issues before a new president was
brought on board.
The meeting was set for March
18 — the day after Casper, who is
currently provost at the Universi
ty of Chicago, was introduced as
Stanford's ninth president.
"The Chronicle had it as a ban
ner headline," said Yvonne Mal
donado, an assistant professor of
pediatrics, one of the faculty sched
uled to meet with the committee.
Despite the announcement, the

meeting went on as planned. Fac
ulty members said they discussed
criteria search committee mem
bers had used to select Casper.
History Prof. A 1 Camarillo said
the one-hour session satisfied him
that issues of minority recruit
ment, hiring and retention as well
as diversity in undergraduate pro
grams had been addressed.
"I was convinced that from the
get-go, they had these issues very
high on their priorities and that
they engaged candidates pretty
explicitly," Camarillo said.
Assoc. Political Science Prof.
Luis Fraga said some of Casper's
past actions as Chicago provost
and Law School dean reassured
him, but he refused to specify.
The search committee "had evi
dence and presented the evidence
very convincingly," he said.
Camarillo said Casper's track
record on diversity issues is "hard
to judge." The University of
Chicago's reputation with minori

ty recruiting and hiring isn't
good, he said.
But Cass Sunstein, a law profes
sor at Chicago, said Casper was com
mitted to both merit and racial and
gender diversity, which Sunstein
said weren't mutually exclusive.
"His commitment to diversity
is part of his commitment to
excellence and his commitment to
excellence is part of his commit
ment to diversity," Sunstein said.
Some of Casper's appointments to
the law faculty include feminist
law experts Mary Becker and
Catherine MacKinnon, who was a
visiting professor.
Fraga said the letter was also
intended to make up for the
absence of Chicano faculty on the
15-member selection committee.
Some faculty were informally con
sulted by search committee mem
bers, he said.
Camarillo conceded that the
letter, which he wrote, was sub
mitted late in the process because

he was on leave fall quarter.
But, he added, the search com
mittee accelerated its decision. One
Chicano faculty member who spoke
on condition of anonymity said the
committee's quick selection was
intended "to keep the press off the
backs of the committee" and main
tain secrecy in the search process.
"Our request got lost in that,"
the faculty member said. "That's
not particularly pleasing to hear."
But Asst. Dean of Students
Jim Larimore, one of four search
committee members who focused
on multicultural issues, said the
process was not deliberately accel
erated. The Board of Trustees and
Casper's decisions came more
quickly than search committee
members anticipated, he said.
"We thought we might have to
coax Casper," he said.
If the letter had arrived in late
December or early January, Lari
more said, the groups could have
met before Casper was chosen.
