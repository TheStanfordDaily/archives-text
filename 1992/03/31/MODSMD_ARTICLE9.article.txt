Business School to build research center
The Graduate School of Business plans to build a high-tech
research facility in its Jackson Library, using a donation from a
couple who graduated from Stanford.
The Rosenberg Corporate Research Center — named after its
donors, Claude and Louise Rosenberg — will occupy most of the first
floor of the three-story library and will consist of computer systems
capable of accessing financial information from around the world.
"This is an area in which we were really behind the times," said
Charles Sizemore, the school's associate dean for external rela
tions. The new research center, he said, "will enable us to be
much more forward-looking, much more 21st century."
Sizemore estimated that the facility will cost about $500,000 to
build. Remodeling to accommodate the center will begin this sum
mer and it is scheduled to open in fall quarter.
Sizemore said the center will enable students and faculty to
access "up-to-the moment information" about anything from cur
rency exchange rates to prices on the Japanese stock market.
Both Rosenbergs attended Stanford as undergraduates and
Claude Rosenberg is also a Business School alumnus.
He is now a senior partner of RCM Capital Management, a San
Francisco investment firm. According to Sizemore, the firm was
one of the first to establish a high-tech research department sim
ilar to the one that will be built at Stanford.
