Jethro always got some,
but he's got to leave.
Can you replace him?
The Stanford Daily needs someone like Jethro, someone with: an
ability to schmooze, great organizational and inter-personal skills, and
15 hours a week to spend working as an Account Executive.
Do you enjoy beef stroganoff, Budweiser, and Big Bob? Do you like to
earn money in a fun office with people who are always getting some ...
advertising?
If this sounds appealing to you, we'd like to meet you. We have three
positions available for the spring quarter with the potential to continue
next year.
Call Linda at 723-2554 or come by The Stanford Daily Advertising
Department to pick up an application and meet Jethro himself.
Interviews will be conducted April 2 through April 4.
Chris likes to play with triangles
and draw boxes.
She puts John Edward, cain 111 in his place every day. She is responsible for laying
out the advertising and news space in The Daily. She too is leaving.
Coincidence? I don't think so. We need a new Production Manager to join our
staff. The job requires two hours per day, 3-5:30-ish Sunday through Thursday.
Call Linda at 723-2554 or come by The Daily to find out more!
