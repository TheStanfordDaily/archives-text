# Casper acts quickly, names Bloom provost
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Allan Bloom, a professor at the Univer
sity of Chicago, has been selected as Stan
ford's next provost by incoming president
Gerhard Casper.
Bloom, whose selection was approved by
the Board of Trustees at a special telecon
ference meeting last night, will take office
September 1.
A national figure for his criticism of
multiculturalism and his enthusiasm for
Western culture, Bloom is the author of
"The Closing of the American Mind."
Casper said yesterday,"I think Allan
will be the perfect complement to the Zeit
geist of this university. I am thrilled that
he has agreed to take the job."
The quick decision on a successor to
Provost James Rosse and interim Provost
Gerald Lieberman comes as a surprise.

man to serve several months into the
tenure of the next president and help to
guide the transition to a new administra
tion.
But Casper said last night, "I don't
think a transition is necessary. Allan is
ready to assume a leadership position and
wants to start as early as possible."
Rosse, Lieberman and University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy refused to comment
on Bloom's selection last night.
Others were less reticent. "Frankly,
I'm shocked," said Robert Rosenzweig,
the president of the Association of Ameri
can Universities. "Allan Bloom is a bril
liant scholar, but it doesn't strike me that
there's a lot of resonance with Stanford."

The special board meeting was called to
approve Bloom's selection because he must
respond by Friday to an offer of a senior
administrative position at the National
Association of Scholars.
Board of Trustees President James
Gaither would not say whether the board
had been divided over Bloom's approval.
However, the board typically announces
that it has voted unanimously in the selec
tion of high-ranking University officials. It
did not do so last night.
A board member who spoke on condition
of anonymity said that a number of board
members protested Bloom's approval but
were narrowly outvoted after Casper made
a "fervent" argument for his suitability.

In a special statement prepared last
night, Bloom expressed his commitment to
Casper's goal of affirming the importance
of teaching at Stanford. He will provide an
example, he said, by teaching Cultures,
Ideas and Values courses.
"I think I could bring a lot to the CIV
program," Bloom said. "I plan to teach in it
each quarter."
At Chicago, Bloom is a professor in the
university's interdisciplinary Committee
on Social Thought and the College. Two of
his controversial books on higher education
have been national bestsellers.
Casper had originally expressed an
intention to select a provost from Stan
ford's faculty. But Bloom emerged as "the
clear choice," he said, because "in addition
to his unique Weltanschauung, he has
studied Stanford" in writing some of his
books.
