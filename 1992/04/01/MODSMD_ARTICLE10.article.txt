# They made it in Hollywood
## Students find both fame and disappointment in TV, movies 
### Kim McCreery Staff writer 
Most Hollywood stargazers
think the life of a movie star is
all glamour and glitz. But for
those few who have actually
touched the silver screen,
those illusions can quickly
fade.
A life of uncertainty, where
talent and ability don't always
win, may not be too enticing to
a brand of worker who expects
a secure payoff from a presti
gious degree.
But for at least three Stan
ford students, the excitement
of entertaining is worth the
bumpy road that leads to Hol
lywood and the behind-the
scenes toil that it takes to
make it big.
As one Stanford student
found, careers are squelched
as quickly as they are sparked.
Egos are swelled and crushed
with equal speed and impact.
There are no guarantees in
Hollywood, but the payoffs
can make it worth the risks.
'It's a screwy business'
For sophomore Troy Bish

Stanford students Megyn Price, John Louie and Troy Bishop have
all worked in Hollywood — and found that it's not ail glamor and
glory.
was just a fluke. As a ten-year-old
in Lincoln, Nebraska, Bishop
went to an open call for a feature
film. After several call-backs, he
got the part of Tommy, Debra
Winger's oldest child in the film
"Terms of Endearment," which
won eight Academy Awards,
including Best Picture.
"The best time of my life was
on that set," Bishop said. "Even
though I didn't really know who
people were, I had a blast with
Debra — she was crazy. And Jack
[Nicholson! was a really good
friend, very laid-back. I spoke
with them for years afterward."
For BLshop, the flood of atten
tion was hard to deal with at times.
He received local and national
media attention, and became
known as "the kid in the movie."
"I would never mention it, but
someone would always introduce
me that way," he said. "Now it's
no big deal. Sometimes people will
say, 'y ea h, he was in a movie
once,' but it's just another fact
about another Stanford student."
After the film, he used the
money he earned to fly to L.A. to
get an agent. "After all the atten
tion I got for being in a film of
that magnitude, my ego was

huge," he said. "I thought I could
just walk into any audition and
get a part."
That never happened. Bishop
was unsuccessful at gaining roles
in L.A., and as his "ego shrunk
back to size," his interest waned.
According to Bishop, there are
three ways to be successful in the
entertainment business. "Some
times talent and determination will
do it. Sometimes it's just pure luck.
Usually it's who you know."
"It's a screwy business," Bishop
said. "You have to be willing to per
severe through a lot to make it."
Ultimately, his goal is to direct
and act in feature films. Although
he's taken a few drama classes at
Stanford, he doesn't intend to
pursue them further.
"I'm very focused, and I don't
see studying at this department as
a necessary step to get where I
want to be in the film industry," he
said. "And all of my important con
tacts have been outside Stanford."
4 lt isn't all glamorous'
Senior John Ijouie grew up sur
rounded by the entertainment
industry. His family wanted to intro
duce him to as many opportunities
as they could, Louie said. Profession
al acting was just one of them.
At the age of five, Louie started
doing commercials. From there,
he earned regular roles in produc
tions like "Eight is Enough,"

"Benson" and "Gremlins."
For the next seven years he
juggled six months of school and a
six-month working schedule,
which included a co-starring role
in the movie "Oh, God Book II."
Louie admits that there were
good and bad sides to growing up
on camera. "The best thing was the
chance to interact with older people
at such a young age," he said.
"Having worked in the busi
ness so long, I've learned that it
isn't all glamorous," he said.
"There's a lot of drudgery that
you don't see."
According to Louie, the pres
sure of interviewing, memorizing
last-second scenes and working
long schedules can add up.
"It gives you a disjointed child
hood," he said. "It forces you to
mature quickly in certain situa
tions, while asking you to be a kid
in others."
Louie considers his experience
a rewarding extracurricular activ
ity. Working beside some of Holly
wood's legends was part of that
great experience.
"Spielberg was a trip to work
with. He is such a child at heart,"
Louie said. "I also owe something
to George Burns. He was instru
mental in teaching me how to keep
a childhood flair and try to be a
professional at the same time."
Since 1987, Louie has done no
professional acting. He has not

pursued drama at Stanford. A
political science and quantitative
economics double major, he says
that he is just too busy with other
things now.
He also said that he never
looked into drama at Stanford,
because he had never been
involved in theater in high school.
"My high school drama depart
ment was very competitive," he
said. "I tried out, but I didn't
make it into the honors program."
Louie says that his days as a pro
fessional actor are probably over, but
he remains "voraciously interested
in the entertainment industry."
"I've seen thousands of movies,
watch TV to no end, get every
trade magazine, you name it,"he
said. "I'm kind of obsessed, and I
don't see that ending."
Happiness over wealth
Senior Megyn Price says she
has loved drama ever since she
was born. But when she came to
Stanford, she almost gave it up
because she "felt the need to do
the safe thing." So she became an
economics major.
At the end of her sophomore
year, she realized she was not
happy. "It was really scary to
decide on a career that was so
uncertain," she said. "But by then
I knew that I wanted to be happy
more than I wanted to be rich."
While working at Warner

Brothers Studios in Los Angeles
last summer, she got a reading for
a part in the television feature
"Tequila and Bonetti," which
became her first speaking appear
ance on television.
She says that although audition
ing and performing are very time
consuming, it's all worthwhile.
"I guess I gave up whatever free
time I had, but it didn't take any
thing away from my life," she said.
Now a communication major,
Price is frustrated with what Stan
ford's drama department has to
offer. "There is just not enough per
formance opportunity," she said.
She has taken a few specialized
acting courses to prepare for audi
tions for graduate school. Her
goal is to spend the next four
years studying drama at Juilliard
School in New York City.
"I want to do this for my life,"
she said. "Because I want to make
a living, I'll eventually have to do
some film. But working on the
stage is the best training ground."
Price agrees with Bishop, saying
that contacts are the most impor
tant asset for making it in the
entertainment business. "You can't
just have one contact either, it all
just builds on itself," she added.
"Personality is next," she said.
"People want to hire you because
you're easy to get along with, and
you're congenial. You've really
got to show them who you are."

'It's a screwy business'
For sophomore Troy Bish

Joshua Folk — Daily
Stanford students Megyn Price, John Louie and Troy Bishop have
all worked in Hollywood — and found that it's not ail glamor and
glory.
was just a fluke. As a ten-year-old
in Lincoln, Nebraska, Bishop
went to an open call for a feature
film. After several call-backs, he
got the part of Tommy, Debra
Winger's oldest child in the film
"Terms of Endearment," which
won eight Academy Awards,
including Best Picture.
"The best time of my life was
on that set," Bishop said. "Even
though I didn't really know who
people were, I had a blast with
Debra — she was crazy. And Jack
[Nicholson! was a really good
friend, very laid-back. I spoke
with them for years afterward."
For BLshop, the flood of atten
tion was hard to deal with at times.
He received local and national
media attention, and became
known as "the kid in the movie."
"I would never mention it, but
someone would always introduce
me that way," he said. "Now it's
no big deal. Sometimes people will
say, 'y ea h, he was in a movie
once,' but it's just another fact
about another Stanford student."
After the film, he used the
money he earned to fly to L.A. to
get an agent. "After all the atten
tion I got for being in a film of
that magnitude, my ego was

huge," he said. "I thought I could
just walk into any audition and
get a part."
That never happened. Bishop
was unsuccessful at gaining roles
in L.A., and as his "ego shrunk
back to size," his interest waned.
According to Bishop, there are
three ways to be successful in the
entertainment business. "Some
times talent and determination will
do it. Sometimes it's just pure luck.
Usually it's who you know."
"It's a screwy business," Bishop
said. "You have to be willing to per
severe through a lot to make it."
Ultimately, his goal is to direct
and act in feature films. Although
he's taken a few drama classes at
Stanford, he doesn't intend to
pursue them further.
"I'm very focused, and I don't
see studying at this department as
a necessary step to get where I
want to be in the film industry," he
said. "And all of my important con
tacts have been outside Stanford."
4 lt isn't all glamorous'
Senior John Ijouie grew up sur
rounded by the entertainment
industry. His family wanted to intro
duce him to as many opportunities
as they could, Louie said. Profession
al acting was just one of them.
At the age of five, Louie started
doing commercials. From there,
he earned regular roles in produc
tions like "Eight is Enough,"

"Benson" and "Gremlins."
For the next seven years he
juggled six months of school and a
six-month working schedule,
which included a co-starring role
in the movie "Oh, God Book II."
Louie admits that there were
good and bad sides to growing up
on camera. "The best thing was the
chance to interact with older people
at such a young age," he said.
"Having worked in the busi
ness so long, I've learned that it
isn't all glamorous," he said.
"There's a lot of drudgery that
you don't see."
According to Louie, the pres
sure of interviewing, memorizing
last-second scenes and working
long schedules can add up.
"It gives you a disjointed child
hood," he said. "It forces you to
mature quickly in certain situa
tions, while asking you to be a kid
in others."
Louie considers his experience
a rewarding extracurricular activ
ity. Working beside some of Holly
wood's legends was part of that
great experience.
"Spielberg was a trip to work
with. He is such a child at heart,"
Louie said. "I also owe something
to George Burns. He was instru
mental in teaching me how to keep
a childhood flair and try to be a
professional at the same time."
Since 1987, Louie has done no
professional acting. He has not

pursued drama at Stanford. A
political science and quantitative
economics double major, he says
that he is just too busy with other
things now.
He also said that he never
looked into drama at Stanford,
because he had never been
involved in theater in high school.
"My high school drama depart
ment was very competitive," he
said. "I tried out, but I didn't
make it into the honors program."
Louie says that his days as a pro
fessional actor are probably over, but
he remains "voraciously interested
in the entertainment industry."
"I've seen thousands of movies,
watch TV to no end, get every
trade magazine, you name it,"he
said. "I'm kind of obsessed, and I
don't see that ending."
Happiness over wealth
Senior Megyn Price says she
has loved drama ever since she
was born. But when she came to
Stanford, she almost gave it up
because she "felt the need to do
the safe thing." So she became an
economics major.
At the end of her sophomore
year, she realized she was not
happy. "It was really scary to
decide on a career that was so
uncertain," she said. "But by then
I knew that I wanted to be happy
more than I wanted to be rich."
While working at Warner

Brothers Studios in Los Angeles
last summer, she got a reading for
a part in the television feature
"Tequila and Bonetti," which
became her first speaking appear
ance on television.
She says that although audition
ing and performing are very time
consuming, it's all worthwhile.
"I guess I gave up whatever free
time I had, but it didn't take any
thing away from my life," she said.
Now a communication major,
Price is frustrated with what Stan
ford's drama department has to
offer. "There is just not enough per
formance opportunity," she said.
She has taken a few specialized
acting courses to prepare for audi
tions for graduate school. Her
goal is to spend the next four
years studying drama at Juilliard
School in New York City.
"I want to do this for my life,"
she said. "Because I want to make
a living, I'll eventually have to do
some film. But working on the
stage is the best training ground."
Price agrees with Bishop, saying
that contacts are the most impor
tant asset for making it in the
entertainment business. "You can't
just have one contact either, it all
just builds on itself," she added.
"Personality is next," she said.
"People want to hire you because
you're easy to get along with, and
you're congenial. You've really
got to show them who you are."
