# They made it in Hollywood
## Students find both fame and disappointment in TV, movies 
### Kim McCreery Staff writer 
Most Hollywood stargazers
think the life of a movie star is
all glamour and glitz. But for
those few who have actually
touched the silver screen,
those illusions can quickly
fade.
A life of uncertainty, where
talent and ability don't always
win, may not be too enticing to
a brand of worker who expects
a secure payoff from a presti
gious degree.
But for at least three Stan
ford students, the excitement
of entertaining is worth the
bumpy road that leads to Hol
lywood and the behind-the
scenes toil that it takes to
make it big.
As one Stanford student
found, careers are squelched
as quickly as they are sparked.
Egos are swelled and crushed
with equal speed and impact.
There are no guarantees in
Hollywood, but the payoffs
can make it worth the risks.

Stanford students Megyn Price, John Louie and Troy Bishop have
all worked in Hollywood — and found that it's not ail glamor and
glory.
