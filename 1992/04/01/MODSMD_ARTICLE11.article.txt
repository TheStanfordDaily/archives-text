# Lead discovered in Escondido
## But blood tests on children there reveal no problems 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
According to recent University
tests, paint in some Escondido Vil
lage residences contains levels of
lead manufacturers are no longer
allowed to use because of health
concerns.
But blood tests done on six chil
dren of graduate students in
Escondido showed no elevated lev
els of lead in their blood, according
to Harvey Weinstein, director of
the Cowell Student Health Center.

Stanford's Department of
Environmental Health and Safe
ty, which conducted the lead
tests, is notifying residents that
they should keep children away
from peeling paint, have them
wash their hands before eating
and wet-mop surfaces to remove
paint dust containing lead.
The tests, taken in various
Escondido residences, found that
samples taken from interior walls
contained about 1.0 milligrams
per square centimeter of painted
surface, according to Janet Glea

son, health and safety coordinator
for Housing and Food Services.
The U.S. Department of Hous
ing and Urban Development
defines paints containing that
level as "lead-containing."
Samples from inside one of the
five residences in the study
showed levels greater than 1.0,
Gleason said. Trim surface and
exterior surface samples showed
levels of concentration as high as
1.5 and 2.0, respectively.
Use of such paints has been
prohibited for several years. But
residences like Escondido —
which was constructed between
1959 and 1966 — often have lay
ers of lead-containing paint
underneath more recent coats.
Although such exposure is not
considered dangerous to adults,
children can suffer decreased
intelligence and impaired neuro
logical development by exposure
to paint dust and from eating
paint chips.
University officials today
began further testing of paint,
soil, sand and water in Escondido.
"There's another methodology
(of testing paint samples) that
does a lot better job at these lev
els," Gleason said. When the Uni
versity has more precise results
— in a week or two, she estimat
ed — officials will decide what
measures to take.
Lead in sand and water could
be from the paint or could settle
from automobile and industrial
emissions, Gleason said.
The University is offering free
blood tests to young children liv
ing in or being cared for in Escon
dido Village. Concerned parents
should call 723-4841 to schedule
an appointment.
