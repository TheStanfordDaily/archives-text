# Money, timing secure top hits for ASSU Flicks
## 
### Carla Martin 
"Wayne's World" and "Fried Green Tomatoes"
are coming soon to a theater near you â€” Memorial
Auditorium.
The films, which are still playing in several local
cinemas, are on the spring quarter schedule for
ASSU Sunday Flicks. According to Flicks Manager
Jon Hoekstra, a combination of good timing and
financial success allowed him to obtain an unusual
ly recent crop of films.
Film studios determine the dates when films are
available to universities. Films are ordered from
the distributors a month prior to the beginning of
the quarter, and"the release dates matched our
schedule," Hoekstra said.
"A lot of schools are still showing films we
showed last quarter," he added. "We want to be on
the cutting edge."
According to Hoekstra, the movies selected this
quarter cost more to rent than in previous quar
ters. The new releases range from $600 to $800 to
rent, whereas older films range from $275 to $450.
The flat rate is paid before the film arrives, using
revenues from sales of Flicks passes.
Flicks can afford to gamble in selecting the latest
movies, Hoekstra said, because they have sold
enough tickets in past quarters to be assured that
they can meet the cost in ticket revenues.
This quarter, Flicks has been able to obtain 10
recent releases from film distributors, plus an old
favorite, "The Graduate." Hoekstra said he was
excited about this quarter's selection of movies,
