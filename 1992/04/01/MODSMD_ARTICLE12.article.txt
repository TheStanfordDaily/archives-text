# Money, timing secure top hits for ASSU Flicks

### Carla Martin 
"Wayne's World" and "Fried Green Tomatoes"
are coming soon to a theater near you — Memorial
Auditorium.
The films, which are still playing in several local
cinemas, are on the spring quarter schedule for
ASSU Sunday Flicks. According to Flicks Manager
Jon Hoekstra, a combination of good timing and
financial success allowed him to obtain an unusual
ly recent crop of films.
Film studios determine the dates when films are
available to universities. Films are ordered from
the distributors a month prior to the beginning of
the quarter, and"the release dates matched our
schedule," Hoekstra said.
"A lot of schools are still showing films we
showed last quarter," he added. "We want to be on
the cutting edge."
According to Hoekstra, the movies selected this
quarter cost more to rent than in previous quar
ters. The new releases range from $600 to $800 to
rent, whereas older films range from $275 to $450.
The flat rate is paid before the film arrives, using
revenues from sales of Flicks passes.
Flicks can afford to gamble in selecting the latest
movies, Hoekstra said, because they have sold
enough tickets in past quarters to be assured that
they can meet the cost in ticket revenues.
This quarter, Flicks has been able to obtain 10
recent releases from film distributors, plus an old
favorite, "The Graduate." Hoekstra said he was
excited about this quarter's selection of movies,
though he believes the caliber is
equal to last quarter's selection.
"We try to choose films that
people are really going to come to
see," he said.

1,700 seats. According to Hoek
stra, last quarter's ticket sales
averaged 300 to 600 for the 7 p.m.
show and 800 to 1,200 for the 10
p.m. show, which sold out three
times.
Hoekstra said he looks for
movies with mass appeal or
movies that would be fun to
watch in a group, such as horror
films. "A movie is a lot more scary
when there's 1,200 people in an
auditorium instead of two people
in a living room," he said.
For movie studios, renting
films to colleges is another good
way to make money before they
go on to video, Hoekstra said.
Flicks pays the film distribu
tors a flat fee for the film rental
and a percentage on the ticket
sales.
Profits provide salaries for
Hoekstra and his 12-member
staff, which provides crowd con
trol and sells tickets at the door.
Additional profits are used by the
ASSU to fund salaries for sena
tors and staff members and to off
set other losses, according to
ASSU Financial Manager
Michael Risch.
