# Ticket proposal draws fire
## Athletic Department protests bill to cap service charges 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
The athletic department's ticket office is protest
ing a bill in the California Senate that would put a
cap on service charges for tickets sold by distribution
agencies such as BASS-Ticketmaster.
The bill's sponsor, Sen. Milton Marks of San
Francisco, says the agencies add needlessly high
rates to the price of tickets, and he hopes to end that
practice.
But Konn Rauschenbach, director of ticket oper
ations at the Department of Athletics, said her office
opposes the bill because representatives from BASS
have said they would raise their rates if the service
charges are limited.
Athletic tickets are sold at the office and at vari
ous BASS outlets, including the Tresidder Ticket
Office. Tickets for Stanford events are also available

by telephone from BASS-Ticketmaster.
The bill — Senate Bill 1896 — would place a 15
percent cap on the service charges that could be
imposed. Rauschenbach's office sent a letter to
Marks identifying Stanford's objections to the pro
posal.
Rauschenbach said her main objection is that
Stanford's ticket office, if forced to pay additional
fees, would likely stop using BASS as an outlet —
and that might be less convenient for students.
As it stands now, she said, students have a choice
of buying tickets from the Tresidder Ticket Office or
by phone, options that some may consider more
desirable than buying directly from the athletic tick
et office, which is located more peripherally.
The athletic ticket office does not add a service
charge to the price of tickets.
If it had to stop using BASS as
an outlet, Rauschenbach said in
the letter to Marks, the office
"would be unable to handle the
additional costs" and would
"probably have to look at raising
the ticket prices or charging the
customers a service fee."
She also said in the letter that
in her seven years at the ticket
office, she has found BASS-Tick
master "to be very professional in
their dealings with our office and
with our customers."
Larry Morse, legislative direc
tor of Marks' office, said he con
sidered it "a little bit unusual" for
the University's ticket office to

oppose "a bill that was introduced
in large measure to help the stu
dents." He questioned whether
"the interests of the box office"
coincided with those of students.
Morse objected to BASS-Ticket
master'B threat to raise their rates
in the event of the bill's passage,
saying the company has made sim
ilar statements to other clients. He
described this as "a business prac
tice that was sketchy at best" and
as "borderline extortion."
Morse also said that if enough
clients reacted to the increased
charge by stopping their con
tracts, "the market would work"
and BASS-Ticketmaster would
have to reduce its charges.
Ticketmaster, which is by far
the largest ticket distributor in
the country, bought out Tick
etron, their major national com

petitor, last year.
Marks is concerned "with the
fact that BASS-Ticketmaster has
a monopoly on selling tickets in
California," Morse said.
"The lynchpin of the (free)
market economy is competition,"
and where there is no competition,
government has the responsibility
"to level the playing field for con
sumers," Morse said.
Marks has also called on the Cal
ifornia Attorney General to investi
gate BASS-Ticketmaster under the
state's anti-trust laws. The Justice
Department last year ruled that the
buyout of Ticketron did not violate
federal anti-trust laws.
But Morse said, "With all due
respect, the Reagan-Bush Justice
Department has not been note
worthy for its pursuit of anti
trust" cases.
