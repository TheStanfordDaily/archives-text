# Ticket proposal draws fire
## Athletic Department protests bill to cap service charges 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
The athletic department's ticket office is protest
ing a bill in the California Senate that would put a
cap on service charges for tickets sold by distribution
agencies such as BASS-Ticketmaster.
The bill's sponsor, Sen. Milton Marks of San
Francisco, says the agencies add needlessly high
rates to the price of tickets, and he hopes to end that
practice.
But Konn Rauschenbach, director of ticket oper
ations at the Department of Athletics, said her office
opposes the bill because representatives from BASS
have said they would raise their rates if the service
charges are limited.
Athletic tickets are sold at the office and at vari
ous BASS outlets, including the Tresidder Ticket
Office. Tickets for Stanford events are also available

by telephone from BASS-Ticketmaster.
The bill — Senate Bill 1896 — would place a 15
percent cap on the service charges that could be
imposed. Rauschenbach's office sent a letter to
Marks identifying Stanford's objections to the pro
posal.
Rauschenbach said her main objection is that
Stanford's ticket office, if forced to pay additional
fees, would likely stop using BASS as an outlet —
and that might be less convenient for students.
As it stands now, she said, students have a choice
of buying tickets from the Tresidder Ticket Office or
by phone, options that some may consider more
desirable than buying directly from the athletic tick
et office, which is located more peripherally.
The athletic ticket office does not add a service
charge to the price of tickets.
