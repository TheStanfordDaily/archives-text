No, Virginia, that big Stanford
envelope you got in the mail today

more on the math section, while
only 4 percent do so nationally.
The percentage of the admitted
class who are members of ethnic
and cultural minorities is compa

last year: 10.1 percent African
American, 24.0 percent Asian
American, 10.5 percent Mexican
American and 1.3 percent Native
American.

dents across the country," he
said. "Having worked at two
other highly selective institutions
(Occidental and Vassar), I was
pleased and amazed by the quality
