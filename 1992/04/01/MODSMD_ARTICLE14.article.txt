# Waiting ends for Class of '96
## 2,855 students to get letters of acceptance here 
### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
No, Virginia, that big Stanford
envelope you got in the mail today
isn't an April Fool's joke.
Yesterday, Stanford sent out
its letters of admission — and
rejection — to the more than
13,200 applicants for the class of
1996.
Of these applicants, less than
half of those with 4.0 GPAs and
less than half with 1400 SAT
scores were admitted, according
to a news release from the Office
of Undergraduate Admissions.
Not that the 2,855 admits are
in any way deficient academically.
More than 90 percent of them
were ranked in the top 10 percent
of their high school classes.
Twenty-nine percent had ver
bal SAT scores of 700 or more —
compared to one percent national
ly — and 62 percent scored 700 or
more on the math section, while
only 4 percent do so nationally.
The percentage of the admitted
class who are members of ethnic
and cultural minorities is compa
rable to that of students admitted
last year: 10.1 percent African
American, 24.0 percent Asian
American, 10.5 percent Mexican
American and 1.3 percent Native
American.

Though the Admissions Office
is pleased that the new class is so
diverse, "no decisions are simply
based on ethnicity," said Dean of
Admissions James Montoya.
"Stanford is in a unique posi
tion to attract the very best stu

dents across the country," he
said. "Having worked at two
other highly selective institutions
(Occidental and Vassar), I was
pleased and amazed by the quality


G.B. Manriquez — Daily
of students we get."
The Admissions Office expects
about 1,580 students to enroll
next year, an increase from the
1,525 expected last year. A little
more than half of those accepted
usually decide to attend.
The students who don't come
to Stanford most often go to

schools such as Harvard, Yale,
MIT and Princeton.
According to Montoya, the size
of the freshman class is not deter
mined by the Admissions Office.
"Another committee looks at the
broader range of students and
decides that," he said. "For
instance, since the graduation
rate has crept up, more students
are needed, so the freshman class
will be larger."
The total number of applicants
has decreased slightly from last

year's pool of 13,500. Montoya
said he does not believe that this
is a result of recent negative pub
licity about Stanford's indirect
cost controversy.
"Given the size and quality of the
pool, it's difficult for me to believe
that is the case," he said. "But the
(final) enrollment will be a better
sign" of the effects of the publicity.
More than a third of next
year's admits are from California,
with New York and Texas follow
ing second with 5.5 percent each.

There are also several interna
tional students from 33 foreign
countries, including three from
Bulgaria, two from Russia, two
from Hungary and one from
Yugoslavia.
All the applications are
reviewed first by the admissions
directors, who then submit their
recommendations to the deans.
Montoya makes the final decision,
but he said "there is a lot of dis
cussion" among the deans.
Montoya said the deans spent

anywhere from two hours to half
a day on a single application.
"There are two rounds," he said.
"In the first round, there are
2,000 admits for the students who
have really distinguished them
selves. Then there are 2,400 put
in a middle group. The other
9,000 we say 'no' to."
In the second round, the middle
group is reviewed, 800 of which
are offered admission, with the
other 600 put on the wait list. The
other 1,000 are denied admission.
