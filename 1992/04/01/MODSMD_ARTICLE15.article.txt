## 'Counterculture' to a drinking society

serve the tradition of anonymity.
It's noon, Friday. Students are finishing classes in the Quad and
preparing for the evening's happy hours on the Row.
But the scene at the Bridge is very different. A group of men and
women, ranging in age from 20 to 60, gather for support. One man,
immaculately dressed in a blue pin-striped suit, introduces himself
as the leader of the group: "Hi. I'm Paul. I'm an alcoholic."
One by one the group members share their stories, recounting
how they started drinking and when they realized they had lost con
trol. Together, they reinforce the idea that it's OK to stay sober.
"People in this society have the view that it's normal to drink, and if
you're not drinking, you're abnormal," said Robert Matano, Director of
the Alcohol and Drug Treatment Clinic at Stanford Hospital.
"Purely from a cultural perspective, you need a counterculture
that normalizes abstinence ... (and) says it's OK to get sober and
stay sober in this society," Matano said.
Alcoholics Anonymous provides this counterculture for recovering
alcoholics, Matano said.
Alcoholics Anonymous' famous 12-steps recovery program origi
nated in the first AA group, founded in Akron, Ohio in 1935 when
"two drunks got together to help each other stay sober," as one AA
member described it.
When Paul, a graduate student in one of Stanford's professional
schools, went to his first AA meeting, he "saw people in that room
whom I knew — fellow students, professors and staff [members],
but I didn't think it was for me or what I needed," he said.
