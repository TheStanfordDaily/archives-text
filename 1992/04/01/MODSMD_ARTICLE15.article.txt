## 'Counterculture' to a drinking society

Editor's Note: All names of Alcoholics Anonymous members have
been changed in this story. The AA program asks that members pre
serve the tradition of anonymity.
It's noon, Friday. Students are finishing classes in the Quad and
preparing for the evening's happy hours on the Row.
But the scene at the Bridge is very different. A group of men and
women, ranging in age from 20 to 60, gather for support. One man,
immaculately dressed in a blue pin-striped suit, introduces himself
as the leader of the group: "Hi. I'm Paul. I'm an alcoholic."
One by one the group members share their stories, recounting
how they started drinking and when they realized they had lost con
trol. Together, they reinforce the idea that it's OK to stay sober.
"People in this society have the view that it's normal to drink, and if
you're not drinking, you're abnormal," said Robert Matano, Director of
the Alcohol and Drug Treatment Clinic at Stanford Hospital.
"Purely from a cultural perspective, you need a counterculture
that normalizes abstinence ... (and) says it's OK to get sober and
stay sober in this society," Matano said.
Alcoholics Anonymous provides this counterculture for recovering
alcoholics, Matano said.
Alcoholics Anonymous' famous 12-steps recovery program origi
nated in the first AA group, founded in Akron, Ohio in 1935 when
"two drunks got together to help each other stay sober," as one AA
member described it.
When Paul, a graduate student in one of Stanford's professional
schools, went to his first AA meeting, he "saw people in that room
whom I knew — fellow students, professors and staff [members],
but I didn't think it was for me or what I needed," he said.

Paul tried to quit on his own,
but found he "was not getting bet
ter. I wouldn't drink but I was get
ting depressed," he said. "I wasn't
getting the schoolwork done that I
needed to do to graduate."
He went bade for another AA
meeting — "the first meeting of my
recovery," — followed their sugges
tion to attend 90 meetings in 90 days
and got "hooked" on the program.
"I came to AA a drunk and by
the time I graduated, I was able to
do all my work. I had more of a
sense of self," he said.
A sense of belonging
AA also allows members to
build connections with others, a
difficult task for many alcoholics.
"People have the expectation
that alcohol will improve cogni
tive, physical and social function
ing, such as thinking and danc
ing," Matano said. The danger in
this is: "If you don't know how to
interact without alcohol, you

never interact without alcohol."
"I saw the drinking as my social
life," Paul said. "I wasn't a soli
tary drinker — I drank with lots of
people. But in terms of developed
relationships where I'm sharing
who I am, what's going on in my
w0r1d,... that was not fully possi
ble for me until I came to AA."
Barry, a Stanford graduate stu
dent in the Humanities, came to AA
after checking into Stanford Hospi
tal with "the DTs" — or delirium
tremens, a result of alcohol poison
ing. "The first time I went to an AA
meeting I thought they were a
bunch of losers," he said. "I had an
attitude — I could quit by myself
and I didn't want help. I had always
hated the idea of getting help."
Paul said AA's first step, "admit
ting we were powerless over alco
hol," was easy. "It was the word,
'we' that was hard for me. (The idea
that) I couldn't do it on my own."
And Matano said he sees the
support of a group as vital to an
alcoholic's recovery. "People need
supports in their lives. We turn on

a switch and depend on electricity.
We depend upon the Middle East
for oil. We're in a massive interde
pendency system. People need to
depend on something through life
for their recovery," he said.
"AA give a sense of continued
belonging, a sense of being in a
group with shared values,"
Matano said. "You wouldn't say
joining and maintaining member
ship in the Elk's Club was foster
ing dependency."
The spiritual experience
The terms "God," "Higher
Power," and "spiritual experi
ence" are commonly used in the
12 Steps, AA literature and by AA
members — facts that may turn
off some people who don't consid
er themselves religious.
A common misimpression of
this is "that in order to recover,
people must acquire an immediate
and overwhelming God-conscious
ness followed at once by a vast
change in feelings and outlook,"
according to the AA Big Book.

The 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous
Step one Step eight
'We admitted we were powerless over alcohol — 'Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and
that our lives had become unmanageable.' became willing to make amends to them all.'
Step two Step nine
'Came to believe that a Power greater 'Made direct amends to such people wherever possible,
than ourselves could restore us to sanity.' except when to do so would injure them or others.'
Step three Step ten
'Made a decision to turn our will and our livesover to the 'Continued to take personal inventory and when
care of God as we understand Him.' we were wrong promptly admitted it."
Step four Step eleven
'Made a searching and fearless 'Sought through prayer and meditation to improve
moral inventory of ourselves.' our conscious contact with God
Step five as we understand Him, praying only
'Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another for knowledge of His will for us and
human being the exact nature of our wrongs.' the power to carry that out."
Step six Step twelve
'Were entirely ready to have God remove 'Having had a spiritual awakening
all these defects of character.' as the result of these steps, we tried
Step seven to carry this message to alcoholics and
'Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.' to practice these principles in all our affairs.'

This impression is false,
according to the book, which
describes the "spiritual" experi
ence" as slow changes in the alco
holic noticed first by the alco

holic's friends. Finally, the alco
holic realizes that he has "under
gone a profound alteration in his
reaction to life" and that such a
change could hardly have been

brought about by himself alone.
AA members define this aware
ness of a Power greater than
themselves as the essence of spir
itual experience.
