# Official claims Axess problems will soon ease
## 
### Holly Hacker Senior staff writer 
Students frustrated with Axess, the new com
puterized student information access program,
will be glad to know the long lines and system
crashes they've encountered this week should dis
appear soon. However, only a limited number of
students will be able to use it at once.
Elizabeth Hodge, systems development analyst
for the Registrar's office, said the office yesterday
began to limit the number of students who can log
on to Axess, in an effort to avoid the problems
many have already encountered with the service
this week.
Axess, which lets students do everything from
find out their grades to file their study lists, is meant
to be a cheaper, faster, easier alternative to lines at
the Registrar's office, according to Hodge. But the
program's debut has not lived up to this promise.
Monday, the system crashed because too many
students logged on at once. Although Axess was
working again yesterday, students had to wait as long
as 15 minutes to log on to the system at Old Union.
"I'm frustrated as hell," freshman Michael Sul
livan said yesterday while waiting to use Axess.
"It takes so damn long."
Senior Ellen Tauber said she was similarly dis
gruntled. "I tried to get in here yesterday and
waited 10 minutes to enter my PIN (personal
identification number)." Tauber finally aborted
the program because she was tired of waiting for
the system to proceed.
Hodge said the problems stu
dents have experienced are unre
lated to the Axess program itself,
but rather with the fact that
everyone is using the new system
and spending a lot of time on it.
Because the program is brand

new, Hodge said it is natural for
students to play around with the
computer and try all of its options.
"The average session is proba
bly much longer right now than it
will be in the future," Hodge said,
adding that students will probably
end up spending about six min
utes per session on the computer.
In addition, Hodge said the sys
tem is overburdened because
most students want to find out

their winter quarter grades as
soon as they get back from spring
break. She said students should
have an easier time accessing the
system next week, after most peo
ple have found out their grades.
Some students complained
about the fact that they can't use
Axess from 10 a.m. to noon or 2
p.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays.
"It would be nice if they could
just have it open all the time,"

said graduate student Emily Fin
layson. "The whole point is to
make it convenient."
However, Hodge explained
that the decision was made
because "the load on the Forsythe
mainframe is so heavy" during
those times, when student, facul
ty and staff computer use taxes
the mainframe.
Hodge recommends that stu
dents use Axess on nights and week

ends, when fewer users are logged
into the Forsythe mainframe. She
said about 5,000 students logged on
to Axess last weekend without
major problems or delays.
"If [students] can use it nights
and weekends, they'll be as happy
as clams," Hodge said.
"This isn't the way it's going to
work long-term," Hodge added.
"It's meant to be very easy to
use."
