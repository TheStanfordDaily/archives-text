# Official claims Axess problems will soon ease
## 
### Holly Hacker Senior staff writer 
Students frustrated with Axess, the new com
puterized student information access program,
will be glad to know the long lines and system
crashes they've encountered this week should dis
appear soon. However, only a limited number of
students will be able to use it at once.
Elizabeth Hodge, systems development analyst
for the Registrar's office, said the office yesterday
began to limit the number of students who can log
on to Axess, in an effort to avoid the problems
many have already encountered with the service
this week.
Axess, which lets students do everything from
find out their grades to file their study lists, is meant
to be a cheaper, faster, easier alternative to lines at
the Registrar's office, according to Hodge. But the
program's debut has not lived up to this promise.
Monday, the system crashed because too many
students logged on at once. Although Axess was
working again yesterday, students had to wait as long
as 15 minutes to log on to the system at Old Union.
"I'm frustrated as hell," freshman Michael Sul
livan said yesterday while waiting to use Axess.
"It takes so damn long."
Senior Ellen Tauber said she was similarly dis
gruntled. "I tried to get in here yesterday and
waited 10 minutes to enter my PIN (personal
identification number)." Tauber finally aborted
the program because she was tired of waiting for
the system to proceed.
