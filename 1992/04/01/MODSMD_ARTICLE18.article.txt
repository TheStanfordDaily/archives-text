UN imposes sanctions on Libya
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The Security
Council voted yesterday to ban flights and arm
sales to Libya, branding it a terrorist state for
shielding six men accused of blowing up Pan Am
Flight 103 and a French airliner.
Wearing black for mourning, relatives of some
of the 270 victims of the 1988 Pan Am bombing
watched from the visitors' gallery as the council
imposed the sanctions by a 10-0 vote.
"Libya has been indicted," said George
Williams, whose son Jordy died when the plane
blew up over Scotland. "The finger has been

pointed at them as having been deeply involved in
the bombing of Pan Am 103."
The United Nations sanctions are scheduled to
take effect April 15, but will be withheld if Col.
Moammar Gadhafi's government surrenders the
six suspects sought by France, Britain and the Unit
ed States and takes steps to "cease all forms of ter
rorist action and all assistance to terrorist groups."
The resolution also demands compensation for
the victims and calls on member states to expel
most Libyan diplomats.
But its impact will be severely limited because
the sanctions do not include a broad trade embar
go. Libya can still earn money from oil sales.
