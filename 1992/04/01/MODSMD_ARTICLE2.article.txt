# White theme house approved
## 
### David Blanco Kimberly Whitman Editorial staff 
Stanford's newest dormitory
will become a "white theme
house" beginning this fall, the
Office of Residential Education
announced yesterday.
Manzanita II will be the fifth
ethnic theme house on campus.
According to Res Ed Director
Alice Supton, the house will give
white students a place to "be
themselves."
Supton said some non-white
students will live in the dorm, but
priority will go to white students.
White freshmen will also be able
to request a roommate of their
own race, she said.
Res Ed's multicultural educa
tor, Greg Ricks, praised the
theme house idea. "For too long,
people have been saying multicul
turalism is only for students of
color," he said. "Multiculturalism
is for everybody. Now white stu
dents will feel included."
Ricks said the dorm will be
inclusive of the "hidden diversi
ty" within the white community.
"I don't want to see a situation
where so-called 'WASPs' and
WASP issues dominate the dorm.
Other groups, such as Jewish-
Americans, Canadians and stu
dents who identify with Southern
culture will feel at home."
But several non-white stu
dents have already expressed con
cerns about the plan.
"What are they going to do, sit
around and eat mayonnaise?"
