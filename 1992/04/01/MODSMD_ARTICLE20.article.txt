# Finding the way: Different paths lead to sobriety and self-knowledge
## 
### June Cohen Deirdre Woo 
While the popularity of Alco
holics Anonymous and the prolif
eration of other 12-steps pro
grams testifies to the method's
success in treating addiction,
other equally effective programs
exist as well.
"Alcoholics Anonymous offers
tremendous value to the commu
nity as one way — not the only
way — to cope with addiction,"
said Alejandro Martinez, director
of Counseling and Psychological
Services.
Other approaches — in-patient
and out-patient, group and indi
vidual — are provided by campus
and area clinics, such as the Stan
ford Hospital's Alcohol and Drug
Treatment Clinic.
"Both AA and therapy have
similar goals — to promote sobri
ety and self-understanding," said
Robert Matano, director of the
clinic. "But the methods used are
very different."
Different methods
One of the greatest differences
between AA's 12-step program
and the interactive group therapy
used in the clinic's outpatient pro
gram lies in their perspectives on
interpersonal interactions.
Interactive group therapy
relies heavily on interpersonal
learning, and the here-and-now of
the group meeting, Matano said.
But in AA, the interactive pro
cess — or cross-talk — is not per
mitted. Since it is a leaderless
group, there would be no one
there to lead through any conflict
that might ensue, he said.
Other differences include the
fact that therapy at the clinic is
run by professional leaders, while
AA is leaderless; and AA relies on
the step process, while therapy
has a different conceptual
approach.
These approaches, however,
are not mutually exclusive. It's
very common for people to do
both long-term therapy and AA at
once, said Matano.
"During the first year, people
need massive amounts of sup
port," Matano said. "Often, we

phase out as AA phases in."
The Alcohol and Drug Treat
ment Clinic provides four levels of
treatment, from initial in-patient
detox programs to long-term
group therapy sessions.
About 95 percent of their treat
ment is out-patient, Matano said.
But most patients admitted
require costly initial in-patient
treatment for detoxification.
Patients going through detox
typically remain in the hospital
for about three to five days, at a
cost of $600 to $1500 per day.
Patients then proceed through
a two-part, seven week structured
daily out-patient program that
combines group with individual
therapy.
Matano said the clinic's thera

py program tries to bridge tradi
tional approaches to chemical
dependency treatment — which
focus on physiological aspects of
the disease — with modern ideas
on psychotherapy, which empha
size the treatment of underlying
psychological symptoms.
"We give a lot of weight to psy
chiatric variables," he said. "We
think there are antecedent psycho
logical problems that set people up
for drug use," and the sessions
address these underlying problems
as well as the addiction itself.
'Weekend drinking' prevalent
Psychological problems other
than addiction generally lead stu
dents to approach CAPS coun
selors for therapy, Martinez said.

Frequently, students develop
problems in other areas of their
lives that lead them to request
counseling — and alcohol abuse is
later uncovered as a contributing
factor, he said.
Vincent D'Andrea, a CAPS
counselor specializing in the
treatment of alcoholism, said
about 12 students with drinking
problems contact him per year,
but he believes the number of
alcoholic students on campus is
higher.
CAPS provides students with
up to 10 free sessions with a coun
selor, at the conclusion of which
the counselor may recommend
follow-up care, based on both the
severity of the addiction and the
student's resources.

CAPS surveys show that about
4 percent of students' drinking
patterns "clearly indicate" serious
problems with alcohol, Martinez
said. But the predominant pattern
at Stanford is "weekend drinking,
which presents a whole different
array of problems," he said.
Martinez said this pattern is
characterized by "binge drinking,"
in which an individual imbibes
large amounts of alcohol sporadi
cally.
This type of drinking behavior
does not necessarily qualify as
an addiction, he said. However,
it may lead to other problems
and result in actions that harm
the individual or others, such as
abusive arguments or sexual
assault.
