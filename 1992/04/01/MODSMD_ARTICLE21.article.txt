# Insurance not enough to cover steep treatment costs
## 
### June Cohen Deirdre Woo 
Despite the range of treatment programs
available for alcoholics, students' choices
can be severely limited by their ability to pay
for the sometimes costly help.
Beyond the free, short-term treatment pro
vided at CAPS, the costs of treatment for alco
holism can be steep, and the amount covered
by health insurance depends on the individual
policy.
Stanford's student health insurance classi
fies the treatment of alcoholism under psy
chotherapy, and covers some — but not all —
the costs of treating addictions to alcohol and
other drugs.
According to Jane Meier, associate direc
tor of Student Health Services at Cowell,
about half the student population — mostly
graduate students — are covered by Stan
ford's student health insurance. Most
undergraduates are covered by their par
ents' policy, she said.
Stanford's policy partially covers out
patient programs for alcoholifcs", 'but 1 costly
in-patient treatment, such as hospital detox
ification, is not covered at all.
Rates for in-patient treatment at Stan
ford Hospital's Alcohol and Drug Treat
ment Clinic range from $600 to $1500 per
day for three to five days. A year of out
patient treatment at the clinic costs about
$6,500.

Inpatient treatment —
such as detxification —
costs between $600 and
$1500 per day

Student health insurance provides up to
$1,500 — after a $200 deductible — to cover
"usual and customary fees" for outpatient
treatment.
The clause, "usual and customary" is
"standard insurance jargon," according to
Meier, and means the policy will only cover
fees that are in-line with the average
amount charged for the services.
Insurance will cover 50 percent of the
treatment costs, or $40 per session, whichev
er is less, Meier said.
Treating 'depression'
Because in-patient treatment for alco
holism is not covered by most health insur
ance policies, including Stanford's, students
who require acute detoxification must
sometimes find creative ways to pay for
treatment.
Since Stanford's health insurance policy
covers in-patient treatment for other psycho
logical problems, CAPS may provide students

with a dual diagnosis — for both alcoholism
and a related psychological disorder, such as
depression — so the student can receive less
costly, if less specialized, in-patient care for
the secondary disorder, he said.
"This isn't a hokey diagnosis," D'Andrea
said, adding that almost all people abusing
alcohol experience depression.
Students can receive in-patient treatment
for depression at an outpatient clinic such as
the Behavioral Medicine Clinic at Stanford
Hospital, according to D'Andrea.
The Behavioral Medicine Clinic mainly
treats patients with phobias, eating disor
ders and several grades of depression, and
does not treat people for alcohol or drug
addiction, according to an office assistant
there.
It would be more efficient if health insur
ance covered diagnoses of substance abuse
so a patient could go directly to the clinic
specializing in her particular disease rather
than receiving generalized treatment at
another clinic, D'Andrea conceded.
D'Andrea said that among insurance
companies nationally, there is "more and
more resistence to (covering the costs of)
mental health coverage.
"It seems a little discriminatory to me,"
D'Andrea said, adding that the American
Medical Association considers alcoholism a
disease, while insurance companies catego
rize substance abuse and addiction as a psy
chological problem.
