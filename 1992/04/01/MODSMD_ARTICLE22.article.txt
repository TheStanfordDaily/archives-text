# Is your drinking a problem?
## 
### 
□ Do you lose time from school
because of drinking?
□ Do you drink to lose shyness
and build up self-confidence?
□ Is drinking affecting your
reputation?
□ Do you drink to escape from
study of home worries?
□ Does it bother you if somebody
says maybe you drink too much?
□ Do you have to take a drink to
go out on a date?
□ Do you ever get into money
trouble over buying alcohol?
□ Have you lost friends since you
started drinking?
□ Do you hang out now with a
crowd where stuff is easy to get?
□ Do you drink until the bottle is
empty?
□ Have you ever had a loss of
memory from drinking?
□ Has drunk driving ever put you
in a hospital or jail?
□ Do you get annoyed with
classes or lectures on drinking?
□ Do you think you have a
problem with liquor?
A "Yes" to one question is a
warning. A "yes" to as few as
three questions means that
alcohol has almost certainly
become — or is becoming — a
serious problem.
