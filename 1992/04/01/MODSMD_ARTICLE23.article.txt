Xenophobic regulations
deserved to be bypassed
by new University plan

THE GRADUATE SCHOOL of
Business and the Petroleum
Engineering Department
have wisely addressed rigid and
unsympathetic new Immigration
and Naturalization Services regula
tions.
The 1990 Immigration Act has to
be condemned for the discriminato
ry philosophy that it legitimizes.
Under the old provisions, for
eign students were allowed to
work off-campus during the sum
mers or during the academic year
if they could prove severe econom
ic necessity. These provisions have
been replaced.
The 1990 Act make it "practical
ly impossible" for foreign students
on F-l visas to work off-campus
during the summers, according to
Rolando Villalobos, the interna
tional student adviser at Bechtel
International Center.
Employers can now hire foreign
students only if they have actively
recruited U.S. citizens for 60 days.
During the current period of eco
nomic recession, this effectively
makes it impossible for well-qualified
foreign students to secure off-cam
pus training in their respective fields.
The argument frequently made
against foreign student employ
ment is that it snatches jobs away
from American workers. But this
myth was exploded by the Price
Waterhouse Report commissioned
by Congress in the spring of 1991.
The report found that internation
al student employment had no
negative repercussions on job
opportunities for Americans.
The arrangement worked out by
the academic departments here at
Stanford will enable students to
integrate academic work with
practical training in their fields
while circumventing the unfair
provisions of the Immigration Act.

Although the program is being
offered through only two depart
ments this quarter, other depart
ments, including those in the
humanities and social sciences,
should also make the effort to come
up with imaginative links that will
help students in a pragmatic way.
Other universities, like UC-
Berkeley and Cornell, are attempt
ing to confront the Immigration
Act head on by appealing to
Congress itself. These are com
mendable initial steps toward dis
mantling the draconian decree.
In the past year, the INS has
changed its regulations severl
times, intensifying the disorienta
tion experienced by students who
are still newcomers to the intrica
cies of the legal system in this
country.
Many foreign students are on
some sort of financial assistance
program, and working off-campus
can help augment their meagre
earnings. Under the Immigration
Act, international students are no
longer protected against unfore
seen financial distress; they must
have the opportunity to work off
campus to cover such crises.
The law was allegedly passed by
Congress in response to pressure
from certain business lobbies
plagued by the problem of chronic
labor shortage. Ironically enough,
it appears that this act actually
denies U.S. firms the best talent
from other countries
The INS is sending out danger
ous signals to foreign students at a
time when frightening xenophobic
voices are being heard all over
Europe and in the United States.
For example, the recent regional
elections in France witnessed size
able support for the right-wing
party of Jean-Marie Le Pen, who
espouses virulent anti-immigrant
and anti-Semitic positions.
It is all too simple to lash out at
immigrant groups when facing a
troubled economic situation at
home. Students should not be sac
rificial lambs subject to the whims
of Washington and their policies of
convenience.
