## Need a cure for date anxiety? 
### 
SPRING IS IN the air. I begin this
way as a warning: THIS COLUMN
MAY BE TRITE. Why? Well,
because I want to talk about dating at
Stanford.
No, this topic is not profound or press
ing, but for me and my friends it is some
what consuming. So many of our conver
sations revolve around issues of dating,
from inter-racial dating to the basic ques
tion of who to date.
And a majority of these conversations
are spent complaining: "There is no one
to date," "I have no time to date" and my
favorite, "What woman would be inter
ested in dating a guy like me with such a
large butt?"
I am certainly no authority on dating.
Yet I have made enough mistakes to fill
up a volume or two, and I guess that
makes me something (like an idiot, as one
friend suggested).
My biggest mistake and one most
often made is taking the whole concept to
seriously. The best advice I have ever got
ten is "Cory, don't sweat it."
For me, dates are so overwhelming
that in the moments before the ensuing
event I go through about two or three
shirts due to persistent pit pouring. For
tunately, with my strategic move from
antiperspirant to cotton swabs, I am able
to save myself some embarrassment.
I guess my dating anxiety stems from
the fact that I often go into a date with

unrealistic expectations. I see each per
son as a possible spouse and spend the
entire evening figuring out reasons why a
relationship (or our marriage) will or
most often will not work out.
Even in asking people out, I too often
limit myself to people I believe fit my
soul-mate image. I have found that these
attitudes are limiting and self-defeating.
I try not to think about dating any
more. Instead, I try to think about
"friending." At a university such as this,
where I am surrounded by incredibly fas
cinating and diverse people, seeking out
someone who fits a preconceived mold is
shallow to say the least.
When I do "seek to expand my circle of
friends by getting to know someone dif
ferent, I then find that I learn the most
about myself and usually have the best
time.
It bothers me how often I find myself
relaxing in my comfortable niche at this
university, content with "my crowd." It's
unfortunate, but I have found that when
I get really comfortable a part of me ceas
es to grow and, consequently, begins to
die.
Yet when I have motivated myself to
get off my large tuchas and ask someone
new to share a meal or drink, the tur
bines begin to fire. Dinner conversations
are the greatest things — my attitudes
often get challenged, I gain new perspec
tives and I usually have fun.

So what's point am I trying to make?
Well, I would love to inspire someone to
step out of their circle of friends and ask
someone out. But this column is about
as inspirational as a used tissue. So
instead I would like to run a small exper
iment.
This is no joke. It is for all those people
out there who, like me, have ever com
plained about dating. From today until
Friday at midnight, anyone interested in
meeting someone new for the simple pur
pose of (hopefully) making a friend
should call me up 323-2842.
This is not a dating service. I don't
want to know anything about you but
your name, sex, sex of the person you
would like to date (or better yet, to
"friend") and your telephone number.
Over the weekend my friends and I
will randomly put people together and
send them out on a — whatever. I chal
lenge you to take a risk and try this, then
talk to me about the results. It could be
fun, and at the least you'll learn some
thing (probably never to trust me again.)
I'll provide the cotton swabs.

is looking forward to hearing from you.

out there who, like me, have ever com
plained about dating. From today until
Friday at midnight, anyone interested in
meeting someone new for the simple pur
pose of (hopefully) making a friend
should call me up 323-2842.
This is not a dating service. I don't
want to know anything about you but
your name, sex, sex of the person you
would like to date (or better yet, to
"friend") and your telephone number.
Over the weekend my friends and I
will randomly put people together and
send them out on a — whatever. I chal
lenge you to take a risk and try this, then
talk to me about the results. It could be
fun, and at the least you'll learn some
thing (probably never to trust me again.)
I'll provide the cotton swabs.

Cory Booker is a co-terminal student who
is looking forward to hearing from you.
