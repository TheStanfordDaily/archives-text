University broke promise of better undergrad education

ONCE UPON A TIME, our illustri
ous University President Donald
Kennedy promised a renewed
commitment to teaching at Stanford.
His announcement was greeted with
much fanfare.
Kennedy was roundly applauded as a
visionary for addressing the situation at
Stanford and sending a warning to other
research universities. Undergraduates
breathed a collective sigh of relief.
Now, two years later, undergraduate
education at Stanford still suffers from
devaluation and neglect. Little progress
is apparent. In fact, the situation seems
to be worsening.
Within the current budget-trimming
atmosphere, teaching is increasingly
being seen as excess fat. The problem is
most serious in the science and engi
neering departments, where classes are
particularly large and the teaching is
particularly uninspired.

When asked why teaching quality is
deteriorating, University administrators
often point to the lack of money. Money
is required to improve teaching facilities
and to attract top professors, they cry.
However, the problem is more a matter
of priorities than funding: research is
presently considered more beneficial to the
long-term welfare of the University than
teaching. This is clear because administra
tors could make, if they so desired, several
initial changes requiring little money.
First, administrators could improve
the system for evaluating teaching. This
would provide professors with better
feedback, and more credible teaching
evaluations would carry greater weight
in professors' evaluations for tenure.
Peer reviews of teaching desperately
need to be implemented — that is, pro
fessors should attend other professors'
classes. This would also encourage the
discussion of teaching practices among

faculty and spread innovative ideas.
Furthermore, student evaluations of
teaching needs improvement. At pre
sent, many administrators and faculty
do not take student evaluations serious
ly because they do not believe students
can adequately judge teaching quality.
This belief is self-fulfilling: students,
realizing the impotence of their input,
do not fill out evaluations carefully. Yet
students do have the ability to judge pro
fessors' teaching reliably.
The University can create better
questionnaires, poll student opinions
more than just once during the quarter,
make sure students have enough time to
complete questionnaires and clearly
explain the role of student evaluations.
Second, administrators could reform
the method for evaluating research pro
ductivity.
Currently, when professors are being
evaluated, all their publications are list

ed. The University should instead limit
the number of publications considered
and use a citation account (i.e., the num
ber of times other scholars cite an arti
cle) as an index of quality.
These changes would also provide
professors with more time to spend on
teaching by decreasing the pressure to
publish and, therefore, create greater
rewards for excellence in teaching.
Both professors and administrators
must realize that the damage caused by
poor instruction is severe: It angers and
frustrates bright students, inhibits
excitement and lowers the number of
future scholars.
Since government funding of research
at Stanford has been drastically reduced
recently, this may be the ideal time to
reconsider the priorities of this universi
ty and the importance of teaching.
