# Election reform vital in improving politics

If the true intent of our electoral sys
tem is to select the best possible repre
sentatives to govern by, and for, the peo
ple, then our current system has failed
miserably. How many of us truly believe
our elected officials govern with our best
interests at heart?
Our government has evolved into a
body concerned with protecting big busi
ness and special interest groups. Con
cern for the well being of the general
populace has fallen by the way.
Candidates for public office too often
are groomed, trained and sponsored to
protect the profits of corporations or the
interests of a privileged minority.
The time has come to change the pri
orities of those we elect to represent us.
And the way to do that is to change the

way we elect them to begin with.
The first step is to eliminate all fund
ing for candidates from any source other
than a general election fund. All money
received for any candidate or campaign
will go directly into this pool, and every
qualified candidate will receive an equal
amount of money.
An accounting for this money will be
made by each candidate to the commit
tee operating the fund. Donations from
other sources would be illegal. Individu
als supporting a candidate would be able
to donate only their personal time and
energy.
This system would remove candidates
from the pockets of special interests and
return the "fair fight" element to our
elections. Elections would revert to the
intended focus on the strength of the
candidate's beliefs, abilities and merit.
Voters would finally have a real choice.
