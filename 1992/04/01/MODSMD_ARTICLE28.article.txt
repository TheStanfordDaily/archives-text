# Speaker wasn't best choice for ceremony
## 
### 
To those who wouid prefer art histo
rian and alumnus Kirk Varnedoe over a
widely known luminary as the choice for
commencement speaker â€” pshaw!
Perhaps in the fine tradition of art
history, we should hold commencement
in a darkened room and view slides of
University President Donald Kennedy's
wedding reception, while he relates to us
amusing anecdotes about the latest
round of budget cuts in the arts.
Or we could all just have a little
snooze while President emeritus Richard
Lyman expounds on the origins of anti
intellectual Philistines, such as myself.
Better yet, let's cancel commence
ment and use the money to pay back the
U.S. government for Kennedy's cham
pagne wishes and caviar dreams.

Maybe the money will help to fund a
real artist.
