# Massive tapeworm is found inside stomach
## 
### Scoops Dworkin Staff writer 
When freshman Wayne Ces
tode went to Stanford Medical
Center with stomach pains, he
thought he had an ulcer.
Thirty-six hours later, doctors
removed a 104-foot-long tape
worm from his stomach.
"It was really gross," the Bran
ner resident said. "I still get
queasy just thinking about it."
Tess Falory, the doctor who
operated on Cestode March 19,
said that while tapeworms are
"not uncommon," worms of this
size "are unheard of elsewhere."
She said the worms are normally
15 to 20 feet long.
Falory said Cestode "became
infested" after eating beef con
taminated with the worm.
"It most likely came from

undercooked beef, probably from
Stanford's food service," Falory
said.
Beef tapeworm eggs, she said,
hatch after being eaten by cows,
then bore through the cow's
intestines to the blood stream and
on to the muscles.
If the muscle is then eaten
without proper cooking, the
worm emerges from its bladder
and attaches to the stomach wall,
where it takes its nourishment
from its new human host.
As for Cestode, he said he is
"feeling fit as a fiddle" after his
worming. He even got out of the
hospital in time to enjoy his
spring break trip to Mexico.
"I sunned, I tanned, I got
drunk on tequila. But," he says,
smiling, "I didn't eat the worm."
