## Star watchers spruce up the Dish to search for pulsars State-of-the-art signal processing chips will bring familiar foothills landmark back into scientific usage 
### Marcos Polanco 
The Dish is staging a comeback.
The National Science Foundation plans to have
the familiar foothills landmark hunting for pulsars
by next year, thanks to the technological help of a
Stanford professor and his graduate students.
The Dish is maintained and operated by SRI
International, a Menlo Park-based research insti
tute previously affiliated with the University.
It was built in 1962 as part of a project exploring
novel antenna designs for the study of the iono
sphere, a plasma shell which envelops the earth.
Funded by the Department of Defense, the research
sought to bounce signals off the ionosphere for com
munication and surveillance purposes. The investi
gations were mostly successful.
Then, because of radio interference from the
area's development and waning interest from the
Defense Department, the Dish was left without a
purpose. The NSF decided to concentrate its fund
ing in national centers like the National Radioas
tronomy Observatory. By 1985, the Dish had been
written off as useless by the scientific community.
But armed with the latest signal processing tech
nologies and a cadre of graduate students, Prof.
Allen Peterson, director of the STAR Lab, has engi
neered the Dish's return.
The chips designed by his group possess the com
putational power to slice a broad spectrum of fre
quencies. Radio waves, like air traffic communica
tions, contribute to the interference which litters
the cosmic frequencies researchers at the STAR Lab
hope to study.
Peterson's digital signal processors slice these
incoming waves into one million channels, excise the
interference, and then reconstitute the signal. Only
a few parts per million of the signal are lost in the
process. "It's like finding the peppercorn in the sala
mi," explains Prof. Ivan Linscott, a scientist at the
STAR Lab.
These advanced electronics have made the Dish,
kept in repair by SRl's Mike Cousins, competitive
with observatories in environments less polluted by
radio waves. The NSF has taken note, and plans call
for a fully operational Dish by next year, the first
time it will see serious radioastronomic use in
decades.
STAR Lab scientists hope to focus on pulsars,
curious little objects which mark one of the last
episodes in the life of a star.
Stars are first formed as hydrogen clouds collapse
into themselves due to their own gravitational pull.
As a hydrogen mass compacts, it heats up and sets

off a thermonuclear reaction, fusing the hydrogen
into helium atoms. And then helium into carbon
into oxygen and so on, releasing energy, until iron is
produced.
The fusing of iron atoms, though, consumes ener
gy at such a rapid pace that the whole star collapses
into a orb some 10 kilometers wide in a matter of
hours. The protons and neutrons combine and the
individual atoms lose their identity, leaving only a
colossal mass of neutrons.

The NSF has taken note, and
plans call for a fully opera
tional Dish by next year, the
first time it will see serious
radioastronomic use in
decades.

The neutrons encounter the fermi force, howev
er, which prevents the neutrons from occupying the
same space at the same time. Faced by this immov
able physical reality, the neutrons bounce off each
other and explode into a supernova. A small core of
neutrons remains: a pulsar.
Pulsars rotate at close to 1,000 times a second,
and their massive magnetic fields emanate from
their equators rather than their axes, like with the
earth. Thus, adjacent hydrogen atoms stream along
the pulsar's rotating magnetic field, producing the
electromagnetic signature the Dish excels at detect
ing: the frequency of hydrogen atoms, about 1420
megahertz.
Could this much excitement happen in our very
own solar system? Unlikely. Our sun does not have
enough mass to precipitate such explosive galactic
processes. It is destined to become a small, cold and
dull brown dwarf.
Some stars are luckier. If they are large enough,
the force from their collapse can overcome even the
fermi force and a black hole results. No one, howev
er, has conclusively proved their existence.
The researchers at STAR Lab and SRI hope to
further study the structure of pulsars. Are they in
effect the relics of supernovas? What are the dynam
ics of the rotating magnetic field? How exactly do
they take shape? These questions will have to wait
until the scientists can get the Dish into operating
condition.

Because of the radio Interference from the area's development and waning interest from the Defense
Department, the Dish has been dormant for the past seven years. But thanks to the technological help
of a Stanford professor and his graduate students, it will be revived for pulsar-hunting next year.
