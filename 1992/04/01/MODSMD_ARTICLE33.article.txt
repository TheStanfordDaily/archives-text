After listening to a sample of mater
nal concern not unlike the one printed
immediately above this sentence, I real
ized that although I had been subject to
such exhortations before, my under
standing of one item was incomplete. I've
got the rubbers part down to a science
(I've been practicing with a banana), but
the bit about vitamin C had me stumped.
I'd been told that vitamin C is good for
me for so long that I never bothered to
consider the following questions: Why is
vitamin C good for me? Do I really need
the stuff, or is it just one of the myriad
trivialities — like lawn darts or the Garden
Weasel™ — being pushed on me by the
rabid consumerism of Western society?
Most importantly, vitamin C (also
known to The Wise as ascorbic acid or,
when dissolved in water, ascorbate) is
essential to the maintenance of bones,
teeth, gums, capillaries and the connec
tive tissues. Because the human body,
unlike the bodies of many other animals,
cannot make their own ascorbate, a long
term vitamin C deficiency can manifest
itself as a degeneration of these and
related systems — a condition known as
scurvy. Allow me to describe this disease
in lurid detail.
When dietary levels of ascorbate are
chronically low, the intercellular fibers
weaken; consequently, the capillaries
become fragile and hemorrhaging occurs
in the skin and gastrointestinal system.
Low vitamin C level also results in
decreased synthesis of the structural
protein collagen, which in turn causes
the gums to swell and bleed. The patient
becomes weak and anemic, and if the
condition goes untreated, it can be fatal.
Treatment, fortunately, involves nei
ther expensive drugs nor painful injec
tions: once a diagnosis is made, daily
doses of vitamin C reverse the condition
and prevent its recurrence. The doses
need not be large; to prevent or cure
scurvy only requires a regimen of about
half the U.S. recommended daily
allowance of 60 milligrams per day.
Even if your diet consists of some
thing other than salt biscuits and ale,
suboptimal intake of vitamin C can still
have negative effects. Small deficiencies
can result in personality changes, includ
ing decreased motivation, poor psy
chomotor performance (i.e., you turn
into a klutz) and a lack of motivation. In
severe cases — generally, those that end
in scurvy — depression and hysteria can
ensue.

Vitamin C has other health effects
that, while not absolutely essential for
the healthy functioning of your body, are
just plain nice. For instance, studies per
formed during the '70s have demonstrat
ed that ascorbate is absorbed by blood
borne immune cells called leukocytes,
and can promote the immune system's
response to infection and some forms of
cancer.
However (and this is a pretty big How
ever, given that I'm about to debunk one
of the big myths about this wonderful
chemical), double-blind clinical trials
have shown fairly conclusively that Vita
min C cannot cure or prevent the com
mon cold. There is still some controversy
on this point, but it looks like the
immune-system boost does not extend to
this annoying malady.
It is worth noting that your body
doesn't store very much vitamin C (just a
little in the adrenal glands, but this small
store is depleted rapidly in the absence of
dietary input), and you have to fulfill the
requirement every day. Ten glasses of
orange juice every ten days is not going
to cut it.
It is also worth noting that other
ingested chemicals can interfere with the
body's uptake of vitamin C. Aspirin
slows the uptake of ascorbate by leuko
cytes, and can mitigate the immune ben
efits of the vitamin. Oral contraceptives
and smoking both interfere with overall
systemic absorption of ascorbate; the
point here is that if you're a smoker on
The Pill who gets a lot of headaches, get
more vitamin C, for crying out loud.

ing decreased motivation, poor psy
chomotor performance (i.e., you turn
into a klutz) and a lack of motivation. In
severe cases — generally, those that end
in scurvy — depression and hysteria can
ensue.

Vitamin C has other health effects
that, while not absolutely essential for
the healthy functioning of your body, are
just plain nice. For instance, studies per
formed during the '70s have demonstrat
ed that ascorbate is absorbed by blood
borne immune cells called leukocytes,
and can promote the immune system's
response to infection and some forms of
cancer.
However (and this is a pretty big How
ever, given that I'm about to debunk one
of the big myths about this wonderful
chemical), double-blind clinical trials
have shown fairly conclusively that Vita
min C cannot cure or prevent the com
mon cold. There is still some controversy
on this point, but it looks like the
immune-system boost does not extend to
this annoying malady.
It is worth noting that your body
doesn't store very much vitamin C (just a
little in the adrenal glands, but this small
store is depleted rapidly in the absence of
dietary input), and you have to fulfill the
requirement every day. Ten glasses of
orange juice every ten days is not going
to cut it.
It is also worth noting that other
ingested chemicals can interfere with the
body's uptake of vitamin C. Aspirin
slows the uptake of ascorbate by leuko
cytes, and can mitigate the immune ben
efits of the vitamin. Oral contraceptives
and smoking both interfere with overall
systemic absorption of ascorbate; the
point here is that if you're a smoker on
The Pill who gets a lot of headaches, get
more vitamin C, for crying out loud.
