# Radio waves signal quakes, theory says
## Stanford geophysicists skeptical, but 'cautiously optimistic'

Hurricanes announce their impend
ing arrival with fierce winds and torren
tial rains. Tornadoes give notice too,
with their whirling clouds of dust
approaching from the distance.
Earthquakes, however, seem to
pounce without warning, leaving resi
dents along the San Andreas and other
fault zones completely in the dark as to
when the Big One will strike.
But based in part on data collected by
a team Stanford engineers, some scien
tists are now saying the Earth may
sound a warning before grinding its
plates together, and we just haven't
been looking — or listening — in the
right places.
The new theory proposes that the
Earth transmits natural radio signals at
very low frequencies before big earth
quakes. Scientists theorize that as pre
quake stress builds underground, the
squeezing and cracking of rocks and the
changes in groundwater flow generate
radio waves and alter the Earth's elec
trical and magnetic fields.
Proponents of the theory point to the
mysterious radio waves and related elec
trical and magnetic activity picked up by
satellites and ground sensors before
major earthquakes in Southern Califor
nia during 1986-87, Armenia in 1988
and Japan in 1989.
Stanford engineers accidentally
detected natural radio signals before the
1989 Loma Prieta quake during
research aimed at detecting enemy sub
marines.
As part of a Navy-funded program,

Aaron Baker
the engineers had set up sensors, called
magnetometers, near Monterey Bay to
measure slight changes in the Earth's
magnetic field.
On Sept. 12, 1989, the sensors
detected unusual ultra-low frequency
radio signals, which grew 30 times
stronger on Oct. 5, then weakened
somewhat. At 2 p.m. on Oct. 17, the sig
nals grew so strong they went off the
sensors' scale.
Three hours later, a quake struck
with a magnitude of 7.1 on the Richter
scale, sending the Bay Area into a panic.
The quake's epicenter was four miles
from the engineers' sensors.
But the Stanford scientist who col
lected the data remains unconvinced of
the radiowave-earthquake link. "I'm
still skeptical of my own results," Geo-

physics Prof. Antony Fraser-
Smith told the Associated Press.
Fraser-Smith and his research
earn are currently in Alaska and
:ould not be reached yesterday.
The staunchest supporter of
the radio signal theory is an
Athens University physicist
who claims he predicted six of
seven moderate-to-large quakes
in Greece in several years by
placing sensors at certain sensi
tive sites.
Scientists are skeptical, how
jver, partly because some sensi
:ive sites are hundreds of miles
from the epicenter of the
impending quake, farther than
radio signals are believed to
travel underground.
"It's a very interesting and
x i: l i

- Daily tantalizing observation, but we
don't know what to make of it," said
Prof. Mark Zoback, chair of the geo
physics department. He said that more
data need to be collected, and added that
"we are cautiously optimistic."
The Earth's environment is filled
with radio waves of varying frequencies
generated by transmitters, electrical
equipment, lightning, solar wind and
electrical activity in the Earth's upper
atmosphere.
The waves that produce music on
radios have frequencies measured in the
thousands to millions of cycles per sec
ond, while the radio signals that might
signal impending quakes have much
lower frequencies. These very low fre
quency waves can travel through a lim
ited amount of solid rock, as well as
through the atmosphere.
