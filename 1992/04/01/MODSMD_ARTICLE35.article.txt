'Clumsiness gene' located
A team of Stanford neurobiologists has located the gene
in mice that causes them to move clumsily and tremble,
stimulating the search for a comparable gene in humans
that may cause peripheral nerve disorders.
University researchers recently cloned the gene for
peripheral myelin protein-22, a substance made by
Schwann cells. Myelin is a structure that wraps around
nerves to create an insulating sheath.
The group reported in the current issue of Nature that
the PMP-22 gene lies on mouse chromosome 11, and an
altered form of the gene is found in mice known to have the
trembler mutation.
About one in every 2500 people suffer from Charcot-
Marie-Tooth, the most common inherited disease of the
peripheral nervous system. Patients experience muscle
weakness and atrophy because defective myelination ham
pers efective conduction of electrical signals along the
nerves to the muscles.
The research group has begun to search for a human
gene similar to mouse PMP-22. Their findings about this

gene will also contribute to continued studies of how
nerves repair themselves after injury.
Team tests new antidepressant
A University psychiatric team is testing a new antide
pressant drug to combat obsessive-compulsive disorder in
children and adolescents.
Researchers believe that the new drug, sertraline, will
be more effective at treating the disease than other medi
cations because it targets the brain pathways responsible
for the disorder.
Sertraline has been used successfully in adults suffer
ing from depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
The current study will test whether the drug is equally
effective in treating children and adolescents, and will
experiment with different dosages.
People suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder
perform routine tasks with inappropriate frequency.
For example, they may wash their hands hundreds of
times a day or check repeatedly to see if their door is
closed.
