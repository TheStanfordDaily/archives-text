## Life after Keefe will still be competitive 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Senior All-American Adam Keefe is headed to
the NBA, but he says the Stanford basketball team
will be better without him.
The Cardinal expects to return four starters
from this year's surprising 18-11 NCAA Tourna
ment team, but will lose the school's all-time lead
ing rebounder and second all-time scorer.
"I honestly think they'll be better," said Keefe
after an 80-75 loss to Alabama in the first round of
the Tournament. "The four people they have back
are very talented. They felt they were forced into
roles this year. The key will be Marcus' ability to
score the ball. He's had a little self-doubt about
whether he can shoot the ball, but he's a really
good 3-point shooter."
If the second half of the Alabama game is any
indication, Stanford will survive life after Keefe.
With Keefe bottled up inside, point guard Marcus
Lollie scored 14 second-half points with four 3-
pointers, Brent Williams was perfect from the field
and Peter Dukes added three treys in four
attempts.
Keefe attracted all the attention this year, but
Stanford's NCAA berth was not the work of one
player. Next year Stanford will be much more
experienced and less reliant on one player.
"We will lose the best player I have ever coached
and one of the best players ever at Stanford, but we
have a lot of good players coming back," said coach
Mike Montgomery.
"Lollie has progressed about as much as anyone
could possibly expect. Brent (Williams) is getting
better. We're encouraged. It's not going to be easy
next year, losing a guy we rely very heavily on. But
I think guys have a lot of confidence," he said.
With both an NIT Championship and NCAA
Tournament berth the past two years, Stanford
will have an experienced lineup.
Lollie was perhaps the most improved player in
the Pacific 10 Conference this year, leading the
Pac-10 in assists with 6.5 per game and a 3-to-l
assist-turnover ratio. Voted co-captain as a junior,
he will be the unquestioned team leader his senior
season.
After sporadic bench contributions his first two
seasons, Lollie has blossomed as a steady floor
leader, but will be expected to score more next
year. Lollie ranked second in the Pac-10 with a 49
percent average from 3-point territory (26 of 53).
"If there was one thing that surprised me about
Stanford, it was their point guard (Lollie)," said

the NBA, but their prospects look pretty bright for another strong showing next sea
son.
Alabama coach Wimp Sanderson.
"That little bugger-bear hit some
3-pointers that just killed us. We
didn't expect that."
Joining Lollie in the backcourt
will be junior 3-point specialist
Peter Dukes (11.7 points per
game), who started all 29 games
this year and sank 79 treys, the
most in the Pac-10. Junior Kenny
Hicks and freshmen David Har
bour and Andy Poppink will make
Stanford's backcourt one of the
deepest in the conference.
Sophomore forward Brent
Williams was sporadic in the early
season, but had the Midas touch
in the stretch drive and will
shoulder much of the scoring load
next year. He averaged 17.5
points on 63 percent shooting, six
rebounds and three assists in
Stanford's final five games.
"All the aspects are positive,"
said Williams, who frequently
caught the attention of pro scouts
looking at Keefe. "We are losing
Adam, that's a lot of production

from the offense. But we have
guys who can pick up the slack. We
might not be as good in one area,
but if we spread out our offense we
can probably be more effective."
Paul Garrett, a senior center
with one year of eligibility remain
ing, has yet to commit to a fifth
year. A surprise this year (7.8
points, 6.1 rebounds), Garrett
would most likely split time with
gentleman-giant Jim Morgan.
Sophomore Jason Weaver and
junior Carlos Williams will fill
Keefe's spot. A 6-foot-7,250-pound
transfer from Brown, Williams was
the Ivy League freshman of the
year two seasons ago.
Darren Allaway, a 6-8, 225-
pound forward from Hopkinsville,
Ky., and Dion Cross, a 6-2, 170-
pound guard from Little Rock,
Ark., will join the Cardinal as
freshmen, but will have a tough
time cracking the starting lineup.
Meanwhile, Sam Scuilli will
try to fill the massive managerial
shoes left vacant by potential
NBA point forward Mike San
doval. Scuilli will be assisted by
the boy wonder triumvirate of
Jeff Ota, Karlis Felzenberg and
Josh Kallmer.

will have an experienced lineup.
Lollie was perhaps the most improved player in
the Pacific 10 Conference this year, leading the
Pac-10 in assists with 6.5 per game and a 3-to-l
assist-turnover ratio. Voted co-captain as a junior,
he will be the unquestioned team leader his senior
season.
After sporadic bench contributions his first two
seasons, Lollie has blossomed as a steady floor
leader, but will be expected to score more next
year. Lollie ranked second in the Pac-10 with a 49
percent average from 3-point territory (26 of 53).
"If there was one thing that surprised me about
Stanford, it was their point guard (Lollie)," said

the NBA, but their prospects look pretty bright for another strong showing next sea

Alabama coach Wimp Sanderson.
"That little bugger-bear hit some
3-pointers that just killed us. We
didn't expect that."
Joining Lollie in the backcourt
will be junior 3-point specialist
Peter Dukes (11.7 points per
game), who started all 29 games
this year and sank 79 treys, the
most in the Pac-10. Junior Kenny
Hicks and freshmen David Har
bour and Andy Poppink will make
Stanford's backcourt one of the
deepest in the conference.
Sophomore forward Brent
Williams was sporadic in the early
season, but had the Midas touch
in the stretch drive and will
shoulder much of the scoring load
next year. He averaged 17.5
points on 63 percent shooting, six
rebounds and three assists in
Stanford's final five games.
"All the aspects are positive,"
said Williams, who frequently
caught the attention of pro scouts
looking at Keefe. "We are losing
Adam, that's a lot of production

from the offense. But we have
guys who can pick up the slack. We
might not be as good in one area,
but if we spread out our offense we
can probably be more effective."
Paul Garrett, a senior center
with one year of eligibility remain
ing, has yet to commit to a fifth
year. A surprise this year (7.8
points, 6.1 rebounds), Garrett
would most likely split time with
gentleman-giant Jim Morgan.
Sophomore Jason Weaver and
junior Carlos Williams will fill
Keefe's spot. A 6-foot-7,250-pound
transfer from Brown, Williams was
the Ivy League freshman of the
year two seasons ago.
Darren Allaway, a 6-8, 225-
pound forward from Hopkinsville,
Ky., and Dion Cross, a 6-2, 170-
pound guard from Little Rock,
Ark., will join the Cardinal as
freshmen, but will have a tough
time cracking the starting lineup.
Meanwhile, Sam Scuilli will
try to fill the massive managerial
shoes left vacant by potential
NBA point forward Mike San
doval. Scuilli will be assisted by
the boy wonder triumvirate of
Jeff Ota, Karlis Felzenberg and
Josh Kallmer.
Senior All-American Adam Keefe is headed to
the NBA, but he says the Stanford basketball team
will be better without him.
The Cardinal expects to return four starters
from this year's surprising 18-11 NCAA Tourna
ment team, but will lose the school's all-time lead
ing rebounder and second all-time scorer.
"I honestly think they'll be better," said Keefe
after an 80-75 loss to Alabama in the first round of
the Tournament. "The four people they have back
are very talented. They felt they were forced into
roles this year. The key will be Marcus' ability to
score the ball. He's had a little self-doubt about
whether he can shoot the ball, but he's a really
good 3-point shooter."
If the second half of the Alabama game is any
indication, Stanford will survive life after Keefe.
With Keefe bottled up inside, point guard Marcus
Lollie scored 14 second-half points with four 3-
pointers, Brent Williams was perfect from the field
and Peter Dukes added three treys in four
attempts.
Keefe attracted all the attention this year, but
Stanford's NCAA berth was not the work of one
player. Next year Stanford will be much more
experienced and less reliant on one player.
"We will lose the best player I have ever coached
and one of the best players ever at Stanford, but we
have a lot of good players coming back," said coach
Mike Montgomery.
"Lollie has progressed about as much as anyone
could possibly expect. Brent (Williams) is getting
better. We're encouraged. It's not going to be easy
next year, losing a guy we rely very heavily on. But
I think guys have a lot of confidence," he said.
With both an NIT Championship and NCAA
Tournament berth the past two years, Stanford
will have an experienced lineup.
