## Life after Keefe will still be competitive 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Senior All-American Adam Keefe is headed to
the NBA, but he says the Stanford basketball team
will be better without him.
The Cardinal expects to return four starters
from this year's surprising 18-11 NCAA Tourna
ment team, but will lose the school's all-time lead
ing rebounder and second all-time scorer.
"I honestly think they'll be better," said Keefe
after an 80-75 loss to Alabama in the first round of
the Tournament. "The four people they have back
are very talented. They felt they were forced into
roles this year. The key will be Marcus' ability to
score the ball. He's had a little self-doubt about
whether he can shoot the ball, but he's a really
good 3-point shooter."
If the second half of the Alabama game is any
indication, Stanford will survive life after Keefe.
With Keefe bottled up inside, point guard Marcus
Lollie scored 14 second-half points with four 3-
pointers, Brent Williams was perfect from the field
and Peter Dukes added three treys in four
attempts.
Keefe attracted all the attention this year, but
Stanford's NCAA berth was not the work of one
player. Next year Stanford will be much more
experienced and less reliant on one player.
"We will lose the best player I have ever coached
and one of the best players ever at Stanford, but we
have a lot of good players coming back," said coach
Mike Montgomery.
"Lollie has progressed about as much as anyone
could possibly expect. Brent (Williams) is getting
better. We're encouraged. It's not going to be easy
next year, losing a guy we rely very heavily on. But
I think guys have a lot of confidence," he said.
With both an NIT Championship and NCAA
Tournament berth the past two years, Stanford
will have an experienced lineup.
Lollie was perhaps the most improved player in
the Pacific 10 Conference this year, leading the
Pac-10 in assists with 6.5 per game and a 3-to-l
assist-turnover ratio. Voted co-captain as a junior,
he will be the unquestioned team leader his senior
season.
After sporadic bench contributions his first two
seasons, Lollie has blossomed as a steady floor
leader, but will be expected to score more next
year. Lollie ranked second in the Pac-10 with a 49
percent average from 3-point territory (26 of 53).
"If there was one thing that surprised me about
Stanford, it was their point guard (Lollie)," said

Junior Paul Garrett takes a shot as departing senior Adam Keefe positions for the
rebound. Garrett and the other players will have big shoes to fill when Keefe leaves for
the NBA, but their prospects look pretty bright for another strong showing next sea
son.
