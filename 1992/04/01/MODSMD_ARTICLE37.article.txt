# Icemen cruise to championship
## 
### Dick Winters Staff writer 
While all attention was focused on the bas
ketball teams' march to the NCAA tourna
ment and Stanford's incredible dominance at
the Olympic trials, another Cardinal team was
quietly sewing up one of the school's best win
ter records and claiming yet another champi
onship.
The Stanford ice hockey team spent March
6-8 in Fresno battling for its first ever Pacific
Collegiate Hockey Association tournament
title. The Cardinal, who won the regular sea
son for the second year in a row, finished with
a 16-3-1 record in the conference and a 21-5-1
record overall, and entered the tournament
ranked 10th in the nation among clubs. They
were joined by USC (15-4-1) and UCLA (10-9-
1). Each team would play the others once in
the tournament's round-robin format, with
the teams with the two best records advancing

to the championship game.
In the opening game of the tournament,
USC broke out to a 2-0 first period lead over
UCLA only to see that lead evaporate in the
second period. USC prevailed, though, scoring
with five minutes remaining in the game. A
win or tie against Stanford would guarantee
the Trojans a spot in the championship game.
The Stanford - USC rivalry is a heated one.
The Cardinal defeated the Trojans twice dur
ing the regular season, but also lost twice.
Each team had won a victory on the other
team's home ice.
Stanford head coach Ernie Ferrari com
mented on the teams conflicting styles of play,
"We have a great skating team. Our game is
flowing and passing, trying to outskate the
competition. They don't have the speed that
we do, so their strategy is to hit hard and try
to disrupt the flow of the game."
In one of the fastest games the PCHA has
seen, the Cardinal and the Trojans skated to a

2-2 tie. Both Cardinal goals came on the power
play as Luke Winter erased an early Trojan
lead with his first goal of the tournament late
in the second period. Senior Torque Zubeck
gave the ice-men their first lead just minutes
to go in the second period. Stanford goalie
Keith Bowen was able to shut the Trojans
down for most of the remainder of the game,
but a questionable call late in the third period
gave USC the break they needed to tie the
game with less than two minutes remaining.
In the final opening round game Stanford
needed only to tie UCLA to seal its place in the
championship game. The Bruins were the
defending champions of the PCHA going into the
tournament. The Cardinal pulled out a 2-1 win.
"We really needed a win against UCLA.
Our confidence was shaken after USC's come
back," Ferrari said. "We didn't want to go into
the championship game without a victory in
the tournament."
Stanford entered the championship
game with something to prove. Their No.
10 national ranking was slightly tar
nished by their 2-2-1 record against USC.
"This championship was important to
us in establishing ourselves nationally as

a team. On top of this, our team has
developed a personal grudge against USC
for their clutch and grab tactics. We had
something to prove," Ferrari said.
Early in the third period, a long shot
found its way through the legs of Bowen
and the Cardinal lead was cut to 2-1. The
USC comeback ended there as the Cardi
nal, remembering an earlier game in
which they squandered a 2-0 lead against
these same Trojans, dominated the last

10 minutes of the game. Senior forward
Chip Hall's goal iced the victory with
three minutes remaining.
"You could see our players on the
bench give a collective sigh of relief when
Chip scored that goal." said assistant
coach Scott Atkinson, "The game had
gotten pretty intense, and the goal
calmed us down." The Cardinal stifled
USC by playing defense for the rest of the
game winning 4-2.
