PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO
I've escaped March Madness
and discovered the spring
break serenity of NCAA
Tournament rehabilitation.
While diagramming zone
defenses in the sun-crisped
sand, I rhapsodize about the
recently finished Stanford
men's basketball season. Just
down the beach, the coaching
staffs from Kansas and Arizona
are drinking too much tequila.
For those of you who were
trapped in a mechanical engi
neering lab or were provost at
Chicago, Stanford played in
just its second NCAA Tourna
ment in the past 49 years.
Picked to finish eighth in the
Pacific 10 Conference, coach
Mike Montgomery's Cardinal
finished fourth with a 10-8
record, 18-11 overall.
I'll probably return home for
the Final Four, but right now
I'm basking in the memories of
a surprisingly successful Stan
ford season. It will take more
than Montezuma's revenge to
get me excited for spring foot
ball practice, the NHL playoffs
and the start of the World
League of American Football.
This was the season of senior
center Adam Keefe. The Ail-
American could have been play
ing for big coconuts in the NBA,
but decided to stay at Stanford.
With four new starters, there
wasn't much expectation for
Stanford to surpass last year's
NIT championship.
But almost every player
played better than expected.
Junior point guard Marcus Lol
lie led the Pac-10 in assists,
shooting guard Peter Dukes set
a Stanford mark with 79 3-
pointers, small forward Brent
Williams became an explosive
player on both ends, and senior
center Paul Garrett comple
mented Keefe inside.
Stanford blitzed to a 9-1 pre
conference schedule, defeating
Virginia, Colorado and NCAA
nemesis Siena. A road sweep of

Oregon and Oregon State to
open the Pac-10 elevated Cardi
nal hopes to the NCAA Tourna
ment and edged Stanford
briefly into the top 25.
But the Cardinal grew most
from disappointing defeats.
Four times Stanford led top 10
teams USC, UCLA and Arizona
in the second half, only to have
victory slip away. At USC,
Stanford led by seven points
with 90 seconds left, but lost
73-72 in overtime.
"Those games were difficult.
Guys were just getting used to

each other and it looked kind of
ugly," Keefe said. "But those
games we really grew together,
gave all we had out on the floor."
Stanford bounced back after
each defeat. Two days after a
heartbreaking 72-70 loss to No.
8 Arizona, the Cardinal shelled
Arizona State 86-73.
"We had a tough opponent,
we had finals, we were far away
from home in a big arena. This
is what it's all about. It was
great. The only thing more we
could have asked for was a
win," said sophomore Brent
Williams.
Williams and his Cardinal
teammates soon will be back in
the gym working for next year.
But Keefe has reserved the
spring for relaxation as he
awaits the NBA draft.
Hey, Adam, pass the suntan
lotion.
