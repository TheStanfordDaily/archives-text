# Mussina making a big splash in major leagues with Baltimore
## Orioles starting pitcher glad he finished his Stanford education 
### Robert Giton 
Being recruited as a baseball player by the
best colleges in the country, winning the
national championship in your freshman
year and pitching in the majors at age 22 —
for most, this is just a fantasy, a dream from
which you inevitably wake up. Mike Mussina
still hasn't woken up. As he recounts the
events that brought him to his position as a
starting pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles, he
knows how fortunate he has been.
"If I could have sat down when I was 10
years old and planned out what was going to
happen, I couldn't have written a better
story," he said. And if his first year in the
majors is any indication of what the future
holds in store, the best is yet to come.
Although Mussina was drafted by the Ori
oles in the eleventh round of the 1987 draft,
and was offered money that would make
most 18-year-olds drool, he knew that base
ball might not always be there and that get
ting a college education was critical.
"Injuries and such can come along when
you least expect it, and I didn't want my
hands tied because I didn't go to college.
Also, at the time, I was 18 years old and from
a small town in Pennsylvania, so I wasn't
accustomed to big city life. I'd never really
been away from home. I worked hard
through school and always looked forward to
going to college," Mussina said.
When it came to choosing colleges, Mussi
na had no difficulty. Stanford was love at
first sight. "I went on my recruiting trip in
December and it was 70 degrees — that was a
big kick right there. The combination of the
campus and the baseball program was the
best I'd seen. After visiting, I cancelled the
rest of my trips and said to myself, 'That's
where I'm going.'"
For Mussina, there were no regrets in
going to Stanford. He appreciated the help he

was given, and was grateful that for once he
was not the center of attention. Giving him a
taste of the spotlight helped prepare him for
the pressure of the majors, but didn't over
power him with it.
"Stanford has a great all-around athletic
program, so every single person out there has
to deal with the limelight. Even though Stan
ford has a very good baseball program, it is
not covered all that closely by the media,"
Mussina said.

'I thought I'd make a good
showing in the minors, and
maybe make the team in a
couple of years. I had no
intention of being called up
after 13 months.'

Something that separates Mussina from
many of his current teammates, even those
who attended college, is that he has complet
ed his college education. Although he left
Stanford after three years, being drafted
20th in the first round of the 1990 amateur
draft by the Orioles, he came back in the fall
to complete a degree in economics. There had
never been any doubt in his mind that he
would finish his education.
"That was the whole plan from day one," he
remarked. "I went to summer school, took an
extra class here and there, and by the time I
signed I needed only 12 more units to gradu
ate, and I went back last fall and finished up."

One of the saddest moments in an ath
lete's life is when they step off the field after
finishing their career, whether it be a glori
ous or unsuccessful one, and realize they are
not prepared for what lies ahead. By com
pleting his degree, Mussina is already one
step up on most of his peers.
Mussina's stay in the minor leagues was
short but sweet. In just over a year, he com
piled a 13-4 record with a 2.22 ERA.
Although he had been successful in college,
no one, including Mussina himself, could
have predicted how quickly he'd make it up
to the majors.
"I thought I'd make a good showing in the
minors, and maybe make the team in a cou
ple of years. I had no intention of being called
up after 13 months," he said.
Mussina was called up to the majors on July
31, and made his first start on August 4, pitch
ing well but losing to the Chicago White Sox, 1-
0. He recorded his first major league victory 10
days later, and throughout his two months in
the majors, has shown uncommon poise for a
first-year player. Although his record for his
rookie year was only 4-5, he had a 2.87 ERA
and impressed many scouts along the way with
his control and arsenal of pitches.
Magazines such as Baseball America have
featured him on their covers, predicting
future greatness for the 22-year-old. Howev
er, Mussina knows that life in the big leagues
won't be easy.
"Every level of advancement is like taking
the three best hitters from the previous level
and making nine of them in the line-up.
Right now, very team has their best nine
guys in the organization facing you, and it's a
pretty tall order to get them out every night,"
he said.
But so far, it has been the hitters who have
been walking back to their dugouts shaking
their heads while Mussina is mowing them
down with a calmness befitting a veteran.
