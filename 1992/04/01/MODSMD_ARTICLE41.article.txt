With exam week behind them, Stanford men's crew spent
Spring Break training and racing, but mostly preparing for
the challenging season that lies ahead. On Sunday, March 22,
the Cardinal faced UC-Santa Barbara in the first dual meet of
the year at the home race course at Redwood Shores.
The Stanford freshman and novice eights lost to the Gau
chos, while the junior varsity fours won by a convincing mar
gin of 15 seconds over the closest Santa Barbara entry. The
varsity eight race brought a solid victory for the Cardinal,
demonstrating that Stanford is ready to attack traditional
West-Coast leaders in the coming weeks.
After five more days of intense double-practices, the crews
lined up against Santa Clara University Saturday, March 28.
With a blustering headwind, the Cardinal won four of five

men's races. Highlighting the day was the spectacular sprint
by the combined JV/novice eight. Despite trailing by a few
seats through a majority of the race, Stanford confidently
raised its stroke rating in the final 250 meters to overtake
Santa Clara and win by two seconds.
Travelling to San Diego this weekend, the Cardinal rowers
will face traditional rivals Washington, California and UCLA,
as well as powerful eastern crews including Pennsylvania and
Harvard.
The San Diego Crew Classic is the first major competition
of the season, and the varsity looks primed to have one of the
best performances in years. The freshman squad hopes to
surprise the competitions in its first major match-up of the
year. Having completed an intense period of preparation,
Stanford crews are poised to attack, and bring the men's pro
gram to a new level of achievement in 1992.
