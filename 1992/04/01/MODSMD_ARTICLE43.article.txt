# Spikers looking ahead to next season

Don Shaw is an eager man.
As the Stanford women's volleyball team
begins practice again this quarter, coach Shaw
is finding a lot to look forward to in the 1992
Cardinal volleyball team. Familiar faces might
be moving on, but a crop of highly-touted new
comers will help to make Shaw's job interesting
as the squad takes on one of the most brutal
schedules in the nation next year.
Stanford landed four of the top five recruits
in the country this year, including 1991 Volley
ball Monthly National High School Player of
the Year Cary Wendell and the 1991
Mizuno/USA Today National High School Play
er of the Year Mamie Triefenbach.
Wendell, a 6-foot outside hitter from Arroyo
Grande, California, was named Team MVP,
League MVP, and County MVP in all four years
of high school, and has travelled to Canada, Brazil
and Japan with various elite teams. In Brazil she
played on the U.S. Junior World Cup Team.
She is also the first lefthander on the team,
giving her an added advantage because teams
have to restructure their defenses to block a
lefthanded-shot.
"Carrie has so many shots in her repetoire
already," Shaw said. "She has many skills that
some players don't have after four years of col
lege play .... She already has so much experi
ence from playing in Sportsfest."
Complementing Wendell will be Triefenbach,
a 6-foot-1 outside hitter from Belleville, Illinois.
She was Player of the Year for each of the past
two years, and First Team All-State in each of

the past three years. Last summer she was a
member of the U.S. Junior Olympic Team that
won a gold medal in Saskatchewan, Canada.
"Mamie is really physical," Shaw said. "She
is probably as good an athlete as we've ever
recruited. She has all the physical tools — the
jumping ability, the quickness."
Shaw expects these two players to make an
immediate impact upon the team.
"I see Carrie and Mamie in a very important
role just because of their experience," he said. "I
think that all four incoming frosh are going to
contribute quite a bit."
Indeed the other recruits are no slouches and
will be valuable assets for the Cardinal. Wendy
Hromdka, a 5-foot-11 outside hitter from Pacif
ic Palisades, California, and Maureen McLaren,
a 6-foot-1 middle-blocker from Costa Mesa, Cal
ifornia, will provide outstanding depth for the
team and both will be important parts of the
Cardinal squads of the future.
With the departure of seniors Kristin Klein,
Amy Cooper, and Nicole Appleman, all starters
last season, Shaw has many question marks
about the upcoming team's makeup. But he
seems to be looking forward to Stanford's new
look.
"When you take away three starters, you're
going to have new faces on the floor," Shaw
said. "The last two years have been sort of a
known quantity. Now it's time to step back and
rethink what we're going to do."
"You don't just replace a Kristin Klein,"
added assistant coach Denise Corlett.
The focal point of next year's team will be
returning senior Bev Oden. Oden, a three-time
first team Ail-American, is currently practicing

with the U.S. National team down in Los Ange
les, competing for one of 12 spots on the U.S.
Olympic team. Regardless of whether or not she
makes the team, Shaw feels that the experience
she gains will be invaluable.
"I expect her to come back a far better play
er," he said. "Practicing every day, four hours a
day with some of the top players in the world
will really help her and us .... We can't push
her enough here in practice to make her reach
her peak, but down there she'll hopefully find
out how good she can be."
With Oden as the only guaranteed starter,
Shaw plans to watch spring practices and go
from there.
"The main emphasis will be individual
improvement," he said. "This spring we'll see
who steps up and improves. It's up to the play
ers to show what they can do."
Another thing Shaw is relishing as next sea
son approaches is the strength of his schedule.
In the first ten games of 1992 the team plays
five opponents that will probably be ranked in
the top 10, including perennial powerhouses
Long Beach State, UOP, and, of course, UCLA
"We won't be favored in anything," Shaw
said. "UCLA will be the prohibitive favorite
next year. We'll be in their shadow all year
long."
Despite the new faces and difficult schedule,
the coaches are upbeat about next year.
"The combination of what we've got coming
back plus the new people — we'll be good," Cor
lett said.
"We'll be a little less physical, perhaps, but
more scrappy on defense I think," Shaw said.
"We're going to be fun to watch."
