sorority is one of 36 co-plaintiffs in a $5.7 million
class-action libel suit filed yesterday against NBC
and "Saturday Night Live" producer Lome
Michaels for recent "defamatory" skits using the
Tri-Delt name and letters.
The skits, which have aired three times in the
last month, depict several women wearing the Tri-
Delt letters, singing sorority songs and discussing
hair, makeup and upcoming dates.
"That skit demeans all our members," said Tri-
Delt national president Phoebe Steinman. "We are
so, angry."
Lawyers for NBC denied that the show had
defamed the sorority. "There was no misrepresen
tation whatsoever," said Michael Stern, one of sev
eral lawyers representing NBC. "They could try
getting a sense of humor."
Stern said that NBC has never been sued over
anything on "Saturday Night Live."
"Most people acknowledge the show is a paro
dy," he said. "No one has taken this stuff so seri
ously before."
In addition to the libel charge, the Tri-Delts are
claiming copyright infringement because the show
