# Montgomery quitting to take UNLV coaching job
## 
### Pat Kennedy Staff writer 
In a move that shocked the college bas
ketball world, Mike Montgomery announced
late last night that he will resign as head
coach of Stanford men's basketball and
accept the head coaching job at the Univer
sity of Nevada-Las Vegas, effective immedi
ately.
"It is definitely time for me to move on,"
said Montgomery, who will leave the Farm as
the third-winningest coach in school history.
"It makes sense for me, it makes sense for my

family and it makes sense financially."
Neither Montgomery nor Las Vegas off
icals would comment on the job's salary,
but one UNLV athletic booster said Mont
gomery would be paid about $700,000 a
year, plus bonuses.
While some outside observers had
expressed doubt that Montgomery would
return to Stanford after the graduation of
All-American Adam Keefe, the coach had
calmed many of these fears by declining an
appointment to the head coaching post at
Wisconsin early last week.
Stanford Athletic Director Ted Leland,

reached at his Menlo Park home last night,
said Montgomery's decision came as a huge
shock.
"Sure, we knew it was a possibility [that
he would leave]," said Leland. "But hell, we
were prepared to offer Mike just about any
thing to get him to stay here with us. What
could he have possibly seen in the UNLV pro
gram that we don't have here at Stanford?"
Montgomery didn't see it the same way.
"At Las Vegas, they have pride in their pro
gram," he said. "While Stanford might
draw 3,000 fans to our non-major confer
ence games, [UNLV] could get 20,000 to

come out to a game against Palo Alto High!"
Former Running Rebel coach Jerry
Tarkanian was forced to resign as head
coach of one of the most successful college
basketball programs in NCAA history (264-
41 over 10 years and the 1990 champi
onship) after repeated disputes with the
NCAA and, later, the UNLV administra
tion. However, he had nothing but praise
for his successor.
"Mike's a great guy and has run a quali
ty program over there at Stanford," said
