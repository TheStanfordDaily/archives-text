## Revealing remarks 
### 
Students can access the
comments of admissions
officers after new ruling

Behind the "bravo!" and
"Super!" on acceptance let
ters, admissions officers are
also making less complimentary
notations about the students in
each entering class.
And these students have a right
to read the comments, according to
a recent Department of Education
ruling. Despite potential draw
backs, such openness is a step in
the right direction.
Yes, releasing the records could
hamper the admissions process by
making evaluators reluctant to be
totally honest. But the idea of the
University having secret files on
students is distasteful enough to
outweigh this objection.
Admissions officers may have to
think twice about making negative
remarks when writing about appli
cants, but if the evaluation is fair and
non-discriminatory there should be
no problem with making it public.
The ruling was made in response
to a Harvard alumnus' effort to
examine the admissions practices
at his university, and The Daily has
joined the effort by having about
two dozen students — mostly staff
members — ask for their records.
The alumnus, Joshua Gerstein,
said part of his project is to detect bias
in the admissions process. Harvard
uses "summary sheets," like Stan
ford's "work cards," with comments
about students and summaries of
their teacher recommendations.
Dean of Admissions James
Montoya originally turned down
the requests. However, he is now
re-examing the legal issues
involved after learning of the deci
sion, which was based on the 1974
Federal Educational Records Pri
vacy Act. It is likely that the Uni
versity will have to comply with
the law.
Besides calming students' secret

fears that they were admitted acci
dentally, viewing admissions
records could have several benefits.
For example, the candid appraisal
of the student's strengths and
weaknesses can be used for self
evaluation and improvement.
Such feedback is rare at Stan
ford, and it could be positive as long
as students who look at their
records handle the information
responsibly, letting remarks feed
neither their egos nor their insecu
rities.
The Department of Educa
tion's ruling will also allow for a
more informed discussion about
the University's policies in admit
ting minorities, children of alum
ni, athletes and other groups.
Reading their records, students
could conceivably discover com
ments that shed light on biases in
the process.
Dean Montoya suggested this
week that future Stanford appli
cants may be asked to waive their
rights to the information. Another
possibility is that the office would
shred the comments before stu
dents enroll. But either of these
moves would eliminate a valuable
source of information.
If the comments are shredded,
both students and the University
will be the losers. According to
Montoya, the admissions officers
refer to the cards to get perspective
on the selection process and why
certain students are more success
ful during their years at Stanford.
Analyzing the comments and
the students' later record can only
help improve the admissions pro
cess.
It takes more than top SAT
scores and a stellar grade point
average to get into Stanford. Most
students have wondered at one time
or another what it is about them
that caught the University's eye.
The Department of Education
ruling will allow them to find out by
bringing formerly secret records for
ward into the sunlight. Hopefully,
this decision is only a first step in
encouraging openness in every area
of student life.
