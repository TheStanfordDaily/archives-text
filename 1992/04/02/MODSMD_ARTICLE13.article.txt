## Disintegrating schools 
### 
IN 1954, THE SUPREME COURT
ruled in Brown vs. Board of Educa
tion that "separate but equal" was a
myth: Segregated schools are inherently
unequal. Since that time, our country has
muddled through years of desegregation
efforts to build our public schools into a
foundation of multi-racial interaction
and understanding. Now, nearly forty
years later, how far have we come?
Having just read part of Pulitzer
Prize-winning writer Jonathan Kozol's
recent work, "Savage Inequalities," I'm
afraid the answer is "not very far." In
fact, Kozol argues only too forcefully that
in many cases, the schools that serve dis
advantaged black and Hispanic kids are
worse today than those of a hundred
years ago. A hundred years.
In chapter after chapter, Kozol exam
ines with unrelenting detail the neglect,
inequity and injustice meted out by this
country through the public school system.
In East St. Louis, for example, we
encounter Martin Luther King Jr. High
School, where in early spring of 1989 back
up sewage repeatedly flowed into the
kitchen, basement, parking lot and gym. At
East St. Louis High, the science labs have
no running water and too few outdated
books to supply each student in the class.
In Chicago, on Mondays and Fridays
in early May, nearly 18,000 children are
assigned to classes with no teacher. The
city's 50 percent dropout rate is essen

tially necessary for the school system to
function, because if even a fraction of the
200,000 dropouts showed up, there
would be no one to teach them.
In New York, elementary school P.S. 261
is shoe-horned into a former skating rink
and enrolls 1,300 kids when its maximum
capacity is 900. Though the ideal class size is
about 17 kids, they average an illegal 34 —
and often with multiple classes sharing a
subdivided space or cramped into closets.
In Camden, the 98 percent black and
Latino Pyne Point Junior High hasn't had
a functioning fire alarm in 20 years. In a
field adjacent to the school, contractors
come at night to secretly and illegally dump
their waste. A nearby suburban hospital
has even dumped hypodermic needles.
From typewriters to toilets and win
dows to walls, these inner city schools are
in a state of total decay, unable to main
tain their already minimal infrastructure
and certainly unable to provide decent
educations.
Perhaps this information wouldn't be
so alarming if it weren't for the fact that
within thirty minutes of each of these
communities are white suburbs that
often spend more than twice as much on
their children's educations. School fund
ing, which is based on local property
taxes, allows wealthy communities to
establish top-notch institutions for
already privileged kids while poor neigh
borhoods suffer the highest property

King Jr. High,

ing lot and gym.'

taxes in the nation to provide abysmal
education for impoverished children.
Lack of money is certainly not the only
factor undermining the success of these
schools, but until all schools are funded at
similar rates, let's not pretend that chil
dren in America have equal opportunity.
A real testament to these children is
that they even attend such degrading
facilities. "What impresses me is that
kids get up and come to school at all,"
noted one teacher. We Stanford students
are often congratulated on the individual
hard work that got us this far. No doubt
each of us did toil, but those of us who
had the benefit of decent educations
would have achieved far less if we also
had to battle our way through disinte
grating schools.
I guess I had almost come to believe
the stereotype that black kids just don't
care about school. It's true that some
don't, but the vast megority do, and for
them this society offers little more than
disrespect, indignity and confirmation of
the worthlessness of their lives. Today,
even the hollow justice of "separate but
equal" seems better than what we've got.

Perhaps this information wouldn't be
so alarming if it weren't for the fact that
within thirty minutes of each of these
communities are white suburbs that
often spend more than twice as much on
their children's educations. School fund
ing, which is based on local property
taxes, allows wealthy communities to
establish top-notch institutions for
already privileged kids while poor neigh

taxes in the nation to provide abysmal
education for impoverished children.
Lack of money is certainly not the only
factor undermining the success of these
schools, but until all schools are funded at
similar rates, let's not pretend that chil
dren in America have equal opportunity.
A real testament to these children is
that they even attend such degrading
facilities. "What impresses me is that
kids get up and come to school at all,"
noted one teacher. We Stanford students
are often congratulated on the individual
hard work that got us this far. No doubt
each of us did toil, but those of us who
had the benefit of decent educations
would have achieved far less if we also
had to battle our way through disinte
grating schools.
I guess I had almost come to believe
the stereotype that black kids just don't
care about school. It's true that some
don't, but the vast megority do, and for
them this society offers little more than
disrespect, indignity and confirmation of
the worthlessness of their lives. Today,
even the hollow justice of "separate but
equal" seems better than what we've got.
