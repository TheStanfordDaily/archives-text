I-Center working to help students with new rules

WE WOULD LIKE to thank The
Daily for highlighting some of
the recent changes in immigra
tion regulations that are adversely
affecting international students in the
United States. However, we would like
to clarify some of the comments made in
yesterday's editorial.
Until these new regulations were
approved, international students with F
-1 status could obtain permission to work
in either pre-completion or post-comple
tion practical training (regardless of it
being curricular practical training) and
also obtain off-campus work authoriza
tion due to changed economic circum
stances.
These opportunities were replaced by
this strange new off-campus pilot work
program and a continuation of post-com
pletion practical training. What seemed

generous turned out to be restrictive
when the regulation was introduced
requiring employers to recruit U.S. citi
zens for 60 day before hiring interna
tional students.
The programs being instituted by cer
tain departments at Stanford are NOT
circumventing immigration regulations;
rather, they are following immigration
regulations.
"Pre-curricular practical training" is
defined in detail in immigration regula
tions, and the I-Center is approving pre
curricular practical training only if these
provisions are met.
We have no intent of circumventing
INS regulations, since if there are any
problems it is the students who suffer.
However, Stanford, along with Ivy
League schools, MIT and the Big Ten,
are in correspondence with the Immigra

tion and Naturalization Service concern
ing just how restrictive these new regu
lations are.
Whether we will be successful in see
ing changes remains to be seen â€” there
seems to be some sign of positive
response from the INS in Washington.
Until then we are doing what we can,
through workshops, to acquaint stu
dents with the new regulations.
Your concern is very much appreciat
ed. Price Waterhouse did indeed provide
evidence that such off-campus work pro
gram did no harm to employment oppor
tunities for U.S. citizens. Other national
groups have also argued to the INS that
such restrictive regulations actually
harm the future economic growth of the
United States.
Where did this new off-campus pilot
work program come from? It originated

in the Northeast when McDonald's
Restaurant thought that their worker
shortage could be answered by a pro
gram that would allow McDonald's to
hire international students.
This program became the nation-wide
pilot program (which will be in operation
for three years) and has become known,
among foreign student advisers as Mc-
Work. What is interesting about this is
that in the period from Oct.l, 1991
(when these regulations went into effect)
until Feb. 28, 1992, there had only been
94 applications nationally to hire F-l
international students (out of a total
national F-l student population of
approximately 350,000). Not one had
been submitted by McDonald's.
