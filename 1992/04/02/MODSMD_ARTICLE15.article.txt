# Student warns about instance of dishonesty
## 
### 
Last quarter, I turned in an applica
tion to study overseas in the fall. When I
went to find out if I had been accepted, I
learned that my application had never
been reviewed.
I discovered that a woman had called
the Overseas Office claiming that she
was me. She gave my name, my phone
number and a phony ID number, and
then requested that my application be
withdrawn. Without the ID number
being verified, my application was
removed from the applicant pool.
I cannot believe that someone was so
malicious, competitive, manipulative and
•unethical as to violate the Honor Code
and to violate my personal life in this
manner. Regardless of my emotions and
the outcome of the later evaluation of
my application, an important point
needs to be addressed.

The reason this fraudulent action was
not detected immediately was because of
the trusting nature of Stanford. Many of
us are disillusioned when we believe that
simply because we are at such a presti
gious university, everybody is moral.
I have always been proud to say that
at Stanford, we are treated as individu
als, not as ID numbers. However, I now
believe that maybe we do need to be
treated as numbers to a certain extent.
I am not suggesting that the Univer
sity become an investigatory bureau, but
that all departments should consider
employing more routine procedures of
verification in any application process or
other situation which could invite such
dishonest and unethical behavior.
The Overseas Center is consequently
changing their application withdrawal pol
icy. I hope that everyone else will learn a
lesson from this and begin to realize that
although Stanford is a wonderful place in
many ways, not everyone can be trusted.
