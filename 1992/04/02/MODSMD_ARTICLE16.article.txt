# Flaws in ASSU cannot be corrected by recall
## 
### 
In his column Monday, Ari Richter
describes John Hall's suggestion of dis
tricting the campus by assigning victori
ous ASSU senators to be contacts for
small areas of campus. In general, the
idea is a good one, but Richter's sugges
tion to include a recall vote is flawed.
Having a recall implies that senators
are representatives of the students; if
they appear to disregard their "account
ability" to their constituency, then stu
dents can vote them out of office.
But since they don't really know what
students want, how could senators be
considered accountable representatives
of the entire student body?
This is where Hall's plan comes in.
"Senator X" acts as a representative of a
district, but only in a way that encourages
and facilitates student activity within the
ASSU. As the students learn about the

ASSU and its functions, the senator hears
the issues students are grumbling about.
But the minute Senator X begins to
vote as a representative of this con
stituency, Hall's program fails. Those
students did not necessarily vote for him
or her, and they will not be the only ones
voting for the senator next spring.
With a recall looming over his or her
head, a conflict of interest is unavoidable
for the senator.
Senators can't really represent a lim
ited constituency.
In Stanford's watered-down version
of a political system, the idea of repre
sentation is inapplicable. Indeed, one of
last year's campaign issues concerned
the normative idea of Stanford politi
cians focusing on every person.
By hearing, working with and involving
students, there won't even be time to
count recall votes, since the election com
mittee will be too busy counting the record
number of votes from the general election.
