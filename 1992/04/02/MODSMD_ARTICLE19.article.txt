## Volleymania! Weekend matchup huge 
### 
Don't watch the Indiana-Duke semifinal
game this Saturday night. Tape it instead. Don't
listen to any radio or watch any TV reports and
find out the score — you can watch it on VCR
later. Something even more exciting (more
thrilling than Final Four basketball? Yes.) will
be happening live here at Stanford, and you
won't be able to catch the highlights of this
match on the evening news.
The No. 1 Long Beach State 49ers are coming
to town to face our own No. 2 Stanford Cardinal
in men's volleyball this Saturday night in Burn
ham Pavilion at 7:30 p.m., and it will be one of the
most exciting sports events on campus this year.

Do you remember the Stanford-Long Beach
game from two years ago?
The end of that match ranked right with the
1990 Big Game and this year's Duke-Kentucky
game in exciting finishes. The teams traded
thunderous kills for four long games in front of
over 1000 screaming fans, with each squad tak
ing two games.
The fifth and final game was a rally-scoring
game, which meant every kill counted as a point,
side-outs included. The final game also had a
ceiling so that if neither team won by two at 15,
the first team to go to 17 would win.
Long Beach was up 14-11 with match-point
when the greatest comeback in recent volleyball
history began. The Cardinal got a side-out and a
point to bring the crowd to life. They went on a
mini-run to tie the game at 14 before the 49ers got
a side-out to get their second match point at 15-
14. The crowd was going bananas. Stanford came
back to get a match-point of its own at 16-15 until
Long Beach got the side-out and serve. 16 all.
Double match-point doesn't happen often in
volleyball. The tension was heavy in the air as
the 49ers served. This was a huge gut check —
whoever won this point would win the match
and probably the conference title. The pass
reached setter Parker Blackman and he sent it
outside to Bob Hillman. Hillman pounded the
ball. Long Beach dug it and the ball went up into
the air, waiting to be set.
Everyone in Burnham followed the ball's arc
as it rose, then fell harmlessly to the ground.
Long Beach didn't move and Stanford had
emerged victorious. The crowd poured out onto
the floor in exultation. If you've ever watched
your favorite team do the near- impossible, gain
ing a win by sheer heart and guts, you'd know
what the fans and players felt that night.
And you could feel it again this Saturday. The
No. 1 49ers, led by that same juggernaut Brent
Billiard, are coming to town looking to solidify
their hold on the top spot by beating No. 2 Stan
ford in its own lair.
It'll be live, and you could be part of the crowd.
The basketball game is on TV — you could tape it
and watch it later. This is a Stanford team, and
most of you probably picked Kansas to win it all
and have lost your money already anyway.
See you at 7 p.m. in Burnham.
