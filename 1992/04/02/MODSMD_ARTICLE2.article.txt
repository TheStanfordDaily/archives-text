# Stanford researchers gain in fight against muscular dystrophy

researchers may have achieved a
breakthrough in the use of cell
therapy to treat Duchenne mus
cular dystrophy and other dis
eases.
A Stanford research team has
shown that muscular dystrophy
patients injected with healthy,
immature muscle cells — called
myoblasts — began to produce the
muscle protein dystrophin, which
MD patients lack. The absence of
dystrophin causes muscles to
waste away, usually causing death
around the age of 20.
Pharmacology Prof. Helen
Blau, who headed the Stanford
team, said the process, called the
myoblast transfer, opens up new
possibilities in the field of cell
therapy, and offers a different
form of treatment for those suf
fering from growth hormone defi
ciency, hemophilia, cardiac dis
ease and even cancer.
Healthy cells were injected
with hopes that they would pro
duce the missing or defective pro
teins in individuals. After one
month of treatment, some of the

dystrophin-deflcient patients
began producing the missing pro
tein, according to a report that
appeared in today's edition of
Nature magazine.
"This may be a new form of
drug injection," Blau said at a
small press conference at the
Medical School yesterday. "With
gene therapy, we can engineer
cells within the body to be protein
factories and produce those pro
teins that are missing."
This process has the potential
to revolutionize treatment for
certain diseases. For instance,
instead of receiving blood transfu
sions, hemophiliacs would be able
to produce the missing clotting
agent whose absence causes them
to bleed incessantly.
Although initial results look
promising, researchers empha
sized that further testing will be
necessary before myoblast trans
fer could be an effective treatment.
While the procedure repre
sents a small step toward finding
a treatment for muscular dystro
phy, Blau said the results are
encouraging and "that gives one
energy to move on."
The use of myoblasts as a
means of supplying proteins is
considered a novel approach to
disease treatment. In the past, a
wide variety of cells — from skin
cells to liver cells — have been
used but presented problems.
The muscle cells also appear to
be quite resilient. According to
postdoctoral fellow Grace Pavlath,
who helped with the study, the
cells grow fast and can be placed in
cold storage and then successfully
revived.
Researchers then injected the
myoblasts into the legs of eight
boys afflicted with DMD. The
boys, ranging in age from six to
10, were injected with the healthy
muscle cells donated from a close
male relative.
After a month, muscle biopsies
indicated that transplanted cells
were producing dystrophin in
three of the boys.
