Men's ultimate:
Last weekend, at the April
Fools' Ultimate Tournament,
the Stanford Men's Ultimate
Team (SMUT) pulled off one
of the biggest upsets in ulti
mate Frisbee history.
The April Fools' tourna
ment featured 20 Open
(semi-professional) teams
plus six college teams, split
into two uneven divisions.
SMUT entered the upper
division, expecting to trade
victories for experience
against better teams.
After qualifying as the
last seed in Saturday's quar
terfinals, Stanford was pit
ted against undefeated L.A.
Iguana, who finished No. 3
in the nation last year.
At 12:47, on Field 4, sur
rounded by a huge crowd, LA
Iguana lost its first game of
the year â€” to Stanford.
After the Cardinal tied the
score 9-9, the two squads
traded points for the next
hour as the rest of the teams
gathered to witness the bat
tle. Iguana edged ahead, 15-
14, only to have SMUT race
back to take the lead at 16-15.
However, Iguana knotted
the score again, with the next
point to decide the winner.
Iguana pulled the disc deep
into the Stanford endzone,
leaving SMUT 70 yards
between them and their
prize. Rick Geyer delivered a
crossfield backhand to rook
ie Rick Olesek. Stanford had
won.
With its unprecedented
win, Stanford became the
first collegiate team ever to
advance to the semifinals.
