# Sophomore Slump?
## Hedgpeth sails into stellar second season 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
People always talk about the dreaded
Sophomore Slump. Apparently, no one
told Christy Hedgpeth.
The second year guard from
Thomasville, NC has been lighting it up
from long distance all season, shooting 50%
from the field and 40% from three-point
land. Hedgpeth's offensive firepower is a
major reason that the Cardinal will be mak
ing its third straight Final Four appearance.
"I think I have a different role this sea
son, a larger load to carry," said Hedgpeth.
"Last year, I was really very nervous out
there, but this year, I've played a lot of
minutes and feel very comfortable."
So comfortable, in fact, that she scorched
USC with five three-pointers en route to a
21 point performance in the NCAA West
Regional final at Seattle last Saturday.
"They played in a zone and they gam
bled," Hedgpeth said. "They collapsed on
Val (Whiting) because she hurt them
before with 37 and 35 points in our first
two games against them. The zone left me
and Molly (Goodenbour) with open shots,
and we shot a great percentage from three
and opened the defense up."
What bothers Hedgpeth, though, is
that many teams view her solely as a
shooter, and fail to recognize the other
aspects of her game.
"I think shooting is the strongest part of
my game, but I don't like being stereotyped
as just a shooter," she said. "I've worked on
my drive, my defense, and my rebounding.
"I have a lot of confidence in my three
point shot and in my shot in general, but I
also know that if my shot is not falling, I
can do other things to help us win."
Hedgpeth has reached the Final Four in
each of her first two seasons on the Farm.
She recognizes that she is fortunate to have
been a part of such a great achievement.
"Its something not many players have a

chance to do," said Hedgpeth. "Last year,
it was just great getting there, but this
year that just won't do.
"We took a week off after the semis last
year, and then we started conditioning for this
season. We don't want it (the conditioning) to
go to waste. It hurt a lot to lose in the semis
last year, but I'm not satisfied with just going
there and not winning the whole thing."
Hedgpeth has had a number of strong
performances this season. Among them
was her career-high 26-point output
against UCLA on the road, when she shot
an almost perfect nine-for-ten from the
field (including four-of-five threes), and
her personal favorite, the Cardinal's one
point victory over Tennessee early in the
season, when she chipped in 21.
"The Tennessee game was a measuring
stick for our team," she said. "The team
that has won that game the past three
years has gone on to win the national
championship. Hopefully, that will carry
through this year."
A GTE/Cosida Academic All-Regional
selection, Hedgpeth will have her hands full
Saturday against Virginia if the Cavaliers
decide to play man-to-man. A Virginia man
defense will have Hedgpeth working hard
against the defensive pressure of Dawn Sta
ley, who has been named national player of
the year by several publications.
"I'm going to have to protect the ball
when Staley is guarding me," Hedgpeth
commented. "She has great hands, great
foot quickness and her defense forces a lot
of turnovers."
Yet Hedgpeth and the Cardinal are
focused, and she feels that the Cardinal
have the ability to bring home another title.
"I just know we can win it," she said.
"We have intensity, confidence, and com
petitiveness. We have special team chem
istry, and we want to come back with it all."
With the leadership and a few more
three-pointers from jersey no. 25, they
just might.

season, when she chipped in 21.
"The Tennessee game was a measuring
stick for our team," she said. "The team
that has won that game the past three
years has gone on to win the national
championship. Hopefully, that will carry
through this year."
A GTE/Cosida Academic All-Regional
selection, Hedgpeth will have her hands full
Saturday against Virginia if the Cavaliers
decide to play man-to-man. A Virginia man
defense will have Hedgpeth working hard
against the defensive pressure of Dawn Sta
ley, who has been named national player of
the year by several publications.
"I'm going to have to protect the ball
when Staley is guarding me," Hedgpeth
commented. "She has great hands, great
foot quickness and her defense forces a lot
of turnovers."
Yet Hedgpeth and the Cardinal are
focused, and she feels that the Cardinal
have the ability to bring home another title.
"I just know we can win it," she said.
"We have intensity, confidence, and com
petitiveness. We have special team chem
istry, and we want to come back with it all."
With the leadership and a few more
three-pointers from jersey no. 25, they
just might.
