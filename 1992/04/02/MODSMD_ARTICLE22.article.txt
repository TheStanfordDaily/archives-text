# Synchro places second at Collegiate Nationals

For the sixth year in a row the
Stanford synchronized swimming
team returned home from the Colle
giate National Championships carry
ing the second-place trophy.
The only team that has been able to
beat Stanford since 1986 are the Ohio
State Buckeyes, one of the country's
several varsity teams. The University
of Richmond and the University of
Michigan, two of those varsity teams,
placed third and fourth respectively.
The Stanford club team, coached
by Andrew Maisel, Vickey Weir and
Karen Madsen, competed with six
swimmers, whereas other teams
including Ohio State, Richmond and
Penn State, each competed with at
least twenty swimmers.
"For Stanford to win we're going to
need more depth," said graduating
senior Melinda Downey. "We can win
as a club team because we have the tal
ent, but to do it, we need at least two

full teams of eight swimmers each."
Despite its lack of depth, the Stanford
team entered the maximum six routines,
with all six qualifying for finals. Downey
took second in the solo event behind Ari
zona State's Emily Porter, a member of
the United States National Team.
Downey teamed up with sopho
mores Georgia Bauman and Debbie
Downes to take third in the trio event.
Graduating seniors Michelle Ghert and
Rekha Rao, along with sophomore
Kristna Evans were fifth. Evans, Ghert
and Rao were sixth going into finals
but had a best-ever swim to pull them
ahead of one of the Richmond trios.
"It was extremely exciting for us to
move up in finals," said Ghert. "Espe
cially in such a political sport where
surprises like that don't often happen."
Stanford also took third and fifth in
the duet event, with Bauman and
Downes taking the bronze and Evans
and Ghert finishing fifth.
"Our duets looked great," said
Downey. "They were definitely our

best routines."
In the team event, where a maxi
mum of eight swimmers are allowed
to swim at once, Stanford's six
woman routine placed third, behind
Ohio State's two eight-woman squads.
"It was obvious in the team routines
that we (Ohio State and Stanford) have
very different swimming styles," said
Downey. "They're a'little sharper and
because they have eight swimmers
they can do more lifts and boosts."
A lift occurs when one or more swim
mer is lifted to stand on the level of the
surface of the water, or is boosted out
and above the water to perform a flip or
a dive. These maneuvers add an ele
ment of risk to the routines and, there
fore, earn points for level of difficulty.
In the compulsory 'A' figure event,
Downes and Downey both placed in
the top ten, while Evans and Ghert
finished in the top twenty. Rao had a
top ten placing in the 'B' figure event.
"We had a really good meet," said
Weir. "The caliber of the competition

has improved consistently over the past
several years and it's getting increasing
ly difficult to place routines in finals."
"Collegiately, synchronized swim
ming has improved tremendously," said
Downey. "Especially on the east coast
where more teams are getting varsity
status. They're getting more coaches,
more swimmers and more funding."
Despite the difficult competition,
four Stanford swimmers earned All-
American honors. Downey became a
four-time All-American, while Bau
man, Downes and Ghert earned their
second All-American honors.
With Downey, Ghert and Rao grad
uating in June, Stanford is hoping to
rebuild next year with a large incom
ing freshman group and the return of
freshman Jenny Curtis who could not
compete this year due to a shoulder
injury.
"The rivalry continues," said
Ghert. "One day Stanford will beat
Ohio State for the national champi
onship."
