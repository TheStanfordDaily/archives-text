## V'Ball's Bezmalinovic follows road less traveled 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
John Bezmalinovic, a senior middle blocker for
the Stanford men's volleyball team, brings a differ
ent vision both to his team and to life as a player and
student. With his flannel shirt and slightly philo
sophical style, Bezmalinovic seems more like Ernest
Hemingway's Nick Adams than a Stanford athlete.
Wary of interviews, he spoke carefully and began
not by talking about volleyball but about his aca
demics. Bezmalinovic is a history major and plans to
co-term next year. Because he was redshirted as a
freshman, he will be eligible to play next year as
well.
"Some of me wants to get out of here," Bezmali
novic acknowledged, but the intellectual growth and
the masters degree that come with it are something
he can't pass up. He speaks of his future and knows
that the chance to have another year in school may
not be there five years down the line.
After college, Bezmalinovic thinks about playing
volleyball in Japan or Europe. "If I did something
like that, I'd be doing it for the opportunities that
come along with it and not so much for the volley
ball," he said when thinking about playing overseas.
"My dream, though, is to retire early so I can
open up this burgers and beer place, a sort of intel
lectual hole in the wall. I could, you know, be a
lawyer or banker and make money until I could
afford to do something like that." He added that he
planned to go to Montana this summer to see the
sort of place where he could live out this dream.
Bezmalinovic's dreams typify the competitive
ness and patient understanding that characterize
him as a player. He began playing volleyball in ninth
grade in Fresno. Most of the best high school players
were from the Los Angeles area and he found him
self a little intimidated when he arrived at Stanford.
As he has grown up as a person, Bezmalinovic has
gained faith in himself as a player. "This is the year
I feel like I've improved the most, not so much in
skills but in confidence," he said, "this has been the
biggest addition to my game."
As a starter this year, Bezmalinovic has improved
his statistics dramatically. As of the most recent
tally, he is leading the conference in hitting percent
age and is fifth in blocks. As a middle blocker, his

main duty is to ensure that the outside hitter does
not face more than one blocker, but he gets some
chances to hit himself.
"It's kinda neat. I mean, I'm pretty proud of it,"
he said when speaking of his success on the court.
"But I'm not getting that many sets. I'm just cutting
down on my errors, taking care of my opportuni
ties." It is the results, his playing and the team's
winning, that please Bezmalinovic the most.
One of the biggest motivators for Bezmalinovic is
the drive to hold on to his job as starting middle
blocker. "I feel lucky", he says, "most of the guys on
our bench would be starting at other places." With
in the team, competition for playing time has driven
him to play better.
This competitiveness is especially poignant for
Bezmalinovic, who did not get his spot easily. "It's
capitalism at its finest," he says of the competition
on his own team, "and it's great for us. Anybody
could step in and play."
In addition to the team's competitiveness, Bez
malinovic cites the closeness of the team as a big rea
son for their success this year. "Being on the road
has really helped us. We all get along really well.".
Bezmalinovic and his teammates will face a stern
test this weekend, hosting Brigham Young on Fri
day and Long Beach State on Saturday. He is fairly
confident about the BYU match, but adds that "we
have something to prove" against Long Beach State.
The winner of the Long Beach State takes a big
step towards reaching the Final Four, and Bezmali
novic knows that. "Every time I think about it I get
sick to my stomach. It's a big deal. It's something
you spend so much time on."
As for his role on the team, Bezmalinovic under
stands that he is not going to go out and make twen
ty or thirty kills a match. "I have my small victories.
I try to get up early and freeze the other blocker, "
he laughs, "and besides, I get some of the best views
on the court. Sometimes I look over my shoulder and
Dave Goss is right there hitting an X, really shaban
gling it. That's a success for me."
Before leaving to get groceries for his Mirrielees
kitchen, John Bezmalinovic talked about his life at
Stanford. "I gotta do my own thing," he said. He is
doing his own thing, combining a unique blend of
athleticism and intellectualism to help his team to
one of its strongest seasons ever.
