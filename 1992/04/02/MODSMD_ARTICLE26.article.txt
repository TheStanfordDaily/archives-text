# Course guide back after 4 years
## Some say it's inconsistent, uncomprehensive 
### Andy Dworkin Katie Mauro Staff writers 
This quarter, Stanford stu
dents can use a resource besides
Courses and Degrees to help them
choose classes — the ASSU
Course Guide.
However, some students who
have used the guide said it is of
little value.
Sophomore John Vachtsevanos
said the guide was "pretty much
the same thing over and over
again. All the comments were the
same and there wasn't any specif
ic information for us to use."
Others complained that the
guide contains a fairly small num
ber of classes and is "inconsis
tent" in how it rates courses.
But Council of Presidents mem
ber Beth Morgan, who helped pro
duce the guide, said that if more
students would complete the evalu
ation forms distributed each quar
ter, more courses could be included
in future guides and its compre
hensiveness would improve.
Only about 20 percent of stu
dents filled out the bottom portion of
the University's evaluations forms,
which are earmarked for course
guide information, Morgan said.
The 48-page guide contains
information on course content as
well as student evaluations of 202
spring quarter classes and ratings
of 64 faculty members.
The ASSU used to fund the
publication through special fee
requests, but that funding was
voted down four years ago and the
guide hasn't been published since.
This year's guide was financed
by ASSU funds, but to secure
more permanent funding, future
guides may be sold instead of dis
tributed for free, Morgan said.
The guide is intended to give
students "an idea what a course is
like, without having to do exten
sive shopping," Morgan said.
"There are classes that start out
very easy, and in the fourth week

become very hard. People need to
know that."
The publication has affirmed
at least some students' choices.
"It really made me glad that I
was taking the classes that I am
going to take," said freshman
Marco Per la man. "Of course, I
already knew what classes I was
going to take" before reading the
guide, he said.
But some still felt the guide
was confusing.
"The ratings just didn't make
any sense," said freshman Gita
Sinha. "They needed to be more
consistent with what they were
trying to say. It just wasn't very
helpful for me."
Michelle Cox, a junior majoring
in engineering, said the guide did not
contain all the courses she is taking.
"I didn't really use the guide
since my engineering classes were
not in there, but looking through it
for other classes I noticed one
mgyor thing — it was inconsistent,"
Cox said. "I mean, for example, a
course would be given an overall
rating of excellent and then the
comments given for it would say
how horrible it was."
To get student input for the
guide — outside of the evaluations
included on the University forms —
Morgan said new forms were creat
ed and distributed to some of the
four-class and upperclass dorms on
campus, such as Florence Moore
Hall.
Morgan said the evaluation forms
may be changed to make them
"more numerical" in the future.
Faculty members were also
asked for information about their
courses for the guide. About 400
faculty members were sent forms
asking them about the content,
requirements and grading proce
dures of their courses. Of those,
about 160 returned usable infor
mation, she said.
Sebastian Kuhn, a physics profes
sor whose electricity and magnetism
course received an overall rating of 3
out of a maximum 5 points, said he

was asked for information about the
content of his class.
But he said the information
requested was similar to that
already found in Courses and
Degrees. Kuhn said he had not
seen the course guide and so could
not comment on its content.
Not all of the professors rated in
the faculty section of the course
guide were contacted for informa
tion. Drama Prof. Rush Rehm, who
received a rating of 2, said he did not
ever remember being contacted and
has not seen the guide.
This year, the guide was spon
sored by the COP and the ASSU
Senate, and funding for the guide
was taken from the ASSU's Annu
al Discretionary Reserve fund and
from unused funds marked for the
guide in the past, Morgan said.
The guide cost about $8,500, she
said, and 5,500 copies were printed.
Most of the copies were distributed
to undergraduate residences on
campus, but some copies are still
available at the ASSU office.
In the future, Morgan said the
guide might appear either annual
ly or quarterly, and would be
funded either through sales of the
guide or advertising. Neither deci
sion has been made.
