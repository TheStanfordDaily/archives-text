## THE
						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY. San Francisco's gay night life flourishes

SATURDAY NIGHT IN PALO ALTO COULD never
measure up. All our nonfat-milk cappuccinos at cafes
that close by ten and our handful of bars and teenage
dance clubs are cow-tipping compared to the enter
tainment that San Francisco's gay scene has to offer.
And you don't have to be gay to have fun there.
In addition to all the well-established bars, gay
night life is expanding to include cafes, cabaret-style
entertainment, and, slowly, places that cater espe
cially to women.
At Cafe Flore, a coffee house on Noe and Market
Streets where people of all sexes sip pricey espresso,
"T-Bone," a 33-year-old travel coordinator, summed
up the scene Saturday. "There's so much night life in

this city," he said, "but it comes with a different atti
tude."
It's a different attitude from the '70s, which he
described as "a period of overindulgence" following
the gay-rights movement. "I think gay society has
matured" since then, he said. Cafes and other low
key social spots are "a growing part of the night life"
in this AIDS-conscious decade.
Not all the changes in gay night life stem from
AIDS. T-Bone remarked that "people aren't drink
ing" these days because the community is less "bat
tered by society" than it used to be.
Gay society is also becoming more cohesive. "In
the early days, gay men and gay women were sepa
rate," T-Bone said. "Now you're seeing a merging of
the sexes."
This merging is evident at Cafe San Marcos, a les
bian bar across the street from Cafe Flore. It's a live
ly place full Of women — feminine and butch, talk
ing, drinking, shooting pool. What a feeling to be in a
bar where there are no drunken men leering at you.
But there are men at San Marcos, mostly with
women friends or with other gay men. A group of
men who'd met each other through a computer dat
ing service chose San Marcos for their rendezvous
Saturday night because of the bar's "non-threaten
ing atmosphere," as one of the men described it, and
for convenience.
"It's easy to spot a group of tittering queens in a
bar full of lesbians," he joked, adding quickly that he
and his companions "don't take ourselves too seri
ously."
At least a few of the women at San Marcos weren't
