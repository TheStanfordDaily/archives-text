## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY. San Francisco's gay night life flourishes

SATURDAY NIGHT IN PALO ALTO COULD never
measure up. All our nonfat-milk cappuccinos at cafes
that close by ten and our handful of bars and teenage
dance clubs are cow-tipping compared to the enter
tainment that San Francisco's gay scene has to offer.
And you don't have to be gay to have fun there.
In addition to all the well-established bars, gay
night life is expanding to include cafes, cabaret-style
entertainment, and, slowly, places that cater espe
cially to women.
At Cafe Flore, a coffee house on Noe and Market
Streets where people of all sexes sip pricey espresso,
"T-Bone," a 33-year-old travel coordinator, summed
up the scene Saturday. "There's so much night life in

this city," he said, "but it comes with a different atti
tude."
It's a different attitude from the '70s, which he
described as "a period of overindulgence" following
the gay-rights movement. "I think gay society has
matured" since then, he said. Cafes and other low
key social spots are "a growing part of the night life"
in this AIDS-conscious decade.
Not all the changes in gay night life stem from
AIDS. T-Bone remarked that "people aren't drink
ing" these days because the community is less "bat
tered by society" than it used to be.
Gay society is also becoming more cohesive. "In
the early days, gay men and gay women were sepa
rate," T-Bone said. "Now you're seeing a merging of
the sexes."
This merging is evident at Cafe San Marcos, a les
bian bar across the street from Cafe Flore. It's a live
ly place full Of women — feminine and butch, talk
ing, drinking, shooting pool. What a feeling to be in a
bar where there are no drunken men leering at you.
But there are men at San Marcos, mostly with
women friends or with other gay men. A group of
men who'd met each other through a computer dat
ing service chose San Marcos for their rendezvous
Saturday night because of the bar's "non-threaten
ing atmosphere," as one of the men described it, and
for convenience.
"It's easy to spot a group of tittering queens in a
bar full of lesbians," he joked, adding quickly that he
and his companions "don't take ourselves too seri
ously."
At least a few of the women at San Marcos weren't

satisfied with the lesbian bar
scene. Lesley, a 33-year-old chef,
called the night life available to
women "boring."
"Women's bars are dark —
there's no atmosphere," she said.
She'd like to see more "cabaret
type things with dining and
music" for women. She also
pointed out that women's night
clubs are often one-night-a-week
events at men's clubs and "have
no space" of their own.
The Girlspot (G-spot for
short) is one of these women's
clubs. It happens Saturdays at
the Endup, a men's club on 6th
Street with a good dance floor
and a big terrace in the back.
Mary, a 28-year-old student
counselor who was at the G-spot
last week, said that although she
is generally happy with the les
bian scene in San Francisco, she
too wishes there were a place espe
cially for women. "There's no
place just to go and hang out.
There's just so many men's
clubs."
Besides the general frustra
tion among lesbians about lack of
a women's space, Mary pointed
out that it's hard to meet people
in bars and clubs. "Women have a
lot of attitude. . . . They're stuck
up. I come here to dance with my
friends, and if you meet people,
you meet people," she said.
Meeting people is a similar
problem for men. At the Stud on
9th Street, a boxy drinks-and

dance place which T-Bone calls a
"boy bar," Brian, a 24-year-old
UC-Berkeley undergraduate,
remarked that it's hard to really
talk to someone in a club. "You're
not exactly gonna have a soul-to
soul conversation (in a place)
where people judge you by your
looks."

"You come out, you do everything, and
then when you've done everything you
think, 'What's next?' "

He added that the night life
gets "tired" after a while. "You
come out, you do everything, and
then when you've done every
thing you think, 'What's next?' "
Lately he prefers places like Cafe
Flore, which he says has "good
cheesecake, overpriced cappucci
no and a good view."
But some people do just fine in
the bar scene. Bret, a 31-year-old
artist who works in retail, said,
"I've met most of my closest
friends in clubs."
"Boy bar" or not, Saturday the
Stud was full of all kinds of guys,
ranging from 20-year-olds to men
in their 40s. There were no other
woman when I was there, but
people were friendly and didn't
seem to notice.
College students tend to go to
Oldies Night on Wednesday.
Anton, 30, who works at a mort

gage company, characterized the
Stud crowd as "more suburban.
The Colossus (a dance club on
Folsom Street) is more the San
Francisco crowd."
Lloyd, a 42-year-old physician,
is philosophical about the scene.
"Night life might be shallow, but
you can get past the superficial

attitudes." He added, "It's just
like San Francisco. If you know
the city, you know where to go."
Why should straight Stanford
students venture into this
unknown territory? Because San
Francisco's gay scene offers a lot
of high-quality entertainment
among interesting, cosmopolitan
people.
Women's clubs, especially,
provide a welcome change from
the usual male-dominated bar
scene: they are above all else
comfortable places where women
can get together for a drink.
And you can be yourself no
matter who you are. As one
straight woman at the G-spot
commented, "You don't feel like
people are judging you."
