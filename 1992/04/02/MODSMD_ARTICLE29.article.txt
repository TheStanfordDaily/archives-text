Nowhere man Will Nulpart goes to class, pukes, tokes up and stalks home
through the wasteland of a late-night campus. Isn't he a bit like you and me?

Editor's note: This is the first
installment of a four-part short
story that will be appearing in
Intermission.

My name is Will Nulpart, and I'm
just an average guy. I eat most foods,
listen to any kind of music and am not
allergic to any medications. I do, how
ever, have occasional spells, nausea
and existential bouts.
I was in my composition class sit
ting at the back of the classroom like I
usually do, dozing off, when my body
spazzed. I sat straight up, thinking
maybe somebody was watching me,
but nobody was.
I could hear the perfect students in
the front row scribbling down every
word, pause and bodily noise that
Herr Professor von Nein made. They
wanted him to see how well groomed,
alert and enthusiastic they were to be
learning, how organized their note
books were with neatly-written head
ings for each subject, how well they
took notes in outline form and in dif
ferent colors to make them easy to
read, easy to understand.
I felt a migraine coming on. They
sat before him despite his shabby,
ashen suit, black bow tie, black, heavy
horn-rimmed glasses, bald head with
but a few white hairs on the sides, yel
low-green teeth and froth on the cor
ners of his mouth breathing out
decay.

Juices welled up in the back of my
mouth as Herr Professor von Nein
explained how to attack the critical
analysis paper that was due a week
later.
"Mind you, although I am perfectly
cognizant of your fallacious and fee
ble-minded attempts at writing, I
shall have no merty! Remember: the
sis, anti-thesis, synthesis. Composi
tion, like every other science, is rigor
ous in its objectivity. It has a struc
ture to which you must conform and
rules to which you must oblige. There
can be no meaning if there is no rea
soning. And believe me, I do not care
about the way you feel but only about
the way you reason!"
He slammed his tremulous, vari
cose-infested hand onto the podium,
causing him to cough loudly and
adding a little rouge to his livid com
plexion. Even in the pale yellow class
room lighting, you could see the
greasy sweat on his forehead and the
froth mounting up in the corners of
his mouth. The dictum must have
made the first row jizz, but my only
bodily reaction was to puke on myself
before I could even get up.
Later that week I was trying to

work on the paper when my two good
friends Petronius Darwin and Fellini
Lucciano Dilecto tempted me into
going to a favorite haunt of ours, Mag
ical Tofu Mountain. It was the only
dorm which partied throughout the
week but kept the Sabbath holy, and
even then there were exceptions. They
always had a good earthy band play
ing, a couple of kegs lying around and
a copious supply of varied goodies for
the hard-core.
We liked to sit in a corner couch
watching other people trip and dance,
and we would exchange pleasantries.
That night's rot started with my ask
ing Petronius what he was going to do
with the rest of his life.
He pushed up his round glasses
with his bony finger and said, "Law
school."
"But I thought you hated school," I
said.
"I do. It's just another form of
domestication that humans have
imposed on themselves to distinguish
themselves from lower life forms."
"What are you going to do after law
school?"
"Fame, fortune and women."
"And then what?"
"What do you mean, and then
what? I'll live happily ever after of
course," he said.
Fellini was playing with his curly
hair, no doubt listening with interest.
"You know what I'm going to do with
the rest of my life?" he interjected,

squinting his already beady eyes.
"I'm going to smoke it!"
I was feeling good for the
moment, but only for a moment.
(Temporality: nothing lasts forev

er, especially a euphoric state of
being.) Coming down was worse
than sobriety, but sometimes that
brief euphoria, that defiance of
gravity, was worth it.
At first I thought I could hear
individual conversations, but
then they all jumbled together to
form some alien tongue, and faces
started to blur. I could feel a

thunderstorm brewing in my
head. The more I looked at people
around me, the more I taxono
mized them down to their bodily
functions — eating, walking,
sleeping, propagating, defecating
— which would one day cease.
I stumbled back to my apart
ment without Petronius and
Fellini. On the way, I passed by

classroom buildings, carcasses at
night; and dorms, absurd con
fines for the packing of pathetic
souls — a veritable purgatory.
I wondered how many other
souls had passed through these
buildings and left imprinted in the
air a laugh, a moan, a cry, a trace of
their meager existence. It was late,
but some lights were still on in the
dorms, and it made me think of the
perfect students all night. Whereas
I would wait until one or two hours
before class to do my paper.

sleeping, propagating, defecating
— which would one day cease.
I stumbled back to my apart
ment without Petronius and
Fellini. On the way, I passed by

classroom buildings, carcasses at
night; and dorms, absurd con
fines for the packing of pathetic
souls — a veritable purgatory.
I wondered how many other
souls had passed through these
buildings and left imprinted in the
air a laugh, a moan, a cry, a trace of
their meager existence. It was late,
but some lights were still on in the
dorms, and it made me think of the
perfect students all night. Whereas
I would wait until one or two hours
before class to do my paper.
Nowhere man Will Nulpart goes to class, pukes, tokes up and stalks home
through the wasteland of a late-night campus. Isn't he a bit like you and me?

Editor's note: This is the first
installment of a four-part short
story that will be appearing in
Intermission.

My name is Will Nulpart, and I'm
just an average guy. I eat most foods,
listen to any kind of music and am not
allergic to any medications. I do, how
ever, have occasional spells, nausea
and existential bouts.
I was in my composition class sit
ting at the back of the classroom like I
usually do, dozing off, when my body
spazzed. I sat straight up, thinking
maybe somebody was watching me,
but nobody was.
I could hear the perfect students in
the front row scribbling down every
word, pause and bodily noise that
Herr Professor von Nein made. They
wanted him to see how well groomed,
alert and enthusiastic they were to be
learning, how organized their note
books were with neatly-written head
ings for each subject, how well they
took notes in outline form and in dif
ferent colors to make them easy to
read, easy to understand.
I felt a migraine coming on. They
sat before him despite his shabby,
ashen suit, black bow tie, black, heavy
horn-rimmed glasses, bald head with
but a few white hairs on the sides, yel
low-green teeth and froth on the cor
ners of his mouth breathing out
decay.

Juices welled up in the back of my
mouth as Herr Professor von Nein
explained how to attack the critical
analysis paper that was due a week
later.
"Mind you, although I am perfectly
cognizant of your fallacious and fee
ble-minded attempts at writing, I
shall have no merty! Remember: the
sis, anti-thesis, synthesis. Composi
tion, like every other science, is rigor
ous in its objectivity. It has a struc
ture to which you must conform and
rules to which you must oblige. There
can be no meaning if there is no rea
soning. And believe me, I do not care
about the way you feel but only about
the way you reason!"
He slammed his tremulous, vari
cose-infested hand onto the podium,
causing him to cough loudly and
adding a little rouge to his livid com
plexion. Even in the pale yellow class
room lighting, you could see the
greasy sweat on his forehead and the
froth mounting up in the corners of
his mouth. The dictum must have
made the first row jizz, but my only
bodily reaction was to puke on myself
before I could even get up.
Later that week I was trying to

work on the paper when my two good
friends Petronius Darwin and Fellini
Lucciano Dilecto tempted me into
going to a favorite haunt of ours, Mag
ical Tofu Mountain. It was the only
dorm which partied throughout the
week but kept the Sabbath holy, and
even then there were exceptions. They
always had a good earthy band play
ing, a couple of kegs lying around and
a copious supply of varied goodies for
the hard-core.
We liked to sit in a corner couch
watching other people trip and dance,
and we would exchange pleasantries.
That night's rot started with my ask
ing Petronius what he was going to do
with the rest of his life.
He pushed up his round glasses
with his bony finger and said, "Law
school."
"But I thought you hated school," I
said.
"I do. It's just another form of
domestication that humans have
imposed on themselves to distinguish
themselves from lower life forms."
"What are you going to do after law
school?"
"Fame, fortune and women."
"And then what?"
"What do you mean, and then
what? I'll live happily ever after of
course," he said.
Fellini was playing with his curly
hair, no doubt listening with interest.
"You know what I'm going to do with
the rest of my life?" he interjected,

squinting his already beady eyes.
"I'm going to smoke it!"
I was feeling good for the
moment, but only for a moment.
(Temporality: nothing lasts forev

er, especially a euphoric state of
being.) Coming down was worse
than sobriety, but sometimes that
brief euphoria, that defiance of
gravity, was worth it.
At first I thought I could hear
individual conversations, but
then they all jumbled together to
form some alien tongue, and faces
started to blur. I could feel a

thunderstorm brewing in my
head. The more I looked at people
around me, the more I taxono
mized them down to their bodily
functions — eating, walking,
sleeping, propagating, defecating
— which would one day cease.
