# Profs, criticize Bookstore
## 'Real scandal' must be looked into, some argue 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The most recent revelations about the Stanford
Bookstore have shocked many members of the Fac
ulty Senate, and yesterday some were calling for the
senate to conduct a separate review.
"This is the first real scandal we have had," said
History Prof. Paul Seaver. "Compared to the cost
recovery (controversy), which was largely inadver
tent, these characters were acting like buccaneers."
The Daily revealed Tuesday that the Bookstore
lost close to $2 million in the stock market last year.
In early February, The Daily disclosed a host of
perquisites that top management of the Bookstore
enjoy, including the free use of a vacation home,
motor home, sailboat and luxury automobiles.
The Bookstore's board of directors has already
begun an internal review of the nonprofit corpora
tion's business practices, and the California Attor
ney General has also opened a formal investigation.
But some faculty contacted yesterday suggested the
senate should look into the matter on its own.
"I am surprised that there has not been any seri
ous discussion in the senate," said Anthropology Prof.
Renato Rosaldo. "As more comes to the surface, I
think there will be a call for more general discussion.
"Maybe a special senate committee should be
formed to figure out more of what is going on," Ros
aldo added.
Chemistry Prof. James Collman said he, too, was
surprised the Bookstore was not discussed because it
"looks like something out of control. ... It certainly
has to be looked into."
At the same time, however, senate members recog
nize that because the Bookstore is run independent
ly of the University, there is little the senate can do.
"It does not appear to fall within the purview of
the senate," said English Prof. Ronald Rebholz. "In
this instance, the senate is impotent."
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg, a member of the sen
ate as well as the appointed spokesperson for the
Bookstore's board, said a senate discussion "would
not be constructive until the [internal investigative]

report is completed in a few weeks."
Weisberg said the Bookstore's own inquiry makes
a separate senate investigation unnecessary.
"Nothing constructive could be served at this
point by another layer of review," he said. "This pro
cess has been an exhaustive review .. . and not a
financial or operational stone has been left unturned.
"I am perfectly prepared to tell the senate what is
already out there . . . and open to entertain any
questions," Weisberg added.
The senate's first meeting of the quarter is this
afternoon.
Rebholz said that after the internal investigative
report is released, the senate might be "a good forum
in which to discuss it. . . . But I don't think much
