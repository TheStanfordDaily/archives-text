# Battered hymns of the republic
## Capitol Steps' satire marches on 
### Victor Haseman Staff writer 
What does the popular
Walt Disney tune "When
You Wish Upon a Star" have
in common with presiden
tial hopeful Bill Clinton?
Absolutely nothing, unless
you're a member of Capitol
Steps, the popular political
satire troupe from Washing
ton D.C.
While it's doubtful Dis
ney would approve of the
modified Clinton tune
"When They're Fishing in
the Star," the surgeon gen
eral has yet to declare the
group hazardous to govern
ment health. Hence, Capitol
Steps' Saturday night show
at Memorial Auditorium
shouldn't have many casual
ties.
Founded in 1981, the
troupe's origin is rather
infamous. As the legend
goes, staffers for Senator
Charles Percy were asked to
arrange entertainment for
the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee's Christ
mas party.
Co-founders Elaina New
port and Bill Strauss, along
with four other Percy
staffers, attempted to stage
a nativity play, but had trou
ble locating three wise men
and a virgin in Congress.
Their initial plan spoiled,
the would-be entertainers
opted for political satire.
The result was the comical
storming of the "Hill."
The 15-member troupe is

comprised of current and for
mer Congressional staffers,
giving it an amateur flavor
that is no doubt refreshing to
many fans.
Despite this, you've real
ly got to wonder about a
group that turns to the
morning paper to check out
what rhymes as opposed to
what happened.
In 1985, Strauss told the

Capitol Steps, brought to Stan
ford by Lively Arts, will perform
Saturday at 8 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium. Tickets range from
$13-$l9 for students; call 723-
2551 for more information.

Washington Post that all he
could think about when
Yuri Andropov died was
"Oh, no! There goes the
Grenada song." Further
more, he really hoped that
Konstantin Chernenko would
ascend to Soviet leadership.
"Chernenko could have
been a madman, but it
rhymed
Nonetheless, Capitol
Steps only make political
satire look easy â€” in the
midst of already busy sched
ules, Newport and Strauss
piece together musical paro
dies via fax. It's not surpris
ing that the mtyority of pro
ducer Newport's arrange

ments are set to current pop
songs. Still, they're seldom
short of things to parody.
Stanford Lively Arts
expects six members of the
group at the performance,
which may include such
arrangements as "Stan by
Your Klan (starring the
troupe's own David Duke),"
"The Tsounds of Tsongas"
and "If I Weren't A Rich

Man" by the troupe's ver
sion of George Bush.
But don't get your hopes
up too high. The troupe's
performance will probably
hang some of Stanford's
soiled laundry out to dry,
especially since they
requested a list of Stanford
scandals while preparing for
the event.
Capitol Steps promises to
be an unpredictable night of
fun and frolic regardless of
what the troupe decides to
parody. If nothing else, go to
find out what made Presi
dent Bush comment, "Golly,
the Capitol Steps are really
neat."
