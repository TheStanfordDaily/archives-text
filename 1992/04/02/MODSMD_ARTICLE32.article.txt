# Budding brokers barter superhero cards

### Sean Etigson Staff writer 
Huddled in the dark corners of Escondido
Elementary, they barter like haggard stock
brokers.
"The Hulk beats the pants off that guy,"
one third-grader barks. "He's stronger, high
er speed. He's got better endurance, and
besides, he can be green or grey."
In the past months, collectors of comic
cards have come out of the woodwork, toting
their well-organized binders around with
them like briefcases.
"I've been collecting for about the last
year," said second-grader Ryan Jones. "I have
over three hundred of 'em."
The concept of sticking a comic book char
acter on a card has been around since the
19405, with Superman and Batman memora
bilia. It's only in the last three years, howev
er, that the cards put out by Marvel Comics
and DC Comics have received the same kind
of attention as baseball and football cards.
Terri Callejo, an employee at Comics and
Comix, Inc. on California Ave., traced the
popularity of the cards to a few simple princi
ples.
"They're nice visuals," Callejo said, "and
they're cheap."
Marvel, in particular, caters to the needs of
many young people by providing "power rat
ings" for each of the characters. These rat
ings appear in bar-graph form on the back of
the cards and measure strength, speed, agili
ty, stamina, durability and intelligence.
Richard Garcia, manager of Comics and

Comix, Inc., said, "A lot of the kids are inter
ested in how strong characters are — and so
are a lot of adults, actually."
"As far back as I can remember," Garcia
said, "there's always been an argument about
who's stronger or faster or whatever." Now
children and their parents can compare and
use the statistics.
Kindergartner Reid Sayer understands the

cosmic proportions of the power ratings.
"Adam Warlock is the best card," Sayer
said, "because he has the Infinity Gauntlet.
That gives infinite power over the world. The
universe, too. And all the planets."
Aside from these galactic concerns, Sayer
said he collects the Marvel series because, "I
just think it's neat, and I like to trade cards
with the older kids on the bus."
From her perch behind the cash register,
Callejo said, "It's funny, but the kids don't
seem as interested in the comic books as they
do in the trading cards."
The human bond definitely makes the dif
ference to many of the children because it
provides an activity that they can share with
their friends, their parents and other adults.
Both Callejo and Garcia said that many of
the comic card customers are adults. Garcia
explained that many adults like to see what
their favorite characters look like with new
graphics.
Callejo said she has observes a difference
in the respective collecting styles of children
and adults.
"The kids are collecting these cards with
out the idea of making a buck. They're just
turned on by the graphics."
Perhaps the corporate world looms in the
future for some of the students at Escondido
Elementary, but for the time being, it's still a
game to play with a three-ring binder.
Jones admitted, "I like to collect 'em
because they're valuable, but also because it's
fun and lots of my friends do. I'd probably
still collect them even if they weren't worth
too much."
