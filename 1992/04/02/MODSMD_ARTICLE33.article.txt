# Living, giving and slaughterhouse-fiving
## 
### 
I've always tried to be sympathetic to the
feminist cause. After all, it's in my blood —
one of my parents is female. The other's
Irish. I'm not sure what that makes me.
Yes, I owe a lot to dear old Ma Harris. She
guided me through the simple, easy days of
childhood, before I knew all the hassles of col
lege life. Days when overdrawing simply meant
I got a little periwinkle on the kitchen table.
When the closest thing to pre-med was waiting
my turn to play Operation, that wacky doctor's
game from Milton Bradley (It takes a steady
hand. . . Zzt! "Buttuhtinguhs!"). When my
closest encounter with drugs was Doobie Bee,
my only care in the world was "What if it rains
on Ernie's Tweedlebugs again?" and life's great
est mystery was how in Sam Hill that Playskool
barn mooed every time I opened the door.
And when I needed to mature, give up
childhood, she gave me that extra push. She
supported me when I realized that Dynamite
magazine just wasn't as cool as it used to be.
She donated my Suckerman and Stretch
Armstrong dolls to Goodwill. She threw out
my baseball cards. All of them. Every single
one.
OK, so she grew up in West Virginia.
Points off for that. And she's as overprotec
tive as Gollem was with that ring — "My
preeciousss ..." she calls me late at night.
And this age thing is starting to creep up
around the edges. She's still Mom, so I fig
ured I'd make the big effort, go all out for her
and ... give her a call.
"Hey, Mom?"
"Dav-Jo-Jen .. . who are you?" Her mind
ran through her list of children until she found
a name that fit: "Christopher Michael Harris,
ah'm gonna wear yeooh out! You nehver call
me! Well, tell me what's been going on, and
don't say 'Nothing.' "
"N'much."
"Oh, pooh. Now where did you go for Spring
Break? I hope you didn't go to, oh, what's it
cawlled? Fort Lawderdale or anywhere."
"Mom, that's in Florida."
"Well, good. You just stay away from that
place."
"Yes'm. We went to Las Vegas."
"Ohmygawd. Are you OK? (Ray! Christo
pher says he went to Las Vegas!) You didn't.. .
gamble, did you?"
"No, Mom. We went for the cultural
enlightenment. You know: Wayne Newton,
Rich Little, Jerry Lewis ..."
"Well, good. You just stay away from that

place. It's dirty. Now what else?"
"Nothing. Went to Death Valley."
"(Gasp!) For heaven sakes! Christopher
Michael Harris, ah'm gonna wear yeooh out!
You know I don't want you going to places like
that. You just stay away from that place. Now
who all went?"
"Just a bunch of us."
"Did any girls go?"
"Some."
"Are you, um, seeing someone, you know,
steady now? What's her name? Do you like
her? Where's she from? Is she a senior? Does
she have a job yet? Do you have a job yet? What
are you doing with your life anyway?"
"Not really, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, no
and I don't know."
"Oh, fiddlesticks. You never tell me any
thing. So what else is going on at Stanford?"
"Nothing."
(Long silence as she tries to sweat informa
tion out of me.) "Actually we, uh, found out
who our commencement speaker is."
"Oh goody, who is it?"
"Um .. . (mumble mumble) kirk varnedoe
(mumble)."
"Kurt Vonnegut ? Ooooh, I love Kurt Von
negut! He's witty, yet thought provoking, and
a bit anti-establishment. And very well known.
Just what a graduation speaker should be."
"Uh .. . Mom? He's a museum curator."
"He certainly is an amusing character. I
can't wait to hear Kurt Vonnegut speak. (Ray?
Ray? Guess what. Kurt Vonnegut is going to
speak at Christopher's graduation!) Oh, your
father's so proud! He says Catch-22 is one of
his favorite books, you know."
"Oh, we also got a new President." I went
on to tell her all about Casper the friendly
Provost. She asked how it felt dealing with a
54-year old Hamburger. The usual Food Ser
vice jokes followed.
"So, he's a German, is he? Do you know

what he was doing during the war? You don't
want an incident like that Ivan Boesky."
"Uh, you mean Kurt Waldheim, Mom. I
think we're safe. Even if Casper would have
been able to read the words back then, he prob
ably didn't even know what a national socialist
was."
"I'm not talking about socialists, Christo
pher. I'm talking about... (low whisper) N-a
_1 _ H
Z-l-8.
"Sorry. My mistake. Anyway ..."
"What are you taking in the way of classes?"
"Well, I'll take just about anything that gets
in the way of classes. Aaanyway . .
"Are you getting enough to eat? Need any
thing?"
"Yup. Nope. Aaaaanyway ..
"Well, someone was telling me about a car
accident in Los Angeles not too long ago, so be
careful. You just stay away from that place."
"Right. Is that all?"
"Christopher Michael Harris, Ah'm gonna
wear yeooh out! Don't talk like that to me,
young man."
"You're already wearing me out, Mom. Is
that all?"
"Well, I guess. Love you."
"Love you too. Bye."
"Good-bye."
And there you have it. The mother of all
mothers. I'm not quite ready for a big tattoo on
my chest in her honor, and even if I was, all my
chest hair would make it illegible. But heck,
without her, what would I be? Just another
washed-up Y-chromosome floating around the
sewers of Ohio. I guess I owe her something for
that. Maybe I'll call her next month.

that. You just stay away from that place. Now
who all went?"
"Just a bunch of us."
"Did any girls go?"
"Some."
"Are you, um, seeing someone, you know,
steady now? What's her name? Do you like
her? Where's she from? Is she a senior? Does
she have a job yet? Do you have a job yet? What
are you doing with your life anyway?"
"Not really, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, no
and I don't know."
"Oh, fiddlesticks. You never tell me any
thing. So what else is going on at Stanford?"
"Nothing."
(Long silence as she tries to sweat informa
tion out of me.) "Actually we, uh, found out
who our commencement speaker is."
"Oh goody, who is it?"
"Um .. . (mumble mumble) kirk varnedoe
(mumble)."
"Kurt Vonnegut ? Ooooh, I love Kurt Von
negut! He's witty, yet thought provoking, and
a bit anti-establishment. And very well known.
Just what a graduation speaker should be."
"Uh .. . Mom? He's a museum curator."
"He certainly is an amusing character. I
can't wait to hear Kurt Vonnegut speak. (Ray?
Ray? Guess what. Kurt Vonnegut is going to
speak at Christopher's graduation!) Oh, your
father's so proud! He says Catch-22 is one of
his favorite books, you know."
"Oh, we also got a new President." I went
on to tell her all about Casper the friendly
Provost. She asked how it felt dealing with a
54-year old Hamburger. The usual Food Ser
vice jokes followed.
"So, he's a German, is he? Do you know

what he was doing during the war? You don't
want an incident like that Ivan Boesky."
"Uh, you mean Kurt Waldheim, Mom. I
think we're safe. Even if Casper would have
been able to read the words back then, he prob
ably didn't even know what a national socialist
was."
"I'm not talking about socialists, Christo
pher. I'm talking about... (low whisper) N-a
_1 _ H
Z-l-8.
"Sorry. My mistake. Anyway ..."
"What are you taking in the way of classes?"
"Well, I'll take just about anything that gets
in the way of classes. Aaanyway . .
"Are you getting enough to eat? Need any
thing?"
"Yup. Nope. Aaaaanyway ..
"Well, someone was telling me about a car
accident in Los Angeles not too long ago, so be
careful. You just stay away from that place."
"Right. Is that all?"
"Christopher Michael Harris, Ah'm gonna
wear yeooh out! Don't talk like that to me,
young man."
"You're already wearing me out, Mom. Is
that all?"
"Well, I guess. Love you."
"Love you too. Bye."
"Good-bye."
And there you have it. The mother of all
mothers. I'm not quite ready for a big tattoo on
my chest in her honor, and even if I was, all my
chest hair would make it illegible. But heck,
without her, what would I be? Just another
washed-up Y-chromosome floating around the
sewers of Ohio. I guess I owe her something for
that. Maybe I'll call her next month.

Chris Harris
THANK GOD FOR HARRIS!
I've always tried to be sympathetic to the
feminist cause. After all, it's in my blood —
one of my parents is female. The other's
Irish. I'm not sure what that makes me.
Yes, I owe a lot to dear old Ma Harris. She
guided me through the simple, easy days of
childhood, before I knew all the hassles of col
lege life. Days when overdrawing simply meant
I got a little periwinkle on the kitchen table.
When the closest thing to pre-med was waiting
my turn to play Operation, that wacky doctor's
game from Milton Bradley (It takes a steady
hand. . . Zzt! "Buttuhtinguhs!"). When my
closest encounter with drugs was Doobie Bee,
my only care in the world was "What if it rains
on Ernie's Tweedlebugs again?" and life's great
est mystery was how in Sam Hill that Playskool
barn mooed every time I opened the door.
And when I needed to mature, give up
childhood, she gave me that extra push. She
supported me when I realized that Dynamite
magazine just wasn't as cool as it used to be.
She donated my Suckerman and Stretch
Armstrong dolls to Goodwill. She threw out
my baseball cards. All of them. Every single
one.
OK, so she grew up in West Virginia.
Points off for that. And she's as overprotec
tive as Gollem was with that ring — "My
preeciousss ..." she calls me late at night.
And this age thing is starting to creep up
around the edges. She's still Mom, so I fig
ured I'd make the big effort, go all out for her
and ... give her a call.
"Hey, Mom?"
"Dav-Jo-Jen .. . who are you?" Her mind
ran through her list of children until she found
a name that fit: "Christopher Michael Harris,
ah'm gonna wear yeooh out! You nehver call
me! Well, tell me what's been going on, and
don't say 'Nothing.' "
"N'much."
"Oh, pooh. Now where did you go for Spring
Break? I hope you didn't go to, oh, what's it
cawlled? Fort Lawderdale or anywhere."
"Mom, that's in Florida."
"Well, good. You just stay away from that
place."
"Yes'm. We went to Las Vegas."
"Ohmygawd. Are you OK? (Ray! Christo
pher says he went to Las Vegas!) You didn't.. .
gamble, did you?"
"No, Mom. We went for the cultural
enlightenment. You know: Wayne Newton,
Rich Little, Jerry Lewis ..."
"Well, good. You just stay away from that

place. It's dirty. Now what else?"
"Nothing. Went to Death Valley."
"(Gasp!) For heaven sakes! Christopher
Michael Harris, ah'm gonna wear yeooh out!
