Afrika Baby Baambatta
wasn't joking when he said on
De La Soul's '89 "Buddy"
remix that the "Native
Tongues got rhymes galore."
The membership list of the
New York-based collective
reads like a who's who in pro
gressive hip-hop: The Jungle
Brothers, the aforementioned
De La Soul, A Tribe Called
Quest, Monie Love, Queen Lat
ifah and 1991's hottest new
group, Blacksheep.
But just when they thought
they closed the clubhouse door,
a "sneaky freaky brother" came
up from the rear. Chi-Ali, a 15-
year-old rapper from the "Boo
gie Down" Bronx, has just
released his debut effort on Rel
ativity Records, "The Fabulous
Chi-Ali."
Fifteen years old? Don't
front. When it comes to rhyme
skills, Chi-Ali easily supports
his premise that "Age Ain't
Nuthin' But A Number." Peo
ple forget that many of hip
hop's legends, LL Cool J com
ing most easily to mind, started
performing at early ages. Chi-
Ali, like he says on Black
sheep's "Pass The 40," may be
"too young for the '40s and too
young for blunts," but he defi
nitely has the skills to uphold
the Native Tongue standards
well into the year 2000.
Despite his age, this "Native
Son" of the Native Tongues
hasn't felt much heat about his
ability to perform in one of
music's most cutthroat talent
arenas. His crackling voice (in
the throes of puberty) spoke for
itself in a recent phone inter
view.
"Being that I'm young, I
take it as it not being a lot of
pressure, 'cause you know, it's
like I'm in a class by myself,"
said the rapper. "As far as
other young rappers, there's no
other rappers really solo my
age; most of them are in
groups, and they're mostly sin
gin', so , I really don't even see
it as pressure."
Being a member of hip-hop's
hottest posse also doesn't seem

to phase the rapper. While it
might seem that each new
album released by a Native
Tongue member outdoes the
previous one, Chi doesn't even
sweat it.
"I'm just doing my thing,
you know. I can't really worry
about [the other Natives],
that'll slow things down."
Things couldn't be moving
faster for New York's "Funky
Roadrunner." "My schedule's
about to get crazy busy," he put
it quite simply. Phone inter
views, music videos and in
store appearances are just a few
of the things this young man
has to balance besides his
school work. But new-found
fame hasn't altered his rela
tionships with family and
friends.
"My pops, he's my manag
er. ... We have a cool relation
ship, where it's more of a friend
relationship than it is a
father/son relationship, 'cause
I can tell him stuff you really
wouldn't tell your father," Chi
said. "So it's cool, and this is
definitely bringing us closer.
There's a few people [school
mates] who are gonna, of
course, be jealous, but you have
to ignore that."
The 13 tracks on "Fabulous"
are sla-hammin'! Produced by
The Beatnuts, the music flows
nicely behind Chi's rhyme
