## 'Sweeney Todd' almost soars 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
Stephen Sondheim's musical "Sweeney Todd"
ranks as one of the more difficult shows to pull off
decently. With its operatic score and the technical
demands of executing multiple on-stage neck slash
ings, "Sweeney Todd" is a treat to see even when it's
performance is merely adequate.
With this in mind, Theatre Works' current Palo
Alto production of the Tony Award-winning black
comedy succeeds admirably, if only because it over
comes the inherent obstacles that frequently make
other productions painfully bad.
"Sweeney Todd" tells the story of a man who
returns to his native England seeking revenge on
Judge Turpin, who terrorized his family and banished
him to a penal colony in Australia. A barber by trade,
Todd brings his razors out of retirement to exact his
macabre retribution on the judge and the society that
disregarded the injustice done to him.
Most notably, Theatre Works' talented cast rips
through Sondheim's arduous but powerful musical pas
sages and frequent use of unconventional meters. The
chorus numbers resonate with the power of Todd's hor
rific quest, and Ron Pickett as Toby performs an impec
cable version of "Not While I'm Around," one of the
sweetest songs in the musical theater canon.
Within the constraints of the cramped Lucie Stern
Theatre, Theatre Works fulfills the required technical
aspects in workman-like fashion. Todd's barber chair,
which dumps freshly murdered bodies straight into
the oven of Mrs. Lovett (Todd's neighbor who makes
"the best meat pies in London") occasionally seems a
bit awkward, but on the whole serves the play without
being distracting. Director Robert Kelley also chooses
to downplay the gore of the killings, eliminating the
necessity for dramatic bloody effects.

Oregon Shakespeare Festival veteran Joe Vincent
brings his formidable talents and smooth singing voice
to the title role with force. His portrayal of the demon
barber of Fleet Street highlights the appropriate
moments of darkness and comedy effectively.
But just as there's nothing wrong with Vincent's
portrayal and nothing wrong with the show itself,
something still seems to be missing. Recast from the
beginning of the London industrial era to 1915
wartime, the production doesn't provide enough moti
vation for the various moments to thrust the show
into the arena of the exceptional.
Mrs. Lovett never satisfactorily suggests her rea
sons for goading Todd along his murderous path, and
Todd's decision to slay innocent customers makes lit
tle sense without the dehumanizing oppression of the
mechanical age normally emphasized by the show.
In particular, Judge Turpin is a completely innocu
ous villain, displaying none of the hideous lustful qual
ities which eventually drive Todd to kill. When Turpin
decides to marry his ward, Todd's daughter Johanna,
Turpin's concern over keeping her away from her
amorous sailor suitor seems genuine, if misplaced.
Although the setting is certainly adequate to con
vey the action, frequent lapses in continuity are
unnecessarily confusing. Mrs. Lovett's oven inexplica
bly bounces from one side of the stage to the other like
a ping-pong ball.
Even to those who know the surprise ending, the
show should still pack a punch. Theatre Works' pro
duction doesn't quite soar, although the potential is
certainly there. With an amazingly talented cast, the
show contents itself with staying on the ground when
it could have taken off to much greater heights.

"Sweeney Todd" runs through April 18 at the Lucie
Stern Theatre in Palo Alto. Tickets range from $12-
$22; call 329-2623 for more information.
