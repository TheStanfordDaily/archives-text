# Springsteen remains 'The Boss' with stunning new albums
## 
### Ari Richter Senior staff writer 
It was well worth the wait. After near
ly five years, Bruce Springsteen
released his 10th and 11th albums
("Human Touch" and "Lucky Town")
Tuesday, and suddenly the sun shone
more brightly than it had in a while.
Recorded in 1989 and 1990, "Human
Touch is the more musically enticing of
the two new releases. Its chord progres
sions are familiar, and the persona that
earned Springsteen the nickname "The
Boss" is very much in evidence.
As was often the case in past Spring

steen songs, love is compared to a crap
shoot; in "Roll of the Dice," he sings: "I've
stumbled and I know I made my mis
takes/But tonight I'm gonna be playin' for
all of the stakes." This is old-fashioned
Springsteen, ever macho, having a good
time.
Compared to the thoroughly introspec
tive "Lucky Town," "Human Touch"
finds Springsteen playing it safe; the
lyrics are sung with force, but Spring
steen hesitates to get too personal. He
steers clear of painful emotions that
might reveal chinks in the Boss's armor.
But this is Springsteen as fans have come
to love him.

One song in particular, "57 Channels
(And Nothrn' On)," offers a delightfully
sardonic look at a guy who buys a satellite
dish to try to impress his love interest,
only to find that the romance is an experi
ence as vapid and unrewarding as an end
less search through the nonsense of TV.
"Man'B Job" picks up right where
"Tougher Than the Rest" (from 1987's
"Tunnel of Love") left off, with Spring
steen trying to prove his relative mettle in
the face of competition.
The title track, which Springsteen
released as a single in early March and
which yielded the first video from either
album, hints at the seriousness that
comes on "Lucky Town." Fickle lovers
beware: "You can't shut off the risk and
the pain/Without losin' the love that
remains."
If "Human Touch" finds Springsteen
roaming past musical roads, "Lucky
Town" is new ground. Never before
has "The Boss" dropped his guard as he
does on this album.
Recorded in 1991, well into his second
and current marriage to background singer
Patti Scialfa, with whom Springsteen has
already had two children, "Lucky Town"
may be Springsteen's personal musical
equivalent of Dante's "Inferno" or Arthur
Miller's "The Crucible."
In "Living Proof," Springsteen is truly
vulnerable: "I went down into the desert
city/Just tryin' so hard to shed my skin/I
crawled deep into some kind of dark
ness/Lookin' to burn out every trace of
who I'd been."
Indeed, the macho of "Human Touch"
is gone from the album's beginning. On
its first track, "Better Days," Springsteen
is singing from the vantage point of the
end of his personal trek and is clearly
thankful for the turn-around in his life he
owes to Scialfa.
As he reflects on where he was, he
takes a swing at his own mystique: "It's
a sad funny ending to find yourself pre
tending/A rich man in a poor man's
shirt." And when he looks at where he
is, there's no mistaking that "these are

better days."
In stark contrast to "Human Touch,"
"Lucky Town" doesn't try to prove any
thing. Springsteen is telling his story
apparently out of the need to do so. "Local
Hero" describes, among other things, the
media's view of Springsteen's roller coast
er ride through two marriages and the
interim divorce:
"First they made me the king, then
they made me pope/Then they brought
me the rope."
It's a shocking route to see Springsteen
traveling. On the album cover, he is
unkempt â€” with ridiculous sunglasses
and earrings for three (a far cry from the
tailored and groomed "Tunnel of Love"
cover). But that seems to be the point.
Springsteen is baring his soul.

On "Leap of Faith," Springsteen sings
his thanks directly to his wife: "'Neath a
veil of dreams sweet blessings rain/Honey
I can feel the first breeze of summer/And
in your love I'm born again."
On "Souls of the Departed," Spring
steen writes an elegy for many whose
lives were cut off at the knees, either in
the Gulf War, "on the road to Basra"
(Iraq), or on the streets of Compton,
"shot down in a schoolyard."
And then the real reason for the song
emerges, as Springsteen's thoughts shift
directly to his son: "Tonight as I tuck my
own son in bed/All I can think of is what
if it would've been him instead." If only
"The Boss" were as powerful as hi 3 per
sona: "I want to build me a wall so high
nothing can burn it down."
