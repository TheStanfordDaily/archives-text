"White Men Can't Jump" is like the Laker's sea
son this year— the talent was there, but a few criti
cal elements were just plain missing.
Sidney Deane (Wesley Snipes) and Billy Hoyle
(Woody Harrelson) are two hustlers literally playing
the same game, wrangling money out of people who are
either foolish or cocky enough to play hoops for money.
They become partners after Deane's friends
invite Hoyle, "the chump" — in other words, the
geeky-looking white guy — into one of their games.
But Hoyle outplays and outshoots Deane. Later in
the movie, the two of them begin to form a friend
ship tested by circumstance and challenging person
al situations.
With Harrelson and Snipes doing much of their
own ball-playing, the court action was definitely the
most enthralling part of the movie. Beautifully
smooth no-look passes, 360-degree backward twist
shots and potent slam dunks bestowed seat-gripping
excitement upon the audience.

The performances by several supporting actors
saved the numerous cliched jokes, such as the tired
"yo' momma" mount and cap, and managed to steal
laughter from the audience. Unfortunately, the
same cannot be said for the serious parts.
"Can't Jump" introduced the themes of race,
alcoholism, gender relations and black-on-black
crime, then shied away from examining any of them
by resolving the conflicts with one-liners.
In one scene, the Deanes' home in the projects is
robbed. Mrs. Deane shouts out to gawking neigh
bors, "I know one of you knows who did this," and
"You didn't have to trash it (the apartment)."
This conflict, along with the issue of whether
Mrs. Deane should get a job, are resolved by her
telling Sidney she wants to work and Sidney simply
saying "OK."
The issue of gender relations also was raised with
a trite verbal exchange between Hoyle and his live
in companion, Gloria Clemente (Rosie Perez).
As a comedy/drama, "Can't Jump" aggravatingly
continued to go up for the three-point shot, only to
catch air.
