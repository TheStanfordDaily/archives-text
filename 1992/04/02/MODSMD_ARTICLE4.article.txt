# Bookstore revelations draw muted response from student shoppers
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
It was pretty much business as usual yester
day at the Stanford Bookstore, as most stu
dents did not seem fazed by the latest revela
tion about the store's business practices.
The Daily reported Tuesday that The Book
store lost close to $2 million last year as a result
of what one of its board members called "rather
speculative" investments in the stock market.
Like many other students interviewed out
side the store yesterday afternoon, sophomore
Emily Parker had other things on her mind.
"With all of the scandals on
campus lately, I've started just
skimming over the latest scan
dal," said Parker, who is majoring
in human biology. "I just get what
I need from the Bookstore."
Of those students who did offer
opinions, most said the Bookstore
should be more careful, especially
in light of what they said were
high prices, low rebates and the
Bookstore's monopoly on campus.
Freshman Sarah Martin said

the store's actions are "just an
injustice to the students."
Some students said they felt
there was no need for a nonprofit
organization to be investing in the
stock market. Others said they
felt investments in stocks were
acceptable if they were careful.
"Risky investments is not
where the Bookstore should be
placing its time and energy," said
Senior Anne Adams, a senior
majoring in human biology.
Mike Harville concurred. "I
think its OK that the Bookstore
invests in the stock market, but it
sounds like they just threw
money away," he said.

Students differed in their
assessments of who appeared
responsible for the investment
loss.
"I think the only problem is
that one person was in charge of
the investments," said sophomore
Scott Porter. "A lot of people lose
money on stocks, but I think
there was no quality control on
their investments."
But Veronique Gillard, a grad
uate student in Material Sci
ences, said: "It looked like some
one screwed up, but he was let
go, so I don't know if the whole
Bookstore should be held respon
sible."
