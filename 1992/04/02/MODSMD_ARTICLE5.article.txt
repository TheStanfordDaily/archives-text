## Starnes performed pioneering lung transplants 
### Anush Yegyazarian Staff writer 
Vaughn Starnes, a Medical
School associate professor and a
pioneer in pediatric heart-lung
transplants, will be leaving Stan
ford to assume a post with USC's
Medical School — according to
USC. But Stanford officials say he
might not.
According to a statement from
Tom DeMeester, chairman of
USC's Department of Surgery,
Starnes has agreed to take over as
chief of cardiac surgery there.
Regina Birdsell — a spokesper

son for the LA Children's Hospital,
which is affiliated with USC — said,
"Our understanding is that Dr.
Starnes has accepted the position
and will start July Ist." Starnes
would also serve as director of the
hospital's transplant program.
However, Stanford Medical
School spokesperson Spyros
Andreopoulos said, "It's not a done
deal."
Andreopoulos said Starnes met
with Medical School Dean David
Korn and other Medical School
officials yesterday, and Starnes
agreed to think about what they
discussed and deliver a final deci

sion to Stanford today.
Neither Starnes nor Korn
returned phoAe calls yesterday.
"[Starnesl told me [USC]
offered him an opportunity for
advancement," but that he felt
"strongly" about staying and
wanted to negotiate his position,
Andreopoulos said.
Birdsell said that according to
her information, Starnes has
already signed a "letter of offer"
from the dean at USC, which indi
cates a faculty appointment. The
Children's Hospital sent a final
letter to Starnes on Monday wel
