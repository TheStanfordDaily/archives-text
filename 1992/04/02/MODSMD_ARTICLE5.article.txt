# Top doctor could go to USC
## Starnes performed pioneering lung transplants 
### Anush Yegyazarian Staff writer 
Vaughn Starnes, a Medical
School associate professor and a
pioneer in pediatric heart-lung
transplants, will be leaving Stan
ford to assume a post with USC's
Medical School — according to
USC. But Stanford officials say he
might not.
According to a statement from
Tom DeMeester, chairman of
USC's Department of Surgery,
Starnes has agreed to take over as
chief of cardiac surgery there.
Regina Birdsell — a spokesper

son for the LA Children's Hospital,
which is affiliated with USC — said,
"Our understanding is that Dr.
Starnes has accepted the position
and will start July Ist." Starnes
would also serve as director of the
hospital's transplant program.
However, Stanford Medical
School spokesperson Spyros
Andreopoulos said, "It's not a done
deal."
Andreopoulos said Starnes met
with Medical School Dean David
Korn and other Medical School
officials yesterday, and Starnes
agreed to think about what they
discussed and deliver a final deci

sion to Stanford today.
Neither Starnes nor Korn
returned phoAe calls yesterday.
"[Starnesl told me [USC]
offered him an opportunity for
advancement," but that he felt
"strongly" about staying and
wanted to negotiate his position,
Andreopoulos said.
Birdsell said that according to
her information, Starnes has
already signed a "letter of offer"
from the dean at USC, which indi
cates a faculty appointment. The
Children's Hospital sent a final
letter to Starnes on Monday wel
coming him to the faculty, she
said.
Starnes has been with the Stan
ford Medical Center since 1984,
first as Chief Resident in Cardio
vascular Surgery and since 1988 as
head of the heart-lung and lung
transplant program in the Depart
ment of Cardiothoracic Surgery.
He also serves as chief of the
Cardiothoracic Surgical Service at
the Lucile Salter Packard Chil
dren's Hospital, which is affiliat
ed with Stanford.
Jean Tips, a spokesperson for
Packard Hospital, said there has
been no confirmation that

'We can't afford to
lose talented people.'

Starnes is leaving Stanford.
During his time at Stanford,
Starnes pioneered a number of tho
racic transplants, including the
first partial lung transplant from a
living person — a mother to her
daughter — performed in 1990.
Last October, he completed the
first successful lung transplant on
a 17 day-old infant with diaphrag
matic hernia. According to Tips,
Jacqueline Reed's intestines were
pressing up on her diaphragm and
had incapacitated one of her lungs.

Starnes was able to transplant
one lung — from a 6-week old
infant who had died — into Reed,
and she was released from the
Packard Hospital in January.
Medical School Assoc. Prof.
James Theodore, who works with
Starnes in the heart-lung and lung
program, said "it would be a major
loss" for Stanford if Starnes left.
"We can't afford to lose talent
ed people if Stanford wants to pre
serve excellence," he said.
However, Theodore said, "Peo
ple know that he was being recruit
ed by other places. It's not an
uncommon practice in this field."
Theodore is in charge of select
ing patients for transplant
surgery and deals with long-term
care while Starnes performs the
surgery.
