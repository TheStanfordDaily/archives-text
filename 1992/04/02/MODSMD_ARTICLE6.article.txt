# Alumni turn risk, effort into great reward

Stanford alum Nick Frost
started the Mango Cafe on a
whim and "lots of credit cards."
Over the past year, he
watched his idea evolve into a
Palo Alto restaurant which
has become a hot spot for Bay
Area dining.
"Now I'm loving life," Frost
said. The past few days, he has
been enjoying a leisurely lifestyle
— sleeping in, working out and
arriving to work at 1 p.m.
Although Frost is pleased
by his own success, he says
entrepreneurship is not for
everyone. "For every ten peo
ple that have creative ideas,
one might do'something."
Nevertheless, Frost and other
Stanford students and alumni
have found their niche in the
business world through original
money-making ventures.
"Live passionately!" are the
last two words on senior Joe
Williams' answering machine.
During his sophomore year,
Williams and a few friends
hooked up a campus delivery
service with Jack-in-the-Box.
He and his partners convinced
the fast-food chain to give them
their own office on location,
complete with a phone network.

"For every 10 people that have creative ideas, one might do something," says Alumnus Nick Frost,
the co-owner of the Mango Cafe in Palo Alto. Shown standing between employees Yolanda Keller and
Benjetta Carri, Frost is one of several alumni who have turned entrepreneurial spirit into profit.
