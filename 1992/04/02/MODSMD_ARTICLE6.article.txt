# Alumni turn risk, effort into great reward
## 
### Elisa Nino-Murcia Staff writer 
Stanford alum Nick Frost
started the Mango Cafe on a
whim and "lots of credit cards."
Over the past year, he
watched his idea evolve into a
Palo Alto restaurant which
has become a hot spot for Bay
Area dining.
"Now I'm loving life," Frost
said. The past few days, he has
been enjoying a leisurely lifestyle
— sleeping in, working out and
arriving to work at 1 p.m.
Although Frost is pleased
by his own success, he says
entrepreneurship is not for
everyone. "For every ten peo
ple that have creative ideas,
one might do'something."
Nevertheless, Frost and other
Stanford students and alumni
have found their niche in the
business world through original
money-making ventures.
"Live passionately!" are the
last two words on senior Joe
Williams' answering machine.
During his sophomore year,
Williams and a few friends
hooked up a campus delivery
service with Jack-in-the-Box.
He and his partners convinced
the fast-food chain to give them
their own office on location,
complete with a phone network.

"For every 10 people that have creative ideas, one might do something," says Alumnus Nick Frost,
the co-owner of the Mango Cafe in Palo Alto. Shown standing between employees Yolanda Keller and
Benjetta Carri, Frost is one of several alumni who have turned entrepreneurial spirit into profit.
Anne Manrique and Amanda Blakeley,
1987 graduates, opened their frozen
yogurt shop in Palo Alto as a result of
their experiences as students, not their
undergraduate degrees in political sci
ence.
"Everyone went to Cool Licks, but we
wanted another place," Manrique said.
One year after graduation, they launched
their successful venture, Frojolais.
Dream into action
"Because you're at Stanford, you
think you have a birthright to a BMW.
Not everyone is ready to live in East Palo
Alto for a year," Frost said.
He reflected on the drastic economic
change he underwent when he invested
what money he had and stretched his
credit limit to open the Mango Cafe with
a partner.
"I have the ability to sweat a lot. The
first year we lost a lot of money. That was
very much a letdown," he recalled.
The hard times paid off, though. Over
the past year, business at the cafe, on
University Avenue, has quadrupled. The
restaurant is soon moving to a new and
expanded location on El Camino Real.
Williams, however, said the time

involved in being both a student and a
businessman finally put an end to his fast
food delivery service's success.

'Not everyone is ready to
live in East Palo Alto for a
year ... I have the ability to
sweat a lot.'

His confidence in the idea's potential
from the beginning convinced the fast
food chain to work with him.
"Look. You have to believe in me. You
just have to," Williams told the Jack-in
the-Box businessmen.
The enterprise turned out to be very
lucrative, but also too time-consuming.
Williams said he was up every night until
3 or 4 a.m., and eventually had to discon
tinue the service.
"If someone ever could come up with a
more time-efficient system, they would
make bucks," Williams said with enthusi
asm.
Nevertheless, he emphasizes the
importance of gaining practical experi
ence beyond a university education.
"Undergraduates have the idea that
they'll graduate from here, go to Harvard

Business School and end up working for
Anderson Consulting," he said. "By
thinking that way, we are mitigating the
value of Stanford."
Inspiration and advice
"If you don't do what you love, it's so
costly," Williams said. "One of the great
est tragedies is when you know you love
something but, because you love it so
much, you feel it's too risky to try it
because you might fail."
Sometimes the craziest ideas, the ones
that stray from the expected, can make
the most sense. Frost opened his restau
rant simply because he "felt like it."
The idea for the Mango Cafe's
Caribbean theme also came on a whim. "I
wanted to create a place where people
could forget all their earthly realities,"
Frost said.
Williams and Frost agree that one
aspect of Stanford life was key in preparing
them for entrepreneurship: experience.
While at Stanford, Frost started a DJ
company to work at fraternity parties.
"But that was just for fun, for socializa
tion purposes, and good to meet chicks,"
he said.
According to Williams, "Everyone
comes in [to the University] a leader, on
top of stuff. My main focus was trying to
be different."
He said "just taking classes" would be
"frightfully boring" and he prefers the

risk and challenge of entrepreneurship.
"(Later on) I'm not going to ask myself
how my grades were," Williams said.
"Also, I would rather get $100,000 from
myself than $8 million from someone
else."
"Students think that it's practically
impossible to start their own business.
We think that because we're so educated
we have to start something like a nation
al semiconductor," he continued. "No! It
only costs $35 to get a sales permit."
Selling is great for people of all back
grounds, he pointed out. "No one cares if
you're pink, purple or orange. If they
want it, they'll buy it."
Frost, Williams and Manrique all had
many helpful hints for the aspiring

purple or orange. If they
want it, they'll buy it.'

entrepreneur.
Frost said there is a lot of "stuff you
can learn in academic classes at Stanford.
But it's almost irrelevant for an
entrepreneur."
He encourages students to gain

accounting and marketing experience
through campus organizations such as
the Stanford Concert Network and
KZSU.
"It's best to get your experience and to
make mistakes on someone else's dol
lars," he said.
Williams urged students to get started
and gain experience right away, instead
of waiting to graduate.
He also highly recommended the "Stu
dent Entrepreneurs Guide" by Van
Hutchinson. "I try to read one [business
bookl a week," he said.
Beyond the knowledge in books, some
times the best resource is a person in
business.
"Keep asking questions. ... Focus on
what you want to do," Manrique advised.
Frost recommended a class offered by
the Business School called "Entrepreneur
ship and High Technology." He has been
asked to be one of the guest speakers for
the class.
But more than anything else, success
ful entrepreneurs have to believe they
can do anything.
"The whole word 'can't' .... just
means no one ever has done it before,"
Williams said.
"People are made to work for other
people. They need that. But working for
yourself will foster your belief in your
self," he added. "You have to have a hell
of a big ego."

value of Stanford."
Inspiration and advice
"If you don't do what you love, it's so
costly," Williams said. "One of the great
est tragedies is when you know you love
something but, because you love it so
much, you feel it's too risky to try it
because you might fail."
Sometimes the craziest ideas, the ones
that stray from the expected, can make
the most sense. Frost opened his restau
rant simply because he "felt like it."
The idea for the Mango Cafe's
Caribbean theme also came on a whim. "I
wanted to create a place where people
could forget all their earthly realities,"
Frost said.
Williams and Frost agree that one
aspect of Stanford life was key in preparing
them for entrepreneurship: experience.
While at Stanford, Frost started a DJ
company to work at fraternity parties.
"But that was just for fun, for socializa
tion purposes, and good to meet chicks,"
he said.
According to Williams, "Everyone
comes in [to the University] a leader, on
top of stuff. My main focus was trying to
be different."
He said "just taking classes" would be
"frightfully boring" and he prefers the

risk and challenge of entrepreneurship.
"(Later on) I'm not going to ask myself
how my grades were," Williams said.
"Also, I would rather get $100,000 from
myself than $8 million from someone
else."
"Students think that it's practically
impossible to start their own business.
We think that because we're so educated
we have to start something like a nation
al semiconductor," he continued. "No! It
only costs $35 to get a sales permit."
Selling is great for people of all back
grounds, he pointed out. "No one cares if
you're pink, purple or orange. If they
want it, they'll buy it."

entrepreneur.
Frost said there is a lot of "stuff you
can learn in academic classes at Stanford.
But it's almost irrelevant for an
entrepreneur."
He encourages students to gain

accounting and marketing experience
through campus organizations such as
the Stanford Concert Network and
KZSU.
"It's best to get your experience and to
make mistakes on someone else's dol
lars," he said.
Williams urged students to get started
and gain experience right away, instead
of waiting to graduate.
He also highly recommended the "Stu
dent Entrepreneurs Guide" by Van
Hutchinson. "I try to read one [business
bookl a week," he said.
Beyond the knowledge in books, some
times the best resource is a person in
business.
"Keep asking questions. ... Focus on
what you want to do," Manrique advised.
Frost recommended a class offered by
the Business School called "Entrepreneur
ship and High Technology." He has been
asked to be one of the guest speakers for
the class.
But more than anything else, success
ful entrepreneurs have to believe they
can do anything.
"The whole word 'can't' .... just
means no one ever has done it before,"
Williams said.
"People are made to work for other
people. They need that. But working for
yourself will foster your belief in your
self," he added. "You have to have a hell
of a big ego."
Stanford alum Nick Frost
started the Mango Cafe on a
whim and "lots of credit cards."
Over the past year, he
watched his idea evolve into a
Palo Alto restaurant which
has become a hot spot for Bay
Area dining.
"Now I'm loving life," Frost
said. The past few days, he has
been enjoying a leisurely lifestyle
— sleeping in, working out and
arriving to work at 1 p.m.
Although Frost is pleased
by his own success, he says
entrepreneurship is not for
everyone. "For every ten peo
ple that have creative ideas,
one might do'something."
Nevertheless, Frost and other
Stanford students and alumni
have found their niche in the
business world through original
money-making ventures.
"Live passionately!" are the
last two words on senior Joe
Williams' answering machine.
During his sophomore year,
Williams and a few friends
hooked up a campus delivery
service with Jack-in-the-Box.
He and his partners convinced
the fast-food chain to give them
their own office on location,
complete with a phone network.

"For every 10 people that have creative ideas, one might do something," says Alumnus Nick Frost,
the co-owner of the Mango Cafe in Palo Alto. Shown standing between employees Yolanda Keller and
Benjetta Carri, Frost is one of several alumni who have turned entrepreneurial spirit into profit.
Anne Manrique and Amanda Blakeley,
1987 graduates, opened their frozen
yogurt shop in Palo Alto as a result of
their experiences as students, not their
undergraduate degrees in political sci
ence.
"Everyone went to Cool Licks, but we
wanted another place," Manrique said.
One year after graduation, they launched
their successful venture, Frojolais.
Dream into action
"Because you're at Stanford, you
think you have a birthright to a BMW.
Not everyone is ready to live in East Palo
Alto for a year," Frost said.
He reflected on the drastic economic
change he underwent when he invested
what money he had and stretched his
credit limit to open the Mango Cafe with
a partner.
"I have the ability to sweat a lot. The
first year we lost a lot of money. That was
very much a letdown," he recalled.
The hard times paid off, though. Over
the past year, business at the cafe, on
University Avenue, has quadrupled. The
restaurant is soon moving to a new and
expanded location on El Camino Real.
Williams, however, said the time

involved in being both a student and a
businessman finally put an end to his fast
food delivery service's success.

'Not everyone is ready to
live in East Palo Alto for a
year ... I have the ability to
sweat a lot.'

His confidence in the idea's potential
from the beginning convinced the fast
food chain to work with him.
"Look. You have to believe in me. You
just have to," Williams told the Jack-in
the-Box businessmen.
The enterprise turned out to be very
lucrative, but also too time-consuming.
Williams said he was up every night until
3 or 4 a.m., and eventually had to discon
tinue the service.
"If someone ever could come up with a
more time-efficient system, they would
make bucks," Williams said with enthusi
asm.
Nevertheless, he emphasizes the
importance of gaining practical experi
ence beyond a university education.
"Undergraduates have the idea that
they'll graduate from here, go to Harvard

Business School and end up working for
Anderson Consulting," he said. "By
thinking that way, we are mitigating the
