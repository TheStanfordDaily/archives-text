$24 billion pledged to former Soviet republics
BONN, Germany (AP) â€” The world's seven wealthiest indus
trialized nations have agreed on a $24 billion aid package to help
save the former Soviet republics from chaos and economic ruin,
Germany announced yesterday.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl also said the troubled states of the
Commonwealth of Independent States would be offered member
ship in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
this month.
The aid pledged by the Group of Seven gave a global seal of
approval to the painful economic reforms of Russian President
Boris Yeltsin.
The aid will strengthen Yeltsin's position against critics who
demand that he fire the architects of his reforms during a key ses
sion of the Russian parliament scheduled to open next Monday.
Horst Koehler, state secretary at the German Foreign Ministry,
says the G-7 plan envisions $18 billion in assistance from the Inter
national Monetary Fund and from the United States, Britain,
France, Italy, Germany, Canada and Japan.
The assistance would also include $6 billion for a fund for the
stabilization of the ruble, Koehler said.
"Countries like Russia and the other former Soviet republics are in
such financial state that any help, economic or financial, will be wel
comed, especially from the United States," Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
