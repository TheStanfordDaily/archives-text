Six faculty members have been honored with
the first Bing teaching awards, Provost James
Rosse announced.
Assoc. Math Prof. Brad Osgood has been
named to the Bing Centennial Teaching Profes
sorship, a university-wide professorship recogniz
ing excellence in undergraduate teaching.
Five other professors were named Bing Fel

teaching as well as pedagogy.

associate professor of materials science; John
Etchemendy, associate professor of philosophy;
Gilbert Masters, teaching professor of civil engi

Recipients can use one-third of the money for any
