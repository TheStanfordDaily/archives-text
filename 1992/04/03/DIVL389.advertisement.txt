NeXT vs. Sun.
In Sun World.
\
Read All About It.
"Consistant user interface style across applications,
a common underlying object-oriented OS, an
astounding set of capabilities." ( p. 52)
That's right. In January, Sun World rated Sun's most popular computers on a scale of 1 to 8.
And in March, Sun World provided a comprehensive review of the NeXTstation Turbo. Sun's
own magazine ranked the NeXTstation Turbo a better value than any Sun workstation. Why?
Here's a sample of what Sun World said:
"It has been difficult...to endure the slings and arrows of Open Wlndows....The best
analogy I can think of is that Unix remains a bunch of bricks without any
mortar at all. It's a nice wall, but it sure doesn't make a good building to live within.
NeXTStep offers the mortar that's missing in the X/Open Windows and X/Motif
environments. Using the NeXT computer offers a computing experiance-a seamless
computer experiance-that shames other advanced systems." (p. 53).
The smooth feel of the interface is light years ahead of anything else available for a
Unix user, not just in GUIs like Motif and Open Windows, but even with the
additional capabilities of Looking Glass, X Desktop, or others." (p. 52)
"We have seen the future of (the) Unix interface. Too bad it's not on our Sun." (p. 43)
