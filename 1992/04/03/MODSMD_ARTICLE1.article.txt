## Library blaze causes $15,000 in damage, but no books harmed 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
A fire in Meyer Library caused an
estimated $15,000 in damage and
forced the evacuation of about 45 peo
ple when a basement air-filtering sys
tem ignited yesterday afternoon.
Five Palo Alto fire units and 10
Stanford police officers responded,
clearing the building and roping it off
with yellow police tape.
Damage was limited to the air-filter
ing system and no books were harmed,
according to Eleanore Stewart of the
library preservation department.
Fire and police departments are cur
rently investigating what started the
fire. "At this time, the cause is undeter
mined," said Don Dudak, battalion chief
for the Palo Alto Fire Department.
The fire units from the Palo Alto Fire
Department arrived at the library short
ly after receiving a call from a Meyer

employee at 12:26 p.m., Dudak said.
The employee had seen smoke coming
through the building's air vents.
When Meyer employees first detect
ed the smoke, "we thought our com
puters had caught on fire," said Arlene
Barr, a media services specialist.
"The smell was acrid. You could
taste it and feel your nose burn," said
Meyer reserves head Julie Cain.
Library staff members began evacuat
ing the building, checking each floor for
students and telling them to go outside
shortly after the alarm sounded.
Stanford Police Sergeant John
McMullen said that "people got the
idea to get out" when the building
began filling with smoke. But some
students stayed inside until the fire
alarm went off at 12:53 p.m., when the
smoke reached the detectors located on
the upper floors of the library.
By then, smoke was "billowing out" of
the outdoor ventilation grills, said Meyer

Director Michael Miller. At this time, the
building was fully evacuated and the sur
rounding area was blocked off.
Although smoke spread throughout
the building, damage was limited to a
filtering unit in a basement room used
for heating and air conditioning.
Library facilities manager Don Intersi
mone said the burned fan equipment
will be replaced in about two weeks.
After extinguishing the flame, fire
fighters began clearing the library of
smoke using the building's exhaust
ventilation system and their own
portable fans, Dudak said.
They also propped doors open all
around the building to let the smoke
empty out.
Firefighters departed at about 3 p.m.
after clearing most of the smoke from the
library. Students were allowed to enter
the building soon afterward, according to

However, employees still dis

extended time on the third floor,

fewer students in the Meyer than
