Gas leak fouls campus air
It wasn't rotten eggs.
The foul smell coming from the McCullough Science and Engi
neering Building around 11:15 yesterday morning was caused by
the accidental release of the gas methyl mercaptan, according to
Senior Research Scientist Robert DeMattei.
He said the gas is "similar to the stuff used to give natural gas
an odor" and is not toxic. "It was something you could smell at the
level of parts per trillion," he added.
The odor didn't last very long — only about 15 to 20 minutes,
according to McCullough Building Manager Mark Gibson. The
smell was especially bad because "the wind wasn't circulating
well" and the gas was not dissipated, Gibson said.
DeMattei said the smell hit Durand, Mitchell and Terman and
"even went as far as the press building."
"Someone was pumping out a system, not knowing that a part
of the system had failed," he said. "The gas was pumped right into
the exhaust."
