# Talking about testing
## To ease discussion of HIV, Cowell launches peer counseling service 
### Holly Hacker Senior staff writer 
Talking to someone his own
age would have made Alex
MacAlalad's HIV test less stress
ful — one of the main reasons the
graduate student is now involved
with Cowell Student Health Cen
ter's new peer counseling pro
gram.
Being tested for the virus that
causes AIDS "is a really anxiety
producing process," he said. "I
wish that I'd had more support,
and I really think [this program!
will offer that support."
Rudi Gaudio, a graduate stu
dent in linguistics, is also work
ing with Cowell. He said his pre
vious experience as a peer coun
selor at Columbia was a positive
one.
Since people seeking tests are
usually asked sensitive ques
tions about their sexual behav
ior, "it's just more difficult" if
the person doing the counseling
is "older and resembles your
father or mother or grandfather
more than your peers," Gaudio
said.
Students apprehensive about
revealing their identity to a doctor
when getting an HIV-antibody
test will soon be able to meet with
one of the Cowell peer counselors
— without anyone knowing their
name.
Cowell is implementing a pilot
program this quarter in which

students can be tested anony
mously if they undergo counsel
ing sessions with a peer before
and after the test. In the past,
Cowell had only offered confiden
tial testing.
With confidential testing, the
doctor who does the counselling
knows the identity of the person
tested. But with anonymous test
ing, the person is known only by a
number or pseudonym. California
state law requires pre- and post
test counseling in both cases.
Cowell Director Harvey Wein
stein said the idea for anonymous
testing evolved about a year ago,
when he learned from a task force
on gay, lesbian and bisexual
issues that some students didn't
want to get tested at Cowell
because they felt uncomfortable
discussing sensitive, personal
issues with a doctor.
"Clearly there was a group that
wasn't coming here," he said.
The idea for peer counseling
arose around the same time. Gon
zalez said Stanford looked at peer
counseling programs at the Uni
versity of Southern California, Cal-
State Northridge and Columbia
University in revamping its testing
procedure.
Several Cowell staff members
and peer counselors see benefits
with the new program.
Stanford Health Educator Vir
ginia Gonzalez said students
"might be more willing to talk
about risky activities with a peer

than with a physician." Plus, "a
peer counselor has a little more
time to spend with education"
than a physician.
MacAlalad said peer counsel
ing "will make the test more
accessible to people and lessen
the stress they'll feel. They'll be
in a better frame of mind to listen
as well."
Gonzalez said the program will
be run on a pilot basis this quar
ter. "If we can't get enough folks
to be trained or if it's not being
utilized, then we'll discontinue
it," she said.
With Cowell's anonymous test
ing, a student will make an
appointment with a peer coun
selor under a fictitious name. The
student can request a different
counselor if he or she already
knows that person, Gonzalez said.
In the pre-test session, which
will last between 15 and 30 min
utes, the counselor will assess the
student's risk of getting HIV and
then explain how the test works
and what the result means.
For example, the most com
monly-used tests detect only the
antibodies to HIV, not the virus
itself. Because an individual can
be infected with HIV for several
months before producing antibod
ies, a negative test does not neces
sarily mean the person is not
infected.
The student will meet with the
counselor again to receive the
results of the test. If the test is

positive, the counselor will pro
vide referral and support services
to the student.
Regardless of the test results,
the counselor may help the stu
dent learn to make behavioral
changes to reduce the risk of con
tracting HIV.
"It's an opportunity to provide
education as well as information,"
Gonzalez said.
Three students have already
been trained and will start coun
seling soon. According to
MacAlalad, more than 30 other
students have applied for the
position.
Applicants must fill out a form
indicating their reasons for want
ing to be counselor and their pre
vious relevant training. Gonzalez
said they are then screened and
interviewed by people who will try
to "get a sense (of their) ability to
deal with the issues with sensitiv
ity."
Counselors will undergo two or
three days of training at a county
program in San Mateo,«nd will be
routinely supervised and evaluat
ed by Cowell staff.
Gonzalez admitted that with
the relatively small size of Stan
ford, "it might be harder to be
anonymous" here than at a coun
ty testing site.
But she stressed that peer
counselors will be bound by a code
of ethics such that "you have to
maintain everything as highly
confidential."
