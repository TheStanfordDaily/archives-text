University notification
poliqy solid; failures are
due to support systems

For a child, the only
thing worse than being sent
to the principal's office is
having the school call her parents.
In college, however, parental
notification is more an insult than
a threat.
And, in the wake of increased
parental pressure, the University
administration should be lauded for
retaining its non-notification policy
and preserving the privacy and dig
nity of the student population.
By giving out information to
parents only twice in the past six
years — in situations when offi
cials felt the student's health was
in immediate danger — Stanford
has safeguarded the confidentiality
of students' educational records.
Stanford's policy of not sharing
information with parents has been
called into question by the parents
of Daniel Lichstein, a junior who
committed suicide earlier this year.
The Lichsteins argued that they
could have helped their son had the
University notified them about his
drinking problem.
But the death of Daniel Lich
stein stands as a sobering testa
ment to the failure of Stanford's
support systems, not its parental
notification policy.
The confidentiality of a stu
dent's educational record — which
includes grades, academic standing
and other personal information,
such as psychological records —
has been mandated by both federal
law and Stanford policy since the
early '70s.
If the University were to release
any kind of information to parents,
actions such as sending bills to stu
dents would become mere cosmetic
applications of a nonexistent policy.
Also, any departure from the
current policy would create an
adversarial student-administration

relationship, forcing the University
to contradict the will of individual
students by entering their family
life in unwelcome ways.
One of Stanford's fundamental
philosophies is to treat students as
independent adults. Part of being
an adult lies in maintaining control
over one's relationship with family
members. The responsibility for
communication between students
and parents should rest entirely
with them, not the University.
Certain situations — where the
student's physical or mental
health is at stake — require special
attention. But it is precisely these
extreme cases where privacy
proves most essential.
A large, bureaucratic university
has no way of assessing or under
standing individual parent-child
relationships. College students
generally consider themselves
autonomous, and in many cases,
parental notification would serve
to aggravate, rather than assuage,
a difficult or traumatic situation.
That is not to say, however, that
Stanford should distance itself
from student affairs altogether. As
an educational institution, the
University should take an interest
in the personal and emotional
growth of students — not just
their academic achievement.
Stanford can be a lonely and dif
ficult place for many students. And
given that many students are over
achievers — after all, that's how
they got in — it should not come as
a surprise that they have difficulty
asking for help.
Perhaps then, the support ser
vices here — and Stanford does have
an impressive list of resources —
should do more outreach and fol
low-up on students who may have
trouble admitting they have prob
lems.
In addition, parents should be
explicitly informed by the Univer
sity that they won't be notified of
their child's academic or psycho
logical problems. That way, they
also can take responsibility for
their involvement in their child's
life.
