ASSU Advocacy Office appeals to incoming president

An open letter to incoming University
President Gerhard Casper:
TO BEGIN, PLEASE accept our
congratulations on your appoint
ment. We welcome you and look
forward to meeting and working with you
in the coming years.
As you know, this has been a difficult
year for Stanford. Many obstacles face
this institution. To our eyes, perhaps the
greatest challenge facing Stanford is the
task of remaining affordable to its stu
dents.
As the seven directors of the ASSU
Financial Aid Advocacy Office, we have
spent all year working with students,
staff and administrators to achieve this
very goal. We hope you find our conclu
sions helpful as your formulate your
agenda for the next Stanford century.

Over the next three years, Stanford
will cut $2.5 million from the financial
aid budget through several changes in
needs analysis. By revising accounting
methods, Stanford hopes to glean more
money from students who have a little
more to give.
However, there are oflen discrepan
cies between what someone else assumes
you can pay and what you can truly
afford. It remains to be seen how these
changes will affect the economic diversity
of the incoming class. We will be looking
out to make sure that diversity is sus
tained, if not expanded.
As you know, Stanford recently raised
tuition by 9.5 percent. Theoretically, this
hike will not adversely affect low-income
students since University and federal aid
levels will rise to compensate for higher
tuition.

However, those middle income students
who do not qualify for grants may be
unable or unwilling to incur the onerous
costs of attending Stanford. We must make
sure they stay. We also must insure that
future increases mirror inflation more
closely.
Your statements regarding need-blind
admissions concern us deeply. In the
March 18 issue of Campus Report, you
seemed to suggest that the policy which
directs Stanford to accept students based
on merit and not on family income might
be worth reconsidering at some point.
Judging from other comments you
made, we sense that you understand that
need-blind admissions is a central tenet of
this university. Yet, you argued that the
growing costs of running a major research
university may require re-evaluation of
this very policy.

While we understand that a need-blind
admissions policy is a financial burden, we
strongly challenge any suggestion that this
commitment might someday be reduced in
any way. The integrity of this institution
would not survive any such tampering.
We know that the first months of your
tenure here will be quite busy as you
become acquainted with our traditions and
values. We submit that no tradition is
more central to the mission of this Univer
sity than accessibility.
Stanford began as a tuition-free institu
tion. Only through prolonged effort will we
succeed in keeping Palm Drive open to quali
fied students from all economic backgrounds.
We invite you to join us in this effort.
