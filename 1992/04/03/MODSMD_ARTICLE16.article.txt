## Cooperation leads to peace 
### 
THE PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI con
flict has claimed thousands of lives.
More than 1,000 Palestinians
alone have fallen victim to Israeli sol
diers' bullets since the intifada began five
years ago.
At the same time, Israel continues to
fear for its security, seeing itself as a
minute land surrounded by hostile neigh
bors, while the Palestinians remain
stateless.
Mutual distrust has characterized this
conflict, stalling initiatives aimed at its
resolution, a distrust that can even be
detected among Palestinians and Jews in
the Stanford community.
The recent Madrid Conference is seen
by an Israeli doctor at the Stanford Med
ical Center, speaking on condition of
anonymity, as an American initiative
that neither Israel nor the Arab states
see much point in participating in.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians had little
choice but to participate in the confer
ence, given the changes in "regional and
global political realities," according to
Stanford Senior Lecturer Khalil
Barhoum, a Palestinian.
Both Barhoum and Joel Beinin, a Jew
ish professor in Stanford's History
Department, point out the irony that the
peace process, while officially trying to
find a solution acceptable to all sides, has
not addressed Palestinian self-determi
nation.

The Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO), widely seen as the represen
tative of the Palestinians, has been
excluded, as have Palestinians from East
Jerusalem and the diaspora. Israel has
attempted to limit the focus of the nego
tiations to the autonomy of the people of
Palestine rather than that of the land
and its resources.
Yet, there is room for optimism among
the Palestinians that things may be
changing in their favor. Rabea Ataya, a
junior at Stanford, who lives abroad like
the majority of Palestinians, welcomes
the decrease in American dependence on
Israel, due to the end of the Cold War.
"Israel needs America, yet America no
longer needs Israel as before. The Ameri
cans must use their economic leverage to
demand a more just future for the Pales
tinian people."
Ataya, who sees his people's plight as
"a great modern tragedy," also applauds
the American people, including Jewish
groups, for their pressure on Washington
to make its assistance more conditional
on respect for legitimate Palestinian
rights.
As for the future, it seems to be uncer
tain, affected by many variables. While
Ataya sees the outcome of elections in the
United States and Israel as key factors,
the Israeli doctor identified the democra
tization of "tyrannical Arab states" such
as Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf

States as the main factor affecting the
region's future. Only then will Israel be
able to trust its neighbors and agree to
substantial concessions.
He agreed with Ataya that both
Israelis and Palestinians must realize
that they are condemned to live on the
same land, be more reasonable in their
expectations and learn to live together.
Beinin challenges Israelis to scrap
intransigent tendencies in favor of a last
ing agreement, which, in the long-run,
would insure everyone's security.
In the final analysis, what will become
of the Palestinians? Israeli settlements in
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are
endangering their future as a people. Yet
Barhoum remains optimistic on the ques
tion of Palestinian self-determination:
"Palestinians.. .are the heirs to a proud
history and a rich heritage that will
undoubtedly assure them once again of a
much more hopeful future."
It is up to the United Nations and
other entities who claim to be guarantors
of self-determination to assure the Pales
tinian people's right to independence and
a democratic state.
