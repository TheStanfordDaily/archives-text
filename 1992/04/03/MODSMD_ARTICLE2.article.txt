# Athletes to get new health care provider
## Medical Center chosen for contract 
### Carla Martin Staff writer 
The Stanford Athletic Depart
ment has ended its 40-year-plus
relationship with the Palo Alto
Medical Foundation to sign a new
three-year contract with the
Stanford Medical Center.
The move follows a similar
decision last year to transfer Cow
ell Student Health Center's stu
dent care from the Foundation to
the Medical Center.
Helen Lamothe, the Founda
tion's clinical coordinator, said
she was disappointed and con
fused by the switch because she
believes the Foundation offers
exceptional care.
Continuity is also important,
Lamothe added. "It's important
for athletes' care [that they] know
their doctors."
But Athletic Director Ted
Leland said that although he had
been happy with the Foundation,
he decided to sign the new con
tract becauap the Medical Center
is located on campus and is
staffed with "world-renowned
doctors."
With his approval, he said, any
doctor who has treated team mem
bers for an extended period of time
will be able to continue working
with the athletic program.
Leland said the decision was
not financial, since both pro
grams had similar costs.

Jay Thorwaldson, director of
community relations for the
Foundation, said the decision has
"been in the works for months."
According to Lily Hurlimann,
an administrator at the Founda
tion, the contract expires in
August. She said the contract
they proposed this year to the
Stanford Athletic Program
included an education program
and general health promotion.
But Leland said medical facili
ties on campus would provide
more comprehensive programs.
"One of the things I think we are
going to be able to get into much
more .. .is a pretty good nutri
tion advisory program," he said.
As part of the new program,
Leland said he has appointed Dr.
Michael Dillingham to direct ortho
pedic services for Stanford athletics.
Dillingham said he was excited
about the new program, which will
incorporate orthopedic surgeons,
rehabilitation doctors and general
internists. He has set up similar
models for the San Francisco
49ers and Santa Clara University.
Although Leland has assem
bled a search committee for the
new position of sports medicine
director, he said the committee
has yet to meet.
