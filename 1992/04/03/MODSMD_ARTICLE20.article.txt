## Yee puts 'team' in tennis team Fifth-year senior provides leadership to younger players 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior Staff Writer 
At the beginning of this season, peo
ple had doubts about the Cardinal
men's tennis team. Gone are the Jared
Palmers and Jon Starks — indis
putable big guns in the world of colle
giate tennis.
Instead, a batch of up-and-coming
underclassmen have filled the singles
lineup. The team's youth and inexperi
ence should make the task of nabbing
an NCAA team title especially hard.
However, this goal is not out of
reach, thanks in part to the quiet lead
ership of fifth-year senior, Jason Yee.
"When we were decimated with guys
leaving, Jason made our team a team.
Period," said head coach Dick Gould.
"He's not a rah-rah leader, but for a
coach, having him back is the greatest
thing ever." The two-time All-Ameri
can helped the young players "merge as
a team," according to Gould.
Last year, Stanford lost in the
NCAA finals to USC, so many of the
players have never experienced a
national championship. Yee feels that
last spring's loss has given the team
even more incentive to win this year.
"They haven't been through what it
is like to win one," he said. "Last year
was a real eye-opener.
Everyone works so hard for one
tournament, it's hard to realize how

much luck is involved. It makes you
appreciate even more how successful
Stanford has been. It made us want to
work harder.
"This is one of the most competitive
teams we've ever had in terms of spirit.
Alex (O'Brien) established himself as a
top player but everyone is really solid.
We don't have the big guns but as a
team we compete as well as anyone
else."
Being a team player is the primary
reason why Yee has continued with
tennis at Stanford. As sports go, tennis
is very individual, but Yee's main moti
vation is a desire for team success.
"I've grown so accustomed to a team
concept of tennis which you don't get
until college," he said. "I just want to
do my part. Hopefully, I've contributed
in my own way to make it easier for
everyone else."
Playing in the No. 5 and 6 singles
spots and the second doubles spot with
Vimal Patel this year, Yee is not exact
ly in the limelight, but his contribution
to the Cardinal's success is immeasur
able.
After playing doubles for the past
two years with O'Brien — the pair
went undefeated in dual matches last
season — the partner switch has made
the team's doubles lineup virtually
unstoppable.
"Our chances of winning increase
dramatically with this lineup," Gould
said. "Jason's selflessness as a team
player and the way he reacts to changes

is phenomenal. He just keeps working
harder and the younger guys see that."
This year, working harder has
meant working on his backhand as well
as his serve and volley.
These changes, combined with his
natural athletic ability and quickness
have coach Gould excited about the
rest of the season.
"He's improved so much, always
doing his best every day. That's hard to
do for five years," Gould said. "He's
one of the quickest players I've seen in
my life. Only McEnroe has quicker
hands."
Despite this wealth of talent and
perseverance, Yee does not plan to try
his luck on the professional tour next
year. Opting for a job with a mutual
fund in Denver, Yee is hungrier than
ever for a fourth Cardinal team cham
pionship before he retires from tennis.
"I want to go out on a high note," he
said. "I'm not ready to hang up the
rackets quite yet."
Before he even begins to think about
hanging up the rackets though, he has
a few more foes to contend with, name
ly UCLA and USC this weekend at the
Stanford Tennis Stadium.
The Cardinal men face their biggest
matches of the season, hoping to
defend their hard-won No. 1 ranking.
And Yee, the wisened team player, has
everything to do with that achieve
ment, according to Gould.
"We're No. 1 because Jason came
back, because he's here."


Fifth-year senior Jason Yee has a handle on collegiate tennis. He has provided the
leadership on the team which has helped it rise to its No. 1 ranking. His consistent,
team-oriented play has given an example for younger players on the squad to go by.

meant working on his backhand as well
as his serve and volley.
These changes, combined with his
natural athletic ability and quickness
have coach Gould excited about the
rest of the season.
"He's improved so much, always
doing his best every day. That's hard to
do for five years," Gould said. "He's
one of the quickest players I've seen in
my life. Only McEnroe has quicker
hands."
Despite this wealth of talent and
perseverance, Yee does not plan to try
his luck on the professional tour next
year. Opting for a job with a mutual
fund in Denver, Yee is hungrier than
ever for a fourth Cardinal team cham
pionship before he retires from tennis.
"I want to go out on a high note," he
said. "I'm not ready to hang up the
rackets quite yet."
Before he even begins to think about
hanging up the rackets though, he has
a few more foes to contend with, name
ly UCLA and USC this weekend at the
Stanford Tennis Stadium.
The Cardinal men face their biggest
matches of the season, hoping to
defend their hard-won No. 1 ranking.
And Yee, the wisened team player, has
everything to do with that achieve
ment, according to Gould.
"We're No. 1 because Jason came
back, because he's here."


Fifth-year senior Jason Yee has a handle on collegiate tennis. He has provided the
leadership on the team which has helped it rise to its No. 1 ranking. His consistent,
team-oriented play has given an example for younger players on the squad to go by.

At the beginning of this season, peo
ple had doubts about the Cardinal
men's tennis team. Gone are the Jared
Palmers and Jon Starks — indis
putable big guns in the world of colle
giate tennis.
Instead, a batch of up-and-coming
underclassmen have filled the singles
lineup. The team's youth and inexperi
ence should make the task of nabbing
an NCAA team title especially hard.
However, this goal is not out of
reach, thanks in part to the quiet lead
ership of fifth-year senior, Jason Yee.
"When we were decimated with guys
leaving, Jason made our team a team.
Period," said head coach Dick Gould.
"He's not a rah-rah leader, but for a
coach, having him back is the greatest
thing ever." The two-time All-Ameri
can helped the young players "merge as
a team," according to Gould.
Last year, Stanford lost in the
NCAA finals to USC, so many of the
players have never experienced a
national championship. Yee feels that
last spring's loss has given the team
even more incentive to win this year.
"They haven't been through what it
is like to win one," he said. "Last year
was a real eye-opener.
Everyone works so hard for one
tournament, it's hard to realize how

much luck is involved. It makes you
appreciate even more how successful
Stanford has been. It made us want to
work harder.
"This is one of the most competitive
teams we've ever had in terms of spirit.
Alex (O'Brien) established himself as a
top player but everyone is really solid.
We don't have the big guns but as a
team we compete as well as anyone
else."
Being a team player is the primary
reason why Yee has continued with
tennis at Stanford. As sports go, tennis
is very individual, but Yee's main moti
vation is a desire for team success.
"I've grown so accustomed to a team
concept of tennis which you don't get
until college," he said. "I just want to
do my part. Hopefully, I've contributed
in my own way to make it easier for
everyone else."
Playing in the No. 5 and 6 singles
spots and the second doubles spot with
Vimal Patel this year, Yee is not exact
ly in the limelight, but his contribution
to the Cardinal's success is immeasur
able.
After playing doubles for the past
two years with O'Brien — the pair
went undefeated in dual matches last
season — the partner switch has made
the team's doubles lineup virtually
unstoppable.
"Our chances of winning increase
dramatically with this lineup," Gould
said. "Jason's selflessness as a team
player and the way he reacts to changes

Tve grown so accustomed to a team concept of
tennis which you don't get until college. I just
want to do my part. Hopefully, I've contributed
in my own way to make it easier for everyone
else.'

is phenomenal. He just keeps working
harder and the younger guys see that."
This year, working harder has
meant working on his backhand as well
