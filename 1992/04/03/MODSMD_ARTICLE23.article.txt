# Spikers face tough weekend at home
## 
### Laurie Wackier Staff writer 
A year ago, head volleyball coach Ruben
Nieves had to think long and hard about
which players he should put on the court.
Faced with a talented, yet inexperienced group
of athletes, the first year he stood at the helm
of a proverbial building season. And this fore
man needed to lay the foundation with care.
This weekend, Nieves will still have to
think long and hard about his personnel. But
this time he's not working with raw materials.
"We've got a lot of guys who can play," Nieves
said. "Anyone can contribute against Long
Beach State."
Everyone will have to contribute against
the 49'ers. With an 11-1 conference record
(17-2 overall), the second-ranked spikers host

No. 1 Long Beach State Saturday at Burn
ham. At 13-1, the 49'ers have a slight edge
over Stanford in the Wilson Division of the
WIVA.
According to Nieves, serving will play a key
factor in the Cardinal bid to tip the scales in
their favor. "Long Beach State has a great
sideout game," he explained. "We'll have to
serve tough and strategically."
And they will have to contain Brent
Hilliard. An All-American, Hilliard led the
49'ers earlier this season as they dealt Stan
ford its sole conference loss. "We'll have to
slow him down and keep him under control,"
Nieves added.
Featuring five of the nation's best hitters,
the contest promises offensive fireworks. A
Cardinal tandem of John Bezmalinovic and
Joe Burghardt sports the best hitting percent

ages in the country at .555 and .515 respec
tively.
Across the net, Alan Knipe comes in sixth,
hitting .463, while teammate Hilliard leads
the nation in total kills. Stanford's Dave Goss
ranks right below Hilliard on the list of the
country's most prolific hitters.
But first things first. Brigham Young visits
the farm Friday, and the Cougars will not be
overlooked. Although their 9-10 record may
not appear intimidating, BYU is potentially
lethal.
"They strike me as a dangerous team; they
could beat anybody," Nieves warned. "Their
record doesn't really show how good they are,
but BYU has beaten some very good teams."
Take Long Beach State, for example. Last
