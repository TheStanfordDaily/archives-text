# Women get Final Four déjà vu
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Senor staff writer 
This weekend Stanford's women's bas
ketball team will try to repeat history.
In a rematch of 1990's NCAA semifinal,
the Cardinal will face Virginia tomorrow
at noon. Two years ago Stanford tri
umphed, and went on to take the champi
onship.
This is the third straight trip to the
Final Four for both teams, but they have
taken different paths to get there.
For the Cavaliers, this has been "their
year." Just as Stanford did in 1990, Vir
ginia ripped through its opponents all
year, losing only one game to the confer
ence arch-rival. As the Cardinal did, the
Cavs hosted their own regional. And as
Stanford did, Virginia has focused from
the very beginning on winning the nation
al championship.
The Cavs are so focused that they for
got to cut down the nets when they'd won
the East Regional.
The Cardinal, on the other hand, have
surprised even themselves. The season
began as a rebuilding year.
Stanford had lost three of the school's
best players ever — all three had started
on the championship team. The Cardinal
was young. And it was looking at the
toughest regular season schedule in
school history. The team was an
unknown quantity.
It's not any more. Now the players, who
claim that the chemistry on the team is
better than ever, are upbeat and confident
about their chances to win their second
championship in three years.
After all, the winner of the regular sea
son Stanford-Tennessee game has gone on
to win the title every year since 1989. And
this year it's the Cardinal's turn.
But in order for Stanford to do that, the
team must win two games. The first,
against Virginia, will be on CBS at noon
tomorrow, between the other women's
semifinal and the men's semifinals. The
women's championship game will be on
CBS at 1 p.m. Sunday.
Here's the rundown on the Cardinal's
opponents:

Virginia
The Cavs have been ranked No. 1 in the
country for most of the year. Their per
sonnel and their up-tempo style of play are
both reminiscent of Stanford's 1990 cham
pionship team.
Virginia boasts a powerful frontcourt
game, built around the world's tallest
identical twins. But at 6-foot-5, juniors
Heather and Heidi Burge possess more
than height; they are skilled, as well. The
two, who usually sub for each other at cen
ter, rack up a combined 27.6 points and
14.8 rebounds per game.
Melanee Wagener, Audra Smith, and
Charleata Beale typically split the one for
ward position, as the Cavs like to play a
three-guard lineup.
As strong as Virginia is at center, how
ever, it is the Cavs' backcourt which drives
their game. The centerpiece of the entire
team is 1991 Naismith National Player of
the Year Dawn Staley. Staley, a 5-foot-5
point guard, has already been named
national player of the year in 1992 by sev
eral publications.
Staley is the only player in Atlantic
Coast Conference history — male or
female — to have accumulated over 2000
points, 700 rebounds, 700 assists, and
400 steals. Staley averages 14.3 ppg, 6.2
apg and an amazing (for her height) 5.5
rpg- . ,
"Just forget about boxing her out, says
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer, who
coached Staley the past two summers in
international play. "She's so quick she'll
just run around you.
"You can't shut her down," VanDerveer
continued. "I mean, it's like, can you shut
Michael Jordan down? I mean, we're
gonna . . . we're in for a ... I don't know
what we're gonna do with her. "
Complementing Staley is another All-
America candidate, Tammi Reiss. At 5-
foot-6, Reiss is the tallest of the three
starting guards. Her main role is to score,
which she does prolifically, averaging 16.6
ppg this season.
The third guard is 5-foot-5 junior Dena
Evans, who is really a second point, aver-
