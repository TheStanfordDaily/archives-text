# Injury-ridden netters take on Bruins, Trojans
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
If today's Stanford-UCLA tennis
match was scripted for the silver screen, it
might go something like this:
Bruin star impetuously decides not to
play, citing burnout as the reason. In the
role of underdog, the injury -riddled but
talented UCLA squad faces the six-time
defending national champion Cardinal.
Meanwhile, Stanford — under a cloud
of uncertainty — hobbles into town. Coach
Frank Brennan, who changes lineups
about as often as he loses, juggles players
after several starters go down with
injuries.
In a weird twist of life imitating art,
the story is true.
Iwalani McCalla, the Bruins' top play
er, won't compete this weekend due to
personal reasons and may not compete
until the NCAA Championships in May.
"I just need some time oft from ten
nis," McCalla said. "We played six week
ends in a row and then I didn't even play

over spring break. I was just out watching
practice and didn't feel any desire to
play." McCalla also cited a heavy academ
ic schedule as another reason she's not
competing right now.
"She's just not ready to play," said
UCLA coach Bill Zaima. "We hope to have
her back for next weekend's match with
USC."
The Cardinal squad has its own prob
lems. Emma Woodhouse has a hamstring
pull and won't participate in singles this
weekend and is questionable for doubles.
Kristine Kurth is struggling with a
back strain which has worsened in the
past two weeks. "It hurts a lot on some
shots but not on others," Brennan said.
Her serve and overhead had been most
affected but "now it's even hurting her on
groundstrokes . . . But she has to play
because we can't use Emma in singles."
Despite being considerably less than
100 percent healthy, Kurth may also com
pete in doubles. "She may only be good for
one match. I'll put her into doubles if the
match is still up in the air," Brennan said.

However, the cloud has a silver lining.
Senior Kylie Johnson is finally recovering
from a sore back. She's no longer wearing
a heated bandage and Brennan says she's
much better.
Also healthier is Stanford's No. 2 play
er, Laxmi Poruri. The sophomore has
rebounded from a slight groin pull.
Poruri's mobility was limited not only by
the injury but the tight leg wrap she had
to wear around her upper left thigh.
Gone is the wrap and the limits on her
agility. In recent weeks, Poruri has rock
eted up the collegiate poll to No. 6.
The rest of the starters, Heather Wil
lens and Amy Chiminello, are healthy and
performing well according to Brennan.
Like Stanford, UCLA is suffering
through some injuries. Anne Mall won't
play due to a broken bone in her foot.
Paige Yaroshuck will likely play
although she was also recently on the
injured list.
While Bruin coach Bill Zaima has
been known to change players' positions
from week to week, he will need an extra

large eraser on his pencil when filling out
the lineup for today's match.
Doubles has also been thrown into dis
array as Jenny Baker has a sore shoulder
and won't pair up with Jenny Hilt at No. 2.
With the lineups scrambled, very few
matches are set. At No. 1, Willens battles
Mamie Ceniza. With Mall out, Zaima may
move up Cammie Foley, Lee Ann Ros
tovsky, Hilt and Baker.
With Johnson feeling better, she may
return to her normal slot at No. 3. Then
Kurth, Chiminello and Carruth would
probably round out the top six. In recent
matches Kurth and Chiminello have seen
action at No. 3 and No. 4 respectively and
could do so again. Most of the injured
starters will likely be pulled when Stan
ford plays USC Saturday.
"It's a real crap shoot," Brennan said.
Stanford dominated the last Card-
UCLA contest, an early March match,
which Stanford won 6-3. However, two
Cardinal losses were by default. Only
Woodhouse dropped a completed match,
losing in a third set tiebreaker to Hilt.

to wear around her upper left thigh.
Gone is the wrap and the limits on her
agility. In recent weeks, Poruri has rock
eted up the collegiate poll to No. 6.
The rest of the starters, Heather Wil
lens and Amy Chiminello, are healthy and
performing well according to Brennan.
Like Stanford, UCLA is suffering
through some injuries. Anne Mall won't
play due to a broken bone in her foot.
Paige Yaroshuck will likely play
although she was also recently on the
injured list.
While Bruin coach Bill Zaima has
been known to change players' positions
from week to week, he will need an extra

large eraser on his pencil when filling out
the lineup for today's match.
Doubles has also been thrown into dis
array as Jenny Baker has a sore shoulder
and won't pair up with Jenny Hilt at No. 2.
With the lineups scrambled, very few
matches are set. At No. 1, Willens battles
Mamie Ceniza. With Mall out, Zaima may
move up Cammie Foley, Lee Ann Ros
tovsky, Hilt and Baker.
With Johnson feeling better, she may
return to her normal slot at No. 3. Then
Kurth, Chiminello and Carruth would
probably round out the top six. In recent
matches Kurth and Chiminello have seen
action at No. 3 and No. 4 respectively and
could do so again. Most of the injured
starters will likely be pulled when Stan
ford plays USC Saturday.
"It's a real crap shoot," Brennan said.
Stanford dominated the last Card-
UCLA contest, an early March match,
which Stanford won 6-3. However, two
Cardinal losses were by default. Only
Woodhouse dropped a completed match,
losing in a third set tiebreaker to Hilt.
