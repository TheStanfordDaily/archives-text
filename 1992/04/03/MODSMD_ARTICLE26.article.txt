# Ruggers miss playoffs
## 
### Trevor Brown 
The Stanford rugby team's
run for a third consecutive Pacif
ic Coast Conference playoff
berth ended on Tuesday against
the Spartans of San Jose State.
The Cardinal (6-2-1), tied in PCC
play with Humboldt State, need
ed to defeat the Spartans by at
least 68 points to garner a post
season spot. Although the Card
was victorious, 34-7, the pesky
Spartans blighted Stanford's
play-off shot.
"To win by 68 points you need
to play the perfect game. Every
thing must go right," said senior
back-row Ed Stevens.
However, from the start it was
clear that this was not to be the
Card's perfect game. In the open
ing moments, the Spartans
zipped through a sleeping Cardi
nal defense to score the first try.
Down 4-0, Stanford now had 72
points to score.
The Card eventually pulled
together, lambasting the feisty
Spartans late in the game for 22
second-half points. Needless to
say, the late scoring barrage was
not enough as the Stanford rug
gers saw their bid for a playoff
berth disappear.
"Throughout the whole game,
I still thought we could do it.
There was always that glimmer

of hope," Stevens said.
Following the game, Stanford
head coach Franck Boivert
addressed his team, analyzing the
season. "I thought we prepared as
well as possible for all our games.
We just had some unlucky occur
rences, but that is what sport is
about. You win and you lose, and
who is to know. I think we played
to our potential, but we're stifled
by some unlucky breaks."
Although conference play is
finished, the Stanford ruggers
still have games to play. This
weekend the ruggers travel to
Southern California to compete
in the collegiate division of the
annual Santa Barbara tourna
ment. For the Card ruggers, it is
a chance to prove to the Pacific
Coast that they should be com
peting in the playoffs.
"We have a decision to make.
Do we want to go to Santa Bar
bara and show those teams from
California that we should be in
the playoffs or do you just want
to go have a good time?" asked
Boivert of his players.
The Card ruggers unanimous
ly agreed that Santa Barbara
should be a forum to display their
skills as a rugby team and
demonstrate to the rest of the
conference that they are as good
or better than many teams that
will compete in the postseason.
