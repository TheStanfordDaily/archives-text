Track:
The Stanford Track and
Field team will be at UC-Davis
this weekend participating in
the Texas Relays after holding
the Stanford Invite last week
end, which consisted of approx
imately 3000 athletes from the
ranks of high school, college,
and beyond.
Stanford will be hosting
home meets April 11 and 18.
The meets will be restricted to
collegiate athletes as the Cardi
nal is now preparing for the
Pacific 10 and NCAA Champi
onships. Stanford had been
allowing non-collegiate ath
letes like former NCAA ham
mer throw champion Robert
Weir and long-distance Olympic
hopeful Jeff Atkinson (a Stan
ford graduate) to compete in
their home meets in the early
part of the season.
Women's Volleyball:
Stanford women's volleyball
player Bev Oden went down to
Los Angeles at the beginning of
last quarter to work out with
the U.S. national team. Tomor
row night she will return to the
Bay Area with the National
team to play an exhibition
match against the China
national team at the Cow

Palace at 7:30 p.m.
Oden has an outside chance
to make the U.S. Olympic team
and play in Barcelona, and if
she did so, she would also make
volleyball history by being the
third member of her family to
be on the squad. Oden would
join her two sisters, Kim and
Elaine, which is an unprece
dented feat, said Stanford
coach Don Shaw.
"I've gotten nothing but
good reports about her [from
the coaches of the U.S. Nation
al team]," Shaw said. "She's
making the coaches' decisions
much harder."
Oden is still in the hunt for
an Olympic berth. The rosters
will probably not be set until
mid-June, Shaw said.
The United States and
China are two of the eight
teams which have qualified for
the Olympics so far; they have
split their series at one game
apiece so far, with China win
ning first, 3-1, and then the
U.S. winning 3-0.
"Both teams have a legiti
mate shot at getting a medal in
Spain," Shaw said. "It should
be some really good volleyball."
Tickets are available
through BASS Ticketmaster
outlets.
