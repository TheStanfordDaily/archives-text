# Batters play Big Game series

The Dumbarton Bridge series. The battle of the
batters of the bay. The No. 6-ranked Stanford Car
dinal takes on the Bears of Berkeley for a Six-Pac
conference three-game series. It's Zuber vs. Cornell,
Penix vs. Allen, and the rest of the Cardinal bats vs.
the rest of the Cal hitters. What about the pitching,
you say? Well, as far as pitching goes, the Bears are
one heck of a good hitting team. According to one
source, the Card is looking to do some serious dam
age.
The Card is 7-5 in the Six-Pac, and tied with Ari
zona State for second behind 6-3 Arizona. However,
unlike the Sun Devils and Wildcats, Stanford has
played only one home series, getting five of its seven
wins on the road.
Cal, as stated, has good hitting. They are led by
first baseman John Zuber, who is currently hitting
a gaudy .398, with 17 RBI and three long balls.
Junior Matt Luke (team leading .393 average last
year), who was invited to the Olympic trials last
summer, already has 25 RBI this year to go along
with four triples. Classmate Troy Penix (17 home
runs and a team leading 65 RBI last year) is also a
tremendous threat from the plate, as evidenced by
his 26 RBI and Six-Pac leading eight homers in 27
games.
Virtually every pitcher from the Bears '91 staff

is back this year. However, that doesn't say much
as the Bears pitching last year wasn't all that
great. Cal had a horrible 6.18 team ERA, and it is a
testament to the Bear hitting that the team still
won 37 games. Cal has some pesky relief pitchers in
Zuber (19 K's in 18 innings) and freshman Rob
Stone, but beyond that there are not many reliable
arms.
Stanford, however, has a load of good pitching.
Despite the slumping performances of Brian Sack
insky, the Cardinal has shown their pitching to be
as good, or maybe better, than everyone predicted.
Sophomore Willie Adams is pitching up a storm,
coming off an outstanding game against Arizona,
and Rick Helling has shown himself to be the most
dependable arm on the staff. And then there's
Jamie Sepeda, who would start just about anywhere
else in the nation. And with relievers Aaron Dorlar
que, Andrew Lorraine, and Tim Moore out of the
pen, Stanford has terrific depth.
From the plate, Stanford has been lighting it up.
Dave Cornell and Dusty Allen have established
themselves as two of the most talented hitters in
the conference, and Chris Kemper and Steve
Solomon are also continuing their performances as
persistent contact hitters who will get on base. Oh,
and then there's that Jeff Hammonds guy. He's
pretty good, too.
There should be plenty of hits for everyone in
these Big Games of baseball. Don't miss it.
