### Marie Save de Beaurecueil Staff writer 
The first issue of the student-edited Journal of
International Affairs was released this week cov
ers such diverse topics as the global democratic
trend, the Middle East and the post-Soviet drug
market in transition.
The Journal was modeled loosely after the
Stanford Journal of International Law as well as
two national publications, according to Editor in
Chief David Hsu.
However, he said, "We wanted it to be more
academic and include some more interesting, less
conventional topics."
The first issue includes a preface by Hoover Insti
tution Distinguished Fellow George Shultz and arti
cles written by a visiting professor from Japan, a
Hoover fellow, a Ph.D. candidate, a law student, a
Tulane University professor and an undergraduate.
"We were amazed by all the interest from peo
ple of such different backgrounds. We didn't
expect such an incredible response," said Eun
Hwa Lee, one of the editors.
"I'd like to see submissions from students and
professors around the United States and overseas
in the future," she added.
Hsu said he became interested in starting the

publication last year arid has since formed a group
of nine student editors.
"We felt that it would be a good means of hav
ing scholarly interaction between the faculty, stu
dents and outsiders about international issues,"
Hsu said.
"This is an effort for the advancement of inter
national studies among students, as well as oth
ers. This is particularly important in this increas
ingly interdependent world," he added.
The Journal also has benefits for the authors. It
"is a wonderful opportunity for students, under
graduates as well as graduates, to have their work
published," said senior Craig Parsons, who wrote
an article on French security policy.
The editors received assistance from several
Stanford faculty, who reviewed submissions. "We
looked at the articles for professional quality.
They needed to be interesting, yet accurate and
credible," said Timothy Josling, an adviser from
the Food Research Institute.
The editors hope to publish one issue per quar
ter and to distribute them to bookstores and other
universities, said editor Susan Long.
The publication received funds from the Stan
ford Department of International Relations, the
Arms Control Center at Stanford and the ASSU
Publications Board.
