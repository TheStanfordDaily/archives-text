# Starnes headed to L.A.
## Top Med School surgeon seeks 'more freedom' 
### John Ford Staff writer 
A last-ditch effort by the Medical
School to keep one of its top cardiac sur
geons failed yesterday when Dr. Vaughn
Starnes accepted a position at USC, saying
he wants to direct his own program.
Stanford made "the most generous
offer possible to try to encourage [StarnesJ
to remain at Stanford" during a meeting
yesterday, Medical School Dean David
Korn said in a statement.
But Starnes — a pioneer heart-lung
transplant — said he couldn't pass up the
chance to be chief of cardiac surgery at USC.
The Medical School administration had
been trying to negotiate a deal with
Starnes for the past several days, accord
ing to Statistics Prof. Gerald Lieberman,
who will replace departing Provost James
Rosse later this month. Lieberman was at
yesterday's meeting in the place of Uni

versity President Donald Kennedy.
"We all tried hard to keep him," he
said. Neither Lieberman nor Starnes
would comment on the nature of the Uni
versity's offer.
Starnes was the first surgeon in the
country to perform a live lung transplant
and has also performed a successful lung
transplant on a 17-day- old girl born with
one lung.
USC announced Wednesday that he
had officially accepted the position with
them, but Stanford officials responded by
insisting it was not a done deal.
"There was an attempt to keep me at
Stanford, and until I could see both sides,
they didn't want to say anything," Starnes
said. He said he decided to make the move
because "I felt like it would give me the
opportunity to direct my own program."
The new position will provide him with
"the resources to build a superb
academic program to train cardio
thoracic surgeons."
Starnes, head of the heart-lung
and lung transplant program in
the Department of Cardiothorac
tic Surgery since 1988, came to
Stanford in 1984 as the chief resi
dent in Cardiovascular Surgery.
The difference between his
new position and his Stanford job
is "the scale of what I have been
doing," Starnes said, noting that
he will have a chance to expand
the cardiovascular surgery pro
gram at USC's medical school.
Starnes has created a break
through surgical program that
gained national recognition.
"The program I set up at Stan
ford is the one I hope to duplicate
at USC and the Los Angeles Chil
dren's Hospital," he said.

Lieberman called Starnes "a
skillful cardiac surgeon and a
great faculty member."
"Without a doubt, it is a loss
for Stanford," he said.
Starnes' move is not unprece

dented, according to Medical
School spokesman Spyros
Andreopoulos. He said Starnes
was recruited because his prede
cessor left Stanford for a program
at Johns Hopkins University.
Andreopoulos said the Stan
ford program will maintain the
same quality after Starnes
leaves because "one of its hall
marks is the ability to train qual
ified surgeons" and recruit new
surgeons from the most elite
institutions.
Starnes earned his national rep
utation by performing the first par
tial lung transplant from a living
person in 1990, transferring tissue
from a mother to her daughter.
Last October, he completed the
first successful lung transplant on
an infant with diaphragmatic her
nia. He transplanted a lung from
a 6-week-old baby who had died
into Jacqueline Reed, who was
released from the Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital in
January.
