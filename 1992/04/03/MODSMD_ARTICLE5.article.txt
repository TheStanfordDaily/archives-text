# Fac Sen decides to wait for report on Bookstore
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate considered conducting its
own investigation of the Stanford Bookstore yes
terday, but decided to wait until the Bookstore's
internal report is released before taking any
action.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg, a member of the
senate, as well as the appointed spokesperson for
the Bookstore's board of directors, told the senate
that once the report is completed, he "would be
happy to appear before the senate to let you know
what the recommendations are."
The senate discussion was prompted by Politi
cal Science Prof. Terry Karl, who said she had
received three phone calls yesterday morning ask
ing her to raise the issue at the meeting.
"I convey the fact that a number of people are
very concerned about what this is doing to our rep
utation," she said.
The Daily disclosed Tuesday that the Bookstore
lost close to $2 million in the stock market last
year. In early February, The Daily revealed that
top management at the Bookstore enjoy a host of
perquisites unheard of in the industry, including
the free use of a vacation home, motor home, sail
boat and luxury automobiles.
The Bookstore's board of directors has already
begun an independent internal review of the non
profit corporation's business practices, and Weis
berg said the report should be released in three or
four weeks. The California Attor
ney General's office has also
opened a formal investigation.
"I am concerned that the
(internal) investigation will focus
more on legal and appropriate
business practices rather than
practices appropriate to the Uni
versity," said Biology Prof. Craig
Heller. "I am concerned that stu
dents, quite simply, are being
ripped off."
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center Prof. Martin Perl also
questioned the independence of
the internal investigation because
the outside lawyers and accoun
tants reviewing the business prac
tices were hired by the board itself.
Weisberg, however, said only
that the Bookstore board has "the
power to do anything" — including
implementation of the recommen

dations from the investigation.
"It is quite clear that what needs
to be done is an absolutely compre
hensive investigation," Weisberg
said. "There is no other way to

'I am concerned
that students, quite
simply, are being
ripped off.'
—Craig Heller

describe what is being done."
"I could not disagree with the gen
eral proposition that the voice of the
faculty should be heard," he said.
Weisberg briefly mentioned
various actions that might be rec
ommended by the investigation,
including the possibility of a com

plete restructuring of the Book
store's governance or "replacing
the entire charter."
Although no formal action was
taken, Senate Chair James Sheehan
said the steering committee will
treat the Bookstore as "an issue of
concern" and consider placing it on
the agenda at a future meeting.
Senate members said they
want to discuss the issue once the
report is completed.
Carolyn Lougee, senior associ
ate dean for the School of Human
ities and Sciences, questioned the
independent relationship between
the Bookstore and the University.
"While we may not have juris
diction, I am interested in the
arrangements between the Book
store and the University and the
implications of them," Lougee said.
Karl added that "it is important
for us to hear and closely follow
the results of the investigation . . .
of this monopoly on Stanford land
— one that helped besmirch our
reputation."
