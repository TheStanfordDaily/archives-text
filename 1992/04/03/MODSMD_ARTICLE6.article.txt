# Committee on academic policy created
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Hoping to exercise control
over the long-term issues
central to Stanford's academ
ic mission, the Faculty Sen
ate voted yesterday to create
a Planning and Policy Board
as a standing committee.
The board, whose mem
bers will be elected by the sen
ate for three-year terms, will
formulate academic policy
issues, examine long-term
trends and articulate Stan
ford's academic vision, accord
ing to yesterday's resolution.
Faculty members said
they hope the Planning and
Policy Board will allow fac
ulty leaders to confront the
deeper, long-term issues facing
the University rather than
responding to specific events and
shortcomings.
The creation of the board is
one of the most significant
changes in faculty governance of
Stanford since the the faculty cre
ated the the 55-member senate in
1968.
In its first years, the board will
likely study issues such as strate
gic academic planning, the impact
of intercollegiate athletics on
undergraduate education and the
balance between the arts, human
ities, sciences and professional
schools, according to Engineering
Prof. Joseph Goodman. Goodman
chairs the committee which rec
ommended the new body.
Carolyn Lougee, senior associ
ate dean of the School of Human
ities and Sciences, said after the

meeting that the board may also
discuss increasing enrollment of
graduate students relative to
undergraduates, which is often
mentioned as a solution to the
budget crisis.
The board will largely shape its
own role in the first years, Senate
Chair James Sheehan said, selec
tively choosing the topics it will
study.
The original proposal, rejected
in favor of the revised version,
would have put the board under
the jurisdiction of the Academic
Council, the group of all tenured
and tenure-track faculty.
At yesterday's meeting, some
professors repeated concerns that
the creation of a powerful new
body independent of the senate
would circumvent the senate's
authority and make decisions
without a broad faculty consensus.
But Lougee and Political Sci
ence Prof. Stephen Krasner said
the board would be too limited if
it merely reported to the senate.
"I'd prefer to take the chance

of having the committee take an
issue and run with it," Krasner
said. "That is our best shot for
having it do something signifi
cant."
The professors ultimately com
promised by adopting the revised
proposal, but they removed
phrasing which would have nar
rowed the body'B role to address
ing issues through the senate.
Faculty currently exercise gov
ernance of Stanford through the
senate, Advisory Board and Aca
demic Council Committees. The
Advisory Board approves all
appointments to the faculty, con
siders faculty grievances and
advises the president and provost.
The committees recommend poli
cy for senate action and oversee
administrative operations.
The board may make the sen
ate a more proactive body by
bringing the long-term issues to
its attention. At a previous senate
meeting Biology Prof. Craig
Heller said such a change might
also make meetings "less boring."
