# Former top cop teaches fictional crime
## 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
"You have the right to remain
silent."
Not many Stanford classes
begin with a former police chief
walking in, blowing a police

whistle and reading the class
their rights.
But at least one does — Joseph
McNamara's contemporary detec
tive fiction class, offered by the
Continuing Studies Program.
McNamara, former San Jose
police chief turned Hoover fel

low and the author of three best
selling detective novels, began
teaching at Stanford last night.
Nearly 100 students from all
over the Bay Area have enrolled
in his class to learn the art of
detective novels from an actual
detective.

"I haven't been in a classroom
in 20 years," said Karen Petter
son, a writer for a local newspa
per. "But I've read his books and
they're wonderful. I like his
characterizations."
McNamara's class is the most
popular of the 26 classes being
offered by the program this
quarter, according to Assoc.
Dean of Continuing Studies Jef
fery Wachtel.
"I was expecting a nice little
seminar of maybe 20 or 30 peo
ple, in a cozy room with a table,
discussing literature," joked
McNamara. "But I was stunned
to see the numbers."
Continuing Studies is a four
year-old program in which people
from the community may take
classes at Stanford for personal
enrichment. The students may
also work toward a recently
approved master's of liberal arts
degree. This quarter, the program
has about 700 students enrolled.
Mark Brady, a psychologist,
said he is "interested in [McNa
mara's] writing process. He's
definitely part of the draw."
McNamara said he is trying to
stimulate his own writing
through teaching the class.
"I was trying to get started on
another detective novel and just
found that I wasn't moving
ahead when Continuing Studies
called and asked if I would teach
this course on detective fiction,"
he said. "I said sure — that's
fun, that's stimulating."

Joseph McNamara, the former San Jose police chief who is now a fellow at the Hoover Institution,
lectures his Continuing Studies class on detective fiction last night.
He had rejected an earlier
request to teach a class on crimi
nal justice. "That's too much like
work," he said.
In his class, McNamara will
explore the use of plot, character,
dialogue and setting as devices to
hold the reader's interest.
"We'll look at the process of
writing, and writing as a busi
ness," McNamara told his class
last night. "What makes a writer
tick? We'll find out."
His connections as a former
police officer and novelist have
enabled him to invite published
mystery writers, a crack homicide
detective and an FBI agent to
speak to the class.

After his years as a police offi
cer in Harlem, New York and as
police chief in Kansas City and
San Jose, McNamara is convinced
that truth is stranger than fiction.
"One of the things I sort of
lamented as a novelist is that,
after Watergate, what can a poor
novelist do?" asked McNamara.
"If you had gone to a publisher a
year before Watergate with a
manuscript in which the president
of the United States was drummed
out of office, the attorney general —
the highest ranking law enforce
ment officer in the land — was sent
to prison for three years and the
director of the FBI had to plead
guilty to a misdemeanor and resign,
all over a two-bit burglary, you
would have been laughed out of the
office."
McNamara, who holds a doc
torate in Public Administration

from Harvard, said he began writ
ing "as therapy" to counteract the
stresses of police duty.
"As police chief, there are a lot
of restrictions on what you can do
and what you can say," he said.
"But I found that my characters
can say anything,... things that if
I would have said publicly might
not have been well-received."
But McNamara has not been
one to avoid controversy. He oppos
es the police "war on drugs," he is
an advocate of gun control and he
called for the resignation of Los
Angeles police chief Daryl Gates
after the Rodney King beating.
His liberal politics have
angered politicians, police officers
and even the National Rifle Asso
ciation, which once took out a
full-page advertisement in USA
Today to berate McNamara for
his stand on gun control.

selling detective novels, began
teaching at Stanford last night.
Nearly 100 students from all
over the Bay Area have enrolled
in his class to learn the art of
detective novels from an actual
detective.

"I haven't been in a classroom
in 20 years," said Karen Petter
son, a writer for a local newspa
per. "But I've read his books and
they're wonderful. I like his
characterizations."
McNamara's class is the most
popular of the 26 classes being
offered by the program this
quarter, according to Assoc.
Dean of Continuing Studies Jef
fery Wachtel.
"I was expecting a nice little
seminar of maybe 20 or 30 peo
ple, in a cozy room with a table,
discussing literature," joked
McNamara. "But I was stunned
to see the numbers."
Continuing Studies is a four
year-old program in which people
from the community may take
classes at Stanford for personal
enrichment. The students may
also work toward a recently
approved master's of liberal arts
degree. This quarter, the program
has about 700 students enrolled.
Mark Brady, a psychologist,
said he is "interested in [McNa
mara's] writing process. He's
definitely part of the draw."
McNamara said he is trying to
stimulate his own writing
through teaching the class.
"I was trying to get started on
another detective novel and just
found that I wasn't moving
ahead when Continuing Studies
called and asked if I would teach
this course on detective fiction,"
he said. "I said sure — that's
fun, that's stimulating."

Joseph McNamara, the former San Jose police chief who is now a fellow at the Hoover Institution,
lectures his Continuing Studies class on detective fiction last night.
He had rejected an earlier
request to teach a class on crimi
nal justice. "That's too much like
work," he said.
In his class, McNamara will
explore the use of plot, character,
dialogue and setting as devices to
hold the reader's interest.
"We'll look at the process of
writing, and writing as a busi
ness," McNamara told his class
last night. "What makes a writer
tick? We'll find out."
His connections as a former
police officer and novelist have
enabled him to invite published
mystery writers, a crack homicide
detective and an FBI agent to
speak to the class.

After his years as a police offi
cer in Harlem, New York and as
police chief in Kansas City and
San Jose, McNamara is convinced
that truth is stranger than fiction.
"One of the things I sort of
lamented as a novelist is that,
after Watergate, what can a poor
novelist do?" asked McNamara.
"If you had gone to a publisher a
year before Watergate with a
manuscript in which the president
of the United States was drummed
out of office, the attorney general —
the highest ranking law enforce
ment officer in the land — was sent
to prison for three years and the
director of the FBI had to plead
guilty to a misdemeanor and resign,
all over a two-bit burglary, you
would have been laughed out of the
office."
McNamara, who holds a doc
torate in Public Administration

from Harvard, said he began writ
ing "as therapy" to counteract the
stresses of police duty.
"As police chief, there are a lot
of restrictions on what you can do
and what you can say," he said.
"But I found that my characters
can say anything,... things that if
I would have said publicly might
not have been well-received."
But McNamara has not been
one to avoid controversy. He oppos
es the police "war on drugs," he is
an advocate of gun control and he
called for the resignation of Los
Angeles police chief Daryl Gates
after the Rodney King beating.
His liberal politics have
angered politicians, police officers
and even the National Rifle Asso
ciation, which once took out a
full-page advertisement in USA
Today to berate McNamara for
his stand on gun control.
