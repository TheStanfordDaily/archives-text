# Former top cop teaches fictional crime

"You have the right to remain
silent."
Not many Stanford classes
begin with a former police chief
walking in, blowing a police

whistle and reading the class
their rights.
But at least one does — Joseph
McNamara's contemporary detec
tive fiction class, offered by the
Continuing Studies Program.
McNamara, former San Jose
police chief turned Hoover fel

low and the author of three best
selling detective novels, began
teaching at Stanford last night.
Nearly 100 students from all
over the Bay Area have enrolled
in his class to learn the art of
detective novels from an actual
detective.

"I haven't been in a classroom
in 20 years," said Karen Petter
son, a writer for a local newspa
per. "But I've read his books and
they're wonderful. I like his
characterizations."
McNamara's class is the most
popular of the 26 classes being
offered by the program this
quarter, according to Assoc.
Dean of Continuing Studies Jef
fery Wachtel.
"I was expecting a nice little
seminar of maybe 20 or 30 peo
ple, in a cozy room with a table,
discussing literature," joked
McNamara. "But I was stunned
to see the numbers."
Continuing Studies is a four
year-old program in which people
from the community may take
classes at Stanford for personal
enrichment. The students may
also work toward a recently
approved master's of liberal arts
degree. This quarter, the program
has about 700 students enrolled.
Mark Brady, a psychologist,
said he is "interested in [McNa
mara's] writing process. He's
definitely part of the draw."
McNamara said he is trying to
stimulate his own writing
through teaching the class.
"I was trying to get started on
another detective novel and just
found that I wasn't moving
ahead when Continuing Studies
called and asked if I would teach
this course on detective fiction,"
he said. "I said sure — that's
fun, that's stimulating."
