# Two Stanford students awarded Truman Scholarships
## 
### Michael McCarroll 
Sophomore Allison Moore and junior
Sherri Wolson have been named 1992
Truman Scholars.
The scholarship, awarded to students
who plan a career in public service,
includes up to $30,000 tuition and
expenses for the senior undergraduate
year and the costs of three years of grad
uate study.
Moore and Wolson, both public policy
majors, were among 75 recipients chosen
from more than 1200 students nationwide.
Applicants were nominated for the scholar
ship by their colleges and universities.
The scholarships are among the most
prestigious in the country, ranking just
behind Rhodes and Marshall scholar
ships, according to Political Science Prof.

Hubert Marshall. Marshall is the chair of
Stanford's nominating committee.
Moore also received a Chap pell-Lou gee
grant in the fall for her research in chil
dren's policy. She plans to pursue a law
degree or a doctoral degree in public policy.
She worked as an intern for the Mas
sachusetts State Legislature and served
as regional chair for the Student Adviso
ry Council to the Massachusetts State
Board of Education. Moore is a member
of College Republicans For Choice and a
research assistant at the Institute for
Research on Women and Gender.
Wolson plans to attend a graduate pro
gram combining law and public policy.
She said she will work in the public poli
cy arena, dealing with issues of women
and family or with urban issues.
For her, the scholarship program is

valuable because it encourages students
to pursue careers in public service.
"There are lots of incentives to go into
the private sector," she said. "This schol
arship is important because it encourages
public sector involvement."

'Yale is our main competi
tor and we're now three
[scholarships] ahead of
them.'

Now the chair of Stanford in Govern
ment, Wolson served as director of the SIG

Public Policy Forum last year. She also
organized the Reach Out Today project
with Bay Area soup kitchens as communi
ty service chair for the Chi Omega sorority.
Stanford's three nominees, Moore,
Wolson and senior Scott Cooper, were
selected by a committee consisting of
VTSS Assoc. Chair Robert McGinn, Eco
nomics Prof. Gavin Wright and Marshall.
The committee looked for extensive
involvement and serious commitment to
the public sector through extracurricular
activities and internships, Marshall said.
The Harry S Truman Scholarship
Foundation was created by Congress in
1975 in memory of the former president.
Marshall said Stanford nominees have
been extremely successful in the scholar
ship competition. Over the past 12 years,
24 of Stanford's 30 nominees have

received scholarships. "We have the best
record in the country," said Marshall.
Marshall attributed Stanford's success to
an atmosphere conducive to public service.
"There is somewhat more interest around
here in public service," Marshall said.
He cited the Haas Center and SIG as
examples of programs providing students
with opportunities for government and
community involvement.
Approximately 20 students applied in
early November to be among Stanford's
three nominees, according to Marshall.
Students need a minimum 3.6 GPA to
apply for the scholarship, and have to sub
mit two essays on public policy and career
plans, along with a recommendation. Typ
ically, students provide an extensive list of
community service work and political
activity as well, Marshall said.
