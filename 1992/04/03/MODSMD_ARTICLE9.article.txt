Tensions rise in Libya
TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) — Young Libyans with firebombs sacked
the Venezuelan Embassy and tried to storm the Russian mission
yesterday during a day of protests aimed at countries that voted
for a U.N. air and arms embargo on Libya.
Diplomats said the attacks, and noisy demonstrations held out
side other embassies, appeared to have been orchestrated by Col.
Moammar Gadhafi's government.
U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering told reporters that
Libya had "offered profuse apologies with crocodile tears. It does
not seem this means too much."

terday fired Yegor Gaidar, the chief architect of his free-market
reforms, just days before hostile lawmakers convene to consider

appeared unlikely to signal a major shift in Russia's painful drive
toward a market economy.
