'EL'ECTIO'HS
The ASSU Spring General Election will
be held on Wednesday, April 15 and
Thursday, April 16 at polling sites all over
campus.
Next year's Council of Presidents, Senior
Class Presidents, Senate, Student Conduct
Legislative Council, and Special Fees will all
be determined. Additionally, a number of
non-binding referenda will appear on the
ballot. '
You must vote to be eligible for 1992-93
fee refunds!
The "official" ASSU Election Handbook
(not the Chappie one) will be available
Wednesday at Daily distribution points. It
will include complete information on polling
sites, candidates, and questions to appear on
the ballot.
The Elections Commission is still hiring
pollwatchers for the 15th and 16th. If you are
interested, please call Judy Wu at 3-2839.
Campaigning will begin on Wednesday
and is being monitored by the Hearing
Officer, Jason Moore. Any rules violations
(fliers in the Quad, campaigning within 50
yds. of a polling site, etc.) can be reported to
him at 7-4167.
Spotlight: Legislative Branch
The legislative organ of the ASSU is the
student Senate. The Senate consists of forty
senators elected annually in the Spring
Election. The Senate is responsible for:
• approving funding to student groups
• confirming elections and nominations
• approving the ASSU budget
• overseeing Association projects and
finances
• changing the Association By-Laws
• setting the Spring Ballot
• interpreting the ASSU Constitution
• approving changes to the Stanford
Legislative and Judicial Charter
Last, but not least, the Senate can pass
resolutions by majority vote about anything
it wants that directly affects Stanford stu
dents, yet these resolutions are typically non
binding.
The Senate meets bi-weekly on Tuesday
nights in Law 190. Meetings are open to the
public.
During weeks without meetings, Senate
Committees meet. Each Senator belongs to
one of the Senate's five standing committees.
They are Administration and Rules (AR),
Appropriations (AP), Budget and Finance
(BF), Education, Research, and Residences
(ERR), and Student Affairs (SA).
Senators are elected in districts. There
are 20 undergraduates and 20 graduates.
The graduates are further divided: 6 from
Humanities, Sciences, and Education; 6 from
the Business, Law, and Medical schools; arid
8 from Engineering and Earth Sciences. In
order to guarantee voting among districts
despite absenteeism, only the top ten grads
and top tenundergrads present may vote on
any question. The Chair of the Senate may
vote when his or her vote is decisive.
Three positions in the Senate are paid:
Chair $4100 per year, Deputy Chair $2000,
and Appropriations Committee Chair $1600.
The deadline for this year's ballot has
passed. But you can still run a write-in
campaign as long as you agree to abide by all
the campaign rules and declare your intent.
A few reminders.

• Funding Deadline Today! VSOs wishing
to request funding from the ASSU Program
Board or the ASSU Community Service Board
for Spring events must submit funding ap
plications TODAY by 5 p.m..
• Groups wishing to request funding from
the ASSU Program Board or the ASSU Com
munity Service Board for (up to $6000) 1992-
93 annual programs
must submit funding applications on or
before April 27.
• Fee Refunds: The ASSU's ground-breaking
computer fee refund system is finally almost
working adequately. Winter Quarter checks
were sent out during finals week. (Needless
to say, if you haven't received what you
applied for, come to the ASSU Business Office
at once!) If you do nothing, in late May you
will receive a refund from the same groups
as you did last quarter. Requests may be
changed or updated until Friday, April 17 in
the ASSU Business office.
ASSU UPDATE
The Council of Presidents would like to
congratulate Gerhard Casper on his recent
appointment. We hope to schedule a May
meeting with next year's COP, President
Kennedy, and ourselves to ensure continued
student communication with University
administration.
We'd like to report the following
developments from this past quarter:
After much pressure, the University has
agreed not to implement a separate Health
Fee.
The COP workingthrough the Housing
Operations Advisory Committee (HOAC)
has secured a guarantee that the dormitory
storage policy will remain unchanged for
this Summer.
Dean of Students Michael Jackson has offered
the ASSU ownership of the Directory project
in exchange for continued funding of Sexual
Assault Prevention Education and
Response. The Directory project yeilds
significant profits which can be used to
continue Lake Lagunita support as well as
hire a half-time professional to coordinate
the Sexual Assault Resource Center.
The ASSU Course Guide has returned! The
Spring Quarter edition is a trial guide to peak
student interest andremind them to fill out
evaluation forms. If you have not yet received
a copy, drop by the ASSU offices and pick
one up.
This year's COP has been working with
representatives from the Stanford Outdoor
Education Project to develop an optional
pre-orientation outdoor education program.
Students from the Public Service Center and
candidates fro next year's COP have become
interested and various hybrid proposals are
being discussed.
Finally, discussions on tuition increases for
'93-'94 versus increases in endowment payout
are proceeding. Several ASSU represntatives
received a long-awaited opportunity to
express their concerns to a large group of
Trustees. Although signs from the Board of
Trustees and Dr. Casper are encouraging, no
final resolution is expected this quarter.

The ASSU Spring General Election will
be held on Wednesday, April 15 and
Thursday, April 16 at polling sites all over
campus.
Next year's Council of Presidents, Senior
Class Presidents, Senate, Student Conduct
Legislative Council, and Special Fees will all
be determined. Additionally, a number of
non-binding referenda will appear on the
ballot. '
You must vote to be eligible for 1992-93
fee refunds!
The "official" ASSU Election Handbook
(not the Chappie one) will be available
Wednesday at Daily distribution points. It
will include complete information on polling
sites, candidates, and questions to appear on
the ballot.
The Elections Commission is still hiring
pollwatchers for the 15th and 16th. If you are
interested, please call Judy Wu at 3-2839.
Campaigning will begin on Wednesday
and is being monitored by the Hearing
Officer, Jason Moore. Any rules violations
(fliers in the Quad, campaigning within 50
yds. of a polling site, etc.) can be reported to
him at 7-4167.
Spotlight: Legislative Branch
The legislative organ of the ASSU is the
student Senate. The Senate consists of forty
senators elected annually in the Spring
Election. The Senate is responsible for:
• approving funding to student groups
• confirming elections and nominations
• approving the ASSU budget
• overseeing Association projects and
finances
• changing the Association By-Laws
• setting the Spring Ballot
• interpreting the ASSU Constitution
• approving changes to the Stanford
Legislative and Judicial Charter
Last, but not least, the Senate can pass
resolutions by majority vote about anything
it wants that directly affects Stanford stu
dents, yet these resolutions are typically non
binding.
The Senate meets bi-weekly on Tuesday
nights in Law 190. Meetings are open to the
public.
During weeks without meetings, Senate
Committees meet. Each Senator belongs to
one of the Senate's five standing committees.
They are Administration and Rules (AR),
Appropriations (AP), Budget and Finance
(BF), Education, Research, and Residences
(ERR), and Student Affairs (SA).
Senators are elected in districts. There
are 20 undergraduates and 20 graduates.
The graduates are further divided: 6 from
Humanities, Sciences, and Education; 6 from
the Business, Law, and Medical schools; arid
8 from Engineering and Earth Sciences. In
order to guarantee voting among districts
despite absenteeism, only the top ten grads
and top tenundergrads present may vote on
any question. The Chair of the Senate may
vote when his or her vote is decisive.
Three positions in the Senate are paid:
Chair $4100 per year, Deputy Chair $2000,
and Appropriations Committee Chair $1600.
The deadline for this year's ballot has
passed. But you can still run a write-in
campaign as long as you agree to abide by all
the campaign rules and declare your intent.
A few reminders.

• Funding Deadline Today! VSOs wishing
to request funding from the ASSU Program
Board or the ASSU Community Service Board
for Spring events must submit funding ap
plications TODAY by 5 p.m..
• Groups wishing to request funding from
the ASSU Program Board or the ASSU Com
munity Service Board for (up to $6000) 1992-
93 annual programs
must submit funding applications on or
before April 27.
• Fee Refunds: The ASSU's ground-breaking
computer fee refund system is finally almost
working adequately. Winter Quarter checks
were sent out during finals week. (Needless
to say, if you haven't received what you
applied for, come to the ASSU Business Office
at once!) If you do nothing, in late May you
will receive a refund from the same groups
as you did last quarter. Requests may be
changed or updated until Friday, April 17 in
the ASSU Business office.
ASSU UPDATE
The Council of Presidents would like to
congratulate Gerhard Casper on his recent
appointment. We hope to schedule a May
meeting with next year's COP, President
Kennedy, and ourselves to ensure continued
student communication with University
administration.
We'd like to report the following
developments from this past quarter:
After much pressure, the University has
agreed not to implement a separate Health
Fee.
The COP workingthrough the Housing
Operations Advisory Committee (HOAC)
has secured a guarantee that the dormitory
storage policy will remain unchanged for
this Summer.
Dean of Students Michael Jackson has offered
the ASSU ownership of the Directory project
in exchange for continued funding of Sexual
Assault Prevention Education and
Response. The Directory project yeilds
significant profits which can be used to
continue Lake Lagunita support as well as
hire a half-time professional to coordinate
the Sexual Assault Resource Center.
The ASSU Course Guide has returned! The
Spring Quarter edition is a trial guide to peak
student interest andremind them to fill out
evaluation forms. If you have not yet received
a copy, drop by the ASSU offices and pick
one up.
This year's COP has been working with
representatives from the Stanford Outdoor
Education Project to develop an optional
pre-orientation outdoor education program.
Students from the Public Service Center and
candidates fro next year's COP have become
interested and various hybrid proposals are
being discussed.
Finally, discussions on tuition increases for
'93-'94 versus increases in endowment payout
are proceeding. Several ASSU represntatives
received a long-awaited opportunity to
express their concerns to a large group of
Trustees. Although signs from the Board of
Trustees and Dr. Casper are encouraging, no
final resolution is expected this quarter.

The ASSU Spring General Election will
be held on Wednesday, April 15 and
Thursday, April 16 at polling sites all over
campus.
Next year's Council of Presidents, Senior
Class Presidents, Senate, Student Conduct
Legislative Council, and Special Fees will all
be determined. Additionally, a number of
non-binding referenda will appear on the
ballot. '
You must vote to be eligible for 1992-93
fee refunds!
The "official" ASSU Election Handbook
(not the Chappie one) will be available
Wednesday at Daily distribution points. It
will include complete information on polling
sites, candidates, and questions to appear on
the ballot.
The Elections Commission is still hiring
pollwatchers for the 15th and 16th. If you are

Campaigning will begin on Wednesday
and is being monitored by the Hearing
Officer, Jason Moore. Any rules violations
(fliers in the Quad, campaigning within 50
yds. of a polling site, etc.) can be reported to
him at 7-4167.
Spotlight: Legislative Branch
The legislative organ of the ASSU is the
student Senate. The Senate consists of forty
senators elected annually in the Spring
Election. The Senate is responsible for:
• approving funding to student groups
• confirming elections and nominations
• approving the ASSU budget
• overseeing Association projects and
finances
• changing the Association By-Laws
• setting the Spring Ballot
• interpreting the ASSU Constitution
• approving changes to the Stanford
Legislative and Judicial Charter
Last, but not least, the Senate can pass
resolutions by majority vote about anything
it wants that directly affects Stanford stu
dents, yet these resolutions are typically non
binding.
The Senate meets bi-weekly on Tuesday
nights in Law 190. Meetings are open to the
public.
During weeks without meetings, Senate
Committees meet. Each Senator belongs to
one of the Senate's five standing committees.
They are Administration and Rules (AR),
Appropriations (AP), Budget and Finance
(BF), Education, Research, and Residences
(ERR), and Student Affairs (SA).
Senators are elected in districts. There
are 20 undergraduates and 20 graduates.
The graduates are further divided: 6 from
Humanities, Sciences, and Education; 6 from
the Business, Law, and Medical schools; arid
8 from Engineering and Earth Sciences. In
order to guarantee voting among districts
despite absenteeism, only the top ten grads
and top tenundergrads present may vote on
any question. The Chair of the Senate may
vote when his or her vote is decisive.
Three positions in the Senate are paid:
Chair $4100 per year, Deputy Chair $2000,
and Appropriations Committee Chair $1600.
The deadline for this year's ballot has
passed. But you can still run a write-in
campaign as long as you agree to abide by all
the campaign rules and declare your intent.
A few reminders.

at once!) If you do nothing, in late May you

ASSU UPDATE
The Council of Presidents would like to
congratulate Gerhard Casper on his recent
appointment. We hope to schedule a May
meeting with next year's COP, President
Kennedy, and ourselves to ensure continued
student communication with University
administration.
We'd like to report the following
developments from this past quarter:
After much pressure, the University has
agreed not to implement a separate Health
Fee.
The COP workingthrough the Housing
Operations Advisory Committee (HOAC)
has secured a guarantee that the dormitory
storage policy will remain unchanged for
this Summer.
Dean of Students Michael Jackson has offered
the ASSU ownership of the Directory project
in exchange for continued funding of Sexual
Assault Prevention Education and
Response. The Directory project yeilds
significant profits which can be used to
continue Lake Lagunita support as well as
hire a half-time professional to coordinate
the Sexual Assault Resource Center.
The ASSU Course Guide has returned! The
Spring Quarter edition is a trial guide to peak
student interest andremind them to fill out
evaluation forms. If you have not yet received
a copy, drop by the ASSU offices and pick
one up.
This year's COP has been working with
representatives from the Stanford Outdoor
Education Project to develop an optional
pre-orientation outdoor education program.
Students from the Public Service Center and
candidates fro next year's COP have become
interested and various hybrid proposals are
being discussed.
Finally, discussions on tuition increases for
'93-'94 versus increases in endowment payout
are proceeding. Several ASSU represntatives
received a long-awaited opportunity to
express their concerns to a large group of
Trustees. Although signs from the Board of
Trustees and Dr. Casper are encouraging, no
final resolution is expected this quarter.
