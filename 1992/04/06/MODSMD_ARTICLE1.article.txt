# Just Did It
## Women take second NCAA title in three years 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — Walking out of the Los Angeles
Sports Arena yesterday, Val Whiting looked like some
one coming home after a day at the office, carrying a
briefcase hooked under one arm. But the "briefcase"
was a trophy, and the business she and her Cardinal
teammates had just completed was winning the 1992
NCAA Women's Basketball National Championship.
Stanford won its second title in three years by beating
Virginia, 66-65, in a come-from-behind thriller on Saturday
and then crushing Western Kentucky, 78-62, yesterday.
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer said after yesterday's
game that the team had fulfilled almost all of its goals this
year — "To win the [Pacific 10 Conference], to win 30
games and win the national championship. The latest
goal, which we haven't reached yet, is to go on Arsenio."
Paul Sanderford, the head coach of the underdog
Lady Toppers, argued that not completing his own goal
of winning the title made his season a failure.
"I hate to even go talk to the fans and my friends and
family," he said, "because they're all going to say, 'Oh,
you had a great year, you went to the Final Four, blah,
blah, blah, blah.' I want to win it."
Two other teams wanted that as well. Southwest Mis
souri State was on a quest to gain national respect. Virginia
had lost in the semifinals to Stanford two years ago and in
the final to Tennessee last year in overtime. The Cavaliers
were on a mission from the first tip-off of the year.
But at Stanford's season-opening tip-off, few people
had any idea how far the team could go. "On the first day
of practice," VanDerveer said, "one of my assistants
turned to me and said, 'We're going to be .500 this year.'"

"I said, 'Over my dead body.'"
The Cardinal had been ranked No. 7 by most publi
cations. Street and Smith's reflected the general con
sensus: "The Cardinal is rebuilding," it read.
"I never heard of that rebuilding thing," Whiting
said yesterday. "That must have just been something
between the coaches and the press."
But VanDerveer denied any allegations that she had
fixed the dreaded "rebuilding" epithet to this season.
To Sanderford, the Cardinal's youth was irrelevant.
"We just got beat by a better basketball team today," he
said. "The thing that makes them so great is the way
they play well together. . .They are a great credit to
women's basketball, a great national champion."
Throughout the season, the Stanford players and
coaches reported that the relationship on the team was
as tight and the chemistry was as good as ever. Things
which, not so coincidentally, were characteristic of the
1990 national championship team.
Like that team, this year's squad faced the Cavaliers
in the semifinal round. Many observers felt that this
year's matchup between the No. 1 and No. 3 teams in the
country would decide the champion. They were right.
The game began as many predicted — with Virginia
outscoring Stanford. By the middle of the first half, the Cavs
led, 16-8. But it was to be their largest lead of the game.
At that point Molly Goodenbour caught a bad case of
kleptomania. She stole the ball four times in the next 10
minutes and finished with five for the game.
Goodenbour's steals sparked the Cardinal offense,
which was comprised mostly of Kodak All-America
Whiting. Whiting scored 10 points in the first half, and


Ben Tong — Daily
played impeccable defense.
Despite their 6-foot-5 height, the Cavs' Twin Towers,
Heather and Heidi Burge, had difficulty putting the ball
in the basket. Whiting, with her strength and intelligent
play, stifled them.
Meanwhile, the rest of Virginia was having similar
problems. Even Tammi Reiss, the Cavaliers' All-Ameri
ca shooting guard, could not find the net.
Only two-time Naismith Player of the Year Dawn
Staley seemed to be effective offensively, scoring 11
first-half points on humanly impossible moves.
Yet the Cavs led, 29-27, at the half, primarily because
they were so effective cleaning the boards that the fans
could almost hear squeaks on the glass. In the first peri
od Virginia collected 30 rebounds to Stanford's 16.
The second half began much like the first. By the
midway point, Virginia was again leading by eight
points. But at about that time VanDerveer showed both
guts and confidence by inserting freshman point guard
Kate Paye into the game.
"Kate is a very smart player," said the coach. "We
needed to play smarter."
Paye stayed in the rest of the game, and it was evi
dent that her three California Division V high school
championships served her well psychologically.. Always
calm, the freshman directed the Cardinal comeback
alongside Goodenbour.
She also worked Staley defensively, holding the explo
sive guard to a mere smoulder.
Immediately after Paye entered the game, Gooden
bour hit a three-pointer. A few minutes later, with Stan
ford again down by eight, Goodenbour nailed two threes
in 30 seconds. Suddenly the partisan crowd was going
bananas, rocking the arena.
"When Molly hit that three, that's when we got the
momentum for good," VanDerveer said. Goodenbour
finished the tournament with 18 three-point baskets,
shattering Jennifer Azzi's record of 14 set two years ago.
But Stanford didn't get a lead until the clock read
1:42, when Whiting's two free throws put the Cardinal
up 65-63. Then a Kelly Dougherty free throw gave Stan-

ford its largest lead of the game at three
points. It was all that they needed.
The last second of the game was a con
fusing one, but it had no effect on the
match's outcome. The Cavs called a timeout
before the buzzer sounded, but one official
waved it off, deciding that the two events
were so close as to be considered simultane
ous.
As that official ran off of the court, Staley
ran after him arguing. She could not believe
her collegiate career was over. As it turned
out, it wasn't. The other official decided that
0.8 seconds should be put back on the clock.
But the Cavs, who inbounded from mid
court, could not duplicate Georgia Tech's
men's tournament miracle finish against
use.
After the game, Staley refused to see
reporters and was inconsolable. The winner
of every conceivable women's basketball
award, the one thing she wanted — a
national championship — had eluded her
again.
Western Kentucky's Kim Pehlke, who,
like Staley, was named to the all-tourna
ment team, was not quite as mournful.
Though disappointed in the final outcome,

Photography by Rajiv Chandrasekaran
and Benjamin Tong

the senior guard said, "It-was a dream come true just to
get here."
Pehlke had scored a career-high 30 points on Satur
day against Southwest Missouri State, but was limited
to 16 against Stanford.
The Cardinal simply overwhelmed the Toppers, out
rebounding and outshooring them. Stanford posted a
37-27 intermission lead and pushed its margin to as
much as 24 in the second half.
The Toppers almost made a game of it, though, as
they came back to within nine with 2:33 left. But Stan
ford hit free throws down the stretch to secure the final
margin.
"Fatigue was part of the problem," Sanderford said.
"Stanford's defense was part of the problem. But we
were getting shots we wanted. We just couldn't get them
to fall."
In a game played only about 24 hours after the semi
finals, conditioning played a huge role in the outcome.
"With about four minutes to go in the first half, I
noticed our players really starting to drag," Sanderford
said.
"All those sprint drills I called stupid, all those 7 a.m.
workouts — they all paid off/' Whiting said.
Sanderford also credited the play of Goodenbour and
Rachel Hemmer. Both were named all-tournament, as
was Whiting. Goodenbour, who played two of the best
games of her career, was the sparkplug of the Cardinal
all weekend. A week after being named the MVP of the
West Regional, Goodenbour received the same honor for
the Final Four.
But VanDerveer, who thanked the Stanford fans and
the athletic department and administration, gave a big
credit to someone behind the scenes.
"We have the best trainer in the world in Karen Mid
dleton. We would not be here if it weren't for her. Health
and attitude were the two biggest keys for us this year."

Paye stayed in the rest of the game, and it was evi
dent that her three California Division V high school
championships served her well psychologically.. Always
calm, the freshman directed the Cardinal comeback
alongside Goodenbour.
She also worked Staley defensively, holding the explo
sive guard to a mere smoulder.
Immediately after Paye entered the game, Gooden
bour hit a three-pointer. A few minutes later, with Stan
ford again down by eight, Goodenbour nailed two threes
in 30 seconds. Suddenly the partisan crowd was going
bananas, rocking the arena.
"When Molly hit that three, that's when we got the
momentum for good," VanDerveer said. Goodenbour
finished the tournament with 18 three-point baskets,
shattering Jennifer Azzi's record of 14 set two years ago.
But Stanford didn't get a lead until the clock read
1:42, when Whiting's two free throws put the Cardinal
up 65-63. Then a Kelly Dougherty free throw gave Stan-

ford its largest lead of the game at three
points. It was all that they needed.
The last second of the game was a con
fusing one, but it had no effect on the
match's outcome. The Cavs called a timeout
before the buzzer sounded, but one official
waved it off, deciding that the two events
were so close as to be considered simultane
ous.
As that official ran off of the court, Staley
ran after him arguing. She could not believe
her collegiate career was over. As it turned
out, it wasn't. The other official decided that
0.8 seconds should be put back on the clock.
But the Cavs, who inbounded from mid
court, could not duplicate Georgia Tech's
men's tournament miracle finish against
use.
After the game, Staley refused to see
reporters and was inconsolable. The winner
of every conceivable women's basketball
award, the one thing she wanted — a
national championship — had eluded her
again.
Western Kentucky's Kim Pehlke, who,
like Staley, was named to the all-tourna
ment team, was not quite as mournful.
Though disappointed in the final outcome,

and Benjamin Tong

the senior guard said, "It-was a dream come true just to
get here."
Pehlke had scored a career-high 30 points on Satur
day against Southwest Missouri State, but was limited
to 16 against Stanford.
The Cardinal simply overwhelmed the Toppers, out
rebounding and outshooring them. Stanford posted a
37-27 intermission lead and pushed its margin to as
much as 24 in the second half.
The Toppers almost made a game of it, though, as
they came back to within nine with 2:33 left. But Stan
ford hit free throws down the stretch to secure the final
margin.
"Fatigue was part of the problem," Sanderford said.
"Stanford's defense was part of the problem. But we
were getting shots we wanted. We just couldn't get them
to fall."
In a game played only about 24 hours after the semi
finals, conditioning played a huge role in the outcome.
"With about four minutes to go in the first half, I
noticed our players really starting to drag," Sanderford
said.
"All those sprint drills I called stupid, all those 7 a.m.
workouts — they all paid off/' Whiting said.
Sanderford also credited the play of Goodenbour and
Rachel Hemmer. Both were named all-tournament, as
was Whiting. Goodenbour, who played two of the best
games of her career, was the sparkplug of the Cardinal
all weekend. A week after being named the MVP of the
West Regional, Goodenbour received the same honor for
the Final Four.
But VanDerveer, who thanked the Stanford fans and
the athletic department and administration, gave a big
credit to someone behind the scenes.
"We have the best trainer in the world in Karen Mid
dleton. We would not be here if it weren't for her. Health
and attitude were the two biggest keys for us this year."

LOS ANGELES — Walking out of the Los Angeles
Sports Arena yesterday, Val Whiting looked like some
one coming home after a day at the office, carrying a
briefcase hooked under one arm. But the "briefcase"
was a trophy, and the business she and her Cardinal
teammates had just completed was winning the 1992
NCAA Women's Basketball National Championship.
Stanford won its second title in three years by beating
Virginia, 66-65, in a come-from-behind thriller on Saturday
and then crushing Western Kentucky, 78-62, yesterday.
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer said after yesterday's
game that the team had fulfilled almost all of its goals this
year — "To win the [Pacific 10 Conference], to win 30
games and win the national championship. The latest
goal, which we haven't reached yet, is to go on Arsenio."
Paul Sanderford, the head coach of the underdog
Lady Toppers, argued that not completing his own goal
of winning the title made his season a failure.
"I hate to even go talk to the fans and my friends and
family," he said, "because they're all going to say, 'Oh,
you had a great year, you went to the Final Four, blah,
blah, blah, blah.' I want to win it."
Two other teams wanted that as well. Southwest Mis
souri State was on a quest to gain national respect. Virginia
had lost in the semifinals to Stanford two years ago and in
the final to Tennessee last year in overtime. The Cavaliers
were on a mission from the first tip-off of the year.
But at Stanford's season-opening tip-off, few people
had any idea how far the team could go. "On the first day
of practice," VanDerveer said, "one of my assistants
turned to me and said, 'We're going to be .500 this year.'"

"I said, 'Over my dead body.'"
The Cardinal had been ranked No. 7 by most publi
cations. Street and Smith's reflected the general con
sensus: "The Cardinal is rebuilding," it read.
"I never heard of that rebuilding thing," Whiting
said yesterday. "That must have just been something
between the coaches and the press."
But VanDerveer denied any allegations that she had
fixed the dreaded "rebuilding" epithet to this season.
To Sanderford, the Cardinal's youth was irrelevant.
"We just got beat by a better basketball team today," he
said. "The thing that makes them so great is the way
they play well together. . .They are a great credit to
women's basketball, a great national champion."
Throughout the season, the Stanford players and
coaches reported that the relationship on the team was
as tight and the chemistry was as good as ever. Things
which, not so coincidentally, were characteristic of the
1990 national championship team.
Like that team, this year's squad faced the Cavaliers
in the semifinal round. Many observers felt that this
year's matchup between the No. 1 and No. 3 teams in the
country would decide the champion. They were right.
The game began as many predicted — with Virginia
outscoring Stanford. By the middle of the first half, the Cavs
led, 16-8. But it was to be their largest lead of the game.
At that point Molly Goodenbour caught a bad case of
kleptomania. She stole the ball four times in the next 10
minutes and finished with five for the game.
Goodenbour's steals sparked the Cardinal offense,
which was comprised mostly of Kodak All-America
Whiting. Whiting scored 10 points in the first half, and


Ben Tong — Daily
played impeccable defense.
Despite their 6-foot-5 height, the Cavs' Twin Towers,
Heather and Heidi Burge, had difficulty putting the ball
in the basket. Whiting, with her strength and intelligent
play, stifled them.
Meanwhile, the rest of Virginia was having similar
problems. Even Tammi Reiss, the Cavaliers' All-Ameri
ca shooting guard, could not find the net.
Only two-time Naismith Player of the Year Dawn
Staley seemed to be effective offensively, scoring 11
first-half points on humanly impossible moves.
Yet the Cavs led, 29-27, at the half, primarily because
they were so effective cleaning the boards that the fans
could almost hear squeaks on the glass. In the first peri
od Virginia collected 30 rebounds to Stanford's 16.
The second half began much like the first. By the
midway point, Virginia was again leading by eight
points. But at about that time VanDerveer showed both
guts and confidence by inserting freshman point guard
Kate Paye into the game.
"Kate is a very smart player," said the coach. "We
needed to play smarter."
Paye stayed in the rest of the game, and it was evi
dent that her three California Division V high school
championships served her well psychologically.. Always
calm, the freshman directed the Cardinal comeback
alongside Goodenbour.
She also worked Staley defensively, holding the explo
sive guard to a mere smoulder.
Immediately after Paye entered the game, Gooden
bour hit a three-pointer. A few minutes later, with Stan
ford again down by eight, Goodenbour nailed two threes
in 30 seconds. Suddenly the partisan crowd was going
bananas, rocking the arena.
"When Molly hit that three, that's when we got the
momentum for good," VanDerveer said. Goodenbour
finished the tournament with 18 three-point baskets,
shattering Jennifer Azzi's record of 14 set two years ago.
But Stanford didn't get a lead until the clock read
1:42, when Whiting's two free throws put the Cardinal
up 65-63. Then a Kelly Dougherty free throw gave Stan-

ford its largest lead of the game at three
points. It was all that they needed.

LOS ANGELES — Walking out of the Los Angeles
Sports Arena yesterday, Val Whiting looked like some
one coming home after a day at the office, carrying a
briefcase hooked under one arm. But the "briefcase"
was a trophy, and the business she and her Cardinal
teammates had just completed was winning the 1992
NCAA Women's Basketball National Championship.
Stanford won its second title in three years by beating
Virginia, 66-65, in a come-from-behind thriller on Saturday
and then crushing Western Kentucky, 78-62, yesterday.
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer said after yesterday's
game that the team had fulfilled almost all of its goals this
year — "To win the [Pacific 10 Conference], to win 30
games and win the national championship. The latest
goal, which we haven't reached yet, is to go on Arsenio."
Paul Sanderford, the head coach of the underdog
Lady Toppers, argued that not completing his own goal
of winning the title made his season a failure.
"I hate to even go talk to the fans and my friends and
family," he said, "because they're all going to say, 'Oh,
you had a great year, you went to the Final Four, blah,
blah, blah, blah.' I want to win it."
Two other teams wanted that as well. Southwest Mis
souri State was on a quest to gain national respect. Virginia
had lost in the semifinals to Stanford two years ago and in
the final to Tennessee last year in overtime. The Cavaliers
were on a mission from the first tip-off of the year.
But at Stanford's season-opening tip-off, few people
had any idea how far the team could go. "On the first day
of practice," VanDerveer said, "one of my assistants
turned to me and said, 'We're going to be .500 this year.'"

"I said, 'Over my dead body.'"
The Cardinal had been ranked No. 7 by most publi
cations. Street and Smith's reflected the general con
sensus: "The Cardinal is rebuilding," it read.
"I never heard of that rebuilding thing," Whiting
said yesterday. "That must have just been something
between the coaches and the press."
But VanDerveer denied any allegations that she had
fixed the dreaded "rebuilding" epithet to this season.
To Sanderford, the Cardinal's youth was irrelevant.
"We just got beat by a better basketball team today," he
said. "The thing that makes them so great is the way
they play well together. . .They are a great credit to
women's basketball, a great national champion."
Throughout the season, the Stanford players and
coaches reported that the relationship on the team was
as tight and the chemistry was as good as ever. Things
which, not so coincidentally, were characteristic of the
1990 national championship team.
Like that team, this year's squad faced the Cavaliers
in the semifinal round. Many observers felt that this
year's matchup between the No. 1 and No. 3 teams in the
country would decide the champion. They were right.
The game began as many predicted — with Virginia
outscoring Stanford. By the middle of the first half, the Cavs
led, 16-8. But it was to be their largest lead of the game.
At that point Molly Goodenbour caught a bad case of
kleptomania. She stole the ball four times in the next 10
minutes and finished with five for the game.
Goodenbour's steals sparked the Cardinal offense,
which was comprised mostly of Kodak All-America
Whiting. Whiting scored 10 points in the first half, and


Ben Tong — Daily
played impeccable defense.
Despite their 6-foot-5 height, the Cavs' Twin Towers,
Heather and Heidi Burge, had difficulty putting the ball
in the basket. Whiting, with her strength and intelligent
play, stifled them.
Meanwhile, the rest of Virginia was having similar
problems. Even Tammi Reiss, the Cavaliers' All-Ameri
ca shooting guard, could not find the net.
Only two-time Naismith Player of the Year Dawn
Staley seemed to be effective offensively, scoring 11
first-half points on humanly impossible moves.
Yet the Cavs led, 29-27, at the half, primarily because
they were so effective cleaning the boards that the fans
could almost hear squeaks on the glass. In the first peri
od Virginia collected 30 rebounds to Stanford's 16.
The second half began much like the first. By the
midway point, Virginia was again leading by eight
points. But at about that time VanDerveer showed both
guts and confidence by inserting freshman point guard
Kate Paye into the game.
"Kate is a very smart player," said the coach. "We
needed to play smarter."
Paye stayed in the rest of the game, and it was evi
dent that her three California Division V high school
championships served her well psychologically.. Always
calm, the freshman directed the Cardinal comeback
alongside Goodenbour.
She also worked Staley defensively, holding the explo
sive guard to a mere smoulder.
Immediately after Paye entered the game, Gooden
bour hit a three-pointer. A few minutes later, with Stan
ford again down by eight, Goodenbour nailed two threes
in 30 seconds. Suddenly the partisan crowd was going
bananas, rocking the arena.
"When Molly hit that three, that's when we got the
momentum for good," VanDerveer said. Goodenbour
finished the tournament with 18 three-point baskets,
shattering Jennifer Azzi's record of 14 set two years ago.
But Stanford didn't get a lead until the clock read
1:42, when Whiting's two free throws put the Cardinal
up 65-63. Then a Kelly Dougherty free throw gave Stan-

ford its largest lead of the game at three
points. It was all that they needed.
The last second of the game was a con
fusing one, but it had no effect on the
match's outcome. The Cavs called a timeout
before the buzzer sounded, but one official
waved it off, deciding that the two events
were so close as to be considered simultane
ous.
As that official ran off of the court, Staley
ran after him arguing. She could not believe
her collegiate career was over. As it turned
out, it wasn't. The other official decided that
0.8 seconds should be put back on the clock.
But the Cavs, who inbounded from mid
court, could not duplicate Georgia Tech's
men's tournament miracle finish against
use.
After the game, Staley refused to see
reporters and was inconsolable. The winner
of every conceivable women's basketball
award, the one thing she wanted — a
national championship — had eluded her
again.
Western Kentucky's Kim Pehlke, who,
like Staley, was named to the all-tourna
ment team, was not quite as mournful.
Though disappointed in the final outcome,

Photography by Rajiv Chandrasekaran
and Benjamin Tong

the senior guard said, "It-was a dream come true just to
get here."
Pehlke had scored a career-high 30 points on Satur
day against Southwest Missouri State, but was limited
to 16 against Stanford.
The Cardinal simply overwhelmed the Toppers, out
rebounding and outshooring them. Stanford posted a
37-27 intermission lead and pushed its margin to as
much as 24 in the second half.
The Toppers almost made a game of it, though, as
they came back to within nine with 2:33 left. But Stan
ford hit free throws down the stretch to secure the final
margin.
"Fatigue was part of the problem," Sanderford said.
"Stanford's defense was part of the problem. But we
were getting shots we wanted. We just couldn't get them
to fall."
In a game played only about 24 hours after the semi
finals, conditioning played a huge role in the outcome.
"With about four minutes to go in the first half, I
noticed our players really starting to drag," Sanderford
said.
"All those sprint drills I called stupid, all those 7 a.m.
workouts — they all paid off/' Whiting said.
Sanderford also credited the play of Goodenbour and
Rachel Hemmer. Both were named all-tournament, as
was Whiting. Goodenbour, who played two of the best
games of her career, was the sparkplug of the Cardinal
all weekend. A week after being named the MVP of the
West Regional, Goodenbour received the same honor for
the Final Four.
But VanDerveer, who thanked the Stanford fans and
the athletic department and administration, gave a big
credit to someone behind the scenes.
"We have the best trainer in the world in Karen Mid
dleton. We would not be here if it weren't for her. Health
and attitude were the two biggest keys for us this year."

LOS ANGELES — Walking out of the Los Angeles
Sports Arena yesterday, Val Whiting looked like some
one coming home after a day at the office, carrying a
briefcase hooked under one arm. But the "briefcase"
was a trophy, and the business she and her Cardinal
teammates had just completed was winning the 1992
NCAA Women's Basketball National Championship.
Stanford won its second title in three years by beating
Virginia, 66-65, in a come-from-behind thriller on Saturday
and then crushing Western Kentucky, 78-62, yesterday.
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer said after yesterday's
game that the team had fulfilled almost all of its goals this
year — "To win the [Pacific 10 Conference], to win 30
games and win the national championship. The latest
goal, which we haven't reached yet, is to go on Arsenio."
Paul Sanderford, the head coach of the underdog
Lady Toppers, argued that not completing his own goal
of winning the title made his season a failure.
"I hate to even go talk to the fans and my friends and
family," he said, "because they're all going to say, 'Oh,
you had a great year, you went to the Final Four, blah,
blah, blah, blah.' I want to win it."
Two other teams wanted that as well. Southwest Mis
souri State was on a quest to gain national respect. Virginia
had lost in the semifinals to Stanford two years ago and in
the final to Tennessee last year in overtime. The Cavaliers
were on a mission from the first tip-off of the year.
But at Stanford's season-opening tip-off, few people
had any idea how far the team could go. "On the first day
of practice," VanDerveer said, "one of my assistants
turned to me and said, 'We're going to be .500 this year.'"

"I said, 'Over my dead body.'"
The Cardinal had been ranked No. 7 by most publi
cations. Street and Smith's reflected the general con
sensus: "The Cardinal is rebuilding," it read.
"I never heard of that rebuilding thing," Whiting
said yesterday. "That must have just been something
between the coaches and the press."
But VanDerveer denied any allegations that she had
fixed the dreaded "rebuilding" epithet to this season.
To Sanderford, the Cardinal's youth was irrelevant.
"We just got beat by a better basketball team today," he
said. "The thing that makes them so great is the way
they play well together. . .They are a great credit to
women's basketball, a great national champion."
Throughout the season, the Stanford players and
coaches reported that the relationship on the team was
as tight and the chemistry was as good as ever. Things
which, not so coincidentally, were characteristic of the
1990 national championship team.
Like that team, this year's squad faced the Cavaliers
in the semifinal round. Many observers felt that this
year's matchup between the No. 1 and No. 3 teams in the
country would decide the champion. They were right.
The game began as many predicted — with Virginia
outscoring Stanford. By the middle of the first half, the Cavs
led, 16-8. But it was to be their largest lead of the game.
At that point Molly Goodenbour caught a bad case of
kleptomania. She stole the ball four times in the next 10
minutes and finished with five for the game.
Goodenbour's steals sparked the Cardinal offense,
which was comprised mostly of Kodak All-America
Whiting. Whiting scored 10 points in the first half, and

played impeccable defense.
Despite their 6-foot-5 height, the Cavs' Twin Towers,
Heather and Heidi Burge, had difficulty putting the ball
in the basket. Whiting, with her strength and intelligent
play, stifled them.
Meanwhile, the rest of Virginia was having similar
problems. Even Tammi Reiss, the Cavaliers' All-Ameri
ca shooting guard, could not find the net.
Only two-time Naismith Player of the Year Dawn
Staley seemed to be effective offensively, scoring 11
first-half points on humanly impossible moves.
Yet the Cavs led, 29-27, at the half, primarily because
they were so effective cleaning the boards that the fans
could almost hear squeaks on the glass. In the first peri
od Virginia collected 30 rebounds to Stanford's 16.
The second half began much like the first. By the
midway point, Virginia was again leading by eight
points. But at about that time VanDerveer showed both
guts and confidence by inserting freshman point guard
Kate Paye into the game.
"Kate is a very smart player," said the coach. "We
needed to play smarter."
Paye stayed in the rest of the game, and it was evi
dent that her three California Division V high school
championships served her well psychologically.. Always
calm, the freshman directed the Cardinal comeback
alongside Goodenbour.
She also worked Staley defensively, holding the explo
sive guard to a mere smoulder.
Immediately after Paye entered the game, Gooden
bour hit a three-pointer. A few minutes later, with Stan
ford again down by eight, Goodenbour nailed two threes
in 30 seconds. Suddenly the partisan crowd was going
bananas, rocking the arena.
"When Molly hit that three, that's when we got the
momentum for good," VanDerveer said. Goodenbour
finished the tournament with 18 three-point baskets,
shattering Jennifer Azzi's record of 14 set two years ago.
But Stanford didn't get a lead until the clock read
1:42, when Whiting's two free throws put the Cardinal
up 65-63. Then a Kelly Dougherty free throw gave Stan-

ford its largest lead of the game at three
points. It was all that they needed.
The last second of the game was a con
fusing one, but it had no effect on the
match's outcome. The Cavs called a timeout
before the buzzer sounded, but one official
waved it off, deciding that the two events
were so close as to be considered simultane
ous.
As that official ran off of the court, Staley
ran after him arguing. She could not believe
her collegiate career was over. As it turned
out, it wasn't. The other official decided that
0.8 seconds should be put back on the clock.
But the Cavs, who inbounded from mid
court, could not duplicate Georgia Tech's
men's tournament miracle finish against
use.
After the game, Staley refused to see
reporters and was inconsolable. The winner
of every conceivable women's basketball
award, the one thing she wanted — a
national championship — had eluded her
again.
Western Kentucky's Kim Pehlke, who,
like Staley, was named to the all-tourna
ment team, was not quite as mournful.
Though disappointed in the final outcome,

and Benjamin Tong

the senior guard said, "It-was a dream come true just to
get here."
Pehlke had scored a career-high 30 points on Satur
day against Southwest Missouri State, but was limited
to 16 against Stanford.
The Cardinal simply overwhelmed the Toppers, out
rebounding and outshooring them. Stanford posted a
37-27 intermission lead and pushed its margin to as
much as 24 in the second half.
The Toppers almost made a game of it, though, as
they came back to within nine with 2:33 left. But Stan
ford hit free throws down the stretch to secure the final
margin.
"Fatigue was part of the problem," Sanderford said.
"Stanford's defense was part of the problem. But we
were getting shots we wanted. We just couldn't get them
to fall."
In a game played only about 24 hours after the semi
finals, conditioning played a huge role in the outcome.
"With about four minutes to go in the first half, I
noticed our players really starting to drag," Sanderford
said.
"All those sprint drills I called stupid, all those 7 a.m.
workouts — they all paid off/' Whiting said.
Sanderford also credited the play of Goodenbour and
Rachel Hemmer. Both were named all-tournament, as
was Whiting. Goodenbour, who played two of the best
games of her career, was the sparkplug of the Cardinal
all weekend. A week after being named the MVP of the
West Regional, Goodenbour received the same honor for
the Final Four.
But VanDerveer, who thanked the Stanford fans and
the athletic department and administration, gave a big
credit to someone behind the scenes.
"We have the best trainer in the world in Karen Mid
dleton. We would not be here if it weren't for her. Health
and attitude were the two biggest keys for us this year."
