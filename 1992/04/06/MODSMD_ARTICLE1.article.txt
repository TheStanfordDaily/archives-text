# Just Did It
## Women take second NCAA title in three years 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — Walking out of the Los Angeles
Sports Arena yesterday, Val Whiting looked like some
one coming home after a day at the office, carrying a
briefcase hooked under one arm. But the "briefcase"
was a trophy, and the business she and her Cardinal
teammates had just completed was winning the 1992
NCAA Women's Basketball National Championship.
Stanford won its second title in three years by beating
Virginia, 66-65, in a come-from-behind thriller on Saturday
and then crushing Western Kentucky, 78-62, yesterday.
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer said after yesterday's
game that the team had fulfilled almost all of its goals this
year — "To win the [Pacific 10 Conference], to win 30
games and win the national championship. The latest
goal, which we haven't reached yet, is to go on Arsenio."
Paul Sanderford, the head coach of the underdog
Lady Toppers, argued that not completing his own goal
of winning the title made his season a failure.
"I hate to even go talk to the fans and my friends and
family," he said, "because they're all going to say, 'Oh,
you had a great year, you went to the Final Four, blah,
blah, blah, blah.' I want to win it."
Two other teams wanted that as well. Southwest Mis
souri State was on a quest to gain national respect. Virginia
had lost in the semifinals to Stanford two years ago and in
the final to Tennessee last year in overtime. The Cavaliers
were on a mission from the first tip-off of the year.
But at Stanford's season-opening tip-off, few people
had any idea how far the team could go. "On the first day
of practice," VanDerveer said, "one of my assistants
turned to me and said, 'We're going to be .500 this year.'"

"I said, 'Over my dead body.'"
The Cardinal had been ranked No. 7 by most publi
cations. Street and Smith's reflected the general con
sensus: "The Cardinal is rebuilding," it read.
"I never heard of that rebuilding thing," Whiting
said yesterday. "That must have just been something
between the coaches and the press."
But VanDerveer denied any allegations that she had
fixed the dreaded "rebuilding" epithet to this season.
To Sanderford, the Cardinal's youth was irrelevant.
"We just got beat by a better basketball team today," he
said. "The thing that makes them so great is the way
they play well together. . .They are a great credit to
women's basketball, a great national champion."
Throughout the season, the Stanford players and
coaches reported that the relationship on the team was
as tight and the chemistry was as good as ever. Things
which, not so coincidentally, were characteristic of the
1990 national championship team.
Like that team, this year's squad faced the Cavaliers
in the semifinal round. Many observers felt that this
year's matchup between the No. 1 and No. 3 teams in the
country would decide the champion. They were right.
The game began as many predicted — with Virginia
outscoring Stanford. By the middle of the first half, the Cavs
led, 16-8. But it was to be their largest lead of the game.
At that point Molly Goodenbour caught a bad case of
kleptomania. She stole the ball four times in the next 10
minutes and finished with five for the game.
Goodenbour's steals sparked the Cardinal offense,
which was comprised mostly of Kodak All-America
Whiting. Whiting scored 10 points in the first half, and
