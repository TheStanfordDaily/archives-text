The "Stanford H. Ross Perotians"
may be the latest political organi
zation on campus, if Perot's
grassroots campaign for president
takes hold here.
The local "Petition Committee
for H. Ross Perot" kicked off yes
terday in San Jose with an organi
zational rally that drew several
hundred people. Hoover Institu
tion Senior Research Fellow
James Stockdale, Perot's interim
running mate, also attended.
Perot "is concerned with the
issues of young people, more so
than (Bill) Clinton, (Jerry) Brown
and certainly George Bush," said
David Ostby, who graduated from
Palo Alto High School last year
and is now working to involve stu
dents from local colleges in Perot's
campaign.
Ostby said that he will be at
Stanford this week, trying to
enlist potential camaign workers.
"We're looking for someone to take
leadership on the Stanford campus,"
said Gordon Reynolds, a small busi
nessman from San Jose who is chair
ing the local petition drive.
Perot is a Texas billionaire who
has said he will run as an indepen
dent candidate for president if his
name is put on the ballot by peti
tion in all 50 states. Because many
states require a presidential and
vice-presidential candidate on the
ballot, he recently named Stock
dale his temporary running mate.
"There's nothing in it for me or
any of us here, except for saving
our country," Stockdale told the
crowd at yesterday's rally.
Stockdale called himself "an
old friend" of Perot's. The retired
admiral said that while he was a
prisoner of war in Vietnam, his
wife met Perot through her work
with the League of Families, an
organization working on behalf of
POWs and their families. After
his release, he said he met Perot
through his wife.
Stockdale said he was chosen
because Perot "was looking for
someone who wouldn't give him
any hairbrained ideas." Stockdale
said he thinks Perot has a perma
nent running mate in mind who
will be named if Perot's presiden
tial candidacy becomes serious.

But for now, Stockdale is play
ing the role of vice-presidential
candidate.
"We're deadlocked in the sur
vival instinct of professional
politicians," said Stockdale. "It's
like watching a sideshow boxing
match while the barn is on fire."
In his campaign, Perot has been
focusing on such issues as deficit
spending, education and the quali
ty of American products, but has
yet to spell out any policies.
Stockdale refused to answer
any specific questions about
Perot's politics, noting that he
had only talked to Perot once
since signing on as his running
mate. "I'd rather let Perot speak
for himself," Stockdale said.
Organizers admonished the
crowd by saying that this cam
paign is not about "a bunch of slo
gans or empty campaign promis
es," but supporters were already
brainstorming catchy phrases like
"better Stockdale than Quayle."
In order to place Perot on the
California ballot, his supporters
must gather nearly 135,000 sig

natures of registered California
voters. The petition campaign will
begin April 24 and will continue
until August 7.
Michael Davis of San Jose, who
served with Stockdale in Vietnam,
said he came to the rally "to see what
Stockdale is lending his name to."
The local effort for Perot has
organized very recently, according
to Reynolds. He said a group of
about 25 supporters met for the
first time two weeks ago, and the
group has been growing ever since.
Supporters have been putting
up their own funds to secure a
petition headquarters in San Jose,
several phone lines and plenty of
balloons and American flags.
Perot's campaign has been
escalating since March 12, when
he established an 800 number to
handle inquiries and donations.
The number was so inundated
with calls that Perot had to bor
row extra phones from the Home
Shopping Club to handle the
response. Recently, he has been
making frequent appearances on
television and radio talk shows.
