# Self-taught lecturer invented an improved Frisbee

Alan Adler, a lecturer for the Mechani
cal Engineering department, taught a class
last quarter called ME 220: Introduction to
Sensors.
But Adler's expertise is largely self-taught
— he's a teacher without a college education.
And his students know him for another of
his unusual qualifications. Adler's claim to
fame in the world of recreational toys is a
ring-shaped rubber device, either 10 or 13
inches in diameter, that is much like a Fris
bee but flies about three times farther.
Now that the weather is improving, stu
dents can be seen on Wilbur field flinging
this flying wonder— the Aerobie.
According to graduate student Curtis
Wu, who took Adler's class, students feel
that Adler's unusual background "says a
lot about his character and about his natu
ral creativity and curiosity."
The fact that he dabbles in several differ
ent fields, and that he chose to learn these
things himself, "impresses me that much
more," Wu added.
Adler's latest "dabbling" adventure is
the development of the Aerobie and his
own company, Superflight, Inc.
Despite his invention, Adler is not a pro
fessional aerodynamicist. All his life, he has
been an electronics engineer. But he got
involved with aerodynamics because of his
interest in sailing and designing sailboats.
Adler explained that the Aerobie was the
product of deliberate research to design a
better Frisbee, "one that was easier to throw
a long distance."
After trying to improve on the shape of a
Frisbee, he realized that he couldn't create
one with low air resistance. This led him to
the idea of ring-shaped disks.
Between 1979 and late 1984, he created
and tested out more than 75 different kinds of

flying rings. In 1980, he sold Parker Brothers
the rights to the Aerobie's predecessor, the
Skyro.
It set his first Guinness World Record,
with a distance of about 740 feet. Later, he
upped the record to 857 feet. Unfortunately,
the Skyro tended to veer to the side unless it
was thrown at a specific speed and angle.
Parker Brothers produced it for about a
year and a half, and then returned the
rights to Adler because Skyro's sales were
"not big enough to interest such a large
company," Adler said.
"They were having more success with
small electronic toys."
Skyro had sold about one million units,
which Adler described as "big to you and
me, but not to Parker Brothers."
He then set out to create an even better
Frisbee. He sought to develop one that
would fly straighter, which proved to be the
most challenging aspect of his work.
The large amount of air resistance that
traditional Frisbees produce is also what
keeps them stable. Now that Adler had found
the way to eliminate much of that resistance,
he also needed to make up for the fact that it
wouldn't fly with as much accuracy.
Around the beginning of 1984, he made
a breakthrough. The addition of a lip
around the edge of the ring allows it to bal
ance its lift evenly during flight, allowing it
to travel in a straight line rather than veer
ing off to the side. He had finally found a
solution to his problem.
It was then time to put the new design to
the test. Adler set out to find the "best Fris
bee thrower around," and word of mouth
led him to Scott Zimmerman.
When he met Zimmerman, who is about
5 feet 10 inches tall, Adler said he was sur
prised by his small stature. "I was hoping
you'd be bigger," Adler told him.
Zimmerman's height had no effect his

abilities, however. They tested the Aerobie
outside the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, where
Zimmerman sent it sailing for 1,046 feet.
An average Frisbee thrower, in compar
ison, can throw the Aerobie for a maximum
of about 150 feet (still considerably farther
than a Frisbee would fly).
About two weeks later, when the press
came to see this wonder of aerodynamics,
they asked Zimmerman if he could throw it
from inside the Rose Bowl and land it out
side the stadium
That was no problem.
He proceeded to demonstrate this feat of
throwing expertise about 40 times, since
"the cameraman had trouble focusing on the
disc," Adler recalled.
That day, Zimmerman officially broke the

Skyro's previous world record by throwing
the Aerobie 1,125 feet.
Adler then speculated that the Aerobie
would go farther if he tried throwing it off
of a hang-gliding clifT, where the various air
currents would help it stay in flight.
So they went to Fort Funston, California,
and, using a laser-guided distance meter,
they measured Zimmerman's throw to be
1,257 feet. Adler timed the disc's flight time
with a stopwatch — 28 seconds.
That July 8, 1986 throw holds the cur
rent record for the longest distance a heav
ier-than-air object has been thrown.
Then it was time for Adler to sell the Aer
obie. He said he was unhappy with the way
the giant toy manufacturers treated his cre
ations, because they focused more on quan
tity of sales than quality of the product.
He also couldn't afford to let quality
slide, since even a small inconsistency in the
shape of the ring makes the difference
between an Aerobie that flies straight and
one that doesn't.
Then his wife suggested "naively" that
they produce and sell it on their own. Now
he is glad that they decided to do that, Adler
said. "I'm also glad we didn't know how
much work it was going to be," he added.
Today, his company, Superflight, Inc.,
has sold several million units. The Aerobie
and the Orbiter, a triangular boomerang
similar to the Aerobie, are gaining nation
wide popularity.
As junior Mike Breidenbach put it,
"They're easier to throw and they're just
cooler (than the Frisbee)."
However, some people still cling to the
more traditional flying disk. The Aerobie
"is pretty unstable if it's thrown like a reg
ular Frisbee," Wu observed.
He said in order to take advantage of the
Aerobie's features, it has to be thrown level
— otherwise, it will go off to the left or right.

Alan Adler, a lecturer for the Mechani
cal Engineering department, taught a class
last quarter called ME 220: Introduction to
Sensors.
But Adler's expertise is largely self-taught
— he's a teacher without a college education.
And his students know him for another of
his unusual qualifications. Adler's claim to
fame in the world of recreational toys is a
ring-shaped rubber device, either 10 or 13
inches in diameter, that is much like a Fris
bee but flies about three times farther.
Now that the weather is improving, stu
dents can be seen on Wilbur field flinging
this flying wonder— the Aerobie.
According to graduate student Curtis
Wu, who took Adler's class, students feel
that Adler's unusual background "says a
lot about his character and about his natu
ral creativity and curiosity."
The fact that he dabbles in several differ
ent fields, and that he chose to learn these
things himself, "impresses me that much
more," Wu added.
Adler's latest "dabbling" adventure is
the development of the Aerobie and his
own company, Superflight, Inc.
Despite his invention, Adler is not a pro
fessional aerodynamicist. All his life, he has
been an electronics engineer. But he got
involved with aerodynamics because of his
interest in sailing and designing sailboats.
Adler explained that the Aerobie was the
product of deliberate research to design a
better Frisbee, "one that was easier to throw
a long distance."
After trying to improve on the shape of a
Frisbee, he realized that he couldn't create
one with low air resistance. This led him to
the idea of ring-shaped disks.
Between 1979 and late 1984, he created
and tested out more than 75 different kinds of

flying rings. In 1980, he sold Parker Brothers
the rights to the Aerobie's predecessor, the
Skyro.
It set his first Guinness World Record,
with a distance of about 740 feet. Later, he
upped the record to 857 feet. Unfortunately,
the Skyro tended to veer to the side unless it
was thrown at a specific speed and angle.
Parker Brothers produced it for about a
year and a half, and then returned the
rights to Adler because Skyro's sales were
"not big enough to interest such a large
company," Adler said.
"They were having more success with
small electronic toys."
Skyro had sold about one million units,
which Adler described as "big to you and
me, but not to Parker Brothers."
He then set out to create an even better
Frisbee. He sought to develop one that
would fly straighter, which proved to be the
most challenging aspect of his work.
The large amount of air resistance that
traditional Frisbees produce is also what
keeps them stable. Now that Adler had found
the way to eliminate much of that resistance,
he also needed to make up for the fact that it
wouldn't fly with as much accuracy.
Around the beginning of 1984, he made
a breakthrough. The addition of a lip
around the edge of the ring allows it to bal
ance its lift evenly during flight, allowing it
to travel in a straight line rather than veer
ing off to the side. He had finally found a
solution to his problem.
It was then time to put the new design to
the test. Adler set out to find the "best Fris
bee thrower around," and word of mouth
led him to Scott Zimmerman.
When he met Zimmerman, who is about
5 feet 10 inches tall, Adler said he was sur
prised by his small stature. "I was hoping
you'd be bigger," Adler told him.
Zimmerman's height had no effect his

abilities, however. They tested the Aerobie
outside the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, where
Zimmerman sent it sailing for 1,046 feet.
An average Frisbee thrower, in compar
ison, can throw the Aerobie for a maximum
of about 150 feet (still considerably farther
than a Frisbee would fly).
About two weeks later, when the press
came to see this wonder of aerodynamics,
they asked Zimmerman if he could throw it
from inside the Rose Bowl and land it out
side the stadium
That was no problem.
He proceeded to demonstrate this feat of
throwing expertise about 40 times, since
"the cameraman had trouble focusing on the
disc," Adler recalled.
That day, Zimmerman officially broke the

Skyro's previous world record by throwing
the Aerobie 1,125 feet.
Adler then speculated that the Aerobie
would go farther if he tried throwing it off
of a hang-gliding clifT, where the various air
currents would help it stay in flight.
So they went to Fort Funston, California,
and, using a laser-guided distance meter,
they measured Zimmerman's throw to be
1,257 feet. Adler timed the disc's flight time
with a stopwatch — 28 seconds.
That July 8, 1986 throw holds the cur
rent record for the longest distance a heav
ier-than-air object has been thrown.
Then it was time for Adler to sell the Aer
obie. He said he was unhappy with the way
the giant toy manufacturers treated his cre
ations, because they focused more on quan
tity of sales than quality of the product.
He also couldn't afford to let quality
slide, since even a small inconsistency in the
shape of the ring makes the difference
between an Aerobie that flies straight and
one that doesn't.
Then his wife suggested "naively" that
they produce and sell it on their own. Now
he is glad that they decided to do that, Adler
said. "I'm also glad we didn't know how
much work it was going to be," he added.
Today, his company, Superflight, Inc.,
has sold several million units. The Aerobie
and the Orbiter, a triangular boomerang
similar to the Aerobie, are gaining nation
wide popularity.
As junior Mike Breidenbach put it,
"They're easier to throw and they're just
cooler (than the Frisbee)."
However, some people still cling to the
more traditional flying disk. The Aerobie
"is pretty unstable if it's thrown like a reg
ular Frisbee," Wu observed.
He said in order to take advantage of the
Aerobie's features, it has to be thrown level
— otherwise, it will go off to the left or right.
