Women's basketball
team strikes blow for
equality with big win

JUST A LITTLE OVER a
decade ago, Charlie's Angels
served as the prototype of the
female pop culture idol.
These heroines, more concerned
with striking a pose than pointing a
gun, fell short of fulfilling role
models. Little girls could either fol
low their feminine lead — and buy
into the myth that women weren't
as competent as men — or choose
to emulate the Han Solos of the
world instead.
Fortunately, children of the '90s
can benefit from the lead taken by
women who rejected these weak
images and decided to develop into
impressive role models themselves.
The Stanford women's basket
ball team is comprised of 13 such
women.
Undaunted, these women
fought hard and played tough to
secure the national championship
yesterday in Los Angeles. They cer
tainly weren't afraid to let every
one see them sweat.
With their second big win in the
Final Four, these athletes boosted
the credibility of women's basket
ball and splintered the antiquated
idea that women's sports are nei
ther as strenuous nor as entertain
ing as men's.
Watching the speed and agility
of Tracy Goodenbour as she battled
through clusters of Western Ken
tucky defenders, the ferocious play
of Rachel Hemmer as she ripped
down rebound after rebound, or
the Kareem-like leaps of Val Whit
ing, it was obvious that those
stereotypes are far from the truth.
But nationally, women still face
many barriers to improving in
their sports.
For instance, some still argue
against providing equal funding for
women's sports, saying that
because men draw the crowds,

larger expenditures toward their
facilities and coaches' salaries are
justified. But it is a circular argu
ment: with inferior facilities and
training, women have never been
given the same opportunities for
advancement as men.
Sometimes, women athletes also
lack adequate encouragement and
emotional support, and are trapped
by unfairly low expectations.
For example, until recently in
the sport of track, too many women
have listened when they were told
they could never reach the times
set by men. With mental caps
placed on their speeds, it is easy to
see how this remained a self-fulfill
ing prophecy.
Today, women runners are
catching up with the men, making
such limits on their progress obso
lete. Hopefully, recent widespread
media attention to scientific stud
ies on the possibility that women's
times will equal men's will have a
positive effect on the Joan Benoits
of the next century.
The Cardinal women have over
come obstacles of their own, and
have silenced the naysayers with
their performance, especially over
the past three years.
However, even now, women must
battle tremendous ignorance. Lack
of television coverage — women's
basketball games were first tele
vised nationally only a few years ago
— has added to the problem.
In other sports, such as volley
ball, many female athletes still
wear uniforms that resemble
Speedos, not jerseys and shorts.
In advertising, Nike is one of the
few companies that portrays
women as athletes, rather than as
members of a Swedish bikini team
or as cheering, scantily clad Barbie
dolls. But women athletes around
the world continue to be underesti
mated.
As the Cardinal women demon
strated yesterday, the stereotypes
can be eliminated through disci
pline and success. Performances
like this season's by the Cardinal
women's basketball team are
paving the way.
