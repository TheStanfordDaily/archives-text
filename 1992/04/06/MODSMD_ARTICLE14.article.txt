'Taxpayer Protection Act' targets the poor unfairly

The state of California, the
fifth largest single economy in the
world, is in the midst of a stagger
ing budget crisis. The fiscal irresponsi
bility of the previous generation has cre
ated a $14.3 billion budget deficit for
which, as in the rest of the United
States, the poor are being blamed and
made to shoulder the burden.
Gov. Wilson's proposed "Taxpayer
Protection Act" is a pitifully regressive
measure that fails to address the root of
the state budget deficit. The act will
affect many facets of the state's social
services, including MediCal, social secu
rity and disability payments.
Most striking of all, however, is the
plan to slash Aid to Families with

Dependent Children (AFDC), a program
which benefits 1.5 million children in
the state. Wilson proposes to immediate
ly reduce aid by 10 percent, followed by
an additional 15 percent cut after six
months.
These draconian cuts will have catas
trophic results for poor families in the
Bay Area.
Early reports from Peninsula social
service departments indicate that up to
6,000 families in both Santa Clara and
San Mateo counties are in danger of
immediately losing their housing if these
cuts are implemented.
In addition, the California Rural
Legal Assistance Foundation reports
that hunger among children under 12

will rise from the current number of
647,000 to 900,000 within five years.
This attack on the poor is due to a
stagnant tax base immobilized by Propo
sition 13, spawned by the tax revolt in
the late 19705. Proposition 13, which
taxes property at the 1976 assessment
rate, has, along with laissez-faire busi
ness tax loopholes, shielded the wealthi
est citizens and businesses in California
from taxation and created the Gordian
knot of social problems in the state.
In the '70s, Proposition 13 seemed to
be the golden goose necessaiy to usher
in a new era of prosperity in California.
Now, in 1992, the goose has revealed
itself to be a dodo.
Throughout the state, citizens are

reacting not with indignation and fury,
but rather with resignation and defer
ence to Wilson's Malthusian approach to
budget balancing.
California, the state to which the rest
of the country looks for precedents,
must not allow its poorest and most vul
nerable citizens to be scapegoated by the
government.
Voters must send a clear and unyield
ing message to the leaders in Sacramen
to: that Californians refuse to be forced
to choose between social justice and
Social Darwinism.
