# Ads supporting animal research unacceptable
## 
### 
I am truly disgusted by the adver
tisement shown on page five of the
March 30 issue of The Daily asking for
money to support animal research.
As one who has diligently written let
ters and sent money to help end animal
research and the callous disregard for
the right of animals to have a decent life,
I am extremely disappointed to see such
an advertisement in The Daily.
Just when it seems we are making
progress in fighting for animal rights,
something like this shows up.
Anyone who familiarizes themselves
with the literature knows that there are
new and better ways to find cures and
test products â€” in vivo and computer
technologies, etc. There are no longer
reasons to hurt and kill animals for such
purposes.
Any sane person would support the
right of scientists to search for new
cures; that right is not at issue, as the ad
seems to suggest. The issue is when will
we come out of the Dark Ages and stop

inflicting suffering on our animal friends
needlessly?
I hope The Daily will be more dis
criminating in selecting ads.
