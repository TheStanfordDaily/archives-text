# Student decries apathy around campus issues
## 
### 
It used to be when asked about the
privileged life of a private university I
would tell a story about watching a
Stanford maintenance man painstaking
ly paint in chocolate brown the poles and
backs of campus stop signs.
The painting contributed to the beau
ty of the campus, and thereby to student
life, though in such a minimal way that
the scene's meaning seem poised
between affluence and excess.
No such ambiguity is present in the
recent disclosure about the management
of Bookstore finances. Buccaneers to be

sure, though the Bookstore preys not on
speculators, but rather on many middle
class families like mine who have
worked, saved, taken out second mort
gages and deferred purchases so that a
son or daughter could have the opportu
nity of a Stanford education, books, pen
cils and all.
But perhaps just as troubling is the
apparent lack of student outrage â€” just
another scandal, it is said.
I have always been proud of what I
have believed to be the idealism and
determination of my fellow students and
of the Stanford community at large.
But while great challenges presented
by national and international issues
have spurred Stanford students, faculty
and staff on, recent challenges close to
home seem so far to have been met with
frustration, impotence and indifference.
Are the current difficulties of the
University's scandals? Perhaps, but they
are also opportunities. Opportunities to
protest what is truly unfair, and to come
up with creative solutions for problems
which no longer can be solved by simply
spending more money.
