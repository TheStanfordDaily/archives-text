## Bill & Mario kiss, make up 
### 
Although he stopped short
of an endorsement, Mario Cuomo
did condescend to appear in public
with Bill Clinton Saturday and even had
some nice words to say about the
Arkansas governor.
Did somebody say "deal"? Bet the
house on it: When the dust settles on the
Democratic Convention this summer,
Cuomo will be Clinton's running mate.
But why, you hopefully ask, would
either of these men — who have long
hated each other — consent to such a
deal? Consider, first, the New York gov
ernor. Cuomo gave a great speech in 1984
at the convention in San Francisco, steal
ing what little thunder Walter Mondale
had, and he was anointed a heavyweight
candidate of the future.
But for all of Cuomo's mystique,
there's a lot more to the man, some of
which has only become apparent recently.
He didn't run in 1988 when, some
would have us believe, he could have
fought back against George Bush's cam
paign machine and, unlike Michael
Dukakis, actually won.
Yes, he would have been more combat
ive than Dukakis, and he certainly
wouldn't have been any less exciting, but
Cuomo's charm is dependent on hearing
him in small doses. Over a long campaign,
Cuomo would become pretty boring, too.
Meanwhile, 1992 rolled around, and
Cuomo was going to run if only he could

get that darned New York State budget
worked out. And even as a non-candidate,
he is never far from the stage.
Just before the New Hampshire pri
mary, he gave a speech at Harvard, draw
ing more interest than any of the
declared candidates and once again fuel
ing suspicion, in some cases even hope,
that he'd still enter the race.
But then in the New Hampshire pri
mary, the much-ballyhooed write-in cam
paign for Cuomo failed to muster even 5
percent of the vote, and most of the wait
for-Cuomo types finally realized it was
time to pick a new candidate.
Now, a little foray into the psyche of
Cuomo. Fact: In the last year, Cuomo has
slept away from Albany just six times.
Even when he has traveled to California,
he has taken a red-eye flight home just to
avoid sleeping elsewhere. Is this the man
who's supposed to run a national cam
paign for president? Wait, there's more.
Cuomo relishes his position as some
one who's seen by so many as the guy
who would win the White House for the
Democrats if only he would run.
But he's scared bleep-less to give it a
shot. And what's worse is that he has
clearly never come to terms with that
fear. Instead, he shows up right and left,
teasing the electorate about a possible
late entry and frequently taking pot shots
at the other candidates.
Which brings us back to Clinton.

You'll recall that on one of the Gennifer
Flowers tapes she refers to Cuomo as a
mafioso, and Clinton acknowledges that he
sometimes acts like one. When the tapes
surfaced, Cuomo became enraged, seem
ingly eager to force Clinton from the race.
Which suggests the real Cuomo prob
lem: Not only is he afraid to run, but also
he can't stand the thought of someone
else winning in his place.
But as the vice presidential nominee,
either Cuomo gets a free ride, or, if it
looks like he and Clinton are going to
lose, he can jump on the blame-Bill band
wagon and return to his comfortable
Albany bed and his status as the guy who
could have done it.
As for Clinton, why ke would cut such a
deal is hard to fathom. He may be adher
ing to the Corleone credo of keeping your
friends close and your enemies closer. Or
maybe he thinks himself enough of a shoo
in that he can take the risk of a potential
back stabber for a running mate.
But make no mistake about it, the deal
has been made. It's the only plausible
way to explain Cuomo kissing and mak
ing up with Clinton.

clearly never come to terms with that
fear. Instead, he shows up right and left,
teasing the electorate about a possible
late entry and frequently taking pot shots
at the other candidates.
Which brings us back to Clinton.

You'll recall that on one of the Gennifer
Flowers tapes she refers to Cuomo as a
mafioso, and Clinton acknowledges that he
sometimes acts like one. When the tapes
surfaced, Cuomo became enraged, seem
ingly eager to force Clinton from the race.
Which suggests the real Cuomo prob
lem: Not only is he afraid to run, but also
he can't stand the thought of someone
else winning in his place.
But as the vice presidential nominee,
either Cuomo gets a free ride, or, if it
looks like he and Clinton are going to
lose, he can jump on the blame-Bill band
wagon and return to his comfortable
Albany bed and his status as the guy who
could have done it.
As for Clinton, why ke would cut such a
deal is hard to fathom. He may be adher
ing to the Corleone credo of keeping your
friends close and your enemies closer. Or
maybe he thinks himself enough of a shoo
in that he can take the risk of a potential
back stabber for a running mate.
But make no mistake about it, the deal
has been made. It's the only plausible
way to explain Cuomo kissing and mak
ing up with Clinton.
