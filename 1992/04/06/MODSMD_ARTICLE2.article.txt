# Schroeder says U.S. society not 'family friendly'
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Women's and children's interests are being
ignored by the government, Rep. Pat Schroeder
said Friday, calling for a "tsunami to bring some
more women into town."
Schroeder, the highest-ranking woman in
Congress, told a warm audience packed into Kresge
Auditorium: "We have a capital that talks more about
families and does less for families than any other cap
ital in the world. The tax codes say it is better to raise
thoroughbred horses or dogs instead of children."
A Democrat re-elected nine times by her home
state of Colorado, Schroeder chairs the House
Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families
and co-chairs the Congressional Caucus for
Women's Issues.
Women do not need to choose between careers
and families, Schroeder said, remembering how
the press asked her how she could be both a con
gresswoman and a mother. She responded: "I have
a brain and a uterus and they both work."
Schroeder is married and has two children, who

were two and six when she was
first elected. She said women can
"juggle" the roles of mother, wife
and career woman despite the fact
that the United States is not a
"family-friendly" society.
According to Schroeder, Amer
ican society is least family friend
ly in the workplace and govern
ment. In the business world, a
person "will never mention a
care-giver role (to the boss) for
fear they are going to be mommy
tracked," she said.
The government will only
accept the "Leave-it-to-Beaver"
type family with "traditional hus
band and wife roles," Schroeder
continued. "But there aren't very
many of those left."
Schroeder said 90 percent of
America's women will be in the
workplace at some point of their
lives, and yet President Bush will
not accept legislation — the Fam
ily-Medical Leave bill — that
would assist care-givers in the
workplace. Every time Congress
passes it, the president vetoes it,
Schroeder said.
The United States also needs
more funding for programs such
as Head Start, a program
designed to help all eligible kids
with immunizations and pre
school education.
She said $1.2 billion is needed
provide Head Start services to all
eligible children — less than the
Department of Defense wastes in
one day.
"We love little kids to death
until we get up to the budget
door," Schroeder said. Every cate

gory of spending went up in the
1980s except spending on young
people, she added.
Schroeder criticized the large
amount of money the United
States spends on defense — a fig
ure she said was twice as much as
all other countries combined. She
added that the money would be
better spent on children.
"You are most apt to change
the world if you change the world
of a child," Schroeder said. "They
believe you change the world by
being a bully and going around
with a gun changing people," but
that method only works in the
short term, she added.
Schroeder also spoke about
abortion, which she said was an
important issue since the
"Supreme Court is sure to turn
down Roe vs. Wade."
She said she is working for
the passage of a Freedom of
Choice bill since the right to
abortion is "a fundamental prin
ciple of government, like the Bill
of Rights."
At the end of her speech,
Schroeder took questions from
the audience. She refused to
endorse any of the presidential
candidates. Asked whether she
would run for president, as she
prepared to do in 1988, she
responded "the (Democratic)
party does not think a woman is
electable."
She added that she was "sad
dened" by the election since the
only issues are character issues
and none of the candidates have a
vision.
"Bush made the vision thing a
joke for Saturday Night Live and
now we're all treating it like a
joke," Schroeder said.

down Roe vs. Wade."
She said she is working for
the passage of a Freedom of
Choice bill since the right to
abortion is "a fundamental prin
ciple of government, like the Bill
of Rights."
At the end of her speech,
Schroeder took questions from
the audience. She refused to
endorse any of the presidential
candidates. Asked whether she
would run for president, as she
prepared to do in 1988, she
responded "the (Democratic)
party does not think a woman is
electable."
She added that she was "sad
dened" by the election since the
only issues are character issues
and none of the candidates have a
vision.
"Bush made the vision thing a
joke for Saturday Night Live and
now we're all treating it like a
joke," Schroeder said.
