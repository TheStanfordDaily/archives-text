## Card loses marathon match to defending national champs Troy conquers Stanford in battle of tennis powers 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior Staff Writer 
After five-and-a-half hours, the
Stanford and USC men's tennis teams
were dead even. As the evening wind
whipped through the Stanford Tennis
Stadium and sent chills through even
the heartiest of die-hard fans, the Car
dinal's perfect season record and No. 1
national ranking rested on the outcome
of a third set tiebreaker.

"I've coached collegiate tennis for 26
years and only half a dozen matches
stand out. This was one of them," said
Cardinal head coach Dick Gould.
Fighting back from 2-5 in the third
set, Vimal Patel and Jason Yee evened
out the second doubles match at six
games apiece.
In the tiebreaker they fell behind
3-6, and faced match point. Yet they
clawed back again, to 6-6, and then
gritted out a string of harrowing
plays — nearly tasting victory with a
match point of their own — before
the Trojans finally sealed the match,
10-8.
This was the story on every Cardinal
court Saturday afternoon. The men
kept fighting back and fighting back
against the powerful defending nation
al champions of the South. Most games

ended with brutally close scores of 6-4
or 7-5.
Gould saw definite improvement in
his team's performance, as compared
with earlier Cardinal-Trojan matches.
"In the past, they jumped out on us
and we were fighting back, but (Satur
day) we were in a position to win. We've
been competing really well."
At the top of the ladder, Alex
O'Brien and Michael Flanagan eked
out close wins over their singles oppo
nents while Chris Cocotos and Robert
Devens lost close three-setters.
Although he lost, Cocotos' match
was impressive because he lost the first
set 0-6, but came roaring back to win 6-
1 in the second before falling 5-7 in the
third.
"I was really proud of Chris," Gould
said. "(His opponent Jon) Leach played
great. . . . Chris showed tremendous
mettle. He blocked out (the first set)
and put himself in a position to win."
Cocotos said he felt that he simply
started playing his game. "In the sec
ond set I just started making all the
shots I was missing and I think he got a
little careless."
When his No. 1 doubles match with
O'Brien rolled around, Cocotos needed
no warmup set — he came onto the
court shooting winners.
The pair needed every winner they
could get against the No. 1 ranked duo,
Brian MacPhie and Leach. Team expe
rience won out as the veteran USC pair
defeated the relatively new Stanford
partners.
But O'Brien was not discouraged.
"It's a building phase. We need more
confidence in our game," he said.

"We're going to work on lots of little
things and fine tune our doubles game.
We're both playing well, we're just not
getting the job done."
Coach Gould was pleased with all
three doubles teams because none have
the experience of the Trojan teams. "I
was most impressed with doubles.
That was the biggest single question
and I was pleased with the way they
responded. . . .We made great strides."
Flanagan and Devens handled their
doubles opponents easily, dropping
only two games en route to tying up
Saturday's match.
That left Patel and Yee as the sole
Cardinal competitors on the court.
Again, Gould was pleased despite the
loss.
"Vimal and Jason proved that they
can handle the No. 2 position," he said.
"Vimal sustained his concentration
really well. He was much more versa
tile."
This new versatility also showed up
in Patel's No. 5 singles match where he
briefly disposed of his opponent, 6-1,6-
3. At sixth singles, Yee lost 6-3, 6-4.
Friday's 5-3 win over an always
tough UCLA team, pales in comparison
to Saturday's excitement.
Again tied after singles, wins at first
and second doubles clinched Cardinal
victory. Third doubles did not finish.
O'Brien chalked up a big win over
Mark Knowles 6-4, 6-2 at first singles.
"Alex had a great weekend," Gould
noted.
The middle men in the lineup all
dropped matches while Patel and Yee
prevailed at fifth and sixth singles to
keep Cardinal hopes alive.

We're both playing well, we're just not
getting the job done."
Coach Gould was pleased with all
three doubles teams because none have
the experience of the Trojan teams. "I
was most impressed with doubles.
That was the biggest single question
and I was pleased with the way they
responded. . . .We made great strides."
Flanagan and Devens handled their
doubles opponents easily, dropping
only two games en route to tying up
Saturday's match.
That left Patel and Yee as the sole
Cardinal competitors on the court.
Again, Gould was pleased despite the
loss.
"Vimal and Jason proved that they
can handle the No. 2 position," he said.
"Vimal sustained his concentration
really well. He was much more versa
tile."
This new versatility also showed up
in Patel's No. 5 singles match where he
briefly disposed of his opponent, 6-1,6-
3. At sixth singles, Yee lost 6-3, 6-4.
Friday's 5-3 win over an always
tough UCLA team, pales in comparison
to Saturday's excitement.
Again tied after singles, wins at first
and second doubles clinched Cardinal
victory. Third doubles did not finish.
O'Brien chalked up a big win over
Mark Knowles 6-4, 6-2 at first singles.
"Alex had a great weekend," Gould
noted.
The middle men in the lineup all
dropped matches while Patel and Yee
prevailed at fifth and sixth singles to
keep Cardinal hopes alive.

Alex O'Brien capped off a successful weekend at No. 1 singles for the Cardinal with
his 6-4, 6-4 defeat of USC's Brian MacPhie. O'Brien, a senior, is currently ranked No.
2 in the nation in singles.
After five-and-a-half hours, the
Stanford and USC men's tennis teams
were dead even. As the evening wind
whipped through the Stanford Tennis
Stadium and sent chills through even
the heartiest of die-hard fans, the Car
dinal's perfect season record and No. 1
national ranking rested on the outcome
of a third set tiebreaker.

"I've coached collegiate tennis for 26
years and only half a dozen matches
stand out. This was one of them," said
Cardinal head coach Dick Gould.
Fighting back from 2-5 in the third
set, Vimal Patel and Jason Yee evened
out the second doubles match at six
games apiece.
In the tiebreaker they fell behind
3-6, and faced match point. Yet they
clawed back again, to 6-6, and then
gritted out a string of harrowing
plays — nearly tasting victory with a
match point of their own — before
the Trojans finally sealed the match,
10-8.
This was the story on every Cardinal
court Saturday afternoon. The men
kept fighting back and fighting back
against the powerful defending nation
al champions of the South. Most games

ended with brutally close scores of 6-4
or 7-5.
Gould saw definite improvement in
his team's performance, as compared
with earlier Cardinal-Trojan matches.
"In the past, they jumped out on us
and we were fighting back, but (Satur
day) we were in a position to win. We've
been competing really well."
At the top of the ladder, Alex
O'Brien and Michael Flanagan eked
out close wins over their singles oppo
nents while Chris Cocotos and Robert
Devens lost close three-setters.
Although he lost, Cocotos' match
was impressive because he lost the first
set 0-6, but came roaring back to win 6-
1 in the second before falling 5-7 in the
third.
"I was really proud of Chris," Gould
said. "(His opponent Jon) Leach played
great. . . . Chris showed tremendous
mettle. He blocked out (the first set)
and put himself in a position to win."
Cocotos said he felt that he simply
started playing his game. "In the sec
ond set I just started making all the
shots I was missing and I think he got a
little careless."
When his No. 1 doubles match with
O'Brien rolled around, Cocotos needed
no warmup set — he came onto the
court shooting winners.
The pair needed every winner they
could get against the No. 1 ranked duo,
Brian MacPhie and Leach. Team expe
rience won out as the veteran USC pair
defeated the relatively new Stanford
partners.
But O'Brien was not discouraged.
"It's a building phase. We need more
confidence in our game," he said.

"We're going to work on lots of little
things and fine tune our doubles game.
We're both playing well, we're just not
getting the job done."
