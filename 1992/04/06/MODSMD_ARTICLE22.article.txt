# Stanford nine swept by California in three game weekend series
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
It seems that the Stanford baseball team may be
having a bit of trouble with its timing.
At the beginning of the season, the pitching was
incredible, but the hitting lagged, which forced the
Cardinal to manufacture runs and hold the other
team's offense to nil.
Then the pitching slumped, but the hitting came
alive, covering up the mistakes from the mound with
a pile of hits. But as evidenced by this weekend's
series with Cal, Stanford may have, for the last sev
eral games anyway, lost sight of both its hitting and
pitching.
For the first time since 1977, Cal swept a three
game series with the Cardinal, winning two at
Sunken Diamond and one at Berkeley. As for the
Bears' timing, it couldn't have been better.
Their thought-to-be horrible pitching turned out
to be anything but, and they put on a veritable clin
ic from the plate. Meanwhile, Stanford struggled to
find a good starting pitching performance, and
struggled even harder to find a decent relieving per
formance.
Friday saw Stanford's ace Rick Helling go
up against Cal's Mike Cather, a match-up which
appeared to be in Stanford's favor. But Helling gave
up six early runs in less than five innings, while

reliever Tim Moore gave up two more.
Cather on the other hand was masterful, throw
ing a shutout until the bottom of the eighth when
the Cardinal plated five to draw within three runs of
Cal. But the Bears came back and scored two more
in the top of the ninth against the '92 debut of Steve
Worrell and making the final score 10-5.
Willie Adams provided the only respectable pitch
ing performance of the weekend, holding Cal hitters
to three runs through seven innings. But his relief
was shabby, as Brian Sackinsky, Aaron Dorlarque
and Andrew Lorraine couldn't cool the Bear bats.
Leading 4-2 going into the bottom of the eighth, Cal
scored three thanks to the mighty bat of Troy Penix,
who had three home runs over the series.
However, undaunted, Dave Cornell hit a solo shot
in the ninth to tie it up, only to see it go to waste as
Lorraine walked in the winning run with two out in
the bottom of the ninth to finalize the score at 6-5.
Sunday proved to be more of the same as Stan
ford starter Jaime Sepeda, after pitching a perfect
first three innings, allowed seven runs in six
innings.
At the plate, Stanford didn't look much better,
plating only two runs before Cal's monster seven
run eighth, which included a Lorraine-surrendered
Penix grand slam.
For the series, Stanford pitching had a cumula
tive ERA of 9.38, and gave up six home runs.
