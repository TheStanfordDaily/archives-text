## 
### Laurie Wackier Staff writer 
After pounding Brigham
Young University with lethal
serves and a ferocious offense Fri
day at Burnham Pavilion, the
men's volleyball team found
themselves on the receiving end
when they collided with top
ranked Long Beach State Satur
day in front of a packed house.
The Stanford spikers fell to the
49'ers in four games, 15-4, 8-15,
15-7, and 15-11.
Long Beach (14-1, 25-1 over
all), who clinched the division title
with the victory, dealt the second
ranked Card (12-2, 18-3) their
only other conference loss earlier
in the season.
Stanford is second in the Wil
son division of the Western Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association.
The 49'ers frustrated a Cardi
nal net attack that has been dev
astating throughout the season.
"They play great defense, the
best defense in the country," com
mended head coach Ruben
Nieves. "We hit balls that should
be kills, and they just popped
them up."
But defense was only half of
the story for Long Beach State.
An All-American, junior Brent
Hilliard punished the Card with
30 kills, leading his team to a com
bined .428 hitting average.
"He's phenomenal," Nieves
remarked. "Even if they pass
badly, they have Hilliard waiting
to swing at the ball."
But Nieves' squad didn't give
its opponents any easy points.
After a long series of sideouts,
Hilliard buried a shot to give Long
Beach their first point in game
one. The 49'ers battled to a 6-0

advantage before Stanford called
timeout.
Following the break, sopho
more Canyon Ceman put the
Card on the board with a service
ace, then junior Dave Goss fol
lowed with a kill.
But the 49'er defense proved
insurmountable, allowing Long
Beach to blaze to a 11-2 lead.
Junior Bob Hillman came off
the bench for Stanford, sparking
his team to two more quick
points, but the deficit was too big,
as Long Beach closed the game at
15-4.
In game two, Stanford jumped
to a 2-0 lead before Hilliard
unleashed a shot and earned the
serve. But Hillman responded,
blocking for a sideout, then deliv
ering kills to increase the Cardi
nal advantage.
"Bob was a big help off the
bench," Nieves remarked. "He
plays with a lot of emotion and
makes things happen."
The fired-up Stanford squad
claimed victory in game two on
another ace by Ceman.
But Long Beach took control in
game three, forcing the frazzled
Card into several service errors
and cruising to a 13-1 lead.
Replacing Ceman, setter Jimmy
Blackman came off the bench and
helped win five quick Cardinal
points before the 49'ers finished
the game on another kill by
Hilliard.
Stanford led early in game
four, but the persistent 49'ers
outlasted them, ending a 10
match Cardinal winning streak.
Goss led the Card with 30 kills,
followed by senior Duncan Black
man with 11 kills and 17 digs.
In the contest against BYU Fri
day, Stanford fared much better,

downing the Cougars in three
games, 15-7, 15-6, 15-6.
A potent tandem, Goss and
Blackman combined for 28 kills,
leading Stanford to an impressive
.560 team hitting average.

The defeat dropped the
Cougars to 4-12 in WIVA play.
The Cardinal next faces the
Gauchos of California-Santa Bar
bara on Friday night at Burnham
Pavilion. Match time is 7 p.m.
