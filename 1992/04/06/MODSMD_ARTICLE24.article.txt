# Lady netters win two
## Defeat UCLA, USC in Los Angeles 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES-The Los
Angeles Sports Center was not
the only place you could find
Final Four fever Friday and Sat
urday. Several members of the
No. 2 Stanford women's tennis
team had watched the first bas
ketball semifinal on TV and were
trying to vanquish host USC
quickly so they could catch the
Stanford game.
But the Trojans would not fold
that easily. Petra Schmitt took
Heather Willens to three sets in
the first singles match.
"Schmitt was hitting a lot of
deep topspin and she was hitting
the ball hard, getting Heather to
miss a lot of shots into the net,"
said Stanford assistant coach
Lele Forood. "Also, Heather had
to change her play a bit, go off of
Schmitt's forehand and get into
backhand rallies with her." After
dropping a close first set, Willens
made these adjustments and
pulled away, 5-7, 6-2, 6-1.
By the time that Willens had
left the court, Laxmi Poruri,
Kylie Johnson and Amy
Chiminello had all won in
straight sets. With the match
score 4-0, the Cardinal needed
one more victory in singles to
keep the contest from going into
doubles.
Mario Carruth was in a see
saw battle with Linda Allred at
No. 5, while Kelly Fisher was fac
ing Jennifer Nguyen at No. 6.
Carruth clinched a Staford win
with a 7-3 victory in her third-set
tiebreaker, while Fisher finished
on the short end of a 6-4, 6-3
score.
The win gives the Cardinal an
18-1 record, including a 7-0 mark
in the Pacific 10 Conference.

Conference win No. 6 came on
Friday at UCLA. The Bruins,
playing without star Iwalani
McCalla, couldn't match Stan
ford. McCalla, reportedly burned
out from tennis, may not compete
again until the NCAA Champi
onships.
On this weekend, however, her
presence would not have mat
tered.
In what Johnson enthusiasti
cally called a blowout, Stanford
pounded the Bruins, 6-0. Poruri
led the squad with a 6-0, 6-0
blanking of Cammie Foley.
Meanwhile, the Bruins' Paige
Yaroshuk berated herself with
comments like "I can't believe
you're losing to her" during the
No. 3 match with Johnson. Well,
believe it, Yaroshuk. Johnson
won, 6-4, 6-2.
Kristine Kurth had a
marathon match with Lee Ann
Rostovsky at No. 4. Kurth's back
injury hindered her serve and
Rostovsky took the first set, 6-1.
Then the match turned in the
Cardinal sophomore's favor.
"I served underhand and
sliced a bit on my backhand and
that threw her ofT. She choked in
the second and third sets," Kurth
said. She won 1-6, 6-3, 6-4.
At No. 1, Willens beat Mamie
Ceniza 6-4, 7-6, while Carruth
clobbered Helen Tu, 6-3, 6-3, at
No. 6.
In the fifth slot, Chiminello
defeated Jenny Hilt 6-4, 6-1. Hilt
had beaten Emma Woodhouse in
a third-set tiebreaker when
UCLA visited Stanford in early
March.
Woodhouse is suffering from a
hamstring pull and may be ready
for the Cardinal's April 12 con
test with California. Kurth's sta
tus for the match is also uncer
tain.
