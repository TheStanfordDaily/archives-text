# Whiting fulfills tournament 'mission'
## 
### David Schwartz Senior Staff Writer 
LOS ANGELES — Business before
pleasure, the saying goes. Such was the
attitude of Stanford All-America center
Val Whiting this weekend.
Whiting was ever the ideal corporate
executive at the NCAA Women's Final
Four, always keeping her sights on the
big goal while not being afraid to get her
hands dirty in the process, laboring in
the blocks to help the Cardinal bring the
championship back to the Farm.
In Saturday's semifinal against Vir
ginia, Whiting's play kept Stanford in the
game in the second half. When the Cardi
nal guards got her the ball inside, Whit
ing unfailingly managed to score, get
fouled, or both. Whiting finished with 28
points (18 in the second half) and 12
rebounds.
"Val had a great game," Virginia coach
Debbie Ryan said. "She was very effec
tive at the foul line. She gets something
on every possession. We felt we were
effective against her sometimes and
other times not."
A physical matchup took place in the
paint between Whiting and 6-foot-5
Heather Burge of Virginia, but the differ
ence lay in Whiting converting her inside
shots and Burge failing to do so.
With 9:09 remaining in the contest
and the Cardinal trailing by eight, Whit
ing seemed to take matters into her own
hands in trying to lead the Cardinal to
victory.
"I was thinking, 'I don't want to lose
this game,"' she said. "We didn't come to
a semifinal game to lose. I wasn't trying
to take over the game, I was just trying to
go after things offensively and defensive
ly."
"Val stepped up and did a great job for
us," said guard Molly Goodenbour.
"She's so unstoppable on the block. She
was double and triple-teamed, and she
still scored 28 points."
Yet for Whiting, 28 points in the semi
final was not enough—there was still a
job to do.
The team avoided seeing the sights in
the City of Angels, having already done
so in a February Pacific 10 Conference
road trip. The only sight they wanted to
see was that of the championship trophy
in their hands.
"I feel great, but I won't feel really
happy until we win the world. We're on a
mission," said Whiting after the win.
In Sunday's championship game
against Western Kentucky, Whiting
scored a quiet 16 points, half of which
came from free-throws. But the Wilming
ton, Del., native's impact was more than
apparent on the defensive end. She neu
tralized the Lady Toppers' center duo of
starter Paulette Monroe and reserve
Trina Wilson, who combined for a mere
10 points.
Additionally, Whiting was again a
force on the boards, cleaning the glass 13
times.
"Val Whiting is an Ail-American,"
Western Kentucky coach Paul Sander
ford said. "She rebounds so well and does

what she has to do to win."
Whiting also exemplified how well
conditioned coach Tara VanDerveer's
squad was, running the court and keep
ing pace with Stanford's guards while the
fatigued Western Kentucky players
lagged behind.
"For a player to run the floor as well
as she does shows \tfhat kind of player.she
is," VanDerveer said.
Whiting's devotion and untiring effort
earned her a spot on the All-Tournament
team.
"Without her, we wouldn't have done
it," VanDerveer said. "I'm more proud of

her for her leadership than for her phys
ical play. She really helped our young
players—Rachel (Hemmer) and Anita
(Kaplan)—along."
"She makes Tara a great coach, and
Tara makes her a great player. They both
get the best out of each other," added
Sanderford.
Whiting's focus on the championship
was untenable. Now that the Cardinal
has the trophy, is she satisfied?
"I'm satisfied. We are savoring this
feeling for awhile. The heck with next
year," she said.
That is, until practice starts.


Consensus All-America Val Whiting capped a spectacular season with a 44-polnt,
25-rebound performance against Final Four opponents Virginia and Western Ken
tucky.
