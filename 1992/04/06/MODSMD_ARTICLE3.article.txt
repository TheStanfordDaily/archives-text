# COP candidates off and running
## Students First slate promises 'tangible' results 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
In the time frame of ASSU pol
itics, the Students First party is
one of the more established polit
ical groups on campus. This
year's Students First slate run
ning for Council of Presidents,
however, stresses the fact that its
members have not been widely
involved in ASSU Senate affairs.
The senate now "is seen some
what as inbred," said junior Joel
Stein, one of the slate members.
According to Stein, students pic
ture their government discussing
only internal matters such as
election reform bills.
If they win the election, the
Students First slate — Stein,
sophomore John Hall, junior
Preeti Malladi and senior Glyn
Milburn — say they will bring a
new way of viewing student gov
ernment into office with them.
"We plan to encourage, and
demand, effectiveness from the

at the 'Hammer
and Coffin' and 'I

a COP' slates.

senate," said Hall. According to
Hall, the government will produce
"tangible projects" for the student
body under their guidance.
The slate has a list of projects
they would like to see implement
ed, including installing emergen
cy phones on campus, funding a
sexual assault counselor and
holding a spring sports clinic.

The emergency phones, Stein
said, would cost about $1,000 each
and would be placed outside
dorms and in the Quad. The
phones would be used for all types
of on-campus calls, from emergen
cies to pizza deliverers calling to
get into locked dorms, he added.
The slate hopes funding for the
phones will come from the Univer
sity's Communication Services
office, but has not yet approached
the office about the project.
Malladi said her slate is com
mitted to combatting sexual
assault on campus and would
push for continued funding a Sex
ual Assault Prevention Education
Coordinator.
The sports clinic, Hall said,
would be a way to bring student
athletes and non-athletes together.
The clinic would be a day of "food,
music and Adam Keefe teaching
you to do layups," Stein said. Mil
burn, a Stanford football player,
said he had spoken with members

of the Department of Athletics who
were excited by the idea.
Slate members said the clinic
exemplifies another one of their
pledges — to bring diverse groups
of students together. Doing so,
Malladi said, would be the main
way the slate would work for mul
ticulturalism.

'How we see multicul
turalism [includes]
students from differ
ent backgrounds, dif
ferent interests.'

Diversity, she added, does not
just mean including people from
different ethnic groups. "How we
see multiculturalism [includesl
students from different back
grounds, different interests,"
Malladi said. "I think you can see
that on the slate."
Malladi is involved with San
skriti, a campus Indian organiza

tion, and is a resident assistant in
Cedro. Milburn is involved with
the Big Brothers program and is a
running back on Stanford's foot
ball team. Hall is assistant to the
current COP, and has been a sen
ate associate and chair of the sen
ate's Nominations Commission.
Stein has held severaL posts at
The Daily.
Hall said another goal for the
slate is working well with the Uni
versity administration, especially
with incoming president Gerhard
Casper. Hall said the COP would
make sure students had a voice in
major University decisions.
Malladi said the slate's first
priority in dealing with budget
issues would be to maintain need
blind admissions.
The slate's second priority in
budget matters, Stein said, is mak
ing sure financial aid increases if
tuition is increased in the future.
Stein said the slate would fight
any future budget cuts which
threaten Stanford's stature as a
university. "We're willing to
make sacrifices, but we're not
willing to sacrifice the quality of
the University," he said.
