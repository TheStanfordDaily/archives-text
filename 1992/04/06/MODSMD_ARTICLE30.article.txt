### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The U.S. National Team put on a dominant soccer
exhibition Saturday afternoon at Stanford Stadium,
routing the China National Team 5-0 before 31,815
fans.
The victory comes only 12 days after Stanford Sta
dium was selected as one of nine playing sites for the
1994 World Cup — a fact that head coach Bora
Milutinovic emphasized after the game.
"The most important part of playing against this
team was the 30,000 people and public support,"
Milutinovic said. "The field was good and the crowd
was good.
"I would very much like to play at Stanford (dur
ing the World Cup), but it is not my choice to make,"
he added.
Stanford is guaranteed at least six games during
the World Cup and may be selected to host a semifi
nal match.
The game itself was marked by two spectacular
first-half U.S. goals, including a 25-yard direct kick
that curled into the top right corner of the goal by
Hugo Perez and a solo run down the field by Eric
Wynalda.
"They gave us a lot of space to move the ball," said
Perez, who was named most valuable American play
er of both the game and the 1991 season. "They had
lapses and their defense broke down several times,
and we had good movement of the ball to be able to
finish them off."
Both Perez and Wynalda added goals in the sec
ond half to accompany a Dominic Kinnear header off
a beautiful cross by Janusz Michallik (his second
assist of the day).
"We worked hard on a lot of things this week,"
Wynalda said. "We practiced crossing, heading and,

most importantly, shooting on the run. It really paid
oft today."
The Chinese simply seemed to be a step too slow
throughout the game, often creating chances but not
finishing them off. Their sagging defense left huge
gaps in the middle of the field that allowed the U.S.
to control the ball.
Through an interpreter, Chinese head coach Chen
Xirong blamed the loss on exhaustion from the
team's long trip.
"We have spent three days in the air and did not
have enough time to rest," he said. "We were not
even 20 percent of our normal ability.
"The U.S. team did a lot better than we expected,"
Xirong added.
But Milutinovic said he was not satisfied with the
team's play, particularly with the defensive lapses
that would likely have been exploited by a stronger
team.
"We played better against Spain but did not
score. We need to do more work, have better con
centration and be more aggressive," he said.
Saturday's win ended a five game-winless streak
for the U.S. team, when it had scored only one goal.
The team, which had been on the road since the
middle of February, now has a 2-5-1 record for
1992, including tough losses to Brazil, Spain and
Morocco.
"Tomorrow brings another day and another
game," Milutinovic said. "And we need to get ready
to play Ireland (at the end of the month)."
Although Saturday's attendance matched the
crowd at last May's loss to Argentina, no other
games are scheduled for Stanford in the near
future. But organizers said they were confident
that with the interest expressed by Bay Area soccer
fans, Stanford will host at least two more games
before World Cup play begins in two years.
