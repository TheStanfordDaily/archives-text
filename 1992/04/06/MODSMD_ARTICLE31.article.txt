# Golf at S'west Invite
## 
### Andy Eiser Staff Writer 
It's getting to be that time of
the season.
For the Stanford Cardinal
men's golf team, who will be
competing in USC's South
western Invitational in West
lake Village today and tomor
row, the "home stretch" is,just
around the corner. And if the
squad harbors any thoughts of
contending for the Pacific 10
Championship just four weeks
away, now is the time to make a
surge.
"The guys are getting zeroed
in for this tournament," head
coach Wally Goodwin said.
"They know that this is a piv
otal week."
One reason the Cardinal and
its coach may be more focused
than usual is the quality of the
opposition they will be facing.
The Southwestern Invite fea
tures 18 of the nation's best
teams, including host USC,
local rival San Jose State.
Another concern for Stan
ford as it hits 36 of the tour
ney's 54 holes today at the
North Ranch Countiy Club is a
troubling tendency to start
slowly. According to Goodwin,

it is important to play aggres
sively on the North Ranch
course, which requires accura
cy off the tee and an excellent
short game.
"The greens are perfect, and
if the weather is good, they are
fast and hard," Goodwin said.
Hitting the links for the Car
dinal this week will be senior
Christian Cevaer, sophomore
Notah Begay, junior Brad Lan
ning, sophomore Casey Martin
and freshman Jerry Chang.
Stanford's top two golfers,
Cevaer and Begay, will be aim
ing at each other as well as
players from other teams. In an
intriguing duel of their own,
namely the battle to be the Car
dinal's stroke-per-round leader
for 1992, Begay holds a slight
71.4-71.9 edge heading into
this week's play.
Lanning has played his way
up to the third position on the
team. "I see Brad becoming
more of a factor for us this
week," said Goodwin.
Martin is still attempting to
regain the form that made him
one of the Cardinal's top three
linksters a year ago, while the
most pleasant surprise of the
season to date, has been the
development of Chang.
