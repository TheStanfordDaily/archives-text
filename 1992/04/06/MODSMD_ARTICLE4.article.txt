# 'Independents' slate emphasizes public service, student contact
## 
### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
Members of the slate called
"Independents: A New Era" said
their experiences in public service
have inspired their run for the
Council of Presidents.
The members of the indepen
dent slate — sophomores Ron
Brown, Delia Lopez and Jason
Snyder and junior Sherri Wolson
— hope to involve more students
in student government.
According to Snyder, students
are "falling out of touch" with the
ASSU. The slate, Snyder said,
believes that "only real independent
leadership can bring student gov
ernment back to all the students."
To attain this goal, the slate
members said they have three
ideas in mind, all of which center
around public service: regular vis
its to dorms by COP members, the
creation of a COP advisory board
and COP-funded service projects.
The Independents plan on walk
ing door-to-door in the dorms in
order to "bring government to the

students," Lopez said. "It's not
enough to open doors, you must...
get them involved in the whole pro
cess," she said.
A COP advisory board would be
responsible for contributing to the
ASSU decision-making processes.
"This would include many stu
dents from a wide range of back
grounds in order to bring outside
attitudes and ideas into the deci
sions of the ASSU," Lopez said.
The Independents also plan to
invest $1,000 of their own salaries
into getting more students involved
in public service projects. Lopez
called this proposal a part of "putting
our money where our mouth is."
A Frosh Orientation Program,
for example, would get freshman
involved in community service pro
grams during Freshman Orienta
tion, Wolson said, and create an
opportunity for the new students
"to get to know people and get a
feel for community service in the
very beginning."
The Independents said they
hope their own experiences with
public service could make their
projects work.
Brown is majoring in mechani
cal engineering and is currently an
undergraduate senator. He is a
member of the lacrosse team and
tutors for the Teach for America
program.
Lopez, majoring in internation
al relations and Spanish, acts as
program coordinator for El Centro
Chicano, the Chicano/Latino com
munity center.
She is also a tutor coordinator
for the Stanford Literacy
Improvement Program and a
translator for the East Palo Alto
Victim Center.
Snyder, an undeclared sopho
more, is currently an independent
undergraduate senator. He is also
chair of the ASSU's student affairs
committee. His community service
activities include tutoring for the
Ravenswood-Stanford Tutoring
Program and acting as a peer
adviser for the Haas Center for

Public Service.
Wolson is majoring in public
policy and is the chair of the
Stanford in Government pro
gram. She is also the coordinator
for the Stanford in Washington
summer program and a commu
nity service chair for the Chi
Omega sorority.

'The student's voices
must be heard at every
possible level. That is a
main concern of ours.'
—Jason Snyder

Graduate student concerns
are also on the agenda for the
Independents. "Graduate con
cerns deserve our attention,"
said Snyder.
"Issues such as increased teach
ing loads without compensation,
cuts in summer funding, child care
and graduate housing costs and
quality will be made primary, not
secondary, concerns."
Other issues the Independents

are concerned with include tuition
hikes, sexual assault and need
blind admissions. "We must keep
need-blind admissions, work to
prevent sexual assault on our cam
pus and we definitely must stop
excess in tuition hikes," Brown
said.
Brown said he hopes people will
learn as much as they can about all
of the slates and then make their
final decision based on what
they've seen. "We've tried to
become more in touch with the stu
dents in order for them to feel like
student government is accessible to
them at all times," he said. "It
hasn't been easy, but it is neces
sary."
Wolson said that one of the most
important aspects of running a
successful slate is maintaining a
good relationship with the admin
istration, and especially the new
president. "If your student leaders
are interested in the workings of
the University, it sets a good tone
for the rest of the student body,"
she said.
Snyder added: "The student's
voices must be heard at every pos
sible level. That is a main concern
of ours."

in student government.
According to Snyder, students
are "falling out of touch" with the
ASSU. The slate, Snyder said,
believes that "only real independent
leadership can bring student gov
ernment back to all the students."
To attain this goal, the slate
members said they have three
ideas in mind, all of which center
around public service: regular vis
its to dorms by COP members, the
creation of a COP advisory board
and COP-funded service projects.
The Independents plan on walk
ing door-to-door in the dorms in
order to "bring government to the

students," Lopez said. "It's not
enough to open doors, you must...
get them involved in the whole pro
cess," she said.
A COP advisory board would be
responsible for contributing to the
ASSU decision-making processes.
"This would include many stu
dents from a wide range of back
grounds in order to bring outside
attitudes and ideas into the deci
sions of the ASSU," Lopez said.
The Independents also plan to
invest $1,000 of their own salaries
into getting more students involved
in public service projects. Lopez
called this proposal a part of "putting
our money where our mouth is."
A Frosh Orientation Program,
for example, would get freshman
involved in community service pro
grams during Freshman Orienta
tion, Wolson said, and create an
opportunity for the new students
"to get to know people and get a
feel for community service in the
very beginning."
The Independents said they
hope their own experiences with
public service could make their
projects work.

more, is currently an independent

'The student's voices
must be heard at every
possible level. That is a
main concern of ours.'
—Jason Snyder

Graduate student concerns
are also on the agenda for the
Independents. "Graduate con
cerns deserve our attention,"
said Snyder.
"Issues such as increased teach
ing loads without compensation,
cuts in summer funding, child care
and graduate housing costs and
quality will be made primary, not
secondary, concerns."
Other issues the Independents

are concerned with include tuition
hikes, sexual assault and need
blind admissions. "We must keep
need-blind admissions, work to
prevent sexual assault on our cam
pus and we definitely must stop
excess in tuition hikes," Brown
said.
Brown said he hopes people will
learn as much as they can about all
of the slates and then make their
final decision based on what
they've seen. "We've tried to
become more in touch with the stu
dents in order for them to feel like
student government is accessible to
them at all times," he said. "It
hasn't been easy, but it is neces
sary."
Wolson said that one of the most
important aspects of running a
successful slate is maintaining a
good relationship with the admin
istration, and especially the new
president. "If your student leaders
are interested in the workings of
the University, it sets a good tone
for the rest of the student body,"
she said.
Snyder added: "The student's
voices must be heard at every pos
sible level. That is a main concern
of ours."
