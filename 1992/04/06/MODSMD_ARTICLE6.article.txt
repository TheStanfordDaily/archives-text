# Source of Meyer blaze puzzles investigators

Arson may have caused Thursday's fire
in Meyer Library, according to Stanford
Fire Capt. Lee Leonard, although the
investigation still underway has uncov
ered few clues about the mysterious blaze.
Leonard said he was "not going to say it
was arson, but it doesn't appear as if it
could happen mechanically or naturally."
But he added that investigators have
found no charred materials other than the
filters and no odor of petroleum products,
which would have suggested that someone
started the fire in the basement air-filter
ing room.
Also, when the ventilating machine is
on, "it is like 100 miles per hour winds in
there, so any match would be blown out,"
Leonard said.
Stanford Police Sergeant John
McMullen said the fire investigation is con
tinuing and officials are still "going to look
at all to the angles." Investigators "still
have to talk to people who were in the area
and collect evidence," said McMullen, and
"have no one to point at for arson."

But a fire couldn't have started by itself
because the only things in the room are
large filters for the ventilation system and
a small light, Leonard said.
The only material that did burn was
the fiberglass insulation on the filters,
which Meyer director Michael Miller said
is supposed to be nonflammable.
Miller also said the door to the 8-by- 10-
foot steel room is usually locked. All of the
air circulated by the ventilation ducts goes
through the filters, which collect any dust
before the air is discharged under the
north side of the library.
Operations and Maintenance began clean
ing up the damage and replacing the filters
Friday, according to Miller. The cost to repair
the damage is expected to be around $15,000.
There will be no air-conditioning on the
side of the library closest to Green for
about a week as the repairs continue,
Miller said. The only short-term problems
caused by the fire will be a lingering odor
for a few days, he added.
There was no damage to any of the
books, since the smoke had no
residue in it, and Miller said he
does not foresee any problems with
the temporary lack of air condi
tioning.
"It shouldn't feel too bad this
time of year," he said.
The fire shut down the library
for about three hours early Thurs
day afternoon.
The smell of smoke was first
detected in Room 146 on the north
side of the library, Leonard said.
When the fire department arrived,
there was definitely a strong
smoke odor in the rooms around
146, but no smoke was visible and
there was no odor in the lobby or
foyer area.
When the ventilation system
was turned off to rule it out as a
possibility, Leonard said smoke
started coming out of the ducts
and the fire department was able
to locate and extinguish the fire.
Smoke eventually spread
throughout the library by way of
the ventilation ducts, but it was
cleared out in about two hours by
opening the library's windows and
and using fans to circulate fresh air.
Miller said the library periodi
cally holds fire and earthquake
drills and as soon as the fire alarm
went off the evacuation was exe
cuted according to plan.
Although the library's smoke
detectors did not immediately
detect the smoke odors, Leonard
said they worked as soon as the
actual smoke reached them on the
third and fourth floors.
