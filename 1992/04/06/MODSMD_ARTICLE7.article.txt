Mikhail Gorbachev will speak at
Frost Amphitheater rather than
Memorial Auditorium when he
returns to Stanford May 9, at
least tripling the number of peo
ple who will be able to attend.
Gorbachev is coming to Stan
ford as part of a 16-day tour of
the United States. He will receive
a one-day professorship from the
Law School and will give a speech
called "The Rule of the Law."
Memorial Auditorium has a
capacity of about 1,700. Frost is
designed to hold 6,000 but
because of its outdoor setting
has accommodated up to 14,000,
according to Vice President of
Public Affairs Robert Freelen.
Freelen, who is coordinating
Gorbachev's visit, said Hoover
Institution Distinguished Fel
low George Shultz and Acting
Provost Gerald Lieberman
made the final decision on the
switch.
Shultz, a former secretary of

state, is chair of the host com
mittee for the U.S. tour. Gor
bachev will visit his home May 8.
Freelen said he did not know
how many tickets would be
issued or how they would be dis
tributed, but added that a plan
will be announced this week.
Under the original plan, seats
in Memorial Auditorium were
reserved for all Law School stu
dents and the various cospon
sors of the visit. After allotting
these spaces, there were "not
enough [seats] for even a lottery
for faculty, students and staff,"
Freelen said.
Gorbachev's first visit in 1990
came at the height of Gor
bachev's popularity and brought
thousands of outsiders to the
Stanford campus. Tickets for the
Memorial Auditorium speech
were issued through a lottery,
and scalpers reportedly sold
them for as much as $1,800 each.
Gorbachev's visit to the
United States will be longer this
