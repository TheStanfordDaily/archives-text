A Look at the Presidential Campaign
A Town Meeting
Friday, April 10,1992
8:30 p.m.*
at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
Stanford University
Moderated By Ted Koppel
On Friday, April 10, ABC News Nightline will broadcast live a Town Meeting
from Stanford University examining voter attitudes about the presidential
campaign. Several of the presidential candidates will take questions from an
invited audience including Stanford faculty, staff, and students and
representatives of the surrounding communities.
The broadcast will focus on public attitudes and concerns about the political
process that determines the selection of the President of the United States.
Almost all the polls reflect a growing anger over how presidential campaigns are
run, as well as a perceived failure of leadership on all sides. The Nightline Town
Meeting will give American voters an opportunity to raise these issues with the
presidential candidates.
Seats will be set aside for a total of 300 Stanford faculty, staff and students, who
will be identified in a random drawing. The names of those individuals selected
will appear in Thursday's Daily. If your name appears on the list, you can pick
up your tickets (please bring a current Stanford ID) in White Plaza between 10-6
p.m. Thursday. Unclaimed tickets will be available on a first-come first-served
basis between 12-1 p.m. on Friday.
For additional information, call the Office of Public Affairs at 723-2862.
*Admission by ticket only. Please arrive at 7:00 p.m. when doors open. Doors close promptly at 8:00
p.m. The Town Meeting will begin at 8:30 p.m. and run approximately 90 minutes.
