Editorials represent a majority of the editorial board. The board consists of nine Daily editors, two at-large
staff members and one at-large editorial writer selected from the community by the Daily staff.

Bookstore's board has
a lot to prove following
its failure in oversight

Back in February, the presi
dent of the Stanford Book
store's board of directors
was trying to justify the royal
perquisites provided to the store's
top managers.
They "are among the best col
lege book people in the country,"
said History Prof. Peter Stansky.
. Well, it appears that the board
president was at least partially
right. Eldon Speed and Philip
Chiaramonte are "among the
best" in at least one college book
store category — losing money in
lousy investments.
The Bookstore squandered
nearly $2 million in the stock mar
ket last year — almost 10 percent
of the store's total assets. Law
Prof. Robert Weisberg, a board
member, is blaming the losses on
the ex-controller's "horrendous"
investment decisions.
Weisberg says the "rather spec
ulative" investments were made
without the knowledge of Speed,
the store's general manager, or the
board of directors.
This is a difficult explanation to
accept.
How could the "best college
book people in the country" not
know that their Bookstore invest
ed nearly $5 million in the stock
market? "
The losses make community
members queasy for several rea
sons, from the symbolic to the
purely practical.
First, after the glowing press
coverage of boyish, squeaky-clean
Gerhard Casper, continued public
condemnation of unusual financial
dealings on the Stanford campus
leaves a bitter taste. As Political
Science Prof. Terry Karl said, "a
number of people are very con
cerned about what this is doing to
our reputation."

Second, many Bookstore cus
tomers are concerned with the
pocketbook issues raised by the
investment loss — they are right
fully concerned that their money
was squandered.
Back in February, Stansky assert
ed: "The Bookstore has pursued a
very generous policy in terms of
rebates. The Bookstore shares its
affluence with the community."
But take a look at the numbers.
Last year, the Bookstore returned
$309,000 in rebates to students and
faculty. The investment losses were
about six times that amount. How
can community members trust that
rebates are in fact "generous"?
Among the problems with the
workings of the Bookstore, none is
more disturbing than the lax over
sight from the Bookstore's board.
Made up of seven Stanford fac
ulty, staff members and students,
the board is the link between the
independently-run Bookstore and
all those associated with Stan
ford's name.
The board has the ultimate
responsibility for keeping watch
over the Bookstore — both its
investments and its compensation
practices — and for keeping the
Stanford name out of the mud.
But the board was asleep at the
wheel.
After the first wave of Book
store revelations, the board presi
dent, defending luxury cars and a
wooded retreat leased to its top
managers by its top managers,
said, "I think Stanford should do
what's best for itself and what best
serves the community."
Ironically, Stansky was right on
target — although inadvertently.
Members of the Bookstore's
board should do what best serves
the community. But the only way
they can do that is by owning up to
a detailed, honest accounting of
their mistakes, and those of their
managers.
The Bookstore's board of direc
tors must act quickly and emphat
ically when the Bookstore's team
of auditors returns its conclusions
"in a few weeks."
