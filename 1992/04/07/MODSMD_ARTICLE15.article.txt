## Lives without shadows 
### 
HOW CAN I TELL YOU what's
bothering me? I find it so diiTicult
to talk about my problems some
times because they seem so trivial when I
think of the problems that other people
have, both here at Stanford and elsewhere.
I think of the young man with the cin
namon-colored hair I passed in front of
Suzanne's Muffins on University Avenue.
He was holding a cardboard sign: "I am
homeless and hungry." In the face of this,
the pressures I feel and problems I have
should disappear.
And yet, my God, why do I shut my
door and cry into my pillow at night so no
one will hear me?
With its sun, palm trees and people
playing frisbee in the Oval, thife campus
gives off an idyllic sense. We go to classes,
we play tennis, we study, we eat and sleep.
I remember someone at Stanford once told
me, "Come on, how hard could life be for
anyone at Stanford?"
And that makes me laugh and cry a little.
I don't know how many people really
think that here. I know I used to until I
realized how many people abuse them
selves through food, alcohol or other
drugs in an effort to deal with other prob
lems. Until I realized how many of my
friends have gone to CAPS (Counseling
and Psychological Services at Cowell) for
counseling. Including myself.
It seems like something to be ashamed
of or embarrassed about. I remember

going to a reception on campus and run
ning into my counselor. I couldn't decide
whether to pretend not to know her or
just act natural. Then she came up to me
and said hi, and that pretty much decided
that. But I was glad she did it.
I don't talk about the times when I
went to CAPS. There usually isn't a rea
son to. And so I suppose most other peo
ple don't either, whether they had family
problems, academic problems, or prob
lems dealing with physical or sexual
abuse. Maybe that's why we tend to think
that everyone's okay here.
And yet, even though friends of mine
had gone to CAPS before me, I still didn't
want to go. Part of it was pride and fear.
I had to admit to myself that I had a prob
lem, one that I couldn't easily solve by
myself. And I needed to realize that ask
ing for help didn't mean I was weak. Or
stupid. Or "not all there."
College is a time when many of us
make the transition from being some
one's son or daughter to being an inde
pendent adult. For me, being away from
my family has allowed me to develop my
own beliefs and values, some of which do
not agree with theirs.
Last winter break, I had an argument
with my mother about homosexuality.
The issue arose out of a comment she
made about AIDS victims. Fortunately,
my sister and brother were there too and
helped support my argument, but it was

clear that she wouldn't change her mind.
It makes me angry and upset some
times to deal with my family. It is diffi
cult because the rules that work here
don't work at home. I can't just try to
reason. I can't just try to talk about it and
get things out in the open. Perhaps if I
didn't care about them, it wouldn't both
er me so much.
These are some of the things that I've
never talked about with anyone. I don't
know why. I guess it goes along with all
the other assumptions that people often
make here. That things are great, every
thing works, and we're not dealing with
any real problems in our private lives.
I know I am guilty of this. It came as a
surprise to me when a friend recently
stopped out. I had no clue that anything
was wrong in his life.
Sometimes it is really lonely here.
Even with friends. It isn't always easy to
just go tell someone what's on your mind,
what's wrong. Or even acknowledge that
how you're feeling is important. I just
want people to know that there's some
one else out there who feels the same
way.

that everyone's okay here.
And yet, even though friends of mine
had gone to CAPS before me, I still didn't
want to go. Part of it was pride and fear.
I had to admit to myself that I had a prob
lem, one that I couldn't easily solve by
myself. And I needed to realize that ask
ing for help didn't mean I was weak. Or
stupid. Or "not all there."
College is a time when many of us
make the transition from being some
one's son or daughter to being an inde
pendent adult. For me, being away from
my family has allowed me to develop my
own beliefs and values, some of which do
not agree with theirs.
Last winter break, I had an argument
with my mother about homosexuality.
The issue arose out of a comment she
made about AIDS victims. Fortunately,
my sister and brother were there too and
helped support my argument, but it was

clear that she wouldn't change her mind.
It makes me angry and upset some
times to deal with my family. It is diffi
cult because the rules that work here
don't work at home. I can't just try to
reason. I can't just try to talk about it and
get things out in the open. Perhaps if I
didn't care about them, it wouldn't both
er me so much.
These are some of the things that I've
never talked about with anyone. I don't
know why. I guess it goes along with all
the other assumptions that people often
make here. That things are great, every
thing works, and we're not dealing with
any real problems in our private lives.
I know I am guilty of this. It came as a
surprise to me when a friend recently
stopped out. I had no clue that anything
was wrong in his life.
Sometimes it is really lonely here.
Even with friends. It isn't always easy to
just go tell someone what's on your mind,
what's wrong. Or even acknowledge that
how you're feeling is important. I just
want people to know that there's some
one else out there who feels the same
way.
