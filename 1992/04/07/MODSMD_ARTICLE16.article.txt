Cutting SWOPSI undermines democratic education

CAN YOU PICTURE Stanford with
Allan Bloom as provost, a white
theme house, and a McDonald's in
Tresidder? How about Stanford without
need-blind admissions and without
SWOPSI?
The former Brave New Stanford
vision seems a bit too close to reality to
be simply laughed off, and the latter
changes are directly on our doorsteps.
Stanford is at a historical turning
point. In the past year we have seen
some abuses of hierarchial privilege in
the cost analysis, and on a lesser scale,
the Bookstore fiascoes, which have dealt
a blow to Stanford's "good name."
Through the process of budget deci
sions and hiring a new president we are
witnessing the formation of the new,
clean-cut Stanford of the '90s.

Times of budget and legitimation
crises such as these reveal where the
true commitments of the University lie.
With the hiring of a president from
an institution with very different educa
tional values who has little sense of the
history of Stanford, and who has said
that need-blind admissions need to be
reconsidered, and with the budget cuts
in which SWOPSI (including women's
self defense), the Drama Department,
and American Studies, among others,
stand to be drastically cut or eliminated,
the vision of the '90s is slowly taking
shape.
Where do we, the students, fit into
this process? Are we merely the econom
ic base (9.5 percent tuition hike) and the
passive consumer of the academic prod
uct (at the mercy of the Bookstore and

the professor up there at the lectern), or
can we actively shape the institution and
our education?
For the last 20 years one important
way many students have been doing the
latter is by developing and maintaining
SWOPSI. SWOPSI has provided a
democratic forum for students to learn
actively and experientially from commu
nity members and each other, and to
affect policy at the university, local, and
even larger levels.
Historically, SWOPSI classes have
provided students with the opportunity
to explore subjects not found in the
institutionalized curriculum, such as
environmentalism in the early '70s, fem
inism in the late '70s, and multicultural
ism in the '80s.
SWOPSI classes have consistently

been the creative forum in which
marginalized topics make their first
appearance. SWOPSI, like need-blind
admissions, is central to Stanford's com
mitment to democratic education.
So what can we do? Currently a stu
dent-run workshop is developing alter
natives for a future de-institutionalized
SWOPSI. Frosh and sophomores who
are concerned about the future of Stan
ford now have the opportunity to partici
pate in creating their own educational
environment.
Also, older students who have taken
SWOPSI can lend valuable experience to
this project. There are many ways to get
involved, and credit, at least for one
more quarter, is available.
