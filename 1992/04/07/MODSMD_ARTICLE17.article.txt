# Victim claims gas leak was far from harmless
## 
### 
Regarding the widespread methyl
mercaptan gas deliberately vented from
the McCullough Building April 2 by a
researcher: I would like to know who the
researcher was and why s/he was
allowed to commit such an irresponsible
act.
The e-mail message sent to everyone
in the Durand Building stated "it posed
no hazard to the building occupants."
Really? I would like to report that my
throat and bronchial tubes were raw
and I coughed for three hours straight
after being exposed to this supposedly
"innocuous" gas.
My chest felt tight and I had difficul
ty breathing. I am not the only one in
the Durand Building who experienced
these symptoms.
The e-mail message goes on to reas
sure us: "EH&S personnel will follow
up with the researcher to correct the
odor release problem."

I am reminded of a quote from a
Western: "We have a rope and a posse
All we need is a tree."
