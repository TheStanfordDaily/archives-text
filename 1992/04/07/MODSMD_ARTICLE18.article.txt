# Students propose plan to alter role of senators
## 
### 
This letter is in response to Ari
Richter's column on the worthiness of
ASSU Senators. The senate definitely
needs to be accountable to the student
body. However, some of the proposals
made by Richter and John Hall are very
problematic. We suggest an alternate plan
Hall recommends a system that
assigns senators to specific residential
areas. This system, the article claims,
would allow each residential area to be
strictly and directly represented
through their senator.
The reality of dorm life at Stanford
makes such representation impossible.
Campus residences are designed to

include many different types of people.
Issues in the senate cross these lines
of culture, departments of study, finan
cial aid, and dictate the rules for stu
dent life. A consensus could not be
reached.
A senator should not be asked to rep
resent many interests faithfully.
We disagree that a senator could rep
resent a specific residence properly
under a consensus. Reaching a consen
sus opinion is the senate's job.
We do agree that senators should be
assigned to specific residences. There is
a distinct benefit in having such a
diverse population in every residence. A
senator would be able to receive input
from many different perspectives and
could then make a decision which was
more representative of his or her dis
trict and the student body.
During house meetings a senator
would not only collect opinions from
residents on current issues, but also
update them on the latest ASSU devel
opments in the atmosphere of an open
forum. This process would be mandato
ry for all senators and senate associates.

Too often senators make decisions based
on their own ideologies and have closed
the ASSU by not actively seeking out
the opinions of the students.
Through the system of dorm assign
ments, senators would gain insight and
information regarding the needs and
concerns of the student body.
Presently there is no consistent and
reliable method to collect these opinions.
The influx of ideas into the ASSU would
lead to a more accurate representative
body and a stronger, more confident
assembly to serve student needs, especially
in dealings with the new administration.
The senate would become a valuable
institution that would start living up to
its name — the Associated Students of
Stanford University.
