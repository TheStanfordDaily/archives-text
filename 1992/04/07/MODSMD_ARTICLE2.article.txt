## Phone book profits may fund sexual assault counselor 
### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
Surplus money from the Stanford
Directory will be used to fund a new half
time sexual assault resources position, if
the ASSU Senate approves a plan pro
posed by the Dean of Students' Office.
Under the plan, the Directory will be
administered by the ASSU rather than
the dean's office, according to Director of
Student Activities Nanci Howe.
Howe said the half-time position
within Cowell's Health Promotion Pro
gram will be filled by a professional with

a master's degree and will be funded for
three years.
Council of Presidents member John
Overdeck, who has been meeting with
Dean of Students Michael Jackson about
the project, said it would be a while before
the Senate actually votes on the proposal
— "no earlier than four weeks."
However, he said, "It's been done in
principle."
The new staff member is not intended
as a replacement for the Sexual Assault
Prevention Education Office coordina
tor, and will work in a different Cowell
department, Howe said. The Coalition

Against Sexual Assault, a student group,
is requesting a $40,000 special ASSU fee
to cover the costs of running the office
and hiring a replacement for current
coordinator Susan Epstein.
Epstein's position was funded as a
one-year special project of the ASSU, and
its continuation will likely hinge on the
approval of the coalition's fee request. If
the request is denied, Epstein's office will
fall under the auspices of the new half
time staff member.
Overdeck said the student-run direc-
tory has been put under the
administration of the ASSU
because the dean's office would
have to pay taxes on the publica
tion's surplus revenues and
because the operation of a directo
ry is not in the mission of the
dean's office.
The ASSU doesn't have to pay
taxes because it doesn't make a
profit and the projects it under
takes hold educational value.
Jackson did not return phone
calls yesterday.
Directory funds have been
used to finance various special
projects in the past, "but not in a
systematic way," Overdeck said,
adding that the phonebook only
began making money a few years
ago, when it started selling ads.
The exact amount of the sur
plus has not yet been determined,
but Overdeck estimated it to be
around $40-45,000.
If the surpluses are that high,
Lake Lagunita programs will also

receive $10-15,000, and the other
$25-30,000 will fund the half
time position, Overdeck said.
Howe confirmed that the
amount earmarked for the
Resources Center will be "about"
$30,000.
There has been some concern
that a half-time employee will not
be able to handle all the work.
Epstein said she is glad the Uni
versity is finally looking for a long
term coordinator of sexual assault
resources, but that "someone
working half time is just not
enough. I work 15 to 18 hours a
day and I still have so much to do."
Overdeck agreed, saying, "Per
sonally, I don't think [the funds]
are enough," but added that he was
glad something was being done.
"The principal responsibility is
to get something started. The
University is going through hard
times," he said.
But other students believe the
University's efforts just aren't
satisfactory.
Coalition member Karen
Kramer, a senior, said the
Resource Center needs more than

just one half-time person, adding
that there is a need for more per
sonnel to deal with the survivors of
sexual assault.

There has been
some concern that a
half-time employee
will not be able to
handle all the work.

Currently, Cowell Health Cen
ter has a five-member team,
called the Cowell Sexual Assault
Response and Referral Team,
working 24 hours to handle calls
from sexual assault or harass
ment survivors, but Kramer said
that was not enough.
C-SARRT is a "token band
aid," she said. "They didn't put
out enough publicity and not
enough students know about it. It
doesn't do enough in terms of
really reaching out to students."

began making money a few years
ago, when it started selling ads.
The exact amount of the sur
plus has not yet been determined,
but Overdeck estimated it to be
around $40-45,000.
If the surpluses are that high,
Lake Lagunita programs will also

receive $10-15,000, and the other
$25-30,000 will fund the half
time position, Overdeck said.
Howe confirmed that the
amount earmarked for the
Resources Center will be "about"
$30,000.
There has been some concern
that a half-time employee will not
be able to handle all the work.
Epstein said she is glad the Uni
versity is finally looking for a long
term coordinator of sexual assault
resources, but that "someone
working half time is just not
enough. I work 15 to 18 hours a
day and I still have so much to do."
Overdeck agreed, saying, "Per
sonally, I don't think [the funds]
are enough," but added that he was
glad something was being done.
"The principal responsibility is
to get something started. The
University is going through hard
times," he said.
But other students believe the
University's efforts just aren't
satisfactory.
Coalition member Karen
Kramer, a senior, said the
Resource Center needs more than

just one half-time person, adding
that there is a need for more per
sonnel to deal with the survivors of
sexual assault.

There has been
some concern that a
half-time employee
will not be able to
handle all the work.

Currently, Cowell Health Cen
ter has a five-member team,
called the Cowell Sexual Assault
Response and Referral Team,
working 24 hours to handle calls
from sexual assault or harass
ment survivors, but Kramer said
that was not enough.
C-SARRT is a "token band
aid," she said. "They didn't put
out enough publicity and not
enough students know about it. It
doesn't do enough in terms of
really reaching out to students."
