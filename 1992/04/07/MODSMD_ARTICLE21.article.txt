## Queen of individual medleys rules swimming world 
### Quinn Moo Staff writer 
Under blue spring skies, beneath warm aquama
rine water, Summer Sanders is making music. She
navigates across deGuerre pool with minimal splash,
knifing through the water lap after lap. Occasional
ly she'll take a breather, then continue swimming
6,000-8,000 meters, or 60-80 laps. Each lap is a
verse, each stroke a syllable.
Sanders harmonizes this series of notes and
sounds into melodies, and finally a medley. Like any
professional, she repeats her favorite songs (the 200-
and 400-meter individual medley) time after time,
until it sounds just right.
Sanders' song is headed for the Summer
Olympics in Barcelona. She skimmed past competi
tors to win the 200 and 400 IMs and the 200 butter
fly, and finished second in the 100 fly at the U.S.
Olympic Trials at Indianapolis. The gregarious 19-
year-old will compete in these events and two relays
in Barcelona.
Two weeks later, Sanders sailed to six victories at
the NCAA championships in Austin, Texas. She
nailed down firsts in the 200 and 400 IMs and the
200 fly. She also had a hand in three winning relay
teams (200 Medley, 400 Medley, 400 Free) when the
Stanford women's team won its third-ever NCAA
title, amassing 735.5 points to distance second-place
Texas (651).
Sanders clocked 4 minutes, 2.28 seconds in the
400 IM, shaving three seconds off the American
record she set at the 1991 NCAAs. With better strat
egy, Sanders says she can pierce the four-minute
mark.
"If I swim a little smarter, I know I can go faster,"
Sanders promised.
But today, Sanders is having fun. The air tem
perature hovers around 80 degrees at deGuerre, and
the warm California sun is smiling long into late
afternoon. Time seems to slow down on days like
this, and after the 2-hour practice Sanders is tired

but still energetic.
"It feels good to get in the pool," Sanders says.
After finishing the requisite water workout she
takes off a black swimming cap emblazoned with a
cardinal S, removes her goggles and glides beneath
the surface. She is in her element, her sanctuary.
"You can work out the daily frustrations in the
pool," Sanders said. In such beatific conditions, how
can one disagree?
Yet paradoxically, Sanders' pleasure is also her
pain. She says the toughest part is not the high-pres
sure meets or the national spotlight, but rather the
day-to-day workouts. During the strenuous seven
month collegiate season she averages five morning
and five afternoon practices a week.
"You work out day after day after day. It's hard.
Sometimes I have to dig down deep," Sanders said.
Endurance, technique and power water work are
coupled with free weights and flexibility training on
dry land, head coach Richard Quick said.
Quick, who first noticed Sanders at the Goodwill
Games in 1988, says he is "trying to improve on
what was already there." For both individual medley
events, he says they refine her weaker freestyle and
backstroke, and perfect the stronger fly and breast.
Such preparation has paid off in the pool. Quick
has guided Stanford to two NCAA crowns and a pair
of runner-up trophies, and Sanders has thrived,
ranked No. 1 in the world in the 200 fly and second
in the 200 IM.
Endurance, precise strokes and Sander's go-for
broke mentality mark her ascension to the top of
American swimming in a difficult race: the individu
al medley.
There is nothing like the IM in any other sport. It
consists of four strokes: the butterfly, the back
stroke, the breaststroke and freestyle. The psycho
logical and physical demands place medley swim
mers in a unique category.
"The race is so long. You can't really get into a
groove because you're changing strokes. I don't
know what to compare it to. You use every muscle

because there's so many strokes," Sanders said.
To complicate matters, each swimmer favors par
ticular strokes over others. In competition, one
swimmer may sprint ahead in the breast, only to fall
behind on the free.
"You can't think a lot about people next to you.
People have different strengths and weaknesses,"
Sanders said.
The swimmer's limited field of vision, usually
only a single lane, is also a problem. "It's hard to see
people around you. It isn't like track, where you can
hear someone coming behind you," Sanders
explained.
"When you get to the NCAAs or the Olympics,
everyone in the pool has natural ability. Her psycho
logical makeup allows her to prepare for great

efforts, and to win great races/' Quick said.
To prepare for events, Sanders usually remains
with fellow team members to chat and calm herself
down. But when she steps into the blocks, she
always asks herself the same questions.
"I say to myself, 'How badly do I want this?' then
I convince myself I can do it," Sanders said.
Once she hits the water, Sanders "tries not to
think about anything." She says the individual med
ley gives swimmers a lot of time to think, to lose
their edge and ultimately flail.
Despite the psychological and physical hurdles,
Sanders finds ways to win when it matters, Quick
says.
"She can swim almost every event and is going to

Sophomore Summer Sanders wins yet another 200-meter butterfly, this one against archrival Texas last
November. Sanders will be heading to Barcelona this summer as one of the top swimmers in the world.
