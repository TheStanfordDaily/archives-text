# Track and field keeps turning in impressive numbers

### Nick Clements Staff writer 
The Stanford Track and Field team
appears to be on a veiy serious runner's
high right now.
Coming off the heels of the hugely
successful Stanford Invitational in late
March and a second place finish for the
women in the NCAA Indoor Champi
onships (held in Indianapolis) in mid-
March, the team is beginning to assert
itself as it looks ahead toward the Pacif
ic 10 Conference and NCAA Champi
onships later this spring.
The women's second place finish is
startling, considering the fact that Stan
ford only sent two athletes to the Indoor
Championships. Chryste Gaines
emerged as the national champion in
the 55-meter dash in a time of 6.68 sec
onds. Jackie Edwards won the long
jump with a leap of 21 feet, 8 3/4 inches
while placing third in the triple jump
with a leap of 42-6.
"This was the highest finish ever (in
the Indoor Championships) for sending
the fewest number of athletes," said
assistant coach Betsy Riccardi. "We felt
pretty confident that Chryste and Jack
ie would do well individually. We were
pleasantly surprised by our team show
ing, though. We were competing against

the top teams in the U.S., like LSU,
Texas, Tennessee, and we beat them
all." National champion Florida, in con
trast, sent between 12 and 15 athletes
to Indianapolis.
Gaines, who is the clear favorite to
win the 100-meter dash this spring in
the outdoor championships, continued
her incredible spring run this past
weekend at the Texas Relays, where she
won the event handily against other
sprinters from the tofT SOUtftWCsTfefft
and Southeastern colleges. A native of
Texas who still holds the state 100-
meter dash record in high school compe
tition, Gaines' time of 11.23 seconds
was a Cardinal record and was the sec
ond-best time ever in the Pac-10.
Along with Gaines and Edwards, six
other Stanford athletes were in Texas
this weekend competing for national
prominence. The women's 400-meter
relay team, which consists of Rhonda
Oliver, Ali Callicoatte, Gaines, and
Edwards, qualified provisionally for the
NCAA Championships with a time of
45.83 seconds. Alex Accetta took sixth
place in the mile with a time of 4:10.23,
while Travis Clark jumped 6-10 in the
high jump. Pat Stowell, who has been
enjoying a remarkable spring in the dis
cus throw, took eighth place with a
throw of 173-feet-7-inches despite feel

ing under the weather.
"I was happy that I did that that well
since I was kind of sick this weekend,"
Stowell said. "Right now, my goal is to
reach the NCAAs." Stowell, whose per
sonal best in the discus is 178-2, needs a
throw of 191-11 to qualify automatical

said assistant coach Scott Chisam, who
was coaching at UC-Davis this weekend
in the Stan Wright Invitational as the
Cardinal went up against other top
Northern California teams. Although
no team scores were kept, the Cardinal
had several outstanding individual per
formances.
Dave Popejoy, in particular, contin
ued his success in the hammer throw
this spring as he won with a toss of 204-
1.
"There was a cow out there that
would raise a ruckus every time Dave
threw the hammer, so I knew he had a
fan," Chisam said.
Gary Stolz and Dave Scudamore also
highlighted the meet for Stanford as
they finished first and second in respec
tive times of 14:29.1 and 14:33.7 in the

-5000-meter run. Stolz also took
second in the 1500 meter run in a
personal best time of 3:56.35.

Matt Karsevar took third place in
the shot put with a throw of 51-7
and fourth in the discus with a
throw of 159-9. Christy Boyd and
Karen Ehresman finished first
and second in the women's 100-
meter hurdles as they both came
across the finish line in a dead

heat with a time of 15.2 seconds.
Chris Garrett also excelled as he
took third in the 400-meter dash
with a time of 49.52 seconds.
"We call this our championship
part of the season," Chisam said.
"We're separating our champi
onship athletes from our regular

athletes. It's really easy to get
excited about competing in the
Stanford Invite. But when Dave
can go out and still throw the
hammer 204 feet in a meet that
doesn't mean as much, that's
showing you're among the top
athletes in the United States."
