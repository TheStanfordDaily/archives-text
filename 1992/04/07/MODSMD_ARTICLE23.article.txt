# Stanford's three championships are only the beginning
## 
### 
Stanford University — "Home of
Champions "
To some it may seem pretentious,
but to those who know, it is simply
true. Following the leads of their
aquatic friends, the women's basketball
team became the third Stanford squad to
bring home a national championship this
year. Gritty in their comeback against
Virginia, and graceful in their domina
tion of Western Kentucky, the Cardinal
put all the doubting aside and claimed
their second title in three years.
Dynasty?
Maybe. It would not be a surprise any
way. Tara VanDerveer and her staff have
created a program of excellence in an
environment that is tailored for just that.
Success is a way of life for Stanford ath
letes. There is pressure to do well, but it
is a pressure that is self-imposed, as
Stanford kids have this nasty habit of

being the best. They have been doing so
for decades, and seem poised to continue
to do so for more to come.
All of which leads me to believe that
last Sunday was not the end of this year's
national team championships for Stan
ford University. In a weekend that pre
sented a cornucopia of athletic viewing
opportunities, Cardinal athletes showed
that more celebration may be on the way.
Sure, not everybody won, but losing can
often be a good learning tool. As it stands,
Stanford can win a total of seven nation
al championships this year.
With three already in, here are the lat
est contenders....
Men's volleyball
The men lost to No.l Long Beach
State Saturday in four sets, but according
to NCAA single game kill record holder
Dave Goss, his team has yet to play as
well as they can against the 49er's. Goss

thinks if the Cardinal ever puts it all
together, they will win in the WTVA play
offs. For those doubters, let's return to
the losing-as-a-learning-tool concept:
Michigan lost to higher ranked Ohio
State twice in the regular season (as
Stanford has now done to Long Beach
State) and then met again in the NCAAs.
Guess who played for the National
Championships last night and who sat
home in Columbus and watched?
Women's tennis
Already holders of the last six national
championship trophies, the women hope
number seven will indeed prove lucky.
With a 14-1 record, Frank Brennan's
squad does seem poised for another ban
ner year. Last weekend the women swept
the L.A. schools and it seems that only
the team that beat them in the National
Indoors — Florida — will challenge them
for the outdoor title. Like last year, the

women's ace in the hole is the fact that
the NCAAs are to be played in the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium.
Men's tennis
The men may have given up their No.
1 ranking when they lost to USC 5-4, but
that does not mean their championship
hopes are dead. In a year when coach Dick
Gould did not expect much, the men wait
ed until last Saturday to lose their first
match, and have proven they can beat

anybody. They beat USC in the National
Indoors, and Saturday's match could
have gone either way. Alex O'Brien is
pretty much a given win at No. 1 singles,
and the rest of the team has shown it has
the depth and talent to win it all. If Gould
can get his doubles squads to play to their
potential this team should return from
Athens, Ga. with another Championship
trophy.
Men's gymnastics
Fresh off their Pacific 10 Conference
Championships win, the men's gymnas
tics team has to be this campus' best kept
secret. Currently the No.l team in the
nation, the Cardinal boast Pac-10 Gym
nast of the Year Jair Lynch as well as for
mer U.S. National Champ Tim Ryan. If
the Cardinal qualifies in the regionals,
they should be the team to beat at the
NCAAs in Lincoln, Neb.
