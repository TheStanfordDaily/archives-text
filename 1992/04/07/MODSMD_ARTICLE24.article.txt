### Brandi Shipp Staff Writer 
For the Stanford womens'
gymnastics team, it has been a
season of stress and strain, tri
umph and disappointment. This
Saturday, these women will be
given the opportunity to prove
that their dedication and determi
nation throughout the season
have not been in vain.
Saturday, April 11, the women,
now ranked 15th in the nation,
will head north to Berkeley for the
NCAA Regional Championships.
This is by far the most important
meet of the season, as their per
formance at this meet will deter
mine if they go on to the national
championships to be held later

this month in St. Paul, Minn.
One important factor in the
mental preparation of the Cardi
nal is the presence of the fans,
who have come out as a strong
force. The womens' gymnastics
team has had the biggest crowds
ever during this season, and have
set new attendance records at
home. "Women's gymnastics is a
great spectator sport, and the gym
fans have had a major impact on
our performance," assistant coach
Lisa Mitzel-Izzi said.
Because of the importance of
the fan support, the womens'
team is offering a fan bus up to
Saturday's meet at Harmon Gym
at Cal. The bus leaves Saturday
evening at 5 p.m. from Maples
parking lot, going straight to Har

mon gym. It will return to Stan
ford after the competition, around
11 p.m. On the bus, fans will be
given pom-poms, sodas, 10.0
signs, 1992 team posters, and
1992 team programs and stats.
The bus, available to anyone,
costs only five dollars. Interested
fans should sign up at Burnham
Pavilion with Kass Cazier in the
upstairs office, from 8 a.m. to 12
p.m., from now until Friday.
"The most important element
that could help us qualify to
Nationals is having our fans there
to cheer us on," Mitzel-Izzi said.
"NCAA Regionals is rarely within
driving distance, and we believe
having our fans at the most
important meet of the season may
make it our best meet ever."
