St. Mary's today at 2:30 p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
The Cardinal nine must regroup after a shock
ing weekend. Stanford was swept by Bay Area
rival California, the last-place team in the South
ern Division of the Pacific 10 Conference.
It was the first sweep of the Cardinal by the
Golden Bears since 1977. The Golden Bears won
10-5, 6-5, 11-6. Stanford dropped to 20-14, 7-8 in
the Six-Pac, and dropped from No. 6 to No. 12 in
Baseball America's weekly poll of collegiate base
ball.
Men's tennis:
The Stanford men's tennis team plays Fresno
State today at 1:30 p.m. at the Tennis Stadium.
The Cardinal will attempt to bounce back from a
tough loss to defending national champion USC

last Saturday.
Coach Dick Gould says that between now and
the NCAA Tournament, the team needs to "stay
healthy, shake off the loss fast, [and] keep the
momentum going."
Even in the heart-breaking defeat the Stanford
team can look to some positives.
"[The team is] starting to believe in them
selves," Gould said. "They really showed me a lot
at the USC match."
In other Cardinal tennis news, Alex O'Brien
and Chris Cocotos were named the Volvo Ten
nis/Doubles Team of the Month for their perfect
record in March. The duo have compiled a 14-2
record overall.
This is Stanford's third straight doubles team
to capture the award for the month of March.
Jared Palmer and Jonathan Stark won the award
in 1990 and 1991.
