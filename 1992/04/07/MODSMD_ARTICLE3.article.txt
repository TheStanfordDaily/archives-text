# COP hopefuls pledge not to lead too much
## If they win, they won't lead 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Members of the"I Prefer Not
to Have a COP" slate are offering
students an unusual choice if they
win the election: they promise to
put themselves out of a job.
Slate members Blake Ilstrup, a
junior, and seniors Paul Kwon,
Ted Lai and Ed Mun pledge that
if their slate wins the April 15-16
ASSU elections, they will abolish
their office and put the salaries
they would have received toward
funding student projects.
"We're labeling this whole
thing as a casual revolution," said
Mun, who believes students are
"annoyed" with ASSU govern
ment and want the change.
"We're very serious about
this," he said.
Ilstrup said the slate will
divert the $4,000 per person COP
salary to help fund the student
organizations already receiving

ASSU funding.
"We're not going to make any
money from this," said Kwon. "In
our opinion, this is the best way to
streamline the ASSU."
According to Ilstrup, the differ
ent roles of the COP would be
taken over by commissions of
ASSU senators if the office is dis
mantled. The COP's duties
include overseeing ASSU
finances, service projects and
business projects.
Mun said the business projects
"could run themselves," and the
COP's advisory role is unneces
sary. "Overseeing people who
have a better idea of what's going
on" than the COP is a waste of
time, he added.
The COP is also charged with
"coordinating Association activi
ties in the University policy-mak
ing structure" — representing the
ASSU in the University adminis
tration. But the slate believes a
committee of senators could easi
ly serve as a liaison to the admin
istration.
Lai said the slate, if elected,
would propose a constitutional
amendment "eliminating the
COP from the ASSU Bylaws."
According to the ASSU consti

tution, a proposed amendment
must receive a two-thirds vote in
the ASSU Senate to be placed on a
general election ballot.
Once placed on the ballot in a
general student election, the
amendment again has to receive
at least two-thirds of the vote,
said senate Deputy Chair Neil
Crellin.

—Paul Kwon

Currently, the COP is "consti
tutionally required to exist,"
Crellin said.
Mun is an undergraduate sen
ator and a former president of
Burbank. Ilstrup is currently a
resident assistant in Burbank
and has been manager of the
men's gymnastics team for two
years.
Kwon is a resident assistant in
Toyon and has worked with the
Special Olympics for three years.
Lai is head advising associate in
Burbank and works with the
Stanford in Business Consulting

Group, which gives business
advice to recently-formed enter
prises in the Stanford area.
Lai stressed that the campaign
is not intended as a personal

affront to the current COP or
other COP candidates.
"It's an attack on the office,
not on the people who fill the
office," Kwon said.

Paul Kwon, Ted Lai, Blake llstrup and Ed Mun are serious about not
having a Council of Presidents next year. If their "I Prefer Not to
Have a COP" slate wins, they'll move to abolish the COP and put
their salaries toward student projects.
