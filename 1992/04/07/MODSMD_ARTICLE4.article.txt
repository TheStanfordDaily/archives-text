# YOU! promises presidency — a day at a time
## 
### Elise Wolfgram 
Imagine three joyful students
winning a lottery, jumping up
and down, then running to claim
their prizes — one-day member
ships in the ASSU Council of
Presidents.
This is the theory behind the
Hammer and Coffin party's "YOU!"
COP slate, which has adopted "ran
domocracy" as its slogan.
"Our slate isn't about the people
on the slate," YOU! member David
Hyatt said. "We're the martyrs of
the randomocracy revolution."
According to Hyatt, ASSU
Bylaws permit the substitution of
up to three students for members
of a COP slate, so members of
YOU! plan to step down and be
replaced by random members of
the student body at random
intervals of time.
The slate was created by
Hyatt, sophomore Tony Sirna,
junior Srinivas Kumar and senior
Chris McKenna.
Students will get their first taste
of randomocracy during election
week. At debates, random students
will respond to questions posed to
the YOU! slate. Hyatt said that
after all interested students places
their name in a hat, names will then
chosen to answer questions.
By doing this, Sirna said,
YOUi combines "all the great
ideas of all the great philosophies of all
the students."
Hyatt said these debates will encour
age discussion of issues so students can
"see if they want to vote for them
selves."
By including the entire student body,
randomocracy will also encourage stu
dent, participation and eliminate the
exclusiveness of the ASSU, Sirna said.
"Bush is asking for term limits;
we're doing it,"he said. "One day term
limits."
Hyatt said the YOU! slate also repre
sents diversity.
Since anyone can be a member of
their slate, YOU! is as diverse as the
student body.
"Today we're four undergraduate
males, but look at us at any given day in

office and we could be four postdoctoral
students who never set foot on cam
pus," Hyatt said.
He said he feels YOU! has as much of
a chance in the election as any other
slate.
"We're as electable as everyone," he
said. "We necessarily include the most
electable members of campus."
Hyatt would not list specific issues
the Hammer and Coffin party is inter
ested in, but said YOU! would address
all of the student body's concerns.
"There are a lot of good ideas out
there, and we incorporate all of them,"
Hyatt said. "Think of the most brilliant
idea and that's who [we] are."
Hyatt graduated after winter quar
ter with a degree in political science. He
is an undergraduate ASSU senator, was
editor of the Chaparral and coaches a
Little League team.
He said he plans to resign from the
slate today and be replaced by a random

undergraduate.
Sirna is an undeclared sophomore.
He works for the Chaparral, plays on
the Ultimate Frisbee team, is Synergy's
financial manager and is "a former Syn
ergy spice manager," he said.
Kumar, a junior majoring in eco
nomics, will be the one member to
remain on the slate, since he is at Stan
ford in Berlin. While on campus, he per
forms and manages Mindslam, a band.
McKenna is a senior majoring in
communication.
Hyatt called randomocracy the
"wave of the future" for student gov
ernment.
He added that the slate's inclusive
nature allows it to combine the best
ideas of the other COP slates as well as
other students, and this makes them
the obvious top candidate.
"May the best candidates win,
which, of course, includes us," Hyatt
said.
