# Presidential race comes to Stanford
## Lucky 600 will quiz candidates in Dinkelspiel 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
All of the presidential candidates have
been invited to campus Friday night for a
live ABC News Nightline broadcast from
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The show will begin at 8:30 p.m. and fol
low a "town meeting" format, allowing an
audience including at least 300 students,
faculty and staff to question the panelists.
Ted Koppel, a Stanford alumnus, will
anchor the show, titled "The Process Run
Amok: A Look at the Presidential Cam
paign," said Nightline spokeswoman
Laura Wessner.
Richard Harris, who produces the
show's live interviews, said no appear
ances have been confirmed yet.
But television commentator Pat
Buchanan, former Calif. Gov. Jerry
Brown, former Ark. Gov. Bill Clinton, bil
lionaire businessman H. R. Perot and
both President George Bush and Vice
President Dan Quayle have been contact
ed, he added.
If some candidates are interested in
participating but cannot be at Stanford
on Friday night, they may be interviewed
via satellite, Wessner said.
Clinton is tentatively scheduled to be
in Virginia this weekend. But according
to Chuck Burt, an assistant scheduler for
the campaign, his plans are not definite.
Brown is scheduled to be in California
this weekend, said Fred Ketteman, the
campus coordinator for the campaign.
However, he added that Brown's local staff
does not know anything about Nightline's
invitation.
The Bush, Buchanan and Perot cam
paigns could not be reached for comment.
The list of candidates actually appear
ing will probably not be available until
Thursday, Wessner said, since many can
didates may wait until after the New
York, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Kansas
primaries today.
The show will "look at people's frus
trations with elected officials in Washing
ton," said Wessner, and the key question
is " 'Why isn't Washington working?' "
No specific length has been set for the

session. "Town meetings in the past have
been 60 minutes, 90 minutes and two
hours," said Wessner, adding that one
has even been longer than four hours.
Vice President for Public Affairs Bob
Freelen said Koppel contacted him Friday
about using the campus.
"Nightline wanted to come to the West
Coast, and asked if Stanford University was
interested in hosting them," Freelen said.
According to Wessner, "The audience is
excellent and the time difference is good for
us. It will be seen live on the East Coast."
Stanford Police Chief Marv Herring
ton said arrangements have not yet been
made for security during the show. It will
probably have to be coordinated with the
Secret Service, he added.
Wessner said the arrangements have yet
to be considered, but that Nightline would
probably work with the local police force.
The lack of information is hindering
efforts to plan security, Herrington said.
"At this point, I'm waiting as everyone
else is waiting."
