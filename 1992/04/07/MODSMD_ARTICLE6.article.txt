# Wilson goes to bat for SLAC 'B factory'

Gov. Pete Wilson is lobbying
Congress for the Stanford Lin
ear Accelerator Center's pro
posed $150 million "B factory''
facility, which would be used for
research on the properties of
matter and anti-matter.
SLAC's "future viability ...
depends on its being able to
progress to the next stage of sci
entific inquiry," Wilson wrote in
a recent letter to Rep. George

Brown, D-Riverside, chair of the
House Committee on Science,
Space and Technology.
He called for "a united and
determined effort by the Califor

ty" in next year's federal budget.
Michael Riordan, assistant to
SLAC Director Burton Richter,
said this is "a very difficult time"
to be lobbying for funds. So
SLAC is proposing that the
Department of Energy "keep our
current ($l4O million annual)

budget adjusted for inflation,
and in five years we will build
you a B factory."
SLAC feels it can save enough
from its current budget to con
struct the B factory by "slowing
down the experimental pro
gram," Riordan said.
The risk SLAC runs by making
such a proposal is that the depart
ment might ask them to make the
cuts anyway, without building the
new machine, he added.
The primary reason for con
structing the B Factory is to try to

learn "what happened at the begin
ning of the universe," Riordan said.
"In all the models of how the
universe began, we start out
[with] equal amounts of matter
and anti-matter," he said.
To understand the transition
to today's universe, where matter
dominates, "We are building [the
B Factory] to find out why there
is a difference between matter
and anti-matter," Riordan said.
"That's not to say there won't
