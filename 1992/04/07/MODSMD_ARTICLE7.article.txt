# What's in a name?
## Finding identity, avoiding labels difficult for Mexican-Americans 
### Victor Haseman Staff writer 
Latino, Chicano, Mexican,
Mexicano and Mexican-American
—these terms are merely a sam
pling of names regularly used by a
collection of cultures the U.S.
government has labeled Hispanic.
But the term is perceived as intel
lectual-clumsy by many in Stan
ford's Chicano/Latino community.
Cecilia Burciaga, associate
dean of student resources, said
the term "completely denies our
indigenous roots. We are a prod
uct of both Spain and Indian and
the term 'Hispanic' has not a clue
of the Indian part of us."
"I use the word 'Chicano,' "
she said, "because for me it means
political awareness, it means
political identity."
Luis Fraga, an associate pro

fessor of political science, also
refers to himself as a Chicano. "It
has a political component to it in
terms of acknowledging my citi
zenship in the United States and
my different social background,"
he explained.
A term that dates back to the
turn of the century, "Chicano"—
once used by Mexicans in refer
ence to Mexican emigrant work
ing-class people — has evolved to
denote a political movement of the
late '60s and early '70s, according
to History Prof. Albert Camarillo.
However, the term has carried
negative connotations as well. For
some Mexican-Americans, "Chi
cano" is synonymous with mojados
— meaning "wet backs"— and cho
los, or "low lifes, low riders." Its
current political use is often tar

History Prof. Al Camarillo and senior Robert Almanzan say it's
important to keep their vocabulary flexible when they're describing
their ethnicity. Deciding which name to use is "generational, it's
region and locality driven," Camarillo said.
nished by these associations.
So senior Robert Almanzan, an
El Centro Chicano staff member,
finds it necessary to explain his
identification with "Chicano" to
those in his native El Paso, Texas
who bear hostility toward it.
Nonetheless, he said, he uses the
term Chicano and the more region
ally acceptable Mexican-American
"interchangeably, depending on
who I'm with."
Almanzan's example illus
trates a point made by Camarillo.

"There are several things you
have to consider in terms of look
ing at how people will identify
themselves and what terms they
will use," he said. "It's genera
tional, it's region and locality
driven, and it's the audience they
are addressing."
Citing the historical hetero
geneity of populations of both
Mexican and Hispanic origin, he
said he does not think a term that
agreeable to all can be found.
Cordelia Candelaria, a visiting
associate professor of English, also
commented on the "stupid" and
"incorrect" nature of a blanket
term. Referring to the importance

'I don't want to have labels alienate us from each
other.'
—Cordelia Candelaria

of "self-naming" for people of color
and disempowered people — who
are traditionally misnamed —
Candelaria said she recognizes the
importance of precision.
However, she said, "I don't want
to have labels alienate us from each
other." So she, like Camarillo, said
she understands the importance of
being able to use several terms.
Sophomore Delia Lopez, an El
Centro Chicano staffer who con

siders herself both a Chicana —
the female form of Chicano — and
a Mexican-American, commented
on the importance of ethnic identi
ty, but added that it should not be
allowed to divide the Chicano/Lati
no community on campus.
"We need to work together
because there are a lot of prob
lems we have besides the way we
name each other," she explained.
Sophomore Jorge Solis, a

MEChA co-chair, said he under
stands that not all Mexican-Amer
icans and Latinos feel comfortable
with the term "Chicano."
"People who are of Latino
decent have grown more diverse,"
he said. "Some don't associate
themselves with Chicano because
they feel that it may be a label
that only applies to people of Mex
ican descent."
He explained that the use of
Chicano/Latino is an attempt to
be as inclusive as possible. How
ever, both terms possess, in the
words of Fraga, "a political com
ponent" — something not every
one appreciates.

"Other people would rather be
called Hispanic, just because they
wouldn't want to take a political
standpoint," Solis said.
Candelaria emphasized a con
tinuing need for precise ethnic
naming in the Chicano/Latino
community, as well as in the
many other ethnic and cultural
communities on campus.
Perhaps senior Rolando Zele
don, president and co-founder of
the Latino Student Association,
has the key: "My approach to a lot
of these things is informing and
teaching people.... A name's a
name and it should go beyond
[that]. It should be the people."
