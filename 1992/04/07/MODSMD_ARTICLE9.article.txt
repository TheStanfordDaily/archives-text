Author Isaac Asimov dies at 72
NEW YORK (AP) — Isaac Asimov, the prolific writer of science
fact and fiction who laid down the literary laws of how robots must
behave, died early yesterday morning, his brother said. He was 72.
Stanley Asimov said his brother died at 2:20 a.m. at New York
University Hospital of heart and kidney failure.
Earlier this year, Asimov announced that a prostate operation
had slowed him down and he was cutting back on his writing.
Among his nearly 500 books, three early novels known as the
"Foundation" trilogy were honored in 1966 with a special Hugo
Award as the best science-fiction series ever.
