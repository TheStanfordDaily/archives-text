ASSU FEE REFUND
Spring '92
Hey, students, time is marching-on! If you
haven't requested your fee refund, you have
'till Friday, April 17 to do so! The idea is to do it
at least once per academic year. Now, if you've
already gotten your fee refund for the Autumn
*91 and/or Winter '92 quarter, you don't need to
do anything! You (along with those who will
make their request by the deadline) will be
mailed your Sprg '92 Fee Refund during the Bth
or 9th week of the quarter. Also, for those of
you who have already made a request, it's your
opportunity to change it by, again, the April 17
deadline. So, the only place to take care of all
of this, is the ASSU Business Office â€” 205
Tresidder Union. We're open Monday thru
Friday from 9:00 a.m. 'till 12:30 p.m. and
1:30 p.m. 'till 4:45 p.m.
