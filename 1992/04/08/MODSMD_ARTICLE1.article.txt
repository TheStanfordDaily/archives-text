# Plans firming up for ABC broadcast
## Brown, Buchanan say they'll join 'Nightline' via satellite on Friday 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Former California Gov. Jerry Brown and tele
vision commentator Pat Buchanan have accept
ed invitations to appear live via satellite on Fri
day's ABC News Nightline broadcast from Stan
ford. Vice President Dan Quayle is also likely to
participate through remote hook-up.
The show in Dinkelspiel Auditorium will feature
an as-yet-undetermined panel of presidential candi
dates answering audience members' questions.
Ted Koppel will anchor the show from Stan
ford, but many of the candidates probably will
not appear in person.
"My sense at this point is that every one (of the
candidates) will be remote due to the pressures of
the primaiy schedules," said Bob Freelen, vice
president for public affairs.
Nightline is "setting up big video screens so
the audience would still have the chance to
interact" with the candidates participating via
satellite, said Smita Fingh, a member of Night
line's production staff. The audience will have
an "electronic discussion" with those candi
dates, she said.
A panel of experts selected by Nightline — which
could include some Stanford faculty — may sit on

the stage behind the candidates,
according to Richard Harris, the
show's producer of live interviews.
The experts will be available to
answer questions for Koppel during
the show, he said.
President Bush, Quayle,
Buchanan, Brown, Arkansas Gov.
Bill Clinton and Texas business
man Ross Perot are the only can
didates who have been invited to
be on the panel so far, according
to Fingh.
Harris said two candidates
have agreed to appear on the
show, but he declined to identify
them. However, representatives
of the Buchanan and Brown cam
paigns confirmed yesterday that
their candidates planned to par
ticipate.
The show is not on Bush's ten
tative schedule, according to a
member of his press office.
But Ethel Sapington, a repre
sentative in the office, said it is
likely that Quayle will participate
in the program.

"The vice president is going to
be in South Carolina, but they are
trying to see if he could be there
by satellite," Sapington said. "He
hasn't made his final decision
yet."
Workers in Clinton and Perot's
campaign headquarters said they
did not know whether their candi
dates would be on the panel.
Democratic race drop-out Paul
Tsongas will be invited if he
decides to get back into the race,
according to Fingh.
Koppel, who will likely arrive
Friday, graduated from Stanford
in 1962.
His personal assistant, Muriel
Fleischer, said he "tries to do his
best for the school because he
feels so strongly about it," but
added that she didn't know if
KopjJfcl'B relationship with Stan
ford had any influence on the
show's location.
Three hundred tickets to the
live broadcast will be distributed
to Stanford students, faculty and
staff chosen through a lottery,
and another 300 will be given to
prominent people in the Bay
Area specifically invited by
Nightline.

Freelen said the tickets provid
ed by Nightline are likely to go to
members of the Board of
Trustees, University administra
tors and prominent faculty mem
bers, as well as local politicians
and members of social organiza
tions.
There will be a rehearsal for
the show on Thursday, Harris
said.
During the rehearsal, stu
dent tour guides will be "role
playing the candidates and the
people in the audience asking
questions.
"It's to make sure we get the
camera and lighting angles right,"
he said.
