# Plans firming up for ABC broadcast
## Brown, Buchanan say they'll join 'Nightline' via satellite on Friday 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Former California Gov. Jerry Brown and tele
vision commentator Pat Buchanan have accept
ed invitations to appear live via satellite on Fri
day's ABC News Nightline broadcast from Stan
ford. Vice President Dan Quayle is also likely to
participate through remote hook-up.
The show in Dinkelspiel Auditorium will feature
an as-yet-undetermined panel of presidential candi
dates answering audience members' questions.
Ted Koppel will anchor the show from Stan
ford, but many of the candidates probably will
not appear in person.
"My sense at this point is that every one (of the
candidates) will be remote due to the pressures of
the primaiy schedules," said Bob Freelen, vice
president for public affairs.
Nightline is "setting up big video screens so
the audience would still have the chance to
interact" with the candidates participating via
satellite, said Smita Fingh, a member of Night
line's production staff. The audience will have
an "electronic discussion" with those candi
dates, she said.
A panel of experts selected by Nightline — which
could include some Stanford faculty — may sit on
