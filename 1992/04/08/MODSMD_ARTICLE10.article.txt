Prof named to national board
President Bush has named Stanford professor Condoleezza
Rice to the National Council on Humanities, the Chronicle of
Higher Education reported this week.
Rice, an assistant professor of political science at the Center
for International Security and Arms Control, was one of eight
scholars named to the 27-member council. The council is the advi
sory board to the National Endowment to the Humanities
With the terms of nine council members already expired, the
council will be one member short even if all eight nominees are
confirmed by the Senate.
Rice served in the Bush administration from 1990 to 1991 as a
specialist on the Soviet Union at the National Security Council.
New home for Haas Center
Groundbreaking for a new Haas Center for Public Service is
scheduled for May 8, and construction is expected to take eight
months with a grand opening sometime in late fall quarter.
The 14,000-square foot, three-story building will be located
next to the Institute for Research on Women and Gender.
The building will provide much-needed space for the Haas Cen
ter's student-run service programs. In addition to being cramped,
Owen House, the center's current location, lacks wheelchair acces
sibility and a conference room.
The new building will include office space, several conference
rooms, a lounge and a courtyard.
Funding for the $3.2 million wood structure was provided by
the Haas family, by Tom Ford, chair of the Haas Center advisory
board and by the sale of interior steps and courtyard bricks that
can be engraved with wording of the donor's choice.
The center, founded in 1984, is still about $400,000 short of its
fund-raising goal.
Chicano culture focus of summer workshop
English Prof. Ramon Saldivar will lead a residential workshop
on literary studies and Chicano and Mexican themes this summer.
The workshop, titled "Chicano Cultural Studies: Questions of
Identity," will run from July 12 through July 17. Funded by the
Lilly Endowment of Indianapolis through a grant to Stanford's
Program for Faculty Renewal.
