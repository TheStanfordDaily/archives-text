# Officials seek source of water violations
## Unknown person has been dumping toxic chemicals down the drain 
### Chris Eisenberg Staff writer 
Likening the process to "looking for a nee
dle in a haystack," Stanford environmental
officials are struggling to identify a repeat
offender violating a strict Palo Alto waste
water regulation.
According to environmental compliance
officer Laura Bonk, the University has until
Aug. 1 to reduce its waste water concentra
tions of two chemicals or face fines totaling
$6,000 per day.
The two compounds in question — chloro
form and methylene chloride, or
dichloromethane — can be found in almost
any toxic liquids, including common house
hold items such as shoe polish, furniture pol
ish, nail polish remover and paint stripper,
Bonk said.
The chemicals' presence was first detected
in November as part of Stanford's monthly
waste water monitoring program.
Data collected during the months of
November and December indicated at least
two days when chemical levels exceeded Stan
ford's legal limit at one of five campus "sam
pling points."
Each sampling point includes several cam
pus buildings. According to Bonk, the building
or buildings most likely responsible for the
current infractions are Keck, Mudd, Stauffer
chemistry labs, Research Animal Facility I
and 11, Fairchild or Beck man.
"Those are the obvious ones," she said.
Stanford's legal limit for each chemical is
.75 parts per million, but recent tests have
found up to 10 times that amount.
That limit, however, does not mean even
small amounts of substances can be dumped.
"I have repeatedly told people, 'You are not
allowed to dump anything down the drain,' "

Bonk said.
The University is allowed the .75 parts per
million leeway because of the difficulty
involved in keeping even a tiny amount of a
chemical from entering the University's waste
water system. According to Bonk, the best
example is when a researcher washes glass
ware that had contained prohibited chemicals.
While this is acceptable, "what we can't
allow is dumping," she said.

'It's like looking for a needle in
a haystack.'

Based on sampling data for November and
December, the city of Palo Alto gave Stanford
until Aug. 1 to locate and correct the problem
or face the stiff fines.
Data collected for the month of January
indicated the problem had not yet been solved.
In 21 days of testing, results showed at least
six days in which levels of methylene chloride
far exceeded the legal limit.
Although the city's standard response is to
require the offender to correct the problem
immediately, the University was given a
longer period of time.
"Essentially, they gave us six months,"
Bonk said. "That's because of the size of our
facility. They know I cannot quickly and easi
ly — within 30 days — figure out where this
is coming from, who's doing it and stop it."
Locating the responsible party is not an
easy task. Because each sampling site includes
numerous buildings, Bonk said it is difficult to
identify the researcher or researchers respon

sible.
"It's like looking for a needle in a
haystack," she said.
Based on the levels detected, Bonk esti
mates that one to ten gallons of liquid are
being dumped down the drain at one time.
Although it is conceivable that one
researcher may be responsible, Bonk said, it is
more likely that there are "two dozen people
each dumping down an ounce."
"It could be one person who is just not
aware [or] it could be a research group with
inconsistent or lazy practices," she said.
Stanford's waste water monitoring pro
gram began in September as part of a new
Wastewater Discharge Permit received from
the city of Palo Alto. The new permit both low
ered the allowable levels of pollutants and
required Stanford to test for a myriad of
chemicals at five points around campus.
Palo Alto had previously tested Stanford's
waste water as the water left campus. Because
of the massive volumes of water involved,
however, so-called "end of the pipe" testing
was much less likely to detect the levels of pol
lutants allowed by the new regulations.
According to Bonk, the city's requirement
that Stanford sample at five locations is
"extremely reasonable and even minimal
given Stanford's size. They could turn around
and ask us to sample at 100 locations."
As required by the city, Bonk submitted a
corrective action plan to the city of Palo Alto
April 1. As part of her nine-step plan to solve
the problem, Bonk plans to move progressive
ly upstream from the sampling point in an
effort to isolate the building responsible.
All chemical wastes must be disposed
through Stanford's chemical waste disposal
program. The program, whose annual costs
exceed $1.5 million is provided to users free of
charge, Bonk said.
