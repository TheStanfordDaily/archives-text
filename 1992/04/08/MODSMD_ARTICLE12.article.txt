# Few sign up for 900,976 phone service
## 
### Elise Wolfgram 
Only 12 students have enrolled in a new
program allowing them to find out what hap
pened on their favorite soap opera — or just
the time of day.
Student Communication Services had hoped
to attract 100 people for the pilot program that
will let students access 900 and 976 numbers
through the University phone system.
Currently, Stanford students cannot make
the calls with their PAC code. But "several
students had asked us to have the service
available," said Anne Crowley, manager of
client services networking.
In response to the student requests, Com
munication Services set up the pilot program,
which began last week.

Numbers beginning with the 900 area code
and the 976 prefix connect callers to compa
nies that offer entertainment and information
services for a charge.
Students who sign up for the pilot program
are immediately issued a new PAC code, which
allows them to telephone the special numbers.
In addition to the costs of the calls them
selves, students will be charged 25 cents per
call by the University. Before beginning the
program, participants must sign a waiver
accepting responsibility for all calls.
The 25 cent charge "recovers part of the
effort it takes to provide the services," Crow
ley said, adding that billing complications for
900 and 976 numbers require additional effort
by the University.
The calls are very expensive, ranging from

50 cents to $50, and take two to three months
to be billed, Crowley said. Under the new sys
tem, Pacific Bell bills Stanford for the calls
and Communication Services in turn bills the
appropriate student.
The delay in Pacific Bell's billing of Stanford
makes it difficult to charge students, especially
toward the end of the year when they may be
graduating or leaving for summer vacation.
This complication prompted Communica
tion Services to block students with PAC num
bers from calling the 900 and 976 numbers,
and also led them to find an acceptable way to
grant student access without incurring losses.
Crowley said she had hoped for a better
response, but that students have other priori
ties at the beginning of a quarter and may not
not have expressed an interest yet.
