Clinton thumps Brown in New York
WASHINGTON (AP) — Front-runner Bill Clinton thumped
Jerry Brown in the brutal New York primary Tuesday and added
a Kansas landslide for good measure, tightening his grip on the
Democratic presidential nomination despite persistent voter
unease over his character.
Clinton led in Minnesota and Wisconsin as well, and padded
his considerable delegate lead. Campaign dropout Paul Tsongas
outpolled Brown and finished a surprising second in New York,
then deferred a decision on whether to reenter the race.
In a victory speech in New York, Clinton depicted himself as an
apostle of change and said the night's results marked a "turning
point" for America. He took aim at President Bush and reached
out to the supporters of Tsongas and Brown, saying, "We want to
be their campaign, too."
Brown said he would press ahead with his candidate, but Clin
ton's showing prompted party insiders to suggest Clinton had the
race well in hand.
"He is going to get the nomination, absent some unfathomable
collapse," said veteran Democratic strategist Tom Donilon.
In New York, with 99 percent of the precincts counted, Clinton had
41 percent of the vote, Tsongas 29 percent and Brown 26 percent.
In Kansas, Clinton had 51 percent of the vote, with Tsongas,
Brown and an uncommitted line on the ballot bunched far behind.
Interviews with voters in several states reflected continuing
concern about Clinton's integrity. He has been besieged with con
troversy throughout his campaign over alleged womanizing, the
use of marijuana, his record in office and his draft record during
the Vietnam war.
Jet carrying Arafat disappears
TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) — A jet carrying PLO chief Yasser Arafat
disappeared in a sandstorm Tuesday night while trying to make an
emergency landing in the Libyan desert, PLO officials reported.
"We're trying to find him now," Bassam Abu-Sharif, Arafat's
chief adviser, said Wednesday from Tunis, Tunisia. When he
spoke, the Soviet-made, Algerian-registered Antonov transport
plane was more than nine hours overdue in its flight from Sudan.
Abu-Sharif, sounding distraught but holding out hope the
plane made an emergency landing in the desert, appealed to
France, Italy, Britain, the United States and Egypt "to help with
all possible means to locate the aircraft."
Other sources reached at the Tunis office of the Palestine Lib
eration Organization chairman said 12 people were aboard. They
included three crew members and a team of bodyguards and
administrative assistants.
The 62-year-old Arafat has been the undisputed leader of the
PLO's Fatah faction, its largest, for 23 years. It wasn't clear who
among his many aides and allies would succeed him if he were
dead.
