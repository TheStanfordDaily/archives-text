## Give us real grades 
### 
Constructive criticism,
feedback a neglected
part of grading process

OOD' CAN BE THE most
I .—.unwelcome four-letter
word at this university.
Particularly when scrawled in
red ink atop an essay, accompanied
only by a few checkmarks in the
margin and a "B."
These cursory "comments" can
hardly be considered substantive
additions to the learning process.
Yet they comprise an embarrass
ingly large portion of the Stanford
undergraduate education.
Lectures alone do not make an
education, and instructors should
be required to provide regular
feedback — beyond letter grades
— on students' work.
A handful of schools, such as UC-
Santa Cruz, have eliminated grades
altogether, instituting instead a sys
tem of written evaluations.
And while this policy errs in its
departure from reality — nearly all
graduate programs and employers
rely heavily on grades to judge
ability — the principles behind the
switch could be applied here.
Incoming president Gerhard
Casper has emphasized the impor
tance of teaching and has promised
to take a hard look at the quality of
Stanford's undergraduate educa
tion, making changes and improve
ments where necessary.
A thorough examination of
Stanford's grading policies is a
good place to start. The products of
students' time and effort warrant
more than just checkmarks, and
formal requirements for written
evaluations — along with grades —
should be institutionalized.
In math and science classes, this
feedback can take the form of com
ments on problem sets explaining
where the student went wrong,
and small sections and tutoring
sections aimed at helping students
understand the thought processes

they should be using.
In the humanities and social sci
ences, these efforts should be
aimed at critiquing — not just
grading — student papers, assign
ments and exams.
Students in humanities and
social sciences cannot expect to
excel by merely listing things they
know. They are rightfully expected
to write clear, persuasive arguments
that display both their knowledge
and their ability to express it.
The expectations for instruc
tors' performances should be
equally high. A few sentences of
constructive comments and criti
cism — at the least — should be
required on every paper and exam.
Otherwise, a Stanford education
proves meaningless.
In addition to raised expecta
tions of feedback throughout the
quarter, the University should
consider requiring instructors to
write a cumulative evaluation —
albeit brief — for each student at
the end of a quarter. Letter grades
provide little in the way of educa
tion, and even a few sentences of
evaluation would prove beneficial
to students.
Some programs and individual
professors have already instituted
exemplary policies of providing
personalized assistance and feed
back. However, these programs
remain the exception, not the rule.
For instance, many programs at
this university can take a cue from
Structured Liberal Education
(SLE), a year-long writing and
feedback-intensive course offered
to some freshmen, which provides
students with extensive academic
resources and tutoring programs.
Though there are drawbacks to
the program, the amount of effort
put in by professors and TAs provides
both an example of what an under
graduate education could be, and a
dismal reminder of what it isn't.
Every Stanford student has the
potential to succeed at this univer
sity. When a student fails, the edu
cational system has failed as well.
Anyone who tells you differently
has been tenured too long.
