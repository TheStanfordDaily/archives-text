Investigate evidence supporting the existence of God

For many at Stanford, the
word "faith" conjures up images of
religion as an emotional crutch or
intellectual suicide. Oxford defines faith
as a reliance or trust in a person or
thing, loyalty, sincerity or belief in a reli
gious doctrine, but I would contend that
faith is much more than that.
There are many people who have
faith, but it is not the amount of faith
that is important, but the object that you
place it in. If that object is not trustwor
thy, then your faith is worth nothing.
You can have all the faith in the world
that a quarter-inch thick sheet of ice on a
pond will hold your weight, but if you
step onto it, you will fall through not
because you lacked faith, but because the
object you placed your faith in was not
reliable.
The same is true with spiritual

beliefs. I believe in the existence of a per
sonal God who wants to have a relation
ship with us. I believe that we cannot
work our way to God because we in our
imperfection fall short. I believe that
God is both loving and just, and thus
Jesus Christ was sent to pay for our
wrongdoing. I believe that we are given a
choice whether to accept this gift of
grace or not.
But don't take my word for it — take
a fair look at the evidence that is out
there. Here's a sampling.
The reliability of the Bible is a critical
issue since the Bible is the authority
upon which the Christian world view is
built. If we simply look at the Bible as a
piece of literature, it passes the tests that
historians use to determine accuracy.
The quantity of New Testament
manuscripts is unparalleled in ancient

literature — 14,000, compared with
existing manuscript copies of Greek and
Latin authors such as Plato, Aristotle
and Caesar, which range from one to 20.
The time span for most of the New Tes
tament is less than 200 years from date
of authorship to date of earliest
manuscripts, as compared with the
average gap of more than 1,000 years of
other ancient authors.
Most of the New Testament was writ
ten between A.D. 47 and 70, and all of it
was complete before the end of the first
century. External sources, including
archaeological discoveries, all point to
the historicity of the Bible. Since its reli
ability cannot be questioned, we are
forced to wrestle with its claims.
An argument presented by C.S.
Lewis, professor and former agnostic, is
particularly interesting. He contends

that Jesus' claims to be the Son of God
leave us only three choices — he was a
liar, lunatic or really was who he claimed
to be.
And finally, the fact that we all long
for immortality or something more in
this life is not unreasonable since the
Bible tells us that God has placed eterni
ty in the hearts of men. I would call this
a God-shaped vacuum that we have in
our lives that cannot be filled by any
thing else. Augustine described it in this
way: "Thou hast made us for thyself, O
Lord, and our hearts are restless until
they find their rest in Thee."
This is only the tip of the iceberg con
cerning evidence that is out there that
deserves to be examined.
