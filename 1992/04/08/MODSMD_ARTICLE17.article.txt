# Column unfairly puts entire blame on Israel
## 
### 
The April 3 column headed "Coopera
tion leads to peace," about the Palestini
an-Israeli conflict, did not, unfortunate
ly, really deal with the mutual responsi
bility suggested by that heading.
Instead, blame and burden are laid upon
Israel alone.
A historical amnesia, by now so com
mon in the media as to pass unques
tioned, shows up at the outset: "Israel
continues to fear for its security, seeing
itself as a minute land surrounded by
hostile neighbors." But only seeing
itself? Israel stands amid the Arab
League's 21 unrelentingly hostile coun
tries that command 600 times her area
and 50 times her population.
When the United Nations declared
Partition in 1947, the Arabs refused to
accept it, and when Israel declared its
own statehood, five Arab countries
attacked. Again in 1967 and 1973, they

tried to eliminate Israel.
The suffering of Palestinians today is
evident and painful. But their cause has
been ill-served by the rejectionism of
Palestinian leaders — avidly abetted by
Arab nations whose strongest interest
has been to maintain a lever against
Israel.
Israel is challenged to "scrap intransi
gent tendencies in favor of a lasting
agreement." One can indeed deplore the
current Israeli government's intransi
gence. But the irony here is that the
world has failed for so long to direct that
challenge toward the Arab states and
people.
