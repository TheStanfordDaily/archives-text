# 'Lynch-mob' mentality obscures facts of leak
## 
### 
The last thing we need when a safety
incident occurs on campus is the lynch
mob mentality exhibited by Barbara
Bridges' March 7 letter to The Daily.

First, let's get the facts right â€” the
release was accidental. It was caused
by a faulty gas regulator in the experi
mental set-up and the researcher was
not aware of the situation. The release
was terminated as soon as it was dis
covered.
And I assure you that the people
involved are truly sorry for the inconve
nience and problems that they caused.
Now, let me address the hazard issue.
One way of defining a hazard is to ask
the question, is this situation immedi
ately dangerous to the life or health of
the people exposed?
Based on the amount of methyl mer
captan released and the dilution factor
present in the McCullough exaust system,
the level of mercaptan at the top of the
exaust stack was far below what the
National Institution of Occupational Safe
ty and Health sets as the dangerous level.
As to the effects experienced by
Bridges, people react differently to sub
toxic levels of chemicals. And indeed, I
do not doubt that Bridges did experience
the discomfort she describes and all of

us involved in this incident apologize to
her and to anyone else who was affected
adversely by this release.
Finally, let me reiterate again that
the methyl mercaptan release from
McCullough on April 2 was an accident
and that at no time were levels of mer
captan outside of the exaust system haz
ardous in the toxic sense.
