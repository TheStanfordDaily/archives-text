# Dinkelspiel Auditorium transformed for event
## 
### John Ford Staff writer 
Dinkelspiel Auditorium is putting on its best
face for Friday night's ABC News Nightline
broadcast.
FM Productions, which has provided lighting
for events such as the 1984 Olympics' opening
and closing ceremonies, arrived at the auditori
um yesterday to set up lights for the live pro
duction focusing on the presidential candidates.
Lighting director Vince Whitt said about 150
lighting units, or "stage fixtures," will be tem
porarily installed.
A small bleacher section will be located in the
back of the stage area to provide an "in-the round"
atmosphere, said Bruce Krempetz, production
manager for University Events and Services.
Richard Harris, Nightline's live interview
producer, said those seats will be reserved for
political experts invited by the show, and Krem
petz said Ted Koppel will be seated toward the
front of the stage.
There will be one large video screen and "sev-
eral small monitors and video
walls" throughout the auditori
um, Krempetz said. He added
that there are several plans for
staging depending on the number
of candidates who attend.
FM Productions will also be
clearing space and making plat
forms for eight ABC cameras,
according to Whitt. There will be
two cameras on the sides of the
auditorium and one hanging from
a crane over the stage area, he
said.
Seats will be removed from two
areas of the auditorium to make
space for two centrally located
cameras, according to Whitt.
Whitt said he had 10 people on
the job yesterday, with 10 more

providing help today.
The crew will be working "into
the night" to get Dinkelspiel
ready, Krempetz said.
Whitt said he is trying to
change the auditorium as little
as possible for the show. "If you
tune in on Friday night, you'll
see some of the same things you
see everyday at Dinkelspiel," he
said, adding that he would be
using some of the large back
drops regularly used in the audi
torium.
For lighting purposes, howev
er, the crew is painting the audi
torium's yellow walls burgundy.
The walls will not be repainted
until June so Dinkelspiel won't
smell like paint, according to
Mark Dalrymple, stage manager
for the Music Department.
Dalrymple said a number of
events had to be moved out of the
auditorium to allow for the prepa

rations, including one Thursday
morning class, a Chamber
Orchestra rehearsal and a Sym
phony Orchestra rehearsal.
"I'm basically trying to stay
out of the way," Dalrymple said.
"They know what they want to
do."
Krempetz said he hoped the
auditorium would be ready for
normal use by 8 a.m. Saturday.
In other arrangements being
made today, Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington said he is
attempting to set up a security
system for the show, but added
that security needs would change
as he found out which candidates
would actually be on campus.
Even if no candidates actually
come to Stanford, security will be
necessary because of all of the
equipment and people, "but it will
be much more low key," said Her
rington.
