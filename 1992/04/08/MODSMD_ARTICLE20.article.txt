## Pointing the finger at gays 
### 
I WAS IN MY TOLERANCE stage or
the"I don't give a damn if someone is
gay, just as long as they don't bother
me" stage. I was well trained in my toler
ance. I stopped telling my gay jokes. Fags,
flamers and dykes became homosexuals
and people of differing sexual orientation
and, of course, I had my gay friend.
Yet, while I was highly adroit at maintain
ing an air of acceptance, I couldn't betray my
feelings. I was disgusted by gays. The
thought of two men kissing each other was
about as appealing as a frontal lobotomy.
Allow me to be more direct, escaping
the euphemisms of my past - I hated
gays. The disgust and latent hostility I
felt toward gays were sucategories of
hatred, plain and simple.
While hate is a four-letter word I
never would have admitted to, the senti
ment clandestinely pervaded my every
interaction with homosexuals. I sheep
ishly shook hands with gays or complete
ly shied away from physical contact. I still
remember how my brow would often
unconsciously furrow when I was with
gays as thoughts would flash in my mind,
"What sinners I am amongst" or "How
unnatural these people are."
It takes too much energy to hate.
Daniel Bao showed me that. He was our
gay counselor at The Bridge when I was a
freshman. A beautiful man whose elo
quent and poignant truths began to move
me past tolerance.

I still remember our first real conver
sation about homosexuality. I had no
intention of listening to him; I only
sought to argue and debate. Daniel, how
ever, quickly disarmed me with his per
sonal testimony.
Oh, if only I could recount to you the
entire conversation. He told me of people
who religiously prayed to God to help
them become straight. He told me of the
years of denial and the pain of always
feeling different.
And he told me of the violence — vio
lence from strangers and family, horrible
images of beatings, destruction of proper
ty and the daily verbal condemnations.
It was chilling to find that so much of
the testimony he shared with me was
almost identical to stories my grandpar
ents told me about growing up Black.
People found it revolting to share a meal
with them and often felt it to be their
duty to beat them so that they would
learn proper living.
Well, it didn't take me long to realize
that the root of my hatred did not lie with
gays but with myself. It was my problem.
A problem I dealt with by ceasing to tol
erate gays and instead seeking to
embrace them.
In these efforts I have found another
community with which I feel akin and
from which I draw strength. The gay peo
ple with whom I am close are some of the
strongest, most passionate and caring

people I know and their demands for jus
tice are no less imperative than those of
any other community.
I sometimes pray for the patience that
Daniel so artfully maintained with me
when I fired questions and condemna
tions at him — because, in recent years, I
have grown increasingly angry at the
hypocrisy that surrounds me.
In my columns I have never sought to
preach self-righteous psycho-babble —
but the temptation here is almost over
whelming. I have seen too many of my
male friends — no matter whether
they're on the football field or inside a
church — bash gays and then revel in
their machismo or piety.
But again, I will never point a finger
when the finger is best pointed at me.
Alas, occasionally I still find myself act
ing defensive if someone thinks I am gay
or sometimes I remain silent when others
slam and slander. These realizations hurt
me deeply. I must continue to struggle
for personal justice. This is my most
important endeavor.

Cory thanks the 77 courageous people
who responded to his friending experi
ment.


'The root of
my hatred
did not lie
with gays but
with myself.'
