## Batters get by St. Mary's 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Maybe it wasn't the prettiest win of all time, but
they'll take it. Yesterday, the Stanford Cardinal
beat the St. Mary's Gaels 3-2 in a game in which all
the Card's runs were unearned. Stanford came into
the game having lost six of their last seven and def
initely needed a confidence booster. While the win
meant nothing in terms of rankings or conference
standings, it surely meant plenty for the players'
confidence.
"It's always great to get a win," Brian Sackinsky
said, "but it was pretty important for us to get a win
today."
Sackinsky started for the Cardinal, allowing only
four hits in five innings of shut-out ball.
"I thought I'd go out there and go right after
them," Sackinsky said. "I just wanted to give them
my best, and it went pretty well."
Meanwhile, Stanford showed that they are up to
their old run-manufacturing tricks. After David
Holbrook lead-off the bottom of the fifth with a long
double and then advanced to third on a sacrifice,
Jeffrey Hammonds walked and showed why he's so
valuable even when he's not hitting. On about the
seventh pick-off throw to first, the ball thrown by
the St. Mary's pitcher got by the first baseman,
allowing Holbrook to score the game's first run.
However, Tim Moore came out to pitch the sixth,
and erased the lead. After walking the lead-off bat

ter, Moore allowed a home run to left, putting the
Gaels ahead 2-1. But in the bottom of the seventh,
Stanford came back.
Chris Kemper began the inning by popping up in
shallow foul territory behind third, and angrily
threw his bat, only to happily retrieve it when the
third baseman dropped the ball. Kemper responded
to the second chance by stroking a single to center.
John Lynch followed with an RBI double.
Tied 2-2 going into the bottom of the ninth, Stan
ford needed a run. Mark Skeels led off the inning by
drawing a walk. With one out, John Lynch swung at
and missed strike three, but the St. Mary's catcher
couldn't hold onto the ball, and Lynch was safe at
first with the rare strikeout-passed-ball-sacrifice.
After Holbrook was intentionally walked, coach
Mark Marquess opted for a pinch hitter. But who
could he find on the bench who would deliver in the
clutch situation? How about Stanford's best hitter?
David Cornell had been rested for the game to
nurse a sore ankle. Perhaps St. Mary's didn't ade
quately scout Stanford, or perhaps Cornell was
thought to have been more seriously injured. But
for whatever reason, St. Mary's did not pull the
infield in with the bases loaded, one out, and the
game on the line. Cornell aptly responded.
The senior hit the second offering on the ground
-- a tailor made double-play ball right to the second
baseman. But the drawn back infield allowed the
bad-ankled but speedy Cornell to reach first safely
while Skeels scored the third and winning run.
