# Late-bloomer Cornell keeps delivering
## 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
David Cornell received his first
piece of fan mail on Monday, a
request for an autographed pic
ture from a little boy in San Jose.
The letter represents a perfect

example of the left fielder's rise to
his position as the Cardinal's
most valuable player. The last
season and a half has seen him
blossom from a late-inning defen
sive replacement into a major
league prospect.
Having just returned from a

night class, Anthropological Per
spectives on American Culture,
he seemed eager to talk after get
ting a bowl of Raisin Bran for a
snack. At a mere six foot and one
hundred eighty pounds and
dressed neatly in a button-down
shirt, his appearance belies the

fact that he has knocked the cover
off the ball all year.
His room is immaculate and
modestly decorated. On one wall
hangs a framed picture of Joe
Dimaggio, Mickey Mantle and
Ted Williams, a shrine which
reflects his appreciation for the
nostalgic and historic elements of
the game.
Cornell started playing Little
League baseball at age six and,
although he played straight
through high school, he received
no recruiting offers from Division
I schools. He went to Santa Clara
University and made the team as
a walk-on, playing for two years
before transferring to Stanford.
"I had no bad feelings, but I
had always really wanted to come
to Stanford," Cornell explained.
"I didn't get in the first time so I
re-applied."
The decision to leave his place
on the Santa Clara team with no
assurance of playing for the Car
dinal reflects a combination of
heart, intensity and "crazy luck"
that have characterized Cornell's
career.
Cornell made the team because
of his speed and his defense, then
entered the starting lineup for
good in the middle of last season.

Senior Dave Cornell is swinging a big bat for the Cardinal after transferring here two years ago.
This season, Cornell has either
batted lead-off or in the number
two spot and has hit .366 on the
year.
Cornell gives the most credit to
his parents and his girlfriend as
sources of support and inspira
tion. His mom and dad, Carl and
Jean Henkels, try to come to
every game, including road trips.
His girlfriend lives in New York,
but she supports him in another

way.
"Sometimes when I'm 0-for-2,
I think of what I'm going to tell
Catherine on the phone that
night, and I like to have some
thing good to say."
Cornell has had something
good to say every night, because
he has reached base in all 31
games this season. He has also
hit two home runs this season,
the first two of his collegiate
career.
The mention of this brings a
big grin to his face. "Those were
out of nowhere," he claimed, "I
have no idea where they came

from. I can't even hit one in bat
ting practice."
Because he is from Palo Alto,
Cornell's dream is to play for the
Giants. "If not for them, I'd like
to play for the Yankees or Red
Sox. They're American teams and
that's baseball to me."
As for his team, Cornell likes
the Cardinal's chances for post
season play. Although they
dropped three straight to Califor
nia last weekend, he doesn't have
any worries.
"Over a sixty game season, you
have to be superhuman not to
stumble. When the hitting and

pitching comes together, it's very
tough to beat us. We're a young
team and we're pretty excited.
Our goal has got to be to play
every game like it was important,
to win every inning."
For now, Cornell is simply
enjoying his final season and the
balanced life he has at Stanford.
He lives in a dorm because it
enables him to enjoy his time as a
student.
"I like to dissociate myself
from baseball off the field, and
here I can really be a student. I
might go crazy if I didn't have
that balance."

Because he is from Palo Alto,
Cornell's dream is to play for the
Giants. "If not for them, I'd like
to play for the Yankees or Red
Sox. They're American teams and
that's baseball to me."
As for his team, Cornell likes
the Cardinal's chances for post
season play. Although they
dropped three straight to Califor
nia last weekend, he doesn't have
any worries.
"Over a sixty game season, you
have to be superhuman not to
stumble. When the hitting and

pitching comes together, it's very
tough to beat us. We're a young
team and we're pretty excited.
Our goal has got to be to play
every game like it was important,
to win every inning."
For now, Cornell is simply
enjoying his final season and the
balanced life he has at Stanford.
He lives in a dorm because it
enables him to enjoy his time as a
student.
"I like to dissociate myself
from baseball off the field, and
here I can really be a student. I
might go crazy if I didn't have
that balance."
