# Late-bloomer Cornell keeps delivering
## 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
David Cornell received his first
piece of fan mail on Monday, a
request for an autographed pic
ture from a little boy in San Jose.
The letter represents a perfect

example of the left fielder's rise to
his position as the Cardinal's
most valuable player. The last
season and a half has seen him
blossom from a late-inning defen
sive replacement into a major
league prospect.
Having just returned from a

night class, Anthropological Per
spectives on American Culture,
he seemed eager to talk after get
ting a bowl of Raisin Bran for a
snack. At a mere six foot and one
hundred eighty pounds and
dressed neatly in a button-down
shirt, his appearance belies the

fact that he has knocked the cover
off the ball all year.
His room is immaculate and
modestly decorated. On one wall
hangs a framed picture of Joe
Dimaggio, Mickey Mantle and
Ted Williams, a shrine which
reflects his appreciation for the
nostalgic and historic elements of
the game.
Cornell started playing Little
League baseball at age six and,
although he played straight
through high school, he received
no recruiting offers from Division
I schools. He went to Santa Clara
University and made the team as
a walk-on, playing for two years
before transferring to Stanford.
"I had no bad feelings, but I
had always really wanted to come
to Stanford," Cornell explained.
"I didn't get in the first time so I
re-applied."
The decision to leave his place
on the Santa Clara team with no
assurance of playing for the Car
dinal reflects a combination of
heart, intensity and "crazy luck"
that have characterized Cornell's
career.
Cornell made the team because
of his speed and his defense, then
entered the starting lineup for
good in the middle of last season.
