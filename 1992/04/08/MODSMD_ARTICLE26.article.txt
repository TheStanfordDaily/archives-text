# Who's No. 1? Dream game will decide

Unimpressed by Duke's 71-51 manhan
dling of Michigan in the NCAA title
game, the Stanford women have issued
a national championship challenge to Mike
Krzyzewski and his Dookies.
"They can talk the talk, now let's see if they
can play ball," said Stanford point guard
Tracy Goodenbour, evil twin of Final Four
MVP Molly. "Bobby Hurley is a snot-nosed
New Jersey slimeball."
ABC Nightline announced that the two
championship teams will square off Friday at
10 p.m. in Maples, following the Presidential
debate. Vice President Dan Quayle will be an
honorary cheerleader and throw up the first
airball. Tickets can be acquired by calling
Jerry Brown's 1-800 hotline.
The Cardinal (30-3) topped Western Ken

tucky 78-62 to win their second national title
in three years, while Duke (34-2) won its sec
ond straight. Entranced by Goodenbour's
moves, gamblers have made Stanford an early
four-point favorite, although the Cardinal
may be exhausted by back-to-back trips to the

Bush and Arsenio shows.
An analysis of the key match-ups:
The coaches: It's Coach K against Coach V.
Coach Tara VanDerveer scored big points by
being Gatorade-drenched Bill Parcells-style
after the championship.
Still, prank mastermind Anita Kaplan
may earn a few laps for the wet-blouse effect.
Krzyzewski scored by whipping Bobby
Knight in the semifinal, but gets negative
votes for allowing the cast of Beverly Hills
90210 to play for his team and for having a
name with no vowels. VanDerveer would
crush Coach Kin a street fight. Advantage:
Stanford.
