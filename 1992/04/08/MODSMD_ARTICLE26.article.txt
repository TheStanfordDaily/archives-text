# Who's No. 1? Dream game will decide
## 
### 
Unimpressed by Duke's 71-51 manhan
dling of Michigan in the NCAA title
game, the Stanford women have issued
a national championship challenge to Mike
Krzyzewski and his Dookies.
"They can talk the talk, now let's see if they
can play ball," said Stanford point guard
Tracy Goodenbour, evil twin of Final Four
MVP Molly. "Bobby Hurley is a snot-nosed
New Jersey slimeball."
ABC Nightline announced that the two
championship teams will square off Friday at
10 p.m. in Maples, following the Presidential
debate. Vice President Dan Quayle will be an
honorary cheerleader and throw up the first
airball. Tickets can be acquired by calling
Jerry Brown's 1-800 hotline.
The Cardinal (30-3) topped Western Ken

tucky 78-62 to win their second national title
in three years, while Duke (34-2) won its sec
ond straight. Entranced by Goodenbour's
moves, gamblers have made Stanford an early
four-point favorite, although the Cardinal
may be exhausted by back-to-back trips to the

Bush and Arsenio shows.
An analysis of the key match-ups:
The coaches: It's Coach K against Coach V.
Coach Tara VanDerveer scored big points by
being Gatorade-drenched Bill Parcells-style
after the championship.
Still, prank mastermind Anita Kaplan
may earn a few laps for the wet-blouse effect.
Krzyzewski scored by whipping Bobby
Knight in the semifinal, but gets negative
votes for allowing the cast of Beverly Hills
90210 to play for his team and for having a
name with no vowels. VanDerveer would
crush Coach Kin a street fight. Advantage:
Stanford.
TV stars: Sideburned Duke center Christian


Nat
Cousins
Laettner fancies himself after
Luke of Beverly Hills 90210, but
he'll be chased to a cheaper area
code by Cardinal charmer Molly
Goodenbour. Goodenbour is a bet
ter outside shooter and has a
much better name for TV. Laet
tner's habit of stepping on peo
ple's heads could help him in Hol
lywood, but Goodenbour's story

of lowa innocence to California
cool will score better ratings.
The enforcers: Duke goliath
Cherokee Parks is seven feet tall,
but one Val Whiting head-crush
er move and he'll be crawling for
the locker room. Whiting immo
bilized a Virginia forward by sit
ting on her head, a move much
more effective than Laettner's
head-stomping. An All-Ameri
can, Whiting is impossible to
stop in the paint. On the other
hand, Parks bears a striking
resemblance to former Cardinal

great Derek Bruton. Advantage:
Stanford.
The schools: Duke is the USC of
the South. It is constructed like
Disneyland, with fake stones giv
ing it a neo-gothic look. Jesse
Helms is their Senator.
When I visited Duke in the fall,
I audited a sociology class that
Laettner and Hurley were taking.
The class had no homework and
one multiple choice final, but
there was a catch: you got two
guesses on each question.
Stanford's Chris MacMurdo

(human biology) is an Academic
All-American. She left South Car
olina to get away from Duke.
Advantage: Stanford.
Final analysis.'Stanford is just too
swift for the Dookies. Gooden
bour will finally silence Hurley,
Whiting will dunk over Laettner,
and the Cardinal will dance all
over Duke, 86-79. If only Duke
would play.

Nat Cousins is a pseudo-senior,
reminding you to have fun, and
no forfeits.
