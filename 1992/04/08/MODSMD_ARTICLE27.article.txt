### Brian Border 
Last Saturday while many Stanford stu
dents spent the first weekend of the spring
quarter relaxing on the shores of Lake
Lagunita, the women's sailing team partici
pated in the more energetic activity of the
U.C. Santa Cruz regatta.
Although the two boats from Stanford
sailed against tough opponents from Santa
Cruz and Berkeley, they performed
admirably throughout the contest.
One Cardinal team in particular sailed
except ionally well on their way to capturing
first place over the other six teams.
This boat consisted of skipper Haley
King and her crew Kathay Akers, and
according to sailing coach Blake Middleton
they not only demonstrated their superior
ity over the other opponents, but they also
handled the weather well.
"They clearly dominated the regatta,"
Middleton said. "The weather conditions
made the race even more challenging
because the wind was constantly changing
directions, and I was particularly pleased
with the way Haley handled all these condi
tions."
The other Stanford boat, which was skip
pered by Stacey Misakian and had an alter
nating crew of Michelle St. Martin and

4 After this weekend, she left
no doubt about who is the
top sailor in Northern Cali
fornia. '
— coach Middleton

Polly Brown, finished sixth. Though coach
Middleton was slightly discouraged by their
inconsistent performance, he was comfort
ed by the fact that only a few points sepa
rated them from the third place Santa Cruz
team.
While last weekend's regatta was not of
great importance for the Cardinal sailors, it
did serve as the final competition for Stan
ford before the women's national qualifiers
in late March.
Although Middleton stressed that the
Cardinal will need more depth if they are
to perform well on the national level, he
also appeared somewhat confident know
ing that Haley will lead Stanford's
charge.
"Afler this weekend, she left no doubt
about who is the top sailor in Northern Cal
ifornia."

alternating crewmembers Brown and Michelle St. Martin finished sixth with some inconsistent sailing, but they were
only a few points behind the third-place Santa Cruz team. Their teammates Haley King and Kathay Akers came in first
place, outsailing everyone despite the rough weather.
