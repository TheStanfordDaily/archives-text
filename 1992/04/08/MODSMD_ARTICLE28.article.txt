# Netters stomp on Fresno State, 8-1
## 
### Peter Marks Staff writer 
Despite being emotionally
and physically drained from a
grueling weekend of matches,
the Stanford men's tennis team
responded like true champions,
throttling visiting Fresno State
8-1.
Jason Yee was the first Stan
ford player to walk off the
court, rocking Andy Stewart 6-
2, 6-3. Fellow senior and No.l
seed, Alex O'Brien, took a little
bit longer.
O'Brien was coasting along
at 5-4 in the first set when he
ran into trouble against Greg
Andersen, a pesky opponent
with both a two-handed back
hand and forehand. O'Brien
faltered, losing his serve and
then the set 7-6.
However, the Stanford
senior fought back as the
match heated up in the second
set with several disputed line
calls. At one point, Andersen
asked O'Brien if he had seen a
ball hit out of play.
"No, I just called it out,"
O'Brien replied.
With an inclination for
yelling "vamos" and "yep" dur
ing play, Andersen was penal
ized a point for intentional
interference at another stage in
the match.
O'Brien, the No. 2 ranked
player in the country, evened
play at two sets apiece by win
ning 6-4 in the second. He then
took control in the third set 6-2.
"Greg Andersen is really
tough to beat," said Stanford
coach Dick Gould. "Alex served
very well. It was one of his best
serving matches."
No. 2 seed, Mike Flanagan,
also had his hands full. The
sophomore took the first set of
his match against Steve Jack
son 6-4, then "took a nap" in

the second, losing 6-1.
Flanagan's decision to con
serve his energy for the third
set after going down a break in
the second proved wise. Like
O'Brien, he took over the
tempo of the match and tri
umphed 6-2.
"I wasn't playing my best,
but I fought tough and won the
big points," Flanagan said.
No. 3 seed Vimal Patel had
no trouble with Nils Koita,
winning 6-4, 6-4. Chris Coco
tos was also successful at
fourth singles, beating Mike
Noel 6-3, 7-6. Rob Devens lost
the first set of his match, but
came back win the No 5 9
match against Peter Klinovsky
6-7, 6-2, 6-3.
After the singles matches,
Gould said he was pleased with
his team's performance after
their weekend series and disap
pointing loss to the University
of Southern California.
"Fresno State is a very
tough, scrappy team. We could
have let our minds wander,"
Gould said. "It was a nice
match to get going into Pac
10's again."
Yee agreed with his coach.
The captain said that the
match was a good test of the
team's concentration and heart
after such a tiring weekend.
"We need to be out here and
compete and not just go
through the motions," the
senior said.
In doubles play O'Brien and
Cocotos coasted to a 6-4, 6-4
win over Koitka and Stewart at
No. 1. At No. 2 Yee and Patel
were up 4-1 in the first set
against Andersen and Noel
when the Bulldogs had to
retire due to injury. In the
third doubles spot, Roman
Sydorack and Billy Wright
barely lost to Jackson and Kli
novsky, 6-2, 0-6, 5-7.
