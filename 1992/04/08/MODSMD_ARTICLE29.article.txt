# Spring football begins optimistically
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior Staff Writer 
The Bill Walsh era (part II) has begun, and
all is well. The annual rite of spring football is
now two days old and according to Stanford's
new head coach, things are going smoothly.
"We are right on schedule," Walsh said.
"We are not ahead of schedule, but we have
done what we have wanted and are doing just
fine."
As always, spring practice is a time of eval
uation. At a press conference last week Walsh
said one of his main concerns would be his
receiving corps. With Chris Walsh and Jon
Pinckney gone due to graduation, Stanford
lost about 90% of last year's receptions. Since
Walsh has promised to focus on a more pass
oriented offense, finding a target for quarter
back Steve Stenstrom has become crucial.
According to Walsh his search for a new set of
hands has been one of the spring's early sur
prises.
"The receivers are doing better than many
of my expectations," the Cardinal coach said.
"(Justin) Armour, (Mike) Cook and (Dave)
Calomese are the most impressive. I feel real
ly good about Armour."
Although one of the most highly touted

'In the past some guys
thought that the spring was a
nuisance, but now everybody
is excited to be back playing.'

prep passers in the nation last year, Armour
now wears No. 80, a very non-quarterback
number. It appears Walsh has the Colorado
native destined for the receiving end of the
football, and will leave the throwing to a quar
terback trio of Stenstrom, Mark Butterfield
and Chris Berg.
Already avoiding the kind of quarterback
controversy that has plagued recent Cardinal
squads, Walsh said that Stenstrom will "obvi
ously" be starting next year. After having seen
his quarterback in live action for only a few
days, Walsh is already quick with his praise.
"I like [Stenstrom] very much," Walsh
said. "He has poise, leadership potential and
he learns quicldy. He should be excellent."
The Cardinal will open the 1992 season
against Texas A&M in the Disneyland Pigskin

Classic August 26, but according to Walsh his
team has a long way to go. The new coach con
siders spring practice a time of learning and
growth, and so far he is impressed with what
he has seen.
"The players have been improving each day
with the execution, technique and skills that
they need, and really that is all we can ask of
them," Walsh said. "We have to be a well con
structed team to play Texas A&M, and with
hard work we will get there."
Though most of their classmates are using
these now warm afternoons to sunbathe or
lounge around Lake Lagunita, the players
appear happy to spend three hours racing
around a hot field in pads.
"It's great to be back," said wide receiver
Bryan Schultz. "I think all the excitement the
campus has felt (surrounding Bill Walsh's
return) has carried over to the football field.
In the past some guys thought that the spring
was a nuisance, but now everybody is excited
to be back playing."
Practice began last Saturday and will con
tinue on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Satur
day basis until their conclusion on April 29.
The annual Red/White scrimmage will take
place in Stanford Stadium April 25 and will be
open to the public.
