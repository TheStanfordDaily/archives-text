# Sparks fly over bill to pay for trip

In a unusual attack, Deputy
Senate Chair Neil Crellin accused
undergraduate senator Jason Sny
der of a "conflict of interest" at
last night's ASSU Senate meeting.
Crellin's statements come as
campus politicians begin a week
of campaigning for the spring
elections.
Crellin accused Snyder of
involvement with a bill to reim
burse 20 student participants in a
public service conference in
Orlando. Snyder attended the
conference, and Crellin said he
was trying to reimburse himself.
"Why are we paying to send
Jason Snyder to Disney World?"
Crellin asked.
Snyder denied any conflict of
interest and said Crellin's accusa
tions were motivated by election
politics. Snyder, who is running
for election to the Council of
Presidents with the "Indepen
dents: A New Era" slate, said
Crellin's accusations were "very
much a political move" and that
Crellin was trying to harm the
Independents slate.
Crellin ran for senate last year
with the Students First party,
which is running a COP slate
against Snyder's. Crellin is not a
slate member.
Beth Morgan, a current COP
member who belongs to Students
First, said Crellin's statements
did not "reflect the feelings of
the Students First party as a
whole."
The debate surrounded a pro
posal, authored by undergraduate
senator Russell Calleros, to
release $950 in funding for the
airfare costs of students who
attended the Campus Outreach
Opportunity League Conference
held in Florida last month.
The conference was a national
meeting of college students to dis
cuss issues in public service. The
bill — which needed a two-thirds
majority — eventually failed 11-9.
Crellin said that Snyder
appeared as a co-author of the
bill when it was presented to the
Budget and Finance Committee
as a preliminary step to its con
sideration before the whole sen
ate.
Snyder, however, denied
authorship of the bill and said he
was offended by Crellin's accusa
tions. According to Senate Chair

Kevin Warsh, Snyder had asked
before the meeting to be excused
from the vote on the bill, saying he
had a conflict of interest.
Several senators said it is not a
conflict of interest for Snyder to
receive money from the senate, since
Snyder was not voting on the issue.
"Just because senator Snyder
is a member of the senate, that
does not mean he is not a stu
dent," said senate associate
Anoop Prakash. Since Snyder is a
student, he said, there is no rea
son he should be ineligible for
funding.
Calleros said Snyder did not
write any part of the bill and had
phoned Calleros asking that his
name not appear on it. Calleros
said he misunderstood Snyder
and placed his name on the bill.
"I wrote the entire bill. I give
you my word," Calleros said.
Other senators questioned the
substance, not the authorship, of
the bill. COP member John
Overdeck said the ASSU should
not give money to send students
to conferences because it set a
poor financial precedent.
"I would love it if we had
enough money to give everyone
$50 every time they went to a valu
able conference," but the ASSU
cannot afford that, Overdeck said.
Ron Brown, who is running for
COP with Snyder, amended the
bill at Crellin's suggestion to
remove one-twentieth of the fund
ing "for one participant — that
was senator Snyder." But the bill
still failed last night.
