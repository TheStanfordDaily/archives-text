At the 19th annual San
Diego Crew Classic last week
end, the Stanford men faced
the nation's top-ranked crews
during two days of intense com
petition. The Crew Classic,
which hosts over 2,000 rowers
in Mission Bay, is the first
major race of the season for col
lege crews.
The Crew Classic has no pre
season rankings and it is the
first chance for crews around
the nation to establish them
selves and determine the speed
of the competition.
Stanford's varsity eight had
an impressive row in their qual
ifying heat, coming from
behind to beat out Boston Uni
versity and Florida Institute of
Technology to make the Grand
Final of the Copley Cup for the
first time in five years. In the
afternoon final, however, the
Cardinal allowed the rough

conditions to get the better of
it, as the team rowed poorly
and finished sixth.
"We traditionally start the
season slowly and peak toward
the end, so it's exciting to make
the final at the first regatta,"
senior Steve Voorhis said. "I'm
very optimistic about our
prospects."
Despite a disappointing per
formance, the freshman eight
finished fourth; well within
striking distance of the lead
ers.
Their placing left them
hopeful that expected improve
ment will lead to future victo
ries. In the JV event, Stanford
rowed well in the heat, finish
ing third and qualifying for
the final. The final, however,
was dominated by traditional
rowing powers Washington,
Orange Coast and Harvard.
Saturday the Cardinal hosts
Sacramento State at Redwood
Shores.
