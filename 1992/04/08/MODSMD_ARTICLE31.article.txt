## Biotech industry explodes with new drugs and crops Non-rotting tomato, cow growth hormone, pest-resistant corn among recent genetic engineering feats 
### Liz Lempert Editorial staff 
Last week's announcement by researchers at the
Medical Center that they had induced muscle pro
tein production in muscular dystrophy patients by
injecting them with healthy cells represents more
than a step along the way in the cure for the muscle
debilitating disease.
The early signs that gene therapy could be suc
cessful in combating muscular dystrophy puts
another feather in the increasingly plumed cap of
biotechnology, a rapidly growing industry that turns
out products ranging from insulin for diabetics to
factor VIII for the treatment of hemophilia, all by
manipulating strands of DNA.
Medical biotechnology began to take off in the
early 1980s, when companies such as South San
Francisco-based Genentech mastered recombinant-
DNA technology, the process in which large quanti
ties of valuable natural proteins, such as insulin, are
produced by cellular factories.
DNA consists of strings of genes that hold the
recipes for different proteins. After isolating and
identifying the gene responsible for making a certain
protein, scientists can insert the gene into the DNA
of another cell that can be made to reproduce

rapidly, and a colony of cells containing the
genes can be grown. The colony can then

produce the protein in large amounts.
Recombinant-DNA technology was
the first fundamentally new drug-mak
ing approach to come out in decades,

and biotechnology has since emerged as
the driving force in medical
technology.

Previous
ly, the

search for new

drugs involved
screening thousands of

chemicals in a lengthy trial-and-error approach to
find one that would cure a disease. This costly, time
consuming process often created drugs with unde
sirable side effects.
With biotechnology, companies can develop new
drugs that will target traditional diseases more pre
cisely than conventional drugs do.
The expectations for biotechnology products run
high. Genetic engineering, it is hoped, will produce
the treatments and cures for inherited disorders
such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's, as well as
for currently incurable acquired diseases such as
AIDS.
"It's the computer industry of the 905," said
Mark Schena, a postdoctoral student in the bio
chemistry department who conducts basic research
in the field. "It will probably succeed the computer
industry within the near future."

The biotechnology industry received a big
boost earlier this year when President Bush

announced that confusing and restrictive
regulations on biotech prod-

ucts would be
streamlined.

"This $4 bil

lion by the end of the

decade — if we let it. The Unit
ed States leads the world in
L' 1 1 I T * i. 1

biotechnology and I intend to

keep it that way," he said.
Bush's new policy focused

attention on the agricultural side of
genetic engineering, and the loosening

of regulations have paved the way for the first set of
biotech agricultural products to hit the market later
this year.
Among these new products are a rot-resistant
tomato and a bovine growth hormone that stimu
lates milk production in cows.

The tomato was created by scientists who identi
fied and altered the gene that manufactures the rot
ting protein. Farmers growing the new non-rotting
tomatoes can let them ripen on the vine, instead of
picking them green and artificially ripening them.
Vine-ripened tomatoes contain less water than
those picked green, which leads to a tastier fruit, as
well as better ketchup.

Although genetically engineered medical prod
ucts have enjoyed growing success on the market,

agricultural products have
taken longer to develop.

For one, it is more
difficult to alter

whole plants and
animals than it is

to
. 1_ _

make
cells churn

out a single protein to use
in a drug. Also, researchers

have to wait for natural
growing seasons in plants or

for gestation cycles in animals to
see if their experiments work.

In addition, agricultural biotechnology has
encountered opposition from groups such as the
Environmental Defense Fund. Critics have worried
about the dangers of introducing novel organisms
into the environment, arguing that some might run
riot if unrestrained by natural enemies.
"There's been a lot of bad press for the agricul
tural biotech business, spurred by some fanatic indi
viduals," Schena said.
"Killer tomatoes taking over the world doesn't
have much fact," he said, adding that the irrational
fears have "stifled a lot of experimentation."
The new policy announced by Bush states that
organisms that are only slightly different from the
parent organisms — a category that includes the
vast majority of products proposed so far — need not
be regulated more than that of the parent organ
isms.

The policy states that
biotechnology is not

inherently dangerous
and that new products
should be judged for

what
they are, not by the
techniques used to

develop them.
Regulation of

agricultural biotechnol
ogy has been divided

among three federal
agencies: the Animal and

Plant Health Inspection
Service section of the U.S.

Department of Agriculture regulates
the field trials of genetically altered plants; animal
drugs and food products consumed by humans are
regulated by the Food and Drug Administration;
and the Environmental Protection Agency has
jurisdiction over microbes used as pesticides or in
pollution control.
In the past, a single agricultural biotech product
could fall under the jurisdiction of more than one
federal agency, leading to the costly duplication of
certain tests and general confusion.
Bush encouraged regulators to move more expe
ditiously, and told them that their actions are impor
tant for the economic health and competitiveness of
this country's biotech industry.
Peter Jensen, the executive director of the Cali
fornia Industrial Biotechnology Association,
described the effect of Bush's streamlining plan as
"knowing which hoops you have to jump through."
Bush said he planned to increase federal support
for basic biotech research by 7 percent, to $4.03 bil
lion annually.
Other agricultural biotech products expected to
receive approval in the next few years include insect
herbicide-resistant corn and cotton. The plants
house bacteria that produce a natural pesticide.
Advocates argue that these biopesticides will be
safer and less polluting than current chemical pesti
cides.

such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's, as well as
for currently incurable acquired diseases such as
AIDS.
"It's the computer industry of the 905," said
Mark Schena, a postdoctoral student in the bio
chemistry department who conducts basic research
in the field. "It will probably succeed the computer
industry within the near future."

The biotechnology industry received a big
boost earlier this year when President Bush

announced that confusing and restrictive
regulations on biotech prod-

ucts would be
streamlined.

Bush's new policy focused

attention on the agricultural side of
genetic engineering, and the loosening

of regulations have paved the way for the first set of
biotech agricultural products to hit the market later
this year.
Among these new products are a rot-resistant
tomato and a bovine growth hormone that stimu
lates milk production in cows.

The tomato was created by scientists who identi
fied and altered the gene that manufactures the rot
ting protein. Farmers growing the new non-rotting
tomatoes can let them ripen on the vine, instead of
picking them green and artificially ripening them.
Vine-ripened tomatoes contain less water than
those picked green, which leads to a tastier fruit, as
well as better ketchup.

Although genetically engineered medical prod
ucts have enjoyed growing success on the market,

agricultural products have
taken longer to develop.

For one, it is more
difficult to alter

animals than it is

to

make
cells churn

out a single protein to use
in a drug. Also, researchers

have to wait for natural
growing seasons in plants or

for gestation cycles in animals to
see if their experiments work.

In addition, agricultural biotechnology has
encountered opposition from groups such as the
Environmental Defense Fund. Critics have worried
about the dangers of introducing novel organisms
into the environment, arguing that some might run
riot if unrestrained by natural enemies.
"There's been a lot of bad press for the agricul
tural biotech business, spurred by some fanatic indi
viduals," Schena said.
"Killer tomatoes taking over the world doesn't
have much fact," he said, adding that the irrational
fears have "stifled a lot of experimentation."
The new policy announced by Bush states that
organisms that are only slightly different from the
parent organisms — a category that includes the
vast majority of products proposed so far — need not
be regulated more than that of the parent organ
isms.

The policy states that
biotechnology is not

inherently dangerous
and that new products
should be judged for

what
they are, not by the

Regulation of

agricultural biotechnol
ogy has been divided

among three federal
agencies: the Animal and

Plant Health Inspection
Service section of the U.S.

Department of Agriculture regulates
the field trials of genetically altered plants; animal
drugs and food products consumed by humans are
regulated by the Food and Drug Administration;
and the Environmental Protection Agency has
jurisdiction over microbes used as pesticides or in
pollution control.
In the past, a single agricultural biotech product
could fall under the jurisdiction of more than one
federal agency, leading to the costly duplication of
certain tests and general confusion.
Bush encouraged regulators to move more expe
ditiously, and told them that their actions are impor
tant for the economic health and competitiveness of
this country's biotech industry.
Peter Jensen, the executive director of the Cali
fornia Industrial Biotechnology Association,
described the effect of Bush's streamlining plan as
"knowing which hoops you have to jump through."
Bush said he planned to increase federal support
for basic biotech research by 7 percent, to $4.03 bil
lion annually.
Other agricultural biotech products expected to
receive approval in the next few years include insect
herbicide-resistant corn and cotton. The plants
house bacteria that produce a natural pesticide.
Advocates argue that these biopesticides will be
safer and less polluting than current chemical pesti
cides.

Last week's announcement by researchers at the
Medical Center that they had induced muscle pro
tein production in muscular dystrophy patients by
injecting them with healthy cells represents more
than a step along the way in the cure for the muscle
debilitating disease.
The early signs that gene therapy could be suc
cessful in combating muscular dystrophy puts
another feather in the increasingly plumed cap of
biotechnology, a rapidly growing industry that turns
out products ranging from insulin for diabetics to
factor VIII for the treatment of hemophilia, all by
manipulating strands of DNA.
Medical biotechnology began to take off in the
early 1980s, when companies such as South San
Francisco-based Genentech mastered recombinant-
DNA technology, the process in which large quanti
ties of valuable natural proteins, such as insulin, are
produced by cellular factories.
DNA consists of strings of genes that hold the
recipes for different proteins. After isolating and
identifying the gene responsible for making a certain
protein, scientists can insert the gene into the DNA
of another cell that can be made to reproduce

rapidly, and a colony of cells containing the
genes can be grown. The colony can then

produce the protein in large amounts.
Recombinant-DNA technology was
the first fundamentally new drug-mak
ing approach to come out in decades,

and biotechnology has since emerged as
the driving force in medical
technology.

Previous
ly, the

search for new

drugs involved
screening thousands of

chemicals in a lengthy trial-and-error approach to
find one that would cure a disease. This costly, time
consuming process often created drugs with unde
sirable side effects.
With biotechnology, companies can develop new
drugs that will target traditional diseases more pre
cisely than conventional drugs do.
The expectations for biotechnology products run
high. Genetic engineering, it is hoped, will produce
the treatments and cures for inherited disorders
such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's, as well as
for currently incurable acquired diseases such as
AIDS.
