# Bug inquires into boogers
## Nasal mucus serves to protect delicate nose 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
Q* What is the composition of snot,
• and why does the body produce
it?
— A cold sufferer
A* In addition to serving as a dietary
* supplement for some of the less
civilized folk among us — as well
as being the likely source of those weird
stains on the overstuffed chairs at Green
Library — "snot," as it's known in the
preschool vernacular, serves the body in a
largely protective capacity.
(Just so no one gets confused, let me
tell you right now that for the remainder
of this column I will be referring to nasal
mucus by its grown-up name.)
Nasal mucus prevents mechanical
injury to the delicate membranes which
line the nose, such as might occur when
you blow your nose, pick it (confess!), or
insert one of those strange objects — like
pencils, beans or pretty bugs — that little
kids seem to like putting in their noses
and ears so much. The mucus simply pro
vides a lubricant coating that protects
these membranes from such potential
sources of abrasion.
The nasal mucus is secreted by special
ized "goblet cells," which are so named
because their overall shape — wide at the
secretory surface that faces the nostril
cavity, narrow at the basal surface that
touches the underlying connective tissue
— roughly resembles that of a wine glass.
If you are healthy, your nasal epithelia
are producing mucus at low levels just
about all the time. Mucosal secretion can
be accelerated by irritation of the nasal
passages. Small particles, like ash, fine
sand, or sawdust, are especially good at
provoking mucosal eruptions.
Upper respiratory infections and aller
gies also increase mucus production,
resulting in the clogged airways and post
nasal drip so familiar to allergy victims
(excuse me — "allergy survivors") and
cold sufferers like yourself.
I'm not really sure why this happens;
every medical tome's description of the
common cold just seems to take this
annoying response for granted — the
"characteristic pathology" of the disease.
Clearly, the irritation caused by blowing
one's nose (to clear excess mucus) could
induce mucus production, but why the
overproduction happens in the first place,
I don't know. I invite any readers "in the
know" to drop me a line.
Mucus itself is composed mostly of the
appropriately named mucopolysaccharides,
long chains of slightly modified simple sug
ars. (For all you Chem 131 buffs out there,
every other monomer or so has had one
hydroxyl, -OH, replaced by an amine, -NH2.)
The special structure of mucopolysaccha
rides makes them retain water, and thus

swell slightly, in a moist environment like
the one found in your nostrils.
By trapping water, the mucopolysac
charides found in the nasal cavity prevent
dehydration of the mucus membranes.
Absorption of water also gives the
mucopolysaccharides their characteristic
glistening, slimy appearance. (OK, every
one, take a look.)
Along with the mucopolysaccharides,
nasal mucus (and, for that matter, all
kinds of mucus, such as the kinds found in
the lungs or gut) contains various proteins.
Many of these proteins merely add to the
familiar viscosity of mucosal secretions,
but others perform enzymatic functions.
Notice that mucus, as secreted by the
goblet cells, does not contain anything
inherently dangerous — just polysaccha
rides and proteins, along with water and
some basic salts. Assuming you could get
around the bland flavor, it would be per
fectly safe to eat. If you would like, try
some now.
Ha! Fooled you. There is a reason behind
our culture's taboo against eating boogers
— other than the obvious aesthetic one —
but it doesn't have anything to do with the
inherent composition of mucus as such.
Mucus serves to trap microscopic parti
cles that would otherwise end up in the
lungs. When air is pulled through the nose
during inhalation, it passes through the
turbinate bones, structures that impart a
swirling motion to incoming air. Specks of
dust, bacteria, small insects and the like
smack into the walls of the airways and
get trapped in the mucus.
Yum, yum.

induce mucus production, but why the
overproduction happens in the first place,
I don't know. I invite any readers "in the
know" to drop me a line.
Mucus itself is composed mostly of the
appropriately named mucopolysaccharides,
long chains of slightly modified simple sug
ars. (For all you Chem 131 buffs out there,
every other monomer or so has had one
hydroxyl, -OH, replaced by an amine, -NH2.)
The special structure of mucopolysaccha
rides makes them retain water, and thus

swell slightly, in a moist environment like
the one found in your nostrils.
By trapping water, the mucopolysac
charides found in the nasal cavity prevent
dehydration of the mucus membranes.
Absorption of water also gives the
mucopolysaccharides their characteristic
glistening, slimy appearance. (OK, every
one, take a look.)
Along with the mucopolysaccharides,
nasal mucus (and, for that matter, all
kinds of mucus, such as the kinds found in
the lungs or gut) contains various proteins.
Many of these proteins merely add to the
familiar viscosity of mucosal secretions,
but others perform enzymatic functions.
Notice that mucus, as secreted by the
goblet cells, does not contain anything
inherently dangerous — just polysaccha
rides and proteins, along with water and
some basic salts. Assuming you could get
around the bland flavor, it would be per
fectly safe to eat. If you would like, try
some now.
Ha! Fooled you. There is a reason behind
our culture's taboo against eating boogers
— other than the obvious aesthetic one —
but it doesn't have anything to do with the
inherent composition of mucus as such.
Mucus serves to trap microscopic parti
cles that would otherwise end up in the
lungs. When air is pulled through the nose
during inhalation, it passes through the
turbinate bones, structures that impart a
swirling motion to incoming air. Specks of
dust, bacteria, small insects and the like
smack into the walls of the airways and
get trapped in the mucus.
Yum, yum.
