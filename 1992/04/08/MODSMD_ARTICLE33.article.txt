# Pine trees may hold cure to cancer
## Stanford researchers hope to synthesize cancer-fighting taxol 
### Lydia Lee Staff writer 
Stanford researchers are gradually making progress in the
synthesis of taxol, a cancer-fighting agent. Currently, minute
amounts of the drug are obtained from the bark of a rare tree,
but Stanford researchers hope that by branching out to a
chemical found in the more common pine tree, they can syn
thesize taxol and make it available in greater quantities.
The rare Pacific yew tree, which grows in the forests of the
Pacific Northwest, is currently the only source of taxol. The
drug is obtained through the laborious and expensive process
of extracting it from the bark of the tree. The bark consists of
only 0.01 to 0.03 percent taxol.
Since the drug's discovery in the '60s during a National
Cancer Institute study of more than 35,000 plant species,
research groups all over the country have been working to
produce taxol, a structurally complex molecule, in their labo
ratories.
In a presentation to the American Chemistry Society's
symposium on taxol scheduled to take place today, Chemistry
Prof. Paul Wender will describe the current state of his lab's
research on the synthesis of taxol.
Taxol, a 20-carbon molecule, includes a smaller molecule
called baccatin, which contains a three-ring core.
Wender and his team are attempting to produce taxol by
first assembling its three-ring core, then producing baccatin,
and finally attaching it to a side chain. Wender will announce
that his lab has been able to create most of the molecule's
three-ring core. They plan to complete the core by the end of
this year.
If the team is able to synthesize baccatin, the last step will
be comparatively easy. Attaching the side chain to natural
baccatin has been accomplished already by other
researchers.
To build the core, the lab is utilizing the molecule pinene,
produced by the pine tree. Widely available for a sliver of
taxol's cost, pinene is similar to taxol in that it has atoms in
the same configuration. It also has 10 of the 20 carbon atoms
which make up taxol, leaving only ten to be added.
Michael Natchus, a postdoctoral member of the group,
drew an analogy between the complexities of synthesis and
that of building a house. The sum of the components does not
necessarily equal the whole, according to Natchus.

"Say you're a builder and you order a bunch of pre-fabs.
Well, if you have a bad plan, the house will fall down," he
said.
Taxol affects cancer cells by binding to their microtubules
and inhibiting their rapid division. A 1988 Johns Hopkins
study of taxol's effects on subjects with advanced ovarian can
cer showed that women who had not responded to standard
treatment showed a 30 percent rate of improvement.
In another study, close to half of breast cancer patients
treated with taxol showed tumor shrinkage. Once an
increased supply of taxol is available, scientists hope to test its
results on other types of cancer.
Although the basic mechanisms of taxol's effect on cancer
is known, precisely which parts of taxol are essential for fight
ing cancer remain to be discovered. Further research in this
area may allow for the future synthesis of simpler cancer
fighting compounds.
