Herpes threatens women, infants
One out of every 20 pregnant women enrolled in a Med
ical Center study had an unsuspected risk of contracting
herpes simplex virus type 2, the most common cause of
genital herpes, from husbands who harbored the virus
but never had symptoms of the infection.
Pediatrics Prof. Charles G. Prober and his research
team found that two-thirds of women infected with HSV
-2 had no history of genital herpes symptoms and did not
know they were infected.
The researchers said their findings are a strong incen
tive for developing a better test for detecting HSV-2 and
also for wider screening of pregnant women and their sex
ual partners.
The research results appear in the current issue of the
New England Journal of Medicine and was funded in part
by a grant from the National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development.
Neonatal herpes, one of the most threatening infec
tions in newborns, affects approximately 1,500 to 2,200

babies each year in the United States. Untreated, 70 per
cent of such infants die, and most of those who survive
have severe neurological damage.
With treatment using drugs, mortality is significantly
reduced, but for certain forms remains as high as 50 percent.
Half of neonatal HSV-2 infections result from the
mother's primary infections when the woman becomes
infected for the first time during pregnancy.
The other half is caused by reactivation of earlier HSV
-2 infection. Reactivation during pregnancy is much more
common than primary infection but women are much less
likely to pass the virus on to their infants during reacti
vation.
The study was based on statistics collected of 277
women throughout their pregnancies and 190 of their
husbands.
A blood test that detects evidence of HSV-2 with near
complete accuracy spotted prior infections in 32 percent
of the women and 25 percent of the men. Fifty-one of the
couples were discordant, with only one member showing
evidence of prior infection.
