# Deficits to persist, new budget shows
## 
### Howard Libit Steve McCarroll Senior staff writers 
The University will continue
to operate with significant
deficits as it puts its $43-million
reduction package into place over
the next two years, partly due to
the expense of complying with
federal indirect-cost regulations.
The 1992-93 operating budget,
likely to be approved by the Board
of Trustees Monday, reveals the
magnitude of the University
shortfall for the next two years
but fails in many instances to
specify how the deficit will be
dealt with.
In addition, the budget plan
narrowly fails to achieve its goal
of reducing the budget shortfall
by $43 million, identifying only
$42 million in cuts and revenue
enhancements.
The operating budget also calls
for another unspecified increase
in tuition for 1993-94, which
would be greater than inflation
plus 1 percent.
Although the hike would likely
be less than this year's 9.5 percent,
tuition for 1993-94 will not be set
until the meeting of the trustees in
early 1993.
Next year's projected deficit
totals $38 million, including a
"budget-base" shortfall of $24.3
million and one-time costs of
$13.6 million.
The budget-base deficit, which
refers to the University's year-to
year fiscal balance, will remain
largely because only half the $43-
million reduction proposal will
have been implemented by next
year. Most of its remaining ele
ments will be put into place for
the following academic year.
The one-time expenses are pri
marily the costs of complying
with new federal indirect-cost reg
ulations and include the costs of
consultants, lawyers and upgrad
ed accounting systems.
Also included in one-time costs
is the new staff early-retirement
plan, which is only available for a
limited time. The total expenses
remain uncertain because it is
unclear how many staff will opt

for the plan.
The operating budget does not
specify how the additional two
year deficit will be handled. The
trustees have already approved
the use of $50 million in reserves
to cover the University deficits
over the next few years, but more
will likely be required.
A $24 million deficit will remain
in 1993-94, but most of the short
fall is due to additional one-time
costs of a similar nature, which
total an estimated $17.8 million.
The operating budget reveals
few new details of the $43-million
reduction proposal. The plans for
the schools and administrative
areas have remained relatively
unchanged since January.
Highlights of the academic plans
include the elimination of 30
tenure-track faculty billets through
attrition, realignment and consoli
dation of some academic depart
ments and the elimination of a few
programs within departments such
as drama and music.
Approximately 200 additional
master's students will be admit
ted to increase revenue for some
schools.
The administrative areas expect

to eliminate about 150 staff posi
tions, but it remains unclear
whether attrition as well as the staff
early retirement plan will be suffi
cient to accomplish this reduction.
Officials are still working on the
plans for the central initiatives,
which are expected to generate
enough revenue to cover almost 40
percent of the deficit reduction.
The proposed tax on restricted
funds expenditures remains in
the planning stage.
This charge would relieve the
burden that restricted contribu
tions place on the operating bud
get by requiring donations to
cover the indirect costs associated
with the project. It is unlikely that
a specific plan will be formulated
until the June trustee meeting.
Perhaps the most interesting
aspects of the operating budget
are its uncertainties, particularly
in the relationship between the
University and the federal gov
ernment.
"Continued uncertainty over
what indirect-cost rate the Univer
sity will ultimately negotiate with
the government has made estimat
ing reimbursement of indirect costs
a difficult task," wrote Provost

James Rosse in the document.
"Due to the uncertainty con
cerning these factors, the rate
assumed in the total budget for
1992-93 is in large part deter
mined by the 55.5 percent rate
that we have experienced in the
last two years."
Other potential difficulties in
planning the budget are the
future of tuition remission as well
as higher-than-expected costs of
complying with federal indirect
cost regulations.
The operating budget is based
on several other assumptions for
1992-93:
• An inflation-driven increase
in Medical School research vol
ume of 3 percent and in non-med
ical research of 3.5 percent;
• Projected indirect-cost recov
ery of $71.6 million, down from
$73.4 million in 1991-92; and
• An endowment payout of $63
million, an increase of only 2.8
percent over what was paid out
this year.
The increase in endowment
payout is small because unre
stricted reserves are being drawn
down to cover deficits, according
to the document.

refers to the University's year-to
year fiscal balance, will remain
largely because only half the $43-
million reduction proposal will
have been implemented by next
year. Most of its remaining ele
ments will be put into place for
the following academic year.
The one-time expenses are pri
marily the costs of complying
with new federal indirect-cost reg
ulations and include the costs of
consultants, lawyers and upgrad
ed accounting systems.
Also included in one-time costs
is the new staff early-retirement
plan, which is only available for a
limited time. The total expenses
remain uncertain because it is
unclear how many staff will opt

for the plan.
The operating budget does not
specify how the additional two
year deficit will be handled. The
trustees have already approved
the use of $50 million in reserves
to cover the University deficits
over the next few years, but more
will likely be required.
A $24 million deficit will remain
in 1993-94, but most of the short
fall is due to additional one-time
costs of a similar nature, which
total an estimated $17.8 million.
The operating budget reveals
few new details of the $43-million
reduction proposal. The plans for
the schools and administrative
areas have remained relatively
unchanged since January.
Highlights of the academic plans
include the elimination of 30
tenure-track faculty billets through
attrition, realignment and consoli
dation of some academic depart
ments and the elimination of a few
programs within departments such
as drama and music.
Approximately 200 additional
master's students will be admit
ted to increase revenue for some
schools.
The administrative areas expect

to eliminate about 150 staff posi
tions, but it remains unclear
whether attrition as well as the staff
early retirement plan will be suffi
cient to accomplish this reduction.
Officials are still working on the
plans for the central initiatives,
which are expected to generate
enough revenue to cover almost 40
percent of the deficit reduction.
The proposed tax on restricted
funds expenditures remains in
the planning stage.
This charge would relieve the
burden that restricted contribu
tions place on the operating bud
get by requiring donations to
cover the indirect costs associated
with the project. It is unlikely that
a specific plan will be formulated
until the June trustee meeting.
Perhaps the most interesting
aspects of the operating budget
are its uncertainties, particularly
in the relationship between the
University and the federal gov
ernment.
"Continued uncertainty over
what indirect-cost rate the Univer
sity will ultimately negotiate with
the government has made estimat
ing reimbursement of indirect costs
a difficult task," wrote Provost

James Rosse in the document.
"Due to the uncertainty con
cerning these factors, the rate
assumed in the total budget for
1992-93 is in large part deter
mined by the 55.5 percent rate
that we have experienced in the
last two years."
Other potential difficulties in
planning the budget are the
future of tuition remission as well
as higher-than-expected costs of
complying with federal indirect
cost regulations.
The operating budget is based
on several other assumptions for
1992-93:
• An inflation-driven increase
in Medical School research vol
ume of 3 percent and in non-med
ical research of 3.5 percent;
• Projected indirect-cost recov
ery of $71.6 million, down from
$73.4 million in 1991-92; and
• An endowment payout of $63
million, an increase of only 2.8
percent over what was paid out
this year.
The increase in endowment
payout is small because unre
stricted reserves are being drawn
down to cover deficits, according
to the document.
The University will continue
to operate with significant
deficits as it puts its $43-million
reduction package into place over
the next two years, partly due to
the expense of complying with
federal indirect-cost regulations.
The 1992-93 operating budget,
likely to be approved by the Board
of Trustees Monday, reveals the
magnitude of the University
shortfall for the next two years
but fails in many instances to
specify how the deficit will be
dealt with.
In addition, the budget plan
narrowly fails to achieve its goal
of reducing the budget shortfall
by $43 million, identifying only
$42 million in cuts and revenue
enhancements.
The operating budget also calls
for another unspecified increase
in tuition for 1993-94, which
would be greater than inflation
plus 1 percent.
Although the hike would likely
be less than this year's 9.5 percent,
tuition for 1993-94 will not be set
until the meeting of the trustees in
early 1993.
Next year's projected deficit
totals $38 million, including a
"budget-base" shortfall of $24.3
million and one-time costs of
$13.6 million.
