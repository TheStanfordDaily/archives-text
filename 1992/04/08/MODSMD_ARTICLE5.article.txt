# Even after cut of $43M, shortfall seen
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
A $10-$l5 million annual
deficit will still face the Uni
versity after the most recent
cuts are implemented,
according to the operating
budget likely to be approved
by the Board of Trustees
next week.
"Our best assessment of
the future is that even with
the full incorporation of the
$43 million budget adjust
ment effort, Stanford will
still face a structural prob
lem in its operating budget,"
wrote Provost James Rosse
in the operating budget.
"Under current planning
scenarios, which have been
developed using appropriately
conservative assumptions, a short
fall continues to exist at an annual
level of approximately $10-$ 15 mil
lion."
The operating budget makes
no mention of ways the Universi
ty might address the future
deficit, but the Trustees Task
Force on Financial Policy is cur
rently studying how to avoid mak
ing more cuts.
University President Donald
Kennedy, when he first warned
five weeks ago of a "substantial"
additional deficit, said the
trustees have expressed a com
mitment to not requiring addi
tional academic cuts.
Because of the significant

reductions already undergone by
the schools and academic areas,
the trustee committee will likely
concentrate on revenue enhance
ment ideas, such as altering the
endowment payout rate and

various investments, such as the
Stanford Shopping Center, is allo
cated to the budget.
The prediction of a $10-$l5 mil
lion deficit relies heavily on proba
bility estimates and financial
assumptions rather than definite
data, according to the operating
budget.

For instance, the University
continues to operate with a provi
sional indirect-cost rate of 55.5
percent, and the administration
remains unsure of when a perma
nent rate will be negotiated and
what it will be.
"There are, of course, consider
able risks and uncertainty around
that range of shortfall," Rosse
wrote. "Those risks include, but
are not limited to, changes in
research volume, the future
structure of indirect-cost rates,
endowment performance and the
considerable uncertainty over the
future mechanisms for charging
staff benefits."
Also in serious jeopardy is the
future of tuition remission, which
is the federal policy of reimburs
ing the University for the tuition
of graduate students involved in
federally sponsored research.
