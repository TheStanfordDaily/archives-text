# Theta Delts launch Rush close to home
## Use of former parking lot questioned

prohibited by the University from
holding its Rush functions at their
old house at 675 Lomita, used the

Delt officer Marc Foravanti, adding
that the location is also convenient.
But Sarah Bernstein, the resi

and sees it as a kind of harassment
"unless they talk to me about it."

the University on the conditions

for getting a house again. Accord

involves staying away from their
old house, which is now a self-op.
"It was one of the first stipula

situation almost a year ago, Con
klin said. "While the house was
occupied by others," she said, the
Theta Delts were to stay clear of it.
But Foravanti said he did not
think "complete avoidance" was
required by the contract,
although it was agreed that fra

the house as their own or harass
residents in any way.
Conklin said that although it
was not written into the final
