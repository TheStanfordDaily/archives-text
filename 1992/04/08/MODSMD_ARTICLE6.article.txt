# Theta Delts launch Rush close to home
## Use of former parking lot questioned 
### Anush Yegyazarian Staff writer 
The Theta Delta Chi fraternity,
prohibited by the University from
holding its Rush functions at their
old house at 675 Lomita, used the
parking lot for last night's infor
mation session instead.
"By having it there we're sort of
making a statement," said Theta
Delt officer Marc Foravanti, adding
that the location is also convenient.
But Sarah Bernstein, the resi
dent assistant at 675, said she was
not told that the Theta Delts were
planning to use the parking lot
and sees it as a kind of harassment
"unless they talk to me about it."
The fraternity, unhoused as of
this year, has an agreement with
the University on the conditions

for getting a house again. Accord
ing to Row Director Diana Con
klin, part of the agreement
involves staying away from their
old house, which is now a self-op.
"It was one of the first stipula
tions I made" when negotiating the
situation almost a year ago, Con
klin said. "While the house was
occupied by others," she said, the
Theta Delts were to stay clear of it.
But Foravanti said he did not
think "complete avoidance" was
required by the contract,
although it was agreed that fra
ternity members would not treat
the house as their own or harass
residents in any way.
Conklin said that although it
was not written into the final
agreement, the condition was
made "very clear" several times
and without it, the whole proposal
"would not have gone forward."
The condition was intended to
make the residents of 675 feel like
the house was theirs, Conklin
said, and not a fraternity house
they were holding while the
Theta Delts were away.
But Rob Tymoczko, former
Theta Delt president, said, "We
weren't even allowed to ask the
residents whether we could have
any functions there."
He said he spoke to Bernstein
and was told she had been instruct
ed not to allow the Theta Delts to
hold any Rush events at the house.
Tymoczko said he thinks it is
unfair that other unhoused fra
ternities like Sigma Nu can pay
residences — including 675 — a
fee to use them for events, but the
Theta Delts can't.
According to Foravanti, if the
house "decided they didn't want
us to be there, that's one thing,"
but it is not right for the Row
Office to decide.
Conklin said she did not feel it
was fair to make the residents of

the house have to decide.
Bernstein said she was
informed of the Res Ed decision
last quarter. The residents of 675
"hadn't talked about that situation
specifically, but we had talked
about what we would do if fraterni
ties in general asked to have their
parties at our house," she said.
Though the house did not adopt
a general policy, Bernstein said "it
seems that the residents would not
have felt comfortable with Theta
Delts rushing" at the house.
But Tymoczko said he knows
some 675 residents and didn't
believe there would have been a
problem with the fraternity hav
ing Rush events there.
Tymoczko said the fraternity
had not planned to have parties at
675, but wanted to use the house
as the lo6ation of their Rush
activities. "We're rebuilding the
fraternity," he said.
The fraternity needs 45 mem
bers if it is to regain housing.
There are currently about 20
Theta Delts, but only a handful
are active, according to Tymoczko.
Heather Dunn, student activi
ties program coordinator, said
that by having an information
session in the parking lot, the
Theta Delts "are running a risk of
jeopardizing the agreement."
