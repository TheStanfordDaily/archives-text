Landing a "360" off the
Quad steps could cost skate
boarders up to $100 after yes
terday's approval of an ordi
nance banning skateboarding
on campus.
The Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors voted
unanimously to prohibit the use
of "skateboards, coasters or sim
ilar devices within the central
academic campus" of Stanford.
The ordinance was written
by County Counsel James
Lewis in response to a Feb. 21
letter written by University
Vice President for Public
Affairs Bob Freelen.
In the letter, Freelen
described "a virtual invasion of
the University," pointing out
that since other cities have
passed ordinances banning
skateboarding, the youths flock
to Stanford.
The skateboarders "cause
substantial damage to Universi
ty property, and their noise has
caused at least one faculty mem
ber to cut short his classes,"
Freelen wrote.
Freelen had lobbied the
Board of Supervisors in person
about the skateboarders before

he wrote the letter, according
to Administrative Aide John
Gibbs.
Campus skateboarders
appeared more outraged than
daunted by the ordinance, and
several said they intended to
continue skateboarding any
way.
At yesterday's hearing,
Supervisor Michael Honda
and two community members
raised concerns that students
who use skateboards for
transportation — not stunts
— could be unfairly persecut
ed.
In response, Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herring
ton said his department will be
"responding based on com
plaints."
He added that most com
plaints are directed toward
recreational skateboarders, so
students should be able to con
tinue using skateboards as
transportation.
However, the actual ordi
nance was not amended to
make such allowances.

Skateboarders had varied reactions to yesterday's ruling. One said he acknowledges that the activi
ty disrupts classes. But others said the decision was unfair and claimed they would defy It.
