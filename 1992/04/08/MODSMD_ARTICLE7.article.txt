Landing a "360" off the
Quad steps could cost skate
boarders up to $100 after yes
terday's approval of an ordi
nance banning skateboarding
on campus.
The Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors voted
unanimously to prohibit the use
of "skateboards, coasters or sim
ilar devices within the central
academic campus" of Stanford.
The ordinance was written
by County Counsel James
Lewis in response to a Feb. 21
letter written by University
Vice President for Public
Affairs Bob Freelen.
In the letter, Freelen
described "a virtual invasion of
the University," pointing out
that since other cities have
passed ordinances banning
skateboarding, the youths flock
to Stanford.
The skateboarders "cause
substantial damage to Universi
ty property, and their noise has
caused at least one faculty mem
ber to cut short his classes,"
Freelen wrote.
Freelen had lobbied the
Board of Supervisors in person
about the skateboarders before
