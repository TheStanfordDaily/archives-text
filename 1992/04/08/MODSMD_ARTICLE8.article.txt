"Skateboarding is not a
crime."
The familiar bumper stick
er's slogan can no longer be
applied to the Stanford campus,
after the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors' decision
yesterday.
"I'm incensed that [the
Board has] the gall to do this,"
said junior Matt Tripp, speak
ing on behalf of angry students
who also use campus grounds
for skateboarding.
"If I'm paying $24,000, I
should be allowed to do what I
want," Tripp said. "Stanford
University is supposed to be a big
liberal institution. But it's a dic
tatorship here. It's like the hand
of God — WHAM — put this
ordinance down. And reversing it
is going to be veiy hard."
Others, however, were
pleased by the ban.
"The Stanford campus [is] a
serene type of campus,. . not the
appropriate place for skateboard
ing," said Irvin David, a Palo
Alto resident and community
activist who has been pushing
for the ruling for several years.
"I feel very violated because
the skateboarders are taking
over," David added. "I come on
campus to get away from the
stress that occurs off campus. But
these kids make such a racket."
The Board's decision to ban
skateboarding is part of an effort
to appease community members
and University staff and faculty,
who, like David, oppose recre
ational skateboarding mostly
because of the noise.
The University's skateboard
er-friendly campus has caused it
to become a magnet for young
daredevils, mostly teenagers
who attend local schools. David
places part of blame on Universi
ty architects, saying that "the
people that constructed the cam
pus put in too many stairs and
too much concrete."
Tripp, who wrote his Stan
ford application essay on the
physics of skateboarding and his
passion for it as a sport, said he
decided to attend Stanford
instead of Princeton based on
Stanford's superior skateboard
ing facilities. "Princeton has all
gravel roads," Tripp explained.

The handful of undergradu
ates that do skateboard at Stan
ford "tend to be liberal, to the
left, and very bizarre," Tripp
said. They view skateboarding as
a very serious sport, not just a
recreational activity.
Sophomore Tony Sirna also
defended skateboarders. "Just
'cause it's not a mainstream
sport doesn't mean it should be
illegal," he said.
But Elizabeth Rafferty, a
staff assistant in the political sci
ence department, says she sees
the sport causing problems
every day.
"Our department in Building
160 . . . seems to be the area [the
skateboarders] preferred most.
They would skate right up the
two steps of the door," she said.
But Pedro Guerro, a high
school skateboarder, said defi
antly,"We're not rude. When,
like, a family is walking. We
don't skate while they pass by."
"When they ask us to leave,
we usually do," added David
Rosenberg, a student from
Peninsula Middle School.
The adults aren't always so
polite, the skateboarders say.
Rosenberg remembers an
incident on campus when he felt
he was unreasonably hassled by
an irate man.
"One time I got approached
by a guy coming out of a build
ing. He came up to me. He was
all, 'RARRRR' " he said. "My
board shot out towards him. He

grabbed it and slammed it on the
floor and screamed 'Get out of
here you little shit!' "
Rafferty explained that the
instructors find skateboarders
"very obtrusive."
"Just having them chased
away [by police] wasn't enough.
We're concerned for their safety
as well as our own," she added.
However, Menlo-Atherton
High School student Rob Beck
strom pointed out that skate
boarders are aware of the per
sonal risks. "People have hurt
themselves. It's our choice to get
ourselves hurt," he said.
Josh Douglas, a freshman at
Menlo College who skateboards
at Stanford in the afternoons,
claims that he has suffered more
physical harm by police enforce
ment than skating wildly.
"One time in San Francisco
[two policemen] grabbed me and
put me up against the wall. They
started frisldng me and stuff,"
Douglas recalled. "The cop took my
glasses off, and the other one put
me in a choke hold. He just popped
me in the face,... all because they
caught me skateboarding."
Outraged by such alleged
incidents, these skateboarders
do not see yesterday's ruling as a
deterrent to skateboarding.
"It just makes me want to skate
even more," said Beckstrom, grip
ping the sides of his skateboard
with new determination.
"Nothing's going to stop these
kids from having fun,... and I don't

think anything should," said Stan
ford freshman Tqj James, who uses
his skateboard for transportation.
According to David, there are
two differences between the noise
pollution created by skateboard
ing and, for example, a band play
ing loud music in White Plaza.
"Everyone derives benefit
from a band. The only person
benefitting from skateboarding
are the skateboarders them
selves," David said.
Many skateboard supporters
are claiming foul play over yes
terday's decision. "It's unfair
that the meeting [was held] on a
weekday at 11 a.m. The skate
boarders [couldn't] go. They're
in school," said James Cramton,
a 1991 Stanford graduate.
"If people can wear spandex to
class, then I should be able to
skateboard," he said.
Matt Russell, an avid high
school skateboarder, concedes
that the University has a right to
protect the class environment. "I
can understand them banning us
from Stanford because it's dis
rupting classes," he said.
"But you can't just say we're
not going to skate anywhere in
Santa Clara County ever more.
The park they've given us is not
enough," Russell added, refer
ring to the skateboarding park
in Palo Alto.
"You get bored of these parks.
You need new terrain — streets,
ramps, steps and bowls. So make
new parks ... or change the law."

after the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors' decision
yesterday.
"I'm incensed that [the
Board has] the gall to do this,"
said junior Matt Tripp, speak
ing on behalf of angry students
who also use campus grounds
for skateboarding.
"If I'm paying $24,000, I
should be allowed to do what I
want," Tripp said. "Stanford
University is supposed to be a big
liberal institution. But it's a dic
tatorship here. It's like the hand
of God — WHAM — put this
ordinance down. And reversing it
is going to be veiy hard."
Others, however, were
pleased by the ban.
"The Stanford campus [is] a
serene type of campus,. . not the
appropriate place for skateboard
ing," said Irvin David, a Palo
Alto resident and community
activist who has been pushing
for the ruling for several years.
"I feel very violated because
the skateboarders are taking
over," David added. "I come on
campus to get away from the
stress that occurs off campus. But
these kids make such a racket."
The Board's decision to ban
skateboarding is part of an effort
to appease community members
and University staff and faculty,
who, like David, oppose recre
ational skateboarding mostly
because of the noise.
The University's skateboard
er-friendly campus has caused it
to become a magnet for young
daredevils, mostly teenagers
who attend local schools. David
places part of blame on Universi
ty architects, saying that "the
people that constructed the cam
pus put in too many stairs and
too much concrete."
Tripp, who wrote his Stan
ford application essay on the
physics of skateboarding and his
passion for it as a sport, said he
decided to attend Stanford
instead of Princeton based on
Stanford's superior skateboard
ing facilities. "Princeton has all
gravel roads," Tripp explained.

The handful of undergradu
ates that do skateboard at Stan
ford "tend to be liberal, to the
left, and very bizarre," Tripp
said. They view skateboarding as
a very serious sport, not just a
recreational activity.
Sophomore Tony Sirna also
defended skateboarders. "Just
'cause it's not a mainstream
sport doesn't mean it should be
illegal," he said.
But Elizabeth Rafferty, a
staff assistant in the political sci
ence department, says she sees
the sport causing problems
every day.
"Our department in Building
160 . . . seems to be the area [the
skateboarders] preferred most.
They would skate right up the
two steps of the door," she said.
But Pedro Guerro, a high
school skateboarder, said defi
antly,"We're not rude. When,
like, a family is walking. We
don't skate while they pass by."
"When they ask us to leave,
we usually do," added David
Rosenberg, a student from
Peninsula Middle School.
The adults aren't always so
polite, the skateboarders say.
Rosenberg remembers an
incident on campus when he felt
he was unreasonably hassled by
an irate man.
"One time I got approached
by a guy coming out of a build
ing. He came up to me. He was
all, 'RARRRR' " he said. "My
board shot out towards him. He

grabbed it and slammed it on the
floor and screamed 'Get out of
here you little shit!' "
Rafferty explained that the
instructors find skateboarders
"very obtrusive."
"Just having them chased
away [by police] wasn't enough.
We're concerned for their safety
as well as our own," she added.
However, Menlo-Atherton
High School student Rob Beck
strom pointed out that skate
boarders are aware of the per
sonal risks. "People have hurt
themselves. It's our choice to get
ourselves hurt," he said.
Josh Douglas, a freshman at
Menlo College who skateboards
at Stanford in the afternoons,
claims that he has suffered more
physical harm by police enforce
ment than skating wildly.
"One time in San Francisco
[two policemen] grabbed me and
put me up against the wall. They
started frisldng me and stuff,"
Douglas recalled. "The cop took my
glasses off, and the other one put
me in a choke hold. He just popped
me in the face,... all because they
caught me skateboarding."
Outraged by such alleged
incidents, these skateboarders
do not see yesterday's ruling as a
deterrent to skateboarding.
"It just makes me want to skate
even more," said Beckstrom, grip
ping the sides of his skateboard
with new determination.
"Nothing's going to stop these
kids from having fun,... and I don't

think anything should," said Stan
ford freshman Tqj James, who uses
his skateboard for transportation.
According to David, there are
two differences between the noise
pollution created by skateboard
ing and, for example, a band play
ing loud music in White Plaza.
"Everyone derives benefit
from a band. The only person
benefitting from skateboarding
are the skateboarders them
selves," David said.
Many skateboard supporters
are claiming foul play over yes
terday's decision. "It's unfair
that the meeting [was held] on a
weekday at 11 a.m. The skate
boarders [couldn't] go. They're
in school," said James Cramton,
a 1991 Stanford graduate.
"If people can wear spandex to
class, then I should be able to
skateboard," he said.
Matt Russell, an avid high
school skateboarder, concedes
that the University has a right to
protect the class environment. "I
can understand them banning us
from Stanford because it's dis
rupting classes," he said.
"But you can't just say we're
not going to skate anywhere in
Santa Clara County ever more.
The park they've given us is not
enough," Russell added, refer
ring to the skateboarding park
in Palo Alto.
"You get bored of these parks.
You need new terrain — streets,
ramps, steps and bowls. So make
new parks ... or change the law."
"Skateboarding is not a
crime."

er's slogan can no longer be
applied to the Stanford campus,

Board of Supervisors' decision
yesterday.
