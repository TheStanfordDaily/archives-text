# Tuition hikes provide incentive to graduate
## Stanford undergrads, unlike state students, can't afford to slow pace 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
While an increasing number of
students at California's public
schools are taking more than four
years to graduate, Stanford
undergraduates seem to be in a
hurry to leave.
More Stanford students get
their degrees in four years or
fewer now than they did seven
years ago, due in part to factors
such as rising tuition costs,
according to Patty McGowan,
director of research at the Regis
trar's Office.
McGowan said 67.4 percent of
1980's entering freshmen gradu
ated by 1984. By last year, the
four-year graduation rate had
risen to 76.2 percent. About 90
percent graduate within five years.
Other private universities,
such as Cornell and Princeton,
have also experienced a rise in
four-year graduation rates.
At the same time, some Califor

nia state schools have been experi
encing an opposite trend. Some
have attributed the rising rate of
delayed graduations at these
schools to budget cuts, which have
reduced the number of classes and
made it more difficult for students
to get into those they need.
"That's why I came here," said
freshman Ayanna Bennett, who
turned down a full scholarship at
UC-Berkeley to attend Stanford.
"I knew I was going to end up
spending five years there," said
Bennett, who plans to study
medicine. "With all the years of
school ahead of me, it would be
ridiculous for me to spend longer
than I had to."
But Bob Cox, an analyst at UC-
Berkeley's Office of Institutional
Research, said he is reluctant to
call students' prolonged college
experiences a trend. He said it
"has not been identified as a key
problem" yet.
However, at UCLA, "the evi
dence is pretty strong that [stu
dents arel spending a lot more than
four years," said Wayne Smith, an
analyst at the university's Office of
Academic Planning and Budget.
He said only 25.5 percent of
freshmen who entered UCLA in
1986 received a degree in four
years, while a cumulative 65.7
percent of those students gradu
ated in five years.

One reason for Stanford's
increased four-year [graduation rate
might be rising tuition costs,
McGowan said. Tuition rose from
$6,285 per year in 1980 to $11,208 in
1986, according to Registrar's Office
Assistant Supervisor Ann Scher.
Tuition now costs $15,102 per
year and will rise to $16,536 for
the next academic year.
"With the tuition increases,
people tend to want to get out of
here faster," McGowan said.
Also, more students are enter
ing Stanford with Advanced
Placement credit, she said. And
students are stopping out less

often, which contributes to their
speedier graduation.

However, some students said
they would spend more time at
Stanford if they could. "I think

it's good to take more than four
years," said freshman Jeff
Meador, who said he would take
five or six years to graduate if he
could afford it.
Senior Maria Chow said she is
staying an extra year because she
"knew it was going to be very
hellish [finding] a job." Although
she graduated in three years, she
returned this year to pursue her
master's degree.
Hector Cuevas, director of the
Undergraduate Advising Center,
said delayed graduation "crosses
the mind of many students at
some time."
