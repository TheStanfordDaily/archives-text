# Tuition hikes provide incentive to graduate
## Stanford undergrads, unlike state students, can't afford to slow pace 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
While an increasing number of
students at California's public
schools are taking more than four
years to graduate, Stanford
undergraduates seem to be in a
hurry to leave.
More Stanford students get
their degrees in four years or
fewer now than they did seven
years ago, due in part to factors
such as rising tuition costs,
according to Patty McGowan,
director of research at the Regis
trar's Office.
McGowan said 67.4 percent of
1980's entering freshmen gradu
ated by 1984. By last year, the
four-year graduation rate had
risen to 76.2 percent. About 90
percent graduate within five years.
Other private universities,
such as Cornell and Princeton,
have also experienced a rise in
four-year graduation rates.
At the same time, some Califor

nia state schools have been experi
encing an opposite trend. Some
have attributed the rising rate of
delayed graduations at these
schools to budget cuts, which have
reduced the number of classes and
made it more difficult for students
to get into those they need.
"That's why I came here," said
freshman Ayanna Bennett, who
turned down a full scholarship at
UC-Berkeley to attend Stanford.
"I knew I was going to end up
spending five years there," said
Bennett, who plans to study
medicine. "With all the years of
school ahead of me, it would be
ridiculous for me to spend longer
than I had to."
But Bob Cox, an analyst at UC-
Berkeley's Office of Institutional
Research, said he is reluctant to
call students' prolonged college
experiences a trend. He said it
"has not been identified as a key
problem" yet.
