County tells skaters to
do the latter, but their
ordinance is misguided

The law slammed down
like a failed jump attempt as
the county voted Tuesday to
pass an ordinance banning skate
boarding on campus.
The Santa Clara County Board
of Supervisors — at the suggestion
of Vice President for Public Affairs
Bob Freelen — acted harshly and
presumptuously against youths
who are merely practicing a recre
ational sport.
While disruptions to classes and
potential safety hazards should be
stopped, a county ordinance impos
ing fines of up to $100 is unnecessary.
Like any other typical distrac
tion that may require intervention
— such as people talking loudly or
blasting music — skateboarders
should be asked to move or change
their behavior if they become too
rambunctious.
But a law like the one passed by
the board creates more problems
than it solves, needlessly compli
cating the enforcement role of
Stanford police. How will they
decide the difference between
recreational skateboarding and
what is considered legitimate
transportation?
A better solution would be to post
signs making the Quad and other
classroom areas ofT-limits during
weekdays — despite Freelen's
assertion in a letter to the county
that such a ban would be ineffective.
When Freelen wrote the letter
— which urged the board to "enact
legislation to protect the Universi
ty from the dangers, damage and
nuisance caused by these youths"
— he made hasty assumptions
about the skateboarders' character.
"We are told that trespass laws
and signs prohibiting skateboard
ing will not solve the problem," he
wrote. "We understand that the
problem can best be handled

through a county ordinance."
Freelen does not elaborate on
the sources he used to reach those
conclusions. But the ambiguity of
his remarks reveals a predisposi
tion toward believing the worst
about skateboarders.
In his letter, Freelen also com
plained that the skaters cause
"substantial damage to University
property." That argument fails,
however. Aside from some scuffed
concrete, the skaters really cause
no visible damage.
The county's sudden and extreme
decision — the board acted without
giving the youths a formal warning
or a chance to negotiate — explains
why one skateboarder bitterly pro
claimed that the ordinance was "like
the hand of God - WHAM."
The fact that the ordinance's
public hearing was scheduled for
11 a.m. on a weekday in San Jose
is also indicative of how much —
or how little — value was attached
to the skateboarders' input.
Not surprisingly, the only two
people from the community who
voiced an opinion at the hearing
were adult non-skaters.
Freelen and others argue that
the skateboarders are safety haz
ards to themselves and others.
However, a handful of skaters con
gregating around the post office
does not seem like a formidable
safety problem compared to the
masses of bikers racing through
campus — many of whom are much
more reckless than the skateboard
ers are made out to be.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington suggested at Tues
day's hearing that the severity of
the ordinance would be countered
by the fact that the department
would respond "based on com
plaints" so that students who use
skateboards for transportation
will not be penalized.
Yet, as Herrington acknowl
edged, making a distinction
between skateboarding for trans
portation and recreational skate
boarding is quite tricky.
Clearly, this ordinance is more
trouble than it's worth.
