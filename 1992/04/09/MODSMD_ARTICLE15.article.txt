"ELVIS WAS A HERO to most but he
never meant s--t to me"
— Public Enemy
Though the United States Postal
Service will soon honor the "King
of Rock" with a stamp, Elvis is seen
by many blacks as little more than a rip
off artist. His scandalous dances and
record-breaking hits were mostly taken
from black rhythm and blues artists like
Big Mama Thorton and Otis Blackwell;
he did this with little credit or compensa
tion — sometimes called theft.
The pattern of white artists covering
black songs and styles, often with greater
success than the original artists, is old
news. Today artists like Vanilla Ice and
the Beastie Boys, weak rappers at best,
far outsell their more clever and inven
tive black peers.
Ironically, Public Enemy — like all rap
groups — samples snippets of songs by
funk and soul artists of years past, also
with little credit or compensation —
though with far more innovation. While
Public Enemy vilify Elvis, they too "bor
row" from black artists.
If imitation is the highest form of flat
tery, then the long list of white artists
who copied black music certainly appreci
ated that; yet what is the line between
appreciation and exploitation? How do
we value culture, especially that of oth
ers, without falling into the pattern of
exploitation?
For example, in "Can I Get A Witness"

Public Enemy challenge those who might
take them to court for illegal sampling to
"sample this: my pitbull." Yet, when
Madonna borrowed an uncredited set of
beats from them, they sued her — cooly
ignoring the fact that they had themselves
taken the beats from James Brown.
James Brown can lay claim to particu
lar lyrics but who can copyright a dance
step, a style of dress, an innovation in
music? These creative forces belong to no
individual and yet collectively to a group.
In another example, voguing used to
be the exclusive domain of gay black and
Hispanic men in New York before
Madonna borrowed that, too. But we
know whose ingenuity made scads of
money from it.
Perhaps this is inevitable in a multicul
tural society and in particular in the inter
play of culture and capitalism. For better or
worse, our modern capitalist world relent
lessly turns cultures into commodities.
Given the current dominance of capi
talism, we should ensure that the com
modification of culture happens in more
ethical and mutually beneficial ways.
Then the enormous appeal of black cul
ture could be harnessed for the economic
empowerment of blacks.
One basic notion of justice — often
talked about by Black Nationalists — is
that money spent by a community should
ultimately return to that community.
There are even precedents within Cuban,

Korean, Japanese and Jewish communi
ties of a strong ethic to support business
es owned by members of the respective
group. Still, it seems absurd to imagine
say, Madonna paying royalties to gay
black and Hispanic men.
How then could collective black cre
ativity — whether used by Keith Richards
or Prince — be channelled into financial
advancement for blacks?
Perhaps the real difference between
appreciation and exploitation is one of
recognition and wealth. Just as black
individuals in America today have bene
fitted from the collective struggles of
blacks before them, rich and famous rock
musicians who have borrowed from
bygone blues masters could see to it that
some of their wealth and stature is
returned to black communities.
This is in no way enforceable legally,
nor would I want to see it put in a con
tract, but each individual has the choice
to give back to those who helped them
and can be judged accordingly. And until
credit is given where it is due, Elvis will
live on in the Vanilla Ices of the world.

Omar knows that Elvis is an anagram
for evils.
