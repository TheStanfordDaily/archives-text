Student shares experience of being bone marrow donor

EVERY TIME I WALK into my
room and see the picture on my
desk of a smiling 21-year-old
woman, I have to smile also. I have
never met the woman in the picture, I
don't even know her name, yet we share
a common bond: my bone marrow.
Bone marrow transplants are used as
treatment for a number of different dis
eases, the most common being leukemia
and special cases of anemia.
Standard cancer treatments, such as
chemotherapy or radiation, are unable
to cure the infected marrow. The
replacement of healthy marrow for the
diseased marrow is the only hope for
curing the cancer completely.
Often a sibling or other relative will
be an eligible donor, but for those people
who do not have an eligible matched rel
ative, the only hope is an unrelated
donor, which is where the National Bone

Marrow Program comes in.
Less than a year ago, I entered my
name into the National Bone Marrow
Donor Program, a nationwide directory
which attempts to match people who
need bone marrow transplants with eli
gible unrelated donors.
All you need to enter the directory is
a blood sample, which they can take
when you are donating blood, so they
can input some general information on
your blood type.
When a person needs a bone marrow
transplant, they scan through all those
in the directory. If you are a preliminary
match, they ask you for some more
blood samples.
The chances of being matched with
an unrelated person are estimated to lie
between one in 100 and one in 100,000.
Some people remain in the directory for
years without being matched; I was

lucky enough to be matched within a few
months of entering the program.
After more than six months of waiting
to hear the results of the blood tests, a
comprehensive physical exam and a dona
tion of three autologous units of blood, I
entered the hospital for the donation.
I was put under general anesthesia
during the short, relatively routine proce
dure — there are some side effects from
the anesthesia, I was very tired for several
days and it felt like someone had kicked
me very hard in the rear end (which is
where they draw the marrow from) — but
every minute of pain was well worth it.
Three weeks have now passed and I feel
completely back to normal again.
It is hard to believe that a relatively
simple operation could have such an
impact on one's life. Yet for me it has
turned out to be the most rewarding
experience I have ever gone through, for

reasons I would not have expected.
I never thought I would be so excited
just because I was able to cross my legs
or touch my toes without pain. I feel
more worthwhile, that I have really been
able to help someone.
I highly encourage everyone to enter
the National Bone Marrow Program.
There is no commitment involved in
entering the directory, and if you do end
up donating, it will be a rewarding expe
rience that I doubt you will ever regret.
There is absolutely no cost to the
donor, and the appreciation for life and
health you gain is invaluable. I would do
it again tomorrow if I could. Even if the
transplant is not successful, I am sure
that donating bone marrow will remain
the greatest gift I have ever given — a
second chance at life.
