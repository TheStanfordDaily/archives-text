# Advantages of animal research are neglected
## 
### 
We are writing in response to Linda Lee
Evans' horribly misinformed letter on
Apr. 6 regarding animal research.
As students who are admittedly
biased, but nonetheless familiar with the
literature, we must forcefully disagree
that animal research is no longer neces
sary in order to cure diseases.
This is one of the most false claims of
the radical animal rights movement.
Computer simulations simply cannot
predict how people respond to drugs,
and in vitro technologies make use of
cells taken from sacrificed animals.
Scientists are very interested in devel
oping substitutes for animal research,
but these alternatives must be developed
in concert with existing regulated animal
experimentation if any real progress is to
be made toward curing very real diseases.

What those familiar with the litera
ture do unanimously agree on is that
without the presently undervalued bene
fits of animal research there will never
be a cure for AIDS, and there will never
be therapy for Alzheimer's disease.
Children will continue to die of dis
eases like cystic fibrosis and muscular
dystrophy, and cancer patients will con
tinue to experience intractable pain dur
ing chemotherapy.
The fact is that all these conditions
will either be cured in the near future or
will become much easier to treat as a
direct result of recent and continuing
animal research.
Finally, unlike Evans, we believe that it
is essential to maintain an open debate on
the way in which animal research can be
most humanely conducted.
For this reason, we think that The
Daily should be lauded, rather than
chastised, for publishing the views of
both sides of this debate.
We look forward to compassionate,

well-reasoned discussion of these issues
in the future.
