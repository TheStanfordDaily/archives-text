# Articles on crew team ignore women's efforts
## 
### 
I am writing to express my frustra
tion at The Daily's reporting of the per
formances of the crew team.
In articles on March 31 and April 8,
headlines such as "Crew starts off well"
promised articles about the entire crew
team. Instead, they dealt exclusively with
the men's team and their season this spring.
No mention at all was made of the
women's team, implying that the impor
tance of the crew team lies with its male
rowers.
This is unfair to the women's half of
the team. Far from being insignificant,

as the articles suggest, the women's
team has come through the season so far
with more wins than the men.
I realize that due to limited amounts
of time, space or reporters, The Daily
may not be able to fully cover every sport
each week and perhaps some sort of rota
tion would be fair. But since for two
weeks now the crew articles have men
tioned only half of the team, it doesn't
seem as though such fairness is intended.
If The Daily plans to continue publish
ing articles reporting solely on the men's
crew team, at least they could do it without
misrepresenting the makeup of the team.
It only would be honest to state clear
ly "Men's crew starts off well," so that
at least readers would not be misled into
thinking that there is no Stanford
women's crew team.
Preferably, though, both halves of the
crew team deserve fair and accurate
reporting in The Daily.
