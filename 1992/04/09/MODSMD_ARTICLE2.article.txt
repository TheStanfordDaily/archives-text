# Phone-monopoly suit could collect 2 years' free calls
## Stanford, Pac Bell say 'ridiculous'

Every Stanford student could
receive two years of virtually free
telephone service, if a complaint
against the University and Pacific
Bell is decided in favor of four
Stanford students.
In a brief filed Tuesday before
the California Public Utility Com
mission, the students allege that
Pacific Bell broke the law by sell
ing telephone equipment to Stan
ford, cutting off thousands of stu
dents from Pacific Bell and Uni
versal Lifeline Telephone Service.
In the brief, the complainants
ask that all Stanford students
receive free interstate calls for two
years and 24 vouchers worth $10
per month for long-distance calls.
Representatives of Stanford
and Pacific Bell have called the
request "ridiculous" and said
they do not expect the students to
win the case.
"I do not believe that any
wrongdoing was established
whatsoever," said Chris Ras

Pacific Bell. "I don't think there
are any facts that support the

$4.5 million figure."
According to electrical engineer
ing graduate student Michael Mur
ray, one of the complainants, the
students have asked the commis
sion to order the company to repay
Stanford residents more than $4.5
million in "overcharges."
These charges represent the
difference between what students
would have paid under Pacific
Bell and what they actually pay
under the Stanford system,
according to the complainants.
The equipment sale allowed
the University to set up its own
phone system and become the
sole supplier of telephone service
to campus residences, beginning
in the summer of 1990.
The students argue that the
University and Pacific Bell are
effectively limiting their ability to
choose a long-distance carrier.
But although the students claim
that Stanford aided and abetted
in the alleged transgressions,
they have not requested that
Stanford repay any of the money.

students' lawyer, said the $4.5
