# Phone-monopoly suit could collect 2 years' free calls
## Stanford, Pac Bell say 'ridiculous' 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
Every Stanford student could
receive two years of virtually free
telephone service, if a complaint
against the University and Pacific
Bell is decided in favor of four
Stanford students.
In a brief filed Tuesday before
the California Public Utility Com
mission, the students allege that
Pacific Bell broke the law by sell
ing telephone equipment to Stan
ford, cutting off thousands of stu
dents from Pacific Bell and Uni
versal Lifeline Telephone Service.
In the brief, the complainants
ask that all Stanford students
receive free interstate calls for two
years and 24 vouchers worth $10
per month for long-distance calls.
Representatives of Stanford
and Pacific Bell have called the
request "ridiculous" and said
they do not expect the students to
win the case.
"I do not believe that any
wrongdoing was established
whatsoever," said Chris Ras
musseon, senior legal counsel for
Pacific Bell. "I don't think there
are any facts that support the

$4.5 million figure."
According to electrical engineer
ing graduate student Michael Mur
ray, one of the complainants, the
students have asked the commis
sion to order the company to repay
Stanford residents more than $4.5
million in "overcharges."
These charges represent the
difference between what students
would have paid under Pacific
Bell and what they actually pay
under the Stanford system,
according to the complainants.
The equipment sale allowed
the University to set up its own
phone system and become the
sole supplier of telephone service
to campus residences, beginning
in the summer of 1990.
The students argue that the
University and Pacific Bell are
effectively limiting their ability to
choose a long-distance carrier.
But although the students claim
that Stanford aided and abetted
in the alleged transgressions,
they have not requested that
Stanford repay any of the money.
Jonathan Stein, the graduate
students' lawyer, said the $4.5
million figure was calculated by
accounting for changes in instal
lation fees, local call charges and
long-distance charges as a result
of the switchover.
Rasmusseon maintains that
Pacific Bell acted in good faith
and that the commission had
authorized the sale of the cable.
This latest request is part of an
ongoing case first filed in May
1990, when the sale was being
negotiated.
At that time, the graduate stu
dents alleged that if Stanford were
to become the sole provider of tele
phone services to campus resi
dences, this would violate a provi
sion of public utility law known as
Shared Tenant guidelines.
Guideline eight of the commis
sion's Shared Tenant Decision
states that "the property owner or
manager shall place no restric
tions on tenants which desire ser
vice directly from the telephone
utility [Pacific Bell] in addition to
or in lieu of service furnished by
the provider [Stanford]."
But in June 1990 the commis
sion ruled that Stanford, like
hotels, motels and hospitals, is
exempt from the provision
because students are "tempo

rary," not permanent, residents.
However, Murray and his grad
uate student co-complainants Bill
Behrman, Gerald LeTendre and
Mary Beth Rice argued that most
graduate students live on campus
for four years, often in the same
place, and therefore should not be
considered temporary residents.

University officials say
they have data to prove
that students are not
permanent residents.

The students appealed the deci
sion and were granted a rehearing
in the fall of 1990. New evidenciary
hearings were held starting
November 1991 and were complet
ed early this year, according to
Murray. He said he expects the
commission's decision to be hand
ed down sometime in mid-summer.
University officials, however, say
they have data to prove that under
graduates and even graduate stu
dents are not permanent residents.
"Between June of 1991 and July
of 1991, there was a 76 percent
turnover in graduate student hous
ing," said Jan Thomson, director of
communication services. "It is not
like a regular apartment complex."
Thomson and Ann Crowley,

the manager of client services for
Stanford's networking and com
munication services, are con
cerned that if the commission
decides in favor of the students,
rates will go up.
According to Thomson, calls
from student residences, the Uni
versity and Stanford Hospital are
handled though AT&T, Sprint
and MCI. The University is able
to obtain volume discounts and
pass these discounts on to stu
dents, said Thomson.
"The current system is very
volume-oriented," said Thomson.
"If you fragment the calling vol
ume, costs will go up."
One of the critical debates in
the complaint is the issue of Uni
versal Lifeline Telephone Service
(ULTS). Under California law,
telephone companies must pro
vide low-cost telephone service to
low-income families, insuring
that all people have access to such
services as 911.
The students allege that Pacific
Bell had been charging most Stan
ford students the ULTS rates,
which are substantially lower than
regular basic rates. For example,
standard Pacific Bell basic service
costs $13.60 a month, while ULTS
customers are charged only $2.50,
according to Stein.
If this is true, the rates the
University are charging are sub
stantially higher than what stu

dents were paying before. Stein
said that Pacific Bell stipulated in
a January 1992 pre-hearing con
ference that they were providing
ULTS to approximately 8,500
students at the time the Universi
ty took over service.
Although Pacific Bell and the
University admit they have not
been able to provide accurate data
on the number of ULTS users,
they deny these accusations.
Crowley said students who had
been receiving the ULTS were
offered the option of being
"grandfathered" in the Universi
ty system when Stanford first
took over. Only 65 students took
advantage of the offer.
"That's some reflection of the
number of students," said Thom
son. "It was not 8,500 students."
But the complainants argue
that students should have the
ability to choose their own long
distance companies and subscribe
to such discounts as Friends and
Family, Reach Out America and
Reach Out World.
"Normally, when you hook up
a telephone, you are asked to
choose an interstate [long-dis
tance] carrier," sa'd Stein. "At
Stanford, you can't do that."
Stein pointed out that other spe
cial offers, such as accruing bonus
mileage for airline frequent flyer
programs by using certain long-dis
tance carriers, are now inaccessible.
