## Malone shoots from the desk 
### 
Bud Geracie, this one's for you.
J n the wake of the weekend . ..
• I doubt too many people are losing sleep over
the impending cancellation of the Stanley Cup play
offs.
• The baseball team dropped completely out of
Collegiate Baseball's Top 25 poll after being swept by
California last weekend. But we were No. 12 last
week. Go figure.
• Rachel Hemmer made as great a turnaround
after the Virginia game as Christian Laettner did
against Michigan, and she's only a freshman.
• Speaking of frosh, how 'bout Kate Paye's play?
Not bad for a walk-on.

• After Bev Oden's performance for the U.S.
National volleyball team against China last Saturday,
you can just hand her the 1992 Player-of-the-Year
award now.
• Do the women play Tennessee again next year?
• Better Laettner than never, I guess.
• OK, OK, the Warriors will get by Seattle in the
first round. But does anyone really think that they
can go very far without a real center?
• If I hear "Like a Rock" in that truck commercial
one more time...
• And people called this a rebuilding year for
Tara VanDerveer.
• Let me get this straight: the NHL strike is
about.. . playing cards?
• I guess Bobby Hurley whined enough to final
ly get the MVP award. Never mind that Michigan
never could stop Grant Hill.
• A reason to smile: spring football with Bill
Walsh! Watch for Glyn Milburn to thrive in
Walsh's open-it-up style offense.
• The hint of the week: another Stanford squad
to watch in the next few weeks is the track and field
team. They are good and getting better.
• What happened to the Pac-10 men in the tour
nament?

• The Here's-Mud-In-Your-Eye
Department: Laxmi Poruri, the
No. 2 singles player for the Stan
ford women's tennis team, was
ranked 62nd in the nation in the
Volvo Tennis/Collegiate Rankings
preseason poll. As of April 7, she is
now ranked fifth.
• Heather and Heidi who?
• Losing may be good. The
men's volleyball team dropped its
second match to Long Beach
State this year, but Long Beach

lost to USC three times last year
before finally beating the Trojans
in the NCAA finals. Think about
that, Brent Hilliard.
• Player-of-the-Year Awards:
Dawn Staley 2, Molly Goodenbour
0. National Championship rings:
Goodenbour 2, Staley 0.
• Trojans, Schmojans. Coach
Gould knows who'll be on top at the
end, and it won't be the Men of
Troy.
• An article in the LA. Times
last Saturday discussing the Vir
ginia women's basketball team
said, "Gone are the days when
guard Tammi Reiss would have to
ask the coach to pull the Burge

twins off the court because they
whined so much." Someone spoke
too soon.
• Another article in the Sunday
Times was on Stanford football.
The name Walsh does carry a lot of
weight in the press.
• Let's hope that Adam Keefe
gets drafted by a team that is going
up. Let's hope the Minnesota Tim
berwolves take someone else.
• The Giants' magic number is
160.
• Three championships down,
four to go!
