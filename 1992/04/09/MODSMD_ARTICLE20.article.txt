## Malone shoots from the desk 
### 
Bud Geracie, this one's for you.
J n the wake of the weekend . ..
• I doubt too many people are losing sleep over
the impending cancellation of the Stanley Cup play
offs.
• The baseball team dropped completely out of
Collegiate Baseball's Top 25 poll after being swept by
California last weekend. But we were No. 12 last
week. Go figure.
• Rachel Hemmer made as great a turnaround
after the Virginia game as Christian Laettner did
against Michigan, and she's only a freshman.
• Speaking of frosh, how 'bout Kate Paye's play?
Not bad for a walk-on.

• After Bev Oden's performance for the U.S.
National volleyball team against China last Saturday,
you can just hand her the 1992 Player-of-the-Year
award now.
• Do the women play Tennessee again next year?
• Better Laettner than never, I guess.
• OK, OK, the Warriors will get by Seattle in the
first round. But does anyone really think that they
can go very far without a real center?
• If I hear "Like a Rock" in that truck commercial
one more time...
• And people called this a rebuilding year for
Tara VanDerveer.
• Let me get this straight: the NHL strike is
about.. . playing cards?
• I guess Bobby Hurley whined enough to final
ly get the MVP award. Never mind that Michigan
never could stop Grant Hill.
• A reason to smile: spring football with Bill
Walsh! Watch for Glyn Milburn to thrive in
Walsh's open-it-up style offense.
• The hint of the week: another Stanford squad
to watch in the next few weeks is the track and field
team. They are good and getting better.
• What happened to the Pac-10 men in the tour
nament?
