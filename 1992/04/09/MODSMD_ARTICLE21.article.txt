# Confidence is Johnson's key ingredient
## Senior sheds 'dark horse' label 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Throughout her Stanford
career, labels have stuck to Kylie
Johnson. As a relatively unher
alded tennis recruit from Salt
Lake City, she was "that kid
from Utah." When Johnson told
people where she was from,
"they'd pull back, consider it for
a moment and ask, 'Do you ski?'
or 'Are you Mormon?,' " said the
senior.
When the focus turned to her
tennis game, critics were skepti
cal about Johnson's ability to
contribute to the Cardinal.
"When I came here as a fresh
man, (coach) Frank (Brennan)
called me a dark horse and it
stuck," Johnson said. "Few peo
ple had heard of me and here I

was starting (at No. 6). Nobody
expected it."
She is finally shedding the
dark horse image. The co-captain
of the women's tennis team is 14-
4 and has been hovering around
the singles top 25 this season.
She and partner Emma Wood
house are a fixture in the doubles
top 15.
"Her biggest contribution in the
past four years was her ability to
take her tennis up a notch this
year, when we needed it most,"
Brennan said. "I bet $20,000 a year
on her and it's paid off really nice
ly."
Both Johnson and Brennan
credit a different mental attitude
for the improvement. "My biggest
weakness is my head," Johnson
