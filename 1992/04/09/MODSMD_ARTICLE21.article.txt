# Confidence is Johnson's key ingredient
## Senior sheds 'dark horse' label 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Throughout her Stanford
career, labels have stuck to Kylie
Johnson. As a relatively unher
alded tennis recruit from Salt
Lake City, she was "that kid
from Utah." When Johnson told
people where she was from,
"they'd pull back, consider it for
a moment and ask, 'Do you ski?'
or 'Are you Mormon?,' " said the
senior.
When the focus turned to her
tennis game, critics were skepti
cal about Johnson's ability to
contribute to the Cardinal.
"When I came here as a fresh
man, (coach) Frank (Brennan)
called me a dark horse and it
stuck," Johnson said. "Few peo
ple had heard of me and here I

was starting (at No. 6). Nobody
expected it."
She is finally shedding the
dark horse image. The co-captain
of the women's tennis team is 14-
4 and has been hovering around
the singles top 25 this season.
She and partner Emma Wood
house are a fixture in the doubles
top 15.
"Her biggest contribution in the
past four years was her ability to
take her tennis up a notch this
year, when we needed it most,"
Brennan said. "I bet $20,000 a year
on her and it's paid off really nice
ly."
Both Johnson and Brennan
credit a different mental attitude
for the improvement. "My biggest
weakness is my head," Johnson

said. "I'm starting to believe in
myself and expect myself to win
over players I had previously only
expected to get a good score against.
Now I'm thinking 'Bullshit good
score, I can win.'"
Also, Johnson has made strides
in focusing on the present. "Emo
tionally, she's gotten so much
more consistent. She's not think
ing ahead so much," Brennan
said.
By concentrating on the team
aspect of tennis, Johnson has
taken pressure off herself. As co
captain with Heather Willens, she
is responsible for keeping the lines
of communication open between
the younger players and Brennan,
as well as providing guidance and
a few other important details.
"We decide what color to wear,"
Johnson said with a laugh. Often,
this process is anything but
smooth. We'll say white shirt and
guaranteed two people will show
up in red."
Though she jokes about the
team's lack of color coordination,
Johnson takes her role seriously.
She believes a team bond is crucial
to winning tough matches so she
does what she can to develop that
chemistry, down to the last detail.
"Kylie's a very sensitive girl.
She's always thinking of other peo
ple," Brennan said. "She's the one
to get the birthday card for this one
or say the right thing to someone
who's really down in the dumps."
Early this year Johnson deco
rated cups for every player. She
painted tennis racquets on them,
labelling them with each person's
nickname. Her only problem was,
"The damn things scratched off
the first day I handed them out."
Instead of scrapping the idea,
Johnson tried again with different
markers. Same result. "So I decid
ed to coat them with fingernail
polish. Well, the minute the fin
gernail polish touches the paint, it
dissolves and smears it." Finally
she tried acrylic spray, about 15
coats of it, on the cups. "And they
still scratch off] ' said an exasper
ated Johnson.
It is with that same dogged
determination that she approach

es her game. That characteristic
plus discipline has helped her bat
tle her way into the lineup the
past two years.
As a freshman she racked up a
23-2 record while gaining a repu
tation as a "a good competitor who
can pull the upset." The rep was
accurate at the NCAA Champi
onships where Johnson beat
UCLA's Kirsten Dreyer, a former
top 10 player.
In her sophomore season, a
freshman named Heather Willens
forced Johnson from the starting
lineup. She competed in Europe in
the summer after her sophomore
year and played well. Then disas
ter struck as she broke her leg in
two places near the ankle.
"After I got my cast off, I went
to the training room and said, 'Hi
guys, I'm going to be getting my
ankle better so I can play this sea
son.' They just looked at me and
said, 'Don't get your hopes up.
Aim for next season,"' Johnson
said.
Not only did she return to her
starting slot at No. 6, but she
clinched the national title for the
Cardinal on her home court by
beating UCLA's Cammie Foley in
a tight three-setter.
"The whole team was sitting on
the sideline and 3,000 people were
watching while I played her. Cam
mie and I were just looking at each
other and trying to walk back and
do the next point. The entire team
is saying 'Hit to her forehand, her
forehand!' and I'm going, 'I'm try
ing, I'm trying!' " Johnson said.
Finally she knocked off a volley at
match point to clinch Stanford's
sixth-straight NCAA title.
"Even more than winning the
last point, it was the entire team
sitting on the sideline, cheering
me on," she said. "When I won, I
jumped into the air and looked
over. The whole team was run
ning at me. I felt this shock of fear
and thought, 'Oh my God! Be
careful of my ankle!"'
Although her ankle isn't both
ering her this season, Johnson has
had to cope with compressed discs
in her back. "[The injuries] have
helped her, taught her how much
time and hard work there is in
coining back. She is ready, willing
and able to do whatever it takes to
get her in the best possible shape
for the team. She is very disci

plined," Brennan said.
A prime example of her grit was
the March 7 match with Maggie
Simkova. Despite excruciating
back pain, Johnson refused to
default and gutted out a three-set
victory.
"There's some bloody Aus
tralian saying that goes, 'If you're
injured, don't go on the court. But
once you're on the court, you're
not injured.' That's always been
my attitude," she said.
Another recent contest show
cased Johnson's mental improve
ment. A week ago Johnson played
Paige Yaroshuk, a Bruin fresh
man. "[Yaroshuk] was yelling and
screaming and really obnoxious.
That would have thrown almost
everybody but Kylie, who just
didn't even acknowledge her exis
tence in the world," Brennan said.
"Kylie played the ball, focused
completely on the match and
methodically mowed her down.
Everyone else would have wanted
to climb over the net and strangle
this girl but Kylie played it per
fectly," Kylie added.
"I kept telling her this was what
being a senior was about. Kylie
was just like, 'I've seen your act
before. I'll be through with you in
about an hour and you can go back
to the shrink,"' Brennan said.
Johnson is quick to give credit
to others. "[Asst. coach Lele
Foroodl has been a great support.
You could be playing the worst
match of your life and she'll come
out and tell you to calm down and
just get the ball back. She keeps
things simple," the senior said.
Although Johnson wants to do
well in the individual NCAA tour
nament, her primary , goal is
another team title. "Oh, God. This
year is huge. I want the NCAA's so
badly," she said.
And after the national champi
onships Johnson plans to turn
pro. "There's nothing to lose. I
don't want to be in school. I don't
want to have a job. I love to travel
and play tennis," she said.
"There's no reason, with a lot of
hard work, I can't at least pay my
way around the world for a few
years."
But will she ever shed the
labels? Maybe "that dark horse
kid from Utah who can pull the
upset" should be erased in favor of
one word. Winner.
