# Blackman nears end of Cardinal career
## 
### Laurie Wackier Staff writer 
If you ask someone who grew
up on the beach about their child
hood, chances are you'd hear nos
talgic stories about sand castles,
swimming, and starfish. Ask
senior Duncan Blackman though,
and he'll tell you about volleyball.
A standout for the Cardinal
spikers, the native of Santa Moni
ca was indoctrinated into the
sport at an age when most of his
peers were still busy playing Can
dyland and taking naps.
"I've got photos of me rallying
the volleyball back when I was
very little. Probably around four
or five years old," Blackman remi
nisced. He has thrived on the
sport ever since.
Of course, there was that two
year intermission when the family
moved to Paris. Blackman was
seven, and he decided to try his luck

at a more European sport. "I played
a lot of soccer over there, but I
wasn't exactly a Pele or anything."
The kid from the beach decided
to stick to volleyball. "When you're
that age and you're better than the
average guy at a sport, you tend to
stick with it," Blackman explains.
"So I pretty much took volleyball
under my wing."
The outside hitter has proved
that he is definitely better than
the average guy. In his tenure on
the farm, Blackman has menaced
opponents with his tenacious
jump serve, a talent that has
earned him top honors in the Car
dinal record books for all-time
service aces.
Furthermore, Blackman ranks
fourth on the all-time kills list, an
especially impressive stat, consider
ing his role as a hitter. "Duncan ends
up having a big hitting load from the
left side, off bad passes," head coach
Ruben Nieves remarked.

"That's one of the most diffi
cult situations in volleyball to
score kills, because the blockers
have plenty of time to set up, and
everyone in the gym knows where
the set will go."
Blackman also plays a vital
defensive role on the squad. In
addition to being fourth all-time in
career blocks, his passing game is a
key element to the Card spikers.
According to Nieves, Blackman
receives approximately half of
opponents' serves. "Duncan's role
on our team is to pass, which is,
without a doubt, the most impor
tant role in volleyball," Nieves said.
"The best teams are the ones with
the best passing." Judging from
Stanford's No. 2 ranking, Black
man has filled that role pretty well.
When he came to Stanford
three years ago, Blackman already
had a reputation at the collegiate
level. Starting as a true freshman,
he was widely known as the

younger brother of Parker Black
man, a setter for the Cardinal.
An All-American, Parker tops
the Stanford record lists for career
assists. In addition, he was second
in career service aces. Second, that
is, until younger brother Duncan
moved into the top spot, and
bumped Parker down to third.
While he may have played in
the shadow for his first two years,
Blackman has moved into the
spotlight with his own dynamic
form of leadership.
"Parker is a strong personali
ty, and has gone so far with his
physical Duncan has had
to follow in those footsteps,"
Nieves commented. "He did a
good job while Parker was here,
and has done really well since he
graduated. He's especially devel
oped his leadership skills."
Nieves characterizes Blackman
as a fiery player who, while not vocal
like his brother, leads by example.
"Consistency in effort in practice on
a daily basis is somewhere we really
wanted to improve as a team, and
Duncan led the way," Nieves said.
But Blackman is quick to play
down his role as a leader, insisting
that leadership is shared on the
team. "I may have a little more game
experience, but the guys don't neces
sarily look to me as 'the senior'."
"I don't consider myself the focal
point of the team, at all. It kind of
switches around," he added.
That team dynamic manifests
itself in crucial situations on the
court. After watching bickering
among the Penn State team in a
spring break match, Blackman real
ized the level of maturity the Cardi
nal had attained since last season.
"It's a good quality to be a great
team when you're winning, but its
an even better quality to be a
strong team when you're losing."
"The game isn't over until you
score that 15th point, and it's real
ly important to maintain that con
sistency as a team," said the
senior. This season, the spikers
have been able to demonstrate the
consistency to which Blackman
refers. Stanford has been able to
pull off several come-from-behind
victories against highly ranked
schools this season, most notably,
an early-season upset at UCLA.
International experience in the
summer helped Blackman gain
some of the maturity and experi
ence that has contributed to this
season's successes. A member of

ing his role as a hitter. "Duncan ends
up having a big hitting load from the
left side, off bad passes," head coach
Ruben Nieves remarked.

"That's one of the most diffi
cult situations in volleyball to
score kills, because the blockers
have plenty of time to set up, and
everyone in the gym knows where
the set will go."
Blackman also plays a vital
defensive role on the squad. In
addition to being fourth all-time in
career blocks, his passing game is a
key element to the Card spikers.
According to Nieves, Blackman
receives approximately half of
opponents' serves. "Duncan's role
on our team is to pass, which is,
without a doubt, the most impor
tant role in volleyball," Nieves said.
"The best teams are the ones with
the best passing." Judging from
Stanford's No. 2 ranking, Black
man has filled that role pretty well.
When he came to Stanford
three years ago, Blackman already
had a reputation at the collegiate
level. Starting as a true freshman,
he was widely known as the

younger brother of Parker Black
man, a setter for the Cardinal.
An All-American, Parker tops
the Stanford record lists for career
assists. In addition, he was second
in career service aces. Second, that
is, until younger brother Duncan
moved into the top spot, and
bumped Parker down to third.
While he may have played in
the shadow for his first two years,
Blackman has moved into the
spotlight with his own dynamic
form of leadership.
"Parker is a strong personali
ty, and has gone so far with his
physical Duncan has had
to follow in those footsteps,"
Nieves commented. "He did a
good job while Parker was here,
and has done really well since he
graduated. He's especially devel
oped his leadership skills."
Nieves characterizes Blackman
as a fiery player who, while not vocal
like his brother, leads by example.
"Consistency in effort in practice on
a daily basis is somewhere we really
wanted to improve as a team, and
Duncan led the way," Nieves said.
But Blackman is quick to play
down his role as a leader, insisting
that leadership is shared on the
team. "I may have a little more game
experience, but the guys don't neces
sarily look to me as 'the senior'."
"I don't consider myself the focal
point of the team, at all. It kind of
switches around," he added.
That team dynamic manifests
itself in crucial situations on the
court. After watching bickering
among the Penn State team in a
spring break match, Blackman real
ized the level of maturity the Cardi
nal had attained since last season.
"It's a good quality to be a great
team when you're winning, but its
an even better quality to be a
strong team when you're losing."
"The game isn't over until you
score that 15th point, and it's real
ly important to maintain that con
sistency as a team," said the
senior. This season, the spikers
have been able to demonstrate the
consistency to which Blackman
refers. Stanford has been able to
pull off several come-from-behind
victories against highly ranked
schools this season, most notably,
an early-season upset at UCLA.
International experience in the
summer helped Blackman gain
some of the maturity and experi
ence that has contributed to this
season's successes. A member of

last home matches this weekend.

the Pan Am Games last summer.
With the Olympics around the

corner, Blackman has no doubt
about his goals: "I'm willing to
spend three years training. My
hopes are set on the '96 Olympics."
But for now, his hopes are set
on the NCAA Final Four. Success
at the Western Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association Tourna

ment next weekend will be the
key to realizing that goal.
Blackman will play in his final
home matches this weekend,
when UC-Santa Barbara and Loy

Friday and Saturday. Both
matches begin at 7:00 p.m.
If you ask someone who grew
up on the beach about their child
hood, chances are you'd hear nos
talgic stories about sand castles,
swimming, and starfish. Ask
senior Duncan Blackman though,
and he'll tell you about volleyball.
A standout for the Cardinal
spikers, the native of Santa Moni
ca was indoctrinated into the
sport at an age when most of his
peers were still busy playing Can
dyland and taking naps.
"I've got photos of me rallying
the volleyball back when I was
very little. Probably around four
or five years old," Blackman remi
nisced. He has thrived on the
sport ever since.
Of course, there was that two
year intermission when the family
moved to Paris. Blackman was
seven, and he decided to try his luck

at a more European sport. "I played
a lot of soccer over there, but I
wasn't exactly a Pele or anything."
The kid from the beach decided
to stick to volleyball. "When you're
that age and you're better than the
average guy at a sport, you tend to
stick with it," Blackman explains.
"So I pretty much took volleyball
under my wing."
The outside hitter has proved
that he is definitely better than
the average guy. In his tenure on
the farm, Blackman has menaced
opponents with his tenacious
jump serve, a talent that has
earned him top honors in the Car
dinal record books for all-time
service aces.
Furthermore, Blackman ranks
fourth on the all-time kills list, an
especially impressive stat, consider
ing his role as a hitter. "Duncan ends
up having a big hitting load from the
