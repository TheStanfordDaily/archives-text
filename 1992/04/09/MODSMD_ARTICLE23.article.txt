# Men place fourth in USC tourney
## 
### Andy Eiser Staff Writer 
What a difference a week
makes.
Last week, the Stanford Car
dinal men's golf team was com
ing off of a rusty 13th-place finish
in a tournament for which they
had had little time to practice.
Now, the Cardinal has some
thing to boast about — a fourth
place finish, by far its highest of
1992, in USC's Southwestern
Intercollegiate Invitational at
Westlake Village, California, on
Monday and Tuesday. Stan
ford's four-man 54-hole total of
881 placed the squad just ten
strokes behind Arkansas' win
ning score of 871, six back of
Oregon's 875, and five shots off
the pace of San Jose State's
third-place 876.
Once again, however, a slow
start pi evented the Cardinal
from placing as high as it would
have liked. The team's first
round total of 301, 13 strokes
over par, nearly put it out of con
tention until an even-par 288 and
a four-over 292 in the second and
third rounds, respectively, put
Stanford on the leader board.
Head coach Wally Goodwin
was happy about his squad's
performance, but was at a loss
to explain its slow start. "We
still have anxieties about the
first round," he said after
returning home Tuesday night.
One Cardinal golfer who did
not have a problem with any of
the three rounds was sophomore
Notah Begay, whose 73-73-71
was good for the team lead, a one
over-par 217, and a sixth-place
tie in the individual standings.

"It's good to know that
when I'm not at my best, I can
still help the team," Begay said
with more than a hint of
understatement.
Goodwin was considerably
more generous in his assess
ment of Begay's game. "He's
probably the best putter I've
seen in all the golf I've watched
and played," the coach said.
Sophomore Casey Martin
finished three strokes back of
the team leader for the Cardi
nal, in an llth-place tie at 76-
71-73—220; Begay feels that
Martin's game will continue to
improve down the homestretch
of the season.
"Casey knows when to pick
up the pace in the spring,"
Begay said.
Placing a strong third
among Stanford golfers was
junior Brad Lanning, who fin
ished in an overall 17th-place
tie at 222. Lanning, who missed
the Cardinal's entire fall sched
ule with an ankle injury,
showed that he has fully recov
ered by carding the team's low
est first-round score, a 72.
"I feel fresh. This is a lot of
fun," said Lanning of his perfor
mance. "You have to have the
mental toughness and buckle
down.. .and as a team we're really
close to playing to our potential."
Indeed, the feeling that the
Cardinal golfers are beginning
to unify and play better in time
for the late regular season and
all-important postseason starts
with the top golfer himself.
"In order to move up to the
next level — and we're almost
there — we need to have every
thing kick in," Begay said.
