# Ruggers capture Gaucho Invite

Stanford Rugby traveled south
last weekend for the annual Santa
Barbara rugby tournament.
Because Stanford was eliminated
from post-conference play, the
Cardinal traveled with a mission,
hoping to prove that they are as
good or better than many teams
that will compete in the Pacific
Coast Conference playoffs next
weekend.
"We wanted to demonstrate to
all of the Pacific Coast that we
should be in the playoffs," said
captain John Hamilton. Stanford
did just that and more, capturing
the collegiate division champi
onship at Santa Barbara.
The Card's road to victory
began with a roasting of both its
opening round opponents â€” Clair
mont College and UC-Santa Bar
bara's second side. "That game
was the most fun I've had all
year," stated prop/flanker Dan
Byers after the Card crushed the
Gauchos, 40-0.

In the quarterfinals, the level of
difficulty increased substantially as
the Cardinal met the tournament
favorite and the number one team
in the southern division, Cal Poly-
San Louis Obispo. In a hard-hit
ting battle the Card ruggers proved
too powerful and too skilled for Cal
Poly as they won 7-0. "The game
against Cal Poly is what rugby is all
about. We played like gods," said
Stanford coach Franck Boivert.
In a relatively uninteresting
semifinal game against the 49ers
of Long Beach State, Stanford
continued to pound and pressure.
Stanford lead 3-0 until the final
minute of the game when Long
Beach State converted a drop goal
to tie the score at 3-3. However,
the 49ers' big gun turned out to
be their downfall as they lost to
the Card in a drop goal shootout,
2-0.
All that remained between
Stanford and the tournament
title were the host Gauchos of
Santa Barbara. Aided by home
field advantage and an intense

team, the Gauchos looked as if
they could halt the Cardinal's run
for a title. But the Card made
quick work of the Gauchos, win
ning easily, 31-7.
"This tournament was a great
victory for Stanford rugby. We
showed how good we are," stated
flanker Jason Bucha. Statistics
support Bucha's statement; the
Cardinal outscored its opponents
105-10, and allowed only one try to
be scored the entire tournament.
The Cardinal offense was quick
and devastating, while the defense
was seemingly impenetrable. Stan
ford had not played with this kind
of control and panache all year.
"You know why we won this
tournament? Not because we all
finally clicked and everything went
our way. We won because we were
all hungry to show what we could
do. We won on the back of a great
team effort," said back row Ed
Stevens.
"This is a great accomplish
ment for Stanford rugby," said
Boivert.
