# Women's lax hosts Western States
## 
### Luke Winter Staff Writer 
The East Coast no longer has a monopoly on
women's lacrosse. Now, Stanford students can
watch the game without leaving the sanctuary of
palm trees, as the Western States Women's Lacrosse
Tournament comes to the Farm this weekend.
While lacrosse in general has attained much
greater levels of popularity in the East, women's
lacrosse in California is rapidly developing into a
top-rate sport, as collegiate and club teams in the
Golden State attract more experienced eastern play
ers and coaches. Stanford coach Julia Duff agreed
with the assessment, saying, "The level of play (in
California) is rising. Women's lacrosse has become
much less informal and much more competitive."

This weekend, the Cardinal's own women's squad
will be severly tested. UC-Santa Barbara, the top
draw in the Western States Tournament, is current
ly No.l in the Western Women's Lacrosse Associa
tion (WWLA) and Stanford, with a 3-1 record, is
looking to replace them at the top. Duff, however,
remained optimistic in her outlook. "I have a lot of
confidence in this team," said the coach. "We have a
lot of ability and depth."
The Cardinal will face the top-ranked Gauchos
tomorrow at 4:15 p.m. at Roble Field. A victory
against Santa Barbara would give Stanford sole pos
session of first place in the WWLA. The tournament
itself, hosting 31 teams, will run all weekend, with
games on Saturday and Sunday taking place at the
intramural fields. The tourney final is scheduled for
Sunday at 2:00 p.m. at the I.M. fields.
