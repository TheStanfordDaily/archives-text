Not to Have a COP"; and Joel
Stein, a Students First slate

helping graduate students.

"Special fees that go mainly to
undergraduates should be largely
paid by undergraduates," Brown
said.
Stein said Students First also
would be responsive to graduate

According to Stein, the School
of Humanities and Sciences is
considering cutting back the sum
mer stipends graduate students
receive during summer quarters,
and Students First would work to
maintain graduate funding at its
current level, Stein said.

racy" — choosing COP members
randomly from the student body to
serve one day terms — said his
slate provided the best opportunity
to address graduate concerns.
"There are more graduate stu
dents than undergraduates," he
