# COP campaign kicks off as candidates hit the airwaves

### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Launching this year's cam
paign for the ASSU Council of
Presidents, members of the com
peting slates appeared on KZSU
radio's program "Talk Back" last
night.
The candidates spent much of
the program rehashing their plat
forms, but topics explored more
fully included graduate student
representation and the role of
public service in student govern
ment.
Slate members in the one-hour
broadcast included Ron Brown, a
member of "Independents: A New
Era"; David Hyatt, a member of
the Hammer and Coffin party's
"YOU!"; Ed Mun from"I Prefer
Not to Have a COP"; and Joel
Stein, a Students First slate
member.
The ASSU election will be held
next Wednesday and Thursday.
Brown said the Independents
slate is committed to graduate
students, and, if elected, would
work to reform the ASSU fee sys
tem to direct money into projects
helping graduate students.

"Special fees that go mainly to
undergraduates should be largely
paid by undergraduates," Brown
said.
Stein said Students First also
would be responsive to graduate
student concerns.
According to Stein, the School
of Humanities and Sciences is
considering cutting back the sum
mer stipends graduate students
receive during summer quarters,
and Students First would work to
maintain graduate funding at its
current level, Stein said.
But Hyatt, whose YOU! slate is
running on a system of "randomoc
racy" — choosing COP members
randomly from the student body to
serve one day terms — said his
slate provided the best opportunity
to address graduate concerns.
"There are more graduate stu
dents than undergraduates," he

said. "If you know your math,
more graduate students will be on
the COP."
Another issue debated by slate
members was public service.
Brown, whose slate's platform
stresses the importance of ser
vice, said he saw it as "the one
thing that can bring Stanford stu
dents together."
He said his slate would bring
together campus groups that don't
normally work with each other —
like the Interfraternity Council
and MEChA, a Chicano/Latino
student group — to do community
service projects. Independents
would work with the Haas Center
for Public Service to carry out
these goals, Brown said.
But Stein, from Students First,
said the Independents plan would

have the ASSU "taking over Haas'
role," adding that the student gov
ernment should serve the stu
dents, not the outside community.
Stein said Students First is
planning to bring students
together through activities such
as a campus-wide treasure hunt.
He also suggested installing
emergency phones around cam
pus to improve safety.
Mun, whose slate promises to
dismantle the COP if they win the
election, said he was unimpressed
by the other candidates' pledges
because the COP does not have
the power to effect change.
"It's the same thing every
year. They (COP candidates)
come in with the same ideas.
Despite all the effort they put into
it, there are no results."
Mun's slate proposes giving
their duties to groups of ASSU
senators and using the COP's
$16,000 salary to fund student
groups.
