# Tents, skits, bids, parties: Sorority Rush underway this week
## 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
Freshman Susan Milam made the
rounds on Wilbur field earlier this week,
getting acquainted with sorority mem
bers in hopes of receiving a bid from the
group of her choice.
"It was kind of what I expected — a lit
tle bit overwhelming and loud. It's kind
of like Orientation (week] again," Milam
said. She added that Tuesday's party
"wasn't as superficial" as she expected.
Sorority Rush, the annual formal
membership drive for Stanford's seven
recognized Greek women's groups,
kicked off Tuesday night as 284 rushees
came out to the tents set up on the
Wilbur field to attend the first party of
this week-long social event.
"I think the Greek system is primari

ly social, but not necessarily partying,"
said Intersorority Council president
Adriana Duffy, who also stressed the
"friendship and sisterhood" women find
through sororities.
Women paid $15 apiece to register for
the grueling Rush events, which include
"open house" parties, weekend "invita
tiona" and a final "preference party" on
Monday.
Twelve Rush counselors, who have
become temporarily disaffiliated with
their own sororities during the week,
are available to lead the seven groups
around the "open house" tents and to
answer rushees' questions or concerns
about the week's events, including mat
ters of wardrobe.
"We're really working hard to make
sure rushees aren't stressing about their
clothes," said Sheryl Spain, one of the

two ISC Rush chairs. She is encouraging
rushees to forego the traditional dress
code and wear something comfortable to
the events.
Spain said Stanford's Rush "is a lot
more low key" compared to other schools,
where it "seems like a life or death situa
tion." Last year, every woman who com
pleted the process and put in a bid got
accepted into a sorority, she said.
Milam said that although it might be
upsetting if she doesn't get her first choice,
she does not "want to be part of a group
that wouldn't recognize me for who I am."
According to Spain, the short "open
house" parties allow rushees to hobnob,
banter and familiarize themselves with
the unhoused sororities.
Rushees will visit with each sorority
twice by Friday. At the second meeting,
hosting sororities will become slightly

more elaborate, presenting a creative,
usually theme-oriented look at their orga
nizations through skits and slide shows.
By Monday evening the women will
have submitted their top two choices on
a preference card and attend only those
sororities' parties. Spain said these
"preference parties" will allow women to
be "more reflective" about their choices.
On Tuesday, the bids are released.
Rushees are matched with sororities "on
the basis of a rushee's preference,"
Spain said. "Any woman who would like
to join a sorority can join," she added.
While some women may be disappoint
ed by the bid selection, most "generally
end up being pretty happy," said senior
Amy Lightner, one of the Rush coun
selors. She added that their original "dis
appointment can be unfounded" if they
are not well-acquainted with the group.

While most women participate in the
week's activities with plans to pledge,
some women also rush with other inten
tions in mind. Spain said it is a "great
opportunity to shrink the campus."
"I feel like I've met a lot more women
in one night than I've met in two quarters
here," said freshman Molly Valim, who
attended Tuesday night's open house.
Valim said she hopes to pledge "to
have a definite group of people I feel
close to." She said she has not purchased
new clothes, but has borrowed a few
items from friends.
Last week and throughout winter
quarter, the ISC hosted panel discus
sions to address common misconcep
tions about sororities.
Spain emphasized that "one furious,
crazy week of Rush is not what being in
a sorority is all about."
