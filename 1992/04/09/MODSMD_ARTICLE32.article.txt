# INTERMISSION
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY. Live bands cure nightlife blues 
### Paul Curthoys Eric Keppler Staff writers 
Leaning back in your chair, your fingers circle
the hot rim of a caffe latte. On the stage in front of
you, a trio of musicians tease gentle strains from
their instruments, filling the coffee house around
you with warm acoustic blues.
Farther on down the street, someone else swings
from a bar stool, head spinning from too many mar
garitas. A jazz fusion band lays down some back
ground music as a couple smiles flirtatiously at each
other in a dark corner.
Familiar scenes to those who try to milk some
excitement from the snail-paced Palo Alto night life,
right? Music cafes, those local coffee houses or bars
that offer the excitement of live music each week
end, have been thriving in our own backyard for
quite some time.
Almost always, the shows are excellent. The Bay
Area music scene pretty much rips, all the way from
the big names that fill the Warfield to the local
musicians who make the trek down to play the Palo

Alto clubs.
So you don't have to fight Friday night traffic in
the City just to hear some great live music. Just
down the street, the walls are thumping, and that
cup of coffee or a good, stiff drink is waiting.
Coffee and 'esoteric' tunes
Stepping into St. Michael's Brasserie could be
risky if your taste in music runs strictly along con
ventional lines. Depending on the night, you might
encounter anything from jazz to blues to Celtic
music to "Organic Ear Food."
"We're a venue for performers not necessarily in
the mainstream of American culture," explained
Paul Jacobs, who books performances for the coffee
house. "We're part of an alternative folk music
milieu that exists apart from pop. It's esoteric."
And don't just shoot by that tip jar at the door
all of the musicians you'll hear at St. Michael's are
compensated only by the tips they get that night.
Although you might think performers would find

The continued adventures of Will Nulpart, wherein
our hero meets the Queen of Babylon, plucks a Thorn
from his side and soliloquizes about love. This, too, is
vanity.

that discouraging, Jacobs said he
never has trouble booking acts.
Regardless of the musical
fare, St. Michael's is a great
place to while away a mellow
evening with a few friends and a
caffe mocha or a glass of olal
lieberry wine. Yes, it caters to
the quirky at heart.
"Intimate" was how Jacobs
described the shows, and he's
right. The stage is squished up
against the wall and the tables
are packed right up against it, so
it's often hard to find a seat after
9:30 p.m., when the crowd tends
to pick up. So if anything less
than 15-foot speakers and a
screaming, throbbing audience
bores you, go see U2 instead. St.
Michael's is for those who thrive
on a friendly and familiar change
from the routine of pop music.
Guitars and a salad bar
Cafe Montmartre looks sort
of like someone tried to cross a
Fresh Choice with an art muse
um in an office building. A
rather abstract portrait of Albert
Einstein watches over both the
stage where live music is played
every weekend and over an
extensive salad bar. If you are
looking for a smoke-filled,
escape-from-California place to
hang out, this is not it.
No worries, though. A night
spot with a salad bar can still be
hip. There were people sitting at
the tables near the door playing
chess, and they looked like regu
lars — a nice touch, giving the
place the kind of eccentricity that
perhaps you left campus to find.
So despite the beige walls and
suspiciously office building-ish
styrofoam ceiling, there is some
thing kind of cool about Cafe
Montmartre. The place has an
energy that you can't help get
ting caught up in.
A lot of this may have had
something to do with the fact
that the woman who was doing
guitars and vocals for the band
was really attractive. No, seri
ously, the band was really good,
and they'll be playing at Cafe
Montmartre every Friday night
for the next month or so. The

Basic play an enlightened collage
of folk and classic rock covers as
well as some pretty darn good
songs of their own. Definitely
worth checking out.
Cafe Montmartre has good
coffee and the standard assort
ment of $2.50 beers. Tact is
enforced here — you have to pay
three bucks at the door for a $3
coupon that buys you drinks and
desserts. So there will be no sit
ting in the corner and asking for
ice water if you are a scrounge.
A jazzy place for a date
Someone at a nearby table
referred to the Gatehouse as
"the Datehouse," which is prob
ably right on the money. The
combination of a couple of beers
and the dim lighting (atmo
sphere up the wazoo, this place

has), aided by a little jazz, will
make any date you choose to
bring along look fabulous. Or
perhaps more importantly, it
will make you look fabulous to
your date.
The Gatehouse doesn't get
many esoteric points, as the
clientele is tr£s yuppie, and the
average age hovers somewhere
around 25. But you must be used
to that by now, and yuppies
notwithstanding, the decor and
the atmosphere are pretty
classy. It's a very warm, wood
table, Coffee House-esque sort of
a place, with tables tucked away
in corners far enough from the
music to make talking feasible.
Oh yeah, the music. It's jazz
fusion, whatever that is — jazz
fused with rock, fused with
blues, fused with R & B? Last

Saturday night it was jazz fused
with cheese, but in a subtle,
musically talented, tolerable
way. Mood music, you know.
Anyway, the standard weekend
fare is jazz fusion and just plain
jazz as well, and they have some
good acts lined up. Pretty hip.
At 10 p.m. the Gatehouse
"turns into a cabaret." So if you
don't have documentation of
your 21-ness, you will be going
elsewhere. If you've got ID,
though, and you are looking for a
stylish place to spend an evening
with someone away from your
dorm room, the Gatehouse will
do quite nicely.

perhaps more importantly, it
will make you look fabulous to
your date.
The Gatehouse doesn't get
many esoteric points, as the
clientele is tr£s yuppie, and the
average age hovers somewhere
around 25. But you must be used
to that by now, and yuppies
notwithstanding, the decor and
the atmosphere are pretty
classy. It's a very warm, wood
table, Coffee House-esque sort of
a place, with tables tucked away
in corners far enough from the
music to make talking feasible.
Oh yeah, the music. It's jazz
fusion, whatever that is — jazz
fused with rock, fused with
blues, fused with R & B? Last

Saturday night it was jazz fused
with cheese, but in a subtle,
musically talented, tolerable
way. Mood music, you know.
Anyway, the standard weekend
fare is jazz fusion and just plain
jazz as well, and they have some
good acts lined up. Pretty hip.
At 10 p.m. the Gatehouse

with someone away from your
dorm room, the Gatehouse will
do quite nicely.

Blues musician David Hydie jams on the harmonica at St. Michael's Alley last weekend. The coffee
house regularly presents jazz, folk and other styles of music in their nightly shows.
Leaning back in your chair, your fingers circle
the hot rim of a caffe latte. On the stage in front of
you, a trio of musicians tease gentle strains from
their instruments, filling the coffee house around
you with warm acoustic blues.
Farther on down the street, someone else swings
from a bar stool, head spinning from too many mar
garitas. A jazz fusion band lays down some back
ground music as a couple smiles flirtatiously at each
other in a dark corner.
Familiar scenes to those who try to milk some
excitement from the snail-paced Palo Alto night life,
right? Music cafes, those local coffee houses or bars
that offer the excitement of live music each week
end, have been thriving in our own backyard for
quite some time.
Almost always, the shows are excellent. The Bay
Area music scene pretty much rips, all the way from
the big names that fill the Warfield to the local
musicians who make the trek down to play the Palo

Alto clubs.
So you don't have to fight Friday night traffic in
the City just to hear some great live music. Just
down the street, the walls are thumping, and that
cup of coffee or a good, stiff drink is waiting.
Coffee and 'esoteric' tunes
Stepping into St. Michael's Brasserie could be
risky if your taste in music runs strictly along con
ventional lines. Depending on the night, you might
encounter anything from jazz to blues to Celtic
music to "Organic Ear Food."
"We're a venue for performers not necessarily in
the mainstream of American culture," explained
Paul Jacobs, who books performances for the coffee
house. "We're part of an alternative folk music
milieu that exists apart from pop. It's esoteric."
And don't just shoot by that tip jar at the door
all of the musicians you'll hear at St. Michael's are
compensated only by the tips they get that night.
Although you might think performers would find

The continued adventures of Will Nulpart, wherein
our hero meets the Queen of Babylon, plucks a Thorn
from his side and soliloquizes about love. This, too, is
vanity.

that discouraging, Jacobs said he
never has trouble booking acts.
Regardless of the musical
fare, St. Michael's is a great
place to while away a mellow
evening with a few friends and a
caffe mocha or a glass of olal
lieberry wine. Yes, it caters to
the quirky at heart.
"Intimate" was how Jacobs
described the shows, and he's
right. The stage is squished up
against the wall and the tables
are packed right up against it, so
it's often hard to find a seat after
9:30 p.m., when the crowd tends
to pick up. So if anything less
than 15-foot speakers and a
screaming, throbbing audience
bores you, go see U2 instead. St.
Michael's is for those who thrive
on a friendly and familiar change
from the routine of pop music.
Guitars and a salad bar
Cafe Montmartre looks sort
of like someone tried to cross a
Fresh Choice with an art muse
um in an office building. A
rather abstract portrait of Albert
Einstein watches over both the
stage where live music is played
every weekend and over an
extensive salad bar. If you are
looking for a smoke-filled,
escape-from-California place to
hang out, this is not it.
No worries, though. A night
spot with a salad bar can still be
hip. There were people sitting at
the tables near the door playing
chess, and they looked like regu
lars — a nice touch, giving the
place the kind of eccentricity that
perhaps you left campus to find.
So despite the beige walls and
suspiciously office building-ish
styrofoam ceiling, there is some
thing kind of cool about Cafe
Montmartre. The place has an
energy that you can't help get
ting caught up in.
A lot of this may have had
something to do with the fact
that the woman who was doing
guitars and vocals for the band
was really attractive. No, seri
ously, the band was really good,
and they'll be playing at Cafe
Montmartre every Friday night
for the next month or so. The

Basic play an enlightened collage
of folk and classic rock covers as
well as some pretty darn good
songs of their own. Definitely
worth checking out.
Cafe Montmartre has good
coffee and the standard assort
ment of $2.50 beers. Tact is
enforced here — you have to pay
three bucks at the door for a $3
coupon that buys you drinks and
desserts. So there will be no sit
ting in the corner and asking for
ice water if you are a scrounge.
A jazzy place for a date
Someone at a nearby table
referred to the Gatehouse as
"the Datehouse," which is prob
ably right on the money. The
combination of a couple of beers
and the dim lighting (atmo
sphere up the wazoo, this place

has), aided by a little jazz, will
make any date you choose to
bring along look fabulous. Or
perhaps more importantly, it
will make you look fabulous to
your date.
