Leaning back in your chair, your fingers circle
the hot rim of a caffe latte. On the stage in front of
you, a trio of musicians tease gentle strains from

cup of coffee or a good, stiff drink is waiting.

music to "Organic Ear Food."
"We're a venue for performers not necessarily in
the mainstream of American culture," explained
Paul Jacobs, who books performances for the coffee
house. "We're part of an alternative folk music
milieu that exists apart from pop. It's esoteric."
And don't just shoot by that tip jar at the door
all of the musicians you'll hear at St. Michael's are
compensated only by the tips they get that night.
Although you might think performers would find

our hero meets the Queen of Babylon, plucks a Thorn
from his side and soliloquizes about love. This, too, is
vanity.
