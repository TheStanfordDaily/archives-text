# 'Blessed are the poor in spirit...'

Editor's note: This is the second install
ment of a short story appearing in Inter
mission.

I needed to get away from school for a
while, even for just a day. So I took off with
Petronius and Fellini to Babylon, the
amusement park.
We were standing in line to get on "The
Edge," that joyride where you sit in a cabin
and drop a few hundred feet hoping your
heart and your genitals stay intact, when I
found myself staring at this anorexic lady
with three kids: a boy, a girl and a baby (sex
uncertain to me) sucking the life from her
breast.
She was wearing a thin, flowery dress,
faded from wear and smeared with candy
she had bought her children. She was

young, must have had her kids before fin
ishing high school, and the three different
fathers must occasionally have sent her
money so that on a day like that day she
could leave her mother's house and make
the kids forget that they had no one father
and that they didn't have enough clothes or
enough food and an uncertain future.
But the kids were experiencing one of
those bright, sunny, brief memories that
they would take refuge in when adults.
