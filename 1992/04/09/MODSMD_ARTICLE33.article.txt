Editor's note: This is the second install
ment of a short story appearing in Inter
mission.

I needed to get away from school for a
while, even for just a day. So I took off with
Petronius and Fellini to Babylon, the
amusement park.
We were standing in line to get on "The
Edge," that joyride where you sit in a cabin
and drop a few hundred feet hoping your
heart and your genitals stay intact, when I
found myself staring at this anorexic lady
with three kids: a boy, a girl and a baby (sex
uncertain to me) sucking the life from her
breast.
She was wearing a thin, flowery dress,
faded from wear and smeared with candy
she had bought her children. She was

young, must have had her kids before fin
ishing high school, and the three different
fathers must occasionally have sent her
money so that on a day like that day she
could leave her mother's house and make
the kids forget that they had no one father
and that they didn't have enough clothes or
enough food and an uncertain future.
But the kids were experiencing one of
those bright, sunny, brief memories that
they would take refuge in when adults.

The little boy had an ice cream
cone the little girl wanted. She
snatched it out of his hand and
pushed him to the ground. He got
up and tried to take it back, but
the cone fell to the ground, and
the little girl stepped on it. They
pulled each other's hair,
scratched each other's face and
kicked each other's shins.
The mother, who had been
looking around distractedly while
this was going on, quickly caught
on. Her sullen and otherwise ane
mic face bloated up like a red bal
loon, and she reached out with
her long bony hand and slapped
both kids across the face.
Her angry face was ugly, the
kids' blubbering faces were ugly,
and now even the otherwise
adorable baby was ugly with cry
ing too.
I looked away but every other
person I saw around me was ugly
too — their clothes, body shapes,
facial features — and there were
so many of them, so many fucking
more of them that I couldn't see,
much less imagine: the cesspool of
humanity.
They knew I thought they were
ugly because I was ugly to them. I
tried to stop myself, but their
voices and faces crammed into my
head and I had to scream and
scream with all my existence to
push them out.
My friends broke out laughing,
suggesting I wait until I got on
the ride first.
But I started babbling about
how there were so many people
and that nothing made us unique
because we were all equally ugly
and limited by the deformities we
call our bodies and that our spir
its, if we had any, must free them
selves from such horrid captivity.
(Limitation: the spirit being cap
tive to the body.)

Petronius arid Fellini thought I
was wigging out and maybe I was.
So they took me back to my apart
ment. That was the last I saw of
them because even friendship has
its limitations and temporality.
I needed someone to confide in,
someone I could trust, someone
with the angelic capacity to
soothe my tormented soul. I
arranged to meet with my girl-

Petronius and
Fellini thought I
was wigging out
and maybe I was.

friend, Violet Thorn.
We met at the local art muse
um, Art Is Us, because she had
some paintings that were being
displayed.
They were paintings of fruits
and human models and buildings
and such, but the truth was I
didn't know much about art
except that it asked too much of
me.
I was about to suggest we leave
when I caught a glimpse of her
last painting.
"What does it mean?" I asked
Violet.
"It's just a couple, that's all.
The perfect couple you could say
meeting by the fountain in the
moonlight behind the ballroom
away from everyone else, that's
all," she said.
She bit her lower, lusciously
red lip and blinked her long lash
es to draw attention to her sap
phire eyes. She stood perfectly
still in her long, tight, noire dress
with lace fringes — just like a por
trait, and like one, she had no real
life of her own.
But the painting existed never
theless, and so did she. They
would both age nevertheless, and
the fresh paint would later dry

and crack, falling off piece by
piece.
"I mean what does it really
mean, especially that backdrop?"
I asked.
"Night time," she said, "that's
all."
"Don't enemies, nightmares or
fears lurk in that obscure pulp,
just waiting to devour that pale
moonlight, that urine-colored
water spewing from that cold,
stone fountain and most of all
those masquerading fools by it?"
I grabbed her by the shoulders
and tried to shake out an answer
but then embraced her, never
wanting to let go.
She pulled away and said,
"Look, I don't know what's going
in your life, Will, but you sure as
hell are spooking me out. You ask
me to meet with you because
you've got some kind of problem;
then you show up here all dirty
and smelly, put down my paint
ings, space out and stare at me
with your bloodshot, zombie eyes
like you want to kill me, and then
you have the gall to ask me if I
understand you?" She ran out in
tears.
I once believed myself to be in
love with Violet. But was it possi
ble? To love her? To love anyone?
Love is a hateful thing: it is violent
and destructive in its selfishness.
It doesn't ask for the mere
merger of the flesh — that's pros
titution. No, it asks for a whole lot
more, the drinking of the soul,
and so, to truly love someone or
something is to enslave their soul
to yours so that you can drag it
along wherever you go, to the
grave if need be, in order to rid
yourself of that infernal solitude
with which you entered the world
and with which you will exit.
For the love we flaunt is noth
ing more than a guise for our own
insecurity, our own fear, our own
hypocrisy because, after all, it's
just a mirror we hold up to our
selves and either we love our
selves or we don't.

merger of the flesh — that's pros
titution. No, it asks for a whole lot
more, the drinking of the soul,
and so, to truly love someone or
something is to enslave their soul
to yours so that you can drag it
along wherever you go, to the
grave if need be, in order to rid
yourself of that infernal solitude
with which you entered the world
and with which you will exit.
For the love we flaunt is noth
ing more than a guise for our own
insecurity, our own fear, our own
hypocrisy because, after all, it's
just a mirror we hold up to our
selves and either we love our
selves or we don't.

I needed to get away from school for a
while, even for just a day. So I took off with
Petronius and Fellini to Babylon, the
amusement park.
We were standing in line to get on "The
Edge," that joyride where you sit in a cabin
and drop a few hundred feet hoping your
heart and your genitals stay intact, when I
found myself staring at this anorexic lady
with three kids: a boy, a girl and a baby (sex
uncertain to me) sucking the life from her
breast.
She was wearing a thin, flowery dress,
faded from wear and smeared with candy
she had bought her children. She was

young, must have had her kids before fin
ishing high school, and the three different
fathers must occasionally have sent her
money so that on a day like that day she
could leave her mother's house and make
the kids forget that they had no one father
and that they didn't have enough clothes or
enough food and an uncertain future.
But the kids were experiencing one of
those bright, sunny, brief memories that
they would take refuge in when adults.

The little boy had an ice cream
cone the little girl wanted. She
snatched it out of his hand and
pushed him to the ground. He got
up and tried to take it back, but
the cone fell to the ground, and
the little girl stepped on it. They
pulled each other's hair,
scratched each other's face and
kicked each other's shins.
The mother, who had been
looking around distractedly while
this was going on, quickly caught
on. Her sullen and otherwise ane
mic face bloated up like a red bal
loon, and she reached out with
her long bony hand and slapped
both kids across the face.
Her angry face was ugly, the
kids' blubbering faces were ugly,
and now even the otherwise
adorable baby was ugly with cry
ing too.
I looked away but every other
person I saw around me was ugly
too — their clothes, body shapes,
facial features — and there were
so many of them, so many fucking
more of them that I couldn't see,
much less imagine: the cesspool of
humanity.
They knew I thought they were
ugly because I was ugly to them. I
tried to stop myself, but their
voices and faces crammed into my
head and I had to scream and
scream with all my existence to
push them out.
My friends broke out laughing,
suggesting I wait until I got on
the ride first.
But I started babbling about
how there were so many people
and that nothing made us unique
because we were all equally ugly
and limited by the deformities we
call our bodies and that our spir
its, if we had any, must free them
selves from such horrid captivity.
(Limitation: the spirit being cap
tive to the body.)

Petronius arid Fellini thought I
was wigging out and maybe I was.
So they took me back to my apart
ment. That was the last I saw of
them because even friendship has
its limitations and temporality.
I needed someone to confide in,
someone I could trust, someone
with the angelic capacity to
soothe my tormented soul. I
arranged to meet with my girl-

Petronius and
Fellini thought I

friend, Violet Thorn.
We met at the local art muse
um, Art Is Us, because she had
some paintings that were being
displayed.
They were paintings of fruits
and human models and buildings
and such, but the truth was I
didn't know much about art
except that it asked too much of
me.
I was about to suggest we leave
when I caught a glimpse of her
last painting.
"What does it mean?" I asked
Violet.
"It's just a couple, that's all.
The perfect couple you could say
meeting by the fountain in the
moonlight behind the ballroom
away from everyone else, that's
all," she said.
She bit her lower, lusciously
red lip and blinked her long lash
es to draw attention to her sap
phire eyes. She stood perfectly
still in her long, tight, noire dress
with lace fringes — just like a por
trait, and like one, she had no real
life of her own.
But the painting existed never
theless, and so did she. They
would both age nevertheless, and
the fresh paint would later dry

and crack, falling off piece by
piece.
"I mean what does it really
mean, especially that backdrop?"
I asked.
"Night time," she said, "that's
all."
"Don't enemies, nightmares or
fears lurk in that obscure pulp,
just waiting to devour that pale
moonlight, that urine-colored
water spewing from that cold,
stone fountain and most of all
those masquerading fools by it?"
I grabbed her by the shoulders
and tried to shake out an answer
but then embraced her, never
wanting to let go.
She pulled away and said,
"Look, I don't know what's going
in your life, Will, but you sure as
hell are spooking me out. You ask
me to meet with you because
you've got some kind of problem;
then you show up here all dirty
and smelly, put down my paint
ings, space out and stare at me
with your bloodshot, zombie eyes
like you want to kill me, and then
you have the gall to ask me if I
understand you?" She ran out in
tears.
I once believed myself to be in
love with Violet. But was it possi
ble? To love her? To love anyone?
Love is a hateful thing: it is violent
and destructive in its selfishness.
It doesn't ask for the mere
merger of the flesh — that's pros
titution. No, it asks for a whole lot
more, the drinking of the soul,
and so, to truly love someone or
