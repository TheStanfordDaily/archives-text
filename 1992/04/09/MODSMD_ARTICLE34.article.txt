# Musician talented, but overambitious

Like so many other lounge and cof
fee house singers, Ashia Chacko
dreams of becoming a star and defining
a new category of music. Unfortunate
ly, since she is a young and inexperi
enced artist, she often appears idealis
tic and naive.
Though she describes herself as
part of a new "eclectic" sound — you
know, that "world beat" typified by
Paul Simon, in which Americans incor
porate African rhythms — she sounds
more confused than anything else.
Chacko, who is performing at several
area clubs over the next two weeks, says
her broad and diverse upbringing — she
has lived in six different countries —
has created this style. But rather than
forcing her to create a unique perspec
tive, these experiences have so muddled
her philosophies that she doesn't really
seem to know where she stands.
At worst, she seems fearfully over
ambitious, and her hope to "touch
upon the mythological" is clearly unre
alistic for a new artist with barely an
album full of songs.

With experiences that have included
seeing the poverty of underdeveloped
Asian countries, and an ostensibly
strong background in psychology and

art, one would hope for a Natalie Mer
chant-like singer-songwriter. Instead I
found a woman more like one of Flan
nery O'Connor's Southern mothers.
Like O'Connor's characters, she is
full of cliches and cheesy metaphors,
but also has a lot of energy and poten
tial for development. Overall, Chacko
is a fully adequate singer who writes
melodic tunes with complex rhythms.
Her songs are soft and flowing, and her
voice at its best recalls Sade and
Suzanne Vega.
A Far Eastern sound pervades all of
her music, whether she is writing in a
wry, obscure vein or simply describing
a storm coming over the South Bay.
Chacko is the perfect lounge singer
if you are in the mood to relax and hear
original, interesting female vocals. If
she indeed has a new sound, it will take
a while to develop. In the meantime,
she should stay in the small scene
while she tries to figure herself out.

Ashia Chacko will perform Friday,
April 10, at the Red Rock Cafe in
Mountain View and Monday, April 20,
at the Gatehouse in Palo Alto.
