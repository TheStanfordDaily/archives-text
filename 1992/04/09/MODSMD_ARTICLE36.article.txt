# Absurdist wit casts new light on 'Hamlet'
## 
### Sean Etigson Staff writer 
What happens to characters if
they're taken from one play and
dropped into another? How do
characters, actors and the audi
ence come to terms with fate?
First-year law student Rob Gor
man decided that classes just
weren't enough for him; he would
direct a play that provided some
answers to these questions.
And not just any play. He would
direct one that required rapid-fire
dialogue, a dizzying array of
entrances and exits and a steadfast
commitment to exploring the con
nections between art and life.
Written by English playwright
Tom Stoppard, "Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead" will be
performed on campus this Friday
and Saturday.
The drama, conceived in 1967
in the wake of "Waiting for
Godot," retells the Hamlet story
from the unique perspective of the
angst-ridden prince's two univer
sity buddies.
Gorman calls the play "a half
absurdist, half-philosophic piece"
and says that "Stoppard's wit and
wordplay" drew him to the work.
Unlike Beckett or lonesco, Gor
man says Stoppard's play "pulls
away from hard-core absurdism.
Through his use of the Hamlet
plot, there is a backdrop of some
thing extremely familiar to most
audiences."
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
are lost in that they have no past;
they can only go by what the script
of Hamlet says. They defy other
absurdist plays in that they do have
a script, however. As Gorman

notes, "They are aimless characters
in a very definite environment."
The absurd leaves an indelible
mark on this drama, but it func
tions in the context of razor-sharp
humor and multi-leveled exchanges
that leave audience members ques
tioning their own lives.
What keeps the play from
falling into idle banter, in both the
script and this particular produc
tion, is the sense of urgency; the
assumption that fate is a quantity
that can be somehow measured
and understood.
This idea of how an individual

stands in relation to his or her fate
became an important issue in
rehearsals, Gorman said.
He explained, "No matter how
many times you run the play,
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
come to the same end. What's so
interesting is watching the two of
them come to these realizations.
The play for them is a process of
discovery and of coming to terms
with their fate."
By casting a female Rosen
scrantz against a male Guilden
stern, Gorman says that he tried
to accentuate how different indi

viduals deal with destiny.
"We came to understand Rosen
crantz and Guildenstern as two
halves of the same person. One
(Guildenstern) is the left brain and
the other (Rosencrantz) is the right
brain. We kind of played up tradi
tional gender roles."
Rosencrantz operates with a
type of blissful ignorance, while
Guildenstern confronts fate
through a series of logic games.
Through the Player, the leader
of the troupe of tragedians that
tumble through the odd corners of
the show, the play offers a third
method of dealing with fate.
In the face of a sputtering
Guildenstern, the Player counsels,
"Relax. Respond. That's what peo
ple do. You can't go through life
questioning your situation at
every turn.. .. Act natural."
For all of its fine use of Stop
pard's language, this production
does more than just talk about the
link between art and life. The pro
ceeds from the performance go to
benefit the East Palo Alto Law
Project, a program set up by Stan
ford Law students that provides
free legal services to low-income
communities.
An intriguing, intrepid perfor
mance awaits those who aren't
afraid to engage in Stoppard's wit.
"What are you playing at?" Rosen
crantz asks Guildenstern, who
replies, "Words. Words. They're all
we have to go on."

"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Are Dead"plays Friday and Satur
day, April 10 and 11, at 8 p.m. in
Kresge Auditorium. Tickets are $5.
Proceeds benefit the East Palo Alto
Law Project.

What keeps the play from
falling into idle banter, in both the
script and this particular produc
tion, is the sense of urgency; the
assumption that fate is a quantity
that can be somehow measured
and understood.
This idea of how an individual

stands in relation to his or her fate
became an important issue in
rehearsals, Gorman said.
He explained, "No matter how
many times you run the play,
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
come to the same end. What's so
interesting is watching the two of
them come to these realizations.
The play for them is a process of
discovery and of coming to terms
with their fate."
By casting a female Rosen
scrantz against a male Guilden
stern, Gorman says that he tried
to accentuate how different indi

viduals deal with destiny.
"We came to understand Rosen
crantz and Guildenstern as two
halves of the same person. One
(Guildenstern) is the left brain and
the other (Rosencrantz) is the right
brain. We kind of played up tradi
tional gender roles."
Rosencrantz operates with a
type of blissful ignorance, while
Guildenstern confronts fate
through a series of logic games.
Through the Player, the leader
of the troupe of tragedians that
tumble through the odd corners of
the show, the play offers a third
method of dealing with fate.
In the face of a sputtering
Guildenstern, the Player counsels,
"Relax. Respond. That's what peo
ple do. You can't go through life
questioning your situation at
every turn.. .. Act natural."
For all of its fine use of Stop
pard's language, this production
does more than just talk about the
link between art and life. The pro
ceeds from the performance go to
benefit the East Palo Alto Law
Project, a program set up by Stan
ford Law students that provides
free legal services to low-income
communities.
An intriguing, intrepid perfor
mance awaits those who aren't
afraid to engage in Stoppard's wit.
"What are you playing at?" Rosen
crantz asks Guildenstern, who
replies, "Words. Words. They're all
we have to go on."

"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Are Dead"plays Friday and Satur
day, April 10 and 11, at 8 p.m. in
Kresge Auditorium. Tickets are $5.
Proceeds benefit the East Palo Alto
Law Project.
