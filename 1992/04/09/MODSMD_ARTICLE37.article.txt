# History museum reveals present's skewed views
## 
### Ed Heinemann Staff writer 
Historical museums, in general, are a
lousy idea.
Well-meaning curators line dusty
shelves with even dustier relics in an
attempt to show what life used to be
like. But the result is more often than
not a campy, altogether fictional re-cre
ation of some fuzzy golden age of yore,
when men were men and women cooked
a lot.
Not to mention that even the most
cultured of grown-ups can have a hard
time getting excited about yet another
18th century shoehorn.
That said, the San Mateo County
Historical Museum in San Mateo has
put together an exhibit that manages to
fascinate in spite of itself. "World War
II Homefront," on display through June
30, features newspaper and magazine
clippings, war-related items and —
most prominently — American propa
ganda posters issued by the Office of
War Information.
Not that "propaganda" is a descrip
tion that the museum staff itself would
be likely to use. Given the characteriza
tion of the Costanos Indians in another
exhibit as "simple" savages and the glo
rification of, among other groups, log
gers, whalers and Spanish explorers and
missionaries, the posters may well be
intended as a patriotic tribute.
In any case, approaching the collec
tion of more than 100 posters — rela
tively large for the small museum —
with a good sense of irony, and a refusal
to swallow the pseudo-historical bull
radiated by the rest of the place, is like
ly to produce a certain degree of outrage
— and a good deal of laughter.
A series of four life-sized Norman
Rockwell scenes sets the tone right as
you enter the building. One of the Rock
well prints shows a family sitting down
to Christmas dinner, smiling blissfully
as Mom prepares to plop the turkey
down on the table so Dad can carve it.
The caption — "OURS ... to fight
for: FREEDOM FROM WANT" -
seems to apply to everyone but Mom,
whose unsmiling mug shows that she
wants to put the damn turkey down,
however happy everyone else is.
The off-chance that Mom's scowl
reveals Rockwell to be a subversive
satirist — and feminist — before his

time is pretty much negated by the
other three scenes, which tout freedom
of speech, freedom from fear and free
dom of worship with all the tear-yank
ing kitsch the master could muster.
Women are in fact the subject of a
number of memorable pieces in the
exhibit. One woman, apparently intend
ed to represent the large number of
women then entering the American
work force for the first time, says
"THIS IS MY FIGHT TOO! PUT AT
LEAST 10% EVERY PAYDAY IN WAR
BONDS." Her dirty overalls and the
grease smeared on her arm and neck
seem convincing — at least until your
eyes wander to her perfect makeup and
perm.
Another woman, holding two babies
and looking stoic, appeals to a more tra
ditional gender mindset: "I GAVE A
MAN! Will you give at least 10% of your
pay in war bonds?"
Children were another favorite of the
Office of War Information, both as sub
jects of propaganda and targets of it.

In one poster, three small,
earnest-looking waifs, the youngest
carrying an American flag on a
makeshift pole, stand nestled in
the crook of a huge swastika shad
ow on their lawn, with the caption
"Don't Let That Shadow Touch
Them: Buy WAR BONDS."
In another, Donald Duck,
Pinocchio and three of the Seven
Dwarfs beg kids to "Buy a Bond"
and join the "Junior Roll of
Honor."
For those who felt guilty about
sitting at home while Americans
fought overseas, the posters also
provided the opportunity for
plenty of vicarious violence. One
blunt example shouts "Let 'Em
Have It: BUY EXTRA BONDS"
— and shows a soldier preparing
to toss a grenade that might as
well be in the viewer's hand.
In another, the viewer is told
that "Every $3.00 you put into
War Bonds buys 144 rifle bul
lets." You get to do eveiything
but shoot them.
The most devastating irony of
the exhibit might well be the
racist appeals to American equal
ity. A poster that pats Americans
on the back for their religious
openness shows a horrendously
buck-toothed "Jap" in a rising
sun hat whispering into the ear of
an American businessman.
And this just a few feet away
from a poster announcing the
evacuation of all Americans of
Japanese descent from San
Mateo County.
The irony of the entire exhibit
almost becomes explicit with a set
of photos and text describing the
hypocritical treatment of women
during and after the war; it's too
bad that that irony is lost on the
rest of the museum.
At the end of the propaganda
exhibit is the beginning of a self
guided tour through the history
of the county. A tiny, ugly model
of a creature called the Paleop
aradoxia, a charcoal drawing of
someone that's apparently
intended to look appropriately
Neanderthalish and a fossil of
four elephant teeth are sup
posed to represent San Mateo
history up through the birth of
Christ.
That sketchy lineage becomes
more detailed with the advent of

the Costanos, about whom we are
told that "[they] knew nothing
about metals" and that "a mild
climate and abundant food
allowed [theml to live with no
great effort on their part. They
planted no crops and made no
textiles or pottery."
The Spanish, by comparison
— who get an awfully symbolic
ornate iron gate leading to their
section, "The Spanish Come" —
are intelligent, heroic figures who
bring civilization and culture to

The museum . . . has
apparently snoozed
through the Colum
bus controversy

the region.
The museum, which has
apparently snoozed through the
Columbus controversy, seems to
join in the exultation of the Span
ish triumph over the land and its
people — a triumph portrayed
with no hint of violence, only
clear cultural superiority.
The rest of the museum is less
offensive, stocked mostly with
ugly dioramas and an unques
tioning celebration of local indus
tries. Yes, the lumbering exhibit
blares that "Before, during, and
after the Gold Rush, many men
succumbed to THE LURE OF
THE REDWOODS," and the
whaling exhibit looks more like
an aquarium display than a
depiction of a brutal hunt, but
the cheesy hodgepodge of the
entire setting makes it hard to
really care.
Despite the cheese, the muse
um, located on the campus of the
College of San Mateo, is definite
ly worth a look, if only for the
propaganda posters and a view of
the Peninsula that puts the Stan
ford Foothills to shame.
We all know that history
wasn't much like this, but some
times it's fun — and a bit fright
ening — to wonder what kind of
person thinks that it was.
