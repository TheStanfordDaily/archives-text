# History museum reveals present's skewed views
## 
### Ed Heinemann Staff writer 
Historical museums, in general, are a
lousy idea.
Well-meaning curators line dusty
shelves with even dustier relics in an
attempt to show what life used to be
like. But the result is more often than
not a campy, altogether fictional re-cre
ation of some fuzzy golden age of yore,
when men were men and women cooked
a lot.
Not to mention that even the most
cultured of grown-ups can have a hard
time getting excited about yet another
18th century shoehorn.
That said, the San Mateo County
Historical Museum in San Mateo has
put together an exhibit that manages to
fascinate in spite of itself. "World War
II Homefront," on display through June
30, features newspaper and magazine
clippings, war-related items and —
most prominently — American propa
ganda posters issued by the Office of
War Information.
Not that "propaganda" is a descrip
tion that the museum staff itself would
be likely to use. Given the characteriza
tion of the Costanos Indians in another
exhibit as "simple" savages and the glo
rification of, among other groups, log
gers, whalers and Spanish explorers and
missionaries, the posters may well be
intended as a patriotic tribute.
In any case, approaching the collec
tion of more than 100 posters — rela
tively large for the small museum —
with a good sense of irony, and a refusal
to swallow the pseudo-historical bull
radiated by the rest of the place, is like
ly to produce a certain degree of outrage
— and a good deal of laughter.
A series of four life-sized Norman
Rockwell scenes sets the tone right as
you enter the building. One of the Rock
well prints shows a family sitting down
to Christmas dinner, smiling blissfully
as Mom prepares to plop the turkey
down on the table so Dad can carve it.
The caption — "OURS ... to fight
for: FREEDOM FROM WANT" -
seems to apply to everyone but Mom,
whose unsmiling mug shows that she
wants to put the damn turkey down,
however happy everyone else is.
The off-chance that Mom's scowl
reveals Rockwell to be a subversive
satirist — and feminist — before his

time is pretty much negated by the
other three scenes, which tout freedom
of speech, freedom from fear and free
dom of worship with all the tear-yank
ing kitsch the master could muster.
Women are in fact the subject of a
number of memorable pieces in the
exhibit. One woman, apparently intend
ed to represent the large number of
women then entering the American
work force for the first time, says
"THIS IS MY FIGHT TOO! PUT AT
LEAST 10% EVERY PAYDAY IN WAR
BONDS." Her dirty overalls and the
grease smeared on her arm and neck
seem convincing — at least until your
eyes wander to her perfect makeup and
perm.
Another woman, holding two babies
and looking stoic, appeals to a more tra
ditional gender mindset: "I GAVE A
MAN! Will you give at least 10% of your
pay in war bonds?"
Children were another favorite of the
Office of War Information, both as sub
jects of propaganda and targets of it.
