# 'In the spotlight, losing my religion'
## Oh, no — Harris has finally said too much, and hasn't said enough 
### 
For ages, humans have pondered
the existence of God: What does
God look like? Does it have gen
der? Is it bigger than a breadbox?
Or is there a God? Is Clapton God?
Am I God? Am I Clapton? And does
"Thank Clapton for Harris!" really
have the same ring to it?
Well, folks, for your own personal
enlightenment, here's your source for
all the answers: introducing Harris'
Quickie Guide to World Religions. Let's
hope I don't have to do the Salman
Rushdie hideaway thing come Friday
morning. .. .
Judaism
Hi! My name is God, but you can call
me: Jehovah
Food rules: Oscar Meyer = bad; Hebrew
National = good
Major text: The Torah
Theme song: The Horah
Sodom and: Gomorrah
Notes: The first five books of the Old
Testament — Genesis, Exodus, Leviti
cus, Numbers and Bashful — make up
the Torah. Why are so few Spaniards
Jewish? They think the Torah is mostly
bull. Thus Hanukkah remains a meno
rahty celebration.
Buddhism
Hi! My name is God, but you can call
me: Buddha
Food rules: Don't eat anything one
hour before taking meditation.
Major text: The Collected Biographies
of Shirley MacLaine
Theme song: "Shake your Buddhy"
Notes: Only religion whose major deity,
if you say its name three times fast, can
make you sound like Twikki from Buck
Rogers: "buddhabuddhabuddha . . .
Hey, Buck!"
Islam
Hi! My name is God, but you can call
me: Allah
Major text: The Koran
Food rules: Salman is best served cold.
Theme songs: "Peace Train," "Wild
World," "Morning Has Broken"
Notes: Nice religion . . . Good Islam . . .
Stay calm! . . . There now, that's better
— I won't slander you like that mean ol'
Mr. Rushdie did . . . Hold it, now . . .
Just put the gun down . . .
Scientology
Hi! My name is God, but you can call
me: L. Ron Hubbard
Major text: "Dianetics," by L. Ron Hubbard

Food rules: Diarrhetics
Theme song: "Take the money and
run
Notes: How to write really bad sci-fi
novels and have your own publishing
company print them — page 731.
How to take the public for millions
with your own "religion" scam — page
97.
Dude, what's up with that volcano?
— page 420.
Catholicism
Hi! My name is God, but you can call
me: only through your local priest.
Food rules: Don't drink, don't smoke
(what do you do?)
Major text: The New Testament
Theme song: "Every Sperm is Sacred"
Notes: [See Appendix A]
Protestantism
Hi! My name is God, but you can call
me: God
Food rules: Yes, it certainly does.
Major texts: Calvin and Hobbes
Theme song: "Only the Good Die
Young"
Notes: [See Appendix A]
Appendix A
The Bible is generally considered the
bible of major Western religions. Thus,
it seems appropriate to review its high
lights for our readers:
The Old Testament:
• God creates the Earth in six days,
and, like most hurry-up jobs, it soon
starts falling apart.
• Noah, fortunate enough to run
across a pair of kangaroos in the
Mideast, survives the Flood that
drowns everything not in the Ark. This
is also known as "The Golden Age of
Fish."
• The Lot family escapes Sodom and
Gomorrah, but the wife disobediently
looks back, and is turned into a pillar of

salt. All anyone can say about the salt is,
"Gosh, that's an awful Lot." They enjoy
well-seasoned meals for the next three
years.
• Jacob fathers twelve sons and no
daughters, thus becoming the first con
vert to more-men-ism.
• God and Satan make a "Trading
Places"-style wager on Job, and guess
who wins. The poor sod's "Why me?"
complaint leads to God's famous quip,
"Hey, it's tough, Job, but somebody's
gotta do it."
The New Testament:
Introduces the most blatant Christ
figure in Western literature, and then
concludes with Revelation, the world's
first recorded evidence of an acid trip.
The effects that Jesus has had upon
the Western world are immense. Just
imagine what the world would be like
had Jesus Christ never been born:
• Welch's Grape Juice sales wouldn't
skyrocket before the first Sunday of
every month.
• Salvation Army volunteers, having
no Santa Claus outfits to wear, would
freeze to death every December.
• In order to ward off evil spirits, peo
ple would be encouraged to "make a
plus sign" with their fingers.
• Intermission's humor column
would be written by "-opher Harris."
• We'd have nothing to look forward
to reading in hotel rooms.
• People visiting St. Paul's Cathedral
in the Vatican would say, "Well, this is
nice and all, but what's the point?"
• Every year at the end of December,
people would get together to re-enact
scenes of the three wise men from the
East who get lost in the desert.
• A fond saying would be, "If anyone
strikes you on the right cheek, then
sock him back."
• No Puritan work ethic. That
means Americans would start out being
lazy, uninspired workers instead of
taking two hundred years to evolve into
them.
• When someone says "Is the Pope
Catholic?" everyone would just stand
around, shrug their shoulders, and look
dumbly at one another.
And, oh yes, our souls wouldn't be
saved. Have I been blasphemous? Well,
then, Thank God for Heresy!

To reduce Christian-Jewish tensions,
Chris Harris suggests combining
April's two major holidays into one,
and calling it Paas-over.

THANK GOD FOR HARRIS!
