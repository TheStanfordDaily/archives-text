# 'Casablanca' still captivates
## Even after 50 years, our hearts are stuck in Morocco 
### Victor Haseman Staff writer 
If the Stanford Theatre continues to present
films of the caliber of "Casablanca," I just might
be forced to agree with the popular claim that Hol
lywood's first 50 years yielded its best cinema.
Warner Brothers' 1943 release starring
Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman has capti
vated millions and, at its present course, will con
tinue to do so.
It is for this reason that the Stanford Theater
has planned to run the film from April 8-30 — an
engagement of unprecedented length — in honor
of the film's 50th anniversary.
Based on an original play co-written by Murray
Burnett and Joan Allison, "Casablanca" is the
story of an American, Rick (Bogart), who lives in
Casablanca, French Morocco — the second-to-last
stop on the "freedom train" from German-occu
pied Europe.
One evening, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), a
famous resistance leader, and his wife Ilsa
(Bergman) appear in Rick's nightclub in search of
transit visas out of Europe.
But what is supposed to be the easiest part of
the couple's long trek across Europe proves to be
the most harrowing. The Third Reich has posi

tioned itself in Casablanca to intercept Laszlo, and
Ilsa is unwillingly reunited with a past lover —
Rick.
The stunning performances of Bogart, Bergman
and their supporting cast, as well as the intelligent
screenplay, made "Casablanca" a sure thing in the
Oscar awards for 1943.
The film walked away with three Oscars,
including Best Picture, Best Director (Michael
Curtiz) and Best Screenplay (Julius and Phillip
Epstein and Howard Koch).
The crowd scenes in the black market as well as
the sets of Rick's Cafe Americain are incredible,
considering the movie was filmed entirely in
Southern California.
Furthermore, one would never suspect that the
famous airfield scene at the end of the film was
shot completely at the Metropolitan Airport in Van
Nuys, Calif. It's no wonder that Warner Brothers
and its "dream factories" have been called "a king
dom unto itself."
"Casablanca" is one of those few films that can
be removed almost entirely from their period and
placed in any other without ruining their integrity.
The next 30 days present a rare opportunity to
see the film. The Stanford Theatre's big screen
and classic feel provide the perfect atmosphere to
watch Sam play it again and again.
