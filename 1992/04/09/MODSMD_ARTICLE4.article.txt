# Debate between slates canceled
## 
### John Ford Staff writer 
What if you had a Council of
Presidents debate and nobody
came?
That's what happened when
Branner Hall was forced to cancel a
debate last night because of a lack
of interest. Fewer than five people
showed up, even though Dean of
Admissions James Montoya was on
hand to moderate the event.
"It looks like 'I Prefer Not To
Have A COP' is going to give us a
run for our money," said John
Hall, a member of the Students
First slate.
"Prefer" is a slate advocating
the abolition of the COP. Repre
sentatives from all four COP
slates showed up for the debate.
The candidates and Branner
staff offered many reasons for the
poor attendance, including stu
dent apathy, fraternity and soror
ity rush, lack of advertisement
and confusion over the starting
time.
The starting time for the debate
was changed at the last minute
because some candidates were
already scheduled to appear on
"Talk Back," a KZSU talk show.
"The fliers were cool, but I
didn't really understand them,"
said Alyssa Brewer, a Branner
resident.
"Who's interested in something

that doesn't affect their life?"
asked Hall, adding that members
of the current Students First COP
"have not done a good job commu
nicating what the COP does."
Other candidates felt the lack
of attendance may have been a
fluke. "I don't think it signals a
campus-wide apathy," said Ed
Mun of the "Prefer" slate.
Students First slate member
Glyn Milburn agreed, saying, "I
think students are concerned"
about campus politics.
"I feel bad because I went to
Safeway" instead of attending the
debate, one Brannerite said.
