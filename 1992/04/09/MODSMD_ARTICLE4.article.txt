# Debate between slates canceled

What if you had a Council of
Presidents debate and nobody
came?
That's what happened when
Branner Hall was forced to cancel a
debate last night because of a lack
of interest. Fewer than five people
showed up, even though Dean of
Admissions James Montoya was on
hand to moderate the event.
"It looks like 'I Prefer Not To
Have A COP' is going to give us a
run for our money," said John
Hall, a member of the Students
First slate.
"Prefer" is a slate advocating
the abolition of the COP. Repre
sentatives from all four COP
slates showed up for the debate.
The candidates and Branner
staff offered many reasons for the
poor attendance, including stu
dent apathy, fraternity and soror
ity rush, lack of advertisement
