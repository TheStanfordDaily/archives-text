# Kilmer film PC, improbable
## 
### Janar Stewart Editorial staff 
Imagine a landscape of jagged chalk-white hills
scattered beneath a cerulean sky. Listen as a low
chant, accompanied only by the pounding of drums,
whistles through the canyons.
This exact combination of sound and cinematog
raphy is a major part of the power behind "Thun
derheart."
Ray Levoi (Val Kilmer) is a young FBI agent
assigned to investigate a series of murders on a
reservation in South Dakota. Because Levoi is one
quarter Sioux, he is supposed to be the "Indian who
can get the natives to talk."
And he does just that. Even worse, Levoi, who is
disgusted by his Native American heritage in the
beginning of the movie, turns completely around
and rejects his Caucasian three-quarters by the end.
These aspects definitely lack credibility given the
manner in which the characters are depicted. The
Native Americans are highly mistrustful of the
white world and all its representatives, yet they
accept Levoi almost as Christians would accept the
coming Messiah.
Levoi carries a deep disgust of everything Native

American and strives to disassociate himself from
the race. Later, the audience discovers that Levoi is
ashamed of his half-Sioux father, who was an alco
holic. However, Levoi's self-hatred and prejudice
miraculously disappear within the time frame of
three days.
In spite of these flaws, "Thunderheart" scores
many political correctness points. Although much of
the dialogue can get preachy, it still represents emo
tions and racism realistically. Native American
actors fill the screen, with strong performances from
Graham Greene as Walter Crow Horse and Sheila
Tousey as Maggie Eagle Bear.
The film pays respect to Native American culture,
religious ceremonies and everyday practices, yet
does not ignore the problems of alcoholism and
poverty.
In that vein, director Michael Apted does an excel
lent job of portraying the combination of traditional
ism and Western convenience in scenes such as
when medicine man Grandpa Sam Reaches (Chief
Ted Thin Elk) trades Levoi a rock for his Raybans.
Most refreshing of all, "Thunderheart" does not
resolve with one white male "beating incredible
odds" and "saving the day," but ends powerfully in a
way that is true to the people it celebrates.
