## 'Nightline' audience to see Koppel and? 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
It looks like Ted Koppel will be talking
to video monitors at tomorrow night' 3
broadcast of ABC News "Nightline,"
where the lucky few with tickets will
undergo a lengthy process before quizzing
the presidential hopefuls.
A spokesperson for Arkansas Gov. Bill
Clinton said yesterday that the candidate
will probably not be on the panel.
Representatives for President Bush
and Vice President Dan Quayle also said
it is doubtful they will appear, although a
final decision has not been made.
Only television commentator Patrick
Buchanan and former California Gov.
Jerry Brown have confirmed they will
appear via satellite.
Winners of Stanford's ticket lottery
will take part in a process of "rehearsed
spontaneity" before asking questions at
the technological town meeting, said
Richard Harris, a producer of live inter
views for "Nightline."

This format keeps the same issues
from being covered twice, he added.
Those planning to attend the event
will fill out questionnaires about their
areas of special interest and possible
questions, Harris said. Some ticket-hold
ers with special interests will be inter
viewed by "Nightline" staff to decide who
can ask questions.
"Nightline" will then set up a process
for this small percentage of audience mem
bers to get to the microphones, he added.
"ABC really controls their audience,"
said Director of University Relations
Richard Kurovsky. The need for control
stems from the pressures of doing a live
broadcast and problems with inappropri
ate questions, he said.
Panel still not set
Clinton is not likely to appear on the
broadcast, according to his press represen
tative, Richard Martin. "The governor is
taking time off from campaigning until
Monday, so that would mean he is
not doing 'Nightline,' " Martin
said.
Texas businessman Ross
Perot's press representative said
she did not know if the indepen
dent candidate would be partici
pating, but "if he does it, he will
do it via satellite and not come to
the Stanford campus."
Plans to invite former Demo
cratic candidate Paul Tsongas are
being considered, said Vice Presi
dent for Public Affairs Bob Free
len. "That decision hasn't been
made yet," he said.
"At this point, it does not look
very likely that any of the candi
dates will come to campus," said
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington. "But the rumors change."
If no candidates come to Stan
ford, security will focus on the
stage and technical equipment,
said Herrington. "The audience

will all be seated and ticketed, so
that will make it a lot easier," he
said.

Even before the lottery win
ners were announced, many
members of the Stanford commu
nity volunteered to work for
"Nightline" in any capacity, Free
len said. Most volunteers will
deliver tickets, make phone calls,
get signs and usher.
More than 60 volunteers have
said they would to do anything to
help with the show, said Kim
Geil, the Stanford Guide Service
coordinator. "If things work out,
people who volunteer will get to
see the show, but there is no guar
antee," she said.
The town meeting will air live
on the East Coast and on the
Stanford campus, where "Night
line" can be seen three hours
ahead of its regularly scheduled
time, said a representative for
SUNet.
The show can be seen on Chan
nel 13 in the student residences
and on Channel 43 in the academ
ic buildings.
