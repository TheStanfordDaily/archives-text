# Students can vote from dorm clusters

Poll sites for next week's ASSU gen
eral election will be tripled this year
with the addition of every campus com
puter cluster, a change Election Com
missioner Enda Hu says will make vot
ing more convenient.
But Council of Presidents member
John Overdeck said he believes the new
format for elections "points out the
inequities" of the way computer clusters
are located on campus.
Many graduate students and those
who live off campus or on the Row will
not benefit from the increase in poll
sites, Overdeck said.
There will be 31 poll sites this year,
compared with 11 last year. More than
100 computers will be used for the elec
tion, which is slated for April 15-16.
Hu said he feels the addition of more
poll sites will make for less time spent
in line at each cluster and in central
polling places such as Meyer Library
and Tresidder Union.
An additional poll site will be set up
in Green Library both days from 12:30
p.m. to 7:30 p.m. to facilitate graduate
student voting.

Overdeck, however, said the Elec
tion Commission "could have made a
slightly better effort" by putting poll
sites in Escondido Village and at least
one Row house.
A special program had to be written so
the computers could be used for voting,

There will be 31 poll sites
this year, compared with
11 last year.

Hu said. The program will be installed in
each individual computer to prevent tam
pering during the voting times.
Votes will be automatically tabulated
by the computers, which will then reset
themselves for the next voter, he said.
By using the computers as poll
booths, results of the elections will be
known much earlier than in previous
elections, according to Hu.
But the final results for the Council
of Presidents and the Senior Class
Presidents races will take longer to

tally, he said, because winners will be
determined by preferential voting this
year to avoid a run-ofT election.
The only foreseeable problems with
this new election format, he said, would
be if everyone in a dorm waited until the
last minute to vote and caused a delay.
The idea behind computerizing the
election originated last year, when a
few clusters were used as part of a pilot
program.
The ASSU worked with the Office of
Residential Education to coordinate the
best times for using the clusters. Toyon
resident assistant Toni Extavour said she
does not believe it will be much of a disrup
tion for voters to use the cluster for two
hours in the early evening, since "most
students use our cluster just for printing."
Although dorm clusters will be used,
Hu said the ASSU will be in charge of
the election. Resident computer coordi
nators will act as liaisons with the
ASSU to make sure that all of the com
puters are running.
While the new computer cluster poll
sites will not increase convenience for
some students, Overdeck said, they will
still make the process "more convenient
than voting in the national election."
