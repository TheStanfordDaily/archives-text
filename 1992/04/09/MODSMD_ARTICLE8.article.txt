# 'Virgin, whore or asexual'
## Lesbians, bisexuals struggle with labels 
### Lydia Lee Staff writer 
For a group whose most
recent stereotypical representa
tion is a psychotic in the movie
"Basic Instinct," dealing with
negative images comes with the
territory.
Lesbian and bisexual women
at Stanford say they struggle
with labels, low visibility on
campus and a lack of cohesive
ness in their community.
Senior Toni Long, who is les
bian, said she feels the lesbian and
bisexual women's community on
campus has not been very promi
nent and attributed its relative
invisibility to the fact that
"women are desexualized in our
society."
They are categorized as "vir
gin, whore or asexual," and
there is a belief that lesbians are
"not having real sex," she said.
In a 1989 Counseling and Psy
chological Services study, coun
selor Trudie Heming found that
lesbian and bisexual women on
campus generally fell in one of
three groups: highly visible and
active, low profile and"in the
closet."
The third group was the major
ity by far, according to Heming,
who specializes in counseling
women regarding their sexual
identity.
The community and LGBCC
According to Eleanor Feingold,
coordinator of the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Center,
90 percent of those attending
LGBCC events are men.
Feingold speculated that
women's limited participation
could have to do with a theory
that women "come out" later in
life than men do. She added that
the majority of people who fre
quent clubs and bars that cater
to non-heterosexuals are men.
Danzy Senna, a senior in
American Studies, attributes the
prominence of gay men on cam
pus to the fact that "men have
defined the gay movement since
the beginning, in the '70s

because of the sexism that exists
even in the queer community."
One student said she went to
a LGBCC event and felt uncom
fortable because she and a friend
were the only women there.
Because of that experience, she
did not want to continue going.
This situation may be self
perpetuating, Feingold said —
women may be initially discour
aged from being active in the
community simply because of a
lack of female members.
An effort to address this dispar
ity is Girls' Night Out, weekly
women's socials sponsored by the
LGBCC.
Girls' Night Out, which start
ed winter quarter and will con
tinue this quarter, takes place on
Thursday nights at the LGBCC.
Events have included a poetry
reading and group discussions.
Feingold said she feels Girls'
Night Out has been "pretty suc
cessful," with attendance at about

10 to 15 women each time.
Myths and misconceptions
Sophomore Rachel Maddow
said although there is a lesbian
and bisexual womens' communi
ty at Stanford, many people have
misconceptions about it.
"There is a common complaint
that 'dykes at Stanford are so
cliquey,' " Maddow said. "But if
you could eavesdrop and be a fly on
the wall, you'd be surprised at the
diversity in the gay community."
"A lot more individuality is
allowed for than in other
cliques,"
Maddow explained. She said
although lesbians and bisexual
women share a common non
heterosexual identity, there is
also a "totally fascinating lack of
community."
Women in the community can
have very different interests, she
said.
The community is "so diverse.

It spans all aspects of life on cam
pus — women's athletics, sorori
ties, the co-ops." Lesbian and
bisexual women are in all these
groups, she pointed out.
The only formal compilation
of names of lesbian and bisexual
women at Stanford is a network
called Beyond Heterosexuality,
which was started in 1989.
Beyond Heterosexuality now
has 150 members, all of who
signed up voluntarily and under
an agreement of confidentiality.
Feingold said the point of the
title was to emphasize the diver
sity of the women in the network
and not bind them with labels
such as "lesbian" and "bisexual."
Reflections on identity
Although some of these
women may participate in the
LGBCC and associated groups of
the Stanford community, sexual

Members of the lesbian and bisexual women's community — from left to right, graduate students
Eleanor Feingold and Sydney Roberts and seniors Toni Long and Danzy Senna — all hope events like
Girls' Night Out will make it easier for women to be comfortable with their sexuality and sexual orien
tation.
