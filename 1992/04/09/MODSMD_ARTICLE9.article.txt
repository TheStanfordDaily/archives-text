Arafat lives
TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) — Yasser Arafat, who
has survived gun battles, air raids and assassina
tion attempts as leader of the Palestinian cause,
walked away yesterday after his plane made a
belly-landing during a desert sandstorm.
PLO officials said three of the five crew aboard
were killed when the plane's nose plowed into a hill.
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi made a bedside
visit with Arafat on Wednesday night at a hospital in
Misratah, 120 miles east of Tripoli. Libyan TV
showed Arafat, lying with a bandaged right eye, smil
ing and chatting with Gadhafi, who embraced him.
"We have treated him fully and comprehen
sively," Dr. Muftah al-Shwayhidi said. "His
health is excellent."
Bassam Abu Sharif, a close adviser, said Arafat
should be healthy enough Thursday to preside
over a session of the PLO's 80-member, policy
making Central Council.
In a televised interview with a Libyan reporter,

Arafat thanked Gadhafi for having "mobilized the
whole state" to find him. He said the two pilots
and engineer were killed and five others badly
hurt. Others on the plane suffered minor injuries
or escaped unhurt, he said.
Fujimori claims public support
LIMA, Peru (AP) — President Alberto Fujimori,
promising to root out corruption and inefficiency,
said yesterday night that the public supported his
decision to close Congress and suspend civil liberties.
"We would have preferred other measures,"
Fujimori said in the first speech since he
announced the measures Sunday. But the mili
tary-backed crackdown was necessary "for the
reconstruction of the country."
The state of emergency entered its third full
day with tanks still parked at the Palace of Justice
and troops still patrolling the streets. Fujimori,
53, said he saw signs of support in a walk through
Lima earlier in the day.
