# VP to hear about Cowell staff 'crisis'
## 
### Holly Hacker Senior staff writer 
Amidst what some are calling a
management "crisis," Cowell Stu
dent Health Center staff mem
bers will meet today with Vice
President for Student Resources
Mary Edmonds. They are expect
ed to discuss tensions within
Cowell dating back to an adminis
trative decision made a year ago.
Dissatisfaction among the
Cowell staff seems to stem from a
decision last September in which
Cowell awarded the Faculty Prac
tice Program — a Medical School
group — the right to provide pri
mary and specialty care and refer
ral services, which had been han
dled by the Palo Alto Medical
Foundation for 45 years.
At the time, some staff mem
bers said they were angry because
they hadn't been consulted about
the change, and frustrated over
what they considered to be a lack
of communication between Cow
ell administrators and staff.
Eight months later, some Cow
ell staff say there are still prob
lems to be worked out between
Cowell and FPP. Such adminis
trative issues are expected to be
addressed at today's meeting,
which Cowell employees, but not
administrators, will attend.
Many employees were reluctant
to fully discuss the details of the
situation before today's meeting.
Acting Director of Primary
Care Gene Phillips acknowledged
what he called "differences in
administrative values and proce
dures" between Cowell and FPP.
The differences are both "seri
ous" and "significant," Phillips

said, but he added, "I perceive
them as solvable."
FPP medical director Peter
Gregory said, "There are growing
pains in.the relationship"
between FPP and Cowell, adding
that there are questions of "when
things need to get done."
"We need some way to resolve
certain issues," Gregory said.
Since both Cowell and FPP are
Stanford organizations, the two

cannot draw
up a legal con
tract. Instead,
the groups are
negotiating a
memorandum
of understand
ing to define
their working
relationship.
Edmonds
said she has met
with Cowell

Director Harvey Weinstein to dis
cuss the MOU, which has not yet
been finalized.
Cowell Associate Director Jane
Meier also said Cowell and FPP
are trying "to hammer out an
acceptable MOU."
Meier said she realizes some peo
ple may still be unhappy with the
change. "Yes, some people feel like
they lost something" in the transi
tion, she said. "Yes, some people
would like to turn back the clock."
"When you try to form a new
relationship . . . it's a long process
of negotiation," Weinstein said.
"Some things have been easier to
negotiate than others."
