# VP to hear about Cowell staff 'crisis'
## 
### Holly Hacker Senior staff writer 
Amidst what some are calling a
management "crisis," Cowell Stu
dent Health Center staff mem
bers will meet today with Vice
President for Student Resources
Mary Edmonds. They are expect
ed to discuss tensions within
Cowell dating back to an adminis
trative decision made a year ago.
Dissatisfaction among the
Cowell staff seems to stem from a
decision last September in which
Cowell awarded the Faculty Prac
tice Program — a Medical School
group — the right to provide pri
mary and specialty care and refer
ral services, which had been han
dled by the Palo Alto Medical
Foundation for 45 years.
At the time, some staff mem
bers said they were angry because
they hadn't been consulted about
the change, and frustrated over
what they considered to be a lack
of communication between Cow
ell administrators and staff.
Eight months later, some Cow
ell staff say there are still prob
lems to be worked out between
Cowell and FPP. Such adminis
trative issues are expected to be
addressed at today's meeting,
which Cowell employees, but not
administrators, will attend.
Many employees were reluctant
to fully discuss the details of the
situation before today's meeting.
Acting Director of Primary
Care Gene Phillips acknowledged
what he called "differences in
administrative values and proce
dures" between Cowell and FPP.
The differences are both "seri
ous" and "significant," Phillips

said, but he added, "I perceive
them as solvable."
FPP medical director Peter
Gregory said, "There are growing
pains in.the relationship"
between FPP and Cowell, adding
that there are questions of "when
things need to get done."
"We need some way to resolve
certain issues," Gregory said.
Since both Cowell and FPP are
Stanford organizations, the two

cannot draw
up a legal con
tract. Instead,
the groups are
negotiating a
memorandum
of understand
ing to define
their working
relationship.
Edmonds
said she has met
with Cowell

Director Harvey Weinstein to dis
cuss the MOU, which has not yet
been finalized.
Cowell Associate Director Jane
Meier also said Cowell and FPP
are trying "to hammer out an
acceptable MOU."
Meier said she realizes some peo
ple may still be unhappy with the
change. "Yes, some people feel like
they lost something" in the transi
tion, she said. "Yes, some people
would like to turn back the clock."
"When you try to form a new
relationship . . . it's a long process
of negotiation," Weinstein said.
"Some things have been easier to
negotiate than others."
When Cowell declined to
renew its contract with the Palo


Edmonds
Alto Medical Foundation, most
Cowell employees had to reapply
for their jobs, and some lost vaca
tion time and sick leave in the
process.
Fifty of the Palo Alto Medical
Foundation's 700-member staff
were employed at Cowell, where
they comprised the majority of
the staff.
For the staff members who had
to reapply under FPP, Weinstein
said, "It's like a divorce after 40
years." They "are bound to have
very strong feelings" about the
change, he added.
Tension between Cowell's staff
and its administration has been
another issue of concern. Staff
physician Irene Cannon said, "I
acknowledge that there exists a

'I'm here to listen
[to Cowell staff]
and see what the
issues are. The
agenda is theirs.'
—Mary Edmonds

crisis of confidence in the leader
ship of Cowell."
Edmonds said she has been
meeting with the various depart
ments that report to her since her
arrival on campus more than a
month ago, and that she called
Cowell staff members last week to
schedule a meeting.
Edmonds added that she does

not know enough about the
issues involved to comment on
them yet. "I'm here to listen and
see what the issues are," she
said. "The agenda is theirs. I
have no idea what we are going to
discuss."
Weinstein said he was dis
tressed by the reports of discon
tentment among the staff, but felt
that personnel issues were not
matters for public discussion.
All Cowell staff interviewed
agreed that any conflicts should
not and do not affect the quality
of student care provided at Cow
ell.
Several staff members noted
that recent surveys mailed to
Stanford students who recently
visited Cowell found that stu
dents are, on the whole, satisfied
with the care they receive.
"The goal is to resolve the
issues so we can give the best care
to students," Cannon said.

discuss."
Weinstein said he was dis
tressed by the reports of discon
tentment among the staff, but felt
that personnel issues were not
matters for public discussion.
All Cowell staff interviewed
agreed that any conflicts should
not and do not affect the quality
of student care provided at Cow
ell.
Several staff members noted
that recent surveys mailed to
Stanford students who recently
visited Cowell found that stu
dents are, on the whole, satisfied
with the care they receive.
"The goal is to resolve the
issues so we can give the best care
to students," Cannon said.
Amidst what some are calling a
management "crisis," Cowell Stu
dent Health Center staff mem
bers will meet today with Vice
President for Student Resources
Mary Edmonds. They are expect
ed to discuss tensions within
Cowell dating back to an adminis
trative decision made a year ago.
Dissatisfaction among the
Cowell staff seems to stem from a
decision last September in which
Cowell awarded the Faculty Prac
tice Program — a Medical School
group — the right to provide pri
mary and specialty care and refer
ral services, which had been han
dled by the Palo Alto Medical
Foundation for 45 years.
At the time, some staff mem
bers said they were angry because
they hadn't been consulted about
the change, and frustrated over
what they considered to be a lack
of communication between Cow
ell administrators and staff.
Eight months later, some Cow
ell staff say there are still prob
lems to be worked out between
Cowell and FPP. Such adminis
trative issues are expected to be
addressed at today's meeting,
which Cowell employees, but not
administrators, will attend.
Many employees were reluctant
to fully discuss the details of the
situation before today's meeting.
Acting Director of Primary
Care Gene Phillips acknowledged
what he called "differences in
administrative values and proce
dures" between Cowell and FPP.
The differences are both "seri
ous" and "significant," Phillips

said, but he added, "I perceive
them as solvable."
FPP medical director Peter
Gregory said, "There are growing
pains in.the relationship"
between FPP and Cowell, adding
that there are questions of "when
things need to get done."
"We need some way to resolve
certain issues," Gregory said.
Since both Cowell and FPP are
Stanford organizations, the two

cannot draw
up a legal con
tract. Instead,
the groups are
negotiating a
memorandum
of understand
ing to define
their working
relationship.
Edmonds
said she has met
with Cowell

Director Harvey Weinstein to dis
cuss the MOU, which has not yet
been finalized.
Cowell Associate Director Jane
Meier also said Cowell and FPP
are trying "to hammer out an
acceptable MOU."
Meier said she realizes some peo
ple may still be unhappy with the
change. "Yes, some people feel like
they lost something" in the transi
tion, she said. "Yes, some people
would like to turn back the clock."
"When you try to form a new
relationship . . . it's a long process
of negotiation," Weinstein said.
"Some things have been easier to
negotiate than others."
When Cowell declined to
renew its contract with the Palo


Edmonds
Alto Medical Foundation, most
Cowell employees had to reapply
for their jobs, and some lost vaca
tion time and sick leave in the
process.
Fifty of the Palo Alto Medical
Foundation's 700-member staff
were employed at Cowell, where
they comprised the majority of
the staff.
For the staff members who had
to reapply under FPP, Weinstein
said, "It's like a divorce after 40
years." They "are bound to have
very strong feelings" about the
change, he added.
Tension between Cowell's staff
and its administration has been
another issue of concern. Staff
physician Irene Cannon said, "I
acknowledge that there exists a

'I'm here to listen
[to Cowell staff]
and see what the
issues are. The
agenda is theirs.'

crisis of confidence in the leader
ship of Cowell."
Edmonds said she has been
meeting with the various depart
ments that report to her since her
arrival on campus more than a
month ago, and that she called
Cowell staff members last week to
schedule a meeting.
Edmonds added that she does

not know enough about the
issues involved to comment on
them yet. "I'm here to listen and
see what the issues are," she
said. "The agenda is theirs. I
have no idea what we are going to
discuss."
Weinstein said he was dis
tressed by the reports of discon
tentment among the staff, but felt
that personnel issues were not
matters for public discussion.
All Cowell staff interviewed
agreed that any conflicts should
not and do not affect the quality
