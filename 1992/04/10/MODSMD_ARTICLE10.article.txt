Major wins big in Britain
LONDON (AP) — Prime Minister John Major,
who waged a come-from-behind, soapbox cam
paign to extend 13 years of Conservative Party
government, claimed victory Friday morning
after a nerve-wracking election count.
"We've won tonight a magnificent victory, a
victory that many people thought was beyond our
grasp," Major told cheering supporters at party
headquarters.
With 613 of the 651 districts counted, the Con
servatives had won 321 seats — five short of abso
lute victory — compared to Labor's 269 and 16 for
the Liberal Democrats.
Although Labor had yet to concede, computer
analysis showed the Conservatives were assured
of a majority.
"I'm very pleased. Everything we have done in
the last 13 years will now be conserved and built
on in the future," former Prime Minister Mar
garet Thatcher exulted.
Labor's share of the vote was up about five

points since 1987, but its gains came almost
entirely at the expense of the Liberal Democrats.
Labor Party officials appeared dazed.
"I simply don't know how the British mind and
the British psyche works to produce these results,"
said Roy Hattersley, deputy to Labor leader Neil
Kinnock, as it became clear in the early hours that
the Tories had achieved a fourth successive term.
Tsongas won't rejoin race
BOSTON (AP) — Paul Tsongas ruled out re
entry into the Democratic race yesterday and, in a
burst of parting wisdom, said his former rivals
must embrace his message of economic growth or
suffer at the polls.
"Hear me well, Democrats and Republicans,
the old ways of taking this country into economic
ruin and social chaos are over," Tsongas told a
news conference at which he ended speculation
that he rejoin the race.
Tsongas said low voter turnout this year repre
sents a menacing sign for Democrats.
