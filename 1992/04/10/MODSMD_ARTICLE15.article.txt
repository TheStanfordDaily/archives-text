						lesson in politics

Address student apathy
by focusing on abortion,
resolving financial crisis

IF THE AMERICAN political
process has "run amok,"
addressing the crises facing col
lege students today is an opportu
nity to bring it back on track.
Presidential candidates can cap
ture the students' vote by offering
serious proposals on two of their
most critical concerns: financial
security and abortion rights.
The Bay Area's best and bright
est will gather tonight in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium to talk about the
state of U.S. politics with presiden
tial candidates and "Nightline"
anchor Ted Koppel.
Hopefully, student voices will
play a significant role in the dis
cussion. They will have a unique
opportunity to convey a message
â€” that the right issues will spark
intense interest from a group tra
ditionally thought to be apathetic.
Students are feeling, many for
the first time, the severe financial
crisis as they struggle to remain in
school. They are now realizing the
1980s have ended and their
degrees may not automatically
entitle them to a high-powered job,
an Audi and a Gold Card.
Even worse, many are being
forced to leave school because their
parents cannot support them as
financial aid is slashed and tuition
costs spiral upward. Candidates need
to introduce concrete platforms sen
sitive to these new realities.
Grants must remain a priority in
the federal budget, especially since
many universities are reconsider
ing their policies of admitting stu
dents without regard to financial
need as part of an attempt to allevi
ate their own budget crunches.
Increasing the amount of stu
dent loans is not a viable solution,
since the burden of paying back
thousands of dollars prevents grad
uates from acquiring necessities

such as adequate health care and
affordable housing.
Many students are now deciding
they cannot afford to pursue
employment options in public ser
vice or government jobs that lack
substantial monetary compensa
tion but are, nevertheless, key to
improving the quality of life.
Also, uppermost in the minds of
students is the increasingly conser
vative Supreme Court's impending
decision on abortion rights. For
students whose mothers who went
to college before Roe vs. Wade, the
probability that the landmark case
will be overturned causes more
than subtle alarm.
Having heard about the "dark
ages" of illegal abortions and the
humiliating situation where women
did not control their own bodies,
most students are looking for more
from the candidates than a qualified
endorsement of abortion rights.
Hearing that Arkansas Gov. Bill
Clinton signed a bill requiring
parental notification and former
California Gov. Jerry Brown has
made statements opposing abor
tion, it's easy to see where student
fears originate.
And President Bush's record is
no better, with his spineless fluctu
ation between instituting and
revoking the gag rule on doctors at
federally funded clinics.
What many students want is a
candidate who will talk straight
about how he will help women
when Roe vs. Wade is overturned
by urging Congress to pass pro
choice legislation.
He must also advocate channelling
federal aid to poor women in states
that criminalize abortion so they can
get legal, safe abortions elsewhere.
Naturally, students have broader
interests and concerns than these
two issues.
Yet empty slogans and mud
slinging are not enough to solidify
student support and send them
flocking to the polls. Intelligent
politicians will pick up the scent of
dissatisfaction and act swiftly to
lure them with substance rather
than rhetoric.
