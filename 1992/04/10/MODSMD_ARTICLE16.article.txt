Negotiation should have replaced skateboarder ban

THE GAPS IN Stanford's vision of
multiculturalism and its policy of
inclusion are showing through as
the University takes steps to ban skate
boarders.
I myself do not skateboard. But this
university supposedly intends to teach
me to respect cultures, ideas and values
although they may be different from my
own.
Well, I respect the culture, ideas and
values of skateboarders, and am sad
dened by the intolerance demonstrated
toward them.
One of the frail reasons given for the
ban is that the skateboarders cause dam
age. Exactly what kind of damage occurs
when plastic or flesh impacts concrete or
stone? I have seen many skateboarders
fall and bruise themselves, but I have
yet to see a pavement get black and blue

marks.
The damage done by skateboarding
must be trivial compared to that left by
thousands of bikes and rollerblades on
campus. Cars and vans leave behind far
more annihilated landscape and pollu
tion.
Are skateboarders dangerous? My
personal experience with the skateboard
ing community has always been a posi
tive one. When I have ridden in the path
of a skateboard, it is the skateboarder
who has politely stopped.
I tend to dawdle near the ramp by the
post office as I look through my mail,
and have never been struck or
approached with hostility by a skate
boarder. In contrast, I've been hit by
oblivious bikers who had forgotten that
their brakes don't work in the rain and
who never turn back to apologize.

I've had several near misses, both on
foot and bike, with drivers doing 50
miles per hour on Campus Drive East,
and who apparently believe the stop
signs don't apply to them. In the end, I
have had more squirrels than skate
boarders run recklessly into my way.
How much of a noise problem are the
skateboarders? For the past two quar
ters my classes have been in rooms with
windows open to the interior of the
Quad. Occasionally there has been noise.
But by the same token, people speaking
loudly or laughing outside posed a simi
lar problem better solved by discourse
than by a police force.
In the end, the ban is the worst kind
of useless law: alienating, divisive, unen
forceable and a waste of money. The
time and effort required to impose it
would be better spent investigating the

Bookstore.
Since Stanford intends to teach us to
discuss problems rather than beat one
another up, I'm sure the University can
achieve a satisfactory negotiated settle
ment.
Perhaps something as simple as a
mutual agreement to post and obey a
"Quiet, please. Class in progress" sign in
affected areas could be effective. A little
communication and creative thinking
will go a lot farther and be more lasting
than a police clampdown.
Both Stanford and I claim to believe
in tolerance, multiculturalism and the
rights of the minority. Allowing skate
boarders to remain unmolested will
show that there is some substance
behind our high and flowery words.
