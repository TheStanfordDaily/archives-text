# Letter on peace process unfair to Palestinians
## 
### 
Prof. John Felstiner's April 8 letter
charges that Paul Namphy's recent col
umn on Palestinian-Israeli peace
unfairly places "blame and burden . . .
on Israel alone."
Felstiner asserts that Namphy's
"historical amnesia" prevents him from
depicting Israel's Arab neighbors in
their true light.
Felstiner, by drawing attention to an
"unrelentingly hostile" group of Arab
states, attempts to detract from the
core of the issue: ending the occupation
and resolving the Palestinian question.
He repeatedly identifies "the Arabs"
as a monolithic group, thereby convey
ing the image that Israel plays an
underdog Etarid to the Arab Goliath,
which is "600 times her area and 50
times her population."
What he neglects to mention is that
in 1992 geography and demographics

have little relevance to a state's ability
to defend itself.
Furthermore, by semantically sweep
ing the people of Palestine into this
contrived Arab monolith, Felstiner
ignores the distinct existence of the
Palestinians and dismisses them as a
function of an "unrelentingly hostile"
group.
Felstiner denounces "the rejection
ism of Palestinian leaders" as con
tributing to Palestinian suffering.
I would like to know what criteria
led him to the verdict of "rejectionist,"
as in the current peace talks the Palis
tinians have made numerous conces
sions and consistently have adopted a
conciliatory stance.
In the end, it is cooperation despite
mutual distrust that can lead to a ter
mination of this conflict. Pointing fin
gers only prolongs the current state
of affairs; the quest for the moral
upper hand is anathematic to concili
ation.
