# University encourages greediness and elitism
## 
### 
I am ashamed to be associated with
this University.
We allegedly have some of the
brightest minds in the country, but
we are no better off for it. Most of us
do not have, and will never have, wis
dom.
I had a friend visit a few nights ago.
She — by mistake and for the first time
ever — parked in one of the Escondido
Village parking slots marked with an
almost unreadable apartment number.
Someone responded by letting the air
out of her tires.
Humanity has had thousands of years
to grow up. Most of us are still in
kindergarten.
I would like to believe that Stanford
teaches us something useful, but all I
see is arrogance. For example, people
who intentionally humiliate someone
trying to give a presentation of their

research.
Stanford, especially at the graduate
level, is proud of the fact that it only let
in a small percentage of those who
applied.
But, instead, they should be ashamed
that they cannot admit everyone who
desires to attend.
Yet I can't blame them for this. I fully
understand Stanford's position — we
have a reputation to uphold.
After all, only competition breeds pro
ductivity and brings out the best in all of
us.
Most of us don't care about making
the world a better place.
Most of us simply want to be "the
best." Stanford and every other institu
tion that I can think of condones and
breeds the business of financial and
intellectual self-gratification at any
expense.
I would like to find the value in all
that we have done, but I have my stock
options to attend to.
