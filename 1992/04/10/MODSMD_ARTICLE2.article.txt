# Rosse's final Fac Sen has familiar theme — budgets
## 
### Howard Libit Steve McCarroll Senior staff writers 
Provost James Rosse presented
details of the 1992-93 operating budget
at his last Faculty Senate meeting yes
terday afternoon.
Although many faculty asked tech
nical questions about the University's
financial outlook, few new details were
revealed that were not included in the
original document.
The only significant revelation
involved the tax on restricted-funds
expenditures.
The charge — which would relieve
the burden that targeted contributions
place on the operating budget by requir
ing donations to cover the indirect costs
associated with designated projects —
still remains in "considerable flux,"
Rosse said. But he added that it would

likely be a 10 percent tax.
Despite questions by several faculty
members, Rosse refused to specify
what indirect-cost rate the University
is planning for in next year's budget.
The budget's projected income from
indirect costs depends on the new rate
and the date on which it is negotiated,
as well as expected research volume.
The budget does not specify assump
tions made about these variables, and
University officials will not comment on
them while negotiations are ongoing.
"I am not going to tell you when the
rate will be negotiated, what we are
assuming or even the expected
research volume," Rosse said. "It is a
matter of the negotiating process."
At the end of Rosse's presentation,
Engineering Prof. Ross Shachter
explained his dissatisfaction with the
results of this year's $43-million
deficit-reduction process.

"Our goals clearly called for the
avoidance of 'across-the-board' cuts,
but increasingly the process evolved
into efforts to 'share the pain,' "


James Rosse
Shachter said. "We have diluted
our strengths rather than focused
them. Until we make some of
these difficult choices, our prob
lems will persist."
But Political Science Prof.
Stephen Krasner said it was
"incredibly difficult to know the
consequences of our actions.... It is

critical to monitor and check what
we have done."
The meeting concluded with a
warm tribute to Rosse, who is
leaving the University next week
to become the president and chief
executive of Freedom Newspa
pers, Inc., based in Irvine, Calif.
Rosse received a standing ova
tion from the senate as well as a
worldband radio.
"Nothing is more enduring
than the affection, admiration and
esteem of your colleagues," Senate

Chair James Sheehan said.
Before the senate began its bud
get discussion, Council of Presi
dents member John Overdeck crit
icized the recent ordinance that
banned recreational skateboarding
at Stanford.
The decision to seek a prohibi
tion was "one of the easiest deci
sions we've ever made," University
President Donald Kennedy said.
Kennedy said administrators
have received an "avalanche" of
complaints about noise, damage to

property and "risk to life and limb."
Art Prof. Albert Elsen added
"damage to art" to the list of
grievances. The skaters ride over the
falcon sculpture at the Law School,
scraping and breaking it, he said.
Kennedy expressed regret that
the ban will also affect Stanford
students who "use skateboards
quite responsibly to commute."
"This is a case of a significant
number of people abusing the
privilege and making it quite
untenable to the others," he said.
