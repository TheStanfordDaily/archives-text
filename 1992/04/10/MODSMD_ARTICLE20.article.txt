## Is apartheid over at last? 
### 
Africa week is here, and
along with all of the spectacular
and insightful programs sched
uled for next week comes the opportu
nity to contemplate what is transpir
ing on the continent where the human
race originated.
The current geopolitical reality, fea
turing a realignment of forces after the
Cold War's end, has had pervasive effects
worldwide. Even South Africa — which
through the implementation of apartheid
had become a bastion of institutionalized
racism — has not been immune to
change, Stanford Africanists and South
African students agree.
Although they see the results of the
recent referendum as positive, many
have no illusions about the pressures
behind the results of the vote. Senior
Omphemetse Mooki, a microbiology and
immunology major from Montshiba,
South Africa, believes the results are due
to a major post-Cold War policy changes
among Western powers.
The West, no longer perceiving the
"Soviet threat" to the Cape Sea Route,
may be more willing to act against the
minority government and the racist sys
tem that it has upheld.
The vote reflects fear among whites of
the potential international consequences
of opposing F.W. De Klerk's reform pro
cess, rather than a strong conviction on
their part that blacks should participate in
the governing of the country, Mooki says.

So does Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, a specialist on South Africa.
But Abernethy would like to see the press
place more emphasis on South Africa's
dire economic problems, such as high
unemployment, and injustices such as
skewed land distribution.
South African students emphasized the
need for the future majority government
to tackle issues such as the endemic pover
ty plaguing South Africa's rural home
lands, if it wants to retain the confidence
of the black people and avoid disaster.
Both Abernethy and senior Owen
Maubane, an economics major from Pre
toria, foresee a difficult bind for the
African National Congress, which most
experts predict will be the driving force
behind the new majority government.
They believe the ANC will have to
compromise between the political goal of
providing an equitable future for the
country s black majority while not
adopting policies that would alienate
capitalists, mostly white South Africans
or foreigners. Such capitalists will be
instrumental in the future recovery of
the economy.
Law Prof. William Gould sees the ref
erendum as the beginning of "serious,
good faith bargaining for South Africa"
within the framework of the Conference
for a Democratic South Africa. He wel
comes moves toward the establishment
of a broad-based interim government,
which he said would be formed within

several months.
There is controversy concerning the
role of sanctions in pushing the minority
government toward reform and their pos
sible detrimental effect on future econom
ic recovery. Yet many South Africans,
including junior Fundisile Mbangi, a biol
ogy major from the homeland of Transkei,
caution against Western powers moving
too quickly toward easing them.
He stressed the need for "guarded
optimism" after the referendum, saying
that pressure on De Klerk's government
must continue to promote the reform
process through to its end.
Indeed, as South Africans point out,
South Africa is still a race-based society.
Over four decades after the United
Nations Charter affirming human rights,
and 30 years after the wave that brought
independence to most African nations,
blacks are still denied the right to vote.
The Stanford community, while eager
ly following the events that will eventual
ly lead to the political enfranchisement of
South Africa's black majority, must not
forget this.
