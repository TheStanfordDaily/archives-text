## Batters face important test in ASU 
### Mike Langford Staff Writer 
The members of the Stanford
baseball team find themselves at a
crossroads. Following a streak
where it lost six of seven, includ
ing a sweep by Cal, the Cardinal
slipped from five to 13 in the Base
ball America rankings, and in Col
legiate Baseball from 12 to never
never land. Stanford is now 7-8 in
the Six-Pac, and tied for fourth.
With a 21-14 record, the Card sud
denly looks very mortal, and is at
the point where they have to win
to stay in contention for the Six-
Pac title. It's do or die. This is
what separates the men from the
boys. Here's where the stuff hits
the fan.
And to get back in contention,
Stanford could not wish for a bet
ter opponent, namely Arizona
State. The Sun Devils are cur
rently 24-12 overall, and 9-6 in
the conference play, good enough
for first place. But the Card, even
in fourth, is only two games out,
which makes this weekend's
series against the men from
Tempe an extremely interesting
and crucial one.
"Since [the conference race] is
so close, we know that the team
who makes the least mistakes
from here on out [should win it],"
said Stanford senior left-fielder
Dave Cornell.
And it is close. Three games
separate the field, and only two
games separate the top five. After
this weekend's series, the confer
ence leader could be anyone
(except sixth-place Cal), and it is
therefore important that Stan
ford does well.
"We have to take two out of
three," said Brian Sackinsky.
"It's not the end of the world if we
don't, but it'll be pretty close."
"We've faced them before, and
we have to use that to our advan
tage," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess.
And in that previous meeting,
a three-game series at Arizona
State, Stanford took two of three,
using great and timely hitting to
beat the Sun Devils. However,

since that time, Stanford has
slipped a bit in the team pitching
and hitting departments, while
the Sun Devils are hitting a team
.325 in Six-Pac play.
Arizona is currently led by
Brett Weinberger who, is hitting
.409 in 66 at bats. Meanwhile,
nine other Sun Devils are hitting
over .300, including iron man
shortstop Kurt Ehmann (.354, 24
RBI, 3 HR's) who is hitting .394
in Six-Pac play, superfrosli
Antone Williamson (.338, 28, 1)
who was rated in the preseason as

the best frosh, Scott Samuels
(.307, 35, 10) who is among the
best power hitters in the confer
ence, Todd Stevenson (.305, 30, 7)
who is currently in the midst of a
14 game hitting streak, and Doug
Newstrom (.308, 27, 5) who also
happens to be one of Arizona
State's top pitchers.
Along with Newtrom's 3.58
ERA and 6-2 record, the Sun Dev
ils have Jeff Matranga, who
sports a 3.48 ERA and a 7-2
record with five complete games.
Then there's Sean Lowe, who is 6-

2 with a 3.98 ERA and an excel
lent 79 strikeouts in 72.3 innings
pitched.
Stanford, on the other hand,
hasn't played stellar ball as of
late. The pitching has not been
what it should, either in starting
or relieving performances. And
while Stanford has been accumu
lating hits throughout its games,
they have not been bunching
them together, translating into
isolated, untimely hits which

And he's ... safe! Mark Skeels almost made the play last Friday against California, but he dropped the
ball and the runner scored. The Stanford baseball team will try to move back into conference title con
tention this weekend against Arizona State at Sunken Diamond.
