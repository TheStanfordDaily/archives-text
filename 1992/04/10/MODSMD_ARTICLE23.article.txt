# We want hockey!

### 
Believe it or not, I care
that the National Hock
ey League players are on
strike. In fact, I'm mad as hell.
And I know I'm not the only
one. Hockey paraphernalia
sales are up all over the state.
I've been in Oakland for a pair
of baseball games this week,
and I can assure you that every
one there is a hockey fan. Well,
at least the teenage youth are.
They had hockey baseball caps,
hockey shirts, hockey Starter
jackets, matching shoes — the
whole works. What puzzled me
most was that their favorite
skaters were invariably the
L.A. Kings .. . and why did all
these hockey fans seem to be
partial to the White Sox and
Raiders? I had to ask:
Enquiring Mind: "Hey
young chap, I know the NHL
strike has you feeling glum,
but I was wondering if you
could tell me why you're such,
Kings fan."
Scowling, Hispanic,
Uninterested Teen with
Ugly Pumas: "Man, who the
&@#s* are you? Get outta my
face before I . .
EM: "Uh, well, is it because
you feel Wayne Gretzky is a
perfect role model?"
SHUT UP: "Listen, fool. I
don't know any Shelle and I
don't know any Wayne. Do
yourself a favor and beat it."
The Kings dilemma unre
solved, there are plenty of rea
sons to be fuming about the
strike. For one, too many
deserving teams aren't getting
their chance to celebrate the
season with a postseason
appearance. Take the Toronto
Maple Leafs, for example.
After winning an impressive
five of their first 30, the Leafs
had been on a second half tear.
And with a hefty 29 wins in 67
games when the strike struck,
they found themselves only
two wins from the playoffs.
Making the playoffs with a
.443 winning percentage? Too
bad the Pac-10 doesn't adopt
the NHL stance, then even the
Weenie cagers could make the
playoffs every year — without
Jason (it took me three times
to crack 700 on the SAT) Kidd.
The worst part about the
strike is the empty feeling the
fans are left with. It's bad
enough for us Yanks. But the

Canadians are especially hard
hit. "They can take away our
Mounties, they can take away
our Moosehead, but hockey?
Now they've got an uproar on
their hands, eh" promised a
particularly disgruntled hoser.
Wait. Maybe there is hope.
You also have to feel sorry
for any group of fans with such
a lively/tolerant sense of
humor. The PC police have def
initely not made their way to

Great White North. The lead
ers of the Smythe division
when play halted were the
Vancouver Canucks. A Canuck,
you ask? "Offensive, slang.
derogatory reference to a
French Canadian."
Last October in the States,
the "Tomahawk Chop" pro
voked the most pressing sports
controversy since Steve Gar
vey's last lovechild. The Cana
dian NHL contingent might as
well be the Calgary Honkees,
Winnipeg Sambos and the
Ottowa Hymies. The diehards
deserve a break.
"But you know, Ted, it all
boils down to one thing: big
money is corrupting the sys
tem. The owners are just
exploiting the players, the play
ers are the little guys. Someone
needs to stand up for the little
guys. They're out on the
streets now — they have no
money, no jobs, no teeth. I'm
the man who will be there for
them, I want to 'Take Back the
NHL.' I want to cleanse the
system of these rich, influen
tial owners who are running all
over us. They're all princes of
sleaze. This was our league,
North America! If you want to
help me make it ours again . . .
