# Track hosts first two-hour match
## 
### Nick Clements Staff writer 
Stanford's head track and
field coach Brooks Johnson has
always been regarded as one of
the great innovators in the
sport. The 1984 Summer
Olympics women's coach will be
showing one of the reasons why
this Saturday in the Cardinal's
home meet against Nevada.
Most track and field meets,
since they are combined
between men and women, take
up to four to five hours and often
proceed in a chaotic fashion as
two or three events are held at
the same time. The entire
nature of a track meet can often
leave the amateur spectator con
fused and frustrated.
This Saturday though,
Johnson and the rest of the
Stanford coaching and officiat
ing staff will be at the helm of
its first ever two-hour com
bined men and women's track
and field meet. The number of
events will be significantly
slimmed down in the interests
of presenting a meet that is
much more "spectator-friend
ly", where the average fan can
see an entire track meet with
out it taking up the entire day.
Assistant coach Scott
Chisam said that the Cardinal
tried something similar to this
in an Oregon meet last year.
"The fans just loved it .... I
think this meet will be a
tremendous success. Maybe
we're going to see a new trend
in track and field."
The official combined meet
will kick off at 1:30 p.m. in the
Stanford Stadium and will last
until about 3:30 p.m. However,
NCAA qualifier Dave Popejoy
and the rest of the hammer
throw crew will begin separate
ly at 12:30 p.m. at Angel Field.
All fans will be admitted free.

The Cardinal has been
enjoying both individual and
team success as of late. The
women's team captured second
place at the NCAA Indoor
Championships in mid-March
despite sending only Chryste
Gaines and Jackie Edwards to
represent the team. Gaines,
who has been blowing her
opponents away in the 100-
meter dash this spring and is
favored to win both the Pacific
10 Conference and the NCAA
Outdoor Championships in the
event, will instead run the 200-
meter dash this Saturday.
Susan Helfter, another out
standing member of the wo
men's team, will be running in
both the 400- and the 800-
meter events, which will only
give her a 20-minute break
between the two competitions.
Discus thrower Pat Stowell
will be attempting to continue
his undefeated college streak at
home. Stowell will have his
hands full in competing against
Kami Kasmirie, the defending
NCAA discus champion.
"After the Texas Relays last
week (where Stowell finished
eighth despite feeling sick), Pat
came back and had one of his
best weight workouts of the sea
son," Chisam said. "That's the
kind of competitor he is. He's
got some Todd Lichti in him."
Freshman sensation Travis
Clark, who high-jumped 6-feet
-10 last weekend in Texas, will
make his seasonal debut in the
400-meter dash. Clark has
been training in the event with
Olympic hopefuls Butch
Reynolds and Jim Cramton.
Also watch for Alex Accetta,
who will be running the 1500-
meter run.
"Alex will be going for a 3:42
in the 1500, which is the equiv
alent of breaking four minutes
in the mile," Chisam said.
