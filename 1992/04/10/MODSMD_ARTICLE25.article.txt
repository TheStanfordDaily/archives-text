# Tennis faces limping Wildcats, Sun Devils
## 
### Brian Egan Editorial staff 
After decisively defeating a
tough Fresno State squad Tues
day, the Stanford men's tennis
team (15-1 on the season) looks to
continue its winning ways this
weekend as it faces Arizona
(today at 1:30 p.m.) and Arizona
State (tomorrow at 1 p.m.) at the
Stanford Tennis Stadium.
While neither of the Arizona
schools is currently ranked in the
national top-25, Cardinal coach
Dick Gould stressed that both
matches will be challenging.
"[Arizona and Arizona State]
are dangerous teams as is," he
said. "And they'll be even better
when they're healthy."
Injuries have definitely been
the story of the year for both of
Stanford's weekend opponents.
The Wildcats (9-7) will be without
the services of No. 1 singles star
Ringo Naravossa. The senior,
who defeated former Cardinal
standout Jared Palmer in
straight sets last season, is side
lined for the rest of 1992 with a
painful back injury.
But even without their top sin
gles player, Arizona should pose a
legitimate threat to top-ranked
Stanford.
"Naravossa's a real dangerous
player," Gould said. "But [the
Wildcats] played us tough last
time without him. We had a good
match with Arizona last time out."

Stanford's March 28 match in
Tuscon was definitely much clos
er than the 7-2 final score indicat
ed. Five of the event's nine
matches were decided by a third
set, and Cardinal sophomore
Vimal Patel picked up his only
singles loss of the year against
Arizona.
While the Wildcats have been
hurt by Naravossa's absence, Ari
zona State's entire squad has
been affected by injuries.
"ASU has been decimated by
injuries all year," Gould said.
"Their team is in a bit of disarray
right now."
The Sun Devils, who reached
the quarterfinals of the NCAA
Tournament in 1991, were
trounced by Stanford in Tempe
in a 70-minute match which
Gould described as "a devastat
ing performance."
Ranked No. 17 in the presea
son, Arizona State is led by junior
Chris Gambino and senior Ross
Matheson.
The Cardinal itself is a much
improved squad heading into
their final home weekend match
es of the season. After dropping
their first dual match of the sea
son, a grueling 5-4 loss to USC,
Sunday, Stanford rebounded
with an impressive 8-1 win over
Fresno State Tuesday. Every
Cardinal regular starter won
handily against the Bulldogs,

including the first doubles
tandems of Alex O'Brien and
Chris Cocotos (No. 15 in the
country), and Jason Yee and Patel
at No. 2 doubles.
These two doubles pairs, along
with third-ranked Michael Flana
gan and Robert Devens, have been
the driving force behind Stanford's
recent improvements, according to
Gould. "(Last weekend) was the
first time I really felt that we could

compete with anyone up and down
the lineup. I felt that we were a sec
ond-five (No. 6 to No. 10) squad
coming in to the year, but we've
showed recently that we can com
pete with anyone."
Card notes
Gould said he was particularly
impressed with the tremendous fan
support last weekend during the USC
and UCLA matches, saying that "it
gives us a real home court advan
tage." O'Brien remained at No. 2 in
the latest singles rankings, while
Flanagan moved up a notch in the
ladder to No. 15.
