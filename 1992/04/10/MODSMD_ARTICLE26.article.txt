# Women netters take on Golden Bears at Cal
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
The difference between the women's tennis
match at Cal Sunday and the one Stanford
hosted February 16 may be like night and day
— or rain and shine.
The last time the No. 2 Cardinal and No. 8
Bears clashed, showers interrupted the
matches at least three times and extended the
contest over two days. Though Stanford won,
Cal took the Cardinal to doubles. The Bears
are one of only a few squads to make Stanford
play significant doubles this year.
Cal may have that chance again. The Bears
recently edged No. 6 UCLA and will probably
be more competitive in the several slots that
they were thumped in during the last contest.
Senior Lisa Albano, Cal's top player and
national preseason No. 1, was blitzed by junior
Heather Willens 6-0, 6-1 two months ago.
Albano's unforced errors, as well as Willens'

tough play, contributed to the blowout. This
began Albano's slide down the rankings to the
20s.
She has since rebounded to No. 13 and may
challenge Willens.
Other matches will definitely be different
from the previous Big Match. In February
sophomore Kristine Kurth didn't compete in

singles but made her Cardinal dual-match
debut in doubles. While Kurth is still ham
pered by the strained lower back that kept her
out of the last clash, she is in the singles line
up for Sunday.
"Kristine played [Fridayl and it wasn't too
bad," said coach Frank Brennan. Though the
injury forced Kurth to serve
underhand in recent contests, she
was 2-0 in Los Angeles.
"We're in a holding pattern
right now," Brennan said. "We're
trying to get as much practice as
we can without hurting anyone.
We do something, ask 'How does
that feel? OK. Then let's do some

more."
While the Cardinal has gotten
Kurth back, the squad has lost
Emma Woodhouse. The sopho
more is still nursing a hamstring
pull and will be out an for unde
terminable period of time.
The Bears won't get a chance
to beat Woodhouse and they have
barely better odds on defeating
Laxmi Poruri. The sophomore
has racked up an 18-1 record.
"She's more aggressive and
consistent," said Brennan, who

compared her current play to last
year's. "She's totally different,
100 percent better. She could be
one of the best players in the
country." The Volvo Tennis/Col
legiate Rankings agreed. Poruri
climbed to No. 5 in the latest poll.
Doubles is a question mark for
Stanford. With Woodhouse's
injury, the Cardinal's No. 2 team
— and the No. 14 tandem in the
nation — is halved. Senior Kylie
Johnson, Woody's partner, has
been paired with Kurth for the

time being.
Kurth had previously been
paired with freshman Amy
Chiminello at No. 3 doubles.
To make the game of musical
doubles complete, Chiminello will
be teamed with junior Mario Car
ruth, an early season partner of
hers.
"They played well together
early in the year and already have
a bit of a record so we're comfort
able with them at No. 3," Bren
nan said.
