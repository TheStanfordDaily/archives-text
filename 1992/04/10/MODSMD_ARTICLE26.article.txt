matches at least three times and extended the
contest over two days. Though Stanford won,
Cal took the Cardinal to doubles. The Bears
are one of only a few squads to make Stanford
play significant doubles this year.
Cal may have that chance again. The Bears
recently edged No. 6 UCLA and will probably
be more competitive in the several slots that
they were thumped in during the last contest.
Senior Lisa Albano, Cal's top player and
national preseason No. 1, was blitzed by junior
Heather Willens 6-0, 6-1 two months ago.
Albano's unforced errors, as well as Willens'

tough play, contributed to the blowout. This
began Albano's slide down the rankings to the
20s.
She has since rebounded to No. 13 and may
challenge Willens.
