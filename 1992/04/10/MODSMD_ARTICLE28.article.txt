# Gymnastics goes to regionals at Cal
## 
### Brandi Shipp Staff Writer 
After a season of ups and downs,
impressive wins and close losses, the
Stanford women's gymnastics team will
face the biggest challenge of the year
thus far Saturday, as they head up north
to Berkeley for the NCAA Regional
Championships, the final bridge to cross
before the National Championships.
Currently ranked at No. 15, higher
than at any previous point of the season,
the gymnasts have proven all year that,
despite their youth and relatively small
size, they can soundly compete with,
and even beat, anyone who may step in
their path to the Nationals.
Despite the fact that the nine-woman
squad consists of eight freshmen and
sophomores, they have been smashing
previous Stanford records all season,
including having bettered the school
record for team total three times.
Despite all of their success through
out the year, the Regional Champi
onships could prove to be the most
important meet of the season for the
determined and talented Cardinal
squad. If their point total is high enough

to qualify them within the top 12 teams
in the country, they will continue on to
the National Championships to be held
at the end of this month in Minnesota.
Stanford has sent individual quali
fiers to the Nationals in the past years
but the women's gymnastics program
has never before had an entire team
qualify. Despite the task, the team feels
that they can rise to the challenge.
"We are in great spirits," said freshman
Jene Elzie. "Our goal for the meet is to hit
24 out of 24 routines and to do our best."
Even with all of their talent and
determination to struggle to the top,
tomorrow's competition is not an easy
obstacle to overcome. At the Regionals,
the Cardinal squad will face off against
six other teams: Oregon State, UCLA,
UC-Santa Barbara, California, Boise
State, and Washington.
Although the Stanford team has met
many of these teams earlier in the year
in head-to-head competition, they are
not looking to their past meets for any
insight into tomorrow's competition.
"We are going into this meet with a
blank slate," Elzie said. "Those teams
have changed and we have changed, so
our other meets don't mean anything."

One benefit for the Cardinal team
that could make a impressionable differ
ence in their performance is the close
proximity of the Regional competition to
the Stanford campus. The Cardinal
team and coaches are hoping that the
Stanford fans, who have enthusiastical
ly supported them throughout the sea
son, will come out for one last showing
of spirit on Saturday.
Surprisingly enough, a group of Stan
ford fans at an away meet can have a
great impression on the team.
"In the last two away meets, we had a
group of Stanford fans, which really
made the girls feel at home. We scored
two of the highest scores all season,"
said assistant coach Lisa Mitzel-Izzi.
"Just to have a group of our fans yelling
and cheering for the team makes a sig
nificant difference in their confidence."
Despite the fierce challenge ahead of
them, coaches Breck Greenwood and
Mitzel-Izzi feel very confident in their
team's ability to come through.
"We've spent a lot of energy focusing
on the skills that we do best, executing
them perfectly and believing in our
selves. It really is 90% mental at this
point in the game," Mitzel-Izzi said.
