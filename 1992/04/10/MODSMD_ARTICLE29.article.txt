# Crew has home dual meet
## 
### Mike McDonough 
The men and women of the Stanford
crew team will hope to continue the Stan
ford championship tradition this year as
they host a dual meet with Sacramento
State in Redwood City this Saturday at 9
a.m. The Stanford women occupy third
place in the Pacific Coast League, behind
league-leading Washington and rival Cali
fornia, while the men are also third in
their division, behind Washington and
UCLA.
"We should do well at Sac State," said
women's head coach Wendy Davis. "But
we went through a big letdown after San
Diego State. If we go in la-de-da, we could
be in trouble."
Davis expects the team to use both this
and upcoming UC-Davis regattas as
much-needed tuneups for the Potomac
regatta in two weeks, where the Cardinal
can expect to see the likes of powerhouses
such as Yale, Cambridge, Northeastern,
and Cornell. Senior Bonnie Baker, a
potential Olympic contender for the U.S.
women's crew team, will lead the talented
Cardinal into its second week of league
competition.
As for the men, they face similar com

petition on the West Coast. Stanford,
Washington, and UCLA are all within five
seconds of each other in the Pacific Coast
League, and the league title should be up
for grabs.
"We think we have a good shot at the
title," said men's head coach Wieslaw
Kujda. "It all depends how much we
improve in this two weeks."
Sacramento State and Davis next week
should give the Cardinal the chance they
seek, as they too prepare for the big East
Coast regatta on the Potomac.
"Cornell should be on top there,"
Kujda said, "but we're looking to qualify
for the final. We're talking about eight to
ten seconds we need to lose, and that's up
to [the team]."
Senior Steve Voorhis agrees with this
assessment of the team's chances.
"Going to the finals is a legitimate shot
for us," Voorhis said. "This year was
intended to be a rebuilding year, but we
feel like we can make a run for it."
Voorhis noted that the team tends to
improve more than other schools
throughout the year, and hopes the Cardi
nal will peak for the Pacific Coast Cham
pionships, where the title should be decid
ed between Cal, UCLA, and Stanford.
