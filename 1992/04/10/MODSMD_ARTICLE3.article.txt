# Students dive into fall campaign races
## 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
At a school where Bart Simpson
was elected to the graduate student
senate and a slate known as "I Pre
fer Not to Have a COP" is a con
tender for the student govern
ment's highest office, many consid
er "political activism" an oxymoron.
But national and state politics
are catching the interest of many
Stanford students, and as pri
maries draw near, apathy is giving
way to activity.
While campus Republicans are
focusing on the local congression
al race, groups of Democrats are
separately amassing support for
presidential candidates Jerry
Brown and Bill Clinton.

effort on campus.


AJ Green — Daily
Enchanted Broccoli Forest resident Christy Lichtendahi makes a poster in support of
former California Gov. Jerry Brown's bid for president. She is one of many Stanford stu
dents who have become active in the various election campaigns taking place this year.
Fourteen students supporting
Brown in his bid for the Demo
cratic presidential nomination
met for the first time this week to
organize pro-Brown activities on
campus. While some of the partic
ipants were seasoned activists,
most characterized themselves as
newcomers to the political scene
and appeared somewhat sur
prised to find themselves at a
political meeting.
"This is the first political cam
paign I've considered working
for," said Flora Lu, a junior. "But
I like his environmental policy."
"I'm a Republican myself," said
sophomore Brian Brennan. "And
while I think there's been a lot of
value in the last 12 years, it's time
to move on. I like Brown's values
and morals a lot."
Rafe Sagarin, a sophomore
majoring in Earth Systems, orga
nized the meeting. "I — like many
people — am frustrated with the
'one party system,' " he said. "We
need someone who is concerned
about the environment, someone
who will take a few risks."
The group is planning a "grass
roots" campaign on campus, mod
eled after Brown's national cam
paign. Members are organizing an
e-mail campaign, a chalkboard cam
paign and a door-to-door campaign.
"In keeping with our environ
mental views, we'd like to keep
paper and flier use to a mini
mum," Sagarin said. "We'll try to
use creative advertising."
In addition, they plan to regis
ter voters and pass out Brown
information in White Plaza, and
also hope to schedule an appear
ance by Brown on campus shortly
before the May 4 deadline for
voter registration.
Support for Clinton
Junior Sheryl Glubok, an
Arkansas native, has longstanding
ties to Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton.
In high school, Clinton
appointed her to a state task force
on teenage pregnancy. When she
went home for winter break,
Glubok visited his campaign
headquarters and has been work
ing on the campaign ever since.
Glubok and a core group of
about 10 undergraduates, sup
ported by about 30 others, have
founded a group called "Stanford

Students for Bill Clinton." They
began distributing information
packets on Clinton last quarter
and will work to register voters
this quarter, according to Glubok,
who is coordinating the effort.
Glubok and several other stu
dents are trying to become dele
gates to the National Democratic
Convention. The students must
submit an application and make a
speech at the congressional dis
trict caucus at the end of April.
Other members of the Stan
ford Democrats and the newly
formed Law School Democratic
Club will be traveling to Los
Angeles this weekend for the
state Democratic convention,
where they will endorse senate
candidates and do organizational
work for Students for Clinton,
according to Alison Tucher, a
third-year law student.
According to former Stanford
Democrats chair Kevin Hartz, the
club as a whole is not supposed to
endorse candidates. However, the
group has been involved in educa
tional programs such as mock
debates in dorms this year.
Republicans focus on locals
Active campaigning for Republi
can presidential candidates on cam
pus has been minimal, as the College
Republicans have been focusing on
the local congressional campaign.
"There's not much to do yet on
the national campaign," said
senior Paul Garrett, chair of the
College Republicans.
But a group called Republicans
for Choice, which supports abor
tion rights, has been registering
voters on campus, he said. Indi
vidual students have also been
working on local campaigns, doing
fund-raising and other work.
"We're also organizing a
debate between the Congressional
candidates in the 14th district,"
said Garrett.
The debate will be held at the
end of the month and should
include all five Republican candi
dates: Dixon Arnett, Tom Huen
ing, Mike Maibach, Bill Quraishi
and Paul Biddle.
On the campaign trail
Sophomore Jordan Kantor
canceled his spring break plans at
the last minute to work for the
Brown campaign in his home
state of New York.
While Kantor said he decided
to join the cause for a week "to see

how adults organize themselves
and to see how a campaign
works," he soon became a Brown
convert himself.
"My mom had called Jerry's
800 number," Kantor said. "The
Brown campaign organization
asked if we had a bed to spare . ..
and Kathee Godette, the national
coordinator for outreach and con
stituency groups [for Brown]
ended up staying at our house
throughout the New York cam
paign. I talked to her on the
phone, and she invited me to
come shadow her for a week."
Kantor's spring break offered
little rest and relaxation, but
proved educational, he said.
"I learned more in that week
them you would in a year-long
poli-sci class," he said.
Kantor accompanied Brown to a
private meeting with the executive
editors of Time-Life, helped orga
nize rallies and did some research.
He was impressed by the rapid
organizational skills required in a
campaign.
"I watched them plan a day just
like that," said Kantor, snapping
his fmgers. "It was amazing, the
delegation of responsibilities and
the fact that the next day, all the
things happened."
The relationship between
money and campaigning became
clear to Kantor when he visited
Clinton's headquarters. Brown
has capped contributions to his
campaign at $100. The legal limit
is $1,000.
"Brown set up his New York
headquarters in a decrepit build
ing near the Port Authority. We
had no phones, jio FAX, no
copiers, and the toilets were over
flowing. People were coming in
and physically donating phones,"
said Kantor. "But Clinton's place
was totally different, ... a bunch
of yuppies in a nice building."
Kantor said he was astonished
at the sabotage outside groups
were waging on Brown's campaign
and was frustrated by the opposi
tion's television advertisements.
"I was mute to defend him,"
Kantor said.
Although his roommate and
others call Brown "Captain
Moonbeam" and chastise Kantor
for supporting him, Kantor isn't
deterred.
"I have met Jerry Brown the
person, and I believe in him," said
Kantor. "It's OK to have a brain
and like Jerry Brown."

roots" campaign on campus, mod
eled after Brown's national cam
paign. Members are organizing an
e-mail campaign, a chalkboard cam
paign and a door-to-door campaign.
"In keeping with our environ
mental views, we'd like to keep
paper and flier use to a mini
mum," Sagarin said. "We'll try to
use creative advertising."
In addition, they plan to regis
ter voters and pass out Brown
information in White Plaza, and
also hope to schedule an appear
ance by Brown on campus shortly
before the May 4 deadline for
voter registration.
Support for Clinton
Junior Sheryl Glubok, an
Arkansas native, has longstanding
ties to Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton.
In high school, Clinton
appointed her to a state task force
on teenage pregnancy. When she
went home for winter break,
Glubok visited his campaign
headquarters and has been work
ing on the campaign ever since.
Glubok and a core group of
about 10 undergraduates, sup
ported by about 30 others, have
founded a group called "Stanford

Students for Bill Clinton." They
began distributing information
packets on Clinton last quarter
and will work to register voters
this quarter, according to Glubok,
who is coordinating the effort.
Glubok and several other stu
dents are trying to become dele
gates to the National Democratic
Convention. The students must
submit an application and make a
speech at the congressional dis
trict caucus at the end of April.
Other members of the Stan
ford Democrats and the newly
formed Law School Democratic
Club will be traveling to Los
Angeles this weekend for the
state Democratic convention,
where they will endorse senate
candidates and do organizational
work for Students for Clinton,
according to Alison Tucher, a
third-year law student.
According to former Stanford
Democrats chair Kevin Hartz, the
club as a whole is not supposed to
endorse candidates. However, the
group has been involved in educa
tional programs such as mock
debates in dorms this year.
Republicans focus on locals
Active campaigning for Republi
can presidential candidates on cam
pus has been minimal, as the College
Republicans have been focusing on
the local congressional campaign.
"There's not much to do yet on
the national campaign," said
senior Paul Garrett, chair of the
College Republicans.
But a group called Republicans
for Choice, which supports abor
tion rights, has been registering
voters on campus, he said. Indi
vidual students have also been
working on local campaigns, doing
fund-raising and other work.
"We're also organizing a
debate between the Congressional
candidates in the 14th district,"
said Garrett.
The debate will be held at the
end of the month and should
include all five Republican candi
dates: Dixon Arnett, Tom Huen
ing, Mike Maibach, Bill Quraishi
and Paul Biddle.
On the campaign trail
Sophomore Jordan Kantor
canceled his spring break plans at
the last minute to work for the
Brown campaign in his home
state of New York.
While Kantor said he decided
to join the cause for a week "to see

how adults organize themselves
and to see how a campaign
works," he soon became a Brown
convert himself.
"My mom had called Jerry's
800 number," Kantor said. "The
Brown campaign organization
asked if we had a bed to spare . ..
and Kathee Godette, the national
coordinator for outreach and con
stituency groups [for Brown]
ended up staying at our house
throughout the New York cam
paign. I talked to her on the
phone, and she invited me to
come shadow her for a week."
Kantor's spring break offered
little rest and relaxation, but
proved educational, he said.
"I learned more in that week
them you would in a year-long
poli-sci class," he said.
Kantor accompanied Brown to a
private meeting with the executive
editors of Time-Life, helped orga
nize rallies and did some research.
He was impressed by the rapid
organizational skills required in a
campaign.
"I watched them plan a day just
like that," said Kantor, snapping
his fmgers. "It was amazing, the
delegation of responsibilities and
the fact that the next day, all the
things happened."
The relationship between
money and campaigning became
clear to Kantor when he visited
Clinton's headquarters. Brown
has capped contributions to his
campaign at $100. The legal limit
is $1,000.
"Brown set up his New York
headquarters in a decrepit build
ing near the Port Authority. We
had no phones, jio FAX, no
copiers, and the toilets were over
flowing. People were coming in
and physically donating phones,"
said Kantor. "But Clinton's place
was totally different, ... a bunch
of yuppies in a nice building."
Kantor said he was astonished
at the sabotage outside groups
were waging on Brown's campaign
and was frustrated by the opposi
tion's television advertisements.
"I was mute to defend him,"
Kantor said.
Although his roommate and
others call Brown "Captain
Moonbeam" and chastise Kantor
for supporting him, Kantor isn't
deterred.
"I have met Jerry Brown the
person, and I believe in him," said
Kantor. "It's OK to have a brain
and like Jerry Brown."
At a school where Bart Simpson
was elected to the graduate student
senate and a slate known as "I Pre
fer Not to Have a COP" is a con
tender for the student govern
ment's highest office, many consid
er "political activism" an oxymoron.
But national and state politics
are catching the interest of many
Stanford students, and as pri
maries draw near, apathy is giving
way to activity.
While campus Republicans are
focusing on the local congression
al race, groups of Democrats are
separately amassing support for
presidential candidates Jerry
Brown and Bill Clinton.
Jerry's kids
In keeping with the spirit of his
national campaign, supporters of
former California Gov. Jerry
Brown are organizing a grassroots
effort on campus.


AJ Green — Daily
Enchanted Broccoli Forest resident Christy Lichtendahi makes a poster in support of
former California Gov. Jerry Brown's bid for president. She is one of many Stanford stu
dents who have become active in the various election campaigns taking place this year.
Fourteen students supporting
Brown in his bid for the Demo
cratic presidential nomination
met for the first time this week to
organize pro-Brown activities on
campus. While some of the partic
ipants were seasoned activists,
most characterized themselves as
newcomers to the political scene
and appeared somewhat sur
prised to find themselves at a
political meeting.
"This is the first political cam
paign I've considered working
for," said Flora Lu, a junior. "But
I like his environmental policy."
"I'm a Republican myself," said
sophomore Brian Brennan. "And
while I think there's been a lot of
value in the last 12 years, it's time
to move on. I like Brown's values
and morals a lot."
Rafe Sagarin, a sophomore
majoring in Earth Systems, orga
nized the meeting. "I — like many
people — am frustrated with the
'one party system,' " he said. "We
need someone who is concerned
about the environment, someone
who will take a few risks."
The group is planning a "grass
roots" campaign on campus, mod
eled after Brown's national cam
