# Students dive into fall campaign races
## 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
At a school where Bart Simpson
was elected to the graduate student
senate and a slate known as "I Pre
fer Not to Have a COP" is a con
tender for the student govern
ment's highest office, many consid
er "political activism" an oxymoron.
But national and state politics
are catching the interest of many
Stanford students, and as pri
maries draw near, apathy is giving
way to activity.
While campus Republicans are
focusing on the local congression
al race, groups of Democrats are
separately amassing support for
presidential candidates Jerry
Brown and Bill Clinton.
Jerry's kids
In keeping with the spirit of his
national campaign, supporters of
former California Gov. Jerry
Brown are organizing a grassroots
effort on campus.
