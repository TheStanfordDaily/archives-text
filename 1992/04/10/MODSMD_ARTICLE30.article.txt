The Stanford men's gymnastics team is com
peting in the NCAA Western Regionals in Albu
querque, N.M. this Saturday night, but they've
already got one eye on the championships two
weeks away.
Competing against the top 12 teams in the
western half of the U.S., the Cardinal must
place in the top four to advance to the finals.
Stanford is seeded second behind No. 1 Nebras
ka, but the team isn't looking to knock the
Cornhuskers off yet.
"[The team doesn't] want to win the whole
meet, just qualify in the top four," said assistant
coach Charles Loop. "They're training to peak
just in time for nationals, so they'll probably only
bring out a few new tricks [at regionals]. The
meet that counts is in two weeks."
The Cardinal is focused strongly on their goal
of a national championship after last year's disap
pointing third-place finish at nationals, Loop said.
Stanford will be back at full strength for the
regionals now that Tim Ryan has healed fully
from his heel injury.
Assuming Stanford qualifies, it will head to
Nebraska for the championships a week from
Tuesday.
