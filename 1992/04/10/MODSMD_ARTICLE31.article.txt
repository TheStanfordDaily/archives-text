Stanford's silent move to the top of the
national women's golf standings will be put to
the test this weekend as the Cardinal heads
down to Monterey to compete in the San Jose
State Women's Intercollegiate held on the
Bayonet Golf Course.
"This is definitely the toughest course we
play all year," said coach Tim Baldwin. "It is a
very demanding tournament . . . every hole is
tree-lined."
The Cardinal, after being dropped a place
in the ratings after the fall and winter sea
sons, to No. 7, vaulted up to fifth recently due
to a surprise finish in the University of Hawaii
Intercollegiate.
Over spring break, Stanford lost by a heart

eyes across the country that had perhaps writ
ten the Cardinal squad off.
In Hawaii, the Stanford team staged a last
day comeback, playing one of the Cardinal's
best rounds in recent years, after a long win
ter quarter layoff. Friday, Saturday and Sun
day the women's squad will try to duplicate

that effort to challenge the golfers from No. 2-
ranked San Jose State.
Jamiile Jose will lead the Cardinal in Mon
terey, as she was Stanford's highest finisher
in the Hawaii tourney, the first of the close
finishing Cardinal squad. Adele Moore,
Martha Richards, Audrey Wooding and Melin
da Daniels will also compete in Stanford's last
tune-up before the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships. In addition, Stephanie Davis
and Amy Lawrence will compete in the tour
nament as individuals.
Last year, Stanford finished second in this
tournament against a tough field, which
should be a boost of confidence for returning
players. UCLA, USC, Arizona State, third
ranked Georgia and fourth-ranked Oklahoma
State will be competing this weekend.
"We've been right in there with some real
ly strong teams," Baldwin said. "We wouldn't
be there if we hadn't earned it."
