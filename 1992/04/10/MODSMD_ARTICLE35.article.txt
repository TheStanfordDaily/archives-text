### Michael McCarroll 
Nurses at the Lucile Salter Packard Children's
Hospital ratified a two-year contract Wednesday
after 10 weeks of negotiation.
It was the first negotiated contract at the hospi
tal, which opened last June.
The 1,400-member nurse's union, the Committee for
Recognition of Nursing Achievement, settled a similar
two-year contract at the Stanford Hospital last month.
The Packard contract provides a number of
avenues for labor management and workplace coop
eration, according to Packard union vice-president
Karen Serpa.
Under the contract, joint conferences are to be
held monthly between nurses and administration,
and a committee on nursing practice will be estab
lished. The committee will deal with operational
issues at the hospital.
"There are lots of cooperative options available
for good working relations," Serpa said.
Contract negotiations centered on shift pay, espe
cially compensation for night and weekend shifts.
"Management offered the nurses good economic
incentives to work on those shifts," Serpa said.
"These will be very beneficial to the hospital."
The contract establishes a clinical ladder with
four levels of staff nurses. The levels are stratified
by experience and professional development.
Nearly 40 percent of the nurses at Packard fall

into the "Staff Nurse 4" level and earn approximate
ly $61,000 per year. "Our nurses have a great deal of
experience," Beals said.
Packard nurses will receive a seven percent pay
increase in 1992, and a six percent raise in 1993.

The contract is the first in the
hospital's history.

Serpa, who worked for 10 years at the Stanford
Hospital before coming to Packard, said that while
the bargaining atmosphere at Stanford was "hos
tile," negotiations were conducted in a "very produc
tive and very positive atmosphere" at Packard.
"We're looking forward to a productive working rela
tionship with the management at Packard," she said.
Myra Beals, director of human resources at
Packard, said she was "pleased that negotiations
went as well as they did."
"We made great strides in understanding each
other and in laying down groundwork for how nurs
ing services will be provided [at Packard]," Beals said.
Packard opened last June after the merger of the
Children's Hospital at Stanford and the Stanford
Hospital Pediatrics Department. It is a 143-bed
regional referral center devoted exclusively to the
care of children.
