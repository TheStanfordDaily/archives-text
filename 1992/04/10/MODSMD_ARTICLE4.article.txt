# Students to get 50-yard-line seats
## Election week announcement called political 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
Standing on the 50-yard line
in Stanford Stadium with the
Students First Council of Presi
dents slate, football head coach
Bill Walsh and Assoc. Athletic
Director Tom Beckett announced
yesterday that students would
regain the best seats in the house
at games beginning next fall.
The decision — intended to
raise attendance at games — will
move students from their cur
rent seats on the 30-yard line
back to sections D and DD on the
50-yard line.
According to Beckett, senior
Glyn Milburn, a star running
back and a member of the Stu
dents First COP slate, had been
calling for the change since earlier
this year.
Beckett said the decision was
made during winter quarter.
The first official announcement
of the change was made yester
day, two days after the begin
ning of the campaign for ASSU
elections next Wednesday and
Thursday.
Beckett said Milburn called for
the Stadium meeting with Walsh
and the slate earlier this week.
"We're giving [preferred seat
ing! back at Glyn's behest,"
Beckett said, adding that Mil
burn's "input was very crucial to
the decision."

According to sophomore John
Hall, another member of the
Students First slate, "We're try
ing to prove that we are going to
be an effective COP."
But senior Ron Brown, a
member of the "Independents: A
New Era" COP slate, expressed
concern that Walsh and Beck
ett's announcement would
unfairly influence the election.
"The timing of this announce
ment will have the impact of help

ing their campaign," Brown said.
"It seems too much of a coinci
dence."
"Students First is definitely
benefiting, but it's not merely
publicity [for] members of the
slate," Milburn said.
Milburn had been discussing
the possibility of moving student
seats with the athletic depart
ment since early winter quarter,
before he decided to run for COP,
Beckett said.

According to Beckett, the deci
sion had been made after a mar
keting committee organized by
Athletic Director Ted Leland rec
ommended the move as a way to
increase attendance at games,
which had dropped from 304,000
in 1980 to 203,000 in 1990.
Beckett said the meeting was
held yesterday because it was
convenient for everyone involved.

Walsh and Assoc. Athletic Director Tom Beckett discuss the new seating arrangement. Senior Glyn
Milburn, fourth from left, called for yesterday's meeting.
"Our decision to be there was
not politically motivated," Beck
ett said, adding that he was not
intentionally endorsing one slate,
and would gladly meet with other
students or slates to discuss stu
dent concerns.
He said the aim of the meeting
with Milburn and the other
members of the Students First
slate — Hall, junior Joel Stein
and junior Preeti Malladi — was
to hear more student input on
the decision, and to point out
exactly what the change would
mean.
"We think [attendance] will get
a lot better" with the relocation of
student seating, Beckett said.
Students lost the prime seats
in 1989, when alumni, seated in

'We gotta have
them back. That's
all there is to it.'

the rows behind them, com
plained of students standing in
their seats and obstructing their
view.
Beckett said, "Probably if it
hadn't been for the concern of the
students, we probably wouldn't
have recognized the problem." He
added that moving student seat
ing in 1989 was "a terrible mis
take."
But Walsh said moving the stu
dents back to the 50-yard line
"probably would have happened
anyway," without student

involvement. He said the student
seating arrangement had con
cerned him when he first took the
position as coach.
"Students should have top pri
ority in everything," he said.
Walsh said he had also heard con
cern from players such as Mil
burn, noting that "the players
truly represent the students."
"We gotta have them back.
That's all there is to it," Walsh
added.
COP candidate Ed Mun, a
member of the"I Prefer Not to
Have a COP" slate, approved of
yesterday's announcement. He
said it helps his slate because the
Students First nominees "weren't
in the COP, which proves you
don't have to be in the COP to do
something."
Mun's slate advocates abolish
ing the COP altogether, arguing
that it is largely ineffective.

Beckett said, "Probably if it
hadn't been for the concern of the
students, we probably wouldn't
have recognized the problem." He
added that moving student seat
ing in 1989 was "a terrible mis
take."
But Walsh said moving the stu
dents back to the 50-yard line
"probably would have happened
anyway," without student

involvement. He said the student
seating arrangement had con
cerned him when he first took the
position as coach.
"Students should have top pri
ority in everything," he said.
Walsh said he had also heard con
cern from players such as Mil
burn, noting that "the players
truly represent the students."
"We gotta have them back.
That's all there is to it," Walsh
added.
COP candidate Ed Mun, a
member of the"I Prefer Not to
Have a COP" slate, approved of
yesterday's announcement. He
said it helps his slate because the
Students First nominees "weren't
in the COP, which proves you
don't have to be in the COP to do
something."
Mun's slate advocates abolish
ing the COP altogether, arguing
that it is largely ineffective.
Standing on the 50-yard line
in Stanford Stadium with the
Students First Council of Presi
dents slate, football head coach
Bill Walsh and Assoc. Athletic
Director Tom Beckett announced
yesterday that students would
regain the best seats in the house
at games beginning next fall.
The decision — intended to
raise attendance at games — will
move students from their cur
rent seats on the 30-yard line
back to sections D and DD on the
50-yard line.
According to Beckett, senior
Glyn Milburn, a star running
back and a member of the Stu
dents First COP slate, had been
calling for the change since earlier
this year.
Beckett said the decision was
made during winter quarter.
The first official announcement
of the change was made yester
day, two days after the begin
ning of the campaign for ASSU
elections next Wednesday and
Thursday.
Beckett said Milburn called for
the Stadium meeting with Walsh
and the slate earlier this week.
"We're giving [preferred seat
ing! back at Glyn's behest,"
Beckett said, adding that Mil
burn's "input was very crucial to
the decision."

According to sophomore John
Hall, another member of the
Students First slate, "We're try
ing to prove that we are going to
be an effective COP."
But senior Ron Brown, a
member of the "Independents: A
New Era" COP slate, expressed
concern that Walsh and Beck
ett's announcement would
unfairly influence the election.
"The timing of this announce
ment will have the impact of help

ing their campaign," Brown said.
"It seems too much of a coinci
dence."
"Students First is definitely
benefiting, but it's not merely
publicity [for] members of the
slate," Milburn said.
Milburn had been discussing
the possibility of moving student
seats with the athletic depart
ment since early winter quarter,
before he decided to run for COP,
Beckett said.

According to Beckett, the deci
sion had been made after a mar
keting committee organized by
Athletic Director Ted Leland rec
ommended the move as a way to
increase attendance at games,
which had dropped from 304,000
in 1980 to 203,000 in 1990.
Beckett said the meeting was
held yesterday because it was
convenient for everyone involved.

On the football field in Stanford Stadium, Students First COP candidates stand by as head coach Bill
Walsh and Assoc. Athletic Director Tom Beckett discuss the new seating arrangement. Senior Glyn
Milburn, fourth from left, called for yesterday's meeting.
"Our decision to be there was
not politically motivated," Beck
ett said, adding that he was not
intentionally endorsing one slate,
and would gladly meet with other
students or slates to discuss stu
dent concerns.
He said the aim of the meeting
with Milburn and the other
members of the Students First
slate — Hall, junior Joel Stein
and junior Preeti Malladi — was
to hear more student input on
the decision, and to point out
exactly what the change would
mean.
"We think [attendance] will get
a lot better" with the relocation of
student seating, Beckett said.
