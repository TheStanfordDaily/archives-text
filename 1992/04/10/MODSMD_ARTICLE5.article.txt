# Groups voice concern about handbook errors
## MEChA, Legal Office fee requests misprinted INSIDE 
### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
Major mistakes in the ASSU spring
election handbook — including two fee
requests listed as $10,000 higher than they
should have been — have left some people
uneasy about the upcoming election.
MEChA's $33,896.05 request was list
ed as $44,021, and sophomore Ying-Ying
Goh was omitted from the list of under
graduate senate candidates.
The Legal Counseling Office requested
about $60,000, according to treasurer
Jewel Hudson, who could not remember
the exact amount. Their request was
printed as $72,580.
Senate Chair Kevin Warsh seemed
unconcerned by the errors. "I understand
fully that it is a little troubling for
MEChA," he said. But not enough stu
dents read the election handbook for the
errors to harm the groups, he said.
"I really don't think that there will be
an effect on the actual election due to our
mistake," Warsh said.
Hearings Officer Jason Moore said the

mistakes were typical of the process of
producing the handbook and were not the

fault of the elections commission. "The
problem lies within the senate for not giv
ing [the amounts] to us correctly."
He said they would look back and make
an effort to rectify the errors.
Mistakes also plagued last year's hand
book. MEChA's statement was incom
plete and XTV's budget was left out,
among other errors.
Special fee requests and budgets are
turned into the senate appropriations
committee, which reviews and makes rec
ommendations to the senate. The senate
votes on the fees and those it approves are
put into the handbook.
Errors are introduced when the senate
tries to account for quarterly fee refunds,
Elections Commissioner Enda Hu said.
Each quarter, students request money
back from certain groups. The percentage
of money that is refunded is automatically
added to the group's fee request as a buffer.
The senate did not know MEChA had
already included the buffer in
their original request, Hu said.
MEChA treasurer Eva Silva
said she was upset because the
incorrect fee request will cost her
group votes. "We've been cam
paigning a lot and now we've been
getting a lot of phone calls from
people asking what happened,"
she said.

Legal Counseling's request was
printed incorrectly, Hu said,
because he only found the 1991-92
budget on the disk Hudson had
turned in. Hudson said she had
included next year's budget, as well.
Hudson said she was annoyed
because she had worked "until mid
night" to make sure that her
office's fee increase was only five
percent.
Senate candidate Goh said she
was "just planning to campaign
harder" to make up for being left
out of the handbook.

Hu said the ASSU will take
responsibility for the mistake in
MEChA's special fee and for omit
ting Goh. Ads will be placed in
The Daily apologizing to MEChA
and Goh, whose statement and
qualifications will be posted at
poll sites.
Smaller errors were found in the
special fee listings for several other
groups, including Students for East
European Democracy, Stanford
Homelessness Action Coalition,
and Stanford in Government.
Hu said the ASSU had not as of

yesterday received complaints about
other listings in the handbook.
"It's a confusing process —
that's why there's so many
errors," Hu said.
Hu said if people had proofed
their requests as they were asked
to do, the errors could have been
avoided. Neither Goh nor Hudson
proofread their sections, he said.
MEChA members proofread
their section, but said they were
only shown their statements, and
not the senate's adjusted "amount
requested."
