# University Press to remain in business, surviving cuts
## 
### Julia Sobrevilla Editorial staff 
The University decided this week not
to shut down the Stanford University
Press — as had been initially proposed —
but doubts over its future already took
their toll on the Press' business, its direc
tor said yesterday.
"A lot of damage was done to the Press
before they decided not to eliminate us,"
said Stanford University Press Director
Grant Barnes.
Provost Designate Gerald Lieberman,
in an April 6 letter to Barnes, said he had
decided that the "Press continues to be an
important scholarly resource and a signif
icant University asset."
But rumors that the Press might close
had been circulating for many months,
Barnes said — and he fears the rumors

had a negative effect on the Press' busi
ness over the past few months.
"We're a competitive business and the
word got out to authors that our future
was uncertain," he said. "It's hard to know
if we've lost many authors ... but I would
say that yes, we almost certainly have lost
some people."
Although the Press will not be eliminat
ed, its University subsidy of $200,000 will
be reduced by one-half by 1994-95. The
subsidy amounts to about 15 percent of the
Press' operating budget, Barnes said.
Vice President for Planning and Man
agement Ray Bacchetti, to whom the
Press reports, said the subsidy received by
the Press amounts to a relatively small
amount of money, which makes the Uni
versity Press "very worth keeping."
"The Press is a $3 million per
year enterprise," Bacchetti said.
"Most of its revenues come from
sales. It's a substantial business."
Lieberman's decision to keep
the Press open follows the positive
report he received from two faculty
committees established to examine
the role and importance of the
Press to the Stanford community.
One budget-reduction proposal
that had been under considera
tion was to eliminate the Press
and establish a research fund for
the humanities instead.
To assess the advantages of
this proposal, Lieberman created
a five-member committee com
prised of humanities faculty.
Some faculty members object
ed to the composition of the com
mittee, arguing that non-humani
ties faculty should have been
included as well, according to
English Prof. George Dekker,
who chaired the committee.
But Dekker said the humani
ties would have lost more than it
would have gained if the Press
had been replaced by a humani
ties research fund.
The humanities "would gain
something, but it is not clear the
rest of the University would bene
fit or be very happy that the
humanities should reap the bene
fits of closing the Stanford Uni
versity Press," he said.
Dekker and his committee sub
mitted a written statement to

Lieberman in which they cited
the reasons why the Press should
not be dissolved.
Its closure would be a "betray
al of responsibility," the report
said. "We know of no other uni
versity of Stanford's stature that
does not have such a press."

A faculty commit
tee reported that
closing the press
would have been
a 'betrayal of
responsibility.'

Dekker said it is important to
keep the Press because it "is real
ly part of a stem of mutual depen
dence." University presses are
important to all scholarly work,
and are one of the features that
attract top professors and schol
ars, he said.
Although the Stanford Univer
sity Press is a relatively small
enterprise compared to those of
the University of Chicago or Har
vard, it is comparable to them "in
terms of quality," Barnes said.
Lieberman named another
committee to look into the Press'
financial situation. The commit
tee was chaired by Budget Direc
tor Tim Warner, who declined to
comment on its findings.
