# University Press to remain in business, surviving cuts
## 
### Julia Sobrevilla Editorial staff 
The University decided this week not
to shut down the Stanford University
Press — as had been initially proposed —
but doubts over its future already took
their toll on the Press' business, its direc
tor said yesterday.
"A lot of damage was done to the Press
before they decided not to eliminate us,"
said Stanford University Press Director
Grant Barnes.
Provost Designate Gerald Lieberman,
in an April 6 letter to Barnes, said he had
decided that the "Press continues to be an
important scholarly resource and a signif
icant University asset."
But rumors that the Press might close
had been circulating for many months,
Barnes said — and he fears the rumors

had a negative effect on the Press' busi
ness over the past few months.
"We're a competitive business and the
word got out to authors that our future
was uncertain," he said. "It's hard to know
if we've lost many authors ... but I would
say that yes, we almost certainly have lost
some people."
Although the Press will not be eliminat
ed, its University subsidy of $200,000 will
be reduced by one-half by 1994-95. The
subsidy amounts to about 15 percent of the
Press' operating budget, Barnes said.
Vice President for Planning and Man
agement Ray Bacchetti, to whom the
Press reports, said the subsidy received by
the Press amounts to a relatively small
amount of money, which makes the Uni
versity Press "very worth keeping."
