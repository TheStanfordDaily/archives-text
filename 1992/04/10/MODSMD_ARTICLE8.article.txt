# University to install pay phones
## Plan to increase safety eyes 8 campus locations 
### Craig Kersemeier Staff writer 
Hoping to make Stanford safer, the University
plans to install several new public phones on campus
within the next month. However, they will be ordi
nary pay phones rather than the safety phones orig
inally considered.
Eight new public phones will be installed at loca
tions such as the Physics Tank and Roble Gym,
according to Stephen Briscombe, the electrical sys
tems manager for Operations and Maintenance.
As safety awareness heightened on campus over
the past few years, the University — in conjunction
with the Palo Alto Police Department — planned to
install emergency phones on campus, Briscombe said.
The safety phones originally considered, which
automatically dialed the police department at the
touch of a button, were never installed because they
were deemed "not appropriate aesthetically by the
powers that be," Briscombe said.
The pay phones that will begin to operate this
month were donated by Pacific Bell, and are located
primarily in areas that have a regular flow of people
and have been identified as "adequate places for rev
enue" by Pacific Bell, Briscombe said.
Briscombe added that although the phones were
donated, the University has spent $25,000 installing
them.
Susan Epstein, the coordinator of sexual assault
prevention education, said, "If the primary reason

(for installing the new phones) is to combat sexual
assault, I think there are better things to put the
money into." She added that most sexual assaults at
Stanford take place in dorm rooms, not outside.
Two years ago, the University abandoned as cost
prohibitive a plan to install safety phones in front of
every residence, according to Epstein.
These safety phones would have been used to con
trol access to the residences. The doors could have
been kept locked at all times, with visitors calling to
the rooms of individual residents, who could then
open the door from inside.
Such a system could "keep unwanted parties out
after an acquaintance rape and keep unwanted peo
ple from continually visiting," Epstein said.
The pay phones that were installed have no spe
cial markings to identify them as emergency or safe
ty phones, but Briscombe says there is an ongoing
discussion among the "powers that be" over
whether to put signs on top of the phones.
While the new phones do not have one-touch dial
ing to the police department, they will have a regu
lar 911 service. The police department will be able to
trace the 911 calls to the appropriate pay phone,
Briscombe said.
The new pay phones are located at Lake Laguni
ta, the History Corner, the Stouffer Chemical Engi
neering Building, the Center for Integrated Systems
on Serra Street, the Physics Tank, Roble Gym, the
Career Planning and Placement Center and behind
Memorial Church.
