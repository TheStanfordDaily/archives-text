## 'Nightline' struggles to get candidates to appear 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
"Nightline" organizers are dig
ging deep into the barrel to find
politicians willing to answer ques
tions at this evening's town meet
ing in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
President Bush, Vice President
Dan Quayle and Texas billionaire
Ross Perot have turned down
invitations to speak, ABC News
"Nightline" producer Richard
Harris said yesterday.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas,
whose doctor told him to take a
few days off, also will not be
appearing. "His voice is shot," a
Clinton spokesperson said.
Former presidential candidate
Jesse Jackson, television com
mentator Pat Buchanan and for
mer Gov. Jerry Brown of Califor
nia will be appearing via satellite,
Harris said.
Jackson was asked to appear,
Harris said, because "he has been
in presidential races and has been
able to reach out to the public
that feels disenfranchised."
Harris said a pool of experts,
including Law Prof. Deborah
Rhode and Senior Hoover Fellow

Martin Anderson, will sit in
bleachers next to the video moni
tors and anchor Ted Koppel,
Stanford Class of '62.
Rhode, who specializes in femi
nist law, said

the program is
a good way to
bring up issues
candidates are
ignoring. She
criticized the
television for
mat: "No one
can ask any fol
low-up ques
tions."
Anderson, a

political policy expert who worked
with Richard Nixon and Ronald
Reagan on their presidential cam
paigns and during their terms in the
White House, criticized the show's
premise of a "process run amok."
The political process is "work
ing very powerfully and very well,"
Anderson said. The only way to
improve the election process, he
said, would be to make it longer.
Faculty, staff and student win
ners of the "Nightline" lottery
picked up their tickets to attend the
show yesterday in White Plaza.

Almost 100 tickets were not
claimed and will be available at
noon today in White Plaza on a
first-come, first-served basis,
according to Mary Bartlett, assis
tant director of university relations.
Almost half of the faculty win
ners did not pick up their tickets,
but only four or five student tick
ets were unclaimed, Bartlett said.
Some lottery winners inter
viewed said they could not attend
due to previous scheduling conflicts.
Assoc. Electrical Engineering
Prof. David Bloom, who will
attend, said, "It's kind of like a
party nobody is coming to."
Today's town meeting will be the
third such event Bloom has partic
ipated in, after "The Howdy-Doody
Show" and "Saturday Night Live."
People who picked up tickets
were required to give their names,
addresses, phone numbers and
potential questions. Harris said
interviews of ticket holders with
"special interests" have begun.
Those interviews are intended to
focus tonight's discussion.
Nightline officials would not
explain how they will decide who
gets to ask questions. Not every
one will be allowed to do so.
