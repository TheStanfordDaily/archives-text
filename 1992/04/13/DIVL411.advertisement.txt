STOP THE TORTURE AND KILLING OF
STREET CHILDREN IN BRAZIL & GUATEMALA!
END POLICE AND DEATH SQUAD IMPUNITY!
"They (the police] take us in the trunk of the car ...
We are undressed, tied up ... They throw us in the river
until nearly drowned, it hurts a lot, they kick us right
in our stomachs, but they hit us with their fists wrapped
in cloth so as not to leave marks. We say we are going
to tell the judge. They say that if the judge finds out,
when we go back to the street they will kill us." -
statement of one Brazilian street child
Hundreds of children are murdered yearly by
police and others involved in death squads. Many
more are beaten and tortured. Those responsible
for these heinous crimes must be made to bear
responsibility for their actions.
