# 'Nightline' guests say media have 'run amok'
##

A program intended to criti
cize the political process instead
became an opportunity for
bashing the media Friday night
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Only two Stanford affili
ates, Martin Anderson of the
Hoover Institution and history
graduate student Eric Alter
man, got to speak during the
Stanford-based broadcast of
ABC News "Nightline."
Former California Gov. Jerry
Brown, television commentator
Pat Buchanan and former pres
idential candidate Jesse Jackson
appeared via satellite. Missing
from the fray were the front
runners in the presidential cam
paign, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clin
ton and President Bush.
Anchor Ted Koppel said
Clinton could not attend
because of a sore throat, and
Bush and Vice President Dan
Quayle would not attend
because they disagreed with the
premise of the program, which
was titled "A Process Run
Amok: Can It Be Fixed?"
Much of the program cen
tered on newspaper and televi
sion coverage of campaigns,
and the panelists all blamed
the media for problems in the
political process.
"The media are part of this
terrible withdrawal," said
media critic Todd Gitlin, a pro
fessor at UC-Berkeley and one
of the experts pre-selected by
"Nightline."
"The press has gone back to
what comes naturally — to
selling papers and titillating
information."
Jackson said he agreed and
suggested the media "move
away from photo opportunities
and sound bites," which force
candidates to emphasize style
over substance.
Selwyn Whitehead, presi
dent of the Economic Empow
erment Foundation and the
first audience member to speak,
said she saw a "conspiracy
between the media and those
people who want to get elected."

"Nightline" moderator Ted Koppel talks with audience members selected to sit on the Dinkelspiel Auditorium stage with him for the ABC
TV broadcast Friday evening. Some who attended said they were disappointed that audience members weren't allowed greater partici
pation in the 90-minute show. Below, Koppel relaxes in White Plaza during an interview with The Daily Friday afternoon.
