# 'Nightline' guests say media have 'run amok'
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
A program intended to criti
cize the political process instead
became an opportunity for
bashing the media Friday night
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Only two Stanford affili
ates, Martin Anderson of the
Hoover Institution and history
graduate student Eric Alter
man, got to speak during the
Stanford-based broadcast of
ABC News "Nightline."
Former California Gov. Jerry
Brown, television commentator
Pat Buchanan and former pres
idential candidate Jesse Jackson
appeared via satellite. Missing
from the fray were the front
runners in the presidential cam
paign, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clin
ton and President Bush.
Anchor Ted Koppel said
Clinton could not attend
because of a sore throat, and
Bush and Vice President Dan
Quayle would not attend
because they disagreed with the
premise of the program, which
was titled "A Process Run
Amok: Can It Be Fixed?"
Much of the program cen
tered on newspaper and televi
sion coverage of campaigns,
and the panelists all blamed
the media for problems in the
political process.
"The media are part of this
terrible withdrawal," said
media critic Todd Gitlin, a pro
fessor at UC-Berkeley and one
of the experts pre-selected by
"Nightline."
"The press has gone back to
what comes naturally — to
selling papers and titillating
information."
Jackson said he agreed and
suggested the media "move
away from photo opportunities
and sound bites," which force
candidates to emphasize style
over substance.
Selwyn Whitehead, presi
dent of the Economic Empow
erment Foundation and the
first audience member to speak,
said she saw a "conspiracy
between the media and those
people who want to get elected."

Rajiv Chandrasekaran — Daily
"Nightline" moderator Ted Koppel talks with audience members selected to sit on the Dinkelspiel Auditorium stage with him for the ABC
TV broadcast Friday evening. Some who attended said they were disappointed that audience members weren't allowed greater partici
pation in the 90-minute show. Below, Koppel relaxes in White Plaza during an interview with The Daily Friday afternoon.
said, "I am out early because with
Jesse Jackson, Pat Buchanan and
Jerry Brown, my assumption is
that this will be my last chance to
talk to you."
Koppel's words were not far
from the truth, since his pan
elists made long speeches and
continually interrupted each
other.
The program was designed as
a town meeting, where there
would be a constant interchange
between candidates and the audi
ence.
However, only six people actual
ly asked questions during the hour
and a half-long program.
Some of the criticism of the
media was constructive — former

California Gov. Jerry Brown sug
gested televising debates that
would air on all channels, offering
free air time to all candidates and
banning television spots and com
mercials.
"The false advertising of a
commercial is much more insidi
ous than debate," he said.
Brown himself diverted much
of the program's time, as the dis
cussion quickly turned to the
subject of an ABC "World News
Tonight" report that used
unidentified sources who accused
Brown of throwing parties dur
ing his term as governor where
cocaine and marijuana were
used.
On Friday, participants debat
ed the ethics of running a news
story without naming sources.
Brown and Buchanan fell on
the same side of the issue. "If (the
sources) are not prepared to come

forward, don't put out the infor
mation," said Buchanan, while
Brown called the unnamed
sources "character assassirs."
Koppel defended a reporter's
right to run stories while protect
ing sources as a common practice
in journalism.
"It is the responsibility of the
journalist to get as much corrobo
rative evidence as possible," he
said.
Not all the blame was placed
on the media, however. Kevin
Sweeney, former press secretary
for Gary Hart, said "some of the
blame lies with the candidates
who don't build mandates" or
address real issues.
Anderson agreed that the prob
lems go beyond media coverage.
"What we've been talking about is
the process, which is the messen
ger. You want to kill the messen
ger," he said.
