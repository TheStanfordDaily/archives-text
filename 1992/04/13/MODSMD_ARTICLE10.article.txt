## 
### Katie Mauro Julia Sobrevilla Staff writers 
For the first time, Stanford
students will have a chance to
connect a face and voice with a
name when voting for ASSU
senate candidates.
XTV, the Stanford student
channel — channel 10 on
SUNet — is hosting the first
"Spring Election Showcase,"
where candidates are alloted a
30-second time span to state
their views and goals for their
slate. The program will appear
tonight at 8 p.m.
"I really think it will give peo
ple a chance to see the candidates
for who they really are," said
freshman Matthew Kulikowski,
XTVs station manager.
The producers invited
"every single one of the groups
taking part in the ASSU elec
tions," said senior Shari
Levine, a member of XTV.
According to both Levine and
Kulikowski, the turnout was
disappointing at first: only a few
groups showed up to tape inter
views, which were scheduled for
all day Saturday and Sunday.
"We didn't have as big a
turnout as we expected," Levine
said. "Maybe they (the candi
dates) don't think XTV is
worthwhile, or maybe it's just
because they're apathetic."
The apathy, however,
appeared to have vanished some
what Sunday night as more than
20 students and groups, includ
ing COP slates Students First
and "Independents: a New Era,"
called the TV station to schedule

appointments.
"People are deciding at the
last minute that it is going to
be worthwhile to be here,"
Kulikowski said. "I was very
pleased with the results. This
will really give them a chance
to speak their minds."
University President Don
ald Kennedy will make a cameo
appearance on the show and
encourage students to vote,
according to Kulikowski.
Mike Finch, a candidate for
undergraduate senate, said he
was given about 30 seconds of
actual appearance time. "I
basically got time to name a
few issues," he said. "My main
point was for people to read the
election guidebook."
Finch said he thinks XTV
"is doing an excellent service to
the students," but complained
that not many students will
actually watch the program.
"There's really not enough
exposure," he said.
Sophomore Joshua Powers,
another candidate for under
graduate senate, was also con
cerned about the number of
people who may — or may not
— watch the program.
"If a lot of people watch,
that's great, because it actually
gives people a chance to connect
a face with a name," Powers
said. "However, it is a gamble as
to how many people will watch."
Undergraduate senate can
didate Anoop Prakash said he
likes the idea of using television
as a vehicle in the elections.
"We sure could use XTV a
whole lot more, and rid the cam
pus of those ugly fliers," he said.
