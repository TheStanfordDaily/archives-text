# C.O.P.? NOT

THE DAILY'S ENDORSE
ment of "I Prefer Not to Have
a C.0.P." will come as a surprise to
many. After all, what is Stanford
without Mem Chu, without Lake
Lag, without a C.0.P.?
This is the question posed by
Blake Ilstrup, Paul Kwon, Ted Lai,
and Edward Mun, running with "I
Prefer Not to Have a C.0.P.," deliv
ering the promise to eliminate the
ASSU's Council of Presidents. The
very idea might seem ludicrous,
but as the four candidates ably
argue, the elimination oftheC.O.P.
office is worth a try for at least this
one year.
As the slate asks, can Stanford
survive withoutaC.O.P.? Ofcourse
itcan. Many American universities
get along fine without student gov
ernment "executives." The office
purports to be the executive branch
of the ASSU, but this definition is
misleading in that it implies the

Students should ask
themselves if they are
better off with or without
a Council of Presidents

office is invested with any power
whatsoever.
In 1984, Ronald Reagan asked
voters if they were better off today
than they were four years ago.
Likewise, students should seriously
ask themselves if they are any bet
ter off with a C.O.P. The ASSU
does benefit students with many of
its business projects (Flicks, the
Shirt Shak, Beat the Bookstore,
etc.), but the C.O.P. has little to do
with therunningofthese business.
What the C.O.P. runs best is the hi
fi turntable in its office. The only
students better off with a C.O.P.
are those drawing the $4,000 an
nual salaries.
The "Students First" slate
themselves best demonstrated how
little a Council of Presidents is

needed. Apparently, four interested
students, not associated with the
ASSU, can band together and lobby
the administration about student
needs (such as 50-yard-line seats
and summer storage). If this is the
case, why do students need to spend
$16,000 a year to get the same kinds
of efforts?
The Hammer and Coffin slate,
"YOU!," also presents a fairly revo
lutionary idea, but fails to convince
voters that the slate is serious about
"randomocracy." Its proposal, to let
all students share in the running of
the C.0.P., is noble but impractical.
Both "YOU!" and"I Prefer Not to
Have a C.O. P." effectively dismantle
the executive office, but it is the
abolitionist slate which does this
more efficiently, and without pre
tension.
The two "conventional" slates,
"Students First" and "Independents:
A New Era," provide more of the
same, tired promises. The differ
ence between these slates is so small
as to be insignificant; one says the
tuition hike is bad, the other says it
is really bad. Although the students
on these slates are strong, serious
leaders, perhaps the Council of
Presidents office would not be the
best place for them to lead from.
Criticism of the C.O.P. is a
Stanford tradition. It is always
portrayed as a do-nothing group of
resume packers, who run merely
because they like to see their names
in print. Like student government
elections in high school, ASSU elec
tions usually come down to popu
larity contests. By eliminating the
office, "I Prefer Not to Have a C.0.P."
eliminates the process and the fliers
and posters which litter our campus
for one week each year.
"I Prefer Not to Have A C.0.P."
places a great deal of faith in stu
dent initiative and the power of
student organizations. We applaud
this fresh attitude, and endorse their
approach â€” abolition. After all, the
government which governs best is
that which governs least.
