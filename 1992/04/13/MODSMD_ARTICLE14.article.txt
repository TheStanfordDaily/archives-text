## An audience run amok 
### 
SO "NIGHTLINE" CAME TO Stan
ford, and, frankly, we embarrassed
ourselves. The rancorous intoler
ance for a diversity of opinion demon
strated by the audience inside Dinkelspiel
Auditorium Friday night was shocking.
Case in point: Pat Buchanan, hooked
up via satellite, responded to an audience
member's criticism of the lack of leader
ship skills demonstrated by recent presi
dential candidates by pointing out that
Ronald Reagan possessed great leader
ship skills, and the crowd went berserk.
Hissing and booing and — grow up!
Reagan did a great deal of harm, but like
him or not, he knew how to lead the elec
torate to vote for him. What if Reagan
didn't possess leadership skills? What if
Buchanan, who, by the way, demonstrat
ed more tact and made far fewer outra
geous comments than usual, out and out
lied? So what?
By erupting into a virtually monolith
ic cacophony of cat-calls and those-were
the-words-of-the-devil gasps, we commit
ted a far greater sin than any that came
from Buchanan's mouth.
Yes, there were definite problems with
the show itself, as the scores of audience
members surrounding host Ted Koppel
made clear to him after the show. The
most poignant complaint, articulated by
junior Tracy Clay, centered on the absence
of student involvement in the program.
Why bother to come to Stanford, or

any university for that matter, if stu
dents are not going to be given the oppor
tunity to express themselves? Instead,
nearly every speaker was someone who
would regularly have access to the media.
Clay's disappointment was justified.
"Many of us feel betrayed," she said. "We
came here thinking we were finally going
to have a chance." That opportunity,
however, was denied.
And in choosing to use Stanford solely
as a backdrop, not as a pool of intelli
gence, emotion and concern just as wor
thy as any other, Koppel and his produc
ers cheated us, as well as all those who
tuned in and were thus denied the chance
to hear what we would have said.
Those who tuned in were treated to
something else: our collective intolerance
for comments we didn't like. That'll sure
ly rebuild the old image.
As for Koppel's response to Clay, he
conceded, "I think it was a mistake that we
didn't hear younger voices." But Koppel's
next comment was the kicker. By now, oth
ers had chimed in that students should
have been the focal point of the show.
With the hostility of the audience obvi
ously in mind, Koppel pointed out one of
the distinguishing characteristics of his
show. "If you take away all the people"
who normally have media access, he said,
"you get the Phil Donahue show."
Which brings us back to the audience.
Perhaps the most striking moment

'Those who
watched saw
our collective
intolerance
for comments
we didn't
like.'

occurred thanks to an audience member
whose distaste for American politics bor
dered on nihilism. With demagogic rage,
he called the show "rigged," and the
crowd responded with thunderous
applause.
Koppel's reference to Donahue was
kind. We behaved more like the audience
from the short-lived Morton Downey Jr.
telecasts. Is this what politics is about,
where even an auditorium full of great
minds from all over the Bay Area is
reduced to a lowest common denominator?
We came to discuss The Process. And
most of the blame fell on the heads of the
candidates for building up this Process.
But the candidates just play the game as
the rules are given them. Of all people,
Buchanan was on the money when he
said of his own candidacy: "I think we've
been heard, and I've got no complaints."
The problem has become the elec
torate itself — even nay, especially — the
so-called intelligent representatives that
were present on Friday: those who would
exhaust their energy to bemoan The Pro
cess and to cast protest votes, but who
never get behind a real candidate.
