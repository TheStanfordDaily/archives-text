Accusations about trip bill were partisan attacks

WE ARE WRITING in response to
the April 8 article entitled
"Sparks fly over bill to pay for
trip." We hope this letter will shed a lit
tle more light on what happened.
In my position as volunteer coordina
tor, I coordinated the fund-raising efforts
for the group of students that attended
the Campus Outreach Opportunity
League (COOL) conference. The group of
20 students, chosen by the communities
where they were involved in public ser
vice, represented an amazing coalition of
students brought together from different
sectors of the Stanford community under
one shared interest â€” public service.
Ethnic communities, the Greek system,
Residential Education and student volun
teer organizations were all represented.
Realizing the potential of such a group being
formed, a letter was sent out to various
departments asking for financial support.

Emphasizing the student coalition
that would be formed with their support,
we were able to raise over $7,000 from a
variety of campus departments, ranging
from Memorial Church to the Office of
Planning and Management. We were
unable to reach our $8,120 goal, though,
prompting several students to approach
undergraduate senator Russell Calleros
to sponsor a bill for the remaining funds.
Little did we know that the bill would
receive such harsh criticism from the
ASSU, mainly Students First members,
given the wide support we had received
from other departments.
The main argument given against the
bill, voiced so passionately by COP mem
ber John Overdeck, was that it would set
a poor financial precedent. Not one of
the organizations that we approached
expressed any concern about the prece
dent they would set by contributing

funds. They saw that the experience
would be extremely valuable to the stu
dents attending and to the Stanford
community as a whole.
Does the ASSU somehow operate on
stricter administrative guidelines than
any other organization on campus, limit
ing it from supporting positive student
coalition efforts?
As for the claim made by deputy senate
chair and Students First member Neil
Crellin of a conflict of interest involving
senator Jason Snyder, it is completely
unfounded. As was mentioned in the arti
cle, Snyder did not author any part of the
bill. He did attend the conference, and
accordingly removed himself from the vote
at the beginning of the meeting.
He was not going to get reimbursed for
any amount of money if the bill passed
anyway. He didn't pay for his air fare. We
had fund-raised for student air fares and

were short of our goal of $8,120 by $950.
Crellin knew this fact, yet continued to
press his preposterous claim on the sen
ate, in what seemed an obvious political
slander against Snyder.
In the end, the bill failed by a vote of 11-
9. It is important to note that the nine "No"
votes were all from Students First senators,
while the 11 "Yes" votes came from inde
pendent, People's Platform and Hammer
and Coffin senators. It is sad to realize that
a party which supposedly puts "students
first", instead seems blinded by their own
arrogance and political showboating.
