# What's next, a ban on bicycles and scooters?
## 
### 
I would like to publicly thank Vice
President for Public Affairs Bob Freelen
for finally ending the scourge of skate
boarding on our fair campus.
In my five years at Stanford, I have long
held much animosity towards those
destructive youths who would distract from
my ability to listen clearly to the inanimate
rumblings of one of my many professors.
I believe that we should take this
chance to clear up many other destruc
tive and distracting influences on our
campus. The noise has been tough on
my hangovers.
No more bikes with anything less than
silent wheels. I also want all bicycles to be
equipped with some sort of impeding
device that would keep them from travel
ing at more than, say, 10 miles per hour.
This is to ensure the safety of all stu
dents, both traveling and not.

Could the Delts please be banned
from owning scooters and motorcycles?
Many a time I have been peacefully
awakened by the sound of one of their
two-wheeled instruments of death going
past my window.
Plus, has anyone ever computed the
potential damage inherent in the com
bined speed of a scooter with the mass of
one of our larger linemen? Bill Walsh:
Keep your linemen safe!
In the "silence is bliss" department,
get rid of the jukebox at the coffee
house! Or at least put in some more
albums. Not only is it unnerving to lis
ten to the same song over and over,
there is once again the safety concern: I
might go into a drunken rampage due to
overuse of that damn thing.
I also agree that we need to cut down
on distractions in the classroom. Could
the professors please keep it down so
that I can sleep? Actually, the skate
boards served a purpose â€” they kept me
awake during those lectures.
Get rid of the cheerleaders. They are

noisy, irritating and I keep getting hit by
objects thrown at them by inept students.
No cheerleaders, fewer thrown objects.
Look, why not just wrap our entire
campus in pillows and not let anyone
talk above a whisper? Then everyone can
be nice and safe and happy, and us docile
little cows can continue our contented
mooing.
