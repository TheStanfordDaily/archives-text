# The 						crashing clamor is finally outlawed
## 
### 
As a member of the Public Affairs
staff concerned with the University's
relations with its neighbors, I should be
quite distressed to see young skate
boarders from nearby (and not so near
by) communities banned from the cen
tral campus.
However, I find myself delighted by
the new ordinance. We no longer will

hear the clamor of the skateboarders in
the front of the Quad, have to dodge
them as they speed by, watch them leap
onto benches and ledges, see them fly off
History Corner and receive their abuse
when we tell them this is a university
and not a public playground.
The Daily is fortunate that its offices are
far from the slamming and crashing of the
skateboarders. You also have not received
the many phone calls, letters, electronic
mail messages and personal communica
tions from faculty and staff strongly com
plaining about the daily invasion.
Some activities are appropriate to a
college campus, while others clearly are
not. Training for Olympic skateboard
competition is inappropriate.
Nearby cities have seen fit to ban the
activity. Why does The Daily think the
University should allow its people to be
disrupted and its property to be
destroyed to accommodate those visi
tors?
