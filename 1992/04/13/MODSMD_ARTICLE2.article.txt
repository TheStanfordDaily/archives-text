# Koppel: TV can play useful role in U.S. politics

Wearing a neon green baseball
cap, Ted Koppel can almost walk
around the Stanford campus unrec
ognized — almost, but not quite.
Koppel grabbed the attention
of several students Friday as he
sat answering questions in the
bright sunlight of White Plaza.
Passers-by gawked, attempted
skateboard stunts to get his atten
tion and approached him with
questions as he reminisced about
his college days at Stanford.
Koppel, who received a mas
ter's degree in speech and drama
in 1962, said he has maintained a
special relationship with Stanford,

because he "spent some of the hap
piest years of my youth and met
my wife" here. His wife Grace
graduated in 1967 with a degree in
communication.
When Koppel heard the produc
ers of "Nightline" wanted to do a
show on the West Coast — and the
only areas with appropriate facili
ties were UC-Berkeley and Stan
ford — he told them "there was no
choice involved," and the program
came to Stanford.
"The key to a program like this
is the interaction with a larger
audience," especially the kind of
audience that can be found at a
university like Stanford, he said.
Koppel said he doesn't think the
program's location was the reason
many leading candidates, including
President Bush and Arkansas Gov.
Bill Clinton, rejected invitations to
attend. Rather, he believes the topic
— "A Process Run Amok: Can It Be
Fixed?" — turned them off.
"The White House does not
want anything to do with a pro
gram like this," Koppel said,
"because they dislike the premise
that anything is wrong with the
political process."
Choosing each show's topic of
discussion is one of the most con
troversial and difficult parts of his
job, according to Koppel. Topics are

usually decided by members of the
"Nightline" staff "talking and
arguing" with one another, he said.
"Some days the news takes
care of the topic for us," he said.
Often several potential shows are
prepared for broadcast and an
entirely new one comes up at the

true communication,

last minute, he said.
The idea behind the discussion
topic for the Stanford broadcast
was more long-term in nature than
the daily news, he said. "Afler a
while, you hear a lot of people com
plaining about the presidential pro
cess, and the idea just grows on you
that this could be a good topic of
discussion," Koppel said.
And he has a personal feeling
that the political process needs
some sort of fixing. "Anytime the
majority of the public opts out of
the system and does not vote,
there is a good argument for prob
lems within the process," he said.
However, Koppel added that
television is not the real problem
in the political process. Television
is a useful aide for candidates
since it "reaches more people
cheaply and efficiently."

If anything, television is not
used enough, since "candidates
expend so much energy trying to
be everywhere and do everything,
that they don't have time to
think," he said.
The problem with television is
that candidates use it as a "sales
device," rather than a form of
communication, Koppel said.
Television "should not be elimi
nated, but instead used with sub
stance," he said.
The show qualifies as true com
munication, since it airs live, he
said. There are rehearsals, but
only to check equipment and prac
tice camera and lighting angles.
"The content we can't rehearse,"
Koppel said. "None of the people
on the show are here but me."
Koppel said the media coverage
of indirect-cost crises and budget
cuts has been painful for him, but
the Stanford community should be
"a little more thick-skinned" about
all of the scandals in the press.
"It's a bad time for those of us
who love Stanford, but the Universi
ty is dealing with it in a mature and
straightforward manner," he said.
University President Donald
Kennedy, who is a good friend and
a "great leader for the University,"
will be sorely missed by Koppel.
"I grieve for him because his last
year has been marred this way," he
said, adding that Kennedy "has
handled himself with great digni
ty," and deserves the community's
support.
