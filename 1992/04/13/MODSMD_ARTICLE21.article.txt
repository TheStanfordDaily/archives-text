## More postseason prominence: Gym lands first NCAA berth 
### Brandi Shipp Staff writer 
No one ever says that Minnesota is a
wonderful place to visit this time of
year, but the Stanford women's gym
nastics team would not want to head
anywhere else right now.
The women found out at 7:30 yes
terday morning that the 191.25 points
they garnered Saturday night at the
NCAA Western Regional Champi
onships at Berkeley helped to boost
their regional qualifying score to
191.08. The score was just enough to
earn them Stanford's first-ever team
spot at the NCAA Championships to be
held in St. Paul, Minnesota April 24-25.
The women's performance on Satur
day night, although not totally flawless,
was impressive enough for them to take
the number four spot in the seven-team
competition behind Oregon State,
UCLA, and California, who earned
193.775, 192.725, and 192.10 points,
respectively. "The girls did great," said
head coach Breck Greenwood. "It was a
high-pressure meet. This was the main
meet that we had been shooting for all
year. Even though no one said it, we
knew that it was all on the line."
The Cardinal squad traveled to
Berkeley on Saturday evening with one
goal in mind—to perform well enough
to be one of the 12 teams invited to the
NCAA's. "There was a lot of stress at
the regionals," Greenwood said. "Our
performance there determined whether
or not our season would continue. Hav
ing the season come to a screeching halt
would have been hard to swallow."
Once the meet began, however, the
Card pushed all worries and stress to
the back of their minds, and concen
trated on the task at hand. The Stan
ford gymnasts performed strongly on
most of the events. "I think that the
team did great," said sophomore Kerri
Kanuka. "We put it together just like
we were capable of doing."
Some of the Cardinal highlights
included an excellent showing on vault,
sparked by freshman Katie Clancy nail
ing both of her vaults, and freshman
Meegan Lannin sticking what Green
wood proclaimed as "the best vault I
have ever seen her do." The Card also
performed superbly on the bars, culmf-"
nating with freshman Jene Elzie plac
ing in the number six spot on that event

with a 9.825. Elzie hit her other rou
tines strongly enough to take home the
fifth-place ribbon in the all-around with
a 38.70.
The sole problematic event for Stan
ford in Saturday's competition was the
floor exercise, where they had a few
minor errors. "We had a couple of
breaks on floor, because our endurance
was down," Greenwood said. "We just
weren't as impressive as we could have
been."

'This was the main
meet that we had been
shooting for all year.
Even though no one
said it, we knew that it
was all on the line.'

Once again, another important fac
tor in the Cardinal's performance was
the strong and loud support they
received from the Stanford fans. Two
bus loads of Cardinal boosters headed
up to Berkeley to cheer on the women.
Packed on both sides of Harmon Gym,
the Stanford fans even outcheered the
California supporters on their own turf.
The team's minor flukes were not
enough to stand in the way of the Car
dinal's trip to the NCAA Champi
onships, the sweet realization of the
goal they set at the onset of the year.
"At the first meeting on September 17,
we decided our goal was to be a top-12
team," Clancy said. "The 7 a.m. prac
tices, the conditioning and working
hard, pushing ourselves when we really
didn't feel like it—this is what it was all
for."
Even though their record has as
many wins as losses, the Stanford gym
nasts and coaching staff feel that the
season has been nothing but a success.
"We definitely made a name for our
selves," Elzie said. "We went against
some great teams, and although we lost,
~we~aTtfr3ys gave"tHem~a goocl scare!** 7 "
Although their win-loss record was
important, a steady increase in perfor

mance level and team scores has been
Stanford's primary focus.
The Card's youth (four freshmen,
four sophomores, and one junior),
which could easily have been one of the
factors preventing them from a success
ful season, will prove even more advan
tageous next season. "Other teams have
a lot of graduating seniors, but for us,
this is just the beginning," Elzie said.
At the NCAA Championships, the
Stanford gymnasts, seeded in the No.
12 spot, will have to face off against the
other top 11 teams in the nation, five of
which will come from the Pac-10.
Nonetheless, they feel no substantial
pressure. "We are in a no-lose situa
tion," Greenwood said. "Whether we
take first or twelfth isn't important, as
long as we look like we belong there as a
team."
One of the problems that goes hand
in-hand with the Cardinal's first team
trip to the NCAA's is their presence
there being perceived by other more
traditional powers as a fluke, and that
the Stanford squad does not belong
there. "We know and have known that
we belong. We just have to prove it to
everybody else," Greenwood said.
The Cardinal squad plans no real
changes in their routines or their atti
tudes for the nationals. In fact, the
main tenet of their preparation for the
NCAA's is to not compare themselves to
the other teams, and to concentrate
only on their own routines and prepara
tion. "We are making absolutely no
changes or doing new tricks," Green
wood said. "What got us there is what
we do. We are at the 191-192 [team
point total] range, and as long as we can
do that, we can stay on our feet."
The Cardinal squad was also advised
by football head coach Bill Walsh, who
visited late last week, that they should
not try to beat anyone else, but just per
form their best. "When you start look
ing at other teams, you are making a
mistake," said Greenwood, echoing
Walsh's sentiments.
Despite the challenge that the Cardi
nal will face in Minnesota, they all agree
that the hardest part of the season con
cluded on Saturday night in Berkeley,
with their spot in the NCAA's being
their reward for a season of determina-
ITon^W"tleaicatlon. As Clancy said,
"Just going there already makes us
winners."

we decided our goal was to be a top-12
team," Clancy said. "The 7 a.m. prac
tices, the conditioning and working
hard, pushing ourselves when we really
didn't feel like it—this is what it was all
for."
Even though their record has as
many wins as losses, the Stanford gym
nasts and coaching staff feel that the
season has been nothing but a success.
"We definitely made a name for our
selves," Elzie said. "We went against
some great teams, and although we lost,
~we~aTtfr3ys gave"tHem~a goocl scare!** 7 "
Although their win-loss record was
important, a steady increase in perfor

mance level and team scores has been
Stanford's primary focus.
The Card's youth (four freshmen,
four sophomores, and one junior),
which could easily have been one of the
factors preventing them from a success
ful season, will prove even more advan
tageous next season. "Other teams have
a lot of graduating seniors, but for us,
this is just the beginning," Elzie said.
At the NCAA Championships, the
Stanford gymnasts, seeded in the No.
12 spot, will have to face off against the
other top 11 teams in the nation, five of
which will come from the Pac-10.
Nonetheless, they feel no substantial
pressure. "We are in a no-lose situa
tion," Greenwood said. "Whether we
take first or twelfth isn't important, as
long as we look like we belong there as a
team."
One of the problems that goes hand
in-hand with the Cardinal's first team
trip to the NCAA's is their presence
there being perceived by other more
traditional powers as a fluke, and that
the Stanford squad does not belong
there. "We know and have known that
we belong. We just have to prove it to
everybody else," Greenwood said.
The Cardinal squad plans no real
changes in their routines or their atti
tudes for the nationals. In fact, the
main tenet of their preparation for the
NCAA's is to not compare themselves to
the other teams, and to concentrate
only on their own routines and prepara
tion. "We are making absolutely no
changes or doing new tricks," Green
wood said. "What got us there is what
we do. We are at the 191-192 [team
point total] range, and as long as we can
do that, we can stay on our feet."
The Cardinal squad was also advised
by football head coach Bill Walsh, who
visited late last week, that they should
not try to beat anyone else, but just per
form their best. "When you start look
ing at other teams, you are making a
mistake," said Greenwood, echoing
Walsh's sentiments.
Despite the challenge that the Cardi
nal will face in Minnesota, they all agree
that the hardest part of the season con
cluded on Saturday night in Berkeley,
with their spot in the NCAA's being
their reward for a season of determina-
ITon^W"tleaicatlon. As Clancy said,
"Just going there already makes us
winners."

Freshman Jene Elzie performs on the beam on Saturday en route to an all-around score
of 38.70, good enough for fifth place at the Regionals. Stanford will be seeded No. 12
in its first-ever appearance in the NCAA Tournament finals.
No one ever says that Minnesota is a
wonderful place to visit this time of
year, but the Stanford women's gym
nastics team would not want to head
anywhere else right now.
The women found out at 7:30 yes
terday morning that the 191.25 points
they garnered Saturday night at the
NCAA Western Regional Champi
onships at Berkeley helped to boost
their regional qualifying score to
191.08. The score was just enough to
earn them Stanford's first-ever team
spot at the NCAA Championships to be
held in St. Paul, Minnesota April 24-25.
The women's performance on Satur
day night, although not totally flawless,
was impressive enough for them to take
the number four spot in the seven-team
competition behind Oregon State,
UCLA, and California, who earned
193.775, 192.725, and 192.10 points,
respectively. "The girls did great," said
head coach Breck Greenwood. "It was a
high-pressure meet. This was the main
meet that we had been shooting for all
year. Even though no one said it, we
knew that it was all on the line."
The Cardinal squad traveled to
Berkeley on Saturday evening with one
goal in mind—to perform well enough
to be one of the 12 teams invited to the
NCAA's. "There was a lot of stress at
the regionals," Greenwood said. "Our
performance there determined whether
or not our season would continue. Hav
ing the season come to a screeching halt
would have been hard to swallow."
Once the meet began, however, the
Card pushed all worries and stress to
the back of their minds, and concen
trated on the task at hand. The Stan
ford gymnasts performed strongly on
most of the events. "I think that the
team did great," said sophomore Kerri
Kanuka. "We put it together just like
we were capable of doing."
Some of the Cardinal highlights
included an excellent showing on vault,
sparked by freshman Katie Clancy nail
ing both of her vaults, and freshman
Meegan Lannin sticking what Green
wood proclaimed as "the best vault I
have ever seen her do." The Card also
performed superbly on the bars, culmf-"
nating with freshman Jene Elzie plac
ing in the number six spot on that event

with a 9.825. Elzie hit her other rou
tines strongly enough to take home the
fifth-place ribbon in the all-around with
a 38.70.
The sole problematic event for Stan
ford in Saturday's competition was the
floor exercise, where they had a few
minor errors. "We had a couple of
breaks on floor, because our endurance
was down," Greenwood said. "We just
weren't as impressive as we could have
been."

'This was the main
meet that we had been
shooting for all year.
Even though no one
said it, we knew that it
was all on the line.'
— Breck Greenwood

Once again, another important fac
tor in the Cardinal's performance was
the strong and loud support they
received from the Stanford fans. Two
bus loads of Cardinal boosters headed
up to Berkeley to cheer on the women.
Packed on both sides of Harmon Gym,
the Stanford fans even outcheered the
California supporters on their own turf.
The team's minor flukes were not
enough to stand in the way of the Car
dinal's trip to the NCAA Champi
onships, the sweet realization of the
goal they set at the onset of the year.
"At the first meeting on September 17,
