# Adams, Sepeda lead Card to ASU series win
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
The Arizona State baseball team was out on the
field last Friday for a little pre-game, but they
weren't running warm-ups, they weren't doing any
fielding drills, and they weren't taking BP. The Sun
Devils were honing their kicking skills with a soccer
ball that someone had procured. This made some of
the Stanford players mad.
"You gotta respect your opponent," said Willie
Adams. "A-State didn't respect us. They weren't get
ting ready, out there kicking a soccer ball around."
The Stanford baseball team earned some respect
by taking two of three games from conference-lead
ing Arizona State. And in the process, the Card
rediscovered their temporarily misplaced pitching.
Stanford came out on fire in the first game and
gave starter Adams plenty to work with after a five
run-first, the main blow of which was a two-run
shot by Mark Skeels.
But Adams didn't even need all the run support.
The right-hander had a no-hitter going into the
sixth, a one-hitter going into the ninth, and fin
ished by allowing only four hits and two runs, both
coming in the top of the ninth. Adams almost
became the first pitcher to shut Arizona State out
in three years with the 11-2 win.
Saturday featured a pitching matchup which
seemed to indicate a pitchers' duel slightly in Stan
ford's favor. However, Cardinal Rick Helling didn't
have his usually great stuff, perhaps trying to be a lit
tle too perfect in his pitching, having little confidence
in the Cardinal offense, and even less in its defense.
Stanford committed an astounding three errors
in the top of the third inning, four in the game, and
made some other questionable plays in the field.
However, despite being down 3-0 in the bottom of
the fifth, the Cardinal rallied. Following back-to
back walks, Jeffrey Hammonds hit a homer to left
to knot the game at three. Unfortunately, the Sun
Devils weren't through, and scored four more runs
to eventually win the game 7-4.
"You can't make those errors and expect to win,"
said Marquess. "At this level, if you make three or
four errors, you're gonna lose."
Sunday presented the rubber game with Cardinal
Jamie Sepeda getting the call over Brian Sackinsky
to go up against Arizona State's Brent Smith, and
did Sepeda ever deliver. Sepeda went the distance,
and in his nine innings of work allowed only two
runs on five hits while striking out eight in a 9-2 win.
"You gotta give Jamie credit," said Marquess.
"He always came up with the big pitch. When he
needed a big out, he got it."
Behind him, the Cardinal bats proved that they
would not be silenced two games in a row. Stanford
scored nine runs on nine hits, including a solo home
run by Hammonds in the eighth, who ended up
going 6-13 in the series with two round-trippers,
two stolen bases, six runs, five RBI, and excellent
play in the field.
In the series, the Cardinal once again outhit its
opponent 25-19. With the two wins, Stanford
increased its record to 23-15, 9-9 in the Six Pac
while Arizona State dropped to 25-14, 10-8 in con
ference play.
