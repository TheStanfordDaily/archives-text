## 
### Peter Marks Staff writer 
It took a near-perfect performance at the
NCAA Western Regionals on Saturday for the
Nebraska Cornhuskers to prove that Stanford's
men's gymnastics team can be beaten.
Making only two misses during the entire
competition as compared to 10 by Stanford,
Nebraska's score of 286.175 still only beat the
Cardinal by nine-tenths of a point. Brigham
Young University took third place while UCLA
rounded out the top four teams in the West.
"This is encouraging because we weren't try
ing to peak yet," said Stanford coach Sadao
Hamada.
Jair Lynch led the way for the Cardinal, tak
ing third in the all-around competition with a
score of 57.9. The junior racked up individual
wins in the pommel horse and parallel bar
events with scores of 9.9.
Lynch's teammates also turned in solid per
formances. Junior Jeff Bender placed second on
the parallel bars and fourth on the horizontal
bar. Josh Stein, a freshman getting his first
taste of post-season competition, took fourth in
the floor exercise.
Senior co-captain Tim Ryan took top honors
among his teammates in the rings competition
with a 9.775, that earned him third place.
The top four teams at the NCAA Regionals
advance to the NCAA Championships in two
weeks where they will be joined by the winners
of the Eastern Regionals (Ohio State, Minneso
ta, lowa and Penn State).
Although Hamada said he is confident in his
team's chances at beating Nebraska when they
meet again, the Cornhuskers will have one huge
advantage — the home court. The champi
onships will take place among an audience of
rabid Cornhusker fans in Lincoln, Nebraska.
To combat the home crowd, Hamada believes
Stanford must be three points better than
Nebraska. This is a challenge he says his gym
nasts are capable of meeting.
"Nebraska has peaked. Hitting 34 out of 36
routines is incredible," Hamada said. "By elimi
nating our misses, we can get them."
Another point source that the Cardinal hope
to tap is the quality of their performances com
pared to those of Nebraska. According to Hama
da, in the next two weeks, Stanford gymnasts
will push the levels of difficulty and originality
in their routines in the hopes that it will boost
them into first place at the Championships.
"The guys are psyched," Hamada said.
"We're going 120% for the next week-and-a-half
and we're going to kick ass."
