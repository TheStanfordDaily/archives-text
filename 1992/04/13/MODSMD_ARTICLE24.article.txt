# Tennis trounces Arizona, ASU in warmup for USC rematch
## Men to face defending champs Friday in L.A. 
### Brian Egan Editorial staff 
The No. 1 Stanford men's ten
nis team continued its march
towards postseason prominence
this weekend by scoring impres
sive wins over Arizona and Ari
zona State at Stanford Tennis
Stadium.
"If you asked me about our
shot [at an NCAA title] at the
start of the season, I would have
been pretty skeptical," said senior
Alex O'Brien. "Now, I feel a whole
lot better about it."
If the key to success on a
national level lies in fielding a
strong lineup at all nine positions,
then the Cardinal (17-1 overall)
has a lot to feel good about,
defeating banged-up yet scrappy
Arizona and ASU teams 8-1 and
7-2, respectively.
O'Brien, the No. 2 singles play
er in the country, blew the Wild
cats' Matt Holt out of the water,
winning 6-0, 6-0 in less than an
hour. Saturday, he defeated Chris
Gambino of ASU in straight sets
as well, 6-3, 6-3, even though
O'Brien looked a bit sluggish
after jumping out to a quick 5-0
advantage in the first set.
"I felt pretty much on fire
[against Holt]," said the senior.
"But it was a little frustrating
playing Gambino. You had to
wonder if he should have been out
there at all (Gambino played with
a broken left wrist)."

'It's important that
we go to L.A. com
peting well at every
position, as we did
this weekend.'
— Dick Gould

Stanford coach Dick Gould
also questioned the placement of
Gambino at first singles. "In my
mind, Alex wasn't playing their
legitimate No. 1, and he got a lit
tle careless," he said. "Still,
[O'Brien] has had such a great
season for us so far, that in his
situation (against Gambino),
you've got to give him the benefit
of the doubt."
Sophomores Michael Flanagan
and Vimal Patel split their two
matches, both winning against
Arizona and losing to their Sun
Devil oppponent in three sets.
Patel's performance against
ASU's Ross Matheson was
impressive despite his being on
the short end of the 6-7, 7-6, 7-6
final score. Matheson, perhaps
the Sun Devils' top singles player,
forced Patel to shift his strategy
from a power game to serve-and
volley in the third set.
Gould was particularly
impressed with Patel's ability to
change his game so smoothly in

the middle of his match. "[Patel]
is in the process of making a
gigantic leap in terms of his level
of play," said the coach, who
recently moved Patel from fifth to
third singles. "I was very pleased
with the adjustments that he
made against Matheson."
Playing at No. 4 to No. 6 sin
gles, sophomores Chris Cocotos
and Robert Devens and senior
Jason Yee all won both of their
weekend matches.
O'Brien and Cocotos, who
were rested at first doubles
against Arizona after the Cardi
nal clinched a team win in singles,
scored a 6-2, 6-4 win against
ASU's crippled duo of Gambino
and Bryan Geiger. The Yee-Patel
and Devens-Flanagan pairs won
their two weekend matches, giv
ing Stanford's top three doubles
teams a 25-2 record on the year.
The Cardinal faces unranked
Utah on Tuesday before travel
ling to Los Angeles this weekend
to face USC and UCLA. The Tro
jans, who handed Stanford its
only loss of the season April 5,
actually dropped two slots to No.
6 in the latest poll after losing to
the No. 10 Bruins.
"It's going to be a real chal
lenge down south," said Gould.
"We're not the kind of team that
is going to walk onto the court
and blow someone out, and it's
important that we go to L.A. com
peting well at every position, as
we did this weekend."

situation (against Gambino),
you've got to give him the benefit
of the doubt."
Sophomores Michael Flanagan
and Vimal Patel split their two
matches, both winning against
Arizona and losing to their Sun
Devil oppponent in three sets.
Patel's performance against
ASU's Ross Matheson was
impressive despite his being on
the short end of the 6-7, 7-6, 7-6
final score. Matheson, perhaps
the Sun Devils' top singles player,
forced Patel to shift his strategy
from a power game to serve-and
volley in the third set.
Gould was particularly
impressed with Patel's ability to
change his game so smoothly in

the middle of his match. "[Patel]
is in the process of making a
gigantic leap in terms of his level
of play," said the coach, who
recently moved Patel from fifth to
third singles. "I was very pleased
with the adjustments that he
made against Matheson."
Playing at No. 4 to No. 6 sin
gles, sophomores Chris Cocotos
and Robert Devens and senior
Jason Yee all won both of their
weekend matches.
O'Brien and Cocotos, who
were rested at first doubles
against Arizona after the Cardi
nal clinched a team win in singles,
scored a 6-2, 6-4 win against
ASU's crippled duo of Gambino
and Bryan Geiger. The Yee-Patel
and Devens-Flanagan pairs won
their two weekend matches, giv
ing Stanford's top three doubles
teams a 25-2 record on the year.
The Cardinal faces unranked
Utah on Tuesday before travel
ling to Los Angeles this weekend
to face USC and UCLA. The Tro
jans, who handed Stanford its
only loss of the season April 5,
actually dropped two slots to No.
6 in the latest poll after losing to
the No. 10 Bruins.
"It's going to be a real chal
lenge down south," said Gould.
"We're not the kind of team that
is going to walk onto the court
and blow someone out, and it's
important that we go to L.A. com
peting well at every position, as
we did this weekend."
