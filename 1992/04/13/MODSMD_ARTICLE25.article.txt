# Track outruns Reno
## 
### Nick Clements Staff writer 
Saturday's home track and
field meet introduced a new con
cept to spectators — the two
hour combined men and women's
meet — and if the Cardinal
coaching staff has any say in the
matter, shorter meets will be a
permanent fixture in the sport.
"When professional football
eliminates the instant replay in
order to cut down on the game
lengths, maybe track and field
should start thinking about doing
the same," said Stanford head
coach Brooks Johnson after the
Cardinal dominated most of their
events in head-to-head competi
tion against Nevada-Reno.
"A long time ago when only
men competed in track and field,
the meets would be a lot shorter,"
Johnson continued. "However,
since today's meets are combined,
you can't expect people to stay at
a meet for an entire day.
Stanford assistant coach Scott
Chisam agreed with Johnson in
his support of condensed meets.
"The concept of the two-hour
meet is something that we'll be
continuing in the future," he said.
Despite the Cardinal's over
whelming team success, Nevada-
Reno's Kamy Keshmiri, who is
the defending NCAA champion in
the discus throw, turned in what
was probably the most outstand
ing individual performance of the
day. Keshmiri's discus throw of
206 feet was the longest colle
giate toss of the year and ended
Stanford junior Pat Stowell's

undefeated college streak at
home. Stowell wound up placing
second with a throw of 169'3".
One of the highlights for Stan
ford was the return of sophomore
Dana Weeks in the triple jump.
Weeks qualified for the Pacific 10
Championships with a leap of
38'0" after being out for the last
two months with a foot problem.
"It's good to see Dana back out
there," said assistant coach Betsy
Riccardi.
In the field events, sophomore
Dave Popejoy continued his
incredible success this spring in
the hammer throw by winning
with a throw of 208'3". Popejoy
will be heading to both the Pac-10
and NCAA Championships when
summer roles around.
Senior Fred Carter, whose main
event is the 3000-meter steeple
chase, instead ran in the 5000
meters and took the event with a
time of 14:32.9, setting a personal
record by over 25 seconds.
Chisam and Riccardi both
stressed the continued focus on
Stanford's freshmen, who are
playing a key role in several events
and are essential to the team's
future. Freshmen John Price and
Travis Clark finished 1-2 in the
200-meter dash while frosh Anne
Lee took second to Weeks in the
triple jump with a Pac-10 qualify
ing leap of 37'11 1/2".
"It's very easy to get mentally
blown out as a freshman," said
Chisam. "A high school season
usually builds up to the end of the
season while in college you have
to maintain a very high level of
intensity all season long."

The agony of second place: Travis Clark crosses the finish line a
mere 0.02 seconds behind fellow Card John Price in the 200-meter
dash on Saturday. Stanford dominated nearly every event in its dual
meet with Nevada-Reno.
