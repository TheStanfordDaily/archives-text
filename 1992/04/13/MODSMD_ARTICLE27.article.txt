# Good golf! Linksters continue late surge
## Women second at SJSU 
### Tish Williams Staff Writer 
In a great weekend for golf, the Stanford
women's golf team came another step closer to
the top of the collegiate standings. The Cardi
nal squad has taken off in the spring season,
surging up to second place in both its last tour
naments, belying its No. 5 ranking.
In its most recent accomplishment, the Car
dinal placed second in the San Jose State Inter
collegiate held at Bayonet Golf Course in Mon
terey. Stanford put in a strong performance to
finish with a team total of 931 strokes, 19 behind
the No. 2 team in the nation, San Jose State.
"This is a talented group, with seven strong
players," said Cardinal coach Tim Baldwin.
"This will give us good momentum going into
the [Pacific 10 Conference Championshipsl.
We played really well in the fall, and I am
anticipating a strong team effort at Pac-10's."
This weekend's finish puts the Cardinal in a
good position to challenge top-ranked Arizona,
who defeated Stanford earlier in the year, at
the Pac-10 Championships to be held April 24-
26 at Arizona State.
Audrey Wooding came through for the Car
dinal on the extremely challenging course, fin
ishing third behind two of San Jose State's
nationally-ranked amateur players. It was a
close finish, with San Jose State's Ninni Stern
er winning with 224 strokes, Tracy Hanson
placing second with 225 strokes, and Stan
ford's Wooding coming in third at 226, just a
step behind.
"It felt awesome," Wooding said. "This is my
fourth year on the course, and every year before
I played poorly. This is such a relief. This gives
me great confidence for Pac-10's, knowing I can
come down only a few shots behind, yet still
make great shots and good putts."
In her second top-10 finish of the spring

after a shaky fall season, Martha Richards fin
ished eighth with 232 strokes. Richards hit a
consistent 79-76-77 in the three day tourney.
"After three years of basketball, Martha has
become a full-time addition for us," Baldwin
said." She's a tremendous boost for us with
her power game and leadership."
Close behind came Adele Moore, who start
ed out slow with an 83, but managed to make
up the difference in the final two days, shoot
ing a 74 and 78, good for eleventh place.
Sophomore Melinda Daniels placed 20th
individually, with an 80-84-79, putting in a
strong finish for the Cardinal, and freshman
Jamille Jose shot an 78-85-83 after leading
Stanford two weeks ago in Hawaii.
Stanford has gained considerable momen
tum in only two tournaments since their long
layoff. This bodes well for the Cardinal's
chances of dethroning a powerhouse Arizona
team in Pac-10's, as well as San Jose State at
the NCAA Championships.
This was an especially good performance for
the Cardinal, taking into account the Bayonet
Golf Course, which is the toughest Stanford
plays on all year.
"That course can just come out and grab
you at any time," Wooding said. "We'll be fine
as long as we stay cool and realize the golf
course is do-able (at Pac-10's). . .we already
showed (Arizona) in Hawaii that we can com
pete with them. I'm feeling very confident."
