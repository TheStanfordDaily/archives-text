# Men travel to Santa Cruz

They have soared to new heights, and now
they're looking to fly even higher.
For the Stanford men's golf team, the 1992
season has been a quest for the "perfect"
match, one in which everything falls into place
and the squad plays up to its elusive "poten

tial." Last week, the Cardinal went a long way
toward reaching its goals, as it came away
from USC's Southwestern Invitiational with a
fourth place finish in a strong field.
Stanford will look to continue its ascent in
the Far Western Intercollegiate Invitational
tournament over the next three days at the
Pasatiempo Country Club in San Jose. The
squad will be tested by what head coach Wally
Goodwin called "an old golf course, but one of
the best in California." In addition to being
one of the oldest and best sites in the state,
Pasatiempo was also referred to by Goodwin
as "one of the most difficult courses" on which
the Cardinal has to compete all season.
Stanford's linksters will also be challenged
by yet another strong field. Host San Jose
State, already an excellent team, should bene
fit even more from its home course advantage,
while Pacific 10 Conference and national
rivals will be looking to prevent the Cardinal
from affirming its place among collegiate
golfs finest.
The Cardinal lineup will look much like it
has over the past few tournaments. Sophomore
Notah Begay, senior Christian Cevaer, sopho
more Casey Martin, and junior Brad Lanning
will comprise Stanford's top four golfers. The
final two spots were earned by a pair of young
but experienced freshmen, Steve Burdick and
Jerry Chang, in qualifying play last week.
The Far Western tourney employs a unique
scoring system over the 54-hole, three-day
competition. Each day, the top four of a
team's six individual tallies will be added; this
means that the golfers can be slightly more
aggressive in their play than they would be if
only one score were dropped.
Furthermore, after Tuesday's second
round, a cut will be made and the field limited
to 15 teams (plus any ties at the 15th posi
tion). For the Cardinal, this means that its
tradition of starting slowly must be overcome
if they harbor any hope of even finishing the
tournament Wednesday.
