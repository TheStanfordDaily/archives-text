# Limited involvement of crowd disappoints some

Before the television cameras started rolling,
Beth Bradach sat in the back row of Dinkelspiel
Auditorium writing and rewriting the question
she planned to ask the politicians who were
scheduled to appear on ABC News "Nightline."
But like most people who had been asked by
producers to bring questions, Bradach never
got her chance. Instead, the single mother and
her 10-year-old son Jesse sat quietly in the
back row of Dinkelspiel Auditorium, munching
giant pretzels Jesse had fmagled from a vendor
who was closing up for the night.
Bradach, A member of the East Palo Alto Board
of Urban Ministries, was one of an estimated 30 to
40 people hand-picked by "Nightline" producers
to quiz candidates during the 90-minute town
meeting. Of these, only six made it to the micro
phones during the often tense discussion.
The majority of air time went to television
commentator Pat Buchanan, former California
Gov. Jerry Brown and former pres
idential candidate Jesse Jackson.
While moderator Ted Koppel
struggled to keep control, the men
took advantage of the national pub
licity to push their platforms, and
in Brown's case, to "flatly deny"
allegations of drug-filled parties at
his home while he was governor.
Koppel apologized during and
after the show for the town meet
ing run amok. He said he hoped it
was the "beginning of a process"
through which issues surround
ing the presidential campaign
could be discussed.
Selwyn Whitehead, president
of the Economic Empowerment
Foundation, criticized the control
the "Nightline" staff seemed to
exert over the audience during
the program.
"The media controls access to
the candidates," said Whitehead,
who asked how America would "get
out of the economic quagmire if the
reporters only focused on candi
date's sexual and drug histories."
But after the program, Koppel
defended the town meeting's
"rehearsed spontaneity" that
only allowed select people to ask
the politicians questions.
"Of course it's orchestrated,"
Koppel said. "We're not just going
to put cameras out there and pho
tograph the kids."
Eric Alterman, a graduate stu
dent in history who criticized con
temporary leaders when he got
the microphone, said his "Night
line" contact was careful not to
"put words in [his] mouth."
But everyone who spoke had
something written down before
hand, third-year law student David
Forst said. A producer had at least a
dozen questions typed out on a clip
board, including his own, Forst said.
The law student waited at a

microphone for 20 minutes, but
the show ended before he got to
ask the politicians whether "a
candidate who promised some
voters pain" was electable.
Once ushers seated the approxi
mately 600 audience members,
"Nightline" staff flitted around
preparing questioners for the show.
Stray audience members were sent
back to their seats. A cluster of Jerry
Brown supporters were admitted
only after they put away their signs,
some of which read, "ABC lies."
Sophomore Rafe Sagarin said a
"Nightline" representative told
them, " 'No signs. No signs.'...
She made us put them down and
walk away before she would give
us (stand-by) tickets."
During the program, producers
camped in a truck outside outside
of Braun Music Center radioed
instructions to several stern-look
ing assistants, who brought audi
ence members to microphones
when it looked as if discussion
would tie in to their questions.
But they warned them that a
trip to the microphone did not
mean they would get to pose their
questions.
"It can be wrenching and disap
pointing when you get up next and
then we have to tell you to sit down
because the show moves away
from your point," producer Dan
Morris said to audience members
before the show.
Many said it was more disap
pointing that the show never got
to their point in the first place.
Alterman said it took Nightline
"a long time to figure out how
much time they wasted."
Forst blamed the politicians for
much of the town meeting's disor
der. And it was good, he said, that
President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton
of Arkansas refused to speak. "The
more politicians, the more mucked
up the show would have been."
