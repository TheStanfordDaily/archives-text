# Rowers surprise in Sac State meet
## 
### Mike McDonough 
Gone are the days when the
nation's top crew teams could
dismiss Stanford Crew as an
upstart program, one they didn't
need to watch.
Soon, they may be watching
Stanford from behind.
The men's and women's crew
teams came up with victories
against Sacramento State on
Saturday in all but one boat. The
women's first and second frosh
boats beat Sac State by over six
seconds each, while the varsity
men left the Hornets behind by
over 14 seconds. The frosh men
rounded out the victories for the
Cardinal, drubbing Sac State by
a whopping 46 seconds.
"It's surprising we won by so
much," said men's head coach Wies
law Kujda. "This is a time to push,
and they met the challenge."
The performances were espe
cially encouraging for the Cardi
nal after a lackluster showing at
the San Diego regatta last week,
where the men qualified far back
in a field consisting of many Pacif
ic Coast teams, including the uni
versity of Washington and Cal.
"What I am pleased with is
that, especially after San Diego,
most coaches would expect a
physical letdown," noted Kujda.
"We stressed hard work this

week, and to my surprise, the
team didn't show a drop, but an
improvement. There's a new
attitude on the team now, and
that's proof that we're improv
ing day by day."
Though the women's crew
didn't run a varsity boat against
Sac State, head coach Wendy
Davis was just as pleased with
her team's performance.
"I'm relieved because it's
always a tough week after San
Diego, but we picked it up and won
two close races," said Davis. "Our
second boat was behind halfway
through the race, but came back
to win."
Endurance was the key to the
Cardinal women's victory,
according to Davis. "We were
persistent and made the other
team fold. It's always good for
the team when you can do that."
Davis sees next week's
matchup against UC-Davis as a
key tuneup going into the
Potomac Regatta in two weeks.
"We're always asking our
selves, 'Are we sharp? Are we
attacking them?' I think we saw
that at Sac State. I'm hoping we
see it at UC-Davis as well."
And what if the men's and
women's teams can answer those
questions in the affirmative?
"Then we can make it busi
ness as usual."
