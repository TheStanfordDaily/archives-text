# 'Brother Jed' returns to urge repentance
## 
### Angie Chuang Editorial staff 
"Do you believe in God?" the
preacher standing on a chair in
White Plaza on Friday afternoon
yelled at senior Debby Redish.
Redish, standing among a
gathering crowd of students,
yelled back, "I'm agnostic!"
Jed Smock, a pastor from Ohio
— known to Stanford students as
Brother Jed — threw up his
hands in frustration and uttered a
noise of disgust.
Redish jeered as other students
joined her. She and the other stu
dents had been listening to, chal
lenging and often laughing at the
fiery — and often shocking — ser
mon that she described as "kind
of a Stanford tradition."
Stanford is just one of the 600
college campuses that Smock has
preached at over the last two
decades. He has spoken at schools
in 49 states — all except Alaska —
and abroad as well. He said he
tries to visit Stanford once a year.
Wearing a business suit and
standing on an old wooden chair
during his oratory, he urged a
generally unreceptive but curious
audience to repent, alternating
ominous warnings about Christ's
second coming with anecdotes
and often extreme opinions on a
wide variety of social issues.
At one point in his sermon, one
of the students in the crowd called
out, "Tell 'The Dark Room' stop'!"
After a bit of mock hesitation,
he recounted his days as a "frat
boy" at Indiana State University,
when the basement was dubbed
"The Dark Room."
"And girls, this 'Dark Room' was
not used for developing film if you
know what I mean," he said, raising
his eyebrows. "This room had no
windows and leather couches. Boys,
do you know what leather does to
women? It makes them crazy!"
The crowd snickered as Smock
continued, almost bragging about
his college sexual exploits, a sharp
contrast to his fire and brimstone
preaching.
And Smock is a man of sharp
contrasts — he is as intellectual and
calm in a one-on-one conversation
as he is wildly impassioned while
preaching to students.
"He's remarkably rational when
you discuss something with him,"
said Redish, who stayed for a couple

of hours on Friday afternoon,
engaged in a heated debate with
Smock. "But you know when he
raises his voice, he's going to go off."
Smock, a former history pro
fessor at the University of Wis
consin, Lacrosse, said he preaches
at colleges because of that aca
demic background — it is a natu
ral setting for him.
"I could preach in a church, but
the people who go there have
already repented," he said. "Preach
ing on campuses is the best way to
reach people, since the typical col
lege student sleeps in on Sunday
mornings."
Smock hopes he can influence
students to read the Bible. "They
could be greatly profitted intellec
tually and academically if they read
it,"he said. "At least then they
could make intelligent judgments
about what I am preaching."
He admitted that his speeches
are often "vulgar," but said it is
his way of catching the students'
attention and relating to them.
"But I have my limits," he said. "I

never use four-letter words."
Smock said that although he
does get "heckled" when he
preaches at Stanford, the stu
dents ask questions "of higher
caliber than at most universities."
And at other schools, Smock
said, he has been spat upon, pushed
off his chair, mobbed and even
arrested for his own protection.

'I never use four
letter words.'
—Jed Smock

Despite these negative reactions,
he feels students take him "more
seriously than they let on or want to
admit to themselves or their peers."
He said it is "not unusual" for
him to return to a campus and
find students who laughed at him
the year before tell him that they
have "converted to Christianity
and started reading the Bible."

Perhaps his most significant
convert, he said, was a University
of Florida woman to whom he
pointed and yelled, "Repent of
your sins, you wicked woman!"
She did repent, and started
preaching herself, Smock said.
She and Smock kept in touch
through the preaching circuit,
and eventually got married. Now
Smock and his wife often go to
campuses together to give stu
dents a "one-two punch."
Many students, like sophomore
Judith Robinson, said they find
Smock's attitude "offensive," and
expressed indifference about his
presence on campus. "I don't
resent his preaching on campus,
but I do resent his attitude that if
you don't believe in what he's say
ing, you're doomed to hell,"
Robinson said.
But others, like Redish, con
cluded that his rhetoric adds color
to the campus.
"He's a strange one," she said,
"but Stanford wouldn't be the
same without him."

dents had been listening to, chal
lenging and often laughing at the
fiery — and often shocking — ser
mon that she described as "kind
of a Stanford tradition."
Stanford is just one of the 600
college campuses that Smock has
preached at over the last two
decades. He has spoken at schools
in 49 states — all except Alaska —
and abroad as well. He said he
tries to visit Stanford once a year.
Wearing a business suit and
standing on an old wooden chair
during his oratory, he urged a
generally unreceptive but curious
audience to repent, alternating
ominous warnings about Christ's
second coming with anecdotes
and often extreme opinions on a
wide variety of social issues.
At one point in his sermon, one
of the students in the crowd called
out, "Tell 'The Dark Room' stop'!"
After a bit of mock hesitation,
he recounted his days as a "frat
boy" at Indiana State University,
when the basement was dubbed
"The Dark Room."
"And girls, this 'Dark Room' was
not used for developing film if you
know what I mean," he said, raising
his eyebrows. "This room had no
windows and leather couches. Boys,
do you know what leather does to
women? It makes them crazy!"
The crowd snickered as Smock
continued, almost bragging about
his college sexual exploits, a sharp
contrast to his fire and brimstone
preaching.
And Smock is a man of sharp
contrasts — he is as intellectual and
calm in a one-on-one conversation
as he is wildly impassioned while
preaching to students.
"He's remarkably rational when
you discuss something with him,"
said Redish, who stayed for a couple

of hours on Friday afternoon,
engaged in a heated debate with
Smock. "But you know when he
raises his voice, he's going to go off."
Smock, a former history pro
fessor at the University of Wis
consin, Lacrosse, said he preaches
at colleges because of that aca
demic background — it is a natu
ral setting for him.
"I could preach in a church, but
the people who go there have
already repented," he said. "Preach
ing on campuses is the best way to
reach people, since the typical col
lege student sleeps in on Sunday
mornings."
Smock hopes he can influence
students to read the Bible. "They
could be greatly profitted intellec
tually and academically if they read
it,"he said. "At least then they
could make intelligent judgments
about what I am preaching."
He admitted that his speeches
are often "vulgar," but said it is
his way of catching the students'
attention and relating to them.
"But I have my limits," he said. "I

never use four-letter words."
Smock said that although he
does get "heckled" when he
preaches at Stanford, the stu
dents ask questions "of higher
caliber than at most universities."
And at other schools, Smock
said, he has been spat upon, pushed
off his chair, mobbed and even
arrested for his own protection.

'I never use four
letter words.'
—Jed Smock

Despite these negative reactions,
he feels students take him "more
seriously than they let on or want to
admit to themselves or their peers."
He said it is "not unusual" for
him to return to a campus and
find students who laughed at him
the year before tell him that they
have "converted to Christianity
and started reading the Bible."

Perhaps his most significant
convert, he said, was a University
of Florida woman to whom he
pointed and yelled, "Repent of
your sins, you wicked woman!"
She did repent, and started
preaching herself, Smock said.
She and Smock kept in touch
through the preaching circuit,
and eventually got married. Now
Smock and his wife often go to
campuses together to give stu
dents a "one-two punch."
Many students, like sophomore
Judith Robinson, said they find
Smock's attitude "offensive," and
expressed indifference about his
presence on campus. "I don't
resent his preaching on campus,
but I do resent his attitude that if
you don't believe in what he's say
ing, you're doomed to hell,"
Robinson said.
But others, like Redish, con
cluded that his rhetoric adds color
to the campus.
"He's a strange one," she said,
"but Stanford wouldn't be the
same without him."

Jed Smock, better known to Stanford students as Brother Jed, works the crowd in White Plaza Friday
afternoon. The fiery Ohio preacher has spoken on 600 campuses in 49 states during the past two
decades and tries to visit Stanford annually.
"Do you believe in God?" the
preacher standing on a chair in
White Plaza on Friday afternoon
yelled at senior Debby Redish.
Redish, standing among a
gathering crowd of students,
yelled back, "I'm agnostic!"
Jed Smock, a pastor from Ohio
— known to Stanford students as
Brother Jed — threw up his
hands in frustration and uttered a
noise of disgust.
