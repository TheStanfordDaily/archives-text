# Edmonds hears complaints of staff at Cowell

### Holly Hacker Senior staff writer 
At the request of Vice President for Student
Resources Mary Edmonds, Cowell staff members
who spoke with her at a Friday meeting are not
commenting on the details of their discussion,
which was expected to focus on tensions between
the health center's administration and staff.
About eight Cowell staff members attended
Friday's meeting, which lasted about an hour
and-a-half, Edmonds said, adding that their
meeting consisted of "an open sharing on a variety
of topics," the details of which she would not offer.
Edmonds, who was called an "excellent listener"
by one Cowell employee, said, "I just heard one side
of the story." She said her next step is "to meet
with other people" — including Cowell Director
Harvey Weinstein and Cowell Assoc. Director Jane
Meier — and "try to figure out what is going on."
Cowell physician Irene Cannon described the
problem as a "crisis of confidence" in Cowell
administrators.
John Dorman, another staff doctor, conceded
that tensions within Cowell were discussed, say
ing, "Some of that stuff was brought up." Howev
er, he added, "It's our laundry" and "we ought to
keep it to ourselves."
One tension within Cowell relates to last year's
decision, approved by Weinstein, to terminate
Cowell's relationship with the Palo Alto Medical
Foundation — a group that had provided primary
and specialty health care as well as referral ser
vices at Cowell for more than 45 years — and con
tract with the School of Medicine's Faculty Prac
tice Program instead.
The discontent is not directed against the Faculty
