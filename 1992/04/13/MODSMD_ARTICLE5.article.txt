# 2 COP hopefuls drop out of slates
## Illegal posting of fliers investigated 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
A "degrading" joke, an ineligi
ble candidate and several improp
erly posted fliers were among the
issues considered this weekend in
the campaign for Council of Pres
idents.
Senior Paul Kwon, a member
of the"I Prefer Not to Have a
COP" slate, resigned from the
race, saying he was offended by a
statement the group falsely
attributed to him in the ASSU
spring election handbook.
According to Kwon, the elec
tions handbook biographies for
members of the Prefer slate each
had a fake entry — intended to be
humorous — along with several
genuine biographical entries.
The entry after Kwon's name:
"President, Men Whose Eyes
Tend To Wander Down To
Breasts While Talking To
Women, Anonymous." The state
ment "bothered" him, Kwon said.
"I didn't write the comment,
and I had no knowledge that it
was going to be written," Kwon
said. "When they start being
degrading or offensive like that, I
can't tolerate that."
Kwon added, however, that he
"still supports" the Prefer slate's
platform.
According to senior Ted Lai,
another member of the Prefer slate,
slate member Ed Mun prepared the
statement that appeared in the elec
tion handbook just before the dead
line for submissions, and he did not
have time to show the statement to
the other slate members.
"We all didn't realize it would
create such a big deal," Lai said.
Mun could not be reached for
comment.
