# 2 COP hopefuls drop out of slates
## Illegal posting of fliers investigated 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
A "degrading" joke, an ineligi
ble candidate and several improp
erly posted fliers were among the
issues considered this weekend in
the campaign for Council of Pres
idents.
Senior Paul Kwon, a member
of the"I Prefer Not to Have a
COP" slate, resigned from the
race, saying he was offended by a
statement the group falsely
attributed to him in the ASSU
spring election handbook.
According to Kwon, the elec
tions handbook biographies for
members of the Prefer slate each
had a fake entry — intended to be
humorous — along with several
genuine biographical entries.
The entry after Kwon's name:
"President, Men Whose Eyes
Tend To Wander Down To
Breasts While Talking To
Women, Anonymous." The state
ment "bothered" him, Kwon said.
"I didn't write the comment,
and I had no knowledge that it
was going to be written," Kwon
said. "When they start being
degrading or offensive like that, I
can't tolerate that."
Kwon added, however, that he
"still supports" the Prefer slate's
platform.
According to senior Ted Lai,
another member of the Prefer slate,
slate member Ed Mun prepared the
statement that appeared in the elec
tion handbook just before the dead
line for submissions, and he did not
have time to show the statement to
the other slate members.
"We all didn't realize it would
create such a big deal," Lai said.
Mun could not be reached for
comment.
Lai said the slate will replace
Kwon with sophomore Jay Jack
son, who is on the wrestling team
and was dorm president of Serra
last year.
Kwon said he wanted to resign
from the slate after the election
handbook was distributed, but
stayed on the slate until a replace
ment was found.
Hearings Officer Jason Moore
said the Prefer slate would be
allowed to make the substitution
if they filed a declaration detailing
the change with him by Monday.
In other developments, David
Hyatt, a member of the Hammer
and Coffin party's YOU! slate, was
ruled ineligible to run for COP

because he is not enrolled as a stu
dent this quarter.
Moore said Hyatt was ineligi
ble because he had already com
pleted his undergraduate degree
and was not enrolled as a student
this quarter, adding that the
YOU! slate would be allowed to
replace Hyatt.
Slate member Chris McKenna
said he did not know who would
replace Hyatt, but said the slate was
"planning to switch members pretty
soon" anyway. The slate is running
on a "randomocracy" platform, and,
if elected, pledges to choose new
members for the COP each day
through random drawings.
Hyatt could not be reached for
comment.
Moore also said he was looking
into a campaign violation commit
ted by the Independents slate —
the posting of campaign fliers in the
Quad, which violates ASSU bylaws.
The bylaws state that "no cam
paign material may be affixed in
any manner to any building, wall
or pillar that is part of the Inner or
Outer Quad."
Ron Brown, a member of the
Independents slate, said that one

of the slate's campaign volunteers
had mistakenly placed eight fliers
promoting the slate in the Quad.
Slate member Sherri Wolson
said the slate removed the fliers
as soon as they realized they had
been posted, and apologized to
Moore for the violation.
Wolson said Moore and the

slate had agreed that the slate
would write a letter to The Daily
apologizing for posting the fliers.
She said the letter was sent, and
no further action will be taken.
Moore refused to comment on the
punishment, but said he was investi
gating the violation and hoped to
issue an official ruling today.
