Several months after the Palm Beach rape

has emerged an advocate for victims' rights,
working to prevent the trauma of rape.
Bowman, who will speak tonight at 7:30 p.m.

alleged rape and her ordeal with the media.

my pursuit of justice, and no other victim
should have to encounter the things I had to
and other victims had to," she said. "We need
some changes, and in order to get those
changes, you have to stand up and have your
voice heard and enact those changes."
Bowman's speech tonight — sponsored by
the Rape Education Project as part of Rape
Awareness Week — is just one way of making
her voice heard. Since the December trial in

colleges and conferences across the country on
victims' rights and is also coordinating a con

She has also been working with state and
U.S. legislators and victims' advocacy groups
to protect victims' rights and increase funding
for sexual assault treatment centers.
Specifically, Bowman is trying to make it
easier for victims to report their rapes. She has
a personal interest in this, as the number of
