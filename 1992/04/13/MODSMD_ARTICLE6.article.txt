# 'I went down a road filled with injustice in my pursuit of justice.'
## Bowman becomes advocate for victims' rights 
### Holly Hacker Senior staff writer 
Several months after the Palm Beach rape
trial that fixated the nation, Patricia Bowman
has emerged an advocate for victims' rights,
working to prevent the trauma of rape.
Bowman, who will speak tonight at 7:30 p.m.
in Kresge Auditorium on "Surviving the Media:
A Victim's Perspective," took an hour yesterday
to speak to The Daily about how she has taken
"a very rough road" to recovery from both her
alleged rape and her ordeal with the media.
"I went down a road filled with injustice in
my pursuit of justice, and no other victim
should have to encounter the things I had to
and other victims had to," she said. "We need
some changes, and in order to get those
changes, you have to stand up and have your
voice heard and enact those changes."
Bowman's speech tonight — sponsored by
the Rape Education Project as part of Rape
Awareness Week — is just one way of making
her voice heard. Since the December trial in
which her alleged assailant was acquitted,
Bowman has been working in her community
and beyond for victims' rights.
For example, she is currently speaking at
colleges and conferences across the country on
victims' rights and is also coordinating a con
ference in her home community on rape trau
ma syndrome.
She has also been working with state and
U.S. legislators and victims' advocacy groups
to protect victims' rights and increase funding
for sexual assault treatment centers.
Specifically, Bowman is trying to make it
easier for victims to report their rapes. She has
a personal interest in this, as the number of

victims reporting rapes in her
community "went unbelievably
down" following the publication
of her name in the media, she
said.
"Victims around this country
are terrified of reporting because of
NBC's and The New York Times'
decision," Bowman said, referring
to two of the organizations that
released her name without her per
mission last April, following the
lead of a supermarket tabloid.
But it wasn't until other victims
spoke out to Bowman that she real
ized the extent of the problem.
"Thousands of victims reached
out to me to support me," Bow
man said, "and just that knowl
edge helps with the isolation that
a victim feels."
Bowman said she was sad
dened to see that the majority of
victims who wrote to her "are
elderly women in their 60s or 70s
or 80s who were raped in their
teens, who have never told any
one and have carried that with
them through all these years. And
that's not right."
It was this feeling of injustice
that sparked Bowman's need to
support other victims in return.
As she worked toward her own
recovery, Bowman said, she dis
covered that "the amount of
women who have been raped in
the United States and who carry
that pain with them is so stagger
ing, you are compelled, you are
forced, to go out there and work,
because these numbers are too
high."
Her personal experience with
the criminal justice system last
December was another major
motivating factor, Bowman said.
At that point, she said, she really
started "expressing an interest in

getting some changes effected."
One way of doing so was in
assisting various U.S. and state
legislators by giving what she
called a "victim impact statemen."
For example, she applauded a
Florida law requiring all sexual
offenders to be tested for HIV. "I
would like to see all 50 states have
that," Bowman said.
Bowman also favors legislation
guaranteeing victims of sexual
assault the same right to a speedy
trial as their assailants, as well as
greater protection of victims'
names from the media.
Bowman said her work has
offered her another form of sup
port. "Getting involved in victims'
rights work and victims' rights
legislative changes or support pro
grams was extremely helpful," she
said, "because I didn't feel so iso
lated, I didn't feel so alone and I
didn't feel so helpless."
She added, "I have the power to
take something negative and hope
fully turn it into something posi
tive. And I also have the duty to
work for victims, because many
others have worked for me and the
rest of the victims in the United
States."
Had the media not released her
name, she would not have
revealed her identity. However,
she said she would still have got
ten involved with victims' rights,
though perhaps not as publicly,
Bowman said.
And, she emphasized, "I would
still have reported that crime.
Even today, knowing everything I
went through, I would still be at
that police station reporting."
As for the future, Bowman said
she looks forward to her daughter
going to kindergarten, staying
involved with victim advocacy and
working toward her ultimate
goal, which "would probably be to
let victims know that they should
tell someone, that there is com
fort and that they can survive."

colleges and conferences across the country on
victims' rights and is also coordinating a con

She has also been working with state and
U.S. legislators and victims' advocacy groups
to protect victims' rights and increase funding
for sexual assault treatment centers.

victims reporting rapes in her
community "went unbelievably
down" following the publication
of her name in the media, she
said.
"Victims around this country
are terrified of reporting because of
NBC's and The New York Times'
decision," Bowman said, referring
to two of the organizations that
released her name without her per
mission last April, following the
lead of a supermarket tabloid.
But it wasn't until other victims
spoke out to Bowman that she real
ized the extent of the problem.
"Thousands of victims reached
out to me to support me," Bow
man said, "and just that knowl
edge helps with the isolation that
a victim feels."
Bowman said she was sad
dened to see that the majority of
victims who wrote to her "are
elderly women in their 60s or 70s
or 80s who were raped in their
teens, who have never told any
one and have carried that with
them through all these years. And
that's not right."
It was this feeling of injustice
that sparked Bowman's need to
support other victims in return.
As she worked toward her own
recovery, Bowman said, she dis
covered that "the amount of
women who have been raped in
the United States and who carry
that pain with them is so stagger
ing, you are compelled, you are
forced, to go out there and work,
because these numbers are too
high."
Her personal experience with
the criminal justice system last
December was another major
motivating factor, Bowman said.
At that point, she said, she really
started "expressing an interest in

getting some changes effected."
One way of doing so was in
assisting various U.S. and state
legislators by giving what she
called a "victim impact statemen."
For example, she applauded a
Florida law requiring all sexual
offenders to be tested for HIV. "I
would like to see all 50 states have
that," Bowman said.
Bowman also favors legislation
guaranteeing victims of sexual
assault the same right to a speedy
trial as their assailants, as well as
greater protection of victims'
names from the media.
Bowman said her work has
offered her another form of sup
port. "Getting involved in victims'
rights work and victims' rights
legislative changes or support pro
grams was extremely helpful," she
said, "because I didn't feel so iso
lated, I didn't feel so alone and I
didn't feel so helpless."
She added, "I have the power to
take something negative and hope
fully turn it into something posi
tive. And I also have the duty to
work for victims, because many
others have worked for me and the
rest of the victims in the United
States."
Had the media not released her
name, she would not have
revealed her identity. However,
she said she would still have got
ten involved with victims' rights,
though perhaps not as publicly,
Bowman said.
And, she emphasized, "I would
still have reported that crime.
Even today, knowing everything I
went through, I would still be at
that police station reporting."
As for the future, Bowman said
she looks forward to her daughter
going to kindergarten, staying
involved with victim advocacy and
working toward her ultimate
goal, which "would probably be to
let victims know that they should
tell someone, that there is com
fort and that they can survive."
Several months after the Palm Beach rape
trial that fixated the nation, Patricia Bowman
has emerged an advocate for victims' rights,
working to prevent the trauma of rape.
Bowman, who will speak tonight at 7:30 p.m.
in Kresge Auditorium on "Surviving the Media:
A Victim's Perspective," took an hour yesterday
to speak to The Daily about how she has taken
"a very rough road" to recovery from both her
alleged rape and her ordeal with the media.
"I went down a road filled with injustice in
my pursuit of justice, and no other victim
should have to encounter the things I had to
and other victims had to," she said. "We need
some changes, and in order to get those
changes, you have to stand up and have your
voice heard and enact those changes."
Bowman's speech tonight — sponsored by
the Rape Education Project as part of Rape
Awareness Week — is just one way of making
her voice heard. Since the December trial in
which her alleged assailant was acquitted,
Bowman has been working in her community
and beyond for victims' rights.
For example, she is currently speaking at
colleges and conferences across the country on
victims' rights and is also coordinating a con
ference in her home community on rape trau
ma syndrome.
She has also been working with state and
U.S. legislators and victims' advocacy groups
