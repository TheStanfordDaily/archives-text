# Students rally around Gillam
## Rosse to decide fate of lecturer's job this week 
### Elise Wolfgram 
Popular American Studies lecturer Richard
Gillam is scheduled to lose his job at the end of
June, but students, faculty and alumni are rally
ing to save it.
Gillam's position as senior lecturer and coordi
nator of the American Studies program is slated
to be eliminated as the University cuts $600,000
from the budget of interdisciplinary programs.
But American Studies students — who started
a letter-writing campaign to save Gillam's job
when Ewart Thomas, dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, rejected a grievance
appeal filed by Gillam at the end of February —
say Gillam is a skilled teacher and an indispens
able part of the program.
Senior Linda Chu, an American Studies major,
organized the campaign to send letters to Provost
James Rosse, who is currently deciding a second

appeal from Gillam.
Chu presented Rosse with about 45 letters in a
meeting at the end of winter quarter — and she
said Rosse had received many other letters sup
porting Gillam as well.
Rosse said he will make a decision on Gillam's
fate before Wednesday, when Rosse leaves office
for a job with Freedom Newspapers, Inc., based in
Irvine, Calif.
Rosse said the matter "is still in conversation,"
and would not make any further comment until
he announces his decision.
The campaign has involved American Studies
majors, teaching assistants, students, alumni and
faculty, who wrote individual letters of support
for Gillam.
"A lot of what my fellow classmates found in
Gillam is what all undergraduates unknowingly
