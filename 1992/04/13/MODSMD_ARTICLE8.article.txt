# Students rally around Gillam
## Rosse to decide fate of lecturer's job this week 
### Elise Wolfgram 
Popular American Studies lecturer Richard
Gillam is scheduled to lose his job at the end of
June, but students, faculty and alumni are rally
ing to save it.
Gillam's position as senior lecturer and coordi
nator of the American Studies program is slated
to be eliminated as the University cuts $600,000
from the budget of interdisciplinary programs.
But American Studies students — who started
a letter-writing campaign to save Gillam's job
when Ewart Thomas, dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, rejected a grievance
appeal filed by Gillam at the end of February —
say Gillam is a skilled teacher and an indispens
able part of the program.
Senior Linda Chu, an American Studies major,
organized the campaign to send letters to Provost
James Rosse, who is currently deciding a second

appeal from Gillam.
Chu presented Rosse with about 45 letters in a
meeting at the end of winter quarter — and she
said Rosse had received many other letters sup
porting Gillam as well.
Rosse said he will make a decision on Gillam's
fate before Wednesday, when Rosse leaves office
for a job with Freedom Newspapers, Inc., based in
Irvine, Calif.
Rosse said the matter "is still in conversation,"
and would not make any further comment until
he announces his decision.
The campaign has involved American Studies
majors, teaching assistants, students, alumni and
faculty, who wrote individual letters of support
for Gillam.
"A lot of what my fellow classmates found in
Gillam is what all undergraduates unknowingly

Richard Gillam, a senior lecturer and coordinator of the American Studies program, may lose his
job to budget cuts in June. Students, alumni and others have written letters supporting Gillam and
are hoping Provost James Rosse will spare Gillam's job.
search for — a mentor," said John
Cuerva, a 1989 graduate and for
mer student of Gillam's.
Tom Kim, a junior majoring in
American Studies, said Gillam "is
one of the most accessible . . . peo
ple at the University."
Cuerva, who now works at the
mayor's office in San Francisco,
said he and many other alumni are
greatly concerned about the possi
bility that Gillam won't be rehired
— and that may affect their will
ingness to give money to Stanford.
"American Studies represents a
crucial part of our undergraduate
experience," Cuerva said. "To
destroy a program that represents
the Stanford experience will
diminish our desire to donate to
the University."
Gillam said he felt "gratified and
pretty humble" by the campaign.
"I've been very touched by student
interest and concern," he said.
However, he would not com

ment on how effective the cam
paign might be, because he does
not want to risk the outcome of his
grievance. "I know it's been heard,
but I won't predict," he said.
Chu said she is worried that the
loss of Gillam will weaken the pro
gram and discourage undeclared
undergraduates from joining the
American Studies program.
"It would be very hard for the
American Studies program to
exist (without Gillam) as it is
now," Chu said.
As part of the budget-cutting
process, faculty are being called
on to teach more in interdisci
plinary programs such as Ameri
can Studies. Having faculty teach
more would eliminate the need
for lecturers like Gillam and save
money, the School of Humanities
and Sciences hopes.
A memo distributed in January
to the school's faculty said that in
order to have a strong interdisci
plinary program, faculty — not lec
turers — should be at the center of
the program.
But Cuerva rejected that argu
ment, saying the success of his

classmates demonstrates "the
quality of the students that the
program is producing."
He added that the need to keep
Gillam is not only his excellent
teaching abilities but also the role
he plays in the department.
Assoc. English Prof. Jay Fliegel
man said that because lecturers are
not hired through national compe
titions, as departmental faculty are,
they don't have as much pressure
to publish as professors and have
more time to spend with students.
Fliegelman said that because
of this, Gillam is able to concen
trate more on the program, mak
ing him its "symbolic center."
Gillam does a large amount of
advising for American Studies
majors and is often the only per
son in Building 70, the American
Studies office, Fliegelman said.
If Rosse rejects Gillam's appeal,
Gillam said his final option would
be an appeal to the president.
In that case, Cuerva said there
would be a much larger response
from alumni, since they found out
on "extremely short notice" about
Thomas' rejection of the grievance.
