Rafsanjani beats radicals in Iran
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — The government predicted yesterday
that backers of President Hashemi Rafsanjani would win a land
slide victory in parliamentary elections, bolstering his drive to lib
eralize the economy and mend ties with the West.
The early results from Friday's voting appeared to be a sharp
setback for more-radical followers of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, who have dominated the 270-seat parliament, or Majlis.
Iran's official news media said 55 of the 123 candidates who
won enough votes to capture a seat outright were members of the
Society of Combatant Clergymen, whose leader is Rafsanjani.
The other 68 decided races were in remote areas and the affil
iation of the winners was not immediately clear.
Saddam making 'ominous preparations'
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush's national security
adviser said yesterday that Iraq is "making very ominous prepa
rations" for action against its Kurdish rebels and that he would
not rule out military force to stop it.
Brent Scowcroft said Saddam Hussein had installed some sur
face-to-air missiles in a prohibited zone and that the United States
has been consulting its allies about its response.
"He's not pounding the dickens out of the Kurds yet, but he's
making very ominous preparations up there," Scowcroft said
about Saddam on NBC's "Meet the Press."
"They will not get away with anything," he said when asked how
the United States would respond if the missiles were used against
American reconnaissance flights.
