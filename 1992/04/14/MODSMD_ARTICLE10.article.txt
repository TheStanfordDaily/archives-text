# ENDORSEMENTS
## For 'Independents' 
### 
CELEBRITY AND FLASH
don't equal commitment to
hearing the student voice.
"Independents: A New Era" may
not have 50-yard-line football seats,
but their dedication to student
issues — and not just events —
make them the clear choice for next
year's Council of Presidents.
Ron Brown, Delia Lopez, Jason
Snyder and Sherri Wolson have
based their campaign around
increasing communication with the
students — not just by delivering
speeches and writing newsletters,
as Students First has proposed, but
by soliciting input door to door and
forming a COP advisory board.
The difference is obvious: One
set of candidates will listen, the
other will talk. For the governing
body whose most important task is
communicating student desires to
the administration, this is an
important distinction.
Another of the slate's strengths
lies in its lack of ties to a party and
the accompanying agenda.
A slate that has been hand
picked by a party with members
both in this year's COP and in the
ASSU senate has inevitable obliga
tions to that party. An independent
COP would be welcome in a stu
dent government often accused of
being a private club.
The COP must actively pursue
issues, not just services. Candidates
may pledge that they will provide a
wide array of perks, but they don't
control the ASSU's pocketbook.
The COP has little power to carry
out costly plans unless they can
convince a notoriously tight-fisted
senate to loosen up funding.
A sincere intention to fight for
student issues will prove far more
valuable than empty promises.
The Independents are committed
to preventing another tuition hike
and opening a financial aid
resource office to assist students in

dealing with the University.
Students First, on the other
hand, mentions neither of these
issues in their platform. At a uni
versity where costs are skyrocket
ing and more than 60 percent of
students receive financial aid, it's
hard to settle for a treasure hunt
and a sports clinic in the place of
vision and activism.
Members of the Independents also
have the experience and skill needed
to get things done. Perhaps more
importantly, they have the proven
dedication to hard, behind-the
scenes work and the time to do it.
On the lighter side of the cam
paign, Hammer and Coffin's "YOU!"
adds welcome levity to the race with
its "randomocracy" concept.
While choosing random stu
dents to serve as COP members for
a day would hardly increase the
ASSU's credibility, it does address
some real concerns about the lack
of student involvement or interest
in student government.
The campaign's least impressive
proposal — that of "I Prefer Not to
Have a COP" — fails to fix the sys
tem's faults or even address them
with a sense of humor.
Eliminating the COP may be
appealing to those disillusioned
with student government, but it's
really just a cop-out.
Popularity and calculated cam
paigning may win high school elec
tions, but they just aren't enough
at a university. While the Indepen
dents may not possess the charisma
and name recognition of the slicker
Students First, they will prove
more effective and accountable.
