## Of coercion and consent 
### 
WHEN WILLIAM KENNEDY
Smith went on trial for rape, my
parents didn't believe Patricia
Bowman's testimony. They thought she
was lying for her own benefit.
It pained me to see that my mother
didn't have any sympathy for the woman.
I suppose we've seen too many people lie
and cheat for money or one thing or
another. But why didn't she wonder if
the man was lying?
I thought, Mom, what if it was me?
Would you think I was lying too? What
would you say if I said I know how she
feels?
I wasn't raped. But I don't know how
to categorize what did happen to me. It
was still painful.
I was pretty naive. He was my friend and
I liked hun. And he liked me too, I guess.
I remember being touched and not
wanting to be touched that way. I liked
him. But I did not want to feel the weight
of his body on mine. Or his breath
against my ear. I remember lying still
because I thought that would be enough
to tell him that something was wrong.
That I wanted him to stop.
When he finally did stop and had fall
en asleep, I crept out and went back to
my room. I was confused, and I didn't
understand what happened.
My experience is not a "normal" case of
sexual assault. I don't think I would call it
sexual assault. I don't know what to call

it. Maybe you wouldn't call it anything.
But I know I felt dirty and violated. I
was ashamed, and I thought it was my
fault.
I didn't tell anyone at first. Many of
my friends knew him, and I was afraid of
appearing spiteful. Because he had men
tioned the matter to a few people, I didn't
know who else knew. I began to think his
friends were looking at me with disgust.
When I finally told a few people who
happened to know him, they didn't really
believe me. They couldn't seem to under
stand why I was so hurt or why it would
continue to bother me. I felt alone.
When people began talking about the
Stuart Thomas case, it angered and upset
me to hear others blame and criticize the
woman in Zapata. Nothing ever makes it
acceptable to commit a sexual act without
consent.
Sometimes people say, "Well how am I
supposed to tell if I am doing something
wrong?" For me, the best solution has been
to ask, "Is this okay? Is this all right?"
It has taken me a long time to come to
the point where I am comfortable with
the past. After all these years and a rela
tionship with a man I still respect great
ly, I had thought that it didn't bother me
anymore.
The incident in Zapata caused a lot of
emotions to re-emerge. It was upsetting
to realize that I still had a problem. I
finally decided that I needed to talk to my

old friend about what had happened.
Otherwise, I was afraid it would always
bother me.
It was scary to open myself up to some
one who could so easily hurt me again. A
friend suggested that I see a counselor.
After my initial reluctance, I went. It
helped a great deal to have someone tell
me that I was doing the right thing.
Unlike many, I am fortunate because
the person who has lived in my head for
so long acknowledges what he did to me,
to us. It has also been painful for him
these years. And now it is a great relief to
be as free of it as I can be. Sexual coercion
can be subtle or unconscious, and its
impact long-lasting.
When a friend of mine asked me to
watch a rehearsal of ACTING OUT, a
performance piece by Women Against
Rape for Stanford's Rape Awareness
Week, I was reminded of the things I've
related here. I encourage you to witness
how these ten women have explored these
issues and themselves.

Jane thanks everyone for their responses
to last week's column. ACTING OUT will
show for free at the Nitery April 15-17,
noon-1 p.m. and April 17 at 8 p.m.
