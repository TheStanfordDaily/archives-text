Publicity received for
political move is unfair
I am deeply offended at the publicity
the Students First Council of Presi
dents' slate is receiving in conjunction
with the Athletic Department's decision
to return student seating at football
games to the 50-yard line.
Am I really supposed to believe that a
decision made last quarter just happened
to be announced a week before the
ASSU elections? Personally, I give the
Stanford community a lot more credit.
For the sake of argument, let's
assume we're all dumb enough to believe
the timing is a mere coincidence. Then I
am still left wondering why a meeting
was held last week if the decision was
made last quarter.
What did slate members John Hall,
Preeti Malladi and Joel Stein have to do
with it? And why was it on the football
field?
According to Athletic Director Tom
Beckett, he attended the meeting to hear
more student input. I can imagine what
critical input these students gave:
Preeti: "I think students will like this."
Joel: "We are definitely standing on
the 50-yard line."
John: "And those certainly are better
seats."
I feel it is only painfully clear that
Students First sought the photographic

quality of a meeting which had absolute
ly no purpose, and to which they had no
connection as a group.
Hall claims that the slate is "trying to
prove that we are going to be an effective
COP."
What did he have to do with the
change? Glyn Milburn initiated discus
sions last quarter. Not only wasn't Mil
burn running with John at that time,
but he was planning to run with a candi
date who is now on another slate!
Furthermore, Stanford football coach
Bill Walsh claims that the decision "prob
ably would have happened anyway."
According to Walsh, concerns from
football players catalyzed the change.
Maybe the football team should run for
COP.
ASSU senator Ed Mun points out
that Milburn's initiative proves that stu
dents don't need to be elected to the
COP to cause important changes, and
rightly so.
What Students First has proved is
that if you have good connections with
the press and the Athletic Department,
then you can get administrators to pose
with you and get front-page coverage.
Hall and his celebrity, all-star slate
has lost my trust as potential student
representatives. I am insulted, I am
tired of the politics and I am taking my
vote elsewhere.

Football seats decision
was not political at all
Student seating on the 50-yard-line
was not a political move.
Unlike the April 10 Daily article sug
gested, the decision to move student
seating was not totally because of Mil
burn's influence.
Since last fall, students have offered
suggestions to the athletic department
about how to increase student atten
dance at games.
In November, a "student panel"
was asked to discuss "Stanford Athlet
ics" with a volunteer marketing com
mittee of alumni and non-alumni.
Assoc. Athletic Director Tom Beckett
was the chairman of this marketing
committee.
As a student who contributed to the
meeting, I remember discussing student
seating.
The panel felt that hostility was cre
ated between students and the athletic
department when the student section
was taken off the fifty. It seemed that
interests lay with alumni appease
ment.
One student on the panel said, "If you
want to impress upon the students that
they are important to the athletic
department, you have to treat them as if
they are important."
I trust that the decision to move the

seating was on the students' behalf, not
at Milburn's behest.
I'm sure that more student panels
have met with the Athletic Department
and Glyn Milburn may have served on
any number of them.
But it is unfair to attribute the move
to Milburn or to associate it in any way
with the Students First Council of Presi
dents slate.

Viewing the media as
monolithic is harmful
According to The Daily's account of
the "Nightlme" filming, several of the
participants accused the media of "run
ning amok."
Attacking the media is becoming
increasingly popular, but it's also danger
ous.
With all their flaws, the media are the
best protection we have against the
abuse of power by public officials and the
consequent erosion of democracy.
It's true that television news is general
ly inadequate when it isn't misleading, but
there are other news media.
It was the press, after all, that helped
reveal the secrets of Watergate and
exposed the White House cover-up. News
papers were reporting the illegal activities
of Oliver North and other Reagan admin

istration officials in Nicaragua long before
the Iran-Contra scandal broke.
Reporters for the mqjor newspapers
doggedly described the serious chicanery
of Housing and Urban Development and
Pentagon officials during the Reagan
years, and more recently, the Bush fami
ly's involvement in questionable financial
deals.
Unfortunately, most of these revela
tions scarcely made a ripple and are now
largely forgotten.
The fact is that "the media" is any
thing but monolithic. Those who want to
know what's going on have a choice. The
National Enquirer is altogether different
from The New York Times.
A 60-second television sound bite is
not the same as an in-depth report in
the Washington Post or a 10-minute
news segment on National Public
Radio.
Sometimes important information is
buried under a mountain of print, but it is
there for those who bother to look for it.
Meanwhile, we should be aware that
indiscriminate attacks on news sources
can backfire.
Nothing could better please the dema
gogues both in and out of government
than to see the media as a whole discred
ited.
If that should ever happen, the rest of
us would have no defense against lies
from the politically powerful.
