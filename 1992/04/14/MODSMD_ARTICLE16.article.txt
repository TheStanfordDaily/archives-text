## California plays its best, upsets Card netters 5-4 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Stanford women's tennis coach
Frank Brennan gave his players some
advice before they started doubles
matches against California yesterday.
"Focus hard. Focus on your match," he
said. "It's like being down 0-40 and win
ning the game. Everyone here has pulled
out a game at 0-40."
If Brennan sounded like the No. 2
Cardinal had its back against the wall,
the team did. With four losses in singles,
the squad needed to sweep doubles to
beat No. 8 Cal.
Meanwhile the message Bears' coach
Jan Brogan had for her players was differ
ent. "I told them not to celebrate until they
won," she said. "Our football team did that
last year and look what happened."
The three doubles matches started
badly for Stanford. The Bears' Lisa
Albano and Kiersten Alley took the first
set from Heather Willens and Laxmi
Poruri, 6-2. By the same score, Jenny
Poulos and Cara Abe grabbed a lead over
Amy Chiminello and Mario Carruth.
On court two, Kylie Johnson and Kris
tine Kurth eked out an advantage against
Valerie Poulos and Lisa Parks late in the
first set. They hung on for a 6-4 lead.
The tide was also turning on court
one. Willens and Poruri got the best of
Cal on several lightening-quick net
exchanges. The Cardinal duo outplayed
the Bears to pull even at a set apiece.
By now, the No. 3 match had reached
a crucial juncture. Carruth was serving
at 1-2 in the second set. The Bears won
three straight points to reach game point
for a service break and a two-game lead.
But Carruth and Chiminello battled
back. After some timely sharp ground
strokes and a Carruth service winner,

the score was even 40-40. If Stanford
could capture the game after being down
0-40, it could swing the momentum to
the Cardinal's side.
But Poulos and Abe dug in for the
next two points and the pivotal break.
The Card pair managed to break in the
next game but, despite several pinpoint
crosscourt returns from Chiminello, the
tandem fell 6-2, 6-2.
"They played well at the right times.
We would have game point in every game
and just not come through," Carruth said.
The victory was the first time since
1987 that Cal has beaten Stanford. "I'm
so happy for everyone on the team," Bro
gan said. "I'm very proud of the jobs Lisa
Albano and Lisa Parks did today. Lisa
(Albano) is a senior and got to beat Stan
ford once since she's been here."
Albano won a crucial 6-4, 4-6, 6-4
three-setter against Willens in the top sin
gles slot. Albano, ranked 13th in the
nation, was able to move No. 3 Willens
around by slugged groundstrokes cross
court and down the line. When the duo
clashed at Stanford two months ago,
Albano rarely found the court and was
blown away in straight sets. This time the
senior gutted out the match with consis
tent shots that pressured Willens into
errors.
"I'm mentally more ready to play,"
said Albano, comparing the matches. "At
Stanford, I wasn't in the match. I wasn't
concentrating. In this match I was
focused so it came down to who played
the bigger points better."
Albano won that category as Willens
had problems with her serve and back
hand, her bread-and-butter shot. "I
missed a lot more backhands then I usu
ally do," Willens said. She also estimated
she had about 15 double faults.
The Cardinal junior admitted she

didn't expect Albano to give her that
good a match given how Albano played in
their previous match. "I wasn't ready for
her to play as tough as she did in the first
set," Willens said.
Willens outgunned the Cal senior in
the second set. Up 4-2 in the third, Wil
lens ran out of gas and dropped the last
four games to the 1991 NCAA runner-up.
Another pivotal match was the No. 4
contest between Kurth and Alley. Both
players like to crush the ball and both
tried to throw the other off by mixing in
some slice. The drop shot keyed Alley's
first-set tiebreak victory as Kurth was
hampered by a sore back. The injury lim
ited Kurth's ability to hit overheads,
which Alley forced her to do by lobbing
Kurth after drawing her into the net.
Kurth stormed back to capture the
second set 6-1. However, Alley started
hitting on her passing shots and won the
third 6-2.
Chiminello and Carruth both lost
straight-set matches at No. 5 and No. 6.
The two victories the Cardinal man
aged in singles were won by Poruri and
Kylie Johnson. Poruri had too many
weapons for Jenny Poulos and won 6-3,
6-1. The Stanford sophomore has been
on a tear lately, having not lost a dual
match singles contest since January.
Johnson methodically decimated Abe
6-3, 6-3. Johnson also won her doubles
match, teaming with Kurth for a 6-4, 6-4
victory over Valerie Poulos and Parks.
Willens and Poruri also captured their
doubles tilt 2-6, 6-1, 6-4.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, it
was not enough as the ecstatic Bears
dealt Stanford its second loss of the sea
son. Despite the historical significance
of the loss, assistant coach Lele Forood
put the defeat in perspective. "They
beat us in 1987 but we won NCAAs."

for a service break and a two-game lead.
But Carruth and Chiminello battled
back. After some timely sharp ground
strokes and a Carruth service winner,

the score was even 40-40. If Stanford
could capture the game after being down
0-40, it could swing the momentum to
the Cardinal's side.
But Poulos and Abe dug in for the
next two points and the pivotal break.
The Card pair managed to break in the
next game but, despite several pinpoint
crosscourt returns from Chiminello, the
tandem fell 6-2, 6-2.
"They played well at the right times.
We would have game point in every game
and just not come through," Carruth said.
The victory was the first time since
1987 that Cal has beaten Stanford. "I'm
so happy for everyone on the team," Bro
gan said. "I'm very proud of the jobs Lisa
Albano and Lisa Parks did today. Lisa
(Albano) is a senior and got to beat Stan
ford once since she's been here."
Albano won a crucial 6-4, 4-6, 6-4
three-setter against Willens in the top sin
gles slot. Albano, ranked 13th in the
nation, was able to move No. 3 Willens
around by slugged groundstrokes cross
court and down the line. When the duo
clashed at Stanford two months ago,
Albano rarely found the court and was
blown away in straight sets. This time the
senior gutted out the match with consis
tent shots that pressured Willens into
errors.
"I'm mentally more ready to play,"
said Albano, comparing the matches. "At
Stanford, I wasn't in the match. I wasn't
concentrating. In this match I was
focused so it came down to who played
the bigger points better."
Albano won that category as Willens
had problems with her serve and back
hand, her bread-and-butter shot. "I
missed a lot more backhands then I usu
ally do," Willens said. She also estimated
she had about 15 double faults.
The Cardinal junior admitted she

didn't expect Albano to give her that
good a match given how Albano played in
their previous match. "I wasn't ready for
her to play as tough as she did in the first
set," Willens said.
Willens outgunned the Cal senior in
the second set. Up 4-2 in the third, Wil
lens ran out of gas and dropped the last
four games to the 1991 NCAA runner-up.
Another pivotal match was the No. 4
contest between Kurth and Alley. Both
players like to crush the ball and both
tried to throw the other off by mixing in
some slice. The drop shot keyed Alley's
first-set tiebreak victory as Kurth was
hampered by a sore back. The injury lim
ited Kurth's ability to hit overheads,
which Alley forced her to do by lobbing
Kurth after drawing her into the net.
Kurth stormed back to capture the
second set 6-1. However, Alley started
hitting on her passing shots and won the
third 6-2.
Chiminello and Carruth both lost
straight-set matches at No. 5 and No. 6.
The two victories the Cardinal man
aged in singles were won by Poruri and
Kylie Johnson. Poruri had too many
weapons for Jenny Poulos and won 6-3,
6-1. The Stanford sophomore has been
on a tear lately, having not lost a dual
match singles contest since January.
Johnson methodically decimated Abe
6-3, 6-3. Johnson also won her doubles
match, teaming with Kurth for a 6-4, 6-4
victory over Valerie Poulos and Parks.
Willens and Poruri also captured their
doubles tilt 2-6, 6-1, 6-4.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, it
was not enough as the ecstatic Bears
dealt Stanford its second loss of the sea
son. Despite the historical significance
of the loss, assistant coach Lele Forood
put the defeat in perspective. "They
beat us in 1987 but we won NCAAs."

Heather Widens gets ready to smash a blistering return. Wiiiens was upset in singles
yesterday by California's Lisa Albano, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, as the Golden Bears defeated the
Cardinal 5-4.
Stanford women's tennis coach
Frank Brennan gave his players some
advice before they started doubles
matches against California yesterday.
"Focus hard. Focus on your match," he
said. "It's like being down 0-40 and win
ning the game. Everyone here has pulled
out a game at 0-40."
If Brennan sounded like the No. 2
Cardinal had its back against the wall,
the team did. With four losses in singles,
the squad needed to sweep doubles to
beat No. 8 Cal.
Meanwhile the message Bears' coach
Jan Brogan had for her players was differ
ent. "I told them not to celebrate until they
won," she said. "Our football team did that
last year and look what happened."
The three doubles matches started
badly for Stanford. The Bears' Lisa
Albano and Kiersten Alley took the first
set from Heather Willens and Laxmi
Poruri, 6-2. By the same score, Jenny
Poulos and Cara Abe grabbed a lead over
Amy Chiminello and Mario Carruth.
On court two, Kylie Johnson and Kris
tine Kurth eked out an advantage against
Valerie Poulos and Lisa Parks late in the
first set. They hung on for a 6-4 lead.
The tide was also turning on court
one. Willens and Poruri got the best of
Cal on several lightening-quick net
exchanges. The Cardinal duo outplayed
the Bears to pull even at a set apiece.
By now, the No. 3 match had reached
a crucial juncture. Carruth was serving
at 1-2 in the second set. The Bears won
three straight points to reach game point
for a service break and a two-game lead.
But Carruth and Chiminello battled
back. After some timely sharp ground
strokes and a Carruth service winner,
