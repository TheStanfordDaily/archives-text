# The
						season so far: baseball stat report

And finally, by popular demand, here
they are. Compiled by the crack Daily base
ball statistics staff (that's me), are the
"Stanford Baseball Team Statistics" for the
Cardinal's 38 games.
Some observations: Stanford now has five
legitimate .300 hitters, which is pretty much
all any team could ask for. The problem is in
the lack of hitting depth, as seen in the sharp

drop-off after Solly. Another problem is the
lack of timely hitting, as seen in the relative
ly small and bunched number of RBI. How
ever, when the team gets on a roll, Six-Pac
pitchers have had difficulty stopping them.
Pitching wise, Stanford is looking great.
The starting pitching has been called the best
in the nation with four (usually) outstanding
starters. The relief pitching is the weakness
as it hasn't been stellar of late. But overall,
besides the obvious problem of not being able
_ to get the out, the staff is excellent.
