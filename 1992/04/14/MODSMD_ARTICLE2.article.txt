## Fighting a war — after class Prof. protects Hungarian TV every two weeks 
### Sara Skinner Staff writer 
With his small frame, black
rimmed glasses and sofi voice,
Elemer Hankiss hardly looks
like a freedom fighter. Yet the
sociologist and visiting professor
at the Center for East European
Studies is in the midst of what
he calls a "civil war going on
around television in Hungary."
Hankiss divides his time
between his position as president
of Hungarian public television

and his classes here at Stanford,
alternating between two weeks
of 14-hour days in Budapest and
two weeks of teaching a double
load of classes at Stanford.
Hankiss had originally
planned to come to Stanford last
year, according to former direc
tor of the Center of East Euro
pean Studies Philippe Schmit
ter, who was responsible for
bringing Hankies to Stanford.
However, Schmitter said Han
kiss was "begged" by the Hun
garian government to become

president of public television. He
took a leave of absence from the
television station in January to
come to Stanford and teach polit
ical science courses last quarter.
Hankiss' absence was seized
by extreamist political groups as
an opportunity to control the
television station, Hankiss said,
and during the last two weeks of
the quarter a "war around the
media in Hungary broke out.**
