## Fighting a war — after class Prof. protects Hungarian TV every two weeks 
### Sara Skinner Staff writer 
With his small frame, black
rimmed glasses and sofi voice,
Elemer Hankiss hardly looks
like a freedom fighter. Yet the
sociologist and visiting professor
at the Center for East European
Studies is in the midst of what
he calls a "civil war going on
around television in Hungary."
Hankiss divides his time
between his position as president
of Hungarian public television

and his classes here at Stanford,
alternating between two weeks
of 14-hour days in Budapest and
two weeks of teaching a double
load of classes at Stanford.
Hankiss had originally
planned to come to Stanford last
year, according to former direc
tor of the Center of East Euro
pean Studies Philippe Schmit
ter, who was responsible for
bringing Hankies to Stanford.
However, Schmitter said Han
kiss was "begged" by the Hun
garian government to become

president of public television. He
took a leave of absence from the
television station in January to
come to Stanford and teach polit
ical science courses last quarter.
Hankiss' absence was seized
by extreamist political groups as
an opportunity to control the
television station, Hankiss said,
and during the last two weeks of
the quarter a "war around the
media in Hungary broke out.**
Led by Gabor Nahlik — a
newly appointed vice president


Brian Bedell — Daily
Visiting Prof. Elemer Hankiss, who splits his time between teaching at Stanford and serving as
president of Hungary's endangered public television, speaks to students outside Serra yesterday.
— a "populist nationalist group"
tried to assume direct control of
television, Hankiss said.
In his first day on the job,
Nahlik appointed two former
Communist party secretaries, one
member of the party politburo,
one member of the Communist
secret police and one person
rumored to be a member of the
Russian secret police. He also took
control of the budget and tried to
organize an internal revolt, which
failed.
Hankiss said the attempted
coup scared all 3,000 people who
worked in Hungarian television.
"That's real, real danger," said
Hankiss, referring to Nahlik's
power to "transform television"
in his absence by firing indepen
dent journalists, replacing them
with Nahlik's own people and
starting programs supporting
extreme political parties.
"That's why I had to rush
home and say, 'I'm here and no
one can do anything,' " Hankiss
said.

When he heard of the events in
Hungary, Hankiss immediately
sent a fax suspending Nahlik as
vice-president. According to Han
kiss, he was overruled by Prime
Minister Josef An tall, who resent
ed the challenge to his authority.
In Hungary, the prime minis
ter can propose a parliamentary
hearing to approve candidates for
president and vice-presidents of
television, who are then appoint
ed by the president of the repub
lic.
Hankiss said the president of
the republic "was betrayed — he
was convinced that [NahlikJ was
neutral. They cheated the whole
parliament, the whole group."
Hankiss called it"the story of
the good king and bad advisers,"
and said he doesn't believe An tall
was "intending to abuse his posi
tion."
However, Hankiss is now
embroiled in a legal battle to
"prove I have the right to sus
pend" Nahlik. "The Prime Minis
ter is not my boss," he said.
According to Hankiss, this
right is vital to protecting the
autonomy of television, which is,
along with radio, one of the last
independent institutions in Hun

gary. "Otherwise we will have a
central authority," he said.
Han kiss' time in Budapest is
spent not only preventing a
return to the old bureaucracy, but
also fighting this legal battle. "I
have to be there at least 10 days
every month," he said. "I have to
keep the press on our side."
Giving interviews is hardly
appealing to a scholar anxious to
return to his studies, he said. "I
hate it but I have to do it."
Television is "one of the most
important issues in Hungarian
democracy," Hankiss said, adding
that it "must be in the headlines
every few days to keep it alive."
He hopes to return to the Uni
versity of Budapest with the pas
sage of a new media law in June.
The law would "protect the media
from influence," he said, by "giv
ing a constitution to television,"
which would allow it to be "like
the BBC and other Western tele
vision."
When that law is passed, Han
kiss said, television will be safe
and"I will quit happily and go
back to my profession."
Described by Schmitter as "an
extraordinary scholar," Hankiss
invented the concept of the "sec

ond society," which identifies a
split in European societies
between official and unofficial
culture.
Hankiss has studied this hid
den society, and the effect of the
split on citizens of these coun
tries. "People got sick," he said.
"Psychologically, physically, spiri
tually. . . Hungary's suicide rate
is the highest in the world."
Hankiss said he is eager to
return to analysis of events,
rather than participation. He said
he is ready "to go back to my desk
and my computer and write and
teach."
His time at Stanford has been a
hectic one. Marjorie Castle, a
teaching assistant for Hankiss'
classes, said he "always has time
for his students, yet his spare
time seems to be filled ... con
tributing to the debate on Hun
garian politics."
When asked about the difficul
ty of traveling so far and so often,
he said he hardly feels the jet lag.
"Commuting between the two
countries shows how small the
world is," he said. "Twelve hours
is not much."
And while he is here, Hankiss
said, "I enjoy every minute of it."
With his small frame, black
rimmed glasses and sofi voice,

in his absence by firing indepen
dent journalists, replacing them
with Nahlik's own people and
starting programs supporting
extreme political parties.
"That's why I had to rush
home and say, 'I'm here and no
one can do anything,' " Hankiss
said.

When he heard of the events in
Hungary, Hankiss immediately
sent a fax suspending Nahlik as
vice-president. According to Han
kiss, he was overruled by Prime
Minister Josef An tall, who resent
ed the challenge to his authority.
In Hungary, the prime minis
ter can propose a parliamentary
hearing to approve candidates for
president and vice-presidents of
television, who are then appoint
ed by the president of the repub
lic.
Hankiss said the president of
the republic "was betrayed — he
was convinced that [NahlikJ was
neutral. They cheated the whole
parliament, the whole group."
Hankiss called it"the story of
the good king and bad advisers,"
and said he doesn't believe An tall
was "intending to abuse his posi
tion."
However, Hankiss is now
embroiled in a legal battle to
"prove I have the right to sus
pend" Nahlik. "The Prime Minis
ter is not my boss," he said.
According to Hankiss, this
right is vital to protecting the
autonomy of television, which is,
along with radio, one of the last
independent institutions in Hun

gary. "Otherwise we will have a
central authority," he said.
Han kiss' time in Budapest is
spent not only preventing a
return to the old bureaucracy, but
also fighting this legal battle. "I
have to be there at least 10 days
every month," he said. "I have to
keep the press on our side."
Giving interviews is hardly
appealing to a scholar anxious to
return to his studies, he said. "I
hate it but I have to do it."
Television is "one of the most
important issues in Hungarian
democracy," Hankiss said, adding
that it "must be in the headlines
every few days to keep it alive."
He hopes to return to the Uni
versity of Budapest with the pas
sage of a new media law in June.
The law would "protect the media
from influence," he said, by "giv
ing a constitution to television,"
which would allow it to be "like
the BBC and other Western tele
vision."
When that law is passed, Han
kiss said, television will be safe
and"I will quit happily and go
back to my profession."
Described by Schmitter as "an
extraordinary scholar," Hankiss
invented the concept of the "sec

ond society," which identifies a
split in European societies
between official and unofficial
culture.
Hankiss has studied this hid
den society, and the effect of the
split on citizens of these coun
tries. "People got sick," he said.
"Psychologically, physically, spiri
tually. . . Hungary's suicide rate
is the highest in the world."
Hankiss said he is eager to
return to analysis of events,
rather than participation. He said
he is ready "to go back to my desk
and my computer and write and
teach."
His time at Stanford has been a
hectic one. Marjorie Castle, a
teaching assistant for Hankiss'
classes, said he "always has time
for his students, yet his spare
time seems to be filled ... con
tributing to the debate on Hun
garian politics."
When asked about the difficul
ty of traveling so far and so often,
he said he hardly feels the jet lag.
"Commuting between the two
countries shows how small the
world is," he said. "Twelve hours
is not much."
And while he is here, Hankiss
said, "I enjoy every minute of it."
With his small frame, black
rimmed glasses and sofi voice,
Elemer Hankiss hardly looks
like a freedom fighter. Yet the
sociologist and visiting professor
at the Center for East European
Studies is in the midst of what
he calls a "civil war going on
around television in Hungary."
Hankiss divides his time
between his position as president
of Hungarian public television

and his classes here at Stanford,
alternating between two weeks
of 14-hour days in Budapest and
two weeks of teaching a double
load of classes at Stanford.
Hankiss had originally
planned to come to Stanford last
year, according to former direc
tor of the Center of East Euro
pean Studies Philippe Schmit
ter, who was responsible for
bringing Hankies to Stanford.
However, Schmitter said Han
kiss was "begged" by the Hun
garian government to become

president of public television. He
took a leave of absence from the
television station in January to
come to Stanford and teach polit
ical science courses last quarter.
Hankiss' absence was seized
by extreamist political groups as
an opportunity to control the
television station, Hankiss said,
and during the last two weeks of
the quarter a "war around the
media in Hungary broke out.**
Led by Gabor Nahlik — a
newly appointed vice president

Visiting Prof. Elemer Hankiss, who splits his time between teaching at Stanford and serving as
president of Hungary's endangered public television, speaks to students outside Serra yesterday.
— a "populist nationalist group"
tried to assume direct control of
television, Hankiss said.
In his first day on the job,
Nahlik appointed two former
Communist party secretaries, one
member of the party politburo,
one member of the Communist
secret police and one person
rumored to be a member of the
Russian secret police. He also took
control of the budget and tried to
organize an internal revolt, which
failed.
Hankiss said the attempted
coup scared all 3,000 people who
worked in Hungarian television.
"That's real, real danger," said
Hankiss, referring to Nahlik's
power to "transform television"
in his absence by firing indepen
dent journalists, replacing them
with Nahlik's own people and
starting programs supporting
extreme political parties.
