# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
This week's installment of Athletes of
the Week has something new and some
thing old. One selection is unusual and
doesn't conform to past choices, while the
other is tried-and-true. Both, however, are
recognized for phenomenal accomplish
ments over last weekend and throughout
their Stanford careers.
Normally, Athletes of the Week recog
nizes an individual for an outstanding per
formance or string of performances, but
this week an entire team was selected as
one honoree. For consistently delivering
night after night, Jeffrey Hammonds and
the Stanford women's gymnastics team
were selected as Athletes of the Week.
The Stanford women's gymnastics team,

currently ranked No. 13 in the nation, sim
ply made history this weekend. The team
went farther than it had ever gone before
by qualifying for the NCAA Championships
in St. Paul, Minn., April 24-25. The Cardi
nal's score of 191.25 points was just enough
for the team to qualify as the No. 12 seed.
The women have been steadily improv
ing all season long, and this accomplish
ment is a testament to their strength and
maturity as a team. This team is young
(four freshmen, four sophomores, and one
junior) and will only continue to improve.
Some might say that their inexperience will
hurt them in St. Paul, but on the other
hand they have nothing to lose.
For their perseverance, dedication, and
hard work all season long, all nine team
members and the coaches are Athletes of
the Week.

Similarly, Jeffrey Hammonds had a flat
out fantastic week. The Stanford baseball
team rallied to win three out of four game
last week and Hammonds was a big part of
it. Statistics speak for themselves: over four
games, he went 7-for-16 for a .438 average,
with six runs scored, six RBI, two home
runs, and two stolen bases. He was also
named the Pac-10 Co-player of the week
this week.
He made his plays at opportune times.
Down 3-0 in the bottom of the fifth inning
Saturday against Arizona State, Ham

monds fueled a comeback. After the Sun
Devils walked the first two batters, Ham
monds stepped up and stroked a shot over
the left-field fence to tie the game up at
three.
Although the Cardinal rally fell short due
to errors, Hammonds' offense showed the
team that it could still produce hits. His
clutch performances all weekend are why he
has been picked as an Athlete of the Week.
