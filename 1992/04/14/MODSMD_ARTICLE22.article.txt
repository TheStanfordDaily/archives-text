What a difference a week
makes. According to
the athletic grapevine,
this column's attempt last week
to illustrate Stanford's champi
onship hopefuls left the baseball
feeling a little (excuse the pun)
put-out. After losing three
straight to Cal, the Cardinal's
bitterness was not helped along
"by lfsudaen v6te "of no-corffi
dence from the school paper.
Yet the boys from Sunken Dia
mond do have a case, and in an
effort to be honest, they were orig
inally included in the list of poten
tial champions. Before being
chopped out, this is what would
have been printed last week:
Baseball
This is the darkhorse of the
group, and after being swept by
Cal last weekend their chances
look even dimmer. Apparently
head coach Mark Marquess
took his men aside after Sun
day's game and told them some
changes would be made before
the end of the week. If he can
get his pitching working to its
potential—and then get at least
decent support from his hit
ting—Stanford could make its
way to Omaha once again.
Marquess is a man of his
word. After reaching
what had to be their
season low against Cal, the Car
dinal nine did indeed put it all
together against Pacific 10 Con
ference/Southern Division lead
er Arizona State. The pitching
that had so mysteriously desert
ed Stanford a week ago found
itself this past weekend with
complete game wins from both
Willie Adams and Jamie Sepe
da. Adams allowed only four
hits and Sepeda five, numbers
that become unbeatable when
you are supported by 11 and
nine runs respectively.
The result was a 2-1 series
win that most team members
saw as critical before the week
end began. The Six-Pac race is
tight, with no clear leader at this
point. The Sun Devils are still on
top with a 10-8 record, but Stan
ford is right on their heels at 9-9
as is Arizona (8-6), UCLA (9-8)
and USC (8-9).
What all this means is that
the Cardinal cannot afford any
more sweeps, but at the same

time if it does some sweeping of
its own, or keeps winning 2-of-3,
then another trip to the NCAA's
should be a lock. Nothing is
guaranteed, yet history has held
that at least three Six-Pac teams

will make the post-season, and
Stanford can certainly finish in
the top half of the league if one
thing stays stable:
Pitching
Any member of the baseball
team will tell you that pitching is
the key to this year's success.
Comparing the Cal series with the
Arizona State series shows this to
be true. The problem is that the
Stanford hurlers have been any
thing but consistent thus year, and
their 5.81 team ERA in Six-Pac
play shows that when they are
bad, they can be very bad.
Yet the starting rotation of
Adams, Rick Helling, and Sepe
da have also shown they can be
very good. The question is, will
they be good at the right time?
National Champions are built
in college baseball from teams
who put it all together at the
end of the season. To find the
truth in this one must go no
further than Stanford's last
championship year. The 1988
squad surprised everybody by
putting aside its greatly incon
sistent regular season to peak
towards a second consecutive
national championship. They
did it in great part by taking a
pitching staff with a 4.38 ERA
and going 2.38 in the College
World Series.
There is no doubt that the
Cardinal's current staff has the
potential to do likewise; will
they is another matter. Yes, the
Stanford baseball team has the
talent to be on a list of possible
1992 NCAA Champions, but
their fate is in their own hands.

National Champions are built
in college baseball from teams
who put it all together at the
end of the season. To find the
truth in this one must go no
further than Stanford's last
championship year. The 1988
squad surprised everybody by
putting aside its greatly incon
sistent regular season to peak
towards a second consecutive
national championship. They
did it in great part by taking a
pitching staff with a 4.38 ERA
and going 2.38 in the College
World Series.
There is no doubt that the
Cardinal's current staff has the
potential to do likewise; will
they is another matter. Yes, the
Stanford baseball team has the
talent to be on a list of possible
1992 NCAA Champions, but
their fate is in their own hands.
