# African leader says continent is ignored in U.S. foreign policy

While democracy is sweep
ing Eastern Europe — and
receiving considerable atten
tion in the United States — the
western world is ignoring
Africa's attempts at moving
toward democracy, according to
Solomon Gomes, a representa
tive of the Organization of
African Unity.
In fact, Gomes said, African
nations' attempts at democracy
are being hindered by undemo
cratic treatment from the United
States and other western nations.
Gomes — who represents
the organization's permanent
mission to the United Nations
— was at Stanford last night to
deliver the keynote address for
Africa Week, a celebration of
African culture sponsored by
the Stanford African Students
Association.
The Organization of African
Unity is an association of 51
African countries that acts as a
"civil service" — similar to the
role the United Nations plays
on an international level,
Gomes said.
In an interview, Gomes said
he is concerned about the lack
of attention and aid the United
States and other industrialized
countries give Africa. While
Africa is attempting to become

more democratic, the western
world is blocking the changes
through undemocratic econom
ic practices, he said.
According to Gomes, the
move toward African democra
cy is not only determined by
internal African politics, but is
a "question of the relationship
Africa as a continent has with
the international economic sys
tem," a system that is dominat
ed by the west.
Western nations claim to be
democratic, he said, but are not
democratic in their dealings
with other countries.
"There is an imbalance" of
power, Gomes said. "If you
have a group of seven countries
saying how the rest will live,
that's not democratic."
Instead of giving aid to Africa
— as the United Nations has
suggested — Gomes said the
world has concentrated its aid
and resources on Eastern
Europe, reflecting the western
priority system that treats Africa
as relatively unimportant.
Gomes said the lack of eco
nomic assistance creates a prob
lem for Africa, which is rich in
natural resources but does not
have the tools to fully take
advantage of those resources.
This discrepancy results in a
net outflow of those assets
