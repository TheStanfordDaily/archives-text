# African leader says continent is ignored in U.S. foreign policy
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
While democracy is sweep
ing Eastern Europe — and
receiving considerable atten
tion in the United States — the
western world is ignoring
Africa's attempts at moving
toward democracy, according to
Solomon Gomes, a representa
tive of the Organization of
African Unity.
In fact, Gomes said, African
nations' attempts at democracy
are being hindered by undemo
cratic treatment from the United
States and other western nations.
Gomes — who represents
the organization's permanent
mission to the United Nations
— was at Stanford last night to
deliver the keynote address for
Africa Week, a celebration of
African culture sponsored by
the Stanford African Students
Association.
The Organization of African
Unity is an association of 51
African countries that acts as a
"civil service" — similar to the
role the United Nations plays
on an international level,
Gomes said.
In an interview, Gomes said
he is concerned about the lack
of attention and aid the United
States and other industrialized
countries give Africa. While
Africa is attempting to become

more democratic, the western
world is blocking the changes
through undemocratic econom
ic practices, he said.
According to Gomes, the
move toward African democra
cy is not only determined by
internal African politics, but is
a "question of the relationship
Africa as a continent has with
the international economic sys
tem," a system that is dominat
ed by the west.
Western nations claim to be
democratic, he said, but are not
democratic in their dealings
with other countries.
"There is an imbalance" of
power, Gomes said. "If you
have a group of seven countries
saying how the rest will live,
that's not democratic."
Instead of giving aid to Africa
— as the United Nations has
suggested — Gomes said the
world has concentrated its aid
and resources on Eastern
Europe, reflecting the western
priority system that treats Africa
as relatively unimportant.
Gomes said the lack of eco
nomic assistance creates a prob
lem for Africa, which is rich in
natural resources but does not
have the tools to fully take
advantage of those resources.
This discrepancy results in a
net outflow of those assets
from Africa, along with the
migration of many educated
Africans — a phenomenon
Gomes calls the "African Brain
Drain."
"Africa is the richest conti
nent, and yet it's the poorest,"
Gomes said. "The resources are
there. What is missing is the
know-how. And there are a lot of
brains wasting (in America)."
Gomes added that racism may
be partially to blame for Africa's
status. While it is difficult to
determine to what extent race
relations affect international pol
icy, Gomes said the "factor of race
will always be" part of world poli
tics to some degree.
He said recent governmental
upheavals in Liberia and
Yugoslavia illustrate this princi
ple. According to Gomes, when
Liberia was recently in a state of
anarchy, the United States had
"basically no response." Howev
er, when ethnic fighting broke
out in Yugoslavia, the United
States was quick to send an envoy
to the troubled country.
"Why is there so much interest
in Yugoslavia and less in
Liberia?" Gomes asked. "A man
killed in Yugoslavia and a man
killed in Liberia are the same."
