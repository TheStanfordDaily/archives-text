# Police search for suspects in switch of Daily editorial
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
Stanford police are investigat
ing the placement of a fake edito
rial in yesterday's Daily by two
men impersonating Daily staff
members.
The phony editorial endorsed
the"I Prefer Not to Have a COP"
slate. The real editorial, which
endorses "Independents: A New
Era" for Council of Presidents, was
replaced at The Daily's printing
plant at 5 a.m. yesterday. It appears
on page four of today's Daily.
Officer Greg Hensel of the
Stanford Police called the inci
dent a "serious" matter and "a
crime." He would not comment
on possible charges until the
investigation progresses.
Under California Penal Code
No. 474, it is a felony to send by
telephone a "false message" pur
porting to be from another person
with intent to deceive. The maxi
mum sentence is one year in state
prison or a fine of $10,000.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole said she would also begin
investigating the incident today.
At about 4 a.m. yesterday, Paul
Fry, Fricke-Parks Press' camera
supervisor — who prepares The
Daily to be printed — said he was
called by someone who said, "This
is (editor in chief) Mike Laris from
The Stanford Daily."
The caller then said that
"there had been a late [editorial]
board meeting and they wanted to
send a new edit down," Fry said.
The person left the phone
number 723-8218, saying that he
could be contacted more quickly
at that number, Fry said. That
number is The Stanford Review's
business line, according to David
O. Sacks, the Review's managing
editor.
But Sacks said, "I don't think the
Review people have anything to do
with this. It concerns me that some
one would give out our number."
Several student publications

share that office and have access to
the line. There is no evidence indi
cating who made the calls to Fry.
Fry said he called that number
later to confirm that the change
could be made. "I said, 'Mike?'
and the guy on the phone said,
'Yeah,' " Fry said.
He said he has spoken to Laris
before, but could not distinguish
the voice on the phone because of
the noise at the press.
At 5 a.m., "two young men
arrived. One was quite tall —
about 6'4", with close-cropped
hair, and the other was about s*B"
with wire-rimmed glasses and
long hair," Fry said.
"We were in the plating room,
which is monochromatic, so I
couldn't really tell hair color," he
said. "But if I saw them again, I
would probably recognize them."
Fry also said he saw their car,
which he described as a "faded
'70s coupe."
He said he wanted to contact
Laris to tell him the copy had
arrived safely, but the printer's
list of Daily editors' home phone
numbers had been misplaced.
Even though the new editorial
was not in the correct typeface,
Fry said he did not question it
because the two men explained
that they had not had time to
tighten up the copy in typesetting.
The new copy "was within an
inch of fitting the actual copy
(space), so there is a certain
amount of reasonableness" in
accepting the new copy, Fry added.
"I've been working with The
Daily on and off for about 15
years, and this has never hap
pened before," Fry said of the
false substitution.
Every year, The Daily's edito
rial board endorses a COP slate
after interviewing the candidates.
This volume's editorial board
consists of nine editors, one staff
at-large member and a communi
ty-at-large member.
"I don't think lying to the
24,000 people who read The Daily
is a joke," Laris said. "I'll have no
sympathy when the people respon
sible are arrested."
added that only he and
the two managing editors —
whom the printers recognize —
are now authorized to bring any
changes to the printer.
Members of the"I Prefer Not
to Have a COP" slate said they
know nothing about the incident.
Blake Ilstrup, a member of the
slate, said he was surprised when
he saw yesterday's editorial
because he didn't think his slate
would get the endorsement. He said
he called The Daily yesterday

morning to see if the endorsement
was true and found out that it was
not.
Ed Mun, another member of
the "Prefer" slate, said he
thought someone might be trying
to frame his slate or that this was
possibly the work of one of his
slate's supporters.
Mun said he thought the inci
dent generated positive publicity
for his slate yesterday, when
many people read the editorial
and thought it was the actual one.
Hearings Officer Jason Moore
said the elections commission
has no plans to take action until
it finds out who switched the
editorial. He said that if the peo
ple who did it are associated with
a slate, the slate will be disquali
fied. If they are part of an orga
nization, the group will also be
removed from the ballot.

ing the placement of a fake edito
rial in yesterday's Daily by two
men impersonating Daily staff
members.
The phony editorial endorsed
the"I Prefer Not to Have a COP"
slate. The real editorial, which
endorses "Independents: A New
Era" for Council of Presidents, was
replaced at The Daily's printing
plant at 5 a.m. yesterday. It appears
on page four of today's Daily.
Officer Greg Hensel of the
Stanford Police called the inci
dent a "serious" matter and "a
crime." He would not comment
on possible charges until the
investigation progresses.
Under California Penal Code
No. 474, it is a felony to send by
telephone a "false message" pur
porting to be from another person
with intent to deceive. The maxi
mum sentence is one year in state
prison or a fine of $10,000.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole said she would also begin
investigating the incident today.
At about 4 a.m. yesterday, Paul
Fry, Fricke-Parks Press' camera
supervisor — who prepares The
Daily to be printed — said he was
called by someone who said, "This
is (editor in chief) Mike Laris from
The Stanford Daily."
The caller then said that
"there had been a late [editorial]
board meeting and they wanted to
send a new edit down," Fry said.
The person left the phone
number 723-8218, saying that he
could be contacted more quickly
at that number, Fry said. That
number is The Stanford Review's
business line, according to David
O. Sacks, the Review's managing
editor.
But Sacks said, "I don't think the
Review people have anything to do
with this. It concerns me that some
one would give out our number."
Several student publications

share that office and have access to
the line. There is no evidence indi
cating who made the calls to Fry.
Fry said he called that number
later to confirm that the change
could be made. "I said, 'Mike?'
and the guy on the phone said,
'Yeah,' " Fry said.
He said he has spoken to Laris
before, but could not distinguish
the voice on the phone because of
the noise at the press.
At 5 a.m., "two young men
arrived. One was quite tall —
about 6'4", with close-cropped
hair, and the other was about s*B"
with wire-rimmed glasses and
long hair," Fry said.
"We were in the plating room,
which is monochromatic, so I
couldn't really tell hair color," he
said. "But if I saw them again, I
would probably recognize them."
Fry also said he saw their car,
which he described as a "faded
'70s coupe."
He said he wanted to contact
Laris to tell him the copy had
arrived safely, but the printer's
list of Daily editors' home phone
numbers had been misplaced.
Even though the new editorial
was not in the correct typeface,
Fry said he did not question it
because the two men explained
that they had not had time to
tighten up the copy in typesetting.
The new copy "was within an
inch of fitting the actual copy
(space), so there is a certain
amount of reasonableness" in
accepting the new copy, Fry added.
"I've been working with The
Daily on and off for about 15
years, and this has never hap
pened before," Fry said of the
false substitution.
Every year, The Daily's edito
rial board endorses a COP slate
after interviewing the candidates.
This volume's editorial board
consists of nine editors, one staff
at-large member and a communi
ty-at-large member.
"I don't think lying to the
24,000 people who read The Daily
is a joke," Laris said. "I'll have no
sympathy when the people respon
sible are arrested."
added that only he and
the two managing editors —
whom the printers recognize —
are now authorized to bring any
changes to the printer.
Members of the"I Prefer Not
to Have a COP" slate said they
know nothing about the incident.
Blake Ilstrup, a member of the
slate, said he was surprised when
he saw yesterday's editorial
because he didn't think his slate
would get the endorsement. He said
he called The Daily yesterday

morning to see if the endorsement
was true and found out that it was
not.
Ed Mun, another member of
the "Prefer" slate, said he
thought someone might be trying
to frame his slate or that this was
possibly the work of one of his
slate's supporters.
Mun said he thought the inci
dent generated positive publicity
for his slate yesterday, when
many people read the editorial
and thought it was the actual one.
Hearings Officer Jason Moore
said the elections commission
has no plans to take action until
it finds out who switched the
editorial. He said that if the peo
ple who did it are associated with
a slate, the slate will be disquali
fied. If they are part of an orga
nization, the group will also be
removed from the ballot.
