# Changes, choices mark this year's Draw
## 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
Don't look now, but the Draw
is just around the corner.
The opening of Manzanita II
and three new focus houses, new
food service options and changes
in the waiting list/reassignment
procedures will mark this year's
housing lottery, scheduled for
May 11-13.
"Manzanita II North" and
"Manzanita II South" — as they
are temporarily called — are
choices in the Draw this spring.
Both residences will be upper
class, housing approximately 100
students each, according to this
year's Drawbook.
According to Residence Dean
Barbara Kline-Schoder, who
supervises undergraduate hous
ing, Manzanita II will have rooms
similar to those in Kimball Hall.
Each residence will have 22 sin
gles, 13 one-room doubles and 27
two-room doubles.
Manzanita II will share kitchen
facilities with Kimball but will
have separate dining facilities.
Because the Manzanita II resi
dences will not be finished until
this summer, blueprints will be
available at a special meeting for
students interested in drawing
into those houses.
With the opening of Manzanita
11, Manzanita Park trailers will
become exclusively graduate stu
dent housing and will not be an
undergraduate option in this year's
Draw.
Hammarskjold House, which
used to have a separate lottery,
will now be an option in the main
Draw. International students will
receive priorities for the house "in

much the same way that ethnic
priorities are given for cross-cul
tural theme houses," said Kline-
Schoder. In addition, two special
priorities will be available to all
students, regardless of nationality.
Priorities are offered at certain
residences on the basis of ethnici
ty, nationality or special criteria,
such as signing a board agreement
or writing a theme project propos

al. Students who obtain a priority
to a given residence and list that
residence specifically on their
Draw cards increase their chances
of being assigned to that residence.
558 Mayfield, formerly a Uni
versity-operated house with Uni
versity Food Service and cleaning,
will become a self-op next year.
The house will be cleaned by the
University, but students will

manage the kitchen and establish
their own board plan.
675 Lomita may be returned to
the Theta Delta Chi fraternity,
depending on the results of their
Rush. A decision on whether the
house will return to the fraternity
will not be made until May 4, the
deadline for accepting fraternity
bids.

This rare view of the forthcoming residence Manazanita It can only be attained from the third floor of
Kimball Hall. The new dorms will open to students next fall, adding 200 spots to the housing available
on campus.
