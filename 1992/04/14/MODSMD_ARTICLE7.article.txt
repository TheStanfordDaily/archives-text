had 36 percent and Brown won 12 percent.
"Virginia voters cast a decisive vote for change," Clinton said

Reagan rushed, but unhurt
LAS VEGAS (AP) — An anti-nuclear activist rushed a stage
where former President Reagan was speaking Monday, grabbed a
large crystal statue and smashed it. Pieces of glass hit Reagan in
the head, but he wasn't hurt.
The man then tried to speak into the microphone as Reagan,
appearing angry and startled, stood next to him. But Secret Ser
vice agents grabbed the protester, shoved him into the podium and
tackled him. The 81-year-old Reagan was jostled during the scuf
fle.
Agents hustled the struggling assailant away while others
rushed Reagan to the side of the stage at the National Association
of Broadcasters convention.
Reagan returned to the podium moments later.
