"One mile, four hours," said
freshman Shana Yansen, describ
ing the National Organization of
Women's March for Women's
Lives in Washington, D.C. last
Sunday. "It was really intense."
Yansen and five other Stanford
Pro-Choice Alliance members flew
to Washington to represent Stanford
under a "huge banner" in a 750,000-
person demonstration that included
speeches from leading abortion
activists and celebrities such as
Cyndi Lauper and Jane Fonda.
"The magnitude was incredible,"
said freshman Eloise Lawrence,
another member of the Alliance.
Freshman Sally Haskovec, who
also marched, said, "The feeling I
remember most is when we were...
waiting to march and we could hear
the cheers ... washing over the
crowd until it was all around you ...
a united mass of people."

Lawrence said "the main pur
pose of the march was to show the
politicians that the majority is
pro-choice and if they aren't they
won't get elected."
Yansen said the march proved to
her that "as students we really can
get involved and make a difference."
She said the group was encour-

'We were a part of
something that could
be in history books.'

aged to participate by Kate
Michelman, executive director of
the National Abortion Rights
League, when she visited Stan
ford last quarter.
Alliance members wrote letters
to doctors at the Stanford Medical

Center, especially targeting
female physicians, to get funding
for the trip.
"We asked if they'd like to
sponsor one of us instead of going
themselves," said Yansen, explain
ing that although many doctors
supported the march, they were
unable to leave Stanford to attend.
The group raised more than
$ 1,000, Yansen said, with an average
donation of about $50. "We traveled
on American Express vouchers and
paid our own expenses while we
were there," Yansen said.
The members stayed with Stan
ford graduates now living in Wash
ington, who also marched under
the Stanford banner.
Lawrence said they felt the march
was a uniquely American experience.
"I was so glad I was American
People were allowed to be there.
They were making a statement. You
realize people do care."
Yansen said the point was driv
en home when she read the news
papers the next morning and saw
photographs of demonstrations in
eastern Europe that were a sharp
contrast to the peaceful abortion
rights rally.
"You look at these pictures and
[demonstrators] were being
thrown on the ground and threat
ened," Yansen said.
Lawrence added, "We were a
part of something that could be in
history books."
The members also noted the
diversity of marchers, who includ
ed all "ages, ethnicity, socioeco
nomic backgrounds and religious
affiliations," Yansen said.
Lawrence, who marched with
her mother and grandmother,
said she liked making the march
"a three-generational thing" and
added that she was "impressed by

how many men were there."
Haskovec estimated that men
made up about 20 percent of the
marchers.
Despite this diversity, Yansen
said she felt unity among the par
ticipants. "There was such a
peaceful feeling. There was such a
camaraderie among people. The
sense was that we were fighting
for something, not against it."
Marchers were entertained by
what they termed "self-appointed
musicians," who banged on street
signs and buckets in time with the

demonstrators' chants.
"The big slogan was 'we won't
go back,"' said Lawrence, adding
that other slogans were more
explicit, such as "Don't let them
fetus any crap" and "U.S. out of
my uterus."
The march also gave partici
pants a sense of history, Haskovec
said. "Our generation is lulled
into a false sense of security
because we've grown up with the
right of a safe and legal abortion,"
she said. "I never realized how
close we were to returning to . ..

deadly abortions."
Lawrence said that since she
has returned to campus she has
"gotten a few phone calls from
friends who've had to exercise
this right . . . and this makes me
realize the pressing need to keep
[abortion] a right for all women."
She added that although the
tendency at Stanford is to "forget
(political issues) while on cam
pus," the march "inspired me not
to fall into the apathy" she sees in
the Stanford community. "It
restores your faith," she said.


Freshmen Shana Yansen, Eloise Lawrence and Sally Haskovec were among the 750,000 people who
marched in Washington last Sunday with the National Organization of Women's March for Women's
Lives. Haskovec said she remembered hearing the cheers "washing over the crowd until it was all
around you ... a united mass of people."
