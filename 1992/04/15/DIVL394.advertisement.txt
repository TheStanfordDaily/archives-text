Joshua Powers
Indepedent Candidate For
ASSU Senate
• Opposes Party politics in Student Government.
• Will work to protect Students who rely on Financial Aid by:
-Demanding that the Administration seek Student
approval of drastic tuition increases.
-Insisting that budget cuts not diminish Aid to Students.
-Continuing and strengthening the relationship between
the ASSU Senate and the Financial Aid Advocacy Board.
• Opposes the "Skateboarding Ban" recently imposed on those
nice kids from Palo Alto. What's next, the Hackey-Sackers in
White Plaza? Stanford must retain its feeling of community.
• Has run an Environmentally Clean campaign, meaning NO
tree-eating fliers, handouts or paper airplanes.
• Would appreciate your vote on April 15 or 16. Or both if you
can manage it. Thank You.
