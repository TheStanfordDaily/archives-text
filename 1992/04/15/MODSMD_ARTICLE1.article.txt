# Rosse says goodbye to Stanford
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
For seven and a half years, Provost James
Rosse guided Stanford through major crises,
watershed moments in its history and con
tentious struggles over limited resources. The
soft-spoken Rosse is widely credited with hold
ing the University together during the clashes
over the revision of Western Culture and this
year's budget crisis.
He will leave today to become president and
chief executive officer of Freedom Newspapers,
Inc., a Southern California media chain.
Rosse's announcement in January that he
would leave Stanford took the campus by sur
prise. But Rosse said this week that he had
contemplated leaving the provost's office for
several years.
"I stayed through at least a year, maybe two
years longer than I wanted to. . . because of

the series of crises that came along. I didn't feel
like it was a good time for me to leave."
As provost, Rosse was considered a master
of process, adept at involving faculty in deci
sions and building broad support. "He knows
what you have to do to get consensus on diffi
cult matters," University President Donald
Kennedy said yesterday.
"A university of the quality of Stanford,"
Rosse said, "depends on faculty who are strong
enough and independent enough in their own
right that they're not about to be driven."
Leadership in an academic institution is
really "a partnership in which the administra
tion, the leadership of the institution needs to
engage the capacities, the consensus, the
judgement of the faculty," he added.
Wielding the budget axe
In the past year Rosse led the process by
which the University confronted the monu

mental task of reducing its operating budget
by $43 million, or 12 percent.
He attempted to open the budget process to
faculty, students and staff through the use of
committees, task forces and liaison teams. In
fact, many feel the inclusion emphasized by
Rosse often bogged the process down in
parochial bickering and made it more difficult
to isolate weak programs for elimination.
But the calamity that many feared at the start
of the budget crisis — the departure of disillu
sioned faculty members — never materialized.
The $42 million package of budget cuts — $1 mil
lion short of the original target — passed the Fac
ulty Senate Thursday with little complaint.
"I'll have to confess to a degree of worry of my
own" early in the year about faculty
Rosse said. "Another serious event during the
course of the year could have destabilized the

place pretty badly — we were that
close, in my opinion.
"But as the year wore on, and as
it became clear that there were no
other cataclysms that were about to
be visited upon us, (and) we came
closer to the time that we realized
that we could deal with most of the
problems that were in front of us
... then that danger diminished."
Rosse said the intense involve
ment of faculty, staff and stu
dents on budget committees gave
people a much-needed familiarity
with the ins and outs of the Uni
versity's fiscal realities.
"That kind of learning needed to
take place," he said. "The institu
tion had perked along without the
individuals having to pay a lot of
attention to issues like that for a
long time, and when it fell apart, it
was hard for people to understand"
the sources of the University's

financial constraints and the need to
downsize the institution, Rosse said.
Guiding the debate
While the University's budget
crisis was among the most diffi
cult issues Rosse has faced, in
some ways, he said, it wasn't the
most challenging.
"In a certain sense [the budgetl
wasn't as challenging as some
other things because one could see
how to do it. It was soluble in a
certain sense.
"I think that the revision of the
Western Culture requirement
was ... a greater challenge
because that was not something I
could do much about."
Others, however, say Rosse did
much to hold the faculty together
during the explosive debate,
which received national headlines
and drew campus visits by Jesse
Jackson and then-Secretary of
Education William Bennett.
"The faculty's ability to trust
Jim Rosse really saved things," said
Senior Assoc. Dean of Humanities

and Sciences Carolyn Lougee, who
chaired the Faculty Senate and
then served as Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies during the discussion.
Bypassing the traditional insti
tutions of faculty governance, the
senate asked Rosse to design a pro-

cess that would encourage wider
yet more focused debate. Rosse
created and appointed the task
force that eventually recommend
ed the creation of the Cultures,
Ideas and Values program, which
revamped the Western Culture

curriculum by including works
from non-European cultures and
by women and minorities.
'Repositioning* was needed
Rosse said he views the reorga
nization of Stanford's administra
tion and decision-making process
es as "unfinished business."
The new structure, which was
initiated in spring 1990, gives
deans responsibility for many of
the University's budget and aca
demic support decisions, invest
ing more administrative power in
academic officials than at most
other major universities.
"Repositioning" was controver
sial at Stanford, in part because it
was accompanied by $22 million in
budget cuts and in part because it
decentralized the graduate studies
office, transferring its functions to
the individual schools.
But Rosse said Stanford sorely
needed such a reorganization. Three
decades ago, the University "was
very different in terms of size, scale
and mission than the university we
have, and yet the organizational
structure that was in place when I
became provost was largely the same
organizational structure that had
persisted from the beginning."
The infant organizational
structure received its first test dur
ing the budget crisis, in which the
Cabinet — composed of the presi
dent, provost and deans — became
the central decision-making body.
Rosse said the leadership of the
deans in making academic and
administrative cuts was critical.
"The deans are the ones on
whom we must count most strong
ly for the development of our aca
demic program. They're our prod
uct-line managers, if you will."
While incoming University
President Gerhard Casper has
expressed concern that Stanford's
administration is still unwieldy,
Rosse said the new structure is
fundamentally strong and has
provided a model for restructur
ing at other universities. At the
same time, he acknowledges that
there is room for improvement.
Heading for Freedom
Rosse's new position will find
him in his intellectual home.
Rosse is considered a national
expert in the economics of mass,
media. The son of a Nebraska
newspaper editor, Rosse first set
type at the age of four. "I had to
stand on a stool to reach the darn
press," he said.

But Rosse said he was sur
prised when a corporate search
firm approached him about the
position last fall.
He said he originally consid
ered leaving academia and joining
the business world "a strange
idea. But the more we talked, over
a period of weeks and months, the
more reasonable it sounded. The
strong intellectual interest, the
background in the industry I
have, plus the experience I've had
as a manager and leader in the
University seemed to suit me
pretty well for this job."
Rosse will have more freedom in
calling the shots in his new job, but
said he expects to lead in much the
same way as he did at Stanford.
"People have asked me, 'In your
new job, if you want something
done, it's going to be done.' That's
basically true.... You do have a

little more capacity to make things
go. On the other hand, success in
that kind of an environment
depends on the same feature ...
that's fundamentally making good
judgments and persuading people
that they are good judgments.
"The read issue is getting tuned
to the different culture of the
organization, to the extent to
which one can lead by marching
in front versus marching as a part
of the crowd and bringing people
along with you.
"I'll either be a failure and be
back in two years, or I'll stay for
seven or eight years and then
retire," said Rosse, who plans
eventually to return to Stanford
as an emeritus professor.
"We'll have to see if it will be
successful but I'm reasonably
optimistic. I think it's going to be
a lot of fun."

created and appointed the task

ed the creation of the Cultures,
Ideas and Values program, which
revamped the Western Culture

curriculum by including works
from non-European cultures and
by women and minorities.
'Repositioning* was needed
Rosse said he views the reorga
nization of Stanford's administra
tion and decision-making process
es as "unfinished business."
The new structure, which was
initiated in spring 1990, gives
deans responsibility for many of
the University's budget and aca
demic support decisions, invest
ing more administrative power in
academic officials than at most
other major universities.
"Repositioning" was controver
sial at Stanford, in part because it
was accompanied by $22 million in
budget cuts and in part because it
decentralized the graduate studies
office, transferring its functions to
the individual schools.
But Rosse said Stanford sorely
needed such a reorganization. Three
decades ago, the University "was
very different in terms of size, scale
and mission than the university we
have, and yet the organizational
structure that was in place when I
became provost was largely the same
organizational structure that had
persisted from the beginning."
The infant organizational
structure received its first test dur
ing the budget crisis, in which the
Cabinet — composed of the presi
dent, provost and deans — became
the central decision-making body.
Rosse said the leadership of the
deans in making academic and
administrative cuts was critical.
"The deans are the ones on
whom we must count most strong
ly for the development of our aca
demic program. They're our prod
uct-line managers, if you will."
While incoming University
President Gerhard Casper has
expressed concern that Stanford's
administration is still unwieldy,
Rosse said the new structure is
fundamentally strong and has
provided a model for restructur
ing at other universities. At the
same time, he acknowledges that
there is room for improvement.
Heading for Freedom
Rosse's new position will find
him in his intellectual home.
Rosse is considered a national
expert in the economics of mass,
media. The son of a Nebraska
newspaper editor, Rosse first set
type at the age of four. "I had to
stand on a stool to reach the darn
press," he said.

But Rosse said he was sur
prised when a corporate search
firm approached him about the
position last fall.
He said he originally consid
ered leaving academia and joining
the business world "a strange
idea. But the more we talked, over
a period of weeks and months, the
more reasonable it sounded. The
strong intellectual interest, the
background in the industry I
have, plus the experience I've had
as a manager and leader in the
University seemed to suit me
pretty well for this job."
Rosse will have more freedom in
calling the shots in his new job, but
said he expects to lead in much the
same way as he did at Stanford.
"People have asked me, 'In your
new job, if you want something
done, it's going to be done.' That's
basically true.... You do have a

little more capacity to make things
go. On the other hand, success in
that kind of an environment
depends on the same feature ...
that's fundamentally making good
judgments and persuading people
that they are good judgments.
"The read issue is getting tuned
to the different culture of the
organization, to the extent to
which one can lead by marching
in front versus marching as a part
of the crowd and bringing people
along with you.
"I'll either be a failure and be
back in two years, or I'll stay for
seven or eight years and then
retire," said Rosse, who plans
eventually to return to Stanford
as an emeritus professor.
"We'll have to see if it will be
successful but I'm reasonably
optimistic. I think it's going to be
a lot of fun."


Rajiv Chandrasekaran — Daily
Provost James Rosse smiles with James Gaither, president of the Board of Trustees, in a rare, pres
sure-free moment. For the past several years Rosse has been provost, he has led the University
through tough financial and academic debates. Rosse "knows what you have to do to get consensus on
difficult matters," according to University President Donald Kennedy.
For seven and a half years, Provost James
Rosse guided Stanford through major crises,
watershed moments in its history and con
tentious struggles over limited resources. The
soft-spoken Rosse is widely credited with hold
ing the University together during the clashes
over the revision of Western Culture and this
year's budget crisis.
He will leave today to become president and
chief executive officer of Freedom Newspapers,
Inc., a Southern California media chain.
Rosse's announcement in January that he
would leave Stanford took the campus by sur
prise. But Rosse said this week that he had
contemplated leaving the provost's office for
several years.
"I stayed through at least a year, maybe two
years longer than I wanted to. . . because of

the series of crises that came along. I didn't feel
like it was a good time for me to leave."
As provost, Rosse was considered a master
of process, adept at involving faculty in deci
sions and building broad support. "He knows
what you have to do to get consensus on diffi
cult matters," University President Donald
Kennedy said yesterday.
"A university of the quality of Stanford,"
Rosse said, "depends on faculty who are strong
enough and independent enough in their own
right that they're not about to be driven."
Leadership in an academic institution is
really "a partnership in which the administra
tion, the leadership of the institution needs to
engage the capacities, the consensus, the
judgement of the faculty," he added.
Wielding the budget axe
In the past year Rosse led the process by
which the University confronted the monu

mental task of reducing its operating budget
by $43 million, or 12 percent.
He attempted to open the budget process to
faculty, students and staff through the use of
committees, task forces and liaison teams. In
fact, many feel the inclusion emphasized by
Rosse often bogged the process down in
parochial bickering and made it more difficult
to isolate weak programs for elimination.
But the calamity that many feared at the start
of the budget crisis — the departure of disillu
sioned faculty members — never materialized.
The $42 million package of budget cuts — $1 mil
lion short of the original target — passed the Fac
ulty Senate Thursday with little complaint.
"I'll have to confess to a degree of worry of my
own" early in the year about faculty
Rosse said. "Another serious event during the
course of the year could have destabilized the

place pretty badly — we were that
close, in my opinion.
"But as the year wore on, and as
it became clear that there were no
other cataclysms that were about to
be visited upon us, (and) we came
closer to the time that we realized
that we could deal with most of the
problems that were in front of us
... then that danger diminished."
Rosse said the intense involve
ment of faculty, staff and stu
dents on budget committees gave
people a much-needed familiarity
with the ins and outs of the Uni
versity's fiscal realities.
"That kind of learning needed to
take place," he said. "The institu
tion had perked along without the
individuals having to pay a lot of
attention to issues like that for a
long time, and when it fell apart, it
was hard for people to understand"
the sources of the University's

financial constraints and the need to
downsize the institution, Rosse said.
Guiding the debate
While the University's budget
crisis was among the most diffi
cult issues Rosse has faced, in
some ways, he said, it wasn't the
most challenging.
"In a certain sense [the budgetl
wasn't as challenging as some
other things because one could see
how to do it. It was soluble in a
certain sense.
"I think that the revision of the
Western Culture requirement
was ... a greater challenge
because that was not something I
could do much about."
Others, however, say Rosse did
much to hold the faculty together
during the explosive debate,
which received national headlines
and drew campus visits by Jesse
Jackson and then-Secretary of
Education William Bennett.
"The faculty's ability to trust
Jim Rosse really saved things," said

Provost James Rosse smiles with James Gaither, president of the Board of Trustees, in a rare, pres
sure-free moment. For the past several years Rosse has been provost, he has led the University
through tough financial and academic debates. Rosse "knows what you have to do to get consensus on
difficult matters," according to University President Donald Kennedy.
For seven and a half years, Provost James
Rosse guided Stanford through major crises,
watershed moments in its history and con
tentious struggles over limited resources. The
soft-spoken Rosse is widely credited with hold
ing the University together during the clashes
over the revision of Western Culture and this
year's budget crisis.
He will leave today to become president and
chief executive officer of Freedom Newspapers,
Inc., a Southern California media chain.
Rosse's announcement in January that he
would leave Stanford took the campus by sur
prise. But Rosse said this week that he had
contemplated leaving the provost's office for
several years.
"I stayed through at least a year, maybe two
years longer than I wanted to. . . because of

the series of crises that came along. I didn't feel
like it was a good time for me to leave."
As provost, Rosse was considered a master
of process, adept at involving faculty in deci
sions and building broad support. "He knows
what you have to do to get consensus on diffi
cult matters," University President Donald
Kennedy said yesterday.
"A university of the quality of Stanford,"
Rosse said, "depends on faculty who are strong
enough and independent enough in their own
right that they're not about to be driven."
Leadership in an academic institution is
really "a partnership in which the administra
tion, the leadership of the institution needs to
engage the capacities, the consensus, the
judgement of the faculty," he added.
Wielding the budget axe
In the past year Rosse led the process by
which the University confronted the monu

mental task of reducing its operating budget
by $43 million, or 12 percent.
He attempted to open the budget process to
faculty, students and staff through the use of
committees, task forces and liaison teams. In
fact, many feel the inclusion emphasized by
Rosse often bogged the process down in
parochial bickering and made it more difficult
to isolate weak programs for elimination.
But the calamity that many feared at the start
of the budget crisis — the departure of disillu
sioned faculty members — never materialized.
The $42 million package of budget cuts — $1 mil
lion short of the original target — passed the Fac
ulty Senate Thursday with little complaint.
"I'll have to confess to a degree of worry of my
own" early in the year about faculty
Rosse said. "Another serious event during the
course of the year could have destabilized the

place pretty badly — we were that
close, in my opinion.
"But as the year wore on, and as
it became clear that there were no
other cataclysms that were about to
be visited upon us, (and) we came
closer to the time that we realized
that we could deal with most of the
problems that were in front of us
... then that danger diminished."
Rosse said the intense involve
ment of faculty, staff and stu
dents on budget committees gave
people a much-needed familiarity
with the ins and outs of the Uni
versity's fiscal realities.
"That kind of learning needed to
take place," he said. "The institu
tion had perked along without the
individuals having to pay a lot of
attention to issues like that for a
long time, and when it fell apart, it
was hard for people to understand"
the sources of the University's

financial constraints and the need to
downsize the institution, Rosse said.
Guiding the debate
While the University's budget
crisis was among the most diffi
cult issues Rosse has faced, in
some ways, he said, it wasn't the
most challenging.
"In a certain sense [the budgetl
wasn't as challenging as some
other things because one could see
how to do it. It was soluble in a
certain sense.
"I think that the revision of the
Western Culture requirement
was ... a greater challenge
because that was not something I
could do much about."
Others, however, say Rosse did
much to hold the faculty together
during the explosive debate,
which received national headlines
and drew campus visits by Jesse
Jackson and then-Secretary of
Education William Bennett.
"The faculty's ability to trust
Jim Rosse really saved things," said
Senior Assoc. Dean of Humanities

and Sciences Carolyn Lougee, who
chaired the Faculty Senate and
then served as Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies during the discussion.
Bypassing the traditional insti
tutions of faculty governance, the
senate asked Rosse to design a pro-

cess that would encourage wider
yet more focused debate. Rosse
created and appointed the task
force that eventually recommend
ed the creation of the Cultures,
Ideas and Values program, which
revamped the Western Culture

curriculum by including works
from non-European cultures and
by women and minorities.
'Repositioning* was needed
Rosse said he views the reorga
nization of Stanford's administra
tion and decision-making process
es as "unfinished business."
The new structure, which was
initiated in spring 1990, gives
deans responsibility for many of
the University's budget and aca
demic support decisions, invest
ing more administrative power in
academic officials than at most
other major universities.
"Repositioning" was controver
sial at Stanford, in part because it
was accompanied by $22 million in
budget cuts and in part because it
decentralized the graduate studies
office, transferring its functions to
the individual schools.
But Rosse said Stanford sorely
needed such a reorganization. Three
decades ago, the University "was
very different in terms of size, scale
and mission than the university we
have, and yet the organizational
structure that was in place when I
became provost was largely the same
organizational structure that had
persisted from the beginning."
The infant organizational
structure received its first test dur
ing the budget crisis, in which the
Cabinet — composed of the presi
dent, provost and deans — became
the central decision-making body.
Rosse said the leadership of the
deans in making academic and
administrative cuts was critical.
"The deans are the ones on
whom we must count most strong
ly for the development of our aca
demic program. They're our prod
uct-line managers, if you will."
While incoming University
President Gerhard Casper has
expressed concern that Stanford's
administration is still unwieldy,
Rosse said the new structure is
fundamentally strong and has
provided a model for restructur
ing at other universities. At the
same time, he acknowledges that
there is room for improvement.
Heading for Freedom
Rosse's new position will find
him in his intellectual home.
Rosse is considered a national
expert in the economics of mass,
media. The son of a Nebraska
newspaper editor, Rosse first set
type at the age of four. "I had to
stand on a stool to reach the darn
press," he said.

But Rosse said he was sur
prised when a corporate search
firm approached him about the
position last fall.
He said he originally consid
ered leaving academia and joining
the business world "a strange
idea. But the more we talked, over
a period of weeks and months, the
more reasonable it sounded. The
strong intellectual interest, the
background in the industry I
have, plus the experience I've had
as a manager and leader in the
University seemed to suit me
pretty well for this job."
Rosse will have more freedom in
calling the shots in his new job, but
said he expects to lead in much the
same way as he did at Stanford.
"People have asked me, 'In your
new job, if you want something
done, it's going to be done.' That's
basically true.... You do have a

little more capacity to make things
go. On the other hand, success in
that kind of an environment
depends on the same feature ...
that's fundamentally making good
judgments and persuading people
that they are good judgments.
"The read issue is getting tuned
to the different culture of the
organization, to the extent to
which one can lead by marching
in front versus marching as a part
of the crowd and bringing people
along with you.
"I'll either be a failure and be
back in two years, or I'll stay for
seven or eight years and then
retire," said Rosse, who plans
eventually to return to Stanford
as an emeritus professor.
"We'll have to see if it will be
successful but I'm reasonably
optimistic. I think it's going to be
a lot of fun."
