# Rosse says goodbye to Stanford

### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
For seven and a half years, Provost James
Rosse guided Stanford through major crises,
watershed moments in its history and con
tentious struggles over limited resources. The
soft-spoken Rosse is widely credited with hold
ing the University together during the clashes
over the revision of Western Culture and this
year's budget crisis.
He will leave today to become president and
chief executive officer of Freedom Newspapers,
Inc., a Southern California media chain.
Rosse's announcement in January that he
would leave Stanford took the campus by sur
prise. But Rosse said this week that he had
contemplated leaving the provost's office for
several years.
"I stayed through at least a year, maybe two
years longer than I wanted to. . . because of

the series of crises that came along. I didn't feel
like it was a good time for me to leave."
As provost, Rosse was considered a master
of process, adept at involving faculty in deci
sions and building broad support. "He knows
what you have to do to get consensus on diffi
cult matters," University President Donald
Kennedy said yesterday.
"A university of the quality of Stanford,"
Rosse said, "depends on faculty who are strong
enough and independent enough in their own
right that they're not about to be driven."
Leadership in an academic institution is
really "a partnership in which the administra
tion, the leadership of the institution needs to
engage the capacities, the consensus, the
judgement of the faculty," he added.
Wielding the budget axe
In the past year Rosse led the process by
which the University confronted the monu

mental task of reducing its operating budget
by $43 million, or 12 percent.
He attempted to open the budget process to
faculty, students and staff through the use of
committees, task forces and liaison teams. In
fact, many feel the inclusion emphasized by
Rosse often bogged the process down in
parochial bickering and made it more difficult
to isolate weak programs for elimination.
But the calamity that many feared at the start
of the budget crisis — the departure of disillu
sioned faculty members — never materialized.
The $42 million package of budget cuts — $1 mil
lion short of the original target — passed the Fac
ulty Senate Thursday with little complaint.
"I'll have to confess to a degree of worry of my
own" early in the year about faculty
Rosse said. "Another serious event during the
course of the year could have destabilized the


'I stayed
through at
least a year,
maybe two
years longer
than I wanted
... because of
the series of
crises that
came along.'
