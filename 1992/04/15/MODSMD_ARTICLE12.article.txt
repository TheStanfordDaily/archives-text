don't equal commitment to
hearing the student voice.
"Independents: A New Era"
may not have 50-yard-line football
seats, but their dedication to stu
dent issues — and not just events
— make them the clear choice for
next year's Council of Presidents.
Ron Brown, Delia Lopez, Jason
Snyder and Sherri Wolson have
based their campaign around
increasing communication with the
students — not just by delivering
speeches and writing newsletters,
as Students First has proposed, but
by soliciting input door to door and
forming a COP advisory board.
Another of the slate's strengths
lies in its lack of ties to a party and
the accompanying agenda. A slate
that has been hand-picked by a party
with members both in this year's
COP and in the ASSU senate has
inevitable obligations to that party.
The COP must actively pursue

issues, not just services. Candidates
may pledge that they will provide a
wide array of perks, but they don't
control the ASSU's pocketbook.
The Independents are commit
ted to preventing another tuition
hike and opening a financial aid
resource office to assist students in
dealing with the University.
Students First, on the other
hand, mentions neither of these
issues in their platform. At a uni
versity where costs are skyrocket
ing and more than 60 percent of
students receive financial aid, it's
hard to settle for a treasure hunt
and a sports clinic in the place of
vision and activism.
Popularity and calculating cam
paigning may win high school elec
tions, but they just aren't enough
at a university. While the Indepen
dents may not possess the charisma
and name recognition of the slicker
Students First, they will prove
more effective and accountable.
