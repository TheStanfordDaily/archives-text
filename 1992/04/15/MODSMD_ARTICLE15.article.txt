I remember happiness.
That pure kind of happiness
That "I don't know" kind of bliss
Life was wide open; no holds barred.
Exploration filled those days.
I remember the pleasure of just running
and being kissed by the wind.
Splashing through puddles.
Rolling in the grass down a hill.
Spinning around until you fell.
I remember happiness.
— Cary A Booker II
MY INNOCENCE FADED as every
one's does. I don't really miss my
youthful naivete and often only
remember it upon reflection. For me, pas
sion has filled the void — a passion for life.
I thank my parents for this. My child
hood lessons were simple and broad:
"The world is yours, Cory, accept the joys
and responsibilities of ownership."
This ethos, dogmatically imprinted
upon me by my parents, is responsible for
my most salient passion — my impatient
ambition.
Stanford is no stranger to my type, stu
dents voraciously working to achieve all
they can so they can leave and change the
world, leave their mark or make a buck.
I wanted to be a business major in high
school. My friends and I used to drive
around the adjacent town, looking at the
mansions strewn throughout the hills
and fantasize. These homes would be our
bases of operation. From them, our com

puter systems would lock into the world
— we would make deals, wield power and,
most importantly, sleep until noon.
When I got my football scholarship to
Stanford, it was a dream fulfilled. At that
point I knew I would be successful, I
would never be hungry, I would always
be clothed, my family would grow up in a
nice home and probably would also
attend the best schools. Sure, there still
is going to be a lot of work before I get my
house on the hill, but I will succeed.
Heck, my mom told me I would.
However, in all my confidence, which at
times borders on arrogance, I realize one
thing: I am no more special than the next
person. My accomplishments are not mine
alone. They are a product of my upbringing
— the many propitious elements which com
prised my childhood. Place anyone else in
my circumstances and they also would stand
a great chance of fulfilling their dreams.
God, I know how fortunate I am. One
child out of every five grows up below the
poverty line, one in two for black chil
dren. That's $13,000 a year for a family
of four. Within poverty as well as in other
socioeconomic sectors, there are myriad
risk factors wreaking havoc on a genera
tion of Americans.
The second-largest growing industry in
our country in the past few years has been
the security business. Alarms, guards and
fences are becoming commonplace. Amer
ica is racing to protect itself from itself.

Unskilled jobs are disappearing by the
hundreds of thousands, and companies
are complaining that there is a colossal
shortage of skilled labor.
And they have a right to complain. Our
schools have been rendered educationally
impotent because of their worsening situ
ations. Children are coming to school
emotionally, materially and nutritionally
unfit to learn. Violence is prevalent and
funerals are commonplace. The biggest
challenge for many schools is keeping the
children orderly and alive. "Don't cause
trouble and you will pass" is the motto.
The root of these problems and of our
general national decline is easy to find. It
lies with our children, who are in essence
our future. For the past twenty years,
conditions for children have steadily
declined. The evidence sadly surrounding
us soon will be undeniably.
My self-interest, my dreams and my
future lie the balance. I have been blessed
with the ability to make change. My
choice is obvious.
I remember happiness.

Breaks," "Within Our Reach " and "Sav
