Longmore is a mentor,
much-needed scholar
for Stanford's disabled
The teaching of disability issues from
a disabled perspective will soon cease at
Stanford unless something is done soon.
Dr. Paul Longmore, currently a visit
ing assistant professor in the History
department, will be leaving Stanford
this summer as his Mellon Fellowship
expires.
The gap he will leave is best seen by
understanding what he has done while
here.
Through his academic achievements
and his life experiences, Longmore had
enriched the Stanford community in the
following ways:
• Disability issues are either not thor
oughly discussed or not discussed at all
in different departments on campus.
As a disabled professor who is a lead
er in disability studies, Longmore
informs the current academic discourse.
• Longmore's insights on disabled
people as a minority group adds to Stan
ford's innovative pluralistic agenda.
• For the past two years, Longmore
has served as a mentor for students with
disabilities.
His guidance has helped many stu
dents to both question their assump
tions about themselves and to learn how
to view their disabilities as a positive
part of themselves.
In addition, Longmore is a positive
role model for many disabled students
who don't often see disabled people play
ing an important role in society.
• Longmore has given much of his
time to many of the disabled students at
Stanford.
His support has been monumental in
the creation of an active and supportive
disability community in which individu
als feel empowered to investigate their
identity, take risks and grow.
• Longmore is currently the only dis

abled professor teaching courses about
disability issues. Although disabled stu
dents can do much to teach their peers,
his intellectual analyses of societal and
personal conflicts of disabled people
teach far more to the Stanford commu
nity.
Longmore's classes aid the awareness
of disability issues across campus and
lend legitimacy to disability studies as a
discipline in history, sociology, commu
nication, political science, psychology,
art and literature.
• Longmore can provide expertise on
disability issues for on-campus service
organizations, student groups and
administrative bodies.
• Longmore is an asset to Stanford in
that he is recognized nationally as a dis
ability activist and authority on disabili
ty issues.
His long list of published articles and
interviews establishes him as an impor
tant source for the national media as
well as for his academic colleagues.
I strongly believe that the work Long
more has done for Stanford must be
continued by a disabled faculty member
— if not by Longmore himself.
