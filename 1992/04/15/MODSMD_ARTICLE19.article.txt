## Julie Makinen Stanford should not have let 'Nightline' play the name game

STANFORD SHOULD KNOW bet
ter. After last year's "20/20" feature
on Stanford's indirect-cost contro
versy — an utter publicity nightmare by
any measure — one would think that
Stanford would be a little wary of letting
ABC cameras get within a 100-mile
radius of campus.
But apparently, all it takes is a phone
call from alumnus Ted Koppel, and SHAZ
AM! — the campus is overrun with trac
tor-trailers, work crews, spotlights and
security guards.
Students busted their butts to accom
modate these people. And what did we get
out of it?
We got used.

Last Friday's "Nightline," broadcast
"live from Dinkelspiel Auditorium at Stan
ford University" was touted as a town
meeting, a forum in which regular people
— including people from Stanford —would
have a chance to express their opinions and
ask questions. Sounds like a good concept.
But what actually happened was an
entirely different matter.
Stanford's name, apparently now
respected by ABC, was used to give a shad
ow of credibility to a show which increas
ingly looks more like "Geraldo" than any
thing worthy of intelligent people's atten
tion. Members of the Stanford community
recognized this last year, when ABC's
"20/20" episode "Your tax dollars at work"

victimized Stanford by dubiously high
lighting expensive shower curtains and
yachts charged to the government.
Funny how things change, isn't it? A
year ago, ABC was willing to drag our name
through the mud and run us through the
ringer. Now, through a strange twist of
events, ABC is trying to portray Stanford as
a credible place, worthy of viewer attention.
In a time when Stanford is trying to dig
itself out of a credibility sinkhole, lending
our name to this sensationalist show was
like throwing away our shovel.
Red lights should have gone on in Uni
versity officials' heads when senior White
House officials refused to participate in
the program, saying they disagreed with

the show's premise. The episode, entitled
"A Process Run Amok — Can It be
Fixed?" focused on middle America's
increasing discontent with the process of
electing a president.
In the end, "Nightline" could only
entice former California Gov. Jerry Brown,
former presidential candidate Jesse Jack
son and television commentator Pat
Buchanan to appear on the program, and
not even in person.
What was broadcast from Dinkelspiel
was not a town meeting. It was a posed
question and answer session, dominated
by speakers who have consistent access to
the media. Show me a town where a good
representation of citizens includes a for-

mer presidential advisor, a correspondent
to the Financial Times and an economist
and I'll show you TV fantasy land.
Granted, there was the token homeless
person. But no Stanford faculty, staff or
undergraduates got a word in. All the
crowd could do to express its frustration
was to boo and hiss. Meanwhile, Brown,
Buchanan and Jackson ate up airtime like
there was no tomorrow.
Ultimately, "Nightline" succeeded in
alienating the "middle Americans"
crowds from the media in much the same
way Washington politicians have succeed
ed in isolating them from government.
This type of irony does not merit Stan
ford University's stamp of approval.
