# Trustees give OK to slimmer budget
## Budget accepted earlier than usual 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The year-long budget process
is not quite over, but the end is
definitely in sight.
The Board of Trustees
approved the 1992-93 operating
budget yesterday, giving its bless
ing to plans to resolve the Univer
sity's $43 million deficit.
"The budget was accepted as
proposed," said Interim Provost
Gerald Lieberman, who officially
begins his new position today.
The approval of the budget
also brought a sigh of relief from
former Provost James Rosse,
who left after the meeting for
Southern California and his new
position at Freedom Newspapers,
Inc.
Yesterday's decision by the
trustees was the first time they
have accepted the operating bud
get at their April meeting in the
last three years.
Last year's budget was held up
because of the indirect-cost con
troversy, when it was unclear
what the University's cost-recov
ery rate would be.
Lieberman said uncertainty
still exists, particularly in the
area of future indirect-cost rates
and the University's relationship
with the government, but added
that it is important that budget
planners can at least have some
picture of the future.
"The intent is to [approve the
budget] at this meeting. It is a
sign that times are more normal,"
Lieberman said.
"Now we are in a position
where we can think instead of just
put out fires."
Several budget-related issues
remain unresolved and will not be
handled by the trustees until
their June meeting, including

tion where we can

put out fires.'

plans to charge a so-called tax on
restricted gifts. The tax would
cover the indirect costs associated
with a donation.
For instance, electricity and
maintenance expenses associated
with donated buildings have
sometimes exceeded the cost of
the building itself.
A tax charged on donations
would add funding to the operat
ing budget to cover these indirect
costs.
The Board will also wait until
its next meeting to allocate any
additional reserves to cover
future deficits.
Last year the trustees ear
marked $50 million to cover the
University's deficits as well as an
additional $50 million for Medical
School shortfalls.
Budget planners project
deficits of $38 million and $24
million for the next two years,
and they predict that an addition
al $10-$l5 million annual short
fall will remain after 1993-94.
Ways of resolving the future
deficits are currently being stud
ied by the Trustees Task Force on
Financial Policy, which is expect
ed to make a report at the June
board meeting.
The trustees have expressed a
commitment to avoid making fur
ther academic cuts to the Univer
sity, and it is likely the committee
is studying ways to increase rev
enue.
