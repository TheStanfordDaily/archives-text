## Netters look good in romp over Utes 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior Staff Writer 
Yesterday afternoon, the No.
1-ranked men's tennis team chal
lenged Utah — an opponent of
the same caliber as their last
three. And, as with their last
three opponents, the Cardinal
men crushed the competition, 7-
2.
Michael Flanagan took Utah's
biggest hitter, Lindsry Raw
storne, to three sets at first sin
gles but could not pull out the
win.
However, head coach Dick
Gould was pleased. "He looked a
lot better than he did on Satur
day (against Arizona State) — he
was serving very well, volleying
better and sustaining his level of
play."
At second singles, Vimal Patel
squeaked out a 7-6 win in the
first set by pounding ball after
ball before taking some pace off
his shots and rolling to a 6-0 sec
ond set victory.
Chris Cocotos and Robert
Devens also had tough first sets
before gaining control and cruis
ing to easy straight set wins.
In the third slot, Cocotos faced
a big kick-server but pulled out a
7-5, 6-2 victory by picking his
shots well and playing smart ten
nis, according to Gould.
Devens also had a tough time
with his opponent's serve, but
like Cocotos he pulled out a win,
7-6, 6-2.
"Things went like clockwork
once I got into rhythm in the sec
ond set," he said.
Jason Yee won 6-2, 7-5 at the

fifth spot, while Billy Wright
dropped his match by an identical
score.
"He started well and I missed
balls," Wright said. "But then he
got tighter, and I just didn't capi
talize on big points."
Cardinal doubles looked sharp
as all three teams cruised to
straight set victories. In the top
slot, Cocotos and Alex O'Brien
dealt with the huge strokes of
Rawstorne and prevailed, 7-6,6-3.
"They were good — [Raw
storne] had a mammoth fore
hand," Cocotos said.
Yee and Patel trounced their
foes 6-3, 6-4.
"They play better and better
doubles every day," Gould said.
"Jason is just an outstanding
doubles player."
Devens and Flanagan looked
much sharper than they have in
recent matches, said Gould.
Their solid shots led them to a 6-
2, 6-4 win.
"I was concentrating on a few
things like deeper ground
strokes," Devens said. "I want to
be doing my best for this week
end."
This weekend marks the Car
dinal's second pair of matches
with the Southern California
giants. Cocotos also felt that
yesterday's match was a good
preparation for USC and
UCLA.
"Utah is pretty good, but
they're not a powerhouse team,"
he said. "This was a good match
to play before going to L.A.
because the players tested you
and made you play solid tennis. It
was a good warm up."
