# Ceman improving in all facets
## 
### Laurie Wackier Staff writer 
Last year, Canyon Ceman
established himself as a great set
ter. A true freshman, he battled
for and won a spot in the starting
lineup of the Cardinal roster. In
1991, he tallied 1192 assists, the
second best for a single season in
Cardinal history. In addition, he
set a new school record for assists
in a single match, recording 106
against USC.
This year, Ceman has estab
lished himself as a great volley
ball player. The 6-foot-4 native of
Manhattan Beach still chalks up
the stats as a setter: heading into

postseason play, he's already col
lected 1238 assists, including a
record setting 114-assist perfor
mance at UCLA. But more impor
tantly, Ceman has added some
other vital dimensions to his
game.
"Last year, Canyon knew he
had weaknesses, and he struggled
with it," explained coach Ruben
Nieves. "This year he has
improved on those weaknesses,
and continues to improve. The
setting is something he's got a
gift for, but he's become a better
digger, a better server, a better
blocker, and is more consistent in
his daily practice."
He is just beginning to realize

the rewards for his consistency.
With a 20-3 record, Ceman and
his teammates open the Western
Intercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion tournament today at noon.
Last season, with a 8-13 mark,
the Cardinal just read about the
tournament.
According to Ceman, a year of
experience, including a summer
with the U.S. National team, has
given him the confidence he need
ed to boost his play to a higher
level. That confidence is crucial to
a setter, who dictates the offense
with minimal input from the
bench.
"Last year, I was supposed to
take control of the offense and
take control of the team, but it
was a big problem as a frosh,"
Ceman remembered. "This year
though, I can take more control
of the team. I've started to
understand how I can best set up
my hitters for the hits they
want. I've gotten a deeper under
standing of offensive strategies,
and that has been a big improve
ment. Now I feel like I can do
this job as a setter as well as any
one.
That attitude has allowed him
to focus on the other aspects of
his game and become a complete
player. Nieves cited last Friday's
match against sixth-ranked
Santa Barbara as an example of
Ceman's development.
"He recovered two blocked
balls in that match," Nieves said.
"Those are plays you didn't see
him make last year, and that dif
ference could make the difference
in a match."
But the personal accomplish
ments are secondary for Ceman,
who attributes this season's suc
cess to team chemistry.
"What's allowed us to come
together is that we're all doing
stuff that complements each
other. "Those complementary
skills are really allowing us to
play well, as individuals, but also
as a team."
"Duncan (Blackman), (Ryan)
Moos and Bob (Hillman) are all
passing well," he continued.
"That allows me to make the
hitters look good. But at the
same time, they make me look
good, by hitting everything that
I set."
The spikers begin their quest
for a berth to NCAA Final Four
when they take on Hawaii (13-14)
today at noon at Irvine's Bren
Events Center. Stanford has
beaten the Rainbows twice this
season, in back-to-back matches
in Honolulu.
The winner of the match will
advance to the WIVA semifinals,
to be played Friday. The WIVA
championship match, Saturday
at 7:30 p.m., will determine the
West Coast's nomination for the
NCAA at-large berth to the Final
Four.

and that has been a big improve
ment. Now I feel like I can do
this job as a setter as well as any
one.
That attitude has allowed him
to focus on the other aspects of
his game and become a complete
player. Nieves cited last Friday's
match against sixth-ranked
Santa Barbara as an example of
Ceman's development.
"He recovered two blocked
balls in that match," Nieves said.
"Those are plays you didn't see
him make last year, and that dif
ference could make the difference
in a match."
But the personal accomplish
ments are secondary for Ceman,
who attributes this season's suc
cess to team chemistry.
"What's allowed us to come
together is that we're all doing
stuff that complements each
other. "Those complementary
skills are really allowing us to
play well, as individuals, but also
as a team."
"Duncan (Blackman), (Ryan)
Moos and Bob (Hillman) are all
passing well," he continued.
"That allows me to make the
hitters look good. But at the
same time, they make me look
good, by hitting everything that
I set."
The spikers begin their quest
for a berth to NCAA Final Four
when they take on Hawaii (13-14)
today at noon at Irvine's Bren
Events Center. Stanford has
beaten the Rainbows twice this
season, in back-to-back matches
in Honolulu.
The winner of the match will
advance to the WIVA semifinals,
to be played Friday. The WIVA
championship match, Saturday
at 7:30 p.m., will determine the
West Coast's nomination for the
NCAA at-large berth to the Final
Four.


Canyon Ceman sets for one of his 1,238 assists this season.
Ceman will be running the offense as the No. 2 Cardinal competes
in the WIVA post-season tournament, which runs from today until
Saturday.
