Wham, bam, thank you USF.
Yesterday, the Stanford baseball
team led off its game with the Uni
versity of San Francisco Dons
with two consecutive home runs,
and went on to win the game 10-2.
"[Jeffrey] Hammonds and
[Steve] Solomon hit back to back
homers, and we just kept rollin'
from there," freshman Dusty
Allen said.
The junior center fielder Ham
monds is currently on a hitting
barrage. The Ail-American led off
the game with a home run, his
third in as many games, and
ended up going 4-4 on the day.
After Hammonds' lead-off long
ball, senior right fielder Steve
Solomon followed with a homer of
his own. Solomon would later hit a
double and ended up scoring two
runs.
And the hitting didn't stop

there. Mark Skeels went 3-4 with
two RBI and yet another walk.
Freshman shortstop Jed Hansen
was 2-3. Chris Kemper went 2-4.
John Lynch hit his fourth home
run. On the game, Cardinal bat
ters went 17-39 for a team .436
average.
From the mound, Stanford had
only a slightly less impressive
game. Brian Sackinsky started the
game in a pre-determined rotation.
In three innings, Sackinsky gave
up one run, but no walks, and
struck out three. Tim Moore, Matt
Marenghi and Aaron Dorlarque
followed with three, two and one
innings of relief, respectively. Sack
insky's record improved to 5-2.
