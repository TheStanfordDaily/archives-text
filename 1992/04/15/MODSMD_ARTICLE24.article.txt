The Stanford sailing team completed a spectacu
lar weekend by earning impressive victories in two
separate tournaments in Stanford's home territory
of Redwood City.
The Cardinal sailors began Saturday on a bright
note by sweeping all the races at the Northern Cali
fornia Team Race Eliminations, and they finished
strongly Sunday by easily winning the North Series.
At the Northern Team Eliminations, the three
boats representing Stanford went undefeated against
teams from California, Cal Poly and Sonoma State as
they compiled a record of six victories and no losses on
the day. According to coach Blake Middleton, it was
important for the Cardinal to perform well in this race.
"By finishing as one of the top three teams in this
event, it qualified our sailors for the Team Race
Pacific Coast Championships on May 1," he said.
Meanwhile, the sailing team also dominated their
opponents Sunday. While competing against eight
other schools in the North Series, Stanford captured
first place as they beat the second place California
squad by a substantial twenty-two point margin.
The Cardinal's convincing victory in the North
Series was fueled by some outstanding individual

performances from its team members: the four
Stanford boats placed a remarkable first, third, fifth,
and sixth out of a total field of 20 boats.
They were lead by skipper Matt Sanford and his
crew Kristen Sidell in the A division of the race, and
by skipper Charles Meade and crew Katherine Chen
in the B division. These two teams of sailors were the
top scorers of the regatta. In addition, skipper Jeremy
Mclntyre and crew Justin Pollard from the A division
teamed up with B division skipper Geoff McDonald
and his crew Britt Johnson for a third place finish.
"This year we basically had the most successful
string of North Series victories in the six years I've
been here", Middleton said. "We won all but one of
the North Series races this year, and that loss
came in a tie-breaker with Berkeley on their home
lake."
Despite the fact that the Stanford sailing team
has had a successful season up to this point, Middle
ton expressed uncertainty about how they will per
form at the competitive national championship
tournaments.
"This is one of the least experienced teams I've
coached, and in the next few weeks we will see how
we compare with the other top teams in the nation,"
he said. "Right now it's crunchtime."
