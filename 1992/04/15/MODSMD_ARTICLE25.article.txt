# Bring back free student tickets
## 
### 
Ilaud last week's gutsy athletic department deci
sion to return students to the premier 50-yard
line seats for football games, but deeper revi
sions are needed.
My proposal: allow students free admission to all
intercollegiate athletic events, with the exception of
football, which generates income for the rest of the
department.
It works at Duke, where students get in for free
and are revered as the most spirited college sports
fans in the country. It used to work at Stanford,
and I'd like to see it succeed again.
Unfortunately, the trend at Stanford the past
three years has been in exactly the opposite direc
tion. Until two years ago, students got in for free at
most athletic events (except football and men's bas
ketball) and always had the best seats in the house.
But after several years of gradual screw-tightening,
the athletic department this year charged for virtu
ally all varsity events, banned alcohol from athletic
facilities and sat student football fans inside the 30-
yard line.
In the spirit of the new athletic department glas
nost, I hope student ticket charges will be abol
ished. While raising an insignificant amount of
money, they seriously hamper student interest and
attendance at athletic events.
The fact of the matter is that many students are
already getting in for free. This year just three per
cent of the student body bought season tickets: 173
all-sport passes at $150 and 252 major-sport passes
at $100.
The remainder of the student fans either paid at
the door ($2 at most games), or, more likely, wig
gled in through a loophole:
•All varsity athletes get in for free.
•Anyone can borrow an athlete's pictureless ID
card and get in for free.
•No need to borrow. Students work the gates at
most events, so their friends can get in for free any
way.
•Season passes can be transferred to anyone. Again,
ID's are pictureless.
•All it takes is a Macintosh and laserwriter to make
your own season pass.
•Most athletic facilities have mesh fences, and
rarely enough security to prevent multiple pass use.

The $2 charge acts as a deterrent against the
casual fan who would like to come watch a class
mate play. The athletic department must remem
ber that Meyer Library, an attractive Friday night
option for many students, is still free cf charge.
According to the ticket office, student atten
dance has not been affected by the new ticket
prices, but I am incredulous.

At a recent home men's gymnastics meet, the
top-ranked Cardinal drew only 150 students. Base
ball crowds became noticeably quieter after the $2
charge was instituted. Soccer, volleyball and water
polo crowds have been muffled as well.
Men's basketball may be the best example. When
Togo's "bought" the student tickets to the final
four home games so that all students could attend
for free, attendance swelled significantly. Student
support helped the Cardinal sweep its final four
games and make the NCAA Tournament, which
brought the athletic department more money than
it will make off student ticket sales in many years.
Student support is critical at sporting events,
and the athletic department should make every
effort to fill empty seats with screaming students.
The income from student ticket sales isn't enough
to justify the dampening of student spirit.
The athletic department, like the university, is
under extreme financial pressure. In order to afford
low-revenue sports like water polo and wrestling
that are being cut at other schools, it has to make
money somewhere else. But that money should be
made through football, television and corporate and
alumni donations, not by nickel and diming the stu
dent body. Frankly, we're out of change.
