## Form of energy affects reaction 
### Liz Lempert Editorial staff 
As any Branner Hall resident assis
tant knows, a powerful outburst by a
single stressed-out freshman does not
equal the collective outpouring of angst
by an entire floor, even if the same
amount of total energy is expended.
Chemical reactions also differ in the
form of energy taken by their molecular
parts, according to a group of Stanford
chemists. By using lasers to control the
results of a chemical reaction, they
have debunked the common assump
tion that only the total sum of energy
determines the speed of a reaction.
Some forms of energy can make
atoms vibrate in ways that slow the
reaction down, while others speed the
reaction up, as shown by experiments
conducted by chemistry graduate stu
dent Robert Guettler and Chemistry
Prof. Richard Zare.
Guettler and Zare presented their
experiments at the national meeting of
the American Chemical Society in San
Francisco last week.
Also participating in the early stages
of the experiment was postdoctoral stu
dent Lynmarie Posey, now an assistant
professor at Vanderbilt University.
By tuning lasers to different fre

quencies, Guettler excited the atoms in
an electrically charged ammonia
molecule to vibrate in different pat
terns, or modes.
Ammonia is composed of one nitro
gen atom surrounded by three hydro
gen atoms. Normally, the hydrogen
atoms lie on an even plane with the
central nitrogen atom, at an equal dis
tance from it. But in different modes,
the distances between the atoms can
grow or shrink and the planar configu
ration can bend and curve.
In the breathing mode, ammonia's
three hydrogen atoms move in and out
from the nitrogen center, expanding
and contracting like a pair of lungs.
In the umbrella-bending mode, the
atoms flap up and down like an
umbrella that inverts on a windy day
and then pops back into shape.
The chemists compared two differ
ent reactions, combining charged
ammonia molecules with another form
of ammonia that has all its hydrogen
atoms replaced with deuterium, a
heavy type of hydrogen.
Normally, the collision of these two
molecules produces three different end
products, in roughly equal quantities.
One of these products is called proton
transfer, when a hydrogen proton
moves from the charged ammonia to

the deuterated ammonia.
In one reaction, the ammonia
molecules were tuned to vibrate only
in the umbrella-bending mode, while
in the other reaction, they vibrated in
both the umbrella-bending mode and
the breathing mode. In both reac
tions, the ammonia molecules were
prepared with the same total amount
of energy.
The experiments demonstrated that
the mixed-mode reaction was more
efficient — producing more end prod
ucts — than the umbrella-bending
mode alone.
Using both the breathing and
umbrella-bending modes together dou
bled the rate of proton transfer. Since
the other two end products were unaf
fected, there was an overall gain from
the reaction.
The difference in results remained
consistent even when the two types of
molecules were bombarded at each
other at progressively higher speeds.
Based on the experiments, the
chemists hypothesize that the umbrella
bending mode inhibits proton transfer.
While the findings have no immedi
ate practical application, chemists may
be able to design some reactions to take
advantage of the vibrating pattern of
molecules in the future.
