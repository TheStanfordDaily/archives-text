Exercise may be as crucial as diet
A low-fat diet without exercise may do more harm than good for
many Americans, especially women, according to recent studies by
a Stanford professor.
Diet and exercise may be especially important to people with low
high density lipoproteins (HDL, the "good" cholesterol) levels, since
there are no safe and effective drug treatments for raising HDL lev
els. Low density lipoproteins, LDL, are the "bad" cholesterol.
Peter Wood, a research professor at the Stanford Center for
Research in Disease Prevention, and his colleagues recently complet
ed a study which showed that when women tried to lose weight with
a low-fat diet without exercise, their ratio of good to bad cholesterol
was unchanged, even though they lowered their total cholesterol.
Women tended to reduce good cholesterol more quickly than bad
cholesterol if they dieted without also exercising.
The same result has not been seen in men, perhaps because of
sex differences in the effects of weight loss on HDL, which seem to
counterbalance the adverse effect of the diet on HDL.
When women started a moderate, regular exercise program along
with weight loss, they tended to improve their HDL/LDL ratio.
Wood and his group are continuing studies to measure the dif
ferences between dieting with and without exercise in terms of
cholesterol and heart disease risks.
Doctors have long advised patients to reduce the fat in their
diet and, to further reduce cardiac risk, to follow an exercise regi
men and lose weight as well.
Researchers explore group communication
Researchers at the Center for Integrated Facilities Engineering
are exploring how information-processing tools speed up or slow
down work, using the first computer program to analyze the per
formance of organizations.
The "Virtual Design Team" simulation program, built by Civil
Engineering Prof. Raymond Levitt and graduate student Geoff
Cohen, also can explore the effectiveness of various organization
al structures or management styles.
The project, which recently received a $500,000 grant from the
National Science Foundation, could point the way to more effi
cient process and better resulting designs.
Using artificial intelligence technology, the researchers first
modeled the tasks, technical experience and information-process
ing tools used by engineering teams that design oil refineries and
chemical processing plants.
These teams must share technical information and coordinate
their work in a timely manner to control costs. In their first test
of the model, they found that voice mail can shorten design pro
jections in such an organization.
The computer simulation model indicated that in decentralized
organizations, voice mail saved a substantial amount of time because
it alleviated the need to find the other person at his or her desk.
On the other hand, in very centralized organizations, where all
the decisions are made high up on the hierarchy, the computer
simulation indicated that voice mail would actually slow the oper
ation down because certain managers would receive more infor
mation that they could handle.
Managers have a harder time assigning priorities to messages
when they are on voice mail.
