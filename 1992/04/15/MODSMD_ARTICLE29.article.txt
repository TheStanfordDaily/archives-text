# Shed pounds on Everest
## Weight goes down as you go up, Bug says Science Bug

Q: Do you weigh more at sea level
than at the top of Mount Everest?
- "Tim"
A: In a word, yes. Since they wouldn't
pay me for just one word, however, I
will elaborate.
Decreasing elevation does indeed
increase weight, due to two factors which,
not surprisingly, both relate back to good
ol' Newtonian gravity.
Years of painstaking research conduct
ed a long time ago revealed that the force
of gravity obeys an "inverse-square" law
— i.e., the gravitational attraction
between two bodies of set masses (say,
Earth and a 137.2-kilogram ovarian cyst)
is inversely proportional to the square of
the distance between them.
Before we proceed, allow me to intro
duce a didactic example. Suppose you
measure the aforementioned tumor at one
distance from Earth's center, and observe
its weight to be 303 pounds. Now, take it
thrice as far away from the center of the
earth. Three squared is nine, so weighing
the cyst at this distance gives a figure nine
times smaller than the original — in this
case, about 37 pounds.
Smashing. Now, Tim, you may be con
cerned that my example, however thrilling
in itself, might have limited relevance to
the question at hand. After all, aren't you
just the same distance from Earth (name
ly, zero) standing on the peak of Everest
as you would be, say, at Half Moon Bay?
Au contrare, mon frere. A fairly
straightforward result from integral calcu
lus and the law of gravity tells us that the
gravitational force from a massive body
that is extended in space (like the Earth) is
the same as the force due to a zero-dimen
sional point with the same mass, sitting at
the extended body's center of mass.
Ergo, if you were on top of ol' Chomolung
ma (the noncolonialist, 100-percent Europe
free Tibetan name for Everest), you'd be 8.8
kilometers farther away from Earth, at least
as far as gravitation was concerned.
Since the earth's radius is right around
6370 kilometers, however, this is not a big
difference. After a grueling set of calcula
tions, I determined that your weight dif
ference between Half Moon Bay and
Chomolungma amounts to one part in ten
thousand — a genuine increase in sea level
vs. high-altitude weight, but not one that
you could experience without the assis
tance of instruments.
The second factor that contributes to
the increase in weight with altitude
involves the atmosphere: Wherever you
are on earth, a tall column of air is sitting
on top of you. As you increase your alti

tude, the column gets shorter (and there
fore lighter).
Another didactic example will illustrate
the significance of this fact: Suppose the
earth had no atmosphere, and that you
had come to terms with this alarming sit
uation and had nothing better to do than
sit around at sea level calibrating a scale.
Your scale has a flat, upward-facing sur
face area one foot square, and it is cali
brated to register "zero."
Now, suppose that the atmosphere is
miraculously restored to our planet. The
scale will register a positive value (in
Earth's case, 14.7 pounds at sea level.)
The scale would be measuring the weight
of a column of air standing on the earth's
surface, one foot square in cross-section
and more or less infinitely tall.
If you were to take this selfsame scale
to the top of Everest, the column of air
above the scale would be missing a piece,
namely, the one that stretches from sea
level to 8.8 km elevation. Because air gets
more and more rarefied as you rise above
Earth's surface this will make a big differ
ence in the weight of the air column.
So even though our imaginary column
was infinitely tall, the piece we cut out of
it by climbing 8.8 km contained roughly
two-thirds of its mass. Our scale will now
read 9.3 pounds — a decrease in weight of
about five pounds.
Tim, I'll make the assumption that your
upward-facing surface area, like that of most
ordinary human beings, is right around one
square foot. Thus, if you had weighed your
self at sea level and then at 8.8 km elevation
on this scale, you would have observed the
same decrease in your own weight.
Once you returned to the coast, howev
er, your weight would return to whatever
normal is for you. After all, what goes
down, must come up.
