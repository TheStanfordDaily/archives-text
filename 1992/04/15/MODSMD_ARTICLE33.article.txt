# The 						future of Brazil?
## Conference explores political, economic, social woes 
### John Ford Staff writer 
The need to reorganize the
Brazilian state, reform the
nation's tax system and increase
the government's role in alleviat
ing economic inequality emerged
as consensus views during a con
ference on Brazil held at Stanford
Monday and Tuesday.
The conference, "Brazil
Today," used speeches and discus
sion to focus attention on many of
Brazil's political, economic and
social problems.
Speaking at the event were two
Brazilian senators, the Consul
General of Brazil's San Francisco
consulate, and prominent faculty
members from Stanford and the
University of Sao Paulo in Brazil.
About 90 people attended yester
day's portion of the conference.
Brazilian Senator Fernando
Henrique Cardoso said Stanford
was an appropriate location for the
conference because of its tradition

of interest in Latin America. He
noted, however, that Stanford had
a larger group of scholars studying
Brazil during his stay here as a vis
iting professor in 1971.
Cardoso, who recently turned
down an offer to become Brazil's
minister of foreign affairs, said
the conference gave participants a
good chance to speak frankly
about the country's problems in a
"friendship environment."
A number of participants
spoke in Portuguese, and ear
phones were provided for those
few who needed translation.
Assoc. Political Science Prof.
Terry Karl said it was rare to see a
"forum of this quality" brought
together, especially during a time
of reduced spending.
Scott Porter, a sophomore Span
ish major, said the event had an
"impressive level of distinguished
visitors." However, Porter said he
thought "the experts wouldn't get a
whole lot out of it" because of the
broad nature of the discussions.

According to Karl, the forum
was made possible through popu
lar Brazilian actress and con
sulate member Ruth Escobar, the
Center for Latin American Stud
ies, and VASP, a Brazilian airline
which paid for the guest's air fare.
Karl, Cardoso and Political Sci
ence Prof. Robert Packenham said
the conference was important
because of Brazil's transition to
democracy and its increased par
ticipation in the world economy.
Latin America is a neglected
region because its problems "don't
make good television sound bites,"
Packenham said.
"People don't have the slight
est idea of what's going on in
Brazil," said Brazilian native and
Menlo Park resident Luiza Hadba.
Karl said she hoped the event
would improve teaching at Stan
ford. According to Karl, the faculty
wanted to use the the event as an
opportunity to "listen and learn"
and bring some of the issues dis
cussed back to their own work.
