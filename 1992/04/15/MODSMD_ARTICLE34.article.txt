Violence mars Rains party
The festivities quickly turned sour at a Rains
House party Friday night.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer, Fremont resident William Eric
Ramirez, 21, was charged with felony assault
after striking a graduate student in the face with
a glass beer bottle.
The confrontation occurred around 11 p.m. A
comment made by the lead singer of a hired band
sparked the alleged conflict between Ramirez and
the graduate student.
"The lead singer made an uncool comment
about an Asian couple," Niemeyer said. "His
behavior angered the grad student."
The graduate student proceeded to give the
lead singer the "international salute," Niemeyer
said.
Confronted by Ramirez, one of the band's
"groupies," he was verbally assaulted before
being hit in the face with the beer bottle, accord
ing to Niemeyer.
The wound required 11 stitches. Ramirez was

identified and arrested later that night.
