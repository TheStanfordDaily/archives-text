## Trustees support plan that holds companies accountable 
### Anush Yegyazarian Staff writer 
Stanford's Board of Trustees has
thrown its support behind three share
holder resolutions that demand greater
accountability from corporations on
their marketing practices and environ
mental policies.
The Special Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility, which advises the
Board, voted unanimously Monday to
support the resolutions, which were
proposed by other shareholders in the
affected corporations, according to Bar
bara Benjamin-Trevino, associate
director of University relations.
The committee also discussed the
proposal for a University tobacco invest
ment policy but reached no conclusion
and postponed its final decision until
June, she said.
Tobacco investment has been under
review by Stanford for more than a
year. Harvard and Johns Hopkins Uni
versities have both divested from the

tobacco industry in the past two years.
One of the approved resolutions
requires Union Pacific corporation to
document its environmental procedures.
The other resolutions concern advertis
ing practices at Phillip Morris, a multi
million dollar corporation in which Stan
ford has invested about $30 million.
The decisions of the investment com
mittee, which was created in 1977 to
handle investment responsibility policies
on behalf of the trustees, stand final and
do not require trustee ratification unless
extenuating circumstances arise.
The first Phillip Morris resolution
urges the corporation — which manufac
tures Miller beer, Jell-o gelatin, Oscar
Mayer meat products, Marlboros and Vir
ginia Slims cigarettes, among other prod
ucts — to investigate and report on the
effects of their advertising campaigns on
tobacco purchases by minors and women.
The proposal calls into question the
ethics involved in certain marketing
practices that appeal to young people
and may entice them to smoke.

This resolution also calls for the cor
poration to document its compliance
with the Tobacco Code, a set of volun
tary guidelines regulating the tobacco
industry.
The second Phillip Morris resolution
addresses the marketing of Miller beer,
demanding that the corporation report
on its advertising practices that could
attract and influence the underage
market.
The Union Pacific resolution demands
that the corporation report on its compli
ance with the Valdez resolutions, a code of
practices designed to promote corporate
environmental responsibility.
Stanford's tobacco policy proposal,
which has not yet been approved, relates
to the Phillip Morris resolution, but
would affect two other tobacco compa
nies in which Stanford invests as well.
The policy — which is supported by
the Advisory Panel on Investment
Responsibility, an advisory group for
