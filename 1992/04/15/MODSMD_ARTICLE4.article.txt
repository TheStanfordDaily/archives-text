## Trustees support plan that holds companies accountable 
### Anush Yegyazarian Staff writer 
Stanford's Board of Trustees has
thrown its support behind three share
holder resolutions that demand greater
accountability from corporations on
their marketing practices and environ
mental policies.
The Special Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility, which advises the
Board, voted unanimously Monday to
support the resolutions, which were
proposed by other shareholders in the
affected corporations, according to Bar
bara Benjamin-Trevino, associate
director of University relations.
The committee also discussed the
proposal for a University tobacco invest
ment policy but reached no conclusion
and postponed its final decision until
June, she said.
Tobacco investment has been under
review by Stanford for more than a
year. Harvard and Johns Hopkins Uni
versities have both divested from the

tobacco industry in the past two years.
One of the approved resolutions
requires Union Pacific corporation to
document its environmental procedures.
The other resolutions concern advertis
ing practices at Phillip Morris, a multi
million dollar corporation in which Stan
ford has invested about $30 million.
The decisions of the investment com
mittee, which was created in 1977 to
handle investment responsibility policies
on behalf of the trustees, stand final and
do not require trustee ratification unless
extenuating circumstances arise.
The first Phillip Morris resolution
urges the corporation — which manufac
tures Miller beer, Jell-o gelatin, Oscar
Mayer meat products, Marlboros and Vir
ginia Slims cigarettes, among other prod
ucts — to investigate and report on the
effects of their advertising campaigns on
tobacco purchases by minors and women.
The proposal calls into question the
ethics involved in certain marketing
practices that appeal to young people
and may entice them to smoke.

This resolution also calls for the cor
poration to document its compliance
with the Tobacco Code, a set of volun
tary guidelines regulating the tobacco
industry.
The second Phillip Morris resolution
addresses the marketing of Miller beer,
demanding that the corporation report
on its advertising practices that could
attract and influence the underage
market.
The Union Pacific resolution demands
that the corporation report on its compli
ance with the Valdez resolutions, a code of
practices designed to promote corporate
environmental responsibility.
Stanford's tobacco policy proposal,
which has not yet been approved, relates
to the Phillip Morris resolution, but
would affect two other tobacco compa
nies in which Stanford invests as well.
The policy — which is supported by
the Advisory Panel on Investment
Responsibility, an advisory group for
the Special Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility — calls for
Stanford to take certain measures
to influence corporate behavior.
Tenets of the policy include
urging companies to:
• stop targeting specific groups
through advertising;
• place warning labels on
cigarettes sold overseas that are
equivalent to the labels placed on
those sold here;
• restrict placement of vending
machines so they are not accessi
ble to minors;
• lobby for legislation that
would make cigarette sales to
minors illegal in all states;
• refrain from advertising at
sporting events and in sporting

magazines; and
• begin an advertising cam
paign to warn of the dangers of
smoking.
According to Benjamin-Trevino,
committee members supported the
policy proposal, but did not feel
they had sufficient time to discuss
the issues and take a final vote.
"The members are in agree
ment with the plan," she said, "but
some of them are wondering if the
proposal doesn't go far enough."
The proposal calls for Stanford
to consider divestment if the cor
porations fail to comply with these
demands.
Though no formal decision was
made on the proposal, the commit
tee held an "informal conversa
tion" with the Board on the sub
ject, preceding the Board meeting
yesterday morning, according to
Diana Diamond, the advisory
panel's chair.
