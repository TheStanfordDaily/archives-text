# Gay student in random house draw is rebuffed
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
Hammarsjkold House residents met last night
to discuss issues raised by a student's refusal to
live with a gay student assigned to his room.
Senior Owen Maubane objected when junior
Barney Cheng, who is gay, was randomly assigned
to his room at the beginning of the quarter.
Maubane has since moved into another room in
Hammarsjkold, after a group of residents held a
second in-house draw to determine where Cheng
would live.
As a result of the new draw, Cheng lives in a
single.
Nearly everyone in the house attended the
meeting last night, which was moderated by Greg
Ricks, multicultural educator for the Office of
Residential Education, and John Pearson, director
of the Bechtel International Center.
Resident Assistant Sheila Hayre said last
night's discussion went smoothly. "There was
some anger, but there was also some understand
ing by those who expressed anger," she said.
Cheng said the decision to allow Maubane to
move was not "right at all," but added, "I'm glad,
too, because I don't want to end up with a homo
phobic roommate. It was the most practical thing
to do."
Maubane said he is sorry that he hurt Cheng,
but added that "there are religious and cultural
reasons that it became problematic for me that he
is gay."
He said his background "reinforced the reli
gious aspect," and added that he had "been
brought up to believe that it is wrong to be gay."
In a letter he submitted to The Daily, Cheng
objected to the use of religion "as a disguise for
prejudice."
But Maubane said religion is not the only issue.
He said that while "gay people deserve and should
be given equal rights," he felt a distinction should
be made between that judgement, which is a pub
lic issue, and his personal rights.
