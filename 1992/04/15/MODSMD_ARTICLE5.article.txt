# Gay student in random house draw is rebuffed
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Staff writer 
Hammarsjkold House residents met last night
to discuss issues raised by a student's refusal to
live with a gay student assigned to his room.
Senior Owen Maubane objected when junior
Barney Cheng, who is gay, was randomly assigned
to his room at the beginning of the quarter.
Maubane has since moved into another room in
Hammarsjkold, after a group of residents held a
second in-house draw to determine where Cheng
would live.
As a result of the new draw, Cheng lives in a
single.
Nearly everyone in the house attended the
meeting last night, which was moderated by Greg
Ricks, multicultural educator for the Office of
Residential Education, and John Pearson, director
of the Bechtel International Center.
Resident Assistant Sheila Hayre said last
night's discussion went smoothly. "There was
some anger, but there was also some understand
ing by those who expressed anger," she said.
Cheng said the decision to allow Maubane to
move was not "right at all," but added, "I'm glad,
too, because I don't want to end up with a homo
phobic roommate. It was the most practical thing
to do."
Maubane said he is sorry that he hurt Cheng,
but added that "there are religious and cultural
reasons that it became problematic for me that he
is gay."
He said his background "reinforced the reli
gious aspect," and added that he had "been
brought up to believe that it is wrong to be gay."
In a letter he submitted to The Daily, Cheng
objected to the use of religion "as a disguise for
prejudice."
But Maubane said religion is not the only issue.
He said that while "gay people deserve and should
be given equal rights," he felt a distinction should
be made between that judgement, which is a pub
lic issue, and his personal rights.
"I'm not trying to make a value
judgement or impose a moral
standard," he said, but noted that
"there is a difference between
public realm and our own private
space."
Cheng wrote in his letter that
Maubane's decision to move out
of his room "suggests that homo
phobic discrimination, unlike
racial discrimination, is justifi
able." He wrote that "if this inci
dent were racial discrimination, it
would not have been tolerated on
this campus."
Maubane, who is black, said
that if someone did not want to
room with him because of his
race, he would "personally be
very upset." But, he said, "I
would not try to force that person
to live with me."
According to Alice Supton,
associate director of Res Ed, a

decision to move a resident is
made within the house itself. Res
Ed does not usually interfere.
"Anyone can live with anyone
they want," Ricks said. "It's up to
[the student]," he said, but the
office would not help that student
find another room.
Only if a student felt his or her
rights were violated because the
roommate moved out or "if it's a
violation of the Fundamental
Standard" will Res Ed deal with
the case, Ricks said.
But though the house may
decide on its own that a resident
can move because of these prob
lems, "the house itself cannot dis
criminate," Ricks added. "The
house is part of the University.
Freedom doesn't go that far."
Ricks said he was asked by
Hammarsjkold residents to speak
at last night's meeting, but that
he came "strictly as an educator,
not as an administrator." He said
his goal is to help the students
resolve the issue themselves,
rather than to direct the situation

for them.
There was "some nervous
ness" among residents when the
issue was first raised within the
house, Hammarsjkold House
Manager Patrick Peterson said.
However, he added that "no fac
tions or camps" have developed.
When Cheng returned to Stan
ford from the Oxford overseas
program at the beginning of the
quarter, he was randomly
assigned to a room in Ham
marsjkold with Maubane, one of
four residents who were living
alone in doubles.
According to Cheng, a few days
after he moved in, Maubane
approached Hayre and told her
that he wanted to move out
because he was uncomfortable
with Cheng's homosexuality.
Cheng said Maubane had not
talked to him about the problem
before asking for the change.
Cheng, Hayre, Peterson and
the four residents decided the
most practical solution was to
have a second draw.
