# Getting the message out
## COP hopefuls lay extensive paper trail Voting is today and tomorrow 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
With final rounds of distributing fliers
and talking to students, the slates run
ning for Council of Presidents wound
down their campaigning yesterday.
The campaign method of choice appeared
to be the same as in past years: papering the
campus with election material.
Joel Stein, a member of the Students
First slate, said his slate has posted some
fliers, especially in bathroom stalls.
And as a final campaign measure, Stein
said, the slate would be slipping flyers
including the slate's platform and polling
information under the door of every
undergraduate room and in every gradu
ate student mailbox on campus.
Delia Lopez, a member of the "Indepen
dents: A New Era" slate, said her slate has
also been distributing fliers and large wood
en placards around campus and will be dis
tributing more campaign material tonight.

In addition to printed material, Lopez
said the slate has done extensive door-to
door campaigning, talking to students and
introducing the slate members.
David Hyatt, who is coordinating the
Hammer and Coffin party's "YOU!" slate,
said the slate has been taking part in "ran
dom, minimalist campaigning" and has not
actively participated in flier campaigns.
However, Hyatt said the slate — which
pledges to replace the members of the
COP on a daily basis with randomly
selected students — did not need exten
sive campaigning because the students
would be electing themselves.

"Who knows themselves better
than the students?" Hyatt asked.
Hyatt was originally a mem
ber of the YOU! slate, but hear
ings officer Jason Moore ruled
Hyatt ineligible to run because
he is not a registered student
this quarter.
Hyatt was replaced by fresh
man Aaron Baker, who worked on
the Hammer and Coffin society's

Chaparral humor magazine dur
ing fall quarter and will be direc
tor of the ASSU Publications
Board next year.
Sherri Wolson, an Indepen
dents slate member, said that
although campaigning has been
hard work, she has found it very
rewarding. "It's been great work
ing together as a slate," she said.
Ed Mun, a member of the"I
Prefer Not to Have a COP" slate,
was slightly less enamored with
the campaign process. "Cam
paigning has been a huge pain in
the ass," he said.
