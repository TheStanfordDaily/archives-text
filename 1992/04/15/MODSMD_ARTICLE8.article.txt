# Rosse: University must avoid scandal to survive
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Stanford will be among an
ever-smaller number of leading
universities, Provost James
Rosse predicts, but that preem
inence will remain fragile. A
public-relations crisis that
could erode Stanford's leader
ship could arrive any day on
any of a dozen unexpected
fronts, Rosse believes.
"The feature of American
higher education has been that
a small number of institutions
have been the innovators and
the leaders in the academic
program," Rosse said. But "the
set of schools that can continue
to play in the 'big leagues/ so
to speak, has diminished over
time.... I think that's a pro
cess that will continue.
"I don't think the political
climate in this country is partic
ularly conducive" to higher edu
cation, he warned. "The kinds
of things that we went through
in the indirect-cost crisis will
arise from time to time."
The indirect-cost controver
sy, while impacting the Univer
sity's operating budget and
damaging its public image,
haven't threatened Stanford's

real priorities or compromised
its reputation for fundamental
strengths, Rosse said.
But the crisis drove home the
lesson that the University's rep
utation can take "one bell of a
beating" in a process over which
Stanford officials "have rela
tively little control,'' Rosse said.
He fears that a campus
scandal like a cheating ring or a
series of sexual assaults could
give Stanford the reputation of
an undesirable place to get an
education.
"If students tomorrow were
to believe that Stanford has
second-rate undergraduate
education, it would have a dev
astating impact," he said
"If we had a really full
blown athletics scandal, for
example, it would have a dWas
tating impact on our capacity
to attract donors, faculty and
students. .. . Those are the
kinds of things that could have
really serious consequences."
Managing a university's
reputation is one of the tough
est challenges officials face,
Rosse said. He conceded that
"even an institution like Stan
ford can't consistently manage
its public affairs. It just can't
be done."
