# Unhoused frat makes third plea for housing
## AEPi's ask to take over existing house 
### Sally Shuper 
For the third time in five years,
members of the Alpha Epsilon Pi
fraternity are asking University
officials to grant them on-campus
housing.
The fraternity last week sub
mitted a proposal to receive hous
ing to a number of University
administrators, as well as to
Interfraternity Council President
Steve Jarrett.
Dean of Students Michael Jack
son received the fraternity's pro
posal Thursday and said he hopes
to offer an answer directly to the
AEPi's within the next few weeks.
"I believe it's only fair to
address the AEPi's themselves
before making any public state
ment," Jackson said.
Current University policy
states that no new housing will be
granted to fraternities, according
to Heather Dunn, fraternal
affairs adviser.
The two previously denied pro
posals involved plans to construct
a new fraternity house on cam
pus, funded by the national office
of Alpha Epsilon Pi, according to
fraternity President Scott Kupor.
This time, however, the 30-
member unhoused fraternity
hopes to occupy any existing Greek
housing that becomes available.
"We have no particular fraternity

in mind right now," Kupor added.
One way the AEPi's could get
on-campus housing is if one of the
currently housed fraternities does
not succeed in fulfilling its quota
of members, as stipulated by Uni
versity guidelines.
"As far as I know, all houses
are having a strong Rush," said
Jarrett, adding that in light of the
University policy, fraternities
"are doing a lot to make sure they
meet their quotas."
The central motivation behind
the AEPi's action has to do with
"basic logistical things," Kupor said.
"Finding places to hold events isn't
always the easiest thing to do."
Kupor said he feels that as a
Jewish fraternity, the AEPi's "have
a lot to offer the University" and
can "bridge the gap of understand
ing" between the Jewish communi
ty and other ethnic groups.
In addition, the AEPi's simply
want to live together, "much like
non-Greek students who have the
option of drawing together in
groups of eight," said senior Jon
Rosenwasser, a fraternity member.
Plans are currently being made
for a meeting of all interested par
ties to assess the AEPi's future.
"We hope that the University at
least acts on it," Rosenwasser said.
"We would like at least an ini
tial response by the end of the
week."
