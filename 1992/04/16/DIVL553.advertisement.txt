We've given
biotechnology an
interesting new
twist.
Our recombinant DNA technology has yielded
products that help people combat a variety of
serious medical conditions. With four FDA
approved products and many more in clinical
trials, we've proven our long-term commitment to
advances in biotechnology.
To continue this, we invest 40% of our annual
revenues in research and development which
enables us to concentrate on new projects every
year. This has resulted in the on-going expansion
of our research facilities. Our most important
investment, however, is in our people. We find the
best possible people for every area of our organi
zation — people who share our commitment to
changing the shape of the biotechnology industry.
Shape your career.
If you have a degree in the life sciences, write to
us about our exciting entry-level opportunities at
Genentech, Inc., Human Resources BF/CP, 460
Point San Bruno Blvd., South San Francisco, CA
94080. We actively support and promote affirma
tive action and equal employment opportunity.
