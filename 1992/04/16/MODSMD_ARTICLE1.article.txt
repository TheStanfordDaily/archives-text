# Campbell reprimanded following 'racist' remarks
## 
### Liz Lempert Editorial staff 
Hoover Director John Raisian has
strongly reprimanded former Director W.
Glenn Campbell for racist remarks he
allegedly made to a visiting scholar at a
private dinner in February.
In a confidential memo sent to visiting
scholar Srdjan Trifkovic yesterday,
Raisian wrote that he would not tolerate
a repetition of Campbell's behavior, and
if there was one, harsher disciplinary
sanctions would be imposed. Neither
Raisian nor Campbell would comment on
the specifics of the incident or censure.
At a dinner in honor of Japanese Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, Campbell
allegedly told Trifkovic, a Serbian histori
an, "It was too bad if the Croats killed
Jews, but they should have exterminated
the Serbs, so that they would have no
trouble with them today."

According to Trifkovic, when Camp
bell was asked what he meant by this
statement, he answered, "all Serbs were
Nazis anyway." Campbell also allegedly
said Serbs were inferior to Croats.
In his own letter to Raisian, Campbell
called Trifkovic's charges M a collection of
vicious, distorted, imagined and incorrect
allegations not worthy of any detailed
comment."
Trifkovic came forward with details of
the incident yesterday, saying Raisian's
reprimand of his predecessor was "not
enough with the magnitude of Camp
bell's transgressions."
Trifkovic said Raisian told him that
Campbell would be banned from all
Hoover social functions to which outside
guests are invited.
In a series of memos to Raisian after
the incident, Trifkovic demanded that
Campbell resign or be fired from his cur
rent position as counselor, or make a

"substantial contribution" to a fund for
Serbian refugees.
In the confidential memo, Raisian said
a witness at the dinner corroborated
Trifkovic's account of one of the sets of
remarks and concluded that Campbell did
in fact make the other remarks.
The "substance of the allegations [is]
true," Raisian wrote.
An "official apology" from the Hoover
Institution was given to Trifkovic. "I have
also informed Dr. Campbell that I will not
allow Hoover's reputation to be tar
nished" by "racist" remarks at a Univer
sity event, Raisian wrote.
"It's a source of regret to me if
Hoover's reputation were to be blighted
by this man who could be nicknamed the
Hitler of the Tower," Trifkovic said.
At a cocktail hour preceding the din
ner, Trifkovic said he spotted Campbell
wearing a Hoover tie, and the two chatted
about the think tank. Campbell asked

Trifkovic where he originally came from,
and when Trifkovic replied Belgrade,
Campbell said, "Ah, a Serb! Are you mar-

ried to a Croat?"
According to
Trifkovic, when he
answered that he
was, Campbell
added with a grin,
"Well, that means
that you married
way above your sta
tion. . . the Serbs,
of course, are cul
turally, and in
every other way,
inferior to the

Croats." Trifkovic, a journalist as well as
a historian, said he inadvertently record
ed Campbell's remarks on tape. He had
carried a tape machine to record speeches
made by Nakasone and former Secretary
of State George Shultz.

Campbell criticized Trifkovic's use of
the recorder at the event.
"This fellow — I think he's just trying

to get himself out of
a box," Campbell
said. "He's made all
these charges, and
he won't release the
tapes. That's scur
rilous journalism."
Campbell con
tinued, "My lawyer
told me — and let
me point out he's a
good lawyer, not a
Stanford lawyer —
even if you said

those things, do-esn't he believe in free
speech? He spent such a long time in a
totalitarian country that he automatically
tapes everything."


Campbell


Raisian
Since Raisian stopped short of
firing Campbell, Trifkovic said he
is considering leaving before his
one-year appointment at Hoover
expires in June.
"My work has suffered,"
Trifkovic said. "Unlike my first
six months here, it's now better to
be away than be here."
"It seems impossible for me to
remain under the same roof with
Mr. Campbell even for a short
period of time," Trifkovic wrote in
his first memo to Raisian. "It
would be tantamount to expecting
a Jew to cooperate with an inveter
ate Nazi apologist."
"There's really not much I can
say," said Raisian, when asked to
comment on the situation. "It's
strictly a personal matter," he said.
"An incident did occur between
Campbell and Trifkovic. And a
formal complaint was made to me
by Dr. Trifkovic. I took the matter
very seriously. I looked into it
very thoroughly and made a deci
sion that I thought was appropri
ate to the circumstances."
Campbell's run-in with Trifkovic
is certainly not the first time the
prickly Hoover counselor has
enshrouded himself in controversy.
His longstanding feud with two
outspoken liberals, Political Sci
ence Prof. John Manley and
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, was
as well known on campus as that
between the Hatfields and
McCoys.
By the time Campbell was
forced to step down from Hoover's
directorship to assume the title of
"counselor" in 1988, he had built
up an impressive list of antagonists
who were glad to see him go,
including University President
Donald Kennedy and Board of
Trustees President James Gaither.
Even some within Hoover had
grown tired of Campbell's tenden
cy to make outrageous statements.
But Campbell left an impres
sive legacy at the institution.
With his close ties to former
President Ronald Reagan and other

conservative power players, Camp
bell proved to be an astounding
fund raiser, leaving Hoover with a
budget of $15.7 million after his 30
years at the helm. He is widely cred
ited with building Hoover into an
influential think tank with strong
ties to policy makers.
The former director still carries
a lot of clout, and terminating him,
as Trifkovic demanded, would be a
sticky process.
Campbell has said in the past
that his agreement with the
Board of Trustees gives him the
title "counselor for life." Raisian
insisted that he's mistaken. "He's
used that term [counselor for life]
— he's counselor."
Although Campbell's contract

'It should be obvious
that... the best inter
ests of the institution
are not served by pre
tending that nothing
has happened.'
—Srdjan Trifkovic

was negotiated with the Board of
Trustees, Raisian has the ulti
mate authority to fire him.
Trifkovic said, "It would be truly
incredible if this man were to contin
ue" in his job. "I think he's had it.
"Who could he counsel? And
about what? The Ustasa regime
50 years ago — maybe. Hoover of
today — no."
Trifkovic is spending a year at
Hoover researching the United
States' role in the 1941-45 war in
Yugoslavia. The oppressive Ustasa
regime controlled the country dur
ing that period.
"It should be obvious that,
morally or legally, the best inter
ests of the institution are not
served by pretending that nothing
has happened," Trifkovic said.
"The problem will not go away by
anyone wishing it to go away."
Campbell said, "Frankly, I'll be
delighted when he leaves this
June. I'm tired of this fellow."

called Trifkovic's charges M a collection of
vicious, distorted, imagined and incorrect
allegations not worthy of any detailed
comment."
Trifkovic came forward with details of
the incident yesterday, saying Raisian's
reprimand of his predecessor was "not
enough with the magnitude of Camp
bell's transgressions."
Trifkovic said Raisian told him that
Campbell would be banned from all
Hoover social functions to which outside
guests are invited.
In a series of memos to Raisian after
the incident, Trifkovic demanded that
Campbell resign or be fired from his cur
rent position as counselor, or make a

"substantial contribution" to a fund for
Serbian refugees.
In the confidential memo, Raisian said
a witness at the dinner corroborated
Trifkovic's account of one of the sets of
remarks and concluded that Campbell did
in fact make the other remarks.
The "substance of the allegations [is]
true," Raisian wrote.
An "official apology" from the Hoover
Institution was given to Trifkovic. "I have
also informed Dr. Campbell that I will not
allow Hoover's reputation to be tar
nished" by "racist" remarks at a Univer
sity event, Raisian wrote.
"It's a source of regret to me if
Hoover's reputation were to be blighted
by this man who could be nicknamed the
Hitler of the Tower," Trifkovic said.
At a cocktail hour preceding the din
ner, Trifkovic said he spotted Campbell
wearing a Hoover tie, and the two chatted
about the think tank. Campbell asked

Trifkovic where he originally came from,
and when Trifkovic replied Belgrade,
Campbell said, "Ah, a Serb! Are you mar-

ried to a Croat?"
According to
Trifkovic, when he
answered that he
was, Campbell
added with a grin,
"Well, that means
that you married
way above your sta
tion. . . the Serbs,
of course, are cul
turally, and in
every other way,
inferior to the

Croats." Trifkovic, a journalist as well as
a historian, said he inadvertently record
ed Campbell's remarks on tape. He had
carried a tape machine to record speeches
made by Nakasone and former Secretary
of State George Shultz.

Campbell criticized Trifkovic's use of
the recorder at the event.
"This fellow — I think he's just trying

to get himself out of
a box," Campbell
said. "He's made all
these charges, and
he won't release the
tapes. That's scur
rilous journalism."
Campbell con
tinued, "My lawyer
told me — and let
me point out he's a
good lawyer, not a
Stanford lawyer —
even if you said

those things, do-esn't he believe in free
speech? He spent such a long time in a
totalitarian country that he automatically
tapes everything."


Campbell


Raisian
Since Raisian stopped short of
firing Campbell, Trifkovic said he
is considering leaving before his
one-year appointment at Hoover
expires in June.
"My work has suffered,"
Trifkovic said. "Unlike my first
six months here, it's now better to
be away than be here."
"It seems impossible for me to
remain under the same roof with
Mr. Campbell even for a short
period of time," Trifkovic wrote in
his first memo to Raisian. "It
would be tantamount to expecting
a Jew to cooperate with an inveter
ate Nazi apologist."
"There's really not much I can
say," said Raisian, when asked to
comment on the situation. "It's
strictly a personal matter," he said.
"An incident did occur between
Campbell and Trifkovic. And a
formal complaint was made to me
by Dr. Trifkovic. I took the matter
very seriously. I looked into it
very thoroughly and made a deci
sion that I thought was appropri
ate to the circumstances."
Campbell's run-in with Trifkovic
is certainly not the first time the
prickly Hoover counselor has
enshrouded himself in controversy.
His longstanding feud with two
outspoken liberals, Political Sci
ence Prof. John Manley and
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, was
as well known on campus as that
between the Hatfields and
McCoys.
By the time Campbell was
forced to step down from Hoover's
directorship to assume the title of
"counselor" in 1988, he had built
up an impressive list of antagonists
who were glad to see him go,
including University President
Donald Kennedy and Board of
Trustees President James Gaither.
Even some within Hoover had
grown tired of Campbell's tenden
cy to make outrageous statements.
But Campbell left an impres
sive legacy at the institution.
With his close ties to former
President Ronald Reagan and other

conservative power players, Camp
bell proved to be an astounding
fund raiser, leaving Hoover with a
budget of $15.7 million after his 30
years at the helm. He is widely cred
ited with building Hoover into an
influential think tank with strong
ties to policy makers.
The former director still carries
a lot of clout, and terminating him,
as Trifkovic demanded, would be a
sticky process.
Campbell has said in the past
that his agreement with the
Board of Trustees gives him the
title "counselor for life." Raisian
insisted that he's mistaken. "He's
used that term [counselor for life]
— he's counselor."
Although Campbell's contract

'It should be obvious
that... the best inter
ests of the institution
are not served by pre
tending that nothing
has happened.'
—Srdjan Trifkovic

was negotiated with the Board of
Trustees, Raisian has the ulti
mate authority to fire him.
Trifkovic said, "It would be truly
incredible if this man were to contin
ue" in his job. "I think he's had it.
"Who could he counsel? And
about what? The Ustasa regime
50 years ago — maybe. Hoover of
today — no."
Trifkovic is spending a year at
Hoover researching the United
States' role in the 1941-45 war in
Yugoslavia. The oppressive Ustasa
regime controlled the country dur
ing that period.
"It should be obvious that,
morally or legally, the best inter
ests of the institution are not
served by pretending that nothing
has happened," Trifkovic said.
"The problem will not go away by
anyone wishing it to go away."
Campbell said, "Frankly, I'll be
delighted when he leaves this
June. I'm tired of this fellow."
Hoover Director John Raisian has
strongly reprimanded former Director W.
Glenn Campbell for racist remarks he
allegedly made to a visiting scholar at a
private dinner in February.
In a confidential memo sent to visiting
scholar Srdjan Trifkovic yesterday,
Raisian wrote that he would not tolerate
a repetition of Campbell's behavior, and
if there was one, harsher disciplinary
sanctions would be imposed. Neither
Raisian nor Campbell would comment on
the specifics of the incident or censure.
At a dinner in honor of Japanese Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, Campbell
allegedly told Trifkovic, a Serbian histori
an, "It was too bad if the Croats killed
Jews, but they should have exterminated
the Serbs, so that they would have no
trouble with them today."

According to Trifkovic, when Camp
bell was asked what he meant by this
statement, he answered, "all Serbs were
Nazis anyway." Campbell also allegedly
said Serbs were inferior to Croats.
