# Campbell reprimanded following 'racist' remarks
## 
### Liz Lempert Editorial staff 
Hoover Director John Raisian has
strongly reprimanded former Director W.
Glenn Campbell for racist remarks he
allegedly made to a visiting scholar at a
private dinner in February.
In a confidential memo sent to visiting
scholar Srdjan Trifkovic yesterday,
Raisian wrote that he would not tolerate
a repetition of Campbell's behavior, and
if there was one, harsher disciplinary
sanctions would be imposed. Neither
Raisian nor Campbell would comment on
the specifics of the incident or censure.
At a dinner in honor of Japanese Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, Campbell
allegedly told Trifkovic, a Serbian histori
an, "It was too bad if the Croats killed
Jews, but they should have exterminated
the Serbs, so that they would have no
trouble with them today."

According to Trifkovic, when Camp
bell was asked what he meant by this
statement, he answered, "all Serbs were
Nazis anyway." Campbell also allegedly
said Serbs were inferior to Croats.
In his own letter to Raisian, Campbell
called Trifkovic's charges M a collection of
vicious, distorted, imagined and incorrect
allegations not worthy of any detailed
comment."
Trifkovic came forward with details of
the incident yesterday, saying Raisian's
reprimand of his predecessor was "not
enough with the magnitude of Camp
bell's transgressions."
Trifkovic said Raisian told him that
Campbell would be banned from all
Hoover social functions to which outside
guests are invited.
In a series of memos to Raisian after
the incident, Trifkovic demanded that
Campbell resign or be fired from his cur
rent position as counselor, or make a

"substantial contribution" to a fund for
Serbian refugees.
In the confidential memo, Raisian said
a witness at the dinner corroborated
Trifkovic's account of one of the sets of
remarks and concluded that Campbell did
in fact make the other remarks.
The "substance of the allegations [is]
true," Raisian wrote.
An "official apology" from the Hoover
Institution was given to Trifkovic. "I have
also informed Dr. Campbell that I will not
allow Hoover's reputation to be tar
nished" by "racist" remarks at a Univer
sity event, Raisian wrote.
"It's a source of regret to me if
Hoover's reputation were to be blighted
by this man who could be nicknamed the
Hitler of the Tower," Trifkovic said.
At a cocktail hour preceding the din
ner, Trifkovic said he spotted Campbell
wearing a Hoover tie, and the two chatted
about the think tank. Campbell asked

Trifkovic where he originally came from,
and when Trifkovic replied Belgrade,
Campbell said, "Ah, a Serb! Are you mar-

ried to a Croat?"
According to
Trifkovic, when he
answered that he
was, Campbell
added with a grin,
"Well, that means
that you married
way above your sta
tion. . . the Serbs,
of course, are cul
turally, and in
every other way,
inferior to the

Croats." Trifkovic, a journalist as well as
a historian, said he inadvertently record
ed Campbell's remarks on tape. He had
carried a tape machine to record speeches
made by Nakasone and former Secretary
of State George Shultz.

Campbell criticized Trifkovic's use of
the recorder at the event.
"This fellow — I think he's just trying

to get himself out of
a box," Campbell
said. "He's made all
these charges, and
he won't release the
tapes. That's scur
rilous journalism."
Campbell con
tinued, "My lawyer
told me — and let
me point out he's a
good lawyer, not a
Stanford lawyer —
even if you said

those things, do-esn't he believe in free
speech? He spent such a long time in a
totalitarian country that he automatically
tapes everything."
