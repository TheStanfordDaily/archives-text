CAN THE WORLD be transformed
through business? I still have my
doubts, but having given up on
social change through politics, I'm now
intrigued by the idea of creating a better
world with business.
Though many leaders have pushed
various economic agendas, the Black
Freedom struggle of the last thirty-five
years has fought mainly through the
courts and Congress to establish basic
human rights for black Americans.
In many ways, black leadership, led by
the NAACP, has succeeded in winning
many of the legal battles it set out to con
quer. Though certainly much injustice
remains — from the death penalty to
school funding — and many battles con
tinue to be fought, a strong legal and con
stitutional foundation exists to protect
the rights of black Americans.
The fight for rights was a crucial first step
in the fight for economic success. To struggle
for wealth without the legal protections is
equivalent to making money without having
a safe to store it in. You might get rich, but
anyone white could steal from you.

But now that many of those rights have
been won, we must shift the battle from a
legal one to an economic one. Which brings
us to business. I'm convinced that at the
heart of any future progressive agenda, and
in particular any black agenda, must be an
effort to end the horror of inner-city poverty.
What many scholars — like University
of Chicago sociologist William Julius Wil
son — suggest is a sort of Marshall Plan for
urban America: a massive reconstruction
of the economic infrastructure of our inner
cities. Though I fear this may be the only
solution, our current administration
doesn't give a damn about poor people,
especially colored ones, and so I'm left with
the notion of trying to rebuild a devastated
community by starting my own business.
I imagine that in setting up shop I will
give people decent jobs, provide a needed
service, be a role model and contribute to
the economic and moral rejuvenation of a
neighborhood. Initially this project might
be confined to only one neighborhood,
but at least it would be a start.
Also, I've been reading lately about
various companies, like Ben & Jerry's,
The Body Shop and Patagonia, that all
have strong social ethics as a part of their
business. For example, Patagonia donates
a substantial portion of their profits to
charity and The Body Shop is active in
many political causes.
They've even started an organization
called the Social Venture Network to

assist up-and-coming companies with
like-minded commitments. There aren't
many models, but perhaps there is room
for some kind of righteous capitalism —
as concerned with change in our society
as the change in our pockets.
This idea is not new, as leaders from
Malcolm X to Richard Nixon have called
for black capitalism to pull black America
out of poverty. Unfortunately, more than
80 percent of all black-owned businesses
employ but one person, the owner. So,
though few disagree with the concept, the
execution leaves much to be desired. Clear
ly, few black-owned businesses are pre
pared to lead the rebirth of black ghettos.
Still, I'm excited to give it a shot. My
business will try to integrate community
service with goods and services. We'll
make money and make a difference. Take
from the community but definitely give
back to it — or at least that's the dream.
Who knows what the future holds, but if
you're in the neighborhood, come look
me up in Brooklyn.

Omar is certain that the salvation of
black America lies in the X-Cap. If you
wish to help make the world a better
place, buy one from him.
