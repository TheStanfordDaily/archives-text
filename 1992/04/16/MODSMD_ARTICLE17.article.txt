Energy concerns must
not obscure harm done
to lifestyles, wildlands
Deep in the heart of the Northern Rock
ies, south of Glacier National Park and
north of the Bob Marshall Wilderness com -
plex, stands the Rocky Mountain Front.
The Badger-Two Medicine, sacred
Blackfeet land, is part of this incredible
place. The arm of our government known
as the U.S. Forest Service and one of
their comrades in crime, "Big Oil," cur
rently have this land under siege.
On the eve of the national holiday
commemorating Columbus' "discovery"
of America, we must pause to reflect on
the current situation of indigenous peo
ple of this country.
The recent concern about national
energy security has driven those charged
with "stewardship" of our national forests
to pull out all the stops in the way of
development of potential energy reserves.
The decisions being made about
"management" of the Rocky Mountain
Front are precedent setting, and all U.S.
citizens should be aware of the proceed
ings on this issue.
Let me share the words of the Pikuni
Traditionalists, Blackfeet spiritual lead
ers: "Any disturbance in the Badger-Two
Medicine is a desecration of our sacred
place and represents a serious threat to
our ability to practice our religion.
"The threat of destruction to this area
from the development agenda set forth
by the Forest Service, and their contin
ued failure to acknowledge our concerns
as valid and legitimate is literally a threat
of cultural genocide." As citizens of this
country, we are a part of the threat.
What if the grizzly, the grey wolf, the
mountain goat and the mountains could
speak?
Fina Oil and Chemical Co. plans to
erect a well less than two miles from
Glacier National Park. Chevron USA
plans to drive a well into the heart of the

Badger at Goat Mountain.
These two proposals combined would
lead to construction of nearly 25 miles of
new road in a roadless area. This action
will change this sacred land forever.
Furthermore, any natural gas is like
ly to contain hydrogen sulfide, a highly
lethal and explosive gas. What has hap
pened to corporate responsibility?
The Badger Chapter, a Montana
grassroots group committed to stopping
all oil and gas drilling on the Rocky
Mountain Front, states the bottom line:
"If the oil and gas industry is allowed
to tear up a roadless wildland area that
is sacred ground, habitat for endangered
species, adjacent to an internationally
famous national park and two wilder
ness areas, subject to reserved treaty
rights and is the most popular candidate
for wilderness designation in the state,
then they will be able to drill anywhere!"
The Lewis and Clark National Forest
has issued a Final Environmental Impact
Statement approving "Big Oil's" plans to
drill. Over 50 citizen appeals were sub
mitted in opposition to their decision, but
they have not reversed it.
Keep track of this issue â€” it will set
precedent for drilling on all public lands.
As citizens we need to evaluate our use of
oil and natural gas; we need to demand a
national energy polity that does not allow
the rape and pillage of public lands to con
tinue to satisfy our addiction to fossil fuels.
We need to oppose the subsidization
of these resources and be willing to
acknowledge and pay for the destruction
caused by our lifestyle.
The biggest obstacle to an energy policy
based on conservation and truly renewable
resources are the executives of large oil cor
porations who are pulling political strings
to push through irresponsible policy.
Boycott Chevron USA and American
Petrofina. Get involved in National For
est issues. Ride a bike or walk. Listen to
the earth and heed her call. Stand up for
protection of the Badger-Two Medicine.
