## The
						future's so bright... Freshman Allen surprises in first season on Farm 
### Ed Donovan Staff Writer 
The future of Stanford baseball's
power hitting rests substantially in the
strong arms of freshman first baseman
Dusty Allen. In fact, the contribution
he has already made with his bat is one
of the keys to the Cardinal's success
this season.
Allen began playing baseball when
he was five years old, and it has been his
sport ever since. He credits his father as
his biggest inspiration as he grew up
with the game.
"There's no way I'd be where I am
without him. I remember when I was
little he would hit me ground balls or
pitch to me, and he used to come to all
my games."
During his senior season at Edmond
(OK) High School, Allen was heavily
recruited. His decision to come to Stan
ford was based partly on the school's
academic reputation as well as his
impression of Coach Mark Marquess.
"No one is a bigger winner than
Coach Marquess. I have a lot of respect
for that. Plus, he was the only coach
that personally did the recruiting."
Since he arrived at Stanford, Allen
has changed his approach to the way he
plays baseball. The days are gone when
he could dominate high school pitchers
with his home run barrages, but he has

become a more disciplined and dedicat
ed player in the process.
"I used to be more one-dimensional,"
Allen reflected, "but the coaches have
helped me to spray the ball more and
learn how to hit the curveball more con
sistently." Allen is hitting .333 on the
year, and is either first or second on the
team in homers, doubles and RBl's.

Statistics just don't seem to impress
Allen, unless his team is winning.
"Driving in runs is my favorite thing
because that's what helps us win, 1 * he
said, "but more than anything I'm just
happy to be playing. For coach Mar
quess to give me a chance just makes
me play that much harder."
His recent switch from designated
hitter to first base reflects his improv
ing defense. He likes playing first, he
says, "because it keeps me in the game.
When you DH you're only in four or five
times and you lose the other half."
As he lounged in his Cardenal room,
Allen had a lot to say about his relation

ship with baseball and his team's
chances this season. His room in Flo Mo
clearly showed where his focus lies.
Posters of Eric Davis and Nolan Ryan
adorned the walls, and the Padres-
Giants game played at low volume on a
portable TV.
Like most ballplayers, the vision of
himself playing in a major league uni
form constantly drives Allen. He likes
the Oakland Athletics, he claims,
because "I'm totally impressed with big
guys like Canseco and McGwire. It's
almost fun to watch Canseco strike out
as hard as he swings."
Allen made it clear, however, that
the major leagues were a long term
goal, a mental carrot resting in the
back of his mind. His day to day obses
sion is to help his team win in any way
possible. "I want to win a College
World Series before I leave," he said
flatly.
Allen gushes confidence in his team's
chances for post-season play. "Our
team has a good shot at Omaha and
possibly at winning it all," he said, "We
get along really well, so it's just a mat
ter of putting it all together."
This is not to say that he is not real
istic, but believing in himself and his
team represents an essential part of
winning for Allen. He admits that the
rest of the season is crucial, especially
after losing three straight games to the
California Golden Bears.
"We had a little lapse there," he
acknowledged, "but taking two out of
three from ASU means we've picked it
up now and we're right back on track."
Today, Allen and the rest of the Car
dinal begin a three game series with the
USC Trojans in Los Angeles. At this
point in the season, two games separate
the top five teams in the conference.
Third-place Stanford (24-15, 9-9 in the
Pacific-10 Conference/Southern Divi
sion) needs to win at least two out of
three games against the fiflh-place Tro
jans (20-20, 8-10) to keep their play-off
hopes bright.
Allen looked forward to this trip as a
good chance to prove their mettle as a
team. "Every game is big from here on
out," he emphasized.

Dusty Allen at the plate in action against Arizona State last weekend. The freshman has
been pacing Cardinal bats all season: his .333 average is fourth-best on the team, and
his .527 slugging percentage ranks only behind Jeffrey Hammonds's .553 mark.
