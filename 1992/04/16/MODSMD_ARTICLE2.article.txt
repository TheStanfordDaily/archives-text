WASHINGTON - While the long Road to
the Final Four may have ended in Los Ange
les for the women's basketball team, the con
siderably more relaxed Road from the Final
Four made its most recent stop on the White
House lawn yesterday.
Under overcast Washington skies, Presi
dent Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle wel
comed the Cardinal and the Duke University
men's basketball teams to the White House to
celebrate their NCAA championships and
shoot a few baskets on the presidential court.
"We have to stop meeting like this," the
President told the teams, both of whom were
on their second visit to the Rose Garden. Stan
ford was first there in 1990, Duke in 1991.
The more than 300 audience members
included local high school basketball champi
ons, who scrambled for autographs and pho
tographs of the players before the ceremony,
as well as Stanford graduate Carla Hills, now
the United States Trade Representative, and
Michael Boskin, Stanford economics professor
turned President's Chief Economic Adviser.
The team fanned out in a line to the left of
the President, flanked by Robin Kennedy and
Dan Quayle, who, after Bush referred to him as
"our basketball-playing, basketball-loving Vice
President," smiled gamely for the entire 20-
minute ceremony, but never said a word — not
even to defend his home state after his boss
made a crack about Duke's beating Indiana in
the semifinals of the men's Final Four.
Stanford women's basketball coach Tara
VanDerveer "may be the best court strategist
since Perry Mason," the President announced
before launching into an enthusiastic dis
course on the individual and group achieve
ments of the Stanford team.
Either Bush or someone on his speechwrit
ing staff is a big basketball fan: the President
