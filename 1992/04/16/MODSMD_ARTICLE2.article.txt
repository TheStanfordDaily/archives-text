## Bush hosts champs on White House lawn 
### Amy Rosenfeld 
WASHINGTON - While the long Road to
the Final Four may have ended in Los Ange
les for the women's basketball team, the con
siderably more relaxed Road from the Final
Four made its most recent stop on the White
House lawn yesterday.
Under overcast Washington skies, Presi
dent Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle wel
comed the Cardinal and the Duke University
men's basketball teams to the White House to
celebrate their NCAA championships and
shoot a few baskets on the presidential court.
"We have to stop meeting like this," the
President told the teams, both of whom were
on their second visit to the Rose Garden. Stan
ford was first there in 1990, Duke in 1991.
The more than 300 audience members
included local high school basketball champi
ons, who scrambled for autographs and pho
tographs of the players before the ceremony,
as well as Stanford graduate Carla Hills, now
the United States Trade Representative, and
Michael Boskin, Stanford economics professor
turned President's Chief Economic Adviser.
The team fanned out in a line to the left of
the President, flanked by Robin Kennedy and
Dan Quayle, who, after Bush referred to him as
"our basketball-playing, basketball-loving Vice
President," smiled gamely for the entire 20-
minute ceremony, but never said a word — not
even to defend his home state after his boss
made a crack about Duke's beating Indiana in
the semifinals of the men's Final Four.
Stanford women's basketball coach Tara
VanDerveer "may be the best court strategist
since Perry Mason," the President announced
before launching into an enthusiastic dis
course on the individual and group achieve
ments of the Stanford team.
Either Bush or someone on his speechwrit
ing staff is a big basketball fan: the President

singled out 10 of the 13 players on
the Stanford squad by name and
seemed to know almost all of
them by sight.
He mentioned with a touch of
what seemed pride that "Stan
ford's all-everything center, Val
Whiting" is studying to be a doctor,
and noted that guard Molly Good
enbour is majoring in psychology.
"And why not? All season
Goodenbour has made opponents
shake their heads," he said, in a
rather oblique reference to psy
chology meant to praise Gooden
bour's NCAA tournament record
of 18 three-point field goals.
And of guard Angela Taylor,
the President said, "I won't say
what kind of reputation Angela
has for her skills on defense, but
they want to talk to her, Cheney
does, over at the Pentagon." The
players smiled and waved at Bush
as he mentioned each of them.
Turning to the Duke team,
Bush quipped: "As my predeces
sor might have said, 'There you
go again.' " The crowd was either
heavily partisan or stacked with
Duke fans, because the Presi
dent's comment that he and Duke
"have something in common; we
both like the word repeat,"
brought the strongest applause of
the day.
After wisecracking through a
laundry list of athletic accom
plishments by both teams, the
President took a serious turn to
praise the strong academic repu
tation of both Stanford and Duke.
"You've shown how a nation that
is physically fit and educationally
fit is fit to take on the world," he
said, calling the American educa
tion system "our most enduring
legacy."
This being an election year, the
President's comments were laced
with other allusion to his admin
istration's achievements in office.
In singling out Hills, Bush noted
that she had played tennis at
Stanford, being "a little short for
basketball, but plenty tough in
trade negotiations."
The President also pointed to
the front row to former Notre
Dame basketball coach Digger
Phelps, who is now part of the
White House's "Weed and Seed"
anti-drug program, and compared
Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski's
crushing of opponents on the
court to General Norman
Schwarzkopf's triumphs on the
field of battle.
Team captain Ann Adkins, the
squad's sole senior, presented

Bush with a game ball that read
"Stanford University National
Champs." And VanDerveer, offer
ing the President a Stanford let
terman jacket, thanked him for
hosting them, and added, "We'd
like to be back here next year."
"It's up to you," Bush replied.
After the formal ceremony, the
two teams joined the President
for a free-throw contest on the
White House court, where the
green surface is actually more

'I won't say what kind
of reputation Angela
[Taylor] has for . . .
defense, but they
want to talk to her,
Cheney does, over at
the Pentagon.'
—President Bush

suited for a tennis match than a
basketball game.
The women faired well despite
the triple disadvantages of skirts,
high-heels and a men's basket
ball, which is larger and heavier.
Val Whiting and Duke's Thomas
Hill came out on top in the con
test, which featured a little hoops
shooting by the First Fan himself.
After pointing out his horse
shoe pit, Bush missed a hook shot
but made "a little lay-up," Adkins
said. Duke guard Bobby Hurley
offered a less kind assessment,
describing the shot as "very bad."
But while the President's bas
ketball skills may be a little rusty,
the Stanford players found him to
be very friendly. "He seemed like
a nice guy," Whiting said. "He
was just making small talk."
Adkins added that "It seemed
like he was having a good time,
like he didn't want to go back to
work." So will she vote for him in
November? "No comment,"
Adkins replied, demonstrating
that she learned a thing or two
from Washingtonians in the less
than-24 hours the team spent in
the capital.
Although this is the Cardinal's
second trip to the White House in
three years, three-quarters of the
squad were making their Rose
Garden debut. "We've had nine
new players in two years," Van-
Derveer said. "So it's all brand
new for most of them."
But even for veterans it's still
exciting. "Everyone wants to be
here again next year: President
Bush, us, Duke," she said, grin
ning broadly. "It doesn't get old."

squad's sole senior, presented

Bush with a game ball that read
"Stanford University National
Champs." And VanDerveer, offer
ing the President a Stanford let
terman jacket, thanked him for
hosting them, and added, "We'd
like to be back here next year."
"It's up to you," Bush replied.
After the formal ceremony, the
two teams joined the President
for a free-throw contest on the
White House court, where the
green surface is actually more

'I won't say what kind
of reputation Angela
[Taylor] has for . . .
defense, but they
want to talk to her,
Cheney does, over at
the Pentagon.'
—President Bush

suited for a tennis match than a
basketball game.
The women faired well despite
the triple disadvantages of skirts,
high-heels and a men's basket
ball, which is larger and heavier.
Val Whiting and Duke's Thomas
Hill came out on top in the con
test, which featured a little hoops
shooting by the First Fan himself.
After pointing out his horse
shoe pit, Bush missed a hook shot
but made "a little lay-up," Adkins
said. Duke guard Bobby Hurley
offered a less kind assessment,
describing the shot as "very bad."
But while the President's bas
ketball skills may be a little rusty,
the Stanford players found him to
be very friendly. "He seemed like
a nice guy," Whiting said. "He
was just making small talk."
Adkins added that "It seemed
like he was having a good time,
like he didn't want to go back to
work." So will she vote for him in
November? "No comment,"
Adkins replied, demonstrating
that she learned a thing or two
from Washingtonians in the less
than-24 hours the team spent in
the capital.
Although this is the Cardinal's
second trip to the White House in
three years, three-quarters of the
squad were making their Rose
Garden debut. "We've had nine
new players in two years," Van-
Derveer said. "So it's all brand
new for most of them."
But even for veterans it's still
exciting. "Everyone wants to be
here again next year: President
Bush, us, Duke," she said, grin
ning broadly. "It doesn't get old."
WASHINGTON - While the long Road to
the Final Four may have ended in Los Ange
les for the women's basketball team, the con
siderably more relaxed Road from the Final
Four made its most recent stop on the White
House lawn yesterday.
Under overcast Washington skies, Presi
dent Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle wel
comed the Cardinal and the Duke University
men's basketball teams to the White House to
celebrate their NCAA championships and
shoot a few baskets on the presidential court.
"We have to stop meeting like this," the
President told the teams, both of whom were
on their second visit to the Rose Garden. Stan
ford was first there in 1990, Duke in 1991.
The more than 300 audience members
included local high school basketball champi
ons, who scrambled for autographs and pho
tographs of the players before the ceremony,
as well as Stanford graduate Carla Hills, now
the United States Trade Representative, and
Michael Boskin, Stanford economics professor
turned President's Chief Economic Adviser.
The team fanned out in a line to the left of
the President, flanked by Robin Kennedy and
Dan Quayle, who, after Bush referred to him as
"our basketball-playing, basketball-loving Vice
President," smiled gamely for the entire 20-
minute ceremony, but never said a word — not
even to defend his home state after his boss
made a crack about Duke's beating Indiana in
the semifinals of the men's Final Four.
Stanford women's basketball coach Tara
VanDerveer "may be the best court strategist
since Perry Mason," the President announced
before launching into an enthusiastic dis
course on the individual and group achieve
ments of the Stanford team.
Either Bush or someone on his speechwrit
ing staff is a big basketball fan: the President

singled out 10 of the 13 players on
the Stanford squad by name and
seemed to know almost all of
them by sight.
He mentioned with a touch of
what seemed pride that "Stan
ford's all-everything center, Val
Whiting" is studying to be a doctor,
and noted that guard Molly Good
enbour is majoring in psychology.
"And why not? All season
Goodenbour has made opponents
shake their heads," he said, in a
rather oblique reference to psy
chology meant to praise Gooden
bour's NCAA tournament record
of 18 three-point field goals.
And of guard Angela Taylor,
the President said, "I won't say
what kind of reputation Angela
has for her skills on defense, but
they want to talk to her, Cheney
does, over at the Pentagon." The
players smiled and waved at Bush
as he mentioned each of them.
Turning to the Duke team,
Bush quipped: "As my predeces
sor might have said, 'There you
go again.' " The crowd was either
heavily partisan or stacked with
Duke fans, because the Presi
dent's comment that he and Duke
"have something in common; we
both like the word repeat,"
brought the strongest applause of
the day.
After wisecracking through a
laundry list of athletic accom
plishments by both teams, the
President took a serious turn to
praise the strong academic repu
tation of both Stanford and Duke.
"You've shown how a nation that
is physically fit and educationally
fit is fit to take on the world," he
said, calling the American educa
tion system "our most enduring
legacy."
This being an election year, the
President's comments were laced
with other allusion to his admin
istration's achievements in office.
In singling out Hills, Bush noted
that she had played tennis at
Stanford, being "a little short for
basketball, but plenty tough in
trade negotiations."
The President also pointed to
the front row to former Notre
Dame basketball coach Digger
Phelps, who is now part of the
White House's "Weed and Seed"
anti-drug program, and compared
Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski's
crushing of opponents on the
court to General Norman
Schwarzkopf's triumphs on the
field of battle.
