# Zen and the art of hammer throwing
## 
### Nick Clements Staff writer 
Dave Popejoy calls it"the Zen
of hammer," a feeling one has
when everything comes together
in one perfect, free-flowing throw.
In essence, something "snaps"
inside the hammer thrower and
suddenly he or she has graduated
into the next competitive level.
The sophomore from Los
Gatos just might "snap" himself
into the Olympics this summer in
Barcelona.
He has already qualified auto
matically for the NCAA Champi
onships in early June with a
throw of 208'3" and is currently
the top-ranked hammer thrower
in the Pacific 10 Conference after
finishing seventh last year. He is
less than two feet away from
qualifying for the Olympic trials
in New Orleans this summer.
And, by hammer throw coach
Dave Swan's account, Popejoy is
going to get much better.
"He's the best I've ever
coached. . .he's quite a bit stronger
than collegiate hammer throwers
and I'd say his strength is within
fifteen per cent of Olympic ham
mer throwers," said Swan, who
himself is training for a spot on the
U.S. Olympic team this summer.
"The first year he was here he
improved 40 feet. This year he has
improved another 20 feet. His
progress has been phenomenal."
The men's throwing team, in
general, has been enjoying a huge
ly successful spring season. Junior
Pat Stowell, who throws the dis
cus, was only recently defeated for
the first time at home. Sopho
mores Matt Karsevar and Toby
Norwood have also been progress
ing rapidly throughout the season.
"We try to push each other in

the weight room," Popejoy said.
"Sometimes I can go too hard.
Dave [Swan] has told me I tend to
beat myself up with the weights."
Popejoy, who says he will prob
ably major in psychology, was one
of the top three hammer throw
recruits in the United States
when he was in high school. He
placed fifth in California his
junior year and third his senior
year. Ironically, his best friend
Kevin McMahon was one of the

other top recruits. McMahon is
now at Georgetown and has qual
ified for the Olympic trials.
"It's really important to have
people push you, and I think that
Kevin and I push each other even
though we're clear across the
country from each other," Popejoy
said. "We still talk all the time."
Popejoy also has the benefit of
training with the best. While in
high school he threw under the
guidance of Ed Burke, a three time
Olympian. He has also trained
with Swedish hammer thrower
Torre Gustofson, who has been
ranked number five in the world.
"Their level just brings you up..
.Success is a habit with them," said
Popejoy, who credits Burke with
helping him not only physically,
but mentally and spiritually as
well. "Ed taught me to step into
the ring, visualize the throw and


If "the Zen of throwing" occurs only on a perfect toss, then sophomore Dave Popejoy
is quickly approching master status. The top-rated hammerman in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, Popejoy's recent 208'3" throw qualified him for the NCAA Championships.
