# Zen and the art of hammer throwing
## 
### Nick Clements Staff writer 
Dave Popejoy calls it"the Zen
of hammer," a feeling one has
when everything comes together
in one perfect, free-flowing throw.
In essence, something "snaps"
inside the hammer thrower and
suddenly he or she has graduated
into the next competitive level.
The sophomore from Los
Gatos just might "snap" himself
into the Olympics this summer in
Barcelona.
He has already qualified auto
matically for the NCAA Champi
onships in early June with a
throw of 208'3" and is currently
the top-ranked hammer thrower
in the Pacific 10 Conference after
finishing seventh last year. He is
less than two feet away from
qualifying for the Olympic trials
in New Orleans this summer.
And, by hammer throw coach
Dave Swan's account, Popejoy is
going to get much better.
"He's the best I've ever
coached. . .he's quite a bit stronger
than collegiate hammer throwers
and I'd say his strength is within
fifteen per cent of Olympic ham
mer throwers," said Swan, who
himself is training for a spot on the
U.S. Olympic team this summer.
"The first year he was here he
improved 40 feet. This year he has
improved another 20 feet. His
progress has been phenomenal."
The men's throwing team, in
general, has been enjoying a huge
ly successful spring season. Junior
Pat Stowell, who throws the dis
cus, was only recently defeated for
the first time at home. Sopho
mores Matt Karsevar and Toby
Norwood have also been progress
ing rapidly throughout the season.
"We try to push each other in

the weight room," Popejoy said.
"Sometimes I can go too hard.
Dave [Swan] has told me I tend to
beat myself up with the weights."
Popejoy, who says he will prob
ably major in psychology, was one
of the top three hammer throw
recruits in the United States
when he was in high school. He
placed fifth in California his
junior year and third his senior
year. Ironically, his best friend
Kevin McMahon was one of the

progress has been phe
nomenal.'

other top recruits. McMahon is
now at Georgetown and has qual
ified for the Olympic trials.
"It's really important to have
people push you, and I think that
Kevin and I push each other even
though we're clear across the
country from each other," Popejoy
said. "We still talk all the time."
Popejoy also has the benefit of
training with the best. While in
high school he threw under the
guidance of Ed Burke, a three time
Olympian. He has also trained
with Swedish hammer thrower
Torre Gustofson, who has been
ranked number five in the world.
"Their level just brings you up..
.Success is a habit with them," said
Popejoy, who credits Burke with
helping him not only physically,
but mentally and spiritually as
well. "Ed taught me to step into
the ring, visualize the throw and


If "the Zen of throwing" occurs only on a perfect toss, then sophomore Dave Popejoy

then concentrate on one thing.
"The thing about the hammer
throw is that it takes a lot of techni
cal precision, more than in the shot
put or the discus.. .you have to
practice so many motions so many
thousands of times. You need a
tremendous amount of concentra
tion. It can get frustrating."
Practice, he says can be a "roller
coaster" at times. "My best throws
arc always during the meets. A lot of
people are the opposite way," he said.
"I don't think I've ever thrown bet
ter than 197,198 feet in practice."
Both Popejoy and Swan attest
that the frustration that often goes
hand in hand with the desire to
succeed can make practice difficult.
"Dave is his own worst enemy,"
Swan said. "He's a very emotional
thrower, very aggressive, very
strong and I don't think he's used
to all the strength he's got because
he's come along so fast."
"He's very strong willed and
intense.. .1 try to tell him that if he
can let go of his anger and frustra
tion then he can regroup by his
second throw as opposed to his
sixth throw," he added.
Still, Swan says Popejoy is one
of the most mature 20 year olds he
has ever known.
"Dave was expected coming out
of high school to be an elite throw

er," he said. "For an 18-year old,
that's a tremendous amount of
pressure. I think he's opened up a
lot since he's been at Stamford."
Pam Dukes, a former Cardinal
star and a member of last year's
U.S. World Championship team
who trains and coaches at Stan
ford, attests to Popejoy's intensity.
"You definitely know when he's
not happy.. .he won't talk to any
one," she said, laughing. "We're
able to joke around in the weight
room, though. Dave is a good role
model for everyone."
This year, Popejoy wants to win
the Pac-10 championships, achieve
Ail-American status (to do so he
must place in the top six among
Americans) and qualify for the
Olympic trials.
"The trials are one of those
things where you can easily let
down.. .1 don't want to let that hap
pen to me," he said. "I want to
establish myself on that elite level."
"The thing about the hammer
throw is that you never know
(when it will happen)," said Swan,
referring back to the 'snap.' "Once
you've felt it, it's ingrained in
your brain and you don't forget."
Popejoy wants to start throw
ing 220 to 230 feet. He and Swan
both acknowledge the fact that a
lot of practice and work are need
ed in order to throw the hammer
that far.
Then again, maybe it's just a
snap away.
