# When privacy is public issue
## 
### 
Doug Smith, a tennis reporter for USA Today,
had a problem. He had heard rumors for some
time that Arthur Ashe, a former tennis star,
had contracted AIDS. The question was: should he go
after the story and ask Ashe point-blank if he did
indeed have the deadly disease, or should he not pry
and stay out of the former Wimbledon champion's
private life?

In the end, he went after the scoop, discovered
that Ashe had known since 1988 that he had AIDS,
and essentially forced the former tennis star to
publicly announce his condition before the story
broke in the newspaper. Ashe said he felt pres
sured. "I don't like doing this under duress," he
said. "I feel angiy." He blamed the press for invad
ing his privacy and causing him to reveal his secret.
This story was published one week ago today,
and it has brought the issue of the right of individ
ual privacy back into the limelight. How much
should the press probe, and in this case in particu
lar, how far should the sportswriter have gone?
The temptation is to answer these questions sit
uation by situation, but that is taking the easy way
out. The general rule must be laid down that
reporters should respect an individual's privacy. I
firmly believe that Smith was wrong in asking
Ashe if he had AIDS. It is a horrible, deadly disease
that unfortunately carries an equally terrible
social stigma. Ashe wanted to avoid all the publici
ty that is now pouring upon him and his family
because of his condition. Now he has been forced to
deal with his illness publicly.
Some justify Smith's actions by drawing com
parisons between his investigative reporting and
delving into a political candidate's background to
unearth scandals. Ashe, however, is not a public
