# When privacy is public issue
## 
### 
Doug Smith, a tennis reporter for USA Today,
had a problem. He had heard rumors for some
time that Arthur Ashe, a former tennis star,
had contracted AIDS. The question was: should he go
after the story and ask Ashe point-blank if he did
indeed have the deadly disease, or should he not pry
and stay out of the former Wimbledon champion's
private life?

In the end, he went after the scoop, discovered
that Ashe had known since 1988 that he had AIDS,
and essentially forced the former tennis star to
publicly announce his condition before the story
broke in the newspaper. Ashe said he felt pres
sured. "I don't like doing this under duress," he
said. "I feel angiy." He blamed the press for invad
ing his privacy and causing him to reveal his secret.
This story was published one week ago today,
and it has brought the issue of the right of individ
ual privacy back into the limelight. How much
should the press probe, and in this case in particu
lar, how far should the sportswriter have gone?
The temptation is to answer these questions sit
uation by situation, but that is taking the easy way
out. The general rule must be laid down that
reporters should respect an individual's privacy. I
firmly believe that Smith was wrong in asking
Ashe if he had AIDS. It is a horrible, deadly disease
that unfortunately carries an equally terrible
social stigma. Ashe wanted to avoid all the publici
ty that is now pouring upon him and his family
because of his condition. Now he has been forced to
deal with his illness publicly.
Some justify Smith's actions by drawing com
parisons between his investigative reporting and
delving into a political candidate's background to
unearth scandals. Ashe, however, is not a public

official running for office; he is a
human being who wanted to pro
tect his family from the spotlight.
A candidate for a political office
must meet certain standards and
earn the trust of the public, where
as Ashe is under no obligation to
provide any personal information.
A conflict-of-interest matter is far
different from contracting a dis
ease; having AIDS is not a crime.
In the interest of pursuing a
story, Smith intruded upon Ashe's
personal life and denied the former
Wimbledon champ his right to pri
vacy. Why does the public need to
know that he has contracted
AIDS? Ashe did not make the
same choice to tell the public that
Magic Johnson did; he apparently
did not want to subject his family
to the scrutiny of the press. Per

haps Ashe, his wife and his daugh
ter all grew closer together as a
family because of this crisis. It will
be much more difficult for them to
remain close now that Ashe's con
dition is publicly known.
Glenn Dickey of the San Fran
cisco Chronicle wrote last Satur
day that "To say that USA Today
was invading Ashe's privacy by
investigating a report is tanta
mount to saying that reporters
should censor themselves, a posi
tion I fmd morally indefensible." It
seems that whenever a question of
privacy rights is addressed, oppo
nents always conjure up the grim
specter of censorship to quiet their
critics. It just doesn't apply here —
his is a case of compassion, not
censorship. Reporting should
involve more than cold facts; this
business is all about people, and
we need to treat media figures as
more than just article-fodder.
By announcing that he had
AIDS before a story ran in the

papers, Ashe did confront his prob
lem head-on. Now he does not look
as if he is hiding something. Per
haps it will lessen the stigma placed
upon him. But it will still be an
enormous task to handle the pub
licity and pressure. Just because he
is an athlete does not mean that he
is superhuman. Not everyone can
be Magic Johnson and choose to
face such an overwhelming oppo
nent so openly. Ashe chose to deal
with his crisis the way he felt was
best for him — privately — and
Smith should not have forced him
to address it openly.
Some have said that Ashe's dis
closure will increase AIDS aware
ness and hopefully focus more
attention and money on finding a
cure. Now that his story is out, I
hope that they are right and that
good will come of it. But it is awful
to think that Ashe could not face
the disease privately as he had
wanted because a reporter pushed
him for the story.

out. The general rule must be laid down that
reporters should respect an individual's privacy. I
firmly believe that Smith was wrong in asking
Ashe if he had AIDS. It is a horrible, deadly disease
that unfortunately carries an equally terrible
social stigma. Ashe wanted to avoid all the publici
ty that is now pouring upon him and his family
because of his condition. Now he has been forced to
deal with his illness publicly.
Some justify Smith's actions by drawing com
parisons between his investigative reporting and
delving into a political candidate's background to
unearth scandals. Ashe, however, is not a public

official running for office; he is a
human being who wanted to pro
tect his family from the spotlight.
A candidate for a political office
must meet certain standards and
earn the trust of the public, where
as Ashe is under no obligation to
provide any personal information.
A conflict-of-interest matter is far
different from contracting a dis
ease; having AIDS is not a crime.
In the interest of pursuing a
story, Smith intruded upon Ashe's
personal life and denied the former
Wimbledon champ his right to pri
vacy. Why does the public need to
know that he has contracted
AIDS? Ashe did not make the
same choice to tell the public that
Magic Johnson did; he apparently
did not want to subject his family
to the scrutiny of the press. Per

haps Ashe, his wife and his daugh
ter all grew closer together as a
family because of this crisis. It will
be much more difficult for them to
remain close now that Ashe's con
dition is publicly known.
Glenn Dickey of the San Fran
cisco Chronicle wrote last Satur
day that "To say that USA Today
was invading Ashe's privacy by
investigating a report is tanta
mount to saying that reporters
should censor themselves, a posi
tion I fmd morally indefensible." It
seems that whenever a question of
privacy rights is addressed, oppo
nents always conjure up the grim
specter of censorship to quiet their
critics. It just doesn't apply here —
his is a case of compassion, not
censorship. Reporting should
involve more than cold facts; this
business is all about people, and
we need to treat media figures as
more than just article-fodder.
By announcing that he had
AIDS before a story ran in the

papers, Ashe did confront his prob
lem head-on. Now he does not look
as if he is hiding something. Per
haps it will lessen the stigma placed
upon him. But it will still be an
enormous task to handle the pub
licity and pressure. Just because he
is an athlete does not mean that he
is superhuman. Not everyone can
be Magic Johnson and choose to
face such an overwhelming oppo
nent so openly. Ashe chose to deal
with his crisis the way he felt was
best for him — privately — and
Smith should not have forced him
to address it openly.
Some have said that Ashe's dis
closure will increase AIDS aware
ness and hopefully focus more
attention and money on finding a
cure. Now that his story is out, I
hope that they are right and that
good will come of it. But it is awful
to think that Ashe could not face
the disease privately as he had
wanted because a reporter pushed
him for the story.
