## No. 2 Card ousts Hawaii, 15-3, 15-4, 15-12 
### Laurie Wackier Staff writer 
Men's volleyball coach Ruben Nieves stresses
that establishing high standards has played an
instrumental role in the success of his squad this
season. Heading into post-season play, Nieves
summed up the attitude: "We won't settle for medi
ocrity."
The second-ranked Cardinal put on a display
that hardly resembled mediocrity when they opened
the Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Association
Tournament yesterday at Irvine's Bren Events
Center.
With a scorching offensive performance, Stan
ford eliminated No. 10 Hawaii in three games, 15-3,
15-4, 15-12. The win advances Stanford (21-3) to
the semifinals of the tournament, while Hawaii
completes its season at 13-15.
Fueled by the unstoppable trio of Dave Goss,
Ryan Moos, and Duncan Blackman, Stanford pun
ished the Rainbows with a .431 team hitting per
centage. Dave Goss led with 17 put-aways and nine
digs, followed by Moos and Blackman, with 16 and
13 kills, respectively. Hawaii hit only .253 as a
team.
In addition to the powerful net performance,
Nieves cited serving as a crucial factor in the match.
But it was a different look from the line than Stan
ford's opponents are used to.
"We usually rely on our jump servers, but they
were kind of struggling," Nieves explained. "Today,
our float servers took control of the match.
"They were doing a great job creating scoring
opportunities for us, especially when our jump

servers got in trouble. That allowed us to get start
ed fast, and we never looked back."
In other first-round action, No. 3 UCLA (17-6)
defeated USC (11-12) in just three games. Stanford
meets the Bruins in the semifinal round of the
WTVA tournament Friday at 5:00 p.m. According to
Nieves, the match-up may be one of the toughest of
the tournament.
"That's a tough draw," said Nieves of Friday's
match. "They're playing really well right now." In
fact, the Bruins played well enough to beat No.l
Long Beach last week, handing them only their sec
ond loss of the season.
The ability to sideout, which has contributed
greatly to Stanford's strong season, will be especial
ly critical against UCLA. Although the Cardinal had
some trouble passing the ball in their last few
matches on the Farm, Nieves gained confidence
with yesterday's win.
"One thing that was encouraging was that we
passed so well and got back into our real good side
out game," he commented.
Early in the season, UCLA fell victim to a hungry
Stanford squad, as the Cardinal climbed to their
current No. 2 ranking. The come-from-behind vic
tory featured a record setting performance by Goss,
who scored 55 kills, establishing a new NCAA single
match mark. Setter Canyon Ceman also earned his
place atop the Stanford record books in the contest,
with 114 assists.
The winner of Friday's contest will advance to
the championship match Saturday at 7:30 p.m.,
with the winner of the WIVA tournament qualify
ing for the NCAA Final Four on April 24-25 at
State University in Munchie, IN.
