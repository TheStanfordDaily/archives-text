Popular American Studies lec
turer Richard Gillam, slated to
lose his job as part of budget cuts,
received a reprieve from former
Provost James Rosse Tuesday
and will stay at Stanford for at
least three more years.
Rosse made the decision on his
final day in office, then sent
Gillam a letter informing him of
the three-year reappointment.
Gillam filed an appeal with
Rosse at the beginning of March
after Humanities and Sciences
Dean Ewart Thomas upheld a
decision in February to eliminate
Gillam's position.
The cut was part of an attempt
to slice $600,000 from the budget
of interdisciplinary programs like
American Studies and Human
Biology.
But faculty, students and
alumni campaigned to save
Gillam's job, saying his role as
coordinator of the American
Studies program is crucial and his
knowledge of 20th-century intel
lectual and cultural history is
unique at Stanford.
Students, faculty and alumni
wrote letters to Rosse asking him

to reconsider the possibility of
eliminating Gillam's position.
"I really do deeply appreciate
all that my colleagues and the fac
ulty have done, and particularly
the students," Gillam said. He
called the decision an "imperfect
solution" because he had hoped
for a continuous appointment, but
said it works well for the program.
"My purpose is to make sure
that American Studies continues
to offer the kind of contact and
substantive teaching it has been
offering," Gillam said.
People involved in the campaign
to save Gillam's job responded pos
itively to news of the appointment,
although many said they had
hoped it would be continuous.
"I'm definitely excited about it,"
said American Studies major Linda
Cheu. "I think it shows that stu
dent input can make a difference."
Cheu, who coordinated the let
ter-writing campaign to keep
Gillam at Stanford, said she was
overwhelmed by the input of stu
dents and said it was a large victory
for Gillam and American Studies.
"It was just an absolute battle
for him the whole way," she
added.
Another American Studies
major, junior Tom Kim, said he
was ecstatic about the news of
Gillam's appointment, but also
expressed concern that it was not
continuous.
A lot can change in three years,
Kim said, adding that the atmo
sphere of budget cuts — and the
inevitable shift in priorities when
a new president takes office —
have students and faculty worried
about the future of interdisci
plinary programs. He said he
thinks the situation could become
volatile again.
"In any event, I consider it a
victory," Kim said.
Assoc. English Prof. Jay Fliegel
man, chair of the American Studies
program, said Gillam "enriches the
program considerably."

He said that when the news of
Gillam's elimination was
announced, the faculty involved
with American Studies examined
ways the program could survive
without Gillam and came up with
many new ideas.
He added that some of these
changes may be implemented but
that Gillam will play a large part
in them.
"Overall, it's great to have him
because he does a lot of things that
no one else does," Fliegelman said.
John Cuerva, a 1989 graduate
and former student of Gillam's,
wrote a letter of support to Rosse.
He said he feels that Rosse "heard
loud and clear from faculty, alum
ni and students that Richard
Gillam is an excellent teacher."
He added that he wished
Gillam had been granted a contin
uous appointment but that he felt
the effort to save Gillam's job was
an overall success. "It's a victory
for students, alumni and the

American Studies program," he
said.
Gillam met with Rosse at the
end of last week to discuss his
future and called the meeting
"productive and useful." After
relaying his decision to Gillam,
Rosse left the details to interim
Provost Jerry Lieberman.
The details of Gillam's contin
uance have not been worked out
and Lieberman would not com
ment on the situation until every
thing is finalized.
Rosse, who left office to take a
job with Freedom Newspapers,
Inc., a media chain based in
Southern California, could not be
reached for comment.
Gillam said he doesn't expect
any problems working out the
"small ambiguities." He said he
plans to meet with Lieberman
within the next week.
"This is something I can
accept," Gillam said. "It's time to
move ahead."
