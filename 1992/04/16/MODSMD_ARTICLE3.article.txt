Popular American Studies lec
turer Richard Gillam, slated to
lose his job as part of budget cuts,
received a reprieve from former
Provost James Rosse Tuesday
and will stay at Stanford for at
least three more years.
Rosse made the decision on his
final day in office, then sent
Gillam a letter informing him of
the three-year reappointment.
Gillam filed an appeal with
Rosse at the beginning of March
after Humanities and Sciences
Dean Ewart Thomas upheld a
decision in February to eliminate
Gillam's position.
The cut was part of an attempt
to slice $600,000 from the budget
of interdisciplinary programs like
American Studies and Human
Biology.
But faculty, students and
alumni campaigned to save
Gillam's job, saying his role as
coordinator of the American
Studies program is crucial and his
knowledge of 20th-century intel
lectual and cultural history is
unique at Stanford.
Students, faculty and alumni
wrote letters to Rosse asking him

to reconsider the possibility of
eliminating Gillam's position.
"I really do deeply appreciate
all that my colleagues and the fac
ulty have done, and particularly
the students," Gillam said. He
called the decision an "imperfect
solution" because he had hoped
for a continuous appointment, but
said it works well for the program.
"My purpose is to make sure
that American Studies continues
to offer the kind of contact and
substantive teaching it has been
offering," Gillam said.
People involved in the campaign
to save Gillam's job responded pos
itively to news of the appointment,
although many said they had
hoped it would be continuous.
"I'm definitely excited about it,"
said American Studies major Linda
Cheu. "I think it shows that stu
dent input can make a difference."
Cheu, who coordinated the let
ter-writing campaign to keep
Gillam at Stanford, said she was
overwhelmed by the input of stu
dents and said it was a large victory
for Gillam and American Studies.
"It was just an absolute battle
for him the whole way," she
added.
