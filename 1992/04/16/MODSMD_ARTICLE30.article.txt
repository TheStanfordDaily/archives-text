# Acting controller gets nod for permanent job
## 
### Alain Dalva Staff writer 
Joanne Coville became Univer
sity controller yesterday after a
six-month tenure as acting con
troller, Chief Financial Officer
Peter Van Etten announced in a
statement.
Coville, 41, will manage a 175-
member staff that will trace Uni
versity funds and monitor
accounting systems.
The two-month search to
replace Frank Riddle, who
resigned in October, was limited
to Stanford.
Coville's job as controller in a
university plagued with a budget
deficit may turn out to be "very
complex," according to Reed
Brimhall, director of the Univer
sity's new office of Government
Cost and Rate Studies and a
member of the search commit
tee.
But Brimhall added that Cov
ille handled her job of acting con
troller successfully, especially at
the last year-end closing and
audit, which proved very difficult.
Simultaneously dealing with
the indirect cost controversy,
releasing a tangle of both official
and financial statements and refi
nancing University bonds made
the closing particularly trying,
according to Coville.
Coville said her main challenge
will be to replace and upgrade the
University's present accounting
systems.
"They are very old and very
inflexible," she said, explaining
that these systems, installed in
the mid-19605, are not fit for the
new needs of the 19905.
Coville said the slow current
systems made it difficult to com
plete the last year-end closing in
time. Accounting systems are
generally replaced every 10 or 15
years, she explained, but Stan
ford's have been around for 27

years.
The new systems will have to
provide more frequent financial
status reports and support a
trend toward greater institutional
decentralization, she said.
Coville was hired in 1989 as
assistant controller by then-con
troller Riddle. Before then, she
spent 13 years with the interna
tional accounting firm Peat, Mar
wick and Mitchell, auditing high
er education clients. During her
tenure there, she managed the
University of California's audit
for two years.

Coville said her main
challenge will be to
replace and upgrade
the University's out
dated accounting
systems.

Coville also served as assistant
treasurer at Mills College in Oak
land for a year. She graduated in
1972 from Northern Illinois Uni
versity with a bachelor's degree in
accounting.
Brimhall, whose office of Gov
ernment Cost and Rate Studies is
separate from the Controller's
Office, said he will work in a
"partnership" with Coville on
such matters as internal auditing.
After recent controversies like
the indirect cost issue, Coville
said there is "too much work and
too many challenges" for only one
person.
Known for her sense of humor,
Coville said that without it, "ten
sion and pressure will get to you."
She said she has to maintain an
open attitude and always "try to
find better ways."
