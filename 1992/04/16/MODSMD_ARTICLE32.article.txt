## THE
						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY Hang gliding New wings for Daedalus 
### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
Hang gliding is as old as myth.
It has been synonymous with escape
since the days of the Cretan maze-maker
Daedalus, who was locked in labyrinth by a
vindictive king.
The inventor won his freedom by shaping
giant wings from wax and feathers for him
i self and for Icarus, his son. "Escape may be
1 checked by water and land," Daedalus is
said to have told him, "But the air and the
sky are free."
In the millennia since Daedalus and
Icarus, the walls that bind us have changed.

Now, our labyrinths are cars gridiocked on a
freeway. They are stacks of books in
libraries. They are supermarket aisles.
The sky is still there. But like most
things, it's no longer free. In fact, hang glid
ing is pretty expensive, and it takes the bet
ter part of a weekend to get up in the air. It's
not a sport for the poor in spirit or pocket
book.
Milpitas-based Mission Soaring Center
offers packages for first-time hang gliders
that start at about $70 alter an April dis
count. The "complete pilot plan" runs as
high as $1000. «
