## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY Hang gliding New wings for Daedalus 
### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
Hang gliding is as old as myth.
It has been synonymous with escape
since the days of the Cretan maze-maker
Daedalus, who was locked in labyrinth by a
vindictive king.
The inventor won his freedom by shaping
giant wings from wax and feathers for him
i self and for Icarus, his son. "Escape may be
1 checked by water and land," Daedalus is
said to have told him, "But the air and the
sky are free."
In the millennia since Daedalus and
Icarus, the walls that bind us have changed.

Now, our labyrinths are cars gridiocked on a
freeway. They are stacks of books in
libraries. They are supermarket aisles.
The sky is still there. But like most
things, it's no longer free. In fact, hang glid
ing is pretty expensive, and it takes the bet
ter part of a weekend to get up in the air. It's
not a sport for the poor in spirit or pocket
book.
Milpitas-based Mission Soaring Center
offers packages for first-time hang gliders
that start at about $70 alter an April dis
count. The "complete pilot plan" runs as
high as $1000. «

An instructor
floats off "the
hill" at Scott
Creek, a
beginning
hang-gliding
site on the
beach north
of Santa Cruz.
Expense aside, the sandy
Santa Cruz runways offer an
exhilarating escape from übiqui
tous Stanford sandstone.
Novice hang gliders typically
sign up for a single lesson, which
includes an hour-long instruction
session and four hours of flight on
a stretch of beach off of U.S.
Highway 1.
Beginners spend Saturday
morning in Milpitas watching an
instructional video. Lessons on
"the hill" follow in the afternoon
or early Sunday morning,
depending on wind conditions.
Poor conditions mean classes are
postponed.
At "the hill," a 15-foot slope and
adjacent flat area called Scott Creek,
beginners assemble gliders under
the watchful eyes of their instruc
tors, who insist that each rib, nut,
bolt, string and cable is inspected.
This scrutiny is part of pre-flight
safety procedures that reduce the
chances of mechanical failure.
In addition to the pre-flight
check, pilots are required to wear
snug eggshell-like helmets that
weigh about two pounds each.
The precautions seem to pay
off. Last year, the center's only
casualty was a young girl with a
broken arm — which happened

because she wasn't paying atten
tion, according to a shop employee.
Nationally, nine of the 40,000
recorded participants died. This
means hang gliding is riskier than
being a journalist, but safer than
being a garbage collector, accord
ing to a hang gliding newsletter's
accident statistics.
An assembled hang glider is
shaped like a gargantuan female
mosquito — complete with a
wedge-shaped body that hangs
beneath the wings. Pilots, wear
ing harnesses that look like
umpire padding, are fastened by
their backs to the glider's back
bone, called a keel. A metal clip
secures them to two sturdy
nylon loops dangling from the
glider.
Once hooked in, the pilot
grasps the metal triangle on its
edges, lifts the contraption and
balances into the wind. Balance is
crucial. And in brisk, uneven
gusts, it is difficult.
While the pilot is balancing the
glider, her feet remain on the
sand. She is coached by an
instructor, whom she shares with
one or two other students.
When balance is struck, the
pilot walks, trots, then runs for
ward into the wind. Altitude —
about five to 10 feet in the first
lesson — is achieved by pushing
forward gently on the trapeze.
There are three "points of con
trol" in hang gliding — each hand

and the hips — which are con
nected by straps to the keel.
Pulling hands and hips together
checks altitude, and swinging
side-to-side like a gentle pendu
lum provides lateral motion cru
cial to steering.
Being airborne on a hang glider
is a silent, gentle battle. The pilot
shifts to master the wind that
carves scallops in the sand below.
Unlike most battles, strength
is not a determining factor.
Rather, gentle movements tend
to be the best. Rough manipula
tions make the glider jerk like a
camel.
Hang gliding offers rare unity
between human and machine,
natural and artificial. Neither
grumbling engines nor aluminum
and plastic alienates flesh from
sky. In a car-clogged world, such
harmony is rare
Tandem lessons, during which
a student and instructor fly
together at Mount Tamalpais in
Marin County, are also offered.
The high-altitude flight lasts
about 20-25 minutes.
Prospective tandem pilots are
recommended to take a begin
ner's lesson first — perhaps to
avoid the fate of Icarus, who
plunged to his death after he flew
too close to the sun.

gliding, call the Mission Soaring
Center at (408) 262-1055.

An instructor
floats off "the
hill" at Scott
Creek, a
beginning
hang-gliding
site on the
beach north
of Santa Cruz.
Expense aside, the sandy
Santa Cruz runways offer an
exhilarating escape from übiqui
tous Stanford sandstone.
Novice hang gliders typically
sign up for a single lesson, which
includes an hour-long instruction
session and four hours of flight on
a stretch of beach off of U.S.
Highway 1.
Beginners spend Saturday
morning in Milpitas watching an
instructional video. Lessons on
"the hill" follow in the afternoon
or early Sunday morning,
depending on wind conditions.
Poor conditions mean classes are
postponed.
At "the hill," a 15-foot slope and
adjacent flat area called Scott Creek,
beginners assemble gliders under
the watchful eyes of their instruc
tors, who insist that each rib, nut,
bolt, string and cable is inspected.
This scrutiny is part of pre-flight
safety procedures that reduce the
chances of mechanical failure.
In addition to the pre-flight
check, pilots are required to wear
snug eggshell-like helmets that
weigh about two pounds each.
The precautions seem to pay
off. Last year, the center's only
casualty was a young girl with a
broken arm — which happened

because she wasn't paying atten
tion, according to a shop employee.
Nationally, nine of the 40,000
recorded participants died. This
means hang gliding is riskier than
being a journalist, but safer than
being a garbage collector, accord
ing to a hang gliding newsletter's
accident statistics.
An assembled hang glider is
shaped like a gargantuan female
mosquito — complete with a
wedge-shaped body that hangs
beneath the wings. Pilots, wear
ing harnesses that look like
umpire padding, are fastened by
their backs to the glider's back
bone, called a keel. A metal clip
secures them to two sturdy
nylon loops dangling from the
glider.
Once hooked in, the pilot
grasps the metal triangle on its
edges, lifts the contraption and
balances into the wind. Balance is
crucial. And in brisk, uneven
gusts, it is difficult.
While the pilot is balancing the
glider, her feet remain on the
sand. She is coached by an
instructor, whom she shares with
one or two other students.
When balance is struck, the
pilot walks, trots, then runs for
ward into the wind. Altitude —
about five to 10 feet in the first
lesson — is achieved by pushing
forward gently on the trapeze.
There are three "points of con
trol" in hang gliding — each hand

and the hips — which are con
nected by straps to the keel.
Pulling hands and hips together
checks altitude, and swinging
side-to-side like a gentle pendu
lum provides lateral motion cru
cial to steering.
Being airborne on a hang glider
is a silent, gentle battle. The pilot
shifts to master the wind that
carves scallops in the sand below.
Unlike most battles, strength
is not a determining factor.
Rather, gentle movements tend
to be the best. Rough manipula
tions make the glider jerk like a
camel.
Hang gliding offers rare unity
between human and machine,
natural and artificial. Neither
grumbling engines nor aluminum
and plastic alienates flesh from
sky. In a car-clogged world, such
harmony is rare
Tandem lessons, during which
a student and instructor fly
together at Mount Tamalpais in
Marin County, are also offered.
The high-altitude flight lasts
about 20-25 minutes.
Prospective tandem pilots are
recommended to take a begin
ner's lesson first — perhaps to
avoid the fate of Icarus, who
plunged to his death after he flew
too close to the sun.

Hang gliding is as old as myth.
It has been synonymous with escape
since the days of the Cretan maze-maker
Daedalus, who was locked in labyrinth by a
vindictive king.
The inventor won his freedom by shaping
giant wings from wax and feathers for him
i self and for Icarus, his son. "Escape may be
1 checked by water and land," Daedalus is
said to have told him, "But the air and the
sky are free."
In the millennia since Daedalus and
Icarus, the walls that bind us have changed.

Now, our labyrinths are cars gridiocked on a
freeway. They are stacks of books in
libraries. They are supermarket aisles.
The sky is still there. But like most
things, it's no longer free. In fact, hang glid
ing is pretty expensive, and it takes the bet
ter part of a weekend to get up in the air. It's
not a sport for the poor in spirit or pocket
book.
