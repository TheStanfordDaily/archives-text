# High-voltage 'Cabaret' aims to electrify
## 
### Eric Keppler Staff writer 
Doug Heise looks very much
his part as he sits at the Coffee
House table, sipping a beer that
is dark and European-looking
enough to fit in at the Berlin
cabaret called the Kit Kat Club.
His character, Clifford Brad
shaw, frequents the club in
Ram's Head's forthcoming pro
duction of "Cabaret."
Like everyone else associated
with this project, Heise seemed
excited to talk about it. "This is
the biggest production I've ever
worked on in my life," he said.
Over 100 people are involved
in "Cabaret," and when the cur
tain rises on Friday for opening
night, the audience will watch
the result of an effort that has
been in the works for over a year.
"Cabaret" first appeared as a
Broadway musical in 1966. The
show chronicles a romance
between Bradshaw, a young
American novelist who has come
to Berlin in search of something
to write about, and Sally Bowles,
a British night club singer who
has managed to mire herself in
the seedy world of the Kit Kat
Club in Berlin.
In 1972, Bob Fosse made
"Cabaret" into a film starring
Liza Manelli, and it is that ver
sion that the Ram's Head Pro
duction most closely resembles.
Pretty much everything about
this production is ambitious,
from the massive publicity cam
paign to the over $1000 spent on
paint.
The initial 1966 Broadway
production of "Cabaret" was, in
producer Andrew Shakman's
words, fairly "sanitized" for pub
lic consumption.
Ren6e Nicole, the director of
the Ram's Head version, charac
terizes some past productions of
"Cabaret" as "packaged Broad
way love stories." And, while
there remains some plain old
musical frivolity in the Ram's
Head production, Nicole has

sought to play up the political
subtext to a pretty substantial
degree.
"It's about entertainment not
just as an escape, but a way for
society to talk to itself," she said.
Don't go to "Cabaret" expect
ing a giddy production where the
plot serves as little more than a
bare bones vehicle for Gilbert
and-Sullivan-esque singing and
dancing that register off the
scale on the cheese-o-meter.
It is, in Heise's words, more of
a "play with songs" than it is a
musical. The singing and danc
ing are certainly there, and are

excellent, but this production
has got something to say and is
intent on doing so forcefully.
"Take a good hard look,"
director Nicole requests of the
audience in a foreword to the
program, " 'Cabaret' isn't just
about the Nazi rise to power. It's
about prejudice, economic
despair and the power of a people
to turn and look the other way.
They aren't 60 years distant
from the people I know today."
The directors are not the only
ones who take the content of the
show seriously. "It's interesting
being a Nazi," said Damon Sil

ver, who plays Ernst Ludwig,
"since I'm Jewish."
Silver says he was very
uncomfortable at first wearing a
swastika, but eventually decided
that he'd rather "confront the
issues than turn away from
them."
The musical begins innocu
ously enough with a scene from
the Kit Kat Club, where much of
the action takes place. The open
ing act, with the exception of a
couple of foreboding scenes, is
largely apolitical and one won-

ders where the promised "mes
sage" is. We see plenty of the sex
ually permissive nature of 1930s
Berlin, but not much of its poli
tics.
As the second act begins, how
ever, the political element creeps
in with a little more clarity. At
about its halfway point,
"Cabaret" has developed a palpa
bly sinister inertia, and the deca
dence that was merely amusing in
the first act becomes revolting as
the personal becomes political.
We see how the permissiveness .
that characterizes 1930s Berlin
can have political as well as sexu
al manifestations: "The Nazis are
just a gang of stupid hooligans,"

contends one character. "Let
them get rid of the communists,
later we'll be able to control
them." Anything goes, sexually,
socially and politically.
The show is also artistically
ambitious. Set designers David
Andre and Lisa Clark have co
opted five dark, expression istic
German paintings of the period
and transformed them into a col
lage of a set that whirls and jack
knifes spectacularly during the
show to become alternately a
hotel, a train cabin, Cliff Brad
shaw's room and the Kit Kat
Club. Impressive.
Suttirat Anne Larlarb de
signed the costumes for the show.
All 97 of them. "This was the first
show I've worked on where I
didn't have to sacrifice my
designs for a budget," she said. So
you can expect spectacular, some

times spectacularly racy, cos
tumes.
Ram's Head's big spring musi
cals are generally of excellent
quality. With stellar perfor
mances by Michael Magnaye, who
plays the Kit Kat Club's impish,
licentious MC with brilliant per
versity, and I liana Zauderer, who
you'll recognize if you saw "One
Bad Apple" or "Into the Woods"
last year, there is certainly no rea
son to expect otherwise this year.
"Cabaret" looks to have the
kind of electricity that live the
ater, when it is particularly well
done, can.

"Cabaret" will run April 17-18
and 23-25 at 8 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium. Tickets are $7 for
students, and can be purchased at
the Tresidder Ticket Office; call
723-0801 for more information.


The work of more than 100 people, along with a hefty budget and over a year of planning, has gone into
Ram's Head's "Cabaret." Performances of this ambitious production begin Friday.
