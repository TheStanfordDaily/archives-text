Is it just by coincidence that Will Nulpart waits
until this final, pathos-laden episode of his brief
career to introduce us to his parents? I don't
think so.

Editor's note: This is the final
installment of a short story
appearing in Intermission.

I needed to go home. Maybe
my parents would understand
me. After all, it if wasn't for me,
they would never come together.
Just like old times, the three of
us sat in that huge, vastly vacant,
shadowy dining room in front of a
cold turkey.
"Well, son," Dominic Nulpart
broke the monotony of clinking
utensils, chewing food and swal
lowing wine, "How's school
going?"
"All right, I guess," I answered,
slowly cutting up the meat.
"Yes, dear. How is â€” now what
exactly is it again that you're
studying?" Majorie Nulpart asked.
"Philosophy," I gulped my wine
down and served myself some
more.
"Just what exactly do you plan
to after graduation, son?"
"I'm not sure."
"Surely, dear, you must have
some idea? Well, it's silly to ask,
but how do you plan to live?"
"Oh, let the boy be, Majorie."
He reached for the bottle to pour
himself some more wine, but she
also reached out and pushed it
away from him. He stood up,
grabbed the bottle, served himself
and set it down next to his plate.
"I believe Will is old enough by
now to know that we can't sup
port him forever. That pretty
soon he'll have his own home,
bills to pay and hopefully a family
to fend for. But just what do
philosophers do?"
"You know, dear, I just

remembered a friend who told me
that she once knew a philosopher.
He would just spend all of his
time locked up in a run-down
shack eating raw cabbage soup."
Dominic reached out for
another slice of turkey, but
Majorie threatened to fork his
hand with a stinging look.
My hands started to shake so I
put them under the table. "Dad,
Mom, excuse me, but I'm not feel
ing too well. And Dad, Mom, I
love you."
I went to my old room and fell
to the floor, digging my hands
into my stomach; imaginary
blades were being shoved into it.
When the pain had subsided, I
packed my things to head back to
school. I spent the rest of the
night at the train station.
I was sitting on the dock, rock
ing back and forth just waiting for
my train, when a threadbare,
urine-and-whiskey-reeking bum
sat down next to me and asked me
for a dollar.
He must have been young
under all that fur and scum, and
he must have lost his equally
young wife to a tragic car accident
and because he loved her so much
he tried to drink the pain away
but it would only come back
stronger every time.
I got up, told him to fuck off,
and walked over to the edge of the
dock. The train was approaching
and as it neared, I became queasy
