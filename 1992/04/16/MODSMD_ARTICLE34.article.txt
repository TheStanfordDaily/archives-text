# 'Blessed are the poor in spirit...

Is it just by coincidence that Will Nulpart waits
until this final, pathos-laden episode of his brief
career to introduce us to his parents? I don't
think so.

Editor's note: This is the final
installment of a short story
appearing in Intermission.

I needed to go home. Maybe
my parents would understand
me. After all, it if wasn't for me,
they would never come together.
Just like old times, the three of
us sat in that huge, vastly vacant,
shadowy dining room in front of a
cold turkey.
"Well, son," Dominic Nulpart
broke the monotony of clinking
utensils, chewing food and swal
lowing wine, "How's school
going?"
"All right, I guess," I answered,
slowly cutting up the meat.
"Yes, dear. How is — now what
exactly is it again that you're
studying?" Majorie Nulpart asked.
"Philosophy," I gulped my wine
down and served myself some
more.
"Just what exactly do you plan
to after graduation, son?"
"I'm not sure."
"Surely, dear, you must have
some idea? Well, it's silly to ask,
but how do you plan to live?"
"Oh, let the boy be, Majorie."
He reached for the bottle to pour
himself some more wine, but she
also reached out and pushed it
away from him. He stood up,
grabbed the bottle, served himself
and set it down next to his plate.
"I believe Will is old enough by
now to know that we can't sup
port him forever. That pretty
soon he'll have his own home,
bills to pay and hopefully a family
to fend for. But just what do
philosophers do?"
"You know, dear, I just

remembered a friend who told me
that she once knew a philosopher.
He would just spend all of his
time locked up in a run-down
shack eating raw cabbage soup."
Dominic reached out for
another slice of turkey, but
Majorie threatened to fork his
hand with a stinging look.
My hands started to shake so I
put them under the table. "Dad,
Mom, excuse me, but I'm not feel
ing too well. And Dad, Mom, I
love you."
I went to my old room and fell
to the floor, digging my hands
into my stomach; imaginary
blades were being shoved into it.
When the pain had subsided, I
packed my things to head back to
school. I spent the rest of the
night at the train station.
I was sitting on the dock, rock
ing back and forth just waiting for
my train, when a threadbare,
urine-and-whiskey-reeking bum
sat down next to me and asked me
for a dollar.
He must have been young
under all that fur and scum, and
he must have lost his equally
young wife to a tragic car accident
and because he loved her so much
he tried to drink the pain away
but it would only come back
stronger every time.
I got up, told him to fuck off,
and walked over to the edge of the
dock. The train was approaching
and as it neared, I became queasy

and started to lean forward. In
fact, I was about to fall into the
tracks when two arms wrapped
around me and brought me back
down onto the dock. I was so
dazed that I hadn't noticed the
stench. It was the bum, and he
said to me, "No, fuck you."
The whole ride up to Hoopla
College, trees, plains and moun
tains tried to jump out at me from
the scenery, but they were all a
part of the same wasteland, tied
down to it by gravity with
nowhere to go, until I drew the
shade down.
The acid in my stomach and
the electrical storm in my head
confined me to my apartment for
the most part of day and night. I
imagined myself moribund, and
although I had become an atheist
like every good wanna-be intellec
tual, I thought it only proper to go
and confess.
What intellectuals refuse to
believe is that man is as limited by
his intellect as he is by his body;
the intellectual overlooks man's
soul, for only through his soul can
he achieve immortality, the possi
bility of being like God. After all,
isn't that what man ultimately
wants and strives for? (Hypocrisy:
man's true nature.)
I hadn't been to church since
my first communion. At the time,
I felt a fire burning up my heart
as I took the host, for I promised
God I would be a good Christian
and put up with the burden of life.
But now, I felt only the draft in
that cavernous hollow. I sat in the
back hearing some pray, others

gossip. A priest came out and
started mass. Just before commu
nion, a woman in a long white
gown, her reddish hair disheveled,
ran out in front, her expression
bewildered. "Je suis Jesu. Je suis
le chemin." She spread her arms
out onto an imaginary cross and
said, "Repent! The end is near!"
The priest escorted her out
while women in black in the front
pews began to wail, and a para
plegic on the side began to wave his
fist. I hadn't noticed, but a tear was
rolling down my cheek.
I wanted to be paraplegic or
blind or deaf or mute or whatever it
took because only they endured
true suffering and still kept trying

to live despite that fact — perfect
martyrs.
So I took out my knife and
carved into the palm of my right
hand because I wanted God to see
me suffer, that I could be perfect
too, and then I plunged it into the
palm of my other hand to com
plete the pair.
But the Holy Spirit didn't
descend on me as I lay there
bleeding on the pew. I could have
lain there until I died; it wouldn't
have made a difference. So I ran
out of the church and tumbled
down the grassy hill it was on.
I lay still at the bottom, staring
up at the sun, the sky pressing me
down.
