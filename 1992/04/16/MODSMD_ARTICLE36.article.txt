# 'Sale' on Palo Alto's sea of bargains
## 
### Sean Etigson Staff writer 
Cruising out the door on a Saturday morn
ing, a young man shouts to his roommate,
"See you later. I'm going sailing on Bryant
Street."
The roommate does not even flinch over his
Malt-O-Meal — he's one of the initiated.
Garage sale-ing is the passion of the greater
Palo Alto community.
From desperate graduate students looking
for dishes to older residents looking for a
pleasant way to pass the morning, sidewalk
sales cater to utilitarian as well as entertain
ment needs.
"We've been sale-ing for about 23 years,"
says an elderly woman, elbowing her husband.
"We started doing it for the great deals you
can get — books and records and things. Now,
though, we just come to chat with people and
see what's out."
Some residents view garage sales as a way
to redistribute junk and avert outright
waste.
A frequent host of g-sales, Frank Greer
explains, "It's so much better than throwing
all the stuff away. And the beauty of it is,
sometimes you help somebody find something
that they've actually been looking for in the
stores."
During the fall and spring, when knick
knacks and stray furniture fumble their way
out of cluttered houses, there's a garage sale
on every corner.
Because of the mild Palo Alto weather,
though, the season stretches across the whole
calendar. (Last year, a few diehards were out
trying to do their Christmas shopping on an
early December morning.)
As we sit in the bloom of the spring season,
a short guide is in order for those who have
not yet partaken of these bacchanalian specta
cles of bargains.
Where to look
There are several options. If you're feeling
a Zen wind blowing, get on a bike and cruise
some main streets looking for signs or sales. If
your faith has been shaken and your time is
short, look in the Palo Alto Weekly, which lists
many sales for each upcoming weekend.
How to act
Bear in mind that these are normal people,
under most circumstances. Once they see or
smell a deal, though, they become bargain
thirsty heathens.

"I've literally been body-checked by little
old ladies," admits Stanford graduate Gwyn
Gordon.
The important technique, then, is to hold
onto whatever might be of interest. Other
wise, that sticky-fingered lady with the
squeaky voice will be paying for your frying
pan before the handle is cold.
How to barter
Enjoy a game in which everything is nego
tiable. Deals work well in tandem, such as pay
ing for the picture frame, the wok and the

records for the low, low price of $3.
One garage sale host remarked, "The peo
ple who go to garage sales are the people who
know how to give them. It's not about making
money."
And what, exactly, is garage sale-ing about?
Some would say it's about rebirth and renew
al, about giving new life to old junk — recy
cling.
But, since this is the garage sale capital of
the world, you can choke down the hot break
fast cereal of your choice this Saturday and
find out for yourself.
