# Bus driver-to-be pines for prodigious past
## 
### 
Well, this is it. I graduated last quarter,
and won't be a senior again for anoth
er 44 years.
After 11 quarters and a somewhat larger
number of dollars, I know all sorts of things I
didn't know four years ago. I know how to
learn ten weeks' worth of information in a
night and forget it all the next evening. I know
how to tap a keg. I know who won the Super
bowl in '91. I know Scott Crabill. But I still
don't have a clue what I'm doing with my life.
Not that that's what college is all about or
anything.
You gotta understand, I really really really
tried to find a job. But it's tough, especially in
an economy which has been "on the verge of
recovery" for over eight months now.
Fall quarter, I trudged over to that CCCP
place to see what they could do for me. I took
a personality test that told me I would make a
perfect bus driver. And I got an allotment of
points which I could use to "bid" against other
students for the limited job interviews that
take place on campus.
"What kinds of jobs?"
"Oh, all kinds. Jobs like consulting, and
investment banking..."
"And?"
"And . .. well, consulting. . . (Ahem.)"
"I don't suppose we can use these points to
buy Kimball pizzas?"
I asked the staff just what a consultant
does, anyway. Nobody seemed to know. I
asked some of the interviewers what you do in
consulting, and why the country seems to
need so many of them. They kindly pointed me
to the employment folder listing the local bus
companies.
I checked the Socrates/Folio databank for
jobs or internships that would suit the few
preferences I have. After a bit of typing, I got
this printout:

Stupid computer. So I applied to the Teach
for America program, and bribed a TA friend
to write a glowing academic reference (a la
"Cheat for America"). Boom. Rejected.
I started to get nervous. Was I destined,
after four years at Stanford, to return home,
unemployed and live with my (gasp) parents?
Sitting around all day unshaven and fat,
watching "Whiz Kids" re-runs? Spending my
nights cruising the video stores, looking for
copies of "Clue" with endings I haven't seen
yet?
Never, I swore. So I've done what any star
ry-eyed, egotistical graduate with a few free
months would do and started a book. They say
you gotta have a lot of pretentiousness to
write a book straight out of college, but I know
I've got what it takes.
I thought I'd have trouble disciplining
myself, but I've actually discovered quite a

productive routine. Every day at 8 a.m., my
alarm rings. I immediately throw it against
the wall, and sometime before the cafeteria
closes at 1 p.m., wake up for lunch.
Then (here's the creative part) I dream up
an excuse to go to White Plaza, such as
"Wasn't I supposed to hear from Publishers'
Clearinghouse today?" or "Gosh, I could real
ly use some ankle-jewelry" and hang out there
for a while, telling friends I'm writing a book.
Once five or six people promise to buy it
when it comes out, I go to Tower and purchase
a CD with my projected earnings. I haven't
written all that much yet, but the two new
Springsteens sound great.
The toughest part is actually getting used
to this "artiste" role I have to play now. This
means that as a writer, every night I'm
required to dress up in black, hang out in back
of the Coffee House, wave my arms around
wildly and talk in a foreign accent about the
latest issue of SF Weekly to a bunch of
drugged-out disciples.
But being a writer has its benefits. I'm
looking forward to hanging out in sleazy bars,
sliding up to strange women and using the
pick-up line, "You believe people should love
each author, right?"
I'd never have guessed, way back when in
my youthful college days, that this is what I'd
be doing now. But it's actually nothing new.
When I was in first grade, I stapled a few
sheets of that thin gray paper together and
wrote a tale called, "The Masked Marvel vs.
The Blob." It was a stellar epic, filled with
vivid Crayola illustrations and bold text writ
ten on lines that look like this:

It was a smash. The public embraced me,
hailed me as a genius. I read it to the kinder
garten class next door, and they called it a

"And?"
"And . .. well, consulting. . . (Ahem.)"
"I don't suppose we can use these points to
buy Kimball pizzas?"
I asked the staff just what a consultant
does, anyway. Nobody seemed to know. I
asked some of the interviewers what you do in
consulting, and why the country seems to
need so many of them. They kindly pointed me
to the employment folder listing the local bus
companies.
I checked the Socrates/Folio databank for
jobs or internships that would suit the few
preferences I have. After a bit of typing, I got

Stupid computer. So I applied to the Teach
for America program, and bribed a TA friend
to write a glowing academic reference (a la
"Cheat for America"). Boom. Rejected.
I started to get nervous. Was I destined,
after four years at Stanford, to return home,
unemployed and live with my (gasp) parents?
Sitting around all day unshaven and fat,
watching "Whiz Kids" re-runs? Spending my
nights cruising the video stores, looking for
copies of "Clue" with endings I haven't seen
yet?
Never, I swore. So I've done what any star
ry-eyed, egotistical graduate with a few free
months would do and started a book. They say
you gotta have a lot of pretentiousness to
write a book straight out of college, but I know
I've got what it takes.
I thought I'd have trouble disciplining
myself, but I've actually discovered quite a

productive routine. Every day at 8 a.m., my
alarm rings. I immediately throw it against
the wall, and sometime before the cafeteria
closes at 1 p.m., wake up for lunch.
Then (here's the creative part) I dream up
an excuse to go to White Plaza, such as
"Wasn't I supposed to hear from Publishers'
Clearinghouse today?" or "Gosh, I could real
ly use some ankle-jewelry" and hang out there
for a while, telling friends I'm writing a book.
Once five or six people promise to buy it
when it comes out, I go to Tower and purchase
a CD with my projected earnings. I haven't
written all that much yet, but the two new
Springsteens sound great.
The toughest part is actually getting used
to this "artiste" role I have to play now. This
means that as a writer, every night I'm
required to dress up in black, hang out in back
of the Coffee House, wave my arms around
wildly and talk in a foreign accent about the
latest issue of SF Weekly to a bunch of
drugged-out disciples.
But being a writer has its benefits. I'm
looking forward to hanging out in sleazy bars,
sliding up to strange women and using the
pick-up line, "You believe people should love
each author, right?"
I'd never have guessed, way back when in
my youthful college days, that this is what I'd
be doing now. But it's actually nothing new.
When I was in first grade, I stapled a few
sheets of that thin gray paper together and
wrote a tale called, "The Masked Marvel vs.
The Blob." It was a stellar epic, filled with
vivid Crayola illustrations and bold text writ
ten on lines that look like this:

It was a smash. The public embraced me,
hailed me as a genius. I read it to the kinder
garten class next door, and they called it a

THANK GOD FOR HARRIS!
Well, this is it. I graduated last quarter,
and won't be a senior again for anoth
er 44 years.
After 11 quarters and a somewhat larger
number of dollars, I know all sorts of things I
didn't know four years ago. I know how to
learn ten weeks' worth of information in a
night and forget it all the next evening. I know
how to tap a keg. I know who won the Super
bowl in '91. I know Scott Crabill. But I still
don't have a clue what I'm doing with my life.
Not that that's what college is all about or
anything.
You gotta understand, I really really really
tried to find a job. But it's tough, especially in
an economy which has been "on the verge of
recovery" for over eight months now.
Fall quarter, I trudged over to that CCCP
place to see what they could do for me. I took
a personality test that told me I would make a
perfect bus driver. And I got an allotment of
points which I could use to "bid" against other
students for the limited job interviews that
take place on campus.
"What kinds of jobs?"
"Oh, all kinds. Jobs like consulting, and
investment banking..."
"And?"
"And . .. well, consulting. . . (Ahem.)"
"I don't suppose we can use these points to
buy Kimball pizzas?"
