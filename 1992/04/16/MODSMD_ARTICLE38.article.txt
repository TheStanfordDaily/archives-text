to go/ Though, a face to a voice,

Talent was just going to waste

â€” En Vogue's "It Ain't Over
Till The Fat Lady Sings"
Back in 1990, four fine
young sistas single-handedly
saved black music from the
Martha Wash ghost vocal
nemesis. "Hold On," En
Vogue's first smash single,
soulfully reworked both James
Brown's raw funk standard
"The Big Payback" and the
Jackson Five's classic "Who's
Lovin You."
It was the first song in a long
time that featured real singing,
perfect four-part harmony (a
capella no less), and a mother
lode of hip-hop attitude and
feeling.
The realness of the track
appealed to the rap producers,
who incorporated the groove
into the structure of hardcore
rap like they had done with
Cheryl Lynn's "To Be Real"
and Chic's "Good Times" years

before. Few groups before or
since have had the ability to
maintain wide street respect
without sacrificing crossover
potential.

When it comes to
raw talent, elegance,
ambiance, and drop
dead beauty, En
Vouge breaks the
mold.

The Supremes of the Hip-
Hop Nation are back.
En Vogue has released
"Funky Divas," a solid follow
up to their multi-platinum
debut, "Born To Sing." When it
comes to raw talent, elegance,
ambiance and drop-dead beau
ty, En Vouge breaks the mold.
Few groups, with the excep
tion of Boyz II Men and Ex-
Girlfriend, have the ability to
blend melodious singing, fierce
hip-hop grooves and sultry bal
lads all into one tight package.
