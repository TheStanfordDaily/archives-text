â€” En Vogue's "It Ain't Over
Till The Fat Lady Sings"
Back in 1990, four fine
young sistas single-handedly
saved black music from the
Martha Wash ghost vocal
nemesis. "Hold On," En
Vogue's first smash single,
soulfully reworked both James
Brown's raw funk standard
"The Big Payback" and the
Jackson Five's classic "Who's
Lovin You."
It was the first song in a long
time that featured real singing,
perfect four-part harmony (a
capella no less), and a mother
lode of hip-hop attitude and
feeling.
The realness of the track
appealed to the rap producers,
who incorporated the groove
into the structure of hardcore
rap like they had done with
Cheryl Lynn's "To Be Real"
and Chic's "Good Times" years

before. Few groups before or
since have had the ability to
maintain wide street respect
without sacrificing crossover
potential.

When it comes to
raw talent, elegance,
ambiance, and drop
dead beauty, En
Vouge breaks the
mold.

The Supremes of the Hip-
Hop Nation are back.
En Vogue has released
"Funky Divas," a solid follow
up to their multi-platinum
debut, "Born To Sing." When it
comes to raw talent, elegance,
ambiance and drop-dead beau
ty, En Vouge breaks the mold.
Few groups, with the excep
tion of Boyz II Men and Ex-
Girlfriend, have the ability to
blend melodious singing, fierce
hip-hop grooves and sultry bal
lads all into one tight package.

masterpiece. Jenny Brennan
finally let me kiss her.
My success caused a flurry of
cheap imitation books in my
class, and even Tim Kennedy,
voted "most likely to grow up to
be a coke-addict or serial-killer,"
decided to write a book, un
daunted by the cries of nay-say -
ers who kept reminding him that
he didn't even know how to read.
I don't know how his book
came out; all I remember is him
going up to our teacher and ask
ing, "How d'yuh spell 'The Vil
lage People?' "
Alas, my fame was not to

endure. Maybe it was the pres
sure. Maybe it was the drugs.
Maybe it was the fact that
Jenny Brennan never really
came around after that first
smooch.
But like Orson Welles, Tracy
Chapman and the Hooters, I've
never been able to match that
first success of mine. Sure, I write
these articles, and everyone gives
me the same canned response:
"Oh Chris, that's, uh, pretty
good. Funny. Thoughtful. I like
it."
But I know what they're really
thinking, I know what they're
saying behind my back: "Gosh,
you know, he's just never really
had it since 'The Masked Marvel
vs. The Blob.'" I'm just another
washed-up child prodigy.

But now I'm back, and in the
hopes that quantity can make up
for quality, my second book
should be about 230 times longer
than my first.
The subject? An anti-travel
book, modeled after "Let's Go
Europe," called "Don't Go
Europe." Sure, it's not quite a
novel idea, but that's OK: It's not
quite a novel yet. And if every
single one of you promises to buy
a copy, then I can go get that new
R&B boxed set I've had my eye
on for some time.

Should his book fail, Chris Har
ris is currently training for mem
bership in the elite corps of Grey
hound bus drivers. This means
he could be a lowly driver all his
life with nothing to chauffeur it.
