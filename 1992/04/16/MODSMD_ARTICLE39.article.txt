# 'Raise The Red Lantern' tells evocative tale of oppression
## 
### Paul Curthoys Editorial staff 
Every evening, Songlian stands patiently outside
her door along with the other three wives of her hus
band and master, waiting to learn where the ser
vants will place the red lantern indicating where the
master has decided to sleep.
The entire film is concentrated within that single
mansion, focusing on the machinations of the wives
as they struggle to outwit each other in a competi
tion for their husband's attention. Despite a limita
tion that might seem to confine the film, the spare
ness of "Raise The Red Lantern" allowed Chinese
director Zhang Yimou to fashion a startlingly beau
tiful masterpiece.
As the film opens, Songlian (Gong Li) chooses to
abandon her college career in favor of marrying an
old master of a powerful family.
During her first month in her new home, she
forces herself to remain aloof from the contest for
the master's favors. As the newest and youngest
wife, he generally spends most of his evenings with
her anyway.
However, when she discovers that her servant
Yan'er (Kong Lin) and one of the other wives are
plotting to engineer her destruction, her feelings of

anger and betrayal sweep her into the game of
deceit and counter-deceit that consumes the wives.
In this traditional household, the more attention a
wife can garner from the husband, the more power
she holds.
Much of the impact of this film arises from the
constraints of the setting; by locking both Songlian
and the cameramen in the mansion, Yimou vividly
draws the audience into the oppression the women
suffer.
Just as the walls become tiresome borders for
Songlian, more like bars of a prison cell than walls of
a happy home, the unwavering, static setting affects
the audience in a similar manner. What would nor
mally be an enormous weakness instead becomes
one of the strongest aspects of the film.
Visually, "Raise The Red Lantern" is stunning.
Every minutia, from the costumes to the furniture
in the background, is striking. One of the wives is
played by He Caifei, one of China's most renowned
opera actresses, and her melodious voice colors
many of the scenes of the film.
From beginning to end, this portrayal of a
woman's struggle against the oppressive clutch of
her husband and her surroundings grips at both the
eyes and the heart, and promises and evening of fine
entertainment.
