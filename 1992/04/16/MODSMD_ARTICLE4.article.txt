# Kennedy begins trek toward 'real world'
## He pitches students to join his new Washington environment program 
### John Ford Staff writer 
Squeezing in the time to plan
his return to the "real world,"
University President Donald
Kennedy spoke to approximately
30 students yesterday about the
environmental program he will
lead at Stanford in Washington.
"I think I bring something to
the party," Kennedy told the
crowd at the informational meet
ing, adding, "I think my connec
tions are still good enough" to
attract speakers for the program.
Kennedy will be leading a semi
nar during winter quarter on envi
ronmental science and policy. It will
be the first time Stanford in Wash
ington's winter quarter is devoted
primarily to environmental issues.
Besides teaching at the Wash
ington campus, Kennedy plans to
get involved in the selection of
students for the environmental
program. After the initial cut, he
said he will give input and con
duct some of the interviews of
final candidates.
It's a "wonderful opportunity
to reenter the real world,"

Kennedy said.
After his speech, he said he has
been planning to get back into
teaching since mid- to late sum
mer. Although he has been "eager
for the chance to get re-engaged
in academic life," Kennedy said,
he still has not had time to pre
pare for his move to Washington.
"There has been no chance to
ease out" of the presidency, he said,
noting the amount of time he has to
devote to his current position. "I
have had to squeeze in the plan
ning" for the Stanford in Washing
ton venture, Kennedy said.
He is looking forward to teach
ing and living with the students
in the program, since he expects
"a lot of intellectual stimulation,
different views, and some fun" —
the same things he gets from stu
dents right now, he said.
Angie Chung, a junior, said
Kennedy's presence in the program
is a "definite bonus," although she
had planned to attend Stanford in
Washington before she heard about
his involvement.
Junior Wendy Kevan said
Kennedy's name also attracted
her to the program at first. She
added that she was surprised the
crowd was not larger.
Kennedy also mentioned that
he is considering playing a role at
the Institute for International
Studies at Stanford. At a Faculty
Senate meeting last week,
Kennedy said he attempted to
develop support for the institute
during a recent visit to Singapore.
