# Dark French film tries to draw laughs from a cannibalistic future

### Travis Farr 
In their new film "Deli
catessen," Jean-Pierre Jeunet
and Marc Caro have no qualms
about throwing reality to the
winds as they attempt to examine
basic human nature in disastrous
circumstances.
The strange story takes place
in a decaying and isolated build
ing at some point in the future
when an unseen something has
destroyed civilization as we know
it. When the last of the rats were
gone, the building occupants
turned to human flesh for nour
ishment.
The movie starts with attention
grabbing foreshadowing as the
unbalanced-looking butcher sharp
ens his gleaming cleaver.
His customers, who all live in
the crumbling building above the
delicatessen, are themselves no
candidates for good mental health
awards. There's Monsieur. Potin,
for example, who coexists happily
in his damp room with hundreds
of snails and small frogs, who are
his companions and alternate

source of food.
Into this madness arrives Loui
son, an ex-circus clown. He comes
responding to an ad in the paper,
and it soon becomes apparent
that he is a "recruit" intended for
more culinary purposes than his
job as janitor would suggest.

The building occu
pants turned to
human flesh for
nourishment.

Almost immediately, the
butcher's beautiful daughter
Julie falls in love with the gentle
newcomer. Aware of the danger
her love is in, Julie enlists the
help of sewer-dwelling rebels to
rescue Louison.
As Julie and Louison try to
make their escape, a battle
ensues between the butcher and
tenants on one side and the
rebels on the other.

This movie's main problem
lies in its lack of immediacy,
since these characters are impos
sible to relate to on a real level.
The writers try to emphasize
the power of love even in dire cir
cumstances, but the sheer
bizarreness of the characters
prevents you from feeling their
emotions or even believing that
they feel them.
The movie also contradicts
itself in message: While the
butcher comes to realize through
Louison that he is not naturally
or totally evil, he still attempts to
carry out his carnivorous plans.
In this sense, the movie has a
moral climax that occurs fully
half an hour before the action cli
maxes, and that detracts from
the movie's coherence.
The characters are crazy
enough to be funny, and this
weird humor is probably the
movie's strongest point. That
and inventive cinematography
are enough to keep "Deli
catessen" from being boring, but
the movie unfortunately doesn't
manage to inspire.
