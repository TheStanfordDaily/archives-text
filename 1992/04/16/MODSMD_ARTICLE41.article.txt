# The 						Supremes of the hip-hop nation

### Continued from page 3 
Even the hardest of the hardcore hip
hop junkies will admit a soft spot for
this group.
For the most part, "Funky Divas"
maintains the high standards set by
the group's debut. Producers Denzel
Foster and Thomas McElroy continue
to supply the girls with a cadre of hard
core hip-hop beats and basslines, while
also managing to conjure up ballads
and remakes of classics tailor-made for
the divas' style of singing.
Even unadulterated rap, rock 'n'
roll, reggae and house music end up in
the mix. While this sophomore effort
isn't without its flaws, it definitely
packs enough of a punch to remind the
listener that these girls aren't one-hit
wonders (a la The Good Girls or Seduc
tion).
"My Lovin' (No You're Never Gonna
Get It)" is another variation on "J.B's
Payback" groove. It's typical (meaning
funkee) En Vouge; soulful, impas
sioned singing matched with a hip-hop
groove that won't upset the sensibili
ties of the hardcore hip-hop fan. The
song can't match the intensity of "Hold
On," but then again, what can?
"Hip-Hop Lover" and "Free Your
Mind" keep the album moving along
but detract slightly from the focus.
"Hip" is notable only for the group's
clever rendition of the background cho
rus from Aretha FYanklin's "Spanish
Harlem"; the sorry guest rap by Wayne
Jackson almost makes one miss
"Mocedes the Mellow" from Tony,
Toni, Tone's "Feel Good" single.

"Free Your Mind" is a foray into
rock 'n' roll completely unsuited for
the group, reminiscent of Janet Jack
son's "Black Cat." While the song has a
great message, black rock is better left
to the black rockers (i.e. Living Colour
and Eye and I).

While this sophomore
effort isn't without its
flaws, it definitely
packs enough of a
punch to remind the
listener that these
girls aren't one-hit
wonders.

Only towards the middle does the
album begin to take on a distinctive
shape and move away from formulaic
regurgitation. "Desire," with its clever
sample of the disco classic "Love Hang
over," is one of the best cuts on the
album.
Both of the Curtis Mayfield remakes
"Givin' Him Something He Can Feel"
and "Hooked On Your Love" are fabu
lous â€” no corn, just the sounds of sul
try singing matched with sparse, yet
solid, instrumentation.
"It Ain't Over Till The Fat Lady
Sings" is another phat groove, featur
ing the four divas rapping about them

selves. They aren't the next Brand
Nubian, but the roughness of the
track, matched with their attitude, gets
them over.
The five minutes of "Give It Up,
Turn It Loose" are perhaps the most
enjoyable of the album; the jam is the
catchiest thing since its Debarge prede
cessor, "I Like It,"from which it takes
its inspiration. If released, "Give It"
will be a huge single.
Only towards the end do "Yester
day"and "Love Don't Love You"
momentarily detract from the musical
merits of this half of the album. While
the former is momentarily soulful,
Paul, John, Ringo, and George have
nothing to worry about.
"Love Don't" also isn't bad, but just
doesn't pack as much punch as other
cuts on the effort. "What is Love," a
house groove, ends the album on a
rather funky, upbeat note and will also
be a commercial success.
As a cohesive whole, "Funky Divas"
lives up to its name. While some songs
aren't as solid as others, the Curtis
Mayfield remakes, along with hip-hop
flavored productions like "Desire" and
"It Ain't Over ..." work incredibly
well.
This album is definitely worth the
purchase and will garner enough hit
singles to keep Dawn, Cindy, Maxine
and Terry superstars far into the
future. Either way, the promotional
photos from the press kit are going on
my wall, 'cause these sistas are the
finest women on the planet!
Check the album out at Tower while
I make myself scarce. Peace.
