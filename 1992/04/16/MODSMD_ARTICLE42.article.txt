# Reggae trio blends tough lyrics with uplifting instrumentals

With a poetic mysticism and a
gentle chuckle, Joseph Hill says he
was chosen at a young age to
spread his peaceful Rastafarian
philosophy to the rest of the world.
"You see, I really see things,"
said Hill, lead singer of the
Jamaican reggae trio Culture, by
phone last week. "Reason being, I
looks like every other child, but
I'm not like every other child.
Each child on this earth was born
at the end of nine months. I am
different. I was born at the end of
13 months."
Perhaps this is the source of
Hill's power to repeatedly counter
injustice and repression at home in
Jamaica and the rest of the world
with a universal message of hope
and equal rights. Backed by vocal
ists Albert Walker and Kenneth
Dayes, Hill cries out his serious pol
itics amid an upbeat rub-a-dub
sound that includes an infectious
beat and wandering, wondrous key
boards.
"If you notice what we sing, it's
not a sad song, it's not a glad
song," said Hill, describing his mix
of tough lyrics and uplifting
instrumentals. "I think everybody
needs a little cheer up. Those are
songs to get you aware of the
defining factors that overhang
everybody."
"Reggae happens every day.
Not just the playing of the music,
but the action which the music
speaks of," said Hill, adding in his
prophetic and gently lilting voice,
"We speak that we can give priori

ty to the future. I speak without
ending."
Culture formed in 1976, when
legendary producer Joe Gibbs took
on the group, resulting in the now
classic album "Two Sevens Clash"
in 1977.
Along with other harmony trios
like the Wailers and the Heptones,
the group continued to be an influ
ence in the roots sound with more
albums until the members parted
ways in 1981.
The original Culture reunited
in 1986 with "Culture and Work,"
an album produced by rhythm
gurus Sly Dunbar and Robbie
Shakespeare and backed by the
Roots Radics. Since that time, a
string of tight recordings has
emerged to chant down drugs, war
and ongoing divisions between
rich and poor.
"All the time I'm being
inspired," said Hill, pausing and
then then speaking in the cosmic
but sober repetition of many of his
songs, "You know, it's not sudden
inspiration or no overnight dream.
The whole thing is that we see new
children getting into adults. We are
seeing more babies joining the
human race. We are seeing people
taking more drugs. We are seeing
people eating less and drinking
more alcohol. It gets you thinking."
Recent albums have captured
the gospel of egalitarian Rasta
thinking, along with Hill's earthy
perspective that comes from life as
a farmer in the St. Andrew parish.
Each of the songs is "a little story
with big morals," from the catchy
chants of "Mr. Music" on "Culture
In Culture" to the anthem "Peace,

Love & Harmony" on "NufT Cri
sis" and the tribute "Psalm of Bob
Marley" on "Good Things."
Last year's album, "Three Sides
to My Story," has a sound that is
characteristically Culture. It's
sparse at first, but with a second
listen you begin to notice the
quirky and back-up
vocals that give the music a puls
ing. wiggling texture. Hill some
times speak-sings his lines, as on
"Sufferer," and other times har
monizes with Walker and Dayes on
"Life" to lift a song into a rough
and-tumble religious experience.
When asked about this inspira
tional feel to his music, Hill laughs
and says,"I tell you something.
Each one is a Rastafarian. Myself
is a dreadlock Rastafarian. But
you yourself is a Rasta in your own
right. Yes, because there is a time
in each man's life where they've
got to say 'Oh, God!' or 'Oh, Lord!'
or whatever you may call. Which
means, it touches the divine sec
tion of your life. That is the Rasta
fari in you."
On "Still Rest My Heart," Hill
begins by calling out, "Oh! What a
happening," his own timely
lament over the bogus legacy of
the voyages of the Pinta, Nina and
Santa Maria. "Babylon Can't
Study" criticizes those who fail to
understand that life's riches are
not material and in turn persecute
Rastafarian s.
Hill, himself speaking from the
heart of Babylon, sometimes
known as Los Angeles, said he
comes to let his music speak. "I'm
somewhat happy in my own self to
present this message to Babylon,"

he said. "Seeing, knowing what
they are doing, that it is not right."
As long as the problems he
writes about continue, Hill said it
is necessary to keep singing out.
"It is so scary that the youth are
learning so very slowly ... as if
they are reluctant to know what is
right. But then, upon the crisis of

time, I know that there are very
little the regular people can do.
What is there to be done, that can
only be done by presidents?
"One God. One faith. One
heart," Hill concludes. "And that's
the way it's going to be.... Sooner
or later we're all going to come to
the same belief that we are all sis

ters and brothers all over the
earth. And that's what's separat
ing the earth right now."

Culture performs tonight at The
Edge, 260 California Avenue, Palo
Alto. Tickets are $9 and doors open
at 9 p.m. while the show starts at
10 p.m.
