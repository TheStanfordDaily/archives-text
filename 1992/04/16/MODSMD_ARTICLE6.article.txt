# Actors address rape with 'images, silence'
## 
### Sara Skinner Staff Writer 
Actions, not words, are the idea behind a
performance piece put together for Rape
Awareness Week by the newly-formed
Women's Theater Collective.
To address the issue of rape, 11 Stanford
women created the piece, called "Acting Out:
Responses to Rape." It is an innovative way
to approach the issue, the play's director
said, because rather than lecturing, it
attempts to encourage active participation.
"Speakers are important, but I think
there is something theater can say with
images and silence," said director Sonja
Kuftinec, a master's student in drama.
The event, which includes a half-hour per
formance followed by a half-hour discussion,
premiered yesterday and is showing today
and tomorrow at noon at the Nitery, with an
additional performance tomorrow at 8 p.m.
Termed an "original performance piece"
by Kuftinec, it is a synthesis of playscript
excerpts, adaptations from books and the
women's own poems.
The first half of the program is a series of
"moments" in which characters sing, talk
about their feelings of strength and fear and
portray the horror of rape through descrip
tion and acted scenes.
Actress Krista Hoeppner, a junior majoring
in English, explained the reason for the event:
"It's a difficult issue that people want to turn

off to. You need to come up with a way to talk
about it that's intriguing, that allows some of
the complexity of the issues to be addressed."
Junior Kaki Bernard agreed: "All the sur
veys and news articles in the world aren't going
to let you deal with this emotion. Theater can
... it's a safe space to present these issues."
Kuftinec said she came up with the idea
for the performance before she heard of
Rape Awareness Week, and when she went
to the Graduate Women's Network for sup
port, they suggested she make it a part of the
week's events.
She said she began with a script "that is
no longer in the performance in any way."
Instead, the group decided to create the pro
ject themselves, and had "each woman talk
about what was important for [her] to say."
As a consequence, the performance includes
responses to rape from black, Asian, white, les
bian, male and a child's points of view.
Senior Alex d' Arbeloff said that "everyone
was a director. If one person wasn't satisfied
with the moment, we would work it out."
Several of the actresses said they drew on
their own experiences for the performance.
"A lot of things I had experienced were more
important than I had given them credit for,"
said junior Bridgit Evans. "I've learned a lot
but it's been really challenging."
After the performance is over, there is a dis
cussion session, which, according to the actress
es, is as important as the performance itself.
"You need to break out of the walls of the

theater," Kuftinec said. "The discussion is
important for the audience to connect more
to the material."
Hoeppner agrees: "In a piece like this it's
really important to have the space for com
munication."
Discussion sessions are moderated by fac
ulty members and students, who direct ques
tions at actors and actresses, and encourage
the public to ask questions as well.
The discussion was led yesterday by His
tory Prof. Estelle Friedman, who combined
her questions to the performersp with ques
tions and comments from a near-capacity,
very enthusiastic audience.
Assoc. Drama Prof. Harry Elam and
teams of two students per day will lead
upcoming performances.
As a result of working on this perfor
mance, the women have formed the Women's
Theater Collective. Kuftinec said they hope
to "explore issues such as body, perception
and eating" which affect women but could
not be included in this performance.
Bernard said she sees a need for women's
performances because, "To the best of my
knowledge there hasn't been an all women's
production in the recent past."
The actresses said they have become a kind
of "support group" for one another. "Becoming
friends with these women .. . has been great,"
said senior Karine Rosenthal, one of the
actresses. She paused to hug a woman good
bye. "It's going to last beyond this production."
