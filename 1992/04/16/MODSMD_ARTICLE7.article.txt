Libya resists sanctions
TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) — Countries barred
Libyan jets from their airspace and ordered diplo
mats to go home on yesterday, tightening a noose
around the Arab country to pressure it to turn over
suspects in the bombing of Pan AM Flight 103.
The punitive measures were sanctions approved
by the United Nations, but a defiant Libya tried to
flout them by sending its jets into the sky. They
were turned away — in one case by fighter jets.
Russia began pulling 3,000 of its workers and
family members out of Libya.
Citing a Russian Foreign Ministry statement,
the Radio Russia said Thursday that Moscow was
concerned about the "threat of terrorist attacks
against foreigners of states which have supported
the United Nations sanctions against Libya."
Libya summoned diplomats from Britain,
France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Belgium,
Czechoslovakia and Japan, and told them some
of their number would be expelled, Libyan
broadcasts reported Wednesday night.
Libya said no Libyan airline tickets would be
sold to citizens of nations supporting the sanctions.
Although there is Arab sentiment against the
sanctions, nations in the region abided by a U.N.
resolution passed March 31 banning arms sales
to Libya.
