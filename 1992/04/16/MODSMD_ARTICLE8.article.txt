# Those who've quit discuss depledging Greek system
## 
### Kris McNeil 
Although pledging after an exhausting Rush is
usually an exciting experience that marks the begin
ning of a lasting bond among new friends, a handful
of students will later decide to leave their fraternity
or sorority.
Their reasons vary, but many who have depledged
became disenchanted with what they said are some of
the more problematic aspects of Greek life — its
homogeneity, its sometimes prohibitive cost and time
commitments, and its undercurrent of alcohol abuse.
"Pledging was a complete mistake," said senior
Keith Darden, who depledged from Beta Theta Pi.
Fraternity members, he said, "try to make you into
something which is fairly undesirable, and if you don't
want to become it, they make your life unpleasant."
However, sophomore Phi Kappa Psi Mike
Burstein said individuality is valued within the
Greek system. "It's not some huge Greek monster
like I think many people see it,"he said. "Each fra
ternity or sorority and their members have individ
ual special character, and that's what makes our
system unique."
Last year, nine men depledged from housed fra
ternities, according to Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Heather Dunn. The office does not keep track of the
number of students who depledge from sororities or
unhoused fraternities.
A tough decision
Although each of the University's 16 fraternities
and seven sororities have their own characteristics,
any Greek organization generally requires a sub
stantial involvement, and the decision to depledge is
not taken lightly. Often, it results in major read
justments in an individual's life.
Senior Steve Williams said that when he depledged
Sigma Nu his sophomore year, he maintained close

relationships with only four or five members.
"The bulk of the people dropped me off their social
list, which I found to be ... interesting," he said.
However, Burstein said that when students in his
pledge class depledged, his relationships with them
didn't change significantly. "We still hang out," he said.
'A pretty homogeneous group'
Many who have depledged say they dislike the
uniformity of the Greek system.
According to Darden, he depledged primarily
because he did not want to continue in "an all-male,
subjectively selective institution."
Williams said that although he felt Sigma Nu was
"the most topically diverse fraternity on campus,"
he was displeased with the fact that "it was a pretty
homogeneous group as far as attitudes, socioeco
nomic background and sexual orientation."
He said he also disliked the fact that "the group
had a different tone when it was all males than it did
when women were present — and I didn't like either
of the tones."
Senior Steve Gunn said when he depledged Betas
as a sophomore, he resented the fact that "the all
male environment caused people to become misogy
nistic and physically destructive to the house."
Burstein said the disparity of the Greek system
makes placing generalized labels on fraternities unfair.
"Fraternities aren't right for everyone, but every
one needs to look at them with an open mind and not
group them all together," he said.
The issue of alcohol
Gunn said "there were clearly some people who
had problems with alcohol" in his fraternity.
A group of 12 to 18 students depledged in the same
quarter as he did, according to Gunn. "I felt that if we
continued living there, we'd eventually develop prob
lems," he said.

"There is a certain type of coercion when there's
a large group of people drinking alcohol that's defi
nitely problematic," said senior Todd David, a mem
ber of Kappa Sigma.
"But alcohol abuse is a part of every area of col
lege life, and not any more in fraternities than any
where else," he added.
Burstein said the attitude toward alcohol "total
ly depends on the (individual) fraternity."
"There's no pressure [in Phi Psi] to drink at all if
you don't want to," he said. "We have activities where
alcohol is there, but we don't center them on alcohol."
Time and money
Williams said he decided to depledge when he real
ized he had been "using the fraternity" to accomplish
other things he wanted to do, and he simply wasn't
using his time efficiently.
"Time is definitely the biggest concern," said
junior Dan Cravy, a Sigma Phi Epsilon member.
"Last year I think we lost one or two members after
activation, but that's only natural. Sometimes peo
ple just get too many involvements.... If they can't
put in the time, we're not going to hate them for it."
Junior Hope Flannery, a member of Kappa
Kappa Gamma, pointed out that each individual
Greek organization has "totally different" demands
on their members' time.
Williams said cost was also a factor in his decision
to depledge. He said in addition to the quarterly
dues, "substantial hidden costs, such as road trips
and formals, made the groups exclusionary" for peo
ple who couldn't afford the costs.
"Although these events were not mandated, it
was an implicit assumption that you are going to go
or you are going to miss out," he said.
Suppressed by stereotypes
The Greek system has traditionally been charac
terized by a number of stereotypes — many of them
unflattering. Sophomore Bianchini said she initially
depledged her sorority partially because she was
afraid she would be stereotyped by people who didn't
even know her.
In the initial stages of her involvement with
Delta Delta Delta, she was very concerned that
membership in a sorority would force her to surren
der her own individuality and that others would
impose the identity of the group upon her.
"In the beginning, I was working so hard at fight
ing the stereotypes that I realized I was only stereo
typing myself," she said, explaining why she recent
ly reactivated. "Once you get beyond all that, you'll
find it's a system with a lot of integrity."
"Reputations exist for each different [fraternity
and sorority], but I think every group changes so
much each year," David said. "I'm sure in each one
you can find people who fit the stereotypes, but if
someone is going to really judge people by them
then you should seriously question whether they're
thinking for themselves."
Gunn said despite the fact that he "would not
want to live in any fraternity again," the time he was
a member of the Betas "was one of the best experi
ences I've had at Stanford — it really opened my eyes,
and I've changed a lot emotionally and politically."
