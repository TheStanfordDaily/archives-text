A LETTER TO THE STANFORO COMMUNITY
Dear Stanford Folks:
Last Saturday at White Plaza, a very special event happened. The Extrava
ganza is a yearly spring cultural (air planned by the students of OKADA
HOUSE, Stanford's Asian American theme house & one of several ethnic
& academic theme halls on campus. The festival drew 2000-3000 people
who enjoyed Asian foods & drink, musical & dance performances, a
fashion show of Asian dresses, arts & crafts displays & a water-dunking
booth with Tara Vanderveer, Prof. Gil Masters, Glyn Milbum, Ann Porteus
of Residential Education, Daily columnist Joel Stein & other popular
"targets." Most important, The Extravaganza was a fantastic community
celebration for everyone. For a few short hours, we hope the festival
created some cross-cultural & educational goodwill that will go a long way.
We'd like to acknowledge some altruistic people who made The Extrava
ganza a success. The student staff at Okada House — especially Jeremy
Bender, Jeff S. Chen, Angel Lau, Joseph Shieh & Karen Ho — did a
professional job & spent months planning the event. Too numerous to
thank is a small army of student volunteers led by Christine Chia. Vicki
Baker at Tresidder & Jason Burke & BJ. Overbaugh at Events & Sen/ices
were very helpful. Great support has also come from Alice Supton & Ann
Porteus (Assoc. Directors of Res. Ed.), Rick Yuen & Cindy Ng (Asian
American Activities Center), Jack Chin & Michael Chang (ex-Okada
resident fellows), Laura Chi, Eric Pang, Rand Quinn, Cliff Wong (ex-Okada
students) & others.
Lastly, we'd like to thank everyone for their monetary gifts. (Hey, we ain't
too proud to beg! If there are financial angels out there, please call!) A
partial list of contributors: the ASSU Program Board, the School of
Engineering, Civil Engineering, East Asian Languages, Geophysics, the
CIV program, Modern Thought & Literature, Graduate Administrative
Offices & all the residence halls that donated funds.
Again, our warmest thanks for your help. We'll see you next year!
