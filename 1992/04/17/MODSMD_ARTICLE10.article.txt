# Food Service dinner to mark Passover
## Seder at Roble Hall open to both Jewish, non-Jewish students 
### Elisa Ni√±o-Murcia Staff writer 
Roble Hall will trade the usual
mashed potatoes and mystery meat
for passover lamb and unleavened
bread tomorrow night in a tradi
tional Seder.
Food Service Assistant Manag
er Robert Kurchin said the din
ner, which has been one of his
projects, is held on the second of
two evenings commemorating the
tenth plague in Egypt during the
enslavement of the Jewish people.
Although these preparations
are primarily for the Jewish stu
dent community, many also see
the Seder night as an opportunity

for non-Jewish students to experi
ence another culture.
Senior Mike Simon, a resident
assistant at Larkin, decided to
mention the celebration at his all
freshman hall meeting.
"I really hope there will be some
venturesome people. It's a great
opportunity to gain wisdom with
no pain, since the dinner is part of
their meal plans," Simon said.
"This event is our chance to open
our doors. Hopefully, that's what
is going to happen."
The traditional dinner includes
"eating passover lamb, bitter herbs
and unleavened bread," said Rabbi
Ari Cartun of Hillel, the Jewish
student organization. Each food

item symbolizes something unique
to the plight of the Jews in Egypt.
The eight-day Passover celebra
tion is in "remembrance of that
oppression and a celebration of
overcoming it," Simon said.
Kurchin said his main goal is
to make sure that Jewish stu
dents realize that they have this
meal option through food service.
"Jewish students should realize
that it's here for them," he said.
Kurchin's project originated in
response to student complaints
that Food Service lacks kosher food
during the Passover celebration.
"A student in Wilbur four years
ago wrote me a letter complaining
about food service," Kurchin

added.
"I'm Jewish. I was pretty
affected by it."
To assure that the meal is com
pletely kosher, Cartun himself has
also spent the past few days thor
oughly cleaning the kitchen to rid
it of any traces of leavened bread.
Simon and senior Deborah
Koven will lead a student-run ser
vice in Roble at 5 p.m. before the
dinner.
In addition to the Seder service
and dinner in Roble, Kurchin has
also launched a new system where
most dorm dining halls will have
Charosets, a fruit and nut mix
ture, and Matzohs available to
students throughout the week.
