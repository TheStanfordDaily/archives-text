# New system expands access to databases
## 
### Jessica Bar 
With the implementation of the newest Folio
menu option, "Networked CD-ROMs," the
Stanford community will have easier access to a
variety of humanities and technical databases.
The new networked system allows up to
five users to simultaneously access seven CD
ROM database products, said Michael Miller,
head of Meyer Library.
CD-ROM services have been available pre
viously only through microcomputers with
individually attached CD-ROM drives scat
tered throughout campus libraries, allowing
just one person at a time to access the system.
Still in its "experimental pilot project stage,"
this larger system is one of just a few such net

worked systems in the country, said Miller.
He said the hardware for the new service
cost approximately $40,000, which came out
of the libraries' material budget. "When you
consider the increased accessibility and the
ability of many people to search the same
thing simultaneously, it's a deal," Miller said.
Each library has terminals which access the
service. Users can also reach the databases
from dorm clusters or from any microcomputer
with certain communication software. Howev
er, most library Socrates terminals will not
work because they are older models.
The seven programs were chosen for their
prospective value to campus users.
"Art Index" contains citations for periodical
articles in art-related fields; "Dissertation

Abstracts International" contains citations and
abstracts for completed doctoral dissertations;
and "Modern Language Association Bibliogra
phy" indexes articles published in the fields of
modern languages, literature and linguistics.
"Enviro/EnergyLine Abstracts" covers
technical and policy issues about the environ
ment, energy, and acid rain; "Water Resources
Abstracts" is an interdisciplinary database list
ing works on water; "Statistical Masterfile"
provides access to millions of pages of statisti
cal data provided by government and private
organizations; and "Video Directory" contains
descriptive listings for over 87,000 titles.
Users are encouraged to share comments
and suggestions about the experimental service
through a special "Networked CD-ROM" menu.
