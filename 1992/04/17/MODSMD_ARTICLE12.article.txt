More bad checks released
WASHINGTON (AP) — House members are rushing toward the
political confessional with a litany of apologies in a burst of soul
searching inspired by revelations of 24,000 bad checks yesterday.
"You get tarred and feathered by the actions of your fellow
congressmen," Rep. Craig James, R-Fla., said of the furor
sparked by check overdrafts at the now-defunct House bank.
"I know my constituents are angry and horrified over this entire
affair. I am too," said Rep. Dennis Hertel, D-Mich., who is retiring
from Congress rather than face re-election with 547 overdrawn checks.
"It wasn't a bank, it was a mess," he said.
The rapid-fire launching of confessions and explanations was a
replay of the scenario of mid-March, when the lists of bad-check
writers were initially leaked. And the process was no less painful
for an institution under siege.
The House ethics committee yesterday revealed 303 names of
current and former House members who wrote bad checks at the
members-only bank. It served to breathe new life into a scandal
that broke into public view last year and seems certain to carry
plenty of Election Day repercussions come November.
Together with the 22 names previously unveiled as the worst
abusers of the bank, the new report means that 269 current and
56 former lawmakers wrote checks they didn't have the money to
cover during a 39-month period ending last October.
Teacher loses bet, eats worms
BELDING, Mich. (AP) — An elementary school teacher was so
confident his school's students couldn't read 7,000 books during
March, he told them he'd eat worms if they did.
He lost the bet.
Hall Park Elementary School's 232 students read 7,785 vol
umes during the month, which was National Reading Month. So
on Tuesday, Chuck Matlock boiled four worms in lemon juice and
salt, and downed them before the students.
The enterprising teacher turned his meal into a lesson: "Real
ly, worms have as much protein as a T-bone steak without the
gristle," he said.
And he said he's game for a similar challenge next year — espe
cially if Principal Judy Feuerstein joins him.
