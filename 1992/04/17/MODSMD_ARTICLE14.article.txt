## Don't forget Africa 
### 
Eastern Europe isn't the
only region in the world
converting to democracy

AS THE EVENTS organized
around Africa Week remind
us, Eastern Europe is not
the only arena experiencing the
exhilaration of attempts to build
democratic environments.
This year's Africa Week celebra
tion focuses on the theme of
"African politics in a changing
global environment" and seeks to
address the socio-political con
cerns of African nations in the cur
rent international scene. The cele
bration also reminds us of the role
Stanford students can play in this
exciting process.
In his keynote address, Solomon
Gomes, a representative of the
Organization of African Unity,
pointed out that Western nations
are currently ignoring the needs of
African countries enmeshed in
fields of political turbulence.
According to him, the United States
and the other industrial powers are
directing their assistance efforts
primarily toward Eastern Europe
but are forgetting Africa.
For example, the civil war in
Yugoslavia has attracted the atten
tion of the government and media,
while similar unrest in the Horn of
Africa and in Liberia has been
brushed aside.
The momentous changes that
have swept through Eastern
Europe need not eclipse the differ
ent trajectory followed by many
African nations toward establishing
forms of participatory democracy.
For these nations, especially
those south of the Sahara, overcom
ing the burdens of economic and
cultural dependency fostered by
colonialism are overwhelming and
the process of reconstruction needs
a great deal of far-sighted planning.
As Gomes pointed out, the evo
lution of forms of African democra
cy are dictated not only by internal

tensions within these countries,
but also by their position in the
international system.
Like many Eastern European
countries, African nations are also
rich in natural resources and need
assistance to develop these
resources gainfully.
According to Ware Omamo,
president of the Stanford African
Students Association, the twin
aims of Africa Week are to allow
African students to "affirm their
Africanness," and to promote dis
cussion on campus about African
cultural and political issues.
There are concrete measures
that Stanford students can under
take to confront this issue.
Students for Eastern European
Democracy, a campus organiza
tion, provides an excellent model
for student involvement with
countries struggling to overcome
an oppressive legacy of the past.
In addition to establishing an
exchange program for interested
students, SEED has also sent edu
cational materials to campuses in
Eastern Europe. A campus pro
gram similar to SEED, one devot
ed to raising awareness of African
needs, would go a long way toward
encouraging development of the
neglected continent.
And although we do have an
African Studies program, there
needs to be more contact with spe
cific African countries. Opening an
overseas campus in a university in
an African country will serve this
purpose well.
The situation does not have to
be perceived as a reductive "zero
sum" game where aid to one
region comes at the expense of
another.
These are exciting times that
bear the promise of a shift away
from the stale and staid diplomatic
games of the Cold War. If indeed
our world view is one where the
United States is the reigning
power, then it is simultaneously
our privilege and our prerogative
to ensure that the benefits of
democracy are disseminated equi
tably.
