## From empire to freedom 
### 
The dramatic events that
punctuated the week of Aug. 19,
1991 in the former Soviet Union
led to the triumph of forces favoring
democracy and opposing the dogmatic
centralization and cultural intolerance
that characterized the Soviet monolith
for decades.
I had the opportunity to visit Russia in
the weeks that followed the infamous
coup attempt as a member of the Stan
ford Novosibirsk Exchange (formerly the
Stanford Soviet Exchange Project).
Today, my gracious hosts from
Novosibirsk are visiting Stanford. It is
insightful to hear them express their
views on the events that are transpiring
in their country, accompanied with those
of Stanford specialists.
Vladimir Rumyantsev and Yegor Koz
intsev, students from Novosibirsk, are
both Russian nationals whose families
live in Kazakhstan. Rumyantsev, a third
year economics and finance major, is the
vice president of LC Aiesec in Novosi
birsk, a student organization that is unit
ing economic scientists worldwide. It has
organized numerous exhanges between
Russia and Western countries, emphasiz
ing education and business.
Rumyantsev has tried to establish con
tact with faculty in Stanford's Economics
Department and Business School. While
in the U.S., he is trying to understand the
habits, the mentality and the way of life

of most Americans. "In the new world
order, it is important that we understand
each other," he said.
He stresses Russia's need for its
prospective manufacturers to come to the
West to study the economic experience of
its diversified economy.
Lazar Fleishman, chair of the Slavic
Languages and Literatures Department
at Stanford, is optimistic about the
future. He has been encouraged by the
fact that large-scale bloodshed has been
avoided during this painful period.
The people of Russia and the other
now-independent republics of the former
Soviet Union have a common cause and
are "firmly established on the path to
democracy," said Fleishman, from Riga,
Latvia. He added that he is convinced
that common sense will prevail over the
fascist slogans of ultra-nationalist
groups, which, until now, have been
"unsuccessful."
Fleishman recalled the courageous
stand of the Lithuanian people when
they affirmed their right to freedom, and
emphasized its influence on the people of
Moscow during the August events. "The
citizens of Vilnius (Lithuania's capital)
provided a model for the Muscovites,"
who would resist reactionary forces
when their critical moment came, he
said.
Fleishman, who will soon return to
Riga for the first time in 18 years, sees

'Common
sense will pre
vail over the
fascist slogans
of ultra-nation
alist groups.'

the Baltic states as the leaders of the
democratization process, the conversion
to free markets, and integration with the
West. He sees little reason for the Rus
sian minorities in these pioneer states to
fear oppression.
Kozintsev, a fifth-year physiology
major, adopts a more analytical approach
to Russia's future.
"Feudalistic states faced a cross-roads
between the road to capitalism and the
road to socialism and communism. The
West chose capitalism, while Russia
chose communism. Now, we are turning
away from communism, but to prosper,
we must exert all our efforts to move
toward capitalism, without regressing
back to feudalism."
Russia and the other newly-indepen
dent states currently face runaway infla
tion and other economic woes associated
with the transformation process.
Optimism, such as that expressed by
Fleishman, and economic insightfulness,
provided by people like Rumyantsev, are
necessary if these countries are to enjoy
future prosperity.

the Russians' visit.
