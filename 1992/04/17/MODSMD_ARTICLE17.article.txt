After roommate moves out, gay student responds

I'M WRITING THIS letter to describe
how I feel about a personal experi
ence. After coming back from the
Oxford overseas program, I walked-on
into Hammarsjkold. I was assigned a
random roommate.
Two days after living with me, my
random roommate approached the resi
dent assistant and said that he didn't
want to room with me because I am gay.
Consequently, he left and moved into a
different room.
I feel obligated to inform the Stanford
community about the incident. First, I
want people to understand how I am affect
ed by it. Second, I want people to know that
similar incidents happen all the time which
are dismissed and rarely discussed.
I don't understand what it is about
my being gay that is so objectionable
that he cannot room with me. Whatever
these reasons are — be it personal dis
comfort, prejudice or unfounded fear —
they should not take precedence over my

rights and human dignity.
I am very angry because it is directed
against me personally. He does not want
to room with me not because we don't
get along as roommates or because we
have different living habits, but solely
because of who I am.
It is almost the same as saying to me,
"I don't want to room with you because
you are Asian." Like segregation, the inci
dent tells me that I am not fit to share
the same space with him because of our
differences. If this incident were racial
discrimination, it would not have been
tolerated on this campus. This suggests
that homophobic discrimination, unlike
racial discrimination, is justifiable.
I was told that he cannot live with me
in the same room. This message tells me
that I am fit to share the same dining
hall, use the same kitchen and watch TV
in the same lounge with him, but not fit
to share the same room with him.
It tells me that my "being" — my worth,

respect and human dignity — can only be
acceptable in certain places. This shows his
lack of respect for me as a human being.
I also was told that he absolutely can
not room with me for religious reasons. I
have a hard time accepting this. I am very
disappointed that religion is often used as
a guise for discrimination, persecution
and personal prejudice against gay people.
I don't think the person has respect
for my feelings either. I do not think
that he knows the stress and pain this
incident has caused me. I have become
quite affected and depressed.
Disillusioned by a lot of things, I iso
lated myself from other people for a
while. I do not think the person under
stands how destructive and harmful it is
to my well-being.
While no one else deserves to go through
the suffering, I feel obligated to point out
that this is what many gay students have to
go through constantly in their dorms. And
many are unable to speak up against the

insensitivity of their dormmates.
I don't think the person understands
how important my sexuality is to me. It
constitutes almost every aspect of my
life. My identity as a gay person is impor
tant to me because gay people have been
killed and persecuted for who they are.
This incident also makes me question
everything Stanford has to say about
multiculturalism. I'm not sure how peo
ple can learn from each other when preju
dices and different beliefs come so strong.
I am not sure how we can live together as
a community when people are so unwill
ing to be exposed to our differences.
Having said tliat, however, I should point
out that there are a lot of people at Ham
marsjkold and the Stanford community who
are very understanding. I would encourage
people to speak up and talk about the issues
so they would not be swept under the car
pet, as they have been for a long time.
