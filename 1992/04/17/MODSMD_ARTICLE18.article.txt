# Women's organization deserves attention too

The Thomas hearings, the Gag Rule
and threats of overturning Roe vs.
Wade emphasize the fact that we need
more women to represent us in the
U.S. Senate and House of Representa
tives.
I find it unfortunate that the article
"Students dive into fall campaign races,"
in the April 10 issue of The Daily, failed
to mention a new student organization,
the National Women's Political Caucus
of Stanford University, which is dedicat
ed to getting more pro-choice women
into elected appointed office.
In 1992, California has the unique
opportunity to elect two women candi
dates, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara
Boxer, to the U.S. Senate. NWPC spon
sored the "Spring Break on the Cam-

paign Trail" project, which sent students
to volunteer at their campaign head
quarters in San Francisco.
In its efforts to increase student par
ticipation in the political process, NWPC
registered voters and matched students
with local campaigns, such as Anna
Eshoo's campaign for the U.S. House of
Representatives.
In addition, NWPC is offering the
Stanford community the opportunity to
discuss the issues by bringing Eshoo
here to speak.
The omission of references to
women's campaigns for higher office in
1992 perpetuates views that there are
few, if any, women candidates on the
scene. NWPC is working to change that
by increasing the visibility of women
candidates and encouraging student par
ticipation in their campaigns.
