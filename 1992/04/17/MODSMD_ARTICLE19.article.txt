# Heckler demonstrates poor manners at game
## 
### 
On Saturday night I attended the
men's volleyball match against UC-
Santa Barbara. Whenever a UCSB play
er came up to serve, a Stanford heckler
sitting a few feet away would call out
cutting insults in an apparent attempt to
distract the server.
The heckler picked on the server's
name, personal appearance or physical
features in a manner that I haven't
heard since grade school. Each time he
did this, a few other Stanford spectators
within earshot would chuckle their
approval.
Why are we at Stanford tolerating
this kind of behavior? We would not
accept this behavior in the classroom, so
why do we allow it in the gymnasium?
Some might argue that these are sea

soned athletes, used to playing under
difficult conditions and immune to such
comments. The heckler, at least, does
not believe this, for it would make his
actions pointless.
In any case, the athletes, no matter
how seasoned, are not immune to per
sonal insult.
In addition, such behavior is for
bidden by the rules. In Saturday's
game, Stanford was awarded a point
after a UCSB player made a noise
while Stanford was serving. This
behavior is not even tolerated on the
court.
These are talented athletes on both
sides, worthy of our respect. Let them
play the game to the best of their abili
ties, free from needless abuse and pain.
I asked the heckler to stop. Next time,
if he is sitting near you, I hope you will
do the same.
