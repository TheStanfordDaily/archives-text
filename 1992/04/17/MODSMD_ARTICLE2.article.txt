# Voters 'Prefer' not to have COP
## Slate promising to abolish itself edges out Students First 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
The"I Prefer Not to Have a
COP" slate narrowly defeated
Students First early this morning
in the Council of Presidents race,
sending a powerful message
about the ASSU and drawing
harsh criticism from political
opponents.
With all the votes for COP tab
ulated at about 4:30 a.m., the
Prefer slate received 2,790 votes.
Students First came in second,
receiving 2,672 votes. "Indepen
dents: A New Era" and Hammer
and Coffin's "YOU!" were third
and fourth.
"I see 'I Prefer' as a trivializa
tion of student government," said
graduate senator Derek Miya
hara, adding that the victory will
have "long-term consequences,"
especially with a new University
president coming next year.
Prefer slate member Ed Mun
expressed surprise at the victory,
saying the slate — which
promised to eliminate the COP
and fund student groups with the
its salary — had "run a very lazy
campaign."
Mun said he thought those
who voted for his were "sick of
the ASSU" and wanted to change
the structure of student govern
ment.
Slate members Mun, Ted Lai,
Blake Ilstrup and Jay Jackson
say they will propose an amend
ment to the ASSU constitution to
remove the COP.
According to Lai, the slate
hopes the amendment will be
approved by the ASSU Senate
and appear on next year's spring
ballot.
Mun refused to give specific
-details on what they would do in
the interim.
