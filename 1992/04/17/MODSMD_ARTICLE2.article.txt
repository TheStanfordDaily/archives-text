# Voters 'Prefer' not to have COP
## Slate promising to abolish itself edges out Students First 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
The"I Prefer Not to Have a
COP" slate narrowly defeated
Students First early this morning
in the Council of Presidents race,
sending a powerful message
about the ASSU and drawing
harsh criticism from political
opponents.
With all the votes for COP tab
ulated at about 4:30 a.m., the
Prefer slate received 2,790 votes.
Students First came in second,
receiving 2,672 votes. "Indepen
dents: A New Era" and Hammer
and Coffin's "YOU!" were third
and fourth.
"I see 'I Prefer' as a trivializa
tion of student government," said
graduate senator Derek Miya
hara, adding that the victory will
have "long-term consequences,"
especially with a new University
president coming next year.
Prefer slate member Ed Mun
expressed surprise at the victory,
saying the slate — which
promised to eliminate the COP
and fund student groups with the
its salary — had "run a very lazy
campaign."
Mun said he thought those
who voted for his were "sick of
the ASSU" and wanted to change
the structure of student govern
ment.
Slate members Mun, Ted Lai,
Blake Ilstrup and Jay Jackson
say they will propose an amend
ment to the ASSU constitution to
remove the COP.
According to Lai, the slate
hopes the amendment will be
approved by the ASSU Senate
and appear on next year's spring
ballot.
Mun refused to give specific
-details on what they would do in
the interim.

Junior David Willard and freshman Ruby Rosas anxiously await the outcome of special fee requests early
this morning. Candidates joined other interested students in the ASSU office to await election returns.
Current COP member John
Overdeck said he believes Prefer's
proposal is a "tremendous mis
take," and he will attempt to
change the budget to ensure the
incoming slate receives no salary.
"It's absolutely imperative to
hold them to their promises," he
said.
However, not everyone took
such a negative view of the win
ners. Anoop Prakash, who won an
undergraduate senate seat last
night, said it would be "nice to try
I having no COP] for a year."
Mun said he believes there is a
95 percent chance that the senate
will approve the amendment,
because it would hopefully see his
slate's election as a mandate to dis
mantle the office.
If the senate does not approve
the amendment, Mun said the slate
had "other means" to accomplish
its goal, including something the
slate calls "Project Denorex."
Mun refused to release any spe
cific details of the plan.
Sherri Wolson, a member of the
third-place Independents, called

the victory "impressive."
"They really tapped into" the ill
will many students feel towards
the ASSU, she said. "It's really a
mandate to make a change."
"I feel like Lucy just pulled the
football out from under me again,"
said Students First candidate Joel
Stein, who was wearing a Charlie
Brown-type striped shirt. "I've
never lost to no one before."
The composition of next year's
senate, also chosen last night,
seems to be almost evenly split
between independent, Peoples
Platform and Students First candi
dates.
Twelve independent and 12 Stu
dents First candidates were among
the 40 senators elected. Ten Peo
ple's Platform candidates will also
be in the senate.
In addition, one Hammer and
Coffin candidate, two undeclared
candidates and three write-in can
didates were elected.
In the current senate, a two-way
split exists with 15 People's Plat
form and 15 Students First sena
tors. Only six members of this
year's senate ran with no party
affiliation.
Independents slate member
Jason Snyder said he was
impressed by the number of inde

pendent senators, and thought it
showed a feeling that campus polit
ical parties are "not in touch with
the students on the campus."
The senate is made up of 20
undergraduate and 20 graduate
senators.
The 10 senators out of each
group with the highest vote
totals become voting senators,
and the remaining 10 are non
voting senators who fill in when
the others fail to attend senate
meetings.
In the COP race, Independents
was trailing Prefer but was ahead
of Students First by 71 votes before
the second round of votes in the
new preferential voting system was
tabulated.
The preferential system elimi
nates the slate with the fewest
votes and divides up those votes
according to the second-ranked
slate on the ballot.
After the fourth and final
round, Students First had pulled
ahead of Independents to lose to
Prefer by 118 votes.
Junior Beth Morgan, graduate
student Doug Bone and freshman
John Griggs were elected to the
Student Conduct Legislative Coun
cil, and"The Final Four" slate won
the senior class presidents race.

Overdeck said he believes Prefer's
proposal is a "tremendous mis
take," and he will attempt to
change the budget to ensure the
incoming slate receives no salary.
"It's absolutely imperative to
hold them to their promises," he
said.
However, not everyone took
such a negative view of the win
ners. Anoop Prakash, who won an
undergraduate senate seat last
night, said it would be "nice to try
I having no COP] for a year."
Mun said he believes there is a
95 percent chance that the senate
will approve the amendment,
because it would hopefully see his
slate's election as a mandate to dis
mantle the office.
If the senate does not approve
the amendment, Mun said the slate
had "other means" to accomplish
its goal, including something the
slate calls "Project Denorex."
Mun refused to release any spe
cific details of the plan.
Sherri Wolson, a member of the
third-place Independents, called

the victory "impressive."
"They really tapped into" the ill
will many students feel towards
the ASSU, she said. "It's really a
mandate to make a change."
"I feel like Lucy just pulled the
football out from under me again,"
said Students First candidate Joel
Stein, who was wearing a Charlie
Brown-type striped shirt. "I've
never lost to no one before."
The composition of next year's
senate, also chosen last night,
seems to be almost evenly split
between independent, Peoples
Platform and Students First candi
dates.
Twelve independent and 12 Stu
dents First candidates were among
the 40 senators elected. Ten Peo
ple's Platform candidates will also
be in the senate.
In addition, one Hammer and
Coffin candidate, two undeclared
candidates and three write-in can
didates were elected.
In the current senate, a two-way
split exists with 15 People's Plat
form and 15 Students First sena
tors. Only six members of this
year's senate ran with no party
affiliation.
Independents slate member
Jason Snyder said he was
impressed by the number of inde

pendent senators, and thought it
showed a feeling that campus polit
ical parties are "not in touch with
the students on the campus."
The senate is made up of 20
undergraduate and 20 graduate
senators.
The 10 senators out of each
group with the highest vote
totals become voting senators,
and the remaining 10 are non
voting senators who fill in when
the others fail to attend senate
meetings.
In the COP race, Independents
was trailing Prefer but was ahead
of Students First by 71 votes before
the second round of votes in the
new preferential voting system was
tabulated.
The preferential system elimi
nates the slate with the fewest
votes and divides up those votes
according to the second-ranked
slate on the ballot.
After the fourth and final
round, Students First had pulled
ahead of Independents to lose to
Prefer by 118 votes.
Junior Beth Morgan, graduate
student Doug Bone and freshman
John Griggs were elected to the
Student Conduct Legislative Coun
cil, and"The Final Four" slate won
the senior class presidents race.
The"I Prefer Not to Have a
COP" slate narrowly defeated
Students First early this morning
in the Council of Presidents race,
sending a powerful message
about the ASSU and drawing
harsh criticism from political
opponents.
With all the votes for COP tab
ulated at about 4:30 a.m., the
Prefer slate received 2,790 votes.
Students First came in second,
receiving 2,672 votes. "Indepen
dents: A New Era" and Hammer
and Coffin's "YOU!" were third
and fourth.
"I see 'I Prefer' as a trivializa
tion of student government," said
graduate senator Derek Miya
hara, adding that the victory will
have "long-term consequences,"
especially with a new University
president coming next year.
Prefer slate member Ed Mun
expressed surprise at the victory,
saying the slate — which
promised to eliminate the COP
and fund student groups with the
its salary — had "run a very lazy
campaign."
Mun said he thought those
who voted for his were "sick of
the ASSU" and wanted to change
the structure of student govern
ment.
Slate members Mun, Ted Lai,
Blake Ilstrup and Jay Jackson
say they will propose an amend
ment to the ASSU constitution to
remove the COP.
According to Lai, the slate
hopes the amendment will be
approved by the ASSU Senate
and appear on next year's spring
ballot.
Mun refused to give specific
-details on what they would do in
the interim.
