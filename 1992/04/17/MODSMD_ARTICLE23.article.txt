## Adams is awesome as Cardinal whips USC 7-4 
### Mike Langford Staff Writer 
At 9-9 in Six-Pac play, the
Stanford baseball team went into
its away series with the USC Tro
jans really needing to take two
out of three games to stay in the
hunt for the conference title. But
for a while, it looked like those
two wins would have to come in
the second and third games. Yes
terday, in the first game of the
series, the Trojans were on a roll.
Southern Cal hurler Jackie Nick
ell, last year's Six-Pac Pitcher of
the Year, was holding the Cardi
nal hitless, and Southern Cal was
leading 2-0. But with timely hit
ting and the heroics of Willie
Adams, Stanford did half of its
stated job by taking the game 7-4.
"It was a real big win for us,"
said Stanford head baseball coach
Mark Marquess. "And a gutty
performance by Willie Adams."
In his fourth complete game of
the year, the sophomore right
hander gave up four runs on six
hits, while walking only two and
striking out a season-high nine.
With the win, Adam's record
improved to 6-2, but at first it
didn't look like he'd be picking up
the 'W.'
The Trojans struck first by
scoring two runs in the bottom of
the second, the first of which
came after Adams loaded the
bases by hitting a batsman, and
walked in a run on four pitches.
Meanwhile, Nickell was mowing
Stanford batters down, allowing
nary a hit through four innings.
But in the top of the fifth the Car
dinal showed that it could, to

spite the naysayers, get hits when
it counted.
"We didn't get a lot of hits, but
we did get timely hitting," said
Marquess.
In the inning, senior Steve
Solomon started the rally by
depositing a Nickell curveball
over the right field fence for the
Stanford's first run and hit of the
game. John Lynch then followed
with a single, as did Jeffrey Ham
monds, driving in Lynch. A Tro
jan error would then allow Ham
monds to score and the Cardinal
to take a 3-2 lead.
But USC wasn't done, as they
would score two more to regain
the lead at 4-3. But unbeknownst
to the Trojans, they would not
score again for the remainder of
the game, and Stanford would.
The Cardinal began their sec
ond rally in the top of the seventh
with a single, and frosh shortstop
Jed Hansen followed with an RBI
double. Not to be outdone, Ham
monds continued his relentless
hitting by following with an RBI
double of his own, after which
Dave Cornell hit a routine RBI
single to bring the score to 6-3.
Stanford would score an insur
ance run in the ninth, but it was
not needed as Adams put the Tro
jans down in order in the bottom
half of the inning.
With the win, and various
other happenings in the Six-Pac,
Stanford at 10-9 took firm hold of
second place along with Arizona
State while Arizona continues to
lead the conference at 11-7. USC
resides in third place at 9-10,
while Cal sits in fourth at 8-9, and
UCLA brings up the rear at 8-11.
