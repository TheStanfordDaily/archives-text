# Golfers make strong showing

The ball seemingly came out of nowhere, from
down a hill and out of sight. Yet as the gallery
looked on in disbelief, the projectile took a back
ward hop and came to rest one foot from the pin.
Such is how fate works for the Stanford Cardi
nal men's golf team. Just like senior Christian
Cevaer's spectacular third shot on the final hole to
save birdie and a third place team finish, the
squad's highest of 1992, at the Far Western Inter
collegiate Invitational on Wednesday, the Cardinal
has overcome some critical early season difficul
ties and surprised a lot of people.
After reaching its previous high-water mark for
the year — a fourth-place finish at the Southwest
ern Invitational last week in Southern California
— Stanford continued its late-season surge at the
Far Western Invite. The Cardinal's three-day, 54-

hole total of 875 was topped only by San Jose
State, which tallied an 864 on its home course at
Pasatiempo Country Club, and Fresno State,
which had a four-man sum of 870.
Coach Wally Goodwin is pleased with his
charges' performance thus far in April's so-called
"crunch time." Noting that next weekend's U.S.
Intercollegiate at home will be the squad's final
regular-season match before it embarks on a post
season journey to the Pacific 10 Conference and
regional championships, Goodwin said, "It was a
heart-warming demonstration of what we've been
practicing for the last three weeks. The guys are
really coming through."
What the team has been practicing since its
return from spring break are its putting and short
game skills. Nothing at the Far Western tourney
embodied the culmination of many early-morning
hours of drills more than Cevaer's
"miracle" shot from the 18th fair
way, from which he couldn't even
see his target.
"I hit the shot and it was right
on the pin," Cevaer said. "The
backspin made it bounce and I
heard people applaud."
As Cevaer was part of the last
foursome of the day to complete
the course, the gallery had swelled
and the pressure was on for the
Cardinal's lone senior. Yet the
captain displayed his leadership
skills under intense final-hole
pressure as he had throughout
the week, when he followed a
three-over-par 74 on Monday

with a one-under 70 and an even
71 on Tuesday and Wednesday,
respectively. Cevaer wound up as
Stanford's low man, tying for
sixth place in the individual
standings.
"I'm thrilled to see him be low
man ... He's had a rough spring,"
Goodwin said of the veteran.
"My practice on putting and
the short game paid off," said
Cevaer of his own performance. "I
feel I'm back to my usual form."
For Cevaer, "usual form" is
that which earned him the Pac-10
individual championship as a
freshman and Ail-American hon
ors as a sophomore. If he were to
come anywhere near those stan
dards in the coming weeks, Stan
ford will be a tough customer to
its opponents for the rest of the
spring, because Cevaer feels that

this is the best of the four Cardi
nal teams of which he been a part.
The evidence for Cevaer's
assertion was abundant this
week: after his 215, sophomores
Notah Begay and Casey Martin
followed at 219, freshman Jerry
Chang carded a 225, while fresh
man Steve Burdick and junior
Brad Lanning each totalled 226.
The team's final-day scores of 71-
73-73-73-74-74 were the most
consistent Goodwin has seen in
his years with the team, and the
coach feels that there is still room
to improve.
"I still don't think we've played
as well as we're going to," Good
win said.
The Cardinal linksters have
certainly come a long way in 1992,
but there is still some surprising
to do.

individual championship as a
freshman and Ail-American hon
ors as a sophomore. If he were to
come anywhere near those stan
dards in the coming weeks, Stan
ford will be a tough customer to
its opponents for the rest of the
spring, because Cevaer feels that

this is the best of the four Cardi
nal teams of which he been a part.
The evidence for Cevaer's
assertion was abundant this
week: after his 215, sophomores
Notah Begay and Casey Martin
followed at 219, freshman Jerry
Chang carded a 225, while fresh
man Steve Burdick and junior
Brad Lanning each totalled 226.
The team's final-day scores of 71-
73-73-73-74-74 were the most
consistent Goodwin has seen in
his years with the team, and the
coach feels that there is still room
to improve.
"I still don't think we've played
as well as we're going to," Good
win said.
The Cardinal linksters have
certainly come a long way in 1992,
but there is still some surprising
to do.
