# Recruits help make life sweet
## 
### 
For the past week and a half, I've been going
through withdrawal. The NCAA men's bas
ketball title game is both a great and a sad
event at the same time: great because theoretically
the two best teams from the field of 64 are playing
for the crown, but sad because after those last 40
minutes, college basketball is over and does not
resume until six months later. What cheered me up
after Duke's victory? I started thinking about next
season—Cardinal hoops, 1993 style.
"How could that cheer you up?," many cynics
asked. "Sure we made the tourney this year, but
that was because of Adam Keefe. Next year, Keefe's
gone, so the team's gone. We're back to the NIT."
Not so fast, fair-weathered ones. There are many
reasons to be optimistic that Stanford can go to the
Big Dance two years in a row. Consider:
• The starting backcourt from this year's 18-11
Southeast Regional squad returns completely
intact. Marcus Lollie constantly improved at the
point guard position this season, providing strong
leadership and dishing out a Pacific 10 Conference
leading 6.5 assists per game. At the off-guard, Peter

Dukes proved he could fill it up from long distance,
hitting 47% of his three-pointers, second best in the
Pac-10. Together, the duo provide the stability that
the Cardinal will need to adjust to playing without
the big redhead, and form one of the top guard com
binations in the conference.
• Brent Williams. Look for the small forward
from Tacoma to come up big next year. Often
streaky this year, he finished as Stanford's second
leading scorer with 11.8 points per game, and was


David
Schwartz
on fire in the Card's 80-75 first
round loss to Alabama. In that
game, he shot 77% from the field
(10-for-13) in scoring a career
high 22 points, and also pulled
down 7 boards. If he can get the
"killer instinct" to be Stanford's
go-to guy, his confident perimeter
play will create a new offensive
style for Stanford.
• Carlos Williams. The 6-foot-7
big man from Ann Arbor, Mich.,
should make an immediate im
pact. The red-shirt junior transfer
will play the power forward spot,
helping to clean the glass and pro
vide muscle inside. He was the Ivy
League rookie of the year in his
freshman season at Brown, and
his size will help to compensate for
the loss of 6-foot-9 Keefe.
• The bench. Coach Mike
Montgomery has the added luxu
ry of having reserves that will be
able to make a significant contri
bution. Guard Kenny Hicks
brings in speed and quickness,
and both guard David Harbour
and forward Andy Poppink are

very competitive individuals.
• The brightest spot of all could
be the new recruits. Two new
players from the South will suit
up for the Cardinal and White.

from Little Rock, Ark., and Dar
ren Allaway is a 6-foot-8 forward
from Hopkinsville, Ky. Both play
ers led their teams to respective
state titles, and, said Mont
gomery, "Both are excellent
prospects, who, with normal
development, will be outstanding
players."
The only question mark, and it
is a big one, is the center position.
Jim Morgan probably will get the
starting nod, but Jason Weaver

will also see time in the middle. A
platoon of the two, similar to the
one used this year between Mor
gan and graduating starter Paul
Garrett, will likely be the compro
mise.
Montgomery said that life
without Keefe will be "difficult,"
because "it's always difficult to
replace a player like Adam with
the number of things that he can
do." But, the Cardinal will have a
head start on doing so. The
NCAA has moved the official first
day of practice from October 15 to
November 1, yet Stanford will get
in extra practice time when the
team tours Spain this August to
play 10 games. This will give the
team more time to adjust to play
ing together as a unit without jer
sey no. 31.
The Card can book a return
engagement to March Madness
through hard work this off-sea
son. The talent is there—it just
needs fine tuning. Montgomery
always manages to get the most
from his players, and the 1993
campaign will be no exception.
The Journey to the Tourney will
be renewed for a second season.
See you at Maples.
