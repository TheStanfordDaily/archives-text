For the past week and a half, I've been going
through withdrawal. The NCAA men's bas
ketball title game is both a great and a sad
event at the same time: great because theoretically
the two best teams from the field of 64 are playing
for the crown, but sad because after those last 40
minutes, college basketball is over and does not
resume until six months later. What cheered me up
after Duke's victory? I started thinking about next
season—Cardinal hoops, 1993 style.
"How could that cheer you up?," many cynics
asked. "Sure we made the tourney this year, but
that was because of Adam Keefe. Next year, Keefe's
gone, so the team's gone. We're back to the NIT."
Not so fast, fair-weathered ones. There are many
reasons to be optimistic that Stanford can go to the
Big Dance two years in a row. Consider:
• The starting backcourt from this year's 18-11
Southeast Regional squad returns completely
intact. Marcus Lollie constantly improved at the
point guard position this season, providing strong
leadership and dishing out a Pacific 10 Conference
leading 6.5 assists per game. At the off-guard, Peter

Dukes proved he could fill it up from long distance,
hitting 47% of his three-pointers, second best in the
Pac-10. Together, the duo provide the stability that
the Cardinal will need to adjust to playing without
the big redhead, and form one of the top guard com
binations in the conference.
• Brent Williams. Look for the small forward
from Tacoma to come up big next year. Often
streaky this year, he finished as Stanford's second
leading scorer with 11.8 points per game, and was
