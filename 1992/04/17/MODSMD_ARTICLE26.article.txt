# Hungry Kurth keeps coming back

With Kristine Kurth you can be
sure of two things: Her match will go
three sets and she'll be eating before,
during, and after the contest.
"I always get hungry so I always
carry stuff around to eat," Kurth said.
While she often stocks fruit or bagels,
there's no predicting what she'll take
out of her knapsack.
Early in the year, she walked into
coach Frank Brennan's office for a
meeting — and pulled a pizza from
her bag. Potato skins are also an occa
sional snack.
"That gets pretty greasy, but I put
Saran Wrap around it," she said.
"During a match I always have to
have bananas, bagels — especially
during a three-setter. That's a must. I
have to eat something."
Kurth has gotten used to three-set
matches this season. She has been
battling a lower back strain since Jan
uary and the injury has hampered her
play. Serving and volleying, two of her
strengths, were most affected by the
strain. During contests in Los Angeles
two weeks ago, she resorted to serving
underhanded and has had to adjust to
a less aggressive, more patient style of
play.
"The biggest thing I've had to get
used to this year is playing injured.
I've never really been injured before
and now I try to pull out matches,
scrap them out, even though I can't go
all out," Kurth said.
Though frustrated by the forced
stagnation in her game, Kurth relish
es the opportunity to work on shots

she previously hasn't used.
"Right now I'm working on a slice
backhand, which I didn't work on
before," she said. "Also I'm thinking
more on the court, not just going out
there and banging."
A healthy Kurth can bang with the
best. In a mid-February clash with
California, she made her 1992 dual
match debut in doubles. She ripped
several returns back before the server

had taken two steps into the court.
Groundstrokes like that drew
amazed laughter from teammates
Laxmi Poruri and Heather Willens,
who are used to seeing blistering shots
from recent Cardinal power mer
chants, Debbie Graham and Meredith
McGrath.
Brennan believes Kurth can be in
that league.
"She's in a holding pattern right
now but once she's healthy she can
show everyone how she plays tennis,"
he said.
Kurth, who is currently No. 53, has
been in the upper echelon of collegiate

tennis before. She was No. 8 in the
pre-season poll based upon her bril
liant freshman campaign as William
and Mary's top player.
After her incredible first year, she
decided to transfer. "First of all, this
is Stanford. Ever since I was little I
wanted to come here. To play tennis
here was my dream," Kurth said.
However, coming out of high
school, she didn't even consider the
Farm.
"When I was a junior I wasn't big
or anything. I was just a one of the
normal kids you'd see at nationals. I
really didn't think I'd do that well
here. With Birch, Graham and
Whitlinger, I'm lucky if I play," Kurth
said. "But I did better than I expected
and had a great freshman year. I
never ever expected I'd be in the posi
tion I'm in now."
One difference was her move from
William and Mary's No. 1 player to
the No. 4 slot here.
"Of course there's an adjustment
you have to make, but I realize I get so
much more out of practices here," she
said. "Out there I was into tennis, but
not the way I am now. I totally feel
like hitting with anyone on the team. I
can always find a good player."
While the difference between her
amazing freshman season and injury
plagued sophomore campaign is a dis
appointment, one of the more frus
trating aspects of this year has been
how much time Kurth has spent in
the training room, trying to get
healthy, rather than on the court.
Kurth logs nearly three hours a day
in the training room.
First comes ice for 10 minutes,
ultra-sound, stretches, resistance
exercises and then ice again. The pre
practice ritual include heat and
stretching and then ice and stretching
after practice. "Sometimes I go to
class with ice packs on my back. Then
I'll be taking them off and people will
be looking at me funny," Kurth said.
The main concern for Kurth now is
to not overwork her back.
"That's how I injured it so I have to

the No. 2 Cardinal women's tennis team after straining her lower back last January.
