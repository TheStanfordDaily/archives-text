SATURDAY — vs. No. 9 Arizona, 1:00 at Stanford Tennis Stadium
CARD NOTES — By upsetting the Cardinal 5-4 Monday, California proved that Stanford
was vulnerable to someone other than Florida. In the past four years, the Cardinal had
lost only twice, both times to the Gators.
Will the Cal loss ignite Stanford as the team heads into the postseason and the NCAA
Championships? The Arizona matches should answer that question.
