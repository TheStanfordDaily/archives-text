# Track and field hosts top northern California teams at Stanford Open
## Cardinal to use competition as preparation for upcoming Golden Bears 
### Nick Clements Staff writer 
Ten of the top track and field teams in
northern California will be on hand this Sat
urday at the Stanford Stadium to go up
against the Cardinal in this year's Stanford
Collegiate Open.
However, head track and field coach Brooks
Johnson clearly has Weenies on his mind.
"Basically, this will be a jumping-off meet
for Cal-Stanford," said Johnson, who will
traveling to Berkeley along with the rest of the
team on May 2 to battle the Golden Bears.
"The people who do well in this meet will be
running in the Cal meet. This weekend will be
a Missouri meet, a show-me meet."
Johnson said that the Cardinal has been
focusing more on individual performances this
year due to the decreasing amount of scholar
ships track and field has been able to offer.
"When you don't have enough scholarships
to fill the events, your priorities have to
change," Johnson said.
The Cardinal has at least three Olympic
caliber athletes this year. Dave Popejoy has
qualified for the NCAA Championships in the
hammer throw and is on the verge of qualify
ing for the Olympic trials, while sprinter
Chryste Gaines and long jumper Jackie
Edwards both won national indoor titles to

help the women take second place in the
NCAA Indoor Championships in mid-March.
Fred Carter in the 3000 meter steeplechase,
Alex Accetta in the 800 and 1500 meters, and
Gary Stolz in the 5000 and 10000 meters are
also vying for NCAA and Olympic trial spots
this year.

'If you want to compare the
standards to basketball, quali
fying (for the NCAA's) is
about as hard as making the
Final Four or maybe the Final
Sixteen.'
— coach Brooks Johnson

"A lot of people don't realize how hard the
NCAA qualifying standards are," Johnson
said. "For example, in the long jump, the qual
ifying leap for this year's NCAA's (which is
26'6 1/4") would have placed you fourth or
fifth in the 1988 Olympics and fifth or sixth in
last year's World Championships.
"If you want to compare the standards to
basketball, qualifying is about as hard as mak
ing the Final Four or maybe the Final Sixteen."

Some talented freshman will be running
and jumping along with Stanford's seasoned
veterans. Travis Clark in the high jump and
sprints, John Price in the sprints, Anne Lee in
the triple jump, and Christy Boyd in the hur
dles have all made valuable team contribu
tions this spring.
Lee qualified for the Pacific 10 Conference
championships along with Dana Weeks in the
triple jump. Clark, according to Johnson, has
"international potential" and has qualified for
the Pac-10 championships in the high jump.
He and Price look to be the men's top sprint
ers for the future.
"This is usually when freshmen hit The
Wall," said Johnson. "We're watching them
closely because obviously they're our future."
1988 Olympic gold medalist and world
record holder Butch Reynolds will be running
in the 400 meters after serving most of a two
year suspension from amateur competition
due to testing positive for steroid use. Johnson,
who is Reynolds' coach, said that Reynolds has
been granted permission by the International
Amateur Athletic Federation (lAAF) to run in
four meets, including this one.
After this week, the Cardinal will send
seven or eight athletes to the Penn Relays,
which is one of the top Relay events in the
United States.
A star-studded event, the Relays will be fea
turing international superstars Carl Lewis and
Leroy Burrell in a 400 meter relay run this
year. The Penn Relays should be a good litmus
test for Cardinal athletes looking ahead toward
the Pac-10 and NCAA Championships.
As for the team's overall strength, though,
Johnson said, "The acid test will be against
Cal.
"Cal does not have the individual talent
that we have, but they have a lot of good peo
ple (for dual meet competitions)."
