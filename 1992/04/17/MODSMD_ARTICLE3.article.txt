# Six groups lose special fees
## 
### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
Six groups lost their special fee requests early this
morning after a night plagued by a series of ups and
downs.
Groups losing their requests were the Organization for
Arab-American Students in Stanford, Students for East
European Democracy, the Committee of Original Music,
Tuesday Films, the Stanford Chaparral and X-TV.
OASIS campaign coordinator Nawaar Kasrawi
expressed disappointment. "I am absolutely stunned," he
said. "I cannot understand the results. This is way out of
my wildest imagination. I mean, really."
"We are losing along with films no one watches, a
magazine that has put out horrible issues and a club for
- original-music? That's ridiculous," he said. —
Kasrawi attributed the weak showing to a general
misunderstanding of special fees. "I really don't think
students here fully understand the results of their

actions," he said.
"It just amazes me that we could do so poorly, with
out any negative campaigning done against us. I mean,
usually groups do this badly after other groups shove
them into the ground," Kasrawi said.
Walton Williamson, the X-TV technical director, said he
found his group's poor showing "rather disturbing."
"We made a big push this year and had a lot of air
time, but I guess we haven't accomplished our mission,
" he said. "We will be back, though, if the equipment
keeps working and we keep breathing."
Chaparral writer and undergraduate senator David
Hyatt said that he was not at all surprised by his pub
lication's loss. "We will just have to be more offensive
next time," he said.
Two student of color groups also came close to los
ing their fees ,-btti squeaked by with slim victories.
After MEChA, a Chicano/Latino student group,
received an initial count of 1083 to
1118, several members voiced
worry and disappointment.
Undergraduate Senator Russell
Calleros said, "I hope; we hang in
there. We have worked so hard
through this past year. I think we
are going to come back now,
though. This has been such a

strain." MEChA later received its
special fee by a vote 0f2670 to 2548.
"I knew that we were going to win,"
said MEChA member Maria
Peters.
"This is very indicative of the
magnitude of the campaign we had
and all of the hard work behind it.
When people come together, it
really pays off," she said. "This will
allow for MEChA to become the
organization that it has the ability
to become."
Peters added that she was not

surprised that the election proved
to be so close. "I knew it would be
a tight call, but it doesn't matter
now."
Tina Hua, of the Asian Ameri
can Students Association (AASA)
said she was scared of the first
results. "With only 1113 'yes'
votes and 1011 'no' votes, I am
really disappointed. I thought we
would definitely show better than
that," she said.
AASA later received the special
fee by a vote of 2867 to 2327.
