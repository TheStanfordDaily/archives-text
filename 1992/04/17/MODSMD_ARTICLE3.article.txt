Six groups lost their special fee requests early this
morning after a night plagued by a series of ups and
downs.
Groups losing their requests were the Organization for
Arab-American Students in Stanford, Students for East
European Democracy, the Committee of Original Music,
Tuesday Films, the Stanford Chaparral and X-TV.
OASIS campaign coordinator Nawaar Kasrawi
expressed disappointment. "I am absolutely stunned," he
said. "I cannot understand the results. This is way out of
my wildest imagination. I mean, really."
"We are losing along with films no one watches, a
magazine that has put out horrible issues and a club for
- original-music? That's ridiculous," he said. â€”
Kasrawi attributed the weak showing to a general
misunderstanding of special fees. "I really don't think
students here fully understand the results of their

actions," he said.
"It just amazes me that we could do so poorly, with
out any negative campaigning done against us. I mean,
usually groups do this badly after other groups shove
them into the ground," Kasrawi said.
Walton Williamson, the X-TV technical director, said he
found his group's poor showing "rather disturbing."
"We made a big push this year and had a lot of air
time, but I guess we haven't accomplished our mission,
" he said. "We will be back, though, if the equipment
keeps working and we keep breathing."
Chaparral writer and undergraduate senator David
Hyatt said that he was not at all surprised by his pub
lication's loss. "We will just have to be more offensive
next time," he said.
Two student of color groups also came close to los
ing their fees ,-btti squeaked by with slim victories.
