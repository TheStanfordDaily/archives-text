# Netters aiming for huge wins against Bruins, Trojans in LA
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Two weeks ago, the Cardinal men's tennis team
took on perhaps their toughest foes — UCLA and
USC — before a packed Stanford tennis stadium.
The Cardinal crushed UCLA 5-3, but lost a heart
breaking five-and-a-half-hour struggle to USC, 4-5.
This weekend the No. 1 Stanford men are down
on enemy territory, determined to show their rivals
exactly why they are the top-ranked team in the
nation.
However, the Southern boys should be tougher
than ever. They have the home-court advantage and
they now have healthier lineups than they did when
they visited the Farm two weeks ago. Especially
noticeable is the presence of Bruin senior Bill
Behrens, who is back in the UCLA lineup.
Cardinal head coach Dick Gould is looking for
ward to the matches. "It'll be an interesting chal
lenge to see how the guys do this weekend. I really
like what I see on this team — I see daily improve
ment in every one of them."
"If you'd have told me we'd be 18-1 this late in the
year I'd have said you're crazy," Gould said. "But
the thing is, it's not a fluke. The guys are playing

intelligently and doing a great job."
So the pre-season underdogs have established
themselves as one of the top tennis forces in the
nation, despite the fact that four of the six starters
are sophomores. Although they do not have the
experience or overwhelming dominance of team
mates Jason Yee and Alex O'Brien, these young men
seem to make up for it in competitive spirit.
Throughout the season, the Cardinal squad has
been turning heads because of it's drive and deter
mination. The team does not have the sprinkling of
big names which has so often graced Stanford's line
up over the years. But so far, the 1992 squad has
been successful. This weekend's battles with other
traditional tennis powerhouses should be a strong
indicator of exactly how successful the young Cardi
nal can be. With the NCAA Championships exactly
one month away, today and tomorrow's matches are
perceived by many to foreshadow the outcome of the
season's culminating tournament.
Coach Gould seems quietly confident of his team.
"They've passed all the tests up to now. They've got
to stay healthy — we've been very blessed that way
so far. I just hope that the guys use their heads and
compete well. If they play smart, the rest will take
care of itself."
