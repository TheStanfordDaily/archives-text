# Both women's and men's crew focused for home meet
## Rowers take on Aggies, look ahead to Potomac regatta and Pacific 10 Conference championships

You can call the Stanford men's and
women's crew many things, but short
sighted is not one of them.
Men's crew member Peter Guarraia
puts it clearly: "I'd like to think of every
race as another step towards the [Pacific
10 Conference Championships] and
Cincinnati (site of the 1992 U.S. Crew
Championships)."
And women's crew head coach Wendy
Davis also sums up her feelings well.
"You can never let down if you're
going to be a champion."
Both men's and women's crew teams
continue to strive for that "champion"
status as they meet UC-Davis in a dual
meet at Redwood Shores in Redwood City
this Saturday at 9 a.m. The meet will rep

resent the second league dual meet for
the men and the frosh women, and the
first league meet for the varsity women
since the San Diego Regatta two weeks
ago.
"UC-Davis was fast at San Diego,"
notes Davis. "They won their division
(the California Cup) there, and they'll
certainly be gunning for us Saturday."
Women's varsity rower Bonnie Baker,
a 1992 Olympic hopeful in the women's
crew event, has no problem getting moti
vated against the Aggies.
"I try to treat every race like the
Olympic trials, and I think the team can
sense that aggressiveness," she said.
"We're really looking forward to beating
them (by) as much as possible."
The Stanford varsity women's crew
will be putting their 3-1 league record on

'I try to treat every race like the Olympic trials, and I
think the team can sense that aggressiveness. We're really
looking forward to beating them (by) as much as possible.'

the line this Saturday, as well as getting a
much-needed warm-up for the Potomac
Championships in Washington, D.C. next
week.
Baker feels the Cardinal has histori
cally been overlooked by top teams such
as Harvard, Cornell, and Yale.
"I think the attitude (of Eastern
schools) is 'Oh, this school is from Califor
nia, they're not serious,"' Baker said. "I
really think we're going to scare them.

We're definitely going to do some damage."
The women are in third place in the
Pacific Coast League, behind powerhouse
Washington and behind second-place
California by one second.
On the men's side, senior Peter Guar
raia says that the team will have to watch
the Aggies right out of the blocks.
"UC-Davis is strong through the first
1000 (meters), and we tend to make our
move after that, so this will be a chance

for us to improve in the first half of the
race."
Guarraia expects the Cardinal to han
dle the Aggies with no problem, but he is
careful to note that the team does not
take the race lightly.
"Every race is important, and this is a
chance to show the Eastern schools that
we're ready for them," he said.
Senior teammate Steve Voorhis shares
the sentiment: "Sure, we should do well
(against Davis), but it's more a chance for
us to improve our times and get ready for
Potomacs. We can't let up."
The men occupy third place in the
tightly-clustered Pacific Coast league
standings. Washington and UCLA lead
the Cardinal by about three seconds, and
California is running right behind Stan
ford in fourth place.
