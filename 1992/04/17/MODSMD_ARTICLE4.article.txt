### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
A black-clad gunman on a motorcycle
fired shots at a group of about 20
rollerbladers leaving the parking garage
near Forsythe Hall late Wednesday night.
Police apprehended a man three hours
after the 9:30 p.m. incident, using the
description given by several of the
rollerbladers. None of the victims, who were
uninjured, are affiliated with Stanford.

Police officers from several jurisdic
tions chased the suspect around the Bay
Area before apprehending him in Moun
tain View, according to Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington.
Herrington said the suspect is a 17-
year-old from the Stanford area, but is
not from the University.
The teenager is also a suspect in
approximately 20 armed robberies of
automatic teller machines in Palo Alto
and several local cities, he added.

The suspect is currently being held in
a juvenile facility while awaiting charges
and a bail hearing, according to Herring
ton. It is up to the District Attorney and
the courts to decide whether he will be
tried as a youth or adult.
It is likely that the teenager will be
charged with attempted murder and flee
ing from police officers in conjunction
with the events of Wednesday night, as
well as several different incidents of
armed robbery in different jurisdictions,

Herrington said.
The shooting victims range in age
from approximately eight years to adults
in their mid-twenties. "There are some
pretty young kids involved," Herrington
said. "Needless to say, their parents were
pretty upset."
The incident occurred Wednesday night
when about twenty young people were
rollerblading in the parking structure,
Herrington said. A man on a black motor
cycle wearing a black jacket and helmet

rode through the structure several times
and nearly ran over some of the skaters.
Because of the near-miss, some of the
rollerbladers exchanged angry words
with the motorcyclist, Herrington said.
The cyclist then left the parking struc
ture and waited for the youths outside.
As the skaters left the parking garage,
the motorcyclist took out a gun, said Her
rington, adding that when the
rollerbladers saw the gun they
fled the scene immediately.
While the rollerbladers were
skating away, they were followed
by random gunfire. Some of the
skaters left the group, while
about ten skated to the Stanford
Medical Center and called the
police, Herrington said.
According to University
spokesperson Pete Rapalus, "It
looks like he was trying to scare
them or else he is the worst shot
in the world."
Between eight and ten of
the young people have talked
with the police, Herrington
said.
