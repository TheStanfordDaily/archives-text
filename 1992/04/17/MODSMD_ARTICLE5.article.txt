# Denial of clemency for killer criticized
## 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
Gov. Pete Wilson's decision to
deny convicted murderer Robert
Alton Harris' clemency appeal yes
terday drew criticism from anti
death penalty activists on campus.
"I feel in a way I'm kind of
numb. .. . It's such an uphill bat
tle against the death penalty,"
said junior Ann Kim, a member of
Stanford's Amnesty Internation
al student chapter.
Amnesty has planned a protest
march today as part of human
rights week.
Wilson's denial of Harris'
clemency appeal is "all the more
reason," to have the march and
rally as planned, said Jane
Jerome, the Mid-peninsula Area
Coordinator for Amnesty.
Wilson announced his decision
last night, saying his "compassion for
Robert Alton Harris the child," could
not "excuse or forgive the choice
made by Robert Harris the man,"
according to the Associated Press.

Law Prof. Robert Weisberg said
it is "theoretically possible but
highly unlikely" that further
appeals by Harris will succeed.
Harris' execution, which will take
place on Tuesday, will be the first
execution in California in 25 years.
Harris' sentence is for the
murder of two teenagers in San
Diego in 1978.
Weisberg said he expected Wil
son's decision.

However, Jerome said the deci
sion was still "a big disappointment."
According to Weisberg, grant
ing clemency is a "subjective" call
that lies with the governor, and
therefore personal conviction and
political considerations are the
overriding factors in making the
decision.
"This governor has been a
(strong) proponent of the death
penalty He probably did what he

believed was right," Weisberg said.
Had Wilson been ambivalent
about the decision, he would likely
have still made the same call or it
would have been"the end of Pete
Wilson's political career in the
Republican Party," Weisberg
added.
Kim said she wants people to
concentrate on addressing the
causes of violent acts like Harris',
and focussing on the death penal

ty "detracts from the whole issue
[and] doesn't solve anything."
Amnesty opposes the death
penalty as "cruel and unusual
punishment," Jerome said.
Harris' attorneys had argued
that he was not fully accountable
for his actions and that he was
mentally impaired as a result of
severe physical abuse as a child,
according to Weisberg.
In addition, recent evidence

had shown that "his mother was
heavily drinking during his preg
nancy," he said, possibly causing
him to suffer from Fetal Alcohol
Syndrome.
Harris' attorneys had tried
without success to get him a hear
ing to introduce this evidence and
possibly re-open his case.
Today's march from the Bech
tel International Center at 12:15
will end in a Palo Alto rally.
