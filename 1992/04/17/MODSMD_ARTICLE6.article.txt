## Pledge function draws neighbors' complaints 
### Kimberly Chrisman Julia Sobrevilla Editorial staff 
Police responded last night to complaints of
noise at a sorority pledge party held at Hoover
House, the residence of University President
Donald Kennedy and his wife Robin.
Although the Kennedys said they had not
authorized alcohol consumption, partygoers
were seen carrying a keg of beer and cham
pagne bottles and drinking from Budweiser
cups. The Kennedys were inside the house
while the party took place on the lawn and
patio.
"There was absolutely no . . . authorized
drinking of alcohol," said Robin Kennedy.
She said the party was organized in part
by her cousin, senior Michelle Forrest, who
is living with the Kennedys temporarily.
Forrest is a member of the Pi Beta Phi soror
ity, which sponsored the event with the

Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.
Robin Kennedy said she didn't
know exactly what kind of party it
was, but thought it was "some
kind of end-of-Rush event."
According to Pi Phi President
Jennifer Hintz, the party was a
prelude to the "Pi Phi Presents"
pledge party, which she described
as "something we do with SAE
every year.
"We always take them to a pri
vate house" for a pre-party, Hintz
said.
President Kennedy described
the event as "a small party." SAE
president Allen Thorpe estimated
that 50 people were present at the

height of the party. Other esti
mates ranged to 80.
When the police arrived short
ly after 10:00 p.m. in response to
noise complaints, the crowd dis
persed quickly. However, Robin
Kennedy said the police's arrival
was incidental to the party break
ing up because the students had
already started leaving for the
SAE party.
Thorpe agreed, saying "people
had left, basically," by the time
the police arrived.
According to Forrest, the police
left after speaking briefly with
Robin Kennedy who assured
them that all was well.
To comply with federal law, the
University has prohibited the
consumption of alcohol by
minors. When it was introduced
in 1990, the policy was hotly con

tested because Stanford had a
longstanding tradition of leaving
choices concerning alcohol con
sumption to individual students.
"I don't know that there was
drinking going on at all," Thorpe
said. "There were a few people
drinking, but I don't know what
they were drinking."
"As far as I'm aware there was
no underage drinking," said
Hintz. "I don't know where the
alcohol came from."
Representatives of the Office of
Public Safety refused to comment
on the incident last night.
"I am not privy to release any
kind of information to you," said
Patrol Officer Adrienne Moore. "I
can't even tell you if it was a
party."
Deputy Frank Roublick said,
"All I can tell you is there was a

noise complaint and we answered
it. That was it."
Robin Kennedy said it is likely
that neighbors complained about
noise from the party. "The noise
up on this hill is really incredi
ble," she said.
The neighbors might have
"thought the house was being
robbed," Forrest said.
"There was lots of noise," Hintz
said, adding that much of the noise
was caused by sorority members
teaching pledges Pi Phi songs. "It's
a bonding event," she said.
While residents of Slavianskii
Dom and other Row houses said
they could hear the party, Inter
fraternity Council President
Steve Jarrett and Intersorority
Council President Adriana Duffy
both said they were not aware
that the party had taken place.

"I've never heard of a party
being held at Hoover House
before by a fraternity or a sorori
ty," Jarrett said. "It comes as a
surprise to me that [Kennedy]
would be willing to let them have
a party there, but if he did, then
it's good news for all of us. I know
I'd Uke to have a party there."
Robin Kennedy said she hopes
to invite more campus groups to
use the house in the future.
"Don and I have felt strongly
for a long time that this isn't our
house but a Stanford house, and
we are housing some University
events," she said.
According to one sorority
member at the party, Kennedy
agreed to the party being held at
Hoover House "because we asked
him and he likes the Pi Phis. He's
a really cool guy."
