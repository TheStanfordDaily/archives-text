# Morning-after pill provided by Cowell remains controversial
## Officials try to avoid debate, provide basic information

Stanford's distribution of the "morning-after"
pill has divided members of the community, from
students who call use of the controversial contracep
tive "playing God" to those who defend a woman's
right to any birth control.
The pill, which must be taken within 72 hours of
intercourse, is used as a retroactive means of pre
venting pregnancy after rape, contraceptive failure or
unprotected sex. It can prevent a fertilized egg from
developing, causing what some say is an abortion.
Any Stanford student can obtain the pill at Cow
ell Student Health Center, according to staff physi
cian John Dorman, although it is not recommended
as a form of birth control.
However, some students object to the distribution
of the pill on campus.
According to sophomore Linda Garcia, "It sounds
like people are playing God. It's like playing Russian
roulette — if conception has begun, you're killing a
baby. You're potentially killing someone."
But sophomore Jill McDonough opposed this
view, stressing the importance of "access to all forms
of birth control," including the morning- after pill.
"It is cruel to wish an unborn child on a woman
who does not want it, and it is sadistic to hope that a
woman who does not bear this child is hurt" when
she takes the pill, said McDonough, a staffer at Ye

Olde Safer Sex Shoppe.
Both Cowell and Contraceptive Information Cen
ter employees avoid concretely categorizing the pill
as either contraception or abortion.
"I have struggles with my own personal beliefs
about the morning-after pill sometimes, but I just
try and provide all the information I can about the
woman's options," Dorman said.
However, "you can argue about the morality, but
the morning-after pill is preferable to becoming
pregnant and getting an abortion," he added.
Stanford's policy regarding the morning-after pill
is relatively liberal compared to other schools such
as San Diego State University.
According to Allison Winn, head of SDSU's Pro
ject RISK, an AIDS education program, the morning
after pill is only available on her campus for emer
gency situations such as rape or failed contraception.
Presently, only a doctor can prescribe the morning
after pill at Cowell, although the health center's admin
istration may be trying to set out certain circumstances
in which a nurse could distribute it, Dorman said.
Although Cowell is the only place in the commu
nity that distributes the morning-after pill, he
added, women who do not attend Stanford cannot
receive the pill from the health center, even if their
partner is a student.
Dorman said that once a woman goes to either the
CIC or Cowell, she receives information on all aspects

of the morning-after pill and its ramifications.
The doctor then determines if she is in the middle of
her ovulation cycle, when her chances of getting preg

nant from a single, unprotected act are the greatest.
After a woman takes the pill, Dorm an explained,
the high levels of estrogen prevent the implantation
of a fertilized egg in the uterine lining.
Another similar method involves Ovral, the ingredi
ent in birth control pills. Taking four birth control pills
in a 12-hour period is 98.4 percent as effective as the
use of estrogen and does not have as many side effects.
The morning-after pill is not the same as RU-486,
commonly known as the "abortion pill," Dorman
said. RU-486 can be take up to several weeks after
intercourse and aborts a developing fetus. Its use is
currently not legal in the United States.
Senior Katie Lipkin, an employee at the CIC, said
the center's role is simply to provide information
about the morning-afterpill. "We are not trying to
persuade anyone. We just refer them to a variety of
different organizations that can help."
According to Dorman, "There are a couple of cir
cumstances where a guy comes in with the girl and
seems to want her to take the pill, while she is
unsure. Then I try to get her by herself to decide."
Some, like sophomore Courtney Brown, expressed
concern that the easy access to the morning-after pill
does not force women to take responsibility for their
sexual behavior.
Brown said she believes that the pill is "a way of
sidestepping one's actions, just like abortion. It
allows people to be sexually irresponsible."
As an alternative, Brown urged education about
"moral responsibility. You hear all of these people talk
ing about condoms, but nobody talks about abstinence."
