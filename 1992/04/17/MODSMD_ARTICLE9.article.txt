# U. of Chicago president to step down; Casper was considered heir
## 
### Skip Schwartz 
University of Chicago President
Hanna Gray announced her resignation
this week, less than a month after Chica
go's presidential heir-apparent accepted
Stanford's top post.
Most Chicago faculty and students
would have loved to have seen former
Provost Gerhard Casper succeed Gray,
according to student body president
Jason Frank.
Casper, who will take over from Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy Sept.
1, "was in all the minds as the possible

next president," said Frank.
Gray said Tuesday that she will resign
after the 1992-93 academic year, ending
her 15th year as university president.
Frank said the announcement came as
no surprise to most, and was greeted with
mixed emotions.
Many students felt that Gray repre
sented the "cold conservatism of the Uni
versity of Chicago's administration," but
she did a good job in areas such as fund
raising, Frank said.
In a letter sent to members of the uni
versity's community, Gray said she feels
"it is timely to review and to set direc

tions for the next chapter in the universi
ty's life and to make the transition to a
new generation of leadership."
According to Frank, many Chicago
students and faculty expected that such a
transition would have included Casper.
But Jean Fetter, executive vice-chair
of the Stanford search committee that
recommended Casper, said the commit
tee did not hurry their search because of
rumors that Casper would succeed Gray.
The committee had until June to make
a recommendation, but finished last
month instead.
"We did not know about the resigna

tion," said Fetter, "and it had nothing to
do with search. ... We knew what we
wanted to accomplish and we set out to
seek the best person."
Casper said his decision to come to
Stanford was made independently of
Gray's retirement plans. He called the
decision a positive one for Stanford, not a
negative one for Chicago.
He was not necessarily looking to
become a university president, he said,
but was "captivated" by the search com
mittee. Although he likes teaching,
Casper said Stanford approached him
and "made a wonderfully convincing

case."
Casper said he feels Gray came to the
conclusion after 15 years that it was time
to return to teaching. Gray is a professor
in the university's Department of History
with a specialization in the Renaissance.
Fetter said she considers it "no signif
icant surprise" that Gray will resign after
15 years because "the average life" of a
college president is six to seven years.
Casper described Gray as a very distin
guished president who "helped the uni
versity grow stronger.
"It is a very strong institution. The
university will go on," he said.
