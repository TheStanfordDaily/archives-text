We've given biotechnology
an interesting new twist.
Our recombinant DNA technology has yielded
products that help people combat a variety of
serious medical conditions. And, with four FDA
approved products and many more in clinical
trials, we've proven our long-term commitment
to advances in biotechnology.
To continue this, we invest 50% of our annual
revenues in research which enables us to
concentrate on new projects every year. And, has
resulted in the on-going expansion of our
research facilities. Our most important
investment, however, is in our people. We find
the best possible people for every area of our
organization.
People who share our commitment to changing
the shape of the biotechnology industry.
