Peru's VP challenges Fujimori
LIMA, Peru (AP) — Vice-President Maximo San Roman said yes
terday he would form a rival government to oppose President Alberto
Fujimori, who two weeks ago imposed military-backed one-man rule.
San Roman, who returned late Saturday from the United
States, told reporters he would set up his own Cabinet on the
grounds that Fujimori's April 5 decision to close Congress and the
courts was unconstitutional.
He later told The Associated Press in an interview that the
rival government would be announced on Tuesday.
The 46-year-old San Roman, once a close ally of Fujimori, has
repeatedly condemned Fujimori's power-grab, and claims to have
the support of high-ranking military officials in his bid to restore
democracy.
Fujimori has not publicly stated whether he still considers San
Roman to be vice president, but said last week that San Roman
would be free to speak "so long as he doesn't obstruct the acts of
the Emergency government of National Reconstruction."
In the interview, he said he was not concerned about his safety.
"There is no one with any moral authority who can touch me,"
he said, adding that he expected the military would support him.
"The high military command went along with the coup because
at the time Fujimori was the commander of the armed forces,"
San Roman said. "But they will eventually accept our constitu
tional government."
Delay in Harris execution overturned
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal appeals court yesterday
overturned a judge's order that would have delayed the scheduled
execution of Robert Alton Harris.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a statement late
Sunday that Judges Arthur Alarcon and Melvin Brunetti had over
turned the 10-day stay of execution, issued Saturday by U.S. District
Judge Marilyn Hall Patel. A third judge, John T. Noonan, dissented.
Patel had issued a 10-day stay of execution because of a lawsuit
filed by the American Civil Liberties Union claiming that execu
tion in the gas chamber was cruel and unusual pounishment. She
had scheduled a hearing on April 28 on the matter.
The decision could put Harris in the gas chamber at 12:01 a.m.
Tuesday.
A spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union, which
filed the lawsuit, confirmed the appeals court's decision but could
not comment about any further legal action that would be filed.
The restraining order Saturday came after defense lawyers
filed a last-minute class-action lawsuit claiming there was suffi
cient evidence for a federal court to consider whether death by
lethal gas is unconstitutional under protections against cruel and
unusual punishment.
