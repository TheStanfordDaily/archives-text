## A 						Pyrrhic triumph 
### 
Win of 'Prefer' can only
have damaging impact
on student input, needs

The narrow victory of
"I Prefer Not to Have a
COP" in the ASSU election
— and the ratification, at least by a
disgruntled quarter of the elec
torate, of the slate's pledge to dis
band the COP — will limit Stan
ford students' ability to influence
the shape of their university.
The COP's most important
function is to act as the designated
student representatives. While it
often isn't a visible power — and it
certainly wasn't apparent to stu
dents who believed the "Prefer"
slate's demagogic claims — it is a
considerable power.
By serving on University com
mittees, meeting with administra
tors to make student opinion heard
in cloistered decision-making pro
cesses, and lobbying the senate to
fund necessary projects — such as
the sexual assault prevention coor
dinator — the COP improves stu
dent lives in a variety of ways.
The loss of that influence could
not have come at a more critical
time, as an entirely new adminis
tration takes over and the Univer
sity seeks to reinvent itself in the
wake of $43 million in budget cuts.
By voting to abolish the COFJ
students voted to abolish much of
the input they could have had dur
ing this crucial year, and robbed
themselves of a chance to play an
effective role in the transition.
But students cannot take all of
the blame. The new preferential
voting system — which allowed
the "Prefer" slate to win while
claiming only 27 percent of the
total vote — certainly lubricated
the slate's power grab.
And this year's COF) which has
been criticized as being inattentive
to student concerns, deserves
blame for failing to adequately
communicate their actions to stu

dents. The result of one of the sur
vey questions on the ballot — in
which an astonishing 82 percent of
voters said the ASSU Council of
Presidents does not benefit them
— demonstrated the current
COP's lackluster public relations
performance.
This year's election highlights a
widespread dissatisfaction among
the student body. Along with the
troubling win of "Prefer," the per
centages received by special fee
requests were down by about 5
percent across the board, and six
groups were turned down entirely.
In a disempowering year of bud
get cuts, in which students were
left angry but without a clear fig
ure to blame, the election may
have provided a vehicle for stu
dents to convey their disenchant
ment. The clever campaign propa
ganda of the "Prefer" slate,
papered in the bathroom stalls of
each dorm, played into students'
anger by setting up this year's
COP as a convenient target.
"We're having the BIGGEST
tuition hike in ten years despite the
fact that the current C.O.P tried to
prevent it," one of the "Prefer"
fliers reads. But blaming the COP
for the tuition hike is an irrational
argument — the Board of
Trustees, which approved the hike,
would be a better place to start.
The question remains: When
the COP is abolished, what will
take its place? Ed Mun, the leader
of the "Prefer" slate, said abolish
ing the COP will inspire responsi
bility in senators like him, who
missed meetings and neglected
their duties.
It is a leap of faith that should
be treated with no small amount of
skepticism. The senate has proven
itself incapable of efficiently
resolving even the smallest issues.
And as a legislative body, the sen
ate is not equipped to respond
quickly and effectively as the stu
dents' representatives.
Abolishing the COP is billed as a
one-year "experiment," but this is
an experiment that will have last
ing, damaging consequences.
