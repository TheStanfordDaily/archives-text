University should hire Disability Studies expert

IT HAS RECENTLY come to my
attention that, as of now, at the end of
this school year, Stanford will not
offer Dr. Paul Longmore a position on its
faculty — and will discontinue its classes
on Disability Studies. This would ba a
travesty.
Dr. Longmore is perhaps the nation's
most respected scholar in Disability Stud
ies and disability rights. He is a leader in
a field which is now being studied at
numerous institutions throughout the
country.
One cannot engage in any type of seri
ous academic discourse concerning the
issues confronting people with disabilities

in today's world without reading Long
more's work. It is a tribute to him that
his writings are used in a variety of disci
plines, extending from sociology to law to
medicine to history.
People with disabilities are now recog
nized as a full-fledged minority, with a
unique history and culture. The 1990
Americans with Disabilities Act is being
hailed as the most sweeping civil rights
legislation in over 25 years: The ADA
stands as proof that even in a time of con
servative leadership, the political estab
lishment is willing to classify people with
disabilities in a minority status.
With 46 million Americans who identi

fy themselves as having disabilities
(approximately 20 percent of our popula
tion), this is also the largest minority in
the nation.
Just as resources are expended to
study the history and culture of numer
ous other groups, such as Asian-Ameri
can Studies and Gender Studies, etc.,
Stanford — in its dedication to multicul
turalism — has a responsibility to offer at
least one course in Disability Studies.
Havingjust completed an exhaustive
study of the evolution of federal legisla
tion and American social policy for people
with disabilities for the UCLA Law
Review, it is my opinion that not to offer

a course would constitute a grave omis
sion from a curriculum pledged to
embrace pluralism.
Stanford has a treasure in Dr. Long
more, and yet the University seems not to
realize it. As one of the leading universities
in the world, Stanford has, time and time
again, voiced a commitment to study the
essential threads in the American fabric.
To fail to hire Longmore, and more so,
to abandon all Disability Studies, would
be an unforgivable breach of that com
mitment.
