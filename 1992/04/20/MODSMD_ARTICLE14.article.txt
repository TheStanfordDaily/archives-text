# Reporting of party at Hoover House biased
## 
### 
Robin and I want to thank The Daily
for its helpful promotion of the Hoover
House Spring Social Series.
The account of Cousin Michelle's
party turned an innocuous (though
enthusiastic) gathering of a few dozen
friends into a Greek orgy.
For those who thought the date on Fri
day's Daily was April 1 instead of April 17,
we should make it clear that (a) we weren't
there, but came at 10 p.m. when the party
was breaking up; (b) that no alcohol was
served by us, by Cousin Michelle, or by her
friends; (c) that if Banned Substances were
seen by your reporter they were missed
both by the police officer (who pronounced
it a "nice" event) and by us.
The second event in the series has
already taken place on the lawn on Satur
day; it was approved on a standard basis,
viz. that the Hoover House lawn is like a
park and welcomes Stanford groups as
long as they're neat and not rowdy.
That may sound stuffy, but just wait.
The next party, we understand, is the joint
Council of Presidents/Daily news staff" rock
and roll festival. Still in the planning

stages, it is expected to begin in the base
ment, with liftoff scheduled for midnight
on an unannounced Saturday night.
Refreshments are the responsibility of a
COP committee representing all con
stituencies; they haven't been able to decide
what to serve yet, because they can't find a
room big enough to hold all 214 of them.
But the Daily folks have already con
cluded that it doesn't matter anyhow.
Whatever it is, they plan to put it in a
Bud cup and call it beer.
See you there.
