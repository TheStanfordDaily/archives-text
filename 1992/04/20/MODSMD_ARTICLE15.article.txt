# Gay student, roommate respond in joint letter
## 
### 
This letter is in response to the article
in the April 15 issue of The Daily about
the rooming situation in Hammarsjkold.
There are many important issues that
came out of the Tuesday night discus
sion. One of the most significant results
of the meeting is the sincere attempt to
understand each other's viewpoints.
Although there are many things that we
still disagree about, we feel that we are able
to communicate and talk about our feelings.

I, Owen, feel that while the issue of
living with a gay man remains problem
atic for me, my discussions with Barney
have convinced me that there is some
thing that I should attempt to resolve. I
also have appreciated his attempts to
understand my position and educate me
about the impact of my actions on him.
Although, I, Barney, still don't agree
with many of his ideas, I'm glad that we
both made an effort to talk about the
incident.
I don't think I have completely dis
pelled his anxieties and fears about room
ing with a gay person, but I believe that
our discussions have made him examine
those feelings more closely and critically.
