# MEChA does represent diverse student needs
## 
### 
Contrary to recent allegations con
cerning the Chicano and Latino commu
nity, we have proudly upheld a tradition
of diversity. The more than 15 Chicano
and Latino student organizations, which

range from pre-professional to social and
political, represent the diversity of our
vibrant community.
The strength of our community lies not
only in the participation of Chicano and
Latino students in organizations within
our own community, but also in their
active involvement in organizations in
other parts of the Stanford community,
including many fraternities and sororities.
In the coming weeks all of the Stan
ford community will have great opportu
nities to learn about our history and
heritage. Cinco de Mayo events and the
Concierto de la Primavera are some of
the many programs which contribute to
a greater understanding of the Chicano
and Latino community.
The lack of knowledge about our his
tory and diversity contributed to the loss
of MEChA's special fee request in last
year's Spring elections. This clearly
demonstrates the crucial need for the
funding of events which will allay these
misunderstandings.
We would like to extend an open invi
tation to the entire Stanford community
to share in future events of the Chicano
and Latino community.
