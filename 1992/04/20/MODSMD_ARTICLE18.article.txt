## From Bart to Bartleby 
### 
NEVER SATISFIED with the previ
ous week's negative publicity,
Stanford once again groped for
national attention last week as students
decided the Council of Presidents could
have the year off.
Seizing the advice of a forged editorial,
voters "preferred" the COP slate that
promised not to serve if elected, to any of
the other three slates, and in an odd sort
of asterisk-in-the-record-book way, the
Daily editorial board's streak of picking
winners was kept alive.
Arguably the COP result was consis
tent with the calls for change that have
enabled yahoos such as former California
Gov. Jerry Brown to make sustained bids
for the presidency.
Except that we went even further:
Anyone can vote for an outsider preach
ing change; we voted for Real Change —
by scrapping the whole office!
Move over Bart Simpson; a cartoon
character in the ASSU Senate is old news.
It's Bartleby time, and here come the
national media, their anti-Stanford virus
es ready to pounce.
Quick quiz: What position is about to
become the ASSU's most powerful?
Answer: senate chair. And there may still
be time for you to apply. It pays well, and
with no COP, you'd be the voice of the stu
dents in talking to University administra
tors.
What's more, you don't even have to go

through a long campaign process where
you have to convince the whole campus to
vote for you. The senate decides for itself.
And here's the good part. Ron Brown,
of the COP slate "Independents: A New
Era," and John Hall, of the Students First
slate, are both considering applying.
Which means that a representative of a
less-preferable slate may well fill the vac
uum left by the most-preferred slate
when it prefers not to serve.
But this time you can't blame the
ASSU. You the voter blew this one. (OK,
the preferential voting scheme helped;
were there a runoff, "I Prefer Not to Have
a COP" likely wouldn't win since more stu
dents voted for having one COP or another
than voted against the office altogether.)
Meanwhile, for those who would prefer
to do away with representative democracy
on a national level, Texas billionaire Ross
Perot stands waiting, money in hand, if
you'll only get him on the fall ballot.
Among Perot's tenets: Let's take away-
Congress' power to tax, and conduct elec
tronic national town meetings so that all
good Athenians can decide for themselves
how to be taxed.
But hey, he's not mainstream, so let's
vote for him.
We are in the midst of, for lack of a bet
ter term, an anti-establishment rage that
seems to have transcended all boundaries.
Republicans are mad at Bush; Democrats
are mad at Clinton; everyone's mad at

Congress — but these are all standard
sentiments, complaints we've heard
before.
Distaste for government seems to have
been replaced by something larger; an
urge to do more than disapprove — a need
to express that disapproval in a manner
that damages the institutions at which
the disapproval is directed.
Can the results of the COP election be
considered an epiphenomenon of the
anger we are witnessing nationally, or is
the "Prefer" slate's victory simply a
reflection of the latest cool thing to do?
The latter would describe Stanford's
version of "kick the bums out" as merely
coincidental to national anger. But if the
former is true, then perhaps we are near
ing some sort of political crisis.
Clearly, the COP failed to demonstrate
the need for its existence to enough stu
dents to survive. Perhaps national gov
ernment's current raison d'etre is equally
lacking.
Our leaders — be they students or can
didates for president — have to find a new
vision. We should prefer to utilize a gov
ernment.
