# ASSU committee approves plan to ax funding for incoming COP
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Trying to force next year's
Council of Presidents to keep
their campaign promise, the
ASSU budget and finance com
mittee voted Friday to eliminate
all funding for the slate.
The $17,100 worth of budget
amendments — which must
receive approval from at least two
thirds of the ASSU Senate —
divert the money to a reserve fund,
increase some ASSU salaries and
create a new polling group.
"I'm just trying to help them,"
said current COP member John
Overdeck, referring to the"I Pre
fer Not to Have a COP" slate.
"And I think I'm better able to
do it than the bozos [students]
elected."
Overdeck proposed the
amendments
The Prefer slate pledged that
they would abolish their office
and use the salary for student
projects. Slate member Ed Mun
said the changes "sort of made
[him] uncomfortable," but said he
assumed the committee "knew
what they were doing" and the
salary increases are necessary.
While he favored the removal

of the COP's money, Mun said
he was surprised at the very bit
ter tone of the committee meet
ing, which he attended.
The amendments would
remove the

and all but
$2,000 dollars
from the COP

salary. The
$2,000 will be used to pay the
salary of a COP next summer if
one is elected in next year's
spring election, Overdeck said.
The salary increases funded
by the COP money include an
extra $1,100 for the ASSU
administrative manager, $500
for the deputy senate chair and
$1,000 for employees in the
Financial Aid Advocacy Office.
Overdeck said the increases
are necessary because of the
increased workloads next year
when there is no COP. The com
mittee also recommended $5,000
in salaries for a new phone-polling
organization to be run by the stu
dent government next year.
