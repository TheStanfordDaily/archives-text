# ASSU committee approves plan to ax funding for incoming COP
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Trying to force next year's
Council of Presidents to keep
their campaign promise, the
ASSU budget and finance com
mittee voted Friday to eliminate
all funding for the slate.
The $17,100 worth of budget
amendments — which must
receive approval from at least two
thirds of the ASSU Senate —
divert the money to a reserve fund,
increase some ASSU salaries and
create a new polling group.
"I'm just trying to help them,"
said current COP member John
Overdeck, referring to the"I Pre
fer Not to Have a COP" slate.
"And I think I'm better able to
do it than the bozos [students]
elected."
Overdeck proposed the
amendments
The Prefer slate pledged that
they would abolish their office
and use the salary for student
projects. Slate member Ed Mun
said the changes "sort of made
[him] uncomfortable," but said he
assumed the committee "knew
what they were doing" and the
salary increases are necessary.
While he favored the removal

of the COP's money, Mun said
he was surprised at the very bit
ter tone of the committee meet
ing, which he attended.
The amendments would
remove the

m
ELECTION

COP's oper
ating expens
es and discre
tionary funds
and all but
$2,000 dollars
from the COP

salary. The
$2,000 will be used to pay the
salary of a COP next summer if
one is elected in next year's
spring election, Overdeck said.
The salary increases funded
by the COP money include an
extra $1,100 for the ASSU
administrative manager, $500
for the deputy senate chair and
$1,000 for employees in the
Financial Aid Advocacy Office.
Overdeck said the increases
are necessary because of the
increased workloads next year
when there is no COP. The com
mittee also recommended $5,000
in salaries for a new phone-polling
organization to be run by the stu
dent government next year.
He proposed the changes to
hold the slate to their promise
and make sure it doesn't use any
student money to buy personal
items like beer, Overdeck said.
Mun said he is glad the commit
tee removed the money "because
we were going to do it anyway."
But he said he was disappoint
ed that none of the money had
been transferred into student
projects, adding that he is looking
into writing a bill to transfer the
$9,500 added to the contingency
reserve into the Community Ser
vice Board's fund instead.
The contingency reserve is a
fund "designed to cover problems
in the budget if you overspend on
other accounts," according to
graduate senator Doug Bone, co
chair of the budget committee.
Mun said the only project
planned by the slate is a board to
gather ideas for ASSU projects
and help students develop and
run those projects. But the group
would not be salaried, he added,
and would not need funding.

The Prefer slate needs only a
small amount of money for photo
copying to meet their goal of plac
ing an amendment dismantling
the COP on next year's spring
ballot, according to Mun.
Overdeck said the polling
group, allotted $5,000 by an
amendment, would be needed to
keep the ASSU Senate informed
about student opinion, since stu
dent government has been "criti
cized summarily for being out of
touch" with students.
"The senate has had a great deal
of difficulty in knowing what the
students want," Overdeck said. "If
we really do care about student
opinion, we will try to gather it."
Graduate senator Larry
Augustin, another committee
member, said he was "a little leery"
of taking money from COP salaries
to "spread it around elsewhere."
Overdeck, however, said he
thought the committee could be jus
tified in compensating people who
will have an increased workload.
The original budget gave the
COP $16,400 in salaries next
year, along with $1,700 in operat
ing expenses and a $1,000 discre
tionary fund to be spent on ASSU
projects.

and make sure it doesn't use any
student money to buy personal
items like beer, Overdeck said.
Mun said he is glad the commit
tee removed the money "because
we were going to do it anyway."
But he said he was disappoint
ed that none of the money had
been transferred into student
projects, adding that he is looking
into writing a bill to transfer the
$9,500 added to the contingency
reserve into the Community Ser
vice Board's fund instead.
The contingency reserve is a
fund "designed to cover problems
in the budget if you overspend on
other accounts," according to
graduate senator Doug Bone, co
chair of the budget committee.
Mun said the only project
planned by the slate is a board to
gather ideas for ASSU projects
and help students develop and
run those projects. But the group
would not be salaried, he added,
and would not need funding.

The Prefer slate needs only a
small amount of money for photo
copying to meet their goal of plac
ing an amendment dismantling
the COP on next year's spring
ballot, according to Mun.
Overdeck said the polling
group, allotted $5,000 by an
amendment, would be needed to
keep the ASSU Senate informed
about student opinion, since stu
dent government has been "criti
cized summarily for being out of
touch" with students.
"The senate has had a great deal
of difficulty in knowing what the
students want," Overdeck said. "If
we really do care about student
opinion, we will try to gather it."
Graduate senator Larry
Augustin, another committee
member, said he was "a little leery"
of taking money from COP salaries
to "spread it around elsewhere."
Overdeck, however, said he
thought the committee could be jus
tified in compensating people who
will have an increased workload.
The original budget gave the
COP $16,400 in salaries next
year, along with $1,700 in operat
ing expenses and a $1,000 discre
tionary fund to be spent on ASSU
projects.
