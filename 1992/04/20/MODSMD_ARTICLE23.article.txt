## Tennis swept by Bruins, Trojans 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
The blazing trail to a nation
al title for the Stanford men's
tennis team took a little swerve
this weekend as the Cardinal
lost at both USC and UCLA.
The 18-3 men lost a close fight
to the Trojans, 5-3, and then
were "blasted off the court" by
the Bruins, 6-0, according to
Cardinal head coach Dick
Gould.
The highlight of Friday's
match was a first doubles tri
umph by Alex O'Brien and
Chris Cocotos over top-ranked
duo Brian MacPhie and Jon
Leach, 7-6, 6-1. The Stanford
pair's only losses this season
have been to this team.
"That was a big win for us
and a great confidence booster
for the guys," Gould said.
Cocotos was the only Cardi
nal player to win both his
matches Friday. His straight
set win over David Ekerot at
fourth singles helped keep the
Cardinal evenly in the match.
Jason Yee's 6-3, 6-2 routing
of Kent Seton at sixth singles
gave the Cardinal another
chance at victory.
"We were down 4-1 and
Jason kept us in the ballgame,"
Gould said. "He had a great
weekend."
As in previous matches with
USC, Stanford seemed to be
playing catch-up all day. At
first singles, MacPhie avenged
his straight-set loss to O'Brien
two weeks ago by defeating the
Stanford senior 6-2, 4-6, 6-3.
Michael Flanagan also lost a
close one in the second slot.
Squandering a 5-1 lead in the
first set, the Stanford sopho
more lost 7-6, 6-4. In his rela
tively new position at third sin
gles, sophomore Vimal Patel
lost to Leach in three sets.
At fifth singles, Robert
Devens was defeated by Andras
Lanyi for the second time in
two weeks. At second doubles,
Yee and Patel also lost to the
same team, Ekerot and Lanyi,
who defeated them at Stan
ford. Third doubles was sus
pended when USC clinched
second doubles to win the
match.
Saturday, the doubles teams
didn't even have a chance to
pull out a win for the Cardinal.
Every Stanford singles player
lost his first set, and four men
quickly lost their second sets as
well. Only Devens and Yee at
fifth and sixth singles pushed
their opponents to three sets.
"We just hit a sky-high
UCLA team," Gould said.
"Their strength is at the 2, 3
and 4 spots and they showed it
against us.
"You'd have to say that
UCLA — having just beaten us

and USC — is playing some of
the best tennis in the country.
We'll have to be playing just
right to beat them."
Although the recently
injured Bill Behrens made his
presence known by defeating
Cocotos at fourth singles, one
of the Bruins' best players, Bill
Barber, sat out with an injury.
Two weeks ago, Barber defeat
ed Flanagan at second singles
in straight sets.

'We just hit a sky
high UCLA team.
Their strength is
at the 2, 3 and 4
spots and they
showed it against
us.'
— coach Gould

Saturday, it was David
Nainkin who disposed of
Flanagan at the second slot, 7-
5, 6-4. O'Brien also lost in
straight sets at the top of the
lineup to Mark Knowles. In
their duel at Stanford, O'Brien
came out on top.
"0.8. was struggling a bit
on Saturday," Gould noted.
At the third spot, Patel was
bulldozed, 6-1, 6-4.
"I was a bit disappointed,"
Gould said. "He needed to use
his head a little more."
Overall, Gould felt the day
was "a good summary of where
we're at if everyone's not at
100 percent." Filling the big
shoes of alum giants Jared
Palmer and Jon Stark has not
been easy for the sophomores
on the squad.
"We're still a little soft at the
top of the lineup," Gould said.
"We're not quite where we need
to be. Mike (Flanagan), Vimal
(Patel) and Chris (Cocotos)
have to step up a little bit. We
can't just rely on 0.8. and the
bottom of the lineup. The guys
have to realize that Alex
(O'Brien) won't always win and
if he doesn't, the others have to
pick up the slack."
Despite the weekend's dis
appointments, Coach Gould is
still very optimistic.
"To be 18-3 right now is
pretty remarkable and we're
not going to stop here."
With this little det<?ur
behind them, the men should
be back on track, running over
opponents at every turn. The
team's next stop will be Ojai,
Calif., where they will compete
in the Pacific 10 Individual
Championships this weekend.
