# Spikers pound a path to Final Four
## 
### Laurie Wackier Staff writer 
March Madness may be a thing
of the past, but the Final Four is
fresh on the minds of the Stan
ford men's volleyball team. By
defeating No. 6 Cal State-
Northridge in the championship
match of the Western Intercolle
giate Volleyball Association tour
nament Saturday, the spikers
locked up a berth to the NCAA
Final Four, to be held at Muncie,
Ind. this weekend.
After a marathon first game,
Stanford cruised past the fatigued
Matadors, sweeping them in
three games, 17-15, 15-7, 15-10.
The thumping marked the
third shut-out of the tournament
for the Cardinal, who improved to
23-3. In the tourney opener
against Hawaii, Stanford downed
the Rainbows in straight games.
Then the spikers followed with a
clean sweep of No. 4 UCLA when
the teams met Friday in semifinal
action (15-10, 15-9, 15-11).
CS-Northridge also earned a
shot at the WIVA championship
Friday, upsetting No. 1 Long
Beach State for the second time
this season. After ceding the first
two games to Long Beach, a
determined Northridge squad
made a successful bid for a come
back.
"Northridge played great
against Long Beach State, and
they came out against us right
where they left off," head coach
Ruben Nieves said.
But Stanford refused to play
into the hands of the would-be
Cinderella team, trading blows
with Northridge in a tedious first
game that lasted 55 minutes.

"It was painfully slow and hard
to get points, and it was frustrat
ing," commented Nieves of game
one. "We were siding out well, but
Northridge never gave up. They
just kept plugging away."
But consistent passing and hit
ting characterized the Cardinal
strategy as they chipped away at
the Matador defense and finally
prevailed.
"That first game drained
them," Nieves said. "It took a lot
more out of Northridge than it
did out of us."
Unable to sustain the intense
level of play, a deflated
Northridge squad faltered under
Stanford's formidable offensive
pressure. Raining shots from
every angle, the Cardinal hitters
combined for a .495 hitting per
centage.
The Cardinal was running full
throttle, as every individual
turned in stellar performances.
With 31 kills, Dave Goss led the
attack, and was later named to
the All-WIVA first team. Mean
while, Duncan Blackman, a sec
ond team selection, tallied 18
kills. Blackman was joined on the
second All-WIVA roster by setter
Canyon Ceman.

State-Northrldge the next night to advance to the NCAA Volleyball
Final Four next weekend.
John Hribar and John Bezmali
novic menaced Northridge block
ers with near flawless perfor
mances. With striking accuracy
above .500, the quick hitters com
bined for only one error. Another
Cardinal force, Ryan Moos
recorded 12 kills on a .400 hitting
performance.
"Things really clicked this
weekend. I think we played as
well as we have all year long,"
Blackman remarked. "Everybody

contributed, and the result was a
great team performance."
Regarding Friday's perfor
mance in the WTVA semifinals,
Nieves echoed the same senti
ment.
"We just did an excellent job of
executing our game plan, and it
really took UCLA out of their
match," said Nieves.
Early on though, it looked like
the Bruins might have the ability
to take Stanford out of their
match. Jumping, to, ,a 3bo advan
tage in the first game, UCLA test
ed the chemistry the Cardinal has
professed all season.

Stanford answered, coming
back to tie the score at 10, then
pulling away for a 15-10 first
game victory. A similar scenario
played out in game two, with
UCLA nabbing an early lead. But
Stanford regrouped after a time
out and took control. With a two
game lead and the momentum
tipped in their favor, the spikers
were on the verge of victoiy.
But a flat start in game three
slowed the squad, then, the Cardi
nal was dealt a blow when middle
blocker Joe Burghardt left the
match with back spasms.
"Joe already had 12 digs, and

he was having an awesome
match," Nieves recalled.
Burghardt was not able to return
for the Cardinal, nor could he play
in the WIVA final against the
Matadors. His status for next
weekend is questionable.
But as Nieves has stressed

'We just did an excellent job of executing
our game plan, and it really took UCLA
out of their match.'
— coach Nieves

throughout the year, depth is a
prime Cardinal strength.
"We're not choosing from weak
options," he said.
Off the bench, Hribar personi
fied that attitude. With five
quick kills, Hribar asserted his
authority.

"Hribar came in and really
pounded the ball. He was a hero of
sorts in that match," Nieves said.
According to Nieves, Moos and
Blackman, swing hitters for the
spikers, carried the squad. With a
combined hitting percentage of
.475, the duo combined for 36
put-aways. Goss contributed 22
kills
Stanford resumes play Friday
at 7:30 p.m., when they face No. 7
Indiana-Fort Wayne at Ball State
University. Pepperdine, the first
seed of the tournament, will open
the Final Four against Penn
State.
