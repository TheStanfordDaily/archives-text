# Spikers pound a path to Final Four
## 
### Laurie Wackier Staff writer 
March Madness may be a thing
of the past, but the Final Four is
fresh on the minds of the Stan
ford men's volleyball team. By
defeating No. 6 Cal State-
Northridge in the championship
match of the Western Intercolle
giate Volleyball Association tour
nament Saturday, the spikers
locked up a berth to the NCAA
Final Four, to be held at Muncie,
Ind. this weekend.
After a marathon first game,
Stanford cruised past the fatigued
Matadors, sweeping them in
three games, 17-15, 15-7, 15-10.
The thumping marked the
third shut-out of the tournament
for the Cardinal, who improved to
23-3. In the tourney opener
against Hawaii, Stanford downed
the Rainbows in straight games.
Then the spikers followed with a
clean sweep of No. 4 UCLA when
the teams met Friday in semifinal
action (15-10, 15-9, 15-11).
CS-Northridge also earned a
shot at the WIVA championship
Friday, upsetting No. 1 Long
Beach State for the second time
this season. After ceding the first
two games to Long Beach, a
determined Northridge squad
made a successful bid for a come
back.
"Northridge played great
against Long Beach State, and
they came out against us right
where they left off," head coach
Ruben Nieves said.
But Stanford refused to play
into the hands of the would-be
Cinderella team, trading blows
with Northridge in a tedious first
game that lasted 55 minutes.

"It was painfully slow and hard
to get points, and it was frustrat
ing," commented Nieves of game
one. "We were siding out well, but
Northridge never gave up. They
just kept plugging away."
But consistent passing and hit
ting characterized the Cardinal
strategy as they chipped away at
the Matador defense and finally
prevailed.
"That first game drained
them," Nieves said. "It took a lot
more out of Northridge than it
did out of us."
Unable to sustain the intense
level of play, a deflated
Northridge squad faltered under
Stanford's formidable offensive
pressure. Raining shots from
every angle, the Cardinal hitters
combined for a .495 hitting per
centage.
The Cardinal was running full
throttle, as every individual
turned in stellar performances.
With 31 kills, Dave Goss led the
attack, and was later named to
the All-WIVA first team. Mean
while, Duncan Blackman, a sec
ond team selection, tallied 18
kills. Blackman was joined on the
second All-WIVA roster by setter
Canyon Ceman.
