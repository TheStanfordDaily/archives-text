# Batters get important wins against USC
## Stanford takes two of three from Trojans to stay in Six-Pac race 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Stanford head baseball coach Mark Mar
quess described the USC Trojan baseball
team as a mirror image of his own — a
squad dominated by good pitching and a
somewhat lesser amount of hitting.
Southern Cal ran away with the Pacific
Ten Southern Division conference title last
year, but like the Cardinal lost a significant
amount of offense to graduation and the
professional draft.
Stanford was going to have to find a way
to beat that mirror image if it was to get
back into the conference title race. And it
did.
The Stanford baseball team catapulted
itself back into serious contention for the
Six-Pac title by taking two out of three
games in last weekend's series with South
ern California.
Like its mirror image, USC had great
pitching, but Stanford's was just a little bet
ter. And like its mirror image, Stanford
didn't have a lot of hitting, but it mustered
a little more offense than that of the Tro
jans, outhitting USC 27-25.
After timely hitting and great pitching in
the 7-4 win on Thursday, Stanford came

back with more of the same to pull out a late
inning 5-4 win on Friday. The Cardinal
dropped the final game 5-2 due to inconsis
tent defense and "hitting, but for the week
end's performance, Coach Marquess seemed
pleased.
"Any time you take two out of three, it's
a good weekend," said Marquess. "But these
were big wins."
Friday's game matched junior phenom
Rick Helling against USC's Mike Donnelly.
After building a four-run lead, the Trojans
staged a comeback and eventually knotted
the score at four apiece going into the
ninth.
But in the top of that inning, Jeffrey
Hammonds belted a home run, his fifth
overall and fourth in five games. The one
run lead was enough for Aaron Dorlarque,
who came in to pitch the ninth to record his
eighth save.
Saturday's game featured a matchup of
Stanford junior Jaime Sepeda and Trojan
Dan Hubbs. Sepeda pitched a good game,
allowing three earned runs in six and a third
innings, but had inconsistent defense
behind him, evidenced by the three Cardinal
errors in the game.
In addition, Stanford bats were frustrat
ed all day long. Although ten hits were accu

mulated, they came at inopportune times,
and the Cardinal batters just couldn't drive
the runs in. In all, Stanford left nine men on
base, and hit into three inning-ending dou
ble plays.
However, the long ball again presented
itself in the person of Mark Skeels. The
senior catcher belted two solo homers on
the day, accounting for all of Stanford's
runs and RBl's. The clean-up hitter, who
for most of the season has had a higher on
base percentage than slugging percentage,
has been showing marked improvement in
his ability to drive in runs in the past sever
al games.
"Mark has really been hitting the ball
well for us lately," said Marquess.
After all the Six-Pac action over the
weekend, the conference standings shape up
like this: Even after dropping two of three
to UCLA, the Wildcats of Arizona remain
atop the Six-Pac with an 11-8 record. Next,
in second, Stanford and Arizona State are
knotted up at 11-10.
In third is California with a 9-10 record,
while the Bruins and the Trojans both
reside in fourth at 9-11. The entire confer
ence is seperated by three games, and by all
accounts, the race for the Six-Pac title will
go down to the wire.
