# Card sends 'Cats, Sun Devils packing
## Women netters clinch Pac-10 South title with weekend sweep 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior Staff Writer 
With a 6-3 victory over No. 9 Arizona
Saturday the Stanford women's tennis
squad clinched the Pacific 10 Confer
ence South team title.
The clash at No.l singles between
third-ranked Heather Willens and sev
enth-ranked Danielle Scott typified the
competitive contest.
The Cardinal sophomore and Wildcat
senior fought to a 6-6 tie in the first set.
Willens built a 5-2 tiebreaker lead on the
strength of a forehand return winner
and several passing shots. Scott benefit
ted from a Willens double fault and
eventually took a 7-6 lead- Then Willens
served — and double-faulted again.
First set, Wildcats.
"Heather tends to go too fast some
times," coach Frank Brennan said. "[On
the serve] she tosses the ball too high
and hits it off the top of the racquet."
While Willens regrouped on court
one, the bottom third of the Stanford
lineup was putting the finishing touches
on two wins. At No. 5 Amy Chiminello
thrashed Erica O'Neill 6-0, 6-2. Mario
Carruth outlasted Leslie Barbour 6-3, 6-
2 in the sixth slot.
"I felt I played well. The points were
long so it was closer than it seemed. She
was aggressive and had a good forehand
but she didn't come in at all," Carruth
said of the baseline battle.
By this time Kristine Kurth was
done, Jp>yJ. on the short end of a 6-4, 6-2
score in her No. 4 match against Jane
Yates. The players exchanged pounding
groundstrokes but Yates came up with
the better shots on crucial points.

The Cardinal had a slim 2-1 lead but,
with Willens and Kylie Johnson drop
ping their first sets, the advantage was
in jeopardy.
Laxmi Poruri, the No. 5 collegiate
player in the nation, helped the Stanford

'I was really happy
with [Laxmi's] style of
play today. She was
coming in, twice on the
same point if she had
to.'
— coach Brennan

cause by blasting the banshee-voiced
Banni Redhair 6-1, 6-3. In February,
Poruri beat the grunting/screaming
Wildcat in straight sets and didn't have
problems with her Saturday.
The Cardinal sophomore has been
working on her topspin backhand after
switching from a two-handed backhand
to a one-hander less than two years ago.
"I have confidence in it now," said
Poruri, whose goal several months ago
was to enter the postseason hitting
mostly topspin backhands. She slices
occasionally to throw sluggers off their
rhythm.
"I was really happy with her style of
play today," Brennan said of the attack
oriented Poruri. "She was coming in,
twice on the same point if she had to."

Arizona closed the gap when Alix
Creek beat Johnson for the second time
in 1992. The Cardinal senior fell in two
sets, 6-2, 7-5.
This left the struggle at No. 1 to
decide whether Stanford entered dou
bles with a 4-2 lead or tied at 3-3.
The consistent Willens built a 3-0
lead in the second set, taking advantage
of Scott's streakiness. But the Wildcat
roared back to come within two games,
5-3. Willens again struggled on her serve
and Scott broke her to bring the score 5-
4.
Willens had two groundstrokes trick
le over the tape in the next game and
benefitted from two Scott double faults.
A sizzling Willens winner brought her to
set point. Scott crunched a first serve
but netted Willens' low return. Second
set, Cardinal.
In the third set, Willens took the cru
cial fifth game with shots such as a gen
tly-placed crosscourt drop volley. Gain
ing momentum, she broke Scott at love
to go up 4-2. After splitting the next two
games, Willens served for the match. A
backhand volley winner brought her to
match point and, when Scott stretched
for a forehand volley and stabbed it
deep, Willens had won the three-hour
marathon.
"Heather makes people play well. She
wears them out mentally and then they
lose," Brennan said. "She's a good loss
for decent players. Good ones like Scott
and [Cal's Lisa] Albano get revved up to
play her. She's not a good loss for them.
It's a level of respect she's yet to
achieve."
