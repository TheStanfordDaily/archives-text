# Card sends 'Cats, Sun Devils packing
## Women netters clinch Pac-10 South title with weekend sweep 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior Staff Writer 
With a 6-3 victory over No. 9 Arizona
Saturday the Stanford women's tennis
squad clinched the Pacific 10 Confer
ence South team title.
The clash at No.l singles between
third-ranked Heather Willens and sev
enth-ranked Danielle Scott typified the
competitive contest.
The Cardinal sophomore and Wildcat
senior fought to a 6-6 tie in the first set.
Willens built a 5-2 tiebreaker lead on the
strength of a forehand return winner
and several passing shots. Scott benefit
ted from a Willens double fault and
eventually took a 7-6 lead- Then Willens
served — and double-faulted again.
First set, Wildcats.
"Heather tends to go too fast some
times," coach Frank Brennan said. "[On
the serve] she tosses the ball too high
and hits it off the top of the racquet."
While Willens regrouped on court
one, the bottom third of the Stanford
lineup was putting the finishing touches
on two wins. At No. 5 Amy Chiminello
thrashed Erica O'Neill 6-0, 6-2. Mario
Carruth outlasted Leslie Barbour 6-3, 6-
2 in the sixth slot.
"I felt I played well. The points were
long so it was closer than it seemed. She
was aggressive and had a good forehand
but she didn't come in at all," Carruth
said of the baseline battle.
By this time Kristine Kurth was
done, Jp>yJ. on the short end of a 6-4, 6-2
score in her No. 4 match against Jane
Yates. The players exchanged pounding
groundstrokes but Yates came up with
the better shots on crucial points.

The Cardinal had a slim 2-1 lead but,
with Willens and Kylie Johnson drop
ping their first sets, the advantage was
in jeopardy.
Laxmi Poruri, the No. 5 collegiate
player in the nation, helped the Stanford

'I was really happy
with [Laxmi's] style of
play today. She was
coming in, twice on the
same point if she had
to.'
— coach Brennan

cause by blasting the banshee-voiced
Banni Redhair 6-1, 6-3. In February,
Poruri beat the grunting/screaming
Wildcat in straight sets and didn't have
problems with her Saturday.
The Cardinal sophomore has been
working on her topspin backhand after
switching from a two-handed backhand
to a one-hander less than two years ago.
"I have confidence in it now," said
Poruri, whose goal several months ago
was to enter the postseason hitting
mostly topspin backhands. She slices
occasionally to throw sluggers off their
rhythm.
"I was really happy with her style of
play today," Brennan said of the attack
oriented Poruri. "She was coming in,
twice on the same point if she had to."

Arizona closed the gap when Alix
Creek beat Johnson for the second time
in 1992. The Cardinal senior fell in two
sets, 6-2, 7-5.
This left the struggle at No. 1 to
decide whether Stanford entered dou
bles with a 4-2 lead or tied at 3-3.
The consistent Willens built a 3-0
lead in the second set, taking advantage
of Scott's streakiness. But the Wildcat
roared back to come within two games,
5-3. Willens again struggled on her serve
and Scott broke her to bring the score 5-
4.
Willens had two groundstrokes trick
le over the tape in the next game and
benefitted from two Scott double faults.
A sizzling Willens winner brought her to
set point. Scott crunched a first serve
but netted Willens' low return. Second
set, Cardinal.
In the third set, Willens took the cru
cial fifth game with shots such as a gen
tly-placed crosscourt drop volley. Gain
ing momentum, she broke Scott at love
to go up 4-2. After splitting the next two
games, Willens served for the match. A
backhand volley winner brought her to
match point and, when Scott stretched
for a forehand volley and stabbed it
deep, Willens had won the three-hour
marathon.
"Heather makes people play well. She
wears them out mentally and then they
lose," Brennan said. "She's a good loss
for decent players. Good ones like Scott
and [Cal's Lisa] Albano get revved up to
play her. She's not a good loss for them.
It's a level of respect she's yet to
achieve."


1 racy Allen — Daily
Mario Carruth gets ready to swat a backhand during her 6-3, 7-6 defeat of Dawn Mar
tin of Arizona State last Friday. Carruth also won Saturday, cruising over Leslie Bar
bour of Arizona 6-3, 6-2, helping the Cardinal women sweep the weekend.
Stanford clinched the match
when Kurth and Johnson defeat
ed Creek and O'Neill in the sec
ond slot 6-2, 7-5.
"Our superior athletic ability
came through in that match,"
Brennan said. "Usually if you
have one person who lost singles,
the odds [of the doubles tandem
winning] go way down. If both
lost in singles you say 'what bad
chemistry is this."'
The Cardinal tandem was
playing only its third match
together because Johnson's regu
lar partner, Emma Woodhouse, is
nursing a hamstring pull. Kurth
has only recently begun playing
doubles again after recovering
from a back strain.
"It's hard to begin to play
together but we get along and
there's no communication prob
lem," Johnson said. "Emma and I
play a boom tennis game. We try
to go through you, not around
you. Kristine and I are the same
way. We play solid, hard doubles."
At No. 3 doubles Chiminello
and Carruth fell to Barbour and
Beth Choate 6-2, 3-6, 6-2. Scott
and Redhair had to default the
top match after they split sets
with Willens and Poruri. The
Wildcats had to catch a 5 p.m.
flight back to Tucson.
The day before, No. 7 Arizona
State was also sent home with a
loss. The Cardinal clinched the
victory with five wins in singles
and took two of the three doubles
contests.
Willens had edged Krista
Amend in their last meeting but
this time the Cardinal junior
crushed Amend 6-0, 6-1. Johnson

routed Meredith Geiger for the
second time in two months while
Chiminello squashed LuAnn
Klimchock 6-1,6-3. Poruri won in
straight sets while Carruth gut:
ted out a 7-4 tiebreaker in the sec
ond set to beat Dawn Martin.
Joelle Schad defeated Kurth 6-4,
6-0.
With the weekend sweep,
Stanford finishes the regular sea
son 20-2 (9-1 in Pac-10). By
recent Cardinal standards a two
loss campaign is a disappoint
ment. However this year, unlike
the last few years, injuries have
crippled the starting lineup.
In the fall, the probable
starters were Willens, Poruri,
Johnson, Kurth, Kim Shasby and
Woodhouse. Shasby tore liga
ments in her knee in January and
has been out the whole year.
Johnson, Kurth and Woodhouse
have all spent a large portion of
the season on injured reserve.
So Chiminello, a freshman,
and Carruth, a junior, stepped
into the bottom third of the line
up. The pair tallied 19-3 and 12-2
singles records respectively in the
regular season. In doubles, the
duo had six wins in eight match
es.
What's maybe more impres
sive is how they responded to the
loss at California. Both dropped
their singles matches and the No.
3 doubles contest.
Against the squads from Ari
zona, Chiminello and Carruth
racked up four straight-set sin
gles victories and split the dou
bles, losing to the Wildcats in a
tough three-setter.
Next week the Cardinal com
petes at the Pac-10 Individual
Championships. Then the team
has two-and-a-half weeks off
before hosting the NCAA Cham
pionships May 13-21.
