# Track and field looks good in preparation for tough meets
## Individuals stand out as Cardinal gets ready for Pac-10s and NCAAs in 'championship' portion of season 
### Nick Clements Staff writer 
Stanford head Track and Field coach
Brooks Johnson calls this the "champi
onship" stage of the season.
"We're coming around at the right
time," he said after the Cardinal hosted
the Stanford Collegiate Open this week
end, a track and field extravaganza that
featured many top Northern California
teams. The team is looking ahead
toward the Penn Relays later this week
and California on May 2.
The meet was an historic one. It was
the last home meet for the graduating
seniors, including Chryste Gaines and
Jackie Edwards, both of whom have
formed the fulcrum of the women's
team during their stay at Stanford and
singlehandedly led the women to a sec
ond-place finish at the NCAA Indoor
Championships in mid-March.
The meet was also the first competi
tive run for Olympian Butch Reynolds
in 18 months. Reynolds, who is coached
by Johnson, had been suspended from
competition by the International Ath
letic Amateur Federation for steroid
use but has held firm in his denial of
ever using any performance-enhancing
drugs. Reynolds, who holds the world
record in the 400 meters, will be
allowed to run in three more meets this
spring and is hoping to be reinstated
fully by the time the Olympic trials are
held in June.
"I grew a lot in the past two years,"
said Reynolds after easily beating out
fellow Stanford Track Club member Jim
Cramton in a time of 45.92 seconds.
"Brooks taught me to let go of what hap
pened ... I'd say right now I'm right on
schedule." Reynolds said his goals right
now are to qualify for the Olympic Tri
als, make the Olympic team, and win
the gold medal in Barcelona.
Many Cardinal athletes were run
ning in off-events in order to tone down
before the California meet. Senior Fred
Carter ran in the 1500 meters (setting a

personal best) instead of his best event,
the 3000 meter steeplechase. Carter
will be traveling with six other Stanford
athletes on Thursday to the Penn
Relays, which is one of the most presti
gious track meets in the United States
today. Carter will attempt to qualify for
the NCAA Championships in the
steeplechase.

'This is put up or shut up
time. We're not going [to
the Relays] just to enjoy
the carnival.'
— coach Chisam

"Fred is a battler," said Johnson.
"He's not going to beat himself."
Seniors Gary Stolz and Dave Scud
amore, who run the 5000 and 10,000
meters, respectively, also ran in the
1500 meters on Saturday and will be in
Pennsylvania with Carter.
"The three of them are in as in good
shape as any runners I've had in the
past six years," said Scott Chisam,
Stanford distance coach.
Chisam said that the Penn Relays
are a golden opportunity for Carter,
Stolz and Scudamore to hit NCAA qual
ifying marks as they will most likely be
running in fast packs.
"This is put up or shut up time,"
Chisam said. "We're not going [to the
Relays] just to enjoy the carnival."
The other Cardinal NCAA qualifying
hopeful at the Penn Relays will be the
400-meter relay team, which consists of
Ali Callicoatte, Rhonda Oliver, Gaines
and Edwards. The relay team has
already qualified provisionally but is
looking for an automatic berth in the
NCAA championships.
In the field events, two Cardinal ath
letes had career days in winning their
respective events. Sophomore Matt

Karsevar threw a personal best 173
feet, four inches in the discus as he eas
ily outdistanced the rest of the field.
Sophomore Debbie Templeton took
first in the javelin and second in the dis
cus in setting personal best throws in
both events.
"We have a very young women's
team," said throwing coach Jed Gold
fried. "It's been very difficult this year
since they're so young .. . but the best
thing about freshmen is that they
become sophomores. That's a truism in
sports."
Gaines, who is favored to win the
100 meter dash in the NCAA Champi
onships and will run in that event at the
Penn Relays, ran the 200 meter dash
and won in a time of 23.57 seconds.
"She was going for the Stadium
record but she got caught running into
a headwind," said Johnson.
Edwards won the 100 meter dash
and will be competing in the long and
triple jump at Penn.
In other individual competition,
freshman Travis Clark easily won the
high jump with a leap of 6 feet, 11 3/4
inches. In the triple jump, sophomore
Dana Weeks and freshman Anne Lee
took first and second for the second
consecutive week. All three have quali
fied for the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships.
As California approaches, both John
son and Chisam realize that the Cardi
nal simply do not have the depth of the
Golden Bears.
"The war does not look very good
right now," said Chisam. "We have too
many holes."
Johnson said that "their overall
depth and breadth is better than ours."
California's men's team has a decided
advantage over the Cardinal men.
Last year the meet came down to the
mile relay for the women, which is the
last event. Stanford narrowly lost.
"I'd say that it's most likely going to
come down to the mile relay again for
the women," Chisam said.

Chisam said. "We're not going [to the
Relays] just to enjoy the carnival."
The other Cardinal NCAA qualifying
hopeful at the Penn Relays will be the
400-meter relay team, which consists of
Ali Callicoatte, Rhonda Oliver, Gaines
and Edwards. The relay team has
already qualified provisionally but is
looking for an automatic berth in the
NCAA championships.
In the field events, two Cardinal ath
letes had career days in winning their
respective events. Sophomore Matt

Karsevar threw a personal best 173
feet, four inches in the discus as he eas
ily outdistanced the rest of the field.
Sophomore Debbie Templeton took
first in the javelin and second in the dis
cus in setting personal best throws in
both events.
"We have a very young women's
team," said throwing coach Jed Gold
fried. "It's been very difficult this year
since they're so young .. . but the best
thing about freshmen is that they
become sophomores. That's a truism in
sports."
Gaines, who is favored to win the
100 meter dash in the NCAA Champi
onships and will run in that event at the
Penn Relays, ran the 200 meter dash
and won in a time of 23.57 seconds.
"She was going for the Stadium
record but she got caught running into
a headwind," said Johnson.
Edwards won the 100 meter dash
and will be competing in the long and
triple jump at Penn.
In other individual competition,
freshman Travis Clark easily won the
high jump with a leap of 6 feet, 11 3/4
inches. In the triple jump, sophomore
Dana Weeks and freshman Anne Lee
took first and second for the second
consecutive week. All three have quali
fied for the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships.
As California approaches, both John
son and Chisam realize that the Cardi
nal simply do not have the depth of the
Golden Bears.
"The war does not look very good
right now," said Chisam. "We have too
many holes."
Johnson said that "their overall
depth and breadth is better than ours."
California's men's team has a decided
advantage over the Cardinal men.
Last year the meet came down to the
mile relay for the women, which is the
last event. Stanford narrowly lost.
"I'd say that it's most likely going to
come down to the mile relay again for
the women," Chisam said.

field meet. Templeton took first and set a personal record of 130 feet, seven inches in
the event.
Stanford head Track and Field coach
Brooks Johnson calls this the "champi
onship" stage of the season.
"We're coming around at the right
time," he said after the Cardinal hosted
the Stanford Collegiate Open this week
end, a track and field extravaganza that
featured many top Northern California
teams. The team is looking ahead
toward the Penn Relays later this week
and California on May 2.
The meet was an historic one. It was
the last home meet for the graduating
seniors, including Chryste Gaines and
Jackie Edwards, both of whom have
formed the fulcrum of the women's
team during their stay at Stanford and
singlehandedly led the women to a sec
ond-place finish at the NCAA Indoor
Championships in mid-March.
The meet was also the first competi
tive run for Olympian Butch Reynolds
in 18 months. Reynolds, who is coached
by Johnson, had been suspended from
competition by the International Ath
letic Amateur Federation for steroid
use but has held firm in his denial of
ever using any performance-enhancing
drugs. Reynolds, who holds the world
record in the 400 meters, will be
allowed to run in three more meets this
spring and is hoping to be reinstated
fully by the time the Olympic trials are
held in June.
"I grew a lot in the past two years,"
said Reynolds after easily beating out
fellow Stanford Track Club member Jim
Cramton in a time of 45.92 seconds.
"Brooks taught me to let go of what hap
pened ... I'd say right now I'm right on
schedule." Reynolds said his goals right
now are to qualify for the Olympic Tri
als, make the Olympic team, and win
the gold medal in Barcelona.
Many Cardinal athletes were run
ning in off-events in order to tone down
before the California meet. Senior Fred
Carter ran in the 1500 meters (setting a

personal best) instead of his best event,
the 3000 meter steeplechase. Carter
will be traveling with six other Stanford
athletes on Thursday to the Penn
Relays, which is one of the most presti
gious track meets in the United States
today. Carter will attempt to qualify for
the NCAA Championships in the
steeplechase.

'This is put up or shut up
time. We're not going [to
the Relays] just to enjoy
the carnival.'
— coach Chisam

"Fred is a battler," said Johnson.
"He's not going to beat himself."
Seniors Gary Stolz and Dave Scud
amore, who run the 5000 and 10,000
meters, respectively, also ran in the
1500 meters on Saturday and will be in
Pennsylvania with Carter.
"The three of them are in as in good
shape as any runners I've had in the
past six years," said Scott Chisam,
Stanford distance coach.
Chisam said that the Penn Relays
are a golden opportunity for Carter,
Stolz and Scudamore to hit NCAA qual
ifying marks as they will most likely be
running in fast packs.
