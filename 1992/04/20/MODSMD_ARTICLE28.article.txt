## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
Both the men's and women's crew teams con
tinued their winning ways this weekend with victo
ries over UC-Davis at Redwood Shores in Redwood
City. On the men's side, the win keeps the Cardinal
within five to ten seconds of both Washington and
UCLA on top of the Pacific Coast League stand
ings. For the women, Washington continues to top
the league, followed by Stanford and California in
close contention for the second place spot.
Men's czoach Wieslaw Kujda sees the victory as
an indication of all-around team improvement.
"Our varsity won by 17 seconds, and our JV won
by 25 seconds, so I'm pretty pleased," said Kujda.
"The frosh lost to Orange Coast (College) by two
seconds, but considering they lost to that boat by
16 seconds just three weeks ago, so I see it as a big
step up for them."
Sophomore Will Porteous emphasizes team
unity as the key factor to the team's success: "We
had a great start and just really kept our heads in
the race, and that's the kind of mental toughness
we need."
The men's team travels to Washington, D.C.
next week, followed by the Big Row versus Califor
nia the following week.
"We're basically chasing the Huskies right now,
but you always want to beat Cal," said Kujda.
For the women, UC-Davis proved to be a good
tune-up going into next week's Potomac Regatta.
Both varsity boats were victorious against the
Aggies, with the varsity-8 boat finishing 11 seconds
ahead, and the varsity-4 coming from behind to
take the race by 17 seconds.
"I'm real proud of our four-boat," said women's
crew head coach Wendy Davis. "We had to deal
with swirling winds, but luckily the water stayed
relatively calm."
Over the past three races the women have run
at Redwood Shores, they have clocked times of six
minutes, 57 seconds to six minutes, 59 seconds,
even though water and wind conditions have varied
significantly over that time.
Team member Jen Kreshak is similarly happy
with her team's performance.
"We started three seats down, but once we set
tled down, we tried to focus in on our rhythm, and
that seemed to work well," she said.
Looking ahead to next week's regatta in Wash
ington D.C., Davis feels her team is up to the chal
lenge.
"Right now, we're as ready as we'll ever be. The
Eastern schools will be tough, and we're ready to
give it our best shot," she said.
