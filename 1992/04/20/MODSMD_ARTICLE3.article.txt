# A 						system that didn't quite work: Votes in COP race miscounted
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
ASSU election officials miscounted votes in
last week's Council of Presidents election due to
an apparent computer-programming error that
altered vote totals but did not change the out
come, according to Election Commissioner
Enda Hu.
After using two different programs, Hu
determined that the official results show "I Pre
fer not to Have a COP" still winning the elec
tion, but had "Independents: a New Era"
squeezing out "Students First" for the runner
up position.
Hu said that Thursday's results were skewed
when his staff of student assistants altered the
computer program that determines the winners
from students' rankings of the slates.
The program was rewritten to provide faster
results, Hu said. To expedite the processing of
ballots, programmers apparently rewrote the
program to ignore the hundreds of write-in
votes that students submit each year
If done correctly, such a
change shouldn't have affected
the election results, since write-in
slates are quickly eliminated in
early rounds.
But programmers may have
accidentally rewritten the pro
gram to disregard altogether
those ballots that included any
write-in vote at all, Hu suggested
yesterday.
If "Independents" voters tend
ed to use the write-in option more
often than "Students First" vot
ers, such a glitch could have
caused the miscount that occurred
in Thursday's unofficial tally.
Election officials used for the
first time this year a complicated
system of "preference voting," in
which students were asked to
rank — from 1 to 6 — the four
slates on the ballot and any two
write-in slates.
According to "Robert's Rules
of Order," which election officials
followed in writing the computer
program, this process determines
a winner in a series of rounds,
which are punctuated by the elim
ination of the slate receiving the
smallest number of votes in the
previous round.
After the first round, officials
consider voters' secondary prefer
ences to determine a winner.
Hu said there were 900 "null
votes," which were ballots sub
mitted by students who did not
mark any COP preferences.
Those null votes, he says, were
somehow included in the major
slates' totals in Thursday's count.
He could not explain how that
happened, or whether one slate
was advantaged by that process,
but said it is "troubling" that votes
which apparently were cast for no
one were instead counted for one
or more of the major slates.

Hu said another possibility
would be that the 900 votes —
considered null by Hu's most
recent programs — were actually
cast for one of the major slates
but were misinterpreted by the
current program.
But Hu said that is "unlikely"
and argued that an 18 percent
non-participation rate in the COP
division of the election is "com
pletely reasonable."
There were also 131 "votes
rendered useless," which Hu's
computer program defines as bal
lots that contain only slates that
were eliminated in early elimina
tion rounds.

Hu said it is "trou
bling" that votes cast
for no one were
instead counted for
one or more of the
major slates.

Since many of those 131 bal
lots contained write-in votes, they
may have been left out of Thurs
day's first-round analysis, then
counted later for one or more of
the major slates along with the
ballots Hu now considers "null."
Hu said totals released Thurs
day were not complete. He and his
assistants obtained the current
total after processing the votes
for several hours this weekend.
He will submit the officials
totals to the ASSU Senate tomor
row night.
In a development unrelated to
the vote-counting error, Hu said
junior Jason Payne, rather than
freshman Gabriel Lucas, will
assume a voting seat in the senate.
Payne passed Lucas when the
126 absentee and paper ballots
were counted over the weekend,
Hu said.
