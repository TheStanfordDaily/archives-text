# A
						system that didn't quite work: Votes in COP race miscounted

### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
ASSU election officials miscounted votes in
last week's Council of Presidents election due to
an apparent computer-programming error that
altered vote totals but did not change the out
come, according to Election Commissioner
Enda Hu.
After using two different programs, Hu
determined that the official results show "I Pre
fer not to Have a COP" still winning the elec
tion, but had "Independents: a New Era"
squeezing out "Students First" for the runner
up position.
Hu said that Thursday's results were skewed
when his staff of student assistants altered the
computer program that determines the winners
from students' rankings of the slates.
The program was rewritten to provide faster
results, Hu said. To expedite the processing of
ballots, programmers apparently rewrote the
program to ignore the hundreds of write-in
votes that students submit each year
