# Results of fee-request vote for student groups produce a broad range of reactions

### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
Depending on which way
the votes fell in last week's
election, student groups on the
fee request ballot expressed the
full range of agony and ecstasy
yesterday.
The rejection of Tuesday
Films' $17,259 fee was tanta
mount to the service's demise,
said financial manager Dylan
Pollard. The group brings
"non-mainstream" films to
Stanford.
"We just don't have the
money to pay the outrageous
fees that the filmers are asking
to show them. We are basically
an avant garde film service,
and those films are very hard
to come by," he said.
Pollard added that he was
very surprised by the results.
"We've received the fee every
other year, and they've been
around for about 10 years
now," he said. "I just can't
imagine Stanford students
wanting to get rid of a film ser
vice."
On the other hand, Matthew
Kulikowski, the new station
manager for X-TV, said the
rejection of his organization's
$7,894 special fee request was
not unexpected.
X-TV also did not receive
their fee last year.
"I'm very disappointed, but
not very surprised," he said.
"One detrimental aspect of X
TV is this preconceived notion
that we don't do anything. If
anything, I am going to make
sure that that reputation is
diminished next year."
X-TV plans on moving their
station from the Fire Truck
House to a larger facility next
year, and Kulikowski said he
hopes the change will make a
difference in the quality of pro
gramming.
"Right now, with such a
small space, there is a whole lot
of wear and tear on the equip
ment. Hopefully with the new

station, a lot of that will be
relieved," he said.
He said X-TV would contin
ue to put on productions, but
that lack of funds poses a prob
lem.
"It will be hard to do the
same things that we have done.
But we're not going to die
down, and we'll be around for a
long time," he said.
At the other end of the spe
cial fee spectrum, the Stanford
Project on Nutrition is sitting
pretty after receiving the high
est vote for their $6,689 fee last
week.
Senior Josh Castleman, the
group's financial director, said
he went into the election confi
dent.
"I guess the real thing that
pleased me was the fact that we
got the highest approval rate.
I'm happy with the fee, but
other than that, it really wasn't
that thrilling," he said.
Castleman added that the
money allow SPOON to acti
vate their outreach program.
"With this program, we will
be able to get other schools
involved in the subject of nutri
tion and health," he said.
SURE Escort Service coor
dinators said they were not so
confident that their group
would receive its $52,915 fee.
The request passed with about
67 percent voting in its favor.
Junior Christopher Wand,
SURE's treasurer, said he was
"shocked" by the fee's
approval. "I still can't believe
that we actually got the fee,"
he said.
Wand said the money will be
used for maintenance, publici
ty, gas and other repairs that
are "drastically needed" for the
service.
"We spend at least 30 per
cent of our money on repairs,
gas, etc. and we have three
escorts working full time. If
you think about it we are really
not getting that much money
for the service that we do," he
said.
