# Shultz again answering questions on Iran-Contra scandal
## 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
Hoover Institution Distinguished Fel
low George Shultz has been questioned
again in recent months about his knowl
edge of the Iran-Contra arms scandal.
Shultz, a former Secretary of State, said
the investigators questioned him again
because "there were things they had found
that I have not seen before."
The office of the independent counsel
investigating the scandal wanted to find
out if Shultz and former Secretary of

Defense Casper Weinberger lied in their
testimony to Congress in 1987, according
to the Associated Press.
Investigators have met with several
former Reagan administration members
over the past few months, but have not
disclosed any new material, according to
AP.
Shultz said "the basic thrust of (his)
testimony has not changed" as a result of
the new .material the prosecutors had
brought up, but did not specify what the
new material consisted of.
"I opposed the operation continuously,"

Shultz said. "My knowl
edge of it was fragmen
tary and sporadic [and]
when the revelations
came, I had a lonely
fight to have the thing
finally stopped."
Shultz said that on
"a couple of occasions"
he had been informed
that some activity was

underway that was not
entirely legal, but when "hostages (are) pre
sumably going to get released, you are

immobilized because you don't want to
jeopardize someone's life."
On those occasions, the particular
activities he was notified about never
transpired, Shultz said.
Shultz said he had supplied the inves
tigators with all relevant notes taken by
his then-executive assistant Charles Hill.
Hill, who is now a Senior Research
Fellow at Hoover, said, "We volunteered
the notes to investigators when the story
broke," but the investigators did not
request all the material at once.
"Some of the notes were provided in

1986, and some later as they were
requested.... (They) eventually request
ed all of the material," in the spring of
1990, Hill said.
Shultz described himself as "very
cooperative" and said, "I have [met] end
lessly with congressional committees"
and the staff of the office of the indepen
dent counsel probing the arms scandal.
Shultz told the AP that he was a sub
ject, not a target, of the investigators'
probe. A target indicates someone who
can be directly linked to a crime with sub
stantial evidence.
