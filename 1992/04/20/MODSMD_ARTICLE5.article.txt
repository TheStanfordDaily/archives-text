# Police cut off crowded party
## One arrest at 'Exotic Erotic' 
### Angie Chuang Editorial staff 
Stanford Police shut down Saturday night's
Exotic Erotic party at the Alpha Sigma house, say
ing hired security guards could no longer control
the overcrowding or curtail underage drinking.
The San Mateo Security Services officers hired
by Alpha Sig called the police at 11:30 p.m. due to
an "excess of people, problems with crowd control
and serving alcohol to minors," Stanford Police
Sergeant Nick Brunot said.
When the police arrived, they gave the party
organizers and security "a period of time" to con
trol the party, Brunot said.
But after an hour and 20 minutes, "they
couldn't control the party — it was overcrowded,
there were 500 people outside, people were still
getting in — so we asked [the partygoers] to leave,
and they left," Brunot said.
One student was arrested on charges of assault
ing a police officer at the party. Brunot said he
could not release any information
about the student until the arrest
is on public record with the Dis
trict Attorney.
According to Alpha Sig Resi
dent Assistant Matt Werdeger, he
and the residents of the house
have decided not to comment
until they discuss the matter with
the University.
"We don't know if we're in
trouble or not," he said.
Freshman Bonnie Randall said
while she was at the party a secu

rity guard "stopped the band and
said into the microphone some
thing like, 'Until whoever run
ning the party complies by the
rules, this party is shut down.' "
The crowd "just stood there,"
and very few people left after this
initial announcement, she said.
"We were really surprised. We
were having fun and they told us
to leave and didn't give any specif
ic reason."
She said she saw another uni
formed man "tearing toward the
alcohol area with a flashlight,"
right before the announcement
was made.
Freshman Camille Dungy said
she was among the first of the

partygoers denied entrance at the
door.
"All of a sudden, the [security
guard! said, 'Go home, go home,
the party's shut down.' They
yelled, 'Move back!' " she said.
"There were 200 people packed
behind us — yeah, right, we could
move back."
Dungy said she felt the security
guards mismanaged the situation
and were rude to the partygoers.
"When no one at the door moved,
they took this crowd of women who
were all in bras or almost nothing
and pushed them all on the chests,"
she said. "Because they were all
wearing heels, they all tripped back
on the stairs."

A representative at San Mateo
Security Services said the officers
on duty Saturday night could not
be reached for comment.
Dungy said people refused to
move because they were angered
by the security guards' attitude
and the lack of explanation for
people being denied entrance.
"The rent-a-cops just said,
'leave,' and no one really moved
until the real cops came," she said.
"We would have left if they had
just told us it was too crowded."
She said many people were
sneaking in through side doors
and windows when they were not
allowed to enter through the front
door.
