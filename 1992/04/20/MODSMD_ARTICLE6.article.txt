# Student arrested on assault charge

### Grace Lee Staff writer 
Cedro resident Peter Habicht was arrested
Thursday evening for allegedly assaulting a former
roommate at a Palo Alto residence earlier this year.
According to the police report, Habicht
"dragged his former roommate around the room,
injuring her finger and back," said Sergeant Tom
Distephano of the Palo Alto Police Department,
adding that he was unsure of how severe the
injuries had been.
Habicht, who Cedro residents say is a fifth-year
senior, was charged with battery.
â€¢ Distephano said the victim was female,
but would not release her identi
ty. He said he did not know if she
is also a Stanford student.
Cedro Resident Assistant
Christine Giviskos said the woman
was Habicht's girlfriend at the
time, but Distephano said she was
identified only as his roommate.
According to Distephano, the
woman reported the January 2 inci
dent to the District Attorney's

office. The office then filed a com
plaint in the form of an arrest war
rant.
Distephano said an arrest war
rant can take from one day to
three months to be issued, and
that even when the warrant is in
the hands of the police it is not
always easy to make an arrest.
"If you didn't know where the
person was, it would be really dif
ficult to make an arrest," he said.
Distephano said this is proba
bly what happened with this
warrant. "Somehow [the police]
figured out where this fellow

was on the Stanford campus and
went there and arrested him,"
he said.
Habicht was taken to North
County Jail in Palo Alto after his
arrest. He was released at 11:30
that night on $5,000 bond,
according to an officer at the jail.
Habicht will face an arraign
ment and may be tried in court on
charges of battery at a later date,
Distephano said.
Students who witnessed the
arrest said Habicht was "com
pletely cooperative" with the Palo
Alto police officers.
