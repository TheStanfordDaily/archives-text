# Murals reflect culture, conflict

### Roberta Chavez 
Students entering Casa Zapa
ta's dining hall are greeted by
three larger-than-life female
images, examples of a long-stand
ing artistic avenue of expression
at Stanford — the mural.
Campus murals vary in loca
tion as much as they do in sub
ject matter — from the Egyp
tian figures in Kairos to Gary
Larson's sheep painted in Zapa
ta's basement — and have
sparked controversy as well as
promoted culture.
A mural is more than a paint
ing going from one edge of the
wall to another, according to
Zapata resident fellow Tony
Burciaga. Burciaga, a Chicano
muralist, said it also "takes into
account the architectural and
social atmosphere."
Like the Memorial Church
altarpiece's replication of
Rosselli's "Last Supper," one
mural in Zapata echoes the Bib
lical scene. However, the people
at the table are Chicano heroes.
"The 'Last Supper of Chicano
Heroes' mural is inspirational,"
said Resident Assistant Moira
Hernandez. "Cesar Chavez,
Zapata and San tana are figures
that Mexican American stu
dents recognize as their role
models, heroes and leaders."
From their birth in the early
'70s to the present, murals have
reflected a strong sense of com

munity for many Chicanos at
Stanford. The themes of the
paintings range from Chicano
heroes to the Mexican Revolu
tion to the mythology of maize.
Controversy and community
Some of the murals in Zapata
have caused controversy. "The
Spirit of Hoover" shows Latin
Americans, South Africans and
students pulling down Hoover
Tower as a skeleton topples it.
The mural, which was painted
in 1985, is a political statement
against injustices in Third
World countries.
