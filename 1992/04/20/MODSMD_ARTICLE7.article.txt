# Murals reflect culture, conflict

Students entering Casa Zapa
ta's dining hall are greeted by
three larger-than-life female
images, examples of a long-stand
ing artistic avenue of expression
at Stanford — the mural.
Campus murals vary in loca
tion as much as they do in sub
ject matter — from the Egyp
tian figures in Kairos to Gary
Larson's sheep painted in Zapa
ta's basement — and have
sparked controversy as well as
promoted culture.
A mural is more than a paint
ing going from one edge of the
wall to another, according to
Zapata resident fellow Tony
Burciaga. Burciaga, a Chicano
muralist, said it also "takes into
account the architectural and
social atmosphere."
Like the Memorial Church
altarpiece's replication of
Rosselli's "Last Supper," one
mural in Zapata echoes the Bib
lical scene. However, the people
at the table are Chicano heroes.
"The 'Last Supper of Chicano
Heroes' mural is inspirational,"
said Resident Assistant Moira
Hernandez. "Cesar Chavez,
Zapata and San tana are figures
that Mexican American stu
dents recognize as their role
models, heroes and leaders."
From their birth in the early
'70s to the present, murals have
reflected a strong sense of com

munity for many Chicanos at
Stanford. The themes of the
paintings range from Chicano
heroes to the Mexican Revolu
tion to the mythology of maize.
Controversy and community
Some of the murals in Zapata
have caused controversy. "The
Spirit of Hoover" shows Latin
Americans, South Africans and
students pulling down Hoover
Tower as a skeleton topples it.
The mural, which was painted
in 1985, is a political statement
against injustices in Third
World countries.

mural is "Reaction to the Violence
of Media Racism." It portrays
three women: a young Mestiza, a
faceless blonde woman and an
elderly Mestiza.
Some people interpret the face
lessness of the blonde as a racist
statement against Caucasian
women. Last quarter, an anony
mous student pasted a face on the
mural and wrote in an anony
mous note, "I feel like I represent
more than my own personal feel
ings about this mural. We are not
all white, faceless oppressors."
However, Burciaga gave a dif
ferent interpretation of the
woman's facelessness. The blonde
represents the image of people in
Mexican television — the majority
of whom are whites, he said.
"The faceless woman is a myth
in Mexico," Burciaga said. "The
young woman on the right and
the old woman on the left perhaps
represent the reality of Mexico."
But junior Eric Buxton, a
Serra resident, said, "When I

think of a theme house, I think of
a group that would be open to
other opinions and actively pursu
ing openness and discussion
about ethnic issues."
"It's total irony that they have
a mural that discriminates
against Caucasians," he added.
According to Keith Guy, direc
tor of housing and food services,
"murals contribute to the overall
theme. We preserve them because
they are clearly art, although they
might not be comfortable for
everyone to see."
Student expression and
inspiration
Some of the other houses with
murals are Lambda Nu, Colum
bae, Kairos, the Enchanted Broc
coli Forest and the Beta Theta Pi
house.
Most of EBF's murals are
musically oriented — the cover of
Pink Floyd's "The Dark Side of
the Moon" stands on the wall,
while "The Tongue," the Rolling
Stones' trademark symbol, is
painted on another.
The four-wall mural in the Beta
house is a mix of expressions and
subjects. The "Drop Acid, Not the

Bomb" slogan, a Chekhov quote, a
portrait of Bob Mar ley, an elaborate
tree and the lyrics to U2's song
"MLK" are just a few of the ele
ments.
Bob Marley's lyrics "Get up,
stand up, don't give up the fight"
inspired senior Jesse Castro to paint
a portrait of Marley on the wall.
Castro's image of Marley is light
skinned and with near-blond
dreads, but Castro explained that
this outcome a result of "bad mixing
of paints" rather than intentional.
Other murals have been paint
ed in the Beta house, but facilities
workers have painted over them.
"A lot of times the University
doesn't respect the time and
effort people have put into these
murals," said Jim Lipuma, a
senior who has lived in the house
for three years. "A lot of people
just think it's a wall."
King Kong and University
policy
Lynn Glick, associate manager
of student undergraduate hous
ing, said plans for a mural gener
ally need to be approved by the
dormitory or house they will
appear in. She added, however,

that she doesn't think there is
"any clear-cut policy."
University policy regarding
existing murals was called into
question earlier this year over an
incident involving a painting in
Branner Hall.

Branner's decade
old King Kong
finally meets his
match — the facili
ties painters.

For seven years, King Kong
climbed Hoover Tower in Bran
ner's room 307. However, last
summer King Kong met his
match — the facilities painters.
They covered the mural with
out the knowledge of either the
students or Resident Fellow Ken
nell Jackson.
However, a mural will usually
be painted over "only if the house

votes on it," according to Glick.
She explained the mural was
probably painted over as part of
the a rotational painting program.
"Painting over of the King Kong
mural in Branner was purely a
mistake," she said. "Our policy has
been consistent. I feel strongly
about preservation of student art."
"You have to recognize that
this is a huge operation," Glick
said. "Sometimes these things
just happen."
Alumna Anita De Lucio, who
researched the Chicano murals at
Stanford, said the artwork is
more likely to remain when there
is a "community attached to the
murals or when professional
artists have worked on them."
Emerging murals
In addition to the existing
murals, students in various resi
dences are making their own con
tributions to Stanford history by
creating new ones.
There are three murals in
progress as a result of a SWOPSI
class titled "Study and Commem
oration of the American Indian
500-year Struggle Through a
Mural." Burciaga said the class,

which he taught fall quarter, has
as an overall theme "the celebra
tion of the indigenous cultures
and the history of these groups."
Members of the class, such as
Aki McKinzie and Martin Martin,
believe these murals are especial
ly important for the communities
they represent at Stanford.
The black community "reaching
out and rising up from their strug
gles" is the theme of an Ujamaa
mural currently in progress, accord
ing to sophomore Miguel Huidor.
The mural shows the bond that
evolved between Native Ameri
cans and blacks in times of slav
ery, said Huidor, one of the artists.
"The blacks and Native Ameri
cans formed a bond because they
were fighting for the same cause
— their freedom," Huidor said.
"They helped each other escape
and intermarried. The two are
breaking the chains of slavery."
Recollecting her own experi
ence working on murals in Casa
Zapata, De Lucio observed that
"by nature, the production of a
mural has the effect of bringing
people together."
"It's kind of like baring your
soul to everybody," she said.

mural is "Reaction to the Violence
of Media Racism." It portrays
three women: a young Mestiza, a
faceless blonde woman and an
elderly Mestiza.
Some people interpret the face
lessness of the blonde as a racist
statement against Caucasian
women. Last quarter, an anony
mous student pasted a face on the
mural and wrote in an anony
mous note, "I feel like I represent
more than my own personal feel
ings about this mural. We are not
all white, faceless oppressors."
However, Burciaga gave a dif
ferent interpretation of the
woman's facelessness. The blonde
represents the image of people in
Mexican television — the majority
of whom are whites, he said.
"The faceless woman is a myth
in Mexico," Burciaga said. "The
young woman on the right and
the old woman on the left perhaps
represent the reality of Mexico."
But junior Eric Buxton, a
Serra resident, said, "When I

think of a theme house, I think of
a group that would be open to
other opinions and actively pursu
ing openness and discussion
about ethnic issues."
"It's total irony that they have
a mural that discriminates
against Caucasians," he added.
According to Keith Guy, direc
tor of housing and food services,
"murals contribute to the overall
theme. We preserve them because
they are clearly art, although they
might not be comfortable for
everyone to see."
Student expression and
inspiration
Some of the other houses with
murals are Lambda Nu, Colum
bae, Kairos, the Enchanted Broc

house.
Most of EBF's murals are
musically oriented — the cover of
Pink Floyd's "The Dark Side of
the Moon" stands on the wall,
while "The Tongue," the Rolling
Stones' trademark symbol, is
painted on another.
The four-wall mural in the Beta
house is a mix of expressions and
subjects. The "Drop Acid, Not the

Bomb" slogan, a Chekhov quote, a
portrait of Bob Mar ley, an elaborate
tree and the lyrics to U2's song
"MLK" are just a few of the ele
ments.
Bob Marley's lyrics "Get up,
stand up, don't give up the fight"
inspired senior Jesse Castro to paint
a portrait of Marley on the wall.
Castro's image of Marley is light
skinned and with near-blond
dreads, but Castro explained that
this outcome a result of "bad mixing
of paints" rather than intentional.
Other murals have been paint
ed in the Beta house, but facilities
workers have painted over them.
"A lot of times the University
doesn't respect the time and
effort people have put into these
murals," said Jim Lipuma, a
senior who has lived in the house
for three years. "A lot of people
just think it's a wall."
King Kong and University
policy
Lynn Glick, associate manager
of student undergraduate hous
ing, said plans for a mural gener
ally need to be approved by the
dormitory or house they will
appear in. She added, however,

that she doesn't think there is
"any clear-cut policy."
University policy regarding
existing murals was called into
question earlier this year over an
incident involving a painting in
Branner Hall.

Branner's decade

finally meets his
match — the facili
ties painters.

For seven years, King Kong
climbed Hoover Tower in Bran
ner's room 307. However, last
summer King Kong met his
match — the facilities painters.
They covered the mural with
out the knowledge of either the
students or Resident Fellow Ken
nell Jackson.
However, a mural will usually
be painted over "only if the house

votes on it," according to Glick.
She explained the mural was
probably painted over as part of
the a rotational painting program.
"Painting over of the King Kong
mural in Branner was purely a
mistake," she said. "Our policy has
been consistent. I feel strongly
about preservation of student art."
"You have to recognize that
this is a huge operation," Glick
said. "Sometimes these things
just happen."
Alumna Anita De Lucio, who
researched the Chicano murals at
Stanford, said the artwork is
more likely to remain when there
is a "community attached to the
murals or when professional
artists have worked on them."
Emerging murals
In addition to the existing
murals, students in various resi

tributions to Stanford history by
creating new ones.
There are three murals in
progress as a result of a SWOPSI
class titled "Study and Commem
oration of the American Indian
500-year Struggle Through a
Mural." Burciaga said the class,

which he taught fall quarter, has
as an overall theme "the celebra
tion of the indigenous cultures
and the history of these groups."
Members of the class, such as
Aki McKinzie and Martin Martin,
believe these murals are especial
ly important for the communities
they represent at Stanford.
The black community "reaching
out and rising up from their strug
gles" is the theme of an Ujamaa
mural currently in progress, accord
ing to sophomore Miguel Huidor.
The mural shows the bond that
evolved between Native Ameri

"The blacks and Native Ameri
