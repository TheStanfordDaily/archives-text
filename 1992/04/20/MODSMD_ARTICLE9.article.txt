# Here they come: Pro Fros to hit campus
## Organizers hope to provide 'honest,' alcohol-free view of Stanford 
### Jessica Bar 
Beginning today, nearly 1,000 prospective
freshmen will flood the campus to get a taste
of Stanford life and decide where to spend
their college careers.
The Prospective Freshmen week visitors
have been paired with student hosts and will
stay in freshman dorms for two or three days,
during which they may attend dozens of activ
ities and information sessions.
"What we tell the hosts is to just to be hon
est with the Pro Fros, to answer all their ques
tions and to remember what it's like choosing
a college," said sophomore Marney Cheek, co
director of the week.
"We're trying to help them make an
informed decision about what college to
choose," Cheek said. "We don't necessarily
want to make Stanford seem like the ideal col
lege. We want to present the real college to
them."
Cheek and her co-directors, sophomores
Jason Pate and Kali Taylor, have been work
ing since January to put the packed program
together.
Many student organizations and University
offices will host events providing prospective
freshmen with information about academic
and cultural opportunities on campus.
For example, prospective freshmen will

have the chance to learn about some of the
most important aspects of a Stanford educa
tion in a talk titled, "Flirting, Dating and Sex
at Stanford" with Jerry Talley, a former Stan
ford professor.
Psychiatry Prof. Herant Katchadourian,
who teaches the popular course, "Human Sex
uality," will be featured in another talk about
human relationships.
Social events include a scavenger hunt with
an appropriate prize: "Fro Yo at the Co Po"
with Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
James Montoya.
Saturday night's alcohol-free "Disco Infer
no" party is billed as the week's biggest event.
"We want to make the party fun and keep it
very dry at the same time," said freshman Joe
Davila, the special events coordinator.
Davila and his committee have been work
ing with Project R2ISC to come up with "fun"
non-alcoholic beverages for the party, includ
ing Sunrise Surprise, a mixture of orange
juice, ginger ale and grenadine.
Copies of the recipes have also been given to
dorm and house coordinators for use at dorm
parties.
The concern over alcohol highlights prob
lems of past Pro Fro weeks, during which
prospective freshmen have attended parties
where alcohol was available.
Pro Fro week is being held one week later

this year so it will not coincide with Rush or
Alpha Sigma's "Exotic Erotic" party, as it did
last year.
The scheduling alleviates some of the Pro
Fro coordinators' worries, but concern remain
that there will be many dorm parties because
it's "sort of a dead weekend," according to
Cheek.
"We are very, very clear about the alcohol
policy," Cheek said. "Pro Fro week is Univer
sity-sponsored and completely dry. We empha
size that these students, as well as their hosts,
are underage and that there is also an impor
tant distinction between being a high school
student and a student going here."
Student hosts have been told not to bring
prospective freshmen to fraternity parties,
and fraternities will be monitoring their
events to insure that visitors are not admitted,
according to program coordinators.
Still, the possibility remains that prospec
tive freshmen will come to Stanford with
visions of wild campus parties dancing in their
heads.
"Maybe they expect to find that on a college
campus, but that's really not what Pro Fro
Week is billed as," Cheek said.
"I think Pro Fros come in not expecting
just to party, but to meet Stanford students
and see if they're comfortable here," she said.
"They can do that without alcohol."
