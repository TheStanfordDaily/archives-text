The 'DoffCemyer Lecture Series: Visions for a free Society
"Saving the Planet
Through Economic
Incentives"
Speaker: Walter Block
Environmental concerns top the list for the 1990'5. It seems as
though the evening news is filled with stories pointing to a
single fact: mankind is ruining the environment, and ruining it
quickly. While this may be overstated, nonetheless, concern for
the environment is high. Environmentalists have proposed
solving pollution problems through increased regulation on
business. But there may be a better approachâ€”one that
involves eliminating people's incentives toward environmental
harm.
Walter Block is Associate Professor of Economics at Holy Cross
University. He has written over 250 articles and has had five
speeches published in "Vital Speeches of the Day." In addition
he is the author of the classic Defending the Undefendable.
