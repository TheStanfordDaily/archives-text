# Casper takes a hard look at tuition, financial aid

Hoping to make people "think critical
ly" about the problems facing Stanford,
incoming University President Gerhard
Casper yesterday explored ideas as radi
cal as cutting all financial aid and making
non-professional graduate students pay
tuition themselves.
In a speech to Stanford economists last
night, Casper said he was offering "ques
tions, not solutions" to the financial difFi

culties facing universities. Casper is visit
ing campus this week to consult with
Stanford's vice presidents and deans.
Asked to give a speech on the future of
higher education finance in the United
States, Casper said he preferred to speak on
the economics of major private universities.
In his wide-ranging speech, he
expressed skepticism about whether
these universities can maintain the cur
rent tuition system in the future.
Casper cited the sizable difference
between actual tuition paid by those who
receive financial aid and those who do not.

This process causes a virtual "transfer of
payments" to the poorer students, he said.
As tuition rises above $100,000 for
four years, Casper said in an interview,
there will be more students resistant to
paying the full price, causing a greater
strain on the financial aid system.
"I sometimes wonder whether we
wouldn't be better off charging a much
lower rate of tuition and then denying all
financial aid," Casper said in the speech,
offering the idea as one of a number of pos
sible solutions.
But senior Vince Ricci, director of the

ASSU Financial Aid Advocacy Office, said
such a policy "completely goes against the
mission of Stanford" if it does not allow stu
dents from low-income families to attend.
In the interview, Casper said offering
new ideas was his way of "challenging the
audience" to think seriously about rev
enue problems.
Although he said he wants Stanford to
remain accessible to all, Casper said the
administration "needs to rethink" how
tuition and financial aid should work.
He said he may set up a "task force on
pricing" when he becomes president.

Casper set up a similar task force as
provost at the University of Chicago.
One of the biggest problems with
tuition, he said in the speech, is that
graduate students who do not attend the
business or law schools "do not pay
tuition" for all practical purposes.
Graduate students are often given schol
arships and fellowships to defray the cost of
their education. Casper called the current
tuition prices for graduate students "fanta
sy levels" that are never really paid.
