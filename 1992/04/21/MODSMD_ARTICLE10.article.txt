Harris' execution blocked
SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (AP) — A federal appeals court yester
day put the execution of double murderer Robert Alton Harris on
hold hours before he was to become the first person to die in Cal
ifornia's gas chamber in 25 years.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued two stays of exe
cution hours apart — one based on a claim that Harris' brother
shot one of the victims, the other on a claim that execution by gas
is cruel and unusual punishment.
Prosecutors immediately appealed both rulings to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
Harris, 39, had been scheduled to die at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday for
murdering two San Diego teen-agers and stealing their car for use
in a bank robbery in 1978.
Benny Hill found dead
LONDON (AP) — Benny Hill, the leering, pop-eyed comedian
who was one of Britain's most popular television exports, was
found dead last night at his home, police said.
The comedian, who was 67, had been treated for a heart ailment
but there was no immediate word on the cause of death. Scotland
Yard said police were summoned by a neighbor to Hill's home in
Teddington, southwest London, where they found the body.
The first popular comic of British television, Hill made himself
an enduring hit with a saucy blend of mimicry and music-hall
sight gags.
