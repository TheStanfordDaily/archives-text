Student groups of color
benefit entire campus;
need students' mandate

Last week's special fee
election results proved that
much of Stanford's student
body is still suffering from the
delusion that student groups of
color are not an essential part of
the larger community.
Most of these groups, such as
MEChA, the Black Student Union
and the Stanford American Indian
Organization, had their requests
passed by needlessly slim majori
ties. Especially troubling was the
resounding defeat of the Organiza
tion of Arab-American Students in
Stanford, which was rejected by 60
percent of voters.
The results mark the continu
ing backlash against multicultur
alism, a trend that started a few
years ago and seems, to be gaining
ground today. Even more obvious
is the subtle racism the narrow
votes demonstrate.
In rejecting student of color
groups, many students claim the
groups are exclusive and intoler
ant of opposing viewpoints.
But in the current climate on cam
pus, that argument is invalid, and
often hides a blanketed bigotry. Sev
eral student of color groups — such
as the Black Student Union — have
acknowledged the criticisms made
against them and have attempted to
diversify, focusing more on outreach
and less on strong public stances.
But students still vote in large
numbers against student of color
groups — which reflects students'
preconceived, biased ideas about
the groups and the ethnicities they
represent, rather than a thought
ful analysis of each group's value.
A closer look at OASIS, an
active group that was one of the
most deserving on the special fees
ballot, provides an excellent exam
ple of that phenomenon.
OASIS was born out of the need
for the Stanford community to

educate itself in a balanced man
ner on issues concerning the Mid
dle East. In late 1990, the Ameri
can public was faced with the Per
sian Gulf crisis, a situation that
would soon degenerate into war.
But very few people knew enough
about the region to intelligently
support or protest the actions of
the U.S. government.
By attempting to educate the
Stanford community about Middle
East issues from an Arab perspec
tive, OASIS has bridged the gap
and emerged as an important fac
tor in smoothing relations between
the Arab and Israeli communities
on campus.
At the moment, OASIS is in the
process of drawing Dr. Hannan
Ashrawi, the spokesperson of the
Palestinian delegation at the
Madrid peace talks, to campus in
late spring or early fall. And OASIS
has organized important social
events as well. In two highly suc
cessful and well-attended pro
grams, called Arabic Nights, the
group introduced all interested stu
dents to Arabic food and culture.
Without these efforts, the Stan
ford community's debate over
Middle East issues is limited: We
would have only half of the story.
That is a recurring theme when
discussing student of color groups,
since the groups serve to balance
what would otherwise be a lopsid
ed debate. Many student voters, in
rejecting groups like OASIS, are
unaware of the important qualities
they bring to campus and instead
vote based on their stereotyped
views of those groups — which are
often far from the truth.
It is imperative that the student
body supports these groups
strongly in the future — not
because they benefit a certain seg
ment of the community, but
because they benefit everyone.
Multiculturalism is an issue
because it is a reality. All of us
must come to terms with the
changing face of American society,
and student groups of color are a
tremendous aid in making diverse
opinions heard.
