## Moving beyond all debate 
### 
Although rape is an "issue," i
did not write my last column with
the intention of taking a stance in a
debate or pointing fingers and saying
"guilty" to William Kennedy Smith or
anyone else.
I've heard two generalizations about
Stanford students.
Camp 1: The Disinterested.
Camp 2: The Debaters.
It would seem that if people are saying
anything at all here, then they're criticiz
ing some aspect of this institution or
arguing over some issue.
I hate arguing with people. You're
competing, and someone always has to
win. Or rather, someone has to lose.
I didn't expect some of the responses I
got from people about my last column. I
didn't expect a debate or an argument.
Listening and questioning, yes. But I feel
like these people expect me to have all the
answers, or at least an opinion on every
thing. But I don't. I am not so egotistical.
I wrote the column to encourage people,
both men and women, to think about them
selves and their own relationships and
interactions with others. I believe that this
is how the issue most closely affects us.
This does not mean that men should
reflect on themselves as oppressors and
that women should think of themselves
as victims necessarily. We are both capa
ble of applying pressure on others, con
sciously or subconsciously, coercing them

to do what we want or to accept what we
want to do to them.
I was horrified last year to find myself
asking a friend if I had done to him what
someone else had done to me. I had
kissed him and he had jerked away. When
I asked him if it was okay, he said no, and
suddenly I felt completely ashamed.
When I talked to him about it later, he
told me that he felt a lot of pressure in our
relationship, including peer pressure,
which surprised me. I told him how terri
ble I felt. All he could say was that the
pressure that I exerted on him was not the
same as had been placed on me years ago
because I posed no physical threat to him.
Although it is true that in most cases a
woman could not physically force a man
to have sex, I think that the danger is
there for sexual coercion in some form.
This is one reason why I believe rape and
its related issues should not be debated
but discussed collectively.
Often when we bring up rape for discus
sion, men and women split into factions.
Men feel defensive. Women feel angry or
hurt. Somebody has to be wrong. Somebody
has to be right. Once again, we're fighting.
Perhaps many people will disagree
with what I've said. I think the concept of
a woman sexually coercing a man seems
foreign because men in our society are
supposed to want sex, not refuse it.
Meanwhile, women are not supposed to
assert their sexuality in any form.

'We need to
move away
from roles of
aggressive and
submissive
behavior.'

As one man pointed out in a discussion
after "Acting Out," it is necessary for us
to talk about both women's sexuality and
men's sexuality. We need to move away
from clearly-defined roles of aggressive
and submissive behavior, away from a
"rape mentality."
Last week I suggested that people ask
their friends, their partners, if something
is okay — a touch, a kiss, sex. I meant that
both women and men should ask these
questions and also not be afraid of answer
ing truthfully. I believe in the beauty of
mutual consent and shared desires.
Communication has always been
important in everything we do. One of the
best things in life is sharing ourselves —
what we think and feel — with others inti
mately. If we share these personal goals,
then sexual assault and coercion cannot
remain a debate. It must be our concern,
our problem, our shared responsibility.
I am sick of debates and arguments.
There is a significant difference between
talking about an issue with someone and
having a debate. The goal is not to win
but to understand and make some
progress together.
