Grad student \ prefers 9 incoming COP over current one

WHEN I READ THE ASSU
Spring Election Handbook, I was
pleasantly surprised by a group
of students proposing an innovative
alternative to the same old politics,
namely, "I Prefer Not to Have a COP." I
cannot express my astonishment when I
read The Daily's "false" endorsement of
the "Prefer" slate.
Could it be that in one fell swoop,
with this intelligent and articulate edito
rial, The Daily was taking its first baby
steps down the long road to earning my
respect? Needless to say, I was surprised
considerably less when the "true"
endorsement appeared the next day.
As I read it, I realized that both the
form and the content of the fake editori
al in the previous issue were far above
what I have come to expect from The
Daily. The first "joke" editorial was not

funny at all; quite witty, but not funny.
It seriously addressed real issues and
real concerns and it made an innovative
recommendation to the students.
As if the "true," authorized Council of
Presidents endorsements by The Daily's
editorial board weren't enough, the April
20 edition again reaffirmed my previous
appraisals of The Daily's editorial staff.
I'm sure that the 2,233 students who
listed the "Prefer" slate somewhere on
their ballot appreciate the patronizing
tone with which their intelligence was
insulted.
First, the editorial places the "blame"
for the election results directly on the stu
dents. I was under the impression that
they taught critical thinking at this school:
The Daily apparently does not agree.
Next, The Daily places the blame on
the preferential ballot system. C'mon

guys, federal income taxes are complicat
ed, preferential ballots are not.
Finally, the editorial blames the "pub
lic relations performance" of the current
COP. As if the intelligence of the elec
torate hadn't been insulted enough, let
me cite a good example of the "public
relations" acumen of the current COP.
In the cover story of the same issue of
The Daily, current COP member John
Overdeck is quoted as bitterly saying, "I
think I'm better able to do it than the
bozos [students! elected." Is it not
implicit in his statement that only a
bozo would vote for a Council of Bozos?
Did he have the same estimation of the
intelligence of the student body when
they voted him in?
To explain the reallocation of the
COP salaries to other accounts in the
ASSU, Overdeck is quoted as saying,

"I'm just trying to help them [keep their
campaign promises]." Sorry, Overdeck,
"Prefer" promised to trim fat within the
ASSU, not reallocate funds to other
pork-barrels within the already bloated
organization.
This action infuriated me and a lot of
other students that I have spoken to
since reading the article. I hope that the
duly elected "Prefer" is able to uphold
their promises in spite of Overdeck's
"best" intentions.
Overdeck's statements and the
actions of the ASSU budget and finance
committee have done quite a bit to per
petuate the all-too-often deserved repu
tation of student government as a self
serving, elitist clique of resume-packers.
