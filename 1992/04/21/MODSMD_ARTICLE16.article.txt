# Campbell's comments warrant loss of salary
## 
### 
I have read the April 16 article in The
Daily about Mr. W. Glenn Campbell's
advocacy of genocide of the Serbian peo
ple in Croatia. It is abhorrent that any
body would consider genocide "a final
solution" to any problem.
When a person on the payroll of the
Hoover Institution makes such a state
ment, it becomes even more appalling,
since his association with Hoover adds
significantly more weight and the impri
matur of a (so far) respected institution
to his actions.
I am sure that Hoover would not toler
ate an advocate of German Nazis who
would go around applauding Hitler's exter
mination of the Jews, but would instantly
remove him from the payroll. Why did
Hoover elect to regard as "a personal mat
ter" the advocacy of Croatian Nazis who
have slaughtered (literally!) hundreds of
thousands of Serbians and Jews?

As an institution that lives on tax
deductible contributions, Hoover is
responsible to all the people of this coun
try. I demand that no tax deductible
funds be used for the Nazi advocacy and
that Mr. Campbell be immediately
removed from any sort of Stanford or
Hoover payroll.
I will inform the National Science
Foundation and any other Hoover sup
porter I know of this incident and
demand that they stop supporting the
institution while even token funds are
given for the support of Nazi ideology.
