# 'Bozos' of Prefer slate respond to Overdeck
## 
### 
We are writing this letter in response to
John Overdeck's highly intelligent remarks
regarding his motives for eliminating next
year's Council of Presidents funds.

What his comments reveal is a bitter
ness toward not only our slate for getting
elected, but toward the students for elect
ing us. Unfortunately, self-righteous
Johnny lacked the self-control and com
posure to contain his bad feelings. Conse
quently, he not only made himself look
pretty dumb but helped us make our
point about how ridiculous the C.O.P. is.
Johnny's bitterness is the reason why
he wants to eliminate next year's C.O.P.
budget instead of having us do it. While
we are glad he is doing some of our work
for us, his motives bother us.
The reason he gave for eliminating
next year's C.O.P. budget was he thought
we wouldn't carry out our campaign
promise of eliminating the C.O.P. Not
trusting us, he thought we would buy
beer instead. (Heck, we don't even like
beer.) He wanted to make sure himself
that we kept our campaign promise. He
was doing us a favor.
Perhaps last year's C.O.P. slate could
have done the same thing and given
Johnny's slate a similar favor and made
sure that his slate kept at least one of

their campaign promises. Then maybe
students wouldn't have become so dis
gusted with the C.O.P. and gotten rid of
it. Then maybe Johnny wouldn't have
made a hypocrite out of himself.
