## Revenge-minded Cardinal takes on San Jose State 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
It's the top of the ninth, and
you're at the plate. Your team is
down by three runs and the bases
are loaded. However, there are
two out, and you are facing the
best reliever on one of the top
baseball teams in the nation in
their ballpark. Here's the pitch.
You guess fastball down the pipe.
You guess right. The ball lands
beyond the outfield fence.
It's the stuff dreams are made
of. Every little kid that plays
stickball in the vacant lot down
the street puts himself in that
scenario. It's only a fantasy,
though. That kind of thing just
doesn't usually happen. It's only
a dream. Except last Feb. 18 at
Sunken Diamond. But for the
Cardinal, it was a nightmare.
On that day, the dream
belonged to San Jose State Uni
versity. Down 3-6 with the bases
loaded in the ninth, Spartan
Kraig Constantino hit a grand
slam off Aaron Dorlarque to take
the lead and the game 7-6, damp
ening the spirits of the Cardinal
after it had just swept the fourth
ranked Pepperdine Waves.
That game, among other
things, may be on the mind of the
Stanford baseball team when
they take on the Spartans today
at SJSU. Revenge can be sweet,
and beyond that, the Cardinal is
not in a position to lose a lot more
games. The NCAA usually takes
only three teams from the Pacific-
Ten Southern Division for region
al playoffs, and with the confer
ence as close as it is this year,
every little win counts. And there
are other benefits to playing

these non-league games.
"It's a great chance to get some
innings in for people who didn't
get time in the weekend series,"
said Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess. "And an opportunity
for other people to play against a
quality team."

'You want the extra
offense, but you don't
want to sacrifice the
defense.'

It seems that Marquess is tak
ing a serious look at "other" people
in the line-up. Lately, Chris Kem
per has moved from third to his old
position at second, spelling Jeff
DesJardins. Meanwhile, David
Holbrook, the early season first
baseman before the emergence of
Dusty Allen, has moved to third
base where he played last year.
"We're trying to get a little
more offense into the line-up,"
Marquess said. "We have to try to
get a lead for our pitchers to work
off of."
And a few runs may be all that
the pitching staff needs to work
with. Stanford's "men of the hill"
have been exceptional for the past
few weekends. In their last seven
games, since getting swept by
California, the Cardinal has gone
5-2 thanks largely to excellent
pitching, and that is something
Stanford can rely on no matter
what the lineup is.
"You want the extra offense,
but you don't want to sacrifice the
defense. Pitching and defense have
to be constant," Marquess said.
