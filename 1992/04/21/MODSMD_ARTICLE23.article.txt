# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
What can we say? It was a big weekend for
Stanford sports, and a lot of teams per
formed well. Who should be the Athletes of
the Week? Although several squads as a
whole did well, there were a couple of key
performances by players which lifted their
teams (both ranged No. 2 in the country)
over the top. They did it in different ways
with different approaches, but both made
big contributions. Heather Willens of the
women's tennis team and John Hribar of the
men's volleyball team are our Athletes of the
Week.
Willens is the No. 1 singles player for the
Cardinal and is the third-ranked player in col
legiate tennis in the nation. This weekend she
won both her matches as the Stanford women

upped their record to 20-2 overall, 9-1 in Pacif
ic 10 Southern Division play.
Willens ran over Krista Amend of Arizona
State, the No. 26 player in the nation, 6-0, 6-1,
in Friday's match. She just edged Amend
when the two met in Tempe earlier this year.
The Cardinal crushed the No. 7 Lady Sun
Devils 7-2 behind Willens' leadership.
Saturday's match was hardly a cakewalk,
however. Stanford was ahead 3-2 in singles
over No. 9 Arizona, but Willens was locked in a
tight struggle with seventh-ranked Danielle
Scott in the first singles spot.
The pressure was on Willens â€” if she won,
the Cardinal would hold a 4-2 lead and the
momentum going into doubles play. If she lost,
the sqore would be knotted up and the Wildcats
would have a better chance of dealing Stanford
its second loss in a week.
Scott had won the first set 7-6 (8-6 in the
tiebreaker), but Willens came back to take the
second set 6-4. The final set was even at two
games apiece and Scott had triple-break-point,
but Willens fought back, won the game, and
broke Scott in the next game to go up 4-2.
From there Willens had the momentum
and was hitting all her shots as she went on to
win the grueling three-hour contest 6-3. The
Cardinal won the match by the same score.
Her gutsy, tough play saved the team in a
tough scrape.

John Hribar was the men's volleyball
team's hero off the bench. Like Willens, Hrib
ar came through in the clutch for his team.
He had lost his starting spot earlier in the
year during the team's road trip games
against USC and UCLA when Joe Burghardt
came off the bench and played really well. But
now, ironically against that same Bruin team,
Hribar provided the spark to keep the team
going.
The No. 2 spikers had taken the first two

games in their Western Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association match against archrival
UCLA and were doing well in the third when
disaster struck.
Burghardt, who had been playing well, had
to leave the match with back spasms. Hribar
came in and didn't allow the team's momen
tum to falter as he played superbly, absolutely
whonking the ball on perfect hitting. The Car
dinal swept the Bruins to advance to the
WTVA finals against the Cal State-Northridge
Matadors.
Hribar didn't let down in this match either,
tallying 15 kills on 27 attempts with no errors.
He also recorded five digs and five block
assists as Stanford advanced to the NCAA
Final Four for the first time since 1989.
