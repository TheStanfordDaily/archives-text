Dear Sports Illustrated:
I just wanted to write and
thank you for the fine job you
did of turning Tommy Vardell
into a minor deity. In this age of
athletic lunacy, its amazing what
do for you.
From the initial Rockne-esque
pose to the closing handshake
with the little kid, "Touchdown"
Tommy really does seem like
everybody's Ail-American. I'd
like to say that we here at Stan
ford knew him since way back
when, but he has pretty much
been a surprise to everybody here
on the Farm as well.
What a surprise to have
though! Intelligent, family ori
ented, quick to talk about how
"the crumbling of morality and
integrity" has been eating away
at the foundation that was once
the great American empire —
Vardell does indeed seem too
good to be true.
What a sad comment on our
society.
It is interesting to me that
Tommy Vardell is a story simply
for what he is not. He is not paid
illegal money by the boosters. He
is not a drug user. He does not
shoot, hit, or molest people, and
he is not an egomaniac. In short,
he is not what the country has
almost come to expect from its
collegiate superstars.
Some may say that this is a
sweeping generalization, but the
story about Larry Johnson that
came a few pages later — while
painting a good picture of the
man — still told us that he may
have been using a $32,000
corvette illegally and that he did

not graduate. Of course compar
ing UNLV and Stanford may be
like the proverbial apples and
oranges, but that is only to our
athletic department's credit.
We at Stanford are blessed
with a lot of Tommy Vardells.
Athletes here catch flack from
the general student body all the
time, but it is usually minor stuff.
It mostly has to do with people

being rude at parties, yet verbally
obnoxious behavior is a lot better
to have around than the kind of
gun fight that occurred at Okla
homa a few years ago. In fact, the
worst thing I have heard happen
ing on campus (and actually saw)
was 300-pound offensive tackle
Bob Whitfield bloodying up a
guy's nose for returning the favor
of a tossed beer. Thank goodness
Whitfield got in the first punch
before his 140-pound opponent
had a chance to do any damage.
Pretty tame stuff compared to
Todd Marinovich getting kicked
off the USC football team for
cocaine abuse or Colorado players
being thrown into jail for rape a
few years ago. Unfortunately
those stories make the rounds all
