# SLAC to close if drastic budget cuts needed

Research at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center will end by 1995 if the worst of three
possible budget scenarios is enacted by
Congress.
The scenario, released last week by the
High Energy Physics Advisory Panel, suggests
that "all of the accelerator facilities be shut
down" by Sept. 30, 1995, said SLAC Associate
Director Eugene Rickansrud.
According to Rickansrud, the Department
of Energy gave the panel three budget possi
bilities to consider when making their recom
mendations to Congress on the future of high
energy physics in the United States.
The scenarios given to the panel dealt with
the national budget and whether it remained
level with inflation, grew slightly over infla
tion or decreased.
Roger Miller, a researcher at SLAC, says if
the worst scenario does become reality it
"almost gives SLAC no reason for existing."
Without SLAC, there would be only two high
energy physics labs in the United States — in
Texas and Illinois.

If the federal budget decreases and the
most drastic recommendation is enacted, it
would not mean the closing of SLAC, but a
sharp reduction in the amount of work per
formed at the facility, according to Rickansrud.
"The program would be very different than
it is now," he said. "It would mean reducing
the size of the lab and changing the nature of
the physics research."
Research at the facility would continue, but
researchers would have to go to other facilities
to conduct experiments, he added.
The worst-case scenario would also mean
the temporary suspension of plans to build a
B-factory — a facility for matter and anti-mat
ter research — at SLAC, according to Miller.
California Gov. Pete Wilson is lobbying
Congress for the $150 million facility.
If the middle scenario is enacted, experi
mentation at the Stanford Linear Collider
itself will stop next year. But the B-factory will
still be a priority at SLAC, Rickansrud said,
although it will be delayed a couple of years
In the best-case scenario, experimentation
will continue at SLAC and the B-factory will
be opened in 1994, according to Miller.

Miller says he believes "the lowest scenario
is so bleak that it is unlikely to come about.
Rickansrud added that he thinks "there is a
lot of physics to be done [at SLAC], since it is
the only physics facility researching electrons
in the country." He said he would be very dis
appointed if people felt that the field of elec
tron physics is no longer "viable."
Department of Energy representative Jeff
Sherwood said the panel that made the recom
mendations is a group of scientists the depart
ment asks for advice in determining the future
of high-energy research. The panel was asked
to make their recommendations based on the
scenarios given to them by the department.
The panel has been conducting its investi
gation since December.
Rickansrud said SL£ C was "disappointed"
with the recommendation anu hopes the
department will rethink its position.
Another SLAC researcher, Jonathan Dor
fan, said the recommendations are just guide
lines to hypothetical situations proposed by
the Energy Department. "The federal govern
ment is not stupid — they don't slow things
that are ready to go," he said.
