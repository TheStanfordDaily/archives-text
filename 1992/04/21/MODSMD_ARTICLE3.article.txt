# 'Quirky' preference system confused some COP voters

### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Confusion about preferential balloting
may have affected the outcome of last
week's Council of Presidents election,
according to the ASSU election commission
er and an informal Daily questionnaire cir
culated among student voters this weekend.
The election, the first in which the ASSU
used a system of balloting where voters
ranked choices on a list of slates, resulted in
the surprise victory of "I Prefer not to Have
a COP" over "Independents: a New Era"
and "Students First."
Election Commissioner Enda Hu said
hundreds of the ballots submitted demon
strate a misunderstanding of the way pref
erential voting works.
And fewer than 20 percent of the stu
dents who responded to The Daily's ques
tionnaire reported having understood how a
winner is determined from ballots.
The survey was answered by 212 stu
dents in six undergraduate and graduate
student residences.
Although unscientific, The Daily's sur
vey suggests that many students did not
understand preferential balloting.
What's more, the responses indicate that
many students misunderstood the process
in a way that may have unintentionally ben
efited Prefer.
Had officials conducted a runoff between
Prefer and Independents, the Independents
might have won more of the Students First
swing votes than they did under preferen
tial balloting, according to responses from
the survey.
How the system works
Preferential balloting is a concept foreign
to most Americans but common in elections

in Australia and some European countries.
In fact, graduate senator Neil Crellin,
who is from Australia, spent much of one
ASSU Senate meeting explaining the sys
tem to confused senators before they
approved it for this year's election.
Preferential balloting asks voters not
only for their first choice among a number
of candidates or slates but for an entire
ranked list.
If no candidate receives a nwgority of
votes on the first ballot — a common occur
rence in ASSU elections — election officials
simulate runoffs by inferring from voters'
ranked lists their preferences among
remaining candidates.
Determination of a winner in preferential
balloting occurs in a series of "rounds," with
low-vote-getters eliminated between rounds
and their voters' selections reshuffled
among the remaining contenders according
to the voters' next-highest choices.
After seven such rounds in this year's
election, which resulted in the elimination
of "YOU!" and hundreds of write-in slates,
ASSU officials reached the semifinal round
in which the remaining slates were Prefer,
Independents and Students First.
Students First trailed the other two
slates, so its votes were redistributed
according to what its constituency members
marked as their next-highest choice.
Of those votes, 527 went to Prefer and
398 to Independents. Another 581 votes
went to no one at all, apparently represent
ing the ballots of students who did not iden
tify Prefer or Independents as an alternate
to Students First.
That surprised observers, since Students
First and Independents were considered
similar politically and Prefer members
