# 'Quirky' preference system confused some COP voters
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Confusion about preferential balloting
may have affected the outcome of last
week's Council of Presidents election,
according to the ASSU election commission
er and an informal Daily questionnaire cir
culated among student voters this weekend.
The election, the first in which the ASSU
used a system of balloting where voters
ranked choices on a list of slates, resulted in
the surprise victory of "I Prefer not to Have
a COP" over "Independents: a New Era"
and "Students First."
Election Commissioner Enda Hu said
hundreds of the ballots submitted demon
strate a misunderstanding of the way pref
erential voting works.
And fewer than 20 percent of the stu
dents who responded to The Daily's ques
tionnaire reported having understood how a
winner is determined from ballots.
The survey was answered by 212 stu
dents in six undergraduate and graduate
student residences.
Although unscientific, The Daily's sur
vey suggests that many students did not
understand preferential balloting.
What's more, the responses indicate that
many students misunderstood the process
in a way that may have unintentionally ben
efited Prefer.
Had officials conducted a runoff between
Prefer and Independents, the Independents
might have won more of the Students First
swing votes than they did under preferen
tial balloting, according to responses from
the survey.
How the system works
Preferential balloting is a concept foreign
to most Americans but common in elections

in Australia and some European countries.
In fact, graduate senator Neil Crellin,
who is from Australia, spent much of one
ASSU Senate meeting explaining the sys
tem to confused senators before they
approved it for this year's election.
Preferential balloting asks voters not
only for their first choice among a number
of candidates or slates but for an entire
ranked list.
If no candidate receives a nwgority of
votes on the first ballot — a common occur
rence in ASSU elections — election officials
simulate runoffs by inferring from voters'
ranked lists their preferences among
remaining candidates.
Determination of a winner in preferential
balloting occurs in a series of "rounds," with
low-vote-getters eliminated between rounds
and their voters' selections reshuffled
among the remaining contenders according
to the voters' next-highest choices.
After seven such rounds in this year's
election, which resulted in the elimination
of "YOU!" and hundreds of write-in slates,
ASSU officials reached the semifinal round
in which the remaining slates were Prefer,
Independents and Students First.
Students First trailed the other two
slates, so its votes were redistributed
according to what its constituency members
marked as their next-highest choice.
Of those votes, 527 went to Prefer and
398 to Independents. Another 581 votes
went to no one at all, apparently represent
ing the ballots of students who did not iden
tify Prefer or Independents as an alternate
to Students First.
That surprised observers, since Students
First and Independents were considered
similar politically and Prefer members
advocated the abolition of the
COP altogether. Many expected
Independents to inherit the votes
released by the elimination of
Students First.
Indeed, 65 percent of those stu
dents who reported in the survey
that Students First was their
favorite among the three slates
said they preferred Independents
to Prefer.
But almost half of the students
in that group — who said they
liked Independents more than
Prefer — reported that they still
ranked "Prefer" as their second
choice on their ballots, explaining
in the questionnaire that they did
so because they did not want Inde
pendents to beat Students First.
Another third did not rank
Independents at all, many citing
the same reason.
According to political scien
tists, switching such "secondary
preferences" can't help a first
choice slate because a voter's sec
ondary rankings are only consid
ered if the voter's first choice is
already eliminated.
But the voter can inadvertant
ly be helping his third choice beat
his second choice in future
rounds, if that first choice is
indeed dropped.
Misconceptions
Several respondents said they
believed at the time of voting that
the slates received points accord
ing to their rankings, and that the
points were aggregated in some
way to determine a winner.

Typical of these responses, one
student wrote, "It was my under
standing that the rankings were
added up for each slate and the
winner was the one with the low
est point total."
Such an error would have led
students to try to interpose other
slates between their first and sec
ond choices if they thought their
second choice might potentially
defeat their first one.
For example, one student who
said she favored Independents
and considered Students First
"the best alternative" still ranked
Students First after Prefer
because she "thought Students
First was the greatest threat" to a
victory for her first-choice slate.
Ballots of the confused
Hu, the election commissioner,
said hundreds of the ballots sub
mitted demonstrate similar mis
understandings.
For example, several hundred
students marked only a first
choice and did not indicate what
their preferences among the other
slates were, Hu said.
Students who mark their bal
lots in such a way do not improve
their favorite slate's chances, but
do render their ballots ineffective
for their secondary preferences.
They thereby remove them
selves from what election officials
considered the pool of "total votes
cast," and make it easier for one
of the other slates to have a
majority of the remaining votes.
Thus Prefer was able to win
with only 2,233 of the 5,788 votes
originally cast in the election.
"Quirky" results
The preferential balloting pro

cedure, which is also known as sin
gle-transferrable-vote election, is
used in a handful of former British
colonies, including Australia,
South Africa, Ireland and Malta.

Even the American
Mathematical Society
made errors when it
described preferntial
voting to its members.

Several American cities have
experimented with it, but only
two now employ the system for
any type of election today, accord
ing to Steven Brahms, a political
science professor at New York
University and an expert on alter
native voting systems
In one of those elections, for
New York City's school board,
voter participation is less than 10
percent because "people don't
understand the system and don't
trust it," said Brahms, the author
of "Approval Voting" and"The
Presidential Election Game."
Even the American Mathemat
ical Society made errors when it
described the process to its mem
bers, Brahms said. "It's complicat
ed — people don't understand it."
Furthermore, Brahms said,
single-transferrable-vote systems
are used almost exclusively in
elections which produce multiple
winners, such as those for school
board or city council.
"I can't think of a good reason
for using it in single-winner elec
tions," said Brahms, who added
that Stanford's ASSU is "the first

organization I've heard of that
used it in a single-winner election."
Brahms said the system often
produces "quirky" results in sin
gle-winner elections. "It works
such that the extremes often
become the ones in the runoff,"
he said, "because the mainstream
candidates divide up the votes."
Candidates' hindsight
Election officials did publish a
detailed explanation of preferen
tial balloting in the ASSU Elec
tion Handbook.
Hu said candidates also should
have done more to explain the sys
tem to their constituencies and
encourage them to vote for their
true second choices.
A slate could also have asked
already-committed students to
consider them as a second choice,
Hu said.
None of the political material
distributed during elections week
contained such a plea, a fact
which candidates said yesterday
they have come to regret.
Junior Jason Snyder, a member
of Independents, said he told "six or
seven people who asked me about
it" to represent their other prefer
ences accurately "because I knew
that couldn't hurt us." But "we
didn't think to make it a central
part of our campaign," Snyder said.
Hu predicted that the outcome
will raise questions about the use
of preferential balloting by the
ASSU, and that the system may
not be used again next year.
But he maintained that the
preferential system still "is a lot
faster and a lot cheaper."
A runoff election would have cost
about $6,000 and required another
week of campaigning, Hu said.

Hu said candidates also should
have done more to explain the sys

A slate could also have asked
already-committed students to

Hu said.
None of the political material
distributed during elections week
contained such a plea, a fact
which candidates said yesterday
they have come to regret.
Junior Jason Snyder, a member
of Independents, said he told "six or
seven people who asked me about
it" to represent their other prefer
ences accurately "because I knew
that couldn't hurt us." But "we
didn't think to make it a central
part of our campaign," Snyder said.
Hu predicted that the outcome
will raise questions about the use
of preferential balloting by the
ASSU, and that the system may
not be used again next year.
But he maintained that the
preferential system still "is a lot

A runoff election would have cost

Confusion about preferential balloting
may have affected the outcome of last
week's Council of Presidents election,
according to the ASSU election commission

The election, the first in which the ASSU
used a system of balloting where voters
ranked choices on a list of slates, resulted in
the surprise victory of "I Prefer not to Have
a COP" over "Independents: a New Era"
and "Students First."
Election Commissioner Enda Hu said
hundreds of the ballots submitted demon
strate a misunderstanding of the way pref
erential voting works.
And fewer than 20 percent of the stu
dents who responded to The Daily's ques
tionnaire reported having understood how a
winner is determined from ballots.
The survey was answered by 212 stu
dents in six undergraduate and graduate
student residences.
Although unscientific, The Daily's sur
vey suggests that many students did not
understand preferential balloting.
What's more, the responses indicate that
many students misunderstood the process
in a way that may have unintentionally ben
efited Prefer.
Had officials conducted a runoff between
Prefer and Independents, the Independents
might have won more of the Students First
swing votes than they did under preferen
tial balloting, according to responses from
the survey.
How the system works
Preferential balloting is a concept foreign
to most Americans but common in elections

in Australia and some European countries.
In fact, graduate senator Neil Crellin,
who is from Australia, spent much of one
ASSU Senate meeting explaining the sys
tem to confused senators before they
approved it for this year's election.
Preferential balloting asks voters not
only for their first choice among a number
of candidates or slates but for an entire
ranked list.
If no candidate receives a nwgority of
votes on the first ballot — a common occur
rence in ASSU elections — election officials
simulate runoffs by inferring from voters'
ranked lists their preferences among
remaining candidates.
Determination of a winner in preferential
balloting occurs in a series of "rounds," with
low-vote-getters eliminated between rounds
and their voters' selections reshuffled
among the remaining contenders according
to the voters' next-highest choices.
After seven such rounds in this year's
election, which resulted in the elimination
of "YOU!" and hundreds of write-in slates,
ASSU officials reached the semifinal round
in which the remaining slates were Prefer,
Independents and Students First.
Students First trailed the other two
slates, so its votes were redistributed
according to what its constituency members
marked as their next-highest choice.
Of those votes, 527 went to Prefer and
398 to Independents. Another 581 votes
went to no one at all, apparently represent
ing the ballots of students who did not iden
tify Prefer or Independents as an alternate
to Students First.
That surprised observers, since Students
First and Independents were considered
similar politically and Prefer members
advocated the abolition of the
COP altogether. Many expected
Independents to inherit the votes
released by the elimination of
Students First.
Indeed, 65 percent of those stu
dents who reported in the survey
that Students First was their
favorite among the three slates
said they preferred Independents
to Prefer.
But almost half of the students
in that group — who said they
liked Independents more than
Prefer — reported that they still
ranked "Prefer" as their second
choice on their ballots, explaining
in the questionnaire that they did
so because they did not want Inde
pendents to beat Students First.
Another third did not rank
Independents at all, many citing
the same reason.
According to political scien
tists, switching such "secondary
preferences" can't help a first
choice slate because a voter's sec
ondary rankings are only consid
ered if the voter's first choice is
already eliminated.
But the voter can inadvertant
ly be helping his third choice beat
his second choice in future
rounds, if that first choice is
indeed dropped.
Misconceptions
Several respondents said they
believed at the time of voting that
the slates received points accord
ing to their rankings, and that the
points were aggregated in some
way to determine a winner.

Typical of these responses, one
student wrote, "It was my under
standing that the rankings were
added up for each slate and the
winner was the one with the low
est point total."
Such an error would have led
students to try to interpose other
slates between their first and sec
ond choices if they thought their
second choice might potentially
defeat their first one.
For example, one student who
said she favored Independents
and considered Students First
"the best alternative" still ranked
Students First after Prefer
because she "thought Students
First was the greatest threat" to a
victory for her first-choice slate.
Ballots of the confused
Hu, the election commissioner,
said hundreds of the ballots sub
mitted demonstrate similar mis
understandings.
For example, several hundred
students marked only a first
choice and did not indicate what
their preferences among the other
slates were, Hu said.
Students who mark their bal
lots in such a way do not improve
their favorite slate's chances, but
do render their ballots ineffective
for their secondary preferences.
They thereby remove them
selves from what election officials
considered the pool of "total votes
cast," and make it easier for one
of the other slates to have a
majority of the remaining votes.
Thus Prefer was able to win
with only 2,233 of the 5,788 votes
originally cast in the election.
"Quirky" results
The preferential balloting pro

cedure, which is also known as sin
gle-transferrable-vote election, is
used in a handful of former British
colonies, including Australia,
South Africa, Ireland and Malta.

tists, switching such "secondary
preferences" can't help a first
choice slate because a voter's sec
ondary rankings are only consid
ered if the voter's first choice is
already eliminated.
But the voter can inadvertant
ly be helping his third choice beat
his second choice in future
rounds, if that first choice is
indeed dropped.
Misconceptions
Several respondents said they
believed at the time of voting that
the slates received points accord
ing to their rankings, and that the
points were aggregated in some
way to determine a winner.

Typical of these responses, one
student wrote, "It was my under
standing that the rankings were
added up for each slate and the
winner was the one with the low
est point total."
Such an error would have led
students to try to interpose other
slates between their first and sec
ond choices if they thought their
second choice might potentially
defeat their first one.
For example, one student who
said she favored Independents
and considered Students First
"the best alternative" still ranked
Students First after Prefer
because she "thought Students
First was the greatest threat" to a
victory for her first-choice slate.
Ballots of the confused
Hu, the election commissioner,
said hundreds of the ballots sub
mitted demonstrate similar mis
understandings.
For example, several hundred
students marked only a first
choice and did not indicate what
their preferences among the other
slates were, Hu said.
Students who mark their bal
lots in such a way do not improve
their favorite slate's chances, but
do render their ballots ineffective
for their secondary preferences.
They thereby remove them
selves from what election officials
considered the pool of "total votes
cast," and make it easier for one
of the other slates to have a
majority of the remaining votes.
Thus Prefer was able to win
with only 2,233 of the 5,788 votes
originally cast in the election.
"Quirky" results
The preferential balloting pro

cedure, which is also known as sin
gle-transferrable-vote election, is
used in a handful of former British
colonies, including Australia,
South Africa, Ireland and Malta.

Even the American
Mathematical Society
made errors when it
described preferntial
voting to its members.

Several American cities have
experimented with it, but only
two now employ the system for
any type of election today, accord
ing to Steven Brahms, a political
science professor at New York
University and an expert on alter
native voting systems
In one of those elections, for
New York City's school board,
voter participation is less than 10
percent because "people don't
understand the system and don't
trust it," said Brahms, the author
of "Approval Voting" and"The
Presidential Election Game."
Even the American Mathemat
ical Society made errors when it
described the process to its mem
bers, Brahms said. "It's complicat
ed — people don't understand it."
Furthermore, Brahms said,
single-transferrable-vote systems
are used almost exclusively in
elections which produce multiple
winners, such as those for school
board or city council.
"I can't think of a good reason
for using it in single-winner elec
tions," said Brahms, who added
that Stanford's ASSU is "the first

organization I've heard of that
used it in a single-winner election."
Brahms said the system often
produces "quirky" results in sin
gle-winner elections. "It works
such that the extremes often
become the ones in the runoff,"
he said, "because the mainstream
candidates divide up the votes."
Candidates' hindsight
Election officials did publish a
detailed explanation of preferen
tial balloting in the ASSU Elec
tion Handbook.
Hu said candidates also should
have done more to explain the sys
tem to their constituencies and
encourage them to vote for their
true second choices.
A slate could also have asked
already-committed students to
consider them as a second choice,
Hu said.
None of the political material
distributed during elections week
contained such a plea, a fact
which candidates said yesterday
they have come to regret.
Junior Jason Snyder, a member
of Independents, said he told "six or
seven people who asked me about
it" to represent their other prefer
ences accurately "because I knew
that couldn't hurt us." But "we
didn't think to make it a central
part of our campaign," Snyder said.
Hu predicted that the outcome
will raise questions about the use
of preferential balloting by the
ASSU, and that the system may
not be used again next year.
But he maintained that the
preferential system still "is a lot
faster and a lot cheaper."
A runoff election would have cost
about $6,000 and required another
week of campaigning, Hu said.
