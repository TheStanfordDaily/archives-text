# Politicians discuss, reject plans to block new COP
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
The election of the new Council of
Presidents slate has been questioned by
some students involved in the ASSU,
although most say they won't oppose vali
dation of the results at tonight's ASSU
Senate meeting.
Several students last week discussed
but rejected plans to keep the"I Prefer
Not to Have a COP" slate — which won
last week's race — from assuming office.
Freshman Gabe Lucas, who won an
undergraduate senate seat, said he was
"disturbed" by a conversation he had with
seven other student government members
early Friday morning, after Prefer won
the election.
Lucas said the discussion focused on
methods of blocking the slate from taking
office, including keeping the senate from
validating the COP portion of the election.
He said participants suggested having
the third-place slate declare their cam
paign invalid — by claiming they had com
mitted campaign violations — in the hope
that votes for that slate would be redis
tributed to give the second-place slate an
election victory.
Senator John Hall, who ran for COP
with Students First, said the discussion did
take place but was on a "theoretical" level.
"I'm very much of the opinion that the
decision stands," Hall said. "The election
was very fair." The group was "not a guer
rilla squad ready to violate the election,"
Hall said.
According to Lucas, participants talked
about "not having any confidence in the 'Not
COP' slate," and said the slate's election was
a "mistake" on the part of the voters.
He said the meeting lasted from about

3:30 a.m. to 5:30 a.m., immediately after
the initial election results were announced,
among students who "happened to be sit
ting around" the ASSU offices.
Lucas said he was disturbed by what he
saw as an attempt to go against the stu
dent vote in the election.
