# Polls may have closed, but bickering persists

The election is over, but the mud
hasn't stopped flying.
Members of the current Council of
Presidents and the slate-elect, "I Prefer
Not to Have a COP," have exchanged
epithets including "bozo," "self-righ
teous" and "hypocrite" in the last few
days, and an end to the name-calling is
not in sight.
Prefer slate member Ed Mun said
he thought current COP member
John Overdeck's characterization of
the victorious un-slate as "bozos" in
yesterday's Daily was "uncalled for."
"Sure, the COP has a right to be
bitter, but there's no reason to make
remarks like that," Mun said.
In response to Overdeck's "bozo"
comment and his insinuation that
the Prefer slate might use ASSU
funds to buy beer, the slate has
wrote a letter referring to
Overdeck as "self-righteous John
ny" and a "hypocrite." The letter
appears on page 4 of today's Daily.
But Mun doesn't see his slate's
letter as contributing to the
degeneration of the relationship
between the two groups.
"We're trying to take this in a
good-hearted way and we think our
response is fitting," said Mun.
"Some of my friends have asked me
why I haven't been more belligerent.
"I say, 'Why be angry? Let
everyone else lose their tempers
and look stupid.' "
Overdeck characterized the
exchanges as "really immature."

"I'm somewhat disgusted to
see someone tearing down a lot of
hard work," said Overdeck. "Peo
ple should not make a career out
of tearing at others' hard work
rather than doing their own."
Overdeck disputes the Prefer
slate's claim that the current
COP has not kept their campaign
promises. "We have kept many of
our promises," he said.
"I think it would be much bet
ter to have [people] like us who
care about the ASSU than people
who pass out fliers with big bugs
on them," Overdeck added.
Prefer slate member Jay Jack
son said he didn't understand
what brought the name-calling
on. "We don't have anything
against John Overdeck, at least
not that I know of," said Jackson.
"I hope it ends right here,"
Mun said.
