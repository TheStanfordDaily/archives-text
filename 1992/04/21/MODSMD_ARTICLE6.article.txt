# No fear here
## Python just a cuddly pet for Sigma Nu members 
### Angie Chuang Editorial staff 
Draped across senior Herbie Berry's shoulders,
Tyson surveys his surroundings with a disinterest
ed stare and a sinister hiss. He flickers his forked
tongue as he wraps himself around Berry's forearm.
Tyson is the latest member of a Sigma Nu legacy.
Berry, junior Brock Moseley and senior Tuan Van Le
keep Tyson — a 13-foot-long Burmese Python, the
fraternity's mascot — in their off-campus apartment.
Because Sigma Nu's symbol is a snake, a mas
cot is placed under the care of one or more of its
members each year and makes appearances at
some Sigma Nu parties.
Berry, a political science major, and Moseley, an
American Studies major, said the snake is usually
kept off campus but has been kept in the Suites before
— without the University's knowledge, of course.
Tyson is a newcomer to Sigma Nu. His prede
cessor, Sturge, passed away last year due to an
"unfortunate error," Moseley said. "He was acci
dentally left in his cage over winter break and
there was no heat."
When senior Mark Carper heard about the loss,
he gave Tyson, his pet for the last two years, to
Sigma Nu member Ricky Davis. Carper was about
to graduate and could no longer keep the snake.
Moseley said that when Tyson moved in with
them, they had "no prior experience as to how to
take care of a snake."
"It's been a learning process," he said.
Tyson's most outstanding personality trait is that
he is "extremely laid back," according to Moseley.
"He's very appropriate for the Stanford atmo
sphere," he said. "He's also really loving."
However, as Berry pointed out as he struggled to
get Tys° n to face a photographer, "When he can't
do exactly what he wants, he kind of trips out."

Junior Brock Moseley and senior Herbie Berry display the latest in
fashionable neckwear — their 13-foot Burmese Python named Tyson.
Although he has a cage, Tyson
spends most of his time roaming
around the apartment. Berry said
they don't worry about stepping
on him or losing him.
"Believe me, if he's around,
you can see him," Berry said.
Moseley said since Tyson has
about five favorite spots in the
house to hang out, they always
know where to look for him if he's
not in sight.
"His favorite place to sleep is
behind the fridge," Mosley said.
The only minor complication
caused by having a python roam
ing around their apartment is for
getting to tell their friends.
"They tend to go into cardiac
arrest when they see him," Berry
said.
Once, Berry remembered, a
friend was visiting who "had a
serious fear of snakes."
"She saw Tyson and thought
that he was fake. 'No way that's
real,' she said. When she saw him
move, she freaked out."
Mosley added, "It's too bad

many people have such a fear of
snakes. Most are as harmless as
any other pet."

Berry said that
although the sight of
Tyson strangling and
consuming small
furry animals is "dis
turbing," there is no
blood and "it's ... an
experience."

"l think the fear comes from
Biblical origins, with Adam and
Eve and the serpent," he said.
"They're all just man-made
fears."
Tyson will only attempt to eat
what he can digest — which
excludes humans, Berry pointed
out.
So what does Tyson eat?
"Rabbits!" Berry said, with a
morbid gleam in his eye.
Berry, Moseley and Le buy a
live "feeder rabbit" from a pet

store every two to three weeks.
Each rabbit costs about $12.
Aside from rabbits, Tyson is also
fond of "one-eyed rats," Berry
said, laughing.
At a usual meal, Tyson strikes
his prey in the face and quickly
coils around it, strangling it."He
does this all so quickly, if you
blink you'll miss it," Berry said.
Although his head is smaller
than a fist, he dislocates his jaws
to accommodate the food. "You
can see this bulge in his body after
he swallows it," Berry said.
Tyson has no teeth, only ridges
in his mouth. Acids in his body
break down his food.
Berry said that although the
sight of Tyson strangling and con
suming small furry animals is
"disturbing," there is no blood
and "it's ... an experience."
Tyson, who is only three years
old, will continue to grow as he
keeps eating — until he is about
26 feet long, double his current
size.
Berry and Moseley's relation
ship with Tyson is marked by an
acute awareness of Tyson's
actions and moods.
As Tyson slithered through the
lawn in the Oval, Berry and Mose

ley noticed that he was especially
fidgety. "He's kind of tripping
out. I've never seen him make an
'O' like that," Moseley said. "He's
probably just not used to the
grass and the open space."
Berry said, "When he stretches
all the way out, that means he's
going to doo-doo. And when he
does, watch out!"
They pointed out that his eyes
had a grayish cast because he was
about to shed, which he does once
every three to four months. "Nor
mally, his eyes are really beauti
ful," Berry said. "They look like
cat's eyes."
Moseley said they have devel
oped a special bond with Tyson
through their experiences with
him. "He's our baby. He's a part
of the family," Moseley said.
"It's like having a fish tank in
your house," he added. "It gives it
that special type of life."
Berry and Moseley said in
accordance with Sigma Nu tradi
tion, they will pass Tyson on to a
different owner at the end of this
year. "We'll be really sorry to see
him go," Moseley said.
"We get so used to him," Berry
said. "Sometimes we forget how
beautiful he is."

"It's been a learning process," he said.
Tyson's most outstanding personality trait is that
he is "extremely laid back," according to Moseley.
"He's very appropriate for the Stanford atmo
sphere," he said. "He's also really loving."
However, as Berry pointed out as he struggled to
get Tys° n to face a photographer, "When he can't
do exactly what he wants, he kind of trips out."


Ernest Villanueva — Daily
Junior Brock Moseley and senior Herbie Berry display the latest in
fashionable neckwear — their 13-foot Burmese Python named Tyson.
Although he has a cage, Tyson
spends most of his time roaming
around the apartment. Berry said
they don't worry about stepping
on him or losing him.
"Believe me, if he's around,
you can see him," Berry said.
Moseley said since Tyson has
about five favorite spots in the
house to hang out, they always
know where to look for him if he's
not in sight.
"His favorite place to sleep is
behind the fridge," Mosley said.
The only minor complication
caused by having a python roam
ing around their apartment is for
getting to tell their friends.
"They tend to go into cardiac
arrest when they see him," Berry
said.
Once, Berry remembered, a
friend was visiting who "had a
serious fear of snakes."
"She saw Tyson and thought
that he was fake. 'No way that's
real,' she said. When she saw him
move, she freaked out."
Mosley added, "It's too bad

many people have such a fear of
snakes. Most are as harmless as
any other pet."

Berry said that
although the sight of
Tyson strangling and
consuming small
furry animals is "dis
turbing," there is no
blood and "it's ... an
experience."

"l think the fear comes from
Biblical origins, with Adam and
Eve and the serpent," he said.
"They're all just man-made
fears."
Tyson will only attempt to eat
what he can digest — which
excludes humans, Berry pointed
out.
So what does Tyson eat?
"Rabbits!" Berry said, with a
morbid gleam in his eye.
Berry, Moseley and Le buy a
live "feeder rabbit" from a pet

store every two to three weeks.
Each rabbit costs about $12.
Aside from rabbits, Tyson is also
fond of "one-eyed rats," Berry
said, laughing.
At a usual meal, Tyson strikes
his prey in the face and quickly
coils around it, strangling it."He
does this all so quickly, if you
blink you'll miss it," Berry said.
Although his head is smaller
than a fist, he dislocates his jaws
to accommodate the food. "You
can see this bulge in his body after
he swallows it," Berry said.
Tyson has no teeth, only ridges
in his mouth. Acids in his body
break down his food.
Berry said that although the
sight of Tyson strangling and con
suming small furry animals is
"disturbing," there is no blood
and "it's ... an experience."
Tyson, who is only three years
old, will continue to grow as he
keeps eating — until he is about
26 feet long, double his current
size.
Berry and Moseley's relation
ship with Tyson is marked by an
acute awareness of Tyson's
actions and moods.
As Tyson slithered through the
lawn in the Oval, Berry and Mose

ley noticed that he was especially
fidgety. "He's kind of tripping
out. I've never seen him make an
'O' like that," Moseley said. "He's
probably just not used to the
grass and the open space."
Berry said, "When he stretches
all the way out, that means he's
going to doo-doo. And when he
does, watch out!"
They pointed out that his eyes
had a grayish cast because he was
about to shed, which he does once
every three to four months. "Nor
mally, his eyes are really beauti
ful," Berry said. "They look like
cat's eyes."
Moseley said they have devel
oped a special bond with Tyson
through their experiences with
him. "He's our baby. He's a part
of the family," Moseley said.
"It's like having a fish tank in
your house," he added. "It gives it
that special type of life."
Berry and Moseley said in
accordance with Sigma Nu tradi
tion, they will pass Tyson on to a
different owner at the end of this
year. "We'll be really sorry to see
him go," Moseley said.
"We get so used to him," Berry
said. "Sometimes we forget how
beautiful he is."
Draped across senior Herbie Berry's shoulders,
Tyson surveys his surroundings with a disinterest
ed stare and a sinister hiss. He flickers his forked
tongue as he wraps himself around Berry's forearm.
Tyson is the latest member of a Sigma Nu legacy.
Berry, junior Brock Moseley and senior Tuan Van Le
keep Tyson — a 13-foot-long Burmese Python, the
fraternity's mascot — in their off-campus apartment.
Because Sigma Nu's symbol is a snake, a mas
cot is placed under the care of one or more of its
members each year and makes appearances at
some Sigma Nu parties.
Berry, a political science major, and Moseley, an
American Studies major, said the snake is usually
kept off campus but has been kept in the Suites before
— without the University's knowledge, of course.
Tyson is a newcomer to Sigma Nu. His prede
cessor, Sturge, passed away last year due to an
"unfortunate error," Moseley said. "He was acci
dentally left in his cage over winter break and
there was no heat."
When senior Mark Carper heard about the loss,
he gave Tyson, his pet for the last two years, to
Sigma Nu member Ricky Davis. Carper was about
to graduate and could no longer keep the snake.
Moseley said that when Tyson moved in with
them, they had "no prior experience as to how to
take care of a snake."
"It's been a learning process," he said.
Tyson's most outstanding personality trait is that
he is "extremely laid back," according to Moseley.
"He's very appropriate for the Stanford atmo
sphere," he said. "He's also really loving."
However, as Berry pointed out as he struggled to
get Tys° n to face a photographer, "When he can't
do exactly what he wants, he kind of trips out."
