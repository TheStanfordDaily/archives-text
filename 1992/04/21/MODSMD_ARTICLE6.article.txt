## Python just a cuddly pet for Sigma Nu members 
### Angie Chuang Editorial staff 
Draped across senior Herbie Berry's shoulders,
Tyson surveys his surroundings with a disinterest
ed stare and a sinister hiss. He flickers his forked
tongue as he wraps himself around Berry's forearm.
Tyson is the latest member of a Sigma Nu legacy.
Berry, junior Brock Moseley and senior Tuan Van Le
keep Tyson — a 13-foot-long Burmese Python, the
fraternity's mascot — in their off-campus apartment.
Because Sigma Nu's symbol is a snake, a mas
cot is placed under the care of one or more of its
members each year and makes appearances at
some Sigma Nu parties.
Berry, a political science major, and Moseley, an
American Studies major, said the snake is usually
kept off campus but has been kept in the Suites before
— without the University's knowledge, of course.
Tyson is a newcomer to Sigma Nu. His prede
cessor, Sturge, passed away last year due to an
"unfortunate error," Moseley said. "He was acci
dentally left in his cage over winter break and
there was no heat."
When senior Mark Carper heard about the loss,
he gave Tyson, his pet for the last two years, to
Sigma Nu member Ricky Davis. Carper was about
to graduate and could no longer keep the snake.
Moseley said that when Tyson moved in with
them, they had "no prior experience as to how to
take care of a snake."
"It's been a learning process," he said.
Tyson's most outstanding personality trait is that
he is "extremely laid back," according to Moseley.
"He's very appropriate for the Stanford atmo
sphere," he said. "He's also really loving."
However, as Berry pointed out as he struggled to
get Tys° n to face a photographer, "When he can't
do exactly what he wants, he kind of trips out."
