# Drug use could mean loss of funds to students on federal aid
## 
### June Fang Staff writer 
The federal government has a message
for college students who plan to use
drugs: Just say no, or lose your financial
aid.
In an aggressive nationwide campaign
conducted by the U.S. Justice Depart
ment, the "Denial of Federal Benefits
Program" initiative will revoke benefits
— including federally funded student
loans — for up to 10 years when a recip
ient is convicted of drug use or traffick
ing.
According to Justice Department
spokeswoman Brenda Burrows, those
convicted could lose their rights to Pell
Grants, post-secondary school loans and
a host of occupational and professional
licenses.
The initiative is expected to directly
affect college students, since one in three

college undergraduates receives federal
funds and more than half of all college
students have experimented at least once
with illegal substances, according to Bur
rows.
One Stanford student on federal
financial aid, who wished to remain
anonymous, said the initiative would
make him "think a little bit more" before
using drugs. "It would make me think
twice," he said. "I don't want to lose the
money."
Another student said he wasn't as
bothered. "It would not affect my behav
ior in any way," he said. "It might make
me pause for a second before doing it, but
I'd still do it anyway."
He said he was not very concerned
because he felt it was unlikely that he
would ever be caught.
"I'm not one to 'trip' and go off the
rocker, so I wouldn't attract any atten
tion," he said. "I also have no respect for

One student said the federal initiative 'would not affect
my behavior in any way. It might make me pause for a
second before [taking drugs], but I'd still do it anyway.'

the reasons why the government has
made certain drugs illegal."
According to Mike Dalich, the director
of the Justice Department's initiative,
the "Denial of Federal Benefits Program"
creates a new sentencing option for
judges. Few drug offenders ever serve
prison terms, and probation is usually
not an effective deterrent.
Dalich said the threat of losing federal
benefits may be more threatening than a
sentence of un-supervised probation.
Since September 1990, the initiative
has been in effect in Rhode Island.
"This is a disincentive for casual users,"
Dalich said. Hopefully, the higher penalties

may deter casual users so that "some
might not want to do drugs after aIL"
For 1991-92, 44 percent of Stanford
students received need-based aid, much
of which is from the federal government
and the University, according to Assoc.
Financial Aid Director Ellen Williams.
The possibility of losing financial aid
should not come as a surprise, she said.
Anyone filling out the financial aid appli
cation for the University should not have
had any drug convictions in the past.
A clause in the 1992-93 Student Aid
Report reads, "Warning: As more fully
set forth in section 5301 of the Anti-Drug
Abuse Act of 1988, if you are convicted of

drug distribution or possession your eligi
bility for Title IV student financial aid is
subject to suspension or termination."
Any federal agency which wishes to
issue a license or grant aid must first con
sult the "Debarment List," a public direc
tory that includes the names of all those
who have been convicted of drug-related
charges. Those who appear on the list are
considered ineligible until their sentence
expires.
Approximately 700 people have been
placed on the list since September 1990,
Dalich said.
Revoked benefits can be reinstated
over a period of time if those convicted
complete a drug treatment program. If
the individual tests drug free six months
after treatment, benefits can be reinstat
ed. Dalich said this is an incentive to stay
in treatment.
"It is an innovative way to change the
equation," he said.
