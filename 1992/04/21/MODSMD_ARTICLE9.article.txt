Clerk injured in mall robbery
Two unarmed men robbed a women's clothing store in the
Stanford mall yesterday, taking some cash and injuring a clerk.
According to Sergeant Brad Zook of the Palo Alto Police
Department, the suspects entered Ports International while the
clerk was in an adjoining store.
Zook said that when the clerk returned to find the men in the
store, she struggled with them and received a few minor scrapes.
The men, one white and one Hispanic, fled immediately after
taking the cash, Zook said. The exact amount of cash taken is
unknown, but is estimated to be small, he added.
Police are currently interviewing witnesses for further infor
mation about the robbery, Zook said.
