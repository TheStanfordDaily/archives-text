# Senate OKs budget, election
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
In a budget approved last
night, the ASSU Senate took
$17,100 in salaries and funding
from next year's Council of Pres
idents and diverted most of it into
a reserve fund.
The senate put $2,100 toward
pay raises for the administrative
manager and workers in the
Financial Aid Advocacy Office,
funnelling the remaining $15,000
into a "contingency reserve" used
to cover excess spending by stu
dent groups.
In last week's election, the vic
torious "I Prefer Not to Have a
COP" slate promised to abolish
the office and give their salaries
to student organizations.
When a senator asked Prefer
slate member Ed Mun to com
ment on the budget proposal, he
initially refused because of "a
conflict of interest."
But Mun later told the senate
he "wouldn't mind getting a
salary" so he could personally see
that it goes to the ASSU Program
Board. The board provides fund
ing for student groups.
The budget approved by the
senate last night totals $272,388
in income and expenditures, a
17.6 percent drop from last year.
According to graduate senator
Doug Bone, chair of the budget
committee, the main reason for
the cut is that "the University
has given [the ASSU] much less
money than in the past to do
things like banking" for student
groups.
The allowance the ASSU
receives from the University was
cut to $89,495 this year, a 42.1
percent drop from last year's fig
ure. By next year, the University
plans to cut the entire ASSU
allowance.
The money taken from the
COP includes the salary, operat
ing budget and discretionary
funding. The original proposals
were made last week by the bud
get and finance committee.
These original proposals would
have given $1,100 of the money
formerly for COP use to increase
salaries for the administrative
manager, the deputy senate chair
and the Financial Aid Advocacy
Office workers.
The proposed budget also
included $5,000 for the creation
of a group to conduct phone polls
next year.
The senate, however, rejected
the deputy chair's salary increase
and the polling funds.

Some debate took place over
whether give back the $14,400
COP salary. Graduate senator
James Vera, a member of the bud
get committee who voted to
remove the salary, changed his
mind last night and proposed an
amendment to reinstate it.
Vera said that he now believes
the Prefer slate should be allowed
to decide how to spend the money
for themselves rather than have
the senate delegate the funds for
them.
Undergraduate senator Raphe
Beck supported Vera's amend
ment, saying the issue should be
decided after the COP resigns and
the student government is
restructured.
Current COP member John
Overdeck, who made the original
proposal removing the COP
money, opposed the amendment.
He argued that the senate needs
to make sure the Prefer slate does
not take a salary without doing
any work.
Beth Morgan, another current
COP member, agreed. She added
that the senate had to pass a bud
get reflecting the assumption that
no COP will exist next year. The
amendment, which needed a two

thirds vote, failed 10-10.
Overdeck also pointed out that
even with the salary increase, the
administrative manager's salary
next year will be less than it was
this year.
An initial version of the bud
get, which removed all salary
increases, failed to pass. The bud
get was approved 14-4-2 after the
Financial Aid Advocacy Office and
administrative manager salaries
were increased.
Next year will be the first year
employees at the advocacy office
receive pay.
In other business, the senate
validated the results of last
week's ASSU elections.
Although some students
involved in the ASSU were unhap
py about the victory of the Prefer
slate and had, over the weekend,
discussed preventing the senate
from validating the COP portion
of the election, the process took
only about two minutes.
"In general, I have trouble val
idating an election I did not win,
but in here I think it's appropri
ate," joked Ron Brown, an under
graduate senator and member of
the unsuccessful "Independents:
A New Era" slate.

But Mun later told the senate
he "wouldn't mind getting a
salary" so he could personally see
that it goes to the ASSU Program
Board. The board provides fund
ing for student groups.
The budget approved by the
senate last night totals $272,388
in income and expenditures, a
17.6 percent drop from last year.
According to graduate senator
Doug Bone, chair of the budget
committee, the main reason for
the cut is that "the University
has given [the ASSU] much less
money than in the past to do
things like banking" for student
groups.
The allowance the ASSU
receives from the University was
cut to $89,495 this year, a 42.1
percent drop from last year's fig
ure. By next year, the University
plans to cut the entire ASSU
allowance.
The money taken from the
COP includes the salary, operat
ing budget and discretionary
funding. The original proposals
were made last week by the bud
get and finance committee.
These original proposals would
have given $1,100 of the money
formerly for COP use to increase
salaries for the administrative
manager, the deputy senate chair
and the Financial Aid Advocacy
Office workers.
The proposed budget also
included $5,000 for the creation
of a group to conduct phone polls
next year.
The senate, however, rejected
the deputy chair's salary increase
and the polling funds.

Some debate took place over
whether give back the $14,400
COP salary. Graduate senator
James Vera, a member of the bud
get committee who voted to
remove the salary, changed his
mind last night and proposed an
amendment to reinstate it.
Vera said that he now believes
the Prefer slate should be allowed
to decide how to spend the money
for themselves rather than have
the senate delegate the funds for
them.
Undergraduate senator Raphe
Beck supported Vera's amend
ment, saying the issue should be
decided after the COP resigns and
the student government is
restructured.
Current COP member John
Overdeck, who made the original
proposal removing the COP
money, opposed the amendment.
He argued that the senate needs
to make sure the Prefer slate does
not take a salary without doing
any work.
Beth Morgan, another current
COP member, agreed. She added
that the senate had to pass a bud
get reflecting the assumption that
no COP will exist next year. The
amendment, which needed a two

thirds vote, failed 10-10.
Overdeck also pointed out that
even with the salary increase, the
administrative manager's salary
next year will be less than it was
this year.
An initial version of the bud
get, which removed all salary
increases, failed to pass. The bud
get was approved 14-4-2 after the
Financial Aid Advocacy Office and
administrative manager salaries
were increased.
Next year will be the first year
employees at the advocacy office
receive pay.
In other business, the senate
validated the results of last
week's ASSU elections.
Although some students
involved in the ASSU were unhap
py about the victory of the Prefer
slate and had, over the weekend,
discussed preventing the senate
from validating the COP portion
of the election, the process took
only about two minutes.
"In general, I have trouble val
idating an election I did not win,
but in here I think it's appropri
ate," joked Ron Brown, an under
graduate senator and member of
the unsuccessful "Independents:
A New Era" slate.
