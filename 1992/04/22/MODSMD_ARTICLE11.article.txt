Four months in jail for former bookkeeper
A former bookkeeper who embezzled more than $18,000 from a
campus childcare center was sentenced last week to four months in
county jail and three year's probation.
Tammy Shipp was arrested last September after the director of
the Stanford Arboretum children's center discovered checks Shipp
had made payable to herself out of the center's bank account. Shipp
had been fired the previous month for poor job performance.
Shipp's $15,000 bail was returned to the center as restitution.
She will pay back the remaining $3,281 as part of her probation.
The nonprofit center is independent of the University and pro
vides care for about 135 children whose parents are employees and
students at Stanford, Stanford Hospital and the Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital.

Law Review President elected
Christopher Cooper has been elected president of the Stanford
Law Review by fellow members of the student-produced scholarly
journal.
As president, Cooper will have ultimate responsibility for all
administrative, financial and editorial aspects of the publication.
He said he wants to broaden the journal to include more student
written work and "articles which are accessible to a wide range of
people and that spur controversy and debate."
Cooper, 25, is the third black student to hold the post in three
years.
Approximately 40 percent of the law school's enrollment consists
of members of ethnic minority groups, and 10 percent of the stu
dents are black.
