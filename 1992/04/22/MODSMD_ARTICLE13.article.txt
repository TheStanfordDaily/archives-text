### 
Dubious precedent set
in conflict over housing
involving gay student

The recent room
CHANGE at Hammarskjold
House signals the need for
an explicit University housing pol
icy, one that states clearly that
Stanford is unwilling to accommo
date housing preferences based on
a potential roommate's sexual ori
entation.
Owen Maubane, citing religious
reasons, said he would not live
with a gay student. Hammarskjold
accommodated him by holding a
new draw and ensuring that he
would not again be assigned to live
with Barney Cheng, who is gay.
Although some individuals
involved may feel more comfort
able now that the rooms have been
changed, the University would be
unwise to feel satisfied with the
legacy of this event.
The University should not aid
and abet anti-gay behavior in resi
dences, and explicit houses guide
lines should be written to make
this point clear.
In Hammarskjold, the move was
relatively easy because there were
unoccupied spaces in several
rooms. But if there is no such easy
compromise, no effort should be
made to accommodate an intoler
ant student. The person with the
problem with his or her roommate
should be forced to look elsewhere
for housing.
Diana Conklin, associate direc
tor of Residential Education, said
Maubane's move was justified
because his reasons most likely
"can be established" in the reli
gious works of his faith. However,
she did not know his faith and had
not been shown any specific pas
sages to back up his claims.
It is disturbing that the Univer
sity's efforts to support religious
diversity can legitimate intoler
ance for gays.
Instead of complacently accept

ing religious arguments, the Uni
versity must ask itself a tough
question: At what point do religious
concerns become an unacceptable
reason to request a room change?
Religious reasons simply aren't
a good enough excuse. And while
the University challenges them in
the case of ethnicity, it passively
accepts anti-gay views under the
pretense of religious doctrine.
Conklin said that if a white stu
dent requested a same-ethnicity
roommate for religious reasons,
she would "definitely want to see"
the religious text used to justify
such a belief.
Since even this test of legitimacy
was not used in this case, there
appears to be a double-standard gov
erning University housing policies.
It seems that if Cheng had been
rejected because he was Asian
rather than gay, Maubane would
have been challenged much more
strongly.
The University's housing policy
should not allow a student's intol
erance of a gay or lesbian room
mate to be treated any different
than a student's refusal to share
living space with someone based
on ethnicity.
There is no small amount of
hypocrisy in a University that on
one hand guarantees married-stu
dent housing to same-sex couples
and on the other hand allows anti
gay sentiments to determine place
ment of other residents.
Despite Stanford's progressive
domestic partners policy, there still
exists an unspoken assumption
that anti-gay sentiments are not
only common, but acceptable and
excusable.
In this case, the decision to
allow the switch was made not by
the University, but by the house
itself. Although it is important to
allow houses like Hammarskjold to
have the greatest amount of
autonomy and control over their
own affairs, the University should
step in if one student is being dis
criminated against.
In Cheng's case, a bad precedent
has been set.
