Campbell's comments
condemned by scholar
Allow me to comment on the most
recent racist slurs by Mr. W. Glenn
Campbell, former director of the Hoover
Institution, who said it was too bad the
Croats did not completely exterminate
the inferior Serbs, so that the Croats
would have no trouble with them today.
As right before two previous World
Wars, a campaign of ridiculous lies is
orchestrated against the small Serbian
nation. Most of the American press con
tinues to regurgitate propaganda materi
al of the new Axis.
The Tito-created Yugoslav administra
tive units of Croatia and Slovenia are
represented as democratic states with
developed industry and economy, super
imposed against disorderly and barbaric
Serbs without culture and inferior in
every respect. While the photographs and
descriptions show Croats as clean-cut
and smart-looking, Serbs are portrayed
as dirty and primitive slivovitza drinkers.
It is in this context that one should
understand the racist ideology of Hoover
bigot Campbell (whose high opinion of
himself is no doubt based on his $143,000
salary), who finds it a matter of free
speech to tell his stories about culturally
and in any other way inferior Serbs.
He is intolerant of the free speech of
Dr. Trifkovic, a knowledgeable and elo
quent visiting British historian and jour
nalist, and cannot wait to see him leave.
One day soon we will hear of Mr. Camp
bell cynically explaining extermination of
Jews in gas chambers, as freedom of
expression.
I wonder whether Mr. Campbell
would exercise his freedom of speech a
little differently had a member of his
family been mutilated by Croat Ustashe
and their gouged eyes sent to Pavelich
for his novel collection.
There is no place for a racist and a Nazi
apologist even at. a highly conservative insti
tution like Hoover, let alone a respectable
university like Stanford. Firing Campbell

would be a small step in resisting forces of
evil and darkness and a giant step in cor
recting Hoover's tarnished reputation.
Let us hope that people like Dr.
Trifkovic will stay on and fight these
small minds of unlimited ignorance and
so aid troubled Serbia.

Anti-Arab racism leads
to defeat of OASIS fee
It was shocking to learn that the spe
cial fee request of the Organization of
Arab—American Students in Stanford
(OASIS) was defeated in the ASSU elec
tion, receiving the second largest per
centage of "no" votes.
This result does not appear to be due to
general resentment of students of color,
since the fee requests of similar organiza
tions were approved.
In recent years racism, though it has
not necessarily diminished, has become
socially unacceptable in polite circles.
The sole exception to this trend is the
case of Arabs and Muslims, who are reg
ularly presented in the media and by
public figures in grossly stereotyped
ways: "Arab oil sheiks," "shi'ite terror
ists," "rag heads."
When a pipe bomb went off in New
York last February, Guardian Angels
leader Curtis Sliwa responded, "Hezbol
lah! Allah Akbar! Are you sure there
were no towelheads in the area?" (Fol
lowers of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane
announced their responsibility for the
bombing and then retracted their claim.)
Most Americans are far more familiar
with negative images of Arabs than with
those of Nobel laureate in literature
Naguib Mahfouz, or architect Hasan
Fathi, a pioneer in designing housing for
the poor, or United Nations Secretary
General Butros Ghali.
Stanford's curriculum is shamefully thin
on matters relating to Arabs and Islam.
OASIS has made a valuable contribu
tion to campus life by expanding the

availability of cultural and educational
opportunities in these areas.
What is the justification for failing to
support this endeavor?

Student voices disgust
at ASSU & its politics
The politics of the ASSU make me
vomit until the dry heaves halt my
breathing.
The April 20 story "ASSU committee
approves plan to ax funding for incom
ing COP" just helps to foster the stench
of disgusting feces festering within the
ASSU government.
I voted for the"I Prefer Not to Have
a COP" slate this year because I have
been at Stanford for three years and
have seen virtually no contribution to
the student body by the COP slates.
Take the current COP, for example.
What has it done? The only concrete evi
dence of a student service I've seen is a
completely useless course guide. It con
tains no helpful information, but by
golly it looks pretty.
And as for the campaign promise of
improving the lighting around campus, I
have seen absolutely nothing.
I did not think "Prefer" had a chance,
but 53 percent of the student body also
wanted to divert the $16,000 to student
groups.
The fact that current COP member
John "Bozo" Overdeck can't get over his
juvenile bitterness does not bother me a
great deal. But if he, as a COP member, is
devoted to meeting the needs and desires
of the student body, why is his bill allo
cating $2,600 of COP funds to people's
salaries, including the senate deputy
chair? Why is $5,000 being recommended
for a phone-polling organization?
Fifty-three percent of our student
body voted for "Prefer" because we
wanted the COP funds to go to student
services, not to bureaucracy.
And as for the "Prefer" slate, I am

beginning to wonder if they are just throw
ing around more empty campaign promis
es. Donating your salaries to student
groups is probably the most easily fulfilled
campaign promise I have ever heard, yet
all I see is ignorance and lack of action.
It is only fair to give the new COP a
fair chance to prove itself to the stu
dents, but so far I can't see any sunshine
through the cloudy haze. How about
taking some action?

Columnist's remarks
on Perot misinformed
This letter is in response to the article
by Ari Richter in the April 20 issue of The
Daily entitled "From Bart to Bartleby."
While I agree with Mr. Richter's posi
tion on the outcome of the ASSU COP
elections, I strongly disagree with the
"throw-away" comments about Ross Perot.
Richter's comment that Perot would
"do away with representative democracy
on a national level" is a gross mischarac
terization of Perot's positions.
Let me further correct Mr. Richter's
stereotyping of Perot supporters as people
who are interested in him only because
"he's not mainstream." I am not an angry
voter, nor am I someone who wants to
destroy the institutions of government.
Rather, I am someone who feels that
Ross Perot is far superior to either
George Bush or Bill Clinton as a poten
tial president, and that is why I intend
to support him.
Mr. Perot's electronic town hall,
essentially a modern form of national
referendum which Mr. Richter derides in
his article, is used widely in Europe, par
ticularly in Switzerland and Denmark.
Has the level of political discourse
gotten so low on campus that anyone
with a new idea must be immediately
branded as an extremist or a loony?

In recent years racism, though it has

The sole exception to this trend is the

Most Americans are far more familiar
with negative images of Arabs than with
those of Nobel laureate in literature
Naguib Mahfouz, or architect Hasan

Stanford's curriculum is shamefully thin
on matters relating to Arabs and Islam.
OASIS has made a valuable contribu

availability of cultural and educational
opportunities in these areas.
What is the justification for failing to

Student voices disgust
at ASSU & its politics
The politics of the ASSU make me
vomit until the dry heaves halt my
breathing.
The April 20 story "ASSU committee
approves plan to ax funding for incom
ing COP" just helps to foster the stench
of disgusting feces festering within the
ASSU government.
I voted for the"I Prefer Not to Have
a COP" slate this year because I have
been at Stanford for three years and
have seen virtually no contribution to
the student body by the COP slates.
Take the current COP, for example.
What has it done? The only concrete evi
dence of a student service I've seen is a
completely useless course guide. It con
tains no helpful information, but by
golly it looks pretty.
And as for the campaign promise of
improving the lighting around campus, I
have seen absolutely nothing.
I did not think "Prefer" had a chance,
but 53 percent of the student body also
wanted to divert the $16,000 to student
groups.
The fact that current COP member
John "Bozo" Overdeck can't get over his
juvenile bitterness does not bother me a
great deal. But if he, as a COP member, is
devoted to meeting the needs and desires
of the student body, why is his bill allo
cating $2,600 of COP funds to people's
salaries, including the senate deputy
chair? Why is $5,000 being recommended
for a phone-polling organization?
Fifty-three percent of our student
body voted for "Prefer" because we
wanted the COP funds to go to student
services, not to bureaucracy.
And as for the "Prefer" slate, I am

beginning to wonder if they are just throw
ing around more empty campaign promis
es. Donating your salaries to student
groups is probably the most easily fulfilled
campaign promise I have ever heard, yet
all I see is ignorance and lack of action.
It is only fair to give the new COP a
fair chance to prove itself to the stu
dents, but so far I can't see any sunshine
through the cloudy haze. How about
taking some action?

Columnist's remarks
on Perot misinformed
This letter is in response to the article
by Ari Richter in the April 20 issue of The
Daily entitled "From Bart to Bartleby."
While I agree with Mr. Richter's posi
tion on the outcome of the ASSU COP
elections, I strongly disagree with the
"throw-away" comments about Ross Perot.
Richter's comment that Perot would
"do away with representative democracy
on a national level" is a gross mischarac
terization of Perot's positions.
Let me further correct Mr. Richter's
stereotyping of Perot supporters as people
who are interested in him only because
"he's not mainstream." I am not an angry
voter, nor am I someone who wants to
destroy the institutions of government.
Rather, I am someone who feels that
Ross Perot is far superior to either
George Bush or Bill Clinton as a poten
tial president, and that is why I intend
to support him.
Mr. Perot's electronic town hall,
essentially a modern form of national
referendum which Mr. Richter derides in
his article, is used widely in Europe, par
ticularly in Switzerland and Denmark.
Has the level of political discourse
gotten so low on campus that anyone
with a new idea must be immediately
branded as an extremist or a loony?

Campbell's comments
condemned by scholar
Allow me to comment on the most
recent racist slurs by Mr. W. Glenn
Campbell, former director of the Hoover
Institution, who said it was too bad the
Croats did not completely exterminate
the inferior Serbs, so that the Croats
would have no trouble with them today.
As right before two previous World
Wars, a campaign of ridiculous lies is
orchestrated against the small Serbian
nation. Most of the American press con
tinues to regurgitate propaganda materi
al of the new Axis.
The Tito-created Yugoslav administra
tive units of Croatia and Slovenia are
represented as democratic states with
developed industry and economy, super
imposed against disorderly and barbaric
Serbs without culture and inferior in
every respect. While the photographs and
descriptions show Croats as clean-cut
and smart-looking, Serbs are portrayed
as dirty and primitive slivovitza drinkers.
It is in this context that one should
understand the racist ideology of Hoover
bigot Campbell (whose high opinion of
himself is no doubt based on his $143,000
salary), who finds it a matter of free
speech to tell his stories about culturally
and in any other way inferior Serbs.
He is intolerant of the free speech of
Dr. Trifkovic, a knowledgeable and elo
quent visiting British historian and jour
nalist, and cannot wait to see him leave.
One day soon we will hear of Mr. Camp
bell cynically explaining extermination of
Jews in gas chambers, as freedom of
expression.
I wonder whether Mr. Campbell
would exercise his freedom of speech a
little differently had a member of his
family been mutilated by Croat Ustashe
and their gouged eyes sent to Pavelich
for his novel collection.
There is no place for a racist and a Nazi
apologist even at. a highly conservative insti
tution like Hoover, let alone a respectable
university like Stanford. Firing Campbell

would be a small step in resisting forces of
evil and darkness and a giant step in cor
recting Hoover's tarnished reputation.
Let us hope that people like Dr.
Trifkovic will stay on and fight these
small minds of unlimited ignorance and
so aid troubled Serbia.

Anti-Arab racism leads
to defeat of OASIS fee
It was shocking to learn that the spe
cial fee request of the Organization of
Arab—American Students in Stanford
(OASIS) was defeated in the ASSU elec

centage of "no" votes.
This result does not appear to be due to
general resentment of students of color,
