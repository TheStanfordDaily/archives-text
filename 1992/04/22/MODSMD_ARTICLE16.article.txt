# Cory Booker
## A 						letter to blacks and to all 
### 
1 SECRETLY SMILED during my
sophomore year, when someone
scrawled NIGGER on a poster in Uja
maa. No, this is not a twisted perversion
of mine. I was genuinely hurt by the inci
dent and the perpetrators did incur my
rage. However, I still view this incident as
a good thing — at least for me.
You see, the echo of prejudice rings
loud in my memory —constantly being
reinforced. I have stories which I am cer
tain would shock many of you, but sadly,
for many others they would seem com
monplace.
What makes all of these incidents sig
nificant to me have been my coping mech
anisms. I have utilized many, from the
unproductive violent response to the self
defeating response Of denial and shame.
But the response I have used most often
has been, by far, the most powerful. I
choose to call it Fueling The Fire.
Every time I encounter prejudice it
imbues me with desire, not to kill the person
or people, but a desire to overcome. I have
never been victimized by prejudice. I have
been challenged. The constant battle to
meet that challenge through self-improve
ment has made me strong and proud.
So when the the Stanford black commu
nity united to meet their challenge I smiled.
When the strength of our community was
brandished with unrelenting pride I smiled.
When the entire campus rang with racial
dialogue I smiled. When I saw in the eyes of

my friends (white and black) an inflamed
desire to collectively overcome this injustice
I couldn't help but grin.
Funny, but I feel I can look into the
eyes of any racist and laugh because they
can't hurt me. I know someone out there
must think I'm naive — certainly tomor
row I could have my head caved in by
some skinhead or even could be over
looked for a promotion by some employ
er. But you know, I'm confident I will be
all right. Call it faith or stupidity, but I
know I'll be okay.
While I am very proud of these senti
ments of passion, strength and communi
ty, I have begun more and more to view
them as being frightfully self-absorbed.
It seems that the only race related issues
that really "Fuel My Fire" or "move im to
act vehemently are the ones which are
directly relate to me. Just let someone
say, "Cory, you're nothing but a damn
NIGGER!" and I'm ready to launch my
own civil rights movement.
Put simply, my imperatives are
skewed, my priorities are jumbled and
my vision is hampered by self-impor
tance. One in two black children is born
poor, 41 percent of black children do not
graduate from high-school and 25 per
cent of black males my age are involved in
the penal system (and they're not
judges).
These and other horrific facts should
by far be the most compelling racial

issues for me. Where is my passion? Here
I am running around on a beach, only
complaining about the hot sand when
behind me is an ocean of discontent in
which thousands of the disadvantaged
drown each day.
I don't mean to be dramatic, just logi
cal. Numerous sociologists and statisti
cians have documented a polarization
effect among blacks over the past 20
years. A small portion are moving to pre
viously unattained economic heights and
liberties, while the vast majority are slip
"ping backwards on almost all indicators.
The freedoms and opportunities I now
enjoy are unprecedented, and how I and
others like me choose to use these free
doms is a pivotal question. The answers
provided by thousands of Americans are
already profoundly shaping our country.
My Grandma told me of a truly great
woman. Her fortune and hard work led
her to newfound freedoms. Amidst the
options she possessed, she chose to focus
her passions toward helping others join
her in freedom.
God Bless Harriet Tubbman, may I
obtain her wisdom and courage.
