Making his first visit to a Stan
ford dormitory, incoming Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper
mingled with a group of about 50
Serra residents yesterday, eating
dinner and staying for about two
hours to lead an informal discus
sion on topics ranging from finan
cial aid to free speech on campus.
Many of the dorm's residents
treated Casper like a celebrity, ask
ing him to pose for snapshots and
trailing after him as he left, trying
to get in a few last questions.
"We could be really informal
with him," said freshman Mihir
Mankad, who was one of 10 resi
dents selected in a dorm lottery to
sit at Casper's table for dinner.
Casper was visiting Serra at the
invitation of freshman Nerissa
Wong, who sent him a letter shortly
after he was selected as president.
For the dinner, the dorm's
usual fare was made more palat

able by the strawberries, French
bread and pastries that were
served as appetizers at each table.
Casper said he accepted
Wong's invitation because he
wanted to determine the issues
concerning Stanford students —
a theme he returned to through
out the evening, telling students
at the dinner and the discussion
that as an outsider, he first has to
educate himself about Stanford
before he can attempt to create
new policies.
But he didn't get a chance to
ask many questions at dinner,
instead spending much of his
time answering those of people at
the table.
"They hardly let me eat my
dinner. They were terrible,"
Casper said, adding, "I had to sing
for my dinner tonight."
Mankad said he asked Casper
about his commitment to finan
cial aid and to athletics, and was

satisfied with the responses he
received to both questions.
Financial aid, Mankad said,
was "a major factor" in his deci
sion to come to Stanford, and he
had been worried by Casper's ear
lier statements questioning
whether need-blind admissions
could be continued. But at the
dinner, according to Mankad,
Casper said "he would always be
proneed blind admissions."

'They were all so
friendly, calling
themselves Casper.'

Other students said Casper
also expressed a commitment to
need-blind admissions and the
financial aid system at the infor
mal discussion, which followed
the dinner and was off the record.
Mankad, who plays tennis for
Stanford, said he asked whether
Casper would be as committed as
outgoing University President
Donald Kennedy had been to ath
letics, and Casper responded by
saying that "he definitely appreci
ated athletics, and had no plans of
increasing or decreasing it."
Another student who sat at
Casper's table, sophomore
Cameron Hamill, said she asked
about Casper's interest in under
graduate education.
The University of Chicago,
where Casper has taught for the
last 25 years, is primarily a grad
uate school, she said, but Casper
"was emphatic about the impor
tance of good teaching" at the
undergraduate level.
"I liked him," Hamill said. "I
felt like he was pretty comfortable
there and wanted to be mingling
with students."
Wong, too, was impressed by
Casper's performance, saying he
was "fairly warm and open" and
"not too stuffy."

After the dinner, Casper led
the discussion in the lounge,
which covered issues such as
political correctness, the value of
a liberal education and the danger
that tuition costs may become too
high and deter some from attend
ing private universities, according
to students who attended.
Casper said afterward that the
discussion was "very productive"
and he was impressed by the
"very clear and very varied posi
tions" students took on issues.
The most interesting part of
the discussion, he said, was "the
talk we had about the freedom to
speak your mind," in which he
encouraged students to describe
instances they had experienced at
Stanford in which they felt they
could not speak openly.
Assoc. Engineering Prof. Ross
Shachter, one of Serra's resident
fellows, said Casper "talked
directly and at length about polit
ical correctness and its role on
campus — the good and the bad."
The dorm's residents treated
Casper like a visiting dignitary,
gathering in the lounge to receive
him and wearing nametags that
identified each of them by their first
names and the last name "Casper."
Casper seemed puzzled when
he approached the first student to
shake his hand, repeating "I don't
believe this is true" and taking off
his glasses to examine the
nametag more closely.
He was embarrassed when he
realized that everyone's last name
appeared to be the same as his.
"They were all so friendly, calling
themselves Casper," he said later,
laughing.
As he entered the dorm, Casper
shook hands with each resident
and exchanged a few words of
German with one student.
After the discussion, the dorm
presented Casper with a "Super
Serran" award, a Stanford cap
and a Stanford mug filled with
Hershey's kisses.
Casper, who arrived at Stan
ford Monday to meet with vice
presidents and deans, is return
ing to Chicago today.
