Making his first visit to a Stan
ford dormitory, incoming Univer

mingled with a group of about 50
Serra residents yesterday, eating
dinner and staying for about two

For the dinner, the dorm's
usual fare was made more palat

bread and pastries that were
served as appetizers at each table.
Casper said he accepted
Wong's invitation because he
wanted to determine the issues
concerning Stanford students —

that as an outsider, he first has to
educate himself about Stanford
before he can attempt to create
new policies.
But he didn't get a chance to
ask many questions at dinner,
instead spending much of his
time answering those of people at
the table.
"They hardly let me eat my
dinner. They were terrible,"
Casper said, adding, "I had to sing
for my dinner tonight."
Mankad said he asked Casper
about his commitment to finan
cial aid and to athletics, and was
