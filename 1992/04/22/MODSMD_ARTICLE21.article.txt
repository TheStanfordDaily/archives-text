Jeffrey Koseff admires the clam for something seem
ingly more mundane: its voracious appetite for algae.
In an unusual pairing of civil engineers with biolo
gists, Koseff, Civil Engineering Prof. Stephen Moni
smith, and graduate student Catherine O'Riordan,
together with a team of oceanographers at the U.S.
Geological Survey, are studying the digestive capabili
ties of 200 mechanical clams. The artificial colony is
intended to mimic many features of clams living in the
San Francisco Bay, including environmental factors
such as tidal flows.
By studying the mechanical mollusks in this dynam
ic environment, the researchers hope to provide more
accurate data to support the theory that the clams liv
ing in the south part of the Bay are a primary force in
controlling the levels of algae.
Researchers suspect clams can eat algae faster than
any other animal, Koseff explained.
Since algae forms the base of the food chain, "if the
clams control the amount of phytoplankton consumed,
they control how much food is available," Koseff said.
Because fish, rays and other marine life in the Bay
feed on the clams, the size of the clam population
effects the population levels of other organisms.
The mechanical clams are designed to exhibit the
two primary functions of a clam's digestive system:
siphoning phytoplankton-rich water into the body, and
expelling food-depleted water out.
The clam model incorporates two plastic tubes of
differing diameters, each hooked up to a pump. It uses
the larger tube to suck water in, and the smaller one to

push water out.
The team is investigating where the phytoplankton
depleted water goes and how quickly it mixes with
ambient water under various physical conditions. The
results will help pin down mathematically the efficien
cy of the clam population as a whole in taking food out
of the amount of water sitting above the bed, or the
water column.
Quantitative evaluations are valuable for policy
makers making planning decisions, and this research
will help to "put a number on how important the clams
are," Koseff said.
"There's someone sitting in Sacramento deciding
how much water is enough for San Francisco Bay and
how much can be diverted," Koseff said. "A computer
based model would help."
He quickly added, "We're still a long way from that."
Through initial observations, the researchers have
already found an explanation for why clams raise and
lower their siphons. The mechanical clams can access

50 percent more food when their siphons are
raised, but maintaining this position is
dangerous since a fish can come

along and bite them off.
The researchers also dis
covered why clams ori
ent their siphons

perpendicu
lar to
the

water flow. By using orange dye to track the path of
water through the clam colony, the researchers have
discovered that an individual clam would ingest a lot of
its own excurrent if the siphon that sucked water in
were upstream of the siphon that spit water out. By sit
ting perpendicular to the flow, the clams can avoid hav
ing to reorient themselves when the tidal flow reverses.
Clams packed tightly in a bed will inevitably ingest
each other's excurrent, but directional shifts in the
tidal current change the location of the nutritious
water. Still, the clams on the outside rims of beds con
sistently get the best water, explaining why they are
bigger than those in the middle.
The specific results of the research are not the

only things that make this project special.

The interdisciplinary compo
sition of the
research

team signals a type of research approach, KosefT said.
"The essence is to see the connection between the
physical — the water and tidal flow — and the biological
— the entities that live within the system," he explained.
"If vou want to come up with solutions and policies,

ii JUU TTCUit \AJ WUIV Up
you can't do the two in isolation." He
added that "once we understand

the connection, we can
incorporate it

mathemati
cally."
