# Hold the hairspray, turn off the computer

Ah, Earth Day! For some, it is
a day on which messages of earth
ly preservation, the Green move
ment and the adoration of nature
are to be sung. Earth Day can be
a day of unity, when we all agree
that the world is a beautiful place
that we should actively work to
preserve. But, for even more,
Earth Day might be a day for us
to look, perhaps a little guiltily, at
our own efforts to keep Mother
Earth in shape.
Despite our sincere beliefs that
we at Stanford are truly attuned
to environmental concerns, some
of our actions show that we need
a few reminders here and there.
Take, for instance, the bath
room: warm showers are great,
but if everyone takes one for 15
minutes, they add up to a lot of
excess water down the drain. Lit
tle things add up: we often use
paper towels instead of cloth; run
the water while brushing our
teeth; and ignore the politically
correct toilet etiquette rule that
everyone pretends to forget: "If

it's yellow, let it me110w..."
Hairspray. We all know that
aerosol hairsprays are a huge no
no, but did you know that pump
sprays cause pollution, too? Nine
ty-five percent of pump spray
solution is composed of VOC's
(volatile organic compounds),
which are lost to the atmosphere
and contribute to smog.
Switches. Leaving the stereo,
computer, radio and lights on all
day when no one is home is not
only useless, but completely
wasteful of energy.
Gating. In our dining habits,
most of us are environmental
nightmares. We choose paper
cups instead of glasses, and plas
tic utensils instead of silverware.
Napkins are grabbed by the
handfuls, which is handy if we
happen to know we're going to
spill our food all over the place,
but in general, one or two would
suffice.
Automobiles. Changing our
habits can make a difference. For
example, we should probably give
up driving to our P.O. boxes.
(And while we're at it, recycling the
inevitable letter from Tom Camp
bell is a good idea.) Another small
concession is to avoid the drive
through at fast food chains. While
a car idles, it gets zero miles to the
gallon, but still pollutes the air.
Activism. If you want to con
tribute on a larger scale, the cam

pus presents many opportunities
to do so. Mike Cohen, coordinator
of Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford, suggests get
ting involved in his organization,
which meets Mondays at 9 p.m., on
the second floor of Tresidder.
SEAS organizes beach clean ups,
teaches environmental education
in East Palo Alto classrooms and
holds letter-writing campaigns to
various public figures to voice
their concern for the environment.
The Stanford Recycling Center
also offers opportunities for

hands-on activism. In addition,
the Haas Center for Public Service
has information on internships
and organizations dealing with
the environment, and every year,
at least one of the Alternative
Spring Break programs they run
is devoted to the environment.
Every day is Earth Day
because opportunities are always
present for us to improve our
world, but to do so we must start
with the little things like recy
cling this paper when you're done
with it.
