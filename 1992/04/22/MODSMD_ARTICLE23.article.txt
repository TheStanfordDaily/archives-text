# EARTH DAY

On Earth Day 1992, The Daily takes a look at Stan
ford's role in the science of saving the planet.
Environmental research at Stanford comes in
many guises: from Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich's
work to curtail the soaring population growth rate
of humans, to Biology Prot. Dennis Murphy's
efforts to rescue endangered animals; from Civil

Engineering Prof. Jeffrey Koseff's research on
San Francisco Bay marine food chains, to the gas
saving designs of the Stanford Solar Car Project
team.
Non-scientists also play a role in Stanford's envi
ronmental efforts, whether it's simply trading hair
spray for gel, or recycling glass, cans and paper.
