# Biologists preserve diversity
## Center for Conservation Biology targets rare species 
### Lydia Lee Staff writer 
The office on the fourth floor of Herrin
Laboratories, Department of Biological Sci
ences, is filled with tree-high stacks of
books, papers and specimen cases. The
makeshift shelves are made from wood
planks that rest on jars of soil samples. A
large butterfly net drapes one corner, and
there is a large poster, "British Butter
flies," on the wall.
This is the habitat of conservation biolo
gist Dennis Murphy. He and Biology Prof.
Paul Ehrlich founded the Center for Con
servation Biology in 1984, to "help stem
the accelerating loss of biological diversi
ty," according to the Center's information
al pamphlet.
It is estimated that by the year 2100,
more than half of the remaining rainforest
and nearly a tenth of all species will be
extinct. The accelerating loss is not only
aesthetic, but involves the potential loss of
resources for better crops, drugs and other
products.
"This is the biggest challenge humanity
is facing — dealing with its own impact on
the environment," Murphy said.
He emphasized that conservation biolo
gy is a science with practical applications.
It utilizes principles of population biology
and ecology for the management of popula
tions and ecosystems.
The Center specializes in providing
technical guidance for land development,
helping to create public policy that is sensi
tive to the impact on biodiversity.
The Center has also worked to preserve
a number of endangered species, including
the monarch butterfly, the Northern spot
ted owl and the Bay Checkerspot butterfly.
This last species is found in the native Cal
ifornian grasslands of Stanford's Jasper
Ridge Nature Preserve.
Although Center biologists seek out the
Bay Checkerspot butterfly and monitor the
size of the small, fluctuating population
carefully, other rare species flock to campus
on their own. Earlier this month, the rare
tiger salamander was spotted after a 17-
year hiatus, crawling across the intersec
tion of Junipero Serra and Campus Drive.

Now a half a dozen tiger salamander
juveniles glide about in a fish tank in the
room across from Murphy's office. Larvae
of this species currently swim in Lake
Lagunita.
The Center is working with the Plan
ning and Management Department on a
number of protecting measures, including
postponing the draining of the lake past
mid-summer, so the larvae will be able to
grow to maturity and survive on land.
Also in conjunction with the Planning
Department, the Center has recreated
marsh and vernal pond ecosystems on cam
pus. "Memorial Marsh," near the Business
School, supports a population of birds and
holds runoff water from winter rains.
This dual purpose is also served by the
creation of vernal pools — small, seasonal
ponds, which are vital for the existence of
certain species of wildflowers. These pools,
located off Palm Drive, help maintain bio
diversity and have also saved Stanford as
much as $2 million by taking the place of
larger storm sewers.
The Center has international as well as
local roots. Its Costa Rican field station is
on Amistad Biosphere Reserve, a nearly
two million acres large reserve that con
tains a wide diversity of plant and animal
species.
The goal of this tropical conservation
program, said Murphy, is to "reserve areas,
to sequester them from the assails of
humanity, and to monitor organisms." The
scientists there are currently keeping track
of the populations of birds and butterflies
— two distinct, well-known groups.
"If one species disappears," Murphy
said, "we can infer there has been a certain
environmental change, and then manage
for that change accordingly."
Murphy, who wrote his Ph.D disserta
tion at Stanford on "Adult Resource Use by
Butterflies," said his interest in conserva
tion biology was ignited when the areas he
had been studying underwent develop
ment. "I saw the populations I had worked
so hard to study disappear."
Murphy is a champion of the Endan
gered Species Act. "It is likely to be the bio
diversity legislation with real teeth for
decades to come," he said.
