# Ehrlich calls for more bird watching
## Bio prof warns against ecological disasters from oil spills to global warming 
### Janar Stewart Editorial staff 
Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich, the pro
lific ecologist whose doomsday scenarios
have caused great controversy in the sci
entific community, discussed his latest
writings Monday, continuing to outline
potential ecological disasters.
On Monday, Ehrlich presented his
latest book "Birds in Jeopardy" at the
Stanford Bookstore. Ehrlich said his
book "is a way for people to understand
what's happening to the world around
them by watching the birds."
Ehrlich has paid special attention to
the spotted owl of the Northwest,
including working through the Stanford
Center for Conservation Biology to
replenish their numbers.
With a casual demeanor, Ehrlich
spoke about pressing environmental
concerns, from oil spills to global warm
ing, and fielded questions from the audi
ence. To the question of how much
longer Homo sapiens can hope to sur
vive as a species, Ehrlich replied: "If you
are talking about the lifestyles led by
Americans, about 50 years."
According to Ehrlich, the rapid
growth of the earth's population leads
to increased development. The develop
ment in turn creates additional environ
mental problems that damage the earth
— such as global warming and the
greenhouse effect — and maj r cause
irreversible ruin.
Attempts at modernization by newly
industrialized countries contribute to
the dilemma by increasing levels of pol
lutants in the atmosphere. Deforesta
tion, which dramatically alters ecosys
tems and causes many species of ani
mals to become extinct, is another nega
tive result of this modernization,
according to Ehrlich.

'If you are talking about
about the lifestyles led by
Americans, [Homo sapi
ens can hope to survive as
a species] about 50
years.'
— Prof. Paul Ehrlich

Ehrlich believes much of this damage
can be circumvented by educating peo
ple — particularly in rapidly moderniz
ing underdeveloped regions of the world
— about sustainable development and
industrialization that doesn't destroy
natural resources. e \
Some in the audience asked what
more environmentalists could do to
publicize critical ecological problems.
Ehrlich pointed out that the advertising
campaigns of large businesses, such as
oil companies, portray the businesses as
conscientious — and that these corpora
tions have much larger budgets than

most environmental groups.
This competition, he said, makes it
difficult for environmentalists to reach
people. "The environmental movement
is rich in people but poor in dollars,"
Ehrlich added.
Currently, the Center for Conserva
tion Biology is creating designs for
nature reserves in the rainforests of
Costa Rica.
The Center also has operations in
Madagascar, Guatemala, Ecuador and
several locations across the United
States. Ehrlich said the main project at
the overseas branches is finding ways
"to conserve tropical diversity."
For Earth Day, Ehrlich plans to lec
ture at the Academy of Natural Sciences
in Philadelphia.
Ehrlich, most famous for his 1968
book, "The Population Bomb," and its
sequel, "The Population Explosion,"
has received many prestigious awards
and honors, including the 1990
MacArthur'Fellowship, worth $345,000
in unrestricted grant money.
He used part of the funds to help buy
several acres of the Uruguai Provincial
Park, a tropical rain forest in Argentina.
Later that year, Ehrlich was awarded
the Crafoord Prize, the conservation
ists' equivalent of a Nobel Prize.
Ehrlich has long been an advocate of

'The environmental
movement is rich in
people but poor in dol
lars.'
— Prof. Paul Ehrlich

slowing the world's consumption of nat
ural resources, favoring the reduction of
consumption in developed countries and
the carefully monitoring of industrial
ization in poor countries.
Ehrlich has also concentrated on
population. The Earth's human popula
tion is currently 5.2 billion and is
increasing by 90 million per year.
The problem of overpopulation stems
in part from a situation in which devel
oped countries export technology that
prevents death in infancy and prolongs
life expectancy, but do not export birth
control technology, according to
Ehrlich. As a result, people in develop
ing countries are living longer, but still
have the very large families that were
necessary when most children died
young.

Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich promotes his new book at the Stanford Bookstore. He
has departed from his earlier research on the human population explosion to
focus on birds.
