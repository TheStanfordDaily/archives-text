# Scary mosquito just a fly
## Crane flies don't bite, may not eat at all Science Bug 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
I'm holding in front of me an
11 insect that resembles a really gar-
mosquito. One of my
insists that that's what it is,
and another says that it is a "mosquito
hawk" that actually eats mosquitos.
Which is it?
— Tom O 'Hawk
A: Tom, you've got your hands on a
representative of the insect family
Tipulidae — known in the vernac
ular as a crane fly.
Despite the crane fly's seeming übiq
uity around these parts this time of year,
you — as well as the mosquitos of the
Bay Area — can sleep easy. Crane flies
neither drink mammalian blood nor prey
upon the annoying parasites with which
most of us are all too familiar.
To tell you the Bug's honest truth,
Tom, it is unknown to human science
just what crane flies do eat. Some species
are alleged to sip nectar from flowers,
although this has yet to be convincingly
demonstrated.
In fact, some adult crane flies may not
feed at all. Some entomologists have sug
gested that these flies subscribe to a
strategy seen elsewhere in the insect
class: the larvae are specialized eating
machines, storing up energy for the com
ing metamorphosis, while the adults do
nothing during the remainder of their
lives besides mate, lay eggs and flutter
uselessly around light bulbs. Intriguing
as this conjecture may be, however, it has
not yet been tested.
If you're really concerned about the
danger these insects pose to humanity, I
advise you to direct your attention to the
crane fly's voracious larvae. The young of
the most common genus in the family
feed on plant roots, and can be serious
pests wherever cereal crops are grown.
Once in a great while, I admit that
I'm wrong. Last week's column
provides me with an opportunity
to do so.
In a nutshell, I claimed in that article
that a person weighs more at sea level
than at the top of Mount Everest for two
reasons. First, the farther from the cen
ter of the earth you go, the lighter you
are. Second, the column of air sitting on
top of you is heavier at lower elevations.
The first part is true, but the air column
argument is completely bogus.
One factor that I should have consid
ered (but didn't) is buoyancy. As one kind
reader reminded me, a body wholly
immersed in a fluid is buoyed up by a
force equal to the weight of the fluid dis
placed. Since air is denser closer to sea
level, the buoyant force is larger at lower
altitudes.
You have probably noticed that the
gravitational factor and the buoyancy fac
tor work in opposite directions. Gravita
tional considerations predict that one

would weigh more at sea level, while buoy
ancy predicts that one would weigh more
at high altitudes. So, which one wins?
In this matter, I bow to the calcula
tions of Dr. Neil Schafer, a postdoctoral
scholar in the laboratory of Chemistry
Prof. Richard Zare. (Prof. Zare, kind soul,
was the first reader to bring my attention
to the egregious error in last week's col
umn.)
Dr. Schafer informed me that the grav
itational correction for a 300-pound
object (such as the ovarian cyst I used as
an example) would amount to a decrease
of 0.83 pounds as one went from Half
Moon Bay to the pinnacle of Mount Ever
est. The buoyant force on Everest is 0.2
pounds smaller than at sea level, though,
so the weight decrease is down to 0.63
pounds when you take buoyancy into
account.
But wait — there's more. Because the
earth is not a perfect sphere, but rather
bulges at the equator, the gravitational
constant varies with latitude. This is an
extension of the argument I made last
week: the closer you are to the center of
the earth (as you would be, due to this
bulging effect, at the North Pole compared
to the Equator), the heavier you are.
Dr. Schafer's result on the matter? As
Everest is 10 degrees closer to the equator
than Half Moon Bay, you are 0.24 pounds
lighter when you're freezing atop the
mountain than when you're sunning on
the beach.
When we add it all up, we obtain a net
decrease in weight of 0.87 pounds at the
higher elevation.
Not a great way to lose weight, it turns
out. If it makes you feel any better,
though, it sure did make me lose a lot of
sleep.

Many thanks to everyone who took the
time to write or call with contributions to
this week's correction. Leave questions in

main entrance on the west side of Storke
Publications Building.
