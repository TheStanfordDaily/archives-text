# Sun is fossil fuel alternative for Solar Car Project
## 
### Markley Bavinger 
The Stanford students spending
thousands of hours building a two
horsepower solar car say they are try
ing to make a point. In graduate engi
neering student Mark Scheeff's
words, "Transportation does not have
to rely on fossil fuel.
"There are alternatives. Vehicles
can be different, and their effect on
the environment does not have to be
what it is."
Begun in 1989 by a small group of
Stanford undergraduates, including
current coordinators Scheeff and Alex
Tilson, members of the Solar Car Pro
ject have been working to demonstrate
alternatives to the modern automo
bile. Since then, the group has devel

oped a membership list of 40 Stanford
students and has participated in more
than 15 high-profile events.
Solar cars are the extreme example
of environmentally sound vehicles. A
solar car produces absolutely no emis
sions and is completely self-sufficient,
with the sun serving as the only
source to charge the car's battery. As
Scheeff said, "We just have to park the
car outside to fill up the gas tank."
Unfortunately, solar cars that rely
completely on energy from the sun
will probably never replace the auto
mobile. According to Charles Nickel,
the solar cells and electrical systems
expert of the project, "Such a car is
not realistic. People who are dreamers
or people who don't know much about
solar cells may think this will happen

some day, but I don't think it will."
Nickel bases his statement on the
fact that the limited surface area and
large energy requirements of a car
make it impossible to capture suffi
cient sunlight to power it. Even the
most efficient solar cells can generate
only three horsepower. This is approx
imately one-fifth of the power
required for a standard-sized automo
bile to travel at 15 miles per hour.
Because of such limitations, it is
more likely that solar cells will be used
as a supplementary energy source to
help re-charge the battery.
The reason the Stanford solar car is
able to perform is that it weighs
approximately 400 pounds and
requires only 2 horsepower. It is also
built using cutting-edge technology.

Materials used in its construction are
the same as those used in space satel
lites, and innovative ideas, such as the
unique process of solar cell lamination
being researched by Nickel, have been
put into practice.
Their light weight makes solar cars
efficient but fragile. "Solar cars are
built to perform in races. Sending
them out as highway vehicles can be
done, but it is not safe. It's crazy,"
said project member Keith Harrison.
In 1990, project members did test
drive their first car, the SUnSUrfer,
on a Los Angeles freeway and clocked
it at 62 mph. It has since been retired
to make room for construction of the
second model, the Stanford Sunburn
er, which is expected to reach speeds
well over those of the first.
The Stanford Sunburner will com
pete in its first race in November 1993
at the World Solar Challenge in Aus
tralia. The race is the "Super Bowl" of
solar car racing, Scheeff said.
The Stanford team will compete
against other universities and corpo
rations, but unfortunately, the
prospects of a blue ribbon are slim.
The Stanford group, which expects to
spend a total of $150,000, will face
large corporations like General
Motors, which have budgets exceeding
$2 million.
But the Stanford car's chances will
be better in Sunrayce 93, the Depart
ment of Energy's 1000-mile solar car
race to be held June 20-26, 1993. At
the race, more than 30 teams from
North American colleges and universi
ties will travel from Dallas to outside
Minneapolis.
On the local level, the group
intends to have more exhibitions in
accordance with their goal to educate
the public. Members of the Solar Car
Project will begin taking the Sunburn
er out on the town, starting with a
drive through campus in early May.
There will also be an exhibition in
White Plaza May 9.
The Stanford community gave the
Solar Car Project an impressive boost
in this year's general election by sup
porting the group's fee request. Under
such campaign slogans as "Remem
ber: the sun's not just for tanning
anymore" and "Just say 'NO' to Stone
Age Technology," the project secured
enough votes to garner $37,250 in
funding from the students.
