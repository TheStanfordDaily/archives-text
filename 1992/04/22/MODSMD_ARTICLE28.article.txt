Hum Bio for teenagers
Stanford's Middle Grades Life Science Pro
ject, which recently received a $2.6 million grant
from the National Science Foundation,
is developing a non-traditional middle-school cur
riculum that targets the special needs and inter
ests of adolescents.
Middle school is a time when students often
become alienated from science, but this is also
the time when knowledge of their bodies could
help them understand the physical, emotional
and social changes they are experiencing, and
make informed decisions about such high-risk
behaviors as substance abuse and unprotected
sex.
Stanford's curriculum integrates the techni
cal aspects of science with issues like drug abuse,
teen pregnancy and AIDS, and present it in a way
that emphasizes the role of science in an adoles
cent's life.
When students study the heart and circula
tion, they learn more than the names of the blood
vessels or how blood flows through the heart.
Instead, they learn how to monitor vital signs
and decrease the risk of developing cardiovascu
lar disease through proper diet and exercise.
Fifteen middle schools across the nation —
many in minority and poor communities — have
used the Stanford curriculum for a semester.
Mary Kiely, associate director of the project with
in Stanford's Human Biology Program, and
other educators will visit the test sites this spring
to assess the initial effectiveness of the program.
The middle-school approach was modeled
after the college-level Human Biology Program
established at Stanford in 1970 by Carnegie Cor
poration President David Hamburg, University
President Donald Kennedy and several Stanford
professors.
Stanford prof builds yachts
American yachts competing in future Ameri
ca's Cup will be significantly faster than before
— and not because of better seamanship.
For the first time some yachts in the 28th
America's Cup race will be made of composite
materials, which make the vessels 25 percent
faster.
Stephen Tsai, a Stanford professor of aero
nautics and astronautics, was called to choose
the composites that four of the American yachts
will be made of.
Composites are graphite fibers embedded in a
resinous matrix that solidifies when heated.
Yachts made from composites are 10 feet
longer, 33 percent lighter and have 50 percent
more sail area than the traditional 12-meter class
boats used in Cup racing between 1958 and 1987.
