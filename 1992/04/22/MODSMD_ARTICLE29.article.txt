## Card powers way to SJSU win Olmstead sparks club with game-winning longball 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Last night, the superstars moved
over and gave the spotlight to a couple
of guys who may be a big part of Stan
ford baseball's future. In a nail-biter,
the Cardinal defeated the San Jose
State Spartans 5-4 thanks largely to

Baseball

Cardinal 5
Spartans 4

the performances of freshman Matt
Marenghi and sophomore Nate Olm
stead.
The game avenged a loss to the
Spartans earlier in the year when a
ninth inning SJSU homer snatched
defeat from the jaws of victory for the
Cardinal.
However, Stanford wasn't hoping
to get back at the Spartans with long
balls of their own — only one home
run had been given up by the Spartans
at their Municipal Stadium this year.
Well, make that four.
Chris Kemper and Steve Solomon
both had homers and doubles, and

both came at opportune moments.
Down 3-1 in the top of the fifth with
one out, Solomon's solo shot, his sixth
of the year, narrowed the margin to
one run.
And up by one run, Kemper's solo
shot in the eighth gave the Cardinal
the insurance run that it would in fact
need. But as far as offense goes, the
night belonged to Olmstead.
For the game, Olmstead had two
hits, the biggest of these coming in the
top of the sixth. Down 3-2, the desig
nated hitter nailed a two run shot off
Spartan Rob Andrakin which gave the
Cardinal a 4-3 lead that would not be
relinquished.
"I've been hitting really well [late
ly]," Olmstead said. "My last at-bats
on Varsity and JV have been the best
of my career."
Olmstead, a switch-hitter, had a hit
from both the left and right sides of
the plate. Thought a natural
righthander, the home run came from
the left side against the righthander
Andrakin.
"I felt real comfortable from both
sides of the plate," Olmstead said.
From the mound, Marenghi was
nearly as impressive. After taking over
for starter Brian Sackinsky in the top
of the fourth, the freshman
righthander began a little shaky,

allowing two runs (one earned) in the
inning.
However, after settling down,
Marenghi worked four innings, strik
ing out six to record the first win of his
collegiate career.

Tve been hitting real
ly well [lately] . . . My
last at-bats on Varsity
and JV have been the
best of my career.'
— Nate Olmstead

"[Marenghi] had great command
[last night]," Olmstead said. "He's
been pitching real well his last three
outings."
Tim Moore followed, pitching the
eighth, and looked very good, striking
out two. However, after giving up a
leadoff home run in the bottom of the
ninth, Moore was relieved by Aaron
Dorlarque, who went one-two-three
with two K's to record his ninth save.

Peek-a-boo! While lefthander Andrew Lorraine and the rest of the Stanford pitching
staff have been carrying the squad lately, it was power that led the Cardinal to last
night's 5-4 win.
Defensively, Stanford's perfor
mance looked even worse than
the three error fiasco against
Southern Cal.
In fact, the Cardinal looked
twice as bad as it committed a sea
son-high six errors in the game,
leading to two of the Spartan
runs. The win put Stanford at 27-
16, while the Spartans, no slouch
es themselves, dropped to 27-16-1.
The San Jose State game was a
warmup for Stanford's crucial series
with the University of Arizona this
weekend
The No. 13 Wildcats (25-16-1
overall, 11-8 in conference play)
lead the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division by a game. The
Cardinal and No. 11 Arizona State
are tied for second in the Six-Pac
with 11-10 marks.
Card Notes
In the game, Jeffrey Hammonds' 11-
game hitting steak was broken after
his 0-3 night. . .with the save, Dorlar
que's 11 career saves moves him into
fifth place in the all-time Cardinal

record book, one behind Jeff Ballard at
fourth. Spartan Kraig Constantino,
who hit the Cardinal killing grand
slam Feb. 18, took the hat trick, strik
ing out three times.

leadoff home run in the bottom of the
ninth, Moore was relieved by Aaron
Dorlarque, who went one-two-three
with two K's to record his ninth save.

Peek-a-boo! While lefthander Andrew Lorraine and the rest of the Stanford pitching
staff have been carrying the squad lately, it was power that led the Cardinal to last
night's 5-4 win.
Defensively, Stanford's perfor
mance looked even worse than
the three error fiasco against
Southern Cal.
In fact, the Cardinal looked
twice as bad as it committed a sea
son-high six errors in the game,
leading to two of the Spartan
runs. The win put Stanford at 27-
16, while the Spartans, no slouch
es themselves, dropped to 27-16-1.
The San Jose State game was a
warmup for Stanford's crucial series
with the University of Arizona this
weekend
The No. 13 Wildcats (25-16-1
overall, 11-8 in conference play)
lead the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division by a game. The
Cardinal and No. 11 Arizona State
are tied for second in the Six-Pac
with 11-10 marks.
Card Notes
In the game, Jeffrey Hammonds' 11-
game hitting steak was broken after
his 0-3 night. . .with the save, Dorlar
que's 11 career saves moves him into
fifth place in the all-time Cardinal

record book, one behind Jeff Ballard at
fourth. Spartan Kraig Constantino,
who hit the Cardinal killing grand
slam Feb. 18, took the hat trick, strik
ing out three times.

Last night, the superstars moved
over and gave the spotlight to a couple
of guys who may be a big part of Stan
ford baseball's future. In a nail-biter,
the Cardinal defeated the San Jose
State Spartans 5-4 thanks largely to

Baseball

Cardinal 5
Spartans 4

the performances of freshman Matt
Marenghi and sophomore Nate Olm
stead.
The game avenged a loss to the
Spartans earlier in the year when a
ninth inning SJSU homer snatched
defeat from the jaws of victory for the
Cardinal.
However, Stanford wasn't hoping
to get back at the Spartans with long
balls of their own — only one home
run had been given up by the Spartans
at their Municipal Stadium this year.
Well, make that four.
Chris Kemper and Steve Solomon
both had homers and doubles, and

both came at opportune moments.
Down 3-1 in the top of the fifth with
one out, Solomon's solo shot, his sixth
of the year, narrowed the margin to
one run.
And up by one run, Kemper's solo
shot in the eighth gave the Cardinal
the insurance run that it would in fact
need. But as far as offense goes, the
night belonged to Olmstead.
For the game, Olmstead had two
hits, the biggest of these coming in the
top of the sixth. Down 3-2, the desig
nated hitter nailed a two run shot off
Spartan Rob Andrakin which gave the
Cardinal a 4-3 lead that would not be
relinquished.
"I've been hitting really well [late
ly]," Olmstead said. "My last at-bats
on Varsity and JV have been the best
of my career."
Olmstead, a switch-hitter, had a hit
from both the left and right sides of
the plate. Thought a natural
righthander, the home run came from
the left side against the righthander
Andrakin.
"I felt real comfortable from both
sides of the plate," Olmstead said.
From the mound, Marenghi was
nearly as impressive. After taking over
for starter Brian Sackinsky in the top
of the fourth, the freshman
righthander began a little shaky,

allowing two runs (one earned) in the
inning.
However, after settling down,
Marenghi worked four innings, strik
ing out six to record the first win of his
collegiate career.

Tve been hitting real
ly well [lately] . . . My
last at-bats on Varsity
and JV have been the
best of my career.'
— Nate Olmstead

"[Marenghi] had great command
[last night]," Olmstead said. "He's
been pitching real well his last three
outings."
Tim Moore followed, pitching the
eighth, and looked very good, striking
out two. However, after giving up a
leadoff home run in the bottom of the
ninth, Moore was relieved by Aaron
Dorlarque, who went one-two-three
with two K's to record his ninth save.
