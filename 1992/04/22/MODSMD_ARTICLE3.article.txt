# Without COP, senate will have to pick up slack
## Student link with administration threatened 
### Andy Dworkin Julie Makinen Staff writers 
Life without a Council of Presidents
may be easy for Stanford voters to imagine,
but student leaders and University officials
say they will have to reforge student
administration relationships and restruc
ture the ASSU Senate next year.
Last week, students voted in the"I Pre
fer Not to Have a COP" slate and effective
ly abolished the ASSU's executive body,
which has traditionally served as a link

between students and the University on
such issues as race relations, budget cuts
and financial aid.
Dean of Students Michael Jackson said
he works "fairly regularly" with the COP
and has "a good bit of contact" with the
elected leadership.
He said the COP makes sure the ASSU
assets are properly managed and has
helped his office get student input on Uni
versity policies.
"I think [the COP) is an important func
tion that, when effective, helps to represent
student input fairly well," Jackson said. But

he added that students
may be poorly informed
about the extent of the
COP's work.
"People don't have
as broad a picture as
might be needed to
understand the ins and
outs of how effective
student government
works," he said.
University President

Donald Kennedy has also met regularly
with the COP to discuss topics of their
choice. Most recently, the conversations
have focused on budget cuts, he said.

"Obviously, [the dissolution of the COP]
won't represent the end of communication"
between students and the administration,
Kennedy said. He added that the University
president meets with the senate regularly
and that University committees receive stu
dent representatives through the ASSU
Nominations Commission.
"We'll find a way to communicate
because we have to," Kennedy said.
Incoming senator Anoop Prakash said
he expects the senate to form several com
mittees to fill the role of the COP, possibly
including a presidential liaison committee
