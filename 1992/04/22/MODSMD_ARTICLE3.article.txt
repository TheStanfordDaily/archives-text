# Without COP, senate will have to pick up slack
## Student link with administration threatened 
### Andy Dworkin Julie Makinen Staff writers 
Life without a Council of Presidents
may be easy for Stanford voters to imagine,
but student leaders and University officials
say they will have to reforge student
administration relationships and restruc
ture the ASSU Senate next year.
Last week, students voted in the"I Pre
fer Not to Have a COP" slate and effective
ly abolished the ASSU's executive body,
which has traditionally served as a link

between students and the University on
such issues as race relations, budget cuts
and financial aid.
Dean of Students Michael Jackson said
he works "fairly regularly" with the COP
and has "a good bit of contact" with the
elected leadership.
He said the COP makes sure the ASSU
assets are properly managed and has
helped his office get student input on Uni
versity policies.
"I think [the COP) is an important func
tion that, when effective, helps to represent
student input fairly well," Jackson said. But

he added that students
may be poorly informed
about the extent of the
COP's work.
"People don't have
as broad a picture as
might be needed to
understand the ins and
outs of how effective
student government
works," he said.
University President

Donald Kennedy has also met regularly
with the COP to discuss topics of their
choice. Most recently, the conversations
have focused on budget cuts, he said.

"Obviously, [the dissolution of the COP]
won't represent the end of communication"
between students and the administration,
Kennedy said. He added that the University
president meets with the senate regularly
and that University committees receive stu
dent representatives through the ASSU
Nominations Commission.
"We'll find a way to communicate
because we have to," Kennedy said.
Incoming senator Anoop Prakash said
he expects the senate to form several com
mittees to fill the role of the COP, possibly
including a presidential liaison committee


Jackson
and a student input committee.
"Especially with a new presi
dent coming in, it will be impor
tant to spend time with him,"
Prakash said. "We will have to see
if many senators will want to put
in the time to cover the COP's
responsibilities.
"If I were (incoming Universi
ty President Gerhard) Casper, I'd
be pretty happy knowing that I
could come in and do whatever I
want and the students will just
argue about it," said Prakash.
"Without a COP, he may have no
one to answer to unless the sen
ate can get together and act
immediately."
Without a COP, Jackson said,
his office would work directly
with the Nominations Commit
tee to get students on University
committees and with individual
senators to gauge student opin
ion.
"We'll try to find a fair way of
getting student input," said Jack
son. There is still a need for "a
good set of people that adminis
trators and faculty can look to"
for student views, he said.
While many campaign promis
es of recent COP slates — such
as allowing meal cards to be used
at Tresidder and creating a 24-
hour study hall — have gone
unfulfilled, others have come to
life.
For example, Lecture Notes,
the Airport Shuttle, the Pocket
Discount Card, the linen ser
vice, the annual Leadership
Summit and the placement of
change and condom machines
have all been previous COP ini
tiatives.
According to Vince Ricci, chair
of Financial Aid Advocacy Office,
the COP gave his office "direct
input" on what University com
mittees were talking about. For
example, current COP members
told Ricci about the tuition
increase "right as it happened,"
he said.
COP members serve on many
University committees, including
the University Committee on
Minority Issues, the Tresidder
Union Board, the Faculty Senate
and various search committees
for new administrators.
Ricci said "it will be a chal

lenge" to stay in touch with Uni
versity officials without a COP.
But his office will work to get
input more directly, he said, by
trying to place representatives on
committees, such as the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aid.
"It's do-able, for sure, if we get
strong people in the ASSU," Ricci
said.
Without a COP, many respon
sibilities will fall to the ASSU sen-

ators, the senate chair and the
student body.
The ASSU "can work without
a COP, but the senate will have to
pick up the slack," said outgoing
Senate Chair Kevin Warsh.
"Senators will and should have
more responsibility, and they
must become more active in solic
iting student opinion."
But newly elected senator Rafe
Sagarin said he will quit before he
picks up any of the slack.
"From studying history, it
seems that the most important
changes have come from student
activism, not compromise as it
goes on in student government,"
Sagarin said.
He has pledged to vote for the
dissolution of the COP and then
stop attending senate meetings as
a means of protesting the entire
structure of the ASSU.
Sagarin said he hopes the dis

solution of the COP will inspire
students to become more active
for causes they care about.
"I think that the senate should
be equally eliminated because
having a student government
which does not adequately repre
sent students contributes to stu
dent apathy," he said.
"If you have no student gov
ernment, but you have reporting
of the issues, people will eventual
ly get pissed off and do some
thing."
But Warsh said he believes
that, apart from Sagarin, the
incoming senate is interested in
serving students and soliciting
opinion..
In addition to senate action,
the position of senate chair, which
will become the highest position
within the ASSU, will require
"more time" and will be a "more
important job," Warsh said. The
senate chair is elected by the sen
ate and will receive a salary
around $3000, he said.
While maintaining contact
with University officials and stu
dents may be possible, the initia
tion of specific projects may be
more difficult next year, accord
ing to outgoing COP member
John Overdeck.
According to Overdeck, the
Stanford Recycling Center and
SURE Escort Service began as
COP projects.
This year, Overdeck said, the
COP worked to fund the Sexual
Assault Prevention, Education
and Response Office and created a
fledgling Course Guide.
They have also lobbied for sum
mer storage and graduate student
housing, hosted town meetings on
the budget cuts and worked with
the Financial Aid Advocacy Office
to oppose tuition increases.
Prakash said the thinks the
elimination of the COP "will
inspire senators." But he added
that he doesn't expect the tran
sition to COP-lessness to be
easy.
"I think it will be difficult to
organize immediately and run an
efficient senate from the begin
ning without a COP," said
Prakash, who was a senate associ
ate this year. The COP has tradi
tionally worked during the sum
mer to prepare for the upcoming
school year.

argue about it," said Prakash.
"Without a COP, he may have no
one to answer to unless the sen
ate can get together and act
immediately."
Without a COP, Jackson said,
his office would work directly
with the Nominations Commit
tee to get students on University
committees and with individual
senators to gauge student opin
ion.
"We'll try to find a fair way of
getting student input," said Jack
son. There is still a need for "a
good set of people that adminis
trators and faculty can look to"
for student views, he said.
While many campaign promis
es of recent COP slates — such
as allowing meal cards to be used
at Tresidder and creating a 24-
hour study hall — have gone
unfulfilled, others have come to
life.
For example, Lecture Notes,
the Airport Shuttle, the Pocket
Discount Card, the linen ser
vice, the annual Leadership
Summit and the placement of
change and condom machines
have all been previous COP ini
tiatives.
According to Vince Ricci, chair
of Financial Aid Advocacy Office,
the COP gave his office "direct
input" on what University com
mittees were talking about. For
example, current COP members
told Ricci about the tuition
increase "right as it happened,"
he said.
COP members serve on many
University committees, including
the University Committee on
Minority Issues, the Tresidder
Union Board, the Faculty Senate
and various search committees
for new administrators.
Ricci said "it will be a chal

lenge" to stay in touch with Uni
versity officials without a COP.
But his office will work to get
input more directly, he said, by
trying to place representatives on
committees, such as the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aid.
"It's do-able, for sure, if we get
strong people in the ASSU," Ricci
said.
Without a COP, many respon
sibilities will fall to the ASSU sen-

ators, the senate chair and the
student body.
The ASSU "can work without
a COP, but the senate will have to
pick up the slack," said outgoing
Senate Chair Kevin Warsh.
"Senators will and should have
more responsibility, and they
must become more active in solic
iting student opinion."
But newly elected senator Rafe
Sagarin said he will quit before he
picks up any of the slack.
"From studying history, it
seems that the most important
changes have come from student
activism, not compromise as it
goes on in student government,"
Sagarin said.
He has pledged to vote for the
dissolution of the COP and then
stop attending senate meetings as
a means of protesting the entire
structure of the ASSU.
Sagarin said he hopes the dis

solution of the COP will inspire
students to become more active
for causes they care about.
"I think that the senate should
be equally eliminated because
having a student government
which does not adequately repre
sent students contributes to stu
dent apathy," he said.
"If you have no student gov
ernment, but you have reporting
of the issues, people will eventual
ly get pissed off and do some
thing."
But Warsh said he believes
that, apart from Sagarin, the
incoming senate is interested in
serving students and soliciting
opinion..
In addition to senate action,
the position of senate chair, which
will become the highest position
within the ASSU, will require
"more time" and will be a "more
important job," Warsh said. The
senate chair is elected by the sen
ate and will receive a salary
around $3000, he said.
While maintaining contact
with University officials and stu
dents may be possible, the initia
tion of specific projects may be
more difficult next year, accord
ing to outgoing COP member
John Overdeck.
According to Overdeck, the
Stanford Recycling Center and
SURE Escort Service began as
COP projects.
This year, Overdeck said, the
COP worked to fund the Sexual
Assault Prevention, Education
and Response Office and created a
fledgling Course Guide.
They have also lobbied for sum
mer storage and graduate student
housing, hosted town meetings on
the budget cuts and worked with
the Financial Aid Advocacy Office
to oppose tuition increases.
Prakash said the thinks the
elimination of the COP "will
inspire senators." But he added
that he doesn't expect the tran
sition to COP-lessness to be
easy.
"I think it will be difficult to
organize immediately and run an
efficient senate from the begin
ning without a COP," said
Prakash, who was a senate associ
ate this year. The COP has tradi
tionally worked during the sum
mer to prepare for the upcoming
school year.

Life without a Council of Presidents
may be easy for Stanford voters to imagine,
but student leaders and University officials
say they will have to reforge student
administration relationships and restruc
ture the ASSU Senate next year.
Last week, students voted in the"I Pre
fer Not to Have a COP" slate and effective
ly abolished the ASSU's executive body,
which has traditionally served as a link

between students and the University on
such issues as race relations, budget cuts
and financial aid.
Dean of Students Michael Jackson said
he works "fairly regularly" with the COP
and has "a good bit of contact" with the
elected leadership.
He said the COP makes sure the ASSU
assets are properly managed and has
helped his office get student input on Uni
versity policies.
"I think [the COP) is an important func
tion that, when effective, helps to represent
student input fairly well," Jackson said. But

he added that students
may be poorly informed
about the extent of the
COP's work.
"People don't have
as broad a picture as
might be needed to
understand the ins and
outs of how effective
student government
works," he said.
University President

Donald Kennedy has also met regularly
with the COP to discuss topics of their
choice. Most recently, the conversations
have focused on budget cuts, he said.

"Obviously, [the dissolution of the COP]
won't represent the end of communication"
between students and the administration,
Kennedy said. He added that the University
president meets with the senate regularly
and that University committees receive stu
dent representatives through the ASSU
Nominations Commission.
"We'll find a way to communicate
because we have to," Kennedy said.
Incoming senator Anoop Prakash said
he expects the senate to form several com
mittees to fill the role of the COP, possibly
including a presidential liaison committee


Jackson
and a student input committee.
"Especially with a new presi
dent coming in, it will be impor
tant to spend time with him,"
Prakash said. "We will have to see
if many senators will want to put
in the time to cover the COP's
responsibilities.
"If I were (incoming Universi
