# The 						genetics of vertical leaping
## Author supports 'White Men Can't Jump' thesis 
### 
If you can leap past the inane title,
the movie White Men Can't Jump is
an entertaining flick filled with top
rate trash-talking and above-the-rim
storytelling.

I watched the movie last week at the
Century Cinema 10, hoping I would dis
cover something about basketball I
didn't already know. I don't usually
review films, but since my vertical jump
is better than the fat guy's from Siskel
and Ebert, I figured I'm qualified.
I didn't have very high expectations,
not because I already know everything,
but because the title wasn't much of a
revelation to me. Everybody knows
white guys can't jump, so why make a
movie about it?
Produce a movie called Mexicans
Can't Break the Press, Blacks Can't
Play Zone or Asians Can't Shoot the
Trey and all of a sudden you have con
troversy, intrigue and irate minority
basketball players dunking over you in
the lunch-time game. But at least the

film would be taking a stand.
A thesis like White Men Can't Jump
is about as controversial as saying
Whales Can't Walk on the Beach. If they
could, then you'd see one doing it every
once in awhile. Besides being self-evi
dent, the title is old news to anyone who
has ever stepped on a basketball court.
If you are not convinced of white
men's vertical deficiencies, you can save
yourself $6.75 and stale popcorn stuck
in your teeth by coming to watch me
play. One six inch vertical jump from me
confirms the thesis of a two hour film.

You may be able to tell I'm white
from my picture, but you probably can't
see the invisible force field that holds me
earth-bound. Even shoes endorsed by
Michael Jordan can't break the special
gravitational "Laimbeer Field" that
holds me and other white people to the
ground.
Of course, some whites might argue
that they can jump. Former Stanford
basketball player Todd Lichti had a lot
of hang time on his dunks, and the vol
leyball team definitely has springs.
However, there are always compelling
counter-examples like former Boston
Celtic center Greg Kite.
Fortunately, the film didn't investi
gate the controversy of the "Laimbeer
Field," but instead focused on what
effect it has on human relations. Non
white air superiority was assumed.
Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson
play out-of-luck basketball players who

hustle money on the cut-throal
courts of Los Angeles. They take
advantage of Harrelson's stereo
type as a slow white player to
score big bucks. But as sure
handed as Harrelson is on the
court, he is a turnover in real
life.
The funniest scenes depict the
trash-talking and psychological
warfare that occurs during any
pick-up basketball game. These
guys make pretentious Cal wide
receiver Brian Treggs look tight
lipped. There are also some nifty
hoops scenes along the way, and

even though the ending is tele
graphed from the far end of the
court, the moral of the movie is
fulfilling, even for people who can
jump.
Basketball is a metaphor for
life, and keeping score isn't as
easy as it appears. People are
blessed with different talents, and
just because you can't jump
doesn't mean you're a loser. The
important thing in any pursuit is
to get as much out of your talent
as you can. Why jump, when you
can trash-talk your way through
life?

Nat Cousins is a senior who can't
jump. If you don't like his
columns, your momma is an
astronaut.
