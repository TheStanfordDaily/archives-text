NEW YORK (AP) — CBS sportscaster Pat
Summerall, who has waged what he admits is
a lifc-or-death struggle with alcohol, has
taken a leave of absence and checked himself
into the Betty Ford Clinic for treatment, his
agent confirmed Tuesday.
"Pat decided at the Masters that he need
ed some help to lick a medical problem,"
agent Bob Rosen said. "If you have a broken
leg, you go to a doctor. He's gone to a doc
tor."
Summerall, 61, checked into the clinic in
Rancho Mirage, Calif., on Friday. Rosen
would not confirm that it was for alcohol
abuse, saying only that it was "purely a per
sonal problem."
Summerall was hospitalized in Florida in
December 1990 with upper gastro-intestinal
bleeding and one month later admitted that
his doctors told him if he drank again, "I'd be
dead very shortly."
Rosen said Summerall most likely would
be back to work by May 23, when CBS begins
its coverage of the Colonial golf tournament.
"He would be ready to work the week
before that, but it's an ABC tournament,"
Rosen said.
Summerall has been CBS' top NFL
announcer for 30 years and also works golf
and tennis tournaments for the network.
CBS said Jim Nantz, who worked with
Summerall at the Masters two weeks ago,
would take Summerall's place until he
returns.
Although CBS Sports president Neal Pil
son and executive producer Ted Shaker both

refused interview requests, the network
released a statement which read:
"... Pat Summerall has requested a
leave of absence because of a personal med
ical concern. CBS has, of course, agreed to
this request. The network extends to Pat
its full support, hopes that his privacy will
be respected and looks forward to his
return."

4lf you have a broken leg,
you go to a doctor. He's
gone to a doctor.'

Afler his 1990 hospital stay, Summerall
said the problem was caused by drinking and
the use of painkillers for arthritis, which he
has in his back and knee.
"That's just like taking a shotgun and
blowing a hole through your stomach," he
said, adding: "I certainly won't be the last
guy out of the bar anymore."
Rosen said Summerall was in good health.
"Actually, I spoke to his wife last night
and she'd just gotten off the phone with him,
and she said he sounded terifTic," Rosen said.
"He's very upbeat. He's looking forward to
his return. Pat lives for his work."
Summerall, who lives in Ponte Vedra
Beach, Fla., reportedly earns $1.5 million a
year at CBS.
