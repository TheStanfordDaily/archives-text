# Sailors take 10th at Thompson Regatta
## Middleton characterizes middle-of-field finish as 'disappointing' 
### Brian Border 
The Stanford sailing team learned last weekend
that life really is better on the west coast. After enter
ing the Thompson Trophy Regatta at the U. S. Coast
Guard Academy in Connecticut hoping to establish
themselves as one of the top squads in the nation, the
Cardinal instead endured two days filled with some
bright spots as well as a few mediocre performances
on way to a tenth place finish. To make matters
worse the weather wasn't especially accommodating
either.
"When we stepped off the plane, there was snow all
around, and it was freezing outside," said team cap
tain Geoff McDonald. "This was the kind of weather
that made me appreciate that I chose to attend Stan
ford."
The competition which the Cardinal faced was
equally inhospitable.
"It was an excellent regatta with an outstanding
field," head coach Blake Middleton said. "Out of the
20 participating schools, 13 are ranked nationally."
Despite the fact that they were competing against
some of the best sailors in the nation, the Cardinal
sailors still managed to place in the top-10 as a team.
However, Middleton described the result as "disap
pointing" due to the fact that only thirteen points
separated them from placing seventh and surpassing
the teams from Brown, Coast Guard Academy and
Connecticut. The sixth year coach also expressed dis
satisfaction because of the many mental mistakes
made by his squad.
"We had some disqualifications and some prema
ture starts which prevented us from finishing high
er," he said.
The weekend also contained several highlights for
Stanford.
"Clearly, the bright spot of the regatta was in the
C division where freshman Charles Meade placed
third out of twenty while sailing Lasers," Middleton
said.
The Cardinal also obtained a successful perfor
mance in the B division from skipper Scott Sellers
and crew Andi Guerrero.
According to Middleton, "They sailed very consis
tently and intelligently on their way to a ninth place
finish."
In the A division of the race, Stanford did not fare
as well. Skipper Matt Sanford and crew Kristen
Sidell combined with skipper Jeremy Mclntyre and
his crew Geoff McDonald for a 14 place finish.
