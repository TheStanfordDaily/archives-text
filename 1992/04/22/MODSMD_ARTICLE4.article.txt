# After four dry years, Lake Lag fills with people
##

By Kathleen Mallery
Sailing and windsurfing claimed a
definitive victory over mud volleyball
last Saturday, the blissful beginning of
the first sunny weekend since Lake
Lagunita officially opened.
Boats, people, dogs and even tad
poles have found their niche at the lake
since the Commission decided in
March to fill it with runoff from a reser
voir in the foothills.
If there had been less rain and the
Lake Commission had decided other
wise, this year's seniors could have
graduated without ever having a real
lake. Lag hasn't been open since 1988.
The catalog pictures of dorms encir
cling a campus lake filled with wind
surfers, rubber rafts, swimmers and
sail boats that lured undecided prospec
tive freshmen away from red brick and

ivy walls would have lied.
And when the boat house was torn
down several years ago, traces of the
lake's boating and windsurfing days
could only be found in memories — it
seemed University officials had decided
the drought would never end.
Then it began to rain. Maybe it
wasn't quite 40 days and 40 nights. But
it was long enough for rumors to pour
through the campus — "Maybe they'll
fill the lake."
And then, with more rain —
"They're going to fill the lake."
As the first weekend after the April 7
opening day approached, bodies
dreamed of basking in the sun and cool
ing off in the novelty of kike water.
But that weekend, it rained.
The excuse not to study wasn't sup-

For the first time in years, Lake Lagunita holds enough water to enable smooth sailing for all sorts of boats.
plied by a sunny day. Instead, stu
dents had to watch the drizzle
from dorm room windows.
"The weather was bad. There
were basically just dogs," said
Lake Lag's lifeguard, senior
James Reichmuth, who added
that he wondered if he'd ever have
to resuscitate a dog.
"It had never been filled in my
entire career here," Reichmuth
added.
And then there was last Saturday
— the weather did not disappoint.
What does Reichmuth think
now? "I think it's awesome," he
said.
Saturday filled all the catalog
promises made about the lake —
water, people, boats, dogs, screams.
Three-year-old Tennessee Fish
er, son of a graduate student, added
to the screams. His brother, Walk
er, 9, had found tadpoles perfect for
slipping down Tennessee's back.

"We're really glad to see water
in the lake," said their mother, DG,
who lives in Escondido Village.
At the beach, students and vis
itors lay in the sun. Textbooks
were covered with towels or
shirts. Good intentions had yield
ed to warm sun and a cool breeze.
Even birds were singing and a
stereo blasted rock music. One
woman held on to her straw hat
as a puff of wind passed from the
water to the sand.
Jim Spar, a Palo Alto resident,
tossed a stick into the water.
Brandy, his blond labrador
retriever, waited to run off until
he told her to fetch it.
"She learned to swim here,"
Spar said.
Recalling the years of drought,
he added, "It's been terrible."
But Brandy quickly took his
mind off the past by approaching,
wet, eager and ready to shake.
Also at the edge of the lake,
Charles Boissevain of San Fran
cisco directed his miniature
remote control sail boat. He had
driven by last week and seen that

the lake was full.
"I lowered my expenses by get
ting a small boat," Boissevain
said, laughing. He was having
trouble keeping his boat upright.
"Too windy," Boissevain said,
"Even the [real) boats are capsizing."

On the water, Capri Fourteens
were capsizing because of the
wind, or perhaps because would
be sailors had suffered through
too many years without water to
remember what to do.

bobbed, luffed and tipped. A few
completed tacks and rounded red
buoys. Most, however, were
downwind, hung up in the tall
grass.
"I spent the whole time in the
reeds and fighting the wind," said
a very wet Nicholas Burgess, a
first-year graduate student.
Burgess was on his way to return
his sail and mast to one of the
blue cargo containers that have
replaced the boat house.
One Capri Fourteen filled with
several students and no obvious
skipper sailed for the dock —
straight for the dock. With seconds
left, the boom jibed, heads ducked,
the threat of full-speed impact was
only fulfilled by a glance and the
sailors were off again.
On the other side of the lake,
students in two rubber rafts

threw water at each other.
"I don't want to get my hair
wet," one rafter screamed.
Splash.
And dry hair was no longer an
issue.
There were those who did stay
dry and cool up on the banks in
the shade of the oak trees.
Three rollerbladers watched
the windsurfers, and a few bikers
stopped to look out on the water.
A puppy that had been tied to a
tree nuzzled a woman napping. A
small boy, about 4 years old, peed
behind a low oak bough.
Just arriving at the lake, grad
uate student John McCrea said,
"It's the first time I've been here
with water in it."
McCrea looked out and smiled,
"I like it better with water."
Most agree.
