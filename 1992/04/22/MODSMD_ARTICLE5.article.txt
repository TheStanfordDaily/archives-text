# Being good to our mother Events planned to raise awareness
## 
### Michael McCarroll 
A clash between the forces of environ
mental good and industrial evil will take
center stage today as the SEAS tree takes
on "Styromaster" for Stanford's Earth
Day 1992.
The mock battle in White Plaza is one
of several noon-time events planned by
Students for Environmental Action at
Stanford, including letter-writing tables
and a solar-powered open mike.
"Earth Day is for everyone — not just
activists — to reflect on their place on this
planet," said SEAS coordinator Michael
Cohen, a freshman. The Stanford pro
gram will focus on raising awareness
about environment-saving habits and
lifestyles, he said.
The program will last from 11:30 a.m.
to 1 p.m. Organically grown fruits will be
distributed to onlookers to prove that fruit
need not be sprayed with chemicals and

pesticides to be edible.
Sunglasses and protective zinc will
identify SEAS members seeking to raise
awareness about a growing hole in the
ozone layer.
The students are satirizing a congress
man's recent remark that any possible
hole in the ozone layer can be remedied by
donning zinc and glasses.
Cohen said SEAS hopes to "encourage
involvement with current environmental
issues" with a letter-writing campaign focus
ing on forest protection in Montana and the
pending Wetlands Protection Act, which
SEAS members term "inadequate" and
"destructive."
The first Earth Day, held on this day in
1970, aimed to make people aware of the "pol
lution and general dirtiness of the planet,"
said SEAS member Tim Choy, a junior.
Earth Day was revived on its 20th
anniversary in 1990 in a world
wide proclamation of environ
mental awareness.
On that day, SEAS members
occupied White Plaza for a week
and constructed a living space in
the grass area between the Book
store and Old Union.
Lights, clocks and a refrigera
tor powered by solar energy
"showed students viable energy
alternatives," said Choy, who
helped organize the activities.
Earth I)ay 1990 also included a
5K and 10K fun run, daily speak
ers, a rally at Frost Amphitheater
and a march down Palm Drive to
trains bound for the regional
demonstration in San Francisco.
Choy insists that the relative

smallness of this year's Earth
Day celebration is not due to a
loss of momentum.
"Earth Day 1990 was meant to
catalyze a new decade of environ
mentalism, while [Earth Day
19921 aims to rekindle that move
ment," Choy said.
Cohen said he hopes that the
program in White Plaza today will
"reinforce the actions that people
are already taking and stimulate
more people to take measures to
save the environment."
Sophomore Rafe Sagarin, a
two-year member of SEAS, said
he hopes the program will "show
people that most of our waste is
totally needless."
Sagarin was elected to the
ASSU Senate last week in a cam
paign that rejected election fliers,
using chalk messages on pave
ment to promote his candidacy
instead.
