A clash between the forces of environ
mental good and industrial evil will take
center stage today as the SEAS tree takes
on "Styromaster" for Stanford's Earth
Day 1992.
The mock battle in White Plaza is one
of several noon-time events planned by
Students for Environmental Action at
Stanford, including letter-writing tables
and a solar-powered open mike.
"Earth Day is for everyone — not just
activists — to reflect on their place on this
planet," said SEAS coordinator Michael
Cohen, a freshman. The Stanford pro
gram will focus on raising awareness
about environment-saving habits and
lifestyles, he said.
The program will last from 11:30 a.m.
to 1 p.m. Organically grown fruits will be
distributed to onlookers to prove that fruit
need not be sprayed with chemicals and

pesticides to be edible.
Sunglasses and protective zinc will
identify SEAS members seeking to raise
awareness about a growing hole in the
ozone layer.
The students are satirizing a congress
man's recent remark that any possible
hole in the ozone layer can be remedied by
donning zinc and glasses.
Cohen said SEAS hopes to "encourage
involvement with current environmental
issues" with a letter-writing campaign focus
ing on forest protection in Montana and the
pending Wetlands Protection Act, which
SEAS members term "inadequate" and
"destructive."
The first Earth Day, held on this day in
1970, aimed to make people aware of the "pol
lution and general dirtiness of the planet,"
said SEAS member Tim Choy, a junior.
Earth Day was revived on its 20th
