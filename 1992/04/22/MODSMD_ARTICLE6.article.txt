# Tainted ladies' do rare dance Heavy rain may be behind butterfly boom

Spring is in the air, along with birds,
bees and many, many butterflies.
The campus has recently been over
whelmed by a swarm of the flitting,
orange and black creatures. They are the
painted lady butterflies, Vanessa cardui,
that come to the area by the thousands
once every 10 to 20 years.
"I came around the corner of Campus
and Oalvez and thought, This is amazing!' "
said Patty Lombardo, a Peace Corps
recruiter with a table in White Plaza.
Roland Biirgmann, a graduate student,
first saw the insects Sunday while driving
back from Napa Valley.
"One to three butterflies are beautiful,
but you see a thousand and you think, 'Oh
my God.' . . . Things are not quite in bal
ance," he said.
The overwhelming presence of painted

ladies is a puzzle to scientists, according to
butterfly expert Dennis Murphy. Murphy
is the director of the Center of Conserva
tion Biology at Stanford.
"Scientists simply don't know why,"
said Murphy, adding that an environmen
tal cause most likely triggered the swarm.
He speculated that the heavy winter
rainfall in Southern California helped the
caterpillars of the painted lady butterflies
proliferate.
"What we may be seeing is the winter
brood in search of food," he said.
The resulting exodus from the south to
the north is a "one-way ticket" for the but
terflies, Murphy added. Those which have
been examined show signs of wear and tear
on their wings, indicating that they have
flown for weeks. Eventually, they will just
wear their bodies out, Murphy said.
This has been a bumper year for insects
in general, according to Murphy.
"There has been a tremendous

outbreak of insects reduced in pre
vious years by the drought," he
said, citing the cranefly — a large
mosquito-like bug — and the tus
sok moth, whose larvae have been
dangling from the trees and
thwacking unsuspecting bicyclists.
