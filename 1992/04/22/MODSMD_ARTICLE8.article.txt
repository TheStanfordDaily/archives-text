Key abortion case today
WASHINGTON (AP) - Morality, poli
tics and the law will collide today in a case
providing a conservative Supreme Court an
opportunity to pronounce its verdict on
abortion.
The nine justices are to hear arguments
beginning at 10 a.m. over a restrictive Penn
sylvania statute that could prove the sever
est test yet over the constitutional right to
abortion decreed by a predecessor, and more
liberal, high court 19 years ago.
Both sides agree that the conservative
majority fashioned by Ronald Reagan and
George Bush may use the occasion to
reverse, explicitly or implicitly, the land
mark 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling.
As the day began with a steady rain pelting
down, several dozen people under the watchful
eye of Supreme Court police sprawled in a base
ment corridor of the court building to begin a
10-hour wait for one of the 100 or so coveted
courtroom seats reserved for the public.
