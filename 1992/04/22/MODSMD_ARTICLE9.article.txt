# Bill would spend reserves

### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
In a dramatic break from the ASSU Sen
ate's history of cautious spending, seven
senators last night proposed a bill to tap the
ASSU reserve accounts and redistribute
almost $1 million directly to registered stu
dents and student groups.
The bill would give each student a refund
check for about $65.
Graduate senator Peter Thiel, chief
author of the Omnibus Reserve Fund
Reform Bill, said the proposal came about
because more than $970,000 lies unused in
ASSU reserve accounts.
"I believe that students are shareholders
in these accounts," said Thiel, who chairs
the appropriations committee. "And since
there are no major business projects being
proposed or contemplated, then we should
definitely go into these reserves."
The bill proposes the allocation more
than $800,000 of the $970,000 available
reserve and earnings to a one-time refund
for all students enrolled at Stanford this
quarter.

The refund, which would amount to
about $65 per student, would be delivered
to graduating seniors by June 14,1992 and
to all other students by Sept. 14, 1992.
The bill also proposes that the $170,000
checking budget reserves be made available
to the ASSU Appropriations Committee,
which could use the money to complement
existing funds for the Program, Communi
ty Service and Publications Board.
Under the proposal, whatever remained
of the $170,000 would be distributed to the
Program Board (37.5 percent); the Publica
tion Board (12.5 percent); and the one-time
student refund (50 percent).
In addition, an extra $10,000 from the
checking budget reserves would be allocated
to "an all-campus end-of-the-year celebra
tion" at Lake Lagunita May 23.
"I think an all-campus ASSU bash would
be fun. It's about time the ASSU did some
thing for the students," Thiel said.
The bill proposes that the student
refunds continue annually unless the
refund amount becomes too low.
