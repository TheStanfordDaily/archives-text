It's that time of the year, and the Black Recruitment and Orientation
Committee invites you to join us in welcoming prospective African
American freshmen to Stanford.
• Cosby Night at Ujamaa — Thursday, April 23 — 6:00 p.m.
Greet the BROCees on their first night at Stanford as you eat cake and ice cream. This

Remember, this will be the last Cosby Night ever held during a BROC Weekend.
(Cosby is going off the air!)
• Chillout — Lagunita Courtyard — Friday, April 24 - Noon
Chill with fellow classmates as you learn more about the prospective Class of 1996, enjoy
Popeye's Famous Fried Chicken, and jam to the latest beats provided by George Perry.
