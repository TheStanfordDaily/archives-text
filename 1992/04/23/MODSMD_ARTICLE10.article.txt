# Russian students experience life on Farm
## 
### Patty Wu 
From observing differences in study habits
to eating "hundreds" of bananas, 12 students
from the former Soviet Union spent the last
two weeks getting a taste of Stanford life.
The experience is part of a program that
used to be called the Stanford-Soviet
Exchange. The five-year-old program still
hosts students from Novosibirsk State Uni
versity, but now calls itself the Stanford-
Novosibirsk Exchange.
According to sophomore Greg Scown, the
hosting director, the drastic changes the coun
try has undergone since the program was ini
tiated does not diminish the importance of the
exchange of ideas between Russian and Amer
ican students.
The visiting students, who leave Sun
day, note many differences between the
universities.
According to Victor Emelianov, American
students "cram" more, while Russian stu
dents usually study for longer intervals.
And at a lunch-time trip to Fresh Choice, a
restaurant at the Stanford Shopping Center,
Scown said the students spent two hours
enjoying the fruits and vegetables that are
abundant in California.
Bananas, for example, are scarce in Novosi
birsk. Scown said the students ate "hundreds"
of bananas.
The Russian participants have been living
with hosts at various dorms across campus
since they arrived, and have spoken in a dozen
dorms and houses.
Their informal discussions have focused
more on one-to-one conversations than on pol
itics and economics, Scown pointed out.
"People always ask me about Gorbachev
and Yeltsin," said Olga Borodaevskaia, an eco
nomics major at Novosibirsk and one of the
only two women in the group.
The Russian students are interested in
talking about their lives as well as the govern
ment, she added.
The group is made up of undergraduate and
graduate students majoring in various subjects,
ranging from physics to biology to history.
Emelianov, 23, is a math major who is orig
inally from Siberia. He now lives in a flat with
his parents in Academic Town, the location of
Novosibirsk State University.
He came to Stanford "to communicate with
Americans, learn more about American culture
and to compare educational systems."
Emelianov said Stanford students study

intensely for frequent midterms and finals,
but Novosibirsk students study in two to three
week intervals for major tests given only a few
times a year.
Another difference between the education
al systems is that most Russian universities
have five-year undergraduate programs,
Emelianov said.
As a temporary resident in Roble Hall,
Emelianov has immersed himself in Stanford
student life.
He said his host, freshman Bob Dolbow,
has been "great and kind."
While the participants in the exchange
experience the student life of Stanford, their
faculty advisor, Alexander Sakhanenko, has
contributed to the academic community.
Sakhanenko, Novosibirsk's Dean of Math
matics, gave a lecture on statistics and proba-

bility theory to the math department Monday
afternoon.
Besides seeing Stanford, the students have
toured San Francisco and taken a road trip to
Los Angeles and Disneyland. They have also
visited government buildings and businesses
in Menlo Park.
About 15 Stanford students, including
Scown, will be visiting Novosibirsk for the sec
ond part of the exchange next September.
Scown said one of the greatest benefits of the
exchange is "the ability to know students from
Russia. They're accessible. They're here."
"It's a unique chance to share ideas with
intelligent people committed to intellectual
pursuit," he said. "The focus of the program is
getting (Russian) students in contact with
other students in the community to share
ideas."
