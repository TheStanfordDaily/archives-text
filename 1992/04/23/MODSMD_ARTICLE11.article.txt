6.3 quake hits Southern California
LOS ANGELES (AP) — A strong earthquake rattled South
ern California on last night, rocking buildings from the Mexican
border to Santa Barbara, 200 miles up the coast. There were no
immediate reports of damage or injuries.
The quake measured 6.3 in a preliminary Richter scale read
ing, said Lucy Jones, a seismologist at the California Institute of
Technology's seismology lab in Pasadena. A magnitude 6 quake is
capable of severe damage.
The epicenter was nine miles east of Desert Hot Springs, which
is 110 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. Lesser quakes had
struck that area earlier Wednesday evening.
Buildings swayed in downtown Los Angeles, and shaking was
felt at Dodger Stadium during a baseball game.
The quake was felt from San Diego to Santa Barbara, accord
ing to broadcast reports.
The swaying motion that began shortly before 10 p.m. contin
ued for at least 10 seconds.
"It rolled for a good five to 10 seconds, a real strong one to the
point where it didn't seem like it was going to end," said Mark
Sayre, a broadcaster with KESQ-TV in Palm Springs.
Explosions slam Guadalajara
GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) — A series of explosions in the
sewer system ripped open streets, flattened buildings and hurled
trucks and cars in the air in Mexico's second largest city yesterday.
Witnesses said 184 bodies had been recovered, and 600 people
were reported injured.
The federal government sent the army to keep order in the city
of 3 million, where telephones, electricity and water services had
been cut.
Residents said they had complained about a gas smell for more
than a day, but were told everything was under control.
A statement by Pemex, Mexico's state oil monopoly, said the
explosions were caused by volatile liquid hexane that leaked into
the sewers.
The source of the hexane was a private cooking oil company,
La Central, which used it to extract edible oils from seeds, Pemex
said.
But Jose Morales, manager of La Central, said its drainage sys
tem is not connected to that of the city. He welcomed an investi
gation but said his company "will not be a scapegoat."
