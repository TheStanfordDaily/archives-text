## The
						bloody sacrifice 
### 
Execution was a grisly
state ritual that didn't
solve real societal flaws

The state of Califor
nia enacted a grisly ritual
reminiscent of the bloody
sacrifices of times gone by when it
executed convicted murderer
Robert Alton Harris two days ago.
In a nightmarish scene unparal
leled in the most melodramatic
soap opera, Harris' execution was
delayed by four reprieves before
the final blow.
Once, his execution was even
halted as the acid that generates
the deadly gas swirled into the vats
below the prisoner's chair. It is
unreasonably cruel to strap the
condemned man to the chair
unless the order to kill is clear.
By wielding the Grim Reaper's
scythe, the state is exercising intol
erable and arbitrary power over
the lives of its citizens. Instead of
supporting citizens as they seek
better ends, it is attempting to gov
ern their very destinies.
The Supreme Court's prohibi
tion of further delays in the execu
tion, which denied all possibility of
appeal to Harris' lawyers, only
confirm fears about the extent of
state power.
The Supreme Court's action is a
frightening step that betrays an
impatience unworthy of the
nation's highest judicial body.
While this action is indeed the pre
rogative of the Court, prohibiting
further appeal even before the
lower courts had made their deci
sion has rarely been done before.
The death penalty is based upon
notions of intrinsic human evil that
are frequently used by legal author
ities. In the process, the real socio
economic conditions of scarcity and
ostracization that are the motivat
ing forces for much criminal activi
ty are quietly obscured.
Both the judiciary and the gov

ernment seem unwilling to tackle
problems in current social policy. But
by focusing on education, employ
ment assistance and community
development, the talents of "crimi
nals" could be used more fruitfully.
The death penalty lets a society
rest on its laurels in a shameful
and self-complacent way, savoring
the heady thrill that retribution
brings in its wake. While the
intense pain of Steve Baker — the
father of one of the victims — can
not be diminished, allowing him to
view the gassing reduces the pro
cess of punishment to a cheap,
pandering game of revenge.
That American society today is
haunted by proliferating violence
is hardly news — the number of
murders in East Palo Alto and
Oakland are at record highs.
Instead of treating the cause of
this disease, our current criminal
justice system seems to focus on
administering treatment to the
symptoms. Increasing the vigor
with which these superficial symp
toms are attacked in no way allevi
ates the fundamental malaise.
The death penalty is by no
means a neutral ground for the
dispensation of justice. Its applica
tion has been proved to be racist
and arbitrary.
Moreover, even under the
fairest system, the innocent are
sometimes prosecuted. In the case
of those who are wrongfully
charged, the death penalty leaves
absolutely no chance of redress.
The irreversibility of the act must
give us pause to think before we
are so hasty to scream for blood.
The United States' advocacy of
the death penalty isolates it from
most of the Western democracies.
In Harris' case, life imprisonment
without parole is the only justifi
ably harsh punishment the state
should impose.
In a society as addicted to vio
lence as ours is, the argument that
the death penalty acts as a deterrent
is invalid. Fighting societal violence
with more sophisticated and institu
tionalized forms can only aggravate
a situation that is in need of a balm.
