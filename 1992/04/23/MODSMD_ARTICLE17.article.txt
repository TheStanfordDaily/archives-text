## Liberty, Society & Demons 
### 
TWO YEARS AGO yesterday, I
placed a small square of paper on
my tongue and slowly melted into
the foothills. Over the course of a bright
spring Saturday I watched long grassy
fields flow into Monet paintings and
blooming flowers explode into epic shades
of every color under the sun. It just hap
pened to be the twentieth anniversary of
Earth Day and though I joined no rallies,
I certainly celebrated the beauty of mama
nature.
I had consumed an illegal substance
and in our era of The War On Drugs I
became a criminal. My trip passed without
penalty, but I was one of the privileged.
Around the country, police forces are
increasingly abusing civil liberties in the
name of The War On Drugs. War casual
ties are everywhere — from children who
were encouraged to report their parents'
marijuana use to black businessmen
who've had their homes and cars confis
cated without trial when they were mis
taken for dealers.
Like the anti-communist fervor of the
'50s, the War On Drugs has become a
major front for the government to tram
ple constitutional rights.
Black neighborhoods and users are the
most heavily targeted groups by law
enforcement agencies, yet they are given
the least help to deal with the violence
and other social ills that drugs cause.
Moreover, issues of poverty, jobless

ness and general desperation — some of
the main causes of drug abuse — are
largely ignored by the Bush Administra
tion. The War On Drugs is more about
rhetoric than results. It is a convenient
way for the government to wash its hands
of any responsibility for our society's
problems and blame drug dealers instead.
The War On Drugs must also be viewed
in a historical context that dates back to the
turn of the century. In Cleveland, for exam
ple, white politicians and police pushed ille
gal saloons, casinos and brothels into newly
forming black neighborhoods.
Though white men spent plenty of
time at these establishments, they didn't
want them in own their neighborhoods
— and blacks had no power to refuse.
Also, because of racism in the labor mar
ket, such illegal business was often the
only work available to blacks. Though
similar patterns have repeated for the
last hundred years, analyses rarely delve
deeper than the latest crack crisis.
Even our haven from the world, Stan
ford, has been affected in the last few
years. When I arrived here my frosh year,
I was impressed by the drinking policy
that emphasized individual responsibility
and personal choice.
In the intervening years, however,
The War reached the Farm. The federal
government warned Stanford that if they
liked receiving lots of grant money,
they'd better have a tough drug and alco

'I had con
sumed an ille
gal substance
and became a
criminal.'

hoi policy. And so, a once respectable pol
icy that treated young adults like young
adults faded into history.
In our current state of war, Stuart
Reges, a highly regarded computer science
lecturer, was booted from campus last
year solely on the grounds that he served
alcohol to underage students — exactly
the kind of behavior that was acceptable at
Stanford not six months prior.
Our drug policy is corrupt. It depends
on authoritarian force rather than indi
vidual thought. It demonizes some sub
stances while ignoring the greater dam
age done by cigarettes and alcohol. We
ought to be focusing far more money and
energy on education about the risks of
substance abuse and on treatment for
those who are already suffering.
My mother works for a program called
Project Healthy Choices. Rather than
encouraging children to "just say no,"
her program challenges them — like the
original Stanford alcohol policy — to
make reasoned decisions for themselves.
Our government could learn a thing or
two from mama.

Omar can't remember the last time he
smoked pot.
