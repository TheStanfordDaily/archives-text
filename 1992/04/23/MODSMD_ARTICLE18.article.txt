Environmentalists show contempt for human life

WITH ANOTHER EARTH DAY
upon us, now is an excellent time
to evaluate environmentalism.
Environmentalists assault our human
dignity every day here at Stanford,
whether in their demands that we
breathe the smell of unflushed urine in
order to save enough water to preserve a
certain type of minnow or that we halt
progress on vital medical research in
order to preserve rodents.
As Dr. Michael Berliner wrote in
"Environmentalists: The New Life-
Haters," "The fundamental goal of envi
ronmentalists is not clean air and clean
water. .. .If the good of man were the
aim of environmentalists, they would
embrace the industry and technology
that have eradicated the diseases,
plagues, pestilence and famines that
brought wholesale death and destruction
prior to the Industrial Revolution."
Instead, as Berliner argues, "they

demonstrate their contempt for human
life."
The root of this contempt is that envi
ronmentalists ascribe "intrinsic value" to
nature. As Ayn Rand showed, the concept
of value presupposes answers to the ques
tions, "Of value to whom" and"For what
purpose?" Without human life, there can
be no "whom" and, therefore, no stan
dard of value. The "intrinsic value of
nature" is a contradiction in terms.
To present the "intrinsic value" view
point carried to a logical conclusion,
Berliner quotes biologist David Graber:
" 'Human happiness [is] not as impor
tant as a wild and healthy
planet. . . .[The ecosystem has] intrinsic
value, more value to me than another
human body or a billion of
them. . . .Until such time as Homo Sapi
ens should decide to rejoin nature, some
of us can only hope for the right virus to
come along.' "

Berliner analyzes, "Such is the naked
essence of environmentalism: it mourns
the death of one whale or tree but actually
welcomes the death of billions of people."
You may be saying, "Yes, radical envi
ronmentalists are malicious, but I sup
port a compromise between business and
the environment. We shouldn't elimi
nate modern technology, just restrict it
in order to conserve nature."
In"The Anti-Industrial Revolution,"
Ayn Rand explains why this is flawed as
the "radical" viewpoint: "A 'restricted'
technology is the equivalent of a censored
mind. .. .In confrontation with nature,
[the conversationists'] plea is: ' well
enough alone.' Do not [further] upset the
balance of nature.. . .do not anger the
unknowable demons who rule it all."
In today's environmental parlance,
these "unknowable demons" are called
"ecosystems," but the message is the
same: "Leave well enough alone."

But what would have happened had
we "left well enough alone" when
humans, newly evolved from apes, bare
ly survived from day to day in the wild?
Or in 1900 when U.S. life expectancy
was 47 years? The extent to which we
regulate technology, "leaving well
enough alone" is the extent to which we
inhibit human progress.
Ayn Rand sums up, "What do [con
servationists] want to preserve? Any
thing, except man. What do they want to
rule? Nothing, except man.
" 'The creators' concern is the con
quest of nature. The parasite's concern
is the conquest of men,' said Howard
Roark in The Fountainhead.' It was
published in 1943. Today, the moral
inversion is incomplete."
I couldn't have said it better myself.
