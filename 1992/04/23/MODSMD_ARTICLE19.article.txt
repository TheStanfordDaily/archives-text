# Grad student predicts Bartleby II: the ASSU
## 
### 
In all the furor over the election of "I
Prefer Not to Have a COP," it seems to
me that the ASSU is still missing the
point. The proponents of the ASSU
should take a look at the petard they've
been hoisted upon — it may be their own.
We've heard all the arguments as to
why the preferential voting system is to
blame, and how the students have made
a "mistake," in the words of the wise
ones of the ASSU (Isn't branding the
voters' wishes to be mistakes how fas
cism starts? Is palace coup a possibility?).
But all these things would not be
issues if "I Prefer Not to" (let's just
name them "Bartleby" to cut down on
print) had not garnered 28 percent of
the first choice votes. Those who voted
for Bartleby as a first choice are
undoubtedly the same people who would

not have voted at all if it were not for
the ASSU's refund policy.
In any open-shop union, if you do not
want to participate, you do not pay dues.
However, with "our" union, you pay
your dues, then you must participate (by
voting) in order to be an effective non
participant (and get your money back).
As Yossarian would say, "That's quite a
catch you've got there."
Our ASSU suffers from the same
hubris about democracy that has distorted
our nation's behavior over the last centu
ry. You cannot force good government on
a people through either money or guns
(Rail government is another matter).
The truth is that most people do not
want to participate in something that
they do not believe in, and while most
people around here believe in democra
cy, a lot of people have a more fervent
belief in the tooth fairy than the efficacy
of the ASSU.
I would be willing to bet that a party
named "I Prefer Not to Have an ASSU"

would also have garnered 28 percent of
the first choice votes. If you will forgive
another distorted cliche, it would appear
that the ASSU has no clothes — and
that people are starting to laugh.
Anyone for changing the refund
rules? No need to hurry; if we procrasti
nate (as usual) maybe next year we'll be
entertained by "Bartleby II: The ASSU
Chainsaw Massacre."
