# Director of Health, Safety quitting post
## 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
Thomas Mcßride will leave his position as direc
tor of Stanford's department of environmental
health and safety in August. He plans to teach at
the Stanford in Washington campus fall quarter,
then leave the University.
A national search for Mcßride's successor will

be conducted by a committee
organized by Ray Bacchetti,
vice president for planning and
management. So far, about 50
major research universities
have been notified of the posi
tion's vacancy, Mcßride said.
As department director, his
responsibilities include regulat
ing campus safety in housing,
maintenance and food service.
He also oversees the Universi
ty's compliance with federal

and state regulations on fire safety, waste disposal,
laboratory safety and other potentially hazardous
areas.
Since taking the post in 1989, Mcßride initiated
the campus injury and illness prevention program.
The program vastly improved safety conditions in
laboratories, according to Harvey Chock, the
department's associate director.
Mcßride said he is leaving in order to return to
undergraduate teaching and to join his wife of 17
years in Washington."I want to be with her," he said.
His wife, Catherine Milton, founder and direc
tor of Stanford's Haas Center for Public Service,
has been serving as executive director of the Com
mission on National and Community Service in the
capital since October and will remain there for at
least another year.
Mcßride said he is looking forward to moving
with their two teenage sons to Washington, where
he previously spent 25 years in positions including
inspector general of the U.S. Department of Labor
and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, deputy
director of the Peace Corps' Latin American region
and associate Watergate special prosecutor.
Chock praised Mcßride, calling him "one of the
most effective people" he has seen in his 10 years
with the department "in actually getting policies


Mcßride
implemented."
He said Mcßride "was most
involved in getting out and per
sonally conducting [lab safety]
training" sessions with laborato
ry supervisors and almost all the
science faculty members.
"He cut to the core of some
pretty complex problems," Chock
said, adding that the department
has "progressed on a huge range
of fronts under his direction."
Mcßride first came to Stanford
in 1982 as associate dean for
administration at the Law School.
He also taught undergraduate
classes in human biology, focus
ing on controversial legal and
political issues such as abortion
and AIDS.
Since taking the post at the
department of environmental
health and safety, Mcßride said
he has missed undergraduate
teaching most of all.
At the Washington campus, he

will teach courses on legal per
spectives in biology and conduct a
tutorial on "governmental grid
lock."

'He cut to the core
of some pretty com
plex problems.'
—Harvey Chock

After teaching in the fall,
Mcßride said he will resign from
Stanford, but does not know what
he will do afterward. He hopes it
will be "something interesting."
Mcßride said his current posi
tion has been "very stimulating,"
and with its vast range of respon
sibilities has allowed him the
"opportunity to pack 10 different
careers into one."
He said he would eventually
like "to return to Stanford to
resume undergraduate teaching"
in human biology.
