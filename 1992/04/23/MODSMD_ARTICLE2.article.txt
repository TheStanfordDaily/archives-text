Thomas Mcßride will leave his position as direc
tor of Stanford's department of environmental
health and safety in August. He plans to teach at
the Stanford in Washington campus fall quarter,
then leave the University.
A national search for Mcßride's successor will

be conducted by a committee
organized by Ray Bacchetti,
vice president for planning and
management. So far, about 50
major research universities
have been notified of the posi
tion's vacancy, Mcßride said.
As department director, his
responsibilities include regulat
ing campus safety in housing,
maintenance and food service.
He also oversees the Universi
ty's compliance with federal

and state regulations on fire safety, waste disposal,
laboratory safety and other potentially hazardous
areas.
Since taking the post in 1989, Mcßride initiated
the campus injury and illness prevention program.
The program vastly improved safety conditions in
laboratories, according to Harvey Chock, the
department's associate director.
Mcßride said he is leaving in order to return to
undergraduate teaching and to join his wife of 17
years in Washington."I want to be with her," he said.
His wife, Catherine Milton, founder and direc
tor of Stanford's Haas Center for Public Service,
has been serving as executive director of the Com
mission on National and Community Service in the
capital since October and will remain there for at
least another year.
Mcßride said he is looking forward to moving
with their two teenage sons to Washington, where
he previously spent 25 years in positions including
inspector general of the U.S. Department of Labor
and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, deputy
director of the Peace Corps' Latin American region
and associate Watergate special prosecutor.
Chock praised Mcßride, calling him "one of the
most effective people" he has seen in his 10 years
with the department "in actually getting policies
