# Campbell's comments tarnish Hoover image
## 
### 
Undoubtedly one of the greatest
achievements in our society during the
past 30 years has been the unprecedented
rise in the level of human rights and anti
discriminatory awareness and practice.
As a result, many public figures have
been held accountable for even inadvertent

discriminatory innuendos. In that light,
the overtly bigoted and racist remarks
made by Dr. W. Glenn Campbell, coun
selor at the Hoover Institution, sound
even more outrageous. Moreover, his total
ly unrepentant attitude toward this inci
dent is symptomatic of a deeper problem.
Such behavior is eminently incompat
ible with a counselor-level position at an
institution of Hoover's and Stanford's
reputation.
The failure to implement this resigna
tion means sanctioning a dangerous
precedent with far-reaching conse
quences; it is bound to tarnish the image
of the Hoover Institution; finally, we per
sonally will be forced to actively discour
age further financial support to Stanford
through our local business contacts.
We trust that the Hoover Institution
will make a timely and right decision on
this matter.
