## Men's gym vies for NCAA title 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior Staff Writer 
Stanford, Nebraska and six other pretenders
are in Lincoln, Neb. this weekend for the NCAA
men's gymnastics championship. The field of eight
may as well be pared down to two. Either the No.l
Cornhuskers or No. 2 Cardinal will bring home an
NCAA title.
Nebraska edged out Stanford for first place in
the West Regional Championships on April 11.
The title meet will be held (tonight through Satur
day) on the Huskers home floor. Conventional wis
dom tells you that Nebraska is the clear-cut
favorite.
Stanford coach Sadao Hamada says don't
believe everything you hear.
"We're definitely peaking for this meet ... our
preparation has been excellent. I've felt very good
about our chances since the Regionals."
The Albuquerque West Regionals marked the
first meeting of the powerhouses, and Hamada
found encouragement in a narrow defeat. "Nebras
ka had an almost perfect competition. They hit 34
out of 36 routines. We missed on ten routines, but
they still only beat us by one point. It's clear we
have the potential to win," he said.
The question for Stanford this weekend is: Will
that potential be fulfilled or will they finish as the
NCAA's bridesmaid for a second consecutive year?
If the sudden lull in the Cardinal trainer's room is
any indicator, throw out the white gown and bou
quet. Hamada's team is healthier now than it has
been all season.
Mark Booth, Jeff Bender and Tim Ryan are all
in better condition than they were two weeks ago.
According to Hamada and star junior Jair Lynch,
the lineup the Cardinal send on the floor this week
will be its strongest, which was
not the case at either the Region
als or the Pacific 10 champi
onships due to injuries and some
routine experimentation.
Lynch and Ryan should lead
Stanford's assault on the Lincoln
scoreboards. Lynch has posted
team-high numbers in four of the
six events. (The floor, the pommel
horse, the rings, the vault, the
parallel bars and the high bars.)
His highlights have come in the
two meets against Cal; he posted
9.90 scores on the parallel bars
and pommel horse in the first
contest and a 9.90 on the floor in
the second.
Ryan has been the team's best
on the vault and high bar this sea
son. His 9.80 vault score at the
early season UC-Santa Barbara
Tournament has yet to be bet
tered and he dazzled with a 9.90
on the high bar in the second Cal
meeting.

Bender, Booth and Chris Sey
will also have to turn in great per
formances if the Cardinal wants
to avoid a repeat of Albuquerque.
Sey has averaged 9.54 on the
vault (second only to Lynch) and
9.43 on the floor. Booth's pommel
horse average of 9.56 trails only
Lynch and he has scored 9.50 or
higher on his last four trips to the
high bar. Bender has posted three
9.85s on the parallel bars and is
averaging an impressive 9.69 in
that event.
The Cardinal have surprised
no one this year with their strong
performance; the national cham
pionship has been a season-long
goal. "We don't need to put any
extra pressure on ourselves,"
Hamada said.
"I just want them to treat this
like any other meet. Our routines
are difficult enough that, if we hit
them, we can outscore Nebras
ka."
Translation: don't surprised if
you see a oversized Cardinal &
White banner in Ford Center next
week proclaiming the Farm's
fourth 1992 NCAA title.
