## Men's gym vies for NCAA title 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior Staff Writer 
Stanford, Nebraska and six other pretenders
are in Lincoln, Neb. this weekend for the NCAA
men's gymnastics championship. The field of eight
may as well be pared down to two. Either the No.l
Cornhuskers or No. 2 Cardinal will bring home an
NCAA title.
Nebraska edged out Stanford for first place in
the West Regional Championships on April 11.
The title meet will be held (tonight through Satur
day) on the Huskers home floor. Conventional wis
dom tells you that Nebraska is the clear-cut
favorite.
Stanford coach Sadao Hamada says don't
believe everything you hear.
"We're definitely peaking for this meet ... our
preparation has been excellent. I've felt very good
about our chances since the Regionals."
The Albuquerque West Regionals marked the
first meeting of the powerhouses, and Hamada
found encouragement in a narrow defeat. "Nebras
ka had an almost perfect competition. They hit 34
out of 36 routines. We missed on ten routines, but
they still only beat us by one point. It's clear we
have the potential to win," he said.
The question for Stanford this weekend is: Will
that potential be fulfilled or will they finish as the
NCAA's bridesmaid for a second consecutive year?
If the sudden lull in the Cardinal trainer's room is
any indicator, throw out the white gown and bou
quet. Hamada's team is healthier now than it has
been all season.
Mark Booth, Jeff Bender and Tim Ryan are all
in better condition than they were two weeks ago.
According to Hamada and star junior Jair Lynch,
