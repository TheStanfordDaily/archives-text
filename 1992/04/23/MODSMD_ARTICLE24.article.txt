# Artist-athlete Lynch pictures perfect 10's

### Kevin Jeffery Senior Staff Writer 
Mental imagery, he says, is a key to his
success. When he wakes up in the morn
ing, when he lies down to relax, whenever
he has free time Jair Lynch envisions him
self in the midst of a sparkling routine. He
envisions a flawless vault, a solid dis
mount, a perfect landing ... a perfect 10
flashing on the scoreboard.
These days the Cardinal superstar gym
nast is trying to add one more to that list
of visions: standing with his teammates
atop the gold medal platform after leading
them to an NCAA title.
The junior from Washington D.C. is in
Lincoln, Nebraska this weekend for the
NCAA Championships.
The meet marks the end of his third
season as Stanford's top gymnast, but for
Lynch the road to Lincoln has been a long
one.
He got his start in gymnastics fifteen
years ago on a D.C.-area club team. His
success soon landed him on the junior
national squad, and he spent his adoles
cent career traveling and competing in
top-flight national events.
The chance to work with renown Cardi
nal coach Sadao Hamada lured Lynch to
the West coast. "The coaching staff had a
big influence on my decision to come to
Stanford.
Also, you could see a trend of Stanford
starting to build a dynasty. We've been
able to recruit some of the top gymnasts
in the country . . . and now it's starting to
pay off."
It's paid off in the form of a Pacific 10
championship and a second place showing
in the NCAA West Regionals. Lynch led
the Cardinal to a trouncing of rivals
UCLA, California and UC-Santa Barbara
in last month's Pac-10 Tournament with

season-best performances on the vault
(9.75) and high bar (9.85). Two weeks
later at the Regionals, he and his team
mates got a taste of what they would face
this weekend when they finished second
by just one point to Nebraska.
Satisfied, they are not.
"My goal since day one this season has
been to win the national championship.
We had an injury at the end of last season
and just barely came up short," Lynch
said.
The memory of last season's heartbreak
has been driving factor for this year's Car
dinal, and that obviously pleases Lynch.
"I feel like we're really coming together
for this final meet. We are getting healthy
again. Some guys have stopped practicing
all the events, just to concentrate on the
specific events they'll be doing in the
Championships."
Working on specific events is not a lux
ury Lynch has or will ever enjoy. He has
the team's highest average in the all
around and in four out of the six individu
al events. Four of his personal highs are
also Stanford's top single meet bests.
Three of those have been phenomenal
9.90 scores — on the pommel horse, paral
lel bars and floor. As usual, Lynch will be
in the lineup for all six events against
Nebraska and the rest of the NCAA field.
More than a few similarly outstanding
individual performers have been known to
focus on the 'me' and not the 'we.' Not
Lynch.
"When I came from high school to Stan
ford it was a big jump. Before college, gym
nastics really is an individual sport. Since
I've been here I've thrived on the team
aspect of the sport. I've thrived on what
goes on around me, both in a workout and
a meet situation."
Which is why, more than anything, he'd
like to see fifteen years of mental imagery
