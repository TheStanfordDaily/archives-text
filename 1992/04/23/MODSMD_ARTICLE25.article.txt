# A 						Chad bit too far...
## SI columnist belittles women's college sports 
### 
Women's college basketball took a giant step for
ward at this year's Final Four in LA. Although the
first semifinal started at 9:30 a.m. Saturday morn
ing (up against the Bugs Bunny/Roadrunner Show
in the TV ratings contest), the games were being
televised nationally on CBS. The women were final
ly being recognized, it seemed.
But then women's basketball and all of women's
athletics got a slap in the face. Norman Chad, a
columnist for Sports Illustrated, wrote a piece on the
Final Four for the April 13 issue of the magazine
containing an uncalled-for, inane attack against
women's sports.
In the article, Chad discusses how CBS and Duke
became familiar (if somewhat annoying) faces at the
men's Final Four when he abruptly halts his train of
thought and launches into his mini-tirade. He refers
to his aside as a "mild protest," but it certainly
comes across as something other than mild.
He complains about turning on his television

expecting to watch the first men's semifinal game,
but having to watch the end of the Virginia-Stanford
women's game first because it ran late. He has a
valid point that there were quite a few timeouts in
the waning moments of the contest (there were six
TO's in the final 44.4 seconds), but he fails to point
out that it was also an exciting game. Two basketball

powerhouses were slugging it out,
giving a maximum effort to win.
The outcome was undecided until
the final buzzer sounded.
Apparently, Chad was too busy
whining about his precious men's
semifinal to notice that.
The offensive part of the arti
cle, however, is not Chad's point
about games dragging on because
of too many timeouts. Whatever
validity that argument held is
wiped out by his obvious dislike of
women's sports.
"When Sinatra goes on tour,
does the opening act run long?
Hey, if women want to play some

hoops, fine, but not in my living
room on my time on semifinal
Saturday. Nosiree, Bobbie," he
writes. He also calls the men's
games "the real Final Four."
Spare me.
Yes, the men's games are much
more popular nationwide —
that's why they are on in prime
time. But Chad essentially argues
that the women's game is inferior
and doesn't belong on TV, or even
on the court.
His kind of attitude is the
mindset that keeps women's
sports from gaining any amount
of recognition. It is an unneces
sary, senseless tangent to an oth
erwise pretty good article; it is
also insulting to any of the women
who worked so hard to get to
those "opening act" games.

Isn't it sad that college athlet
ics is an area of society where
we've made virtually no progress
in equal rights? When it comes
right down to it, a game is a game.
A women's contest can be just as
exciting and well-played as a
men's matchup— the Virginia-
Stanford contest was a heck of a
lot more thrilling than the Cincin
nati-Michigan semifinal that fol
lowed it. Molly Goodenbour and
Christy Hedgpeth can rain in
three-pointers as well as Duke's
Bobby Hurley can, and they
mouth off a lot less too.
But the fact remains that
female athletes have not been
accepted yet in the mainstream of
athletics. Chad's article reflects
the predominant American atti
tude towards women's sports, and

that needs to change.
Its sad that he thinks that way
and wrote that piece, and it's even
sadder that Sports Illustrated, a
magazine renowned for defending
the black athlete and the environ
ment, would choose to publish it.
