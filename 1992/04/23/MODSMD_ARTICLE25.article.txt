## SI columnist belittles women's college sports 
### 
Women's college basketball took a giant step for
ward at this year's Final Four in LA. Although the
first semifinal started at 9:30 a.m. Saturday morn
ing (up against the Bugs Bunny/Roadrunner Show
in the TV ratings contest), the games were being
televised nationally on CBS. The women were final
ly being recognized, it seemed.
But then women's basketball and all of women's
athletics got a slap in the face. Norman Chad, a
columnist for Sports Illustrated, wrote a piece on the
Final Four for the April 13 issue of the magazine
containing an uncalled-for, inane attack against
women's sports.
In the article, Chad discusses how CBS and Duke
became familiar (if somewhat annoying) faces at the
men's Final Four when he abruptly halts his train of
thought and launches into his mini-tirade. He refers
to his aside as a "mild protest," but it certainly
comes across as something other than mild.
He complains about turning on his television

expecting to watch the first men's semifinal game,
but having to watch the end of the Virginia-Stanford
women's game first because it ran late. He has a
valid point that there were quite a few timeouts in
the waning moments of the contest (there were six
TO's in the final 44.4 seconds), but he fails to point
out that it was also an exciting game. Two basketball
