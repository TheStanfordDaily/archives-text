# Stanford women netters court Pac-10 individual crowns
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior Staff Writer 
Five members of the Stanford women's
tennis team begin quests for the Pacific 10
Conference singles title. While the tourna
ment has no bearing on team records, it may
decide two things — who makes the 64-person
NCAA singles draw and who ultimately wins
the individual crown.
In four of the last five years the Pac-10
titlist has gone on to victory in the NCAA
tourney. Patty Fendick did it in 1987, Debbie
Graham in 1990, and Sandra Birch in 1989
and 1991.
Those Cardinal stars may be followed by
junior Heather Willens or sophomore Laxmi
Poruri. They are the top two seeds, as well as
the No. 3 and No. 4 players in the nation,
respectively.
Despite having problems with her serve,
Willens thrashed Krista Amend, Arizona
State's top player, 6-0, 6-1 Friday. The follow
ing day, she gutted out a three-hour, three-set
victory over Arizona's Danielle Scott, who is
ranked No. 5 in the country.
Willens drew Mary Reilly of Washington in
today's first round and should advance to the sec

ond round, which will be played this afternoon.
Poruri has shown this season that she is a
major threat in college tennis. After a so-so
freshman campaign playing in the bottom half
of the lineup, she has racked up a 21-1 dual
match record at No. 2. Poruri has also cap
tured two tournaments.
In the NorCal Rolex Regionals she beat
teammate Kylie Johnson in the finals and
went on to reach the semifinals of the Rolex
National Indoor Championships before falling
to Harvard's Erika deLone, who is currently
ranked No. 6.
Poruri won the National College Classic in
January, edging Willens in three sets on the
way to the title.
The sophomore's first opponent at Pac-10's is
Arizona's Beth Choate. The Wildcat last played
singles against Stanford in February. At No. 6, she
took but one game off freshman Amy Chiminello.
If Poruri gets by Choate this morning she'll
face either the Sun Devils' Joelle Schad or
USC's Linda Allred.
While Poruri and Willens both have excel
lent shots at taking home the trophy, the tour
nament is important to competitors like
Chiminello for another reason. Ranked No. 65,
Chiminello is probably on the bubble regarding

the NCAA singles tournament. Although the
Volvo Tennis/Collegiate Rankings do not
determine the NCAA field, a few wins at Ojai
could lock up a slot for Chiminello.
However, she has her hands full in the first
round with UCLA's Mamie Ceniza. The Bruin
senior has spent a considerable part of this
season as UCLA's No. 1 player, especially in
the absence of Iwalani McCalla, who has
decided not to compete until NCAA's.
While Chiminello is on the NCAA bubble,
No. 53 Kristine Kurth is likely to get in the
field. However, two losses against the Arizona
schools may hurt her chances. Kurth is almost
fully recovered from a back strain and is trying
to return to form. She will face Arizona's Erica
O'Neill in today's first round.
One of the more intriguing first-round
matchups is the Cardinal's Kylie Johnson
against UCLA's Cammie Foley. The two
clashed last year at the NCAA team finals. In
front of 3,000 people at Stanford Tennis Sta
dium, Johnson beat Foley in a three-setter to
clinch the Cardinal's sixth-straight NCAA
Championship.
It looked like they would have a rematch
when the Bruins visited Stanford in March.
But Johnson had reinjured her back the previ
ous day against USC and had to default the
match against Foley.
If Johnson can capture the rematch repeat
she will likely face California's Lisa Albano in
the second round. Albano was an NCAA final
ist last year and recently upset Willens.
In doubles, Poruri and Willens face USC's
Maggie Simkova and Carla Quaresma.
Chiminello and Mario Carruth battle Arizona
State's Krista Amend and Joelle Schad.
Johnson and Kelly Fisher will compete in
the doubles invitational event. Carruth and
Fisher are entered in the invitational singles
tournament.
Sophomore Emma Woodhouse, who has
been out of the lineup since March, is still
nursing a pulled hamstringl. She is expected
to be healthy in time for the NCAA Champi
onships in May.
Two singles rounds will be played today.
One round will be played Friday and Saturday
and the final is Sunday. Doubles starts tomor
row with two rounds scheduled. The semis
will be on Saturday, the finals on Sunday.

Laxmi Poruri gives her best Michael Jordan impression as she
clubs a backhand return. The sophomore was given the No. 1 seed
in this weekend's Pac-10 Individual Championships at Ojai, Califor
nia.
