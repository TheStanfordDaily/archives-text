# Brennan announces signing of 2 recruits
## 
### 
Two top junior tennis players will join the
Cardinal squad next year. Beth Barris of
Lodi, California and Wendy Sacks of Mem
phis, Tennessee have signed national letters
of intent to attend Stanford.
According to coach Frank Brennan, Bar
ris is the No. 1 recruit in the country. "She
gets high grades from everyone," he said.
Barris wasn't considered a blue-chip
prospect at the 12 or 14 year old levels but
burst on the scene recently. "She was a sec
ond-level player until her first year of 18s.
Then she realized she was as good as every
one else," Brennan said.
Because of her late emergence as a top
junior, Barris was left off the national team, a
squad of juniors who travel and compete

against the world's best young talent. Brennan
thinks the omission may have benefitted her.
"She got to keep going to school," Bren
nan said. "She ended up valedictorian."
Sacks comes to Stanford after training
under Phil Chamberlain, who coached cur
rent Cardinal freshman Kim Shasby.
"Wendy's real nice and she plays well,"
said Brennan adding that Barris and Sacks
have similar styles.
"They are both all-around players and
have similar builds. They have similar
strengths and weaknesses. They have good
serves," said Brennan who cited the net
game as an area they could both work on.
"We'd always like them to come to net
more."
