# Netmen hope to rebound at Ojai
## O'Brien out to defend 1991 title 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
In their final tournament
dress rehearsal before the NCAA
Championships, the top-ranked
men's tennis team begins play
today in the little town of Ojai,
Calif.
The Pacific 10 Conference
Individual Championships will
give the squad one last taste of
tournament tennis before they
head to Georgia in three weeks.
The Cardinal's top five singles
players and top three doubles
teams will compete in the main
draw, while three other players
will vie for wins in the invitation
al bracket.
All Pac-10 schools except Ore
gon and Oregon State will bring
their best players to the tourna
ment.
Iteigning champion Alex
O'Brien, currently ranked second
nationally behind Notre Dame's
David DiLucia, will be fighting to
defend his 1991 title. Last year,
the senior defeated teammates

Jason Yee in the semifinals and
Jon Stark in the finals.
Michael Flanagan, who lost in
the finals of the invitational draw
last year to UCLA's Billy Barber,
will compete in the main draw
this year, along with fellow
sophomores Vimal Patel, Chris
Cocotos and Robert Devens.
In doubles action, O'Brien and
Cocotos, ranked No. 20 national
ly, will enter the field with team
mates Flanagan and Devens
(ranked No. 14).
Yee and Patel will be the Car
dinal's third pair in the main
draw.
Despite last weekend's losses
to UCIJ\ and USC, the Cardinal
men are as positive as ever.
"We're ready to go," said assis
tant coach John Whitlinger. "The
guys are in a good frame of
mind."
With several dual matches left,
the men still have time to smooth
out any wrinkles before postsea
son play. This weekend, however,
will be Stanford's last tourna
ment play before the NCAA's.

"It is definitely a different
change of pace from dual match
es," noted Whitlinger.
The team's main goal this
weekend, besides playing tough
tennis, is to stay healthy. So far,
the team has suffered minimal
injuries and the coaches hope to

keep it that way. "It is important
to come out healthy," Whitlinger
said. "If a guy's in a little bit of
pain we'll probably pull him out
anyway."
The tournament will be benefi
cial for the Cardinal, as players
who do not usually see much

action in dual competition have a
chance to play tough matches and
keep up their mental edge.
Yee, Billy Wright and Roman
Sydorak will be the Cardinal's
representatives in the invita
tional draw. Wright and Sydorak
will also play doubles in this

bracket.
Card notes
Patel made his first appear
ance in the Volvo Tennis Individ
ual Rankings this week, rounding
out the top-100 in the No. 100
slot.
