# Serbs calling for Campbell's ouster
## Demonstration threatened if former Hoover head doesn't go 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
The Bay Area Serbian community is demand
ing the resignation of former Hoover Director W.
Glenn Campbell after he allegedly made racist
remarks to a Serbian visiting scholar at a private
dinner in February.
The Serbian-American Society, based in
Saratoga, has been encouraging its member
ship to write letters protesting Campbell's
anti-Serbian statements at the dinner and
subsequent statements to the press, said
Father Rade Stokich, president of the society.
The Daily has received more than 80 copies of
angry form letters — signed by different people
— sent to Hoover Director John Raisian.
Stokich said the full effect of the letters will
be felt by the end of next week. If Campbell
does not resign, he said the group is prepared to
organize further demonstrations and protests.
Stokich said one of the planned protests is a
demonstration outside Hoover Tower late
next week.
According to Rad Dimitric, a visiting mathe-

matics scholar, the letters
so far represent "only the
tip of the iceberg. A much
bigger campaign is com
mg.
Campbell, who current
ly holds a counselor posi
tion, allegedly told visiting
scholar Srdjan Trifkovic,
"It was too bad if the
Croats killed the Jews but
they should have extermi-

nated the Serbs, so that they would have no
trouble with them today."
When questioned about the remark by
Trifkovic, he allegedly said, "All Serbs were
Nazis anyway."
Although Raisian has banned Campbell
from attending Hoover social events to which
outsiders are invited, Stokich said the society
will not be satisfied until Campbell resigns
and makes a public apology in the newspapers.
Raisian refused to comment on the situa
tion, and Campbell did not return several
phone calls.

Trifkovic could not be reached for com
ment because he was out of the country.
Before his departure he said he was going to
England for two weeks to decide whether he
would stay at Hoover through June, when his
appointment ends.
Raisian also warned Campbell that
stronger measures would follow if he repeated
his behavior. But Serbian community mem
bers say this punishment is not enough.
"He is an obvious Nazi. It came out of every
pore," said Natasha OrlofT. "The comments were
more than just an insult to Trifkovic, they were
an insult to the entire Serbian community."
The letters were originally part of an orga
nized effort, but others were written by inde
pendent, outraged individuals, Stokich said.
Several thousand Serbians live in the Bay
Area and "all of them are very hurt," he said.
The society has copied thousands of letters,
which will be signed and sent to Raisian by
members of the Serbian community. The let
ters will be distributed this Sunday during


Campbell
