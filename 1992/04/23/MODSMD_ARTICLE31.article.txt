# Card cyclists to host time trial, road race
## 
### Christopher Meyers 
This weekend, the Stanford
cycling team hosts its three final
regular season races before they
compete in their conference
championships May 2-3 at UC-
Davis.
On Saturday, approximately
10 squads from California and
Nevada will compete in a criteri
um, a multiple lap event where
the top nine to 15 finishers
(depending 01} their division) earn
team points. The course encom
passes Arguello Way, Serra
Street, and the Serra Complex,
and racing for the four men's and
two women's divisions begins at 9
a.m.
On Sunday, the team will ven
ture south to Morgan Hill, where
they are entered in both a team
time trial and a road race. In the
time trial, four individuals from
the same squad work together
against the clock on a 12 mile
course. The road race, held later
in the day, is a long, gruelling
event, where competitors will
race distances of up to 81 miles.
The Cardinal has met with a
fair amount of success so far this
season, currently ranked fourth
in the conference behind Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo, UC-Berke
ley, and UC-Davis. However, next
week's races weigh heavily in the
scoring system used in determin
ing the overall conference cham
pion, and Stanford still has a
legitimate shot at the title.
The women's team has been
led thus far by senior Becky Wig
glesworth, who is currently vying
for the individual state champi
onship. While Wigglesworth has

been sidelined by injury the past
two weeks, her replacement, Bet
tina Romer, has earned top-three
finishes in her last two races.
The men's 'A' division team
has been spearheaded by the
efforts of Law School student
Frank Scioscia, who has several
wins notched on his handlebars
already, and has been a consistent
contributor in almost every race.
Bob Myers, Jason Tavakolian,
and Coulter Richardson have also
contributed to the team's overall
success to date.
In the men's 'B' division, a
host of riders have stepped up to
take the lead. Tim Bradford and
Andy Tucker have both earned
gold medals for their efforts,
while junior Larry Tsai has been a
real workhorse, finishing in the
top four in every road race this
month.
Although debilitated by
absences and injuries, the men's
'C' team has scored well nonethe
less. Eddie Lim finished an
impressive second at a brutal cri
terium last weekend, while Ken
Batcher earned major "hard
man" points for racing (and con
tributing points) the day after he
suffered a bad crash. Graduate
student Jim Hwang has been the
real backbone of the 'C' squad
through his consistent hard work.
After a somewhat slow start,
the men's 'D' team has come on
strong this month. Grad student
Matthew Ennis and senior Chris
Meyercord have brought home
four gold medals, a silver, and a
bronze in the last six races. In last
Saturday's road race, the two fin
ished 30 seconds ahead of the
competition.
