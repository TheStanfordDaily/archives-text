## Eye-opening black band redefines rock 
### Cheo H. Coker Staff writer 
THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY

Black Rock Coalition founding members
Eye & I aren't simply about a listening expe
rience. Their music is a way of life.
The group "is about life as a black Ameri
can at this period of time — our experience as
black people," said bass player and co
founder Melvin Gibbs in a phone interview.
"There's a lot of brothers talkin' about real
life as far as how hard things are, and there
are other brothers out here telling everybody
how to get their stuff together, and droppin'
African history," he said. "We're dealing
more with assimilating all of this shit and
combining it into a way of life."
Already legendary in New York's hard
rock underground for their riveting live sets,
the band is now on the verge of exploding
nationwide. As an opening act for Ice T's
heavy metal group Body Count, the band is
on a continuing mission to destroy the
stereotypes and artificial limitations placed
on black artists.
The group's sound recalls the legacy of

black rock 'n' roll pioneers like Chuck Berry,
Muddy Waters, Louis Jordan, Bo Diddley,
Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone and Funkadelic. But

black rock 'n' rollers
aren't selling away their
heritage, the group sug
gests — instead, they are
continuing a musical tra
dition that has been
around since the first
slaves arrived in the early
17th century.
Pursuing a career as a
black rock musician, how
ever, isn't quite as simple.

Due largely to ignorance about the firm black
foundation at the roots of rock 'n' roll, the
term "black rock" is considered an oxymoron
for many close-mindcd talent scouts and the
general public. It is a battle that Gibbs and
his band have fought many times in their
effort to become better known.
Because of influential mediums like radio,
which often categorize music, the American
public is familiar only with black musicians
playing dance-oriented music and jazz. Gibbs

The band is on a contin
uing mission to destroy
the stereotypes and arti
ficial limitations placed
on black artists.

blames this narrow-minded view partially on
racism in the music industry, but also on a
recording industry geared to manage mainly

white acts.
"The majority of
America is white," Gibbs
said. "America's about
makin' money. It's also
about racism, but racism
takes a back seat to
money every time. And
you make more money
in America dealing with
a white face."
Only now has the

success of other Black Rock Coalition groups
like Living Colour, Follow For Now, Fish
bone and 24-7 Spyz convinced record compa
nies what the black music underground has
known for a long time: black rock is very
much for real. The market exists, but it just
hasn't been tapped.
"It wasn't a problem [for black rock acts to
get signed to major labels) musically, because
there are people at record companies who do
actually like the music," Gibbs said.

But the way the companies "are structured
to make money," he added, "doesn't allow
them to do certain shit. And somebody has to
just make a decision to take a chance, to say
we're gonna do this, and we're gonna make it
work."
Making it work is exactly what Eye & I
does with their impressive live shows and
their slammin' debut album. Driven by the
powerful voice of the beautiful lead singer DK
Dyson (this sista can sing her ass off!), the
band's music explodes the ear drums with its
kinetic energy. Elements of rock, funk, reg
gae, and hip-hop all end up in the mix, com
bining all of the important elements of the
black musical experience into one coherent
package.
The songs on the LP are incredibly versa
tile,- there's enough genre-mixing to keep the
listener on his toes. "I Ain't Low" starts off as
a heavy metal song, has a smooth jazz break
down, and ends up as kickin' hip-hop song.
Other songs worth mentioning are the
thrash-inspircd "Prisoner in Babylon", and

the funk-flavored social com
mentary of "Don't Just Say
Peace." The band's theme song, a
brilliant cover version of Velvet
Underground's "Venus in Furs,"
lends even more to the group's
eclectic reputation.
"A couple of years ago, mutha
fuckas just really didn't get what
the band was about," said Gibbs.
"They were like, 'Ah — they're
not really a rock band, and
they're not really a funk band, so
what the fuck are they?' So I just
decided that we needed a really
good cover tunc ("Venus In
Furs") so people could say 'Oh,
that's what they are.' "
Gibbs plays his bass as if his
life depended on it, slappin' out
melodic riffs like a brawny, bald

headed Bootsy Collins. Gary
Poulson adds Hendrix-like riffs
to the fray, backed up by the riv
eting hip-hop drumming tech
niques of Richie Harrison, whose
style is reminiscent of skinmen
like Zigaboo of the Meters and
Clyde Stubblefield of the J.B.'s.
The youngest member of the
group, j-Logic, smooths things
out with his turntables, adding
cutting and scratching to the mix
that somehow fills things out
perfectly. Breakbeats and distort
ed voices come out of nowhere
on many of the album cuts,
appearing and disappearing at
just the right time.
"My turntable's like an instru
ment," J-Logic said. "The ideas
just come to me. If I put some
thing on, sometimes they don't
like it, but then I'll add some fla

vor to it."
About J-Logic ; Gibbs also con
cluded that having a DJ adds
something. "You gotta whole
'nother band ... A couple of
other bands have DJ's, but my DJ
is definitely the best one."
Eye & I is a band with a bright
future. With an opening slot on
Ziggy Marley's next tour, the
group will reach an even larger
audience. The debut album is
only a small (but very tasty) sam
ple of what the band has in store.
"A band can really get locked
into a sound," Gibbs said. "We
really wanted to make sure that
this shit has somewhere to go, so
when you listen to this record three
or fou" years down the line and
compare it. .. .you're like 'Damn,
these muthafuckas went from here
to here.' This is just an intro."

bining all of the important elements of the
black musical experience into one coherent
package.
The songs on the LP are incredibly versa
tile,- there's enough genre-mixing to keep the
listener on his toes. "I Ain't Low" starts off as
a heavy metal song, has a smooth jazz break
down, and ends up as kickin' hip-hop song.
Other songs worth mentioning are the
thrash-inspircd "Prisoner in Babylon", and

the funk-flavored social com
mentary of "Don't Just Say
Peace." The band's theme song, a
brilliant cover version of Velvet
Underground's "Venus in Furs,"
lends even more to the group's
eclectic reputation.
"A couple of years ago, mutha
fuckas just really didn't get what
the band was about," said Gibbs.
"They were like, 'Ah — they're
not really a rock band, and
they're not really a funk band, so
what the fuck are they?' So I just
decided that we needed a really
good cover tunc ("Venus In
Furs") so people could say 'Oh,
that's what they are.' "
Gibbs plays his bass as if his
life depended on it, slappin' out
melodic riffs like a brawny, bald

headed Bootsy Collins. Gary
Poulson adds Hendrix-like riffs
to the fray, backed up by the riv
eting hip-hop drumming tech
niques of Richie Harrison, whose
style is reminiscent of skinmen
like Zigaboo of the Meters and
Clyde Stubblefield of the J.B.'s.
The youngest member of the
group, j-Logic, smooths things
out with his turntables, adding
cutting and scratching to the mix
that somehow fills things out
perfectly. Breakbeats and distort
ed voices come out of nowhere
on many of the album cuts,
appearing and disappearing at
just the right time.
"My turntable's like an instru
ment," J-Logic said. "The ideas
just come to me. If I put some
thing on, sometimes they don't
like it, but then I'll add some fla

vor to it."
About J-Logic ; Gibbs also con
cluded that having a DJ adds
something. "You gotta whole
'nother band ... A couple of
other bands have DJ's, but my DJ
is definitely the best one."
Eye & I is a band with a bright
future. With an opening slot on
Ziggy Marley's next tour, the
group will reach an even larger
audience. The debut album is
only a small (but very tasty) sam
ple of what the band has in store.
"A band can really get locked
into a sound," Gibbs said. "We
really wanted to make sure that
this shit has somewhere to go, so
when you listen to this record three
or fou" years down the line and
compare it. .. .you're like 'Damn,
these muthafuckas went from here
to here.' This is just an intro."

Black rock band Eye & I is on verge of exploding into national prominence. On their current tour,
they are opening for Ice-T's heavy metal band Body Count.
THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY

Black Rock Coalition founding members
Eye & I aren't simply about a listening expe
rience. Their music is a way of life.
The group "is about life as a black Ameri
can at this period of time — our experience as
black people," said bass player and co
founder Melvin Gibbs in a phone interview.
"There's a lot of brothers talkin' about real
life as far as how hard things are, and there
are other brothers out here telling everybody
how to get their stuff together, and droppin'
African history," he said. "We're dealing
more with assimilating all of this shit and
combining it into a way of life."
Already legendary in New York's hard
rock underground for their riveting live sets,
the band is now on the verge of exploding
nationwide. As an opening act for Ice T's
heavy metal group Body Count, the band is
on a continuing mission to destroy the
stereotypes and artificial limitations placed
on black artists.
The group's sound recalls the legacy of

black rock 'n' roll pioneers like Chuck Berry,
Muddy Waters, Louis Jordan, Bo Diddley,
Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone and Funkadelic. But

black rock 'n' rollers
aren't selling away their
heritage, the group sug
gests — instead, they are
continuing a musical tra
dition that has been
around since the first
slaves arrived in the early
17th century.
Pursuing a career as a
black rock musician, how
ever, isn't quite as simple.

Due largely to ignorance about the firm black
foundation at the roots of rock 'n' roll, the
term "black rock" is considered an oxymoron
for many close-mindcd talent scouts and the
general public. It is a battle that Gibbs and
his band have fought many times in their
effort to become better known.
Because of influential mediums like radio,
which often categorize music, the American
public is familiar only with black musicians
playing dance-oriented music and jazz. Gibbs

The band is on a contin
uing mission to destroy
the stereotypes and arti
ficial limitations placed
on black artists.

blames this narrow-minded view partially on
racism in the music industry, but also on a
recording industry geared to manage mainly

white acts.
"The majority of
America is white," Gibbs
said. "America's about
makin' money. It's also
about racism, but racism
takes a back seat to
money every time. And
you make more money
in America dealing with
a white face."
Only now has the

success of other Black Rock Coalition groups
like Living Colour, Follow For Now, Fish
bone and 24-7 Spyz convinced record compa
nies what the black music underground has
known for a long time: black rock is very
much for real. The market exists, but it just
hasn't been tapped.
"It wasn't a problem [for black rock acts to
get signed to major labels) musically, because
there are people at record companies who do
actually like the music," Gibbs said.

But the way the companies "are structured
to make money," he added, "doesn't allow
them to do certain shit. And somebody has to
just make a decision to take a chance, to say
we're gonna do this, and we're gonna make it
work."
Making it work is exactly what Eye & I
does with their impressive live shows and
their slammin' debut album. Driven by the
powerful voice of the beautiful lead singer DK
Dyson (this sista can sing her ass off!), the
band's music explodes the ear drums with its
kinetic energy. Elements of rock, funk, reg
gae, and hip-hop all end up in the mix, com
