# Playing 'Forbidden'
## 
### Jonathan Lim 
The one in black is plagued by his conscience. The
one in white seeks only the thrill of power. Togeth
er, they roll human lives like dice.

There were three of them.
One wore nothing and sat at a
table in front of an object resem
bling a monitor. One wore black
and paced around the room in
nervous steps. One wore white
and stood behind the one by the
monitor, scrutinizing the color
ful images that shimmered

across the screen.
"Pan left, Mach," the one in
white said softly. The naked one
at the monitor responded by
closing his eyes. The bulges
under his eyelids moved to the
left, causing the images on the
screen to move to the left.
"Stop. Now pan right a lit
tle. . . ." The bulges under
Mach's eyelids moved to the
right. "Hold it there. What do
you think, friend?" the one in
white asked the one in black.
The one in black stopped pac
ing and glanced briefly at the

screen.
"You know what I think. Can
we stop playing now? I don't feel
good about this. . . . And neither
does Mach, for that matter."
The one in white smiled at
this. "You know how Mach
feels." This was all he needed to
say. Mach felt nothing.
The one in black began to
pace again. "Can I ask you a
question, Phoe?" He paused in
mid-stride. "Are you going to
give Mach back like we original
ly intended?"
"That's impossible, friend.
I've grown too attached."
"But I thought we had agreed
tliis was a temporary arrange
ment."
This remark apparently went
unheeded. Phoe, the one in
white, was riveted to the screen.
"Did you hear me? We agreed
this was temporary," the one in
black insisted.
"Once again," the one in
white said, turning slowly
towards his friend. "I've grown
too attached."
A glint of emotion crossed
the face of the one in black, but
quickly dissipated as a new
thought entered his mind.
"Mach doesn't want to stay,

does he?" he said, grinning tri
umphantly.
The one in white looked at his
friend, then said something under
his breath — it was barely a whisper.
"What? I'm sorry, I didn't hear
what you said. . . ." The one in
black stopped smiling and leaned
closer to his companion.
The one in white had the habit
of speaking softly, forcing others to
listen carefully to what he had to
say. The one in black knew this
was Phoe's way of being in control
of his conversations.
"Do you want to stay?" the one
in white repeated, audibly this
time, to the one in black.
"I don't have a choice. You
should know that better than any
one. But don't change the subject.
My point is, if Mach doesn't want
to stay, he can't stay. Those are
the Rules."
Phoe's face changed color, set
tling on a dark shade of crimson.
"Look, friend. I am tired of listen
ing to your complaints — one

word, and I can send you back. Do
not tempt me."
His face lightened as a new
thought occurred to him. "If you care
so much about Mach's fate, why
don't we settle it with a little wager."
The one in black was silent.
Phoe read this as acquiescence.
"It is time to play 'The Forbid
den.'"
The one in black paled at the
sound of these words. "You can't
be serious! We'll never get away
with it."
The one in black knew that
Phoe would be held responsible if
anything went wrong, but still he
felt uneasy. What they were doing
— tampering with the very fabric
of a person's life — was an act
reserved for the Master himself.
"You know the object of the
Game," Phoe said, ignoring his
friend's objections, "so let's begin.
Mach, pull out the file."
Mach closed his eyes. There
were movements under his eyelids.
A faint luminescence took
shape in the middle of the screen.
As it steadily grew, it began to
change shape, and colors began to
appear. Like the pages of a book,
images of people's faces flashed by

in rapid succession on the screen.
The one in black, who had been
watching the screen intently up to
this point, closed his eyes. He
didn't like the job of choosing, so
he decided to do it randomly, with
out looking at the person's face.
After a brief period of silence, he
said, "Stop." When he looked up,
the face of a handsome young man
hovered on the screen. "There,
Phoe, our 'Voluntary Human Sub
ject' has been chosen. Let the
Game begin."
"Play, Mach," Phoe demanded.
"And play it in fast mode so we
can avoid the boring details."
Mach closed his eyes again.
The image of the young man's face
dissolved into a new image, which
filled the screen. This time, the
man was sitting at a desk in what
seemed to be a library.
Bill was at the checkout counter
talking with a girl named Lisa.
Apparently he had said something
funny because Lisa was laughing.
The two of them seemed to be get
ting along very well. Then Bill said
goodbye and walked back to his
desk, where he resumed studying.
But his attention was divided
between reading his book and
watching Lisa work.
Later, a tall man walked up to
Lisa and asked her if she could
help him find a book. She nodded
and followed him up the stairs. Bill
followed and caught up with them
in time to catch the man, who had
led Lisa to a remote area, grabbing
Lisa's arm. Bill intervened just in
time to pull Lisa away from him.
"That's it, I win!" The one in
black clapped gleefully.
"What do you mean, you win?
He hasn't done anything," the one
in white countered.
"The Rule is, if the Subject per
forms an act of altruism, I win."
"That was no act of altruism,"
Phoe protested. "We both know
what Bill really is after, and, for
that matter, has been after all
night. Play, Mach."
Mach's face tightened into an
expression of pain. He struggled as
Phoe and the one in black contin
ued their game.

Mach closed his eyes again.
The image of the young man's face
dissolved into a new image, which
filled the screen. This time, the
man was sitting at a desk in what
seemed to be a library.
Bill was at the checkout counter
talking with a girl named Lisa.
Apparently he had said something
funny because Lisa was laughing.
The two of them seemed to be get
ting along very well. Then Bill said
goodbye and walked back to his
desk, where he resumed studying.
But his attention was divided
between reading his book and
watching Lisa work.
Later, a tall man walked up to
Lisa and asked her if she could
help him find a book. She nodded
and followed him up the stairs. Bill
followed and caught up with them
in time to catch the man, who had
led Lisa to a remote area, grabbing
Lisa's arm. Bill intervened just in
time to pull Lisa away from him.
"That's it, I win!" The one in
black clapped gleefully.
"What do you mean, you win?
He hasn't done anything," the one
in white countered.
"The Rule is, if the Subject per
forms an act of altruism, I win."
"That was no act of altruism,"
Phoe protested. "We both know
what Bill really is after, and, for
that matter, has been after all
night. Play, Mach."
Mach's face tightened into an
expression of pain. He struggled as
Phoe and the one in black contin
ued their game.


Joe Beltran — Daily
The one in black is plagued by his conscience. The
one in white seeks only the thrill of power. Togeth
er, they roll human lives like dice.

There were three of them.
One wore nothing and sat at a
table in front of an object resem
bling a monitor. One wore black
and paced around the room in
nervous steps. One wore white
and stood behind the one by the
monitor, scrutinizing the color
ful images that shimmered

across the screen.
"Pan left, Mach," the one in
white said softly. The naked one
at the monitor responded by
closing his eyes. The bulges
under his eyelids moved to the
left, causing the images on the
screen to move to the left.
"Stop. Now pan right a lit
tle. . . ." The bulges under
Mach's eyelids moved to the
right. "Hold it there. What do
you think, friend?" the one in
white asked the one in black.
The one in black stopped pac
ing and glanced briefly at the

screen.
"You know what I think. Can
we stop playing now? I don't feel
good about this. . . . And neither
does Mach, for that matter."
The one in white smiled at
this. "You know how Mach
feels." This was all he needed to
say. Mach felt nothing.
The one in black began to
pace again. "Can I ask you a
question, Phoe?" He paused in
mid-stride. "Are you going to
give Mach back like we original
ly intended?"
"That's impossible, friend.
I've grown too attached."
"But I thought we had agreed
tliis was a temporary arrange
ment."
This remark apparently went
unheeded. Phoe, the one in
white, was riveted to the screen.
"Did you hear me? We agreed
this was temporary," the one in
black insisted.
"Once again," the one in
white said, turning slowly
towards his friend. "I've grown
too attached."
A glint of emotion crossed
the face of the one in black, but
quickly dissipated as a new
thought entered his mind.
"Mach doesn't want to stay,

does he?" he said, grinning tri
umphantly.
The one in white looked at his
friend, then said something under
his breath — it was barely a whisper.
"What? I'm sorry, I didn't hear
what you said. . . ." The one in
black stopped smiling and leaned
closer to his companion.
The one in white had the habit
of speaking softly, forcing others to
listen carefully to what he had to
say. The one in black knew this
was Phoe's way of being in control
of his conversations.
"Do you want to stay?" the one
in white repeated, audibly this
time, to the one in black.
"I don't have a choice. You
should know that better than any
one. But don't change the subject.
My point is, if Mach doesn't want
to stay, he can't stay. Those are
the Rules."
Phoe's face changed color, set
tling on a dark shade of crimson.
"Look, friend. I am tired of listen
ing to your complaints — one

word, and I can send you back. Do
not tempt me."
His face lightened as a new
thought occurred to him. "If you care
so much about Mach's fate, why
don't we settle it with a little wager."
The one in black was silent.
Phoe read this as acquiescence.
"It is time to play 'The Forbid
den.'"
The one in black paled at the
sound of these words. "You can't
be serious! We'll never get away
with it."
The one in black knew that
Phoe would be held responsible if
anything went wrong, but still he
felt uneasy. What they were doing
— tampering with the very fabric
of a person's life — was an act
reserved for the Master himself.
"You know the object of the
Game," Phoe said, ignoring his
friend's objections, "so let's begin.
Mach, pull out the file."
Mach closed his eyes. There
were movements under his eyelids.
A faint luminescence took
shape in the middle of the screen.
As it steadily grew, it began to
change shape, and colors began to
appear. Like the pages of a book,
images of people's faces flashed by

in rapid succession on the screen.
The one in black, who had been
watching the screen intently up to
this point, closed his eyes. He
didn't like the job of choosing, so
he decided to do it randomly, with
out looking at the person's face.
After a brief period of silence, he
said, "Stop." When he looked up,
the face of a handsome young man
hovered on the screen. "There,
Phoe, our 'Voluntary Human Sub
ject' has been chosen. Let the
Game begin."
"Play, Mach," Phoe demanded.
"And play it in fast mode so we
can avoid the boring details."
Mach closed his eyes again.
The image of the young man's face
dissolved into a new image, which
