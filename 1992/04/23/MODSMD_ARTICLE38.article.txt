# A
						stirring drama, 'Good' lives up to its name
## 
### Travis Farr 
S.S. officer and dedicated Nazi
John Haider knows in his heart
that he's a good man. Haider, a
man caught between principle and
self-preservation in early Nazi Ger
many, is the main character of

C.P. Taylor's play "Good," an
American Conservatory Theater
production currently playing in
San Francisco.
"Good" is a stirring and intense
work that follows the story of how
one man's life is affected by the
political events of 1930s Ger

many. It conveys a sense of the
incredible power of the coercive
forces of an entire society and of
the futility of individual resistance.
In 1933, the Nazis are just
coming to power, and Haider,
played by movie star William
Hurt, is a university literature pro
fessor ripe for a mid-life crisis.
He isn't exactly unhappy, but
his aging mother, his basket-case
wife and a general melancholy,
cause him to regard his life as a
black comedy. Hurt's slow speech
and often vacant looks effectively
convey John's detachedness.
The audience sees the events of
the play through John's mind. If he
happens to think of his mother
while he is talking to a Nazi offi
cial, then she comes creaking
across the stage in her wheelchair.
To deal with stress, John's psyche
sets crises to music: his wife's nag
ging, for example, becomes a Wag
nerian opera.
The scenes are shown in a ran
dom sequence, which gives the
impression that we are seeing
events as John remembers them
rather than as they actually
occurred. The whole muddled for
mat gives the audience a sense of
confusion and of being swept along
by uncontrollable and powerful
events, the same emotions John is
feeling.
Although he disagrees with
much of the Nazi doctrine, John
submits to familial pressure to
become an S.S. officer, convinced
that he will be able to change the
party from the inside. But as
events continue to unfold in Ger
many, the Nazis ask more and
more of John, who always com

plies, gradually losing himself in
the hysteria of the times.
Taylor shows compellingly how
hard it is for one person to stand
against the prevailing attitude of a
nation or a period. John Haider is
not meant to be too harshly criti
cized. He did what Taylor believes

Although he disagrees
with much of the Nazi
doctrine, John submits
to familial pressure to
become an S.S. officer.

most people would do in the same
circumstances.
By using the Nazi example, the
playwright makes the point that
even though resistance to society's
coercion is difficult, it is vital to
the peace and safety of humanity.
The principal strength of
"Good" is the script itself,
enhanced by the acting of Hurt
and the rest of the cast. Although
the expense and time required to
see a play in San Francisco will
probably keep it out of your Friday
night plans, it is an excellent
choice if you're in the mood for
quality theater.

"Good," an American Conservato
ry Theater production, is playing
at the Stage Door Theater on
Mason Street in San Francisco
through June 6, with show times
throughout the week. Tickets start
at $11; call 749-2228 for more
information.
