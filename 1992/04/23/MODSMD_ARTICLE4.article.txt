# Cost battle enjoys calm before storm
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
With Stanford's financial future
hanging in the balance, the indi
rect-cost battle has been ominously
silent in recent weeks as both the
University and the Navy gear up
for an impending legal battle.
The lack of public announce
ments does not mean that nothing
is happening in the indirect-cost
controversy â€” despite statements
to the contrary from both sides.
"There is not much to report,"
said Larry Horton, associate vice
president for public affairs. "There
have been no significant changes
in the past several weeks."
Mark Whetstone, public affairs

officer for the Office of Naval
Research, echoed Horton's assess
ment of the situation. "Not much
is happening right now," he said.
But lawyers and auditors are
hard at work preparing for Stan
ford's legal appeal, filed with the
Armed Services Board of Contract
Appeals. The University is protest
ing the Navy's abrupt reduction of
its indirect-cost rate last April.
The reduced rate of 55.5 per
cent has cost the University
roughly $28 million per year and
was the biggest factor behind the
recently-concluded $43 million
deficit-reduction process.
"We are still at our current
position" in the appeals process,
Horton said. The only motion filed

to this point is an inch-thick docu
ment from the University explain
ing why the board of appeals has
jurisdiction over the Stanford case.
Whetstone declined to com
ment on the appeal, but an
administrator at the appeals
board confirmed that the Navy
has not yet filed any substantive
response in what is expected to be
at least an 18-month process.
In addition to the appeal, Stan
ford is preparing a response to the
Defense Contract Audit Agency
study released in January claim
ing that the University over
charged the government by more
than $300 million in indirect costs
during the 1980s.
The audit agency's report has

not yet been acted on by the Navy,
according to Whetstone, because
the University has not had a
chance to respond.
Horton said Stanford is "in the
normal process of responding" to
the allegations. Although he did
not specify a time frame, it is like
ly that some kind of University
statement on the audit will be
released soon.
The biggest questions in the
continuing saga, however, sur
round negotiations of future indi
rect-cost rates.
The University and Navy are
still negotiating a rate for this year.
