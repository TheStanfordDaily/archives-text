# Festival shows world's best
## 
### Ed Heinemann Staff writer 
When was the last time you saw a great movie?
And no, "Wayne's World" doesn't count.
I mean the kind of movie that makes you think,
more or less, that speaks to your brain, rather than
your "heart" or genitals; that makes you both deliri
ously happy and existentially depressed; that makes it
difficult to think about anything else for a couple of
days.
That's what the movie-watching experience
should yield, at its highest, but it's a realm that Hol
lywood has abandoned — if it ever really occupied it.
Mainstream movies are about one thing: money, and,
more specifically, how precisely to line the pockets of
studio heads, directors and actors with more of it.
"Thelma and Louise," "Barton Fink" and "Silence
of the Lambs," to name three of 1991's most critical
ly acclaimed films, were all enjoyable, but were all, in
the end, slick pop vehicles with nothing much to say.
These films may seem fine, but try imagining
Stephen King and the guy who wrote "All I Ever Need
ed to Know I Learned In Kindergarten" vying for the
Pulitzer Prize in literature, and you'll see what I'm
getting at.
The best film makers have the potential to equal
the best novelists and poets in their artistry, if they
give a shit, and the 35th San Francisco International
Film Festival (SFIFF), running today through May 7,
seems designed to show, at least for a couple of
weeks, that two or three shits are actually being given.
Film festivals certainly fall prey to Hollywood

Hype — Cannes is an annual joke, and the venerable
SFIFF itself is flying in Geena Davis this year to give
her an award and draw more press — but are also the
prime antidote to all that is shallow in the world of
film.
Festivals regularly provide the only opportunity to
see films that are better than anything in wide release
in the United States in the last decade, films that
flounder either because they are independent, or for
eign, or too intelligent, or all of the above.
Most of the films are by young, unknown direc
tors, but many, sadly enough, are by old, quite her
alded wizards. Satyajit Ray? Who? Ray, a Bengali
director who will receive the 1992 Akira Kurosawa
Award for lifetime achievement from the SFIFF, is
only considered among the two or three best directors
ever. And no one outside of festival junkies has ever
heard of him.
One of the highlights of the festival will be a rare
opportunity to see Ray's masterpiece, The Apu Trilo
gy, a series of films chronicling the lives of a poor
Brahmin family in turn-of-the-century Bengal.
Reviewers have compared the films to "King Lear" —
in quality as much as in content — and claimed that
they contain "some of the most moving scenes ever
filmed."
Ray's films are just a start, of course. More than
100 films will be screened in three locations —
including Palo Alto Square — and their diversity is
astonishing. Like any self-respecting festival, the for
eign quotient is high — 41 foreign countries are rep-
resented — but the range of Amer
ican films is equally impressive.
Skip high-profile publicity gim
micks like Robert Altman's "The
Player" — which will be in wide
release next month anyway — and
the Rolling Stones in IMAX, and
head for "Black to the Promised
Land," a documentary about 11
black teenagers from Brooklyn
who go to Israel and live on a kib
butz for 10 weeks.
The festival in general shows a
genuine concern with difficult
issues of race that is entirely lack
ing from more mainstream fare.
"Tribulation 99: Alien Anoma
lies Under America,"for one, is a
postmodern blitzkrieg of rage and
images, rewriting the history of
alien intervention in Latin Ameri
ca in 49 minutes. "Color Adjust

ment: Blacks in Prime Time/'
meanwhile, shows how the roles of
blacks in television have evolved
over the last 45 years.

The festival in gen
eral shows a gen
uine concern with
difficult issues of
race that is entirely
lacking from more
mainstream fare.

Less controversial, but no less
spectacular choices include "The
Actress/' a maybe-documentary
maybe-drama that explores the
brief life of Chinese silent film star
Ruan Ling Yu ; Jean-Luc Godard's
decidedly non-traditional "His
toire(s) du Cinema"; Eric Rohmer's

devastating "Conte de Printemps";
"Trys Dienos" ("Three Days") by
Lithuanian Sarunas Bartas, a
drama with virtually no dialogue,-
and "Zentropa," a sprawling, stylis
tically astonishing story of a young
American's adventures in post-war
Europe.
It probably doesn't even matter
which film you see; just make an
effort to see at least one, if only to
restore your faith in the possibili
ties of film as a medium — and
make you more cynical about the
pap Hollywood tries to pass off as
good.
