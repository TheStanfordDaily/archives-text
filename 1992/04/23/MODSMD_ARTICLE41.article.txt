# McFerrin, Ma collaborate on quirky CD
## 
### Russell Hancock 
Here's a case of opposites
attracting — consummate classical
cellist Yo-Yo Ma and wacky jazz
vocalist Bobby McFerrin. Together
the two have released "Hush," a
compact disc that includes both
classical works and original com
positions by McFerrin.
Ma was educated at Harvard
and trained at Juillard; McFerrin
dropped out of Cal State Sacra
mento. Ma records with Isaac
Stern,- McFerrin works with Jack
Nicholson and Meredith Monk.
Ma won Grammy awards for his
recordings of Dvorak and Saint-
Saens; McFerrin earned three
Grammies for "Don't Worry Be
Happy," the 1988 No. 1 hit that
George Bush tried to exploit in his
campaign.
But these two musicians have
been branching creatively toward
each other for some time. McFer
rin celebrated his 40th birthday by
conducting the San Francisco
Symphony in Beethoven's 7th
Symphony. Ma made his first
foray into jazz three years ago by

releasing "Anything Goes," a col
laborative Cole Porter project with
jazz violinist Stephane Grappelli.
It's not surprising, then, that
McFerrin and Ma struck up
instant chemistry at their chance

"Hush" is an intimate dialogue of
two masters leading each other
through unfamiliar territory.

meeting at Leonard Bernstein's
70th birthday celebration in 1988.
"Hush," released this year on Sony
Masterworks, is the first fruit of
their unusual friendship.
To their credit, the artists resist
any temptation to reverse roles.
Ma is still a reluctant, awkward
improviser, and McFerrin doesn't
have any classical pretensions.
Instead, "Hush" is an intimate
dialogue of two masters leading
each other through unfamiliar ter
ritory. The result is a good-natured

tete-a-tete which, depending on
your point of view, is either a high
ly engaging novelty item or a
quirky success.
There are grounds for skepti
cism. Sure, it's fun to see these two

team up for Rimsky-Korsakov's
"Flight of the Bumblebee" on the
Johnny Carson show. But Vivaldi?
Rachmaninoff? For 46 minutes?
Purists will quibble especially
with the use of multi-tracked vocal
backgrounds against Ma's long
lines. Doesn't studio wizardry vio
late the spirit of this collaboration?
The central question is whether
it is effective to cast McFerrin's
lone voice in percussive, textural
roles, opposite Ma's lyrical cello.
The answer, after 13 diverse

tracks, is that this juxtaposition is
interesting, if not compelling.
But "Hush," however quirky,
does succeed. For one thing, dia
logue like this is priceless. The
music world needs more of it, not
less. And "Hush" is no mere
crossover attempt: it is two master
artists alternating jazz and classi
cal idioms in a manner that is
more elegant than capricious.
The McFcrrin-led tracks are
mesmerizing with their flowing
impressionism and irregular meter.
The Ma-led tracks are sparse but
graceful accounts of well-worn
classical literature. And the chem
istry — their joyful, undisputable
chemistry — is in and of itself a
treasure for any listener.
"Hush," the liner notes say, was
originally conceivcd as a disc for
children. The original tracks in par
ticular have a clean simplicity that
will appeal to children. Recording
and mixing engineer Chris Terge
sen has done nothing (save perhaps
the multi-tracking) to rob the disc
of its spare quality. Both cello and
voice arc richly defined.
But listeners will agree that this

work is more than child's fare. By
managing to be both simple and
complex at the same time, "Hush"
is a legitimate statement of duali

ty, a serious yet humorous attempt
at musical synthesis. It is that
paradox that gives this disc the
stamp of genius.

The McFcrrin-led tracks are
mesmerizing with their flowing
impressionism and irregular meter.
The Ma-led tracks are sparse but
graceful accounts of well-worn
classical literature. And the chem
istry — their joyful, undisputable
chemistry — is in and of itself a
treasure for any listener.
"Hush," the liner notes say, was
originally conceivcd as a disc for
children. The original tracks in par
ticular have a clean simplicity that
will appeal to children. Recording
and mixing engineer Chris Terge
sen has done nothing (save perhaps
the multi-tracking) to rob the disc
of its spare quality. Both cello and
voice arc richly defined.
But listeners will agree that this

work is more than child's fare. By
managing to be both simple and
complex at the same time, "Hush"
is a legitimate statement of duali

ty, a serious yet humorous attempt
at musical synthesis. It is that
paradox that gives this disc the
stamp of genius.
