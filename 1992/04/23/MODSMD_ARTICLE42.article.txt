# Humor /Dance
## A 						veritable cornycopia of laughs 
### 
By the time you read this, I'll long
have been put to death in Califor
nia's gas chamber.
Ah ha ha, just kidding. I know what
you're thinking: "Oh that Harris kid;
what a gas." But don't worry: it's not me
or even an immediate family member
who got killed. That's Robert Alton Har
ris. I know I shouldn't make fun of a
dead guy, but . . . imagine the ending of
his own "Waltons"-type show, called
"The Altons":
"G'night, Robert."
"G'night, Robert."
"G'night, Robert."
"G'night, Robert."
And so forth. After all this guy's free
publicity, he could probably run for U.C.
president — maybe under a "Put the
'execute' back in the executive branch"
platform. Of course, the press confer
ence could be harsh:
"Mr. Harris, do you have what it
takes to run a country?"
"Sure, I've got a lot of conviction. . .s.
Besides, running a country is like run
ning a business, and in my last business
I, uh, made a killing."
"Anonymous sources say you were
once in a gas chamber. Is that true?"
"Well, yes . . . but I didn't inhale."
And of course, the more traditional
Robert Alton Harris jokes should crop
up soon:
What do you call giving R.A.H. the
Heimlich maneuver? — Pumping gas.
Why did R.A.H. go bankrupt? — Cal
ifornia raised the gas tax.
What do you call R.A.H. with a
cigarette? — A bomb.
But enough with this RAH sense of
humor; it's a dead subject.
Anyway, this is my last column; I'm
trading in my word processor for a . . .
word processor, actually, and working
full-time on a book from here on in.
If there was ever a point to my arti
cles, I suppose it was this: Never judge a
column by the cheesy mug-shot.
But if we shot from the two-point
range, I'd also say this: English is really
an incredible language,- what would we
do without it?
Speak German, probably. But it
wouldn't be as fun. After all, what lan
guage but English has so many won
drous twists and turns, so many nooks
and crannies to explore? Certainly no
other that I'm fluent in (bold statement).
English has, for example:
Similar phrases with similar mean
ings, like "throw a party" and "throw up
hearty ..."
Similar phrases with different mean
ings, like "hi-fi" and "Pi-Phi" (the hi-fi
you try to tune in) .. .
Different phrases with different
meanings, like "Is this your chinchilla?"

and "Sno-Caps are delicious!"
For the past couple years, I've kept a
file of random dumb puns and one-lin
ers that I'd try to use in my columns.
Not everything made the cut. As a fitting
close, but actually because I'm sick of
writing, here's what's left over from that
file.
Presenting "The Worst of Chris Har
ris" — all the snippets and quips that I
never used. Just groan and bear it. . .
"That young man keeps hitting us
with his soft football!" — "Maybe it's
just a Nerf-us habit."
My roommate ran in a race and got a
trophy. I stayed indoors the whole day
and all I got was atrophy.
Cartoon idea: Frosh kneeling in a
stall, pouring a beer into the toilet. Cap
tion: "I hate being the middle-man."
Carl Sagan for McDonald's: "Billions
upon billions served."
Tiffany's graduation theme: "I think
we're alum now . . ."
Warning to a clothes shopper: "Let
the buyer be wearer."
We keep trying to make Stanford
multicultural, but aren't university and
diversity mutually exclusive?
Irony of the German language:
"Pleasing" comments can leave you with
a "bitte" taste in your mouth.
Tried writing a column once about
"s-words"; those are words that become
their opposite if you add another "s."
For example, "hotel," a clean, profes
sional place with private rooms, turns
into "hostel," a cheap, dirty sty for
skimping backpackers.
Likewise, "wet" changes to "west"
and the "Beatles" become "beatless." I
scratched the idea, though, once I real
ized that my normal humor is better
than this new kind. As they say, the pun
is mightier than the s-word.
Frat with a bad rep: Stigma Chi?
The chief problem Tyson had, despite
claims that his profession affected his
judgment, came not so much from play
ing around with boxers as from playing
around without them.
"Of this be certain,- my deeds ring of
altruism." — "Aye, and thy words of
not-truisms."
Lousy newspaper comic idea: Little

boy who plays around with a coffee cake
that talks to him whenever he's alone:
"Calvin & Hobee's"?
Has a person who took a certain burg
er from the grill staked a claim, or
claimed a steak?
" 'Stick up' for burglar rights!/easier
limbosl/ceiling glue . . Ah, never
mind.
"You know why it's called alimony?
They drag you to court and try to take
alimony they can from you."
Where the Sam Hill did this phrase
"Heads up!" come from? I dunno 'bout
anyone else, but if a hard object is flying
through the air at mach speed around
me, I'm gonna put my head down.
Size, of course, being every man's
biggest concern, here's a list of favorite
sayings by those who prefer the metric
system:
"Give 'em a centimeter and they'll
take a kilometer."
"Boy, the Red Sox sure got kilo
grammed last night, didn't they?"
"Whoo-whee, I really stuck my
decimeter in my mouth that time!"
Flag Boy vs. F- - - Drugs: put your
money down . . .
"I hope to become singer, but every
time I try to do harmony, I end up harm
ing an ear instead."
It hurts to admit, but the initial
results of the Gulf War were too Scud to
be true (just another missle-aneous
comment).
Ha ha, boy is this one a real knee
slapper: "How did you know Stanford
raised its prices?" — "It was all in
tuition."
Overheard at a party: "I'd never tell
you this if I wasn't so drunk, but I am
really hammered right now."
"Hey, you wanna beer?" — "Why,
would you rather be someplace else?"
(just another brew-ha-ha)
General student feelings on the Exot
ic-Erotic party: "I prefer not to have a
cop."
"Do you have a pressing engagement,
Chris?" — "Yes, I'm going to work out."
As I stepped into the room, someone
cried, "Hey, it's that funny columnist!"
"Ah," I replied. "I see my reputation has
exceeded me."
I'll leave with one final observation.
Humor is, along with sex, the only thing
you really need to achieve happiness. If
you have a good laugh, you'll get the first
syllable ("ha-"), and, well, the male
organ should take care of the rest.
So thanks for reading, keep sharp,
stay cool, and I strongly endorse the
"younger Elvis" stamp in the upcoming
elections.

This is Chris Harris' last column. He
wishes his former readers a nice life.


Chris Harris
THANK GOD FOR HARRIS!
