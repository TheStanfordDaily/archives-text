# Dynamic modern dancers pay tribute to Jimi Hendrix
## 
### Bryan Snyder Staff writer 
Some critics say that dynamic innovation
and artistic freedom are hard to come by in
modern dance. But Bebe Miller shows them
that this creative energy is still very much
alive.
The Lively Arts at Stanford will host Bebe
Miller and Company on Tuesday, April 28
at Memorial Auditorium. The troupe will
perform "The Habit of Attraction," "Rain"
and"The Hendrix Project."
Miller's six-member troupe is "definitely
modernistic," according to Lively Arts
assistant publicity director Phil O'Shaugh
nessy.
"She is very free and individualistic, and
Miller herself said (about her dance train
ing), 'Thank God I couldn't do a decent plie,
so I could make one up,' " O'Shaughnessy
said.
"The Habit of Attraction" centers on the
theme of how people behave in intimate
relationships. Miller uses dance in the piece
to enhance the expression of sex, love and
personal differences.
She describes the work as "a formal struc
ture overlying a vivid emotional experience."
Two couples deal with how personalities can
put a strain on a relationship
Miller's "Rain," a solo piece performed
by her, is set to music by Villa Lobos. Miller
got the inspiration from looking at the color
of a cool green dress and seeing how it con
trasted with a sharp red dress. The theme is
of "trying to look for a haven and place of

rest ... in an unsettling environment,"
Miller said.
"The Hendrix Project" includes music by
the Jimi Hendrix Experience and is a dedica
tion in dance to Hendrix. Miller got the idea
for"The Hendrix Project" at the 20th
anniversary of Woodstock. She said she tried
to capture the spirit of "abandon, individual
courage, loss of innocence and immediacy"
in Hendrix's music.
"The work is very physical, and the audi
ence gets a very physical response in the
Hendrix Project" Miller said. "The certain
openness to movement in response to music
draws the audience in and is infectious
between us as dancers."
Go to this performance if your are looking
for an energetic, electrifying experience.
Energized art, if you will. Miller will be sure
to dazzle you with her personal gusto and
creativity.
Miller will also be hosting "Explore
Dance with Bebe Miller" in Memorial Audi
torium on Monday, April 27 at 8 p.m. This
lecture on dance will include excerpts from
Tuesday's performance illustrating form
and technique. An informal question-and
answer session will follow.

Bebe Miller and Company will perform
Tuesday, April 28, at 8 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium. Tickets, available at Tresidder
Ticket Office, are $11 to $17 for students.
Half-price "Student Rush" remainders
may be purchased 15 minutes before show
time at the door. Tickets for "Explore Dance
with Bebe Miller" are $3 at the door.
