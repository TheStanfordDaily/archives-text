## Gripping action propels flick through limp tale of drug underworld 
### Victor Haseman Staff writer 
With his second feature film, "Deep Cover," look
ing extremely promising, director Bill Duke has got to
be feeling pretty good about his Hollywood career.
A regular Renaissance man, Duke has directed
television ("Miami Vice"), held supporting roles in
movies ("Commando" and "Bird on a Wire"), and
directed films for both American Playhouse and PBS.
Next on Duke's list was the direction of a major
film release. Though his first try, "A Rage in Harlem,"
was a lot like an incomplete jigsaw puzzle, his second
feature starring Larry Fishburne is striking entertain
ment, complete with action, drama, suspense and
engaging dialogue.
The story, a mixture of "New Jack City" and Brian
de Palma's "Scarface," focuses on Cincinnati cop
Russell Stevens, Jr. (Fishburne), a.k.a John Q. Hull,
and his descent into the drug subculture of Los Ange
les posing as a power-hungry drug dealer.
As a child, Stevens witnessed the death of his
father in a drug-related robbery. It is for this reason
that as an adult, Stevens has gone out of his way to
avoid drugs.
However, he is forced to reassess his motto, "Never
have, never will," when given the opportunity to
arrest Anton Gellegos (Arthur Mendoza), the drug
trafficker responsible for 40 percent of Los Angeles'
drug market.
DEA officer Jerry Carver (Charles Martin Smith)

convinces Stevens that his psychological profile
reveals his turbulent past, categorizing him as a crim
inal. "All of your vices will become virtues undercov
er," Carver explains.
Clinging to his hopes of making a difference, he
hesitantly accepts the assignment, later discovering
that he enjoys selling drugs and wiping out his com
petition. It puts his partner, David Jason (Jeff Gold-

'All of your vices will become
virtues undercover 7

blum), and himself in control of the drug market.
The relationship that unfolds between Fishburne's
and Goldblum's characters carries the film through
several otherwise clumsy scenes.
And the film's supporting characters, though
grossly stereotyped, add a much-desired dimension to
a screenplay with limited space and time for character
development.
Fortunately, it's hard to dwell on the film's short
comings as the story gains momentum. The mixture
of great dialogue and "uh, ah, oh" action helps you
forget about the film's rough edges.
While "Deep Cover" is by no means perfect, Fish
burne's and Goldblum's performances alone make it
worthwhile. The originality of the screenplay makes
the film even more enticing.
