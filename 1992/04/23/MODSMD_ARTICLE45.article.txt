# E. M. Forster adaptation breathtaking
## 
### Kiri Zooper 
Merchant-Ivory, producers of
"Room With A View" and "Mau
rice," have at last adapted E.M.
Forster's masterpiece "Howards
End" to the screen. Apparently the
team — producer Ismail Mer
chant, director James Ivory and
writer Ruth Jhabvala — has been
anxious to do the project since
1986. The result was worth the
wait.
The film tells the story of the
free-thinking Schlegel sisters. The
elder sister, Margaret (Emma
Thompson), befriends the airy
Mrs. Wilcox (Vanessa Redgrave),
whose beloved country birthplace
— Howards End — becomes a
symbol of a happier, less material
istic world.
Upon her death, Mrs. Wilcox
wills Howards End to Margaret,
but her acquisitive widower Henry
(Anthony Hopkins) attributes this
wish to delirium and disregards it.
Soon, however, Henry surprises
himself and both families by
falling for Margaret and marrying
her.

Meanwhile, the two sisters take
an interest in a poverty-ridden, sti
fled intellectual named Leonard
Bast (Sam West). Helen, the
younger sister (Helena Bonham
Carter), is indignant at Henry's
rejection of Bast.
Helen's anger places a rift
between her and Margaret, whose
position in the middle threatens
her own relationship with Henry.
Mayhem, sometimes comic and
sometimes tragic, ensues.
Margaret is the film's surest
triumph. Thompson is at ease
with every aspect of this lovable
character,- she is motherly, comic,
dignified and childlike by turn,
always emanating tremendous
energy.
Bonham Carter is excellent in a
role that frees her to show more of
her range; she is funny, heart
breakingly compassionate and a
little disappointed in life.
Hopkins is just as agile here as
he is in "Silence of the Lambs"
(although, I am glad to report, he
refrains from biting anyone). He
shifts his expressions and manner
from calculatingly cold to emo-

tionally vulnerable, until we are
not sure which side of him is gen
uine.
"Howards End" is arguably
Merchant-Ivory's best visual
work. From the breathtaking
opening shot of Mrs. Wilcox in the
fields of Howards End, to the final
image of the re-configured family
in those same fields, Merchant-
Ivory has gone the extra mile in
every scene to achieve a rich, col
orful texture.
Starting strong thematically
with the conflict between Helen
and Henry, Jhabvala's screenplay
seems to peter out at the end; we
are left to wonder whether things
are truly resolved, or if the parties
have merely buried the hatchet for
a while.
The vague ending is a bit dis
turbing, but this is not enough to
deflate the strengths established
earlier on.
"Howards End" is a wonderful
film. Admittedly, it's not for
everyone, but the coffee-house set
will be thrilled with the film's
stunning visual artistry, comic
genius and gifted cast.
