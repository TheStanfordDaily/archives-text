Barbecued squid, French embassy repre
sentatives and Macintosh computers dotted
the Inner Quad yesterday in an attempt to
lure undeclared undergraduates and
prospective freshman.
As part of Majors Event, the annual dis
play of academic offerings at Stanford put on
by the Undergraduate Advising Center,
seductive booths were set up by every depart
ment and program on campus.
Most were complete with information, food
and pins, and many went a step further with
extravagant displays and demonstrations.
Undeclared freshman Stephanie Sobelle
said the event was "definitely helpful" and, it
was ideal to hold it during Prospective Fresh
man Week. "It helps a lot of people who have
no idea what they want to do," she said.
From 10 am. to 2 p.m., faculty, students and
alumni answered questions and tried to play up
the merits of their majors. Booths representing
other University offerings, such as Overseas
Studies, Hopkins Marine Station and the Haas
Center for Public Service, were also present.
"It's a friendly way to get some informa
tion, and it's all here at once," said Majors
Event coordinator Kathy Wright.
Wright said that at least 400 students vis
ited the 61 tables in the morning and more
were expected in the afternoon.
"I'm really pleased with the amount of time
people have put into the event," she added.
The French department brought out all of
its faculty, baked food, showed videos, hand
ed out numerous pamphlets and magazines
about the department and France and even
brought the Linguistics from the
French Embassy.
"It's a wonderful day," said Patricia de
Castries, who works at the Language Center
at the French department. Because the
department is so small, she said, there is a
"message we're trying to get out."
Other interesting features included bar
becued squid offered by Hopkins Marine Sta
tion, which is located in Pacific Grove, and a
plethora of experiments and demonstrations
by the physics department.
This year, however, the event was less
extravagant than in the past due to budget
cuts in individual departments and pro
grams, Wright said.

yesterday. He said it could only
afford snacks this year.
But Feiock added that the event
was successful because it was a
non-intimidating setting where
freshmen and sophomores could
start thinking about their futures.
Allison McClain, an unde
clared sophomore, described the
event as very helpful. "I wish I
had come by here last year," she

said.
Both Sobelle and McClain said
that Majors Event didn't really
convince them to declare any one
major, however.
Some majors were trying to get
new information out as well as
recruit students.
Earth Systems, approved as a
major just this year, tried to pub
licize itself and educate students
about its offerings.
Junior Renie Crocker said that
although the program already has
around 20 declared majors, they
wanted to get the word out about
the program.
The Economics Department
also tried to spread the news
about a change in the major tak

ing effect next year.
Under the current major, eco
nomics majors specialize in either

Wright said that due
to UAC budget cuts,
this may be the last
year for the event.

Quantitative Economics or Eco
nomic Perspectives and Policy,
but next year there will be only
one combined major.
Wright said that due to UAC
budget cuts, this may be the last

year for the event. It has grown in
popularity in its 11-year history,
she said, but the UAC budget for
next year doesn't include the
funds to sponsor it again.
Majors Event also sponsored a
Tuesday paifel discussion on
opportunities in education.
There will be another panel
discussion at the Law School
today where law students will pre
sent background on the school, on
who should apply and on the
application process in general.
Overall, Wright said, Majors
Event was a success and she
hopes it was "an informal intro
duction that will lead to more
serious connections with stu
dents."
