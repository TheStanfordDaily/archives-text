Barbecued squid, French embassy repre
sentatives and Macintosh computers dotted
the Inner Quad yesterday in an attempt to
lure undeclared undergraduates and
prospective freshman.
As part of Majors Event, the annual dis
play of academic offerings at Stanford put on
by the Undergraduate Advising Center,
seductive booths were set up by every depart
ment and program on campus.
Most were complete with information, food
and pins, and many went a step further with
extravagant displays and demonstrations.
Undeclared freshman Stephanie Sobelle
said the event was "definitely helpful" and, it
was ideal to hold it during Prospective Fresh
man Week. "It helps a lot of people who have
no idea what they want to do," she said.
From 10 am. to 2 p.m., faculty, students and
alumni answered questions and tried to play up
the merits of their majors. Booths representing
other University offerings, such as Overseas
Studies, Hopkins Marine Station and the Haas
Center for Public Service, were also present.
"It's a friendly way to get some informa
tion, and it's all here at once," said Majors
Event coordinator Kathy Wright.
Wright said that at least 400 students vis
ited the 61 tables in the morning and more
were expected in the afternoon.
"I'm really pleased with the amount of time
people have put into the event," she added.
The French department brought out all of
its faculty, baked food, showed videos, hand
ed out numerous pamphlets and magazines
about the department and France and even
brought the Linguistics from the
French Embassy.
"It's a wonderful day," said Patricia de
Castries, who works at the Language Center
at the French department. Because the
department is so small, she said, there is a
"message we're trying to get out."
Other interesting features included bar
becued squid offered by Hopkins Marine Sta
tion, which is located in Pacific Grove, and a
plethora of experiments and demonstrations
by the physics department.
This year, however, the event was less
extravagant than in the past due to budget
cuts in individual departments and pro
grams, Wright said.
