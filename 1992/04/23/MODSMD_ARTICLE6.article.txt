# UAC computer program to ease 'Quest' for major
## 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
Major Quest, a new program
designed to help students choose a
major, will be available in all resi
dence computer clusters beginning
today.
The program includes files on
advising resources, departmental
representatives, alumni contacts,
research opportunities, overseas
studies, tutoring resources, gradu
ate study and every major.
The HyperCard program, creat
ed by Undergraduate Advising
Center adviser Kathy Wright, has

been available to a small number
of students since last spring.
Wright said her goal in devising
Major Quest was to create a pro
gram that could "succinctly tell
people answers to their questions
and tell them the next place to go."
Wright said the UAC plans to
use Major Quest as part of their
programs in the future. During
advising associate orientation
there will be Major Quest work
shops so the AAs can show their
freshmen advisees how to use the
program, according to Wright.
"Although advisers know a lot
about the University, they can't

possibly know all the offerings
available to students," she said.
Each file is broken down into
smaller files so students can
choose those areas that specifically
interests them.
For example, under "Choosing a
Major" there are files called "Get
ting Started," "When to Declare,"
"Choosing a Major Adviser,"
"Choices by Area of Interest,"
"Dual/Multiple Majors" and
"Careers/Jobs."
Each of these files is then bro
ken down into smaller divisions.
