# UAC computer program to ease 'Quest' for major
## 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
Major Quest, a new program
designed to help students choose a
major, will be available in all resi
dence computer clusters beginning
today.
The program includes files on
advising resources, departmental
representatives, alumni contacts,
research opportunities, overseas
studies, tutoring resources, gradu
ate study and every major.
The HyperCard program, creat
ed by Undergraduate Advising
Center adviser Kathy Wright, has

been available to a small number
of students since last spring.
Wright said her goal in devising
Major Quest was to create a pro
gram that could "succinctly tell
people answers to their questions
and tell them the next place to go."
Wright said the UAC plans to
use Major Quest as part of their
programs in the future. During
advising associate orientation
there will be Major Quest work
shops so the AAs can show their
freshmen advisees how to use the
program, according to Wright.
"Although advisers know a lot
about the University, they can't

possibly know all the offerings
available to students," she said.
Each file is broken down into
smaller files so students can
choose those areas that specifically
interests them.
For example, under "Choosing a
Major" there are files called "Get
ting Started," "When to Declare,"
"Choosing a Major Adviser,"
"Choices by Area of Interest,"
"Dual/Multiple Majors" and
"Careers/Jobs."
Each of these files is then bro
ken down into smaller divisions.
After students pick a major to get
information on, they can check
into advising resources, special
programs, introductory courses,
honors programs, requirements,
graduate school and how to
declare.
Wright said that by creating
such files, the program gives stu
dents answers to specific ques
tions and then provides them
with a knowledge base for discus
sions with professors and advis
ers.
"The idea is to give students
who are really motivated basic
information so they can have
interesting conversations," Wright
said.
She said she hopes the file for
mat will allow students to find
out about offerings that they
wouldn't normally come across.
"I'm hoping it's easy enough to

play with so that when students
come to choose a major they will
see the other offerings and inves
tigate them," Wright said.
Wright said Drew Saunders of
the UAC helped her with the
technical aspects of developing
the program and that it was edit
ed by junior English major Mary
Lempke.
"Advisers are going to find it
incredibly helpful," Wright
added.
She said she began working on
Major Quest about a year ago. Ini
tially, Wright said she had to
spend a lot of time on it during
weekends and evenings before she
convinced others at the UAC that
it was a worthwhile project.
Depending on the response and
suggestions made about Major-
Quest, Wright said it will continue
to expand throughout spring and
summer quarters.
In addition, Major Quest will be
a part of workshops for advisers
and, eventually, a class on aca
demic choices and planning.
