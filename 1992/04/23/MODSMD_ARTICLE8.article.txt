Baltic Republics send diplomats to Hoover
For the first time ever, representatives from three Baltic Republics
have joined the Hoover Institution's diplomat training program.
Diplomats from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania will join 11
other government officials from East and Central European coun
tries. The session began late last month and ends in early June.
"This is the first time we have representatives from those
countries," said associate director Richard Sousa, who oversees
the program.
Other countries represented in the program are Bulgaria, the
Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania.
The training program introduces diplomats from those coun
tries to "American economics, American culture and to the Stan
ford environment," said Sousa.
Participants attend a seminar series at Hoover and formal
classes at Stanford. They also visit private businesses and spend
one week in Washington, D.C., at the conclusion of the session to
meet political leaders.
Mosaic pieces mysteriously returned
Restoring Memorial Church's mosaic can be like putting a jigsaw
puzzle together â€” but the missing pieces makes it almost impossible.
As a result of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, a large section
of the mosaic fell inside the Church and a wing broke off of the
northeast mosaic angel.
Apparently, some people took some of the pieces that fell down
as souvenirs, making restoration much harder.
But this weekend, three chunks of the mosaic showed up in the
Memorial Church Round Room. They were left there in a shop
ping bag by an anonymous person.
The broken section of the mosaic measures about two feet by
10 feet, which make them a significant contribution to the
restoration of the mosaic. Each of the pieces is about one foot
square.
Gaps in the angel that cannot be filled with original pieces will
be replaced with new tiles from Venice, Italy.
Reconstruction of the Church is expected to be completed by
the end of September for the start of the fall quarter.
