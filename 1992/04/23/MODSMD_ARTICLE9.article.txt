# Optimism replaces resentment at Cowell
## Staff upbeat after meeting with Edmonds to discuss changes 
### Holly Hacker Senior staff writer 
Cowell Student Health Center employees
are optimistic about an easing of bad feelings,
after a tense year following a decision to end
the center's 45-year relationship with the Palo
Alto Medical Foundation.
Staff, many of whom have said they resent
ed the way administrators handled the deci
sion, say talking with Vice President for Stu
dent Resources Mary Edmonds has offered
them a chance to voice their concerns and per
haps effect some changes.
Doctors, nurses and support staff who had
worked for the Palo Alto group and chose to
stay at Cowell had to re-apply for their posi
tions under the Stanford Medical group that
now provides the center's primary care and
referral services.
Many lost seniority, vacation time and sick
leave in the process.
The decision affected about 50 employees.
After the switch was announced last April,
several staff members expressed frustration
that they were not included in the decision
making process.
Over the past two weeks, Edmonds —
whose office oversees Cowell — has met with
both staff and administrators at Cowell.
Most recently, she met a week ago with about
35 staff to talk about tensions within Cowell

and the current state of negotiations between
Cowell and the new health care provider.

There are things I still need to
look into. I am very optimistic
we'll be able to solve the prob

Cowell is still negotiating with the Stanford
group, the Faculty Practice Program, to final
ize an agreement outlining their relationship.
Edmonds said she has asked Cowell staff
not to discuss the issues with outsiders "to
make sure we're able to solve these problems
internally.''
Several Cowell staff have either declined to
comment on the issue or have not returned
repeated phone calls.
"I think the process is going well,"
Edmonds said.
"There are things I still need to look into,"
she added. "I am very optimistic we'll be able
to solve the problems."
Staff physician John Dorman said he
believes "there's an optimism" among staff
that Edmonds "is going to help out in terms of
resolving those issues."

Cowell Director Harvey Weinstein said he
will "make every effort to smooth over the
relations" with Cowell staff, noting he has
already been meeting with Edmonds weekly
since she began her job in March.
"We're trying to formulate a way to finalize
the negotiations with the FPP in a way that all
of the staff feel comfortable," Weinstein said,
adding that he hopes to reach an agreement by
the end of the school year.
Dorman said staff members "are not really
clear in general as to what those issues are"
that need to be resolved between Cowell and
the faculty group.
While Weinstein said that surveys mailed
to students in January reveal that "we know
that what we're doing is effective," some staff
said they believe the tensions within Cowell
have affected the care given to students.
One staff member, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said, "When you have adminis
trative problems from within ...it enters into
your decision-making process and it has to
affect morale. You don't have the energies to be
creative and deliver the same concentration to
your job if you're preoccupied with something."
Director of Counseling and Psychological
Services Alejandro Martinez also pointed out
that when the Cowell staff met with Edmonds
last week, the center essentially shut down for
an hour. In this way, he said, "we clearly are
going to inconvenience some students."
