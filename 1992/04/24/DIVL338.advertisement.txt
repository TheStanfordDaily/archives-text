Some People Just See A Rat.
We See A Cure For Cancer.
Hopefully, sooner or later there will be a
cure for cancer, a vaccine against AIDS
and an effective treatment for Alzheimer's.
And when these breakthroughs occur it
will be thanks to the rats and other
laboratory animals that are so vital to
medical research.
Because, historically, no cure, no vac
cine, no revolution in surgery was ever
discovered without animal research.
Today, however, there is a movement
afoot that would ban the use of
laboratory animals in the war against
disease.
This so-called "animal rights" movement
believes that animals and humans are
equal, and that "even if animal research
resulted in a cure for AIDS, they would
be against it." In their war against
biomedical research, the animal rights
activists use disinformation, pressure
tactics and active terrorism.
The notion that a rat and a child are
equal is an obscenity to most Americans.
The belief that research which can save
the lives of millions of humans (and yes,
even animals) should be paralyzed, is
an outrage against all living creatures.
Americans for Medical Progress salutes
the dedicated men and women working
to conquer the illnesses that plague
mankind.
Americans for Medical Progress exists
to provide grassroots support for the
scientists who are the front line in the
war against disease.
More importantly, we've formed the
Americans for Medical Progress
Educational Foundation to spearhead
the critical effort to educate American
opinion leaders and citizens about the
need for animal research. Because society
cannot allow itself to be manipulated by a
handful of zealots who would equate the
life of a rat with that of a child.
You are invited to support the Americans
for Medical Progress Educational Foun
dation. Your membership will send a
clear and unequivocal message to
caring people everywhere that human
life and the quality of human life are the
number one priority of every sane,
sensitive and thinking individual.
Fyes? I want to become a member of AmericanTl

support the right of scientists to search for new
cures. Enclosed please find my tax-deductible
