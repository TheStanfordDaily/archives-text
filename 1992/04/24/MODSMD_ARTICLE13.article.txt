## Unwelcome refund 
### 
Bill points to a problem,
but squandering money
is shortsighted solution

Leaping from stinginess to
generosity bordering on the
ludicrous, seven ASSU sena
tors have proposed a bill to dole out
most of the student government's
reserves in the form of $65 checks.
The proposal addresses one of
the most frequent criticisms of the
senate: its aversion to spending any
of the money it is entrusted with.
Such an unusually rash bill, howev
er, is hardly a constructive solution.
The ASSU has more than
$970,000 lying untouched in
numerous reserve funds, money
that should be used to improve the
quality of life for students. But
passing out $800,000 in one-time
refunds for every registered stu
dent is extraordinarily lazy.
The remaining $170,000 would
go to various ASSU boards and for
a $10,000 all-campus celebration.
The proposal is reminiscent of a
rebate California politicians gave to
angry taxpayers in the late 1980s.
Instead of using the year's rare bud
get surplus to improve state schools
or health care, the "leaders" placat
ed voters by cutting small checks.
The idea of extra spending money
is tempting. Once the checks are
cashed, however, the benefits will
fade quickly. By investing in projects
and services, the senate could dis
prove the widely held opinion that
they are useless resume packers.
True, the Omnibus Reserve Fund
Reform Bill distributes money that
never should have accumulated. The
senate has too many buffer, round
ing, smoothing, project, equipment
and discretionary reserves to count.
And Tuesday night they voted to
put $15,000 of the Council of Pres
idents salary into yet another, the
contingency reserve. Despite the
incoming COP's promise to use the
money for student organizations,
"I Prefer Not to Have a COP" slate

member Ed Mun barely objected to
the diversion of the funds.
Tuesday's decision was just one
symptom of an ongoing problem.
Rather than channeling the money
into projects or organizations, it is
easier to simply dump it into one of
the slush funds.
The senate often subjects stu
dent groups asking for funds to a
grueling grill session and ends up
denying many requests altogether.
Financial caution is commendable,
but not to the point of paranoia.
It's as if Stanford's student gov
ernment thinks the funds actually
belong to them. Since money is the
basis for most of the ASSU's power,
being tightfisted makes sense for
the senate — what other source of
authority does it really have?
But the funds ultimately belong
to the students, who expect sena
tors to make careful decisions while
still producing tangible results.
Graduate senator Peter Thiel,
the bill's main author, contends
that the huge expenditure is
appropriate because there are no
major business projects currently
being contemplated.
If there is a lack of ideas on how
to spend the money, it might be wise
for the senate to ask students what
they need instead of giving up on
serving their function altogether.
The money in the reserves has
built up over time, reaching its
excessive level only with the help of
successive classes of students. The
money should benefit future arrivals
rather than being blown by one
group of shortsighted students.
The bill sounds ridiculous
enough that it would hardly seem
a serious threat, except that seven
out of 20 senators are listed as co
authors. Two-thirds of the the sen
ate must approve the proposal,
which is scheduled for discussion
at the May 5 meeting.
Some in the outgoing senate
might not be worried about a plan
to squander almost a million dol
lars. But spending the reserves
should be a result of thoughtful
planning rather than one ill
advised, extravagant move.
