Evaluation oversimplifies environmental movement

lAM DISMAYED to see that
Jonathon Marek has so easily accept
ed the highly flawed evaluation of
environmentalism put forth by Ayn
Rand worshippers.
His letter in yesterday's Daily con
tains the same critical fallacy that
plagues Dr. Michael Berliner's poorly
written "Environmentalists: The New
Life Haters," which he uses to defend his
views. Marek and Berliner both chose to
attack environmentalism by creating an
environmentalist strawman which is
stufTed only with their personal and,
quite frankly, absurd, definition of envi
ronmentalism.
Marek's definition is such a gross
simplification of the broad range of envi
ronmentalism and such an ignorant and
misinformed view of environmental
thought that it is no wonder he is abie to
topple this strawman with a few Ayn
Rand quotes taken out of context.

Marek sets up the strawman by using
Berliner's idea that environmentalism
"mourns the death of one whale or tree
but actually welcomes the death of bil
lions of people." This concept is not
merely a poor generalization, it is a com
plete mistruth designed to make anti
environmentalism more palatable to
audiences who are not thoughtful
enough to see through its logical flaws.
Yes, there are environmentalists who
find priceless beauty in irreplaceable old
growth forests. There are environmen
talists who believe that open spaces are
essential to maintaining sanity in our
industrial world. There are environmen
talists who see a lot more tranquility in
the wilderness than in a city.
I would gladly argue all their cases,
but since Marek is so concerned with
Homo sapiens I will have to remind him
that environmentalists are also using
the most powerful supercomputers to

model the effects of global warming
because of its potentially disastrous con
sequences for humans.
Environmentalists are fighting
against ozone-depleting chemicals
because billions of humans will be affect
ed by increased ultraviolet radiation.
Right here at Stanford, environmental
ists are taking part in majors such as
earth systems, which combines study of
science, economics and environment.
Finally, Marek obviously will be sur
prised to find out that environmentalists
fight for clean water and air because
humans need those things to live, a fact
Rand's simplistic philosophy seems to
have forgotten.
And Marek, as president of a society
that claims to promote science and fact,
objectivism and rational discourse, has
conveniently ignored these and countless
other examples of what environmental
ists are doing for human life.

Those of us who do not blindly and
completely subscribe to an outdated phi
losophy such as Rand's have perspective
enough to see that driving an industrial
machine 100 miles per hour into a brick
wall despite repeated warnings does not
make one Howard Roark. It makes one
dead.
We are intelligent enough to see that
any rational view of the world today nec
essarily involves a serious consideration
of environmental issues.
If Marek truly wants to be informed,
I suggest he take Civil Engineering
170: Environmental Science and Tech
nology next fall, or Biology and Global
Change next winter. He will quickly
learn that the man-made threats to our
entire planet have ensured that the
days of Rand's blissful ignorance are
over.
