# Grass-roots groups do much more than COP
## 
### 
In Monday's editorial, the Daily
bewailed the recent ASSU election that
gave victory to "I Prefer Not to Have a
COP," stating that a more serious Coun
cil of Presidents is necessary to give stu
dents a voice in the current period of
transition.
The Daily said COP members act as
"the designated student representatives
. . . a considerable power." How so?
Name but a single exercise of this power
and I might be more content.
A few examples: When University
Food Service started serving warmed
over Stern food in the Row houses,
where was the COP? Students, acting on
their own, solved this problem by pulling
together and lobbying for a restoration
of their privileges.
When the arts were threatened,

where was the COP? A grass-roots
movement, organized by the student
performing groups, was largely responsi
ble for saving the arts on campus.
In my four-year career at Stanford, the
"considerable power" of the COP has yet
to vest itself on my behalf in any form.
I submit that in fact there is no harm
at all in abolishing the COP when every
major crisis at the University this year
has been addressed and resolved by inde
pendent students in the total absence of
any COP input.
Furthermore, though the COP is not
a powerful or necessary body. It sucks
up $16,000 a year, a bloated, dispropor
tionate share of student resources. Even
when the COP money is not wasted on
total inaction, do we really get what we
pay for? How many of us would have
approved a $16,000 fee request to subsi
dize the 1989 takeover of the President
Kennedy's office? Including those who
supported it?
Far from seeing the demise of the

COP as a crippling injury, I see it as the
excision of an expensive unhelpful
organ. The University will not grind to a
halt.
I look forward to next year, when our
grass-roots movements and petition
drives will be better funded than ever,
since $16,000 can go a long, long way.
