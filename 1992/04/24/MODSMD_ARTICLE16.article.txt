# Not eating meat helps save the environment
## 
### 
This letter is in response to Wednes
day's article titled, "Hold the hairspray,
turn off the computer."
I agree with the premise that changes
in our daily activities can positively
affect our environment, but the article
failed to mention one area of daily life
where lifestyle changes could have a pro
foundly beneficial effect.

A diet based largely on meat and ani
mal products produces an extreme strain
on our environment. Those who think of
themselves as environmentalists should
consider this when they sit down to eat.
The article fits in with an attitude I
call "pseudo environmentalism." Most
Americans, including many of those in
the Stanford community, are hypocrites.
They think of themselves as environ
mentally correct when they don't flush
the toilet — saving perhaps a couple of
gallons of water — while choosing one
meal without meat could save perhaps a
thousand gallons of water.
It has become fashionable for individu
als and companies to pretend they are
environmentalists, but very few are will
ing to make real changes in their conduct.
This vegetarian won't be found pol
luting the air while waiting for a ham
burger at Jack-in-the-Box's drive
through counter.
