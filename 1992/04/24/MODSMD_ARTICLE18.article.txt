## Pacifying the killing fields 
### 
Trekking through heavily
mined jungles, escaping forced agri
cultural labor and massive starva
tion in disease-infested concentration
camps and watching close friends killed
before their very eyes are grizzly realities
the vast majority of Stanford students
will never have to deed with.
But people of the once-peaceful land of
Kampuchea (also known as Cambodia)
such as former Stanford communications
major Satia Tor, who experienced the
horrors of the Khmer Rouge — the coun
try's rulers from 1975 to 1979 — know
them all too well.
Tor still has vivid memories of that
period, during which time an estimated 1
to 2 million Kampucheans in a popula
tion of 9 million died of murder, over
work, disease and starvation in the
world's most recent genocide.
As a child then, Tor was deprived of
education, had to perform strenuous
labor in the fields, lived on two scoops of
rice a day with an occasional piece of fish
and faced threats of severe beatings by
teenagers of the Khmer Rouge if he did
not obey their orders.
The 1979 Vietnamese army's invasion
ended the Khmer Rouge's reign.
Throughout their 10-year occupation,
they and their puppet regime constantly
fought an alliance of three opposition
groups — the Khmer Rouge and two non
communist groups, led by former Premier

Son San and Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
Years of discussion have led to an
accord accepted by all four factions and
the deployment of 22,000 United Nations
troops. April 1993 is the U.N.'s projected
date for elections for seats in the Con
stituent Assembly, which will draft a new
constitution defining Kampuchea's
future power structure.
Prince Sihanouk, who led the country
from its independence in 1954 until a
1970 coup and has been the most notable
figure of the opposition ever since, has
been named president of the current
U.N.-backed government, the Supreme
National Council.
Given Sihanouk's past importance in
Kampuchean politics and the legitimacy of
the monarchial institution in Khmer cul
ture, it is difficult to see him without a
future role, says Dr. Khathaiya Um of
UC-Berkeley's political science depart
ment. Many Kampucheans believe
Sihanouk has divine powers, an important
factor in a country where politics are more
dependent on personalities than on issues.
Um is troubled by the lack of substan
tive discussion of the complexities of imple
menting the democratic process in Kam
puchea. Problems dealing with the fairness
of elections include candidates' access to
areas controlled by rival groups or littered
with land mines, and coercion used by
those rival groups against refugees and the
local populations to secure votes.

Threats against freedom of expression
still exist. Recent attacks on and assassi
nations of journalists have set dangerous
precedents. The coercive security appara
tus set up by the Vietnamese is still large
ly intact.
Both Um, who left Kampuchea in
1975, and Tor share the desire of return
ing home one day. Um is worried that
sporadic humanitarian gestures made by
Kampuchean expatriates, coupled with
aid that Western countries have pledged,
may not be enough to solve the country's
dire problems. Only structured initia
tives can assure future prosperity, and
these require political stability.
Meanwhile, Tor has worked with
Warner Brothers in Los Angeles, where
he was the assistant editor and translator
in the production of "Sam Sara: The
Death and Rebirth of Cambodia." He is
making a documentary of his life experi
ence, and preliminary filming in the U.S.
will be followed by filming in locations he
knew as a child in Kampuchea. This film
ing will be carried out during his upcom
ing two-month visit there.

Paul Namphy is a good friend of Satia
Tor.
