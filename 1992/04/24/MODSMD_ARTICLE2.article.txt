A 12-year-old girl escaped a daylight kid
napping attempt on a path near the corner of
Stanford Avenue and Bowdoin Street on
Wednesday, according to Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington.
The suspect, described as a white male in
his early 30s, "forcefully grabbed" the girl as
she walked home at about 6 p.m., Herrington
said. The girl struggled, escaped and ran to her
nearby campus home while the man fled in the
opposite direction, according to Herrington.
Police are especially concerned because the
incident occurred in broad daylight on a much
travelled path, where "most people wouldn't be
on their guard," Herrington said.

The attempt took place less than a half
mile from several schools, including Bing
Nursery School, Nixon Elementary School
and a day care center.
No daylight kidnapping attempt has been
reported at Stanford in the last five years,
according to Herrington.
The scene of the attempted abduction — a
somewhat secluded path used by bikers and
pedestrians — "has been relatively safe," Her
rington said. However, trees and foliage obscure
the path from the view of people on the street.
Police describe the suspect as about 5-foot
-10 and of average build, with green eyes and
no facial hair. He wore light grey running
shorts, a medium-blue hooded zip-up sweat
shirt and white running shoes at the time of

the attempt, police said.
Police are urging local residents to avoid
running alone and after dark, and local teach
ers are warning students to be cautious while
walking to and from school.
Escondido Village residents received a
notice describing the incident and the suspect.
The flyer asked them to tell their children to
be careful when walking outside, said resident
Jerry Linton, a graduate student.
"This is the kind of nightmare that parents
always think about," Linton said.
Loic McAnally, a fifth grader at nearby
Escondido Elementary School, said his teacher
told his class to "always play with a buddy and be
aware of people who are coming toward us, even
if they look normal."
