## Spotlight on Elzie at NCAA's 
### Andy Eiser Staff Writer 
She couldn't be overlooked.
A decade-and-a-half ago, a local tele
vision news crew in El Cerrito, Calif.,
discovered a true gymnastics talent.
The station decided to run a feature on
the subject even if, at the ripe age of
four, she was virtually unable to com
prehend the significance of the
encounter.
It is the stuff of which legends are
made: receiving publicity nearly from
the cradle, and, just after learning to
walk, demonstrating the ability to per
form physical feats at which most peo
ple can only stare in amazement.
Jene Elzie was indeed a "legend"
before her time, yet now that, as a Stan
ford freshman, that time has come, she
has done nothing to tarnish her lofty
title. In leading the Cardinal to its first
ever NCAA Championship Meet
appearance this weekend in St. Paul,
Minn., Elzie has broken or shares three
of five all-time school records; even
more unbelievably, however, her
promise remains largely unfulfilled, as
she has had to battle recurring ten
donitis in her left knee and both
Achilles heels throughout the season.
Earning school records, going to
championship meets, leading a team to
new-found glory immediately. It sounds
like something out of the story of Magic
Johnson or Larry Bird. legendary.
How did someone pegged for great
ness at such an early age manage to stay
on course, to make possibly her most
amazing achievement be the "proving
right" of the often-fickle media? Two
dominant explanations surface after
only a brief observation of or conversa
tion with Elzie: her overriding modesty
that complements the quiet confidence
she exudes in and out of the gym, and a
willingness to learn from everyone with
whom she comes in contact.
After impressing several coaches
who had seen the news feature, Elzie
joined a YMCA team at age five; she
joined a competitive club the following
year at age six. At age 11, she became a
member of the prestigious Golden Bear
Gymnastics Club in Berkeley, and was

progressing on the pace of someone
vying for a berth on a national team at
age 14 or 15.
Yet Elzie was not a cutthroat com
petitor early in her career, and did not
want any part of the "fast track" that
rushes top-flight gymnasts into and out
of prominence before adolescence. In
fact, at age 13, she approached her
Golden Bear coaches — Ben Corr and
Chizu Holmes — and expressed a desire
to quit the club.
Corr and Holmes heard her com
plaint and reasonably convinced Elzie to
give gymnastics another chance, effec
tively reviving her career. Elzie gives
them proper credit, simply stating, "I
pretty much owe everything to them."
During her junior year in high
school, Elzie began to sense that she
could just about "pick her college," as
she was recruited by many of the
nation's prestigious programs. She was
recruited by Cal, the school in whose
shadows she had grown up, but knew
that it was not for her.
"I had been in the city of Berkeley
too long," Elzie says."I wanted to go to
school far away from home."
She eventually decided to stay in Cal
ifornia, however, and Elzie narrowed
her choices to Stanford and UCLA.
Looking for a school with a prominent
gymnastics program as well as an aca

demic powerhouse that would support
her plans to major in economics or
international relations (with an eye for
a future shot at business school) she
was wary when the Cardinal's promis
ing 1990 squad missed the NCAA
Championship Meet under then-first
year coach Breck Greenwood.
Last year, when she stayed with
teammate Kerri Kanuka (who is now a
sophomore) on a campus visit,
helped her make an unbiased college
decision. Her choice was made easy,
though, and after observing Kanuka's
performance ('"Nuk's work ethic keeps
me going," says Elzie) and conducting
more talks with Greenwood, Elzie chose
to move across the bay to join a promis
ing Cardinal squad.
That promising squad — consisting
of fellow freshmen Katie Clancy, Mee
gan Lannin, and Tina Snowden; sopho
mores Kanuka, Mollie Brown, Kerrie
Kelley, and Laurie West; and junior
Erin McCann — have now followed
Elzie to the pinnacle of collegiate gym
nastics. Yet when the Cardinal com
petes in the "lower rotation" of seeds
seven through 12 at the St. Paul Civic
Center tonight, it harbors no real hopes
of even breaking into the top six, as the
judges intentionally score the second
group low in order to "leave room" for
the top six teams, which compete
tonight.
In fact, this is what Greenwood calls
"the first meet of next year," as Stan
ford has already attained its goal of sim
ply reaching the national meet in 1992.
Elzie concurs with her coach, saying,
"We've worked so hard with nationals
as our g0a1.... If we hadn't made it, we
never would have been able to build our
confidence buck up next year."
Elzie still has a shot at All-American
individual status this year if she places
in the top 10 in any event today. Her
philosophy — "Just do it and just relax"
— has been adopted from Kanuka and
sounds like it came from a shoe com
mercial, but should help Elzie in her
efforts tonight.
She can now afford to relax. After all,
the legend, like the Stanford program in
which she participates, can't be over
looked.
