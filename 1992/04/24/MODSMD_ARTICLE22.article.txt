# Men two matches away from title
## 
### Laurie Wackier Staff Writer 
From day one of volleyball season, Bob Hill
man has been saying his squad would go to the
Final Four. Despite early season polls placing
Stanford toward the bottom of the top 10,
Hillman stuck to his guns. And even after a
couple of losses early on, the determined
junior didn't rescind that promise.
Tonight the spikers prove that Hillman is a
man of his word, as they square off against
Indiana/Purdue-Fort Wayne (27-7) in first
round action of the 1992 NCAA Final Four in
Muncie, Ind. Hosted by Ball State, the tourna
ment opens with contest between Pepperdine
and Penn State at 5:30 p.m., followed by the
Stanford-IPFW contest at 7:30 p.m.
The spikers nabbed the at-large berth to
the Final Four last weekend, when Stanford
(23-3) shut out Cal State-Northridge in the
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Tourna
ment. The other three tournament entrants
represent the East, Midwest, and West
regions.
Although the Cardinal is seeded second
behind Pepperdine in the tournament, the
final Tachikara Coaches top-20 poll places
Stanford in the No.l spot, followed by Pepper
dine at No. 2. IPFW enters the Final Four
with a No. 7 ranking, with Penn State coming
in at No. 8.
An appropriate finale to his outstanding
college career, the Final Four is familiar terri
tory to senior Duncan Blackman. In his fresh
man season, the outside hitter started for
Stanford in his first ever NCAA championship
bid. Unfortunately, the 1989 Cardinal squad
came up short, and had to settle for runner-up
honors.
"When we went to the Final Four three
years ago, it was a big progression for Stan
ford volleyball. It put us on the map," Black
man said. "Despite the fact we lost in the
championship, it was a very positive experi

ence, and a part of us was really satisfied just
to be there. But now Stanford is on the map,
and we won't be satisfied unless we win."
Although Stanford is the clear favorite in
tonight's match, Blackman and his teammates
aren't taking anything for granted. The
Mastodons have compiled a 27-7 record, claim
ing several impressive wins along the way,
including a pair of victories over USC, who fin
ished the season ranked 10th nationally.
"We definitely won't overlook IPFW.
They've got some really good athletes," said
junior John Bezmaliniovic. "When you're only
two matches away from a national champi
onship, you can't afford to overlook anyone.
Every point will be important."
According to head coach Ruben Nieves, the
Mastodons are led by sophomore Loly Ball a 6-
foot-8 setter. Ball has compiled 1947 assists
this season, averaging over 15 per game.
"Ball is one of the premier setters in the
country," Nieves said. "He runs a sophisticat
ed offense and really does a lot for the team."
In addition to Ball, the Cardinal will have to
contend with the throng of fans who will fill
the 11,000 seat arena.
"They'll have a big home crowd advantage.
We'll hope to get on them early and take the
crowd out of the match," Nieves commented.
Playing under pressure may actually be an
advantage for the Cardinal. A squad that
boasts experience and maturity, Stanford has
prevailed in clutch situations throughout the
season. In each of their matches that went to
five games, the spikers came away victorious.
The shut-out victories in all three of their
WIVA tournament contests also revealed
Stanford's composure.
Composure may be crucial in Muncie, but
the Cardinal will also be running on
adrenaline. After last season's dismal 8-13 fin
ish, the spikers are nearing the climax of a
comeback mission.
"We're playing, great as a team right now.
The chemistry is really clicking," said junior

Dave Goss. "We're just so excited to be here,
and to get a shot at the National Champi
onship."
If history is any indicator, the championship
match will be a showdown between Stanford
and Pepperdine: Only two non-West Coast
teams have ever reached the final contest.
Should both west coast teams advance to
the title match Saturday at 7:30 p.m., Stan
ford and Pepperdine will meet for the third
time this season. The Waves downed Stanford
in a preseason tournament, but Stanford
avenged the loss several weeks later with a
five-game victory. Saturday may provide a
forum to settle the score.
"Pepperdine is playing really well right
now. They're really on a roll," Nieves said.
"They played flawless at the end of the season,
killing Santa Barbara and Irvine. Then they
went to the WIVA tournament and knocked
off Long Beach State."
A key to the Waves' success has been junior
Tom Sorenson, a member of the All-WIVA
first team. Sorenson is third in the nation in
kills per game, and second in service aces.
"Sorenson is remarkable, and there are
times when you can't do anything to stop
him," said Nieves of the outside hitter. "When
he's on, he's capable of dominating a match."
But Stanford's offense features some
equally potent weapons. Sorenson is edged in
the kills per game department by Goss, who is
second nationally. Bezmalinovic, a middle
blocker, rates fourth on the hitting percentage
list. However, teammate Joe Burghardt —
who leads the nation in hitting percentage —
suffered back spasms in the WIVA tourna
ment. His status is questionable for the Final
Four.

On Monday, Nieves was named AVCA/Tachikara
Coach of the Year. Blackman, Canyon Ceman, and
Goss were all named the first team All-Americans by
the AVCA as well.

junior John Bezmaliniovic. "When you're only
two matches away from a national champi
onship, you can't afford to overlook anyone.
Every point will be important."
According to head coach Ruben Nieves, the
Mastodons are led by sophomore Loly Ball a 6-
foot-8 setter. Ball has compiled 1947 assists
this season, averaging over 15 per game.
"Ball is one of the premier setters in the
country," Nieves said. "He runs a sophisticat
ed offense and really does a lot for the team."
In addition to Ball, the Cardinal will have to
contend with the throng of fans who will fill
the 11,000 seat arena.
"They'll have a big home crowd advantage.
We'll hope to get on them early and take the
crowd out of the match," Nieves commented.
Playing under pressure may actually be an
advantage for the Cardinal. A squad that
boasts experience and maturity, Stanford has
prevailed in clutch situations throughout the
season. In each of their matches that went to
five games, the spikers came away victorious.
The shut-out victories in all three of their
WIVA tournament contests also revealed
Stanford's composure.
Composure may be crucial in Muncie, but
the Cardinal will also be running on
adrenaline. After last season's dismal 8-13 fin
ish, the spikers are nearing the climax of a
comeback mission.
"We're playing, great as a team right now.
The chemistry is really clicking," said junior

Dave Goss. "We're just so excited to be here,
and to get a shot at the National Champi
onship."
If history is any indicator, the championship
match will be a showdown between Stanford
and Pepperdine: Only two non-West Coast
teams have ever reached the final contest.
Should both west coast teams advance to
the title match Saturday at 7:30 p.m., Stan
ford and Pepperdine will meet for the third
time this season. The Waves downed Stanford
in a preseason tournament, but Stanford
avenged the loss several weeks later with a
five-game victory. Saturday may provide a
forum to settle the score.
"Pepperdine is playing really well right
now. They're really on a roll," Nieves said.
"They played flawless at the end of the season,
killing Santa Barbara and Irvine. Then they
went to the WIVA tournament and knocked
off Long Beach State."
A key to the Waves' success has been junior
Tom Sorenson, a member of the All-WIVA
first team. Sorenson is third in the nation in
kills per game, and second in service aces.
"Sorenson is remarkable, and there are
times when you can't do anything to stop
him," said Nieves of the outside hitter. "When
he's on, he's capable of dominating a match."
But Stanford's offense features some
equally potent weapons. Sorenson is edged in
the kills per game department by Goss, who is
second nationally. Bezmalinovic, a middle
blocker, rates fourth on the hitting percentage
list. However, teammate Joe Burghardt —
who leads the nation in hitting percentage —
suffered back spasms in the WIVA tourna
ment. His status is questionable for the Final
Four.

On Monday, Nieves was named AVCA/Tachikara
Coach of the Year. Blackman, Canyon Ceman, and
Goss were all named the first team All-Americans by
the AVCA as well.
From day one of volleyball season, Bob Hill
man has been saying his squad would go to the
Final Four. Despite early season polls placing
Stanford toward the bottom of the top 10,
Hillman stuck to his guns. And even after a
couple of losses early on, the determined
junior didn't rescind that promise.
Tonight the spikers prove that Hillman is a
man of his word, as they square off against
Indiana/Purdue-Fort Wayne (27-7) in first
round action of the 1992 NCAA Final Four in
Muncie, Ind. Hosted by Ball State, the tourna
ment opens with contest between Pepperdine
and Penn State at 5:30 p.m., followed by the
Stanford-IPFW contest at 7:30 p.m.
The spikers nabbed the at-large berth to
the Final Four last weekend, when Stanford
(23-3) shut out Cal State-Northridge in the
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Tourna
ment. The other three tournament entrants
represent the East, Midwest, and West
regions.
Although the Cardinal is seeded second
behind Pepperdine in the tournament, the
final Tachikara Coaches top-20 poll places
Stanford in the No.l spot, followed by Pepper
dine at No. 2. IPFW enters the Final Four
with a No. 7 ranking, with Penn State coming
in at No. 8.
An appropriate finale to his outstanding
college career, the Final Four is familiar terri
tory to senior Duncan Blackman. In his fresh
man season, the outside hitter started for
Stanford in his first ever NCAA championship
bid. Unfortunately, the 1989 Cardinal squad
came up short, and had to settle for runner-up
honors.
"When we went to the Final Four three
years ago, it was a big progression for Stan
ford volleyball. It put us on the map," Black
man said. "Despite the fact we lost in the
championship, it was a very positive experi

ence, and a part of us was really satisfied just
to be there. But now Stanford is on the map,
and we won't be satisfied unless we win."
Although Stanford is the clear favorite in
tonight's match, Blackman and his teammates
aren't taking anything for granted. The
Mastodons have compiled a 27-7 record, claim
ing several impressive wins along the way,
including a pair of victories over USC, who fin
ished the season ranked 10th nationally.
"We definitely won't overlook IPFW.
They've got some really good athletes," said
junior John Bezmaliniovic. "When you're only
two matches away from a national champi
