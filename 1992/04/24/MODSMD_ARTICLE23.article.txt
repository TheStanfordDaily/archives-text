# Card nine battle front-running Arizona
## 
### Mike Langford Staff Writer 
Despite the one-game-at-a-time, every
game-is-irnportant attitude normally adopted
by Stanford baseball head coach Mark Mar
quess, it seems that even he may be looking to
this weekend's match-up to be pretty huge.
"Well, every weekend [series] is impor
tant," Marquess said, "but yeah, this is a big
one."
In what could be its biggest series so far
this season, the Stanford baseball team takes
on the Arizona Wildcats for a three-game
series this weekend at Sunken Diamond. Ari
zona, alone in first place in the Pacific 10
Southern Division, is one game ahead of the
Cardinal. With a sweep or two out of three,
Stanford could be in first place in the confer
ence. But in order for either of these to occur,
Stanford will have to play very well.
Arizona is currently second in the Six-Pac
in hitting with a .309 team batting average.
Leading the team is junior Chris Gump, who

sports an excellent .390 batting average. Right
behind Gump is junior Jason Bates, who is
currently hitting .363. Billy Owens provides
the team's power with eight home runs, and
33 RBI. Even more adept at driving in runs
have been juniors John Tejcek (34 RBI) and
Robbie Moen (41), who is second in the Six-
Pac in RBl's.
While Arizona is more potent from the
plate than from the mound, they nevertheless
have two of the best pitchers in the Six-Pac.
Sophomore Tim Schweitzer is tops in the con
ference with an incredible 2.42 ERA and a 5-3
record. Meanwhile, classmate Mike Schiefel
bein is 6-2 with a 4.17 ERA. Reliever Carlos
Rico is third in the Six-Pac with five saves.
"They [Arizona] really have no weakness
es," Marquess said, "and were picked to win
the conference at the beginning of the year.
We're really gonna have to pitch well to beat
them."
And they have been. From the mound,
Stanford has been getting some very good per
formances. Willie Adams has pitched three

consecutive complete game victories, and Rick
Helling and Jamie Sepeda have followed with
solid efforts as well. Brian Sackinsky, who
looked good in three innings of work against
San Jose, will also be available for duty. But
the big test will be the temperamental Stan
ford hitting.
"They [Arizona] are definitely the most
experienced team in the Six-Pac," Marquess
said. "We've got to get some timely hitting."
With a concerted effort at the plate, solid
pitching, and a little luck, Stanford could come
out of the weekend in excellent position for a
run at the conference crown, which should go
down to the very last series.
Card Notes
Center fielder Jeffrey Hammonds was chosen Six-
Pac player of the week for the second consecutive
week after a four game, two double, two home run,
two stolen base, and 11-for-18 (.611) performance.
It looks like the junior out of Scotch Plains, N.J. is
finally ready to live up to all of the preseason hype
â€” and none too soon.
