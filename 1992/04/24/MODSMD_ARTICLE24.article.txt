# Marketability 101: Vardell, Whitfield pass NFL tests
## 
### 
The months of soul
searching are over.
We've got enough folks
trying to save the world, I've
decided. Enough lawyers,
enough journalists, politics are
out of style. I need the real
spotlight — fat contracts, cool
commercials, hard-ball negoti
ating. I want the money,
honey. Yesssir, I'm gonna be a
sports agent.

And today on the eve of the
NFL draft, Mr. Vardell and Mr.
Whitfield, like it or not, you get
the first free round of advice.
Dear Tommy: Let's get one
thing straight. Winning is not
everything. Image is every
thing. Andre Agassi was right
for once, but the punk had the
image all wrong.
Which is precisely what
makes me worried. Right now,
you're still "too good to be
true." Yet there's talk that
you'll end up in Atlanta, and
then all hell could break loose.
Coach Jerry Glanville dresses
like Darth Vader and he's
hated by every coach in the
league. Deion Sanders and
Andre Rison are trash talkers
who put Mr. T's gold chain col
lection to shame. M.C. Ham
mer "chills" in the locker room
with them. These people you do
not need.
We're selling good old-fash
ioned values here, Tommy. We
want to be spokesperson for
the Family Channel. We want
you endorsing Chevy trucks,
Levi's jeans, and AT&T "Call
Home America" programs. So,
no midnight rendezvous with
Madonna. And read my lips —
no Hammer videos. I don't care
if he gives a dozen pairs of
those baggy-crotch pants, for
get it. You might as well carry
around a baseball bat and tell
the world you're Down With

O.P.P.
Madison Avenue is looking
for football's Nice Guy, its Mr.
Rogers. Wanna-be rap stars are
a dime a dozen in the NFL.
Church-going, industrial engi
neering majors with homey
nicknames aren't. We read that
your favorite activity is hang
ing out with the family. For
endorsement dollars' sake,
Tommy, keep playing Scrabble.
Bob: it's been seven years
since a rookie lineman really
hit the big time. Since then
McDonald's ads have been
weak. They need a new icon.
They need you, Bob. They need
a Philosopher Fridge.
Let's think about what this
means. You've got to lose the
svelte look. So that's it, not
another workout before train
ing camp. We want calories,
calories, calories. No more sal
ads, no more pasta . . . just red
meat and milkshakes galore.
I'll kick in for desserts. You've
got to be tipping 375 come
August, Bob. We want coach
ranting and raving. We want
the front page headlines and all
the free pub we can get.
But there's more. Your
front two teeth? One of them
has to go. The gap-toothed
motif is a must. And then we
add the finishing touch: fish
bone glasses. CBS' broadcaster
Quinn Buckner became an
instant intellectual with just
one pair of specs during the
NCAA Tournament. You went
to Stanford, it'll be natural; be
cynical, be introspective, phi
losophize.
Deep Thoughts, by Bob
Whitfield. It takes a big line
man to knock a quarterback
unconscious. It takes a bigger
lineman to laugh at that quar
terback. A fat rookie tackle who
scores touchdowns is one
thing, a fat rookie tackle who
whips your butt on the SATs is
quite another. The shoe com
panies will be knocking down
your door.
And guys, years from now
when you're getting paid zil
lions for doing stretching exer
cises with a long-forgotten
Lennon tune blaring in the
background . . . just remember
who made it all possible.

to Stanford, it'll be natural; be
cynical, be introspective, phi
losophize.
Deep Thoughts, by Bob
Whitfield. It takes a big line
man to knock a quarterback
unconscious. It takes a bigger
lineman to laugh at that quar
terback. A fat rookie tackle who
scores touchdowns is one
thing, a fat rookie tackle who
whips your butt on the SATs is
quite another. The shoe com
panies will be knocking down
your door.
And guys, years from now
when you're getting paid zil
lions for doing stretching exer
cises with a long-forgotten
Lennon tune blaring in the
background . . . just remember
who made it all possible.
