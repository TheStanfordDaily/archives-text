## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
By all accounts, you might say that
the top collegiate crew teams in the
nation don't see Stanford as a national
contender this year.
Too bad no one told the Cardinal
that.
After varsity wins over UC-Davis
and Sacramento State, the Stanford
men's and women's crew teams are red
hot going into the Potomac Rowing

Championships this Saturday and Sun
day in Washington, D.C.
The women occupy third place in
the Pacific Coast League behind
Washington and California, while the
men trail Washington and UCLA in
league standings by only three sec
onds.
The Cardinal crew will see some of
the best crews in the country at the
Potomacs, including Yale, Princeton,
UCLA, Cambridge, and Oxford.
"I really think we have a shot

there," said senior women's crew mem
ber Bonnie Baker. We've been pushing
hard all year, and this is our chance to
prove ourselves."
The Cardinal women hope to chal
lenge national powers Yale and Penn
sylvania for the title.
The men also hope to challenge for
the title. "This is where we find out
how good we really are," said Peter-
Guarraia. "They [East Coast crews]
tend not to think too much of us, but
we're definitely ready for them."
