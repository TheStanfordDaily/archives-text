# Card sailors at San Diego for PCC's
## 
### Brian Border 
When the women's sailing team
travels to San Diego this weekend for
the Pacific Coast Championships, they
will have their work cut out for them.
The Cardinal will be fighting with
approximately eight other schools from
California, Arizona, and Hawaii in
order to qualify for the Women's
Nationals which begin on June 1.
Although Stanford will be facing
some tough competition, coach Blake

Middleton thinks his squad has a good
shot at making the cut.
"Only the top two, three, or four
teams will qualify, but I think Stanford
has a really good chance," he said.
"The favorite in this regatta is definite
ly UC-Irvine, who is the defending
champion, but it is pretty wide open."
The team's success will be dependent
on five experienced juniors, all of whom
have sailed in the Women's Nationals in
years past. In the A division of the race
the Cardinal will be led by skipper Haley

King and her crew Kathy Akers. In the
B division, Stanford will be represented
by alternating skippers Stacey Misakian
and Catherine Ivey and their crew lead
er Amy Lightner.
If the women are to sail to their full
potential, they will need to perform
solidly in both divisions throughout
the entire tournament.
According to Lightner, "We need to
sail consistently. If we have a poor
showing in one division, it will hurt our
chances."
