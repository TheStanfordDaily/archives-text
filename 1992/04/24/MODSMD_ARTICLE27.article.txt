# Big Meet: track at Cal
## 
### Nick Clements Staff writer 
While seven Stanford track and field
athletes compete for national prominence
this weekend in Philadelphia at the Penn
Relays, the rest of the team waits for the
Weenies.
The California meet, which is by far the
most important dual meet of the season,
will be at Berkely May 2.
"If you can't get excited in a meet with
the Weenies, then you don't belong in
track and field," said Stanford assistant
coach Scott Chisam, who is coaching this
weekend at the Penn Relays, one of the
most prestigious track and field event in
the United States today.
Distance runners Fred Carter, Gary
Stolz and Dave Scudamore will be
attempting to qualify for the NCAA
Championships at Penn. NCAA indoor
sprint champion Chryste Gaines will run
ning in the 100-meter dash, along with
NCAA indoor long jump champion Jackie
Edwards in the long and triple jumps.
The women's 4XIOO sprint relay team
of Ali Callicoatte, Rhonda Oliver, Gaines

and Edwards will be attempting to hit the
difficult qualifying time of 44.75 seconds.
They have already qualified provisionally
for the tournament but are hoping to
attain the more difficult automatic quali
fying time against tough competition at
Penn.
"The Penn Relays are probably the top
track and field meet in the country,"
Chisam said. "The event is truly a carni
val . . . there are going to be about 8500
athletes competing." Among the myriad
of prominent athletes who will be at
Penn this weekend are Carl Lewis, world
record holder in the 100-meter dash, and
Leroy Burrell, whose record Lewis
smashed at the World Championships
last year.
As for the Cal meet, the men are hoping
that their competitive strength in the mid
dle distance and throwing events will be
enough to make up for numerous holes
team-wise.
The women will be looking for revenge
after suffering a narrow defeat to the
Golden Bears last year.
"The meet will most likely come down
to the mile relay again," Chisam said.
