# Golf teams face big weekend meets
## Men in Intercollegiate 
### Andy Eiser Staff Writer 
Since last September, it has played on
courses from coast to coast, hit the links
against hundreds of the nation's best teams
and logged thousands upon thousands of "fre
quent flier" miles.
However, the Stanford Cardinal men's golf
team will finally put its name on the collegiate
golf map this weekend in both the literal and
figurative senses, as it hosts the United States
Intercollegiate Invitational tomorrow and
Sunday at the Stanford Golf Course.
The tournament will feature 17 teams par
ticipating in their final regular-season competi
tion before the various conference tournaments
begin next weekend.
The marquee squad will be that of Arizona,
the defending U.S. Intercollegiate champions
who are currently ranked second in the
nation. The Wildcats possess a deep lineup
that is headed by Manny Zerman and David
Berganio, both of whom made the cut at last
week's Masters in Augusta, Ga. Berganio was
recently named National "Pub-Links" Player
of the Year for 1991 by virtue of having the
lowest per-round score on public golf courses
of any player in the nation.
In order to make a run at the Wildcats and
other strong opponents, the Cardinal will
have to continue its recent surge — which
includes year-high fourth- and third-place fin

ishes in the team's last two tournaments
respectively — in addition to taking full
advantage of its home course edge. Head
coach Wally Goodwin feels that both the facil
ities and his charges will be ready for the chal
lenges that await them during a 36-hole Sat
urday and an 18-hole Sunday.
"The course is in the best shape for a tour
nament that I've seen in my four or five years
here," Goodwin said. "We're going to see some
great scores this weekend."
Senior Christian Cevaer, who will be taking
part in his final home match, will lead the way
for the Cardinal; he will be followed by sopho
mores Casey Martin and Notah Begay, junior
Brad Lanning and freshman Steve Burdick.
These top five will be the group that earns the
team score for Stanford this weekend.
