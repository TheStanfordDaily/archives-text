# Faculty salary hike trails other schools'
## 'Effective' pay increase this year is one of lowest ever at Stanford 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
Average faculty salaries at
Stanford effectively increased by
only 2 percent this year, reflect
ing a national trend of decreasing
faculty pay raises. The raise is one
of the lowest ever at Stanford.
The figure was even lower
than the national average of 3.5
percent, which was the smallest
increase in more than 20 years.
Interim Provost Gerald Lieber
man said the current rate of pay
increase at Stanford is 4 percent.

but that rate
began in March
after six months
in which salaries
were not raised
because of bud
get woes.
He said the
University chose
to apply the raise
in this manner

rather than apply a 2 percent
raise from the beginning of the
year to provide a higher base for
next year's salary increase.
Even the 4 percent raise lags
behind other schools. The average
increase at other private doctoral
institutions, such as Harvard and
Yale, was 4.7 percent.
But even though pay raises are
declining, Stanford's faculty remain

among the best-paid in the nation.
This year, on average, Stan
ford's assistant professors were
paid $48,300, while its associate
professors were paid $61,700.
Both of those salary levels were
second-highest in the nation,
exceeded only by Caltech's.
Stanford's full professors
made an average of $86,500, the
fourth-highest salary after Har
vard, Caltech and Princeton.
The low pay-increase was a con
tinuation of a trend that has been
at work here for the past few years
as a result of budgetary problems.
"The percent raise has been
declining" in the last few years,
said Asst. Provost Kathryn Gillam.
Some professors said yesterday
they realize the limitations that
budget difficulties have placed on
salary increases, but hope the sit
uation will improve.
Civil Engineering Prof. Gil
Masters said he is willing to take a
curb on faculty pay raises for a
time, but added, "I hope it doesn't
continue that way, especially when
you see baseball players, movie
stars and corporate executives
(making extremely high salaries).
It must be annoying for anyone
working on a standard wage."
According to Gillam, the
decline has been the combined


Lieberman
result of many factors, both
"external market factors [and)
internal budgetary constraints."
"The earthquake happened
and we decided that we had to cut
back, [then we had the] big indi
rect cost problem" that also took
its toll, she said.
Because of external factors —
which include the nationwide trend
of lower pay raises and a lower
inflation rate — the University has
not had to offer high raises in order
to compete with other schools, both
Gillam and Lieberman said.
"We assume that we are being

competitive because we under
stand that the problems that
exist" at Stanford exist nation
wide, Lieberman said.
"We can't allow ourselves to fall
way behind," Gillam said. "Even
though we've had severe budget
cuts, the University has tried very
hard to remain competitive."
But, as Applied Earth Sciences
Prof. Stephan Graham noted, the
University still cannot compete
with industry.
"Certainly, I am not here for
the salary reasons," he said.
According to Graham, the
attraction has been a combination
of "quality of students [and) the
opportunity that Stanford offers"
for research.
"At least for research-oriented

faculty in the sciences, that has
been, and continues to be, the
attraction," he said.
Gillam said the attraction the
University presents "varies a lot
by discipline," so while equipment
and laboratory space may be most
important for a researcher in the
natural sciences, the ability to go
to conferences or to take sabbati
cal leave may matter more in
other disciplines.
One trend that has remained
constant at Stanford is the huge
disparity between the salaries of
faculty in different schools.
In 1990-91, the median salary
for a professor in the humanities
was $71,500, in Engineering
$84,800 and in Law $98,175.
"Those trends are long-term

trends," Gillam said. She said
"those differences reflect differ
ences in the professions nation
wide."
Although Stanford's national
ranking in average salaries
"varies a fair amount" by disci
pline, Stanford generally ranks
among the top five to 10 institu
tions in the nation for each indi
vidual school, Gillam said.
Anthropology Prof. Clifford
Barnett said, "The University's
been very explicit about [this dis
parity]. It's a function of the mar
ketplace."
He said faculty members from
engineering and the sciences "can
all make good salaries on the out
side," which helps explain the high
er salaries Stanford pays them.
