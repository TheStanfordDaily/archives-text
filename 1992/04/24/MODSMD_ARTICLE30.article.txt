# Women go to Pac 10's
## 
### Tish Williams Staff Writer 
Hoping to continue their upward trend, the
Stanford women's golf team heads to Arizona
for the Pacific 10 Conference Championships
to be held on the Karsten Golf Course, Ari
zona State's home course.
In three days of play, starting today, the
Cardinal will test itself against five of the top
-10 teams in the nation as well as several of the
top-10 individual golfers.
Stanford has been climbing its way to the
top since Spring Break, coming in second in its
last two tournaments behind number-one

ranked Arizona in Hawaii and number-two
ranked San Jose State in Monterrey.
Stanford was a mere one point behind Ari
zona in the Hawaii Intercollegiate, and this
weekend will give the accomplished Arizona
squad a run for their money. Arizona leads a
tough Pac-10 this year, including No. 3 UCLA
and the No. 6 Cardinal.
"It's a very powerful field this year, team
wise, and also will feature a lot of key players
going for the individual title," said coach Tim
Baldwin. "It will be very competitive. It's a
very difficult golf course, built on an old
riverbed."
Audrey Wooding will lead the Cardinal
after a third place finish in Monterrey along
with Adele Moore — always a leader for Stan
ford. Martha Richards, who has been consis
tent so far in the season will provide some sta
bility for the Cardinal. Amy Lawrence will be
competing on the team for the first time in
several tournaments, and Melinda Daniels
completes the lineup after having an impres
sive performance on the Karsten course at the
beginning of the Fall season.
The Stanford players have quite a bit of
experience on the course, but the Arizona and
Arizona State squads will benefit from their
familiarity with the Karsten course. The Car
dinal needs to pull off some really good rounds
of golf in order to overthrow the Arizona
squad led by the defending NCAA individual
champion Annika Sorenstram. Fortunately
Stanford has demonstrated that potential so
far this season, but it needs all five golfers to
come through this weekend.
