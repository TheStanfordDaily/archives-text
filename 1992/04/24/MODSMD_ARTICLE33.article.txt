Politicking follows Mexican explosions
GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) — Fearing more explosions,
authorities yesterday evacuated a neighborhood near a working
class district wrecked a day earlier by sewer-line blasts. The govern
ment said at least 176 people had died, half of them children.
Moving quickly to control potential political damage, President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari gave his attorney general 72 hours to deter
mine who was at fault for Mexico's deadliest explosion since 1984.
Authorities said the likely cause of the blasts was either volatile
hexane leaked by La Central cooking-oil company or spilled gasoline
from the national oil company, Pemex. Officials from both compa
nies denied responsibility.
How 'green' are senate candidates?
SACRAMENTO (AP) — One Republican and five Democrats —
all contenders for the U.S. Senate this year — are "very strong envi
ronmental candidates" with documented backgrounds in conserva
tion and resource protection, the California League of Conservation
Voters said in a study released yesterday.
The organization said Reps. Barbara Boxer, Mel Levine and Tom
Campbell; state controller Gray Davis, Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy and for
mer San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein all had "strong" environ

mental backgrounds. Campbell is the sole Republican.
The "bad" included appointed incumbent Sen. John Seymour
and Palm Springs Mayor Sonny Bono, both Republicans, while the
"ugly" category included Rep. Bill Dannemeyer and Los Angeles
television commentator Bruce Herschensohn.
Youth shot while viewing 'American Me'
INDUSTRY, Calif. (AP) — A 17-year-old movie patron was shot

movie "American Me," authorities said.
Marco Facio died at the AMC Puente Mall 4 Theatres and an

Deputy Ron Weber said it wasn't known if the 11:15 p.m. Wednes
day shooting was gang related. He said no arrests had been made.
U.S. may move against Haiti
WASHINGTON (AP) — Faced with a continuing exodus of Haitian
boat people, the United States is considering additional measures to
pressure Haiti's militaiy-controlled government to return to demo
cratic rule, Bush administration officials say.
One such measure would tighten the embargo against Haiti by bar
ring tankers that deliver oil to Haiti from making stops at U.S. ports.
