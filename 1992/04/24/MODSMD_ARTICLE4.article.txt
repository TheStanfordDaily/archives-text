# Incoming leaders discuss structure of COP-less ASSU
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
In a meeting last night to
determine the future of student
government, newly-elected ASSU
senators and Council of Presi
dents members largely opposed
creating a non-salaried "executive
committee" to replace the COP,
instead favoring a structure that
would expand the role of existing
senate committees.
The meeting — attended by
about 20 senators-elect, three
members of the recently-elected "I
Prefer Not to Have a COP" slate,
one current COP member and sev
eral current senators — discussed
how to govern the ASSU next year
without a COP.
Prefer slate member Ted Lai
said he felt the ASSU would be
"sidestepping student opinion" if it

set up a COP-like body, adding that
the election of the Prefer slate indi
cated no such group was wanted.
Undergraduate senator-elect
Peter Cousins agreed, saying stu
dents "don't want this arbitrary
executive committee set up."
But undergraduate senator
elect Jason Payne said, "It is our
body's duty at this point to make
the changes," adding that the
COP can only offer suggestions.
The Prefer slate won the COP
race in last week's ASSU elections.
It has pledged to abolish the COP
by placing a constitutional amend
ment dismantling the body on
next spring's ballot.
Prefer slate member Ed Mun
said the slate has a "very, very
rough model" of how they want to
structure student government
next year, but added that the
model might change after slate
members talk to administrators
and senators in upcoming weeks.
Currently, Mun said, the slate
wants a "pseudo-executive branch"
that would utilize ASSU commit
tees to take over the COP's func
tions, rather than a temporary
executive committee.
Mun said the new structure could
include committees on student ser
vices and business projects, and a
"liaison committee to deal with the
role of being a student voice."
Beth Morgan, a current COP
member, said the senate must
become more productive if it is to
pick up the slack left by the disso
lution of the COP.
Morgan said that in the absence
of a COP, the senate would have to
do more than "sit in a meeting for
three to eight hours every other
Tuesday."
She said the main functions of
the current COP are giving stu
dent input to the administration
and starting projects to serve the
student body, like Flicks.
The idea of instituting a "tem
porary executive committee" that
would "take over all the duties of
the COP," proposed by under
graduate senator-elect Tyler Kim,
met with almost no support dur
ing the meeting.
The most popular idea seemed
to be dividing the jobs currently
carried out by the COP among the
five standing ASSU committees
— budget and finance, adminis

tration and rules, appropriations,
education, research and resi
dences and student affairs — and
the steering committee.
Derek Miyahara, a current grad
uate senator who was reelected last
week, proposed the idea of utilizing
the existing councils. Under Miya
hara's plan, the financial and
administrative managers, instead of
reporting to the COP, would be
placed under the budget and admin
istration committees, respectively.
The executive committee —
which, according to the ASSU
Bylaws, currently "functional as
a communications link between
the officers of the Association" —
would supervise the internal run
ning of the ASSU.
The steering committee, which
currently serves as a liaison
between the standing commit
tees, would become the new link
between student government and
the administration.
Miyahara also advocated mak
ing use of the university commit
tee cabinet — an existing but
unused ASSU committee that
brings all students on University
committees together to help coor
dinate student input.
"We haven't created any new
committees" through this plan,
Miyahara said. "We're just redefin
ing the committees in the bylaws."
He said the plan would
increase the importance of the
senate committees and "give the
senators a lot more to do."
Jason Snyder, who ran unsuc
cessfully for COP with the "Inde
pendents: A New Era" slate, said
"the committee idea is good," and
would provide an administration
"lightning rod."
