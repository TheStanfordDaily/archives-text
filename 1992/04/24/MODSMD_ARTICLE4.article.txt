# Incoming leaders discuss structure of COP-less ASSU
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
In a meeting last night to
determine the future of student
government, newly-elected ASSU
senators and Council of Presi
dents members largely opposed
creating a non-salaried "executive
committee" to replace the COP,
instead favoring a structure that
would expand the role of existing
senate committees.
The meeting — attended by
about 20 senators-elect, three
members of the recently-elected "I
Prefer Not to Have a COP" slate,
one current COP member and sev
eral current senators — discussed
how to govern the ASSU next year
without a COP.
Prefer slate member Ted Lai
said he felt the ASSU would be
"sidestepping student opinion" if it

set up a COP-like body, adding that
the election of the Prefer slate indi
cated no such group was wanted.
Undergraduate senator-elect
Peter Cousins agreed, saying stu
dents "don't want this arbitrary
executive committee set up."
But undergraduate senator
elect Jason Payne said, "It is our
body's duty at this point to make
the changes," adding that the
COP can only offer suggestions.
The Prefer slate won the COP
race in last week's ASSU elections.
It has pledged to abolish the COP
by placing a constitutional amend
ment dismantling the body on
next spring's ballot.
Prefer slate member Ed Mun
said the slate has a "very, very
rough model" of how they want to
structure student government
