# Gorbachev tickets are gone in a flash

Tickets for former Soviet Pres
ident Mikhail Gorbachev's May 9
address at Stanford disappeared
faster than an ailing Communist
regime.
All 7,000 tickets for Gor
bachev's lunchtime speech at
Frost Amphitheater were dis
tributed in four hours yesterday
morning, angering hundreds of
students who arrived too late.
"There is a lot of confusion,
because students [thought] they
were guaranteed two tickets
each," said Tresidder Ticket Office
Director Randi Alves. She said a
"near riot" occurred around 2 p.m.
when a large group of students
found out all the tickets gone.
"They were like a vigilante
group, feeding off each other's
frustration at not being able to
get tickets," said Alves. The stu

dents made "nasty comments"
and "demanded to speak to some
one in charge," she said.
Sophomore Jeremy Denton,
who observed the fracas, dubbed
it"the Tresidder Ticket Coup."
Students began lining up out
side the ticket office at 7 a.m. yes
terday for the 1,800 tickets to be
distributed there. The remaining
tickets were distributed at the
Athletic Department office, the
law and medical schools and four
other campus locations.
Students, faculty and staff
with current Stanford ID were
eligible for two free tickets to the
address. Tickets at Tresidder
were gone by noon.
"We started sending people to
the Athletic Department office in
case they had tickets," Alves said.
"They called us and told us not to
send any more people, since they
were sold out as well."
Officials originally intended to
distribute tickets on campus yes
terday and today from 9 a.m. until
6 p.m., then offer the remaining
tickets to the general public.
"We had no expectation they
would go as fast as they did," said
Events and Services Director Lois
Wagner.
The speech was moved to Frost
from the 1,700-seat Memorial
Auditorium, the site of Gor
bachev's 1990 address, to accom
modate a larger crowd.
Hundreds of students camped
out in 1990 to obtain tickets to see
Gorbachev, who had just been
named "Man of the Decade" by
Time magazine.
Tickets for Gorbachev's 1990
address were issued by lottery.
Scalpers reportedly resold tickets
for as much as $1,800 each.
Gorbachev's 1992 visit will be
part of a 16-day trip through the
United States.
Proposed redistribution
Yesterday's ticket shortage
prompted student action in addi
tion to student anger.
A group of students
approached Ted Mitchell, an assis
tant to the president and provost,
proposing that officials move the

address to Stanford Stadium.
Mitchell, who did not get a
ticket himself, refused to com
ment on the possibility of moving
the address to a larger venue.
"A lot of people, including me,
are interested in going to see Gor
bachev," Mitchell said. "We're
looking into the options."
The students also proposed a
redistribution of tickets, hoping
to have tickets distributed today
declared null and void. They said
the two-tickets-per-ID rule con
centrated tickets in the hands of
too few ticket seekers.
"Very few people knew that
tickets were being offered today,"
said freshman Ethan Lowry.
"And those who knew they were
being distributed thought that
there was no rush to pick them
up, that everyone who wanted one
could get a ticket."
Wagner said she hopes to
enable more people to see the
address by having it broadcast on
SUNet, Stanford's closed-circuit
cable network. No decision regard
ing the proposed broadcast will be
made until Monday, she added.
Generous move
Some students' eagerness to
get tickets evidently did not over
come their philanthropy.
An elderly Russian woman,
who had stood in line since early
yesterday morning, was denied a
ticket after several hours' wait.
"She was obviously a recent imrni

grant, and spoke in half-English,
half-Russian accent," Alves said.
"She said T want to see my president.
I just want to see my president* But
we couldn't give her a ticket, since she
was not staff or a student.
"I had to turn her away, but as
she walked off, I saw someone
give her one of their tickets. It
was really touching."
Howard Conrad, a barber at
the Stanford Hairstyling Shop in
Tresidder, said his only opportu
nity to see Gorbachev will be if
the former Soviet president needs
a haircut.
"I'll cut Gorbachev's hair for
free," Conrad said. "I think it
would be pretty easy."
