The Winnebago parked just behind the Palo Alto
Caltrain station appears deserted. For most of the
day the only signs of life are the scurrying squir
rels that nibble at leftovers on the ground.
But as local homeless people and a handful of
Stanford student volunteers know, the area
comes alive on weekday mornings, when the trail
er becomes "Rolling Estates," a drop-in homeless
center run by the Palo Alto-based Urban Ministry
organization.
About 30 to 50 Stanford students work at the
center each year, according to Jim Burklo,
Urban Ministry's director. Many of them are
referred to the center by the Stanford Home
lessness Action Coalition, which also works on
projects there.
Theo Emery, SHAC's coordinator, said SHAC
became familiar with Burklo two years ago,
through a SWOPSI class on homelessness that
Burklo taught.
The ensuing relationship has been mutually
beneficial, Burklo said: The center is provided
with extra help, while the students get a hands
on chance at helping the homeless.
A day in the life
Every weekday morning, at least 150 people
"roll in" to "have coffee, just hang out and eat,"
said Joe Haletsy, Urban Ministry's assistant
director. "These people really feel the sense of
belonging to a community," he added.
