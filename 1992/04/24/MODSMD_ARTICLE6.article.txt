# A 						safe haven for homeless of Palo Alto
## Stanford volunteers join project that offers food, clothes, sympathetic ear 
### Tara Raman Angie Chuang 
The Winnebago parked just behind the Palo Alto
Caltrain station appears deserted. For most of the
day the only signs of life are the scurrying squir
rels that nibble at leftovers on the ground.
But as local homeless people and a handful of
Stanford student volunteers know, the area
comes alive on weekday mornings, when the trail
er becomes "Rolling Estates," a drop-in homeless
center run by the Palo Alto-based Urban Ministry
organization.
About 30 to 50 Stanford students work at the
center each year, according to Jim Burklo,
Urban Ministry's director. Many of them are
referred to the center by the Stanford Home
lessness Action Coalition, which also works on
projects there.
Theo Emery, SHAC's coordinator, said SHAC
became familiar with Burklo two years ago,
through a SWOPSI class on homelessness that
Burklo taught.
The ensuing relationship has been mutually
beneficial, Burklo said: The center is provided
with extra help, while the students get a hands
on chance at helping the homeless.
A day in the life
Every weekday morning, at least 150 people
"roll in" to "have coffee, just hang out and eat,"
said Joe Haletsy, Urban Ministry's assistant
director. "These people really feel the sense of
belonging to a community," he added.

Jim Burklo, director of Urban Ministry of Palo Alto, spends his mornings working with
local homeless people out of his organization's Winnebago. About 30 to 50 Stanford
students join the volunteer effort each year, Burklo said.
Haletky said the five-year-old
Winnebago was originally bought to
"take from place to place," but once
the batteries "were dead and gone,"
it was decided to keep it in one spot
that has easy access to the highway.
Rolling Estates' eight staff
members and 350 volunteers
work together to "provide the
full range of survival needs,"
Haletky said. Services include
food, clothes, meal and shelter
programs and casework assis
tance.
A typical morning starts with
the distribution of bus tokens and
shower passes. A shower pass can
be used at the YMCA around the
corner. At the end of the month,
Urban Ministry pays a bill of
about $300 to the YMCA.
Mailboxes and a voicemail sys
tem provide addresses and phone
numbers to the wandering home
less of the neighborhood. It is a
"way for others to get in touch
with them," Haletky said.
Burklo said a staff of case work
ers provide advocacy for homeless
people. "It's not psychotherapy,"
he pointed out. "They just listen
to people."
Case workers also help people
obtain Social Security, disability

benefits, mental health services,
housing placements and jobs,
Burklo said. The most recent pro
ject is a voter registration drive.
Last year, Rolling Estates
assisted about 38,000 people from
localities around Palo Alto,
according to Haletky.
Urban Ministry is a non-profit
group, with 75 percent of its
$365,000 income coming from 30
churches and congregations in
Palo Alto. The remaining funds
are from the city of Palo Alto,
individual donations and corpo
rate agencies.
Haletky said the 8-year-old
organization started when volun
teers at the food closet of a church
in Palo Alto realized that many of
the people they fed regularly were
still unable to provide themselves
with basic nutrition.
Student volunteers
Sophomore Julia Gonzalez
Luna, a SHAC coordinator, said
she has volunteered at Rolling
Estates several times. "We basi
cally go and sit and talk to peo
ple," she said.
Emery said the first time he vol
unteered at Rolling Estates, he felt
awkward because "it was painfully
obvious that I wasn't homeless and
that I was a Stanford student."
"Sometimes you're afraid of
coming off condescending," Gonza
lez Luna said. "But if you just show

that you're not uncomfortable,
most people will really open up and
you have really good conversation."
Emery said he likes the "casual
atmosphere" and added that "the
folks there are really nice."
Non-threatening environment
"We want to create a safe envi
ronment where people can change
if they want to," Haletky said.
"They learn to look beyond the
urgency of daily survival and take
a longer view of things and life on
a non-threatening and non-hus
tling basis."
Homeless people out in the
streets "hustle to live" and feel a
sense of competition with each
other, he said. They "need to
belong somewhere because they
are isolated from each other as
well as society."
While Rolling Estates provides
this place to belong, the center's
workers "try not to foster depen
dency," Haletky added.
Rolling Estate workers said they
also try to maintain their sense of
humor as much as possible.
A medicinal spray can that reads
"Bullshit Repellant," tucked away
in one corner of the trailer, is one of
the gimmicks that keeps the atmo
sphere light. A whiff of it is delivered
to people who use a typical denial
statement as an excuse for not try
ing to improve their situation.
A compilation of the most fre

quently used denials accompanies
the can. One of them reads: "I
drink because I'm depressed (and
I'm depressed because I drink)."
Bread and Asphalt
Burklo brought his experience
with the homeless to Stanford
through his SWOPSI class "Bread
and Asphalt."
He first taught the class two
years ago, and he returned last
quarter with the goal of creating a
money management booklet to pub
lish and distribute to the homeless.
The students in the class, in
addition to visiting Rolling
Estates and various other home
less shelters, researched and
wrote material for the pamphlet
as their action projects.
"They did a fine job," Burklo
said. "Having that many different
research angles was very helpful."
Burklo plans to compile the stu
dents' work, publish the booklet and
distribute it to non-profit groups.
When Burklo taught the class
two years ago, the students con
ducted a study of occupants of sin
gle-room occupancy hotels that
eventually was incorporated into
the Housing Element of the City
of Palo Alto.
Burklo said teaching the class
was "a blast," and he is sorry to
see the SWOPSI program go. It is
scheduled to be eliminated next
year as a part of budget cuts.
