# Giving up Food Service for a day Proceeds from fast will fund projects in Guatemala
## 
### Craig Kersemeier Staff writer 
Although a campus-wide fast sponsored by the
Stanford International Development Organization
is scheduled for today, dining hall lines won't be
much shorter than usual.
Only 379 of the 3,700 students on University food
service plans signed up to donate food-service meals
to the project, despite an advertising campaign that
included ads in The Daily, banners displayed in res
idences, a table in White Plaza, dorm presentations
and visits to cafeterias.
The funds raised by the project will go to a well
construction and improvement project in Las Flores,
Guatemala.
Event organizers and Food Service officials
agreed that participation in the annual fast has
decreased significantly this year.
Food Service administrator Karolyn Gaskin
blamed the season for the low turnout, citing stu
dent participation in other activities. Similar fasts
held in the fall tend to yield a higher participation
rate, she said.
"People are less gung-ho about doing programs
by the spring quarter," said senior Tracy Boyer, a
member of the organization.
For every meal signed over by participating stu
dents, Housing and Food Services has promised to
donate money to the project.
Students with a-la-carte meal plans can choose
the size of their donation, with a maximum of $10.
Participating students on the traditional board
plan will be unable to purchase meals on campus
today. Students with points will still be able to use
them.

Food Service donates only food costs — typically
$3 to $4 per day per person — for meals donated
from all-you-can-eat board plans, according to
Gaskin.
Food Service officials plan no reduction in staff in
response to the event, and "with the small number
of participants the difference in (the amount of) food
we need to prepare is minimal," she said.
Organizers said the event is effective because it
makes students think about hunger and poverty.
"We know it's unrealistic to approximate what
hunger is like. What we want to do is raise aware
ness," Boyer said. "In a time when people are think
ing about summer options, what we hope is that
they'll consider spending time working in a Third
World country."
Junior Chris Stevens said that although he has
participated in similar fasts, he will not join today's
because he is hosting a prospective freshman and
wants "to be social and participate with my pro fro
in all aspects of campus life — including the dining
experience."
Sophomore Darren Donnely said he will give up
his food service meals because "to me the cost is
minimal and potentially, if everyone joins in, a lot of
good could be done."
Organizers are also planning an address by anti
hunger activist Hazaiah Williams and a video pre
sentation on Guatemala tonight at the Bechtel
International Center.
Students who are not participating in the fast can
still donate money to the project at a table in White
Plaza today, Boyer said.
The fast is also happening at eleven other univer
sities, including the UCa-Santa Cruz and World Col
lege West.
