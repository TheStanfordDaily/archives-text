'Commercial paper' could save millions
A program to refinance some of the University's debt may save
Stanford an estimated $2 million a year.
The University's asset managers recently began offering tax
able "commercial paper," a form of short-term debt obligation, to
its investors.
Over the next few months, the Stanford Management Compa
ny will refinance about $130 million of outstanding loans and
advances to internal investors.
Many campus clients have been borrowing at the prime rate,
currently about 6.5 percent. The successful initial issue of com
mercial paper will lower that rate for them â€” and eventually save
the University money.
Commercial paper started in the 19th century, when industri
al companies used it to raise funds during periods when local
banks could not meet the demand for loans.
Stanford films shown at festival
Three films by Stanford filmmakers will be shown as part of
the San Francisco International Film Festival, which began yes
terday and continues through May 7.
"Empire of the Moon," a documentary dealing with the ideolo
gy of tourism, was made by Communication Prof. Kristine
Samuelson and her husband, John Haptas. The film was pho
tographed in Paris by Stanford alumnus John Else, currently
filmmaker-in-residence in the Communication Department.
Two master of arts diploma films by students in the depart
ment will also be shown. Elizabeth Finlayson's "In and Out of
Time" is a documentary about a woman afflicted with
Alzheimer's disease, and Robert Tullis' "Family Outing to Jesus
land" is a short narrative film.
All three films were awarded Golden Gate Awards.
