It is with great pride that Volcano
Press announces the 1991 updated edi
tion of LESBIAN/WOMAN, a ground
breaking classic, first published in 1972.
This landmark book described Lesbian
lives and experiences in a positive,
knowledgeable way rare at the time. The
authors, Del Martin and Phllis Lyon,
are founders of the oldest Lesbian
organization in America, the Daughters
of Bilitis.
Partners for 38 years, they have con
sistently pioneered Lesbian and wom
en's rights work, and are still in the fore
front of these movements. they
look back on many awards and appoint
ments — from city and state commis
sions to the Earl Warren Civil Liberties
Award of 199 a
Other gay activists describe them as
almost mythological, as role models and
"mothers of the movement," But Martin
and Lyon say about themselves, "We
decided never to become martyrs to any
cause — we always had a lot of fun."
And it is in this joyous yet powerful
historical report that the last twenty
years of Lesbian emergence and tri
umphs come to life.
The completely updated text con
cludes with the Lesbian conference held
in Atlanta, Geotgia in April 1991.
