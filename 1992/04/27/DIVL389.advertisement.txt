Guaranteed Student Loans
Stanford Students (who are members of the Credit Union) may
apply for a Stanford Federal Credit Union student loan. The
Government guaranteed Stafford Student Loan Program provides
low-interest loans for students with financial need. Payments are
deferred until after students leave school.
Come to SFCU for a student loan and we'll process your application overnight
-not over a week or two, like banks take.
With our guaranteed student loans, you can get the money you need to
help you with expenses this academic year.
* $2,625, $4,000, or $7,500 a year in low-interest Stafford Student Loans
- amount depends on your academic year

- no proof of financial need is required
* $4,000 a year in Parental Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS)

(The Credit Union and Financial Aids Office can give you the details on the loan programs including restrictions.)
And you can get your money fast. Applying is easy
1. Get an application. Pick up your Stafford, SLS, or Plus
application at any Credit Union office or at the Financial Aids
Office, or call us at 694-1000 to get your application by mail.
2. Complete and return your application to the Financial Aids
Office by May 1 for certification of eligibility and forwarding
