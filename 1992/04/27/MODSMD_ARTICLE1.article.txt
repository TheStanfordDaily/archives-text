Stanford graduate student Andreas
Drexler shot and killed his former girl
friend in her Indiana University dormito
ry Thursday night, injuring another stu
dent who tried to help her and killing
himself an hour later.
Indiana University Police Chief George
Huntington said the murder of graduate
student Susan Clements was probably
premeditated. Considering the amount of
ammunition Drexler brought with him
and other circumstances, "it seems that
he arrived for the purpose of killing her,"
Huntington said.
Drexler, a third-year graduate student
in computer science, dated Clements for
about three years, according to her
father, Robert Clements, an adjunct fac
ulty member in history at the Indiana

University campus in South Bend.
Susan Clements, who was 23 and a
second-year graduate student in English,
ended her relationship with Drexler sev
eral months ago, but he continued to
harass her with threatening phone calls.
Last week, Drexler drove to Blooming
ton, Ind. to see Clements, bringing a 9mm
Glock, a high-capacity weapon holding 13
-15 rounds, and a .22-caliber semiauto
matic handgun with him.
Huntington said a fight broke out
between Drexler and Clements outside her
14th floor dorm room around 8 p.m. He did
not know if Drexler had waited for
Clements at her door or accompanied her in.
During the struggle, Clements screamed
and was heard by another student, Steven
Molen, who pulled Drexler away from her.
Another resident separated Molen and
Drexler, pushing Molen away to prevent
further violence.

Drexler shot Molen in the abdomen,
and then fired 9 more shots, hitting
Clements three times — in the head, neck
and chest, Huntington said. She died
immediately.
Several other dorm residents heard
the struggle and the shots.
Indiana University graduate student
Christine Bolus, who lives on the floor
below Clements', said she heard a man
shouting and a woman screaming "No!"
When Bolus stepped out to see what
was happening, she saw Drexler run
down the stairwelL He was gone by the
time police reached the dormitory.
Police searched the surrounding area,
alerting residents about Drexler. Around
9 p.m., officers heard what they believed
were muffled shots, Huntington said.
At about 9:30 p.m., police discovered
Drexler's body behind a bush. Hunting
ton said Drexler had shot himself in the

middle of his forehead.
Molen, an Indiana University senior
from Salt Lake City, was taken to a
Bloomington Hospital where he under
went three hours of surgery . As of yester
day, he was still in very critical condition.
'Things were not going well'
Clements met Drexler during her
sophomore year abroad in France, while
Drexler — who is a German native — was
attending a German university, her
father said.
During the three years they dated,
Drexler visited her often, staying with
the Clements during nearly every vaca
tion, he said.
Drexler's close friend, graduate stu
dent Adnan Darwiche, said Susan
Clements "was a big part of his life. He
was always talking about her."
"They had a quasi-engagement, but it

withered as time went on," Clements'
father said. "She decided she wanted to
break it off last summer.. .. Susan made
a clean break."
Drexler continued to call her, though,
and even arrived unannounced at Indi
ana to see her in November. "He started
threatening her on the phone — harass
ing her," Clements said.
For several months, Drexler called
three or four times a day, according to
Huntington. Clements reported the calls
to the police on March 9 and had her
phone number changed.
Clements believed she was safe
because Drexler was away at Stanford,
despite the threats he had made about
having "someone in Bloomington do her
harm," Huntington said.

knew about the break-up, but
thought Drexler had gotten over
it.
Darwiche said Drexler first
began to talk about problems in
the relationship in January. "He
said that things were not going
well and didn't really want to talk
about it," Darwiche said.
Ron Frederick, a Ph.D candi
date in computer science who has
known Drexler for three years,
said that by this month, Drexler
seemed to have accepted the
breakup.
David Dill, Drexler's adviser
and an assistant professor in com
puter science, said Drexler was
sad about the breakup, but "his

attitude was philosophical,
mature."
Several of Drexler's close
friends were surprised that he
had done something so violent.

'He was a gentle guy. I
would have never con
sidered him capable of
this.'
— Ron Frederick

"He was a gentle guy," Frederick
said. "I would have never consid
ered him capable of this."
Dill also described Drexler as
"normal and friendly."
"He seemed to be a gentle per
son," Dill said. "I was amazed at
all this gun stuff."

Drexler's roommate in Rains,
who asked not to be identified,
was also surprised by the vio
lence.
"He was the kind of person
who would have opposed guns,"
he said, adding that Drexler had
once mentioned that there was "a
need for gun control in this coun
try."
Another friend of Drexler,
Ph.D candidate Orli Waarts, said
she was especially surprised by
the violence because Drexler had
told her he had resisted the Ger
man military draft because of "his
pacifist feelings."
Drexler was last seen at Stan
ford on Sunday morning, April
19. Frederick said Drexler had
mentioned that he was planning
to take the week off to vacation in
the Grand Canyon. "I had no idea
he was going to Indiana," he said.
