Cancelling financial aid
due to student drug use
is an invasion of privacy

sidering that much of the Univer
sity's need-based aid comes from
federal funds and casual drug use
on campus is not unheard of.
Of course, federal aid should not
be completely free of stipulations.
It is important that the federal gov
ernment ensures that schools not
discriminate against individuals on
the basis of race, gender or sexual
orientation by refusing assistance
to those which do.
But the Justice Department's
actions are blatant attempts at
social control achieved through
streamlining the actions of stu
dents to suit a bland conception of
human behavior.
Student activism often has been
viewed with hostility by the cur
rent administration, and the policy
seems to be an indirect attempt on
the part of the government to tar
get a student population at which
it is politically at odds.
The use of marijuana is legally a
misdemeanor, but the federal pro
posal effectively places it in the
same category as crimes such as
burglary, rape or murder. This is a
gross exaggeration of the poten
tially harmful consequences of
casual drug usage.
People with drug problems who
lose federal financial aid may be
forced to drop out of school, but
such a punishment is unlikely to
encourage them to stop using drugs.
The cycle of addiction would be
strengthened rather than addressed
through the Justice Department's
punitive measure. Instead of attack
ing the superficial manifestations of
a malady, attention should be
focused on educational and rehabili
tation problems that drug abusers
need.
One of the Justice Department's
arguments is that the loss of finan
cial aid will be more of a threat
than a mere prison sentence.
Instead of this view, which aims
to cure through scare tactics and
punishment, a more positive
approach based on understanding
and tolerance must be adopted to
address the issue.

THE DRIVE BY THE federal
government to revoke finan
cial aid to students convicted
of drug use is preposterous.
Under the plan administered by
the U.S. Justice Department's
"Denial of Federal Benefits Pro
gram" initiative, students could
lose their rights to Pell Grants,
post-secondary school loans and
various occupational and profes
sional licenses if convicted for drug
use or trafficking.
If the aggressive enthusiasm
exhibited by the Bush administra
tion on this issue were trans
ferred to the arena of higher edu
cation, the nation's schools and
colleges would be able to find
their way out of their prevalent
fiscal crisis.
Attaching strings to the disper
sal of federal monies for students
constitutes an intolerable incur
sion into the privacy of individuals
and must be vigorously opposed.
At a time when we have a gov
ernment that is attempting to
reverse civil liberties such as a
woman's right to abortion, this
action represents a dangerous
trend in a direction slanted away
from the protection of individual
freedoms.
For an administration based on
the premise of less governmental
interference, the Justice Depart
ment's action is patently hypocrit
ical.
According to a Justice Depart
ment spokeswoman, more than a
third of college students receive
federal funds, and at least half of
this group has experimented with
drugs deemed illegal by the cur
rent administration.
In the light of these figures, the
federal government's action will
have widespread repercussions.
Stanford will also be affected, con-
