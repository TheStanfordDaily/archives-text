## A
						little league spectacular 
### 
SPRING - THE SUN SHINES
brightly and long. At little league
fields around the country, boys and
girls learn to play the game of baseball.
And every so often a brilliant spectacle
occurs — so pure in its splendor that it
lights up the grass in the park with more
energy than the sun ever could. One such
moment took place yesterday at Palo
Alto's Middlefield Park.
About 80 minutes after it began, the
game was still scoreless, with but one
inning to play. Both teams' pitching had
been superb, and a tie might have been a
fitting conclusion since neither team
deserved to lose.
But one team — one pitcher, in partic
ular — most certainly deserved to win.
Through the first five innings, that
pitcher, Scotty, had not yielded a single
hit. Nor had he walked anyone. In fact,
the only base runner reached base on a
throwing error Scotty made with one out.
The batter wound up at third, the right
fielder's subsequent throw also going
awry. A fleeting hapless play almost
ruined the day's magic.
Fortunately, Scotty wasn't phased.
When play resumed, the umpire's call was
familiar. "Strike one. Strike two. Strike
three." Now there were two outs, and
then a repeat performance notched the
third.
Scotty is very large for his age. He also
happens to be black, which may or may not
augment the fear he instills in his primari

ly white opponents. And when he throws
the ball hard, which is most of the time,
few players at this minor-league level are
able to make contact with his pitches.
And on this day, even fewer than usual
did. Aside from the one ground ball that
led to the error, there were perhaps a
handful of foul balls, but nothing else.
The two strikeouts after the error were
not lonely on the scorecard.
Through five innings, Scotty had faced
16 batters. Fifteen of them had struck
out. And only at the end of his fifth
inning did he even begin to get tired.
Before the bottom of the fifth, his
coaches considered pulling Scotty from
the game. With two more games in the
next four days, he would likely be needed
again. And though winning is, after all,
the object® of these games, a win could
never be worth the cost of an injury.
He said he was OK; the coaches warmed
up another pitcher anyway. Would they
really have taken him out? (With a no hit
ter going, with all strikeouts?)
In the home half of the fifth, the
opposing pitcher allowed two hits and a
double steal that put runners on second
and third with only one out. But with a
little magic of his own, he reached back
and struck out the next two batters, pre
serving the scoreless tie.
Scotty took to the hill for the sixth,
visibly tired, but eager to finish out.
Twelve pitches later, he had struck out
the side — again. On the day, he retired

18 batters, all by strikeout. It's a record
that's probably been achieved before, but
110 one has ever done better.
Yet Scotty wasn't even assured of a
win. And with the bottom of the lineup
due to bat, the safer money might have
been on the tie.
Until Ahmad, the smallest boy on the
team, hit a grounder to second. He was
out on a close play, but his contact with
the ball indicated their pitcher was losing
his stuff. Sure enough, the next batter,
Dan, walked. The feisty, blue-eyed run
ner went to second on a wild pitch, and
then third was his on another errant
throw from the unraveling pitcher.
Only 1-3 on the season, having been
blown out 18-7 in a game just two days
earlier, this team needed something spe
cial to happen. It did.
The count 2-0, Josh focused himself at
the plate. Dan revved his engines, anx
ious to race home. Magnificently, Josh
rapped the ball up the middle.
Dan took off; the ball leapt over second
base into center; Josh was safe at first;
Dan scored. Scotty and his team won. It
was a treasure to watch.
