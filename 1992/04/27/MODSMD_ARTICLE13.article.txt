Scrutinize Casper's suggestions for financial aid, tuition

I'M WRITING TO EXPRESS my
alarm and dismay over incoming
University President Gerhard
Casper's exploration of "ideas as radical
as cutting all financial aid and making
non-professional graduate students pay
tuition themselves" before a group of
Stanford economists, as reported in The
Daily Tuesday.
Certainly, lower costs would be won
derful. However, even state schools,
subsidized by tax dollars, are unable to
offer tuition costs low enough that all
students can get through without finan
cial aid.
Those who would suffer most from
Casper's system in which tuition would
be cut in the belief that it would allevi
ate completely the need for financial
aid, would be those students from
lower middle class, working class and
underclass families, including a dispro

portionate number of minority stu
dents.
Graduate students in the humanities
and social sciences are continually under
fire for not paying tuition themselves.
There are several reasons for that.
Unlike graduate students in the sci
ences, the federal government and pri
vate industry do not see fit to finance us
or our mentors each year with thou
sands of dollars of research money.
Students in the professional schools
take out hundreds of thousands of dol
lars in loans to finance their educations.
They are able to do this because they
will often be making that money back in
their future careers.
Graduate students in the humanities
and social sciences, in contrast, will be
lucky if they are pulling in $50,000 a
year upon retirement.
The financing of graduate students is

a an investment for the school. Here at
Stanford, we teach undergraduates as
part of our service to the University. We
are your future faculty members, text
book writers and educators. Without us,
there is no future for universities.
Finally, I was even more disturbed by
Casper's visit to a student dormitory the
day following his talk on economics,
where he paid lip-service to his commit
ment to "need-blind admissions."
Need-blind admissions are meaning
less in a system in which students and
their families are responsible for coming
up with the money for school.
I ask the Stanford community to take
a hard look at Casper. Look at the Uni
versity of Chicago, a school with a
minority undergraduate enrollment sig
nificantly lower than Stanford's (ours is
39.4 percent; theirs 24.09 percent); a
school that is an ivory tower in the

midst of a dying black community â€” a
community it helped to kill with its
reactionary real estate and racial poli
cies.
To what and to whom did Casper pay
lip-service while provost there? Exactly
what is his understanding of multicul
turalism, of increasing minority enroll
ment, of financial aid for undergradu
ates and graduate students?
We as a community must remain
committed to meaningful need-blind
admissions. We must remain committed
to the goal of building a community
which reflects the diversity of this
nation, rather than replicating its racist
and classist aspects.
We have fought hard to establish
these goals here. We do not want a Uni
versity of Chicago in Palo Alto.
