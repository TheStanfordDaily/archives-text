# Donating reserve fund does nothing effective
## 
### 
I would like to take this opportunity to
thank ASSU graduate senator Peter Thiel
and the other senators who authored the
Omnibus Reserve Fund Reform Bill,
which would donate to all current stu
dents more than 80 percent of our reserve
money in the form of $65 checks.
Let me publicly tell Thiel in advance
what I will do with my check, for I am
elated over this recent financial windfall.
A bunch of friends and I will pick up a few
movies and a case of beer, and order two
large pizzas. I'll pick up the tab and treat
them to a quality social evening â€” all
courtesy of the ASSU.
I am amazed at ASSU politicians'
erratic behavior when it comes to spend
ing our money. All year many of them
grumble over spending nickels and dimes
on endangered student groups, yet now

they want to dig into the reserves to give
us pennies?
We are the associated students of Stan
ford, not 12,000 competing individuals. Our
money is so much more effective in enhanc
ing the quality of life when it is pooled
together and distributed in larger sums. I
am amazed at their shortsightedness, which
will lead us inevitably to disaster.
At a time when administration-sup
ported arts and sports budgets are dwin
dling, and when the new president
appears adamant on cutting back to elim
inate the deficit, unloading the ASSU
reserve fund is the last thing we should
consider.
Thiel wants the ASSU to do "some
thing for the students," and his goal is to
throw a $10,000 bash at Lake Lagunita.
Forget it, Thiel. the fraternities take
care of the party scene.
If you want to do something, look
ahead and make sure those of us who will
be here for three more years can enjoy
the same or even more services than

there were when you first arrived
