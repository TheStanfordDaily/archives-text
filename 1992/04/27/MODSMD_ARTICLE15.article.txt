# Magazine propagated sexism in poor article
## 
### 
As a member of the women's basketball
team, I was relieved to read Thursday's
Daily column reprimanding Sports Illus
trated for its publication of Norman
Chad's article belittling women's athletics.
I was beginning to wonder if I was the
only one outraged by Chad's outdated,
close-minded and sexist attitudes. This
season marked only the second year that
the women's semifinal games were
nationally televised.
Although I recognize and appreciate
the recent progress of women's athletics,
they still do not receive the respect they
deserve. Popular magazines such as

Sports Illustrated should lead the way in
promoting women's athletics so that oth
ers will follow.
Instead, they chose to publish Chad's
article, which only served to tarnish the
new, positive image of women's basket
ball that has gradually developed in the
last five years.
Judging from letters I received follow
ing the Final Four, men and women
across the country are enthusiastic and
supportive of women's athletics. They
want to see more of it on television and in
the print media.
The legitimacy of women's athletics
must be acknowledged. I urge Stanford
supporters to write letters to Sports Illus
trated in response to Chad's article, as
well as to the magazine's coverage of
women's sports in general.
It's time we let everyone know that
this year, the road to the Final Four also
led to the Los Angeles Sports Arena.
