# Parolee arrested for sexual assault
## UC-Davis woman attacked at Physics lab 
### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
A UC-Davis student was
attacked on Saturday outside the
Varian physics laboratory by a
man who threatened to kill her if
she didn't perform oral sex on him.
The woman escaped without
complying.
Donald Lockett, a 38-year-old
Palo Alto resident, was arrested
shortly after noon yesterday and
charged with a felony count of sex
ual assault for the alleged attack.
According to Stanford Police
Sgt. Del Bandy, Lockett has a
criminal record and was on parole
when the alleged incident
occurred. Bandy said he could not
disclose information about Lock
ett's record.
The 24-year-old victim said she
was sitting on the steps of the
physics building just before 6
p.m., changing out of the cleats
she had worn for the Ultimate
Frisbee tournament that brought
her to campus.
She was smoking a cigarette,
she said, when a man wearing a
blue sweatshirt and cut-off shorts
asked her for a light.

"I trusted him," she said.
"Davis is a pretty kick-back place.
I didn't realize what kind of peo
ple hang out here."
The victim said Lockett had
been smoking marijuana when he
approached her at about 5:45
p.m. He offered her a joint, she
said, something which would not
have been unusual at Davis.
"I felt comfortable with him,"
she said. "He seemed really mel
low."
She said she and Lockett
walked from the steps to an
enclosed patio between the
physics tank and the Varian lab.
They talked for about 20 minutes,
she said, and then Lockett
reached behind her, grabbed her
hair and demanded she have oral
sex with him.
She refused and he threatened
to kill her, she said.
Lockett grabbed her fanny
pack that "had all my things,
money and credit cards," she said.
He asked her, " 'Do you want
this?'" she said. He made her
kneel down.
Lockett told her he had a knife
in his back pocket, and that he
would kill her if she did not have
oral sex with him, she said. "I
thought I was going to die."
She said she did not see the
knife, but "he had his hand in his
pocket." He seemed "pretty load
ed from the marijuana," she said.
She was surrounded on all
sides by concrete walls, she said,
and a three-foot high gate was
closed behind her.
The woman said she kept hop
ing someone would come out of
the building so she could scream
for help. But fewer people were
around than when she first met
the stranger, she said.
She said she tried to talk him
out of raping her. "I asked him,
'Why are you doing this?... I was
just talking with you. Why are you
making me do this?' " she said.
She said he told her, "Don't
ask me why, just do it."
When she heard someone come
out the door, she leapt over the
fence and scraped her knee and
elbow badly. "I was frantic to get
out of there," she said.
She ran toward junior Dan
Harsell, who had just handed in

his physics lab book. "She got
behind me and said someone had
tried to rape her," Harsell said.
Then, Harsell said, a man ran
around the corner screaming
obscenities at the victim. Harsell
said the man yelled, "'Fuck you!
Fuck you, you bitch!' " before he
noticed Harsell.
"The fact that he saw me there
made him slow down fast and run
off sideways," Harsell said.
Harsell said the incident "was
really a shock... . It's the first
time I've seen an assault in broad
daylight."
Harsell said he walked the
woman through the Quad and to
the Coffee House, where she had
planned to meet friends. She
cleaned the blood from her knee
and elbow before calling the
police, Harsell said.
The woman said she reported
the incident because she "felt it
was [her] duty. I really wanted
this guy off the campus," she said.
Her description of Lockett —
which included his first name, his
account of an emergency room
visit and a bandaged thigh — and
her identification of him in a
photo lineup helped police find a
suspect.
Emergency room records led
police to Lockett. According to a
Stanford Hospital spokesperson,

Lockett came to the emergency
room with a stab wound in his left
thigh at 4:50 p.m. Saturday. He
left 10 minutes later, the
spokesperson said, because he
didn't want to wait for treatment.
Lockett spent last night in jail
in San Jose. Bail was not set, a
prison spokesperson said, because
the judge wanted more informa
tion about Lockett's criminal
record. Bandy said he was trying
to ensure Lockett would not be
eligible for bail.
Lockett was arrested when he
went to pick up his smashed car
from the Menlo Park police, who
had towed it to the station Satur
day afternoon.
According to a Menlo Park
police officer, Lockett had been
chased by some unidentified men
who had stabbed him. "He was
the victim in this case," the officer
said.
"He crashed a couple of times
during the chase," the police offi
cer said, so that his car couldn't
be driven.
After Lockett was arrested, he
was taken by ambulance to Stan
ford Hospital emergency room for
a check-up before he was jailed, a
hospital spokesperson said.
He was put on antibiotics for
"possible pneumonia" and given a
tetanus shot, she added.

his physics lab book. "She got
behind me and said someone had
tried to rape her," Harsell said.
Then, Harsell said, a man ran
around the corner screaming
obscenities at the victim. Harsell
said the man yelled, "'Fuck you!
Fuck you, you bitch!' " before he
noticed Harsell.
"The fact that he saw me there
made him slow down fast and run
off sideways," Harsell said.
Harsell said the incident "was
really a shock... . It's the first
time I've seen an assault in broad
daylight."
Harsell said he walked the
woman through the Quad and to
the Coffee House, where she had
planned to meet friends. She
cleaned the blood from her knee
and elbow before calling the
police, Harsell said.
The woman said she reported
the incident because she "felt it
was [her] duty. I really wanted
this guy off the campus," she said.
Her description of Lockett —
which included his first name, his
account of an emergency room
visit and a bandaged thigh — and
her identification of him in a
photo lineup helped police find a
suspect.
Emergency room records led
police to Lockett. According to a
Stanford Hospital spokesperson,

Lockett came to the emergency
room with a stab wound in his left
thigh at 4:50 p.m. Saturday. He
left 10 minutes later, the
spokesperson said, because he
didn't want to wait for treatment.
Lockett spent last night in jail
in San Jose. Bail was not set, a
prison spokesperson said, because
the judge wanted more informa
tion about Lockett's criminal
record. Bandy said he was trying
to ensure Lockett would not be
eligible for bail.
Lockett was arrested when he
went to pick up his smashed car
from the Menlo Park police, who
had towed it to the station Satur
day afternoon.
According to a Menlo Park
police officer, Lockett had been
chased by some unidentified men
who had stabbed him. "He was
the victim in this case," the officer
said.
"He crashed a couple of times
during the chase," the police offi
cer said, so that his car couldn't
be driven.
After Lockett was arrested, he
was taken by ambulance to Stan
ford Hospital emergency room for
a check-up before he was jailed, a
hospital spokesperson said.
He was put on antibiotics for
"possible pneumonia" and given a
tetanus shot, she added.
A UC-Davis student was
attacked on Saturday outside the
Varian physics laboratory by a
man who threatened to kill her if
she didn't perform oral sex on him.
The woman escaped without
complying.
Donald Lockett, a 38-year-old
Palo Alto resident, was arrested
shortly after noon yesterday and
charged with a felony count of sex
ual assault for the alleged attack.
According to Stanford Police
Sgt. Del Bandy, Lockett has a
criminal record and was on parole
when the alleged incident
occurred. Bandy said he could not
disclose information about Lock
ett's record.
The 24-year-old victim said she
was sitting on the steps of the
physics building just before 6
p.m., changing out of the cleats
she had worn for the Ultimate
Frisbee tournament that brought
her to campus.
She was smoking a cigarette,
she said, when a man wearing a
blue sweatshirt and cut-off shorts
asked her for a light.

"I trusted him," she said.
"Davis is a pretty kick-back place.
I didn't realize what kind of peo
ple hang out here."
The victim said Lockett had
been smoking marijuana when he
approached her at about 5:45
p.m. He offered her a joint, she
said, something which would not
have been unusual at Davis.
"I felt comfortable with him,"
she said. "He seemed really mel
low."
She said she and Lockett
walked from the steps to an
enclosed patio between the
physics tank and the Varian lab.
They talked for about 20 minutes,
she said, and then Lockett
reached behind her, grabbed her
hair and demanded she have oral
sex with him.
She refused and he threatened
to kill her, she said.
Lockett grabbed her fanny
pack that "had all my things,
money and credit cards," she said.
He asked her, " 'Do you want
this?'" she said. He made her
kneel down.
Lockett told her he had a knife
in his back pocket, and that he
would kill her if she did not have
oral sex with him, she said. "I
thought I was going to die."
She said she did not see the
knife, but "he had his hand in his
pocket." He seemed "pretty load
ed from the marijuana," she said.
She was surrounded on all
sides by concrete walls, she said,
and a three-foot high gate was
closed behind her.
The woman said she kept hop
ing someone would come out of
the building so she could scream
for help. But fewer people were
around than when she first met
the stranger, she said.
She said she tried to talk him
out of raping her. "I asked him,
'Why are you doing this?... I was
just talking with you. Why are you
making me do this?' " she said.
She said he told her, "Don't
ask me why, just do it."
When she heard someone come
out the door, she leapt over the
fence and scraped her knee and
elbow badly. "I was frantic to get
out of there," she said.
She ran toward junior Dan
Harsell, who had just handed in

his physics lab book. "She got
behind me and said someone had
tried to rape her," Harsell said.
Then, Harsell said, a man ran
