## UC-Davis woman attacked at Physics lab 
### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
A UC-Davis student was
attacked on Saturday outside the
Varian physics laboratory by a
man who threatened to kill her if
she didn't perform oral sex on him.
The woman escaped without
complying.
Donald Lockett, a 38-year-old
Palo Alto resident, was arrested
shortly after noon yesterday and
charged with a felony count of sex
ual assault for the alleged attack.
According to Stanford Police
Sgt. Del Bandy, Lockett has a
criminal record and was on parole
when the alleged incident
occurred. Bandy said he could not
disclose information about Lock
ett's record.
The 24-year-old victim said she
was sitting on the steps of the
physics building just before 6
p.m., changing out of the cleats
she had worn for the Ultimate
Frisbee tournament that brought
her to campus.
She was smoking a cigarette,
she said, when a man wearing a
blue sweatshirt and cut-off shorts
asked her for a light.

"I trusted him," she said.
"Davis is a pretty kick-back place.
I didn't realize what kind of peo
ple hang out here."
The victim said Lockett had
been smoking marijuana when he
approached her at about 5:45
p.m. He offered her a joint, she
said, something which would not
have been unusual at Davis.
"I felt comfortable with him,"
she said. "He seemed really mel
low."
She said she and Lockett
walked from the steps to an
enclosed patio between the
physics tank and the Varian lab.
They talked for about 20 minutes,
she said, and then Lockett
reached behind her, grabbed her
hair and demanded she have oral
sex with him.
She refused and he threatened
to kill her, she said.
Lockett grabbed her fanny
pack that "had all my things,
money and credit cards," she said.
He asked her, " 'Do you want
this?'" she said. He made her
kneel down.
Lockett told her he had a knife
