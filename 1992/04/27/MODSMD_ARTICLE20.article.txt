## Stanford has two top-10 draft picks 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
In a proud day for Stanford
football, two Cardinal players
were among the top ten selections
in yesterday's National Football
League draft.
In back-to-back selections,
offensive tackle Bob Whitfield was
drafted with the eighth pick by
the Atlanta Falcons and the
Cleveland Browns tabbed fullback
"Touchdown" Tommy Vardell as
the number nine pick in the first
round. The draft finishes today,
with several Stanford seniors
hoping to be selected.
At the Holiday Inn in Palo
Alto, where he hosted a draft-day
celebration, Whitfield was all
smiles when NFL commissioner
Paul Tagliabue read the
announcement in New York City.
Ever the prankster, just before
receiving a congratulatory call
from Atlanta head coach Jerry
Glanville, the phone rang and
Whitfield said, "Hello? Domino's
Pizza?" and proceeded to tell
reporters that he was confirming
a pizza delivery. But endorse
ments aside, the phone call was
actually from a well-wisher and
the official notification came from
Atlanta moments later.
Upon speaking with his new
coach for the first time, Whit
field's first words in response
were simply, "Thank you. You've
made me a very happy man."
Whitfield told the gathering
moments later, "This is one of the
greatest things to happen to me in
my life. There's nothing else to
say — I'm just too happy."
When asked about the earth
quake earlier that morning, the
300-pound lineman replied,
"Earthquake? That wasn't an
earthquake. That was just me
running down the hallway."
"Atlanta Ls a great place for Bob
Whitfield," said Whitfield's agent,
Ray Anderson of A.R. Sports. "Its

a good system, a good coach.. .We
couldn't be more pleased."
Anderson would not give any
details on the upcoming contract
negotiations with the Falcons.
However, "the looming issue of
free agency is a real valuable poten
tial value (whose) economic impact
is important (and could be used as
a bargaining chip)," he said.

'He has no choice. I
don't care if he's 20
years old and a mil
lionaire. I'm still his
mother and he will
get his degree.'
— Eartha Whitfield

One of the finest offensive tack
les in Stanford football history, the
junior from Carson, Calif., forgave
his 112 nal year of college eligibility to
enter the draft early. Whitfield
started all 34 games of his Stan
ford career and was a consensus
First Team All-America in 1991.
But just because he's leaving
Stanford before graduation does
not mean that school is out for
Whitfield. His mother, Eartha
Whitfield, expects nothing less
than a diploma from her son.
"When I gave him to Denny
(Green), I said that he was going
to get a degree," she said. "Yes the
NFL is money, but what's in your
head, your education, is more
important.
"He has no choice," she contin
ued. "I don't care if he's 20 years
old and a millionaire. I'm still his
mother and he will get his degree."
Meanwhile, Vardell enjoyed
the news live at NFL draft head
quarters at the Marriott Marquis
in New York. Projected as a mid
dle-to-late first round choice,
Vardell was pleasantly surprised

to be taken right after his college
teammate by the Browns.
"It's great to be the first back
taken," he said. "Cleveland has
great fans and the facilities are
unbelievable .... I think I'll fit in
well. We played under a pro-set
system (at Stanford), so that will
be an advantage in helping me
adjust."
The senior back leaves The
Farm having set five school
records: most single-season yards
rushing (1,084), most touchdowns
scored in a season (20), most
points in a season (120), most

career rushing touchdowns (39),
and most carries in a game (39, vs.
Cal on November 23, 1991).
"They (Cleveland] didn't even
call me right away," he said. "The
cameras and lights suddenly went
on me and I knew something was
going on."
And what does having two top
ten picks say about Stanford foot
ball?
"It shows that our recruiting
department has done a great job,
and hopefully that (having high
draft choices) will continue in the
future," Glyn Milburn said.

"He has no choice," she contin
ued. "I don't care if he's 20 years
old and a millionaire. I'm still his
mother and he will get his degree."
Meanwhile, Vardell enjoyed
the news live at NFL draft head
quarters at the Marriott Marquis
in New York. Projected as a mid
dle-to-late first round choice,
Vardell was pleasantly surprised

to be taken right after his college
teammate by the Browns.
"It's great to be the first back
taken," he said. "Cleveland has
great fans and the facilities are
unbelievable .... I think I'll fit in
well. We played under a pro-set
system (at Stanford), so that will
be an advantage in helping me
adjust."
The senior back leaves The
Farm having set five school
records: most single-season yards
rushing (1,084), most touchdowns
scored in a season (20), most
points in a season (120), most

career rushing touchdowns (39),
and most carries in a game (39, vs.
Cal on November 23, 1991).
"They (Cleveland] didn't even
call me right away," he said. "The
cameras and lights suddenly went
on me and I knew something was
going on."
And what does having two top
ten picks say about Stanford foot
ball?
"It shows that our recruiting
department has done a great job,
and hopefully that (having high
draft choices) will continue in the
future," Glyn Milburn said.

Junior wide receiver David Shaw makes the extra effort to reel in a
pass during Saturday's Cardinal and White Game. Shaw missed the
catch, but the team still looked sharp during the end-of-season
scrimmage.
In a proud day for Stanford
football, two Cardinal players
were among the top ten selections
in yesterday's National Football
League draft.
In back-to-back selections,
offensive tackle Bob Whitfield was
drafted with the eighth pick by
the Atlanta Falcons and the
Cleveland Browns tabbed fullback
"Touchdown" Tommy Vardell as
the number nine pick in the first
round. The draft finishes today,
with several Stanford seniors
hoping to be selected.
At the Holiday Inn in Palo
Alto, where he hosted a draft-day
celebration, Whitfield was all
smiles when NFL commissioner
Paul Tagliabue read the
announcement in New York City.
Ever the prankster, just before
receiving a congratulatory call
from Atlanta head coach Jerry
Glanville, the phone rang and
Whitfield said, "Hello? Domino's
Pizza?" and proceeded to tell
reporters that he was confirming
a pizza delivery. But endorse
ments aside, the phone call was
actually from a well-wisher and
the official notification came from
Atlanta moments later.
Upon speaking with his new
coach for the first time, Whit
field's first words in response
were simply, "Thank you. You've
made me a very happy man."
Whitfield told the gathering
moments later, "This is one of the
greatest things to happen to me in
my life. There's nothing else to
say — I'm just too happy."
When asked about the earth
quake earlier that morning, the
300-pound lineman replied,
"Earthquake? That wasn't an
earthquake. That was just me
running down the hallway."
"Atlanta Ls a great place for Bob
Whitfield," said Whitfield's agent,
Ray Anderson of A.R. Sports. "Its

a good system, a good coach.. .We
couldn't be more pleased."
Anderson would not give any
details on the upcoming contract
negotiations with the Falcons.
However, "the looming issue of
free agency is a real valuable poten
tial value (whose) economic impact
is important (and could be used as
a bargaining chip)," he said.

'He has no choice. I
don't care if he's 20
years old and a mil
lionaire. I'm still his
mother and he will
get his degree.'

One of the finest offensive tack
les in Stanford football history, the
junior from Carson, Calif., forgave
his 112 nal year of college eligibility to
enter the draft early. Whitfield
started all 34 games of his Stan
ford career and was a consensus
First Team All-America in 1991.
But just because he's leaving
Stanford before graduation does
not mean that school is out for
Whitfield. His mother, Eartha
Whitfield, expects nothing less
than a diploma from her son.
"When I gave him to Denny
(Green), I said that he was going
to get a degree," she said. "Yes the
NFL is money, but what's in your
head, your education, is more
important.
"He has no choice," she contin
ued. "I don't care if he's 20 years
old and a millionaire. I'm still his
mother and he will get his degree."
