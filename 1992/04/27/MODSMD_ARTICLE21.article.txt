# Spring scrimmage adds to injured list
## 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
Coach Bill Walsh and his grid
iron troupe pulled up the curtain
on the 1992 show Saturday, but
their spring-long plague of
injuries followed them into the
spotlight.
Sophomore starting lineback
er Coy Gibbs went down with a
wounded knee in the Cardinal
and White Scrimmage at Stan
ford Stadium, continuing a mali
cious trend that he has dampened
the April practice session.
"Of course, that's always the
downside to spring practice,"
Walsh said about the risk of
injury. "But we're concerned
about the number of injuries
we've suffered."
Fortunately, X-rays showed
that Gibbs' injury will not
require surgery and he should be
ready for the season opener â€”
the August 26 Pigskin Classic
against Texas A&M in Anaheim.
The Cardinal has already lost
young linebacker Kurt Criter to
a season-ending knee injury.
Four other players, two of them
established starters, sat out the
scrimmage with mild injuries.
Quarterback Steve Stenstrom is
still nursing a broken hand and
outside linebacker Dave Gar
nett rested an injured foot.
David Calomese, one of the
team's top four receivers, and
safety Jimmy Klein, who missed
all of last season with a knee
injury, also watched from the
sidelines.
If there was one bright spot in
the barrage of injuries, Walsh
found it. "With Steve (Sten
strom) out, (backup quarter
backs) Mark Butterfield and
Chris Berg have had the opportu
nity to get a lot more work."
For Butterfield the work
seems to have paid off. Directing
the first-team offense, the 6-foot
-4 sophomore looked impressive

as he completed Bof 11 passes for
103 yards and one touchdown.
That scoring strike was a 40-
yard dazzling catch-and-run by
senior Glyn Milburn. He
opened the scrimmage a bit slug
gish, but his high-stepping jaunt
to the end zone brought back
memories of vintage Milburn
from the 1990 season.
While the offense had its scat
tered highlights, the Cardinal
defense dominated Saturday's
show. If the scrimmage was any
indication, Stanford foes can
expect to see a more aggressive,
blitzing style than they have in
previous years. The first-team
defense feasted on the second
team offensive line and spent
most of the morning harassing
Berg.
And well they should have; 10
of 11 starters return from a
squad that finished second in the
Pacific 10 Conference last season.
The remaining spot, free safety,
spawned one of the spring's most
intriguing battles. John Lynch
and Tommy Knecht, a pair of for
mer quarterbacks, both leave
April camp without knowing who
landed the starting role.
Lynch, who fit practice around
his commitment to the baseball
team, seems to have the inside
track. He played with the first
team for the first half of the
scrimmage before leaving to help
down Arizona at Sunken Dia
mond.
Card Notes
At game's end, Walsh pulled But
terfield and had Mickey Mouse take a
few snaps under center. The helmet
clad rodent was on hand to promote
the upcoming Pigskin Classic, which
is sponsored by Disneyland .. . The
Cardinal will conclude spring football
on Wednesday ... Roger Craig was
on hand, signing autographs and
chatting with his former teammates
and coaches, who now comprise vir
tually all of the Cardinal staff.
