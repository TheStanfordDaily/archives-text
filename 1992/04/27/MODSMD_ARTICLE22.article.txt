# Women's gym places tenth at NCAAs

Breck Greenwood looked into the
mirror sometiihe before the 1992 sea
son began, and decided that he could
use a good haircut in late April.
Greenwood, the Stanford women's
gymnastics coach, then made a promise
to his athletes that if they defeated a
top-12 team, he would get a crew cut
the following week. Now, after his
charges avoided a last-place finish
among the 12 teams invited to the
NCAA Championship Meet in St. Paul,
Minn., on Friday, Greenwood's barber
will be all the more wealthy for the
coach's daring.
While their male counterparts were
wrapping up a championship of their
own, the women also won a title of
sorts. After finishing the 1991 cam
paign 26th in the national polls, the
Cardinal had a dual mission for 1992:
to break into the top 12 and to lend
some long-overdue credibility to Green
wood's program.
year, I went to the NCAA meet
and thought, 'We belong here. We could
compete with these teams,'" Green
wood said. "This year, we went and we
showed that we belonged."
Indeed, the team accomplished its
mission in grand fashion. Not only did
Stanford wind up a remarkable season
by crashing the championship party
for the first time in school history, but
it also managed to slip up from its 12th
seed with a four-event total of 189.10
and surprise lOth-and llth-ranked
Florida and BYU, respectively. For its
efforts, the Cardinal squad will head
into 1993 with a "No. 10" in front of its
name. Utah won the championship
with a score of 195.65.
As she has for most of the season,
freshman phenom Jene Elzie led the
way for the Cardinal and proved that
she is a championship-caliber colle
gian. Her all-around score of 38.50 —

which included team-high marks of
9.725, 9.65 and 9.575 on the vault,
uneven bars and balance beam, respec
tively — was good for 13th place
among individuals participating and
earned her second-team All-American
honors. Elzie is only the second Stan
ford woman gymnast ever to attain All-
American status.

'We want to be a top six
team at least next year.'
— coach Greenwood

"When I found out I was an All-
American, I was shocked at first, and
then I felt a lot of excitement," Elzie
said.
Elzie was most proud of her vault,
where she felt that her 9.725 perfor
mance was indicative of one her finest
routines of the year.
"Everything just came together at
the right time for me in that event,"
Elzie said.
Elzie and her Cardinal teammates
kicked off the lower rotation Friday
afternoon on the beam, an event in
which they have excelled for much of
the year.
However, the judges were unforgiv
ing in exercising their right to "leave
room" for later scores, giving Stanford
a five-person total of 46.725. Elzie's
9.575 was followed by a 9.45 from fel
low frosh Katie Clancy and a 9.40 from
sophomore Kerrie KeUey
The fourth-highest total in the event
for the Cardinal was amassed by sopho
more West, whom Greenwood
lauded for receiving a 9.20 in a disci
pline in which she has had "very little
training."
Next up for Stanford was the floor
exercise, where standout sophomore
Kerri Kanuka led the way to a 47.275

total by putting up a team-high 9.60,
despite performing on a sore foot. Elzie
followed with a 9.55 and then came
Clancy, who according to Greenwood
"picked a great time" to give one of her
best performances of the year and earn
a 9.425.
Freshman Tina Snowden was close
behind with a 9.40, while Meegan Lan
nin, also a freshman, rounded out Car
dinal scoring with a 9.30.
The second half of the Cardinal rota
tion began with the vault, where the
squad solidified its lOth-place standing
with a 47.425 sum. Elzie's 9.725 was
trailed by Clancy's 9.60, Kanuka's
9.525, a 9.325 performance from Lan
nin and West's 9.25.
Finally, the gymnasts suffered their
only "break" of the competition when
injured sophomore Mollie Brown fell
off of the uneven bars, but came back to
receive their highest team score of the
day at 47.675.
Elzie's solid 9.65 led the way once
again, while Kanuka and Lannin each
received 9.575' sand Clancy gave the
Cardinal a fourth athlete over 9.5 when
she garnered a 9.525. Kelley's 9.35 on
the apparatus rounded out Stanford's
scoring.
While the women gymnasts have
every reason to be pleased with their
performance this season, Greenwood
knows that there are even higher levels
to be reached, and as the coach starts
practice for next season in just two
weeks, he will keep higher goals on his
team's mind.
"We want to be a top six team at
least next year, and we want to be more
appealing to our home crowds than we
were this year," Greenwood said.
"Most of the other teams are most
ly made up of juniors and seniors. We
had four freshmen and four sopho
mores and have a great recruiting
class coming in. We are looking for
ward to next year's NCAA Champi
onships," he said.
