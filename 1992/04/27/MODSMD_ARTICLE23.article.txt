The Cardinal women's golf team man
aged to have some fun under the scorch
ing Arizona sun this weekend, placing
third in the Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships held on the Karsten Golf
Course at Arizona State.
The nationally top-ranked Arizona
squad led the conference, beating second
place ASU by 33 strokes in a perfor
mance typical for a squad that has been
burning up tournaments all year.
Sixth ranked Stanford finished third
with 909 strokes, one shot behind ASU.
The Cardinal had matching 305 scores
for the first and last rounds, surging on

the second day of play with 299 strokes.
"If it were the Pac-9. . . laughed
Stanford coach Tim Baldwin. "If you'd
taken Arizona out of there, it would have
been really competitive."
Martha Richards led the Cardinal
with a seventh place individual finish.
Richards has been a perfect example of
consistency during the spring season,
finishing in the top ten in each tourna
ment. Against the formidable Pac-10
golfers, Richards once again secured a
top-ten finish with a 76-75-74 perfor
mance.
"Martha has really arrived as a top
national player," said Baldwin. "If the
season were just starting, she'd
definifitely be on the Pac-10 First-Team.

'Our scores were very
respectable. We played
consistent golf. We didn't
fall apart like USC or
UCLA. This is a very solid
Stanford team.'
â€” coach Baldwin

I predict that Martha will be in the top
ten at NCAA's too "
Coming in one stroke behind Richards
was Audrey Wooding, placing eighth

after shooting a 72 and a 74 on the first
two days. Wooding faltered on the last
nine holes of the third round, ending the
day shooting 80.
Wooding, who led the tournament
after the first day of play, qualified as
the sole member of the Pac-10 First-
Team not on the Arizona team.
Adele Moore, who qualified for the
Pac-10 Second-Team, finished 13th,
shooting 78, 77 and 76 on the three
respective days. Moore has been faltering
in spring competition, but hopes to turn
on the heat for the NCAA Champi
onships in late May.
Melinda Daniels finished in 18th
place, shooting an impressive 73 on the
second day. Freshman Amy Ijiwrence

came in 24th, three strokes behind
Daniels overall.
Stanford was in second place after
Saturday, but was surpassed by host Ari
zona State in the final round. If the Car
dinal expects to beat ASU in the NCAA
Championship, they will have to beat the
Sun Devils on their home course.
"Our scores were very respectable,"
Baldwin said. "We played consistent golf.
We didn't fall apart, like USC or UCLA.
This is a very solid Stanford team."
"We've got four good girls going for
the 4 and 5 spots," he said. "We need to
get two of them to arise before NCAA's,
and if we get good productivity from
those players and if Adele Moore hits a
streak, we'll be in good shape."
