# Spikers come close but fall to Waves in finals
## 
### Laurie Wackier Staff writer 
Unfortunately for Cardinal
volleyball, there were clouds in
Indiana this weekend and Stan
ford brought home silver linings.
The spikers did garner some
prime honors in the Hoosier
state, including first team All-
America honors for Duncan
Blackman, Dave Goss and
Canyon Ceman, but the top prize,
1992 NCAA Championship rings,
slipped through their hands and
onto the fingers of a peaking Pep
perdine squad Saturday.
With unrelenting offensive
pressure, the second-ranked
Waves toppled top-ranked Stan
ford in three games, 7-15, 13-15,
14-16 in front of a record Final
Four crowd of 13,102 at Ball
State's University Arena. Stan
ford took runner-up honors for
the second time in as many Final
Four appearances and finished
with a record of 24-4. In 1989 the
Cardinal lost to UCLA in the
final.
Before the match, head coach
Ruben Nieves, who was named
NCAA coach of the year, warned
of Pepperdine's prolific hitters.
"They've got a lot of weapons,"
Nieves said. "We don't plan on
stopping them. Nobody's done it
all year. We just hope we can con
tain them." But the Waves put a
damper on that hope, sailing to a
.432 team hitting percentage.
Stanford and Pepperdine split
two matches during the regular
season.
Anchoring Pepperdine's
attack, junior Tom Sorenson
unleashed 33 kills on .596 hitting
accuracy. Tournament MVP Alon
Grinberg, a sophomore, stymied

Stanford's blockers with 21 put
aways. Grinberg recorded 25 kills
in Pepperdine's three-game victo
ry over Penn State Friday.
"We always plan to win a
national championship. Some
times we do it and sometimes we
don't," Pepperdine coach Marv
Dunphy said. "Tonight the tim
ing was right."
For the Cardinal, the timing
wasn't so right. Worn down by
consecutive road trips and
fatigued from Friday's marathon
semifinal match against Indiana-
Purdue/Fort Wayne, the dazed
spikers dug a hole in game one.
Down 1-8, Ryan Moos sparked
Stanford, burying a shot down
the left line. Then middle blocker
John Bezmalinovic wiped a shot
off Pepperdine's blockers to earn
a point. Following with two kills,
Blackman put the Cardinal back
in the game at 4-8.
Then Pepperdine constructed
an impenetrable wall at the net,
blocking Stanford's comeback
and escaping with a 15-7 victory
in game one.
"We got off to a slow start in
the first game," Goss noted.
"Then we got more into a groove
and felt more confident after that
game was over."
That confidence helped Stan
ford turn the momentum around
early in game two. Forcing the
frustrated Waves into several
errors, the spikers jumped to a 4-
0 advantage.
Regrouping after a timeout,
Pepperdine slowly evened the
score, then moved ahead 6-4
before Stanford was able to regain
control. With an elusive offensive
strategy, setter Ceman kept the
Waves off balance, chipping away
until the Cardinal led, 13-9.

But Sorenson pierced Stan
ford's blockers and earned side
out for the Waves. Deflated, the
Cardinal missed three serves and
suddenly found themselves trail
ing two games to none.
Meticulous play on both sides
of the net characterized game
three. Skillfu' siderut teams,
Stanford and Pepperdine traded
serves and tediously earned
points.
Down 2-5, Ceman returned
from a Cardinal timeout, stuffing
a Pepperdine hitter. Determined
to hold off the Waves, Goss shred
ded the blockers twice, then
teamed with John Hribar for a
rejection as Stanford evened the
score at five.
Moos, who finished with 13
kills on a .476 hitting percentage,
kept Stanford alive. The south
paw stifled Pepperdine blockers,
alternating crosscourt and line
shotp.
Refusing to be upstaged, Pep
perdine's Sorenson responded,
lifting his team from a 9-12
deficit to post a 12-all deadlock.
Again, Goss lit up the court,
pounding the ball twice as Stan
ford edged ahead 14-13.
A fired up Sorenson recorded
two more kills, and the lead
changed hands for the last time.
With a 15-14 advantage, Soren
son backed up for his lethal jump
serve. Goss shanked the pass into
the crowd as Sorenson recorded
the match-winning ace.
"Pepperdine was unstoppable
tonight," Nieves said. "They did a
great job of blocking and playing
defense and they have a really
good transition game."
An All-Tournament pick, Goss
fueled Stanford's title bid with 38
kills and nine digs.
"Dave may have started slow
tonight, but he finished strong,"
Nieves commended. "Even though
we didn't win the championship,
he played like a champion."
Blackman, a senior and the
sole remaining starter from Stan
ford's 1989 Final Four squad, tal
lied 13 kills and joined Goss on
the All-Tournament team.
Following the loss, Blackman
numbly stepped forward,
acknowledging his selection to
the All-Tournament team and
ending his collegiate career on a
bittersweet note.
"I had commented to the team
that it didn't feel like the Nation
al Championship match," said the
stunned outside hitter. "I couldn't
feel all the tension that's sup
posed to be associated with it."
Friday's match against IPFW
may have had something to do
with that. After dropping the first
two games, the seventh-ranked
Volleydons staged a courageous
comeback and put Stanford
through a grueling five-game
test, 15-11, 15-11, 11-15, 13-15,
15-10.
IPFW rebounded in games
three and four, surprising the
Cardinal and forcing a fifth game.
Undefeated in five-game match
es, Stanford regained composure
and halted the upset bid.
"They turned the match
around on us in games three and
four and we made a lot of hitting
errors. We did a great job of
recovering in game five," Nieves
said.
Blackman, who led Stanford
with 28 kills and three service
aces, finished the Volleydons with
an uncontested put-away
through a seam. Goss added 27
kills and 11 digs in the semifinal
match.
Penn State defeated IPFW in
straight games in Saturday's
third place match.
