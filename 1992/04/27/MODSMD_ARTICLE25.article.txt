# Linksters continue to improve, place second at home
## 
### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
For the Stanford Cardinal
men's golf team, this weekend's
United States Intercollegiate
Invitational was a showcase.
It was a showcase of the
squad's home golf course, which
was said to be in its best condition
in years; a showcase of the young
talent that figures to make the
Cardinal even better in the future
(its top six golfers consisted of two
freshmen, two sophomores, one
junior and just one senior); and,
most importantly for the final
meet of the 1991-92 regular sea
son, a showcase of the instincts
and timing that will make Stan
ford a legitimate contender in the
upcoming postseason.
For those that would have
looked at Stanford's winter-quar
ter woes and written the team off
sometime in March, this weekend
served as the perfect prelude to
next weekend's Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships and the
NCAA competitions beyond. For
the third consecutive tournament,
the Cardinal posted its highest fin
ish of 1992, this time placing sec
ond behind nationally-ranked Ari
zona. Stanford's two-under-par
total of 850 established a school
record and along with the Wild

cats' 843 and third-place Pacific's
859, shattered Arizona's old U.S.
Intercollegiate record of 861.
To put the linksters' perfor
mance in another way, 17 of the
nation's finest squads came to
Stanford Golf Course Saturday
morning, and by Sunday after
noon the streaking Cardinal had
humbled 15 of them, including
seven other Pac-10 rivals.
A major reason for Stanford's
record-setting surge was its ability
to overcome its customary first
round jitters. In fact, the Cardi
nal's flve-under-par 279 on Satur
day morning included a spectacu
lar flve-under 66 by junior Brad
Lanning, and a four-under 67 by
sophomore Notah Begay that
would have equalled Lanning's
feat if not for a bogey on hole 18.
The squad's mediocre 291 on Sat
urday afternoon was negated by a
four-under 280 Sunday to give the
Cardinal a secure first-runner-up
performance.
The team's only 1992 gradu
ate, Christian Cevaer, enjoyed a
steady 74-72-71—217 outing and
was duly amazed by the Cardi
nal's showing.
"This is a team sport and it's
played as a team," Cevaer said. "I
couldn't think of a better way to
end the regular season of my four
years with such a great team

showing. This is the best team
performance I've ever been a part
of in my four years at Stanford."
For all of the team's accom
plishments, however, Lanning's
solo performance may have been
the most spectacular story of the
tournament. After the aforemen
tioned 66, the junior shot a 73 in
the second round and finished
with a 72 on Sunday. His overall
211 tally tied him for third with
three other golfers in the individ
ual standings.
"I had a different attitude this
tournament," Lanning said. "I
just relaxed and hit the ball and if
it happened, it happened and if it
didn't, it didn't."
Whatever "happened" to Lan
ning has been happening to the
entire Cardinal squad of late, and
its occurrence has come none too
soon for the Stanford golf program.
"Each tournament we're get
ting better and better, and this is
the right time of the year to do
that," said Begay.
Head coach Wally Goodwin
agreed, adding, "This is unbeliev
able. We almost hit on all cylinders
this tournament, and we will hit on
all of them by the end of the year."
A sign of things to come, per
haps? After fourth, third, and sec
ond, there is only one more place
to go for the Cardinal.

the Cardinal take second-place in the U.S. Intercollegiate Invitational held at Stanford this weekend. The

freshmen, two sophomores, one
junior and just one senior); and,
most importantly for the final
meet of the 1991-92 regular sea
son, a showcase of the instincts
and timing that will make Stan
ford a legitimate contender in the
upcoming postseason.
For those that would have
looked at Stanford's winter-quar
ter woes and written the team off
sometime in March, this weekend
served as the perfect prelude to
next weekend's Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships and the
NCAA competitions beyond. For
the third consecutive tournament,
the Cardinal posted its highest fin
ish of 1992, this time placing sec
ond behind nationally-ranked Ari
zona. Stanford's two-under-par
total of 850 established a school
record and along with the Wild

cats' 843 and third-place Pacific's
859, shattered Arizona's old U.S.
Intercollegiate record of 861.
To put the linksters' perfor
mance in another way, 17 of the
nation's finest squads came to
Stanford Golf Course Saturday
morning, and by Sunday after
noon the streaking Cardinal had
humbled 15 of them, including
seven other Pac-10 rivals.
A major reason for Stanford's
record-setting surge was its ability
to overcome its customary first
round jitters. In fact, the Cardi
nal's flve-under-par 279 on Satur
day morning included a spectacu
lar flve-under 66 by junior Brad
Lanning, and a four-under 67 by
sophomore Notah Begay that
would have equalled Lanning's
feat if not for a bogey on hole 18.
The squad's mediocre 291 on Sat
urday afternoon was negated by a
four-under 280 Sunday to give the
Cardinal a secure first-runner-up
performance.
The team's only 1992 gradu
ate, Christian Cevaer, enjoyed a
steady 74-72-71—217 outing and
was duly amazed by the Cardi
nal's showing.
"This is a team sport and it's
played as a team," Cevaer said. "I
couldn't think of a better way to
end the regular season of my four
years with such a great team

showing. This is the best team
performance I've ever been a part
of in my four years at Stanford."
For all of the team's accom
plishments, however, Lanning's
solo performance may have been
the most spectacular story of the
tournament. After the aforemen
tioned 66, the junior shot a 73 in
the second round and finished
with a 72 on Sunday. His overall
211 tally tied him for third with
three other golfers in the individ
ual standings.
"I had a different attitude this
tournament," Lanning said. "I
just relaxed and hit the ball and if
it happened, it happened and if it
didn't, it didn't."
Whatever "happened" to Lan
ning has been happening to the
entire Cardinal squad of late, and
its occurrence has come none too
soon for the Stanford golf program.
"Each tournament we're get
ting better and better, and this is
the right time of the year to do
that," said Begay.
Head coach Wally Goodwin
agreed, adding, "This is unbeliev
able. We almost hit on all cylinders
this tournament, and we will hit on
all of them by the end of the year."
A sign of things to come, per
haps? After fourth, third, and sec
ond, there is only one more place
to go for the Cardinal.


Al Green — Daily file
Notah Begay knocks a shot out of the sandtrap. Begay shot a 67 on the first day of competition to help
the Cardinal take second-place in the U.S. Intercollegiate Invitational held at Stanford this weekend. The
men's team put together a concerted team-effort to finish with an 850, nine shots ahead of University of
Pacific and only seven shots behind nationally-ranked Arizona.
