# Wildcats take two of three from Cardinal
## 
### Mike Langford Staff Writer 
For the Stanford baseball team,
the theme for the weekend could
have been "missed opportunities."
Going into a three-game series
at Sunken Diamond with confer
ence-leading Arizona, the Cardi
nal trailed by one game in the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division. Unfortunately, the
opportunity to pull ahead in the
Six-Pac standings slipped
through Stanford's fingers.
The Wildcats (27-17-1, 13-9 in
the Six-Pac) took two of three
games from the briefly threaten
ing Cardinal, pulling into sole pos
session of first place. Meanwhile,
Stanford (28-18, 12-12) dropped
into a four team melee at second.
Arizona prevailed 7-6 Friday and
7-4 yesterday, while Stanford tri
umphed 19-8 Saturday.
Friday provided a match-up of
Kirt Kishita and Cardinal ace
Willie Adams. After four innings
Stanford had a 5-0 lead thanks to
a two-run shot by Dusty Allen.
But with two out in the fifth,
Wildcat shortstop Jason Bates
showed that you cannot make
mistakes with Arizona. Bates
delivered an Adams fastball to
dead center in a home run esti
mated at 475 feet.
But it got worse. In the top of
the sixth, Adams began to falter.
Three consecutive hits without
an out loaded the bases for nor
mally light-hitting Phil Echever
ria, who nailed a 1-2 change-up
for a game-tying grand-slam. In
the seventh, Arizona scored twice
to take a 7-5 lead. Steve Solomon
led off the ninth with a solo

homer to right, but the game
ended in Arizona's favor, 7-6.
"We just couldn't come back
from that (grand slam)," said Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess.
"One pitch really killed us today."
Saturday saw many more runs
and hits, most of which went the
way of the Cardinal. In all, Stan
ford scored 19 runs on 17 hits,
while Arizona scored eight runs
on 12 hits.
Yesterday's pitching duel was
broken open in the fifth by the
Wildcats. After a Bates two-run
home run off starter Jamie Sepe
da, Billy Owens followed with a
two-run blast of his own, a tower
ing drive to right which made
Bates' homer on Friday look like
a chip shot.
Stanford left 11 men on base
in the afternoon, but nearly tied
it in the eighth when Hammonds'
home run shot was caught at the
top of the left-field fence. One out
later Solomon was outright
robbed of a two-run home run by
right-fielder John Tejcek.
"To be honest," said Mar
quess, "it's going to be tough for
anyone to catch Arizona. They
have their last six games at home
and they're tough to beat there."
Which means that the Cardi
nal will have to hang in second or
third place in the conference, as
the NCAA usually only takes
three Six-Pac teams for the
regionals.
