# Crews come up short in Potomac regattas

When the Stanford men's and women's crew
headed to the Potomac Championships in
Washington, D.C. this weekend, they were per
haps expecting the storybook ending to the first
half of their season.
What they got was more like something out
of The Ten Commandments.
Competition was suspended on the first
scheduled day of rowing due to lightning, severe

thunderstorms and flooding of the Potomac
River, forcing the Cardinal rowers to wait until
Saturday afternoon for their first round heat.
When the waiting was over, the Stanford
women's crew came out top in their first heat
against George Washington, but fell in the semi
final round by a slim 0.5 seconds to Yale.
In the men's division, the Cardinal lost their
first heat before coming back to qualify for the
semifinals. They were edged by 0.5 seconds in
the semifinal by UCLA.
The Cardinal women posted the third best

time overall in the competition, but not good
enough for a berth in the final heat. The Cardi
nal finished fifth in the overall competition.
"Our race came down to the final twenty
strokes," explained women's head coach Wendy
Davis, "and there it all depends on who wants it
more. I guess we didn't want it enough."
However, Davis came away from the regatta
with a positive outlook for her team: "It was def
initely a learning experience for us. We found
out that we're right up there with the best of
them.
