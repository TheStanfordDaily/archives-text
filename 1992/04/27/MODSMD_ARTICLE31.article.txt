College Bowlers come close
Stanford's College Bowl team fell short of win
ning the national championship yesterday, losing
2-0 to MIT in the finals at George Washington
University in Washington, D.C.
"They played well," said Stanford team member
John Overdeck. "I'm afraid the better team won."
Stanford was "a little bit unlucky in a couple of
questions that were tricky," Overdeck said.
"Unfortunately, we weren't able to bring the
championship home."
Stanford's 12-3 record in round-robin play was
the best of the tournament, according to
Overdeck. The record automatically placed Stan
ford in the finals. MIT, Penn and Cornell all had

11-4 records in round-robin play.
Overdeck said MlT's team is "very good. They
have a star, Chip, who gets more than half of the
questions."
Stanford's team won the regional tournament
in February, winning the right to compete in the
national tournament.
The team is composed of Overdeck, a graduate
student; captain Doug Bone, a graduate student;
junior David Frazee; and Gerard Magliocca, a
freshman.
The California State Lottery paid for part of the
Stanford team's expenses, according to Overdeck.
Even though the team didn't win, "it was a
blast," Overdeck said. "It was nice not having
someone calling me 'bozo' over the weekend."
