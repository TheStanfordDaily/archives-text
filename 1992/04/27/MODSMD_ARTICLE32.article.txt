Chinese horse race packs 'em in
CANTON, China (AP) — This southern city
yesterday hosted China's first public horse races
since the Communist revolution of 1949 with an
eclectic mix of cash prizes, American beer ads and
the "William Tell Overture."
And the winner was — capitalism, going away.
A sold-out crowd of 5,000 sometimes scream
ing Chinese packed the Huangcun Racetrack, a
recently converted military airfield, for six races.
Betting was prohibited, but that didn't stop many
from playing the ponies for fun.
"I wouldn't be surprised if people bet among
themselves," said Wu Zhiwei, a Canton banker
attending the event."I would pick horses from
Inner Mongolia because they have more experi

ence."
He must have had a tip.
A Mongolian horse named "Suddenly" won the
last and most important race of the day, the
"Horse of China" derby.
Such an event wouldn't have been possible 10
years ago, said Wu. But with a recent drive toward
economic reform leaving a capitalist hue in the
prosperous south, China's leaders see the sport as
a higher form of entertainment for an increasing
ly wealthy population.
Banners advertising Pabst Blue Ribbon beer,
Pepsi-Cola and other American products lined the
track. No one played "My Old Kentucky Home"
but organizers blasted a taped medley of thump
ing local pop songs and a remix of Rossini's
"William Tell Overture."
