## 'Bender Back' cinches first-ever men's NCAA gymnastics title

In the end, the fruits of the entire season rest
ed on the shoulders of one man and one event.
The 1992 Stanford men's gymnastics
team had breezed its way through the year.
The top-ranked team for much of the season,
the Cardinal had gone down only twice all
year — a season-opening loss to BYU and a
second-place finish in the NCAA Western
Regionals to Nebraska.
On Thursday night, the squad qualified for
Friday's three-team finals by placing first out of
eight NCAA semifinalists in Lincoln, Neb.
Yet none of that mattered as Jeff Bender
began his final routine. Bender was attempting
the "Bender Back," an extremely difficult high
bar move that the junior invented himself.
"It's a move which only he does," said coach
Sadao Hamada. "If he had missed that move,

we might have lost the entire meet. It was a
very risky move."
But Bender didn't miss. His 9.775 high bar
score gave Stanford an overall score of 289.575,
a new collegiate record for team scoring.
More importantly, it landed the Cardinal its
first-ever NCAA men's gymnastics title, and its
fourth NCAA title in 34 days. Women's basket
ball and men's and women's swimming were
the others.
From Day One, the men had one goal in
mind for 1992 — a national championship.
"We were shooting for it for two years," said
senior Tim Ryan. "After last year's finish,
we've been hungry for [the title] all year."
While the 1991 team tailed off at the end of
the season, finishing a disappointing seventh in
the NCAA's after winning the Western Region
al, this year's version of the Cardinal did the
opposite, losing to the Cornhuskers in the
Regionals and edging them out in the finals.

"We weren't that put off at all by our finish
at the Regionals," said Ryan. "Who knows?
Maybe winning the Regionals is a bad omen."
Hamada agreed. "All season, we were trying
to peak for the NCAA Championship," the
coach said. "At the West Regional, I said we
wanted to be at about 80 or 90 percent."
On Thursday, Stanford waltzed into the
finals, taking first place in the preliminaries
thanks to Jair Lynch's all-around score of
58.50, top in the field, and Ryan's own third
place all-around finish. Hosts Nebraska and
Ohio State, winners of the NCAA East
Regional, nabbed the other final-round slots.
A victory in Friday's finals, however, was
anything but a certainty for Stanford. Not only
had the Huskers defeated the Cardinal in the
Regionals, they were backed by an extremely
partisan crowd of 5,059 at the Bob Devaney
