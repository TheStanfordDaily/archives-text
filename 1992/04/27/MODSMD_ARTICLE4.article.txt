## 'Bender Back' cinches first-ever men's NCAA gymnastics title 
### Brian Egan Editorial Staff 
In the end, the fruits of the entire season rest
ed on the shoulders of one man and one event.
The 1992 Stanford men's gymnastics
team had breezed its way through the year.
The top-ranked team for much of the season,
the Cardinal had gone down only twice all
year — a season-opening loss to BYU and a
second-place finish in the NCAA Western
Regionals to Nebraska.
On Thursday night, the squad qualified for
Friday's three-team finals by placing first out of
eight NCAA semifinalists in Lincoln, Neb.
Yet none of that mattered as Jeff Bender
began his final routine. Bender was attempting
the "Bender Back," an extremely difficult high
bar move that the junior invented himself.
"It's a move which only he does," said coach
Sadao Hamada. "If he had missed that move,

we might have lost the entire meet. It was a
very risky move."
But Bender didn't miss. His 9.775 high bar
score gave Stanford an overall score of 289.575,
a new collegiate record for team scoring.
More importantly, it landed the Cardinal its
first-ever NCAA men's gymnastics title, and its
fourth NCAA title in 34 days. Women's basket
ball and men's and women's swimming were
the others.
From Day One, the men had one goal in
mind for 1992 — a national championship.
"We were shooting for it for two years," said
senior Tim Ryan. "After last year's finish,
we've been hungry for [the title] all year."
While the 1991 team tailed off at the end of
the season, finishing a disappointing seventh in
the NCAA's after winning the Western Region
al, this year's version of the Cardinal did the
opposite, losing to the Cornhuskers in the
Regionals and edging them out in the finals.

"We weren't that put off at all by our finish
at the Regionals," said Ryan. "Who knows?
Maybe winning the Regionals is a bad omen."
Hamada agreed. "All season, we were trying
to peak for the NCAA Championship," the
coach said. "At the West Regional, I said we
wanted to be at about 80 or 90 percent."
On Thursday, Stanford waltzed into the
finals, taking first place in the preliminaries
thanks to Jair Lynch's all-around score of
58.50, top in the field, and Ryan's own third
place all-around finish. Hosts Nebraska and
Ohio State, winners of the NCAA East
Regional, nabbed the other final-round slots.
A victory in Friday's finals, however, was
anything but a certainty for Stanford. Not only
had the Huskers defeated the Cardinal in the
Regionals, they were backed by an extremely
partisan crowd of 5,059 at the Bob Devaney
Sports Center in Lincoln during the
finals.
Nebraska also had history on its
side. The school has won seven
NCAA men's gymnastics titles, exact
ly seven more than the combined
total of the Cardinal and the Buck
eyes.
The finals, which saw both Stan
ford and Nebraska (288.95 team
points) shatter the old collegiate team
scoring record (288.40, set March 7 by
the Cardinal against California), were
as great as the buildup surrounding it.
"In my opinion, this is one of the
best collegiate meets I have ever been
to," said Cornhuskers coach Francis
Alien. "We did not give that gymnastics
meet away. The important thing is that
Stanford took the meet away from us."
The Cardinal did that with a per
formance that, while not perfect, was
its guttiest of the season. "We had a
few more misses than Nebraska,"
said Ryan, "but when we hit, there's
nothing more to be said."
The senior personified his own
words perfectly. After missing on his
floor exercise, Ryan bounced back in
his next event, scoring a 9.70 on the
pommel horse in what Hamada called
"one of the key routines of the meet."
Perhaps the real turning point of
the meet for Stanford, however,
occurred after two Cardinal falls in the
vault gave Nebraska a 192.375-
192.125 lead with two events to go.
"We bounced back [at that
point]," said Lynch. "We refused to
let Nebraska win."
Lynch himself was vital to the
resurgence. The Pacific 10 Confer
ence Men's Gymnast of the Year
recorded two 9s and two 9.95s on the
next event, the parallel bars, and the
Cardinal's score 0f48.950 on the bars
was its highest in any of the meet's six
events.

Indeed, the junior's scores at the
finals were impressive, even for
Lynch's far-from-average standards.
In addition to his parallel bars per
formance, the Ail-American record
ed tallies of 9.9 or better on the high
bars and the pommel horse.
Not only was his overall score of
59.025 (out of a possible 60 points)
the highest recorded in the fmals, it is

believed to be the highest recorded in
the history of collegiate gymnastics.
But in the end, the entire meet
rested on Bender's shoulders. Going
into the final event, the high bar,
Ohio State had dropped to a distant
third place, more than two points
behind the Cardinal. The Huskers,
however, were a mere three-tenths of
a point behind Stanford, which had

re-taken the lead after the parallel
bars.
While a miss on the bars would
have opened the door for a Nebraska
victory, Bender's successful conver
sion sealed the championship for the
Cardinal. It was a fitting end to a
match that was dominated by clutch
performances by both Nebraska and
Stanford.
