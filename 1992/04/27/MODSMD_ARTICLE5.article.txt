# Econ tracks will unite: Policy core 'too fuzzy'
## 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
Beginning autumn quarter,
the two existing tracks within the
economics major will be combined
into a single curriculum that
requires both calculus and policy
classes.
Under the new requirements,
elements of both the Quantitative
Economics and Economic Per
spectives and Policies tracks will
be combined into one 60-unit pro
gram leading to a Bachelor of Arts

in Economics.
Economics Prof. Bert Hickman
said the change was suggested
when the department reviewed its
curriculum — as required by the
University every five years — and
faculty saw a need for all eco
nomics majors to learn a more
quantitative approach.
"There were feelings among the
faculty (that we needed) to provide
a more mathematical approach to
economics," Hickman said.

Hickman added that there had
been an increase in the number of

Quantitative majors in past years,
and that the new curriculum
"combines the best features of the
former separate tracks."
He said that since the quanti
tative program was first offered
about 25 years ago, the percent
age of economics majors focusing
in it has grown from around 25
percent to more than 50 percent.
After discussion among depart
ment faculty, Hickman said a com
mittee of six faculty members was
formed to create — with the use of
student input — the "ideal cur

riculum" for the economics major.
Requirements within the new
major include a year of calculus,
which formerly was only part of
the Quantitative track. Eco
nomics 51, which does not use cal
culus in its curriculum, will not be
offered after this year.
Quantitative Economics major
Darren Donnelley said he doesn't
see a way to fully understand eco
nomics without studying calculus.
