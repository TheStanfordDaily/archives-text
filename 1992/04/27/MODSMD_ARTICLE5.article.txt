# Econ tracks will unite: Policy core 'too fuzzy'
## 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
Beginning autumn quarter,
the two existing tracks within the
economics major will be combined
into a single curriculum that
requires both calculus and policy
classes.
Under the new requirements,
elements of both the Quantitative
Economics and Economic Per
spectives and Policies tracks will
be combined into one 60-unit pro
gram leading to a Bachelor of Arts

in Economics.
Economics Prof. Bert Hickman
said the change was suggested
when the department reviewed its
curriculum — as required by the
University every five years — and
faculty saw a need for all eco
nomics majors to learn a more
quantitative approach.
"There were feelings among the
faculty (that we needed) to provide
a more mathematical approach to
economics," Hickman said.

Hickman added that there had
been an increase in the number of

Quantitative majors in past years,
and that the new curriculum
"combines the best features of the
former separate tracks."
He said that since the quanti
tative program was first offered
about 25 years ago, the percent
age of economics majors focusing
in it has grown from around 25
percent to more than 50 percent.
After discussion among depart
ment faculty, Hickman said a com
mittee of six faculty members was
formed to create — with the use of
student input — the "ideal cur

riculum" for the economics major.
Requirements within the new
major include a year of calculus,
which formerly was only part of
the Quantitative track. Eco
nomics 51, which does not use cal
culus in its curriculum, will not be
offered after this year.
Quantitative Economics major
Darren Donnelley said he doesn't
see a way to fully understand eco
nomics without studying calculus.
"The Economic Perspectives and
Policy msyor is notoriously too
fuzzy for anybody," he said.
"Economics necessarily involves
calculus," he added. "To me, trying
to take math out of economics is
just silly."
Patricia Lee, an Economic Per
spectives and Policy mayor, said
she sees a need for more mathe
matical requirements in the track.
"As long as the new major doesn't
go too far to the mathematics side,
it looks like it'll be a good balance
with the policy," she said.
The new curriculum includes
four required economics classes,
one statistics class, one year of
calculus and 30 units of other
Economics courses, chosen from
different areas.
A new class under develop
ment, which is "somewhat more
advanced" than Statistics 60 and
more mathematically oriented,
will fulfill the statistics require
ment, Hickman said.
Also, the course "Economic Pol
icy Analysis," formerly required
only of Economic Perspectives and
Policies students, will be included
on the curriculum of all economics
majors. Hickman said the class
will allow all students to "get expe
rience in thinking about policy and
writing policy papers."

Students who declare before
May 30 will have the option of ful
filling either the new or old
requirements. Economic Perspec
tives and Policies majors who don't
want to include calculus in their
curriculum must take Economics
51 before fall quarter, since the
class is being discontinued.

Hickman said there hasn't

the split of Quantitative and Eco

majors has been the same as in
the past.
The Economics Honors Pro
gram has also been changed to

requirements.
Students who wish to enroll in
the honors program must now
complete all requirements for the
major, take Economics 102 and
Economics 103 or 104 as part of
the 30-unit requirement and have
a grade point average of 3.5 or
higher in all economic courses.
