# Black Avant-Garde panelists 'bash icons'
## 
### Cheo H. Coker Staff writer 
The black Avant-Garde has
one singular mission: to alter age
old stereotypes of what consti
tutes black performing art.
In the process, boundaries are
stretched to accommodate sepa
rate, yet unified, visions of a new
black Aesthetic unshackled by the
limitations of the dominant culture.
Last Saturday, members of
this movement gathered at the
Law School for an event spon
sored by the Committee on Black
Performing Arts.
Titled "The Black Avant-Garde
and the Concept of a Black Aes
thetic: Expanding Definitions,
Breaking Boundaries," the day
long symposium featured panels of
writers, scholars and performance
artists dedicated to eliminating
barriers that hinder black art.
Panels were interspersed with
performances by jazz violinist India
Cook, student-dancer Marshell
Jones and cast members from the
forthcoming Stanford production
of Suzi Lori Park's Avant-Garde
play, "The Death of the Last Black
Man In the Whole Entire World."
While many panelists dis
agreed with the term "Avant-
Garde" as descriptive of their
works, they all concluded that
there was no one monolithic defi
nition of "real" black art.
Toward the end of the event,
however, many of the artists
abandoned the term Avant-Garde,
calling it a limitation to describe
what they do. Visual artist Dewey

Krumpler said using the term for
black performing arts is like using
the study of ornithology for birds.
Following opening addresses by
committee director Harry Elam,
Humanities and Sciences Dean
Ewart Thomas and Drama Dept.
Chair Michael Ramsaur, keynote
speaker Laurie Carlos described the
freedom that performance art allots
to the unconventional black artist.
"In performance art, [black
people! are allowed to use our

voice to discuss what it is we are
feeling, what we are seeing, how
we are doing in the world and
what we remember," she said.
As a member of the original
Broadway cast of Ntozake Shange's
ground-breaking play, "For Col
ored Girls..Carlos is no stranger
to breaking the accepted norms in
search of an uninhibited voice.
The morning panel, titled
"Definitions of a Black Aesthet
ic," featured Carlos, Spanish and

Portuguese Prof. Sylvia Wynter,
playwright Paul Carter Harrison
and novelist Trey Ellis, a Stanford
alumnus.
As Wynter and her former
pupil Ellis pointed out, much of
black art is a subversion and a
challenge to norms established by
the dominant culture.
Part of black Avant-Garde
artists' responsibility is to "bash
icons ... to clear the slate of any
definitions as to what black art
must be," Ellis said.
But at the same time, the
Avaiit-Garde artists undeniably
incorporate old values into their
new forms of expression.
For the artist, "It's taking those
memories, it's taking that tradi
tion, and somehow putting it into a
new and contemporary mold that
speaks to us today," Elam said.
Ellen Sebastian, a theater direc
tor, also related the importance of
tradition to her "experimental"
work during the afternoon panel:
"Black Avant-Garde Artistic Prac
tice: The Experimental Nature of
Contemporary Black Art."
Preservation of culture "is part
of my passion," Sebastian said, "to
preserve something that my
grandmother said. And if all I can
do is write a play that has her corn
bread recipe in it, there's a part of
me that says 'something of my
grandmother will go through time,
because her physical body won't.' "
Elam, concluding the events,
talked of even newer forms.
"Artists are creating new labels,"
he said. "Perhaps we are moving
away from the idea of labels at all."
