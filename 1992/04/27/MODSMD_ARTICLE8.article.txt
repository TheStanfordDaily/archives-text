# Warnings painted near storm drains
## 'Froth' flows from foothills to the Bay 
### Sara Skinner Staff writer 
Ten Soto residents armed with
aerosol cans and rubber gloves
spray-painted campus last Satur
day. But no, they weren't dirtying
campus with graffiti — they were
raising awareness.
As a part of the Environmental
Health and Safety Department's
Storm Drain Painting Project,
students stenciled "No Dumping
— Goes to Bay" on the asphalt
next to storm drains all over cam
pus. The slogan is framed by a
bird and river scene.
"People don't have an under
standing [of where the water
goes] when they put something in
a drain on the street," said Laura
Bonk, environmental compliance
analyst for Health and Safety.
Unlike waste water from
household sinks and sewer sys
tems, the water that flows into
storm drains isn't treated.
"Anything that goes in this
drain," Bonk said, pointing to a
newly-painted storm drain, "goes
right into the Bay without any
treatment or any filters."
Storm drains are scattered all
over campus. They are square
grates placed over holes in the
asphalt where rain water flows
into creeks.
"We have really high pollution

rates at Stanford," said Khoi
Tran, a sophomore in Soto who
organized the student effort.
"Every time I bike I see dirty
storm drains."
The effects of the pollution are
evident in both San Francisquito
and Serra Street creeks, Bonk said.
"I live on the San Francisquito
Creek. There's a large pipe that
leaves Stanford. Some days it's
green, some days it's frothy
We've gotten complaints where the
creeks have been red."
Wildlife also suffers from
storm drain polluting, according
to Bonk. She said the bird on the
stencil is not a duck, but a Clap
per Rail, which is "rapidly going
extinct" from eating food contam
inated by heavy metals, which
then cause its eggs to be weaker.
"Its last stronghold is the South
San Francisco Bay," Bonk said.
Stanford is a part of the Santa
Clara Valley Nonpoint Source Pol
lution Control Program, which
aims to clean up the San Francis
co Bay through advertising on
buses and radio and through
painting signs near drains.
Stanford is a "pretty big con
tributor [of pollution] around
here, obviously, because it's such
a big place," Bonk said.

Sophomore Khoi Tran views a newly painted storm drain warning. Stu
dents stenciled the messages on Saturday to thwart polluters. Sub
stances in the drains flow directly to the Bay without being treated.
