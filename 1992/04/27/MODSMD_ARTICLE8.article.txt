# Warnings painted near storm drains
## 'Froth' flows from foothills to the Bay 
### Sara Skinner Staff writer 
Ten Soto residents armed with
aerosol cans and rubber gloves
spray-painted campus last Satur
day. But no, they weren't dirtying
campus with graffiti — they were
raising awareness.
As a part of the Environmental
Health and Safety Department's
Storm Drain Painting Project,
students stenciled "No Dumping
— Goes to Bay" on the asphalt
next to storm drains all over cam
pus. The slogan is framed by a
bird and river scene.
"People don't have an under
standing [of where the water
goes] when they put something in
a drain on the street," said Laura
Bonk, environmental compliance
analyst for Health and Safety.
Unlike waste water from
household sinks and sewer sys
tems, the water that flows into
storm drains isn't treated.
"Anything that goes in this
drain," Bonk said, pointing to a
newly-painted storm drain, "goes
right into the Bay without any
treatment or any filters."
Storm drains are scattered all
over campus. They are square
grates placed over holes in the
asphalt where rain water flows
into creeks.
"We have really high pollution

rates at Stanford," said Khoi
Tran, a sophomore in Soto who
organized the student effort.
"Every time I bike I see dirty
storm drains."
The effects of the pollution are
evident in both San Francisquito
and Serra Street creeks, Bonk said.
"I live on the San Francisquito
Creek. There's a large pipe that
leaves Stanford. Some days it's
green, some days it's frothy
We've gotten complaints where the
creeks have been red."
Wildlife also suffers from
storm drain polluting, according
to Bonk. She said the bird on the
stencil is not a duck, but a Clap
per Rail, which is "rapidly going
extinct" from eating food contam
inated by heavy metals, which
then cause its eggs to be weaker.
"Its last stronghold is the South
San Francisco Bay," Bonk said.
Stanford is a part of the Santa
Clara Valley Nonpoint Source Pol
lution Control Program, which
aims to clean up the San Francis
co Bay through advertising on
buses and radio and through
painting signs near drains.
Stanford is a "pretty big con
tributor [of pollution] around
here, obviously, because it's such
a big place," Bonk said.

to advise people that "anything
that enters a storm drain goes
directly into one of the creeks
. . . that flow right into the
Bay."
She said they are trying to
reduce "nonpoint source pollu
tants," materials and chemicals
that enter the drains from homes,
schools, or a source other than a
particular industry.
Stanford is applying for a Cen
eral National Pollutant Discharge

Elimination System Permit from
the State Water Resources Con
trol Board.
Bonk said that Stanford is con
sidered a major industry, "like
Chevron or Lockheed," and as
such needs a permit to protect its
water.
The campaign to reduce "non
point source pollutants" is part of a
nationwide effort initiated by the
Environmental Protection Agency.
Similar programs have already
shown considerable success in the
Hudson River and Chesapeake
Bay areas, Bonk said.
She said there are some easy
ways for people to prevent pollut
ing the waters. She suggests:

• Going to a commercial car
washer. They recycle the water
used, which is "worth the $7 for
the conservation and the storms
drains," Bonk said.
• Mop water should go down a
sink or toilet, Bonk said, because
that water is treated.
• Used motor oil can be
brought to any gas station, which
will recycle it. Or have your oil
changed at the station, since gas
stations are under strict environ
mental controls for the disposal of
waste.
Overall, Bonk stressed that
storm drains "are designed for
rain water and that's all they
should be used for."

Sophomore Khoi Tran views a newly painted storm drain warning. Stu
dents stenciled the messages on Saturday to thwart polluters. Sub
stances in the drains flow directly to the Bay without being treated.
is part of a public education plan
to advise people that "anything
that enters a storm drain goes
directly into one of the creeks
. . . that flow right into the
Bay."
She said they are trying to
reduce "nonpoint source pollu
tants," materials and chemicals
that enter the drains from homes,
schools, or a source other than a
particular industry.
Stanford is applying for a Cen
eral National Pollutant Discharge

Elimination System Permit from
the State Water Resources Con
trol Board.
Bonk said that Stanford is con
sidered a major industry, "like
Chevron or Lockheed," and as
such needs a permit to protect its
water.
The campaign to reduce "non
point source pollutants" is part of a
nationwide effort initiated by the
Environmental Protection Agency.
Similar programs have already
shown considerable success in the
Hudson River and Chesapeake
Bay areas, Bonk said.
She said there are some easy
ways for people to prevent pollut
ing the waters. She suggests:

• Going to a commercial car
washer. They recycle the water
used, which is "worth the $7 for
the conservation and the storms
drains," Bonk said.
• Mop water should go down a
sink or toilet, Bonk said, because
that water is treated.
• Used motor oil can be
brought to any gas station, which
will recycle it. Or have your oil
changed at the station, since gas
stations are under strict environ
mental controls for the disposal of
waste.
Overall, Bonk stressed that
storm drains "are designed for
rain water and that's all they
should be used for."
