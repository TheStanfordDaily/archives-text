# Pledges increase 10 percent after last Wilbur Rush
## 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Stanford sororities sharp
ened their sales pitch this year,
attracting 20 more pledges dur
ing Rush than they did last year
— even though the number of
women rushing remained con
stant.
This year, 282 women
rushed — the same number as
last year — and 194 pledged.
The numbers satisfied Rush
co-chair Gretchen Wustrack,
who said one of her goals was
"to bring more women into the
Greek system."
Wustrack, a senior, said she
believes the increased role of
Rush counselors was one rea
son more women stayed in
Rush this year.
"The Rush counselors were
more responsive to individual
concerns," Wustrack said,
adding that the counselors
went through a long traini
process to learn how to help the
rushees along and encourage
them to stick with Rush.
There were also more pre-
Rush informational meetings
this year, Wustrack said. So
unlike previous years — when
many women rushed without
knowing whether they would
like it — they entered Rush feel
ing comfortable, and had a gen
eral idea that they wanted to
pledge, according to Wustrack.
This year's Rush will proba
bly be the last held on Wilbur
field, Wustrack said, mostly
because of complaints about
rushees' use of Wilbur dormi
tories' facilities.
In Otero, on one of the first
nights of Rush, "the bathroom
on the first floor flooded
because so many people were
using it, causing a big hassle in
the dorm," said Lexi Smith, an
Otero resident assistant.
The rushees continued to
use the bathroom even after
Otero residents put signs up
asking them not to use it,
Smith said.
Sorority members are cur
rently looking into alternate
sites for next year's Rush,

Wustrack said.
Stanford Fire Marshall Ray
Gamma said a fire hazard in
some of the tents was also
problematic.
According to Gamma, the
Rush chairs "weren't previous
ly advised they weren't allowed
to use combustible materials
inside the tents." Gamma said
one of the tents had hay and a
couple had candles.
But overall, Rush was suc
cessful, according to Wustrack.
She said five of the seven soror
ities that took part in Rush met
the general quota set by the
Intersorority Council by adding
at least 31 new women each.
Last year only three of the
eight sororities that took part
in Rush met the 1991 quota of
29 women.
The quota, which is deter
mined by the ISC in the middle
of Rush, is based on how many
women enter Rush, how many
finish and the number of soror
ities participating. The quotas
are established to ensure a bal
ance among the sororities.
"We have the quotas to
make sure there are not just
three big sororities and three
small ones which could eventu
ally fizzle out. We want to
make sure we have a diversi
ty," Wustrack said.
Delta Gamma and Alpha
Phi, the two sororities that did
not add enough pledges during
formal Rush, continued to give
out bids after Rush in order to
meet the quota.
Delta Gamma has now
reached the 31-pledge quota, and
Alpha Phi is still offering bids.
Gamma Phi Beta, which is
giving up its charter at the end
of this year, did not participate
in Rush, Wustrack said.
Four of the sororities — Chi
Omega, Delta Delta Delta,
Kappa Alpha Theta and Pi
Beta Phi — ended up with 33
new pledges. Kappa Kappa
Gamma, the largest sorority,
ended up with 32.

Adriana Duffy credits the suc
cess of Rush to chairs Wus
track and junior Cheryl Spain.
