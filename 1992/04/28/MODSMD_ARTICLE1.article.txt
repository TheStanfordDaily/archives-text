## Health and Safety reports few glitches at annual meeting 
### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
The University Committee on
Health and Safety held its annual
public meeting last night, focus
ing on such issues as the "Tiger
Team" inspection of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, waste
water contamination and compli
ance with new legal and regulato
ry requirements.
The committee, taking a "no
news is good news" attitude,
reported no major problems.
Committee member Matthew
Allen, associate director of environ
ment, safety and health adminis
tration at SLAC, reported that the
final Tiger Team inspection report
will be issued within a month and
that a draft version — "reporting
no major violations" — was already
available at the SLAC library.
Earlier in the year, a Depart
ment of Energy Tiger Team con
ducted a five-week inspection of
SLAC for environmental and safe
ty violations. The most serious
citations were for "deficiencies
and weaknesses in monitoring and
management systems," Allen said.
But overall, he said, "We came
through with flying colors."
The meeting in the Terman
Engineering Auditorium, intend
ed to serve as a forum for commu
nity input and questions, was
attended by about 30 people.
Menlo Park resident Dolores
Ferman raised concern that SLAC
may have been contaminating
nearby San Francisquito Creek and
expressed frustration that SLAC
had done little to inform the public
about the Tiger Team report.
"The amount of contamination
is really quite small," Allen

responded, noting that larger con
tamination problems are posed by
materials improperly disposed of
in storm drains.
Outgoing Director of Environ
mental Health and Safety Thomas
Mcßride said the University has
started to address this problem by
painting warning signs near storm
drains. The signs alert people that

materials dumped into the drains
flow directly into San Francisco
Bay without treatment.
Mcßride expressed concern over
other matters, including Universi
ty-wide compliance with state law
SB 198, the Accident and Illness
Prevention Act. This far-reaching


Outgoing Director of Environmental Health and Safety Thomas
Mcßride addressed community concerns last night at the annual
public health and safety meeting.
