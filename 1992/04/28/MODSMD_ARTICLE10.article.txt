# And the winner is... Simon
## Serra RFs ask residents to suggest baby names 
### Liesl Olson Staff writer 
An unorthodox experiment ended yesterday, as
Serra resident fellows Ross and Ruth Shachter post
ed the results of a baby-naming contest inspired by
the baby boy they are expecting in May.
The Shachters chose "Simon," sophomore
Cameron Hamill's submission. Hamill will win two
tickets to the show "Once on This Island," which
will be playing in San Francisco around the baby's
May 10 due date.
The Shachters initially asked Serra residents on
an informal basis for name suggestions. This
request evolved into a full-fledged naming contest
that officially started in mid-March.
Ross said he and his wife decided the contest
would be a good outlet for the residents' creativity,
as well as a way to get ideas for their baby's name.
"We never cease to be amazed at the creativity of
Stanford students," he said.
Ruth added, "They came up with names we would
have never considered."
The Shachters received a total of 18 suggestions,
ranging from "Ishmael" to "Dylan," Ruth said.
Hamill will receive her official congratulations at
the dorm's house meeting next Wednesday, where the
announcement of the contest results will be made, in
case students have not seen the notice up on the board.
"At this point, I don't even think Cameron
knows," Ruth said last night, pointing out that she
had not reached Hamill yet to congratulate her. "We
just wrote it up on the board today."
Hamill could not be reached for comment yesterday.
Although the contest has come to a close, Ruth
said they will "definitely not make the final decision
until the baby is born." Ross explained that "a lot of
personality is shown as soon as a baby is born."
They will definitely keep "Simon" and some of
the other suggestions in mind, Ruth said.
"The prize was for originality, but we really have
to reserve the final judgement," she added.

Because Ross is Jewish and Ruth is Japanese-
American, they asked residents to think of with
names that will reflect both of their cultures, with
Biblical Hebrew and Japanese significance.
"Si" means "knowledge" and "mon" means "lit
erature" in Japanese, Ruth said. The phrase "si
mon" can be translated as "knowledge of books."
"Simon" is translated as "to hear or be heard" in
a dictionary of Jewish names, she said.
Ruth said the choice was difficult, and if she had
to pick a runner-up, it would be "Elijah," which
means "a great person" in Japanese and is the name
of a Biblical character.
Other submissions included "Noah" and
"Micah." Ruth said not all of the suggested names fit
the Japanese-Hebrew criteria.
The Shachters have also achieved a multicultural
blend in the name of their first child, Naomi.
Naomi is a Biblical character, and the name means
"pleasant" or "sweet" in Hebrew. In Japanese, the syl
lables of Naomi mean "straight line" and "beauty," and
when read as a phrase, they mean "truly beautiful."
Ross said he thinks there will be some betting
among Serra residents to estimate the date of birth
and weight of the baby. "Not that we condone that,"
he said, laughing.
Serra residents are looking forward to having
another child in the dorm.
"I'm really excited for the new baby," said sopho
more Lisa Goldman. "Naomi already keeps the dorm
from being totally homogeneous — it's nice to see a
little kid wandering around."
Goldman added that since she is a human biology
major, "it's cool to see all the things that I'm learn
ing about (child development) acted out in Naomi."
Naomi, who has lived in Serra nearly all of her
two years, does not seem flustered at the prospect of
a younger brother. "Brother in Mommy's tummy,"
she said, patting her own stomach.
The outgoing toddler can frequently be seen rid
ing around on tray carts in Serra's dining hall,
"drinking up the attention of the dorm," Ross said.
