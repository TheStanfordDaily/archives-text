All-or-nothing strategy
the strongest tactic for
abortion-rights activists

THE EQUALLY passionate
but entirely disparate argu
ments presented before the
Supreme Court this week prove
that on the abortion issue, the cen
ter cannot hold.
To legislate any restrictions on a
woman's right to have an abortion
flies in the face of the 1973 Roe vs.
Wade decision, which cited the per
sonal and private aspects of pregnan
cy decisions in legalizing abortion.
The court must now decide
whether to uphold a Pennsylvania
state law requiring a woman to
notify the father and (if she is a
minor) her parents, and wait 24
hours before having an abortion.
To prevent the slow decay of
Roe by laws such as this one, and
more specifically to raise voter
awareness and ire, the ACLU is
calling for an all-or-nothing deci
sion from the Supreme Court — a
final judgment on whether to
uphold or overturn the Roe vs.
Wade decision that has stood for
20 years.
And they don't want to settle for
anything in between. Nor should
they.
The all-or-nothing tactic was
chosen for explicit political rea
sons. The election year provides an
undeniable opportunity for pro
choice voters to show their clout at
the voting booths. And if 500,000
ralliers who protested in Washing
ton earlier this month are any
indication, this electoral force may
be substantial indeed.
But more compelling reasons
exist for rejecting compromise.
The court's decision in this case
will inevitably extend beyond the
specific restrictions in the Penn
sylvania law. And by upholding it,
the court would pave the way for
stricter state legislation, closing
off the abortion option to more and

more women.
The women hurt the most by
legal constrictions are the poor and
the underprivileged, who lack the
resources to circumvent the new
restrictions. For instance, it is poor
and uneducated women who will
be targeted if medical advice to
women undergoing abortion is
rescinded, as some states have
already done.
The circumstances surrounding
a woman's decision to continue or
abort a pregnancy are painfully
personal and very private, and the
government has no business legis
lating such individual decisions.
Restrictive legislation and ter
rorist tactics followed by anti
abortion activists — including
death threats to doctors who per
form abortions — have contribut
ed to the gradual but marked
decline in the number of hospitals
offering abortion and the number
of doctors willing to perform them.
Tattered and torn after recent
court decisions; pushed, pulled and
distorted by state laws; and attacked
on the vigilante front by militant
Bible-beating anti-abortion activists,
Roe stands as a very tenuous guar
antee of reproductive rights.
The current composition of the
court, a result of the careful stack
ing of the courts by the Reagan
and Bush administrations, does
not portend well for the future of
abortion rights.
Since a majority of people in this
country want abortion to remain
legal, their elected representatives
in Washington ought to have
reflected thiß view by screening the
justices more carefully for their
positions on abortion.
During an election year, voter
discontent on the issue of abortion
rights could well translate into
greater support for women candi
dates for Congress.
While few situations would war
rant an endorsement of a bottom
line approach to negotiation, the
abortion issue presents a com
pelling case in which anything less
than an ultimatum would prove
unacceptable.
