## Looking for an Answer

Sometimes i find myself
thinking about death, and a chill
fills me. The concept of nonexis
tence seeps into consciousness. There is
cold realization. And then fear. I try to
shake it off.
When I was younger and this hap
pened, I would lie in bed in the dark and
think desperately about the different
friends I would invite if I were to have a
birthday party. Why? I don't know. It
was a way for me to run away from scary
thoughts, to root myself back to everyday
life. And push death back.
I've been fortunate. No one very close
to me has died. My grandparents have
always lived in Taiwan, and a$ 9 resist,
I've never really known them. Only my
mother's father is still alive, and he
comes to the States to visit once in a
while. But I can't even talk to him
because my Chinese isn't good enough. I
can't ask him about himself, his child
hood, his life. I don't know him.
Lately I've been scared about my par
ents. They're in their fifties and in good
health, I guess. I've spent the last two
summers at home in New York with
them, but this year I won't be there. I
don't feel obligated, but I'm questioning
my priorities and choices, asking myself
if I'm too self-centered.
I wonder how much my fears about
aging and death arise from lack of contact
with older people. Maybe I wouldn't be so

uneasy if I'd grown up knowing my
grandparents.
I watch these films in my Hum
Bio/Anthro class, Aging: From Biology to
Social Policy. I think about my own mis
conceptions about the "elderly." I think
about the frustration of being treated like
a child. I think about the woman who
assumed the appearance of an older per
son to experience what it was like to be
old. One time she was mugged, and the
young boys stayed to brutally beat the
"old woman" after taking her purse.
Unlike other classifications for which
discrimination occurs, my professor
points out, we eventually join the group
we have stereotypes about — the elderly.
A white person, for example, will never
know what it is to be black, but a young
person will one day be old. Because peo
ple internalize these stereotypes, many
refuse to acknowledge problems they
have as they age because they are con
scious of the stigma of being old.
We don't like to talk about death. For
some, religion is an answer. Sometimes
I've wished that I could believe in a heav
en or reincarnation or something. But I
can't. Instead, I suppose, I'm in the pro
cess of constructing my own understand
ing. It is scary to think about existing for
this finite time and then not being for the
rest of infinity. And I don't have much
say in that.
I'm taking a class called Introduction

to Buddhism with some friends. It is
amazing to talk to them and discover that
they too have questions. I think a class
like this allows people to talk about death
and life without awkwardness or philoso
phizing.
I think that a consciousness of death
makes us realize what's important and
what's not. I listen to men and women in
their 70's and 80's talk about life, their
approach to living and how they feel
about death. I feel comforted. If they are
not afraid of dying, then maybe I
shouldn't be either.
Perhaps the recent execution of a man
on death row has brought these thoughts
to a forefront. I always remember the end
of the movie "Blade Runner." A man saves
Harrison Ford's life afler they've tried to
kill each other. On the verge of death him
self, we are told that in the end he loved
life more than anything else, any life —
even that of the man he wanted to kill.
Perhaps humanity and compassion do
indeed arise from the recognition of our
own mortality.
I hope that through my efforts I come
to an acceptance of death.
