Environmentalism and progress not mutually exclusive

CTT 7*TH ANOTHER EARTH day
\l\l upon us, now is an excellent
Y ▼ time to evaluate environmen
talism." In his April 23 letter to The
Daily, Jonathon Marek was completely
right about this, but unfortunately he
reached the wrong conclusion. He
attempted to prove that environmental
ists show contempt for human life, when
in fact we have the ultimate respect for
human life.
Marek presents the idea that the way
to improve the human condition is to
embrace industry and technology. Yet
modem technology is responsible for the
gas leak which killed thousands of peo
ple in Bhopal, India; modern technology
is responsible for the toxic dump which
killed 10 percent of the population in

Casmalia, California; modern technology
is responsible for the Valdez oil spill
which caused hundreds of fishermen to
lose their source of income. This is con
tempt for human life.
We can no longer look at things as
separated, unconscious entities. We
must look beyond our own self-interests.
What Ayn Rand proposes is a way of
living which shows contempt for all
human life except for ones own. She sug
gests that as long as a person is not
directly affected by environmental
degradation, it should be of no concern.
Ayn Rand probably would have seen
the environmental movement a little dif
ferently if a hazardous waste incinerator
had been built in her backyard.
She might have moved to a cleaner

place, but we are quickly running out of
those places. That is why we must take
steps to preserve a safe environment for
every person in every community.
We are not looking to a virus which
would kill billions of people as the solu
tion to our environmental problems. We
are looking for a way to protect both the
planet and the people on it without sac
rificing the integrity of either.
Ayn Rand further contends that we
are inhibiting human progress when
we seek the preservation of the natural
world. The goal of human progress
should be to reach a level of human
thought where we don't have to
destroy something to move ourselves
forward.
Human progress and environmental

ism do not have to be mutually exclu
sive. Environmentalism is searching for
a way to unite the two concepts in
developing sustainable lifestyles. For
instance, electric cars are an increasing
ly efficient way to get where you're
going without the typical automobile
pollution.
Earth Day 1992 has passed, and it is
time to look beyond our personal inter
ests and work toward the universal goal
of an inhabitable planet. As Billy Bragg
proclaimed, "This earth was made a
common treasury for everyone to share:
All things in common, all people one."
