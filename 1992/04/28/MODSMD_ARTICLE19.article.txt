# Environmentalists do care for human beings

### 
I am writing in response to Jonathon
Marek's letter in Thursday's Daily claim
ing to "evaluate" environmentalism.
"Environmentalists assault our
human dignity every day here at Stan
ford ... in their demands that we
breathe the smell of unflushed urine in
order to save enough water to preserve a
certain type of minnow.. . "
If Marek had any idea of what he was
talking about, he would know that we
are in the middle of a drought and that
is why we are trying to save water. We
are not acting to preserve any species
but our own.
Marek claims that "if the good of man
were the aim of the environmentalists,
they would embrace the industry and
technology that have eradicated ... dis
eases, plagues, pestilence and famines. .."
What he has overlooked is the fact that
one-fourth of all our medicinal drugs are
currently derived from plants of the rain
forest.

When environmentalists argue for
actions like a ban on rainforest destruc
tion, they are not just trying to save a
few pretty birds. They are trying to pre
serve the ten thousand species which
already provide treatments for diseases
like leukemia, heart disease and
Hodgkin's disease — and just might hold
the cures for AIDS and cancer.
Marek also argues against a compro
mise between business and the environ
ment. A polluted stream kills everything
that drinks from it. And not only does
the increasing tropospheric ozone levels
caused by fossil fuel combustion harm
wild plants, but it also has been proven
to reduce crop yield and cause lung dam
age in humans and every other mammal
on the planet.
Environmentalism is not the desire to
kill billions of people to save one tree, as
Marek seems to think, but a cry to stop
this destructive madness before we kill
both our planet and ourselves. After all,
what good is massive technology and a
thriving economy if we make ourselves
extinct in the process?
