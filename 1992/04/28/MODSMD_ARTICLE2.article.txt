# Aid advocacy office lacking new leaders
## 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
The Council of Presidents may
not be the only ASSU office to
fade away next year. Senior Vince
Ricci, director of the ASSU Finan
cial Aid Advocacy Office, said yes
terday he has only received two
applications for the six-member
board of the office.
"It's sort of sad that more stu
dents are not willing to work on
the issue," said John Overdeck, a
member of the current COP.
Ricci agreed, noting that
incoming University President
Gerhard Casper is "talking about
need-blind admissions being open
for debate and we're just going to
need a strong group of students"
who are well-informed and able to
organize students around finan
cial aid issues.
The office was set up this year
to supply students with informa
tion on financial aid and to lobby
on behalf of students both at Stan

ford and on the national level.
"I think the office is particular
ly important, especially next year,
[because] Casper has doubts
about the importance of financial
aid," Overdeck said, adding that
"students need to make the case
for financial aid."
The need for the office will also
increase because "next year there
will be no COP [and] the COP was
very active this year" on the
financial aid issue, Ricci said.
"We need people to serve on
University committees," he said.
"We need to be at the meetings."
Junior Dale Edmondson, one
of the two people who have
applied to fill the office, agreed,
saying he would like the office to
be "a voice in University decisions
on financial aid."
Even if only two students
express interest in running the
office, Ricci said the office will con
tinue to exist. However, he said he
fears the students will "just be
overwhelmed by the issue ... or
they just won't do as much."
"I think two people is probably
too few ... if you want it to be an
effective activist group," Edmond
son said.
Sophomore Ann Downey, the
other person who applied for the
office's positions, said, "The
amount of outreach you could do
would be seriously limited" with
only two people involved.
Both Ricci and Overdeck said
the office this year was successful
in lobbying the University admin
istration.
"Vince and his staff did a
tremendous job (and) there were
marked successes," Overdeck said,
citing the University's commit
ment to increasing aid as tuition
rises and the University's move to
reduce self-help for students on aid.
According to Ricci, the office's
efforts reduced the impact of budget
cuts on the financial aid budget. "We
met with University officials We

'You don't need a
building takeover to
have an impact.'
—Vince Ricci

were sort of everywhere the admin
istration was, raising issues (and)
raising concerns," he said.
"You don't need a building
takeover to have an impact," he
added. Ricci was one of 55 students
arrested in May 1989 for taking
over University President Donald
Kennedy's office, in part to protest
a proposed 8 percent tuition hike.
Ricci said he is still looking for
applicants and has extended the
application deadline until next
week. Although he has contacted
resident assistants and organiza
tions representing students of
color, Ricci said he is mostly rely
ing on "word of mouth."
He added that the allocation of
salaries for next year's group may
encourage students to work in the
office. According to Overdeck,
$ 1,700 has been allocated in salaries
for next year's board members.
