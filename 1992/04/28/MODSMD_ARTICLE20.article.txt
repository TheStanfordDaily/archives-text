# Movement's goal is to save Earth for children

As one considered by many to be a
somewhat radical environmentalist, I
would like to add to Rafe Sagarin's critique
of Jonathon Marek's letter: "Environmen
talists show contempt for human life."
The only contempt I see is the con
tempt shown by Marek's ilk for their
children and all those to whom we will
this planet.
Australian health authorities current
ly report a threefold increase in skin
cancer rates over the past decade, and
NASA has warned just this winter of a
northern ozone hole far larger than
researchers had thought possible.
Given that CFCs remain in the atmo
sphere for thirty years, and even now, we
have refused an immediate ban on the
chemicals, it is quite clear that in the
name of progress we have doomed our
selves to a future of skin cancer,
cataracts and a ruined marine ecosystem.
I do not see how anyone can place
"intrinsic value" on such wanton

destruction, and I do not see how anyone
can claim that we have benefited from
the trade-off between air-conditioned
high rise office buildings versus the abil
ity to go outside without fearing the sun.
The ozone issue is over; we lost it
when we ignored the problem in the
'70s. Soon we will have to hide. Howev
er, it provides a good example of the
vacuity of the argument that if an envi
ronmental catastrophe presents itself we
can solve it scientifically.
How can we be so cruel as to leave
future generations with no forests in
which to find peace, with no ozone to
protect them from deadly ultraviolet
rays, with no topsoil in which to grow
their food? How can we do this and
claim to not be "Life-Haters"?
Marek quotes Ayn Rand as saying
that to restrict technology is to censor
the mind. I wonder what will happen
when he hands to his children a smoul
dering, dying world covered with steam
ing asphalt and tells them that we have
increased human happiness, tamed the
wild earth and that the mind is now free.
