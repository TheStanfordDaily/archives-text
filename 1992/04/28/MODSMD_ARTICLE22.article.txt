## Netters cruise to third consecutive championship 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior Staff Writer 
If anyone thought that last week's losses to
UCLA and USC would slow down the men's tennis
team, they were sorely mistaken.
At the Pacific 10 Individual Championships in
Ojai, the Cardinal breezed past both its southern
foes in total points, winning the tournament for
the third year in a row.
The top-ranked team also claimed individual
titles in every competition — Alex O'Brien defend
ed his Championship singles title and teamed up
with Chris Cocotos to claim the Championship
doubles title while Jason Yee brought home the
Invitational singles title and Roman Sydorak and
Billy Wright held off all the competition in the
Invitational doubles event.
O'Brien marched his way through early rounds
of the singles draw before he crushed two of
UCLA's finest, Bill Behrens (6-2, 4-6, 6-2) and
Mark Knowles (6-4, 6-2), in the semis and finals.
Knowles pounded O'Brien last week in the Stan
ford-UCLA dual match, 6-2, 6-2, so this weekend's
final-round win over the tough Bruin was especial
ly sweet.
"Alex put in a really solid performance this
weekend," said head coach Dick Gould. "He
bounced back against a tough Bill Behrens."
With this title, O'Brien became the first player
since Stan Smith in 1966 and 1967 to win this
tournament two years in a row. He has also won
the Pac-10 Indoor Championships for the last two
years.
In doubles action, O'Brien notched up his sec
ond Pac-10 outdoor title in three years. As a sopho
more he teamed up with Yee to win the tourna
ment and this weekend he reclaimed the title with
Cocotos.
In the semifinals, they defeated teammates Rob

Devens and Michael Flanagan 7-6, 6-2 and then
rallied back to beat Arizona State's Peter Jeschke
and Ross Matheson 2-6, 6-0, 6-3.
The Invitational tournament was also heavily
laden with strong Stanford hitters. Yee, who plays
in the sixth spot for the Cardinal, dominated the

singles draw. In the semis, a big win over UCLA's
Fritz Bissell, who played No. 3 for the Bruins last
year, put the Stanford senior into the finals where
he rolled to victory.
"Jason played superbly," Gould said. "He had
an outstanding tournament. I'm very happy and
very proud of him."
Like O'Brien, Yee has a top record in this tour
nament. After winning the doubles title as a sopho
more, he reached the semis of the singles draw last
year.
The most satisfying win for the Cardinal proba
bly came in the Individual doubles finals where
Sydorak and Wright destroyed Arizona's Greg
Prudhomme and Rob Grant in straight sets. In a

dual match earlier in the season,
the Wildcat pair defeated the
Stanford players at third dou
bles, 6-2, 6-2.
"I am so darn happy for those
guys," Gould exclaimed. "This is
a real, real achievement for
"them. They got a chance to play,
struggled, and came through."
Both men have seen very lim
ited match play this season.
Before this title, they were 0-2

as a team.
In other matches, Devens
defeated the Sun Devils' top hit
ter, Ross Matheson in straight
sets before losing to Behrens.
Flanagan had "a tough, tough
match" with Knowles, according
to Gould.
He pushed UCLA's No. 1
player to three sets before being
edged out, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4.
Cocotos and Vimal Patel lost
in the second round to southern
ers Andras Lanyi of USC, 7-5, 6-
2, and David Nainkin of UCLA,
6-2, 6-2, respectively.

Now, the men are setting
their sights on a couple more
home dual matches this week.
No. 10 Pepperdine and unranked
Washington will challenge the
Cardinal Wednesday and Thurs
day.
"Pepperdine is a gigantic
match for us," Gould noted.
"They are a good scrappy team.
It is really important for us,
mentally and psychologically, to
keep the momentum going. This
weekend we re-established the
momentum but now we've got to
keep it up."
