# Women falter at Pac-10 Individuals
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior Staff Writer 
At the beginning of the season, convention
al wisdom said the Stanford women's tennis
team wouldn't win it's seventh-straight
national championship. With three All-Ameri
cans gone and an unproven squad, there was
no chance for another NCAA ring, said the
skeptics.
At first glance, results of the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships do nothing to refute
that claim. Flu-bitten Laxmi Poruri lost to
USC freshman Petra Schmitt in the semifinals
6-4, 6-0. Heather Willens exited in the second
round, courtesy of Alix Creek, Arizona's No. 3
player.
"She controlled the match. I wasn't playing
my best but she overpowered me," Willens
said. "It went three sets but I didn't feel like
the match was that even."
As both are backcourt players who chase
down a lot of shots, one strategy Willens could
have used was to mix up her shots and try to
get Creek off her rhythm. But the Wildcat

denied her that option.
"I wanted to slice and come in some but I
didn't feel enough in a groove to do that," Wil
lens said.
And when the Cardinal junior did make it to
net, Creek slammed a winner. "Just when you
think you have her off the court, she runs
down a shot and threads the needle. You think
'She can't do it again' and she does," Brennan
said. "Mentally, she was in a zone."
While the top two seeds were upset, Kylie
Johnson and Kristine Kurth were doing some
giant killing of their own. Johnson notched
one of the biggest victories in her college
career by knocking off California's Lisa
Albano 7-6, 6-4.
"She's been knocking at the door of the top
players for a while and now she's gotten
through that door," Brennan said. After the
second-round win, Johnson lost to Schmitt in
three sets.
Also notching a gratifying win was Kurth,
who was nursing a back injury for the last few
months. The threat of reinjuring it curbed her
normally aggressive, hard-hitting style. In

recent matches Kurth has been tentative â€”
and losing. But she bounced back this weekend
after receiving a clean bill of health.
"She's back to normal, serving hard and
running after balls instead of swinging at
them," Brennan said.
Kurth crushed Krista Amend, Arizona
State's top player, in straight sets before
falling to Creek, the eventual champion, in the
quarterfinals 6-3, 5-7, 7-5.
The play of Kurth and Johnson will be a
critical factor if Stanford is going to seven-peat
next month. "The pieces of the puzzle are
falling into place. We're just about ready,"
Brennan said.
In other Pac-10 results, Amy Chiminello,
Mario Carruth and Kelly Fisher lost in the
first round. Carruth and Fisher were in the
invitation tourney.
In the first round of doubles, Willens and
Poruri lost to USC's No. 3 tandem of Jen
Nguyen and Linda Allred. Chiminello and Car
ruth gave eventual finalists Pam Ciofll and
Meredith Geiger a tough match but the Ari
zona State pair pulled out a 6-4, 6-4 victory.
