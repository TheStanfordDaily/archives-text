couple of weeks ago, the issue of who
would add to Stanford's (then) three
national titles came up.
"Women's tennis can do it," said one, fol

positive hurumphs all around.
"And then there's men's tennis and volley

30-1 and were ranked first in the country,

arena of perennial powerhouse Nebraska.
To give some perspective, it would be like
