# Gym champions deserve more recognition
## 
### 
While talking to some varsity athletes a
couple of weeks ago, the issue of who
would add to Stanford's (then) three
national titles came up.
"Women's tennis can do it," said one, fol
lowed by acknowledging nods of the head and
positive hurumphs all around.
"And then there's men's tennis and volley
ball," said another, and we all agreed that
those teams could indeed win national titles.
Somebody then mentioned baseball, and that
was debated for a while without any consen
sus until the conversation hit a lull.
"Well," I offered, "don't forget the men's
gymnastics team."
The puzzled looks that ringed our little
group told me that my friends had indeed for
gotten the men's gymnastics team. At that

point in the season they were something like
30-1 and were ranked first in the country,
but were still unknown to even the most
ardent followers of Cardinal athletics. I
explained the facts of the matter to the ques
tioning crowd and after a round of "I-did-not

know-that", we continued on our conversa
tional way.
I should have felt pretty pleased for bring
ing insight to a group of supposed experts, but
I gave myself no such mental pat on the back.
I might have felt better about my revelation if
I hadn't learned about it only a few hours ear
lier.
I actually felt pretty stupid.
A lot of people should feel that way after
the display that coach Sadao Hamada's boys
put on in Lincoln, Neb. Not only did the Car
dinal win its first national title in a record
breaking fashion, but it did so in the home
arena of perennial powerhouse Nebraska.
To give some perspective, it would be like

playing Arizona for the national
basketball title in the dreaded
McKale Center, and then scor
ing 150 points on them.
Yet perspective is hard to
come by in a sport that receives
its greatest support only once
every Four years. The Olympics
show us a lot, but just how to
interpret a team score of 289.575
is not one of them. Which is why
most people I knew were pretty

excited that the men won the
NCAA without necessarily
appreciating the talent that got
them there.
Stanford is happy to garner
the extra bragging rights that
come with a fourth national title
in 34 days, but it is a topic that
finds conversation focusing more
on general Cardinal athletic
excellence than on specific team
performance. People love the
fact that a new banner will prob
ably hang in the Ford Center, yet
they will know very little about
how that flag came into being.

And I will be one of them.
I would feel bad if it weren't
for the fact that I know I'm not
alone. Stanford is certainly
proud of its gymnastic team, but
in America's athletic culture, if
you are not high profile you are
not much more than a sports
footnote.
It is as sad as it is true.
Thanks for a great year guys â€” I
just hope people rehi6lhb&f.

wishes he had gone to a gymnas
tics meet this year.
