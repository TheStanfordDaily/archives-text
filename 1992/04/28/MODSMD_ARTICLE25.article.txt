# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
In a week full of stellar athletic perfor
mances, two stars stand out greater than the
rest. One put his foot down as one of the best
young players in his sport, while the other
raised her level a notch when her team need
ed it most. Both athletes competed in the
NCAA Championships over the weekend,
and both achieved their goals. Jair Lynch
and Katie Clancy, of the men's and women's
gymnastics teams, respectively, are the Ath

letes of the Week.
Clancy, a freshman from Phoenix, Ariz.,
raised her scores this weekend at the
women's gymnastics nationals and helped
her team to a surprising tenth-place finish in
St. Paul, Minn. She averaged a 37.5 compos
ite score during the season and elevated her
performance an entire half-point to a solid
38 at nationals. This is an especially impres
sive jump in scoring because the judging at
the NCAA Championships is the strictest
the Cardinal has faced all year, said head
coach Breck Greenwood.
"She was over her average when it was crit
ical," Greenwood said. "She was a key for us."
Clancy came on in strong for Stanford in
surprising areas.
"Her best event was the one we were most
concerned about," Greenwood said. "She
scored a 9.6 on the vault, and her season
average had been a 9.3. To raise her score
three-tenths of a point with the tight scoring
at nationals is fantastic."

Lynch didn't surprise anyone this week
end at the men's gymnastics championships
in Lincoln, Neb., which is good. The only
way the junior could have shocked people
was if he performed below par, and he cer
tainly did not do that.
The Pacific 10 Conference Gymnast of
the Year scored a 59.025 out of a possible 60
points overall in the finals — that score was
not only the top mark of the championships,
but also quite possibly the highest score ever
recorded in collegiate gymnastics.

Despite having to perform in front of a
hostile crowd of over 5,000 Nebraska fans,
Lynch also tallied the top all-around score in
the preliminaries with a 58.50. Then in the
finals he really turned on the juice with two
9.9 sand two 9.95 sin the parallel bars, as
well as scores of 9.9 or better on the high bar
and pommel horse.
And to top it all off, the Stanford squad
won the national championship too.
