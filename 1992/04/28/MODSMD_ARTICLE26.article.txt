## 
### Nick Clements Staff writer 
The stars were out in
Philadelphia this weekend.
The Cardinal track and field
team sent seven athletes to the
prestigious Penn Relays and
placed four athletes in the top
ten in their events, setting the
stage for what should be a spir
ited meet this weekend at Cali
fornia.
Approximately 8500 ath
letes showed up to compete
over the course of the weekend,
including top world sprinters
Carl Lewis and Leroy Burrell
in the men's 4XIOO-meter
relay.
Chryste Gaines, this year's
NCAA indoor 55-meter dash
champion, won the 100-meter
dash handily as she set a per
sonal record in preliminary
rounds with a time of 11.17
seconds.
"She won what they call 'the
100-meter championship of
America,'" said Stanford assis
tant coach Scott Chisam, who
described the Penn Relays as
"non-stop action for three
days."
Gaines won the final round
in 11.0 seconds, but Chisam
said that since the round was
hand-timed and not electroni
cally timed, approximately .24
seconds had to be added.
Gaines will be looking to
break 11 seconds in the 100-
meter dash in the Olympic tri
als, which will be held in New
Orleans in June.
Jackie Edwards — who,
along with Gaines, led the
women to a second place finish
in the national indoor champi
onships in mid-March — took
fourth in the long jump with a
leap of 20'8.5".
The Penn Relays were the
first major long-jump compe
tition for Edwards since the
NCAA indoor champi
onships.
"Jackie Edwards may have
had her best long jump compe
tition of the year," Chisam
said. "To see her do what she
did in a meet that is very low

key for her is tremendous.
"99 percent of the long
jumpers in this country would
dream of jumping 20'9" . . .
that's the worst she's going to
do this year."
The women's 4XIOO-meter
relay team, which consists of?
Rhoxrdtr OiiverpiAK- Callieoat-i
te, Gaines, dnd Edwards; won
their race in a time of 46.50
seconds but needed a time of
46.01 seconds to make it to
the final round.
The women were looking
to hit the NCAA automatic
qualifying time of 44.75 sec
onds but will have to wait for
the California meet to try
again.
Among the three middle-dis
tance runners that were on
hand for the Cardinal, Dave
Scudamore stood out as he
placed sixth in the 10,000-
meters with a time of 29 min
utes, 21.03 seconds, which
qualifies him provisionally for
the NCAA championships in
June.
Fred Carter, running in' the
3000-meter steeplechase, nar
rowly missed the provisional
qualifying mark with a person
al best time of 8:54.45.
"Fred ran the best first mile
he's ever run in the
steeplechase," Chisam said.
Carter will probably have
three more opportunities to hit
the NCAA qualifying marks —
the Cal meet, the Pacific 10
Conference Championships,
and the Modesto Relays.
Gary Stolz took eighth in
the 5,000-meters with a time of
14:16.57.
"He could possibly be run
ning in the 10K at the Pac-10
Championships," Chisam said.
"He's been running step for
step with Scudamore in prac
tice."
Stolz will also be running
along with Carter in the
steeplechase at Berkeley this
weekend.
"He does it once a year and
he's thirty seconds better than
anyone at Cal, so we should
have a big edge in that event,"
Chisam said.

Scudamore stood out as he
placed sixth in the 10,000-
meters with a time of 29 min
utes, 21.03 seconds, which
qualifies him provisionally for
the NCAA championships in
June.
Fred Carter, running in' the
3000-meter steeplechase, nar
rowly missed the provisional
qualifying mark with a person
al best time of 8:54.45.
"Fred ran the best first mile
he's ever run in the
steeplechase," Chisam said.
Carter will probably have
three more opportunities to hit
the NCAA qualifying marks —
the Cal meet, the Pacific 10
Conference Championships,
and the Modesto Relays.
Gary Stolz took eighth in
the 5,000-meters with a time of
14:16.57.
"He could possibly be run
ning in the 10K at the Pac-10
Championships," Chisam said.
"He's been running step for
step with Scudamore in prac
tice."
Stolz will also be running
along with Carter in the
steeplechase at Berkeley this
weekend.
"He does it once a year and
he's thirty seconds better than
anyone at Cal, so we should
have a big edge in that event,"
Chisam said.
