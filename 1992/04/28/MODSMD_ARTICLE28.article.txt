# Working hard on playing in the majors
## Adams blows by batters as he looks toward a bright future 
### Ed Donovan Staff Writer 
Like Nolan Ryan, his hero, sopho
more Willie Adams has learned that
hard work lies at the foundation of suc
cess. In the process, he has emerged as
Stanford baseball's most reliable start
ing pitcher.
Adams began playing baseball when
he was seven years old and has been a
pitcher his entire career. His father dou
bled as his Little League coach and
spent hours catching for his son in the
backyard.
"He put in a lot of time," said Adams
of his father, "and now it's great
because he's retired and doesn't miss
any games. My parents just get in the
motor home and come up and watch."
Adams was drafted out of high school
by the Detroit Tigers in June, 1990, but
had no plans to turn professional at that
time. He briefly considered attending
Arizona before choosing Stanford.
Adams throws four pitches: a fast
ball, a breaking ball, a split-finger, and a
changeup. At six-foot-seven and two
hundred five pounds, he clearly has the
physical gifts to make it to the major
leagues. He feels that his success will
depend largely on his ability to improve
his fastball and his concentration.
Last summer, Adams stayed at Stan
ford and went to summer school.
Although he didn't play baseball, he
spent a lot of time in the weight room
and added three miles an hour to his
fastball.
In addition to the greater physical
maturity, his hiatus from the game pro
vided him with added focus for this sea
son.
"I took last summer off and I think
the break helped a lot," he said. "I feel a
lot more mature on the mound this
year."
Talk of Adams' improved fastball
inevitably led to a discussion of his
major league plans. When it comes to
his future, he has no doubts about
where he wants to be and how he plans

to get there.
This summer, for instance, Adams
has two options. In November, he tried
out for the Olympic team, and should
find out soon if he made it.
"It's tough to be optimistic because
there's so many good pitchers in the
country," he said of his chances. "It all
depends on their needs, but I have a
decent shot."

'It's tough to be opti
mistic because there's
so many good pitchers
in the country.'

If he's not playing in Barcelona,
Adams will play in the Cape Cod
League, summer home for many bud
ding college stars. He likes this idea
because the league uses only wooden
bats, just like the majors, and the games
are visited frequently by big-league
scouts.
Adams already plans to enter the
draft after his junior season. "I'll be eli
gible again next year," he said, "and I
feel that this is the right thing for me."
Although he will be foregoing his senior
season, Adams plans to eventually grad
uate with a major in psychology.
Although every step he takes seems
to have the major leagues in mind,
Adams has done everything in his power
to help the team win since joining Stan
ford.
Pitching coach "Colonel" Tom Dun
ton has been instrumental in teaching
Adams the art of pitching. Adams cred
its Dunton with his vast improvement
over the last two seasons, especially on
the mental aspects of his game.
"Once I was pitching against some
junior college and I gave up three

straight hits to load the bases," he said.
"Then I struck the next three guys out
and when I came into the dugout coach
Dunton told me that if I worked as hard
when I wasn't in trouble as when I was,
then I wouldn't get in so much trouble
in the first place."
The identical situation almost
occurred last Friday afternoon at
Sunken Diamond. Leading the Arizona
Wildcats 5-1, Adams loaded the bases on
two singles and a bunt that got past him
with nobody out. He struck out the next
two batters before his luck ran out and
he yielded a grand slam.
"I tried to get him up and in, but I left
the pitch out over the plate a little," he
said. "When he hit it I didn't think it
was gone."
Besides the grand slam in his last
start, Adams has suffered few lapses
lately. The tall, thin right hander carries
a 6-3 record and a 4.15 E.R.A. into his
next start Friday against UCLA. With
six conference games remaining, every
one has become crucial for the Cardi
nal's chances of making the NCAA tour
nament.
"I feel real good about the rest of the
year," he said. "We're playing good ball,
but things just didn't go our way against
Arizona. With the race so close, we're
just looking at how we're going to play
and ignoring everyone else. Hopefully
that's going to get us into the tourna
ment."
Although Adams and the rest of
Stanford baseball are concentrating on
their own role in the race to the Six-Pac
finish line, some interesting outside
news has tightened things up even
more.
The California Golden Bears swept
Arizona in a doubleheader yesterday,
bringing the top five teams all within
one game and making the rest of the
season more important.
Before the UCLA series begins, how
ever, Stanford travels to St. Mary's
today for a non-conference game. Brian
Sackinsky is scheduled to start for the
Cardinal.


A! Croon — Daiiy file
INTENSE. Willie Adams, ace pitcher for Stanford, fires another withering stare at an
unfortunate batter. Adams has been mowing down batters all season long for the Car
dinal.
