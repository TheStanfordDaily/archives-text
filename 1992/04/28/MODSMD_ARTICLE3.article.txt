Anonymous HIV-antibody
testing and peer counseling —
which had been scheduled to
begin earlier this quarter — will
now be available through Cowell
Student Health Center beginning
in mid-May, Cowell officials said.
"We're just really ironing out
the last details," said Carole
Pertofsky, director of Cowell's
Health Promotion Program.
Pertofsky said the delay in
starting the program was a result
of her late arrival — she began as
Health Promotion Program direc
tor a month ago — and the diffi

culty of setting training dates for
potential counselors.
"It surprised me how much
coordination it took," Pertofsky
said. "The process has been so
complex. Much more complex
than anybody thought."
Last weekend, 15 student volun
teers completed the intense three
day training program required by
the state of California for HIV
counselors, Pertofsky said. They
will be joined at Cowell by three
other students who have already
been trained.
"We're hoping students will
take advantage of this," Pertofsky
