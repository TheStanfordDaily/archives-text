# Anonymous HIV tests to begin in mid-May
## 
### Holly Hacker Senior staff writer 
Anonymous HIV-antibody
testing and peer counseling —
which had been scheduled to
begin earlier this quarter — will
now be available through Cowell
Student Health Center beginning
in mid-May, Cowell officials said.
"We're just really ironing out
the last details," said Carole
Pertofsky, director of Cowell's
Health Promotion Program.
Pertofsky said the delay in
starting the program was a result
of her late arrival — she began as
Health Promotion Program direc
tor a month ago — and the diffi

culty of setting training dates for
potential counselors.
"It surprised me how much
coordination it took," Pertofsky
said. "The process has been so
complex. Much more complex
than anybody thought."
Last weekend, 15 student volun
teers completed the intense three
day training program required by
the state of California for HIV
counselors, Pertofsky said. They
will be joined at Cowell by three
other students who have already
been trained.
"We're hoping students will
take advantage of this," Pertofsky
said. She noted that Cowell has
fielded about 60 phone calls in
recent weeks from people inquir
ing about anonymous testing and
continues to receive at least three
calls a day.
All HIV-antibody testing sites
in California must provide both
pre- and post-test counseling to
individuals seeking the test.
Currently, Cowell offers only
confidential testing, in which the
doctor administering the test
knows the student's name and
does the counseling. This method
allows Cowell to verify student
enrollment before testing.
Under anonymous testing, a
student will make an appoint
ment under a fictitious name
and meet with one of the peer
counselors before and after the
test.
Pertofsky said 37 students
applied to be counselors but some
dropped out because of schedul
ing conflicts.
"I don't think people realized

what a serious time commitment
(training) was," she said, adding
that some students could not
make the first training session
because it coincided with Easter
and Passover.
"It was an intense three days,"
Pertofsky said. "It was so wonder
ful to watch the growth that hap
pened."
The peer counselors will under
go further training led by employ
ees of Cowell and Counseling and
Psychological Services, Pertofsky
said.
They will also shadow the three
experienced counselors for a few
sessions before they start counsel
ing next fall.
According to Cowell Director
Harvey Weinstein, the idea for
anonymous testing evolved about
a year ago when a University task
force on gay, lesbian and bisexual
issues found that some students
didn't want to get tested at Cowell
because they felt uncomfortable
discussing personal issues with a
doctor.
Peer counselor Elizabeth
Trice, a sophomore, said, "I hope
[students] trust that we are here
to help and not to stigmatize."
