# Admissions office allows students to view records
## But Stanford's policy may still violate federal law 
### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
In an effort to comply with federal law, Dean of
Admissions James Montoya has adopted a policy
that allows students to read most of the comments
admissions officers wrote about their applications
— comments that may tell students why they got
into Stanford.
Students must request access to their records in
writing before May 7, or the documents will be
shredded with mounds of other "work cards" that
have accumulated in the admissions office base
ment over the past several years.
"Work cards" are page-long summaries admis
sions officers write about students' applications
and their teacher recommendations. Only work
cards of successful applicants have been kept.
The new policy may still violate the Family Edu
cational Rights Privacy Act, a 1974 law that grants

students access to their education records, on two
counts:
• It does not allow students and alumni to
review comments derived from their teacher rec
ommendations; and
• It only allows students and alumni to review
their records on campus, even if they do not live
within commuting distance.
The Department of Education, which is respon
sible for enforcing the act, requires schools to pro
vide students with copies of their records if failure
to do so would "effectively prevent" them from
exercising their right of access.
According to Mark Goodman, an attorney at the
Student Press Law Center in Washington, D.C.,
Stanford's policy does not give students who don't
live within commuting distance the "reasonable
access" to their records required by the law.
But Assoc. General Counsel Iris Brest, who has
advised Montoya on compliance
with FERPA, said she did not think
Stanford's policy was unlawful.
Still, she said, "We would proba
bly have to provide a copy" of the
work card to students or alumni
who don't live in the area.
Brest also defended the portion
of the policy that denies students
access to information taken from
teacher recommendations, saying
the act was not intended to give
students such access.
According to FERPA regula
tions, a school may deny students
access to these comments only if
they have voluntarily waived their
rights to the information. The
waiver must be in writing and
signed by the student, according to
the regulations.
Stanford's application has no
such waiver.
Brest, however, said she "cannot
believe there is any successful appli
cant" who would think he or she had
a right to see summaries of teacher
recommendations. "Successful
applicants are really quite bright."
Brest said applicants were
"party to an understanding that
these [documents] are not going to
be available to them."
A note "to the teacher" on Stan
ford's teacher reference form calls
the document "a confidential
report." There is no such qualifica
tion in a note "to the applicant" on
the same form.
Before 1975, Brest said, teacher
evaluations were assumed to be con
fidential as long as they were only
used to guide admissions officers.
Brest said the adoption of
FERPA wasn't intended to give
students access to "confidential"
teacher recommendations. Rather,
she said, it was to prevent damag
ing information from being used

against students.
"Law can and sometimes does
literally say things that it is inter
preted not to mean," she said.
Brest said students who are
"dissatisfied" with the way the
admissions office blocked out sum
marized teacher comments will
have to file a complaint with the
Department of Education.
She added that she didn't agree
with Montoya's decision to give
students access to reader com
ments at all.
Originally, Montoya rejected 22
students' requests to see their
records. The letter they sent to him
appears at right.
Most of the students are Daily
staff members who asked for their
work cards after they learned of a
ruling the Department of Educa
tion made against Harvard in
March 1991, after Harvard
refused to comply with an alum
nus' request to see his reader
comments.
Montoya changed his mind
when he learned of the Harvard
case. He said he had felt strongly
that "students should begin their
Stanford experience with clean
slates," and that viewing the work
cards as part of a student's perma
nent record would hinder that.
Brest, however, said she wasn't
familiar with Harvard's case.
Like Brest, Harvard's attorneys
argued that since the University
did not use these documents in
connection with students, FERPA
did not apply.
But Leßoy Rooker, director of
the Family Compliance Office at
the Department of Education,
rejected this argument.
Since the comments, like Stan
ford's work cards, are maintained
by Harvard, they were deemed'
"educational records" and students
therefore had access to them,
Rooker said.
Starting next year, the admis
sions office will shred work cards

Mr. James Montoya

Stanford University
Stanford, CA 94305
Dear Dean Montoya:
This is a request for access to education records, brought pursuant to the
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 U.S.C. 1232g).
I hereby request that Stanford University make the work card and reader
comments prepared in connection with my application to Stanford Universi
ty available for my inspection, review and duplication. t
The information in the boxes below should help you locate my records. In
the event that the work card has been transferred to an archive, I ask that
you retrieve it.
Please let me know where and when my application work card and related
comments will be available. If there are any questions about this request,
you may reach me at the number listed below.
Sincerely,

before students enroll in the Uni
versity, Montoya said. This is to
guarantee confidentiality to high
school teachers writing about their
students, he said.
The cards have been used in the
past to evaluate the admissions pro
cess, Montoya said. He said this
activity will have to take place in the

summer, before freshmen enroll.
Work cards exist for all under
graduate students who are current
ly enrolled, he said. Students who
request access will be permitted to
see their records from May 11 to
May 15 and by appointment. They
may not photocopy the work cards
or remove them from the office.
