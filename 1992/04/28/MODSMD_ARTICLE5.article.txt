### John Ford Staff writer 
A freshman sustained a serious
neck injury Saturday night while
diving into a temporary pool con
structed for a Phi Delta Theta
party. The student, who was
rushing the fraternity, is recover
ing at Stanford Hospital.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Heather Dunn said freshman
Joshua Maisel was injured in an
"exhibition dive" into the pool at
the fraternity's annual "Luau
Party," which was attended by
several Phi Delt rushees.

Dunn said the accident was an
isolated event and did not neces
sarily reflect poor management by
the Phi Delts. The fraternity's
president, Bryan Spaulding, said
Maisel has taken personal respon
sibility for the accident.
According to Spaulding, Maisel
walked unaided, accompanied by
friends, from the party to Stan
ford Hospital. He has been at
Stanford Hospital since Saturday
night. Hospital officials would not
comment on his condition yester
day.
Maisel is expected to leave the
hospital on Thursday at the earli

est, according to Jack Bo wen, a
fellow rushee. Bowen added that
neither he nor Maisel had been
drinking at the party.
Fraternity members are con
ducting an independent investiga
tion of the event and plan to sub
mit a report to Dunn today,
according to Spaulding. He added
that the Phi Delts acted quickly to
ensure a "good relationship with
the University" and to "keep
rumors to a minimum."
Alcohol was served at the party
but the fraternity adhered strictly
to the University's alcohol policy,
according to Spaulding. As long as
a party remains closed, the Phi
Delts can serve alcohol, he said.
Fraternity Rush policy forbids
serving alcohol at official Rush par
ties. The luau was "not theoretical
ly a Rush event," Spaulding said.
Dunn said she will meet today
with Asst. Director of Tresidder
Nanci Howe, who is a member of
the Greek Judicial Board, as well
as Phi Delt members and the Phi
Delt alumni adviser in order to
get "complete information" on
the incident.
Howe and Dunn will then
determine whether the case will
be taken to the board.
Howe said the first priority of
the fraternity and the University
is to provide support for the par
ents of the victim, who are com
ing to campus to visit their son.
Dunn expressed confidence in
the Phi Delts, saying she believes

the fraternity took "a great deal
of consideration" in planning the
event.
Spaulding said the "invitation
only" party was attended by Phi
Delt members, rushees and rush
hostesses. Party-goers were given
armbands after their names were
found on the guest list.
The fraternity hired security
guards from a company it "has
had good experience with,"
Spaulding said. He added that the
Phi Delts also hired bartenders
and lifeguards for the party.
The annual luau is held to give
rushees a feel for a typical party,
according to Spaulding. Senior
Reza Jarrahy, one of the Phi
Delts investigating the matter,
said the fraternity has no plans to
alter its pool-building tradition.
Maisel, who Spaulding
described as being "in good spir
its," has received several visitors
during his hospital stay. At one
point yesterday, eight students
waited in line to see him, going in
two by two to talk to their friend.
Maisel received a bid from the
Phi Delts yesterday.
