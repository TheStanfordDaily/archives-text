A freshman sustained a serious
neck injury Saturday night while
diving into a temporary pool con
structed for a Phi Delta Theta
party. The student, who was
rushing the fraternity, is recover
ing at Stanford Hospital.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Heather Dunn said freshman
Joshua Maisel was injured in an
"exhibition dive" into the pool at
the fraternity's annual "Luau
Party," which was attended by
several Phi Delt rushees.

Dunn said the accident was an
isolated event and did not neces
sarily reflect poor management by
the Phi Delts. The fraternity's
president, Bryan Spaulding, said
Maisel has taken personal respon
sibility for the accident.
According to Spaulding, Maisel
walked unaided, accompanied by
friends, from the party to Stan
ford Hospital. He has been at
Stanford Hospital since Saturday
night. Hospital officials would not
comment on his condition yester
day.
Maisel is expected to leave the
hospital on Thursday at the earli

est, according to Jack Bo wen, a
fellow rushee. Bowen added that
neither he nor Maisel had been
drinking at the party.
Fraternity members are con
ducting an independent investiga
tion of the event and plan to sub
mit a report to Dunn today,
according to Spaulding. He added
that the Phi Delts acted quickly to
ensure a "good relationship with
the University" and to "keep
rumors to a minimum."
Alcohol was served at the party
but the fraternity adhered strictly
