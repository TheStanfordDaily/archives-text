# Professor's studio 'not just a place to work'
## 
### Kristen Schmid Staff writer 
Light pours into the room from the ceil
ing-high windows that overlook Stanford
and its local area. The huge, abstract paint
ings on the walls seem a natural part of the
large and airy space.
One of the reasons the paintings seem to
fit their surroundings so well is that their
creator, Art Prof. Nathan Oliveira, was
inspired to paint them after watching rap
tors — birds of prey — circle the sky in the
foothills that encompass his studio.
Oliveira describes the studio as "not just a

place to come to work — it's ail environment
I've been drawing from."
He has been working in the space since it
was built by Stanford about three years ago,
along with the identical adjoining studio
used by Art Prof. David Hannah.
Oliveira's most recent project is a series of
large-scale abstract paintings based on the
idea of flight and the shape of the birds' wings,
Other paintings, such as one of the birds' sil
houettes, were also inspired by the raptors.
A stuffed bird of prey is poised in flight
near the window, a reminder of Oliveira's
area of focus.
The studio's construction represents the

fulfillment of one of the Art Department's
long-held dreams. For many years, the
department had brainstormed about its
ideal facilities — the size, quality and light
direction — but had never thought studios
would actually be built.
The opportunity for the realization of these
plans came when the University wanted to use
the Stanford Avenue site of Oliveira's previ
ous studio for faculty residences.
Officials asked Oliveira if he would trade
the site for a new space. He said his response
was, "Of course — if it would be the way [the

Art Department] wanted it."
Oliveira said he appreciates
the high quality of the facilities
that he is able to utilize at Stan
ford.
"Normally a university's stu
dios — if any — are makeshift,
lofts or basements. This is about
as good as any painting/art studio
can be," he said.
The University has discussed
building about five more studios
and has planned locations for
them, said Carolyn Lougee, senior
associate dean of humanities and
sciences. However, she said "addi
tional studios can only be built if
we find donors to fund them."
Lougee said the University is
currently looking for donors to
fund the project.
Oliveira said if these studios
are built, they will probably be
similar in layout and capacity to
the existing ones, which are
appropriate for large-scale paint
ings but are very flexible and can
be tailored to meet different
needs. They can be converted to
smaller rooms for graphic design
ers, photographers or graduate
students.
Other features of the existing
studios that will be incorporated
into those proposed new studios
include a shared storage space,
bathroom, and shower.
He added that building the
studios would be "not only a
recognition of art as qualified,
but also a recognition of the level
of performance of the faculty and
graduate students."
