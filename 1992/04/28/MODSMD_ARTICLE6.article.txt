was built by Stanford about three years ago,
along with the identical adjoining studio
used by Art Prof. David Hannah.
Oliveira's most recent project is a series of
large-scale abstract paintings based on the
idea of flight and the shape of the birds' wings,

ideal facilities — the size, quality and light
direction — but had never thought studios
would actually be built.
The opportunity for the realization of these
plans came when the University wanted to use
the Stanford Avenue site of Oliveira's previ

Officials asked Oliveira if he would trade
the site for a new space. He said his response
was, "Of course — if it would be the way [the
