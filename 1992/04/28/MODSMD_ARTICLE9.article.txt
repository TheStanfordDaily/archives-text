Officials jailed for sewer explosions
GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) — Authorities yesterday jailed
seven officials accused of negligent homicide for sewer explosions
that claimed at least 191 lives. Officials warned that the area
around a government oil storage facility was still dangerous.
The defendants appeared at a preliminary hearing at the state
prison outside the city. They stood in green prison jumpsuits as the
judge read charges including negligent homicide, causing damage
and injury to others, damage to public communications and viola
tion of federal environmental laws.
Arrested defendants are assumed guilty and must prove their
innocence. The judge said the average sentence for negligent
homicide is about five years.
Under Mexican law, those charged with homicide generally are
ineligible for bail. But one defense attorney told reporters that neg
ligent homicide is bailable, and said he will seek bail for the officials
— four from the local Pemex oil company and three from city water
and sewer departments.
Perot tied with Bush in California
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Ross Perot would run even with Pres
ident Bush in California if the general election were held today,
with Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton just behind, according to a Los
Angeles Times poll published today.
Perot, the Texas billionaire considering an independent presi
dential candidacy, was favored by 32 percent of respondents to
the Los Angeles Times poll. Bush received 33 percent and Clinton
26 percent, the survey found.
A majority of those polled disapproved of Bush's job performance,
and a plurality said Clinton, the Democratic front runner, lacks the
honesty and integrity to serve as president, the Times Poll found.
California's primary is June 2. The state's 54 electoral votes
are one fifth of those needed for an Electoral College mtyority in
the presidential election.
