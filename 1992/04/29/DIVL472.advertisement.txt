THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION has
recently ruled that comments written by admission officers In the selec
tion process are considered a part of the student's formal educational
record If they are retained by the school, even though they are not kept
with the student's file. (In the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at
Stanford University, these comments are written on "work cards.") The
University Intends to follow this ruling, although It was not directed at
Stanford. Therefore, enrolled undergraduates may view admissions
"work cards" currently on file In the Office of Undergraduate
Admissions.
All requests to view "work cards" must be In writing and received
by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions by Thursday, May 7, 1992.
Because we will need to remove comments taken from confidential let
ters of recommendation, appointments to view work cards will begin
the week of May 11. Only the "work cards" of students requesting to
view them before May 7, 1992 will remain on file. In the future, the
University will not retain work cards after the admissions process is
complete, nor will it keep past work cards that have not been requested
by May 7, 1992.
