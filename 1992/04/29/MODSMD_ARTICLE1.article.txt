No action will be taken
against the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity for a weekend
accident in which a fresh
man injured his neck diving
into their temporary pool,
according to Heather Dunn,
fraternal affairs advisor.
"As best as we can tell,
the party was exceptionally
well-managed," she said.
Unless Dunn, members of
the Interfraternity Council
or the University receive
new information, no further
investigation will be con
ducted, she added.
Dunn said that according
to eye witness accounts, the
injured student, freshman
Joshua Maisel, was not
drinking at the party.
Alcohol was allowed at
the party since it was not a
Rush event, Dunn said.
Rush events are regularly
scheduled between Mondays
and Thursdays, and the fra
ternities are allowed to hold
separate parties on Fridays
and Saturdays just as they
would at any other time of
the year.
According to Dunn, Maisel
did a "half-jump, half-dive"
into the 5-foot-deep, above
ground pool, despite the "no
diving" signs posted.
"He was having fun, and
apparently didn't realize the
danger," she said.
Though there has been a
pool at the annual luau in
past years, this is the first
time there has been an acci
dent, according to three-year
Phi Delt member Reza Jarrahy, a
member of the fraternity's inves
tigative committee on the acci
dent.
The Phi Delts presented a
report on the accident to Dunn
yesterday.
The fraternity has a policy of
reviewing all their parties to see
what could be improved, Jarrahy
said. This year's luau is being
reviewed more thoroughly
because of the accident, but no
decision has been made about

possible changes, he said.
"It's not a short procedure," he
said, adding that the fraternity is
focusing on supporting Maisel
and his family. Maisel received a
Phi Delt bid Monday.
"I've visited him, and he was in
good spirits," Jarrahy said.
Though Dunn has not spoken
with Maisel or a physician, she
said that according to her infor
mation, Maisel fractured a verte
brae but is doing fine and is
scheduled to be released tomor
row.
Hospital officials confirmed
that Maisel is currently in good
condition and his vital signs are
stable.
