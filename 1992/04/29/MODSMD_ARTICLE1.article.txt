No action will be taken
against the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity for a weekend
accident in which a fresh
man injured his neck diving
into their temporary pool,
according to Heather Dunn,
fraternal affairs advisor.
"As best as we can tell,
the party was exceptionally
well-managed," she said.
Unless Dunn, members of
the Interfraternity Council
or the University receive
new information, no further
investigation will be con
ducted, she added.
Dunn said that according
to eye witness accounts, the
injured student, freshman
Joshua Maisel, was not
drinking at the party.
Alcohol was allowed at
the party since it was not a
Rush event, Dunn said.
Rush events are regularly
scheduled between Mondays
and Thursdays, and the fra
ternities are allowed to hold
separate parties on Fridays
and Saturdays just as they
would at any other time of
the year.
According to Dunn, Maisel
did a "half-jump, half-dive"
into the 5-foot-deep, above
ground pool, despite the "no
diving" signs posted.
"He was having fun, and
apparently didn't realize the
danger," she said.
Though there has been a
pool at the annual luau in
past years, this is the first
time there has been an acci
dent, according to three-year
