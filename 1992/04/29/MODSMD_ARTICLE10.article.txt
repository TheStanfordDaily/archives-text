Anti-Thomas sentiment hits Pennsylvania
PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Lynn Yeakel, whose anger over the
Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings propelled her into Penn
sylvania's U.S. Senate race, won the Democratic nomination yes
terday and will face Sen. Arlen Specter in the fall.
Yeakel, who had never run for elective office before, defeated Lt.
Gov. Mark S. Singel in the Democratic primary. Specter, who played
a leading role in the Thomas hearings, easily won his Republican race.
"I think she is probably his worst nightmare as a candidate,"
Democratic National Committee Chairman Ron Brown said.
The key question in the Democratic race — and now in the Novem
ber election — was whether voters were angry enough about last fall's
Thomas hearings to vote for Yeakel. Exit polls suggested they were.
CNN reported that a majority of Democratic voters who were
questioned Tuesday for a network exit poll said they opposed
Thomas' confirmation, and Yeakel carried those voters by a 2-to-l
margin. She also ran strongly among women voters.
Former top HUD official indicted
WASHINGTON (AP) — Deborah Gore Dean, a onetime top
aide in the Department of Housing and Urban Development, was
indicted yesterday on charges of receiving an illegal gratuity and
making a false statement to a Senate committee.
Dean, who wielded considerable power as the executive assis
tant to former Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce, is a central fig
ure in the investigation of alleged influence-peddling at HUD dur
ing the Reagan administration.
A federal grand jury charged her in a two-count felony indict
ment with receiving $4,000 illegally in connection with a private
request for HUD funds.
She also was accused of filing a false statement with a Senate
committee in June 1987 related to her nomination to be an assis
tant HUD secretary. The nomination was never confirmed.
Dean denied the charges.
