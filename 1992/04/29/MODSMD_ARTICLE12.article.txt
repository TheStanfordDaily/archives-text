## Perot's bright ideas 
### 
Independent candidate
uses business acumen,
frankness to win votes

HE'S FED UP with the sys
tem. He's ready and willing
if asked. And with $100
million of his own, Ross Perot is a
presidential bargain. The other
candidates could benefit from lis
tening to some of his ideas.
Buying the White House?
Maybe, but the 2.5 Billion-Dollar
Man who now trails Bill Clinton by
only six percentage points swears
he's doing it for the people, and the
Texas businessman who puts eco
nomic crises in terms of a football
game is not making apologies for
his politics . . . yet.
An informal campaign tour of
talk-shows has brought Perot's
message to the entire viewing pub
lic. He supports gay rights, military
spending cuts, gun control and aid
to the new Russian Republics.
He opposes the S&L bailout,
social security for people who "don't
need it,"the Gulf War and deficit
spending. And if he gets elected
viewers at home can tell him what
they think about all that in an "elec
tronic town hall." No sound bites,
he promises, just straight talk.
As an unofficial candidate Perot
stayed clear of defending positions
and proposing solutions, but as his
support grows the critics are waiting.
"The best thing to be in Ameri
can politics today is famous and
totally unexamined," said a frus
trated Clinton last week about a no
longer-dismissable Perot. True, but
Perot's real assets are money and a
belief that the system needs change.
That's what most people think,
and Perot's attacks on partisan pol
itics, reluctance to take the "tough
est, dirtiest job in the world" and
promise to cut the deficit that
steals "your children's money"
make him the real outsider in a
field of professionals. Here comes
Ross to save us from Slick Willy.

Every day he looks more like the
candidate he says he'll be when
(and if) "all these everyday folks"
get him on each state's ballot. He
quit two private clubs with no
black members, he outplayed Jerry
Brown's $100 per donation trump
card (Perot will take five dollars
and send the rest back) and
attacked President Bush's record
with truly Clinton-like zeal.
The stands he takes are firm,
though the issues he hasn't
addressed yet are many. But if he
isn't bothered that he does not have
all the answers, the public doesn't
seem worried either. He is the only
candidate whose supporters out
number his detractors, and two
thirds of voters still have no opinion
about him and his message.
That message won't be in cam
paign speeches that pander to local
voters (and their wallets) at super
markets or union halls; his bold
tell-it-like-it-is platform will go
right into the dens of America
through the magic of television
and personal financing. What
could be more populist?
In the 1988 election Democrats
spent $106.5 million on the
Dukakis campaign, and the
Republicans spent $93.7 million
on a campaign that won. Perot is
stealing both the Democrats' pro
choice, cut defense, protect envi
ronment platform and the Repub
licans' voice of big business — and
still staying within the budget.
American presidential politics
needs a strong third candidate
voice. Perot proves many encour
aging things — unrepentant oppo
sition to the war does not make a
leader a wimp, criticism of social
services does not make a disgrun
tled tax-payer uncaring and not
being a party member does not
make a candidate unviable. Unfor
tunately, Perot also shows that
American politics has a price.
If he's elected he just might
prove that a rich businessman is
more qualified to run the country
than a politician. But if viewers
really are good voters, he also may
prove that straight talk works best.
