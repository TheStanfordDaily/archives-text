## The 						liability of listening less 
### 
1 FIRMLY BELIEVE that you can
learn more from one minute of listen
ing than you can from an hour of
speaking. Yet we continually perpetuate
our ignorance by failing to listen.
Children are wise. I, for example, was
a great listener as a child. In fact, I was
one large, brown, pudgy sensory recep
tor. Everything and everybody offered
me a new world of understanding. My
learning curve was steep. But, of course,
as I grew the slope declined. Some may
think it is because there was less to learn,
but I think it's because I've chosen to lis
ten less and speak more.
Why do we listen less? Well, for
starters, so many of us believe that what
we have to say is more important than
anyone else. I've witnessed the scene
quite often, and at times I've played the
part. Two friends pass with the standard,
"Hi, how are you doing," and instantly
the competition begins.
"Well I'm pretty stressed, I've got a
paper due tomorrow."
"Yeah, well I've got a paper due and a
midterm."
"Midterm! I've got two this week and
I've only gotten about five hours of sleep
in the last two days."
"Five hours of sleep! Well, I've only
had..
Make a statement! Make your point! Be
heard! These ideals pervade our every inter
action. We continuously wound ourselves

and others as we spew self-importance.
Anyone who has had the fortune of
having a friend to unload on knows the
value of a good ear, and any one who has
spoken to a daydreaming, eye-wandering
friend has experienced the subtle pain
and frustration of worthlessness.
The values of listening abound. For
example, I had to go to a pre-interview cock
tail party. In the days before the impending
shmoozarama, I struggled to think of ways
to make an impression on the interviewers.
A close friend gave me a precious piece of
advice, "Cory, its more important to be
interested than interesting."
Her words proved wise amongst the
interviewers. I found a wealth of new
information, and I made a couple of
friends who have lasted long past that
stilted environment.
Listen, ask questions and listen some
more: the most powerful formula for
helping others, helping oneself and devel
oping coalitions. Ask any counselor; some
of the most powerful tools they possess
are, "Uh huh, yes, go 0n...
Another reason I've found that I don't
listen is my instinctual defensive reac
tion. A friend of mine told me that read
ing about sexual assault made her feel
very uneasy about men. Instead of listen
ing to what she was saying or feeling, the
first thing to fly out of my mouth was,
"Well, you know all men aren't rapists."
Then there is dismissal. More and more

'As a child, I
was one large,
brown, pudgy
sensory recep
tor.'

I see people dismiss the comments of oth
ers because they see them as whiners,
extremists or simply biased individuals.
The Mommy phenomena evokes strong
dismissals. This is when people's comments
are dismissed because they seem to be deliv
ering just another lecture. I've actually fall
en victim to this phenomena as a columnist.
I overheard someone dismissing my last col
umn as minority politically correct garble
after only reading the first paragraph.
And what about arguments? Rarely
have I seen someone in an argument who
actually stopped spewing long enough to
hear what the other person was saying to
them. Every time I hear two people
argue, the veracity of an old saying rings
resoundingly in my mind, "Arguments
only confirm two peoples' opinions."
I am not unlike any other college stu
dent — I want to change the world. So
how can I make you listen to me? I could
raise my voice, shake my fist, or even
shake you — or maybe I could DO UNTO
OTHERS. . .
So many are unheard.

Cory greatly appreciates feedback he has
received and looks forward to listening to
more.
