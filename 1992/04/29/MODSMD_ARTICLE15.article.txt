Daily pieces inspire University to explain privacy policy

WE WRITE TO AMPLIFY the
philosophy and principles under
lying the University's relation
ship with students and their parents.
The March 11 Daily article titled
"Under the Influence" and the editorial
of April 3, titled "Keep it Confidential,"
which discussed the issue of whether or
not parents should be involved in solv
ing students' problems, have extended a
debate about confidentiality and ques
tioned Stanford's philosophy of main
taining that its primary relationship
lies with students and not their par
ents.
Clearly articulated beliefs and values,
and the need to comply with the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act, lie
behind the University's approach to foster
ing an educational campus environment.
A recent article titled "The Parent-
Student-University Relationship:
Issues and Principles" cites a few of
the beliefs and values that inform Uni
versity decisions about whether or not
parents will be contacted when prob-

lems occur:
1) Students are young adults capable of
managing their own affairs.
2) They are expected to be responsible
community members, to be held
accountable for their own behavior.
3) They should be trusted and afforded
privacy.
4) They should be allowed to make mis
takes, and helped to learn from both
their successes and their failures.
5) They should learn both within and
outside the classroom, in an environ
ment rich in diverse contacts, intellectu
al stimulation and opportunities to make
well-informed decisions.
Given these values and beliefs one
can see why the University's preeminent
relationship is with students. It does not
mean that when a difficult case arises
parents will never be asked to help a stu
dent. It does mean, however, that, if at
all possible the University will leave it to
the student to decide whether and when
to involve his or her parents.
More often than not, students, with

encouragement from the University, do
seek the guidance and support of their
parents or other close family members
when handling difficulty in their person
al and academic lives.
There are practical as well as philo
sophical reasons for leaving this decision
to students in virtually all instances. We
are simply are not in a position to assess
the nature or quality of the student-par
ent relationship, or to know whether
contacting the parent is likely to help or
harm the student's problem-solving
endeavor.
Parents occasionally call administra
tors to seek information about institu
tional policies, which we readily share,
or about their son or daughter, which we
rarely share without the student's per
mission.
In cases in which we believe a student
is unwilling or unable to care for him or
herself, right to privacy concerns may be
superseded by concerns for the student's
safety. A more broadly based response
may be needed that involves student

resources professionals such as the
dean's staff, counseling and psychologi
cal services, the student health center,
residence staff members, the police, the
student's adviser and the student's par
ents.
Given the conflicting values involved
in such a decision, we will err on the side
of safety and consider overriding privacy
concerns to try to help a student in clear
and urgent need of assistance.
In summary, the University does not
take lightly its commitment to students
and to giving them every opportunity to
handle their own problems.
In addition, we must do a good job of
helping parents understand our
approach to handling student privacy
issues — both to minimize confusion
and to encourage them to maintain posi
tive and open communication with their
sons and daughters.
