# All are responsible for environmental plight
## 
### 
This letter is in response to Mr.
Richard Holt's letter in Friday's Daily
claiming that his status as a vegetarian
makes him a true environmentalist,
while many of us in the Stanford com
munity, who consume meat, fish or
poultry, are hypocrites.
First of all, the vegetarian diet does
result in environmental damage. Defor
estation, soil erosion, loss of native
plants, pollution resulting from the use
of pesticides and fertilizers, waste emis
sions from farm equipment and the need
to package each product for distribution
are just a few of the many ways that
providing a plant-based diet negatively
affect the environment.

In regard to the thought that a vege
tarian diet is somehow more humane, as
any farmer will attest, millions of ani
mals and birds are killed, injured or dis
placed each year as the fields are plowed,
planted and harvested.
It is always easy to blame others with
a different philosophy for our collective
problems. If we choose to inhabit this
planet and live in the numbers and in
the style we currently enjoy, human
beings will deprive both animals and
plants of their "right to life."
Buildings and occupying a house
results in the displacement and death of
animals, destruction of plants and the
use of many resources; but shelter is
considered a basic right in our society.
We all share responsibility for the state
our environment is in.
