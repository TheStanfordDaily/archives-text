# Candidates need our support, not ridicule
## 
### 
Political cartooning can be fun, but
unlike the cartoon about Jerry Brown
in Monday's Daily, the most important
thing we have to do at home this year
is participate in our presidential elec
tion.
It is a time to support candidates who
are willing to voice their valuable opin
ions towards the multitude of problems
that our country is experiencing and to
examine the validity of the current
administration and the impact it has on
the rest of the world.
And what better way to do this than
to listen to what's being said.
Whether or not you agree with the
candidates' opinions, there is a whole fac

tion of people in this country who are not
represented by the "elitist" politicians
and corporate magnets whom we allow to
rule over us. Critical, life-threatening
issues are happening in your own back
yard (like East Palo Alto) and political
office holders are not going to discuss
them. Only candidates have that opportu
nity.
If you are someone who is being criti
cal of candidates like Jerry Brown, who
is literally sticking his neck out where it
can be chopped off in honor of human
suffering, look at the alternatives and
the cost of the consequences if we con
tinue to make "wrong decisions" for
"wrong causes" (like Desert Storm) and
start participating in your own destiny.
Register to vote, and listen to the can
didates.
