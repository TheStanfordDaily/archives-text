## 
### Kimberly Chrisman Editorial staff 
The winners of the ASSU
teaching awards, selected by stu
dents in the spring election, were
announced yesterday.
Recipients of the undergraduate
awards in the large-class category
were Timothy Taylor, economics;
Robert SapoLsky, biology; Herant
Katchadourian, human biology;
and Anne Fernald, psychology.
In the small-class group, awards

went to Biocca Dario, freshman
English; Richard Gillam, American
Studies; Anthea Waleson, Great
Works; Pradeep Dhillon. Europe
and the Americas; and Kazuko
Busbin, Asian Languages.
Dhillon and Busbin tied for the
fourth small-class award. Gillam,
who had been scheduled to lose
his job as a part of budget cute,
was renewed the day before vot
ing began as a result of an appeal
to former Provost James Rosse.
Graduate students chose Bar
bara Babcock, law; Dwight
Mishimura, engineering; and Jay
Fliegelman, English, as recipients
in the large-class category.
In the small-class group, gradu
ate awards went to Harry Elam,
drama; Jeffrey KosefT, civil engi
neering, and Kimberly Taylor, law.
According to ASSU Administra
tive Manager Sophia Shing, who
tabulated the votes, several under
graduate teachers who received
enough votes to win the awards
were ruled ineligible because they
received awards last year.
Civil Engineering Prof. Gilbert
Masters, Chemistry Prof. Paul
Wender and Assoc. Mathematics
Prof. Brian Osgood were all
denied awards in the large-class
categopr. Assoc. Art Prof. Jody
Maxmin and Spanish and Por
tugese Prof. Sylia Wynter were
ruled ineligible for awards in the
small-class group.
"The thinking was that we
should try to recognize as many
teachers as possible," said gradu
ate senator Doug Bone, who
helped create the awards last
year. "We assumed that good
teachers would continue to be
good teachers so we didn't have to
recognize them year after year."
However, teachers who received
honorable mentions last year were
eligible for teaching awards this
year. Sapolsky and Katchadourian
both received honorable mentions
in last year's election.
No honorable mentions were
awarded this year.
The announcement of the win
ners was delayed because "we had

to verify who was eligible," Shing
said. In addition, technical prob
lems made the tabulation of votes
per teacher difficult.
"People sometimes called them
by their last name or misspelled
their name by just one letter,"
Shing said. "It didn't add up in
the database and we had to count
them."
Shing said she also had to sep
arate the graduate and under
graduate winners herself.
The awards were created last
year to give students the opportu
nity to recognize excellence in
undergraduate teaching. All win
ners will receive a plaque recogniz
ing their achievement.
