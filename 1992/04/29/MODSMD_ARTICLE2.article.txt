Dhillon and Busbin tied for the

his job as a part of budget cute,
was renewed the day before vot

to former Provost James Rosse.

Fliegelman, English, as recipients
in the large-class category.
In the small-class group, gradu

neering, and Kimberly Taylor, law.
According to ASSU Administra
tive Manager Sophia Shing, who
tabulated the votes, several under
graduate teachers who received
enough votes to win the awards
were ruled ineligible because they
received awards last year.
Civil Engineering Prof. Gilbert

Wender and Assoc. Mathematics
Prof. Brian Osgood were all
denied awards in the large-class
categopr. Assoc. Art Prof. Jody
Maxmin and Spanish and Por
tugese Prof. Sylia Wynter were
ruled ineligible for awards in the
small-class group.
"The thinking was that we
should try to recognize as many
teachers as possible," said gradu
ate senator Doug Bone, who
helped create the awards last
