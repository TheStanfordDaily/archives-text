## Patel thrives on unorthodoxy 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Vimal Patel is not what you would
consider a conventional tennis player.
He's navigated his way through the
stormy seas of junior and collegiate ten
nis with a unique strategy and an unusu
al style.
Patel's journey began in Kentucky
when he was 10 years old. His father
picked up a racket one day and took the
kids down to the public park where they
would sit behind the fence and watch him
play. One day, Vimal and his brother and
sister decided they wanted to learn too,
so Mr. Patel bought a few books and
started teaching them the finer points of
tennis.
"We'd go down to the park and he'd
just feed me balls all day long," Patel
recalled. No fancy lessons, no private
coaches— just a kid and his dad and a
bucket of balls. By the time he was a
sophomore he had won the state high
school singles title and decided that Ken
tucky was just a bit too small. He packed
up and headed south to Haines City,
Florida where he played at the Rick Macci
Tennis Academy for a year and then the
local high school, where he won Florida's
state high school singles title in 1990.
"If I would've stayed in Kentucky I
wouldn't be here today," Patel said. Cur
rently, the sophomore plays third in the
Cardinal lineup— up two notches from
his starting position last year. This sea
son he has amassed an impressive 18-5
singles record and an 11-2 doubles record
with senior Jason Yee.
His success is due, in great part, to his
unusual, Jimmy Connors-like strokes.
While most of his teammates are hitting
topspin, Patel drives flat balls surprising
ly deep into the court with both his back
hand and forehand.
"The other guys fight alot more than I
do," Patel said. "My game allows me to
get away from that. The way I hit, the
ball penetrates deeper and sometimes I
get free points off of normal balls."
The trade-off, Patel feels, is consisten
cy. His coaches apparently think so too
because they have been re-shaping
Patel's game by adding more serve and

volley options.
"Vimal has made alot of progress this
year," head coach Dick Gould said. "He's
got a beautiful volley, he just needs to
learn when to use it. His game is very
close to making a big leap. He's going to
peak for NCAAs."

'His game is very close
to making a big leap.
He's going to peak for
NCAAs.'

This shift to an all-court game has not
happened easily for Patel. Having to
think about when to come to the net and
when to stay back has increased Patel's
hesitancy and weakened his confidence
at times.
"[Assistant coach John Whitlinger]
and Gould have been working hard on
my game. Right now, the biggest problem
is knowing when and where to hit," Patel
said. "It is more strategy than anything."
For most of the season, Patel's record
certainly did not reflect the frustrations
of revamping his game.
At 15-1, he was unstoppable. "I had
my confidence going then," he said.
"Once you get that mentality no one can
beat you." The soft-spoken sophomore
does not show much emotion on the
court. In the occasional event that he
does, Patel's intensity is often surprising.
"Sometimes you've got to kick yourself
and do something to get you going but

usually I try to put my intensity on the
ball," he explained.
Despite losing all three of his matches
against USC and UCLA two weeks ago,
Patel thinks his concentration is back on
track. "I didn't go into those matches
with the same mentality, I was a little out
of it. Those guys are going to make a few
more shots than other players would. I
needed to do a few more things right."
One player who is always mentally
unbeatable, according to Patel, is team
mate Alex O'Brien. The senior co-captain
has been a role model for Patel all year.
"Besides rarely losing, when he does he
always makes the other guy pay for it. He
competes so well," Patel said. "If every
one could compete as well as he does on
his bad days, we'd be the best team in the
nation."
And who is the best team in the
nation? National bragging rights could
be the Cardinal's in two short weeks. "It
takes alot of magic and alot of little
things— getting to balls you're not sup
posed to, making shots you shouldn't be
able to make— to win NCAAs," Patel
explained.
"We're definitely capable of winning
but we don't have the strongest team in
the nation right now. Even when we win,
not everyone is playing their best. So
hopefully we'll see something in the next
few dual matches that is different from
the rest of the season."
And with Patel, one never knows what
to expect. He's maneuvered his way up
the Cardinal lineup with a set of unprece
dented ground strokes, but this spring
the competition had better be on its best
defense. With a new strategy and a fresh
arsenal of serve and volley weapons,
Patel should be more unpredictable, and
more unstoppable, than ever before.

competes so well," Patel said. "If every
one could compete as well as he does on
his bad days, we'd be the best team in the
nation."
And who is the best team in the
nation? National bragging rights could
be the Cardinal's in two short weeks. "It
takes alot of magic and alot of little
things— getting to balls you're not sup
posed to, making shots you shouldn't be
able to make— to win NCAAs," Patel
explained.
"We're definitely capable of winning
but we don't have the strongest team in
the nation right now. Even when we win,
not everyone is playing their best. So
hopefully we'll see something in the next
few dual matches that is different from
the rest of the season."
And with Patel, one never knows what
to expect. He's maneuvered his way up
the Cardinal lineup with a set of unprece
dented ground strokes, but this spring
the competition had better be on its best
defense. With a new strategy and a fresh
arsenal of serve and volley weapons,
Patel should be more unpredictable, and
more unstoppable, than ever before.

While his power tennis doesn't quite do this to opposing players' rackets, sopho
more Vimal Patel has racked up an impressive 1992 record, moving from No. 6 to
No. 3 singles in the process.
Vimal Patel is not what you would
consider a conventional tennis player.
He's navigated his way through the
stormy seas of junior and collegiate ten
nis with a unique strategy and an unusu
al style.
Patel's journey began in Kentucky
when he was 10 years old. His father
picked up a racket one day and took the
kids down to the public park where they
would sit behind the fence and watch him
play. One day, Vimal and his brother and
sister decided they wanted to learn too,
so Mr. Patel bought a few books and
started teaching them the finer points of
tennis.
"We'd go down to the park and he'd
just feed me balls all day long," Patel
recalled. No fancy lessons, no private
coaches— just a kid and his dad and a
bucket of balls. By the time he was a
sophomore he had won the state high
school singles title and decided that Ken
tucky was just a bit too small. He packed
up and headed south to Haines City,
Florida where he played at the Rick Macci
Tennis Academy for a year and then the
local high school, where he won Florida's
state high school singles title in 1990.
"If I would've stayed in Kentucky I
wouldn't be here today," Patel said. Cur
rently, the sophomore plays third in the
Cardinal lineup— up two notches from
his starting position last year. This sea
son he has amassed an impressive 18-5
singles record and an 11-2 doubles record
with senior Jason Yee.
His success is due, in great part, to his
unusual, Jimmy Connors-like strokes.
While most of his teammates are hitting
topspin, Patel drives flat balls surprising
ly deep into the court with both his back
hand and forehand.
"The other guys fight alot more than I
do," Patel said. "My game allows me to
get away from that. The way I hit, the
ball penetrates deeper and sometimes I
get free points off of normal balls."
The trade-off, Patel feels, is consisten
cy. His coaches apparently think so too
because they have been re-shaping
Patel's game by adding more serve and

volley options.
"Vimal has made alot of progress this
year," head coach Dick Gould said. "He's
got a beautiful volley, he just needs to
learn when to use it. His game is very
close to making a big leap. He's going to
peak for NCAAs."

'His game is very close
to making a big leap.
He's going to peak for
NCAAs.'

This shift to an all-court game has not
happened easily for Patel. Having to
think about when to come to the net and
when to stay back has increased Patel's
hesitancy and weakened his confidence
at times.
"[Assistant coach John Whitlinger]
and Gould have been working hard on
my game. Right now, the biggest problem
is knowing when and where to hit," Patel
said. "It is more strategy than anything."
For most of the season, Patel's record
certainly did not reflect the frustrations
of revamping his game.
At 15-1, he was unstoppable. "I had
my confidence going then," he said.
"Once you get that mentality no one can
beat you." The soft-spoken sophomore
does not show much emotion on the
court. In the occasional event that he
does, Patel's intensity is often surprising.
"Sometimes you've got to kick yourself
and do something to get you going but

usually I try to put my intensity on the
ball," he explained.
Despite losing all three of his matches
against USC and UCLA two weeks ago,
Patel thinks his concentration is back on
track. "I didn't go into those matches
with the same mentality, I was a little out
of it. Those guys are going to make a few
more shots than other players would. I
needed to do a few more things right."
One player who is always mentally
unbeatable, according to Patel, is team
mate Alex O'Brien. The senior co-captain
has been a role model for Patel all year.
"Besides rarely losing, when he does he
always makes the other guy pay for it. He
competes so well," Patel said. "If every
one could compete as well as he does on
his bad days, we'd be the best team in the
nation."
