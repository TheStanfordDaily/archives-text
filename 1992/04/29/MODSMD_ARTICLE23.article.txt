# One student who won't dodge the draft
## 
### 
Like most seniors I don't really know what I'll do
with my post-Stanford life, so I've decided to
declare for the draft.
I'm not too picky, so any draft will do. Clearly the path
to the American power elite starts with the draft. Presi
dential candidates seek to dodge one draft, while promis
ing college athletes hope to be selected in another. Unfor
tunately, I haven't been selected in any draft yet and I'm
getting disenchanted with the whole process.
I've been checking my post office box three times a
day this quarter waiting to hear from the draft. But the
only sweepstake I've heard from is Ed McMahon's, and
even he said I was a loser.
The New York financial consulting draft, Teach for
America draft and Peace Corps draft have all passed and
I haven't got a single call. But this weekend I was unusu
ally upbeat as I camped by the telephone, waiting to hear
from National Football League Commissioner Paul
Tagluibue. I figured they were hiring 336 new bodies, so

I had a shot. I didn't even get a first-round interview.
Conversely, Stanford players Bob Whitfield (No. 8,
Atlanta) and Tommy Vardell (No. 9, Cleveland) were
chosen in the first round and will likely sign million dol
lar contracts. Wide receiver Chris Walsh (ninth round,
Green Bay) and tight end Turner Baur (tenth round,
New England) were selected on the second day and will
have a good shot at making the NFL.

The professional basketball and baseball drafts will be
held in the next few months, but I'm losing confidence
that I'll be among those selected. Junior outfielder Jef
frey Hammonds is projected as the top pick in the base
ball draft, while center Adam Keefe should go in the top
half of the first round in the NBA draft. Until today, my
name hasn't been mentioned once in any pre-draft spec
ulation. I'm going to fire my agent.
The draft process can be stressful, even for future mil
lionaires. First you have to find an agent who will put
you in touch with all the right people, get you free tickets
to concerts and create a slick media image and nickname
for you. Eventually, the agent will negotiate a contract
guaranteeing you peanut M&M's after every road game,
$10,000 for every obnoxious fan you drill with bubble
gum and an extra $500,000 for living half your year in a
town like Green Bay, Wisconsin.


Nat
Cousins


Addam Block — Daily
Super-agent Leigh Steinberg
hasn't returned my phone calls, but
when he does I'm certain he'll set me
up with a plush contract plus inno
vative endorsements. If the "Air
Nat" shoes don't sell, then I'm sure
the "Nattios" cereal or the "Nat
King Cousins" recording contract
will make me a superstar. Soon
everyone will have a Natty Bumpo
haircut just like me. Already, Stein
berg is busy suing the movie White
Men Named Nat Can't Jump.
You have to attend all the scout
ing combines, where players com
pete against each other in rigorous
standardized tests in front of scouts.
Your undergraduate grades don't
really matter if you can't score as
well as your peers on these contrived
on-the-field exams.
I've gone through all the tests
and sent resumes to all the top
teams. After much analysis, the
scouts compose a final scouting
report, filled with deceptively
encouraging scout terminologies.
"Dedicated liberal arts major

(flunked calculus and automotive
engineering), cool under pressure
(sleeps on the job), with fresh per
spective (no job experience) and good
speed for a man his size (big dork),"
my report reads. "Could be a promis
ing prospect player (didn't learn a
thing in college, so has to catch up in
real life)."
Of course, the biggest drama of
the draft is discovering where you
will play. If Houston selects Ham
monds with the first pick of the base
ball draft, he will face the
inescapable hell of the Houston
Astromorgue.
"Touchdown" Tommy Vardell —
clean-cut, hard-hitting, American,
Chevrolet, Bob Seger, steelworking
Budweiser choir boy — will fit in per
fectly at Cleveland. Likewise, bad boy
Bob Whitfield will be too legit to quit
for the irreverent Atlanta Falcons.
As for me, I'd go anywhere, but my
best offer so far is off the paternal free
agent wire. It's tough to negotiate in
Modesto, California when you're bar
gaining against your parents.
But who wants to get drafted any
way. I think I'll go to law school.

Nat Cousins is a senior, betting you
haven't been drafted either.
