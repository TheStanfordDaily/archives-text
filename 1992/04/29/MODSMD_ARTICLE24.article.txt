# Bonnie Baker: Clark Kent with oars?
## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
If you were to see her on the way
to your ME 101 class, you might mis
take her for an ordinary, mild-man
nered engineering student, looking
forward to graduation and a nice,
restful summer.
Of course, you'd have no idea that
on the water, Bonnie Baker is as
ferocious as they come. And her
summer looks to be anything but
restful.
Baker, the senior captain of the
Stanford women's crew team, has
not only led her team to an explosive
start, but is the latest in a line of
Olympic hopefuls from Stanford this
year. Between June 5-7, Baker will
be in New Jersey to compete in the
pairs division of the U.S. Olympic
Women's Rowing Trials. She and
her partner hope to earn themselves
a spot on the U.S. team and a trip to
Barcelona thus summer.
In addition to training for the
Olympic trials, Baker has also led the
Stanford women's crew team to an
explosive start this year. After a slow
beginning at the season opener in
San Diego, the Cardinal crushed UC-
DavLs, then traveled to Washington
D.C. where Stanford posted the
third—best time overall in the pres
tigious Potomac Championships,
beating national powerhouse Rad
cliffe and just missing Yale by 0.5
seconds.
But if you think she has let all
that success go to her head, you just
don't know Bonnie Baker.
"Bonnie is unique in that not only
is she an outstanding athlete, she's
the kindest person, too," women's
crew assistant head coach Christie
May said. "There's no edge of arro
gance in her like you might find with
other top athletes, and that makes
her a pleasure to work with."

Baker has been competing in
crew ever since ninth grade at Wind
sor High School in Boston. "I was
totally out of shape and unathletic
then," Baker said, "but they got me
into shape pretty quickly."
Baker enjoyed a high school
career that included trips to the U.S.
Junior Nationals from 1986 to 1988,
the Olympic Festival in 1986, and
competition in the Junior World
Championships in West Germany in
1987 and Italy in 1988.
Because of her success in high
school, Baker was heavily recruited
by some of the top women's crew
teams in the nation, including
Princeton, Dartmouth, Brown and
Cornell. But Bonnie's heart was set
on Stanford.
"Coming out here to visit the
campus was great," Baker said. "The
people were wonderful and Wendy
[Davis] was very supportive. I was
definitely the happiest here."
Stanford women's crew head
coach Wendy Davis considers the
match between Baker and Stanford
a good one: "She's so coachable. If I
tell her to take it easy because she's
injured, she listens."
Academics, a positive atmosphere
and weather good enough for daily
open water rowing were the things
that finally persuaded Baker to wear
the cardinal and white. But at first,
things were a little confusing for the
Boston native.
"I looked at our schedule and saw
all these teams I had never heard
of-UC-Davis, UC-Irvine, UCLA,"
Baker said. "I figured we'd beat
them easily—but then I learned."
Baker rowed on the novice team
before moving up to varsity in her
sophomore year. summer, she
went to the Pan American Games in
Cuba with the U.S. rowing team,

and this year she splits her time
between competing for the Cardinal
and training for the Olympic trials in
June.
"Doing both helps my rowing a
lot," Baker said. "In the pairs, it's
more finesse and feel, because there
are only two of you rowing. The four
(woman boat) and eight (woman
boat) are more power, and it's hard
er to get eveiyone with you."
Baker has a week off from compe
tition this week, and then the Cardi
nal faces California in the Big Row at
Redwood Shores in Redwood City, a
race which will decide second place in
the Pacific 10 Conference.

"I think everyone (on the team)
wants it pretty bad," Baker said.
"We'll be rowing at our home course,
so we hope to get lots of fan support."
Bonnie Baker is not only a team
leader for the Cardinal women's
crew, she is also well-liked by the rest
of the team. Davis said, "She's fun to
tease, because her face turns so red.
We will miss her when she goes."
Davis sums up her star athlete's
personality well: "I've never had any
one (on the team) who works as hard
and as aggressively as Bonnie. She's
like a Jennifer Azzi—she knows how
to win."
Bonnie Baker will probably turn
red if you tell her this. But she's not
too shy to send out one final message
to her team and her well-wishers
before May 9.

take her for an ordinary, mild-man
nered engineering student, looking
forward to graduation and a nice,
restful summer.
Of course, you'd have no idea that
on the water, Bonnie Baker is as
ferocious as they come. And her
summer looks to be anything but
restful.
Baker, the senior captain of the
Stanford women's crew team, has
not only led her team to an explosive
start, but is the latest in a line of
Olympic hopefuls from Stanford this
year. Between June 5-7, Baker will
be in New Jersey to compete in the
pairs division of the U.S. Olympic
Women's Rowing Trials. She and
her partner hope to earn themselves
a spot on the U.S. team and a trip to
Barcelona thus summer.
In addition to training for the
Olympic trials, Baker has also led the
Stanford women's crew team to an
explosive start this year. After a slow
beginning at the season opener in
San Diego, the Cardinal crushed UC-
DavLs, then traveled to Washington
D.C. where Stanford posted the
third—best time overall in the pres
tigious Potomac Championships,
beating national powerhouse Rad
cliffe and just missing Yale by 0.5
seconds.
But if you think she has let all
that success go to her head, you just
don't know Bonnie Baker.
"Bonnie is unique in that not only
is she an outstanding athlete, she's
the kindest person, too," women's
crew assistant head coach Christie
May said. "There's no edge of arro
gance in her like you might find with
other top athletes, and that makes
her a pleasure to work with."

Baker has been competing in
crew ever since ninth grade at Wind
sor High School in Boston. "I was
totally out of shape and unathletic
then," Baker said, "but they got me
into shape pretty quickly."
Baker enjoyed a high school
career that included trips to the U.S.
Junior Nationals from 1986 to 1988,
the Olympic Festival in 1986, and
competition in the Junior World
Championships in West Germany in
1987 and Italy in 1988.
Because of her success in high
school, Baker was heavily recruited
by some of the top women's crew
teams in the nation, including
Princeton, Dartmouth, Brown and
Cornell. But Bonnie's heart was set
on Stanford.
"Coming out here to visit the
campus was great," Baker said. "The
people were wonderful and Wendy
[Davis] was very supportive. I was
definitely the happiest here."
Stanford women's crew head
coach Wendy Davis considers the
match between Baker and Stanford
a good one: "She's so coachable. If I
tell her to take it easy because she's
injured, she listens."
Academics, a positive atmosphere
and weather good enough for daily
open water rowing were the things
that finally persuaded Baker to wear
the cardinal and white. But at first,
things were a little confusing for the
Boston native.
"I looked at our schedule and saw
all these teams I had never heard
of-UC-Davis, UC-Irvine, UCLA,"
Baker said. "I figured we'd beat
them easily—but then I learned."
Baker rowed on the novice team
before moving up to varsity in her
sophomore year. summer, she
went to the Pan American Games in
Cuba with the U.S. rowing team,

and this year she splits her time
between competing for the Cardinal
and training for the Olympic trials in
June.
"Doing both helps my rowing a
lot," Baker said. "In the pairs, it's
more finesse and feel, because there
are only two of you rowing. The four
(woman boat) and eight (woman
boat) are more power, and it's hard
er to get eveiyone with you."
Baker has a week off from compe
tition this week, and then the Cardi
nal faces California in the Big Row at
Redwood Shores in Redwood City, a
race which will decide second place in
the Pacific 10 Conference.

"I think everyone (on the team)
wants it pretty bad," Baker said.
"We'll be rowing at our home course,
so we hope to get lots of fan support."
Bonnie Baker is not only a team
leader for the Cardinal women's
crew, she is also well-liked by the rest
of the team. Davis said, "She's fun to
tease, because her face turns so red.
We will miss her when she goes."
Davis sums up her star athlete's
personality well: "I've never had any
one (on the team) who works as hard
and as aggressively as Bonnie. She's
like a Jennifer Azzi—she knows how
to win."
Bonnie Baker will probably turn
red if you tell her this. But she's not
too shy to send out one final message
to her team and her well-wishers
before May 9.
