# Baseball falls 4-3 to scrappy St. Mary's

Maybe it's just too much to
ask of a team that's in the
midst of a heated conference
race to play non-conference
games. Two days after drop
ping two of three very winnable
games to first-place Arizona,
the No. 10 Stafford baseball
team (28-19 overall) lost to a
very beatable St. Mary's squad,
4-3, in Moraga.
"I don't know how to
explain itâ€” they just took
advantage of their opportuni
ties," said Cardinal pitcher
Andrew Lorraine.
The loss in itself will not sig
nificantly affect Stanford's
postseason chances. Historical
ly, the top three teams in the
Pacific 10 Conference South
em Division have advanced to
the NCAA Tournament.
This, however, is small con
solation to Lorraine. The
sophomore, who began the sea
son as one of coach Mark Mar
quess's top relievers, has been
gradually subjugated to part
time status. Lorraine's start
yesterday was his first action
in almost two-and-a-half
weeks.
His performance against the
Gaels (20-27), while solid, was
as frustrating for the left
hander as the rest of his 1992
season. Lorraine, who was
cruising early, took a no-hitter
into the fourth inning.
Then, after St. Mary's Coiy
Wafer reached third on a hit,

stolen base, and a passed ball,
Lorraine mowed down Gael
designated hitter Chad Stark,
and went 0-2 on right fielder
Bill Hurvat, before Hurvat hit
a ball to deep short for an
infield single, driving in Wafer.
"It was a real tough game
for me," Lorraine said. "I
haven't been out there in a cou
ple of weeks, and I really felt
like I had pretty good stuff."
More importantly for the
Cardinal, the loss comes at a
time when the squad can ill
afford to slump. With two
weekend Six-Pac series
remaining, Stanford finds
itself in a three-way tie for
third place, a game behind co
leaders California and Arizona.
"I've never seen the Six-Pac
this tight before," Marquess
said. "I know it sounds crazy,
but I really think that the race
[for the conference title] will go
down to the last weekend."
And it probably will. With
Monday's sweep of Arizona by
Cal, the Six-Pac is VERY close.
The Bears and the Wildcats are
tied for first with Stanford,
UCLA, and Arizona State all
tied for second just one game
back.
To make things more inter
esting, Cal plays Arizona in
Tucson this weekend for a
three game series. It would be
most advantageous for Cal to
win two of three since Stanford
still has three games left
against Cal, but as coach will
