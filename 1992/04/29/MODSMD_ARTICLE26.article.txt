# Card women's lax readies for finals
## 
### Brian Egan Editorial staff 
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team continued its quest for the
California state collegiate cham
pionship this past weekend, tak
ing top honors in Qualifying
Tournament at St. Mary's Col
lege in Moraga to clinch a berth
in the California Final Four next
weekend.
The Cardinal (15-3-1 overall)
defeated Santa Clara 14-2 in the
semifinals, and won the event
with a 10-3 win over Cal State-
Chico.
Stanford attacker Christina
Wiellette led all scorers in the
tourney with nine goals, while
sophomore Betsy Bassis netted
seven goals.
Coach Julie Duff, however,
was more pleased with the even
ly-spread scoring that Stanford
showed in its two tournament
contestsx.
"The 24 goals that we scored
were spread amongst seven dif
ferent players," Duff said. "We
demonstrated a lot of depth in the
attack."
And while the 24 goals scored
by the Cardinal in the event were
impressive, the squad's defense
left nothing to be desired either.
Goalie Ally Knight saved 77 per
cent of her shots in the Santa
Clara game, and 80 percent
against Chico.
"Ally's stats (in the tourna
ment) are really impressive totals
for lacrosse," Duff said. "Last
weekend, she played the best that
she's played all year."
Senior co-captain Laura
Romeu led the Stanford long
sticks in the tourney, registering
six interceptions in the two

games.
Last weekend's play was vital,
as for the first time all season, the
Cardinal was forced to compete
without the services of first team
all-California Women's Lacrosse
League (CWLL) attacker Jessica
Bar.
The junior, who broke her col
larbone in the Western States
tournament April 11-12, has
been "a marked player all year,"
according to Duff.
However, the coach stressed
that Bar's absence may, in the
long run, have a positive effect on
the team.
"Jessica being out is definitely
a big loss to our team," Duff said.
"But what has happened lately is
great. We've gone from being a
team of individual players to a
real team."
This could prove to be impor
tant next weekend in Santa Bar
bara, where the Cardinal will face
its toughest competition of the
season at the California Final
Four.
CWLL champion UC-Davis
will be there, as will UC-Santa
Barbara and UC-San Diego, the
two top-ranked teams in south
ern California.
"I feel confident and excited
about the way we've been playing
lately," Duff said. "We're right
where we want to be for Santa
Barbara."
Stanford opens play in the
tournament by facing host UCSB
Saturday.

Also named to the All-CWLL
squad were Romeu, midfielder Jen
nifer Watts (first team) and senior
defender Sonya Rudenstine (second
team).
