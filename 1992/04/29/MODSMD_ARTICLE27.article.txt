# Sailing cruises to PCC victory
## Win gives squad berth in national championships 
### Brian Border 
The Stanford women's sailing team exceeded all
expectations this weekend by capturing first place
at the Pacific Coast Championships in San Diego.
By finishing so well, the Cardinal has achieved its
season long goal of qualifying for the upcoming
national championships.
Even coach Blake Middleton appeared some
what surprised by his team's successful perfor
mance.
"I've never seen them sail smarter," he said. "I
think other teams didn't think we would be any
more than just a contender, but we entered the
regatta with a relaxed attitude and hoping to have
some fun."
"Placing first was stunning."
The most impressive aspect of Stanford's win
was the substantial margin of victory they held
over their feisty opponents.
The Cardinal cruised past the second place team
from UC-San Diego, easily beating them by ten
points, and they also crushed tournament favorite
UC-Irvine by nineteen points.
Coach Middleton could not have been any more
pleased after witnessing such a dominating perfor

mance by his squad.
"As a team this was the best regatta that they've
ever sailed," he said, "and to win so comfortably
over our competition is outstanding."
While the Stanford squad might have made
their victory seem easy, they could not have
achieved such success without receiving spectacu
lar efforts from all five of the team members.
Skipper Haley King and her crew Kathy Akers
sailed solidly in the A division of the race to achieve
a second place finish overall. However, an even
more impressive performance was turned out by
the Cardinal in the B division.
Led by skipper Catherine Ivey and a combined
crew of Amy Lightner and Stacey Misakian, they
won five of their eight races en route to a first place
ranking in their division.
Although the women's sailing team will soon be
concentrating on doing well at the nationals, it
will be quite a while before they forget about how
much pleasure they received at last weekend's
regatta.
"We definitely sailed up to our potential, "Mis
akian said. "We performed really well due to our
positive attitude. It was really exciting and
rewarding."
