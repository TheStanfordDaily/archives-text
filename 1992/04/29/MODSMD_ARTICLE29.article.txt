## Scientists find traces of asteroid that killed dinosaurs Geologists who favored volcano theory 'silenced' by volume of recent evidence pointing to meteor calamity

Scientists are now almost unanimous in blaming a
giant asteroid for the demise of the dinosaurs and the
mass extinction of more than 90 percent of life on
Earth 65 million years ago.
But things weren't always so simple.
Up until about a year ago, a great rift divided the
geological community, with the asteroid theorists on
one side and the volcanists, those believing that a giant
volcanic eruption snuffed out life, on the other.
"There is a school of people who say it was a volcanic
event," said Stanley Margolis, a professor of oceanogra
phy and geochemistry at UC-Davis. "But there has
been so much evidence in the last couple of years that
they are gradually getting silenced."
In a lecture at this week's SLAC Colloquia, Margolis
told the story of the "Cretaceous calamity" like an old
"Columbo" episode — everyone knows who the culprit
is, the question is how to prove it.
The original evidence for the asteroid theory was
found in the sediments at the Cretaceous/Tertiary
boundary, the rock layer formed 65 million years ago.
The sediments show a high concentration of iridium,
an element that is rare on Earth but found in high lev
els in meteorites.
Iridium levels are high in sites all over the world dur
ing this time — "precisely at time of extinction," Mar
golis said
But high levels of iridium were not enough to con
vince the volcanists. They claimed volcanoes could pro
duce the same effect, since small amounts the element
have been detected oozing from the volcano on
Hawaii's Big Island.
Ideally, geologists supporting the asteroid theory
wanted to point to a crater as evidence of the hit. But
unlike the moon and Mars, whose surfaces are clearly
pocked by large craters, the Earth is relatively smooth.
This is because the Earth's atmosphere and weather
"work to subdue various impacts," Margolis explained.
Even worse, if the crater lay in the ocean, it could be
impossible to find. New ocean floor is constantly pro
duced in the mid ocean ridges, while old floor gets

sucked down into the mid ocean boundaries.
"Much of the ocean floor that existed 65 million
years ago has been subducted underneath the conti
nents," Margolis said. "If it's gone, that certainly
reduces your chances of finding it."
Still, for the past decade, pro-asteroid theory geolo
gists have been looking around for traces of a collision.
Geologists estimate through the damage that it
caused that the meteor that impacted Earth measured
ten kilometers in diameter, and a bolide of this size
would leave a 200 kilometer depression.
The perfect crater candidate must therefore be both
65 million years old and approximately 200 kilometers
in diameter.
A crater off the coast of Spain "didn't pan out"
because it was the wrong size, Margolis said. Another
crater in Russia seemed promising, but it was not the
right age.
"Until a year ago, we were at a loss for finding where
the crater was," Margolis said. And then they stumbled
upon Chicxulub, a 180-kilometer-wide ring-shaped
structure on the north coast of the Yucatan Peninsula.
Not only is the crater the right age and size, but
since the find asteroid theorists have found even more
conclusive evidence that an asteroid hit the earth at
Chicxulub.
Pieces of tektites, centimeter-sized bits of glass made
from droplets of molten rock, were found at Chicxulub.
These black glassy "jewels" are 65 million years old —
"the oldest glass ever found" and a major breakthrough
for the asteroid theorists, Margolis said.
The tektites found were very different from glass
that could produced by a volcano. Volcanic glass has
bubbles, vesicles and weathers into clay over time.
These tektites were still shiny.
Similar tektites were found in Haiti, and geologists
suspect they were formed in the same event.
In another indication of an impact, geologists found
shocked quartz at Chicxulub. Geologists suspect that
minerals such as quartz that did not melt at impact
would fracture. Shocked quartz has also been found in
the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary sediments in sites all
