# New airport security may foil terrorists
## Latest technology designed to be less intrusive, more effective, time efficient

Those comic book advertisements for X-rated X-ray eye
glasses are not necessarily false advertising, according to Dr.
Anthony Fainberg, a visiting researcher at Stanford's Cen
ter for International Security and Arms Control.
Although X-rays that peek underneath clothing are not
the optimal form of airport security technology, advances
have led to this as well as less intrusive methods of detecting
weapons and explosives.
"The original X-rays just show how dense things are,"
Fainberg said. However, more modern X-rays "look with
two different energies, two different beams at two different
directions," he added.
By checking a suspect parcel or bag from more than one
direction, the X-ray can tell if a weapon is hidden behind
something else. If an X-ray "sees" diagonally through a cor
ner of the parcel as well as straight ahead, the chances are
increased that object will be spotted, he added.
Some airports actually use CAT scans to inspect baggage,
although this method — usually reserved for studying the
brain — is very expensive.
"A CAT scan is the ultimate way to check because it does
multiple directions simultaneously," Fainberg explained.
In addition, these X-rays check for gases commonly used
in explosives with low atomic weight and high density.
Fainberg said that "very few other things look like that,"
that is, "1.3 to 1.6 times the density of water."
Vapor detection is another way to search for explosives.
A little vacuum sniffs in chemicals and performs a quick
chemical test on them to determine if they are questionable.
There are three different methods of vapor detection.
Two of these methods, gas chromotography and ion mobili

ty, are fundamentally similar in that they measure the speed
of the molecule being tested. For example, in gas chromo
tography, the faster a molecule moves through a tube, the
lighter it is and the more likely it is to be nitrogen, carbon or
hydrogen, elements commonly used in bombs.
A third method, mass spectrometry, works by bending an
ionized version of the gas into a circle in a magnetic field.
"Lighter molecules bend more and heavier ones bend less."
Metal detection also has been modernized to levels where
the size and shape of the object can register.
In spite of these advances, Fainberg said one possible
problem for the future is the potential advent of guns with
less metal in them. That is where research into new areas of
weapon detection becomes essential.
At a time when terrorist acts have paralyzed policy mak
ers and caused many would-be travellers to think twice
about visiting certain countries, the need for more effective
methods of prevention goes without saying.
Unfortunately, not enough is spent on preventive mea
sures. According to Fainberg, the United States only spends
$70 million a year in prevention as compared to the $10 bil
lion spent on the military. That equals out to less than 1 per
cent on terrorism.
Fainberg said that a 30 to 40 percent increase in funding
is necessary to help to generate better and more efficient
technology. Although without such increases, he said
"improved technology will be around in the next few years."
With X-rays that "see" beneath clothing and fairly popu
lar prevention techniques such as passenger profiling —
where people are stopped based on their gender, age and
demographic characteristics — issues such as privacy and
discrimination cannot be ignored.
"The aim is for it to be less intrusive, more effective and
not to snarl the operation," Fainberg added.
