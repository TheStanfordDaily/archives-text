# Cheek chafing often canker sore source
## Small ulcerations also caused by poor health, chronic stress, herpes, Bug says 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
: What causes canker sores? Do
11 these sores stem from lack of
Vjr certain nutrients? What is the
to prevent/cure them?
— Cantankerous sufferer
A: It would be fun to tell you that
canker sores are the result of a
degenerate lifestyle — the
inevitable price of living in a culture
rife with dissipation, libertine behavior,
and of putting your mouth where
you're not supposed to. Unfortunately,
that would be a lie.
Canker sores are small ulcerations, or
breaches, that occur on the skin of the
lips or in the mucosal lining of the mouth.
They are small, usually round, and bor
dered with bright red inflamed tissue.
Some bleed, and if you're really, really
lucky, yours will ooze a whitish pus.
Although cankers usually heal with
out scarring, they are difficult to get rid
of because they are constantly being
reopened by everyday stretching of the
mouth and lips. This repeated aggrava
tion of the affected tissues slows heal
ing and enlarges the ulcerations.
The sores arise from a multitude of
causes, most commonly from local irri
tation of the cheek. Appropriate irrita
tion might be provided by scraping
against a jagged tooth, rubbing against
ill-fitting braces or compulsive sticking
of a rusty carrot peeler into the recess
es of one's oral cavity.
In other cases, canker sores have
more subtle causes For example, they
can be associated with the low overall
health that coincides with or follows a
systemic infection.

Sufferers of chronic stress are also
prone to cankers. If your episodes of
sores are associated with acute insom
nia, bouts of sweating, or impotence —
or if the sores accompany exam-related
anxiety, MCAT preparation or the sud
den, unexpected end of what you
thought was a beautiful relationship —
then this could be you.
A few cases of canker sores —
though by no means all, despite the
conventional wisdom on the subject
(HA! now there's a contradiction in
terms) — owe their baneful existence to
herpes simplex virus. Herpetic cankers,
in contrast to the noninfectious flavor,
tend to occur more often on the lips
than inside the mouth itself. They
begin as "vesicles" — fluid-filled, spher
ical sacs that feel like unusually painful
pimples — which burst to produce can
kerous ulcerations
(It is through the resulting openings
in the skin, tailed "fever blisters" or
"cold sores," that the herpes virus is

propagated from person to person.)
Nutritional deficiencies have little
to do with cases of canker sores in
adults. In children, however, a special
type of cheek ulcers can develop as a
result of chronic malnutrition. These
cankers are often very painful and are
associated with increased salivary flow
(read "drooling") and foul breath.
If left untended, these sores can
progress to a gangrenous condition
that can destroy much of the cheek.
Such severe cankers, called cancrum
oris by tight-sphinctered, old-school
medical types for whom the English
words "mouth canker" don't have
enough of that ominous Latin feel,
are caused by the growth of voracious
bacteria in the lining of the cheek.
The medical establishment, to
which I just alluded with such heart
felt affection, has no general treat
ment to offer sufferers of canker
sores. There do exist several over-the
counter remedies, although none of
the manufacturers paid me enough to
mention their product by name.
If, however, your cankers are the
byproducts of some other ailment,
whether it be the sharp edge of a
crooked molar or a deeper malady like
stress, treating the original condition
might be the best way to get rid of your
sores.
Admittedly, this is easier with bad
braces than high anxiety, but I never
promised you a perfect world.

(It is through the resulting openings
in the skin, tailed "fever blisters" or
"cold sores," that the herpes virus is

propagated from person to person.)
Nutritional deficiencies have little
to do with cases of canker sores in
adults. In children, however, a special
type of cheek ulcers can develop as a
result of chronic malnutrition. These
cankers are often very painful and are
associated with increased salivary flow
(read "drooling") and foul breath.
If left untended, these sores can
progress to a gangrenous condition
that can destroy much of the cheek.
Such severe cankers, called cancrum
oris by tight-sphinctered, old-school
medical types for whom the English
words "mouth canker" don't have
enough of that ominous Latin feel,
are caused by the growth of voracious
bacteria in the lining of the cheek.
The medical establishment, to
which I just alluded with such heart
felt affection, has no general treat
ment to offer sufferers of canker
sores. There do exist several over-the
counter remedies, although none of
the manufacturers paid me enough to
mention their product by name.
If, however, your cankers are the
byproducts of some other ailment,
whether it be the sharp edge of a
crooked molar or a deeper malady like
stress, treating the original condition
might be the best way to get rid of your
sores.
Admittedly, this is easier with bad
braces than high anxiety, but I never
promised you a perfect world.
