# Alfalfa's secret
## Prof explores relationship between legume, bacteria 
### Aaron Thode Staff writer 
Within the well-equipped laboratories
of the Gilbert Biosciences Building, Biolo
gy Prof. Sharon Long is unraveling the
secrets of one of the moat important sym
biotic relationships on earth — that
between legume plants and Rhyzobium
bacteria.
In the process, she has earned two
patents and developed products that may
indirectly reduce our nation's oil con
sumption.
While most plants need fertilizer to pro
vide them with nitrogen for growth,
legumes such as alfalfa produce nodules, or
small bumps, on their roots that house and
nourish the bacteria. The bacteria in turn
convert nitrogen gas into ammonia, which
the plant then uses to make proteins.
This "nitrogen-fixation" ability allows
legumes to survive in nitrogen-limited
environments like deserts. Indeed,
legumes like mesquite are often the first
plants to establish an anchor in a new
environment, preparing the soil for the
arrival of other plants.

Over the years Long and her
associates have been decoding the
series of complex chemical commu-

nication that takes
place between alfal
fa and Rhysobium.
Alfalfa roots send
out a chemical mes
sage that triggers
outside bacteria
to produce what
are known as
"nodulation fac
tors" — chemicals
that, when
applied to an
alfalfa root, cause
its cells to form
nodules.

In 1986, Long's
team identified the
chemical luteolin
as the initial step i
of the sequence.
When combined

with an enzyme dubbed NodD, lute
olin activates the Rhyzobium genes,
which in turn produce the enzymes that
create nodulation factors like

Nodßm IV.
Although humans have
used luteolin for centuries

(the Romans dyed their togas yel
low with it), Long was apparently

the first to suggest coating alfalfa seeds
with it — an idea for which she received
her first patent.
But Long's group has gone further.
They have also identified and isolated the
NodD and Nodßm IV factors. They
turned out to have rather unusual struc
tures. "No one has ever seen molecules
like these before," Long said, holding up a
diagram of Nodßm IV. Placing a drop of
NodD solution on an alfalfa root stimu
lates nodulation, and thus increases the
ability of the root to fix nitrogen.
Other applications have emerged from
her research. At the request of researchers
at the University of California at Davis,
Long devised a test to measure a particu
lar alfalfa breed's fixation efficiency.
"The ability to produce nodulation fac

tors may be the limiting step" in nitrogen
fixation, she said.
Through the use of recombinant DNA
techniques, her team replaced one of Rhy
zobium's nodulation-encoding genes with
a special gene from another bacteria, E.
Coll. This gene encodes the sequence for
beta galactosidose, which breaks down
certain complex sugars into simple sugars.
When one particular galactose-ring
sugar compound is decomposed, the solu
tion turns blue. Thus by comparing the
amount of blue in a solution containing
samples of different alfalfa breeds, one can
then evaluate which breed is most effi
cient at signaling Rhyzobium.
The Davis group discovered that the
test could indeed pinpoint the most pro
ductive breeds in a random sample. In
addition, the test can be performed on ger
minating seeds.

"Now they don't have to wait three
months" for the plants to grow before
evaluating their efficiency, Long said.
If applied commercially, Long's find
ings could prove valuable because they
would enable farmers to achieve the same
yield with less fertilizer.

Currently, a very energy-intensive pro
cess is used in making the ammonia used
in artificial fertilizer. So any technique
that increases the nitrogen-fixation
efficiency of plants translates into less
energy consumption.

The point is not lost on
the Department of Energy,
which funds roughly half of

Long's research. "There
are much better things to
do with petroleum than to
burn it," Long said.

Long is one of
many scientists who
are unleashing quiet
revolutions in the
way our society pro
duces materials.
A scientist in

Oregon discovered the
process by which a cer
tain fungus breaks down
lignin, the material that
makes wood hard.

In the
paper-making
industry, a
great deal of

sulfuric acid is
required to remove

112 lignin, resulting in a hazardous
mess. This new discovery may
revolutionize the way the paper
industry works.

People are making amazing dis
coveries, "once they just look at the

basic biology of how
things work in nature,"
Long said.

Currently, Long
and her associates are look
ing into identifying the pre
cise mechanism by which

the nodulation factors are pro
duced, and how they stimulate the
alfalfa roots' cells.
She relishes the prospects of her
field. "I get to work on amazingly
diverse organisms," she said, "and I
am always astonished by what oth
ers are doing when I go to confer
ences."
