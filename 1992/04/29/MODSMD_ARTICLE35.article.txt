# More students consider using Norplant birth-control device
##

"Look, that's all you can see,"
the Stanford student said, holding
out her arm and pointing to the
area where Norplant — a match
stick-shaped birth control device
— had been implanted a few
months ago.
Except for a tiny discoloration,
nothing was visible. "I usually
scar heavily, but you can't see any
thing," she said. Other than tiny
ridges that can be felt beneath the
skin, nothing indicates the pres
ence of the contraceptive.
As Norplant becomes more
publicized, it is in greater demand
among Stanford students, said
Susan Hasse, a nurse practitioner
at Cowell Student Health Center.
She noted that more Stanford
students have been asking about
it recently, although she doesn't
know the exact number. "We're
getting many more questions, and
many students are considering
it," she said. "How many follow
through and get it, I don't know."
Norplant consists of six capsules,

each the size of a match, that con
tain a synthetic hormone called lev
onorgestrel. The capsules release a
low, continuous dose of the hor
mone into the body for five years.
Levonorgestrel prevents con
ception by thickening the cervical
mucus and making the uterine
lining "hostile" to a fertilized egg.
At present, Cowell does not
provide Norplant, but refers stu
dents to Women's Health Obstet
rics and Gynecology, the Stanford
Clinic or Planned Parenthood.
The procedure costs about $500.
Cowell Associate Director Jane
Meier explained, "Norplant falls out
of the realm of what student insur
ance covers. We will cover consulta
tions here to discuss the pros and
cons of Norplant, and for those who
are interested we'll refer them."
She added that the insertion of
Norplant constitutes a surgery,
which Cowell does not now perform.
She pointed out that with the
"big financial crunch," it is
unlikely that Cowell would add a
service when it is in the process of
cutting back on current services.

Meier said based on her obser
vations of people who ask ques
tions at Cowell, her impression is
that most of the Stanford students
who get Norplant are first and sec
ond-year graduate students.
Because these students tend to

have more long-term relation
ships, she said they would use
Norplant because they "seem con
vinced that they don't want chil
dren when they're in school."
Its failure rate is about 0.2 per
cent, and only male sterilization

has greater effectiveness. Other
forms of contraception, such as
condoms or the pill, are less effec
tive — condoms with spermicide
fail 2 percent of the time, and the
pill has a 1 percent failure rate.
She said she had previously
used the birth control pill, which,
as opposed to Norplant, has high
er doses of hormones and can
have stronger side effects:
The process of having Norplant
inserted is simple and takes oniy
about 25 minutes. After giving the
woman a local anesthetic, the doc
tor makes a small incision in the
upper arm and inserts the phylas
tic — a soft, flexible material —
tubes in a fanlike pattern.
Although the arm is tender for
the next three days, the sensitivi
ty fades.
Side effects, although rare,
include irregularities in the men
strual cycle and headaches.
The Stanford student said she
has experienced some irregulari
ties in her cycle, and she does not
have menstrual cramps anymore.
Norplant is removed after five

years, or at any time the woman
wishes.
The procedure is slightly more
difficult than the insertion because
fibrous tissue attaches to the
implant, according to Donna
Briscoll, a staff member at
Women's Health and Obstetrics on
University Ave.
To remove Norplant, another
small incision is made and the
implants are surgically extracted.
Briscoll said most women who
undergo the implantation proce
dure are well-educated and desire a
safe, effective form of contraception.
Norplant is "good for someone
who is young and wants to post
pone starting a family," she said.
"It has the convenience of not
having to think about it."
The student with Norplant
agreed that convenience was one
of the reasons she had it implant
ed, but she also realized that this
convenience could be hazardous.
"Norplant doesn't protect
against STDs. I think that it could
discourage a male from using a
condom," she said.

ence of the contraceptive.
As Norplant becomes more
publicized, it is in greater demand
among Stanford students, said
Susan Hasse, a nurse practitioner
at Cowell Student Health Center.
She noted that more Stanford
students have been asking about
it recently, although she doesn't
know the exact number. "We're
getting many more questions, and
many students are considering
it," she said. "How many follow
through and get it, I don't know."
Norplant consists of six capsules,

each the size of a match, that con
tain a synthetic hormone called lev
onorgestrel. The capsules release a
low, continuous dose of the hor
mone into the body for five years.
Levonorgestrel prevents con
ception by thickening the cervical
mucus and making the uterine
lining "hostile" to a fertilized egg.
At present, Cowell does not
provide Norplant, but refers stu
dents to Women's Health Obstet
rics and Gynecology, the Stanford
Clinic or Planned Parenthood.
The procedure costs about $500.
Cowell Associate Director Jane
Meier explained, "Norplant falls out
of the realm of what student insur
ance covers. We will cover consulta
tions here to discuss the pros and
cons of Norplant, and for those who
are interested we'll refer them."
She added that the insertion of
Norplant constitutes a surgery,
which Cowell does not now perform.
She pointed out that with the
"big financial crunch," it is
unlikely that Cowell would add a
service when it is in the process of
cutting back on current services.

Meier said based on her obser
vations of people who ask ques
tions at Cowell, her impression is
that most of the Stanford students
who get Norplant are first and sec
ond-year graduate students.
Because these students tend to

have more long-term relation
ships, she said they would use
Norplant because they "seem con
vinced that they don't want chil
dren when they're in school."
Its failure rate is about 0.2 per
cent, and only male sterilization

has greater effectiveness. Other
forms of contraception, such as
condoms or the pill, are less effec
tive — condoms with spermicide
fail 2 percent of the time, and the
pill has a 1 percent failure rate.
She said she had previously
used the birth control pill, which,
as opposed to Norplant, has high
er doses of hormones and can
have stronger side effects:
The process of having Norplant
inserted is simple and takes oniy
about 25 minutes. After giving the
woman a local anesthetic, the doc
tor makes a small incision in the
upper arm and inserts the phylas
tic — a soft, flexible material —
tubes in a fanlike pattern.
Although the arm is tender for
the next three days, the sensitivi
ty fades.
Side effects, although rare,
include irregularities in the men
strual cycle and headaches.
The Stanford student said she
has experienced some irregulari
ties in her cycle, and she does not
have menstrual cramps anymore.
Norplant is removed after five

years, or at any time the woman
wishes.
The procedure is slightly more
difficult than the insertion because
fibrous tissue attaches to the
implant, according to Donna
Briscoll, a staff member at
Women's Health and Obstetrics on
University Ave.
To remove Norplant, another
small incision is made and the
implants are surgically extracted.
Briscoll said most women who
undergo the implantation proce
dure are well-educated and desire a
safe, effective form of contraception.
Norplant is "good for someone
who is young and wants to post
pone starting a family," she said.
"It has the convenience of not
having to think about it."
The student with Norplant
agreed that convenience was one
of the reasons she had it implant
ed, but she also realized that this
convenience could be hazardous.
"Norplant doesn't protect
against STDs. I think that it could
discourage a male from using a
condom," she said.
