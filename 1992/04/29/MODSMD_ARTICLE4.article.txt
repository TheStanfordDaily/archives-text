# 1,500 more tickets offered for Gorbachev talk
## 
### Julia Sobrevilla Editorial staff 
An extra 1,500 tickets have been added for
former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's
May 9 speech in Frost Amphitheater.
Administrators said they were not prepared
for the original demand and were taken aback
when the 7,000 available tickets were gone in
four hours last week.
"We were all quite surprised at how quickly
existing tickets were snapped up," said Provost
Gerald Lieberman. "We put our heads togeth
er to see what we could do to get more tickets."
"We were told that one way of doing this was
putting in more seats at Frost Amphitheater,
and that 1,500 wouldn't crowd it,"he said.
University President Donald Kennedy
decided Monday to offer more tickets to stu

dents, faculty and staff to attend the speech,
said Vice President for Public Affairs Robert
Freelen.
"The president decided he would get the
money for more chairs and do it," Freelen
said.
The $3,500 additional cost — for the chairs
and extra ticket office hours — will be
assumed by the president's office, said Direc
tor of Events and Services Lois Wagner.
Although the number of people attending
the event will increase to 10,500, security mea
sures will not have to be changed drastically,
according to Freelen.
Security for the event will be provided by
the Stanford police, who will also work with
federal security through the State Depart
ment, he said.
"(Chief of Police) Marv Herrington felt

comfortable with the additional 1,500,"
Lieberman said.
The additional tickets will be distributed
through a lottery and limited to one per per
son, according to a University statement. Pre
viously, two tickets were issued per person.
Sign-ups for the lottery will be held in the
Inner Quad on Thursday and Friday from
11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and from 4:30 to 6 p.m.
Interested parties must sign up in person.
The drawing will be held on Tuesday, May 5.
Results will be printed in The Daily, and win
ners must pick up their tickets between 10 a.m.
to 5 p.m. at the Tresidder ticket office on May 8.
Wagner said the lottery system is the only
way to ensure that everyone interested in the
speech has a fair chance of attending it.


Mikhail Gorbachev
"Many groups of people were
left out," she said. "A lot of people
left their names in different
places in case there were more
tickets."
Gorbachev's speech was moved
from Memorial Auditorium —
where it was originally scheduled
— to Frost to allow more people
to attend the speech.
"A lot more people were inter
ested than we thought," said
Freelen. "We moved out to Frost
because we thought there would

be demand, but we were unable to
estimate just how much it would
be."
Law School students received
tickets automatically, since an
endowment from the Law School
is bringing Gorbachev to cam
pus.
Some students suggested
moving the speech from Frost
to Stanford Stadium, Wagner
said.
However, the Stadium was
never really considered, according
to Freelen, who said it would be
"too big of a venue."
"This event is essentially for
the Stanford community, not for
the public," he said.
