A former Stanford security guard was arrested
Saturday for a series of thefts that occurred in the
University's Anthropology Department during
the 19705, according to Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington.
After receiving a tip, Stanford and Gilroy police
found numerous art objects — ranging from whale
bone swords to Native American sculptures and
jewelry — and about 200 rare books at the home of
Stephen Crawford in Gilroy, Calif., Herrington said.
Police are uncertain whether the books belong
to Stanford.
Crawford, 46, was arrested on five counts of
possession of stolen property and one count of
possession of hashish.
He was later freed on $25,000 bail.
The stolen objects were apparently for Craw
ford's own enjoyment and not for trade or profit,
Herrington said.
"We have no information right now that he
sold any of it," Herrington said. He added that the
art items, which were acquired by Stanford in the
1890s, "were in open view" in Crawford's home.
It has not been determined whether the books
found in Crawford's home — which included early
law books, Latin books and texts on slavery —
belong to Stanford, according to
Maggie Kimball, head of Univer
sity libraries' special collections.
"No reasonable identifying
marks'* have been found on the
books, she said.
Herrington said the value of
the stolen objects is not known
yet, but is "probably substantial."
Herrington said the thefts
occurred between 1975 and 1977,
at about the same time Crawford
worked at Stanford. He added
that Crawford may have contin
ued stealing from the University
collections after he left in 1976.
The Anthropology Department
and rare books collection had
reported many items missing dur
ing this time.
