A former Stanford security guard was arrested
Saturday for a series of thefts that occurred in the
University's Anthropology Department during
the 19705, according to Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington.
After receiving a tip, Stanford and Gilroy police
found numerous art objects — ranging from whale
bone swords to Native American sculptures and
jewelry — and about 200 rare books at the home of
Stephen Crawford in Gilroy, Calif., Herrington said.
Police are uncertain whether the books belong
to Stanford.
Crawford, 46, was arrested on five counts of
possession of stolen property and one count of
possession of hashish.
He was later freed on $25,000 bail.
The stolen objects were apparently for Craw
ford's own enjoyment and not for trade or profit,
Herrington said.
"We have no information right now that he
sold any of it," Herrington said. He added that the
art items, which were acquired by Stanford in the
1890s, "were in open view" in Crawford's home.
It has not been determined whether the books
found in Crawford's home — which included early
law books, Latin books and texts on slavery —
