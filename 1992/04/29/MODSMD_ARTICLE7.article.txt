# Haven't found what they're looking for
## Slow reshelving of Green Library books draws student complaints

Jenny Stine arrived at Stanford
this spring to prepare for her
doctoral oral exams, a friend
warned her that she wouldn't be
able to find books she needed in
Green Library.
But Stine didn't realize just
how bad the situation could be.
At first, she found only "one
or two books" out of eight she
searched for. When she inquired
at the circulation desk about the
other books, she was told they
hadn't been checked out.
"What shocked me was that I
couldn't even go to circulation to
find out if a book had been
checked out or not," Stine said.
"We're talking about access to
books that Stanford owns."
Many students who use
Green say they have experienced
similar frustration when search
ing for books.
•Joan Krasner, chief of access
services at Greenp, said recent
delays in reshelving books have
been caused largely by library
budget cuts. She said the prob
lem is "in the process of being
resolved" by adding 75 hours of
reshelving per week until the
end of August.
Library administrators decid
ed to hire more reshelvers in
response to numerous student
and faculty complaints.
Kenneth Brewer, a graduate
student in Modern Thought and

Literature, said he requested a
search for a book on April 1. The
library did not locate the book
until April 23, more than three
weeks later.
The delay would have been
acceptable if someone else had
borrowed the book, Brewer said,
but "this book hadn't been
checked out."
Bernice Romero, a graduate
student in Latin American Stud
ies, said the inability to find
books she needs for her research
has "caused a lot of anxiety."
Signs in the Green stacks tell
library users to leave uncharged
materials on reshelving carts
rather than replace the books
themselves.
But Romero said she would
never place a book on the reshelv
ing cart, where it may take weeks
to resurface. Whenever she reads
a book without checking it out,
she said, she returns it to a safer
place. "I know I won't find it
again if I put it on the cart,"
Romero said.
Krasner said that at the end of
a typical winter quarter, between
50,000 and 60,000 books are
returned to the library.
"It's tough to get them
reshelved in time for the spring
quarter," she said. "I certainly
understand how difficult it is for
the students."
In response to complaints,
"there has been a special alloca
