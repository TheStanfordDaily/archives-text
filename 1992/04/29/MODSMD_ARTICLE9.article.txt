# ASSU committees question bill to use reserve funds
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Two ASSU committees raised questions
about the Omnibus reform bill — which
would use $800,000 of ASSU reserve funds
to give each student a $65 one-time refund
check — in meetings last night.
One committee voted to remove the
$800,000 refund portion from it entirely,
leaving only a provision to divert $170,000
of ASSU reserve funds to the program and
publication boards.
The other voted to table the bill while its
legal ramifications are considered.
The bill is on the agenda for tonight's
senate meeting, according to Senate Chair
Kevin Warsh. Although it was not original
ly scheduled for discussion, Warsh said he
thought debate on the bill should begin as
soon as possible because coming to a final
decision on the bill will likely take "several

meetings."
The bill, authored by seven senators, pro
poses to take nearly $1 million from ASSU
reserve funds and use about $800,000 of the
money to give every Stanford student a one
time refund of about $65.
The bill would distribute the remainder
of the money — about $170,000 — to
groups seeking funding from the program
and publications boards.
The budget and finance committee,
which met last night, voted to remove the
$800,000 refund from the bill, according to
ASSU financial manager Mike Risch, a
committee member. The remainder of the
bill was sent to the senate with no recom
mendation, Risch said.
The senate's administration and rules
committee last night decided to table the
bill in committee, and ask the senate to
"seek legal advice as to whether the bill
would cause trouble with the ASSU's tax

exempt status," according to deputy senate
chair Neil Crellin, a committee member.

ASSU financial manager
Mike Risch said he worried
that the bill 4 would jeopar
dize the non-profit status of
the ASSU.'

Risch said he was also "concerned that
this (bill) would jeopardize the non-profit
status of the ASSU." Risch said he felt the
bill effectively returned ASSU profits back
to students who had "invested" in the
ASSU by paying fees, paying a sort of divi
dend on the ASSU's work.
Risch said he had spoken with auditors

from Hood & Strong — the firm that audits
the ASSU — who said the bill "would be
hard to defend" if the ASSU were audited
by the government.
Peter Thiel, a graduate senator and co
author of the bill, said he had spoken with
Risch and said there "may be some prob
lem" with the bill as it is currently worded.
However, Thiel said there are "ways to
work around that," and added the bill could
undergo many changes, including amend
ments while being discussed in the full sen
ate, before coming to a final vote.
Thiel said he thought the refund checks
"were an important part of the bill as orig
inally conceived," and would be sorry to see
them go.
According to Crellin, the senate meeting
— originally scheduled for last night — was
postponed to give the budget and adminis
tration committees a chance to consider
the bill before it went to the senate.
