Who Says Opportunity Knocks Only Once?
Certainly not Stanford Federal Credit Union
If you received a bank or dealership new car loan
within the last two years and you don't like the interest
rate you're paying, we might be able to help you.
Whether you are looking to buy a New Vehicle or have
recently bought one, Stanford Federal Credit Union
can save you some money. Our current interest rates
on New Vehicle Loans are the lowest in our Credit
Union's history.
If you have a 1991 or 1992 car, van, or truck, and have
fewer than 24,000 miles on your odometer, we'll
refinance your vehicle as if it were new (on approved
credit and inspection of the vehicle).
May Interest Rates for New Vehicle Loans:
8.5% Fixed or 8% Variable, 36 months
8.75% Fixed or 8.25% Variable, 48 months
8.9% Fixed or 8.5% Variable, 60 months
Borrowers who select the automatic transfer method to
repay their loans receive an additional 1/2% off these
rates.
