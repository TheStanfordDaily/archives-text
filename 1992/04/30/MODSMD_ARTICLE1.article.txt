# 300 students protest King-beating verdict
## Organizers plan a longer-term civil rights campaign 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Behind yesterday's large rally at the
Palo Alto police station was a core of Stan
ford organizers who are planning a more
targeted and long-term movement against
the verdict in the Rodney King beating trial
and civil rights abuses in general.
Ujamaa resident assistant and Black
Student Union Chair Bacardi Jackson said

the issue went beyond the Los Angeles
police force and King, and affected the
entire nation, including Stanford. "Police
men have been known to stop black men on
this campus," she said.
"It's not just a black issue. It's a human
rights issue. It's important no one feel
excluded," said junior Denise Morris.
The Black Student Union and the Stan
ford chapter of the NAACP put together
the meeting at the Lagunita dining hall

where students planned the rally.
Some of the organizers stayed behind at
Ujamaa, working on petitions and initial
statements to be sent to politicians and the
press.
Freshman Jomo Graham said he chose
to stay behind "because working behind the
scenes is just as important as being there at
the rally. You need the people behind the

scenes to make the campaign long-term."
The statement on the petition — addressed
to the L.A. police — says the Rodney King ver
dict represents an "utter failure of our judicial
system to protect all citizens from violations
of their civil rights."
More petitions and letters will be circulat
ing today, and a table will be set up in White
Plaza, Jackson said. Organizers are also plan
ning a rally in While Plaza Friday.
Copies of signed petitions will be sent to
L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley, California Gov. Pete
Wilson and other political figures, said Jeff
Chen, one of the members of the letter-writ
ing committee. More petitions will be circulat
ed throughout the Stanford community today
and later on, he said.

An initial letter signed by students Chen,
Joseph Elrod and Abdul-Ali Soltani is already
on its way to William Barr, the Attorney Gen
eral of the Civil Rights Division of the U.S.
Justice Department.
In addition, Chen said members of the com
munity will send telegrams to President Bush
and all of the presidential candidates to make
an election issue of racism in the judicial sys
tem.
Jackson asked students to wear black today
"because it is the color of solidarity as well as
mourning."
Multicultural educator Greg Ricks and
Director of the Black Community Services
Center Keith Archuleta attended the meeting
and protest, advising students.
Ricks said the King decision was "a horri
ble, major injustice" which showed the "dual

sense of justice in our society." Even a video
tape was not enough to convict the officers, he
said.
The situation "reminds me of the '60s. I
thought those days were gone," he said.
Archuleta said he was so upset about the
incident that he could not think clearly. He
said he approved of the students' response
because it is "not random and not violent" and
because "it is especially hard to be patient in
the middle of a violent system."
In a speech delivered at the Stanford Law
Review dinner last night, Julius L. Chambers,
Director-Counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense
and Education Fund, compared "the jury ver
dict today in L.A. with those in Georgia and
Mississippi and Carolina, and it makes one
wonder if after all these years of the civil rights
movement, things really will get better."
