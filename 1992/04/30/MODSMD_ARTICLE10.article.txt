# Candidates for Congress tackle economy
## 
### Michael McCarroll Staff writer 
The five Republican candi
dates seeking the Republican
nomination for the 14th con
gressional district — of which
Stanford is part — engaged in
an hour-and-a-half debate in
the History Corner last night.
Dixon Arnett, Paul Biddle,
Tom Huening, Michael Maibach
and Bill Quraishi fielded ques
tions on economic competitive
ness, health care, drugs, educa
tion and trade before an audi
ence of less than 30.
The debate, sponsored by the
Stanford College Republicans,
began with three-minute open
ing statements by the candi
dates. Political Science Prof.
David Brady and freshman Lisa
Koven asked a prepared set of
questions. A 30-minute question
and answer session and closing
statements followed.
Much of the discussion cen
tered around issues of national
economic competitiveness.
Arnett, a former deputy
undersecretary of the U.S.
Department of Health and
Human Services, discussed an
extensive list of economic propos
als to "fuel the ailing economy."
The cornerstones of Arnett's
proposals were investment tax
credits and the creation of a per
manent research and develop
ment tax credit.
Maibach agreed that "the
name of the game in the 21st

century is investment."
He advised that Americans
"help themselves," and not criti
cize the trade policies of other
countries.
"I couldn't change my room
mate in college," Maibach said.
"How can we change the
Japanese?"
The candidates also criticized

corrupt behavior in Congress.
Quraishi, an engineer and
entrepreneur, assailed politi
cians as "the root of all evil" and
called Congress "a bunch of
chameleons."
Addressing the need for exten
sive change in the congressional
membership, Quraishi said,
"Politicians are like dirty diapers.

You have to change them often."
Maibach followed by pointing
out that new congressional
members must be from the busi
ness community. An executive at
Intel, Maibach noted that there
are only three representatives
who had worked for a Fortune
500 company.
Huening, former San Mateo
County Supervisor, sounded a
call for action in Congress, speak
ing of the "David Disorder" as his
most outstanding attribute.
"I have an irrational urge to
attack the influential and most
powerful institutions," Huening
said. He pointed out his initiative
with Proposition 119, the 1990
redistricting bill, as an example.
Biddle, who led the assault on
accounting procedures during
the indirect-cost controversy,
opened his remarks by defend
ing his actions at Stanford.
"I tried to resolve matters that I
thought were inappropriate," he
said. "I fought against waste in the
government, not the University."
Biddle called for "vigilance in
oversight in all [government]
agencies," based on his experi
ence with Stanford.
The 14th congressional district
runs along the Peninsula from
central San Mateo County in the
north to Sunnyvale on the south.
The seat, which was formerly
called the 12th congressional dis
trict, is being vacated by former
Stanford Law Prof. Tom Camp
bell, who is running for a U.S.
Senate seat.
