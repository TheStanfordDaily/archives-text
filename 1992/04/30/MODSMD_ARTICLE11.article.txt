### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
Stanford Police yesterday dis
played items they recovered from
the home of a man arrested for a
series of 1970s thefts in the Univer
sity's Anthropology Department.
The list includes everything from a
Chinese cane carved in the shape of
a snake to crystal that may have
belonged to the Stanfords.
Acting on a tip, Stanford Police
arrested Gilroy resident Stephen
Crawford on Saturday, after find
ing numerous art objects and more
than 280 rare books in his home.
The items were on display at a
press conference yesterday morn
ing, at which Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer described Craw
ford as an "art afficonado" who
took the items for his own interest,
not to sell them for profit.
Items from University collec
tions as well as personal property
of professors have been recovered.
Crawford, who worked as a
Stanford security guard from
1975 to 1976, has been charged
with five counts of possessing
stolen property, a felony, and one
count of possession of hashish.
As a security guard, Crawford
had keys to many buildings, mak
ing it "pretty easy to avail himself
of these antiquities," according to
Niemeyer.
The value of the items has not
been appraised yet, Niemeyer
said.
The items were apparently

taken from many private offices
and buildings, including the
Hoover Institution and Building
110, where the Department of
Anthropology is located.
Stanford Police are now in the
process of trying to identify and
catalogue the recovered items. A
list of the items will be circulated
among the faculty, who may then
come to identify items that may
have been taken from their offices.
Crawford was released from
custody after posting $25,000 bail.
Lorenz Eitner, emeritus profes
sor of art and former director of the
Stanford Museum, accompanied
police when they searched Craw
ford's home on Saturday morning.
According to Eitner, the muse
um had loaned many of the pieces
to the Anthropology Department,
"where security was obviously
very lax."
Niemeyer said that since the
19705, security and inventory
procedures have been greatly
improved but conceded that
employees are capable of breach
ing security.
"We're not very happy about
it, obviously," Niemeyer said.
The most significant pieces
recovered — and the only objects
reported missing— were ardillite
sculptures made by the Haida
Indians of the American North
west. These stone carvings are
part of a larger collection amassed
by Leland and Jane Stanford
beginning in the mid-1800s, Eit
ner said.
