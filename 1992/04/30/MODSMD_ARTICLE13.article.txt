Personal safety issues
arise from within and
beyond Campus Drive

Students at Stanford
are all too often given over to
the feeling that the campus is
an entirely safe place, where no
harm can come to them.
Unfortunately, the distance
between Stanford and the crime
problems of nearby cities is not a
large one, although a Campus Drive
which cloisters us off from the rest
of the world makes it seem so.
The effects of poor economic
conditions and increasing crime in
neighboring cities — although
most of us are not exposed to them
on a daily basis — do not stop at
the gates of Stanford University.
The campus events of recent
weeks, including gunfire aimed at
rollerbladers, a sexual assault and
an attempted kidnapping, should
not be considered freak incidents
but rather violence that validates
our need to be concerned for our
personal safety.
Our campus is free from the
magnitude of crime seen in some
urban areas, but we are in no way
immune to criminal actions —
despite what the palm trees and
rolling foothills may tell us.
Of course, it is incorrect for stu
dents to believe that their only
security concerns originate off
campus. In many little-publicized
occurrences, both the victim and
the assailant come from the Stan
ford community.
For instance, in a 1989 Stanford
Rape Education Project survey,
more than a third of female under
graduate and graduate students
indicated they had been coerced
into sexual activity, and 98 percent
of the women knew their assailant.
Many of these sexual assaults —
over 50 percent of them at Stan
ford — involved the use of alcohol,
which often threatens the personal
safety of Stanford students.

Studies have shown that 50 to 70
percent of property damage and 30
to 45 percent of physical and emo
tional abuse on college campuses
results from the use of alcohol.
Junior Daniel Lichstein's alcohol
related suicide earlier this year
makes it only too evident that the
nationwide problems associated with
alcohol abuse occur at Stanford, too.
Problems such as date rape and
alcohol abuse often go unreported
and make for less glamorous news
than shootings, but they affect a
great number of students and
deserve our attention.
Students should be equipped
with knowledge on how to best
prevent putting themselves in vul
nerable positions and how to react
when their personal safety is being
threatened.
There are several things that
can be done to transfer this knowl
edge to students without making
them feel uncomfortable in their
home environment.
The University could make
instruction on personal safety a
more significant part of its orienta
tion program. Safety education
could also take place through the
efforts of residential education
programs and informal discus
sions.
The University should look to
expand, not cancel, innovative
courses dealing with personal safe
ty such as the self-defense class for
women. Students should be
encouraged to look at issues of per
sonal safety academically, through
courses such as The American
Drinking and Drug Culture.
Additional actions being taken,
such as fraternities and other
groups providing "sober monitors"
and door watchers at their parties,
should be adopted across campus.
More emergency telephones
would help also to prevent unfor
tunate incidents.
The lesson we should take away
from recent events and proposed
new actions is not that we need to
better protect our "safe haven,"
but that it never really existed in
the first place.
