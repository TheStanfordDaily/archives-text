U.S. environmentalism ignores Third World problems

IAM WRITING in response to the
spate of letters defending environ
mentalism that appeared in Tues
day's Daily.
These letters only served to confirm
my belief that the environmental move
ment in the United States, with its
myopic, Western-centered approach, is
ill-equipped to even begin to understand
the issues involved.
Environmental degradation is a global
problem and any legitimate attempt at
addressing the issue has to account for the
concerns of the developing Third World.
Our environmentalists with their
noble goal of "saving the planet" conve
niently gloss over the more than a bil
lion people in the developing world who
live in poverty.
In his letter to The Daily, graduate
student David Hauri laments: "How can
we be so cruel as to leave future genera
tions with no forests in which to find
peace. . ." This naive reasoning infuri-

ates me.
How can we be so cruel as to stand
quietly as famine sweeps across the
Horn of Africa and 23 million people
(according to World Bank estimates) lie
in danger of starving to death now?
Hauri states that the "[environmen
tal 1 movement's goal is to save Earth for
children." Really.
Perhaps he is unaware that about
50,000 children die every day because of
malnutrition and lack of access to ade
quate health care. Or do these children
not count?
In her letter, sophomore Sarah
Gilman argues for "a ban on rainforest
destruction ... to preserve the ten
thousand species which already provide
treatments for diseases .. . and [which]
just might hold the cures for AIDS and
cancer."
The most widespread diseases are
hunger and poverty, however, and not
cancer or AIDS.

Does Gilman believe that the people
in Brazil and other poorer countries are
just stupid and have no other business
but to go around wantonly destroying
valuable rainforests?
Unless the underlying economic
inequalities in the global system which
lead to such destruction are tackled, the
environmental movement will win little
global support.
This blissful ignorance is nowhere
more apparent than in this feel-good fad
called recycling. I fail to understand the
logic behind these recycling contests at
Stanford which actually encourage peo
ple to consume more in order to have
more waste to recycle.
Environmentalists are tackling the
symptom of the problem, namely waste,
and not the root cause, which is exces
sive consumption.
Rather than preaching to the rest of
the world about rainforests and popula
tion explosion, the West would do well to

learn from the frugality of the poor.
Environmental degradation has been
caused by the rapid industrialization of
the West, and now, after having reaped
the benefits of economic development
and faced with the grim realities of
"progress," the Western world wishes to
contain the aspirations of the peoples of
the rest of the world for a better life.
This arrogance is characteristic of the
environmental movement in the West,
and it is also what the forthcoming
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June
is all about.
In their letter to The Daily, Karen
Plaut and Michael Cohen of Students for
Environmental Action at Stanford state,
"Earth Day 1992 has passed, and it is
time to look beyond our personal inter
ests and work towards the universal goal
of an inhabitable planet."
How true.
