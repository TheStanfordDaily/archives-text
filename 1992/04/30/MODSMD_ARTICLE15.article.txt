# Call for balanced views in environmental issue
## 
### 
I would like to response to Jonathon
Marek, president of the Ayn Rand Soci
ety, and to Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford regarding their Earth
Day statements.
Working for human and environmen
tal progress requires cooperation, com
munication and compromise between
various interest groups, including envi
ronmentalists, business people and gov
ernments of nations in vastly different
stages of development.
So far, I fear that these groups are
perpetuating obsolete roles that only
create conflict.
I was disturbed by the centerpiece
of the midday event for Earth Day
this year, a battle between Styromas

ter, the "demon of industrial evil"
according to The Daily, and the SEAS
tree.
I was equally disturbed by Marek's
environmental "Life-Haters,"
described in his April 12 letter to The
Daily as attackers of human dignity
who are working against societal devel
opment.
In the earlier days of environmental
awareness, environmentalists may have
felt the need to be anti-industrial
activists in order to spread the word that
our current path of development was not
accounting for serious costs that would
undermine any hope for long-term sus
tainability of modem society, and indeed
of human life.
Industrialists busied themselves
defending against threats to their prof
its, and others, such as Marek, attacked
the environmental movement as an irra
tional argument that would preserve

fuzzy creatures at the expense of human
well-being. It's time to grow up and
grow out of these roles.
Rafe Sagarin's response to Marek
pointed out some of the ways the envi
ronmental movement is directly bene
fitting people by protecting them
against serious health hazards.
I would like to add that there are
innumerable examples of environmen
tal protection and human development
going hand in hand.
For instance, nations could reap oil
fields worth of benefits from conserva
tion measures and more efficient appli
ances and insulation.
The United States alone could save
half the power that currently goes to
lighting without decreasing the amount
of light supplied, simply by installing
compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which
actually save money over the life of the
bulb compared to regular incandescent

bulbs.
It is in the interest of the entire
world, industrialized and not, to help the
developing nations improve their access
to modern conveniences in a inexpensive
and sustainable fashion. Some places in
India are powering stoves with methane,
an innovative and plentiful energy
source.
There will probably always be those
few who believe that we should do any
thing to protect everything in nature,
and those few who think that steps to
preserve human life are actually con
spiracies to end it.
But real work need? to be done by
those who can see the possibility of
improving standards of living for
humans in the long run by accounting
for the environmental feedbacks of our
actions.
