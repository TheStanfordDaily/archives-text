## sex, lies and manslaughter 
### 
I HEADED OVER to the party at Elliott
alone and nervous. I wandered into the
main floor but was surprised at how
few familiar faces I spotted. I found my
girlfriend, but she was dancing with some
one else and so I hung out by the wall.
Eventually I bumped into a friend, we
talked a little and started dancing.
This was the first time I had ever
danced with a man.
The party had been thrown by the Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Community Cen
ter and was like any other party except
that men danced with men and women
with women. That difference, however,
was profound. My girlfriend is bisexual
and out, so I wasn't alone, but I felt total
ly isolated from my straight male friends.
From childhood on I have grown up
conscious of, yet ambivalent toward,
queer folk. As early as elementary school,
the big joke was to throw your friend's
hat or kickball into the gay bookstore
down the block. Later in life, when gay
men made eyes at me while walking on
the street, I felt threatened.
Nevertheless, part of my conscious
ness imagined I might try gay sex. Men
screwing men was just a part of a sexual
continuum I figured I'd explore someday.
However, as high school progressed, the
combination of insecurity, girlfriends and
peer homophobia pushed queer thoughts
from my mind.
Also, AIDS and male violence turned

me off. It was almost as if I knew the sex
ual dominance men forced on women and
feared being on the receiving end of that
equation.
Once at Stanford, though, with the
prodding of close friends, I began to think
about my sexuality more. One friend
challenged me by saying that you
couldn't really know if you were hetero
sexual until you'd experienced both gay
and straight relationships. You had to
make a choice for yourself — anything
else was just obeying society's orders.
In questioning myself I realized that
I've occasionally been attracted to men,
but I suspect that most men have had
similar thoughts. I know I've been curi
ous about gay sex, but does that make me
gay? Does being interested in gay sex
even make me bisexual, or just "open
minded"?
I know I'm sexually attracted to women,
but, as my friend puts it, I really haven't
chosen heterosexuality either. At this point
I can only identify as queer — unclear on
specifics, but deviant from the norm.
Though I have the privilege to choose,
I fear how this column will taint my every
future encounter with "straight" men at
Stanford. Every time I touch a "straight"
man — whether its a tap on the shoulder
or a warm hug — I fear they'll recoil at
the thought I'm trying to come on to
them.
The real problem, of course, is not this

column but rather our society's hostility
to homosexuality. Men have no reason to
fear me, and I shouldn't silence myself in
response to their hatred and insecurities.
Moreover, all of our male interactions
are affected by homophobia. Every joke,
high-five and glance is built on a fragile
foundation of presumed heterosexuality.
From the prospective freshman who
sleeps on the floor rather than his host's
double bed to the long-awaited airport
embrace between two men that is sudden
ly and awkwardly cut short, homophobia
is a backdrop to almost all of our contact.
A kid I knew in high school was recent
ly convicted of luring a gay stranger into
an alley and killing him with the sharp
end of a hammer. Few of us may ever go
"fag-bashing," but I know that each of us
acts in smaller ways that contribute to the
bigger problem. Our sneers, jokes, inac
tion and silence deaden everyone's life.
My parents' generation was on the
forefront of breaking down racial barri
ers; let us do the same for sexuality and
gender. We must face the fears that
inhibit us from coming alive.

Omar and his girlfriend are also bilin
gual ...


Tew of us may
ever go "fag
bashing," but
each of us con
tributes to the
bigger prob
