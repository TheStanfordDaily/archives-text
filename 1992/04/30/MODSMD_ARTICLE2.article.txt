# Late-night march to Palo Alto

As fires blazed in Los Angeles last
night, more than 300 Stanford stu
dents answered with a candlelight vigil
and emotional speeches in front of the
Palo Alto Police Station.
The students began their march to
the station from Lagunita Court at
about 11 p.m., chanting, "The cameras
tell the truth, so why don't you?" and
"To protect and serve."
The rally, formed in response to yes
terday's "not guilty" verdicts for four
white police officers charged with beat
ing black motorist Rodney King,
wound through White Plaza and down
Palm Drive.
"I'm mad at that jury. That jury had
a choice [and] they took the easy way
out," Keith Archuleta, director of the
Black Community Services Center,
told the ralliers. "As a black man in
America ... it looks like white folks
have, and black folks don't."
During the march, freshman Erika
Bentson said she called her family in
Pacific Palisades, which is close
enough to South Central Los Angeles
that they could see the fires, to make
sure they were safe.
"My parents told me it was danger
ous to go out and I should stay and do
homework. I told them thanks for the
advice but I wasn't going to follow it."
She joined a chant of "Four hundred
years, still not free" for a minute, then
added, "It makes me really angry to think
this kind of blatant racism goes on where
I live. It makes me feel responsible."
The crowd's mood ranged from sor
row to anger, and students disagreed on
the appropriate response to the verdict.
The rally was a "show of force, of
solidarity," said senior James Rucker,
but people are hoping for a "very
peaceful" event.
Jennifer Williams, a junior, agreed.
"We're not going to burn anything.
We'll just have a peaceful demonstra
tion," she said.

But in contrast, some students
chanted "Burn, motherfucker, burn"
and sophomore Cherie Burgess told the
crowd that when she heard the news "I
wanted to burn that motherfucker
down... .We're not taking this shit."
"This is not about holding hands,"
she said. "Fuck the police!"
Black Student Union chair Bacardi
Jackson drew cheers from the multira
cial crowd with her statement that the
verdict "affects all Americans regard
less of color."
And according to sophomore Dave
Neiman, the decision "doesn't
make make me sad to be a white
person, it makes me sad to be a
human being."
Jackson directed the march
onto the park in front of the sta
tion, where she said the police had
agreed to let them gather. Stu
dents climbed onto a fountain and
took turns speaking to the respon
sive crowd.
Jackson said police "gave us lee
way as far as blocking the street"
and told her the rally was "fine as
long as it was kept orderly."
Williams said the march began
at Lagunita, and passed Florence
Moore Hall, the Law School,
Stern Hall and Wilbur Hall before
proceeding down Palm Drive to
the station in downtown Palo
Alto.
As the crowd headed down
Palm Drive, organizers handed
out candles and tried to keep the
marchers from spilling out of the
right lane. But at some points stu
dents overflowed and blocked traf
fic.
According to Palo Alto Police
Sergeant John Costa, who was at
the rally with one other officer, the
traffic was light and he was not
concerned about marchers block
ing the street.
Costa said he was contacted at
10 p.m. about the rally. "The orga
nizers have been terrific about
communication," he said.
"One of our biggest concerns is
ensuring that [the students] can
gather with no interference from
people in the area," he said, adding
that he did not experienced any
hostility from the crowd.
Palo Alto police spokesperson
Jean Krahulec said about five offi
cers were asked to extend their
shifts "to provide a safe environ
ment" and "be prepared" in case
anyone showed up with opposing
views or if things got out of con
trol.
Costa said the police were
"going to allow people to stay as
long as its peaceful and no prob
lems arise."
The organizers did not need a
permit last night, Costa said,

although they might have if the
rally had been planned ahead of
time.
But "the police department
needs to be flexible" and have
some "priorities," he added.
During the rally, students and
administrators waited their turns
to address the crowd.
The problem doesn't end with a
jury in Southern California,
Archuleta said. Every day Stan
ford students "go to classes with
no black professors, no Asian pro
fessors," or professors from other
minority groups.
In the long term, he said, "We
can make sure that the theme
houses aren't always under
attack" and that Afro-American
studies "isn't an unusual major."
He said he was "scared for (the
safety of) an all-black crowd," but
was impressed to see the diverse
group at the protest.
Despite some talk about spend
ing the night at the station, the
speeches ended at about 1 a.m.
and the crowd marched back to
campus. Some students passed
dormitories, shouting "Wake up,"
and one group reconvened in
Ujamaa to plan future events.
Multicultural educator Greg
Ricks praised the students for
organizing the rally themselves.
"I'm just supporting it,"he said. "I
am very impressed. It's very mul
ticultural — this is a dream for
me."
"There would have been even
more people here" if there were
more time for planning, Ricks
added. "Most people are so frus
trated they can't do anything in a
personal way," and the rally pro
vides them with an outlet, he said.
Several students at the rally
expressed disillusionment with
the trial's result. "I'm disgusted,
disappointed and angry," said
junior Lydia Jones. "I thought I
was going to cry."
"It's an outrage," said sopho
more William Martin. "It's time to
make a stand."
The need to take action was
echoed by many of the speakers.
"Until we take political control,
nothing will happen," said Louis
Jackson, a 1991 graduate. "We
may not have money or power, but
we have numbers in this state.
Remember this and do something
about it."
