As fires blazed in Los Angeles last
night, more than 300 Stanford stu
dents answered with a candlelight vigil
and emotional speeches in front of the
Palo Alto Police Station.
The students began their march to
the station from Lagunita Court at
about 11 p.m., chanting, "The cameras
tell the truth, so why don't you?" and
"To protect and serve."
The rally, formed in response to yes
terday's "not guilty" verdicts for four
white police officers charged with beat
ing black motorist Rodney King,
wound through White Plaza and down
Palm Drive.
"I'm mad at that jury. That jury had
a choice [and] they took the easy way
out," Keith Archuleta, director of the
Black Community Services Center,
told the ralliers. "As a black man in
America ... it looks like white folks
have, and black folks don't."
During the march, freshman Erika
Bentson said she called her family in
Pacific Palisades, which is close
enough to South Central Los Angeles
that they could see the fires, to make
sure they were safe.
"My parents told me it was danger
ous to go out and I should stay and do
homework. I told them thanks for the
advice but I wasn't going to follow it."
She joined a chant of "Four hundred
years, still not free" for a minute, then
added, "It makes me really angry to think
this kind of blatant racism goes on where
I live. It makes me feel responsible."
The crowd's mood ranged from sor
row to anger, and students disagreed on
the appropriate response to the verdict.
The rally was a "show of force, of
solidarity," said senior James Rucker,
but people are hoping for a "very
peaceful" event.
Jennifer Williams, a junior, agreed.
"We're not going to burn anything.
We'll just have a peaceful demonstra
tion," she said.

But in contrast, some students
chanted "Burn, motherfucker, burn"
and sophomore Cherie Burgess told the
crowd that when she heard the news "I
wanted to burn that motherfucker
down... .We're not taking this shit."
"This is not about holding hands,"
she said. "Fuck the police!"
Black Student Union chair Bacardi
Jackson drew cheers from the multira
cial crowd with her statement that the
verdict "affects all Americans regard
less of color."
