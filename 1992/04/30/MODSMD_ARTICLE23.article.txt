## Mum's word on Sanders 
### 
Sophomore women's
swimmer Summer Sanders
has yet to respond to a USA
Today report alleging that
she would leave Stanford at
the end of this year to devote
herself to full-time training
for the Olympics. Sanders
would qualify for financial
support from the U.S.
Olympic Committee.
In a story which ran in
Tuesday's USA Today,
Sanders admitted that she
had talked with Advantage
International, a sports agen
cy, about her chances at
endorsement opportunities,
and that an announcement
concerning her status would
be made next month.
The sophomore would be
the second Card swimmer in
the past two years to leave
the Farm before graduating.
In 1991, Janet Evans pulled
out of school because of new
NCAA practice restrictions.
Sanders is currently at
the University of Northern
Arizona, where she will con
tinue altitude training with
the rest of the Olympic team
for the next few weeks.
