# 'His legacy will remain...’
## Senior Christian Cevaer attains legendary status on golf course 
### Andy Eiser Staff Writer 
He is an unlikely revolution
ary, a gentle, soft-spoken man
who is quite happy with the way
things are.
Yet to know senior Christian
Cevaer — who will be leading his
Cardinal teammates at the Pacific
10 Conference Golf Champi
onships this weekend in Corvaliis,
Ore.— is to know someone whose
impact on the Stanford golf team
has been immeasurable, who has
reversed the fortunes of the pro
gram almost single-handedly in
his four years here.
Where there was none, now
there is one: A tradition started
on the day, then first-year head
coach Wally Goodwin recruited
him in 1988. All that will remain
after Pac-10 and NCAA play in
the next six weeks will be the lega
cy of Christian Cevaer, a legacy
that may mean more to the school
than it does to the man himself.
An impressive list of individual
achievements can certainly be
made: among other things,
Cevaer was Pac-10 Individual
Champion in 1989 and an Ail-
American in 1990, and he will
leave Stanford with the lowest
stroke-per-round average of any
one who has ever hit the links in a
Cardinal uniform. Yet Cevaer has
done far more than fill Goodwin's
lineup card with a solid No. 1

player each tournament; he has,
in fact, ensured that numbers two
through six pose the potential
threat they do today.

'Christian is the rea
son other guys have
come here. He's my
franchise player.'

Junior Brad Lanning, sopho
mores Notah Begay and Casey
Martin and freshmen Steve Bur
dick and Jerry Chang— all of
Cevaer's companions at Oregon
State's Tristring Tree Golf
Course this weekend— have been
drawn to Stanford not only for its
academic reputation, but for its
golfing prowess as embodied in
the person of their leader.
"Christian is the reason other
guys have come here," said Good
win. "He's my franchise player."
The rise from novice to "fran
chise" has taken about a decade
for Cevaer, who started playing
golf only after he had "gotten
tired of playing tennis" at age 12.
Beside his late start in the game,
it cannot be said that Cevaer has
lacked pleasant conditions in
which to learn competitive golf.
Born in New Caledonia (a French

territory in the South Pacific), he
moved to Tahiti with his family
when he was 10. As there was
only one course on the entire
island, Cevaer was playing to a
low handicap by the time he was
ready for high school.
At age 14, Cevaer decided to
come to school in the United
States in order to sharpen his golf
skills and work toward an eventu
al professional career in the game.
He attended Robert Louis Steven
son High School in Pebble Beach,
and was able to call the pic
turesque Spyglass Hill Course his
home for his four years there. It
was at Stevenson where he met
Ben Doyle, coach of several tour
ing pros, who encouraged Cevaer
to play NCAA golf; it did not take
much convincing on Doyle's part.
"I had heard that most of the
pros had played in college, so I
wanted to also," said Cevaer. "I
don't regret my decision, because
college adds a whole lot of quality
to your life." Not to mention a
diploma, which Cevaer already
has earned in psychology.
Now that the twilight of his
collegiate career has been
reached, Christian Cevaer has
new goals. After playing for the
French National Team this sum
mer, Cevaer, who is a French citi
zen and is only in the U.S. on a
student visa, must serve one year
in his nation's army. Upon
returning from his tour of duty,

he will attempt to start a profes
sional career in Europe or Asia
before joining the PGA.
If he enjoys success in the pro
ranks, he will be the first French

golfer ever to leave a mark on the
international scene. Would it be
the start of another revolution?
No, France already has had
one.

'Christian is the rea
son other guys have
come here. He's my
franchise player.'
—Wally Goodwin

Junior Brad Lanning, sopho
mores Notah Begay and Casey
Martin and freshmen Steve Bur
dick and Jerry Chang— all of
Cevaer's companions at Oregon
State's Tristring Tree Golf
Course this weekend— have been
drawn to Stanford not only for its
academic reputation, but for its
golfing prowess as embodied in
the person of their leader.
"Christian is the reason other
guys have come here," said Good
win. "He's my franchise player."
The rise from novice to "fran
chise" has taken about a decade
for Cevaer, who started playing
golf only after he had "gotten
tired of playing tennis" at age 12.
Beside his late start in the game,
it cannot be said that Cevaer has
lacked pleasant conditions in
which to learn competitive golf.
Born in New Caledonia (a French

territory in the South Pacific), he
moved to Tahiti with his family
when he was 10. As there was
only one course on the entire
island, Cevaer was playing to a
low handicap by the time he was
ready for high school.
At age 14, Cevaer decided to
come to school in the United
States in order to sharpen his golf
skills and work toward an eventu
al professional career in the game.
He attended Robert Louis Steven
son High School in Pebble Beach,
and was able to call the pic
turesque Spyglass Hill Course his
home for his four years there. It
was at Stevenson where he met
Ben Doyle, coach of several tour
ing pros, who encouraged Cevaer
to play NCAA golf; it did not take
much convincing on Doyle's part.
"I had heard that most of the
pros had played in college, so I
wanted to also," said Cevaer. "I
don't regret my decision, because
college adds a whole lot of quality
to your life." Not to mention a
diploma, which Cevaer already
has earned in psychology.
Now that the twilight of his
collegiate career has been
reached, Christian Cevaer has
new goals. After playing for the
French National Team this sum
mer, Cevaer, who is a French citi
zen and is only in the U.S. on a
student visa, must serve one year
in his nation's army. Upon
returning from his tour of duty,

he will attempt to start a profes
sional career in Europe or Asia
before joining the PGA.
If he enjoys success in the pro
ranks, he will be the first French

golfer ever to leave a mark on the
international scene. Would it be
the start of another revolution?
No, France already has had
one.
