# NBA megatalents have no place in Olympics
## 
### 
Picture this scenario: David Robin
son plays tight defense on his
opponent, forcing a bad shot.
Then Karl Malone skies over everyone
else to snare the rebound and flips the
ball to Magic Johnson, who hurls a base
ball-pass to Michael Jordan streaking
down the court. Instead of soar ing to the
hoop himself, Jordan dishes the ball
back to his trailer, Charles Barkley, who
rocks the rafters with yet another thun
dering dunk. USA 1011, Tasmania 3.
Fun to watch, you say? I don't
think so.
At first it sounds great. It'd be like
watching a bunch of NBA All-Star
games right in a row — our favorite
basketball heroes would dance, prance
and hotdog all over Barcelona, making
mincemeat of the international com
petition and bringing home the gold to
the good ol' U.S. of A.
The Olympics might be Johnson's
swan song, you say. What a heart
warming story it would make for him
to play one last game with his friends
and achieve his last remaining goal, an
Olympic gold medal.
Sorry, folks, but sending an All-

Star basketball team to Barcelona has
so many things going against it that I
think someday we're all going to
regret the decision.

For starters, even blowouts get bor
ing. A lot of people will tune in to watch
the first few games where the USA will
stomp all over Peru, India, and the
Netherlands. But after the All-Stars go
up by forty points in the middle of the
second quarter, everyone is going to start
nodding off. You can only watch so many
fast-breaks and rim-shattering dunks.
The whole idea of professional ath
letes participating in the Olympics
cheapens the competitions themselves,

too. Okay, I agree, it is supposed to be
the best of each country matching up
against one another, but the U.S. has
gotten by for years with amateurs play
ing basketball without complaint.
Let's not kid ourselves — we all
know that a major reason for inviting
NBA All-Stars to play is so America can
win the gold again, and that contradicts
the Olympic spirit of friendly, competi
tive contests. With Jordan and Johnson
and company, there won't be any com
petition at all, and that's wrong.
Also, the collegiate players are get
ting cheated out of their once-in-a-life
time opportunity. Robinson, Ewing and
Jordan have all already been to the
Olympics once. Why do they get to go
again? Some of the best college players
will never get a chance to go now. Jor
dan, Mullin, Stockton and Malone will
still be playing in four years and they
may even go to the games again in 1996
— it will probably be even more attrac
tive to NBA players to play in the
Olympics in Atlanta in front of a home
crowd and more will express an interest.
Put simply, Adam Keefe might never
get the opportunity to play for the USA

Keefe is a big, bruising power forward who
would more than hold his own down in the
blocks in the rough international game.
Think of how good an All-Star col
lege team would be: Keefe, Christian
Laettner, and Shaquille O'Neal in the
front court, with Walt Williams and
Jimmy Jackson at the guard positions.
And who would come off the bench?
How about Alonzo Mourning, Lee May
berry, Byron Houston, Harold Miner
and Chris Webber?
It's not as if our collegiate crop isn't
full of talented players. I think it would
be more fun to watch Miner and Keefe
working together on a team, shredding
opponents' defenses with their potent
inside-outside combination, than see
ing Stockton and Robinson do the
same thing.
We're giving away a lot of what
makes the Olympics special by fielding
an NBA team. The only excitement will
be to see how big the United States'
lead will be at the end of the game. Is it
worth giving up the opportunity for col
legiate players and the competitive
spirit of the Olympics just to insure
another gold medal for us?

And who would come off the bench?
How about Alonzo Mourning, Lee May
berry, Byron Houston, Harold Miner
and Chris Webber?
It's not as if our collegiate crop isn't
full of talented players. I think it would
be more fun to watch Miner and Keefe
working together on a team, shredding
opponents' defenses with their potent
inside-outside combination, than see
ing Stockton and Robinson do the
same thing.
We're giving away a lot of what
makes the Olympics special by fielding
an NBA team. The only excitement will
be to see how big the United States'
lead will be at the end of the game. Is it
worth giving up the opportunity for col
legiate players and the competitive
spirit of the Olympics just to insure
another gold medal for us?
