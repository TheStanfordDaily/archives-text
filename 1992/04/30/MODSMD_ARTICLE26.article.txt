## 
### Diane Green 
The Stanford women's water polo team exceed
ed all of its personal expectations this past week
end at the National Qualifying Tournament held
in Long Beach.
Ranked No. 9 entering the tournament, the
Cardinal went 2-2 to place seventh overall.
Although their performance was not enough to
place the team in a qualifying slot, the team
returned happy and satisfied.
Stanford's relatively low seed resulted in diffi
cult match-ups for the club in the early rounds in
the form of traditional powerhouses Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo and UC-Santa Barbara.
However in later match-ups against UCLA and
UC-Irvine, the Cardinal emerged victorious
despite having only one substitute the entire week
end.
Mid-tournament motivation was provided by
coaches Mev Hoberg and Andrea Milano, who agreed
to swim 100 yards for each goal Stanford scored
above its opponent's totals in the later rounds.
The agreement, along with some solid individu
al performances, led the team to victory in their
remaining games against the Bruins and the
Anteaters.
The team's effort was spearheaded by the
impressive goalkeeping of first-year player
Michelle Dicks. "Michelle was clearly on fire," said
team captain Leny Marcus.
On the offensive side of things, lefl-handed hole
set Susan Meyer had a team-high tournament
totals of nine goals, while Hillary Green contribut
ed five goals and Marcus added three goals and a
series of assists.
Other outstanding contributors for Stanford
were junior Maura Danforth, sophomore Karen
Suskiewicz and freshmen Nikki Bergstrom and
Jacinda Mawson.
The Cardinal wraps up its season this weekend
across the Bay at California.
"It will be wonderful to roll into next weekend's
tournament at Cal with these wins to boost our
confidence," said Marcus.
