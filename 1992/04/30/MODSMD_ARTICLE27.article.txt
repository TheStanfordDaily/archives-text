# Two on '92 team

### 
Months after making its first NCAA Tourna
ment appearance since 1978, the Stanford men's
soccer team continues to make an impact on the
national soccer scene. The Cardinal has placed
two representatives on the United States Olympic
men's soccer team, which qualified for the 1992
summer games with its recent win in Honduras.
Head coach Colin Lindores and midfielder
Rhett Harty wiu don red, white, and blue this
summer for the squad.
The team will play two more games before trav
eling to Spain, taking on Canada in Bloomington,
Minn, and St. John's, Newfoundland next month.
Lindores also announced signing several top
players for the 1996 recruiting class. The list is
headed by Carmen D'Onofrio, a member of the
Canadian Under-20 National Team. D'Onofrio, a
forward, was slated to arrive at the Farm last
season, but opted to take a year off before
enrolling.
However, the second-year coach stressed
that his squad was most sorely lacking at the
midfield position, where the loss of Harty will
hurt Stanford. "We've picked up a couple of
guys that will definitely give us a little added
depth at midfielder," said Lindores.
Those recruits, Greg Martellotto, Steve
Kirschbaum, and Chet Zimmer all excelled
either at fullback or midfield in high school.
