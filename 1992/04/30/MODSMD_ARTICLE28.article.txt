# Card controls Waves
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
After a gruelling tournament
win like the one the men's tennis
team experienced at last weekend's
Pacific 10 Outdoor Championships,
coming home to play a routine dual
match could be a bit of a let down.
But the men's tennis team showed
few signs of lethargy as they rolled
to a 6-2 victory over the Pepperdine
Waves yesterday afternoon.
Vimal Patel and Jason Yee
gave the Cardinal a solid 2-0 lead
with their straight set victories at
the fourth and sixth singles spots.
Sophomore Michael Flanagan fol
lowed suit with a 6-3, 6-4 win over
Parisian Charles Auffrey in the
second slot.
"I'm playing alot better now,"
Flanagan said. "I turned a corner
in Ojai when I played (Mark)
Knowles. I was in the match the
whole way and it really boosted
my confidence."
Unfortunately, the long week
end in Ojai seemed to take its toll
on top hitter Alex O'Brien and
sophomore Chris Cocotos, who
played in the No. 3 spot.
Both men won, but the Waves
pushed them each to three sets.
After winning nine matches in
three days last weekend, O'Brien
dug himself out of a 5-7, 0-3 hole to
defeat Howard Joffe. After winning
a tiebreaker in the second set 7-4,
the senior from Amarillo, Tex.
clinched the match, 6-4 in the third.
Cocotos had trouble holding
serve, but still won, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3,
with powerful service returns.
His victim, Ashley Naumann
defeated the Stanford sophomore
in a pre-season match last fall.
Robert Devens also had trou
ble with his serve. He stretched
the match to three sets but fell, 4-
6, 6-0, 4-6. "I let him dictate,"

Devens said. "The key is my serve
and if I'm not serving well, he's
going to put all kinds of pressure
on my second serve."
Devens was up 4-1 with two
break points in the first set but
lost his concentration and fell
behind. He spent the rest of the
match playing catch-up.
Devens had better luck in dou
bles. He teamed up with Flanagan
to wipe out the Waves' third dou
bles pair, 6-2, 6-1. "Michael and I
are working really well right
now," Devens said. Flanagan
agreed: "If we weren't playing so
well as a team, we would've had a
much closer match."
The first doubles duo of Coco
tos and O'Brien fought to a
tiebreak victory in the first set,
but lost 1-6 in the second before
play was suspended because of
time constraints.
At second doubles, Yee and
Patel lost a vicious battle in a third
set tiebreaker, 6-3, 2-6, 7-6. "It
was a bittersweet end to the day,"
Gould said. "But I'm not com
plainingâ€” I'll take a win over Pep
perdine any day. Overall, it was a
good match to have behind us.
They're a very dangerous team."
