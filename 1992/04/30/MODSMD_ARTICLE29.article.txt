CARD NOTES — The No. 1-ranked
Cardinal takes on the unranked
Huskies today in the final home
dual meet of the season. This will
be the last home match for Ail-
Americans Alex O'Brien and
Jason Yee. Cardinal head coach
Dick Gould is wary of the North
west team: "Washington is a
pesky team. They've improved
alot since last year, and I expect a
good match."
