# L.A. in chaos: fires, violence, at least 3 dead

LOS ANGELES (AP) - After a
jury acquitted four white police
officers of assault yesterday in the
videotaped beating of black
motorist Rodney King, violence
erupted across Los Angeles and
police said three people were killed.
Looting, gunfire, street fights,
vandalism and fires swept parts of
Los Angeles after the verdict. Gov.
Pete Wilson declared a state of
emergency for the Los Angeles
area and put National Guard
troops on standby.
There were reports of at least
31 fires, Los Angeles Fire Depart
ment spokesman Bob Collis said.
After the verdict, King's
lawyer, Steve Lerman, said, "My
client and I are just outraged. It
sends a bad message. It says it's
OK to go ahead and beat some
body when they're down and kick
the crap out of them."
Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl
Gates, pressured to resign after
the beating, wouldn't comment
directly on the verdict. "I do not
think there are any winners at all
in this situation," he said.
Mayor Tom Bradley blasted
the jury's decision.
"Today, this jury told the
world 'what we all saw with our
own eyes wasn't a crime," Bradley
said. "Today, that jury asked us to
accept the senseless and brutal
beating of a helpless man."
Hours after the verdicts,
demonstrators clashed with offi
cers at the downtown Los Angeles
police headquarters and the
police station where the four offi
cers worked.
TV footage showed assailants
pulling at least four motorists
from their vehicles and beating
them. A United Press Interna
tional radio reporter and a pho
tographer for The New York
Times were attacked but didn't
appear seriously hurt.
In the most graphic incident,
news helicopters aired footage of a
man being pulled from his tractor
trailer rig, beaten and clubbed
with a tire iron as looters went
through a nearby liquor store,
Unocal gas station and auto parts
store.
Men who beat the truck driver
raised their hands and smiled. The

trucker was in critical condition.
Three people were reported
killed, 138 injured and 25 arrested.
The jury included an Asian, a
Hispanic and no blacks. One juror
in the trial said the fact that King
did not testify in the trial may
have affected the verdict.
"Had King been able to talk to
us, the video might have been
looked at differently," Ted Kop
pel of ABC's "Nightline" quoted
the juror as saying yesterday.
Neither side called King as a
witness at the trial.
"Time and again, the juror
told me, 'King controlled the
action, he could have stopped it.
When he got out of the car, he
could have put his hands in the
air, he wouldn't have been
touched,' " Koppel said.
As for the suggestion of
racism, the juror pointed to the
presence of two other blacks in
King's car who surrendered and
were not beaten.
The juror said the panel looked
at the tape more than 30 times,
slowing it down to be examined
frame by frame. When slowed
down, it was clear that many
blows did not connect, the juror
told Koppel.
"I have no regrets about the
verdict," the juror said. "I'll sleep
well tonight."
The jury acquitted the officers
of the more serious assault
charge and secondary charges,
but deadlocked on one count of
excessive force.
