LOS ANGELES (AP) - After a
jury acquitted four white police
officers of assault yesterday in the
videotaped beating of black
motorist Rodney King, violence
erupted across Los Angeles and
police said three people were killed.
Looting, gunfire, street fights,
vandalism and fires swept parts of
Los Angeles after the verdict. Gov.
Pete Wilson declared a state of
emergency for the Los Angeles
area and put National Guard
troops on standby.
There were reports of at least
31 fires, Los Angeles Fire Depart
ment spokesman Bob Collis said.
After the verdict, King's
lawyer, Steve Lerman, said, "My
client and I are just outraged. It
sends a bad message. It says it's
OK to go ahead and beat some
body when they're down and kick
the crap out of them."
