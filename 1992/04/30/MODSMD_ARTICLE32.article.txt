# ASSU approves funds
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
In what undergraduate senator
Ron Brown called the "fastest meet
ing ever," the ASSU senate passed
funding for the program, communi
ty service and publication boards
last night — but did not discuss a
bill that would give each Stanford
student a one-time $65 refund.
The Omnibus Fee Reform bill
was not debated because it is still
being considered by the ASSU's bud
get and finance, administration and
rules and appropriations commit
tees, Senate Chair Kevin Warsh said.
If passed, the bill will take near
ly $1 million from the ASSU
reserves, putting about $800,000 of
that money toward the refund, and
most of the remainder — about
$170,000 — into the program and
publications boards. In addition,
the bill would put $10,000 toward a
year-end party at for
students thrown by the ASSU.
During committee reports to the
full senate, however, administra
tion committee chair James Brown,
a graduate senator, said his com
mittee had looked at the bill and
was "generally confused" by its

content.
Redistributing the reserve funds
as described in the bill would
require changes in the ASSU
bylaws, Brown said. However,
those changes are never explicitly
stated in the bill.
"Something as vague as this is
not going to go through in a hurry,"
he said.
According to Deputy Senate
Chair Neil Crellin, another admin
istration committee member, the
group drafted a resolution Tuesday
asking the senate to seek outside
legal advice to find o it whether the
bill would violate the ASSU's non
profit status.
The senate last night also
approved spring quarter discre
tionary funding for the publication,
program and community service
boards.
Last night's meeting was a spe
cial meeting called to approve the
board funding. Only 17 senators
attended the one-and-a-half-hour
long meeting.
According to Crellin and Council
of Presidents member Beth Mor
gan, last night's meeting was the
shortest ASSU senate meeting in at
least three years.
