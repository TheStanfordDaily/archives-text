## THE
						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY Spring fever 
### Trevor Payne Staff writer 
It's spring quarter at Stanford,
and something is in the air —
besides the odd Frisbee and those
worms hanging off the trees.
Now that warm weather's
here, the campus reduces its
aggregate course load and tries to
approximate the state-school life
we are paying a lot of money to
miss.
School and all its trappings —
classes, papers, midterms — are
still unavoidable. However, peo
ple are making the extra effort to
suppress that reality, taking every
opportunity to bake in the sun,
play volleyball, drink some beer,
take off for the weekend and take
the weekend off.
A notable change to this year's
version of spring quarter is that
we have a lake. Even though it's
kind of murky, green and gross
along the shore, it is proving to be
a useful distraction. Water-sport
fanatics have flocked to Lake Lag
to windsurf, sail, kayak and even
swim.
According to Amy Herman,
one of the kayak instructors, it
can be a wet nightmare out there

with all the "incompetent water
goers." The lake, at times, is lit-

tered with capsized boats, fallen
windsurfers and kayakers who

can't get right-side up. So
Lake Lag is probably more

fun to look at than to be in.
The ocean is the place to
get wet. One of the loca-

tions Herman frequents is

Montara Beach, just north of
Half Moon Bay. It's a great beach
for playing in the surf or paddling
up the coast, where spectacular
cliffs drop right into the water.
Herman even saw a whale
once. "This enormous fin sur
faced, the backbone smoothly

arched out of the water
and it blew air a few
times," she said. Face to .
face with nature — y
exciting stuff.
Spring is also the time

when surfers get going. Even
though the waves are biggest in
the winter, 40-degree tempera
tures prove too daunting for
most. But now that it's warmer,
Fred Rowley, a member of Stan
ford's surfing subculture, has
begun his regular pilgrimages to
