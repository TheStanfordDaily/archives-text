## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY Spring fever 
### Trevor Payne Staff writer 
It's spring quarter at Stanford,
and something is in the air —
besides the odd Frisbee and those
worms hanging off the trees.
Now that warm weather's
here, the campus reduces its
aggregate course load and tries to
approximate the state-school life
we are paying a lot of money to
miss.
School and all its trappings —
classes, papers, midterms — are
still unavoidable. However, peo
ple are making the extra effort to
suppress that reality, taking every
opportunity to bake in the sun,
play volleyball, drink some beer,
take off for the weekend and take
the weekend off.
A notable change to this year's
version of spring quarter is that
we have a lake. Even though it's
kind of murky, green and gross
along the shore, it is proving to be
a useful distraction. Water-sport
fanatics have flocked to Lake Lag
to windsurf, sail, kayak and even
swim.
According to Amy Herman,
one of the kayak instructors, it
can be a wet nightmare out there

with all the "incompetent water
goers." The lake, at times, is lit-

tered with capsized boats, fallen
windsurfers and kayakers who

can't get right-side up. So
Lake Lag is probably more

fun to look at than to be in.
The ocean is the place to
get wet. One of the loca-

tions Herman frequents is

Montara Beach, just north of
Half Moon Bay. It's a great beach
for playing in the surf or paddling
up the coast, where spectacular
cliffs drop right into the water.
Herman even saw a whale
once. "This enormous fin sur
faced, the backbone smoothly

arched out of the water
and it blew air a few
times," she said. Face to .
face with nature — y
exciting stuff.
Spring is also the time

when surfers get going. Even
though the waves are biggest in
the winter, 40-degree tempera
tures prove too daunting for
most. But now that it's warmer,
Fred Rowley, a member of Stan
ford's surfing subculture, has
begun his regular pilgrimages to

Lighthouse Beach or Pleasure
Point near Santa Cruz to ride some
waves.
Surfing, according to Rowley, is
an existential high. "When you get
on a wave, nature's coming right at
you. It's surreal," he said. No guts,
no glory.
"It's hairy. You hesitate out of
pure fear, say 'Fuck it' and go for a
ride." If you want to learn, Rowley
says, you should use a long board,
get someone to show you how it's
done and ignore the fact that
you're fearing for your life.
There are also plenty of dry
land ways for students to enrich
their spring experience. Victor
Huang is a member of the Court
Jugglers, a sub-group of the Inter
national Juggling Association, and
he throws things up in the air to
get his mind off school.
Spring, with the warmer weath
er and brighter sun, is the opti
mum time to go outside and flex
those juggling muscles. As Huang
said, "It's great in the sunlight
with the clubs flashing in the air."
You've probably seen the Court
Jugglers out in front of the Quad
doing their stuff on sunny after
noons.
Spring is also a great time to get
into the earth and not just on it.
The abundant green brought by
winter rains inspired Kimball Hall
Resident Assistant Pam Briskman
to gather people together to plant a
vegetable garden.
Briskman said it is "really cool"
to get outside and see something
you planted grow. "It's kind of like
having a pet that keeps getting big
ger. You water it and you feed it."
Unfortunately, hah the garden
has died already. But since it's
spring, Briskman prefers to see it
as half full.
If all this sounds too energetic,
there is a new non-strenuous club
on campus which meets outside

now that it's warm. Robby Mock
ler is the founder and president of
the Stanford Tiddlywinkers. They
play — you guessed it — tiddly
winks.
According to Mockler, it's a way
to take a load off. "I know it
sounds silly, but it's a great way to
relax," he said. "We drink beers
while playing; the loser buys for
the next time. And except for some

occasional thumb soreness, it's
virtually injury-free."
So whatever the pleasure,
spring is the time of year at Stan
ford to pull a Ferris Bueller and
blow off some academics. After all,
three straight serious quarters is
enough to make anyone a little
crazy, and as long as we're still in
school while everyone else is get
ting out, we might as well enjoy it.

when surfers get going. Even
though the waves are biggest in
the winter, 40-degree tempera
tures prove too daunting for
most. But now that it's warmer,
Fred Rowley, a member of Stan
ford's surfing subculture, has
begun his regular pilgrimages to

Lighthouse Beach or Pleasure
Point near Santa Cruz to ride some
waves.
Surfing, according to Rowley, is
an existential high. "When you get
on a wave, nature's coming right at
you. It's surreal," he said. No guts,
no glory.
"It's hairy. You hesitate out of
pure fear, say 'Fuck it' and go for a
ride." If you want to learn, Rowley
says, you should use a long board,
get someone to show you how it's
done and ignore the fact that
you're fearing for your life.
There are also plenty of dry
land ways for students to enrich
their spring experience. Victor
Huang is a member of the Court
Jugglers, a sub-group of the Inter
national Juggling Association, and
he throws things up in the air to
get his mind off school.
Spring, with the warmer weath
er and brighter sun, is the opti
mum time to go outside and flex
those juggling muscles. As Huang
said, "It's great in the sunlight
with the clubs flashing in the air."
You've probably seen the Court
Jugglers out in front of the Quad
doing their stuff on sunny after
noons.
Spring is also a great time to get
into the earth and not just on it.
The abundant green brought by
winter rains inspired Kimball Hall
Resident Assistant Pam Briskman
to gather people together to plant a
vegetable garden.
Briskman said it is "really cool"
to get outside and see something
you planted grow. "It's kind of like
having a pet that keeps getting big
ger. You water it and you feed it."
Unfortunately, hah the garden
has died already. But since it's
spring, Briskman prefers to see it
as half full.
If all this sounds too energetic,
there is a new non-strenuous club
on campus which meets outside

now that it's warm. Robby Mock
ler is the founder and president of
the Stanford Tiddlywinkers. They
play — you guessed it — tiddly
winks.
According to Mockler, it's a way
to take a load off. "I know it
sounds silly, but it's a great way to
relax," he said. "We drink beers
while playing; the loser buys for
the next time. And except for some

occasional thumb soreness, it's
virtually injury-free."
So whatever the pleasure,
spring is the time of year at Stan
ford to pull a Ferris Bueller and
blow off some academics. After all,
three straight serious quarters is
enough to make anyone a little
crazy, and as long as we're still in
school while everyone else is get
ting out, we might as well enjoy it.

Sunset kayaking on Lake Lag is one way for Stanford students to
cool off and enjoy the spring.
It's spring quarter at Stanford,
and something is in the air —
besides the odd Frisbee and those
worms hanging off the trees.
Now that warm weather's
here, the campus reduces its
aggregate course load and tries to
approximate the state-school life
we are paying a lot of money to
miss.
School and all its trappings —
classes, papers, midterms — are
still unavoidable. However, peo
ple are making the extra effort to
suppress that reality, taking every
opportunity to bake in the sun,
play volleyball, drink some beer,
take off for the weekend and take
the weekend off.
A notable change to this year's
version of spring quarter is that
we have a lake. Even though it's
kind of murky, green and gross
along the shore, it is proving to be
a useful distraction. Water-sport
fanatics have flocked to Lake Lag
to windsurf, sail, kayak and even
swim.
According to Amy Herman,
one of the kayak instructors, it
can be a wet nightmare out there

with all the "incompetent water
goers." The lake, at times, is lit-

tered with capsized boats, fallen
windsurfers and kayakers who

can't get right-side up. So
Lake Lag is probably more

fun to look at than to be in.
The ocean is the place to
get wet. One of the loca-

tions Herman frequents is

Montara Beach, just north of
Half Moon Bay. It's a great beach
for playing in the surf or paddling
up the coast, where spectacular
cliffs drop right into the water.
Herman even saw a whale
once. "This enormous fin sur
faced, the backbone smoothly

arched out of the water
and it blew air a few
times," she said. Face to .
face with nature — y
exciting stuff.
