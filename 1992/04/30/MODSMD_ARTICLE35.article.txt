# Ending up a cartoon in a 'toon graveyard

To be honest, I'd prefer not to
talk about it. But I will any
way.
I was used to rejection. I had
been rejected by some of the finest
learning institutions in this coun
try. By some of the most attractive
women in my dorm. I was even
rejected as an academic adviser.

But this time I was rejected by
12,000 of the brightest young men
and women in America. And it
made me think.
Let me backtrack. Several
months ago, in some Perry Fried
man-possessed incarnation of
Jimmy Stewart, I got the crazy idea
to try and play Mr. Smith and
change the ASSU.
I decided to run for Council of
Presidents.
"Ha," thought the-naive-and
yet-unjaded 1, "I'll be different. I'll
make the ASSU do something.
And I'll make them do something
silly. I'll slip jokes about Gil Mas
ters' wardrobe into the lecture
notes and show clips from 'She's

Got it Made' at the beginning of
Flicks. And maybe, if nobody is
looking I'll even bring back the
dry-cleaning service."
So I went to the upper level of
Tresidder and added my name to a
long list entitled, "People With
Really Big Egos Who Need to
Learn a Lesson," or something like
that. My name came right after
Louis Jackson, so I knew they
hadn't changed the list in a while.
And from that moment on,
everything was different.
The next thing I knew, I was on
the wrong side of the newspaper,
saying things like: "I really think
we can work with the senate in
making a lot of constructive
changes."
I was whisked around from stu
dent group to student group, lis
tening to them tell me their most
intimate secrets.
The Women's Center told me
they needed a dean. Not a dean of
women, but a dean of the
Women's Center. And I just sat
there and nodded as if it was as
normal as throwing a party on
Don Kennedy's lawn.
And I started knowing things I
didn't want to know. Like the dif
ference between Nom Com and
Senate Chair. I found myself heed
lessly throwing around acronyms
like VSO and OSA and MILF. I
even found out what a provost did.
In a phrase, I had become a
white politician.
