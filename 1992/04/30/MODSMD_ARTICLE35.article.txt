# Ending up a cartoon in a 'toon graveyard
## 
### 
To be honest, I'd prefer not to
talk about it. But I will any
way.
I was used to rejection. I had
been rejected by some of the finest
learning institutions in this coun
try. By some of the most attractive
women in my dorm. I was even
rejected as an academic adviser.

But this time I was rejected by
12,000 of the brightest young men
and women in America. And it
made me think.
Let me backtrack. Several
months ago, in some Perry Fried
man-possessed incarnation of
Jimmy Stewart, I got the crazy idea
to try and play Mr. Smith and
change the ASSU.
I decided to run for Council of
Presidents.
"Ha," thought the-naive-and
yet-unjaded 1, "I'll be different. I'll
make the ASSU do something.
And I'll make them do something
silly. I'll slip jokes about Gil Mas
ters' wardrobe into the lecture
notes and show clips from 'She's

Got it Made' at the beginning of
Flicks. And maybe, if nobody is
looking I'll even bring back the
dry-cleaning service."
So I went to the upper level of
Tresidder and added my name to a
long list entitled, "People With
Really Big Egos Who Need to
Learn a Lesson," or something like
that. My name came right after
Louis Jackson, so I knew they
hadn't changed the list in a while.
And from that moment on,
everything was different.
The next thing I knew, I was on
the wrong side of the newspaper,
saying things like: "I really think
we can work with the senate in
making a lot of constructive
changes."
I was whisked around from stu
dent group to student group, lis
tening to them tell me their most
intimate secrets.
The Women's Center told me
they needed a dean. Not a dean of
women, but a dean of the
Women's Center. And I just sat
there and nodded as if it was as
normal as throwing a party on
Don Kennedy's lawn.
And I started knowing things I
didn't want to know. Like the dif
ference between Nom Com and
Senate Chair. I found myself heed
lessly throwing around acronyms
like VSO and OSA and MILF. I
even found out what a provost did.
In a phrase, I had become a
white politician.


Joel Stein
Notes from a Rambling Lemming
I mean, I had always been pret
ty white. My musical taste was
white, my dancing was white, my
inability to jump any higher than
necessary to stay inconspicuous
during "All Right Now" was
white.
But this was different. This was
white attitude. I no longer said
what 1 thought. Instead, I started
to say what people wanted to hear.
Not even because I wanted to win

so badly, but because they so badly
wanted to hear it.
And then before I knew it, we
lost. And, although I was disap
pointed and ashamed to ever show
my face anywhere on this campus
again, in some strange way it felt
good.
For the first time in too long, I
was myself again. I was being
interviewed by some all-too-slick
guy on X-TV wearing a tie, sport
coat and shorts and, no matter
what he asked, I kept trying to
introduce that Divinyls video.
I was no longer the guy on those
huge, annoying billboards in front

of White Plaza. And I wasn't the
smiling guy on those scary red
fliers. I was me, and I was oonox
ious, and I was happy.
So now, after all I learned, I
don't think I'm going to law
school. I'll have to take my
chances somewhere else.
At least I got to meet Bill Walsh.
Ah, Bartleby! Ah, humanity!

Joel Stein is no longer anyone's

that whiny Harris kid, though not

And then before I knew it, we
lost. And, although I was disap
pointed and ashamed to ever show
my face anywhere on this campus
again, in some strange way it felt
good.
For the first time in too long, I
was myself again. I was being
interviewed by some all-too-slick
guy on X-TV wearing a tie, sport
coat and shorts and, no matter
what he asked, I kept trying to
introduce that Divinyls video.
I was no longer the guy on those
huge, annoying billboards in front

of White Plaza. And I wasn't the
smiling guy on those scary red
fliers. I was me, and I was oonox
ious, and I was happy.
So now, after all I learned, I
don't think I'm going to law
school. I'll have to take my
chances somewhere else.
At least I got to meet Bill Walsh.
Ah, Bartleby! Ah, humanity!

Joel Stein is no longer anyone's
tool but his left hand. His column
will appear here weekly because
that whiny Harris kid, though not
taking any classes, claims he is
busy "writing a book."
