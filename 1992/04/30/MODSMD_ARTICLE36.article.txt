# Jazz band resuscitates stifled tunes
## 
### Scan Etigson Staff writer 
A student enters the Coffee House on a
Thursday night and spends 20 minutes shuf
fling beer glasses and books before she notices
that a jazz quartet is playing.
Relegated to background noise in many
settings, acoustic jazz on campus has lost its

intimate connection with the audience.
Disturbed by the lack of support given to
jazz artists on campus, bassist Greg Ryan,
drummer Tobin Cooley and saxophonist
Anton Schwartz decided to bring their musi
cal protests to the concert hall.
Tomorrow in Campbell Recital Hall, the
trio will perform with special guest pianist Bill
Bell in an attempt to reclaim the resonant tra

dition of John Coltrane, Miles Davis and
Wayne Shorter.
Ryan, Cooley and Schwartz began playing
together in the Stanford Jazz Band three years
ago. Since then, they have collaborated in a
number of small groups, rotating configura
tions and personnel.
Ryan, a senior English major, explained,
"We were playing a lot of different things, and
the constants seemed to be Anton, Tobin and
me."
The advantages of playing in small groups,
according to Schwartz, a graduate student in
computer science, are that "you draw on stuff
that you can't play at some of these Real Book
sessions."
While playing from a Real Book provides
the notes, playing within a trio, quartet or
quintet fosters the type of communication
that creates vital, intimate music.
"It allows you to grow a lot," Ryan said of
the small group experience. "That's the beau
ty of playing with the same people. You learn
to anticipate what they're going to do. And
then they might do something that totally
surprises you, and that's great, too."
For Cooley, a senior in acoustical engineer
ing, learning to drum in this jazz context
meant moving away from the funk-rock tradi
tion he knew.
"Now I'm working on playing the spaces,"
Cooley said. "I don't necessarily need to fill up
the spaces in the music. It's like tides on the
ocean and the swells they set forth in the
music. That's a big departure from most rock
drumming."
All three of the musicians spoke of the
growth they've witnessed in their individual
playing and in their ability to play off of each
other. They also acknowledged a debt to a pri
mary influence on their work: Bill Bell.

four years, Bell worked with all
three of the musicians and many
other big names as well, including
Dizzy Gillespie, Freddie Hubbard
and Carmen Macßae.
Beyond the notoriety, Schwartz
remembers, "More than anything,
what shined through was his love
of the music. It just made things
happen."
Ryan agreed. "Bill Bell has been
the single greatest teacher of music
I've ever had. He was able to
inspire us to play way above our
heads. He had us playing the
music with a real desire to say
something," he said.

The trio expressed gratitude for
Bell's generosity with his time and
his respect for their unrefined tal
ents.
"He would actually want to play
with us during his free time," said
Cooley. "And he'd always let you
know when you were doing some
thing right."
"And if you weren't," Ryan fin
ished, "he'd take the time to show
you how to do it right."
With Ryan graduating and
heading back to New York to pur
sue his music, and Cooley gradu
ating in the fall to move on to a job
and continued music in Seattle,
the group figured it was an appro
priate time to make a musical
statement to the community.
"There's a reason why we want
people to listen to us," Ryan said.

"Jazz still isn't a well-regarded art
form. There are still no classes
that have any real rigor or get any
real funding."
With the arts disappearing one
by one at Stanford, Schwartz is
alarmed that the last vestiges of
jazz may vanish without people
taking time to understand the
music.
"It's not about arpeggios and
scales and trying to teach your fin
gers to run," said Schwartz. "It's
about communicating beautiful,
simple ideas, and that's what we're
going to try to do."

Ryan, Schwartz, Cooley and Bell
will perform pieces in the bebop,
blue-note vein Friday at Bp.m. in
Campbell Recital Hall. Admis
sion is free.

fling beer glasses and books before she notices
that a jazz quartet is playing.
Relegated to background noise in many
settings, acoustic jazz on campus has lost its

intimate connection with the audience.
Disturbed by the lack of support given to
jazz artists on campus, bassist Greg Ryan,
drummer Tobin Cooley and saxophonist
Anton Schwartz decided to bring their musi
cal protests to the concert hall.
Tomorrow in Campbell Recital Hall, the
trio will perform with special guest pianist Bill
Bell in an attempt to reclaim the resonant tra

dition of John Coltrane, Miles Davis and
Wayne Shorter.
Ryan, Cooley and Schwartz began playing
together in the Stanford Jazz Band three years
ago. Since then, they have collaborated in a
number of small groups, rotating configura
tions and personnel.
Ryan, a senior English major, explained,
"We were playing a lot of different things, and
the constants seemed to be Anton, Tobin and
me."
The advantages of playing in small groups,
according to Schwartz, a graduate student in
computer science, are that "you draw on stuff
that you can't play at some of these Real Book
sessions."
While playing from a Real Book provides
the notes, playing within a trio, quartet or
quintet fosters the type of communication
that creates vital, intimate music.
"It allows you to grow a lot," Ryan said of
the small group experience. "That's the beau
ty of playing with the same people. You learn
to anticipate what they're going to do. And
then they might do something that totally
surprises you, and that's great, too."
For Cooley, a senior in acoustical engineer
ing, learning to drum in this jazz context
meant moving away from the funk-rock tradi
tion he knew.
"Now I'm working on playing the spaces,"
Cooley said. "I don't necessarily need to fill up
the spaces in the music. It's like tides on the
ocean and the swells they set forth in the
music. That's a big departure from most rock
drumming."
All three of the musicians spoke of the
growth they've witnessed in their individual
playing and in their ability to play off of each
other. They also acknowledged a debt to a pri
mary influence on their work: Bill Bell.

four years, Bell worked with all
three of the musicians and many
other big names as well, including
Dizzy Gillespie, Freddie Hubbard
and Carmen Macßae.
Beyond the notoriety, Schwartz
remembers, "More than anything,
what shined through was his love
of the music. It just made things
happen."
Ryan agreed. "Bill Bell has been
the single greatest teacher of music
I've ever had. He was able to
inspire us to play way above our
heads. He had us playing the
music with a real desire to say
something," he said.

The trio expressed gratitude for
Bell's generosity with his time and
his respect for their unrefined tal
ents.
"He would actually want to play
with us during his free time," said
Cooley. "And he'd always let you
know when you were doing some
thing right."
"And if you weren't," Ryan fin
ished, "he'd take the time to show
you how to do it right."
With Ryan graduating and
heading back to New York to pur
sue his music, and Cooley gradu
ating in the fall to move on to a job
and continued music in Seattle,
the group figured it was an appro
priate time to make a musical
statement to the community.
"There's a reason why we want
people to listen to us," Ryan said.

"Jazz still isn't a well-regarded art
form. There are still no classes
that have any real rigor or get any
real funding."
With the arts disappearing one
by one at Stanford, Schwartz is
alarmed that the last vestiges of
jazz may vanish without people
taking time to understand the
music.
"It's not about arpeggios and
scales and trying to teach your fin
gers to run," said Schwartz. "It's
about communicating beautiful,
simple ideas, and that's what we're
going to try to do."

Ryan, Schwartz, Cooley and Bell
will perform pieces in the bebop,
blue-note vein Friday at Bp.m. in
Campbell Recital Hall. Admis
sion is free.
