# Jazz band resuscitates stifled tunes

A student enters the Coffee House on a
Thursday night and spends 20 minutes shuf
fling beer glasses and books before she notices
that a jazz quartet is playing.
Relegated to background noise in many
settings, acoustic jazz on campus has lost its

intimate connection with the audience.
Disturbed by the lack of support given to
jazz artists on campus, bassist Greg Ryan,
drummer Tobin Cooley and saxophonist
Anton Schwartz decided to bring their musi
cal protests to the concert hall.
Tomorrow in Campbell Recital Hall, the
trio will perform with special guest pianist Bill
Bell in an attempt to reclaim the resonant tra

dition of John Coltrane, Miles Davis and
Wayne Shorter.
Ryan, Cooley and Schwartz began playing
together in the Stanford Jazz Band three years
ago. Since then, they have collaborated in a
number of small groups, rotating configura
tions and personnel.
Ryan, a senior English major, explained,
"We were playing a lot of different things, and
the constants seemed to be Anton, Tobin and
me."
The advantages of playing in small groups,
according to Schwartz, a graduate student in
computer science, are that "you draw on stuff
that you can't play at some of these Real Book
sessions."
While playing from a Real Book provides
the notes, playing within a trio, quartet or
quintet fosters the type of communication
that creates vital, intimate music.
"It allows you to grow a lot," Ryan said of
the small group experience. "That's the beau
ty of playing with the same people. You learn
to anticipate what they're going to do. And
then they might do something that totally
surprises you, and that's great, too."
For Cooley, a senior in acoustical engineer
ing, learning to drum in this jazz context
meant moving away from the funk-rock tradi
tion he knew.
"Now I'm working on playing the spaces,"
Cooley said. "I don't necessarily need to fill up
the spaces in the music. It's like tides on the
ocean and the swells they set forth in the
music. That's a big departure from most rock
drumming."
All three of the musicians spoke of the
growth they've witnessed in their individual
playing and in their ability to play off of each
other. They also acknowledged a debt to a pri
mary influence on their work: Bill Bell.
