# Play blends storytelling and the stage
## 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
In"The Last Mama on the
Couch Play," a segment of "The
Colored Museum," George Wolfe
spoofs plays about black life in the
'50s and '60s, and specifically, the
stereotypical strong-headed-and
hearted matriarch of the fatherless
black family, firmly rooted on her
living room sofa as though it were
the source of her strength.
But in Shay Youngblood's
"Shakin' the Mess Outta Misery,"
now playing at Theatre Works in
Mountain View, there's no couch
anywhere on the set, despite the
presence of plenty of strong women.
Unlike the hyperbolically pedan
tic parody in Wolfe's play, "Shakin' "
is a warm, peaceful, almost spiritual
celebration of the pride and love
these women gave to the young
woman known to the audience only
as Daughter.
Daughter relates her experiences
with the women who "taught [her]
about livin', lovin' and bein' a
woman," and her memories fold
neatly into recreations of the actual
moments from her past.
These women — Big Mama (her
grandmother), Aunt Mae, who sells
her homemade liquor, Miss Lama
ma, who was wed to an African
until he decided to take another
wife, and so on — were "women
who gave stories as gifts." It is these
stories that the audience is now
blessed to receive, via a most
intriguing method of storytelling.
Characters in the play begin
telling their stories to the rapt
Daughter, but then end up inhabit

ing the stories themselves. Yet the
flashbacks are never complete in
their transitions, and characters in
the stories act out their parts with
the voice of the storyteller. Narra
tors occasionally assume roles in
the story, but freely jump back into
observer mode, all without breaking
the flow of the tale.
Most notably, the play features
an all-female cast, with male figures
in the women's stories either played
by the storyteller or simply as
unseen characters. All the actresses
play their multiple roles flawlessly,
and as Daughter, Gwendolyn
McCann seamlessly transforms
herself from a nostalgic adult to an
awestruck child sitting at the feet of
her wondrous Big Mama.
Yet Daughter yearns for her
blood mother, Fannie Mae, who ran
off to New York to become a dancer.
Her longing for the woman who
appears only as a spirit dancing
around the stage is truly poignant in
the face of the outpouring of love
she receives from so many others.
"Shakin'" does what similar
plays often have trouble doing suc
cessfully: It presents the rich multi
faceted influences on black culture
in a subtle yet meaningful way.
Christianity, mystical faith-healing,
African ancestry, the legacy of slav
ery and the struggle for civil rights
all combine to give Daughter (and
the audience) a real taste of the
importance these forces have in
shaping the black experience.
Youngblood is currently adapting
her play, based on her short story
collection "The Big Mama Stories,"
into a movie to be produced by Sid
ney Poitier. The movie version will

undoubtedly embellish and fill out
the stories, regrettably losing much
of their ethereal charm.
"I keep these gifts close to my
heart, and I know to pass them on,"
says Daughter at the end of play,
after all the women have given her
presents celebrating her entrance
into womanhood. If the stories are

also the Big Mamas' gifts, then The
atre Works' audiences are fortunate
to be the latest recipients.

"Shakin' the Mess Outta Misery"
plays through May 16 at the Moun
tain View Center for the Performing
Arts. Student tickets are $12; phone
903-6000 for info.
