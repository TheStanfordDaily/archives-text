## Playing 'Forbidden' with human lives 
### Jonathan Lim 
Editor's note: This is the final
installment of a two-part short
story that began in Intermission
last week.

There were three of them. The
naked one sat in front of the moni
tor as the one in white and the one
in black played the Game.
The one in white, who had
ordered Mach to continue, sudden
ly thought of something.
"Stop, Mach, we haven't dis
cussed the Rules yet." He turned to
his friend. "We are only playing one
round, but I will let you use two
Dreams. For every Dream that you
use, I may counter with a
Tragedy."
The one in black did not like
this. "That's not fair," he said. "If I
use a Dream to counter an unfore
seen tragedy, then you can counter
my Dream with another Tragedy.
My move would be useless."
The one in black was playing for
his life. He knew that lobbying for
Rules was an important part of the
Game he had lost to Phoe many
times before. Since there was no
turning back, his only way out of
this Game was to win. And in order
to win, he had to make sure the
Rules were fair.
"How about countering with a
Rewind?" The one in black said
tentatively. He had thought of
something, but it was a gamble.
"Fair enough. Now, where were
we?"
"Bill pulled Lisa away from that
guy," the one in black reminded
him.
"That's right. Continue, Mach."
Mach closed his eyes.
The man looked at Bill and told
him to mind his own business. Bill
stood his ground, telling the man
to leave Lisa alone. The man
became enraged, and punched Bill
in the face, knocking him to the
floor. He then went berserk and
jumped on top of Bill, striking him
repeatedly in the face until his fists
turned red with Bill's blood.
"Stop!" The one in black cried
out. "I don't want our Subject to get
pummeled to death — insert a
Dream."
"Done," Phoe said. "Proceed,
Mach."
When Bill woke up, he was lying
face-down in a pile of books at a
library table. He looked visibly
shaken, as though he had just had
a nightmare. Bill stood up, donned
his overcoat, and then walked out
the door, smiling at the cute girl
working behind the checkout
counter as he passed.
It had snowed the night before,
and the air outside appeared to be
chilly. As Bill walked along a fairly
busy street with cars speeding past
him, an old lady started to cross the

street at the nearest intersection a
few yards ahead of him. The road
was icy, and the car in front was
going too fast to be able to stop in
time. Bill cried out to the woman,
but the gusty wind drowned out his
words. Without hesitation, he
sprinted to the lady and made a
desperate dive to save her.
"Stop!" Phoe yelled. He turned
toward his friend. "I sense impend
ing altruism here. You sure know
how to pick them, don't you?
There isn't any selfishness in this
guy."
"Phoe, you can't use a Stop for
no reason. You're just stalling
because you knew I was about to
win at that moment."
"You're wrong, friend. I called
Stop because I'm going to use my
Rewind here, to counter your
Dream. Rules are Rules," Phoe
smirked. "Rewind, Mach. Good,
you can Pause there."
This was bad. The one in black
knew he had lost two opportunities
to win the Game and to finally put
an end to all this madness, but
Phoe had managed to outwit him
by twisting the Rules to his own
advantage.
The Rewind would place both of
them at a disadvantage, however,
because it was an unpredictable
factor in the Game. Whenever it
was used, a minute fabric of time
was ripped out of the Voluntary
Human Subject's reality of exis
tence,- there was no telling what
would happen when time resumed.

The effccts of such an
act could be potentially
devastating.
Phoe knew the
consequences of using
the Rewind, but he also
knew the unpredictabili
ty factor would work in
his favor because it

would alter the sequence
of events in such a way that Bill
would not be able to repeat his
heroic act of altruism the second
time around.
"Are you ready, my friend?"
Phoe inquired. The one in black
nodded slowly. "Then Play, Mach."
*«!:»►
When time resumed, Bill had
left the library, and was outside
trudging in the heavy snow. He was
walking along a fairly busy street,
and there were cars speeding past

'The Game really is
over now, my friend. I
won't be seeing you
anymore. 7

him. One of the cars, which
seemed to be going a little too fast
on the icy road, suddenly swerved
out of control. It ran into Bill at full
speed.
"No!" Phoe cried out. "Rewind,
Mach! Rewind!!!"
Mach turned towards Phoe and
did something shocking.
He laughed.
It was silent at first, as though
Mach was taking his time to savor
the moment. As his laughter grew
in intensity, his eyes started to tear,
and his body began to shake in con
vulsive movements. But the real
shock came next.

Mach spoke.
Through the laughter, he choked
out the words, "You're over."
And that was it.
Unable to control his mirth,
Mach clutched at his stomach and
pranced around the room like a lit
tle boy receiving a new toy. His
naked dancing was punctuated by
delirious shrieks of glee. Phoe and
the one in black stared at Mach
with their mouths agape.
"What does he mean, Phoe?"
The man in black asked softly,
almost talking to himself. He had
outwitted his companion, and had
won the most important game the
two of them would ever play
together.
Phoe's face was ashen, and his
legs were trembling. "The Game
really is over now, my friend. I
won't be seeing you anymore. This
mistake has cost me a man's life —
I must suffer the consequences of
my actions."
"Can't you Rewind?" The one in
black said. He already knew the
answer.
Phoe's expression was solemn.
"You cannot Rewind Death," he
said quietly. Suddenly, he was livid.
"Don't you see? It's not a game
anymore. The Master will never
forgive me for this!"
Somewhere outside, the snow
was falling lightly. It had been a
white Christmas, which had made
the holiday more special for every
one in town. William Seymour
Lyons was lying on the snow-cov
ered pavement in the middle of
town, where a throng of concerned
citizens had formed a respectful cir
cle around him. They watched as
the paramedics worked furiously to
save his life, but Bill was unaware
of all this activity because he was
feeling numb from the cold and
from the pain.
Before dying, Bill heard laughter.

It had snowed the night before,
and the air outside appeared to be
chilly. As Bill walked along a fairly
busy street with cars speeding past
him, an old lady started to cross the

street at the nearest intersection a
few yards ahead of him. The road
was icy, and the car in front was
going too fast to be able to stop in
time. Bill cried out to the woman,
but the gusty wind drowned out his
words. Without hesitation, he
sprinted to the lady and made a
desperate dive to save her.
"Stop!" Phoe yelled. He turned
toward his friend. "I sense impend
ing altruism here. You sure know
how to pick them, don't you?
There isn't any selfishness in this
guy."
"Phoe, you can't use a Stop for
no reason. You're just stalling
because you knew I was about to
win at that moment."
"You're wrong, friend. I called
Stop because I'm going to use my
Rewind here, to counter your
Dream. Rules are Rules," Phoe
smirked. "Rewind, Mach. Good,
you can Pause there."
This was bad. The one in black
knew he had lost two opportunities
to win the Game and to finally put
an end to all this madness, but
Phoe had managed to outwit him
by twisting the Rules to his own
advantage.
The Rewind would place both of
them at a disadvantage, however,
because it was an unpredictable
factor in the Game. Whenever it
was used, a minute fabric of time
was ripped out of the Voluntary
Human Subject's reality of exis
tence,- there was no telling what
would happen when time resumed.

The effccts of such an
act could be potentially
devastating.
Phoe knew the
consequences of using
the Rewind, but he also
knew the unpredictabili
ty factor would work in
his favor because it

would alter the sequence
of events in such a way that Bill
would not be able to repeat his
heroic act of altruism the second
time around.
"Are you ready, my friend?"
Phoe inquired. The one in black
nodded slowly. "Then Play, Mach."

When time resumed, Bill had
left the library, and was outside
trudging in the heavy snow. He was
walking along a fairly busy street,
and there were cars speeding past

'The Game really is
over now, my friend. I
won't be seeing you
anymore. 7

him. One of the cars, which
seemed to be going a little too fast
on the icy road, suddenly swerved
out of control. It ran into Bill at full
speed.
"No!" Phoe cried out. "Rewind,
Mach! Rewind!!!"
Mach turned towards Phoe and
did something shocking.
He laughed.
It was silent at first, as though
Mach was taking his time to savor
the moment. As his laughter grew
in intensity, his eyes started to tear,
and his body began to shake in con
vulsive movements. But the real
shock came next.

Mach spoke.
Through the laughter, he choked
out the words, "You're over."
And that was it.
Unable to control his mirth,
Mach clutched at his stomach and
pranced around the room like a lit
tle boy receiving a new toy. His
naked dancing was punctuated by
delirious shrieks of glee. Phoe and
the one in black stared at Mach
with their mouths agape.
"What does he mean, Phoe?"
The man in black asked softly,
almost talking to himself. He had
outwitted his companion, and had
won the most important game the
two of them would ever play
together.
Phoe's face was ashen, and his
legs were trembling. "The Game
really is over now, my friend. I
won't be seeing you anymore. This
mistake has cost me a man's life —
I must suffer the consequences of
my actions."
"Can't you Rewind?" The one in
black said. He already knew the
answer.
Phoe's expression was solemn.
"You cannot Rewind Death," he
said quietly. Suddenly, he was livid.
"Don't you see? It's not a game
anymore. The Master will never
forgive me for this!"
Somewhere outside, the snow
was falling lightly. It had been a
white Christmas, which had made
the holiday more special for every
one in town. William Seymour
Lyons was lying on the snow-cov
ered pavement in the middle of
town, where a throng of concerned
citizens had formed a respectful cir
cle around him. They watched as
the paramedics worked furiously to
save his life, but Bill was unaware
of all this activity because he was
feeling numb from the cold and
from the pain.
Before dying, Bill heard laughter.

Editor's note: This is the final
installment of a two-part short
story that began in Intermission
last week.

There were three of them. The
naked one sat in front of the moni
tor as the one in white and the one
in black played the Game.
The one in white, who had
ordered Mach to continue, sudden
ly thought of something.
"Stop, Mach, we haven't dis
cussed the Rules yet." He turned to
his friend. "We are only playing one
round, but I will let you use two
Dreams. For every Dream that you
use, I may counter with a
Tragedy."
The one in black did not like
this. "That's not fair," he said. "If I
use a Dream to counter an unfore
seen tragedy, then you can counter
my Dream with another Tragedy.
My move would be useless."
The one in black was playing for
his life. He knew that lobbying for
Rules was an important part of the
Game he had lost to Phoe many
times before. Since there was no
turning back, his only way out of
this Game was to win. And in order
to win, he had to make sure the
Rules were fair.
"How about countering with a
Rewind?" The one in black said
tentatively. He had thought of
something, but it was a gamble.
"Fair enough. Now, where were
we?"
"Bill pulled Lisa away from that
guy," the one in black reminded
him.
"That's right. Continue, Mach."
Mach closed his eyes.
The man looked at Bill and told
him to mind his own business. Bill
stood his ground, telling the man
to leave Lisa alone. The man
became enraged, and punched Bill
in the face, knocking him to the
floor. He then went berserk and
jumped on top of Bill, striking him
repeatedly in the face until his fists
turned red with Bill's blood.
"Stop!" The one in black cried
out. "I don't want our Subject to get
pummeled to death — insert a
Dream."
"Done," Phoe said. "Proceed,
Mach."
When Bill woke up, he was lying
face-down in a pile of books at a
library table. He looked visibly
shaken, as though he had just had
a nightmare. Bill stood up, donned
his overcoat, and then walked out
the door, smiling at the cute girl
working behind the checkout
counter as he passed.
It had snowed the night before,
and the air outside appeared to be
chilly. As Bill walked along a fairly
