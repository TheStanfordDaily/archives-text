Steven Molen, one of two Indiana University
students shot by Stanford graduate student
Andreas Drexler, died Tuesday afternoon, Indiana
University Police Chief George Huntington said.
Molen, an Indiana University senior from Salt
Lake City, was taken to a Bloomington hospital where
he underwent three hours of surgery after being shot
in the abdomen by Drexler last Thursday night.
He died before regaining consciousness. He was
31 years old.
Molen had come to the aid of Indiana Universi
ty student Susan Clements last Thursday night.
Clements, Drexler's former girlfriend, was shot
and killed by Drexler moments afterward. Drexler
fled and killed himself a few blocks away.
Indiana University police believe Drexler drove
to Bloomington last week with the intention of
killing Clements, who broke up with Drexler last
year. He had harassed her with threatening phone
calls for the past few months.
Police said Drexler brought a 9mm Glock, a
high-capacity weapon holding 13-15 rounds, and a
.22-caliber semiautomatic pistol with him. ■
After searching Drexler's car, which was parked
in a lot two or three blocks away from Clements' dor
mitory, police found 2,000 rounds of ammunition —
enough, Huntington said, "to start a young war."
Among other items found in Drexler's 1985
Mazda were four or five hunting knives, duct tape,
gasoline, gun-cleaning equipment, binoculars, a
flashlight, a sleeping bag and several sets of rubber
and nylon gloves.
Police are looking into the likelihood that some
one was abetting Drexler, but Huntington said
that possibility is "remote."
"Most likely, he just didn't know about guns and
just picked up a magazine and started buying
stuff," Huntington said.
Hungtington said Indiana University police are
still trying to trace Drexler's movements since
Monday, April 13. They still do not know exactly
when he left Stanford for Indiana.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
— a division of the FBI — also is investigating to
determine where Drexler got the weapons.
