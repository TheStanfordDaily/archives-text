# Three Brooklynites, sweet rhyming and martial arts
## 
### Cheo H. Coker 
Just when you thought it was
safe, another innovative rap
group slipped through the door
crack.
Comin' straight outta Flat
bush, N.Y., the Fu-Schnickens
have been flyin' heads nation
wide with their back-to-back hit
singles "Ring The Alarm" and
"La Schmoove." The F.U. of the
group's name (For Unity) sym
bolizes the synthesis of various
lyrical techniques each member
contributes to the overall sound.
"We have the 'backwards and
forwards' rhyme style, we have
'hardcore looney 7 (mostly done
by Poc-Fu a.k.a. Prophet Over
seeing Creativity), we have 'Sub
stitution' (a way of using the
same word for two different
phrases), we have speed rappin'
and speed chattin', and just
straight-up hardcore styles," said
the group's very own Chip-Fu
(Creative Harmonies = Inter
twined Perfection) in a recent
phone interview.
The combination of word
play is topped off with a martial
arts influence that touches all
areas of the group's musical con
cepts. The uninitiated listener
might find the idea of three black
Brooklynites claiming Kung-Fu
movies as a major lyrical and
creative influence a bit corny,
but the longer one listens, the
more it makes sense.
"We wear the Asian Gi's to
symbolize the lyrical techniques
that we've mastered, " reiterated
Chip-Fu in the interview.
"In the same way in which
the actors [in Kung-Fu flicks J
were determined to learn new
fightin' skills, we were deter
mined to learn new lyrical and
production skills," he said.
On their debut LP, entitled
"For Unity — Don't Take It Per
sonal," the group manages to
mix humor, dance hall reggae
and straight-up hardcore
freestyles into one coherent
package. Featuring production
by A Tribe Called Quest, Dres
(from Blacksheep), Lyvio G. and
themselves, "F.U." is a funkee
display of lyrical agility smoothed
out with beats and basslines
that provide plenty of flavor.
"True Fu-Schnick," with its
riveting breakbeat and punctuat
ing bass tones, provides an
ample amount of space for each

rapper to flex his particular
rhyme style. Chip-Fu, with his
lightning-quick "substitution"
style, burns through the first
chorus. Poc and Moc-fu (Master
Of Oriental Culture) also con
tribute funky verses, the former
rhyming in "Hardcore Looney,"
the latter in a straight-up hard
core style. While it becomes evi
dent that speed rhyming is an

'In the same way
in which the
actors [in Kung-
Fu flicks] were
determined to
learn new fightin'
skills, we were
determined to
learn new lyrical
and production
skills.'
— Chip-Fu

important part of the group's
sound, it certainly isn't a gim
mick.
"When people come off like
that, and then talk about all we
do is speed rap, I say 'Yo, would
you like for us to freestyle,
cause man there's more styles
we can kick' Chip said.
"When they come to our shows
. . . and we just wreck shop,
from there on they keep their
mouths shut."
"Heavenly Father" is a funky
mix of hip-hop smoothed out by
R&B singing. While this track
has the most crossover appeal of
any track on the album, the pro
duction and lyrics don't sacrifice
the group's hardcore sensibili
ties.
"We made a song about (the
Lord], 'cause people mostly
thank the Almighty when they
win an award" Poc-Fu said. "I
like to thank God daily, for just
letting us see another day and
stuff like that."
"La Schmoove," featuring
Poc's childhood friend and label
mate Phife from ATCQ, is per

haps the alburn's fattest song.
Chip, Moc and Poc all display
great lyrical skills, while Phife
Dog makes a great cameo that
allows him to flip a couple of vers
es without stealing too much
attention away from the rest of
the group.
"Movie Scene," "Back Off,"
"Ring The Alarm" and "Check It
Out" stand out the most among
the album's other tracks. "Movie
Scene" is the one song the group
picked as most representive of
their musical ideas. It has it all:
humor (check the Kung-Fu movie
intro and sample), riggedy ruff
rhymin' on all three ends and
(surprise) backwards rhymin'.
"Ring The Alarm," the debut
single, is a solid remake of the
Tenor Saw dance-hall classic.
Like the best remakes, it uses ele
ments of the original formula, but
adds a different angle to it, in this
l case a flute sample and Chip's
rapid-fire delivery. In a word,

slammin'!
Finally, "Back Off" and "Check
It Out" (with Dres) feature more
hardcore styling over slimmed
down yet effective production.
"Back Off" is a simple combina
tion of "Tramp" and small parts
of "Atomic Dog."
What the track loses in origi
nality, the group makes up for
with impressive vocals. "Check It
Out," like "Back Off," is less of a
realized song than it is a freestyle
track. Over a basic drum track
and rumbling bassline, the trio,
with Dres, pass the mike while
giving the listener something
worth their while.
Overall, "F.U. — Don't Take It
Personal" is an album worth the
listener's attention and money.
The Fu-Schnickens somehow
find a way to mix a diverse array
of styles without losing focus.
"It's not just the speed rappin',
it's not just the raggamuffin', it's
crazy flavors . . . how we feel as
people, you know what I mean?"
Moc-Fu said.
