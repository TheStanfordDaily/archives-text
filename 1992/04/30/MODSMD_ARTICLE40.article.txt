# Three Brooklynites, sweet rhyming and martial arts
## 
### Cheo H. Coker 
Just when you thought it was
safe, another innovative rap
group slipped through the door
crack.
Comin' straight outta Flat
bush, N.Y., the Fu-Schnickens
have been flyin' heads nation
wide with their back-to-back hit
singles "Ring The Alarm" and
"La Schmoove." The F.U. of the
group's name (For Unity) sym
bolizes the synthesis of various
lyrical techniques each member
contributes to the overall sound.
"We have the 'backwards and
forwards' rhyme style, we have
'hardcore looney 7 (mostly done
by Poc-Fu a.k.a. Prophet Over
seeing Creativity), we have 'Sub
stitution' (a way of using the
same word for two different
phrases), we have speed rappin'
and speed chattin', and just
straight-up hardcore styles," said
the group's very own Chip-Fu
(Creative Harmonies = Inter
twined Perfection) in a recent
phone interview.
The combination of word
play is topped off with a martial
arts influence that touches all
areas of the group's musical con
cepts. The uninitiated listener
might find the idea of three black
Brooklynites claiming Kung-Fu
movies as a major lyrical and
creative influence a bit corny,
but the longer one listens, the
more it makes sense.
"We wear the Asian Gi's to
symbolize the lyrical techniques
that we've mastered, " reiterated
Chip-Fu in the interview.
"In the same way in which
the actors [in Kung-Fu flicks J
were determined to learn new
fightin' skills, we were deter
mined to learn new lyrical and
production skills," he said.
On their debut LP, entitled
"For Unity — Don't Take It Per
sonal," the group manages to
mix humor, dance hall reggae
and straight-up hardcore
freestyles into one coherent
package. Featuring production
by A Tribe Called Quest, Dres
(from Blacksheep), Lyvio G. and
themselves, "F.U." is a funkee
display of lyrical agility smoothed
out with beats and basslines
that provide plenty of flavor.
"True Fu-Schnick," with its
riveting breakbeat and punctuat
ing bass tones, provides an
ample amount of space for each

rapper to flex his particular
rhyme style. Chip-Fu, with his
lightning-quick "substitution"
style, burns through the first
chorus. Poc and Moc-fu (Master
Of Oriental Culture) also con
tribute funky verses, the former
rhyming in "Hardcore Looney,"
the latter in a straight-up hard
core style. While it becomes evi
dent that speed rhyming is an

in which the
actors [in Kung-
Fu flicks] were
determined to
learn new fightin'
skills, we were
determined to
learn new lyrical
and production
skills.'

important part of the group's
sound, it certainly isn't a gim
mick.
"When people come off like
that, and then talk about all we
do is speed rap, I say 'Yo, would
you like for us to freestyle,
cause man there's more styles
we can kick' Chip said.
"When they come to our shows
. . . and we just wreck shop,
from there on they keep their
mouths shut."
"Heavenly Father" is a funky
mix of hip-hop smoothed out by
R&B singing. While this track
has the most crossover appeal of
any track on the album, the pro
duction and lyrics don't sacrifice
the group's hardcore sensibili
ties.
"We made a song about (the
Lord], 'cause people mostly
thank the Almighty when they
win an award" Poc-Fu said. "I
like to thank God daily, for just
letting us see another day and
stuff like that."
"La Schmoove," featuring

mate Phife from ATCQ, is per
