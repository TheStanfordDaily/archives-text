## Cure refreshingly revisits earlier music 
### Paul Curthoys Editorial staff 
The masters of moody, post
punk era rock are back, and
they're as whiny as ever. With
the release of "Wish," the Cure
has returned to the haunting
melodies and brooding guitars of
their earlier work. Problem is,
they haven't moved much
beyond that style.
For long-time fans, "Wish" is
like a warm visit with an old
friend you haven't seen in a
while. Though the album does
take a significant step forward,
many of the songs hearken back
to the styles the group mastered
in their previous albums.
Unfortunately, the Cure has
relied a bit too heavily on the feel
and mood of "Head On The
Door" and "Disintegration," and
hasn't managed to forge as
strongly ahead as they did with
past releases.
Which doesn't mean at all
that "Wish" is a total flop. A
number of the songs contains
some stunning innovations and
charming lyrical developments.
A number of them don't, and
sound like clones of some of the
cuts on their previous albums.
Marked by sinuous melodies
and contemplative lyrics, tunes
like "Apart" and "A Letter To
Elise" return to the heavy-lidded,
brooding flavor of their "Disinte
gration" album. Continuing the
retrospective feel, guitar-based
grooves and a mild funk edge
carry songs like "Wendy Time"
back to the days of "Head On
The Door."
Despite all these trips down
memory lane, "Wish" does offer
some delightfully new sounds.
Gentle bongo drums thump in

the background of "To Wish
Impossible Things," and the
inspirational tone to lead singer
Robert Smith's voice is accompa
nied by the keen notes of a viola.
Strange bedfellows indeed for
the masters of the howling guitar
and the brooding bass, but the
lyrics are classic Cure. Smith
laments the tragedy of unsuc
cessful love, wailing out a a sense
of utter grief and loss: "But now
the sun shines cold . . . and all I
wish is gone away."
Songs like "Cut" and "End"
also shift away from standard
Cure fare. Distortion-sharpened
guitars and the thump of British
thrash drumming quicken the
pulse of the melodies in these
songs, adding a welcome edge of
modern musical style to the
album.
Startlingly, Smith comes for
ward with some happy lyrics on
the album. Yes, a cheerful Cure
song would be distinctly revolu
tionary, but something must've
brightened Smith's days, because
"Wish" has more cheery lyrics
than any of their previous
efforts.
For example, in "Doing The
Unstuck," Smith strikes out
against the grain of of their previ
ous melancholy, and actually
sings about kicking "the gloom"
out his life. "It's a perfect day for
making out/To wake up with a
smile without a doubt . . . let's
get happy!"
Musically, the song is enjoy
ably upbeat, but unexceptional,
and borrows heavily from ihc
previous styles the Cure has
developed.
One curious anomaly on the
new album is "Friday I'm In
Love." Unabashedly cheery and
unabashedly pop, it chants

merrily though the days of the
week to describe the process of
falling in love. But it lacks sub
stance, and bounces through a
skip-along melody and the
empty-headed, catchy lyrical
style of British bubble-gum pop.
There are even background
vocals.
Much like the R.E.M. tune
"Stand," "Friday" will probably
explode into commercial success.
But for a group that's capable of
much greater musical depth, it's

disappointing, even though you'll
probably hum it for the rest of
the day.
Despite the somewhat retro
spective feeling of running in
place, "Wish" is still an excellent
album. The precedent of inven
tiveness that the Cure estab
lished with their past three
albums is a hard feat to top, and
although they don't quite man
age it a fourth time in a row,
"Wish" is still a compilation of
brilliant and enjoyable music.
