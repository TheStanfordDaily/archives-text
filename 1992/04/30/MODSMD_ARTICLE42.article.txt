"I'd leave the swear words in."
That was Nigel Kennedy's only response
when he was asked if there were any changes
he would make to his autobiography after its
release last year.
Now, there are probably a host of concert
violinists that will swear in a private
moment; Kennedy likes to swear into live
microphones.
For that matter, any number of violinists
might be inclined to distribute their autobiog

It's little things like that which have the
classical music world in total consternation

Performs in it too, and we're talking Carnegie
Hall here. He does back-up for superstar rock
vocalists. In the liner notes to his classical
releases, he links Bach to Jimi Hendrix and
Brahms to Led Zeppelin.
In truth, more than a few people admit a
fair amount of pleasure at seeing so many
trussed-up classicos squirm uncomfortably at
the sight of this guy, almost as though he'd

smart ones realize that the man can play in
his boxer shorts so long as his musicianship
stands up to critical scrutiny.
In the present case, it does. This month,
EMI Classics has released Kennedy's account
of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto, that
well-worn chestnut that has been recorded by

every single concert artist that ever set bow to
string.
Understand, people are not prepared to like
this recording. Even those who appreciate
Kennedy's attempts to revolutionize the
industry found his earlier recordings of
Brahms and Vivaldi too far out. He came off
vulnerable and insecure.
In his hands, "The Four Seasons" was
bizarre â€” vulgar even, what with all the cocky
glissandos and off-the-wall cadenzas. And he
played the Brahms concerto so slow that peo
ple thought he was throwing a tantrum.
But in the Tchaikovsky we have something
utterly different, and this could be the start of
