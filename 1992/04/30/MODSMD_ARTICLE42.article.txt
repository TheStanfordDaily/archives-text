# Rebellious violinist rattles world of classical music
##

"I'd leave the swear words in."
That was Nigel Kennedy's only response
when he was asked if there were any changes
he would make to his autobiography after its
release last year.
Now, there are probably a host of concert
violinists that will swear in a private
moment; Kennedy likes to swear into live
microphones.
For that matter, any number of violinists
might be inclined to distribute their autobiog
raphy. But at age 31?
It's little things like that which have the
classical music world in total consternation
about this guy. He dresses in punk clothing.

Performs in it too, and we're talking Carnegie
Hall here. He does back-up for superstar rock
vocalists. In the liner notes to his classical
releases, he links Bach to Jimi Hendrix and
Brahms to Led Zeppelin.
In truth, more than a few people admit a
fair amount of pleasure at seeing so many
trussed-up classicos squirm uncomfortably at
the sight of this guy, almost as though he'd
brought a ham to a bar mitzvah. But the
smart ones realize that the man can play in
his boxer shorts so long as his musicianship
stands up to critical scrutiny.
In the present case, it does. This month,
EMI Classics has released Kennedy's account
of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto, that
well-worn chestnut that has been recorded by

every single concert artist that ever set bow to
string.
Understand, people are not prepared to like
this recording. Even those who appreciate
Kennedy's attempts to revolutionize the
industry found his earlier recordings of
Brahms and Vivaldi too far out. He came off
vulnerable and insecure.
In his hands, "The Four Seasons" was
bizarre — vulgar even, what with all the cocky
glissandos and off-the-wall cadenzas. And he
played the Brahms concerto so slow that peo
ple thought he was throwing a tantrum.
But in the Tchaikovsky we have something
utterly different, and this could be the start of
something pretty important.
Fresh and unaffected, Kennedy's
rendering gives us brilliant tech
nique, great emotional color and
a child-like enthusiasm that for
once doesn't come off as adoles
cent.
Under Okko Kamu, the Lon
don Symphony Orchestra adds
their own considerable insights,
and the digital reproduction is

the accustomed perfection.
The last guy to turn the classi
cal music world on ear was
Leonard Bernstein. People thought
he was crazy for trying to make
jazz have more say in concert
halls until he codified his ideas
into law.
They thought it quaint when
he undertook making classical
music more accessible to the mass
es. And then he single-handedly
put the New York Philharmonic
back in the black.
It could be that Kennedy is
going to have the same kind of

impact, if he can settle down.
Let's not forget that his Vivaldi
recording went to number one on
the British pop charts, and has
sold nearly two million record
ings. Current classical fashion dis
parages the achievement, chalking
it up to his four-day stubble on the
album cover, and some pretty
slick marketing. Maybe, but if this
guy can get people to listen to
Vivaldi, he deserves a standing
ovation.
Thing is, even the gray-hairs
are going to love his Tchaikovsky,
and that's exciting.
