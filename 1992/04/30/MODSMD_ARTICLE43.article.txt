## Witty 'Player' plays on glitz, glamor and sewer-side gore 
### Bryan Snyder Staff writer 
Hollywood — the name is syn
onymous with the glamor, glit2,
and power-brokering of making
movies. In"The Player," Robert
Altman's spoof of behind-the
scenes Hollywood, we see it all laid
out in front of us.
This two-and-a-half hour flick
takes a hard-edged, yet witty look at
how big-name movies get to be the
way they are. But the main plot
itself tends to be a bit drawn out

and confusing.
"The Player" stars Tim Robbins
as Graham Mill, the high-powered,
somewhat on-edge vice-president of
a fictitious movie studio. Mill's
posh existence suddenly goes awry
when he receives several threaten
ing postcards from a frustrated
movie writer, whom Mill apparent
ly turned down for a script.
Mill suspects David Kahane
(Vincent d'Onofrio) of sending the
notes and nervously offers him a
studio job, which Kahane, still in a
furor, declines.

After their meeting, Kahane
turns up dead in a sewer, and Mill is
seen as the most obvious murder
suspect. Whoopi Goldberg, with her
characteristic wit, plays the Pasade
na police detective investigating
Kahane's murder. Moreover, Mill
starts to date Kahane's mysteriously
reserved girlfriend (Greta Scacchi).

'The Player' looks
at the superficiali
ty and stressed-out
existence of Holly
wood

The audience sees the couple's
romance develop as Mill gets still
more postcards threatening his life
and is questioned for Kahane's
death. It does get a bit confusing
trying to figure out who is writing
these notes and why, but it comes
to a surprise resolution in the end.
The best parts of the movie, how
ever, are not in the story line. The far
cical way 'The Player" looks at the
superficiality and stressed-out exis
tence of Hollywood movie life is what
makes the"The Player" enjoyable.
In one scene, Mill's studio col
league, played by Peter Gallagher,
has to go to an Alcoholics Anony
mous meeting. When Mill says he
didn't know he had a drinking prob
lem, Gallagher's character responds
"I don't. But that's where all the
deals are made these days."
Also, when the movie writers
decide on what kind of a film to
make, they look to the newspaper
for ideas. The president of the movie
corporation suggests they "add a few
stars, slap on a happy ending and
the script will write itself."
While "The Player" plays on our
Hollywood stereotypes, it still
comes off well as a spoof. See this
movie if you want to laugh at the
people behind the big screen. Who
knows? It might even be true.
