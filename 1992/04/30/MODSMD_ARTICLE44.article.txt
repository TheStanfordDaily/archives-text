# 'White Sands' a silicon desert
## 
### Victor Haseman Staff writer 
The commercial starts with a
spectacular aerial shot of the
Anasazi ruins of New Mexico. It
then skips back and forth in a
mqntage-like sequence highlight
ing Willem Dafoe, Mickey Rourke
and Sam Jackson.
With idle promises of action
packed thrills, "White Sands"
comes close to falling on its face,
proving that more attention
should be paid to film quality than
film profit.
Directed by Roger Donaldson
("No Way Out," "Marie"), "White
Sands" is the story of a New Mexi
can sheriff caught up in a crooked
FBI sting operation.
It all starts when an FBI agent
turns up dead in the middle of the
Anasazi ruins with a .38 revolver
in one hand and a half-million dol
lars in die other. Bored of the mel
low sheriff's life, Ray Dolezal
(Dafoe) pounces on the opportuni
ty to solve the crime.
However, with little time to
gain his bearings, he's pitched
head-first into partnership with
gun-runner Gorman Lennox

(Rourke). Only FBI agent Greg
Meeker (Jackson) can help him out
of the jam — provided he's not in
on it.

"White Sands" comes
close to falling on its
face, proving that
more attention
should be paid to
film quality than film
profit.

As a film treatment, the mon
strous potential of "White Sands"
is apparent. However, the final
script only succeeds in maiming
important characters.
At times, Dafoe, Jackson,
Rourke and Mary Elizabeth Mas
trantonio (who plays Lane Bodine,
Dolezal's unwanted mistress)
deliver their lines with droid-like
enthusiasm, making them little
more than a waste of breath.

Nevertheless, important to the
film's appeal is its attempt to
place the audience in Dafoe's
shoes, never letting him know
any more than they do. Effective
for the film's first 30 minutes,
the format later loses its appeal,
leaving out too much of the
peripheral action to be truly use
ful.
Furthermore, the film's roller
coaster feel seems entirely
invented. In more than one
instance, Dolezal makes deci
sions based on open-ended, and
therefore unreliable, information.
Low-quality dialogue keeps
things from running smoothly.
The only elements to escape
unscathed are the photography
arranged by Peter Menzies and
editing designed by Nicholas Beau
man, both credits to Donaldson's
vision. Stunning scenery com
bined with seamless editing, espe
cially in the desert sequences, cre
ate an ambience ironic to the
film's central themes of money
and war.
Nonetheless, "White Sands"
escapes as a decent entertainment
piece, despite its misuse of talent.
Wait for its video release.
