# 'Ida' suffers from slapstick script
## 
### Travis Farr 
Despite a noble attempt, the Stanford Savoyards
are unable to squeeze new life out of Gilbert and Sul
livan's far-from-timeless fairy tale "Princess Ida."
Their recently-opened spring production suffers
partially from performance problems, but mostly
because things that were amusing when Queen Vic
toria was on the throne just don't have the same
punch today.
The play opens in the Castle Hildebrand on the
day when the son of King Hildebrand, Hilarion, is to
be married to King Gama's daughter, Princess Ida.
Gama, a crooked and nasty king, arrives with his
sons at the castle as planned, but they haven't
brought Princess Ida. It is soon made known that she
has shut herself up in one of her father's castles and
started her own women's university.
Enraged, Hildebrand imprisons Gama and his
sons, and Hilarion sets off with his two sidekicks to
win his bride.
The Prince's adventure is a series of ostensibly
amusing escapades that take him deep under cover as
a female university student, opening the door for
plenty of "Three's Company"-type mistaken-identity
jokes.
Gama and Hildebrand show up, a battle is nar
rowly avoided, and Princess Ida's fate is finally decid
ed by a duel between Hilarion & company and
Gama's sons.
It's simply unfortunate that the Savoyards chose
"Princess Ida" as their subject. The writing of the play
is utterly devoid of wit â€” Gilbert forgoes cleverness
and subtlety, anchoring his humor instead on People
Falling Over and People Who Are Really Dumb.
It's Larry, Moe and Curly in tunics, and if you like
that kind of humor, you'll probably enjoy the produc
tion. Whenever any tiling genuinely clever does hap

pen, such deliberate attention is called to it that the
effect is lost. There might as well be rim shots after
each joke.
Sullivan's music has aged a good deal more grace
fully than Gilbert's humor. The music is light-heart
ed, and the orchestra, led by Jun Nakabayashi, is also
quite good.
There is also some good singing in the play. Claire
Kelm, who plays Princess Ida, and Marco Remedios,
who is Hilarion, both have good voices which at times
dispel the neighborhood-theater aura that clings to

the production. Lady Blanche, played by Carol Ann
Lemon, also stands out.
Those aside, the entire furious women's chorus
sounds like they're singing from behind a thick glass
wall, and a few of die minor characters could use a
quick suck at the oxygen tank before their solos.
The acting was fully as good as necessary, since
most of the comedy's characters are no more three
dimensional than the castle walls of the set. Hilarion,
Cyril (Bob Bergman) and Florian (Ross King) do a
good job bringing life to their flat characters.
The play also lacks the excitement that comes
from creativity and innovation. The Savoyards take it
from page to stage without changing or interpreting it.
The production is well-meaning and hard-working,
but despite obvious effort and some talent, it comes
out somewhat bland and corny.
