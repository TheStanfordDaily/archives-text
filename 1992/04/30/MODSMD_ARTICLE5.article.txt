# Alcohol linked to many campus rapes

To many students, alcohol and sex
go hand-in-hand. A glass of wine gets
someone in the mood, and a six-pack
lets down the defenses.
But using alcohol as a "social lubri
cant" can have harsh consequences.
Alcohol played a part in almost every
one of the sexual assaults reported to
Cowell this year, according to Gail
Prichard, director of the Cowell Sexual
Assault Response and Recovery Team.

She said about 15 sexual assaults have
been reported since October.
"It may sound simplistic, but alcohol
interferes with judgment," said Elise
Lenox, director of Project R 2 ISC.
"When people drink, they frequently do
things they ordinarily wouldn't do, or
things get carried further than they
originally planned."
Lance McDaniel, one of the senior
class presidents, agreed. "People are
much more likely to get together when
they're drinking," he said. "A lot of
times, couples wouldn't get together if

they both weren't drunk."
It is precisely this tendency — to use
alcohol as an aphrodisiac of sorts —
which Lenox finds destructive.
"People often use alcohol as a social
lubricant," Lenox said. "But if you have
to have a couple of drinks to loosen up
and talk about it, you shouldn't be hav
ing sex."
California law states that inten
tionally preventing a woman from
resisting sex — by providing alcohol,


Mimi Kuo — Daily
for example — is rape.
But some say American society
sends the opposite message. The
mass media, and alcohol adver
tisements in particular, frequent
ly link sex with drinking. This is a
skewed representation that plays
a subtle role in encouraging sexu
al assault, Lenox said.
"Because of the way ads are
made, we come to associate alco
hol with sex," Lenox said. "Ads
don't sell alcohol, they sell fan
tasies — fantasies that are real
attractive."
The campus scene
The expectation that sex is a
natural outcome of drinking,
combined with the physical
effects of alcohol, creates the
potential for danger in almost any
drinking situation. And on a col
lege campus, opportunities to
drink arise frequently.
"I don't think the campus envi
ronment necessarily encourages
sexual assault, but in many situa
tions you're encouraged to drink,"
said Virginia Duplessis, a fresh
man who has facilitated work
shops on alcohol and sexual
assault. "And alcohol is so
entrenched in our whole idea of
sexuality."
Campus events often perpetu
ate the idea that sex and alcohol
should be intertwined, according
to Susan Epstein, coordinator of
sexual assault prevention educa
tion. She said she "was asked to
be a Rush hostess freshman year,
and the invitation read, 'We pro
vide the alcohol, you provide the
women.' . . . Needless to say, I
didn't go."
Another danger, particularly
prominent with Stanford stu

dents, is that many come to col
lege lacking experience with alco
hol and are thrust into an alcohol
dominated environment.
"Poor freshmen learn the hard
way," said Lenox, adding that
students who don't have prior
experience with alcohol frequent
ly learn a lot about the drug with
in the first three months of
school.
Leslie, a Stanford student who
said she was raped after blacking
out at a dorm party freshman
year, said she was then unaware of
the effect alcohol would have on
her.
She would drink until she
blacked out, but would still func
tion well enough that others
didn't realize she was drunk. "I
didn't really drink in high school,
so I didn't even know that was
possible."
Redefining consent
Not too long ago, it was consid
ered OK for a man to get sex any
way he could. The well-known
scene in the movie "Animal
House," in which a college stu
dent debates whether to have sex
with an unconscious 13-year old,
came across as funny when the
movie was released in the late
'70s.
But behavior seen as pre
dictable and acceptable 10 years
ago leads to anger and possible
prosecution on college campuses
these days.
"We're trying to redefine what
consent means," Prichard said.
"If the victim is intoxicated and
the perpetrator isn't . . . Well, for
a person to assume a non-answer
is sufficient, it's not."
California penal code has a sec
tion that specifically addresses
having sex with a person who is

unconscious or otherwise inca
pable of expressing consent,
according to Margot Smith of the
Santa Clara County District
Attorney's Office, who said her
office has "charged that section
before."
"It's been my experience that
young girls are purposely put into
that condition so the guys can
have sex with them," Smith said.
"I think most guys know when a

girl is loaded."
But there are also cases where
neither the man nor the woman
set out to coerce the other, and
both regretted having sex.
"We've had a situation where a
female wanted to report a date
rape, but both parties were drink
ing freely, and it was basically a
situation that just got out of
hand," said Capt. Marvin Moore
of the Stanford Police Depart

ment.
"Maybe it went further than
either wanted it to go, but neither
was purposely trying to manipu
late the other."
Epstein said alcohol use influ
ences men and women's interac
tion in ways that can lead to rape.
"Alcohol can make you more
aggressive," Epstein said. "And it
can also make it harder to recog
nize when a situation gets uncom

fortable."
"But I don't want to give the
impression that if you don't drink
you won't rape or you can't be
raped," Epstein added.
Duplessis agreed. "It's not
purely the alcohol's fault," she
said. "But alcohol hinders com
munication. If you're not commu
nicating and not respecting
another person's wishes, that's
when it turns into assault."
