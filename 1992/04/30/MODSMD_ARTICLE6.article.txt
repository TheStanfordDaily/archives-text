# 'I vaguely remember fighting with him'

Leslie can't remember the
first time she had sex.
A freshman at the time, she
says she was raped after black
ing out at a dorm party where
beer was free-flowing and
drinking was encouraged, if
not expected.
"I vaguely remember fighting
with him and pushing him away,
but not being strong enough to
keep saying no," she recounts
cautiously, the painful memory
still vivid five years later.
"I really didn't realize it was
rape at the time," Leslie says.
"All I thought was that I was so
stupid and it was my fault
because I got really drunk."
"To some extent I still
blame myself because I don't
know what I was doing or how
I was acting (after I blacked
out)," she says.
Like many Stanford fresh
man, Leslie had never gotten
drunk in high school and did
not know how her body would
react to alcohol. "The thing is,
I drink until I black out, but I
still function really well, so
other people don't realize I'm
drunk," Leslie says."I didn't
know that (then). I didn't even
know that was possible."
Leslie didn't mention the
incident to anyone at the time,
for fear they would blame her.
