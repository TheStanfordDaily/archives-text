# 'I vaguely remember fighting with him'
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Leslie can't remember the
first time she had sex.
A freshman at the time, she
says she was raped after black
ing out at a dorm party where
beer was free-flowing and
drinking was encouraged, if
not expected.
"I vaguely remember fighting
with him and pushing him away,
but not being strong enough to
keep saying no," she recounts
cautiously, the painful memory
still vivid five years later.
"I really didn't realize it was
rape at the time," Leslie says.
"All I thought was that I was so
stupid and it was my fault
because I got really drunk."
"To some extent I still
blame myself because I don't
know what I was doing or how
I was acting (after I blacked
out)," she says.
Like many Stanford fresh
man, Leslie had never gotten
drunk in high school and did
not know how her body would
react to alcohol. "The thing is,
I drink until I black out, but I
still function really well, so
other people don't realize I'm
drunk," Leslie says."I didn't
know that (then). I didn't even
know that was possible."
Leslie didn't mention the
incident to anyone at the time,
for fear they would blame her.
Nor did she confront the man who had
raped her. "He was a friend of mine,"
she explains. "And afterward I couldn't
deal with him at all. I couldn't even look
at him."
After that, she became more cau
tious around alcohol, drinking less fre
quently and in safer environments. But
her precautions didn't prevent a similar
incident from occurring two years later.
Waking up the morning after her
21st birthday, Leslie expected to have a
hangover. But she wasn't prepared to
find herself in a friend's bed, with
bruises all over her body, "wearing
nothing but [her] socks."
"I don't remember much that hap
pened," during the evening, Leslie says.
"I don't remember going back to his
house.. . . You go out on your 21st
birthday with your friends, and you
expect them to take care of you."
Leslie never found out where the
bruises came from, and she never con
fronted her assailant, who she described
as a "close friend" whom she had trusted.
"Its taken a long time for me not to
just think of it and cry," Leslie says.
"It's like the death of my innocence. I
came here as a really innocent farm girl,
excited about learning. Well, I didn't
expect to learn the things I did."
For Leslie, the road to emotional
freedom has been long and difficult,
marked by gradual self-discovery and
acceptance. After five years — includ
ing two years of therapy — she says she
has finally accepted the incident as a
part of her identity.
Speaking forcefully, Leslie recalls
her emotional turmoil, which still rises
occasionally to the surface, and the
insecurity that lingers just beneath her
tough exterior.
"It's taken a long time for me to be
able to say anything to anyone," Leslie
says.
At first, "I was so removed from it. I
refused to allow it to be something that
related to me. I even wrote a paper
about a friend who was assaulted — I
was able to make it something that

'I came here as a really
innocent farm girl, excited
about learning. Well, I
didn't expect to learn the
things I did/

wasn't attached to me."
After reading a lot of material on sex
ual assault, Leslie began to see her own
experience in the hypothetical situa
tions they outlined, and gradually came
to recognize the incidents as rape.
"When I realized what had really hap
pened, I was just in shock. I was really
angry because I had always thought it
was my fault."
"For years, I had taken all these
things in my life, crumpled them up and
thrown them in the back of my psychic
closet. Then I took them out — and
realized how big they were. They were
so big they wouldn't fit back inside."
"You can't just go on with your life
and ignore [things like that], because
your life*B not going to go on," she says.
The most frustrating thing about
dealing with the assaults, Leslie says, is
that the memory continues to affect her
in unwelcome ways — infecting her
thoughts and governing her actions,
often preventing her from developing
healthy relationships with men.
The first rape "happened six years ago,
and it still affects how I relate to guys,"
Leslie says. "I'm continually afraid of
what's going on and what's going to hap
pen next. Sometimes, I'm afraid to even
talk to guys because I don't know what its
leading to. I'm on guard all the time."
"It's hard to (tell a boyfriend about
my history) and then say, 'You're gonna
have to put up with the fact that that's
how I feel.' That's so much to ask of
someone. It takes a special person to be
able to deal with that."
Over the years, Leslie's fear and pain
have given way to indignation and
anger. And while she still encounters
men whose persistence makes her
uncomfortable, she no longer feels pres

sured to give in.
" Just because I spend time talking to
a guy, it doesn't mean I want more,"
Leslie says."I have to be conscious of
who I talk to?" she asks. "That's crazy."
"When you say no, the guy should
back off and respect that. You shouldn't
have to continually say, 'No. No. No.
No. No. No. No.' Its difficult to keep
that up even when you're sober."
"And if alcohol is involved, you don't
have the same kind of strength," Leslie
continues. "It's much more difficult
when you're drunk to think of yourself
and what you want, as opposed to what
someone else wants you to do."
Referring to a recent incident, when
a man she talked to at a party wouldn't
leave her alone, Leslie says,"I really do
feel, in essence, that I could have socked
him. But that's not the kind of person I
am. I'm not a violent person."
Thinking back to the man who raped
her freshman year, Leslie grows pensive
and resentful. "I think my biggest mis
take is that, in essence, I gave him the
license to do it (to someone else), because
I didn't make him confront what he did."
"You know, I don't even know
whether he even realizes what he did,"
she continues. "I don't know if he real
izes I wasn't kidding when I was fight
ing with him. I don't know if he even
realizes it wasn't a joke."
"Nonconsensual sex is rape and
everyone needs to accept that," she
says. "Whether or not you get away
with it doesn't make it all right. It's a
moral thing. Not a law thing."
