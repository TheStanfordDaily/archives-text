# Assault investigations muddled by role of alcohol
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
"Let's say two students get drunk at a
party," said Capt. Marvin Moore of the Stan
ford Police Department, introducing a hypo
thetical alcohol-related sexual assault case.
"Both are drinking, and they switch off
going up to the bar to get each other drinks.
Then they have a sexual affair. Well, if the
woman later says she was raped, how do you
determine who is at fault?"
Although the woman may have been too
drunk to make a decision about sex, it would
not be clear that the man purposely inca
pacitated her with alcohol, Moore said,
adding that this would be one of the less
clear cases.
"We try to evaluate the intent and deter
mine how clearly we can separate out the use
of alcohol as a ploy," said Moore, whose
department investigates two to four date-rape
cases per year, many of which involve alcohol.
"But if both people were very drunk, how
do you determine who consented and who
didn't?" Moore said. "It comes down to those
fine lines of who was drunker."
California law states that diminishing a
person's ability to consent or refuse sexual
activity, including through the provision of
alcohol, is rape.

But for police officials investigating a
reported acquaintance rape, the situation is
rarely cut and dried. "Occasionally we get a
case that's really clear cut, where one person
clearly intended to take advantage of the
other — for instance, if the woman was
unconscious," Moore said.
But usually the details are sketchier, and
police must sort through conflicting
accounts of the incident.
"It's very difficult to determine alcohol as
the sole grounds for a rape charge," Moore
said."
To determine whether an assault took
place, officers must establish whether inter
course took place; whether the woman con
sented; whether she was physically capable
of consenting; and whether the man pur
posely prevented her, through the use of
alcohol, from resisting.
"One of the most difficult parts of investi
gating date rape cases is that you just don't
always have a lot of objective facts," Moore
said. "Most of the information we get during
interviews is very subjective."
"It's difficult to find anything you can
hang your hat on."
To piece together what actually happened
during the alleged assault, police officers
first try to collect physical evidence, such as
body hairs or seminal fluids on clothes or

bedding, Moore said. But most date rapes
are reported at least several days later —
when both the victim and alleged perpetra
tor have showered and changed clothes — so
this material can no longer be obtained.
Next, officers conduct extensive inter
views with the people involved and any other
witnesses who may provide additional evi
dence, Moore said.
In many cases, the police are able to col
lect enough information to support the
charges and send a referral to the district
attorney, Moore said.
The district attorney then determines
whether there is enough evidence to support
a case.
"It's really a convoluted process," Moore
said, adding that most cases require extensive
interviews to determine their particular cir
cumstances and subtleties.
And Sgt. Dal Bandy of the Stanford Police
Department agreed. "We have to check who
the alcohol was provided by and determine
whether the suspect was aware that the per
son was that drunk. You have to try to judge
just how much effect the alcohol had. It gets
more complicated," he said.
Moore said police look into details such as
the setting in which the alleged assault took
place, who was providing the drinks and the
victim's age and experience with alcohol.
