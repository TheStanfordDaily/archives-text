Dear
This letter is written with the intent to express the outrage and disgust that
we feel with the recent decision in the case of Rodney King versus the Los
Angeles Police Department. We, members of the Stanford community, in
agreement with our brothers and sisters in South Central Los Angeles, see
this verdict as a great miscarriage of justice which follows in the deplorable
legacy of Emmett Till, Medgar Evers, and the Scottsboro incident — the
legacy of allowing the police to be above the law. The verdict of "Not Guilty"
represents for us a complete failure of our justice system to acknowledge the
blatant use of excessive force, motivated by racial prejudices, in Rodney
King's arrest. We question whether the same type of action would have been
taken by these police officers had Rodney King been a white man; and, if the
action was the same, we question whether the jury would have given an
identical verdict. Once again, after putting our faith in the police
departments and judicial system (whose job is to "protect and serve"), we
have been disappointed.
We demand that you, as a government official and representative of the
people, speak out and work diligently to make sure that this incident is not
dismissed as an isolated incident of police harassment and brutality. There
has always been a systematic targeting of minorities by the police, especially
in urban areas. Police brutality and concerns of urban stability are issues to
which you as a steward of the people must direct your attention and
resources, because we as citizens do plan to keep these frustrations in the
minds of the public, the same public that elected you and your colleagues to
your offices.
Rather than merely looking for short-term solutions to the violence that
presently plagues the streets of Los Angeles (which is only a microcosm of
the eruption of frustrations felt all over the nation) we must focus on the
issues which cause these frustrations: slow police response, police brutality,
negative media portrayal of minorities, and the lack of substantial economic
and political power. All of these give rise to a general level of hopelessness
and despair over the ability (and lack of desire) of America's institutions to
effectively deal with these problems and the inherent racism that pervades
the system. Again, we implore you to utilize the power we have given you —
for all the people, instead of against the people.
Respectfully,
