SAN FRANCISCO - What
started as a peaceful protest rally
yesterday soon erupted into a
widespread, multiracial riot in
which hundreds were arrested
and vandals destroyed stores
throughout the city.
Protesters gathered in
response to the Rodney King
beating trial yerdicts and set out
from the California State Build
ing, marching to the Nob Hill
area and heading down to the
Financial District.
Another group of demonstra
tors closed the San Francisco-
Oakland Bay Bridge and shut
down major highways into the city
for a time, according to the Associ
ated Press. The AP estimated that
500 people were arrested in the
city and 400 at the bridge.
Mayor Frank Jordan declared
a state of emergency and imposed
a curfew last night after
protesters began looting, starting
fires and smashing windows
throughout the city.
"I think the protest was good
at first, but then it got violent and
looting started, and then it was
pointless," said Chad Nicely, 19.
Police first stopped about 1,000
protesters at the intersection of
Taylor and Ellis streets. As offi
cers tried to disperse the crowd,
protesters started running up the
street, shouting, "To the top of the
hill, to the top of the hill."
As people marched up the
street toward Huntington Park
on Nob Hill, the violence
increased. Some protesters hurled
stones at windows and cars, tried
to kick in doors and overturned
newspaper stands.
But not all of the protesters
supported the violent actions.
As a group of young black men
attempted to overturn a light-blue
BMW, another black man shouted
at them, "No, don't do this. Stop!
Get the fuck outta here!"
As three helicopters hovered
overhead, police blocked off the
area at the top of the hill and
trapped many protesters. Police
declared everyone blocked by the
barricade under arrest.
Although armed and dressed
in riot gear, some police officers
wore frightened expressions as
demonstrators advanced on them.
"Unlike war protests, the
anger is directed at [the police],
so I think they're scared," said
John O'Rourke, a freshman at
San Francisco State.
In Huntington Park, a police
officer hit a woman in the fore
arm with a night stick.
"He hit me because I was
standing there, and I told him to

A San Francisco Police motorcycle burns on Market Street last night after protesters set fire to it and looted several stores in the downtown
area. Police said at least 900 people were arrested in San Francisco, and five police officers were injured.

let go of a woman he was holding
to protect himself from the rest of
the people that were threatening
him," the woman said.
Amy Henson, 24, said, "I think
the world's gone crazy. I live in the
neighborhood and in the past two
weeks I've had the windshield of
my car smashed, the top ripped and
the tires slashed. I moved to Nob
Hill because it was a safe place."
An officer preventing a man
from passing the barricade told
him, "You have no way of doing
anything, there are no comebacks,
no anything. The only people that
can have a comeback are us."
As the crowd marched down
Sacramento Avenue toward the
Financial District, some demon
strators broke the windows of a
white limousine heading uptown,
scratched cars parked in the
street, overturned an Audi and
smashed more car windows.
Police were stationed at an inter
section as the crowd approached.
But just before it reached the police
line — on the corner of Grant and
Sacramento — two black men
dressed in white robes joined hands
and blocked the way.
"Turn around. Turn around,"
they shouted. Marchers obeyed
and avoided any confrontation.
One of the men, Monty Flip
pin, said he had been beaten by
police officers, and displayed his
bleeding hands. "We just want to
have a peaceful demonstration of
the justice system," he said. "We
want people to know this is an
unjust acquittal."
The other man, Zackery Brown,
said, "This goes to show you that
anything can start out peaceful,
but people are angry and they
want to show the way they feel."
The march proceeded to the
Bank of America building, where
protesters hurled rocks at the
large glass windows and spray
painted anti-police graffiti on the
marble exterior.
On Market Street, police chased
the crowd — which had shrunk to
about 200— after some started
looting and setting small fires.
At the intersection of Market
and Powell streets, police sur
rounded and arrested a crowd of
about 70 people.
One block down, at the other
side of a police barricade, more peo
ple had arrived. But protesting by
then had given way to vandalism
and looting, both in the Market
Street and Union Square areas.
Habitat Leather, an upscale
clothing store, was one of the

stores robbed by protesters.
"We were just walking. I didn't
see anything unusual, when all of a
sudden a bunch of people came run
ning out with jackets in their arms,"
said Clara Boyden, 23. "A girl about
17 had a baby in her arm and her
bottle in her mouth. Her other arm
was stuffed with leather jackets."
Moments later, a man set a
police motorcycle on fire.
"A guy ran over, knocked the
motorcycle over, set it on fire and
some cop grabbed him and beat
his ass," said a woman who had
witnessed the act.
The motorcycle burned as the
crowd cheered and celebrated. A
previously tense but calm situa
tion turned chaotic, and police
dispersed the crowd and blocked
every intersection in the area.
A 50-year-old woman said she
was outraged at the police, who
she claimed had hit her three
times with their night sticks.
"This is not the country I grew
up in,"the woman said. "I want
to be exported. Fuck this place."
BART stations were closed in
the downtown area and in Berke
ley. Looting continued in some
places throughout the Union
Square and Market Street areas.
