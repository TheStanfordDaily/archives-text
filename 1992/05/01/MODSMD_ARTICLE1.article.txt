SAN FRANCISCO - What
started as a peaceful protest rally
yesterday soon erupted into a
widespread, multiracial riot in
which hundreds were arrested
and vandals destroyed stores
throughout the city.
Protesters gathered in
response to the Rodney King
beating trial yerdicts and set out
from the California State Build
ing, marching to the Nob Hill
area and heading down to the
Financial District.
Another group of demonstra
tors closed the San Francisco-
Oakland Bay Bridge and shut
down major highways into the city
for a time, according to the Associ
ated Press. The AP estimated that
500 people were arrested in the
city and 400 at the bridge.
Mayor Frank Jordan declared
a state of emergency and imposed
a curfew last night after
protesters began looting, starting
fires and smashing windows
throughout the city.
"I think the protest was good
at first, but then it got violent and
looting started, and then it was
pointless," said Chad Nicely, 19.
Police first stopped about 1,000
protesters at the intersection of
Taylor and Ellis streets. As offi
cers tried to disperse the crowd,
protesters started running up the
street, shouting, "To the top of the
hill, to the top of the hill."
As people marched up the
street toward Huntington Park
on Nob Hill, the violence
increased. Some protesters hurled
stones at windows and cars, tried
to kick in doors and overturned
newspaper stands.
But not all of the protesters
supported the violent actions.
As a group of young black men
attempted to overturn a light-blue
BMW, another black man shouted
at them, "No, don't do this. Stop!
Get the fuck outta here!"
As three helicopters hovered
overhead, police blocked off the
area at the top of the hill and
trapped many protesters. Police
declared everyone blocked by the
barricade under arrest.
Although armed and dressed
in riot gear, some police officers
wore frightened expressions as
demonstrators advanced on them.
"Unlike war protests, the
anger is directed at [the police],
so I think they're scared," said
John O'Rourke, a freshman at
San Francisco State.
In Huntington Park, a police
officer hit a woman in the fore
arm with a night stick.
"He hit me because I was
standing there, and I told him to
