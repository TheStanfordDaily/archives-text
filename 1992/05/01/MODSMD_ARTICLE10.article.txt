Former police chief Joseph McNamara joined fac
ulty members and University President Donald
Kennedy yesterday in condemning the verdicts in
the Rodney King beating trial and expressing con
cern over the ensuing riots.
McNamara, a Hoover research fellow who was
San Jose's chief of police until last year, expressed
dismay at the acquittals but added that violence is
not the answer.
"I just think it's a shocking verdict. It's such a
disastrous verdict," McNamara said. "But the riot
ing is terrible. It doesn't help anyone."
McNamara, who called for Los Angeles Police
Chief Daryl Gates to resign after the videotaped
beating became public, said he believes Gates should
leave his post immediately instead of in June or July.
"What needs to be done now is for all the leaders
and citizens together to condemn the kind of con
duct in the tape and the verdict that came out, but
also to speak against the resulting violence," he said.
Sally Dickson, associate dean of the Law School
and a resident fellow in Ujamaa, said she was
"shocked" by the jury's decision.
"I have not seen a time since the '60s when peo
ple are so outraged," she said. "I saw so many stu
dents cry today."

Dickson said Ujamaa residents are angry about
the verdict.
"Even for people who think that life may be com
fortable here at Stanford, for African-Americans, life
cannot be comfortable anywhere," she said.
Residents have planned "a lot of constructive

activities" in response to the verdict, including
today's noon rally at the Law School, Dickson said.
In addition, she said, a panel of Law School facul
ty members will speak about the King case at 3 p.m.
at the school.
Dickson said that although she does not agree
with the rioting, she understands the motivations
behind it.
"I don't condone some of the acts occurring now,
but what do people do when they're frustrated and

angry?" she asked.
According to Dickson, the riots are only partially
due to the King incident, and are also about long
term problems in the black community, such as high
unemployment and the lack of adequate education.
Something positive could "maybe" come from the
rioting, she said. For example, the riots after Martin
Luther King Jr. was assassinated in the 1960s
"showed the country the desperation people were
feeling," Dickson said.
But she said conditions within the black commu
nity "have gotten worse" since the 19605, and she
was "not as optimistic any more" that good will
come from the riots.
Kennedy addressed the King issue at yesterday's
Faculty Senate meeting. "No one can view the result
with anything except a sense of deep foreboding," he
said.
Kennedy told the group he wanted to "acknowl
edge the mood of despair and disappointment and
frustration many people are feeling after the news
from Southern California" and "praise the students
for finding ways to express themselves forcefully and
dramatically while not permitting their frustrations
to boil out in inappropriate ways."
Lucius Barker, a political science professor who
teaches a class called "African Americans and the
Political System," said he was "quite disturbed by
what the situation in Los Angeles implies about
what is happening in the country."

Barker and Political Science Prof. Terry Karl
organized an informal faculty meeting to discuss the
King case, scheduled for 9:30 a.m. today.
"This is not an official faculty meeting," Barker
said. "It's a spontaneous kind of reaction to some
thing that is deeply disturbing. We thought it would
be a good idea to get a few people together to see how
we can indicate our deep concern about what is going
on.
Barker said he hoped something concrete, such as
a town meeting or a statement that could be pub
lished in newspapers, would come out of the meet
ing.
"Hopefully, this will contribute to taking some
meaningful steps to overcoming racism and seeing
that these serious problems get the preferred place
they deserve on the nation's agenda," he said.
History Prof. Albert Camarillo, who grew up in
Los Angeles, said he was "really surprised by the
verdict," and thought it showed the "deep racial divi
sions" present in America today.
Camarillo said he felt the rioting shows an
"increased sense of resentment" among blacks in
Los Angeles.
"It's a warning that these divisions based on race
and class are deeper than we thought and have the
potential to ignite," Camarillo said.
