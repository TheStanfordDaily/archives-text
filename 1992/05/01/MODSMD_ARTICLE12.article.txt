Financial Aid Advocacy
Office, lacking support,
cannot simply atrophy

STUDENTS MAY LOSE an
important voice in their
futures if the Financial Aid
Advocacy Office is unable to
recruit more students to run it
next year.
Only two students have turned
in applications for the office's six
positions — which must all be
filled if the office is to continue as
an effective lobbying group for
financial aid.
Already troubling is the lack of a
student voice in the form of a
Council of Presidents, which Stan
ford voters — at least 28 percent of
them — axed in favor of nothing.
Without a group committed to
representing student sentiment on
financial aid and acting as a liason
between students and the Univer
sity, unthinkable scenarios such as
the abolition of need-blind admis
sions may become realities.
Incoming University President
Gerhard Casper has made several
questionable statements on finan
cial aid — no matter whether he
couches them in terms of hoping to
make people "think critically"
about the issue.
Casper has offered as long-term
solutions ideas such as disman
tling the entire financial aid sys
tem and lowering tuition, and has
said the administration "needs to
rethink" how tuition and financial
aid should work.
While he says he is firmly com
mitted to need-blind admissions
and the current financial aid sys
tem, his earlier comments make it
clear that he is certainly not as
committed to the idea of financial
aid — a stance that should be
carefully examined in the coming
year, as rising college costs
demand greater attention to
financial aid.
Policy decisions on financial aid

must address the needs of stu
dents before all else. The debate
over financial aid must not become
mired in ideological rhetoric that
works well in theory, but leaves
students cold.
The Advocacy Office is one orga
nization that can increase stu
dents' awareness of financial aid
issues, and keep administrators
and legislators informed of stu
dent sentiment.
Founded this year, the Advocacy
Office already has made its pres
ence felt on campus and national
ly-
When the re-authorization of
the 1967 Higher Education Act —
which sets up a budget for federal
money to be dispersed in the form
of loans and grants — was before
Congress, the Advocacy Office
began letter-writing campaigns to
U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Stan
ford, and U.S. senators.
The office was also an integral
part of Financial Aid Awareness
Week last quarter, which presented
speakers and held forums and
workshops for students.
And by holding general meet
ings and distributing fact sheets
during the year's tortuous budget
cutting process, the Advocacy
Office was able to brief students on
threats to their academic security.
While these kinds of projects do
not have immediately tangible
results, they do pay dividends in
the long-term. Without student
representatives constantly push
ing for students in legislatures and
the University, it is all too easy for
those making the decisions to for
get that their actions have real-life
consequences.
Stanford students' apathy dur
ing the budget-cutting process is a
troubling sign that without an
institutionalized outlet for protest,
students may too easily allow their
interests to be shunted aside by
bureaucrats.
The Advocacy Office cannot be
allowed to atrophy. By supporting
it, students will stake a claim in
the decisions that shape their
Stanford experience.
