## Afghans never lost faith 
### 
THE AFGHANS ARE a people dis
tinct from all others. They faced
incredible odds against the Soviet
Army, which invaded the country in 1979,
in what many Russian diplomats label a
"misguided policy" to back a faction of the
ruling Afghan Communist Party.
Yet they organized a fierce resistance,
largely in the countryside, made up of
mujahideen, or holy warriors, fighting
for Allah and country.
Receiving limited outside help from the
United States, Pakistan, Iran and China,
relying mostly on the high morale of their
troops, a vast network of support from vil
lagers — who constitute 90 percent of the
country's population — and the capture of
weapons from the enemy, they were able
to frustrate and outlast a powerful army.
The war was punctuated by mon
strous atrocities on the part of the occu
piers, which finally withdrew in 1989,
and their local communist supporters.
These included the bombing and destruc
tion of up to 80 percent of the country's
villages, the littering of the countryside
with deadly land mines, and the abuse
and rape of villagers.
These acts resulted in the death of up
to 2 million Afghans in a population of 20
million, and drove another 5 million into
exile in Iran and Pakistan. Yet the Afghan
people never lost faith in their religion or
in the righteousness of their cause.
A recent offensive carried out by Com

mander Ahmed Shah Massoud, boosted by
the support of army defectors from the
north, finally led to the downfall of the for
mer ruthless dictator, Muhammed Najibul
lah, two weeks ago. The mujahideen
entered the capital of Kabul, over the week
end, ending 13 years of war and oppression.
Sibghatullaih Mojaddidi, a leader of
one of the mujahideen groups, has been
named president of the new broad-based
Islamic government. He has called for
national reconciliation and has joined the
United Nations in an effort to avoid fur
ther bloodshed. A new constitution will
eventually be drafted.
Speaking on condition of anonymity,
an Afghan student at Harvard who per
formed jihad (holy war) in the past, as a
fighter and journalist, said he is elated
over the papture of Kabul.
The student describes it as "dramatic
though not unexpected," adding that the
smoothness with which the mujahideen
"swept away so many cities in a matter of
weeks and captured Kabul with little
bloodshed was quite extraordinary."
He is optimistic about healing deep
wounds between the majority Pushtuns
and minority groups — such as the Haz
aras, the Turkomans, the Uzbeks and his
own group, the Tajiks — which often
have felt marginalized from politics.
"The Tajik-Pushtun rivalry that the
Western media has portrayed as crucial"
has not been so acute, the student said,

'The war was
punctuated
by monstrous
atrocities on
the part
of the
occupiers.'

adding that it is wrong to say the country
"will break up."
The war gave the people a strong sense
of nationalism, he said. They "are proud
to be Afghan and Muslim, rather than
Tajik or Pushtun."
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Massoud,
the two major strongmen in Kabul, are
Pushtun and Tajik, respectively. Despite
the sporadic fighting that has recently
broken out between the two groups in
Kabul, the student is confident that,
apart from occasional skirmishes inher
ent in Afghanistan's decentralized,
mvUti-ethnic culture, peace will prevail.
"Afghanistan has seen enough war. It
is time for Afghans and the countries
who helped [us in] the war against the
Russians to join hands, make peace and
rebuild the country. Foreign help is cru
cial in the reconstruction process."
At this critical juncture of the coun
try's history, peace, tolerance and com
prehension are necessary, among Afghans
and foreigners alike. The mujahideen vic
tory was a result of the people's belief in
freedom and in Islam, a verdict that the
outside world must recognize.
