Religious reason not why room switch was necessary

The daily has portrayed
the current situation at Ham
marskjold House simplistically and
has ignored the more problematic issues
involved. The underlying motivation for
switching rooms — a move requested
ultimately by both roommates — was
not religion.
Rather, both roommates decided that
they would be better ofT in separate
rooms. Barney Cheng, the gay room
mate, understandably became uncom
fortable with his living arrangement, but
only as a result of his roommate's
unwillingness to live with him.
When Owen Maubane told me and
other house officials that ultimately he
would move out of the house if he were
forced to live with Cheng, I approached
Cheng privately.
Since Cheng felt uncomfortable at the
time with informing the whole house of
an issue that involved his sexual orienta
tion, I discussed with him the two other
options I thought possible — either we
could resolve the conflict at the house

level by meeting with the people
involved, or we could approach the Uni
versity.
About the latter option, I said I could
not predict the University's response but
that in other situations University offi
cials had intervened to safeguard the
rights of the roommate who was facing
discrimination on the basis of his or her
sexual orientation.
If Cheng preferred the latter option, I
assured him, I would protect him from
potential blame by telling those involved
that the decision to go to the University
had been mine.
After considering both options, Cheng
decided that he "just wanted a room"
and thus that he preferred to resolve the
conflict at the house level. Later, a group
from the house which included Cheng
and Maubane discussed the feelings of
both roommates about living together.
Cheng and the group questioned
Maubane further about his refusal to live
with a gay roommate. Maubane cited
many reasons for his refusal — personal

as iVell as cultural and religious.
Eventually, both roommates agreed
on one point: they would be uncomfort
able living together, not only because of
Maubane's refusal and his feelings but
also because, ultimately, as Cheng told
The Daily in an article on April 15, he
didn't "want to end up with a homopho
bic roommate."
Although a few residents (including
myself) felt strongly that approaching
the University first was a better option,
we acquiesced in the end because Cheng
and Maubane preferred that the room
change happen that night.
Given that both roommates were in
favor of switching and despite the poten
tial benefits of approaching the Univer
sity instead, those involved agreed to the
arrangement because (as Cheng also
said to The Daily) "it was the most prac
tical thing."
Hammarskjold officials, Cheng and
Maubane agreed to switch roommates
not because we felt Maubane's religious
beliefs should be protected — no one was

forced to decide if religion was legitimate
grounds for refusing to live with some
one of a different sexual orientation.
What we all did in the end was to
acquiesce to a room change in a situa
tion in which both roommates felt it was
best to live in different rooms.
With respect to The Daily's recent
editorial, which called for an overarching
University policy that would eliminate
the need for case-by-case analyses, I can
only offer personal input from my expe
rience and that of others who have been
in similar situations on campus.
In cases in which both roommates pre
fer to be separated and in which one per
son has already had his or her rights vio
lated by a roommate's refusal to accept
him or her as an "appropriate" roommate
based on sexual orientation, I would have
severe misgivings about forcing a gay, les
bian or bisexual to accept a homophobic
roommate for the sake of "learning."
