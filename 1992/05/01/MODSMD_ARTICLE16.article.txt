# King incident merely symptom of social ills

### 
As we express our anger and aston
ishment over the Rodney King verdict,
let's not forget the real issue. We can
feel angry that some naive white jurors
in Ventura County have a misplaced
trust in the goodness of the police
department. We can feel angry that the
justice system has consistently given
injustice for people of color.
But that's really not why people
burned down L.A. That's not why people
rioted in the streets. That's not what
they are angry about.
They are angry because this country
has consistently over several hundred
years oppressed people of color. They are
angry because they know that the idea of

a free country for liberty and justice for all
is a lie, a cruel heartless lie and as shown
today it takes only one glaring example of
it to bring out those years of anger.
As we spend the next weeks attacking
the justice system and proclaiming the
stupidity and racism of the jurors, let's
stop and look at the whole picture, the
real issues of racism, disempowerment,
oppression and look at ourselves.
In a Stanford where nearly 50 percent
of the students don't feel student of
color organizations deserve funding to
provide programming for their own com
munities and the outside community,
where most people feel multiculturalism,
with its message of education, accep
tance, and celebration of differences, is
rammed down their throats, when any
discussion or view that argues against
racism is labelled Politically Correct,
let's look at our own efforts at promot-

ing racial and cultural understanding,
our own attempts to fight racism, to pro
vide justice that will quell the anger.
The issue is far greater than Rodney
King, the LAPD, or our flawed justice
system. The issue is racism and injustice
and the first place to begin looking is
within ourselves.
