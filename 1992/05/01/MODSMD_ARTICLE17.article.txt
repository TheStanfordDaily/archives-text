Regarding the elimination of federal
student grants and loans for those con
victed of drug use: Heaven forbid that
students be required to obey the law in
return for money from the government

What's next? Requiring that everyone
else obey the law too?
The Daily's April 27 editorial on this
subject was filled with airy talk about "pri
vacy" and "rights" and "civil liberties."
For the record, the Constitution guaran
tees neither a right to use drugs nor a
right to break the law, let alone a right to
receive money while breaking the law.
It seems fitting that on the same day
the editorial blithely dismissed "the
potentially harmful consequences of
casual drug usage," the front page
reported that a woman had been sexual
ly assaulted in broad daylight by a man
on a marijuana- induced high.
Perhaps if your editorial board read
the news more often, it would realize the
impact such "casual" use has on users
and those around them.
