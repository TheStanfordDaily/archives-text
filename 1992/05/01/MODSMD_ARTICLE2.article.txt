# Campus responds to verdict; rally planned for noon today
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
In the first full day of activity
following the acquittals in the
Rodney King beating case, stu
dents rallied at the Law School,
petitioned in White Plaza and
planned future actions to promote
civil rights, including a rally today.
News of the hastily organized
Law School rally spread by word
of mouth. One organizer, Maya
Harris, said the only preparation
for the spontaneous rally was get
ting a microphone.
"There was a large number of
people, much more than we
expected," law student Michelle
Alexander said.
At the rally, Harris said, "We
have to all wake up, stay awake, get
up next morning and the morning
after and face reality .... We won't
let tomorrow go by without doing
something."

She added that she and her
seven-year old daughter were lis
tening to President Bush's press
conference, in which he advised
protestors to calm down and stop
the violence, when her daughter
said: "We're angry — why should
we stop?"
During the rally, petitions
were circulated in White Plaza as
one facet of the organized campus
protest movement. Graduate stu
dent Anthony Clark said petitions
would be circulated "as long as it
takes," adding that more than
2,000 signatures had been gath
ered in less than 24 hours.
However, not everyone was
ready to sign their name. Gradu
ate student John Hornbrook said
he felt the students were "attack
ing innocent people walking by."
He said he did not know
enough about the situation to
judge whether the verdict was
supported by evidence other than
the videotape, and therefore
would not sign a petition.
Hornbrook's refusal drew
response from students standing
nearby.
"I don't think kicking and
beating a man with bully clubs is
ever justified. That's why I have a
problem with you," junior Tanya
Van Court told Hornbrook.
Freshman Jomo Graham, one
of the leaders of a campus letter
writing campaign, called on stu
dents to send individual letters to
prominent politicians as well as
sign petitions, and bought an
advertisement in The Daily to
print a model letter.
Multicultural educator Greg
Ricks, an adviser to the loose
organization of student leaders,
said students should "take time
and think about what's going on"
by writing a letter.
In a late-night organizational
meeting held in the Lagunita din
ing hall, at least 200 students, fac
ulty and staff planned today's
rally and further actions.
The rally, which had originally

been scheduled for White Plaza,
was moved to the courtyard
between the Law School and
Meyer library because it conflict
ed with the Spring Faire, accord
ing to sophomore organizer Tracy
Clay.

'This is not a black
thing. It is a coali
tion which is not
limited by race,
gender or politics/
— Greg Ricks

At the meeting, some students
advocated civil disobedience, and
leaders hinted at agreement.
When a community member
said students should block local
streets, Clay suggested everyone
wear "comfortable clothing and
walking shoes" to the rally.
When the same person asked
"to what end are we wearing
these walking shoes," Clay replied
that the organizers have a plan
but are "not capable of sharing it
right now."

Bacardi Jackson said members of
the coalition contacted groups at
other schools for the rally.
Clay said the rally would begin
with a singing of the Black
National Anthem and a series of
student speakers on the history of
law and the civil rights move
ment.
In addition, many community
leaders from Stanford and the
Bay Area will speak. Stanford
speakers include Tony Burciaga,
a resident fellow at Casa Zapata,
Keith Archuleta, the director of
the Black Community Services
Center, Mary Edmonds, the vice
president for student resources,
and Ricks, according to Clay.
Clay said there will be an open
microphone for rally participants.
However, she added that people
should think carefully before
speaking because "we don't have
time for anyone to be random."
Dressed in black and holding
up two red candles, graduate stu
dent Francisca James-Hernandez
said at the meeting that she is
"ready to do something."
James-Hernandez wasn't the
only person dressed in black on
campus today. Many students
wore black as a "symbol of
mourning for justice" in America,
Clay said.
Senior Alma Medena, the co

chair of MEChA, a Chicano/Lati
no student group, said people
should also wear black to mourn
those killed in Los Angeles in the
violent aftermath of the verdict.
Clay and Jackson emphasized
that activities against the King
beating verdict have had racially
diverse participants.
"This is not a black thing. It is
a coalition which is not limited by
race, gender or politics," Ricks
said.
There has also been a "strong
reaction by faculty," he said,
adding that Political Science Prof.
Lucius Barker and Latin Ameri
can Studies Prof. Terry Karl have
organized a meeting for faculty
response today (see related story,
page 3).
Other events currently being
planned include a discussion with
Janet Wells, the president of the
Palo Alto chapter of the NAACP,
and Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington on Sunday; a meeting
with black community leaders of
East Palo Alto on Tuesday; a
teach-in on Wednesday; and a
Mother's Day vigil organized in
conjunction with groups from
other campuses, according to
Jackson.

and Ricks, according to Clay.
Clay said there will be an open
microphone for rally participants.
However, she added that people
should think carefully before
speaking because "we don't have
time for anyone to be random."
Dressed in black and holding
up two red candles, graduate stu
dent Francisca James-Hernandez
said at the meeting that she is
"ready to do something."
James-Hernandez wasn't the
only person dressed in black on
campus today. Many students
wore black as a "symbol of
mourning for justice" in America,
Clay said.
Senior Alma Medena, the co

chair of MEChA, a Chicano/Lati
no student group, said people
should also wear black to mourn
those killed in Los Angeles in the
violent aftermath of the verdict.
Clay and Jackson emphasized
that activities against the King
beating verdict have had racially
diverse participants.
"This is not a black thing. It is
a coalition which is not limited by
race, gender or politics," Ricks
said.
There has also been a "strong
reaction by faculty," he said,
adding that Political Science Prof.
Lucius Barker and Latin Ameri
can Studies Prof. Terry Karl have
organized a meeting for faculty
response today (see related story,
page 3).
Other events currently being
planned include a discussion with
Janet Wells, the president of the
Palo Alto chapter of the NAACP,
and Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington on Sunday; a meeting
with black community leaders of
East Palo Alto on Tuesday; a
teach-in on Wednesday; and a
Mother's Day vigil organized in
conjunction with groups from
other campuses, according to
Jackson.

In the first full day of activity
following the acquittals in the
Rodney King beating case, stu
dents rallied at the Law School,
petitioned in White Plaza and
planned future actions to promote
civil rights, including a rally today.
News of the hastily organized
Law School rally spread by word
of mouth. One organizer, Maya
Harris, said the only preparation
for the spontaneous rally was get
ting a microphone.
"There was a large number of
people, much more than we
expected," law student Michelle
Alexander said.
At the rally, Harris said, "We
have to all wake up, stay awake, get
up next morning and the morning
after and face reality .... We won't
let tomorrow go by without doing
something."

She added that she and her
seven-year old daughter were lis
tening to President Bush's press
conference, in which he advised
protestors to calm down and stop
the violence, when her daughter
said: "We're angry — why should
we stop?"
During the rally, petitions
were circulated in White Plaza as
one facet of the organized campus
protest movement. Graduate stu
dent Anthony Clark said petitions
would be circulated "as long as it
takes," adding that more than
2,000 signatures had been gath
ered in less than 24 hours.
However, not everyone was
ready to sign their name. Gradu
ate student John Hornbrook said
he felt the students were "attack
ing innocent people walking by."
He said he did not know
enough about the situation to
judge whether the verdict was
supported by evidence other than
the videotape, and therefore
would not sign a petition.
Hornbrook's refusal drew
response from students standing
nearby.
"I don't think kicking and
beating a man with bully clubs is
ever justified. That's why I have a
problem with you," junior Tanya
Van Court told Hornbrook.
Freshman Jomo Graham, one
of the leaders of a campus letter
writing campaign, called on stu
dents to send individual letters to
prominent politicians as well as
sign petitions, and bought an
advertisement in The Daily to
print a model letter.
Multicultural educator Greg
Ricks, an adviser to the loose
organization of student leaders,
said students should "take time
and think about what's going on"
by writing a letter.
In a late-night organizational
meeting held in the Lagunita din
ing hall, at least 200 students, fac
ulty and staff planned today's
rally and further actions.
The rally, which had originally

been scheduled for White Plaza,
was moved to the courtyard
between the Law School and
Meyer library because it conflict
ed with the Spring Faire, accord
ing to sophomore organizer Tracy
Clay.

thing. It is a coali

At the meeting, some students
advocated civil disobedience, and
leaders hinted at agreement.
When a community member
said students should block local
streets, Clay suggested everyone
wear "comfortable clothing and
walking shoes" to the rally.
When the same person asked
"to what end are we wearing
these walking shoes," Clay replied
that the organizers have a plan
but are "not capable of sharing it
right now."

Bacardi Jackson said members of
the coalition contacted groups at
other schools for the rally.
Clay said the rally would begin
with a singing of the Black
National Anthem and a series of
student speakers on the history of
law and the civil rights move
ment.
In addition, many community
leaders from Stanford and the
Bay Area will speak. Stanford
speakers include Tony Burciaga,
a resident fellow at Casa Zapata,
Keith Archuleta, the director of
the Black Community Services
Center, Mary Edmonds, the vice
president for student resources,
and Ricks, according to Clay.
