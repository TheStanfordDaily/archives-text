## Six-Pac dogfight continues 
### Brian Egan Editorial staff 
With two weeks remaining in the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division
schedule, absolutely nothing has been
decided. In perhaps the tightest race in
the history of the conference, five teams
are separated by a single game.
No. 10 Stanford (28-19 overall)
squares off this weekend for a crucial
three-game series with the UCLA Bru
ins (29-17), a series which could go a
long way in determining the Cardinal's
postseason fortunes.
"At this point in the season, [the
UCLA series] is definitely the biggest
series of the year," said right fielder
Steve Solomon. Right now, we're not
playing consistent baseball. But we still
control our own destiny."
Indeed, even after dropping two of
three games to first-place Arizona last
weekend at Sunken Diamond, Stanford
really does control its own destiny. With
a strong showing against the Bruins
this weekend and co-conference leader
California next weekend, the Cardinal
will waltz into the NCAA Regionals.
But this, however, will be easier said
than done. UCLA is hot, having won its

series with Arizona State last weekend
in convincing fashion, and has moved
up to No. 20 in the latest Collegiate
Baseball poll.
The Bruins are leading the Six-Pac
in ERA with a sizzling 3.92 mark. The
staff is headed by Pete Janicki, who
leads the conference in strikeouts with
104, and is second in the league in ERA
(3.11), wins (seven), innings pitched
(104.1), and complete games (six).
Janicki, one of the top five pro
recruits in all of collegiate baseball, will
start today's game. Righthander Gary
Adcock and lefty Tim Kubinski are the
expected starters in Games 2 and 3.
In addition, UCLA's outfield trio of
Michael Moore, David Roberts, and
Shawn Wills is one of the best in the
league. Moore, a junior centerfielder,
has lived up to his preseason All-Amer
ica status, hitting at a .346 clip with
eight home runs and 14 stolen bases.
Roberts, one of the leading candi
dates for National Freshman of the
Year honors, has stolen a league-lead
ing 31 bases, and ranks second to
Moore on the Bruins in batting (.344).
If UCLA sports one of the best out
fields in the league, then the Cardinal's
threesome is one of the best in the game.

Jeffrey Hammonds, Solomon, and left
fielder Dave Cornell have a combined
average of almost .350, with Hammonds
leading the charge with his .382 mark.
It has been Solomon, however, who
has picked up the offensive slack of late,
reusing his average almost 40 points
over the last two weeks to .353.
"I'm just looking for consistent out
put," Solomon said. "I've been swing
ing a good bat lately; I just hope I can
continue this for the next few weeks."
Today's game has a 2:30 p.m. sched
uled start, while the Saturday and Sun
day contests will begin at 1 p.m. The
entire series will be carried live on
KZSU (90.1 FM).


Right fielder Steve Solomon has become a true offensive weapon at the plate, raising
his average almost forty points to .353 over the past two weeks.
