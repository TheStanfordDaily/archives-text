# The
						Shark finds a more friendly home
## Tarkanian's style perfect for world of pro basketball 
### 
Look out! Jerry Tarkanian is
moving his act to Texas. The
man the NCAA loved to hate
is climbing up to the next level to
coach the San Antonio Spurs in
the pros. Tark the Shark is leaving
the glitz, glamour, and gambling of
Las Vegas to take a gamble with
the NBA in cowboy country.
The deck is loaded, and he
should come up aces. Tark will be a
great coach in the NBA, and will
make the transition to the big time
with ease — and with less worries.
Jerry, here are the essentials:
First, all you will have to do for
the Spurs is coach. Tark, you do
not have to worry about your
players going to class, or pretend
ing to do so, in order to play. You
will not have to create the illusion
that your players are getting a
"education." In the pros, there
are no writing assignments to
worry about. The only writing
assignments pros have are sign
ing autographs, and they get paid
to do that.
Second, you can be open about
paying your players. Sure at
UNLV you gave them scholar
ships, but where could they look
for pocket money? Alumni boost

ers are not necessary to supple
ment players' cash flow in the
NBA—the organization pays
them, and pays them a lot.
Third, in the NBA you do not

have to be secretive if you want to
buy your players fancy cars. Keep
your money, Tark; they already
own them. In fact, if you're lucky,
they might even buy you one.
Fourth, you'll have an endless
supply of towels in San Antonio.
The one picture that anyone took
away from watching a UNLV game
would be to see Tark sitting on the
bench with teeth clenching ter
rycloth. Given the current crisis fac
ing universities today, it was only a
matter of time before UNLV Presi
dent Robert Maxon got rid of your

towel supply due to budget cuts. In
the big time, you get the perks.
Next, there is no such thing as
recruiting violations. It doesn't
matter if you try to lure players
from other teams. There's a kid
from New York City you might
want to look at, name of Lloyd
Daniels, who's playing in the CBA
right now. What you say? You've
already been burned before by
this guy? If the guy can still put
the ball in the hoop, sign him. So
what if he's got a drug record. At
most, if you're caught with illegal
substances in the NBA they make
you sit out a year and call it a
"substance-abuse suspension."
Think of it as redshirting.
Along those lines, the NBA
can't ban your team from the
playoffs. So since you won't be
suing the NCAA anymore, think
about all that money you'll be sav
ing in lawyer fees. Then again, you
could always sue the NHL's San
Jose Sharks for naming a team
after you without your consent.
If your team does not make the
playoffs, your team gets the pro
version of the NIT, the draft lot
tery. Here's the opportunity to
put all those skills of chance you

learned at the slot machines
between practices to good use to
heighten your team's potential,
and the odds are better.
One warning though. You've
said that you want to go from the
Runnin' Rebels and make your
new team the "Runnin' Spurs."
Be careful: the run-and-gun style
may have worked in Las Vegas,
but in San Antonio the guns are
real — and loaded.
The biggest problem that you
will face is what to do about job
security. In the NBA, fired coaches
are as frequent as people losing
money in casinos. So the key is to
develop comraderie with the locals.
Create a "Tark's Tavern"
down the street from Hemisfair
Arena. Open up "Tark's Place" in
the San Antonio airport, just like
the one you have in the Vegas air
port. You could even expand and
make franchises in airports across
America, and then your job will be
safe and sound.
Finally, if you feel like a shark
out of water, have no fear. The
Admiral will save you.
