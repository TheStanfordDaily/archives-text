Last weekend seven Stan
ford athletes were at the Penn
Relays, the most prestigious
meet in the United States
today. This weekend they and
the rest of the team will be
competing against a bunch of
Weenies. Go figure.
In truth, the California meet
this weekend (held at Berkeley)
figures to be the most impor
tant dual meet of the year for
the Cardinal, both for the team
and for individuals who are
hoping to hit NCAA-qualifying
standards as the season pro
gresses toward the Pacific 10
Conference and national colle
giate championships.
Senior Fred Carter, who is
looking to hit an NCAA qualify
ing mark in the 3000-meter
steeplechase after running the
fastest race of his collegiate
career last weekend in Philadel
phia, says he will be gunning for
the meet record of 8 minutes,
48.3 seconds, a time which would
also qualify him provisionally for
the NCAA championships.
He will be joined by team
mate Gary Stolz, who normally
runs in the 5,000-meters but
runs the steeplechase once a
year (against California) and
should give the men valuable
points with a high finish.
"Last weekend [at PennJ a
was going strong until the last
two laps and then I just blew up
.... It's a psychological barrier
that I'll have to get over,"
Carter said.
The men, in particular, have
a pretty nasty psychological
barrier of their own that they
are up against. California has
beaten them in 20 consecutive
meets, dating back to 1971, and
has a strong enough team this
year to make it 21.
"The war does not look good

right now," said Stanford assis
tant coach Scott Chisam about
the men's side, although they
will be strong in the throwing
and the distance events.
The women's teams should
go down to the wire as it did
two years ago when the Golden
Bears won on the last event of
the day, the mile relay. Last
year the Cardinal women easily
won at Stanford to tie up the
series 6-6. This year, NCAA
superstars Chryste Gaines and
Jackie Edwards will lead the
Cardinal field.
"Chryste and Jackie have
both said that they won't be
responsible for Cal taking the
lead in the series," Chisam said.
The men's throwing events
will have a slew of outstanding
individuals on both sides,
including Stanford's Dave Pope
joy, who has qualified automati
cally for the NCAA Champi
onships in the hammer throw.
Pat Stowell, who has quali
fied for Pac-10 Championships
in the discus, will have his
hands full in going up against
Cal's Ramon Jimenez-Gaona,
who is the Paraguayan national
discus champion.
Another interesting battle
will be in the high jump, where
freshman Travis Clark, who has
qualified for the Pac-10 Champi
onships, will battle California's
Kevin Keane and Jim O'Sulli
van. All three have high-jumped
at least seven feet before. The
competition is so tough that
Chisam said "I predict seven feet
will take third place."
This year's track team has
only four seniors between the
men and women — Carter,
Gaines, Edwards, and Alex
Accetta.
"For the last two years this
team has been heavily senior
dominated, which is why we
have been able to compete so
well [against Cal]," Chisam said.
