# Card netmen ruin Huskies' upset hopes
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
They may dominate on the football
field, but when it comes to tennis, the
Washington Huskies have few bragging
rights. In the last home match of the
season, all 10 members of the Stanford
men's tennis team contributed to yes
terday's 8-1 thrashing of their North
ern opponents.

The Cardinal's top six singles players
systematically picked apart the Huskies
without dropping a single set. "The last
two days in singles have been phenome
nal," noted head coach Dick Gould.
Senior Alex O'Brien had the closest
match at first singles against No. 26
Chet Crile. Down 1-4 in the second set,
O'Brien came back to win 6-4, 7-5.
The second, third and fourth singles
players disposed of their competition in
speedy fashion. Michael Flanagan
dropped only one game against Manuel
Marti, while Chris Cocotos breezed past
his opponent, 6-2, 6-1. Vimal Patel also
dominated his match, winning 6-2, 6-4.
"Michael was controlling the tempo

really well," Gould said. "He had a good
feel of the ball. Chris also played a real
ly smart match today.
At fifth singles, Robert Devens also
had a psychological boost. Known for
dragging matches to three sets, Devens
squeezed out a straight-setter, 6-2, 7-5.
Losing his serve in the second set, he
broke back and served to win against a
tough Knute Lund.
"He showed a lot of guts out there,"
said assistant coach John Whitlinger.
"Lund wasn't going to give him much
but (Devens) served well in the last
game. Hopefully he'll keep that serve
going. I was real happy with the way he
played."
Rounding out the singles domina
tion was senior Jason Yee who turned
in another impeccable performance.
His 6-3, 6-1 victory over Mark DeMaine
was reflective of the excellence he has
displayed throughout his final season
with the Cardinal.
"Jason continues to do a great job,"
Gould said. "I just can't say enough
about him."
In doubles action, junior Roman
Sydorak and sophomore Billy Wright
crushed their competition in the second
slot, 6-4, 6-2. The duo won the Invita
tional division in Ojai last weekend.
"We're working as a team more and
encouraging each other better," Wright
said. "The four matches in Ojai really
helped."
At third singles, junior Ken Pedroza

and freshman Mihir Mankad pulled out
a daring win. Having never played a
match together, the Cardinal pair came
back from a 2-5 second set deficit to win
the set 7-5.
"I'm most proud of them for coming
back like that," Whitlinger said. "They
played pretty well, doing things we've
done in practice."
The Huskies' last chance to save face
came in a three-set first doubles match,
pairing Yee and Patcl against Crile and
DeMaine. In the final set, Washington
was serving for the match at 5-4, 40-0.
Although they saved the next two
points, the Stanford pair could not pull
out the match. The Huskies got their
one lone point of the match with the 4-
6, 6-3, 6-4 win.

"It was a great effort. Washington's
not a bad team at all," Gould said.
Tomorrow the Card travels to
Berkeley to take on the Golden Bears at
1 p.m. in their last match of the season.
Hopefully the No. 1-ranked players will
be well rested because Cal has beaten
Stanford for the past two years when
playing on their home turf.
"It's always tough at Cal," Wright
said. "They get big crowds and the
courts are always windy." This is the
final hurdle before NCAAs. If the 20-3
Cardinal wins Saturday, Gould feels
that there will be few skeptics left.
"I don't think anyone's going to look
forward to playing us," he said. "They're
going to be saying, 'Uh-oh, watch out â€”
here comes the Cardinal."


Jason Yee closed out his Stanford Tennis Stadium
career with a 6-3, 6-1 victory over Washington's
Mark DeMaine yesterday.
