# Sailors in two regattas, berth in Nationals on line
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
When the Stanford sailing team competes in
Berkeley this weekend, they are likely to feel more
pressure than usual. Beginning today the Cardinal
will be sailing in two national qualifying regattas
where they will be challenged for a bid by some of
the top teams from the West.
At the Team Race Championships taking place
today, the Stanford squad needs to finish in the top
two out of a field of seven to earn a berth for Nation
als. While the opposition might appear somewhat
menacing, coach Blake Middleton has not counted
Stanford out.
"UC-Irvine should win every race," he said.
"After that any one of five teams could qualify."
The fate of the Cardinal will lie on the shoulders
of three pairs of experienced team members who will
sail round-robin against the other six teams.
Freshman Charles Meade will skipper one of the
boats, along with crew Katherine Chen. Another
boat will consist of skipper Matt Sanford and his
crew Kristen Sidell, and the final pair will be made
up of skipper Scott Sellers and crew Andi Guerrero.
Since the team races are sailed simultaneously by
all three of the boats from a school, Middleton
emphasized the need for a consistent performance

from all of the Stanford teams.
"We don't have to do anything spectacular, but
we just need to sail solidly. We have to act as a team
and be ready to help each other," he said.
Following the Team Race Championships, the
Cardinal will spend Saturday and Sunday partici
pating in the equally competitive Dingy Champi
onships. Although Stanford has only qualified for
this national regatta once in the last six years, Mid
dleton once again expressed confidence in his squad.
"This regatta is wide open," he said. "Even
though only two of 11 teams will earn a birth, if we
sail to our potential, we could definitely win the
whole thing."
Stanford will be represented by Meade and Chen
in the A division of the race and by the combination
of Sanford and Sidell in the B division. However,
Middleton was quick to add that there are many
other talented sailors who might also compete Sat
urday or Sunday for the Cardinal.
"Along with Sellers and Guerrero, skippers John
Emory and Jeremy Mclntyre both may sail for part
of the time," he said.
As the sailing team enters these two very impor
tant regattas, they cannot help but place high expec
tations on themselves.
"This is one of the biggest weekends of the year for
us. This is where we need to peak," Middleton said.
