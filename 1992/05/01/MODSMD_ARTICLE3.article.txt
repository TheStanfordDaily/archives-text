LOS ANGELES (AP) - Fires
blanketed a city under siege with
thick, acrid smoke as troops and
police stood by, giving the city
over to looters, brick throwers,
gunmen and even ax-wielding
rioters following the Rodney King
trial acquittals.
A nighttime curfew was
imposed as violence spread last
night beyond South Central Los
Angeles. Fires burned on Holly
wood Boulevard, where a land
mark store was looted, and in
Koreatown, Westwood and the
San Fernando Valley.
Twenty-four people died, at
least 901 were injured — includ

that this city is not going to suffer
(this) kind of terrorism," he said.
Some 4,000 National Guard
troops massed in the nation's sec

cars, with televisions, food and
clothes.
"People are just tired," said
one looter, waiting for his friends
to get what they wanted from a
music store. "There are no jobs,
no work. They have put up the
right way. They played the game.

A white motorcyclist was
