# 24 dead as Los Angeles riots roll on
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Fires
blanketed a city under siege with
thick, acrid smoke as troops and
police stood by, giving the city
over to looters, brick throwers,
gunmen and even ax-wielding
rioters following the Rodney King
trial acquittals.
A nighttime curfew was
imposed as violence spread last
night beyond South Central Los
Angeles. Fires burned on Holly
wood Boulevard, where a land
mark store was looted, and in
Koreatown, Westwood and the
San Fernando Valley.
Twenty-four people died, at
least 901 were injured — includ
ing three firefighters — and 400
were arrested since the rioting
began Wednesday.
Police said early this morning
no one had been arrested for
breaking curfew, but hundreds
milled on the streets.
Firefighters reported that once
the curfew went into effect, the
number of blazes crews were bat
tling declined, down to 40 late
last night from as many as 200
earlier. Still, arrests in outlying
areas such as Pasadena and Long
Beach climbed.
In Perris, 60 miles from down
town, a Molotov cocktail was
thrown through an optometrist's
office and a local diner. Six new
blazes broke out in a Long Beach
thrift store.
Gov. Pete Wilson said at a mid
night news conference that feder
al troops may be required to
restore calm. "We are determined
that this city is not going to suffer
(this) kind of terrorism," he said.
Some 4,000 National Guard
troops massed in the nation's sec
ond-largest city, but looters run
ning at will stuffed totebags, even
cars, with televisions, food and
clothes.
"People are just tired," said
one looter, waiting for his friends
to get what they wanted from a
music store. "There are no jobs,
no work. They have put up the
right way. They played the game.
It didn't work."
A white motorcyclist was
killed by a gunshot to the back of
the head last night and another
was wounded by a crowd of 30 to
40 blacks in Long Beach, police
Commander Anthony Batts said.
Long Beach also declared a curfew.
Protests of the acquittal of four
white Los Angeles police officers
in the beating of King also spread
to Atlanta, where at least 26 were
injured.
Workers in downtown Los
Angeles headed home early yes
terday afternoon, leaving an eery
ghost town. The city's bus sys
tem, the largest in the nation, was
shut down. Streets usually crowd
ed with evening rush hour traffic
were dangerous and all but
deserted. Some drivers, ignoring
stoplights and the 35 mph speed
limit, careened along at 65 mph.
On Olympic Boulevard, a heavy
pickup truck backed blindly
through an intersection at high
speed, headed for a convenience
store being looted across the street.
A few blocks down, a large
trash bin had been rolled into the
middle of the street. Packing
crates and other debris made the
boulevard an obstacle course.
Walter Blue, a black business
man in the worst riot area, kicked
the glass shards that littered the
floor of his check-cashing shop and
muttered while workers bolted a

thick wood panel in place where
doors and windows once stood.
"This is mob psychology. They
just run the streets like idiots and
do stupid things," he said. "They
don't care. These people are just
trying to get money. This is just an
excuse."
Gun battles erupted between
looters and store guards, a
motorist was shot to death in
South Los Angeles and investiga
tors said a youth gang may have
been participating in an effort to
torch 10 buildings an hour.
' 'We are doing the best we can to
break up this ring. To them, it's a
free-for-all," said California High
way Patrol Lt. Bud Shields after
the arrest of six youths in Compton.
The violence was centered in a
7-by-15 mile area including the
predominantly Hispanic and
black South Central Los Angeles,
but spread to other neighbor
hoods, seemingly unchecked by
police and troops.
"We are overwhelmed," said
Capt. Steve Gates, in charge of
the police department's South
Central command post. "When
you see on television looters right
in front of police officers, we have
a horrible situation."
Gates said officers' first priori
ty was to protect themselves and
firefighters. They were instructed
not to make arrests "when it
might cost them their safety."

"Our desire is to become pro
active and quite frankly we
haven't reached that stage," Gates
said last night.
Smoke from the fires forced
planes to approach Los Angeles
International Airport from the
ocean rather than overland, caus
ing numerous delays and cancel
lations in flights. Some flights
were diverted to other airports in
the Los Angeles area.
Shoppers, fearing power out
ages as night approached, stocked
up on batteries and candles. Busi
nesses closed early, and the smell
of smoke hung everywhere. Pro
fessional basketball and baseball
games were canceled last night.
Arsonists torched hundreds of
buildings. As many as 63 fires were
burning at sundown yesterday.
In Hollywood, Frederick's of
Hollywood, a lingerie store, was
looted. Near Beverly Hills, ax
wielding rioters prompted the
evacuation of an office building.
"We cannot and we will not tol
erate any violence as a means to
express anger," Mayor Tom
Bradley said. "We are going to
enforce the law, we are going to
have adequate law enforcement to
deal with that matter."
David Langness, spokesman for
the Hospital Council of Southern
California, estimated hospitals in
the riot-torn areas had treated at
least 700 people for various injuries.

Some 4,000 National Guard
troops massed in the nation's sec
ond-largest city, but looters run
ning at will stuffed totebags, even
cars, with televisions, food and
clothes.
"People are just tired," said
one looter, waiting for his friends
to get what they wanted from a
music store. "There are no jobs,
no work. They have put up the
right way. They played the game.
It didn't work."
A white motorcyclist was
killed by a gunshot to the back of
the head last night and another
was wounded by a crowd of 30 to
40 blacks in Long Beach, police
Commander Anthony Batts said.
Long Beach also declared a curfew.
Protests of the acquittal of four
white Los Angeles police officers
in the beating of King also spread
to Atlanta, where at least 26 were
injured.
Workers in downtown Los
Angeles headed home early yes
terday afternoon, leaving an eery
ghost town. The city's bus sys
tem, the largest in the nation, was
shut down. Streets usually crowd
ed with evening rush hour traffic
were dangerous and all but
deserted. Some drivers, ignoring
stoplights and the 35 mph speed
limit, careened along at 65 mph.
On Olympic Boulevard, a heavy
pickup truck backed blindly
through an intersection at high
speed, headed for a convenience
store being looted across the street.
A few blocks down, a large
trash bin had been rolled into the
middle of the street. Packing
crates and other debris made the
boulevard an obstacle course.
Walter Blue, a black business
man in the worst riot area, kicked
the glass shards that littered the
floor of his check-cashing shop and
muttered while workers bolted a

thick wood panel in place where
doors and windows once stood.
"This is mob psychology. They
just run the streets like idiots and
do stupid things," he said. "They
don't care. These people are just
trying to get money. This is just an
excuse."
Gun battles erupted between
looters and store guards, a
motorist was shot to death in
South Los Angeles and investiga
tors said a youth gang may have
been participating in an effort to
torch 10 buildings an hour.
' 'We are doing the best we can to
break up this ring. To them, it's a
free-for-all," said California High
way Patrol Lt. Bud Shields after
the arrest of six youths in Compton.
The violence was centered in a
7-by-15 mile area including the
predominantly Hispanic and
black South Central Los Angeles,
but spread to other neighbor
hoods, seemingly unchecked by
police and troops.
"We are overwhelmed," said
Capt. Steve Gates, in charge of
the police department's South
Central command post. "When
you see on television looters right
in front of police officers, we have
a horrible situation."
Gates said officers' first priori
ty was to protect themselves and
firefighters. They were instructed
not to make arrests "when it
might cost them their safety."

"Our desire is to become pro
active and quite frankly we
haven't reached that stage," Gates
said last night.
Smoke from the fires forced
planes to approach Los Angeles
International Airport from the
ocean rather than overland, caus
ing numerous delays and cancel
lations in flights. Some flights
were diverted to other airports in
the Los Angeles area.
Shoppers, fearing power out
ages as night approached, stocked
up on batteries and candles. Busi
nesses closed early, and the smell
of smoke hung everywhere. Pro
fessional basketball and baseball
games were canceled last night.
Arsonists torched hundreds of
buildings. As many as 63 fires were
burning at sundown yesterday.
In Hollywood, Frederick's of
Hollywood, a lingerie store, was
looted. Near Beverly Hills, ax
wielding rioters prompted the
evacuation of an office building.
"We cannot and we will not tol
erate any violence as a means to
express anger," Mayor Tom
Bradley said. "We are going to
enforce the law, we are going to
have adequate law enforcement to
deal with that matter."
David Langness, spokesman for
the Hospital Council of Southern
California, estimated hospitals in
the riot-torn areas had treated at
least 700 people for various injuries.

A police officer takes aim at looters in a Los Angeles market last night. Authorities said 24 people were
dead and 901 injured, and at least 400 arrests had been made in Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Fires
blanketed a city under siege with
thick, acrid smoke as troops and
police stood by, giving the city
over to looters, brick throwers,
gunmen and even ax-wielding
rioters following the Rodney King
trial acquittals.
A nighttime curfew was
imposed as violence spread last
night beyond South Central Los
Angeles. Fires burned on Holly
wood Boulevard, where a land
mark store was looted, and in
Koreatown, Westwood and the
San Fernando Valley.
Twenty-four people died, at
least 901 were injured — includ
ing three firefighters — and 400
were arrested since the rioting
began Wednesday.
Police said early this morning
no one had been arrested for
breaking curfew, but hundreds
milled on the streets.
Firefighters reported that once
the curfew went into effect, the
number of blazes crews were bat
tling declined, down to 40 late
last night from as many as 200
earlier. Still, arrests in outlying
areas such as Pasadena and Long
Beach climbed.
In Perris, 60 miles from down
town, a Molotov cocktail was
thrown through an optometrist's
office and a local diner. Six new
blazes broke out in a Long Beach
thrift store.
Gov. Pete Wilson said at a mid
night news conference that feder
al troops may be required to
restore calm. "We are determined
that this city is not going to suffer
