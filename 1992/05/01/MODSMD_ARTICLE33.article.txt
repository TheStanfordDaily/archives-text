## Vandals at Stanford express their anger 
### Joel Stein Staff writer 
Vandals painted slogans and
posted flyers across campus
early yesterday morning in an
expression of anger and frus
tration over Wednesday's ver
dicts in the Rodney King trial.
Painted on roads and side
walks in front of the post office,
the inner quadrangle, The Daily
and the Law School, the slogans
called for action in response to
the acquittal of the four white
police officers charged with
beating King, a black motorist.
The graffiti consisted of
statements including "Support
the Street Fighters," "Stop the
Massacre of Black Men" and
"Avenge King."
Printed flyers posted near
each of these slogans said that
because "justice can't be found
in the courts, we must demand
justice in the streets."

The flyers were pasted on the
outside office doors of Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy,
Vice President for Student
Resources Mary Edmonds, and
in several other areas.
A spokesperson said yester
day that the Stanford Police
had not begun investigating.
Organizers of Wednesday
night's rally in Palo Alto
denied responsibility for the
vandalism.
Bacardi Jackson, former
chair of the Black Student
Union, said she and other speak
ers at the rally encouraged stu
dents to act within the bound
aries of the law, adding that any
group might be responsible.
"We are by no means the
only group on campus dealing
with this issue," she said.
Facilities and maintenance
workers began sandblasting
the paint from the inner quad
rangle yesterday afternoon.
