# Stanford's reputation survives, Kennedy tells Academic Council
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy
reviewed his achievements at Stanford
and outlined challenges for the future in
his final speech to the Academic Council
yesterday afternoon.
"The damage (of the indirect-cost mat
ter) will not all be undone — but those who
judge us fairly will know that Stanford's
reputation means what it always has, that
our confidence and our sense of moral
authority are intact, and that we are still

fully engaged in the breathtaking ascent in
which Stanford has been engaged over the
past four decades," he said.
Kennedy compared media coverage of
the controvei sy to that of the 1988 West
ern Culture debate. He said that, in the
long run, Stanford's name will emerge
relatively unscathed.
"As we learned in the CIV debates,
enlightenment often follows ugly contro
versy at a respectful distance," Kennedy
said. "So it is with the indirect-cost mat
ter, in which honest error and misunder
standing were originally conflated into a

media scandal."
The annual meeting of the Academic
Council — composed of the the Universi
ty's professors — marked one of
Kennedy's last major speeches as presi
dent before June's Commencement.
The approximately 350 faculty in
Kresge Auditorium gave Kennedy a
standing ovation at the end of his 30-
minute speech.
Although large portions of the address
were dedicated to the financial difficulties
that have dominated the University's atten
tion for the past two years, Kennedy

explored a variety of topics, including under
graduate education, faculty issues, campus
facilities and the School of Medicine.
He emphasized Stanford's commit
ment to need-blind admissions and the
policy's importance to multiculturalism.
Some concerns about the future of finan
cial aid have been raised recently because
of statements by incoming University
President Gerhard Casper.
"We have gathered a residential stu
dent body of unequalled diversity, and
joined it enthusiastically in trying to make
the resulting community function well,"

he said. "That effort has depended on the
generosity of those who support an ambi
tious program of financial aid, and on our
commitment — as firm today as ever — to
a policy of need-blind admissions."
"We have received — and we deserve
— national recognition for sustaining a
vivid and successful multicultural envi
ronment," he added.
Kennedy praised appointments to the
faculty during his tenure, saying the cur
rent group is "the most distinguished
faculty Stanford has ever had."
He also noted the emphasis placed
on improving the humanities,
which are "now widely perceived
to be stronger nationally" than a
decade ago.
But at the same time, he said
the University must be concerned
about the "major demographic
transition" in the faculty, as the
average age of a Stanford profes
sor has increased dramatically in
the past 15 years.
"A faculty that is seven years
older costs more — tens of mil
lions more," Kennedy said. "Mov
ing the age distribution of the
Stanford faculty back to what it

was in 1975 would have eliminat
ed the need for most of the budget
reductions we have so gainfully
accomplished in the past year."
Despite the "healthy" growth
of the endowment and successful
completion of the recent $43 mil
lion deficit-reduction process,
Kennedy warned of the "palpable
deteriorations in service levels"
and the "careless references to
'too much administration' " that
"mistake the historical sources of
our growth."
The involvement of the faculty
in the budget process provides "a
golden opportunity to consider
some real design changes in Stan
ford's academic organization," he
said. "It would be a shame to
waste this knowledge when it has
such a potential for shaping posi
tive change."

Kennedy could not avoid dis
cussing the indirect-cost contro
versy, which has marred the final
18 months of his presidency.
"I cannot downplay the seri
ousness of our present impasse
with the government over the
indirect-cost matter," he said.
"The indirect-cost rate that has
been unilaterally imposed by the
Office of Naval Research ... is
costing us much more each year,
in terms of foregone reimburse
ment, than all the voluntary with
drawals we have made."
"We are determined to perse
vere and to establish a fair rate
for 1992 and subsequent years.
But in the meantime, we have no
choice but to appeal the govern
ment's refusal to honor the
[memoranda of understanding],
and a prolonged legal engagement

seems certain," he added.
Kennedy concluded his final
speech to the entire faculty with
hope for the future, placing trust
in his successor.
"I want to assure you that
[Casper] understands and shares
our values and our collective aspi
rations for Stanford," Kennedy
said. "We could not have asked for
a better leader in meeting the
challenges I have just outlined,
and many others as well."
"I am looking forward to work
ing with you to support his
efforts. He will, after all, be my
president too," Kennedy said.

"As we learned in the CIV debates,
enlightenment often follows ugly contro
versy at a respectful distance," Kennedy
said. "So it is with the indirect-cost mat
ter, in which honest error and misunder
standing were originally conflated into a

media scandal."
The annual meeting of the Academic
Council — composed of the the Universi
ty's professors — marked one of
Kennedy's last major speeches as presi
dent before June's Commencement.
The approximately 350 faculty in
Kresge Auditorium gave Kennedy a
standing ovation at the end of his 30-
minute speech.
Although large portions of the address
were dedicated to the financial difficulties
that have dominated the University's atten
tion for the past two years, Kennedy

explored a variety of topics, including under
graduate education, faculty issues, campus
facilities and the School of Medicine.
He emphasized Stanford's commit
ment to need-blind admissions and the
policy's importance to multiculturalism.
Some concerns about the future of finan
cial aid have been raised recently because
of statements by incoming University
President Gerhard Casper.
"We have gathered a residential stu
dent body of unequalled diversity, and
joined it enthusiastically in trying to make
the resulting community function well,"

he said. "That effort has depended on the
generosity of those who support an ambi
tious program of financial aid, and on our
commitment — as firm today as ever — to
a policy of need-blind admissions."
"We have received — and we deserve
— national recognition for sustaining a
vivid and successful multicultural envi
ronment," he added.
Kennedy praised appointments to the
faculty during his tenure, saying the cur
rent group is "the most distinguished
faculty Stanford has ever had."
He also noted the emphasis placed
on improving the humanities,
which are "now widely perceived
to be stronger nationally" than a
decade ago.
But at the same time, he said
the University must be concerned
about the "major demographic
transition" in the faculty, as the
average age of a Stanford profes
sor has increased dramatically in
the past 15 years.
"A faculty that is seven years
older costs more — tens of mil
lions more," Kennedy said. "Mov
ing the age distribution of the
Stanford faculty back to what it

was in 1975 would have eliminat
ed the need for most of the budget
reductions we have so gainfully
accomplished in the past year."
Despite the "healthy" growth
of the endowment and successful
completion of the recent $43 mil
lion deficit-reduction process,
Kennedy warned of the "palpable
deteriorations in service levels"
and the "careless references to
'too much administration' " that
"mistake the historical sources of
our growth."
The involvement of the faculty
in the budget process provides "a
golden opportunity to consider
some real design changes in Stan
ford's academic organization," he
said. "It would be a shame to
waste this knowledge when it has
such a potential for shaping posi
tive change."

Kennedy could not avoid dis
cussing the indirect-cost contro
versy, which has marred the final
18 months of his presidency.
"I cannot downplay the seri
ousness of our present impasse
with the government over the
indirect-cost matter," he said.
"The indirect-cost rate that has
been unilaterally imposed by the
Office of Naval Research ... is
costing us much more each year,
in terms of foregone reimburse
ment, than all the voluntary with
drawals we have made."
"We are determined to perse
vere and to establish a fair rate
for 1992 and subsequent years.
But in the meantime, we have no
choice but to appeal the govern
ment's refusal to honor the
[memoranda of understanding],
and a prolonged legal engagement

seems certain," he added.
Kennedy concluded his final
speech to the entire faculty with
hope for the future, placing trust
in his successor.
"I want to assure you that
[Casper] understands and shares
our values and our collective aspi
rations for Stanford," Kennedy
said. "We could not have asked for
a better leader in meeting the
challenges I have just outlined,
and many others as well."
"I am looking forward to work
ing with you to support his
efforts. He will, after all, be my
president too," Kennedy said.

University President Donald Kennedy
reviewed his achievements at Stanford
and outlined challenges for the future in
his final speech to the Academic Council
yesterday afternoon.
"The damage (of the indirect-cost mat
ter) will not all be undone — but those who
judge us fairly will know that Stanford's
reputation means what it always has, that
our confidence and our sense of moral
authority are intact, and that we are still

fully engaged in the breathtaking ascent in
which Stanford has been engaged over the
past four decades," he said.
Kennedy compared media coverage of
the controvei sy to that of the 1988 West
ern Culture debate. He said that, in the
long run, Stanford's name will emerge
relatively unscathed.
