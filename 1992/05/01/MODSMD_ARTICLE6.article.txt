# Stanford's reputation survives, Kennedy tells Academic Council
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy
reviewed his achievements at Stanford
and outlined challenges for the future in
his final speech to the Academic Council
yesterday afternoon.
"The damage (of the indirect-cost mat
ter) will not all be undone — but those who
judge us fairly will know that Stanford's
reputation means what it always has, that
our confidence and our sense of moral
authority are intact, and that we are still

fully engaged in the breathtaking ascent in
which Stanford has been engaged over the
past four decades," he said.
Kennedy compared media coverage of
the controvei sy to that of the 1988 West
ern Culture debate. He said that, in the
long run, Stanford's name will emerge
relatively unscathed.
"As we learned in the CIV debates,
enlightenment often follows ugly contro
versy at a respectful distance," Kennedy
said. "So it is with the indirect-cost mat
ter, in which honest error and misunder
standing were originally conflated into a

media scandal."
The annual meeting of the Academic
Council — composed of the the Universi
ty's professors — marked one of
Kennedy's last major speeches as presi
dent before June's Commencement.
The approximately 350 faculty in
Kresge Auditorium gave Kennedy a
standing ovation at the end of his 30-
minute speech.
Although large portions of the address
were dedicated to the financial difficulties
that have dominated the University's atten
tion for the past two years, Kennedy

explored a variety of topics, including under
graduate education, faculty issues, campus
facilities and the School of Medicine.
He emphasized Stanford's commit
ment to need-blind admissions and the
policy's importance to multiculturalism.
Some concerns about the future of finan
cial aid have been raised recently because
of statements by incoming University
President Gerhard Casper.
"We have gathered a residential stu
dent body of unequalled diversity, and
joined it enthusiastically in trying to make
the resulting community function well,"

he said. "That effort has depended on the
generosity of those who support an ambi
tious program of financial aid, and on our
commitment — as firm today as ever — to
a policy of need-blind admissions."
"We have received — and we deserve
— national recognition for sustaining a
vivid and successful multicultural envi
ronment," he added.
Kennedy praised appointments to the
faculty during his tenure, saying the cur
rent group is "the most distinguished
