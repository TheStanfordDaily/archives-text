# Senate committees get responsibilities of COP
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Members of next year's student
government turned the Council of
Presidents' responsibilities over to
existing ASSU Senate committees
last night, expanding the commit
tees' responsibilities and slightly
altering their composition.
Ten senators-elect and two
members of the"I Prefer Not to
Have a COP" slate met to decide
on a structure for the COP-less
government.
The plan splits the internal and
external jobs of the COP between
two standing senate committees,
the executive committee and
steering committee.
Under the new system, the
executive committee will be in
charge of administrative duties
within the ASSU. The committee
is currently composed of the sen
ate chair and deputy chair, the
COP and ASSU administrative
and financial managers.
The committee will be restruc
tured to include the senate chair
and chairs of the five ASSU stand
ing committees â€” administration
and rules; budget and finance;
education, research and resi
dences; appropriations; and stu
dent affairs. The financial and
administrative managers will
serve as non-voting members.
The steering committee will
handle the ASSU's external con
tacts, serving as a liaison between
students and the University

administration. Under the new
plan, the committee will be
renamed and will likely be called
the liaison committee.
The steering committee is cur
rently made up of six senators, the
senate chair, the deputy chair and
the parliamentarian. The pro
posed liaison committee will be
made up of one senator from each
of the ASSU standing committees
and the senate deputy chair.
The meeting was prompted by
the victory of the Prefer slate two
weeks ago. Because the slate
pledged to dismantle the COP
once elected, the group met to
redistribute the office's duties.
Undergraduate senator-elect
Erik Maurer said he felt it was
important to have the deputy chair
on the liaison committee, rather
than the senate chair, because the
deputy chair must be a member of
the senate and is elected by the stu
dents. The senate chair, chosen by
the senate, does not have to be an
elected senator.
Ed Mun, a member of the Prefer
slate, said he thought the proposal
was a "fairly decent plan" but
would like to get additional input
from current ASSU members. Mun
said he thought the plan successful
ly disposed of the COP.
According to graduate senator
elect Derek Miyahara, the plan
must be presented for previous
notice at the new senate's first
meeting May 12. The proposal
would then be voted on at the sen
ate's May 26 meeting.
