# RIOTS IN CALIFORNIA CITIES
## 'I was scared for his life': Students from L.A. holding on 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
As Los Angeles suffers through a haze
of mass rioting and looting, Stanford stu
dents — worried about loved ones in the
city — are watching anxiously, hoping
the violence will end soon.
"I was really worried last night," said
freshman Tumaini Rucker, whose family
lives about five minutes from the site of
the Rodney King beating.
"I was on the phone to L.A. every five
minutes," she said.
Rucker said she warned her 14-year
old brother, who frequently rides to the
store on his bicycle, to stay indoors. "I
told him, 'Don't go anywhere,' " she said.
"I was very scared for his life."
Freshman Marisol Ocampo, another

Los Angeles resident, said she too is wor
ried about the effects of the rioting on her
family. "My cousin is really scared," she
said. "Everything around him is all
burned."
Joi Spencer, a sophomore, said the sit
uation "makes me really think about my
family." Her mother, who works in Los
Angeles, has been stuck at a relative's
house in the city since Wednesday.
Spencer said her mother could not return
home from work because of the heavy
rioting.
She and her family are "praying and
holding on," Spencer said. But she added,
"Pretty soon things will get better
because they can't get any worse."
The unstable situation in Los Angeles
is also having immediate effects on about
65 Stanford students who were sched

uled to fly to the city for an entertain
ment symposium this weekend.
Their trip, organized by Ram's Head
Theatrical Society and the Stanford
Alumni in Entertainment Club, was can
celled early yesterday afternoon because
of the curfew and tensions in the area.
Trip participants were disappointed by
the sudden cancellation, but were "more
upset about what's happening in L_A,"
said junior David Cullinan.
Students from Los Angeles said they
were shocked by the King trial's out
come, but some said the violence and riot
ing were not "rational" ways of dealing
with the situation.
And although commentators have said
the outcry against the trial's verdict may
spark a renewed push for civil rights,
freshman Prashant Shah — who went to

high school in the downtown Los Angeles
area — remains cynical.
"I don't think anything different is
going to come out of this," he said.
"Everybody thinks there's going to be a
revolution or something."
"I think it'll die down in a couple of
weeks."
Freshman Gingi Duff, whose Pico-
Fairfax home is just two blocks away
from one blaze, said the verdict that trig
gered the violence still makes her more
angry.
"I can fully understand what the moti
vations are for the rioters' actions," she
said. "I feel the same anger they feel."
Duff said she felt frustrated and
betrayed by the not-guilty verdict, adding
that she could attest to the police brutal
ity in the Los Angeles area.

"It's happened to my loved ones," she
said, citing her boyfriend as an example.
Duff said her boyfriend has been stopped
and interrogated by police for no appar
ent reason.
"They would ask him questions like
where he was going, where he worked,
why he had so much money and whether
he was a member of a gang," Duff said.
Rucker and other students said they
have seen similar incidents. She said the
verdict "really hit home for me."
Duff, who is coordinating the letter
writing campaign on campus, said she
called her mother yesterday to tell her
she might be arrested for civil disobedi
ence. Duffs mother told her she did the
same thing during the 19605.
"It's really ironic to see that nothing
has changed," Duff said.
