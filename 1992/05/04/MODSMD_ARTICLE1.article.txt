# AFTER THE KING VERDICT
## Ralliers call for justice — in King case, in 'the system' Hundreds protest LAPD verdict and racial inequities in America 
### Andy Dworkin Linda Friedlieb Staff writers 
A shouting and cheering
crowd of more than 1,500 people
packed the space between the
Law School and Meyer Library
Friday to protest the verdict in
the Rodney King beating trial.
Most of the crowd was dressed
in black to "mourn the death of
justice in this country," according
to junior Tracy Clay, a rally orga
nizer. Some protesters held up
signs reading "Resist the Police
State" and"The system erupts."
The multiracial crowd lis
tened to an hour and a half of
speeches and song before many
of the protesters began a 2-mile
march to Palo Alto's City Hall
(see related story).
"I simply believe there is a God
that weeps today," Floyd Thomp
kins, associate dean of Memorial
Church, told the ralliers.
And according to Dean of
Students Michael Jackson,
"Every blow that was crashed
down on [King'sl head and on
his body was a blow to justice,
freedom, humanity and each of
us, because we were hit."
The rally began at noon with a

group of singers and drummers
performing "Billy Club Groove,"
the same song was played at a rally
held when King was beaten four
teen months ago, according to per
former James Rucker, a senior.
The song led into a chant:
"The first thing we did right was
the day we started to fight."
Much of the crowd then sang
what one organizer called "The
Black National Anthem," ending
with the verse "Facing the rising
sun of a new day begun, let us
march on 'till victory is won."
Over 20 speakers addressed
the crowd, calling for justice and
a unified response to the verdict.
"My community has been
destroyed . . . long-standing busi
nesses that have been there for
as long as I can remember," said
freshman Gingi Duff, who lives
in an area of Los Angeles dam
aged by fire.
"I am saddened by the self
destruction [but] I understand
the frustration that they are
going through when people are
not listening," Duff said. "The
problem is thus: Too many times
have we looked for solace in our
justice system, only to be denied."


An estimated 1,500 people rally Friday afternoon to protest the verdict in the Rodney King beating case. About 20 speakers addressed
the crowd during the 90-minute rally, held on the lawn between Meyer Library and the Law School. One speaker, referring to the state of
race relations in the United States, told the crowd: "If it doesn't look bad to you, you aren't looking good."
After her speech, Duff stepped offstage,
crying and hugging her friends for support.
Ujamaa Resident Assistant Bacardi Jack
son, who was a main organizer of the rally
along with Clay, said the event was "not just
about political brutality or Rodney King —
this is a system thing."
Jackson condemned the rioting spawned
by the King verdict, and asked the crowd to
work together to stop the violence.
"We can't have black people killing black
people or black people killing Chicano peo
ple," she said. "We're doing their job for
them and we ain't about that."
"Does it take a crisis to make us work
together?" Jackson asked.
She said the rally organizers had also
planned several long-term projects, includ
ing a voter registration drive, a letter-writ
ing campaign and a program to "reach out
to high school students."
Several religious leaders spoke at the
rally. Rabbi Ari Cartun, who said he spent
Thursday preparing for Yom HaShoah, a
Jewish ceremony remembering the holo
caust, said "the parallels are obvious"
between the holocaust and the King verdict.
"The only difference between 50 years
ago in Nazi Germany and today is what we
will put up with," he said.
Thompkins he was "tired" of being asked
to comment on the verdict. "The only reason

that folk are coming and talking to [black
leaders] is because we got angry," he said.
"Our opinion did not matter a few days ago."
He is also tired of moral relativism,
Thompkins said. "I am tired of the gray
area. There are some things that are right
and some things that are wrong," he said,
like the acquittals.
"Let me be racial. Our opinion didn't mat
ter that day, but whose did? It was a mostly
white jury," he said. "When the juror said she
walked in the courtroom and decided it wasn't
about race, she missed the whole point."
Thompkins criticized the University as
well as the justice system, saying the Univer
sity "ain't got no black president, no Chicano
president, and no woman president. The
president of this university is a white male."
He lamented the state of race relations
in America today: "If it doesn't look bad to
you, you aren't looking good."
Stanford administrators also spoke at
the rally, expressing pride in the student
organized gathering and anger at the King
verdict.
Jackson, the dean of students, called
himself "a child of South Central LA," and
said he felt "betrayed" and "hurt" by the
verdict. He added that it showed "how far
we have to go as a society."
Jackson said he was not surprised at the
racially mixed audience. "This is the new
Stanford," he said. "It's a diverse commu
nity, and the issues affect a diverse group."
Multicultural Educator Greg Ricks said
the gathering was "probably one of the
biggest rallies in the school's history," and

called it a "phenomenal expression of stu
dent leadership."
Ricks called for students to fight racial
intolerance. "The person who is racist
today and sexist tomorrow will be homo
phobic the next day. People don't edit
oppression. If they are oppressors one day,
they are oppressors the next day,"he said.

'The only difference between
50 years ago in Nazi Ger
many and today is what we
will put up with.'

Vice President for Student Resources
Mary Edmonds told the crowd of her expe
riences with racism when she was in col
lege. She remembered a ride on a segregat
ed train in Georgia.
"When I boarded that train and had to sit
in a segregated car next to the furnace, the
pain was just as if I had been hit in the stom
ach," she said, adding she felt the same kind
of pain after the death of Martin Luther King
and the acquittals in the Rodney King trial.
"We have always lived with that pain.
It's what we do in spite of that pain that
matters," she said.
Edmonds said the rally was "very excit
ing" and she was "pleased with the organi
zation" of the event."I am glad to be at a

university which supports this type of
expression," she said.
"It shows that multiculturalism is real
on this campus," Edmonds added. "The
effort that the university has invested has
paid off when you see people from all races
come together on this issue."
Freshman Anita Goel told the crowd,
"All of you have to see that we are fighting
for the same cause," adding that all Ameri
cans must "work together for the common
interest of eliminating racism."
Speakers from outside the Stanford
community added their pleas for racial
equality. Charlie Mae Night, superinten
dent of the Ravenswood School District,
said she wanted to "send a message to the
leadership that they are disconnected from
the people they are leading."
"Stop having the professors give you
mundane, frivolous projects. Stop spending
time on the life cycle of a flea," she said. "I
want you to spend time on the inequalities
in education."
June Jordan, a speaker from UC-Berke
ley, said, "I hope we would actually live to
see one episode of justice before the law."
"Rodney King was denied due process of the
law. He was not judged by a jury of his
peers," she said. "The brutality was clear,
the brutality was nauseating."
Jordan said she could understand the
anger of the rioters. "A violated people
reacted with violence. Why should victims
cooperate with their oppressors?"
