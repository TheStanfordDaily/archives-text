A shouting and cheering
crowd of more than 1,500 people
packed the space between the
Law School and Meyer Library
Friday to protest the verdict in
the Rodney King beating trial.
Most of the crowd was dressed
in black to "mourn the death of
justice in this country," according
to junior Tracy Clay, a rally orga
nizer. Some protesters held up
signs reading "Resist the Police
State" and"The system erupts."
The multiracial crowd lis
tened to an hour and a half of
speeches and song before many
of the protesters began a 2-mile
march to Palo Alto's City Hall
(see related story).
"I simply believe there is a God
that weeps today," Floyd Thomp
kins, associate dean of Memorial
Church, told the ralliers.
And according to Dean of
Students Michael Jackson,
"Every blow that was crashed
down on [King'sl head and on
his body was a blow to justice,
freedom, humanity and each of
us, because we were hit."
The rally began at noon with a

group of singers and drummers
performing "Billy Club Groove,"
the same song was played at a rally
held when King was beaten four
teen months ago, according to per
former James Rucker, a senior.
The song led into a chant:
"The first thing we did right was
the day we started to fight."
Much of the crowd then sang
what one organizer called "The
Black National Anthem," ending
with the verse "Facing the rising
sun of a new day begun, let us
march on 'till victory is won."
Over 20 speakers addressed
the crowd, calling for justice and
a unified response to the verdict.
"My community has been
destroyed . . . long-standing busi
nesses that have been there for
as long as I can remember," said
freshman Gingi Duff, who lives
in an area of Los Angeles dam
aged by fire.
"I am saddened by the self
destruction [but] I understand
the frustration that they are
going through when people are
not listening," Duff said. "The
problem is thus: Too many times
have we looked for solace in our
justice system, only to be denied."


An estimated 1,500 people rally Friday afternoon to protest the verdict in the Rodney King beating case. About 20 speakers addressed
the crowd during the 90-minute rally, held on the lawn between Meyer Library and the Law School. One speaker, referring to the state of
race relations in the United States, told the crowd: "If it doesn't look bad to you, you aren't looking good."
