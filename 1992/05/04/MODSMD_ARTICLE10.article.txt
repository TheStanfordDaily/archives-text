# Painting of nude female removed from Coffee House after women's complaints
## 
### Jessica Bar 
A painting of a female nude was removed
from the Coffee House recently after several
women complained that they found it offen
sive.
Heather Dunn, coordinator for the Office of
Student Activities, said she decided to take the
painting down after being told the Coffee
House was an inappropriate place to display
senior Eric Butters' portrait of a nude woman
reclining on a bed.
The woman is pictured lying back on pil
lows, with the leg in the foreground straight
and the other bent at the knee. Her legs are
spread slightly, and her pubic hair and breasts
are visible.
Dunn said she spoke to Butters and he
agreed to remove the painting himself April
25, although he did not think it was offensive.
"Sexuality is a part of art," Butters said. "If
the painting had been a reproduction of a Bot
ticelli or a Goya, would I have been asked to
take it down?"
But he said he would not allow photographs
of the painting because his girlfriend, who
posed for it, objected.
According to Dunn, the decision to remove
the painting was a "tough call."
"You don't want to be accused of being
someone like Jesse Helms — 'I know good
art when I see it,' " she said. "We must be
sensitive to issues of the artist and of
women on this campus who find this very
offensive."
Dunn said one woman in particular, a grad
uate student who did not give her name, was
"affected dramatically" by the painting and
felt it was very degrading.
The woman held the painting up as an

example of the "pervasive accepted sexism" on
the Stanford campus, Dunn said.
"She didn't object to nudes but to that par
ticular pose chosen," Dunn said. "It expressed
something that she felt was very inappropri
ate for that venue. Since it was displayed in
the Coffee House, she did not have a choice
whether to view it or not."
The woman, a graduate student in the
"hard sciences," told Dunn that she believes
women in her field have a difficult time com
peting for respect.
"When she went to the Coffee House for
lunch with her colleagues, who are mostly
male, she felt very uncomfortable with this
(painting) right in front of her and no choice
whether to see it or not," Dunn said.
Butters said he did not expect such an
"extreme" reaction to the painting, titled "Tri
-99
cia.
"That's weird that someone who goes to
Stanford would have that viewpoint," he said.
"When I heard about this complaint I thought
that it would be an old lady who complained,
who would be that conservative."
"I didn't consider that it might be offensive
or pornographic or anything like that," he
said. "I wanted it definitely to be a very sexual
and sensual painting, but the overall quality I
wanted it to be was a celebration of the female
body and to express the inner peace of the
body."
The painting was one of 13 by Butters that
have been hanging in the Coffee House since
April 14.
The exhibit is scheduled to continue
through the end of the school year, but But
ters said the painting that was removed was
one of his favorites.
"It was the painting that got the most posi

tive response," he said. "When I was taking it
down, one woman said, 'Oh, don't take it
down. It's beautiful.'"
Butters said he talked to Dunn, who super
vises Coffee House student exhibits, during
winter quarter about displaying his artwork in
the Coffee House.
At the time, Dunn said, he mentioned only
that he would be displaying landscapes.
Besides a self-portrait, all of the other works
in the exhibit are landscapes.
The idea for "Tricia" came to him after
Dunn had already approved the exhibit, But
ters said.
Edna Chavira, assistant manager of the
Coffee House, echoed the feelings of the
women who complained.
"I was surprised to see it there," she said. "I
know it bothered us working here, because I
don't think it's the right place to be hanging."
"I was not offended by the painting itself. I
just think it was kind of inappropriate."
Dunn said she gave the graduate student
Butters' telephone number and suggested she
express her concern to him. But Butters said
he has not heard from the woman.
"It's important for the artist to understand
and know how women are responding," Dunn
said.
"In the classroom, in the Coffee House,
wherever we are we need to take advantage of
opportunities on this campus and help people
learn."
Dunn said it is difficult to "strike an
appropriate balance between free expression
and between the mores and values of a soci
ety."
"What may be appropriate for the artistic
community may not be for the Stanford com
munity. How do you make that call?"

down, one woman said, 'Oh, don't take it
down. It's beautiful.'"
Butters said he talked to Dunn, who super
vises Coffee House student exhibits, during
winter quarter about displaying his artwork in
the Coffee House.
At the time, Dunn said, he mentioned only
that he would be displaying landscapes.
Besides a self-portrait, all of the other works
in the exhibit are landscapes.
The idea for "Tricia" came to him after
Dunn had already approved the exhibit, But
ters said.
Edna Chavira, assistant manager of the
Coffee House, echoed the feelings of the
women who complained.
"I was surprised to see it there," she said. "I
know it bothered us working here, because I
don't think it's the right place to be hanging."
"I was not offended by the painting itself. I
just think it was kind of inappropriate."
Dunn said she gave the graduate student
Butters' telephone number and suggested she
express her concern to him. But Butters said
he has not heard from the woman.
"It's important for the artist to understand
and know how women are responding," Dunn
said.
"In the classroom, in the Coffee House,
wherever we are we need to take advantage of
opportunities on this campus and help people
learn."
Dunn said it is difficult to "strike an
appropriate balance between free expression
and between the mores and values of a soci
ety."
"What may be appropriate for the artistic
community may not be for the Stanford com
munity. How do you make that call?"
A painting of a female nude was removed
from the Coffee House recently after several
women complained that they found it offen
sive.
Heather Dunn, coordinator for the Office of
Student Activities, said she decided to take the
painting down after being told the Coffee
House was an inappropriate place to display
senior Eric Butters' portrait of a nude woman
reclining on a bed.
The woman is pictured lying back on pil
lows, with the leg in the foreground straight
and the other bent at the knee. Her legs are
spread slightly, and her pubic hair and breasts
are visible.
Dunn said she spoke to Butters and he
agreed to remove the painting himself April
25, although he did not think it was offensive.
"Sexuality is a part of art," Butters said. "If
the painting had been a reproduction of a Bot
ticelli or a Goya, would I have been asked to
take it down?"
But he said he would not allow photographs
of the painting because his girlfriend, who
posed for it, objected.
According to Dunn, the decision to remove
the painting was a "tough call."
"You don't want to be accused of being
someone like Jesse Helms — 'I know good
art when I see it,' " she said. "We must be
sensitive to issues of the artist and of
women on this campus who find this very
offensive."
Dunn said one woman in particular, a grad
uate student who did not give her name, was
"affected dramatically" by the painting and
felt it was very degrading.
The woman held the painting up as an

example of the "pervasive accepted sexism" on
the Stanford campus, Dunn said.
"She didn't object to nudes but to that par
ticular pose chosen," Dunn said. "It expressed
something that she felt was very inappropri
ate for that venue. Since it was displayed in
the Coffee House, she did not have a choice
whether to view it or not."
The woman, a graduate student in the
"hard sciences," told Dunn that she believes
women in her field have a difficult time com
peting for respect.
"When she went to the Coffee House for
lunch with her colleagues, who are mostly
male, she felt very uncomfortable with this
(painting) right in front of her and no choice
whether to see it or not," Dunn said.
Butters said he did not expect such an
"extreme" reaction to the painting, titled "Tri
-99
cia.
"That's weird that someone who goes to
Stanford would have that viewpoint," he said.
"When I heard about this complaint I thought
that it would be an old lady who complained,
who would be that conservative."
"I didn't consider that it might be offensive
or pornographic or anything like that," he
said. "I wanted it definitely to be a very sexual
and sensual painting, but the overall quality I
wanted it to be was a celebration of the female
body and to express the inner peace of the
body."
The painting was one of 13 by Butters that
have been hanging in the Coffee House since
April 14.
The exhibit is scheduled to continue
through the end of the school year, but But
ters said the painting that was removed was
one of his favorites.
"It was the painting that got the most posi

tive response," he said. "When I was taking it
down, one woman said, 'Oh, don't take it
down. It's beautiful.'"
