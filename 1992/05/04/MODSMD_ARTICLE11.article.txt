Vandals hit Hoover
The phrases "Fascism is here" and "Freedom,
No justice, No peace," were spray-painted on the
entrance to Hoover Tower sometime Friday
night.
According to Kim Geil, the coordinator of Guide
and Visitors Service, the black spray-paint — an
apparent reaction to last week's verdict in the Rod
ney King case — was discovered Saturday morning.
Police sergeant Philip Love said the graffiti will
be investigated further this week.
Ujamaa Resident Assistant Bacardi Jackson
said she was unaware of the graffiti but that those
involved with the Rodney King protests have not

encouraged such actions.
"We're trying to direct people's energies into
constructive efforts rather than defacing proper
ty," she said.
Peaceful tactics were encouraged at Friday's
King rally at the Law School, but the Hoover Insti
tution was mentioned several times by individual
speakers.
During the rally, sophomore Kwame Anku
alluded to possible racist incidents at Hoover, and
Associate Dean of Memorial Church Floyd
Thompkins criticized U.S. foreign policy and
Hoover's involvement with it.
