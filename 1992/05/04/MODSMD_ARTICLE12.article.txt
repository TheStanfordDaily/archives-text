Precarious 'peace' holds in Los Angeles
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The City of Angels prayed for peace
under armed guard at church services yesterday in riot-torn
areas, and the death toll rose to 46, making the three-day ram
page the nation's bloodiest civil unrest in 75 years.
Two National Guardsmen shot and critically wounded the driv
er of a sports car who tried to run them down last night, police said.
It was the first use of deadly force by troops patrolling the city.
Earlier in the day, gunmen riding in a pickup truck fired at
Marines standing guard at a Long Beach intersection, but no one
was hurt and the Marines didn't return fire, said police Cmdr.
Anthony Batts.
And gunshots were fired at a police car near a church. As ser
vices at the Greater Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church in
South Central Los Angeles were ending, the pastor asked the con
gregation to remain inside while police investigated.
"We'd like it to be over," said Willie Tagger, 54, an aircraft
mechanic. "I don't think it will end until Chief (Daryl) Gates is
gone and the four police officers are gone. How can we heal if the
problem is still there? We can never forget it."
The mood appeared more relaxed Sunday in most of the city.
Troops in Koreatown were smiling and in some places posted
without weapons or helmets.
One pair of National Guardsmen danced to the loud music of a car
radio at a traffic light.
Police, guardsmen and Highway Patrol officers took snapshots of
one another with burned buildings as backdrops.
Sightseers created traffic jams in riot areas throughout the day
Sunday, even though police warned of danger and tried to dis
courage such outings.
Dusk-to-dawn curfews were to remain in place Sunday night in
at least 25 cities in the Los Angeles basin.
Mayor Tom Bradley said the restriction would be lifted in Los
Angeles this morning, but troops and police would remain in
place.
Restrictions on city bus service through South Central Los
Angeles were lifted yesterday, the first time public transportation
was available to the riot area since Wednesday.
At least 46 people were killed, including three people^added to
the toll by the coroner's office Sunday. More than 2,300 people
were hurt.
