The violence unleashed
in L.A. by the King case
exposed America's chasm

THE POLICE CREDO says an
officer's role is "to serve and to
protect" the American people.
However, in the face of last
week's acquittal of four white
police officers accused of excessive
ly beating a black motorist, this
commitment falls flat.
The message sent to Americans
is that the police serve and protect
the rights of some at the expense
of others.
The jury's verdict stands as a
stark example of the attitudes that
prevent people of color from enjoy
ing all the rights and freedoms
guaranteed under the Constitu
tion. How can Americans expect
minorities to keep their already
fragile faith in the system when
such blatant displays of injustice
rattle the very ideals upon which
this country was founded?
The selection of Simi Valley, a
nearly 100 percent white subur
ban community that houses the
Reagan library, as the location for
the trial made a "not guilty" ver
dict almost predictable.
In the eyes of many suburban
ites, the police's job is to protect
them and their children from all
Rodney Kings. This image of the
black male as savage criminal, who
lives to steal from whites, is the
specter hovering in the subcon
scious of white America. It is an atti
tude that allows many people — and
certainly the jurors in the King case
— to rationalize police brutality.
But for many urbanites, the
police loom as a threat to their
rights and safety, not a protector of
them. The acquittal rang out as a
confirmation of their belief: If you
are a minority, the police have
license to brutalize you.
One juror, who appeared on
ABC's "Nightline," said Rodney
King "was in control" at every

moment throughout the beating.
"He could have stopped it at any
moment," she asserted.
In this juror's eyes, the police
did no more than what was neces
sary in order to control King.
This message converted the
Southern Californian night into
day as fires ravaged the Southland.
Although the majority of protests
across the country were peaceful,
this incident lit the fuse of a 30-
year-old stick of racial dynamite in
Los Angeles.
While violence and destruction of
property are not legitimate reac
tions to the decision, they are
understandable. With chronic
unemployment and poverty endem
ic in South Central Los Angeles, it's
not surprising that residents would
lash out against "the system."
This situation highlights a deep
er economic problem that extends
far beyond racism — people of sev
eral races took part in the looting,
and black-owned businesses were
hit right along with Korean and
white-owned stores.
The looters were not thinking of
themselves. When they annihilat
ed the commercial section of their
area, they destroyed their econom
ic future along with the property.
The only way to prevent this
travesty from re-occurring is to
address the economic plight of peo
ple who live in neighborhoods like
South Central Los Angeles.
Knowledge paves the road to suc
cess in this country, and only edu
cation will allow individuals to
break out of poverty.
And with governmental support
of minority-owned businesses,
neighborhoods will soon become
self-reliant, phasing out the need
for additional support and break
ing down the stereotypes that per
petuate racism.
The tension between the
"haves" and the "have-nots" in
America — exacerbated by the
policies of the Reagan and Bush
Administrations — is an escalating
crisis that can wait no longer, as
the eruptions in Los Angeles
demonstrated.
