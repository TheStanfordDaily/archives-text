## Willie Horton was nothing 
### 
INSTEAD OF TRYING to profit from
the anger and frustration that have
been violently expressed since the
acquittal of the L.A. police officers who
beat Rodney King, Jerry Brown should
call it quits. Right now.
He and all his supporters should join
the Clinton-for-President campaign and
back the Arkansas governor with all the
energy they can muster. We've had our
chance to argue about how good a hope
Clinton represents. Now is the time to
give him a powerful mandate.
The last thing we need are "outsider"
candidates like Brown and Ross Perot.
Every day these candidates survive is
another day President Bush goes to sleep
happy, knowing the anti-status quo vote is
split. Only one outsider, Clinton — with his
ties to the Democratic party — has even an
iota of a chance of making things better.
The verdict in the L.A.P.D. trial, the
change of venue that helped bring about
that verdict, the decision by LA. Police
Chief Daryl Gates to ignore his own pre
diction of violence and not to prepare for
riots in mostly black neighborhoods, bring
ing in force only when the riots began to
spread to Hollywood and Westwood —
these are just a few items on a never-end
ing Republican ledger of injustice.
The anger and frustration being
expressed go way beyond the specifics of
one trial. Bush, in his address to the
nation Friday, promised civil cases

against the police officers. Big deal. Thou
sands of people aren't stopping business
as usual in this country for one man's bad
shake — no matter how gruesome it was.
This is about fundamental inequities —
bad shakes for thousands of people, people
resembling King in all respects save one:
Their stories aren't captured on film.
Twelve years of unfathomable income
disparity, 12 years of a malicious disre
gard for racial harmony and equality, 12
years of reactionary judicial appoint
ments — that's what Republican presi
dents have given us on the social front.
And we can look forward to more, par
ticularly Bush's practiced art of wedge
driving. The Willie Horton commercial
was nothing. Keep in mind the footage of
the white truck driver being kicked and
beaten in the L.A. rioting. The next time
you see it, it may be followed by the
words: "Paid for by Bush/Quayle '92."
Shameful, that's all you can say. And
yet even more shameful than the way in
which Bush is likely to play upon the
fears of white Americans in coming
months is the way in which those white
Americans will likely succumb to that
type of campaigning.
We can't stop Bush from using these
tactics. But we can and must choose not
to give in. It's not as if violence will con
tinue if change doesn't occur (Bush's
implicit message); the violence is the
result of change not having occurred.

Thousands
resemble King,
in all respects
save one: Their
stories aren't
captured on
film.

It is truly horrible that people have to
die — people who, as King poignantly
said Friday, "will never go home." But
sadly there are limits to the peaceful,
intelligent expressions of civil disobedi
ence like that performed Friday by 500 or
so members of the Stanford community
in front of Palo Alto City Hall, limits that
exist precisely because of the problems
the protests are aimed at. Until there's
violence, who listens?
If ever there was a time for change —
for voters to break the bonds with the
current government — now is that time.
And this message is for white people;
people of color already know it: "Their
problem" is our problem.
If you're scared by the violence you've
seen in the past week, for God's sake don't
vote for the guy who's going to keep doing
the same old thing — responding to, instead
of anticipating, problems, reacting to vio
lence instead of planting the seeds that will
make the need for that violence obsolete.
No matter how rich, how comfortable,
how "immune," don't ever think this
isn't about you; don't ever think this isn't
about us.

type of campaigning.
We can't stop Bush from using these
tactics. But we can and must choose not
to give in. It's not as if violence will con
tinue if change doesn't occur (Bush's
implicit message); the violence is the
result of change not having occurred.

Thousands
resemble King,
in all respects
save one: Their
stories aren't
captured on
film.

It is truly horrible that people have to
die — people who, as King poignantly
said Friday, "will never go home." But
sadly there are limits to the peaceful,
intelligent expressions of civil disobedi
ence like that performed Friday by 500 or
so members of the Stanford community
in front of Palo Alto City Hall, limits that
exist precisely because of the problems
the protests are aimed at. Until there's
violence, who listens?
If ever there was a time for change —
for voters to break the bonds with the
current government — now is that time.
And this message is for white people;
people of color already know it: "Their
problem" is our problem.
If you're scared by the violence you've
seen in the past week, for God's sake don't
vote for the guy who's going to keep doing
the same old thing — responding to, instead
of anticipating, problems, reacting to vio
lence instead of planting the seeds that will
make the need for that violence obsolete.
No matter how rich, how comfortable,
how "immune," don't ever think this
isn't about you; don't ever think this isn't
about us.
