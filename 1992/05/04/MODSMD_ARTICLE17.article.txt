King trial, rioting reflect deep malaise in American society

IAM DEEPLY SADDENED by the
events that have just transpired sur
rounding the verdict of the Los Ange
les police brutality trial. The initial
announcement of the verdict sent shock
waves across the country. The subse
quent rioting in Los Angeles added frus
tration and sadness.
As a law student at Stanford Univer
sity, I am especially affected by the out
come of this trial, because it suggests
fundamental deficiencies in the criminal
justice system. Most, if not all, of us who
viewed the videotape of the March 3,
1991 beating have no doubt that exces
sive force was used.
One juror even said, after the verdict
had been handed down, that when he
first viewed the videotape, he did not
believe that the jury would ever be able
to acquit.

But something happened during trial
to change his mind. I submit that it was
the blindness of the jury to the realities
of racism in urban America.
Can a person of color receive a fair
trial in this country? Many of our cur
rent procedures are inadequate to pro
vide this, especially if a person of color is
the victim.
The venue of this trial, for example,
was changed from Los Angeles County
to Ventura County, which is only 2.2
percent Black.
While it is extremely rare for a judge
to grant a change of venue in a criminal
case, the change was granted to provide
the defendants with their constitutional
right to a "fair trial."
Many people thought that this was
enough to preserve the integrity of the
trial. What we need, however, is to

establish mechanisms which can guaran
tee the overall fairness of the trial. It is
especially important in a case so replete
with issues of race that the jury be
racially mixed.
In the end, we have a verdict that is
just plain wrong! And we have an entire
community, in fact, an entire nation, up
in-arms!
Perceiving that the Black community
had lost faith in their government, Califor
nia Gov. Pete Wilson quoted Black leaders
of the past in an effort to reinforce the his
torical disapproval of violent protest.
His repeated references to the commu
nity's actions as "wrong and senseless"
ignore the reality of the situation. This
response is not senseless. These people are
very angry and have basically lost hope.
So what is the solution? Senator
Bradley from New Jersey suggests that

the people of South Central L.A. channel
their anger into social and economic pro
grams. However, the larger problem of
racism cannot be solved in this way.
These people need to believe that they
have a place in society. That they have a
government that is willing to protect
their rights.
What I worry about is the future of
the youth — young people who have
drive, goals, and ambition. What mes
sage does all of this send them? That no
matter what, you're always Black first,
and Black people have no rights.
We need to think hard and long about
what we can do to stop racism. We need
to give the people of South Central L.A.
and people just like them all across the
country reason to carry on.
