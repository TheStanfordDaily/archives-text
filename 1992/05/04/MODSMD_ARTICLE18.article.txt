# Student shares lessons from Friday's rally
## 
### 
I grew up in New York City, only a
few blocks off of Park Avenue. I am a
child of wealth, privilege and power.
I will never experience the subtle
racism that all blacks experience. I am
sure that I have unintentionally bought in
to that racism. As I watched the violence
and the protests over the Rodney King
case develop, I was struck by three ideas.
As the CNN chopper displayed the
burning carnage of South Central L.A., I
said to myself, "They are burning their
own neighborhood. The black-owned
businesses that have fought for survival
are being destroyed by their own people."
If the forgotten minorities truly want
ed to be heard they should have marched
on Bevorty llills. They should have laid
the bodies at the doors of Orange County.
Make the comfortable, wealthy upper
class uncomfortable. Make racism a problem
that the rich and powerful cannot ignore.

My second thought occurred to me
while I watched the rally in front of the
Law School last Friday. Speaker after
speaker rose and gave an impassioned
plea for their own little idea, their par
ticular program. Very few speakers had
a broad vision of the problems.
With all the emotion that is floating
around right now the last thing this
movement needs is factionalism. We
need to maintain unity and be driven by
a single vision.
Fighting among ourselves for one pro
gram or another will only destroy every
thing we are working for.
The final thing that occurred to me as
I sat there and listened was that we were
preaching to the converted. I already
believe in the causes being espoused.
What I, and all those like me need to
do, is to head back to Park Avenue,
Greenwich Connecticut, Newport Beach,
Winnetka and get those who think that
these problems don't affect them to real
ize that these issues affect everyone.
