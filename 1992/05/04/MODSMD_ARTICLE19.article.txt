# Privacy issue invalid for federal drug plan
## 
### 
Isn't it a little late for The Daily's edi
torial board to be so concerned about the
invasion of our privacy by the federal
government?
The trustees of Stanford made a deci
sion about whether they want to take
the university public, and they said yes.
As long as federal or state money sup
ports students and research, one really
shouldn't be shocked to find legislators
eager to influence what goes on here.
Stanford's pre-eminence is due to the
outstanding research of many of its fac
ulty. Why should we give up government
funding so a few kids can get loaded
without risking their financial aid?
If some Daily editors really believe in
the protection of individual privacy as a
principle, then they are in the minority
on this campus.
The bulk of governmental financial
aid originates from people who do not

value a Stanford education. Instead,
they value freedom from the invasion of
their privacy by the Internal Revenue
Service. I haven't met many students or
faculty who'd want to see the IRS abol
ished. You cannot simultaneously stand
for privacy and the existence of the IRS.
If The Daily's editors want to per
suade legislators, then they should argue
that enforcing the Justice Department's
"Denial of Federal Benefits Program"
initiative would be too expensive or that
talking about drugs would just promote
more drug usage.
Many of our politicians serving in our
nation's interest attended fine private
universities. They understand these
arguments. They are not simple enough
to be persuaded by any principled con
cern for privacy.
We have to leave principled thinking
to those few on the lunatic fringe who
have the time and energy. There's too
much else to do here.
