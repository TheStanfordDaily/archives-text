Chanting "400 years and still
not free" and calling for a boycott
of a local store, more than 1,000
people marched from Stanford to
Palo Alto City Hall Friday.
The demonstrators, mostly
students, filled the intersection
outside City Hall and the Palo Alto
Police Station for over an hour

At about 3 p.m., the protest
moved to Copeland's Sports on
University Avenue. Although
other businesses closed because
of the march, including several
banks, Copeland's was the only
one to board up its windows.
"To board up because of
Stanford students on a peaceful
march is a huge insult," said
Multicultural Educator Greg

Ricks, who called for a "full
blooded, full-out boycott of
Copeland's in every way."
The march started at 1:30
p.m. at the Law School, where
the group had rallied to protest
Wednesday's acquittal of the
white police officers involved in
the beating of King, a black
motorist.
Stanford students appeared
to be the majority in the mul
tiracial group, which at one
point stretched about three city
blocks long.
Boycotting Copeland's
Ricks was the first to speak
about Copeland's boarded up
windows, suggesting the move
to the store.
"We're going to go down to
University Avenue, the heart of
this city," he told the crowd.
"We're going to show them some
