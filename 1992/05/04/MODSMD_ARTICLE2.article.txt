# Students make peaceful march to Palo Alto, block intersections
## 
### Andy Dworkin Linda Friedlieb Staff writers 
Chanting "400 years and still
not free" and calling for a boycott
of a local store, more than 1,000
people marched from Stanford to
Palo Alto City Hall Friday.
The demonstrators, mostly
students, filled the intersection
outside City Hall and the Palo Alto
Police Station for over an hour
while speakers addressed the ver
dict in the Rodney King case and
the violence that followed it.
At about 3 p.m., the protest
moved to Copeland's Sports on
University Avenue. Although
other businesses closed because
of the march, including several
banks, Copeland's was the only
one to board up its windows.
"To board up because of
Stanford students on a peaceful
march is a huge insult," said
Multicultural Educator Greg

Ricks, who called for a "full
blooded, full-out boycott of
Copeland's in every way."
The march started at 1:30
p.m. at the Law School, where
the group had rallied to protest
Wednesday's acquittal of the
white police officers involved in
the beating of King, a black
motorist.
Stanford students appeared
to be the majority in the mul
tiracial group, which at one
point stretched about three city
blocks long.
Boycotting Copeland's
Ricks was the first to speak
about Copeland's boarded up
windows, suggesting the move
to the store.
"We're going to go down to
University Avenue, the heart of
this city," he told the crowd.
"We're going to show them some

Following the campus rally Friday, several hundred students and others marched to Palo Alto, where
they held demonstrations on University Avenue and in front of City Hall.
radical economic policy that's big
ger than 20,000 fires.
"This is militant action. This is
a serious thing," Ricks said.
He called the store's actions an
insult to students. "These are the
most educated people in the coun
try. We're not rioters, we're schol
ars," he said.
The owner of Copeland's did
not return several telephone calls.
Protesters filled the block in
front of the store for about an
hour before returning to campus.
Not all the demonstrators
agreed with the move to
Copeland's. Palo Alto resident
Geoff Mutch said he feared vio
lence might erupt. Ricks' state
ments "sound like a formula for
physical violence if I ever heard
one, especially in a crowd situa
tion," Mutch said.
He also said he feared moving
the rally would "hurt the dia
logue" the group had established.
"There's no one person in this
crowd that can remind people of
the important issues if they're
heated up," he said.
Hut junior Tracy Clay, one of
the march's organizers, said the
boycott was "a matter of respect"
for blacks. "Every black student
on campus has been badly treated
by store owners," she said.
About 20 of the march's student
marshalls lined up in front of the
store during the peaceful protest.
Ron Herry, one of the marshalls,
said he was "just trying to protect
Copeland's" in case of violence.
Berry, however, said he agreed
with the boycott. Boarding up the
store was "an insult to our intelli
gence," which "for an angry
crowd is kind of like adding fuel to
the flame," he said.
According to Palo Alto police
Lt. Don Harnett, the move to
Copeland's was coordinated with
the police department.
Harnett said he was not very
concerned about violence, calling
the marchers "up-and-coming
leaders of our city, our state and
our nation."
Merchants react
The two stores surrounding
Copeland's — Peninsula Beauty
Supply and Yosh for Hair — were

also closed, as were at least four
other businesses.
Harnett said the police had
notified all business owners along
the march route Friday morning,
before the demonstration began.
Before the march, Clay said the
purpose of the protest was to "dis
rupt business as usual."
"First and foremost, this is civil
disobedience. That means we're
not down for violence," she said.
"We are taking things over in a
peaceable and forceful manner."
Many business owners kept
their stores open, and several
came to watch the marchers.
Shahin Shokbbe, who owns the
Holiday Cleaners across from City
Hall, said she did not close despite
the rally.
"Everybody is scared because
of what's happened these past two
days, but I think (the marchers)
arc calm," she said.
Shokbbe said she supported
the non-violent protest. "As long
as it is quiet and [does] no harm to
people, it is good, because people
can understand what other people

think," she said.
Marchers in the crowd repre
sented many races and ages. Sev
eral walked with crutches, and at
least one was in a wheelchair.
A few carried signs with mes
sages such as "Remember MLK.
Outrage, yes! Violence, no!" The
crowd of chanting protesters fol
lowed a large banner reading
"Wake up, the revolution has
begun again."
When the crowd reached City
Hall, Clay read a list of
"demands" on federal and local
government officials.
"We call on you, Mr. Presi
dent. You said you were sickened
when you saw the videotape," she
said. "What happened to your dis
gust? We are currently disgusted
with you."
Clay called for a federal investi
gation of how the King case was
handled, and demanded that all
police officers involved in the case
be fired.
She also called for local action,
saying that Palo Alto should cre
ate a "civilian review board" to

look into complaints about police
behavior. Finally, she called for the
police chief and mayor to address
the rally, but neither official did so.
"We are a politician's worst
nightmare," Clay said. "We will
not forget. We will make our voic
es heard in ways they will under
stand."
The only politician to appear at
the rally was Tom Nolan, a mem
ber of the San Mateo County
Board of Supervisors. Clay intro
duced Nolan as a "powerful per
son who wants to continue being a
powerful person."
Nolan called the march "the
most hopeful thing I've seen in
years," and said he was dedicated
to fighting racism in the area.
But marcher David Hauri, a
graduate student, said he did not
think the protests would bring
justice in the King incident.
Hauri said he understood the
violence in Los Angeles. "The people
have to do something. They have no
recourse to the system left," he said.
"Obviously, it's not in their best
interest to burn down their homes,

but it's all that's left for them to do."
For some marchers, Friday's
rally was not the first they had
attended. Carol Nyholm, the assis
tant director of Escondido Village,
said she had marched in 1965 after
Martin Luther King was killed.
"I thought that my work
wasn't done yet," she said. "There
have been gains made, but only
for a few."
"People who sustain the barri
ers work all the time. Those of us
who take them down work for a
while, then sit back," Nyholm
said.
The marchers attracted much
attention from people lining the
route in downtown Palo Alto. Res
ident Trudy Reinhardt said that
although she did not participate,
"I completely support it, assum
ing it's peaceful."
Once the marchers sat down in
the intersection of Bryant and
Hamilton streets in front of City
Hall, a microphone was brought
in for speakers.
Ricks spoke to the crowd, say
ing he could understand the anger
of the rioters in Los Angeles. "I'm
in solidarity with their pain. Vio
lence is never necessarily justifi
able, but it is understandable," he
said.
"Why is it we only understood
AIDS when Magic Johnson got it?
Why is it we only understand
police brutality when we see it on
videotape?" he asked.
Students also addressed the
crowd. Freshman Angel Fabian
said he experienced racism in Palo
Alto when he and four friends
were stopped and searched at an
automatic teller machine.
"I have never felt so humiliated
and violated. But what can I do?
The system will not believe (the
story of) four Mexican-Americans
and a Native American," he said.
Palo Alto Police Capt. Tom
Merson said the police blocked off
traffic to keep the marchers from
being injured, and said the police
were trying to "facilitate people's
free expression, as well as facili
tate public order."
Ujamaa Resident Assistant
Bacardi Jackson ended the rally
by asking every person to hug
someone next to them. "We've all
done a lot of work, and I'm really
impressed by the way Stanford
has mobilized," she said.
"Take a look around. Let's say
'Thank God.' Thank somebody."

Stanford students and others listen to a speaker in front of Copeland's Sports in Palo Alto. The store
was the only one in the area to board up its windows due to the march Friday.
