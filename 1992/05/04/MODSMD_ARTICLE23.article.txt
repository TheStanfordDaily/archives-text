## Men upset No.1 Arizona State, take Pac-10 crown 
### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
They finally have something to
brag about.
The Stanford Cardinal men's
golf team, after climbing from
fourth to third to second in its
previous three tournaments,
reached the mountaintop this
weekend by winning the 1992
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onship and what head coach
Wally Goodwin called "bragging
rights" at the Tristring Tree Golf
Club in Corvallis, Ore.
In putting up its first victory
since the fall and taking its first
conference title in 15 years, the
squad, ranked No. 19 nationally,
beat top-ranked Arizona State by
an incredible 19 strokes and shot
for a one-under-par total of
1,439 over the course of the
three-day, four-round, 72-hole
competition at Oregon State's
home course.
Senior Christian Cevaer, who
has acquired legendary status as
one of Stanford's all-time greats
and is the only graduating mem
ber of the squad, took his second
individual conference crown in a
Cardinal uniform and his first
since 1989.

Cevaer, who became the first
golfer in 24 years to win two Pac
-10 crowns, shot a solid 12-under
par 276. He distanced himself
from his closest competitor,
sophomore teammate Notah
Begay, by shooting a Pac-10
Championship-record 67 on Fri
day and following it up with 68,
72, and 69 tallies on Saturday and
Sunday.
Cevaer summarized the feel
ings of the entire collegiate golf
world in assessing his perfor
mance. "I'm overwhelmed by my
play here," he said.
The last Pac-10 men's golfer to
win two outright conference
crowns was Kemp Richardson of
USC in 1967-68.
Begay firmly positioned him
self as Cevaer's heir apparent by
completing the tournament eight
strokes behind the team captain.
His four-under 284 included a 68
on the final day that contributed
to a surge in which the Cardinal
added 11 strokes to its lead.
Sophomore Casey Martin and
junior Brad Lanning placed sixth
and seventh with totals of 291
and 292, respectively, to give
Stanford an unprecedented four
golfers in the top 10. Freshmen
Steve Burdick (302) and Jerry

Chang (304) contributed to the
victory and gave the team hope
for the post-Cevaer era by finish
ing 34th and 44th, respectively.
Arizona State was in second
place for the entire tournament,
as Stanford enjoyed a five-stroke
margin after the first round, an
11-stroke lead after two, and an
eight-stroke bulge at the end of
three. The Sun Devils were
paced by former U.S. Amateur,
Pac-10, and NCAA Champion
Phil Mickelson, who finished
third in the individual standings
with a respectable three-under
285.
One notable absence from the
team leaderboard was No. 2 Ari
zona, who defeated the Cardinal
at Stanford Golf Course in the
U.S. Intercollegiate Invitational
last weekend. The Wildcats
slipped to fourth in the Pac-10's,
35 strokes off the lead and one
back of third-place California.
The Cardinal gets to savor its
conference triumph for three
weeks, as it will next compete in
the NCAA West Regional Tour
nament May 21-23 in Tucson,
Ariz. If Stanford places in the top
nine there, they will move on to
the NCAA Finals in Albu
querque, NM, two weeks later.
