### Nick Clements Staff writer 
Stanford Track and Field saw their
future at California this weekend. And
they liked it quite a bit.

Track and field

Men: Bears 115, Card 47
Women: Card 83, Bears 62

"I don't think we could have gotten
any more points than we did ... we
maximized our potential," said assistant
coach Scott Chisam after the women's
team won 83-62 and the men lost 115-
47 to the Golden Bears in Stanford's
biggest dual meet of the season.
Jackie Edwards, a 1988 Olympian for
the Bahamas, continued her drive

toward the Olympics as she set a meet
and school record in the triple jump at
43 feet, 1/2 inches. She also won the
long jump with a leap of 21 feet, 1 and
1/4 inches despite only taking one jump,
and took second to Chryste Gaines in
the 100 and 200 meters.
Gaines, a fellow Olympic hopeful,
was clocked at 11.59 in the 100, and
23.42 seconds in the 200. She also ran
the anchor leg on the Cardinal's win
ning 4XIOO relay team.
"Brooks (Johnson, Stanford's head
coach) thought it was going to come
down to the mile relay, but the rest of us
weren't figuring on that," said Gaines.
Two years ago, the women lost to the
Golden Bears on the mile relay, the last
event of the day. This year, though, they
swept the 200 meters to clinch the meet
and then easily cruised to victory.
The win gave the women a 7-6 advan
tage in dual meets with California. "We
get the bragging rights now since we

broke the tie," Gaines said.
The victory was not without a scare,
though. Rhonda Oliver, a key member
of the women's sprinting core, strained
her calf while running in the 400 meters
and had to pull out of the event. Howev
er, the 200 meter sweep and a subse
quent sweep in the 3,000 meters gave
the women more than they needed to
win.
Freshman Andrea Garner set the
tone in the 5,000 meters, the first event
of the day, as she pushed California's
Janet Bowie from the start and took a
strong second place. Bowie, who had to
run in the 1,500 meters only 45 minutes
later, found herself overwhelmed as the
Cardinal swept the event, led by fresh
man Melissa Freeburg.
"The women came through very
strongly in the the distances, starting
with Andrea pushing the lead in the
5,000," Chisam said.
In field events, freshman Jessi
ca Alderman set a personal record
by two feet as she took second in
the shot put.
Fellow frosh Susan Demars
won the discus with a toss of
145 feet, 11 inches. Sophomore
Debbie Templeton took second
in the javelin to round out what
should be a bright future for
the young women's throwing
team.
On the men's side, California's
Brent Burns celebrated his 23rd
birthday in a big way as he won
the pole vault, the 110-meter high
hurdles, and the 100-meter dash
in leading the Golden Bears to an
easy victory, their 21st in a row
over Stanford.
"That's a helluva way to go out
on your birthday," Chisam said.
The Cardinal, though, excelled
in the middle distance and throw
ing events as expected, led by a
sweep in the 5,000 meters by
Dave Scudamore, Gary Stolz, and
Fred Carter. Stolz and Carter also
went 1-2 in the 3,000 meter
steeplechase.
Dave Popejoy, who has quali
fied for the NCAA champi
onships in the hammer throw,
won the event despite a subpar
day with a throw of 192 feet, 7

inches. Toby Norwood took third
at 189 feet.
"Dave and Toby and Ramon
(Alarcon) put together the best
meet in the hammer throw we've
had against Cal in a long time,"
Chisam said.
Sophomore Matt Karsavar
took second to the Golden Bear's
Ramon Jimenez-Gaona in the
shot put with a hurl of 51 feet, 6
1/4 inches. Jimenez-Gaona is the
Paraguayan national champion in
the discus and easily won that
event with a throw of 198 feet, 4
inches.
Freshman Travis Clark estab
lished himself as a fixture in the
Cardinal's future as he won the
high jump, clearing 7 feet even in
a jump-off against the Golden
Bears' Jim O'Sullivan. Clark also
ran the anchor leg of Stanford's
winning 4XIOO-meter relay
team.
"He's definitely going to be
part of the nucleus of this team
for the next three years," Chisam
said.
At one point the meet was
called off due to the turbulent
nature of the Berkeley campus.
"The meet went smoothly,"
Chisam said. "We knew that
Berkeley students are classy peo
ple.
"Both sides told their athletes
to cool it with the taunting this
year. They didn't need any added
pressure, being student athletes."

1/4 inches. Jimenez-Gaona is the
Paraguayan national champion in
the discus and easily won that
event with a throw of 198 feet, 4
inches.
Freshman Travis Clark estab
lished himself as a fixture in the
Cardinal's future as he won the
high jump, clearing 7 feet even in
a jump-off against the Golden
Bears' Jim O'Sullivan. Clark also
ran the anchor leg of Stanford's
winning 4XIOO-meter relay
team.
"He's definitely going to be
part of the nucleus of this team
for the next three years," Chisam
said.
At one point the meet was
called off due to the turbulent
nature of the Berkeley campus.
"The meet went smoothly,"
Chisam said. "We knew that
Berkeley students are classy peo
ple.
"Both sides told their athletes
to cool it with the taunting this
year. They didn't need any added
pressure, being student athletes."
Stanford Track and Field saw their
future at California this weekend. And
they liked it quite a bit.

Men: Bears 115, Card 47
Women: Card 83, Bears 62

"I don't think we could have gotten
any more points than we did ... we
maximized our potential," said assistant
coach Scott Chisam after the women's
team won 83-62 and the men lost 115-
47 to the Golden Bears in Stanford's
biggest dual meet of the season.
Jackie Edwards, a 1988 Olympian for
the Bahamas, continued her drive

toward the Olympics as she set a meet
and school record in the triple jump at
43 feet, 1/2 inches. She also won the
long jump with a leap of 21 feet, 1 and
1/4 inches despite only taking one jump,
and took second to Chryste Gaines in
the 100 and 200 meters.
Gaines, a fellow Olympic hopeful,
was clocked at 11.59 in the 100, and
23.42 seconds in the 200. She also ran
the anchor leg on the Cardinal's win
ning 4XIOO relay team.
"Brooks (Johnson, Stanford's head
coach) thought it was going to come
down to the mile relay, but the rest of us
weren't figuring on that," said Gaines.
Two years ago, the women lost to the
Golden Bears on the mile relay, the last
event of the day. This year, though, they
swept the 200 meters to clinch the meet
and then easily cruised to victory.
The win gave the women a 7-6 advan
tage in dual meets with California. "We
get the bragging rights now since we

broke the tie," Gaines said.
The victory was not without a scare,
though. Rhonda Oliver, a key member
of the women's sprinting core, strained
her calf while running in the 400 meters
and had to pull out of the event. Howev
er, the 200 meter sweep and a subse
quent sweep in the 3,000 meters gave
the women more than they needed to
win.
Freshman Andrea Garner set the
tone in the 5,000 meters, the first event
of the day, as she pushed California's
Janet Bowie from the start and took a
strong second place. Bowie, who had to
run in the 1,500 meters only 45 minutes
later, found herself overwhelmed as the
Cardinal swept the event, led by fresh
man Melissa Freeburg.
"The women came through very
strongly in the the distances, starting
with Andrea pushing the lead in the
5,000," Chisam said.
In field events, freshman Jessi
ca Alderman set a personal record
by two feet as she took second in
the shot put.
Fellow frosh Susan Demars
won the discus with a toss of
145 feet, 11 inches. Sophomore
Debbie Templeton took second
in the javelin to round out what
should be a bright future for
the young women's throwing
team.
On the men's side, California's
Brent Burns celebrated his 23rd
birthday in a big way as he won
the pole vault, the 110-meter high
hurdles, and the 100-meter dash
in leading the Golden Bears to an
easy victory, their 21st in a row
over Stanford.
"That's a helluva way to go out
on your birthday," Chisam said.
The Cardinal, though, excelled
in the middle distance and throw
ing events as expected, led by a
sweep in the 5,000 meters by
Dave Scudamore, Gary Stolz, and
Fred Carter. Stolz and Carter also
went 1-2 in the 3,000 meter
steeplechase.
Dave Popejoy, who has quali
fied for the NCAA champi
onships in the hammer throw,
won the event despite a subpar
day with a throw of 192 feet, 7

inches. Toby Norwood took third
at 189 feet.
"Dave and Toby and Ramon
(Alarcon) put together the best
meet in the hammer throw we've
had against Cal in a long time,"
Chisam said.
Sophomore Matt Karsavar
took second to the Golden Bear's
Ramon Jimenez-Gaona in the
shot put with a hurl of 51 feet, 6
1/4 inches. Jimenez-Gaona is the
Paraguayan national champion in
the discus and easily won that
event with a throw of 198 feet, 4
inches.
