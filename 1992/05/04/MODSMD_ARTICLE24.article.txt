Stanford Track and Field saw their
future at California this weekend. And
they liked it quite a bit.

Track and field

Men: Bears 115, Card 47
Women: Card 83, Bears 62

"I don't think we could have gotten
any more points than we did ... we
maximized our potential," said assistant
coach Scott Chisam after the women's
team won 83-62 and the men lost 115-
47 to the Golden Bears in Stanford's
biggest dual meet of the season.
Jackie Edwards, a 1988 Olympian for
the Bahamas, continued her drive

toward the Olympics as she set a meet
and school record in the triple jump at
43 feet, 1/2 inches. She also won the
long jump with a leap of 21 feet, 1 and
1/4 inches despite only taking one jump,
and took second to Chryste Gaines in
the 100 and 200 meters.
Gaines, a fellow Olympic hopeful,
was clocked at 11.59 in the 100, and
23.42 seconds in the 200. She also ran
the anchor leg on the Cardinal's win
ning 4XIOO relay team.
"Brooks (Johnson, Stanford's head
coach) thought it was going to come
down to the mile relay, but the rest of us
weren't figuring on that," said Gaines.
Two years ago, the women lost to the
Golden Bears on the mile relay, the last
event of the day. This year, though, they
swept the 200 meters to clinch the meet
and then easily cruised to victory.
The win gave the women a 7-6 advan
tage in dual meets with California. "We
get the bragging rights now since we

broke the tie," Gaines said.
The victory was not without a scare,
though. Rhonda Oliver, a key member
of the women's sprinting core, strained
her calf while running in the 400 meters
and had to pull out of the event. Howev
er, the 200 meter sweep and a subse
quent sweep in the 3,000 meters gave
the women more than they needed to
win.
Freshman Andrea Garner set the
tone in the 5,000 meters, the first event
of the day, as she pushed California's
Janet Bowie from the start and took a
strong second place. Bowie, who had to
run in the 1,500 meters only 45 minutes
later, found herself overwhelmed as the
Cardinal swept the event, led by fresh
man Melissa Freeburg.
"The women came through very
strongly in the the distances, starting
with Andrea pushing the lead in the
