### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Saturday afternoon the men's tennis
team made it over the season's last hur
dle in great stride. The Cardinal trav
elled across the Bay to defeat California's
Golden Bears, 7-2, in the last dual meet
of the year.
"This was a big week for us and we
came out very well," said head coach
Dick Gould.
After the Pacific 10 Conference Out
door Championships last weekend, most
teams were finished with dual meet play.
The Card, however, had to play three
more matches before they could take a
breather and prepare for NCAAs.
For their efforts, the Stanford men
finished the season with an impressive
21-3 record. Their 21st win came Satur
day, when four singles players won in

straight sets and all three doubles teams
won their matches in Berkeley.
Sophomores Michael Flanagan and
Chris Cocotos chalked up solid wins
against their second and third-seeded
opponents, 6-4, 6-2, and 6-3, 6-4, respec
tively.
At fifth and sixth singles Robert
Devens and Jason Yee overtook their
competition as well, winning 6-2, 6-2, and
6-4, 6-4, respectively. "Both Jason and
Bobby had a great week," said Gould.
Devens was pleased with his perfor
mance. "I pretty much blew the guy off
the court,"he said. "I really felt like
everything was clicking for me, and that's
pretty good for going into NCAAs."
Stanford's two losses came at first
and fourth singles. Senior Alex O'Brien
slipped to No. 18 Matt Lucena, 1-6, 4-6.
Coach Gould felt this was a result
of playing too many matches in
too few days (O'Brien has played
14 matches in the last nine days).
"0.8. struggled a bit. He's just
really tired both mentally and
physically," Gould said. "I'm not
too concerned, though."
A flu-stricken Vimal Patel
could not quite pull out a win over
Danny Hiddleson, but did manage
to push his opponent to three sets.
The 5-7, 6-4, 2-6 effort sapped all
of the ailing Patel's strength; at
the last minute, Gould pulled the
sophomore out of the doubles line
up, substituting him with junior
Roman Sydorak.
Sydorak and Yee were victori
ous in the third spot, despite hav
ing never played a match togeth
er. "Roman stepped in and did a

great job with Jason," praised
Gould.
Sydorak gave Yee most of the
credit for their impromptu effort.
"Jason's a great doubles player so
it's easy to adjust," he said. "He
does most of the work and sets up
the points so that all you have to
do pretty much is hit the ball."
Both first and second doubles
were pushed to three sets, but
both Cardinal teams came out on
top. Cocotos and O'Brien defeated
Lucena and Tommy Phanco in a
nail-biting 7-6, 4-6, 7-6 thriller
which Gould considered "a good
solid effort by both teams."
At second doubles, Flanagan
and Devens also put in a solid
effort which gave them not onl> a
6-2, 3-6, 7-6 win but a perfect dual
match season. The sophomores
finish the year at 24-0.
"We both started well, but then
I lost my rhythm early on and
then Michael did too," Devens
said. Down match point in the

final set, the duo buckled down
and came back to win.
"We're both pretty competi
tive," Devens observed. "If we're
not playing well we can usually
scrap out a win. That's what's hap
pened this year— one guy can
pump up the other and vice versa."
The Bears, who have been rav
aged by injuries all season, com
peted extremely well on Saturday,

according to Gould. "They've
dealt with adversity all year and
have improved dramatically."
Now, finally, the Cardinal will
slow down their pace for a week
before departing for Athens, Ga.,
their final destination. "We got
through the week healthy," Gould
said. "Now we need to get every
one mentally fresh and physically
fresh for Nationals."

opponents, 6-4, 6-2, and 6-3, 6-4, respec
tively.
At fifth and sixth singles Robert
Devens and Jason Yee overtook their
competition as well, winning 6-2, 6-2, and
6-4, 6-4, respectively. "Both Jason and
Bobby had a great week," said Gould.
Devens was pleased with his perfor
mance. "I pretty much blew the guy off
the court,"he said. "I really felt like
everything was clicking for me, and that's
pretty good for going into NCAAs."
Stanford's two losses came at first
and fourth singles. Senior Alex O'Brien
slipped to No. 18 Matt Lucena, 1-6, 4-6.
Coach Gould felt this was a result
of playing too many matches in
too few days (O'Brien has played
14 matches in the last nine days).
"0.8. struggled a bit. He's just
really tired both mentally and
physically," Gould said. "I'm not
too concerned, though."
A flu-stricken Vimal Patel
could not quite pull out a win over
Danny Hiddleson, but did manage
to push his opponent to three sets.
The 5-7, 6-4, 2-6 effort sapped all
of the ailing Patel's strength; at
the last minute, Gould pulled the
sophomore out of the doubles line
up, substituting him with junior
Roman Sydorak.
Sydorak and Yee were victori
ous in the third spot, despite hav
ing never played a match togeth
er. "Roman stepped in and did a

great job with Jason," praised
Gould.
Sydorak gave Yee most of the
credit for their impromptu effort.
"Jason's a great doubles player so
it's easy to adjust," he said. "He
does most of the work and sets up
the points so that all you have to
do pretty much is hit the ball."
Both first and second doubles
were pushed to three sets, but
both Cardinal teams came out on
top. Cocotos and O'Brien defeated
Lucena and Tommy Phanco in a
nail-biting 7-6, 4-6, 7-6 thriller
which Gould considered "a good
solid effort by both teams."
At second doubles, Flanagan
and Devens also put in a solid
effort which gave them not onl> a
6-2, 3-6, 7-6 win but a perfect dual
match season. The sophomores
finish the year at 24-0.
"We both started well, but then
I lost my rhythm early on and
then Michael did too," Devens
said. Down match point in the

final set, the duo buckled down
and came back to win.
"We're both pretty competi
tive," Devens observed. "If we're
not playing well we can usually
scrap out a win. That's what's hap
pened this year— one guy can
pump up the other and vice versa."
The Bears, who have been rav
aged by injuries all season, com
peted extremely well on Saturday,

according to Gould. "They've
dealt with adversity all year and
have improved dramatically."
Now, finally, the Cardinal will
slow down their pace for a week
before departing for Athens, Ga.,
their final destination. "We got
through the week healthy," Gould
said. "Now we need to get every
one mentally fresh and physically
fresh for Nationals."
