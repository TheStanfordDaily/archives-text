Saturday afternoon the men's tennis
team made it over the season's last hur
dle in great stride. The Cardinal trav
elled across the Bay to defeat California's
Golden Bears, 7-2, in the last dual meet
of the year.
"This was a big week for us and we
came out very well," said head coach
Dick Gould.
After the Pacific 10 Conference Out
door Championships last weekend, most
teams were finished with dual meet play.
The Card, however, had to play three
more matches before they could take a
breather and prepare for NCAAs.
For their efforts, the Stanford men
finished the season with an impressive
21-3 record. Their 21st win came Satur
day, when four singles players won in

straight sets and all three doubles teams
won their matches in Berkeley.
Sophomores Michael Flanagan and
Chris Cocotos chalked up solid wins
against their second and third-seeded
opponents, 6-4, 6-2, and 6-3, 6-4, respec
tively.
At fifth and sixth singles Robert
Devens and Jason Yee overtook their
competition as well, winning 6-2, 6-2, and
6-4, 6-4, respectively. "Both Jason and
Bobby had a great week," said Gould.
Devens was pleased with his perfor
mance. "I pretty much blew the guy off
the court,"he said. "I really felt like
everything was clicking for me, and that's
pretty good for going into NCAAs."
Stanford's two losses came at first
and fourth singles. Senior Alex O'Brien
slipped to No. 18 Matt Lucena, 1-6, 4-6.
