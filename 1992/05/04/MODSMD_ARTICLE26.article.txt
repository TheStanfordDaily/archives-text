# The 						race continues
## Card wins series, now one game out 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
For the Stanford baseball
team, the weekend was offensive
in more ways than one. In a
three-way tie for second place in
the Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division, the Cardinal had to
win at least two of three games in
their series with the Bruins of
UCLA. With plenty of firepower
from the plate, Stanford (30-20
overall) did take two from UCLA
(31-19), 15-6 and 10-5, and would
have swept were it not for a mis
take-filled 10-9 loss on Friday.
"To tell you the truth, [Fri
day's game] was a little embar
rassing," said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess. "We didn't
play well in all facets of the game
— pitching, defense, and hitting."
But you wouldn't have known
that after the first four innings.
The Willie Adams/Pete Janicki
matchup of aces seemed to go all
Stanford's way as the Cardinal
took an 8-0 lead into the fifth
inning, with both Adams and the
Stanford bats seemingly on a roll.
But from there on out, everything
fell apart.
In the next inning and two
thirds, Adams gave up six runs,
one unearned thanks to a Chris
Kemper error. And in the Cardi
nal halves of the innings, the
Stanford offense seemed to rest
on the laurels of a quickly dimin
ishing lead, mustering only one
more run that would have been
two if not for Jeffrey Hammonds
and Steve Solomon base-running
errors.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal car
ried a 9-6 lead into the top of the
ninth. First Matt Marenghi gave
up a lead-off home run. So ace
reliever Aaron Dorlarque was
brought in. Without recording an
out, Dorlarque proceeded to allow
three runs on three hits, and com
mitted a crucial fielding error. An
error also went to shortstop Jed
Hansen, who booted a perfect
inning and game-ending double
play ball.
But it was not over. In the bot
tom of the ninth, Jimmy Noriega,
hitting for an injured Ham
monds, led off with a strikeout
and Dave Cornell followed with a
groundout. But the hot-hitting
Solomon stroked a single as did

Mark Skeels, moving Solomon to
third.
The next hitter, Dusty Allen,
then hit a ball right at the second
baseman. However, the fielder
mishandled the ball which
bounced toward the shortstop.
Solomon came across the plate,
but Allen had slipped going to
first, and got up perhaps too slow
ly, thinking that the grounder
was a game-ender. At any rate,
Allen was thrown out 6-3, negat
ing the Solomon run.
"We had a letdown offensive
ly," said Solomon, "and the pitch
ing allowed 10 runs in five
innings. We were playing pretty
sloppy."
But after a players' meeting
sans coaches, the Cardinal
seemed to come out with a
vengeance on Saturday. In the
second game of the series, Stan
ford scored 15 runs on 17 hits,
including home runs by Solomon
and Allen, who had three long
balls on the weekend.
In the game, every player who
came to the plate had at least one
hit and one RBI. From the
mound, starter Rick Helling had a
solid outing, allowing no hits
through six innings.
The junior righthander ended
up going eight strong innings giv
ing up six runs (five earned) on
nine hits, walking one and strik
ing out 11.
"We played well today," said
Marquess. "We executed, got
good pitching for six or seven
innings, and put in a real good
effort."
Sunday's rubber match was
the most crucial of the weekend,
and the Cardinal stayed focused
and intense the entire game. The
offense did not rest, scoring in
every inning but two for 10 runs
on 16 hits, most of the starters
garnering at least two hits. Stan
ford pitchers Jaime Sepeda and
Andrew Lorraine turned in good
performances, allowing a cumula
tive five runs on nine hits.
"[A game like Friday's] takes
the heart out of you," said Mar
quess. "But the way that this
team came back today and [Satur
day], I'm really proud of them."
Today, the Cardinal travels to
Sacramento to take on the Hor
nets of Sac State at 2:30 p.m. in
non-conference action.
