# What's in a name? Women netters tell all

If you follow Stanford sports you realize many
athletes are known by their nicknames. In football,
Touchdown Tommy Vardell led the Now Boys to the
Aloha Bowl.
Well, members of the Stanford women's tennis
team also carry on this Cardinal tradition.
With Stanford hosting the NCAA Champi
onships May 13-21, some people who haven't seen
much of the squad this year may be going out to
watch.
So that everyone knows what's going on when
the cheering starts, here's the Who's Who of the
1992 Stanford Cardinal.
Toots and Roses
Sounds like a female heavy metal band? Actually,
its sophomore Kristine Kurth and freshman Amy
Chiminello.
Unwittingly, Kurth picked her own nickname.

"I like making up names so I started calling
everyon- l oots. They just came right back with it,"
she said
Kurt l is used to unusual monikers. Last year at
Willian d Mary, her friends were amused by her
distaste iur a particularly rude man she met at
freshmaii orientation. From then on, they called
her Wes.
Chimuiello probably wins the award for most
nicknames. Her middle name is Rose so, early in the
year, her teammates called her Roses.
Some of her monikers that have also lasted are,
as with most of her teammates, a variation on her
name. Chicorelli, Chicky and Chimichanga, just to
name a few.
Willy and Woody
Perhaps a Saturday morning cartoon a la Rescue
Rangers? Not quite.
They are junior co-captain Heather Willens and
her former doubles partner, sophomore Emma
Woodhouse. Willens used to be called H-dub, a

shortened version of her initials, and Woodhouse
has been tagged with the inevitable Woodchuck.
Popeye
Obvious, you say. It's a player who eats a lot of
spinach or has a tatoo of an anchor on her arm.
Wrong. Laxmi Poruri's sobriquet comes from India,
not a buff sailor.
"It's actually Papai," Poruri said. "It sounds the
same as Popeye but it's spelled differently. In my
homeland it's an term of endearment for little
girls."
Most of the other monikers are initials or ver
sions of names. There's KJ, senior Kylie Johnson,
and Milo, junior Mario Carruth. When senior Kelly
Fisher plays, her teammates yell, "Go Fish!" Texas-
El Paso transfer Danielle Rios is called Danny while
injured freshman Kim Shasby is known as Sha2zer.
With the likes of Popeye, Woody and Toots on
Frank Brennan's 1992 team, you might think
Frankie Goes to Hollywood for stage names like these.
