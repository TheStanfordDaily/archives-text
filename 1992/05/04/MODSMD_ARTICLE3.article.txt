# Professors to lead teach-ins on U.S. racism
## 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
About 60 faculty and staff
members decided Friday to
hold a series of teach-ins on
racism and place an advertise
ment in a national newspaper
expressing their "pain and out
rage" at the verdict in the Rod
ney King beating trial.
Political Science professors
Lucius Barker and Terry Karl
called the meeting Friday
morning to show that "most of
us do not share the basic mes
sage sent by the Rodney King
verdict," Karl said.
Barker stressed the impor
tance of speaking out immedi
ately. "If you cannot say
things at these times, it is dif
ficult to say things at any
time," he said.
The text of the advertisement,
which group members said they
will probably put in the New York
Times or the Los Angeles Times,
says the Rodney King beating
"was hardly an isolated incident."

Themes to be dis
cussed in the teach
ins will include
'Racism and the Law'
and 'Inequality in
Modern America.'

Instead, it was symptomatic of
"pervasive racism, the abandon
ment of our cities, the heartless
misallocation of federal and state
funds and the politics of depriva
tion."
The advertisement will allow
Stanford to "take the lead once
again in demonstrating that we
come from a state that is a multi
cultural state," said Karl.
Karl said she hoped the adver
tisement will encourage faculty at
other universities across the
country to follow suit. She said
she will also seek signatures from
representative student groups for
the advertisement.
Dean of Students Michael Jack
son suggested involving students

in any planned
efforts. He said
students will not
accept an atti
tude of "business
as usual" and
there was a need
"to acknowledge
the pain."
The teach-ins
planned at the
mflof 1 n rr Tin 11

meeting win
begin tomorrow and go on until
Friday, history professor George
Fredrickson said in an interview
yesterday.
Themes to be discussed in the
teach-ins will include "Racism
and the Law" and "Inequality in
Modern America." There will be
two "Perspectives on Racism"
sessions, one lead by faculty
members and one lead by mem
bers of the local community, to
compare the local situation with
the events in Los Angeles.
"We are addressing passive as
well as active racism," said
Fredrickson, who contends that
racism is a complex phenomenon
which "may involve simple indif
ference Lor] an unwillingness to
solve problems that are tearing
our society apart."
Community involvement was
called for by several of the group

members on Fri
day. Multicultur
al Educator Greg
Ricks urged the
planners to bring
in local "young
people" to speak
at the teach-ins
so people at
Stanford can bet
ter understand
the realities of

the black community.
Among black youth, "the idea
of getting to your 18th birthday is
a major milestone [andl every day
after that is a real bonus," he
said.
Several people who spoke at
the meeting emphasized the
importance of working toward
"long-term goals."
"It is too easy once the smoke
is cleared ... to forget about it
and become complacent again,"
said History Prof. A 1 Camarillo.

Angeles and witnessed the Watts
riots, said he found it "eerie to see
the same scenes from '65."
Barker and Frederickson also
expressed concern for long-term
progress.
Fredrickson said yesterday,
"This University has done pretty
well over the last couple of years
at least in affirmative action,"
and said it was important "to pre
serve the momentum of this affir
mative action effort" in spite of
budget woes.
Barker urged faculty members
at the meeting to, "in our spheres
of influence, do things we know
should be done."
However, he said faculty must
not lose sight of the specific inci
dent at hand.
He warned the gathering that
"study committees end up being
symbolic."

yesterday.
Themes to be discussed in the
teach-ins will include "Racism
and the Law" and "Inequality in
Modern America." There will be
two "Perspectives on Racism"
sessions, one lead by faculty
members and one lead by mem
bers of the local community, to
compare the local situation with
the events in Los Angeles.
"We are addressing passive as
well as active racism," said
Fredrickson, who contends that
racism is a complex phenomenon
which "may involve simple indif
ference Lor] an unwillingness to
solve problems that are tearing
our society apart."
Community involvement was
called for by several of the group

members on Fri
day. Multicultur
al Educator Greg
Ricks urged the
planners to bring
in local "young
people" to speak
at the teach-ins
so people at
Stanford can bet
ter understand
the realities of

the black community.
Among black youth, "the idea
of getting to your 18th birthday is
a major milestone [andl every day
after that is a real bonus," he

the meeting emphasized the
importance of working toward
"long-term goals."
"It is too easy once the smoke

Angeles and witnessed the Watts
riots, said he found it "eerie to see
the same scenes from '65."
Barker and Frederickson also
expressed concern for long-term
progress.
Fredrickson said yesterday,
"This University has done pretty
well over the last couple of years
at least in affirmative action,"
and said it was important "to pre
serve the momentum of this affir
mative action effort" in spite of
budget woes.
Barker urged faculty members
at the meeting to, "in our spheres
of influence, do things we know
should be done."
However, he said faculty must
not lose sight of the specific inci
dent at hand.
He warned the gathering that
"study committees end up being
symbolic."
