# Ultimatum to Hoover
## Serbian scholar says he'll leave this month if Campbell doesn't 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Hoover Visiting Scholar Srdjan Trifkovic
says he will leave the Institution this month if
former Hoover director W. Glenn Campbell
remains after allegedly making racist remarks
to Trifkovic.
But details of the interaction between
Trifkovic and Campbell at a private dinner
party in February are also being called into
question by emerging witnesses and by
Trifkovic's reluctance to release the tape he
says he made of their conversation.
Trifkovic originally sent a memo to Hoover
Director John Raisian complaining about the
"racist" remarks Campbell allegedly made to
him during the dinner in February.
According to the memo, Campbell said, "It
was too bad if the Croats killed the Jews but they
should have exterminated the Serbs, so that they
would have no trouble with them today."
When questioned by Trifkovic about the
remark, Campbell allegedly responded, "All
Serbs are Nazis."
Raisian has since reprimanded Campbell
and banned him from attending Hoover social
events to which outsiders are invited. Camp
bell also wrote a formal apology to Trifkovic,
which was initially accepted.
"I would have been satisfied with the repri
mand he got, had he not made subsequent

remarks to the press," said
Trifkovic. "It is a matter of
great regret to me that he
remains at the Hoover Insti
tution."
Trifkovic's appointment
with Hoover is scheduled to
end in July, but he said he will
leave earlier if Campbell
remains at Hoover. Trifkovic is
i. l— -i.i ].• r

currently attending a confer
ence at the University of Cambridge in England
and will return Friday.
"I will be returning to Hoover just to see
what the score is. If he is still there I will qui
etly withdraw," said Trifkovic.
Conflicting accounts
Witnesses who were seated at the table
with Trifkovic and Campbell reported ver
sions of the events that differ from both
Trifkovic's and each other's.
Rina Rosenberg, wife of Economics Prof.
Nathan Rosenberg, said she heard Campbell
make an "outrageously provocative" remark
similar to the first one quoted above. Howev
er, she said she did not hear him say, "All
Serbs are Nazis."
Senior Hoover Fellow Rita Ricardo-Camp
bell, Campbell's wife, said she did not hear the
beginning of the conflict but became aware of
it when Trifkovic jumped up and shouted at

Campbell, "You're finished. You're finished.
You're finished."
Rosenberg refuted this account, saying she
did not see Trifkovic stand and shout anything
before the speeches. Everything "settled
down" after the original remarks, she said.
She added that Trifkovic stood up after the
speeches and said, "I hope you enjoyed your
meal, because this will be the last one you have
at Hoover. I'll see to that. I have you on tape."
Hoover Institution Visiting Fellow John
Rust, also present at the dinner, said that
although he left early in the speech he did not
notice any unusual events during the meal.
Trifkovic could not be reached to respond
to these accounts.
Ricardo-Campbell said she believed the
confusion over the conversation may have
been due to bad acoustics and the multiple
conversations taking place at the table.
"I think there is a language difficulty. It's
possible people misunderstood what was being
said," she added.
'He should release the tape'
Trifkovic said he has a tape recording of the
remarks made during the dinner, but has
refused to release copies of it, saying the tape
is not necessary to prove his case.
Rosenberg said Trifkovic should be forced
