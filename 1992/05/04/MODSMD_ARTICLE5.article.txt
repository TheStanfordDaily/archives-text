# Angry visitor removes banner of Arab group
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
A visitor to the Spring Faire
Saturday morning angrily tore
down an OASIS banner reading,
"From L.A. to Palestine, Same
Fight Same Struggle," according
to witnesses.
The Organization of Arab-
American Students in Stanford
posted the banner Friday after
noon to "bring attention to the
Palestine issue" in the wake of
the Rodney King verdict, said
junior Dina Hamdy, the OASIS
member who made the banner.
The man, a visitor from outside
Stanford, said he was offended by
the banner's slogan and called
OASIS "a Nazi organization,"
according to Dayle Dorshow, an
earring vendor from Oakland.
Dorshow said the man first
demanded that she take down the
banner, which was hanging behind
her booth. When she refused, he
tore it down himself, she said.
Hamdy said OASIS members
had decided to make two banners
— one for White Plaza and one for

the Law School — at a meeting
Thursday.
The other sign, which reads,
"Victims of Injustice Must Stand
in Solidarity," still hangs in the
Law School.
Hamdy said she thought it was
an opportune time to highlight
the Palestinian situation, because
of anger over the verdict in the
Rodney King case, which has
been widely viewed as unjust.
"Palestinians in occupation face
beating, torture and trial without
(due) process every day," she said.
This was not the first time that
OASIS signs have been torn down.
Earlier this year, a banner adver
tising an Arabic dinner and culture
night was taken down, Hamdy
said. Two years ago, a banner
painted in the colors of the Pales
tinian flag was also torn down.
OASIS has not had any other
conflicts over their view on the
Palestinian question, Hamdy
said. She added that OASIS is on
good terms with campus Jewish
student organizations and the
two communities have planned
several joint social functions.
Before tearing down the ban
ner this weekend, the Spring
Faire visitor asked Dorshow if she
had posted the banner and asked
her to take it down. She refused
and referred him to the Spring
Faire information booth.
Erica Moore, the Spring Faire
coordinator who was working at
the information booth, said, "He
was just really upset because he
felt the sign was anti-Semitic."
He told Moore that she "need
ed to take it down," but she
responded that she couldn't. "I
told him they have a right to put
up that sign," she said.
"I'm Jewish, and it didn't
bother me," Moore added.
Getting "huffy," he repeated
his demand that she remove the

sign, Moore said. "I told him that
if he wanted to take it down by his
own actions, I wasn't going to
stop him," she said.
"Unfortunately, that was the
fastest way to get rid of him."

'He was an irra
tional person.'

Ed Griggs, a pottery vendor
from Sonoma County, said the
man then "wadded up [the ban
ner] and hid it behind the stones."
Griggs said he was concerned
that the man might break his pot
tery. "He was an irrational per
son," he said.
Moore contacted OASIS mem
bers, who later put the sign back
up despite the holes torn in it.
