# Fac Sen discusses committee's review of fund-raising activity
## Also revokes degree of student who falsified transcript 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate Thursday discussed a new
committee that reviews fund-raising proposals and
revoked the degree of a former student who falsified
part of a transcript.
The meeting, which lasted an hour, had only one
item on the agenda so that it would end before
the full Academic Council meeting.
The senate devoted most of the abbreviated meet
ing to a report from Civil Engineering Chair Haresh
Shah on the recently formed Provost's Advisory
Committee on Development.
The committee, which reviews fund-raising pro
posals of more than $1 million, will screen develop
ment ideas "for academic merit, budgetary impact
and donor benefits," said Shah, the committee chair.
Shah said he and Vice President for Development
John Ford are currently helping schools and admin
istrative units "develop new plans for the next three
years."
The development of new fund-raising priorities is
important to maintain the "great momentum" from
the Centennial Campaign and avoid a "trough" of
donations, Shah said.
In other business, the senate voted to rescind a
degree conferred in June 1990 because the student
had faked parts of a transcript from another school.

Acting Registrar Jack Farrell said he could not go
into the specifics of the case nor could he reveal the
student's name because a federal law denies public
access to student records. But he said the student's
original admission has already been rescinded.

revealed that, like the ASSU Senate, the Faculty
Senate has its problems with elections.
In last month's election for next year's senate and
advisory board, the English Department apparently
did not receive its ballots â€” a fact that was discovered
one month after the ballots were originally distributed.
"It is not right to have a piece of the election done
over or have the whole election redone," Sheehan
said. "We will stick with the result.
"We are doing our best to ensure that the elections
are not marred by such an event again," he added.
Sheehan said upcoming meetings will include a
review of reports from the Stanford Bookstore and
Committee of 15 as well as a recommendation to
change the deadline for students to drop classes.
