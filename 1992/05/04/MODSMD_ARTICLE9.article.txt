# North coast, south state quakes rattle few here
## Many students unworried about possibility of another '89 shaker

Though two major earth
quakes have hit California in the
last two weeks, they haven't
caused too many physical or emo
tional tremors on the Stanford
campus.
"The recent earthquakes have
been psychologically as well as
physically distant," said Alejan
dro Martinez, director of Counsel
ing and Psychological Services.
There is a 67 percent chance of
an earthquake hitting the Bay
Area within the next few years,
but the possibility of an earth
quake striking the Stanford cam
pus are lower than 30 percent,
according to Geophysics Prof.
Robert Kovach.
But he added that "there's

'I'm not terribly afraid of one happening, since
I've been detached from them. I'd like to expe
rience one just for the novelty of it.'

always the chance of an earth
quake happening — one could
happen tomorrow."
Although students are aware
that an earthquake might hit
Stanford at any time, some who
are not from California said they
are fairly apathetic about possibil
ity.
"I guess I have a typically back
ward view about earthquakes,"
said Jordan Wruble, a freshman
from Connecticut. "I'm not terri
bly afraid of one happening, since

I've been detached from them. I'd
like to experience one just for the
novelty of it."
Some students from the Bay
Area felt the same way, but most
said they think they are more pre
pared for earthquakes than other
students.
"It happens here all the time,
so it's just not a big deal to me,"
said Derek Yung, a freshman
from Cupertino.
"Still, I think having been in a
few earthquakes makes you more

intent on preparing for them — I
have a battery-operated radio and
a flashlight on hand as a sort of
'earthquake pack,' " Yung said.
Martinez said that in general,
the critical question for most peo
ple preparing for an earthquake is
asking themselves if they know
what to do in order to survive in
one.
"It's a kind of mental prepara
tion where people are psychologi
cally gaining control over a natu
ral phenomenon," he said.
Leslie Kao, a student from
Sunnyvale, agreed that this sort
of preparation was important
when caught in an earthquake.
"It's still a shock every time it
happens, but I know how I'll react
in the event of another big
quake," she said. "I know that as
long as I don't panic, I'll be fine."
