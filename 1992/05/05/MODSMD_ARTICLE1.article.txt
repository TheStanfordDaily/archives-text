For the Chicano community, Cinco de
Mayo is more than just a day of dances,
food and parties — it is a perpetuation of
Chicano life and culture, according to the
Casa Zapata's first resident fellow.
"There is a continuous thread from
that first Chicano general to you," said
Arturo Pacheco, a speaker at Sunday's
celebration of the holiday.
Cinco de Mayo celebrates the victory of
Mexican troops on May 5,1862 in the bat
tle of Puebla. The French army they
defeated was then considered the most
powerful in the world, according to speak
er Henry Gutierrez, who is doing postdoc
toral work in the History Department.
Gutierrez recalled the words of Gen
eral Ignacio Zaragoza to his troops
before he led them into battle: "Our ene
mies are the first soldiers of the earth,
but you are the first sons of Mexico."

He said the example was still relevant
for "those of us Mexicanos [who want]
justice and independence," remarking
that Zaragoza, born ip Texas, could truly
be called a Chicano.
According to junior Cindy Avitia, the
celebration reflects "on the triumphs of
the past and makes us look forward to
the triumphs of the future."
Avitia, who is the costumist for Ballet
Folkorico de Stanford, a student group that
performs Mexican folklore dances, said it
was "the people, not just the trained troops"
who came out to defend their country.
Like those people, "we are not trained
to do the fighting that we do, but we do it
because we know we need to in order to
hold on to what we have, [primarily] our
culture."
For Avitia, the ancient patterns on
the dance costumes symbolize how she
feels about her culture — "they are

incredibly old but they'll go on
forever because we love them."
Avitia said that she, like other
members of the group, had never
danced Mexican folk dances
before coming to Stanford.
The ballet is an important part
of her life at Stanford because
"the most important thing is that
culture is politics and food and
language, but it's also music and
festivities and dancing," she said.
Many people at the celebration
were wearing black bands to
protest the verdict in the Rodney
King beating trial.
The arm bands and the rea
sons for wearing them "make you
value what you have. We've come
a long way, but we've got a long
way to go," said Avitia.
