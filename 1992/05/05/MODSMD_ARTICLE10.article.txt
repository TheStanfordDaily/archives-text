L.A. death count at 55 as curfew ends
LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Neon-lit streets pulsed with life and
red ribbons of freeway taillights streamed to a smoke-free horizon
as Los Angeles tried to revive its nighttime heartbeat with the
lifting of a riot-imposed curfew.
Rifles poised, vigilant troops patrolled neighborhoods and
guarded markets devastated by three days of rioting that was the
nation's worst in a century.
Mayor Tom Bradley lifted the dusk-to-dawn curfew he had
imposed Thursday, allowing Angelenos to move freely about last
night.
"I feel good about today and I hope that all of us can sense that
feeling that things are coming back into line again," Bradley said.
The rioting triggered by the Rodney King beating trial acquit
tals Wednesday left 55 people dead, 2,383 people injured and
12,111 jailed. Property damages totaled $717 million.
It was the nation's bloodiest unrest since the 1863 Civil War
draft riots in New York City killed about 1,000 people.
The motorized parade of Sunset Boulevard cruisers was back,
snaking past the open-for-business Coconut Teaszer and Rain
bow Club nightclubs, the Laugh Factory, the dominant bill
boards. Spago's was filled with diners, and the Rage club was
jammed with patrons, music blaring.
In contrast, relatively few people were out on the streets of
South Central last night despite lifting of the curfew. In some
areas entire blocks were silent, stores and gas stations were closed
or boarded up, and many street lights were dark.
Intersections remained blocked off, and National Guard troops
manned street points, especially around police stations.
