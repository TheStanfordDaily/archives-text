# Casa Zapata celebrates 20 years of history, struggle
## 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
Cinco de Mayo is doubly meaningful at
Casa Zapata this year — residents are cele
brating both the most important Chicano
holiday and the 20th anniversary of the
Chicano/Latino theme house.
"Twenty years ago, on Cinco de Mayo,
this house was christened Casa Zapata,"
said Arturo Pacheco, Zapata's first resident
fellow. Pacheco, who now teaches at the
University of Texas at El Paso, gave a
speech Sunday as part of this year's cele
bration of the holiday.
He said Stanford recruited Chicanos for
the first time in 1969. But "even well
meaning people really did not realize that
you could not invite Chicanos to Stanford
and leave their [culture] behind," he added.
There was a need for a place where
"sometimes the music would be familiar
(and) sometimes the food would almost be

familiar," he said. "We were strangers com
ing to our own land — Stanford used to be
Rancho del something."
Zapata was previously the John Muir dor
mitory, said Pacheco, who was a Ph.D. can
didate in the School of Education at the time.
Two Chicano students talked to the
RF's at John Muir, who helped them form
Zapata.
Sophomore Gabi Cerrantes, a Zapata
theme associate, said having a connection
with her culture at Stanford is very impor
tant: "That's why I came to Stanford. ... I
can continue with my culture."
But Zapata is more than just the "com
fort zone" for Chicanos it may have started
out as.
It has become "a place where all people
come together and learn from each other,"
Pacheco said.
He said the events of the recent days
showed more than ever the need to "learn the
human dignity that every human deserves."

For Pacheco, the way to achieve this is to
have people live together day to day and expe
rience each other's culture, something which
is achieved best by theme houses like Zapata.

'We were strangers coming
to our own land — Stanford
used to be Rancho del some
thing.'

This is why freshman Sven Halstenberg
chose to live in Zapata.
"I am [no longer! so surprised about
other ways of life," said Sven, who grew up
in Germany but has spent time with a Chi
cano family. "I take it more for granted
that other people do indeed have, and justi

fiably so, different values."
Cerrantes said that for the Mexican-
American, "every time you meet someone
who is not Mexican or Mexican-American
who can understand aspects of (the) cul
ture, it just makes it worthwhile."
Zapata resident fellow Cecilia Burciaga
summed up Zapata's flavor, saying that
like Cinco de Mayo it is "not completely
Mexican nor completely American but forg
ing something unique to us."
Pacheco reminded students of the move
ment of the 19605. "A group of people like
yourselves, except maybe in numbers, said
there was something wrong with higher
education [and started] beating the doors of
the universities to make a place," he said.
The route from the "often reluctant"
realization by universities that there was
something "drastically wrong" with higher
education, to getting them to fully rectify
the situation, was a process of "trial and
error," Pacheco told the crowd.
