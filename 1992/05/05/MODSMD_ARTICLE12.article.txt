# Students help target high schools
## 
### Sandra Lim Staff writer 
Like most college students,
sophomore David Jesse vividly
remembers his days as a high school
senior fresh out of his last SAT, still
nervously clutching his No. 2 pencil
— and listening to presentations
from admissions officers "who all
started to sound the same."
Jesse recalled that during the
application process, he felt he
hadn't really gotten a sense of
what life would be like in college.
With that in mind, he became a
part of the admissions outreach
program through Stanford Alum
ni Network (STAN) and returned
to his high school to give seniors
the student perspective on college
life he felt he had missed out on.
The program was set up under
STAN and the Office of Under
graduate Admissions to help the
University target high schools in
areas that are not well-represent
ed in the student body.
Ten student members of STAN
participated in the pilot program
last September, each visiting their
alma maters to give informal talks
about their lives at Stanford.
The high schools are located in
a wide range of areas, from Min
neapolis to Los Angeles.
"We're not encouraged to be
stand-ins for admissions officers

who are heavy on statistics and
demographics — we offer our per
sonal experiences, why we chose
Stanford, what we do when we're
not in class," said outreach pro
gram director Chris Wand, a junior.
Student outreach is important,
he said, because in contrast to
other well-known universities such
as Harvard or MIT with "much
larger admissions offices," Stan
ford's admissions office has a small
staff of 12 officers who visit rough
ly 500 out of the estimated 25,000
high schools across the country.
The students who volunteered
for the program participated in two
training sessions hosted by the
Admissions Office, where they
received general literature on Stan
ford to take to high schools and
practiced role-playing in answering
some typical admissions questions.
Many of the common questions
asked by seniors are characteristi
cally apprehensive, Wand said.
"A lot of questions go some
thing like, 'What's the formula to
get in?'; 'What was your GPA, or
your SAT scores?' and 'Do people
with relatives have special ins?' "
Wand explained that they
always try to answer questions
within reason, and that if they are
faced with a technical question—
such as financial aid or something
else they don't know about —
they are encouraged to direct it

back to the Admissions Office.
"Obviously, we're not privy to
everything about the Admissions
Office," Wand said.
Junior Laura Thomas, an out
reach participant, said she believes
the informal interaction with the
high school students was the most
valuable part of the program.
"I went to a big public school in
Phoenix, and I remember there was
no chance for admissions people to
really give any individual attention
to students — it was always more of
a big presentation instead of a dia
logue," Thomas said.
Jesse found that the question
and-answer format of his presen
tation elicited more candid ques
tions from students.
"I found that they were really
honest with me," he said. "They
asked me about how the work load
was compared to high school, if it
was really stressful and competitive,
what the the social life was like."
Through working with the out
reach program, Jesse said he also
felt he had many of his former
misconceptions about the admis
sions proems cleareu up.
He recalled that he once shared
the high school students' assump
tion that they could measure their
chances of "getting in" by compar
ing themselves to certain standards.
"Just going through the [train
ing session], I didn't think it worked

that way.... I found that for each
[applicant], the case is so individual
— there is no cut-and-dry process to
admissions," Jesse said.
The program may have to grow
beyond the range of STAN to
reach more distant areas, he said.

Vince Cuseo, the associate
director of undergraduate admis
sions said that at this point, the
most important objective of the
program seems to be not so much
in reaching "exotic" areas to
recruit students, but rather to

lure in those students who never
thought of going to a big college
away from home.
"It's really about diminishing
the mystery of college, and stu
dents' anxieties about college,"
Cuseo said.

Junior Chris Wand and sophomore David Jesse, members of the Stanford Alumni Network, visited their
high schools this fall to give students a perspective on the University that admissions officers can't offer.
