## In the days after 
### 
The response of many
political leaders to the
King verdict is dubious

NOW THAT THE apocalyp
tic rivers of blood have
flowed their wild and
untrammelled course through the
erstwhile City of Angels, it is time
to contemplate the long path out of
the debris of this conflagration.
If it takes no more than a moment
for the fearsome sirens of violent
rebellion to unleash their potent vir
ulence, the process of healing and
reconstruction will take forever to
make substantial changes. Ironical
ly, it was only a short week before
the violence that Lucky's supermar
ket decided to move back into the
Watts area after the 1965 riots.
It is imperative for President
Bush to take swift and stern action
on the Rodney King case. The fed
eral investigation of the case must
be expedited, and given the priori
ty it deserves.
As presidential candidate Ross
Perot remarked on NBC, regard
ing the urgency of the trial:
"Immediately, immediately —
because that sends people the sig
nal that justice still lives."
That George Bush reacted to
the crisis merely in his capacity as
commander-in-chief of the armed
forces, and not as moral leader of
his people, is appalling.
If only he were willing to respond
to the problems of chronic under
employment and community under
development with the same alacrity
and zest that he displayed in deploy
ing the military to Los Angeles, we
might have been spared much of the
anguish of the past few days.
Bush spent barely a minute of
his 13-minute address to the
nation addressing the problems
that led to the violence. Instead, he
rode the facile Republican hobby
horse of law-and-order.
At the city level, the urban
reconstruction of Los Angeles is

off to an ambivalent start with
Mayor Tom Bradley's appoint
ment of Peter Ueberroth — who
successfully organized the 1984
Olympic Games at Los Angeles —
to head the rebuilding efforts.
The link between Ueberroth's
skills at managing the first com
mercially successful Olympic
Games and the restoration of faith
among minority communities in
the very political and legal super
structures of contemporary Amer
ica seems elusive.
Many people in the minority
communities, especially those with
small businesses and those living
in damaged areas, have under
standably expressed their skepti
cism about the appointment.
Though Ueberroth's business
acumen has never been doubted, it
remains to be seen if he under
stands the troubled relationship
between community, finance and
minority life in Los Angeles.
The Los Angeles City adminis
tration under Bradley has been
reluctant to provide businesses
with either incentives or directives
to enter low-income neighborhoods
to create jobs. There has been a
cozy relationship between City
Hall and Corporate L.A. that has
worked to the economic detriment
of the residents of South Central.
There must be explicit govern
ment backing of the loans that banks
lend to minority business, to counter
the abject reluctance of banks to ven
ture into the world of the inner cities.
In a recent editorial, The Wall
Street Journal demanded that the
riots should not be an excuse to
resuscitate "failed programs."
On the contrary, the efforts to pro
mote economic self-reliance among
poor blacks and other underprivi
leged groups must go hand-in-hand
with stronger welfare measures that
both the Wilson and Bush adminis
trations have been so eager to slash.
Now that the sound and the
fury of the violence has abated, we
can only wait and see — with a
skepticism learned from the past
— what the political will of Ameri
ca's leaders is capable of achieving.
