Student expresses dismay at American system of justice

I'VE ALWAYS LOVED my country.
Despite all the cynical gripes one can
have with a political system, a civic
system, a social system, I've always had
basic confidence that police arrest crimi
nals, doctors cure illness and judges
acquit the innocent and convict the
guilty.
Slavery, back alley abortions, impris
onment without due cause, cruel and
unusual punishment, the invisible but
ever-present eye of the State — in my
mind, all these occurred in history
books, or in far-off lands where the sun
was too ashamed to show its face — but
not in my back yard.
I have read about gulags in Russia,
about the dark cells that are the graves
of the disappeared in Guatemala and El
Salvador, about the raped Irish teenager

forbidden by the state even to leave the
country to have an abortion, about the
women who are sold into prostitution by
their fathers and husbands in Southeast
Asia.
Hut I have always maintained, with
extreme relief and not without pride,
that at least in the United States, the
lawmakers and enforcers uphold the
inalienable human rights of their citi
zens.
It *,hus becomes difficult to express
the intense sadness I felt the day when I
became ashamed to be an American. The
culmination of the past two weeks has
left me feeling stifled, suffocating in a
political climate that is violently under
mining the personal liberties of individu
als at an alarming rate.
With the execution of Robert Alton

Harris, the hearing of a court case crip
pling, if not paralyzing a woman's right
to an abortion and the acquittal of the
police officer's who were seen on
national television brutally beating
Rodney King, the State has, in a span
of two weeks, granted itself immense
power.
The State has given itself the power
to determine if a human being deserves
to live, has begun to appropriate the
right to determine and qualify the most
personal decisions involved in a woman's
life and has placed in the hands of law
enforcers an individual's rights of
habeas corpus and innocence before con
viction.
In our society, we are trapped in a
whirlpool of violence that we continue to
perpetuate. A man commits a murder

and we clamor for his blood, saying jus
tice will not be done until his life, in
turn, has been wrested from his body.
A court rules that police have the
right to brutally force a suspect to com
ply if he will not do so willingly, and we
tear each other to shreds in the streets,
burning each other's homes and busi
nesses and shooting each other in our
desperation.
In this election year, ask yourselves
whether you can tolerate further
entrenchment of stacked courts, police
impunity and a legal code reminiscent of
Hammurabi. I urge you all to question
the logic that violence and repression
will act as a deterrent for violence and
repression.
