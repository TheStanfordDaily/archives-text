# Issues raised by King case concern everyone
## 
### 
We are appalled and deeply disturbed
by the events of the past week and are
writing to express our disappointment
with the reactions of fellow students and
much of the Stanford community.
Upon hearing the verdict of the
King trial our first reaction was one of
shock and anger; anger at the injustice
of the acquittal and shock as we under
stood how deeply the roots of racism
and prejudice have grown into the soil
of America.
As the week progressed, we came to
realize how police brutality, racial bias
and the political policies which ignore
the deprived members of our society
have formed a deep chasm of serious
alienation that is splitting America more
severely than any earthquake could ever
do.
What has saddened and sickened us
most is the justifications offered by

many fellow students to escape the feel
ings of guilt or personal responsibility
for institutionalized racism and bigotry.
There has been little action taken by
the white leaders of our community,
state or nation strongly condemning
discrimination and violations of human
rights.
While easy to dismiss as a "black
issue," we, the student community,
must realize that the problems and
issues brought so forcefully to light by
the King verdict and subsequent
expressions of anger have strong
repercussions for all members of our
society.
We must open the lines of communi
cation and encourage an exchange of
opinions and feelings in our dorms and
classrooms. We cannot allow ourselves
to become apolitical intellectuals â€” we
can no longer be mute in the shame of
racism.
