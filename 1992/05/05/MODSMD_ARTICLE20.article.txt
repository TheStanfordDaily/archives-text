## Where do we go from here 
### 
THREE YEARS AGO when I was a
freshman, my friends came rush
ing back to the dorm.
"They're taking over President
Kennedy's office — Let's go!"
Clueless but trusting, I grabbed my
stuff and ran out, sure that if they were
going, I should too. As we ran, I asked,
"Are they supposed to be there?"
I always look back on that and laugh. It
reminds me how naive I was and how far
I've come since then. Civil disobedience? I
had never even questioned the system.
When news of Rodney King's case first
came out last week, I didn't know what was
going on. I hadn't been watching TV, and
I'd never even seen the video of the beating.
When I finally sat down and read the
articles in the newspaper, I began to
understand.
The article explaining the defense
argument introduced some doubts in my
mind at first. Was there some possible
way that the jury could be right? What
did they know that we didn't?
No, I decided. Why would four armed
officers feel threatened enough by one man
to resort to violently beating him? Yes, I
can believe that these were regular police
procedures and tactics. Isn't that the point?
But what makes it okay for the police
to use such excessive force? When I went
to the community meeting Thursday
night, one woman had done some
research. She pointed out that under the

current system, maybe the jury was
right. Maybe our laws and policies allow
this to happen.
Police officers only require "probable
cause" in order to stop someone, search
them, maybe beat them because they
think the suspect is resisting. At Friday's
rally and march, there were people —
Stanford people — who talked about their
own experiences with police harassment.
A Stanford dean, an African-American
man, is stopped regularly by the police
asking him where he's going. Only a few
weeks ago, four Chicano students were
suddenly surrounded at an ATM in Palo
Alto by police officers, questioned and
had their car searched. Humiliated. For
what? And if they were white students,
would the police have even stopped?
Some people say that race is not an
issue. In some sense that is true, for cer
tainly minorities are not the only ones
who face police brutality. But I would
guess that the majority of victims are
indeed ethnic minorities — especially
immigrants and those who are poor —
who some police officers feel they can
intimidate and get away with it.
After all, how many people are able to
bring charges against an officer and win?
Most cases are internally investigated.
I think about all those cop movies we
see. How many times have we cheered
Mel Gibson when he finally caught the
bad guy and threw him up against the car

or hit him? Until now, I never gave it a
second thought, never wondered whether
there was unnecessary roughness. You
might say that it's okay because we know
who's the bad guy. But even then, does
that really make it okay?
How much do media images both in
the news and in films afTect us? What
stereotypes do we have? The defense
lawyer asked the jury to put themselves
in the shoes of the police officers, and the
jury, mostly white, said, "Not guilty."
As I write this, it is only Sunday, and
already I am afraid of slipping back into
purely academic concerns, into complacen
cy. But I fight it. There is work to be done.
The problems revealed by Rodney
King's case and the ensuing riots are
many. But the committees are there,
from letter-writing to educating high
school students to helping East Palo Alto
organizers. The people are there, from all
the different Stanford communities,
working together for common and inter
related goals.
No, I'm not giving up yet.

Jane wants you to stop by Ujamaa if you
are interested in more details about how
to get involved.
