# IN THE VERDICT'S AFTERMATH: STANFORD RESPONDS
## The 						War Within LAPD failed in its basic duties 
### Joseph D. McNamara 
THE CLOUD OF SMOKE over the city of Los
Angeles casts a pall on the entire nation. As
someone who spent a career in police work, I was
sickened watching the videotaped beating of
Rodney King by four Los Angeles policemen as
other officers stood and watched.
If that was not unnecessary force by the police
one wonders what is unnecessary force?
The Simi Valley jury acquittal of the four police
officers is a heartbreaking message to minorities in
this country and should frighten everyone. It raises
the question of who controls the police.
Nor should we think such jury verdicts are only
from the strange Southland. Similar judgements
have occurred in the Bay Area and elsewhere in the
nation by juries and civil service commissions.
The defense that the officers feared for their
lives is preposterous. Cops realize that when they
accept the badge they accept certain risks.
If you fear one man lying prone on the ground
may kill you while 20 other officers are present,
then you should not be in police work.
The implicit message seems to be that white
society should not question too closely what the
police do to protect them. This mentality is
encouraged by our politicians calling for "wars on
crime and wars on drugs."
After all, the Simi Valley jurors from their 98
percent white enclave seemed to be saying that we
ought not to be too "picky" about the "soldiers"
who protect us.
Unfortunately, the vicious rioters may be
obscuring more than the LAX airspace. It is
necessary to stop the assaults, arson and looting
that benefit no one.
But our condemnation of the rioters should not
let us forget that ignoring the inner city problems
and inequities of minorities in this country provides
a fertile environment for the despair required for
such destruction.
Nor should we lose sight of the fact that the
Christopher Commission investigation of the Los
Angeles Police Department documented a racist
police culture with years of disrespect for
minorities, an internal code of silence and a poor
record of investigating citizen complaints.
Added to that were Chief Daryl Gates' offensive
statements about minorities and his belligerent
remark that casual drug users should be taken out
and shot.
The chiefs and department's lack of credibility
and bad reputation, in my opinion, rendered it
impotent in the early hours of the disorder.
The police stayed out of areas and took no action
while innocent motorists were assaulted and killed
by gangsters. The department failed in its
fundamental duty to protect human life and
preserve order.
Firm, skilled police action at the start of the riot
would have prevented injuries and saved lives. The
arrest of a relatively few criminals might well have
prevented others from being incited to riot.
There are many lessons to be learned from this
continuing tragedy, and corrective action needs to
be supported by all of us regardless of our race and
where we live. O
