# Time for action is right now

RODNEY KING IS not alone. As many of us were
worrying about the next problem set, midterm
or party, America was busy dealing with realities
that challenge the self-deception and comfortable
vanity of America in the post-civil rights era —
namely, the continued lack of respect for all
members of the human family.
But the Rodney King verdict was not just
another reminder of the racism that still exists. Nor

Coalition for Justice.

was it just another example of the widening gap
between the haves and the have-nots.
It was a call to action.
Those who would have us focus on the aftermath of
the verdict believe that they can blind us to the real
issue — respect. They would have us believe that what
happened to Rodney King was an isolated incident, or
an LA. phenomenon, but certainly not part of a
pattern of disrespecting people of color that pervades
every institution in this country. Including Stanford.
We, as Black students, know what it feels like to
be disrespected — when we see virtually no Black
faculty or administrators, when our CIV classes
teach us nothing about our contributions to this
world, when the Black Student Union barely passes
special fee requests that determine whether it
survives at this school for another year, when we
hear our new university president question the

need-blind admissions and finan
cial aid support that makes it pos
sible for many of us to be here at
ail.
The four officers who almost
killed Rodney King did not go to
Stanford or any place like it; but
their bosses — the politicans, the
policy-makers, and the members
of the media — did.
They are the people who per
petuate the stereotypes and igno
rance. They are the people who
make a King juror believe that
one "big, black man" could con
trol more than 20 police officers

armed with clubs, tazers, and
guns.
Or that a BSU, an Ujamaa, and
an Afro-Am Department are not
necessary here, that the struggle
of Malcolm and Martin, James
Meredith and Stokely Carmichael,
is over.
But the jury said, "Not guilty,"
which translates to "You have no
rights; expect no justice."
Yes, the very attitudes that
sanctioned slavery in a free soci
ety continue to plague America;
Rodney King just happened to be
on videotape.
On May 1, the Stanford com
munity came together to express
its outrage at the blatant violation
of civil and human rights that the
King verdict represented. The

multiracial crowd lent truth to
the claim of multiculturalism that
Stanford makes.
The rallies and speeches were
fine in that they allowed us to
vent our legitimate frustration
and outrage, but the truly hard
work lies ahead as we grapple
with the causes of the riots, the
violence behind the violence.
Now is the time for action,
while the feelings are strongest.
We must harness this energy lest
it dissipate into comfortable com
placency; before the protests fade,
a commitment must be made to
attacking the policies and secret
agendas that gave rise to the out
pouring of rage and hopelessness
so evident in the riots of Los
Angeles.

We must recognize that the
vast inequalities in education,
housing, and economic opportuni
ty are fortified by the institutions
that supposedly operate on behalf
of all the people of America.
Racial harmony will never be
anything more than words in a
forgotten law book if we do not
take a stand against those who
oppose it — by working in the
neglected communities, educating
ourselves, appreciating cultural
difference, and using our vote to
take back the institutions of gov
ernment that fail to truly repre
sent our interests.
I hope that you will join us in
our effort. Together, we have the
power to ensure that there are no
more Rodney Kings. □
