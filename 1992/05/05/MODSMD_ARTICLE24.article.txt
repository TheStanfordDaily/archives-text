# Another defining opportunity
## 
### Lucius J. Barker 
RODNEY KING AND Los Angeles have given us
yet another opportunity to define ourselves as a
people and as a nation. But what we have witnessed
in the past few days shows that we have not learned
nor profited much from history.
The situation reflects much about our past. It
raises the specter of Chief Justice Roger Taney's
comments in the infamous 1857 Supreme Court
decision in Dred Scott where the Chief Justice said
that blacks "have no rights which the white man is
bound to respect."
Today the King verdict raises specters of the
early dark days of the Civil Rights Movement in the
1950s and 1960s when the full fury of law and
practice in the South were used to brutally repress
(even kill) blacks and their supporters. It also raises
the specter of what happened during the urban
disorders of the 19605.
In broader perspective, these historical periods
suggest that: 1) progress in dealing with racial
problems has only come in the wake of crisis
situations; and 2) that once the crisis has subsided,
promising hopes were dashed by reversion to
indifferent/hostile climates that jeopardize the
rights and interests of African-Americans.
The King verdict thus adds to an increasingly
hostile climate that evidences how once promising
civil rights gains of the 1950s and 1960s are
obviously now being eroded with more speed than
deliberation.

Lucius J. Barker is a professor of political science
and co-author of "African-Americans and the
Political System," a forthcoming book from
Prentice-J {all.

It is a climate that has come almost full circle,
producing a Supreme Court that is generally
unsympathetic to civil rights and liberties. It is a
climate where use of the "racial card" is
commonplace in both public and private arenas
such as in elections and in the workplace.
It is a climate that reflects in too many ways that
rights and interests of blacks and similar groups are
not being fairly represented or protected by either of
the two major parties; nor by Congress, the
president, the justice system nor any other
governing institutions.
It is a climate that has become all too accepting,
comforting and even supportive of those who
engage in rhetoric and actions that foster racial
discord and division.
Overall, it is a climate of increasing hopelessness
and despair where many blacks — irrespective of
class — are subject to daily inequities, indignities
and humiliations that are less visible but no less
hurtful and damaging to their individual worth and
well-being. Indeed, there are many "Rodney Kings"
in America today.
It is not enough for leaders, especially the
president, to sit by and react to such situations;
they must show pro-active and extraordinary
political as well as moral leadership in order to
make an extraordinary form of government
(democracy) work.
The stakes are extremely high. What we do will
not only affect our own future, but could well affect
our standing and influence in an international
arena where old and newly emerging states are
seeking patterns and guidance for their own futures
in democratic governance.
