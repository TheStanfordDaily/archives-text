# Can we regain humanity lost?

### Al Camarillo 
THE ACQUITTAL OF the four L.A. police
officers involved in the Rodney King case and
the aftermath of violence and destruction in Los
Angeles laid bare the complex and festering cancer
of racial inequality in American society.
The decision of the jury — albeit as shocking as it
was to most Americans who had watched in disbelief
the horrid videotaped evidence — should not have
produced by itself the explosive reactions, chaos and
disorder that gripped Los Angeles for several days.
The utter failure of the judicial process in this
case surely had the effect of lighting the fuse, but
the powder keg of discontent has been ready to
explode in poor, inner city, minority communities
for many years. We cannot begin to understand
what occurred in Los Angeles without first
understanding the extent to which enormous
sectors of our urban populations are frustrated,
dissatisfied and disaffected members of society.
We are all socialized early in our lives to believe
that justice, equality and freedom are keystones of
American democracy; indeed, we all want to believe
in these high ideals.
Though history informs us that these tenets of
democracy have consistently been trampled on (far
more so for some Americans than others), we as a
people and a nation cling tenaciously to the aspirations
these tenets engender, justice before the law, equality
of opportunity for all and individual freedom.
The struggles during the civil rights era and
benchmark public policies enacted especially during
the 1960s confirmed for millions of Americans a
renewed commitment in pursuit of these ideals. To
be sure, progress has been achieved among certain
disadvantaged sectors of the U.S. since the '60s in
ways we can tangibly measure.
But other Americans — the chronically poor and
homeless, inner city minority populations, single
female heads of households and an alarming
percentage of our children — confront a different
reality in late 20th century America.
The effects of Reagan-era policies with regard to
the poor, the continuing neglect during the 1980s of
problems reaching crisis proportions in our inner
cities, and an about-face turn from issues of equality
and opportunity for disadvantaged Americans has
resulted in a reality in which millions of citizens
have become marginalized members of society.
Far too great a number of urban dwellers have
grown skeptical about their status in society and
are discouraged about their future and the future of
their children.
Yet, remarkably, somehow, most poor and
minority people, who face increasing employment and
growing despair during the current recession, still
foster a belief in the United States and its institutions.
That belief, however tenuous, can be shattered
when injustices as bald as the Rodney King beating
and subsequent jury verdict undermine any
