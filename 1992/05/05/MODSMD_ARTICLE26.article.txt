# This is the new face of racism

### George M. Fredrickson 
Al Camarillo is a professor of history who is
teaching "Race and Ethnicity in the American
Experience" this quarter.

AS SOMEONE WHO HAS spent 25 years studying
the history of black-white relations in the United
States, I should have anticipated the acquittal of the
policemen whose beating of Rodney King was
captured on videotape. But I was in fact surprised and
shocked at the verdict, having convinced myself that
such flagrant denials of legal equality for African-
Americans had ended in the late '60s and early '70s.
Before that time it had been virtually impossible
to convict whites for violence against blacks in the
southern states, but judicial historians have shown
that a major change took place around 1970 and that
equal justice was at least a possibility thereafter.

George M. Fredrickson is a professor of history. He
is organizing a series of teach-ins this week that
will address racism in the United States.
