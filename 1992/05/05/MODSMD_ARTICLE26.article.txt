AS SOMEONE WHO HAS spent 25 years studying
the history of black-white relations in the United
States, I should have anticipated the acquittal of the
policemen whose beating of Rodney King was
captured on videotape. But I was in fact surprised and
shocked at the verdict, having convinced myself that
such flagrant denials of legal equality for African-
Americans had ended in the late '60s and early '70s.
Before that time it had been virtually impossible
to convict whites for violence against blacks in the
southern states, but judicial historians have shown
that a major change took place around 1970 and that
equal justice was at least a possibility thereafter.

George M. Fredrickson is a professor of history. He
is organizing a series of teach-ins this week that
will address racism in the United States.

How can we explain the fact
that a Ventura County, California
jury ignored the evidence of their
own eyes, and everyone else's, to
find the policemen innocent of
using excessive force against Rod
ney King?
The obvious answer is that the
death of racism has been greatly
exaggerated. But how do we
square that realization with pub
lic opinion polls and other evi
dence showing that the classic
racist belief in innate black inferi
ority has declined in the last 40
years from a conviction strongly
held by the majority of whites to
the assertion of a bigoted minori
ty?
The policemen who referred to
African-Americans as "gorillas"
and behaved as if Rodney King
was a dangerous beast can be
viewed as members of the retro
grade racist minority, but what
about the 12 jurors, who were in
fact carefully screened by the
prosecution for signs of racial
prejudice?
I do not, of course, have any
way of knowing for certain what
was in their minds, but I can
make an informed guess. They
had chosen to live in an exurban
middle-class community with few
African-American residents. Pre
sumably they enjoy good relations
with their local police and are
fearful of the spread of the crime

and disorder that they associate
with the big city to their own
quiet neighborhoods.
For them, as for most white
Americans, crime is a color-coded
problem; it is unemployed black
males who are the object of fear,
and Rodney King was an unem
ployed black male with a criminal
record. If the police had to act
with great violence to control
him, the jury was willing to accept
such action as the price for their
own safety and peace of mind.
This is the new face of racism.
It stereotypes criminals as black,
but not necessarily blacks as
criminals — for it is very likely
that these jurors recognize that
there are many law-abiding,
"respectable" African-Americans.
The heart of the matter is the
probably belief of these decent cit
izens that they are in no way
responsible for the inner city con
ditions that spawn crime, disor
der, and police brutality.
Because they lack empathy
with poor urban blacks, viewing
them as alien outsiders rather
than fellow citizens, they feel
under no obligation to pay the
taxes or support the public poli
cies required to deal with the
poverty and desperation of the
inner cities.
What makes them racist is that
they do not feel the same respon
sibility for the abominable condi
tions under which many African-
Americans are forced to live that
they would be likely to feel if the
victims were people whom they
regarded as akin to themselves. (J
