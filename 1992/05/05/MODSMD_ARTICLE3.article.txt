# New committee takes hold of budget reins
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
First there was the CCBSP.
Then came the SCESS. Hold your
breath — here comes the PCBI.
For those not intimately famil
iar with the P's and Q's of Stan
ford's $43 million deficit-reduc
tion process, that stands for the
Cabinet Committee on Budget
and Strategic Planning, the Fac
ulty Senate Committee on Educa
tion and Scholarship at Stanford
and the Provost's Committee on
Budget Implementation.
Quite a mouthful.
The recently appointed provos
tial committee has been charged •

with overseeing the budget cuts
slated to be put in place over the
next two years.
The committee will function as
an extension of the executive com
mittee of the cabinet budget group,
said Senior Assoc. Dean of Engi
neering Charles Kruger, committee
chair. "We are responsible for mak
ing sure things work out right."
While the new committee is
not charged with making addi
tional budget cuts, it will oversee
implementation of several rough
deficit-reduction ideas — such as
the tax on restricted funds to
cover the indirect costs associated
with a donation.
"We have no intention of alter
ing the plans approved by the
Board of Trustees" in April, said
Kruger, who served as deputy chair
of the cabinet budget committee.
"Our charter is to implement the
$43 million deficit-reduction plan."
The new committee will also
"check the details" and "see if
there are any side effects that peo
ple did not predict," Kruger said.
"I am particularly concerned
about the assessment of fees on
students, and we will want to
keep informed about what differ
ent units propose," Kruger said.
Other areas likely to be closely
watched include the increases in
graduate student tuition in addi
tion to the 9.5 percent general

tuition hike and how the arts
have been impacted.
The new committee will likely
conduct periodic evaluations of
how budget cuts are affecting var
ious parts of the the University
next year, but Kruger said they
would be on a "less formal, less
global basis" that those conducted
by the cabinet budget committee.
But the composition of the new
committee — which initially
lacked any student representation
— has already upset several stu
dents involved in the process.
The committee met twice before
deciding to add one graduate and
one undergraduate student through
the ASSU Nominations Committee
process. Those students will likely
be appointed later this month.
"It concerns me that students
were not involved from the very
beginning of the process," said
Council of Presidents member Beth
Morgan. "I am very glad that they

will be included as soon as possible."

as an example of why next year's
COP, which has promised to abol
ish the office, is threatening stu
dent representation.

"The University is famous for
having clandestine committees
that come out with shocking
details. Without a Council of Pres
idents, we run the risk of having
more of this, especially with a new
administration," Morgan said.
But Kruger suggested the lack
of immediate student representa

tion was a simple oversight. "It
came up at our last meeting and
we came to an agreement that the
ASSU should nominate people for
the committee," he said.
The committee currently con
tains 11 faculty members and
administrators, many of whom
have been heavily involved in the
budget process this year.
In February, the cabinet com
mittee was divided into task forces
to study sue crosscutting themes —
undergraduate and graduate edu
cation, diversity, research, the arts
and academic support services.
With the shift in emphasis
from central planning body to
overseer of the plans, the new
committee will likely meet less
frequently than the cabinet bud
get committee, which often met
three times a week.
"It all depends on how things
work out," Kruger said. "They
have gone pretty smoothly so far."
