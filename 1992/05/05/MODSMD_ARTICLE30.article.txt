## Women golfers take second at home Wooding finishes second individually as Cardinal ties course record 
### Tish Williams Staff writer 
The California Intercollegiate women's
golf tournament was held on the Stanford
Golf Course Sunday and Monday, under
clear blue skies and all-around perfect condi
tions.
But the weather and greens weren't the
only top-notch features of the tourney, as
the top-ranked field lit the course on fire,
shattering records during the two days of
competition.

Stanford takes second at the
California Intercollegiate

San Jose State bolted out of the blocks in
the first round of play, breaking the
course's 18-hole women's team record,
with 284 strokes, four under the previous
record.
Individual champion Tracy Hanson, also
broke the 54-hole individual record set in
1984 by Stanford's Kathleen McCarthy,
leading the Spartans to an impressive over
all victory. San Jose State's 870-stroke
tournament total annihilated the 884
stroke course record set by UCLA last year.
The Cardinal finished second to the
Spartans, in a highly respectable perfor
mance featuring many low rounds by Stan
ford individuals.
The Cardinal's 884 stroke team total
would have tied the old UCLA record for
three rounds, if not for San Jose State.
Stanford beat the Spartans in the second
and third rounds, but could not surpass the
huge lead San Jose mustered in their first
outing.
Audrey Wooding once again led the Car
dinal squad, finishing second individually

with a three-round performance of 72, 74,
and 74 strokes, maintaining the consisten
cy Stanford needs for the upcoming NCAA
Championships.
"I've been getting a lot of practice this
Spring," said Wooding, a member of the
Pacific 10 Conference first-team. "I've been
practicing my putting. It's also nice to play
at home, knowing the course.
"I definitely think my attitude is awe
some. Having a couple of good tournaments
really helped out."
Adele Moore finished up tied for seventh
place, shooting a 72, 73 and 79 during the
competition. Moore put in a solid perfor
mance after a few rocky tournaments this
Spring. Moore is now in good position in
the running for high individual spots at the
NCAA Championships.
Cardinal golfers Melinda Daniels and
Amy Lawrence were right behind Moore,
finishing ninth and 10th, respectively.
Both golfers finished up with outstanding
rounds, with Daniels shooting a personal
best of 70 and Lawrence shooting 71.
"I'm glad I shot my best score on my
home course before NCAAs," Daniels said.
"This is definitely good timing for my game
to come together."
Martha Richards was Stanford's fifth
player, having a weaker finish than usual
after a very solid spring season.
Richards is still in contention for a top
ten finish at NCAAs, to be held the last
week of May on the Arizona State course.
Richards had a strong performance on that
course two weeks ago at the Pac-10 Cham
pionships.
Stephanie Davis and Jamille Jose com
peted individually, both shooting low
scores. Davis came in 11th, right behind
her teammates, proving the great depth of
the Cardinal squad.
"We definitely have a chance to win
NCAAs, and the talent to do it," said Pac
-10 Second Team member Moore. "We have
seven good players ... we don't even know

who we're taking."
"I think people have been starting to
play well," Wooding said. "Everyone has
continued to have a good attitude."
Stanford's overall performance puts
them in good shape for NCAAs, with the
Cardinal squad turning in its most consis
tent tournament this spring. This is their
last tourney before the championships in
three weeks.

'Except for that first
round, we showed that we
could play with San
Jose. . . . We are a shot-mak
ing team and so is San Jose
State, so it'll come down to
who's making the shots.'
— Audrey Wooding

"It looks like we've got some players who
found that they could get low scores," said
women's coach Tim Baldwin.
"That's what it's going to take for us
to be competitive with Arizona, San Jose
State, and Georgia. Audrey and Adele just
have to fire numbers like that at
NCAAs."
Wooding echoed her coach's sentiments.
"I am really confident about myself indi
vidually and about the team," she said.
"This tournament was great for us.
"Except for that first round, we showed
that we could play with San Jose. . . . We
are a shot-making team and so is San Jose
State, so it'll come down to who's making
the shots."

the running for high individual spots at the
NCAA Championships.
Cardinal golfers Melinda Daniels and
Amy Lawrence were right behind Moore,
finishing ninth and 10th, respectively.
Both golfers finished up with outstanding
rounds, with Daniels shooting a personal
best of 70 and Lawrence shooting 71.
"I'm glad I shot my best score on my
home course before NCAAs," Daniels said.
"This is definitely good timing for my game
to come together."
Martha Richards was Stanford's fifth
player, having a weaker finish than usual
after a very solid spring season.
Richards is still in contention for a top
ten finish at NCAAs, to be held the last
week of May on the Arizona State course.
Richards had a strong performance on that
course two weeks ago at the Pac-10 Cham
pionships.
Stephanie Davis and Jamille Jose com
peted individually, both shooting low
scores. Davis came in 11th, right behind
her teammates, proving the great depth of
the Cardinal squad.
"We definitely have a chance to win
NCAAs, and the talent to do it," said Pac
-10 Second Team member Moore. "We have
seven good players ... we don't even know

who we're taking."
"I think people have been starting to
play well," Wooding said. "Everyone has
continued to have a good attitude."
Stanford's overall performance puts
them in good shape for NCAAs, with the
Cardinal squad turning in its most consis
tent tournament this spring. This is their
last tourney before the championships in
three weeks.

'Except for that first
round, we showed that we
could play with San
Jose. . . . We are a shot-mak
ing team and so is San Jose
State, so it'll come down to
who's making the shots.'

"It looks like we've got some players who
found that they could get low scores," said
women's coach Tim Baldwin.
"That's what it's going to take for us
to be competitive with Arizona, San Jose
State, and Georgia. Audrey and Adele just
have to fire numbers like that at
NCAAs."
Wooding echoed her coach's sentiments.
"I am really confident about myself indi
vidually and about the team," she said.
"This tournament was great for us.
"Except for that first round, we showed
that we could play with San Jose. . . . We
are a shot-making team and so is San Jose
State, so it'll come down to who's making
the shots."

Wooding drove and putted her way to second-place individually as
the Cardinal came in second in the California Collegiate Tourna
ment.
The California Intercollegiate women's
golf tournament was held on the Stanford
Golf Course Sunday and Monday, under
clear blue skies and all-around perfect condi
tions.
But the weather and greens weren't the
only top-notch features of the tourney, as
the top-ranked field lit the course on fire,
shattering records during the two days of
competition.

Women's golf

Stanford takes second at the
California Intercollegiate

San Jose State bolted out of the blocks in
the first round of play, breaking the
course's 18-hole women's team record,
with 284 strokes, four under the previous
record.
Individual champion Tracy Hanson, also
broke the 54-hole individual record set in
1984 by Stanford's Kathleen McCarthy,
leading the Spartans to an impressive over
all victory. San Jose State's 870-stroke
tournament total annihilated the 884
stroke course record set by UCLA last year.
The Cardinal finished second to the
Spartans, in a highly respectable perfor
mance featuring many low rounds by Stan
ford individuals.
The Cardinal's 884 stroke team total
would have tied the old UCLA record for
three rounds, if not for San Jose State.
Stanford beat the Spartans in the second
and third rounds, but could not surpass the
huge lead San Jose mustered in their first
outing.
Audrey Wooding once again led the Car
dinal squad, finishing second individually

with a three-round performance of 72, 74,
and 74 strokes, maintaining the consisten
cy Stanford needs for the upcoming NCAA
Championships.
"I've been getting a lot of practice this
Spring," said Wooding, a member of the
Pacific 10 Conference first-team. "I've been
practicing my putting. It's also nice to play
at home, knowing the course.
"I definitely think my attitude is awe
some. Having a couple of good tournaments
really helped out."
Adele Moore finished up tied for seventh
place, shooting a 72, 73 and 79 during the
competition. Moore put in a solid perfor
mance after a few rocky tournaments this
Spring. Moore is now in good position in
the running for high individual spots at the
NCAA Championships.
Cardinal golfers Melinda Daniels and
Amy Lawrence were right behind Moore,
finishing ninth and 10th, respectively.

rounds, with Daniels shooting a personal
