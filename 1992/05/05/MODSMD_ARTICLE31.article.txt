# Unheralded players shine as batsmen sting Hornets 5-4
## Worrell gets win, LaRocca smacks game-winner as Card nine notches mid-week victory in Sacramento 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
There were a lot of barriers to over
come for the Stanford baseball team in
yesterday's game with Sacramento
State. One was the Cardinal's normally
lackluster play against mid-week and
seemingly lesser opponents, harkening
back to earlier losses to St. Mary's and
San Jose State.
Another was a temptation to look
past the game to this weekend's con
ference series with California. Yet
another was the two come-from-ahead
losses Stanford suffered to Sac State
last year. Still another was the injury
to franchise player Jeffrey Hammonds.
However, the Cardinal surmounted all
of these obstacles with the help of
some unsung heroes to sting the Hor
nets 5-4.
Once again, head coach Mark Mar
quess shook the lineup, giving some
valuable playing time to usual non
starters. Nate Olmstead got the start at
first, as did freshman Todd Laßocca at
shortstop, David Holbrook at third, and
John Lynch in left. Brian Sackinsky pre
dictably started the game.
Stanford came out with the same
offensive intensity it had against UCLA,
scoring four runs in the top of the sec
ond. However, the Hornets soon came
back with a run of their own, and three
more in the bottom of the sixth against

shaky relief pitching on behalf of Matt
Marenghi to tie the game at fours. But in
the top of the eighth, Laßocca, in the
first start of his college career, drove in
the winning run.
Laßocca, out of Atlanta, Ga. was
hyped in the preseason as one of the top
recruits in the nation after being drafted
in the third round by the Los Angeles
Dodgers. But the righthanded hitter and
pitcher was kept out of the lineup due to
hitting problems and the emergence of
Jed Hansen. However, Laßocca has
made effective appearances out of the
bullpen, and has a terrific arm in the
field.
Additionally, Laßocca was the third
shorstop to start for the Cardinal in
three games. Marquess seems to be toy
ing with different players at short, sec
ond, and third including various combi
nations of Chris Kemper, Tony Detter,
Matt Bokemeier, and Jeff DesJardins,
who has been hitting well of late in a bid
to regain the starting spot at second.
In another interesting story of little
known Cardinal players, junior Steve
Worrell came in to pitch for Marenghi
for his second appearance of the season,
and performed well enough to get the
win.
Worrell is a senior academically, hav
ing been sidelined in the 1990 season
due to an elbow injury. In fact, just

Sophomore Jeff DesJardins smacks a grounder down the right-field line. The Cardinal got a confidence-building mid-week
win yesterday against Sacramento State in Sacramento.
