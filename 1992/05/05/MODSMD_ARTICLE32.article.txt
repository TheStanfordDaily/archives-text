# Cardinal and Tigers: the naked differences

### 
PRINCETON, NJ - At
Princeton, sport may best
be appreciated in the buff. A
friend of mine at this East Coast
academic shrine told me not to
"dare print" that the Nude
Olympics are this school's biggest
athletic event, but they probably
are.

Every February the majority of
the sophomore class rallies
around an obscure (in origin) tra
dition that mandates the removal
of clothing for a fun-filled evening
of streaking around the campus
and town.
The rest of the university
stands around and watches. It is a
big enough event that this year
the local police set up hidden cam
eras to try to catch some of the
would-be Lady and Lord Godivas
with incriminating photos.

And we thought Big Game
was fun.
To be fair, athletics here at
Princeton do go beyond the non
sequitur.
Yesterday's Daily Princetoni
an told an excited campus that
its men's lacrosse team had not
only beaten Ivy League cellar
dweller Dartmouth for the out
right Ivy crown, but also for a
bye into the quarterfinals of the
NCAA Tournament.
The Tiger laxmen finished the
season 10-2 and are currently
ranked third in the nation â€”
pretty important stuff for a
school whose biggest athletic
claim to fame is being a difficult
team to beat in the first round of
the NCAA basketball tourna
ment.
"Basketball is still No. 1
around here, but lax gets a lot of
attention as well," said senior
Cal Hitzrot. "For the Cornell
game they had probably three or
four thousand people watching."
The numbers do not exactly
stand up to the 86,000 plus that
come to Stanford Stadium to
watch Stanford take on Notre
Dame and Cal, but for a school
