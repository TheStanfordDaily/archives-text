# Cardinal and Tigers: the naked differences
## 
### 
PRINCETON, NJ - At
Princeton, sport may best
be appreciated in the buff. A
friend of mine at this East Coast
academic shrine told me not to
"dare print" that the Nude
Olympics are this school's biggest
athletic event, but they probably
are.

Every February the majority of
the sophomore class rallies
around an obscure (in origin) tra
dition that mandates the removal
of clothing for a fun-filled evening
of streaking around the campus
and town.
The rest of the university
stands around and watches. It is a
big enough event that this year
the local police set up hidden cam
eras to try to catch some of the
would-be Lady and Lord Godivas
with incriminating photos.

And we thought Big Game
was fun.
To be fair, athletics here at
Princeton do go beyond the non
sequitur.
Yesterday's Daily Princetoni
an told an excited campus that
its men's lacrosse team had not
only beaten Ivy League cellar
dweller Dartmouth for the out
right Ivy crown, but also for a
bye into the quarterfinals of the
NCAA Tournament.
The Tiger laxmen finished the
season 10-2 and are currently
ranked third in the nation —
pretty important stuff for a
school whose biggest athletic
claim to fame is being a difficult
team to beat in the first round of
the NCAA basketball tourna
ment.
"Basketball is still No. 1
around here, but lax gets a lot of
attention as well," said senior
Cal Hitzrot. "For the Cornell
game they had probably three or
four thousand people watching."
The numbers do not exactly
stand up to the 86,000 plus that
come to Stanford Stadium to
watch Stanford take on Notre
Dame and Cal, but for a school


T.C.
Hall
with only 4,500 students, three
grand is an impressive turnout.
Princeton is a school steeped in
social — not athletic — tradi
tion, and having a team this
good is something the students
appreciate.
While we at Stanford take
national championships for
granted these days, Princetoni
ans are flipping for a chance to
bring home a national title.
"If Princeton won a national
championship, there would be a
'dancing in the street' kind of
thing going on," said Hitzrot.
"We are known for our aca
demics, not athletics."
Stanford, of course, is known
for both, and being here in New
Jersey definitely makes one
appreciate the latter over the
former.
This past weekend was
"House Parties" weekend, a
time when all the eating clubs
(luxurious mansions that serve
as local clubs) dedicate their
energy towards three days of
drinking, eating and generally
enjoying the few days of sun that
this campus receives.
It is a time of great fun, I am
told, mostly because the seniors
have already finished their the
ses (80-100 page papers that all
seniors do) and the juniors are
wrapping up their Junior Papers
(20-30 page papers lovingly

referred to as "JPs"). It does not
take long to see that the focus on
this campus is centered much
more around the library than
the gym.
Not that this is bad, but bal
ance is always nice, and frankly
Princeton does not have it.
Detractors will argue to the con
trary and point out a plethora of
intercollegiate teams, yet when
the biggest goal of the year is to
capture first place in a league
that specializes in upsets rather
than excellence, one has to won
der.
Which is why when some
thing like this year's men's
lacrosse team does come around,
the general population gets pret
ty excited.
The bummer is that due to
the regional nature of the sport,
even if Princeton wins it all,
they won't get much national
attention (a situation akin to
our winning the water polo
title).
Still, you have to hope for the
best and make due with what
you are given. So what if stu
dents at Princeton don't get
bowl games and a national title
every other week? At least one
night in February the school
gets to see more flesh than the
average Stanford student will in
our years.
Maybe everything balances
out after all.

sequitur.
Yesterday's Daily Princetoni
an told an excited campus that
its men's lacrosse team had not
only beaten Ivy League cellar
dweller Dartmouth for the out
right Ivy crown, but also for a
bye into the quarterfinals of the
NCAA Tournament.
The Tiger laxmen finished the
season 10-2 and are currently
ranked third in the nation —
pretty important stuff for a
school whose biggest athletic
claim to fame is being a difficult
team to beat in the first round of
the NCAA basketball tourna
ment.
"Basketball is still No. 1
around here, but lax gets a lot of
attention as well," said senior
Cal Hitzrot. "For the Cornell
game they had probably three or
four thousand people watching."
The numbers do not exactly
stand up to the 86,000 plus that
come to Stanford Stadium to
watch Stanford take on Notre
Dame and Cal, but for a school

with only 4,500 students, three
grand is an impressive turnout.
Princeton is a school steeped in
social — not athletic — tradi
tion, and having a team this
good is something the students
appreciate.
While we at Stanford take
national championships for
granted these days, Princetoni
ans are flipping for a chance to
bring home a national title.
"If Princeton won a national
championship, there would be a
'dancing in the street' kind of
thing going on," said Hitzrot.
"We are known for our aca
demics, not athletics."
Stanford, of course, is known
for both, and being here in New
Jersey definitely makes one
appreciate the latter over the
former.
This past weekend was
"House Parties" weekend, a
time when all the eating clubs
(luxurious mansions that serve
as local clubs) dedicate their
energy towards three days of
drinking, eating and generally
enjoying the few days of sun that
this campus receives.
It is a time of great fun, I am
told, mostly because the seniors
have already finished their the
ses (80-100 page papers that all
seniors do) and the juniors are
wrapping up their Junior Papers
(20-30 page papers lovingly

referred to as "JPs"). It does not
take long to see that the focus on
this campus is centered much
more around the library than
the gym.
Not that this is bad, but bal
ance is always nice, and frankly
Princeton does not have it.
Detractors will argue to the con
trary and point out a plethora of
intercollegiate teams, yet when
the biggest goal of the year is to
capture first place in a league
that specializes in upsets rather
than excellence, one has to won
der.
Which is why when some
thing like this year's men's
lacrosse team does come around,
the general population gets pret
ty excited.
The bummer is that due to
the regional nature of the sport,
even if Princeton wins it all,
they won't get much national
attention (a situation akin to
our winning the water polo
title).
Still, you have to hope for the
best and make due with what
you are given. So what if stu
dents at Princeton don't get
bowl games and a national title
every other week? At least one
night in February the school
gets to see more flesh than the
average Stanford student will in
our years.
Maybe everything balances
out after all.

thinks the Sigma Chi's would fit
in nicely here at Princeton.
