# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
The top players were stepping out from the
pack this weekend. Athletes who had always
been among the elite in their sport showed
just how talented they really are — and they
did it when their teams needed it most.
Christian Cevaer of the men's golf team
and Jackie Edwards of the women's track
and field team are our Athletes of the Week.
Edwards has already been an Olympian

once, in 1988 for the Bahamas, and she is
getting ready to do it again. Saturday she set
a meet and school record in the triple jump
with a leap of 43 feet, 1/2 inches, and then
took first in the long jump by going 21 feet,
1 and 1/4 inches on her only leap of the day.
Edwards also finished second to fellow
Stanford athlete Chryste Gaines in the 100-
and 200-meters.
Edwards and Gaines led the team to a sec
ond-place finish in the National Indoor cham
pionships in mid-March, and have been push
ing the Cardinal to new heights ever since.
Edwards had an astonishing jump of 20
feet, 8 and 1/2 inches at the Penn Relays in a
meet that was fairly low key for her.
The Penn Relays were her first major
long-jump competition since the National
Indoors. She also runs on the women's
4XIOO relay team.

Cevaer was simply outstanding this week
end as he led the Stanford men's golf team to
its first Pacific 10 Conference Tournament
victory since 1977.
The Cardinal won by 19 strokes over No. 1
Arizona State, thanks in large part to Cevaer's
12-under par 276 over four days of compe
tition. He finished eight shots ahead of his
closest competitor, teammate Notah Begay.
He shot a Pac-10 Championship record 67
on the first day of the tournament and
remained consistent throughout, shooting
68, 72, and 69 in the following rounds.
This is Cevear's second conference champi
onship at Stanford — he won the competition

as a freshman in 1989. He is the first golfer
to achieve two individual titles in 24 years.
The last two-time winner was Kemp Richard
son of USC, who did it in 1967 and 1968.
"I am overwhelmed hy my play here,"
Cevaer said.
The team's victory over the top-ranked Sun
Devils and No. 2 Arizona Wildcats was all the
more astonishing after Arizona had beaten
the Cardinal at home just two weekends ago.
