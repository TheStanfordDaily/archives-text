She's gained consistency and has put more
pressure on her opponents this year. But
there's still room for progress.
Being more aggressive is something Wood

With tennis player Emma Woodhouse, the
term well-traveled takes on a whole new
dimension. The sophomore is a native of
Gloucester, England, but moved to California
four years ago.
Even before that, only Phileas Fogg had
more frequent flier miles than Woodhouse.
She was a long-time member of England's
junior national team and played tournaments
in Germany, France and "just about every
where but Spain," she said.
During those trips, Woodhouse had experi
ences some of the most worldly Stanford stu
dents most likely haven't.
"We went to Israel for a 12-and-under tour
nament and we got thrown in the Dead Sea,"
she said. "I don't remember how the tennis
went, though."
When her family moved to the U.S., Wood
house experienced some culture shock. "I
came from an all-girls Catholic school to a
public school where the guys pinch your butt
when you walk by," she said.
While Woodhouse became well-adjusted
socially, she also had to adapt to a completely
different tennis system.
As a junior player in California — an Amer
ican tennis mecca — Woodhouse was not
nearly the standout she was in England.
"It was a step down prestige-wise but
there's better coaching and players in the
U. 5.," she said. "I got to go a lot of places (as a
junior in England) but we'd always lose. My
game has improved so much here."
Woodhouse echoes that sentiment since
arriving at Stanford last year. "All the players
here are dedicated and hard-working," she
said. "That helps you improve your game."

Frank Brennan calls it my third or fourth
serve because there's such a difference
between it and my first serve.
"I also want to come in (to net) more. The
difference between me and better players is
that they don't miss an opportunity to come
in. They never miss a chance to attack."
Because Woodhouse is tall and strong some
coaches have encouraged her to serve and vol
ley, but she is uncomfortable with that style.
"I don't really have the head for it," she
said, citing the constant risk-taking that's
involved. "I try to work my way to the net."
Her improvement this year has been stifled
by a hamstring tear she suffered in March.
"It's hard to keep a positive attitude when
you want to be out there so much," Wood
house said.
Having missed the last eight dual matches,
Woodhouse has a 12-2 singles record at pri
marily the four and five positions. Cracking
the singles lineup was her major goal this
year.

"I wanted to play singles," she said. "But
maybe I should have made it my goal to not
get injured."
The injury is that even inopportune since it
may endanger her ability to win matches at
the NCAA Championships next week.

"Sometimes I've been able to come back
after an injury and play just as well before and
sometimes I haven't," she said.
Realizing that her teammates may ques
tion whether she will be sharp enough to win
the tough matches, Woodhouse said, "I want
to prove that they didn't need to worry."
She is even more determined to contribute
victories because she was virtually a non-fac
tor at last year's championships. Woodhouse
was paired with junior Heather Willens at No.
3 doubles in the 1991 campaign, but the Car
dinal didn't play any meaningful doubles
matches in the NCAA tourney.
If Stanford's dual matches go to doubles
this year, Woodhouse is ready. She and part
ner Kylie Johnson, ranked No. 14, have
adjusted well to each other's games. The
senior likes Woodhouse's power game and
the sophomore praised Johnson's service
game.

Sophomore Emma Woodhouse, though hobbled by injury recently,
has made significant contributions to the Stanford women's tennis
team from the four and five singles spots. Woodhouse and the rest
of the Cardinal are preparing to host the NCAA Women's Tennis
Championships next week.
Woodhouse said that Johnson
has a stronger serve than Willens,
but that Willens returns better.
"Basically, I poach more on
Kylie's serve and I poached more
on Heather's return," she said.
With the parity in college
ranks, Woodhouse believes men
tal attitude may be the key to her
and Johnson's success at NCAAs.
"Kylie and I have to make sure
we're sharp," she said. "It's more
psychological, which team can get
more fired up."
Speaking of sharp, Wood
house looks to a future career in
orthopedics or pediatrics. It is
unlikely that she'll play profes

sional tennis because of those
aspirations.
"I'm going to Medical School
and that takes so much time I'd
like to get right on with it," said
the well-rounded sophomore.
But right now, the only
surgery she's interested in is slic
ing up her opponents at NCAAs.
"I play my best tennis in team
tournaments, team situations,"
she said.
She was the only Cardinal to
go 4-0 in the National Team
Indoor Championships. Florida
edged Stanford in the finals of
that competition and Woodhouse
would like nothing more than a
rematch for the national title.
Woodhouse added, "The best
would be for Florida to reach the
finals and we beat them 6-0."
Well said.
