The Stanford women's lacrosse team start
ed off slowly at the California Final Four in
Santa Barbara last weekend, but they finished
their season well and made their mark by the
end of the tournament.
"We had a really good season, and this
weekend was great," said coach Julie Duff.
After dropping the first game to UC-Santa
Barbara 10-5, the Cardinal bounced back and
hammered UC-San Diego 20-9, finishing
third overall in the tournament and in Cali
fornia.

Defense highlighted Stanford's play
throughout the weekend as defenders Laura
Romeu and Wendy Golden each had five
interceptions. Sonya Rudenstine was named
the Outstanding Defender of the Final

Knight.

her," Duff said. "She played really well."
On the offensive side, Betsy Bassis led the
team with seven goals, followed by Jennifer
Watts and Christina Wielette with five each.

including Rudenstine and Katherine Borden,

however, were the Cardinal players' perfor
mances in the All-Star game held after the
regular matches.

the All-Star game: Rudenstine, Romeu,
Bassis, Watts, and Jessica Bar. Watts was
