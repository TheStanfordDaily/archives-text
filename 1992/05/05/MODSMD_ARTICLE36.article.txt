# Women's water polo finishes with an upswing

### George Malone Editorial Staff 
Turnabout was more than fair play for the
Stanford women's water polo team last week
end.
The squad, which had had a disappointing
year until recently, went 3-2 at the Pacific
Coast Championships at Berkeley and ended
the season on quite a high note.
"We absolutely rocked the world this week
end," said senior captain Leny Marcus. "A 3-2
record is a great turnaround for us."
The team finished with a 9-13-1 record, but
eight of those wins have come in the last four
weeks.
The women opened with a 15-8 drubbing of
rival California, but then lost 5-2 to Edmon

ton, Canada to even their record. The Cardi
nal also dropped a heartbreaker to Calgary
when the Canadians scored their final goal
with two seconds remaining to eke out a win,
8-7.
But Stanford regrouped and got two strong
wins to end the tournament, edging UC-San
Diego 7-6 and then thrashing UC-Santa Cruz,
8-3.
"It was a good way to end the season and
end my senior year," said Marcus. "We really
gelled."
The Cardinal's showing was even more
remarkable because the team had to travel
without Michelle Dix, their starting goalie,
who was not able to go with the team.
Graduate student Kim Geil and senior
Susan Meyer filled in admirably for Dix, how

ever, as Stanford's defenders were able to hold
off furious assaults all weekend. At one point
in the tournament Stanford's opponents were
only able to manage two shots on goal for an
entire quarter.
"Our defense was just amazing," Marcus
said.
Marcus attributed the upturn to an
increased intensity in her team's play on
offense.
"Everyone started making things happen
[these last four weeks]," said Marcus. "Our
whole offense clicked. Jacinda Mawson (a
freshman) was fired up and was a scoring
machine. And the players who normally
played well, Hillary Green, Katie Sternfels,
and Karen Suskiewicz, all had great games
too."
