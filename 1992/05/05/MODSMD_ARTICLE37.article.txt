# Parish lets his playing do the talking as Celts even series
## 
### 
RICHFIELD, Ohio (AP) - Once
again, the reports of Robert Parish's
demise were premature.
Boston's 38-year-old center bounced
back from two miserable performances
by scoring 27 points and grabbing eight
rebounds last night as the Celtics beat
the Cleveland Cavaliers 104-98, tying
their Eastern Conference semifinal series
1-1.
Parish made only two of 12 shots and
totaled six points in the Celtics' previous
two playoff games. At his age, every
slump is perceived as a crisis — by every
one but his teammates.
"He answered every question after he
played bad," Kevin McHale said. "He

answered questions about being too old.
He answered questions about Brad
Daugherty being too good for him. Today,
he played well and he'll let others do the
talking."
Despite aggravating his sore left ankle
in the third quarter of Saturday's loss to
the Cavs, Parish sank 13 of 18 shots
while helping limit Daugherty to 22
points on 7-for-15 shooting. Daugherty
scored only two points in the fourth quar
ter.
"Robert Parish is a vintage player, and
he played like fine wine tonight," Cleve
land's John Battle said. "He's a veteran,
but he's young at heart. They shot the
ball extremely well, and our intensity

went up and down because of it."
Reggie Lewis scored 26 points and
McHale finished with 18 for the Celtics,
winners of 12 of their last 13 games.
Larry Bird has missed all 13 games
because of his sore back.

—Cleveland Cavaliers' John Battle

in the next two games Friday night and
Sunday, trailed 76-75 entering the fourth
quarter. But a 16-6 run, capped by
Parish's two inside baskets, gave the
Celtics a 91-82 lead.
Cleveland closed to 91-87 on a 3-point
er and two foul shots by Mark Price

before McHale sank a jumper that quiet
ed the sellout crowd of 20,273 with 4:44
left. The Cavs got no closer than six after
that.
Price scored 20 points and Larry
Nance and Battle each had 14 for Cleve
land, which lost for the seventh time in
its 22 home playoff games.
The Celtics, who made 43 percent of
their shots in the 101-76 series-opening
loss, improved to 59 percent in winning
Game 2. The Cavaliers lost despite shoot
ing 52 percent.
"I thought we played good defense,"
Price said.
"McHale, Parish and Lewis came up
big. They just made their shots."
