"Manhandled. That's all I can
say," said Marc Weinberger about
the Stanford Blood's treatment of
their opponents last Sunday.
The two Stanford Men's Ulti
mate Teams (SMUT) and the
Gals' Ultimate Team of Stanford
(GUTS) traveled to nearby
Pleasanton to compete in the
Northern California Collegiate
Ultimate Championships.
Team Blood's three wins,
extending their collegiate win
ning streak to 21 games, alluded
to their number one ranking
nationally.
"In our first two games, a run
away semi carrying a full load of
beets would have been easier to
stop," said co-captain Gia Bosko
of their 13-4 trouncing of UC-
Santa Cruz and 13-9 victory over
UC-Davis.
But the magic had to end
against California, as the GUTS

were handed a 13-6 defeat.
"In the world of sport fishing,
Berkeley is the deep-sea bass, or
the tuna, if you will, while Davis
and Santa Cruz are kippers and
sardines, respectively. I'm
pleased with our performance,"
said Annemarie Preonas.
Dispensing with all niceties,
the enigmatic second SMUT
team, Blood Dry, noisily slurped
up two victories en route to secur
ing a place in the Western Region
als with their sixth place finish.
No members of this team were
available for comment. No human
being has ever successfully inter
viewed one of them and lived.
The first SMUT team, known
as Team Blood, won the tourna
ment.
"The carnage that ensued in
the first game made Pickett's
Charge look like a nursing home
game of rubber bridge," said
Kellen Glass of Blood's 13-0 victo
ry over San Francisco State.
The day's second game against

Los Positas College did not prove
to be much closer. Stanford's
workman-like offensive "swing"
proved at once to be too much for
the opposition, marching the disc
downfield like Mummers on
parade.
In a futile attempt to stem the
flow of the Bloody offense, Los
Positas resorted to a zone
defense, but that proved to be no
more effective than extinguishing
a raging inferno with high grade
aviation fuel.
Defending national champion
Santa Cruz was the final team to
be taught the Blood's convincing
lesson.
"We were a dominatrix in
greased leather boots, mercilessly
disciplining the naughty Banana
Slugs," said Brad Smallwood.
All three Stanford ultimate
teams will compete in next week's
Western Regional Championships
at Davis, vying for one of two cov
eted berths to College Nationals.
Team Blood is seeded first.
