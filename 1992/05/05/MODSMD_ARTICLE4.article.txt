# Green likely to close doors at 10 next year

### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
Green Library will close at 10 p.m. on
weeknights as part of a budget-cutting
proposal administrators say is almost cer
tain to be adopted next year.
Students reacted with dismay over the
likelihood that the library, currently open
until midnight Monday through Thurs
day, will shut down two hours earlier.
Although there has been no formal
announcement yet, Bob Street, vice presi
dent for Libraries and Information
Resources, said the plan is "pretty defi
nitely" going to be implemented.
Street said it would be hard to tell how
much money the reduction in hours will
save, but he estimated it to be $75,000-
$100,000.
Libraries and Information Resources
must cut $3.1 million from its budget as
part of the University's plan to meet its
$43 million deficit.
The proposal cutting Green's hours has

been under consideration for "some
months" as part of the budget reductions,
according to Access Services Director Joan
Krasner. She said it originated in her
department.
Money will be saved because there
"would be fewer staff," Krasner said. "The
remaining staff would work different
hours."
Street said most of the staff cut would
be part-time employees.
Green used to close at 10 p.m. about six
or seven years ago, according to Dan Kop
pel, who has worked at the library for 13
years in Filing and Searches. He said the
hours were lengthened to midnight after
some faculty members complained.
Next year, "people will come in earlier
and make it busier. . . . It'll also mean two
hours less to do filing and discharging,"
Koppel said.
"Students will probably go to Meyer,"
he said, "but Meyer is practically going to
be closed down next year."
Street said that a part of Meyer
may remain open at night,
though, as "study space" for the
students. Services will not be
open, however.
But many students studying in
Green last night did not consider
using Meyer or any of the other
campus libraries to be promising
alternatives.
Some cited the noise in the
dorms and students' tendency to
study during the later hours as
reasons why the library should
stay open until midnight.
The shorter hours "would be
devastating," sophomore Susie
Hobbins said. "I'm already feeling
pushed out the door at midnight."
Ken Mitchell, a first-year grad

uate student in business, said he
also stays at Green until mid
night. "10 p.m. is way too early.
Most people don't get here until 8
p.m.," he said. -
Sophomore Emile Bruneau is
one of those students who gets to
the libraries late.
"Most of my studying goes on
between 10 p.m. and midnight. At
midnight, the dorms start to
quiet down, but not before then,"
he said.
Students said Meyer is not as
good for studying. Green "is a lot
quieter than Meyer. The facilities
are also a lot better," sophomore
Roberta Woolley said.
The proposal to cut two to
three hours a day from the time
Green is open was part of the
overall budget reduction plan
submitted by Library and Infor
mation Resources to the Cabinet
Committee on Budget and Strate
gic Planning in January.
