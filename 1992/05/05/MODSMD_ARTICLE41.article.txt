# With lack of COP, several vie for senate chair
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Contenders are lining up for next week's
ASSU Senate Chair election, a decision that
will have added importance now that the
Council of Presidents has been abolished.
Derek Miyahara, a graduate senator who
helped create a plan last week to restructure stu
dent government, said next year's senate chair
will be in charge of much of the ASSU's internal
business previously carried out by the COP.
For example, he said, the chair may have to
oversee ASSU business projects such as Flicks
and Lecture Notes.
Current Senate Chair Kevin Warsh said he
has received calls from about twelve interest
ed students, but has not received any letters of
intent from candidates yet.
But sophomore Ron Brown said he will def
initely run, and senior Ralph Ermoian and
graduate student Rob Corry both said they are
considering seeking the position.
The newly-elected senate will pick their
new leader May 12. Warsh said all candidates
need to file a statement of their intent to run
by 5 p.m. Thursday.
"Especially without a COP, it seems to be a

much sought-after position," Warsh said.
However, he would not comment on the
names of students who had contacted him.
The"I Prefer Not to Have a COP" slate,
which won last month's ASSU elections, has
pledged to dissolve the Council of Presidents
next year by asking voters to amend the ASSU
constitution.
The plan to replace the executive body,
which was agreed to in a meeting of some mem
bers of the Prefer slate and senate-elect last
week, would place the senate chair in charge of
an executive committee assigned to dealing
with internal matters such as business projects.
"The senate chair is going to have to be a
much better administrator" next year to
insure that the new system of government
runs smoothly, Miyahara said.
But he stressed that the chair will not be an
all-powerful executive next year. "I didn't
want to raise people's levels of anxiety by
thinking they were voting for the ASSU czar,"
he said.
Brown, who ran unsuccessfully for COP
with the "Independents: A New Era" slate last
month, said he believes the senate chair's role
will be bigger next year.
However, he added that the restructuring

proposal will not make the chair as powerful
as many thought after the election. Brown
said he thinks the chair's "biggest additional
responsibility" next year will be making sure
the bureaucracy of the ASSU runs smoothly.
"It's mostly a facilitation role," he said.
Brown stressed that the chair should not be
seen as the sole voice for student-administra
tion talks next year.
Corry, who won a graduate senate seat last
month, said he thought the ASSU is currently
"undergoing a credibility crisis," and a strong
senate chair could help guide the senate
toward "proactive" leadership.
He called fears that the chair would be too
powerful next year "pretty reasonable," but
said he believes the new plan is a step in the
right direction to curtail the chair's power.
Ermoian, who was director of the ASSU
Speaker's Bureau this year, said having no
COP will provide a "great opportunity" for stu
dent government if a strong chair is elected.
He said he sees the chair as "somebody who
could be a point person for the senate when
they need to be contacted immediately," and
said the position might be especially impor
tant with a new University president coming
next year.
