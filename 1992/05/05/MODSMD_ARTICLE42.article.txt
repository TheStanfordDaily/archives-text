# Fountain hopping likely to remain a memory
## 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Keep your socks on — the tra
dition of fountain hopping, which
so many students have missed the
past few years, will probably have
to be put on hold for at least
another year as water rationing
continues on campus and in the
Bay Area.
But keeping the fountains
turned off may be more a matter
of cost and reputation than water
conservation, according to Utili
ties Manager Mike McKnight.
The fountains could theoreti
cally be filled with non-potable
water, which does not fall under
the 25 percent water ration the
San Francisco Water Company
has been imposing since 1988.
Stanford already uses non
potable water for weekly night
irrigation and filling Lake Lag.
While McKnight predicts "at
best a one in 10 chance" the foun
tains will be on by graduation, the
University must take several fac
tors into account before making
its final decision.
First, Stanford has to consider

the cost of bringing in non-potable
water to the fountains, since the
University has no direct lines to
this water source. An additional
expense is related to the fact that
non-potable water has many more
impurities than regular water and
could discolor or damage the foun
tains, according to McKnight.
McKnight said another factor
is the negative publicity Stanford
would receive if it ran water in its
fountains while everyone else in
the surrounding area continued
the rationing.
If Stanford decided to turn the
fountains on, he added, the Uni
versity would have to get a lot of
publicity to make sure people
realize that water in the fountains
would be non-potable.
McKnight said he hopes the
fountains will be turned on by
this time next year.

Stanford would receive negative publicity if it
ran water in its fountains while everyone else
continued rationing, said Utilities Manager
Mike McKnight.

According to Greg Tom, deputy
general manager of the San Fran
cisco Water Company, "the over
all water condition is no better
than last year at the same time"
despite the wet winter.
All of the rain that fell along
the coast is "immaterial since it
did not end up as snowpack in the
Hetch Hetchy watershed in the
central Sierras," Tom said.
Since it is the snowpack which
is the source of the drinking
water, the amount of rainfall gave
"a false message," he said.
"When the snowpack and precip
itation is less than normal and we
are in the fifth year of a drought,"
Tom said, "there is no way we can
end the 25 percent rationing."
Such restrictions regarding the
use of the potable water include
no decorative water features,
minimum irrigation — only at

night — and no free-flowing
water in the street.
The water restrictions,
imposed by the San Francisco
Water District over the 33 com
munities which it serves, are
determined from the last year full
water usage was allowed, 1987.
The restrictions require using 25
percent less than the normal daily
280 million gallons used by the
district's customers, Tom said.
However, because Stanford
directly pipes into the water line
and is a wholesale customer of the
water company, it is able to set its
own restrictions. The district
determines the cutback, but
determining the usage is "a local
issue," said McKnight.
But McKnight added that even
though the University "sets its
own rules, we try to play the game
right" and go along with the
water company's suggestions.
Herb Fong, the manager of
Grounds and Custodial Services,
said that in the event the Univer
sity "ever gives the go ahead" to
turn on the fountains, "they have
been serviced and cleaned and are
ready to go."
