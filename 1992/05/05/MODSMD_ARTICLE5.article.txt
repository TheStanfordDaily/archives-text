# Students discuss race Black-Korean relations tackled by panel
## 
### Leta Hong Fincher Staff writer 
The targeting of Korean stores in the
Los Angeles riots was the result of deeply
imbedded resentment and stereotypes, a
panelist told audience members last night
at an event organized by Stanford's black
and Korean student organizations.
"Blacks have these myths about Kore
ans and Koreans have these myths about
blacks, and it amounts to a stand-off,"
Larry Aubry, senior consultant for the Los
Angeles Human Relations Commission,
told a Roble Hall audience of about 150.
The Black Student Union and the Kore
an-American Student Association planned
the discussion on improving black-Korean
relations in the wake of violence following
the Rodney King beating verdict.
After his speech, Aubry encouraged dis
cussion among members of the audience.
One student said he went to school in
the ghetto, where many stores in the black
community were owned by Koreans.
"It's hard for a black person to buy black

hair-care products from a Korean. That
would be like a black person owning a store
in K-town and selling kimchi," he said.
KASA co-chair Harry Cheigh said "both
minorities have a common interest. It's
important that everything starts at a grass
roots level."
One Korean student said that talk about
changing the government and public policy
is useless until people feel comfortable with
each other. "I don't think a lot of Koreans
and African-Americans know each other.
How many of you actually are good friends
with someone of the other race?"
"If you've been in a store in the inner
city, you can feel the hostility," Aubry
said. "When that merchant looks at that
youngster, he sees somebody about to rip
him off â€” a faction. Similarly, the kid
doesn't see a human being. The kid sees
somebody who is distrustful, who needs to
be ripped off because he's arrogant and
disrespectful."
Koreans would relate better to blacks if
they understood the unique
nature of black history, Aubry
said.
"The history of African-Amcri
cans in this country is a unique
situation. People were cut off
from family, from language, from
culture, from siblings, and from
anything that resembled affini
ty."
A Korean student in the audi
ence said many Koreans didn't
have any knowledge of black his
tory in America. "Because of slav
ery, [Koreans! think of the black
community as not having as hard
a work ethic," she said.
If Koreans didn't understand
black history, many blacks didn't
know about Korean history
either, another student said.

"Most Koreans were subjected
to intense oppression by the
Japanese. So Koreans come to
this country with this resentment
towards other people trying to
dominate them," he said.
Aubry said Stanford students
have plenty of opportunities to
begin affecting the lives of "the
disenfranchised."
"Right around the corner, in
East Palo Alto, you'll find there
are children there who think so
low of themselves you wouldn't
believe it. They can't find their
self-concept with a microscope.
It's in that context that the Kore
ans come in, seeking to make a
living.
Until we begin to break
through the stereotypes that
Koreans and blacks hold about
each other, Aubry said, American
minorities will continue to relate
only in an atmosphere of fear and
intimidation.
