When Aida dances, people pay
attention. She's not especially
talented on the dance floor, but
she never fails to evoke shocked
stares and whispers when she
sways suggestively and seduc
tively to the music.
Aida dances with women.
Aida Croal is a bisexual fresh
man, and she's not ashamed or
secretive about it.

At Hip Hop Night or any
where else, "I always dance with
women," Croal says. "Even
though there's always some per
son or some group of people who
find it necessary to stare when I
do that. 'Look at her. Look at
them,' (they say.)"
Croal remains unaffected by
these critical or just curious reac
tions from onlookers. "It doesn't
bother me," she says with com
fortable ease, a slight grin emerg
ing on her face. "I find it funny.
On one level I expect the pointing
and the staring. But I think it's
amusing that some people are so

obvious about it."
Croal says being open and
honest about her sexuality to the
entire campus community is
important to her.
"I'm seeing a woman now," she
begins. "We walk around holding
hands on campus. We're affection

ate with each other around the
dorm and at the Coffee House."
Their interactions are "no dif
ferent from how any heterosexu
al couple would act," she says.
"I don't alter my behavior,
even though I know it's differ
ent," she says, adding that she is

"not going to be insecure"
because society views her sexual
orientation as "other" or deviant.
"I'm going to get on with my
life in the most healthy way pos
sible," Croal says confidently.
