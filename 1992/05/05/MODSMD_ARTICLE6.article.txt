# Gay students come out to stay true to selves

When Aida dances, people pay
attention. She's not especially
talented on the dance floor, but
she never fails to evoke shocked
stares and whispers when she
sways suggestively and seduc
tively to the music.
Aida dances with women.
Aida Croal is a bisexual fresh
man, and she's not ashamed or
secretive about it.

At Hip Hop Night or any
where else, "I always dance with
women," Croal says. "Even
though there's always some per
son or some group of people who
find it necessary to stare when I
do that. 'Look at her. Look at
them,' (they say.)"
Croal remains unaffected by
these critical or just curious reac
tions from onlookers. "It doesn't
bother me," she says with com
fortable ease, a slight grin emerg
ing on her face. "I find it funny.
On one level I expect the pointing
and the staring. But I think it's
amusing that some people are so

obvious about it."
Croal says being open and
honest about her sexuality to the
entire campus community is
important to her.
"I'm seeing a woman now," she
begins. "We walk around holding
hands on campus. We're affection

ate with each other around the
dorm and at the Coffee House."
Their interactions are "no dif
ferent from how any heterosexu
al couple would act," she says.
"I don't alter my behavior,
even though I know it's differ
ent," she says, adding that she is

"not going to be insecure"
because society views her sexual
orientation as "other" or deviant.
"I'm going to get on with my
life in the most healthy way pos
sible," Croal says confidently.

Although Matthew Fraleigh is gay and Mitch Golden is straight, the sophomores have remained
roommates — and close friends — for the past two years.
But maintaining this outlook
sometimes proves awkward and
difficult. Earlier this year, she
went to Club Ujamaa with a
woman she had been dating, and
they slow-danced together. Croal
says she encountered "a lot of
hostile stares; pointing; people
whispering, 'It was a shame,' and
'Disgusting.' "
The hostility was "threaten
ing," she recalls. But she says she
did not change her actions or ges
tures. "It wasn't any more sug
gestive than between a man and a
woman," she says.
'A supportive environment*
Aside from the hostility she
encountered at Club Ujamaa,
Croal says the only other problem
caused by her sexual openness has
been her relationship with her
roommate. She says they have reli
gious differences, but is reluctant
explain the details of the situation.
But other dormmates and
friends in her all-freshman dorm
have been supportive and respect
ful of her since she told them she
was bisexual on National Coming
Out Day fall quarter.
"All my friends were very sup
portive of me," she says, adding
that she received "no negative
responses" when she came out.
"My friends were very happy that
I told them and trusted them."
It is frequently difficult for stu
dents to come out in all-freshman
dorms, because of the potential
for being stigmatized or isolated.
But Croal says her dorm is "kind
of exceptional" because they had
been accustomed to living with
openly gay students since the
beginning of the year.
"There was no opportunity for
people to get into the mentality"
of passively accepting insensitive
anti-gay remarks, she says.
Because one senior resident
tutor was "out" in the dorm, it
was easier for Croal, she says.
More freshmen in her dorm
have "come out" since then, she
adds, with silent applause for
these dormmates.
Coming out "is necessary if you
want to be happy," Croal affirms,
noting that it can be "damaging
for people who are not out."
"Before I was out, people said
homophobic things all the time,"

she says, noting a marked differ
ence in their behavior now.
'You have no home'
Many openly gay students
agree with Croal, saying they pre
fer being out and open about their
sexuality to living a lie.
"I think no one really talks about
how hard a time gay students have
in the residences" when people
don't know they are gay, says grad
uate student Eleanor Feingold,
coordinator of the Lesbian, Gay,
Bisexual Community Center. "You
sort of have no home."
Sophomore John Newsome,
who came out last June, says he
grew "sick of lying, having to fab
ricate attractions" to members of
the opposite sex when people
asked about his love life.
"It's like that Eddie Murphy
skit on Saturday Night Live when
he's trying to be a white man,"
Newsome says. Although he illus
trates the dilemma in comical
terms, he also describes its famil
iar and more painful side.
"It's so hard to pull off," New
some says, referring to his 19
years "in the closet."
"It's so frustrating. Even when
you can fool other people, you

really can't fool yourself," he con
tinues. "There's this constant
being on edge, tension."
This tension, resulting partial
ly from deception and partially
from the fear that others will
"find out," may be justified in
some cases where the environ
ment is hostile to people who
aren't heterosexual.
"When a student comes out,
many people support them, applaud
them and respect their courage.
And other students make harsh
judgements about them," said Mul
ticultural Educator Greg Ricks.
'He's my best friend'
But the paranoid fear that peo
ple will "find out" is completely
foreign to Matthew Fraleigh, a
sophomore who came out to his
parents when he was 13.
Because he grew up in an envi
ronment that was very receptive
to gays — his parents, both psy
chologists, had some openly gay
friends — Fraleigh never believed
he was abnormal or deviant.
Because of his background,
Fraleigh says he cannot relate well
to people who are not out. "If I
make a vague reference to sexuali
ty, that really sets some people off."

During his first month at Stan
ford, he came out to his freshman
roommate, Mitch Golden, who
was shocked and felt "ashamed"
at his own insensitivity because he
had previously told anti-gay jokes.
"When he came out, I felt the
lowest I've ever felt," he recalls
with regret. "I realized I was mak
ing a mockery of his entire life. It
was sort of a rude awakening —
the fictitious objects of my jokes
really do exist."
Since then, Golden has become
much more sensitive to and aware
of gay issues, joining his roommate
in gay-rights protests and visiting
gay bars in San Francisco's Castro
District. "I don't get as much of a
kick out of it (as Fraleigh does),"
Golden says with a smile. "For him
this llifestyle] is identity."
Golden and Fraleigh decided to
be roommates again this year.
And while Golden realizes that
some people may be suspicious
about his motives for choosing to
"room with a gay guy for the sec
ond year in a row," their assump
tions don't phase him.
"He's my best friend," he says
of Fraleigh. "He's a person. He's
gay. And he's the most intelligent
and kind-hearted person I know."

For the Record

Former Hoover Institution
director W. Glenn Campbell did
not write a formal apology to Vis
iting Scholar Srdjan Trifkovic for
remarks Campbell allegedly
made, as reported yesterday.
Hoover Director John Raisian
issued the apology.
