# Rap group makes coming out easier
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
"Coming out" is not just a one-time event but
a progression that can take months, and even
years, according to members of Stanford's gay,
lesbian and bisexual community.
During that process of self-realization, it
becomes important for people to have a forum for
sharing opinions and experiences. And many stu
dents turn to the student-run Coming Out Rap
Group at the Bridge for support.
Participants in the group are in varying stages
of coming out, according to Bill Ho, one of the
groups facilitators. Some have already come out
to everyone but their parents and others are "still
questioning" their sexuality, he said.
"For some people, it's a big step just to walk
into The Bridge" because they're afraid people
will find out, said Ho, a graduate student in the
Medical School's MD/Ph.D. program.
The range in experience allows people who are
"earlier on" in the coming-out process to benefit
from those who have already come out.
The weekly meetings begin with check-in, dur
ing which each member tells about their week.
Afterward, the discussion branches off to cover a
particular topic, which changes each week and

includes such issues as "coming out to yourself
and "labels and stereotypes," Ho said.
"For many people, (these meetings are) the first
time they've heard other people's experiences," Ho
said. "It's an amazing thing, realizing that other
people have experienced the same things you have
— the trials and tribulations of dating in high
school that (you) never told anyone."
Membership in the Coming Out group, which
is facilitated by four students, two men and two
women, has more than doubled this year to about
15 or 20 participants.
Ho attributes this change to an increase in
publicity — through fliers and announcements.
In general, Ho said, the atmosphere at Stan
ford is conducive to coming out. "Stanford has a
pretty good support network," he said.
"Its eons better than what I was used to," Ho
said, referring to his undergraduate years at
Princeton.
"Things may be getting better there now," Ho
added doubtfully, mentioning the school's conser
vative nature.
He agreed that some students have isolated
negative experiences coming out at Stanford.
Those cases usually involve covert hostility, such
as notes left on computers or other anonymous
acts, he said.
