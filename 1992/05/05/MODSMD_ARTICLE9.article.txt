Student denies battery charges
A fifth-year senior who was arrested April 16 on battery
charges has denied the charges and will plead "not guilty,"
according to a statement.
"I categorically refute any and all charges brought against me
by the District Attorney," said the student, Peter Habicht, who
will make his plea tomorrow in Palo Alto Municipal Court.
A former roommate had reported to the Santa Clara County
District Attorney's office that she had been "dragged .. . around
the room" by Habicht Jan. 2.
Habicht said in the statement: "I will be presenting the facts
regarding this case in court myself in the near future."
