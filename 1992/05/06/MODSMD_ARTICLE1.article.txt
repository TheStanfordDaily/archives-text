# Violent memories dominate teach-in
## Profs share pain from '60s, LA riots 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Back in the '60s, Clay Car
son hoped the Watts riots
would spur people to fight for
racial equality. Now, in the
wake of the Los Angeles vio
lence, he is not so optimistic.
"Many of my illusions were
destroyed in August of 1965,"
the history professor told a 50-
person crowd at a teach-in yes
terday. After the energy of the
riots, "cynicism supplanted
hope and black activists became
former activists," he said.

Carson, a former member of
a non-violent protest group,
was in Watts the days of the
riots, caught in the violence as
a first-aid volunteer.
Trapped between the police
and his office, Carson said he
attempted to explain that he
wasn't one of the rioters. They
"did not stop to listen to anything
but began beating us," he said.
"I wondered if I would be
another justifiable homicide,"
he added.
The Watts riots "made clear
to us that this spontaneous upris
ing had more community support
than all of our non-violent mili
tancy would ever have," Carson
said.

"I must admit a degree of pes
simism because all of that anger
in 1965 did not become a strong
political power," he said. "What I
fear now is that the anger will not
turn into a positive political
power."
Carson was joined yesterday by
five other faculty members who
shared their "Perspectives on

Racism." The teach-in was an
attempt to understand the pre
sent as well as the past.
Sandra Drake, an associate
professor of English, said she
could understand the motivation
behind last week's riots after the
acquittal in the Rodney King
beating trial, having experienced
police brutality herself.

''When a person attacks proper
ty in the United States, where prop
erty is worth more than life, that is
a political statement," she said.
"I suspect some of them were
stealing what they needed., which
Neil Bush never did," Drake said,
referring to the president's son's
involvement in the savings and
loan scandal.
Discussing the jury's decision,
History Prof. George Fredrickson
said jurors were not racist by
their own definition.
"What Rodney King represent
ed was something they wanted to
escape from,"he said, adding that
King was "a representative of dis
order" to the people of Simi Valley.
"It does not occur to the people
in Simi Valley that they are in a
way responsible for the problems
of Los Angeles," he said.
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy said the problems in
Los Angeles are symptomatic of
international ethnic conflict.
He said a worldwide hierarchy
exists, a "tragic legacy of Euro
pean global dominance," in which
whites enjoy economic security.
"The rise of economic mayhem"
in Yugoslavia and the former Sovi
et Union and the "economically
based civil wars" in many Third
World countries are pieces of the
movement, Abernethy said.
Activists miss an important
part of the crisis when they "focus
entirely on events and trends in
this country," he said.
The teach-in was the second in
a series dealing with racial issues
presented by various campus
groups including Innovative Aca
demic Courses, the African Amer
ican Studies Department and the
Black Action Coalition for Justice.
