# Bigger guide to be available for disabled
## 
### Philip Acosta 
After four years of research, the Disability
Resource Center is releasing an updated ver
sion of its guide to services and support groups
for the disabled community at Stanford.
"Access Stanford" has grown with the
needs of disabled students, faculty and staff,
and the range of services provided for them.
The 90-page handbook has tripled in size since
the original 1986 edition was published.
Recently implemented services described in
the guide include laptop lectures, text-to-Braille
scanning and video enlargement devices.
"As the University faces budget shortfalls
and the number of disabled persons attending
here goes up, the DRC will have to deal with
fewer resources," said 1991 graduate Monica
Worline, the main coordinator of the guide.
" 'Access Stanford' will not only encourage

more disabled persons to come to Stanford but
also publicize the DRC to those outside of the
Stanford community, encouraging them to get
involved with the disabled," she said.
A cooperative effort by students, staff and
alumni involved with the DRC, the handbook
was funded through the Dean of Students Office.
Students in the Real Writing Project — a
Freshman English program in which students
work with local organizations to publish mate
rial such as brochures and handbooks — inter
viewed disabled students for the handbook.
Sophomore Steven Heckler, who has a
hearing impairment, received "Access Stan
ford" when he was a prospective applicant.
"I flip through it every once in a while,"
said Heckler, coordinator of the DRC's golf
cart service. He said the handbook reflects
Stanford's commitment to meet the needs of
those with disabilities.

John Asheim, program coordinator for the
DRC, said the guide is valuable because "it
provides concise information for someone at
Stanford with a disability." There are approx
imately 150 disabled students at Stanford.
According to Asheim, 'Access Stanford' "is
patterned after those [resource guides] of the
various campus ethnic groups.
"We've been trying for a while to put out an
updated handbook," he said, adding that there
was a large amount of information that need
ed to be assembled.
Worline said the publication took "six
months of intense work" to complete.
"Access Stanford" will be available, free of
charge, within two weeks. Anyone interested
can contact the DRC, which will mail out
copies. In addition, Assoc. Director of Under
graduate Admissions Jonathan Reider has a
supply.
