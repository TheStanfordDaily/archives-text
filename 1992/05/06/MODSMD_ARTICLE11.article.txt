Key SWAT team retreat; juror goes public
LOS ANGELES (AP) — An elite police SWAT team was
ordered to retreat from the intersection where last week's Los
Angeles riots began, only minutes before a truck driver was sav
agely beaten at the site, a newspaper reported yesterday.
The SWAT team members had been dispatched to the inter
section, the Los Angeles Daily News quoted an unidentified police
source as saying.
The newspaper said superiors ordered SWAT team members
to leave the area without trying to restore order and forbade them
from confronting looters elsewhere, the unidentified source said.
The absence of police at the corner and television news broad
casts of the looting and beating of truck driver Reginald Denny
have been cited as contributing to the spread of violence.
In other developments, a juror in the case went public and
defended the verdict, but said he felt some responsibility for the
rioting that followed it, according to the USA Today.
Juror Christopher Morgan who insisted that the jurors had made
the right decision, said threats have been made against his family.
"At this point in time I would have rather taken the beating
myself than to go through this and put my family through this,"
Morgan said.
