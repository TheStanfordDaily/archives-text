THIS WEEK'S celebration of
the 20th anniversary of Casa
Zapata marked a milestone
for what has been a continuing
success at Stanford. The anniver
sary provides an opportunity to
reflect on the history and achieve
ments of the dormitory — and they
are impressive.
Casa Zapata has provided the
growing number of Chicano/Latino
students at Stanford a place to expe
rience their own culture, and has
sometimes made the transition from
home to college a bit easier.
Zapata's role as a theme house
has made it the natural forum for
debate on Chicano/Latino issues.
Discussions are encouraged by
everything from the thought-pro
voking news pieces on every din
ner table to the political murals
throughout the dorm.
When a disgruntled student
added paper eyes, nose and mouth
to a faceless white person in a Zap

ata mural last quarter, the resi
dent fellows made sure that an
intelligent debate ensued by pro
viding butcher paper and a pen
instead of angry words.
The San Jose Mercury News
editorialized that the resulting
exchange of ideas at Zapata repre
sented "what universities should
be all about."
Standing above the differing
politics of Chicano/Latino groups
on campus, the dorm has provided
an umbrella under which all
groups can find cover.
Zapata serves an important
social function as well. Well-attend
ed, frequent parties — which often
incorporate Chicano/Latino music,
food and dancing — allow Zapata
residents to share their culture
with other students.
A cultural center like Zapata con
tributes vastly to the intellectual envi
ronment here, making Stanford a
more engaging and diverse setting.
