## Why have I lost control? 
### 
HOW CAN I WRITE, when I have
lost control of my emotions?
Not Guilty . .. Not Guilty ... Not
Guilty . . . Not Guilty.
Not Shocked — Why Not?
"TURN OFF THE ENGINE! PUT
YOUR KEYS, DRIVER'S LICENSE,
REGISTRATION AND INSURANCE ON
THE HOOD NOW! PUT YOUR HANDS
ON THE STEERING WHEEL AND
DON'T EVEN THINK OF MOVING!"
Five police cars. Six officers surrounded
my car, guns ready. Thirty minutes I sat,
praying and shaking, only interrupted by
the command, "I SAID, DON'T MOVE!"
Finally, "Everything checks out, you
can go." Sheepishly I asked why. "Oh,
you fit the description of a car thief."
Not Guilty ... Not Shocked — Why Not?
In the jewelry store, they lock the case
when I walk in.
In the shoe store, they help the white
man who walks in after me.
In the shopping mall they follow me —
in the Stanford shopping mall. Last
month I turned and faced their surrepti
tious security: "Catch any thieves today?"
Not Guilty ... Not Shocked — Why Not?
September 1991, Tresidder Union,
back patio. A woman was struggling with
her bags. "Can I help you, ma'am?"
"Oh yes, please . . . WAIT! You're
black." She hurried away.
Not Guilty . . . Not Shocked.
I'm a black man. I am 6 feet 3 inches

tall and 230 pounds, just like King. Do I
scare you? Am I a threat? Does your fear
justify your actions? Twelve people
believed it did.
Black male: Guilty until proven inno
cent.
Reactions to my kind are justified.
Scrutiny is justified. Surveillance is justi
fied. Search is justified. Fifty-six blows
.. . Justified.
Justice? Dear God. . .
I graduated from Stanford last June
— I was elated. I was one of four presi
dents of my class — I was proud. In the
fall, I received a Rhodes Scholarship — I
approached arrogance.
But late one night, as I walked the
streets of Palo Alto, as the police car slowed
down while passing me, as his steely glare
met me, I realized that to him and to so
many others I am and always may be a
Nigger: guilty till proven innocent.
I'm struggling to be articulate, loqua
cious, positive, constructive, but for the
first time in so long, I have lost control of
my emotions. Rage, Frustration,
Anguish, Despondency, Fatigue, Bitter
ness, Animosity, Exasperation, Sadness.
Emotions once suppressed, emotions
once channeled, now are let lose. Why?
Not Guilty . . . Not Shocked.
The violence did not surprise me. If I
were the powers that be, it would not have
taken me three days to call the National
Guard. But maybe when you're discon

nected from reality you move slowly.
Poverty, alienation, estrangement,
continuously aggravated by racism, overt
and institutional. Can you leave your
neighborhood without being stopped?
Can you get a loan from your bank? Can
you be trusted at your local store?
Can you get an ambulance dispatched
to your neighborhood? Can you get the
police to come to your house? Can you get
an education in your school? Can you get
a job? Can you stay alive past 25? Can
you get respect? Can you be heard?
NO! Not until someone catcKes on
video one small glimpse of your everyday
reality and even then, can you get justice?
Our inner cities are stacks of dry
leaves and lumber, waiting for a spark.
This is but a mere campfire compared to
the potential inferno awaiting us. Condi
tions are worsening and the Rodney King
verdict is certainly not the most egre
gious injustice in our midst.
Why have I lost control of my emo
tions? Why do my hands shake as I write?
Tonight, I have no answers.
Dear God ... help us to help ourselves
before we become our own undoing.

I'm struggling to be articulate, loqua
cious, positive, constructive, but for the
first time in so long, I have lost control of
my emotions. Rage, Frustration,
Anguish, Despondency, Fatigue, Bitter
ness, Animosity, Exasperation, Sadness.
Emotions once suppressed, emotions
once channeled, now are let lose. Why?
Not Guilty . . . Not Shocked.
The violence did not surprise me. If I
were the powers that be, it would not have
taken me three days to call the National
Guard. But maybe when you're discon

nected from reality you move slowly.
Poverty, alienation, estrangement,
continuously aggravated by racism, overt
and institutional. Can you leave your
neighborhood without being stopped?
Can you get a loan from your bank? Can
you be trusted at your local store?
Can you get an ambulance dispatched
to your neighborhood? Can you get the
police to come to your house? Can you get
an education in your school? Can you get
a job? Can you stay alive past 25? Can
you get respect? Can you be heard?
NO! Not until someone catcKes on
video one small glimpse of your everyday
reality and even then, can you get justice?
Our inner cities are stacks of dry
leaves and lumber, waiting for a spark.
This is but a mere campfire compared to
the potential inferno awaiting us. Condi
tions are worsening and the Rodney King
verdict is certainly not the most egre
gious injustice in our midst.
Why have I lost control of my emo
tions? Why do my hands shake as I write?
Tonight, I have no answers.
Dear God ... help us to help ourselves
before we become our own undoing.
