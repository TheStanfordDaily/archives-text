Don't judge police officers; they protect the innocent masses

A FEW NIGHTS AGO, I sat in my
room safe near Stanford, unable to
do my homework because
overnight, my family had become threat
ened by the chaotic uproar that resulted
from the verdict in the Rodney King case.
My sympathies then were with the
police officers and guards who had to
somehow control the violence and rein
state order in my community in Los
Angeles, and yet I was surprised to find
that my thoughts were not shared among
my peers in the Stanford community.
Many seemed much more concerned
about the iryustice of the Rodney King
case and seemed very comfortable to
criticize this injustice for causing the
senselessness that resulted. I question
why we, Stanford, chose to hold a rally

in reaction to the case at a time when
the lives of innocent people were threat
ened every single minute that passed by.
The anger that grew in people since
this case began has finally erupted, and I
thought that we would have the good
sense to help keep it from growing ever
worse. Instead, we chose to also vent our
own angers and react with our cry of
civil rights injustice.
As future leaders of this country,
shouldn't we have the good sense to see
that although civil rights and justice are
important to us, the moment calls for
our attention to the chaos in the nation
al community? Shouldn't we be clear
minded enough not to take advantage of
every emotional situation to make our
voices heard, but rather to first consider

the lives of those people in danger?
Shouldn't we see that it does not help
the situation for us to also persuade the
anguish that all too many have already
unleashed onto the innocent? Overnight,
the people created a disaster that match
es or exceedes the levels of natural disas
ters that some unfortunates have experi
enced in the past few years.
Why should we be like the mass in
encouraging this senseless rage? It is
true that matters of civil rights and
injustice must continue to be dealt with
in the future, but now, we should pause
to consider how to deal with the recent
disaster and whether it's worth the
energy to find ways of preventing such
human disasters in the future.
It seems that the best that we can do

right now is to do nothing, which is
something that we refuse to do, but
should do. It would not help to criticize
those who must be on-site to bring
order, specifically our law enforcement
agency. The last thing we need to do is
to make it difficult for those who are
able to save the lives of the innocent.
If Stanford truly consists of unique
individuals who dare to think their own
thoughts, then I believe that they should
stop showing their anger and start
thinking those thoughts. Look at what's
happening to our society — the sense
lessness and chaos. It's not a time to
blame the system; it's a time to calm
down before too many lives are lost.
