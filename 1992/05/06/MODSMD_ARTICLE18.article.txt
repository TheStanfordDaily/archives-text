# Perot's real positions on issues still unclear
## 
### 
This letter is in response to the April 29
editorial in The Daily regarding Ross
Perot's qualifications as a presidential can
didate. It stated that "Perot is stealing
both the Democrats' pro-choice, cut
defense, protect environment platform and
the Republicans' voice of big business...
Although Perot indicated earlier
that he was pro-choice, he has since
taken a step back from that strong
commitment by saying, in answer to a
direct question on choice, that individ
uals must be held accountable for their
actions.
Does this mean that he's pro-choice
some of the time but not always? At the
moment, it's impossible for pro- or anti
choice voters to know whether he sup
ports their views.
It is not only Clinton and Bush cam
paigners who are anxious to know
Perot's real positions and proposed solu
tions to our problems.
The voting public should withhold

support from Ross Perot until he clari
fies his stand on major issues and truly
proves, as your editorial said, "that
straight talk works best."
