# Reasons for outburst of L.A. violence proposed
## 
### 
In several recent discussions, I find
that not many people make the distinction
between justifying the rioting in Los
Angeles and understanding it. Toward the
latter end, I submit that it was largely:
1) a violent response to centuries of
violence inflicted on people of color;
2) a last resort for people who felt the
system will not work for them; and
3) the only way to get the level of
attention now directed at inner city
issues.
On the first point, one might hope
and pray for a more humane response,
but one cannot always expect humane
responses to inhumane acts.

On the second point, what more need
be said? Rodney King is not the only
African-American who has been brutal
ized by white policc, but at least he had
a videotape! If he can't win, who can?
On the third point, the sad fact is that
our society responds most to violence.
America demands violence in its movies.
News services focus on violence in their
coverage. And once silent politicians now
speak out on violence in the inner city.
Those people "turned off" from urban
issues by the violence were mostly
"turned off' and apathetic already. They
are no great loss.
I write this from the vantage point of
an African-American who has experi
enced racial violence as a child and from
that of one who has seen how the system
has treated close friends. Most people
lacking similar experience seem to be
dismissing the rioters as senseless and
animalistic.
In fact, there was much reason in
what they did. While I do not condone
the rioting in L.A., I do understand it.
