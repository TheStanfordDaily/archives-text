# Women harassed by crank callers
## 
### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
At least 15 Stanford women have been
the targets of obscene phone calls within the
past two weeks, according to campus police.
The latest incidents are part of a "contin
uing problem," involving "at least two and
maybe three different male callers," said
Stanford Police Detective Sgt. Dal Bandy,
who has handled several complaints.
According to Bandy, one caller usually
begins by asking the woman, "Did I wake
you?" and then proceeds to engage her in
lengthy conversation, which eventually
"turns sexual in nature."
Sometimes he describes sexual acts he
claims to have performed on a 12-year old
girl he says is with him. Calls of this type
have been reported since February.
Because many of the victims have unlist
ed numbers, police believe the calls are ran
dom. But several women who have been

phoned say the caller may have known them.
"I don't know if the person knew me.
They sounded like they did. I thought it was
one of my friends calling," said one fresh
man, who wished to remain anonymous.
"But then he said, 'I wish you were here. I'm
getting big and hard thinking about you.' "
Police advise women to hang up immedi
ately if a caller refuses to identify himself and
to file a police report if they receive obscene
calls. Because most of the calls go unreport
ed, it is difficult to track down the perpetra
tors, Stanford Police Sgt. Nick Brunot said.
In a seemingly unrelated set of calls, a
sophomore in Terra said she and a friend
were repeatedly contacted last week by a
man who wanted them to pose as nude mod
els for the Art Department.
After having suspicions that the man was
not with the modeling guild, the students
contacted the department and were told the
calls were fraudulent.
