# Morning hours could be reduced at library
## 
### 
In response to the proposal to close
Green Library two hours earlier next
year — at 10 p.m. instead of midnight —
I say that this is the perfect opportunity
to put to good use the numbers registered
by those übiquitous clickers that sound
every time someone enters the library.
If the staff at Green observed those
numbers they would realize that 10 p.m.
to midnight are two of the busiest hours
for the library.
Instead of cutting two hours at the end
of the day, why not cut two hours in the
morning?
Since 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. is much less busy
than 10 p.m. to midnight, the library could
save money while displacing a minimum
number of students if it only opened later
rather closed earlier.
I'm sure those clicker figures will bear
this out.
