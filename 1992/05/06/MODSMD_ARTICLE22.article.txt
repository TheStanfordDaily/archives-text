Atrocities against all
groups must be halted
The events of the past week have
struck me very deeply both personally
and politically. Although I do not con
done the violence of many, I understand
the emotions that have incited such rage.
I know that it is disempowering to see
your brothers and sisters, and sometimes
yourself, trod upon, by mainstream soci
ety. I join this struggle for tolerance
because this is not a battle for African-
American men, but a battle for humani
ty.
From you beside me at the marches
or at the teach-in or in spirit, I ask for
consistency. As a lesbian, it is difficult to
comprehend the intolerance that has
allowed a legal system guaranteeing me
no rights and no recourse.
And it is still hard for me to under
stand how my fellow students could have
told me earlier this year that I should not
have made myself heard at the Pete Wil
son rally and that the battle for my free
doms is still one that I (gays, lesbians and
bisexuals) will have to fight largely alone.

I was, and still remain, enraged by
"the system" that failed me by denying
me the right to employment and housing
despite the reported support of two
thirds of California residents. We must
realize that the oppression of any peo
ples is an atrocity that we must fight,
that we must not tolerate.
As we are in the midst of Bisexual, Gay
and Lesbian Awareness Days (BGLAD), I
invite you to learn about and celebrate my
culture and my struggle. If understanding
is too much to ask, then please just let me
live (e.g. stop defacing the posters).
Until we realize that the physical or
psychological beating of any person is
equally despicable, we cannot hope to
live together peacefully.

Anger directed toward
Copeland's is ludicrous
If I have correctly understood the arti
cle on the'front page of Monday's Daily, a
boycott of Copeland's Sports in Palo Alto
has been called for because that shop's

windows were boarded up in preparation
for the huge protest on rally on Friday.
Apparently, people felt that this action
was "an insult to students," and deserves
to be countered with a boycott.
For days, the papers have been full of
stories about unbelievable anarchy and vio
lence all over the nation. If I were to put
down that morning's Chronicle and then
discover that a huge group of protesters
would be approaching my store, well
SURE, I'd board up my windows in a flash.
C'mon folks, we've all read the papers
in the last year. Stanford students have
been arrested for assaulting people and
for robbery. Just because someone is a
Stanford student doesn't necessarily
mean he or she gets to wear a halo.
Furthermore, according to the account
in The Daily, not everyone in the crowd
was a student. Therefore, even if all Stan
ford students DID wear halos, someone
could have still started throwing bricks.
Recall that the divestment protests at
UC-Berkeley in the mid '80s turned into
riots when the townsfolk got involved.
That could have been Copeland's Sports.
The folks at Copeland's Sports did not
beat Rodney King, nor did they make that
verdict. Like the rest of us, they've most

likely seen the results of other protest ral
lies during the last few days.
To be angry at the store owner
because the owner wanted to protect his
property from possible harm is ludi
crous, and to angrily demand a boycott
of that store is irresponsible at best.

Call for boycotting of
Copeland's is baffling
While my reaction to the Rodney King
trial verdict is one of unequivocal dis
gust, 1 am baffled by Greg Ricks' call for
a boycott of Copeland's — the only store
to board its windows in preparation for
Stanford's protest march on Friday.
"We're not rioters," Ricks said, "we're
scholars." To make this distinction
between the Stanford community and
those who participated in the riots
throughout the country seems not only
to be rather haughty, but paradoxical
given the context of our march.
Wasn't Stanford marching not only to
show outrage over the verdict, but to

express empathy and solidarity with those
who have experienced police brutality and
racist mistreatment most directly?
It is for these people, who now feel so
utterly abandoned and voiceless, that
riot becomes the only outlet for their
anger. Indeed, it seems to be one of the
only ways they feel they can make them
selves heard by this nation.
While Ricks says that the violence of the
Los Angeles rioters "is understandable,"
his comments seem to emphasize once
again the distinction that much of the mid
die- and upper-classes draw between us
and them, the educated and the ignorant,
the "scholars" and the "rioters."
We need to stop making this distinc
tion. Instead of condemning the rioters,
the Stanford population needs to under
stand why they rioted, and see that fun
damentally, we all share the potential to
act on our fury.
Most importantly, we need to stop
misdirecting this anger. Given the social
climate, isn't it obvious that the
Copeland's management is guilty of, at
most, paranoia? Come on, there are
more important battles to be won.

Atrocities against all
groups must be halted
The events of the past week have
struck me very deeply both personally
and politically. Although I do not con
done the violence of many, I understand
the emotions that have incited such rage.
I know that it is disempowering to see
your brothers and sisters, and sometimes
yourself, trod upon, by mainstream soci
ety. I join this struggle for tolerance
because this is not a battle for African-
American men, but a battle for humani
ty.
From you beside me at the marches
or at the teach-in or in spirit, I ask for
consistency. As a lesbian, it is difficult to
comprehend the intolerance that has
allowed a legal system guaranteeing me
no rights and no recourse.
And it is still hard for me to under
stand how my fellow students could have
told me earlier this year that I should not
have made myself heard at the Pete Wil
son rally and that the battle for my free
doms is still one that I (gays, lesbians and
bisexuals) will have to fight largely alone.

I was, and still remain, enraged by
"the system" that failed me by denying
me the right to employment and housing
despite the reported support of two
thirds of California residents. We must
realize that the oppression of any peo
ples is an atrocity that we must fight,
that we must not tolerate.
As we are in the midst of Bisexual, Gay
and Lesbian Awareness Days (BGLAD), I
invite you to learn about and celebrate my
culture and my struggle. If understanding
is too much to ask, then please just let me
live (e.g. stop defacing the posters).
Until we realize that the physical or
psychological beating of any person is
equally despicable, we cannot hope to
live together peacefully.

Anger directed toward
Copeland's is ludicrous
If I have correctly understood the arti
cle on the'front page of Monday's Daily, a
boycott of Copeland's Sports in Palo Alto
has been called for because that shop's

windows were boarded up in preparation
for the huge protest on rally on Friday.
Apparently, people felt that this action
was "an insult to students," and deserves
to be countered with a boycott.
For days, the papers have been full of
stories about unbelievable anarchy and vio
lence all over the nation. If I were to put
down that morning's Chronicle and then
discover that a huge group of protesters
would be approaching my store, well
SURE, I'd board up my windows in a flash.
C'mon folks, we've all read the papers
in the last year. Stanford students have
been arrested for assaulting people and
for robbery. Just because someone is a
Stanford student doesn't necessarily
mean he or she gets to wear a halo.
Furthermore, according to the account
in The Daily, not everyone in the crowd
was a student. Therefore, even if all Stan
ford students DID wear halos, someone
could have still started throwing bricks.
Recall that the divestment protests at
UC-Berkeley in the mid '80s turned into
riots when the townsfolk got involved.
That could have been Copeland's Sports.
The folks at Copeland's Sports did not
beat Rodney King, nor did they make that
verdict. Like the rest of us, they've most

likely seen the results of other protest ral
lies during the last few days.
To be angry at the store owner
because the owner wanted to protect his
property from possible harm is ludi
crous, and to angrily demand a boycott
of that store is irresponsible at best.

Call for boycotting of
Copeland's is baffling
While my reaction to the Rodney King
trial verdict is one of unequivocal dis
gust, 1 am baffled by Greg Ricks' call for
a boycott of Copeland's — the only store
to board its windows in preparation for
Stanford's protest march on Friday.
"We're not rioters," Ricks said, "we're
scholars." To make this distinction
between the Stanford community and
those who participated in the riots
throughout the country seems not only
to be rather haughty, but paradoxical
given the context of our march.
Wasn't Stanford marching not only to
show outrage over the verdict, but to

express empathy and solidarity with those
who have experienced police brutality and
racist mistreatment most directly?
It is for these people, who now feel so
utterly abandoned and voiceless, that
riot becomes the only outlet for their
anger. Indeed, it seems to be one of the
only ways they feel they can make them
selves heard by this nation.
While Ricks says that the violence of the
Los Angeles rioters "is understandable,"
his comments seem to emphasize once
again the distinction that much of the mid
die- and upper-classes draw between us
and them, the educated and the ignorant,
the "scholars" and the "rioters."
We need to stop making this distinc
tion. Instead of condemning the rioters,
the Stanford population needs to under
stand why they rioted, and see that fun
damentally, we all share the potential to
act on our fury.
Most importantly, we need to stop
misdirecting this anger. Given the social
climate, isn't it obvious that the
Copeland's management is guilty of, at
most, paranoia? Come on, there are
more important battles to be won.
