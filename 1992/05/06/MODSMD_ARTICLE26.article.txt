## IM Sociologist says students are hacks 
### 
As an intramural referee
the past four years, I've
studied the bizarre inter
action of Stanford students
competing on the IM fields.
After calling fouls on most of
the student body, I've reached
a well-researched conclusion:
you 're all a bunch of hacks.
For a terrifying foreshadow-

ing of how Stanford students
will behave in the real world,
watch an IM basketball playoff
game. Given the opportunity,
most ax-wielding, foul-happy,
Tom Tolbert-loving students
will hack to win. When caught,
they whine, retreat with a
legalistic "I know the rules bet
ter than you" response, and
whine some more. I've called so
many fouls in four years, the
entire University should be
tossed out of the game. The
highlights of my hack research:
Highest Hacks: As one might
expect, business school stu
dents are the worst. It doesn't
matter how many ethics cours
es they are forced to take, busi
ness students will do anything
to win, whether the competi
tion is IM basketball or a lever
aged buyout. True "Barbarians
in the Paint."
The first course at the busi
ness school must be Aggravat
ed Assault 101, taught by visit
ing professor Bobby Knight.
Pit the barracuda business
school against a minnow-like
Stanford singing group and
there will be a guaranteed
blood-bath on the IM fields.

Biggest HackfestiThe busi
ness school "Challenge for
Charity." Every spring business
schools from the West Coast
send their top goons to Stanford
to compete in various athletic
games. Instead of football, soft
ball and basketball, they should
compete in the kidney punch
and the cleat-to-groin challenge.
The theme: "Everything is legal
unless you get caught."
Biggest Hack (single game):
Bowling ball linebacker Coy
Gibbs threw two players into
the stands, strangled a third
and fouled out in less than five
minutes of an IM basketball
game played for his freshman
dorm. Runner-up: women's
basketball manager and sensi
tive guy Art Romero has, for
some reason, developed a frot
teuristic tendency to reach in
at all times.
Best Insults: It's really
refreshing how every losing
team thinks the referee is hor
rible, and the winning team
thinks the officiating was per
fect. No matter how long I ref,
I will always have a 50 percent
approval rating. Fortunately, I
frequently referee games when
players from both teams agree
that "You suck, ref," assuring
me that in reality I've probably
done a good job.
I never tire of the classic
intellectual insults "You suck,
you're blind," or "You're blind
and you suck." However, my
favorite insults accuse me of
racism, regionalism, sexism or
some other -ism that I don't
have time to learn on my $6.50-
a-game salary.
Although I've previously
agreed that White Men Can't
Jump, I don't support affirma
tive action officiating and
assume that all individuals were
born to hack. After all, I was.

Nat Cousins is a senior and the
IM Director, so he can never
foul out.
