# Attitude is everything for Willens
## Confidence equals success for Cardinal's top singles player 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
It looks like two furry rodents
exploded on Heather Willens'
feet. But those are just her shoes.
"I know they're the most
hideous things in the world, but
in a way I kiiid of like that," she
said while glancing down at the
black suede sneakers splashed
with fuchsia and violet. "They're
not your ordinary shoe and no
one else wears them. I know
they're ugly and I like it."
Flashy footwear is only one
characteristic that separates Wil
lens from the rest of the collegiate
tennis field. The junior from Los
Angeles also has an unusual atti
tude about playing No. 1 for the
six-time defending national
champions.
Some players would be intimi
dated by the prospect of filling
the shoes of Cardinal greats like
Patty Fendick, Tami Whitlinger
and Sandra Birch. Willens saw it
as a challenge.
"People who came out to
watch at the beginning of the
year probably said, 'Oh, God.
Heather Willens playing No. 1.
She won't live up to Sandra,"' she
said. "I like that. I like to prove
people wrong. It's one of my
favorite things. I didn't take it as
pressure. I took it and threw it in
their face.
"In a way, I like the fact that
I'm not like [past No. l's]. People
used to watch them and say 'Oh,
Sandra looks so good.' I like it
that they watch me play and I'm
not a good-looking player. All I do
is scrap. Because of that I don't
feel any pressure to follow in
their footsteps."

But as a former bottom-of-the
lineup player, Willens acknowl
edges the difference between
being a team's caboose and its
engine.
"When I played No. 4,1 always
looked to the No. 1 court," she
said. "It is kind of a moral leader
thing. There's more pressure but
I know that even if I don't win,
other people are going to pull
some matches out."
And with the greater pressure
also came better opponents.
"When I played No. 6, I had
maybe three really tough dual
matches all year," Willens said.
"At No. 4, maybe seven. I'm not
saying that in a cocky way, but
now there's not one match that
isn't tough."
The up side, of course, is the
confidence that winning tight
matches brings. Willens' 19 victo
ries in 22 dual matches have
translated to a greater belief in
her abilities.
"I feel like I have a chance
against every player," said Wil
lens who's ranked No. 3 national
ly. "Whereas maybe before I was
like, 'Oh, (No. 1) Shannan
McCarthy or (No. 2) Lisa Ray
mond. No way, I can't play with
them.' Now, I feel like I'm even.
"I think its all just a confi
dence thing, I really do. Every
one's so even out there that it's
just those people who have the
mind for it who are going to do
it."
True to her words, Willens has
spent most of the past year work
ing on mental aspects of her
game. As her concentration has
improved, so has her consistency.

Heather Widens (and her shoes) have been leading the Cardinal all
season long. Widens, a junior from Los Angeles, has stepped in to
the No. 1 singles spot to play a big role in Stanford's success this
year. Her record is 19-3 in dual matches.
U I think a lot more now than I
used to," she said. "Placement of
shots is a big part of my game. I
think on each shot, where this
one is going.
"Before, I sometimes slipped
into these times where I didn't
really have a game plan. Maybe I
was going for winners or just
being dumb. Now I feel like I
work the point."
While this has enabled her to
compete with the best in the col
lege ranks, there are still players
who give her trouble.
"The ones who really push me
back on the baseline can hurt
me," Willens said. "Ones who hit
really deep, like Kristine Kurth.
"If they hit me deep to my
backhand, I feel OK. But now

everyone knows to hit to my fore
hand. If they're pushing me back
on my forehand, I'm hitting them
shorter and shorter.
"I really feel like I have to
totally revamp my forehand —
not now but at some point. That's
the only way I'm going to beat
those people. If I play pros, I'm
going to get with my coach and
just totally change it. I feel like its
holding me back from getting to
the next level."
Is this an indication Willens is
considering bypassing her senior
year for the professional tour?
"Turn pro early? Never," she
said. "That's never been me. It
sounds so cliche but education
has always been important to me.
It's one thing if you're Debbie
Graham, someone who is going to
make it. But I know I'll never be
top 20 in the world so I've got to
get a degree so I can get a job."
But the idea of making a living

by playing tennis appeals to Wil
lens. She relishes the singularity of
the sport, that she depends on no
one else in a match except herself.

'But when it comes
down to match point, I
want it to be me.'

"I'm a control freak," she said.
"I like having control of every sit
uation I'm in. I always said I
don't think I could stand to be on
a basketball team. I know the
plusses of it are that its such a
good feeling when you work
together and win.
"But when it comes down to
match point, I want it to be me.
That's not to say that I'd always do

well, but I want to know I did it."
Because Willens is such an
individualist it may come as a sur
prise that what has given her the
greatest satisfaction this year has
been the team's success.
The Cardinal began the season
slotted at No. 5, the lowest the
squad's been ranked in years.
Many skeptics pointed to the loss
of three All-Americans and the
youth of the 1992 squad as signs
that Stanford would struggle.
But the squad has gone 20-2
and nearly beat No. 1 Florida in
the finals of the National Indoor
Championships. As hosts of the
1992 NCAA tournament, Stanford
has to be considered one of the top
contenders for the team title.
"That was the fun of this
year," Willens said. "We got to
say, 'in your face' to everyone.
But it will not truly be in your
face until we win the national
championship."
