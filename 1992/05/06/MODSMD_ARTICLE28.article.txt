# Attitude is everything for Willens
## Confidence equals success for Cardinal's top singles player 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
It looks like two furry rodents
exploded on Heather Willens'
feet. But those are just her shoes.
"I know they're the most
hideous things in the world, but
in a way I kiiid of like that," she
said while glancing down at the
black suede sneakers splashed
with fuchsia and violet. "They're
not your ordinary shoe and no
one else wears them. I know
they're ugly and I like it."
Flashy footwear is only one
characteristic that separates Wil
lens from the rest of the collegiate
tennis field. The junior from Los
Angeles also has an unusual atti
tude about playing No. 1 for the
six-time defending national
champions.
Some players would be intimi
dated by the prospect of filling
the shoes of Cardinal greats like
Patty Fendick, Tami Whitlinger
and Sandra Birch. Willens saw it
as a challenge.
"People who came out to
watch at the beginning of the
year probably said, 'Oh, God.
Heather Willens playing No. 1.
She won't live up to Sandra,"' she
said. "I like that. I like to prove
people wrong. It's one of my
favorite things. I didn't take it as
pressure. I took it and threw it in
their face.
"In a way, I like the fact that
I'm not like [past No. l's]. People
used to watch them and say 'Oh,
Sandra looks so good.' I like it
that they watch me play and I'm
not a good-looking player. All I do
is scrap. Because of that I don't
feel any pressure to follow in
their footsteps."

But as a former bottom-of-the
lineup player, Willens acknowl
edges the difference between
being a team's caboose and its
engine.
"When I played No. 4,1 always
looked to the No. 1 court," she
said. "It is kind of a moral leader
thing. There's more pressure but
I know that even if I don't win,
other people are going to pull
some matches out."
And with the greater pressure
also came better opponents.
"When I played No. 6, I had
maybe three really tough dual
matches all year," Willens said.
"At No. 4, maybe seven. I'm not
saying that in a cocky way, but
now there's not one match that
isn't tough."
The up side, of course, is the
confidence that winning tight
matches brings. Willens' 19 victo
ries in 22 dual matches have
translated to a greater belief in
her abilities.
"I feel like I have a chance
against every player," said Wil
lens who's ranked No. 3 national
ly. "Whereas maybe before I was
like, 'Oh, (No. 1) Shannan
McCarthy or (No. 2) Lisa Ray
mond. No way, I can't play with
them.' Now, I feel like I'm even.
"I think its all just a confi
dence thing, I really do. Every
one's so even out there that it's
just those people who have the
mind for it who are going to do
it."
True to her words, Willens has
spent most of the past year work
ing on mental aspects of her
game. As her concentration has
improved, so has her consistency.
