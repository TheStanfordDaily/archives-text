# Sailors reach one goal, just miss another
## 
### Brian Border 
After a long weekend in Berkeley sprinkled
with both highs and lows, the Stanford sailing
team could not help but feel both satisfaction
and frustration with the way things turned
out. At the Pacific Coast Championships the
Cardinal achieved one of its goals by qualify
ing for the Team Race Nationals, and the
squad just missed fulfilling its other ambition
of earning a spot in the Dinghy Nationals.
The weekend began well for the sailors as
they captured second place in the team racing
event Friday. By finishing in the top two,
Stanford received a bid for Nationals for the
seventh straight year.
The Cardinal earned praise from Coach
Blake Middleton as they won eight of their 12
head-to-head races to edge out the third place
Hawaii team and the California team, which
finished fourth.
"I was really pleased with our perfor
mance," he said. "We had struggled in team
racing earlier in the year so I wasn't sure
where we stood."
Stanford's success could be attributed to a
combined team effort by the three Cardinal
boats. Led by skippers Charles Meade, Scott
Sellers, and Matt Sanford, along with five dif
ferent crews, they sailed impressively to hold

off their five other opponents. Even more
exciting was the fact that they were the only
team in the regatta to defeat eventual cham
pion UC-Irvine in any of the races.

'Two weeks ago I didn't know
what to expect from the team,
and to get to compete in two of
the three Nationals is a great
success/
â€” coach Middleton

Matters took a turn for the worse Saturday
and Sunday. In the two-day dinghy regatta
Stanford began slowly, and as a result they
could never catch up to the squads from UC-
Irvine and Hawaii.
According to Middleton, "We started off
very poorly on Saturday morning, and we dug
ourselves into a huge hole."
Nevertheless, the Cardinal managed a
third-place finish overall as they relied on a
large number of sailors to pull them through
in both divisions of the race.

In the A division Meade and Sellers alter
nated as skipper and they were aided by crews
Katherine Chen, Andi Guerrero, Geoff
McDonald, Jeremy Mclntyre, and John
Emory. Sanford and Mclntyre skippered in
the B division, and their crews consisted of *
Kristen Sidell, Anne Luetkemeyer, and Rusty
Lhamon.
Though Middleton has never before used so
many team members in one regatta, his strat
egy helped Stanford remain in contention.
"I think it worked to our advantage to uti
lize so many sailors who are all capable of per
forming well," Lhamon said. "We just weren't
able to pull it together at the end."
Sellers added, "It was frustrating because
we were so close but we were unable to reach
our goal."
However, after qualifying for the Team
Race Nationals Friday and for the Women's
Nationals a week ago, the Stanford sailing
team has nothing about which to be ashamed.
"Two weeks ago I didn't know what to
expect from the team, and to get to compete in
two of the three Nationals is a great success,"
Middleton said.
The Cardinal will now spend the next three
weeks training for the two national regattas
which take place at the College of Charleston
during the first 10 days of June.
