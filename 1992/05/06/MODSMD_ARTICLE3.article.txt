# Victim: 'I'm not scared anymore, I'm just angry'
## 
### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
One target of an obscene caller says she's fin
ished being frightened and is ready to speak out
about the harassment that gives her nightmares.
"I'm not scared anymore, I'm just angry," said
Griselda Silva, a Ph.D. candidate in Education
who has received several explicit calls since per
forming a stand-up comedy routine at El Centro
Chicano April 3.
As "Griselda la Terrible" — Silva's stage per
sona — she jokingly remarked, "Look me up in the
directory. I'm available." It was after this the
phone calls started.
"I guess someone took that line very serious
ly," said Silva. "[A caller] said, 'You know who
this is. It's one of your secret
admirers' and made references
to my act.
He obviously knew who I
was. Can't people distinguish
between me and my charac
ter?"
Last week, she received four
"heavy-breather-type calls" in
the middle of the night.
She filed a complaint with the
police after these calls because
she said she didn't want to go on
being a victim.
Silva said the calls and the
recent verdict in the Rodney
King trial have re-awakened a lot
of pain she has suffered as a
minority woman.
As a result of the calls, she has
had nightmares and has missed
classes due to lack of sleep.
"I use comedy as a therapy

and I try to laugh about being a
minority and the stresses we go
through, and now even that's
being taken away from me," said
Silva.
"For women, it's a real feeling
of invasion."
The harassing calls are just
the latest form of the victimiza
tion Silva said she has experi
enced throughout her life,
including denigration, date
rape, domestic abuse, sexual
harassment and police brutali
ty-
"l don't feel I'm unique, and
that's why I'm speaking out,"
said Silva.
"If all this has happened to
me, how many others has it hap
pened to?"
Silva said she intends to con
tinue her act, despite the calls.
"I briefly considered not
doing my act anymore, but then
I said, 'Hell, no. Why should I
let someone else dictate my
life?'
