# Close shaves: Fist-pumping Devens masters three-set matches
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
If there is one thing that tennis player
Rob Devens does really well, it is to dig
out point after point, and win after win,
in excruciatingly close matches.
Despite often losing his concentration
(and his lead), the sophomore scrapper
always manages to finish on top.
"What impresses me most in matches
is that when he gets down, he's figured
out how to win matches," said assistant
coach John Whitlinger.
While most of his No. 4 and 5 singles
matches drag to three sets, Devens and
doubles partner Michael Flanagan have
little trouble closing in for the win. Their
winning ways have produced an unde
feated 24-0 season for the pair.
"Michael's attitude is that you can
never let the other team get back into the
match," Devens expained. "I tend to get
up a break and relax, so he really keeps
me on my toes."
Both players show their emotions on
the court, but Devens has been trying to
curb his feelings. "I like to get pumped up
on the court but I'm not as bad as
Michael," Devens said with a chuckle.
"(Alex O'Brien) says we're the fist-pump
ing team. I just want to win so bad that
sometimes it's hard to keep my frustra
tions inside. I was a lot worse in Juniors
though, but since I've been at Stanford
I've been working on that a lot."
The New York City native played
indoors for nine months of the year, mov
ing outdoors in the summer. He ran into
most of his current teammates on the
junior circuit.
"We all grew up playing each other a
lot," he said. "It's a different situation
now because we're rooting for each other.
I've become much better friends with

them than I ever thought I'd be when I
was in Juniors, screaming at them over
line calls and stuff."
Although his parents dutifully trav
elled with him when he was younger, they
never thought of tennis as the top priori
ty, which Devens is thankful for.
"My parents have been great —
they're happy that I'm doing it but when
I go home, there is never any talk about
it,"he said. "When we talk on the phone
the first question is always 'How are
classes going?' Sometimes they even for
get to ask if I've been winning my match
es. It's kind of a relief because there's so
much pressure here that I really don't
need it there too."
When the on-court pressure becomes
too much and he gets worked up, Devens
usually turns to co-captain Jason Yee,
who plays in the sixth spot.
"It's been fun playing next to Jason
every match because he's kind of loose
and calm," he said. "I look over at him
and he's just so relaxed."
For the squad of sophomores, having
seniors Yee and O'Brien around has been a
great help. With NCAAs around the corner,
the inexperienced underclassmen need all
the leadership their captains can provide.
"Everyone gets excited and Jason and
Alex are always there to say 'Relax, calm
down, let the othei guy get cocky and you
only do it once you win," Devens explained.
Devens' constant desire to learn and
improve impresses his coaches as well.
"He's the kind of guy you love to
coach," said head coach Dick Gould.
Whitlinger echoed these sentiments:
"From where he was last year to here shows
tremendous improvement. He's a great guy
to be around — he listens well and works
hard. He does everything you ask him to,


' Robert Devens has a firm grasp on the game of tennis. Devens has become a valuable part of the Cardinal team this year as
« he and doubles partner Michael Flanagan have gone undefeated (24-0) this year and he has contributed at the fourth and fifth
- singles spot.
even more sometimes."
This year, the coaches have been
focusing on Devens' serve. His
weak second serve has made him
vulnerable in the past and allowed
his opponents to dictate the pace of
the game. However, long hours
with a basket of balls have
improved his serve substantially.'
"When my serve is on, I think
my whole game makes a big
jump," Devens said. "I'm going to
keep working on it over the next
two weeks so that come NCAAs,
when I get nervous others can't
take advantage of my shots."
Devens does not want to specu
late too much on the Cardinal's
chances of clinching the national
title. Rather, he wants to focus on
one tournament match at a time
in his first NCAA competition.

"I'm kind of excited but not too
nervous," he said. M I think we
have a chance to do well if we keep
focused. If we stick together as a
team, which we're good at doing,
and concentrate on one match at a
time we should be okay. We can't
get caught up in the hoopla of the
whole thing.
"All year Coach has stressed
that we've got to keep improving
and improving and hopefully we'll
catch [UCLA and USC]. Now
we're out of time so NCAAs will
show the results."
Coach Whitlinger is not con
cerned about Devens' ability to
perform in Georgia.
"I'm sure there'll be butterflies
but he'll do fme. He's played in
every match this season and come
through for us."
If Devens keeps up his winning
ways, he may just come back from
his first NCAA tournament as a
national champion.
