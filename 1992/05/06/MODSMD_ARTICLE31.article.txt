## Hunger causes no noise Tummy growls are sounds of internal flatulence 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
Q:Why do tummies growl when
we're hungry?
W
A:l'm glad you asked. What's more,
I'm glad you asked the question in
the way that you did.
If you'd said that the upper gastroin
testinal tract growls because we're hun
gry, I would have had to verbally abuse
you for assuming a causal connection
between two events just because they hap
pen at the same time.
(This would be a big logical fallacy. If
you don't believe me, start moaning and
panting, "Yes, yes, yes!" and wait for your
self to come. You would be frustrated
because you would have confused correla
tion with causation. Admittedly, the world
would be a wonderful place if things were
otherwise, but hey — I just work here.)
In fact, stomach growling (or "borbo
rygmus," to those in the know — a Balder
dash™ word if I ever heard one) is not a
response to hunger, although the two phe
nomena do have some causes in common.
To make this oblique connection a bit less
opaque, allow me to prattle for a few inch
es on the subject of hunger itself.
What do we mean when you say that
we're hungry? In the loosest sense, we
mean that we need or want to eat. But how
do we know that we want to eat? If you're
a normal human being, your answer will
be something like, "Well, I know I'm hun
gry when my tummy feels empty." True,
but that's only part of the story.
There is a portion of your brain, called
the hypothalamus, which (among count
less other tasks) monitors the level of the
simple sugar glucose in your blood. Since
glucose is the intercellular energy curren
cy in your body, blood glucose levels are a
pretty good index of whether you need to
stuff your face in order to continue func
tioning at an optimum level.
If the hypothalamus detects low glucose
(along with a few other chemical cues), it
will begin to tell the rest of your body that
you're hungry. Thus, the sharp pangs that
you associate with an empty belly are due
more to brain activity than to any other
physiological factor.
Dr. Edward Paul, a shrink from the
Cornell University Medical Center, tells
me that brain-mediated hunger can even
arise when you're not hungry. Hunger
pangs can develop in a person who has, for
example, worked themselves into a high
emotional pitch over missing a loved one.
But enough about the mental basis of
hunger; I promised you an explanation of
borborygmus.
There is a primitive nervous system in

your digestive tract. Under normal circum
stances, it serves to coordinate the wave
like contractions of intestinal muscle that
transport foodstuffs along the alimentary
canal — a process known as peristalsis.
Peristalsis is largely involuntary, so
from the time you shove breakfast down
the hatch to the time that it reaches your
colon, you don't have to think about what
your body is doing to your food. (Merciful
ly, after what's left of breakfast hits the
colon and rectum, you regain control of
the contractions.)
The digestive nervous system also has
stretch receptors, which get turned on
when their local region of the alimentary
canal is distended. Through a complex
series of inhibitions and excitations, the
triggering of stretch receptors causes con
traction of upstream muscles and relax
ation of downstream muscles — resulting
in a smooth, directional flow of partly
digested food from the stomach, through
the intestine and on to San Francisco Bay.
When your blood sugar is low it is gen
erally the case that your stomach and
upper small intestine are empty.
Even though the stretch receptors
aren't firing, however, there is nonethe
less some residual peristaltic activity in
these portions of the digestive tract. Since
there's no food to push around, this low
level peristalsis can only move the air that
entered your stomach when you swal
lowed your last meal.
As the air is forced through the opening
that connects stomach to small intestine,
it makes the characteristic sound of any
sort of gas being forced through a sphinc
ter muscle — a kind of internal flatulence.

questions for him into the Bug Box, locat

because you would have confused correla
tion with causation. Admittedly, the world
would be a wonderful place if things were
otherwise, but hey — I just work here.)
In fact, stomach growling (or "borbo
rygmus," to those in the know — a Balder
dash™ word if I ever heard one) is not a
response to hunger, although the two phe
nomena do have some causes in common.
To make this oblique connection a bit less
opaque, allow me to prattle for a few inch
es on the subject of hunger itself.
What do we mean when you say that
we're hungry? In the loosest sense, we
mean that we need or want to eat. But how
do we know that we want to eat? If you're
a normal human being, your answer will
be something like, "Well, I know I'm hun
gry when my tummy feels empty." True,
but that's only part of the story.
There is a portion of your brain, called
the hypothalamus, which (among count
less other tasks) monitors the level of the
simple sugar glucose in your blood. Since
glucose is the intercellular energy curren
cy in your body, blood glucose levels are a
pretty good index of whether you need to
stuff your face in order to continue func
tioning at an optimum level.
If the hypothalamus detects low glucose
(along with a few other chemical cues), it
will begin to tell the rest of your body that
you're hungry. Thus, the sharp pangs that
you associate with an empty belly are due
more to brain activity than to any other
physiological factor.
Dr. Edward Paul, a shrink from the
Cornell University Medical Center, tells
me that brain-mediated hunger can even
arise when you're not hungry. Hunger
pangs can develop in a person who has, for
example, worked themselves into a high
emotional pitch over missing a loved one.
But enough about the mental basis of
hunger; I promised you an explanation of
borborygmus.
There is a primitive nervous system in

your digestive tract. Under normal circum
stances, it serves to coordinate the wave
like contractions of intestinal muscle that
transport foodstuffs along the alimentary
canal — a process known as peristalsis.
Peristalsis is largely involuntary, so
from the time you shove breakfast down
the hatch to the time that it reaches your
colon, you don't have to think about what
your body is doing to your food. (Merciful
ly, after what's left of breakfast hits the
colon and rectum, you regain control of
the contractions.)
The digestive nervous system also has
stretch receptors, which get turned on
when their local region of the alimentary
canal is distended. Through a complex
series of inhibitions and excitations, the
triggering of stretch receptors causes con
traction of upstream muscles and relax
ation of downstream muscles — resulting
in a smooth, directional flow of partly
digested food from the stomach, through
the intestine and on to San Francisco Bay.
When your blood sugar is low it is gen
erally the case that your stomach and
upper small intestine are empty.
Even though the stretch receptors
aren't firing, however, there is nonethe
less some residual peristaltic activity in
these portions of the digestive tract. Since
there's no food to push around, this low
level peristalsis can only move the air that
entered your stomach when you swal
lowed your last meal.
As the air is forced through the opening
that connects stomach to small intestine,
it makes the characteristic sound of any
sort of gas being forced through a sphinc
ter muscle — a kind of internal flatulence.
