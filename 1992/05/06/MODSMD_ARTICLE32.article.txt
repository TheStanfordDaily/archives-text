# Doctors use physics to look at arteries

Researchers at Stanford and across
the country are about to perfect a new
and improved method of imaging coro
nary arteries.
The process will combat heart
attacks, the most common cause of death
in developed countries, using syn
chrotron beams that are much more
effective than conventional x-rays,
according to Stanford Medical Center
researcher Edward Rubenstein.
Heart attacks are caused when fat
deposits clog the arteries — a condition
called athersclerosis. Physicians can
attempt to treat the condition by making
x-ray images of the sites where arteries
are narrowed or blocked.
Currently, a small plastic tube is insert
ed into a peripheral artery at the groin,
arm or neck, and guided through to the
opening of the coronary arteries. A con
trast medium that will show up on x-rays,
such as iodine, is injected via the catheter.
This rather invasive technique carries
certain risks, including damage and
blockage of blood vessels. About 1 per
cent of patients who undergo this proce
dure have complications ranging from
localized bleeding to strokes. These com

plications are fatal for about 0.1 to 0.4
percent of patients.
Rubenstein, along with colleagues here
and at UC-Berkeley and Brookhaven Lab
oratory, have been working to perfect a
less risky process of imaging blood ves
sels using high-tech physics.
Synchrotron-based angiography
involves a highly sensitive synchrotron
beam. Unlike conventional x-rays, this
beam can detect the contrast medium
even if it is injected intravenously and
diluted into the blood system — instead
of directly into the coronary artery.
The primary advantage of this
method, Rubenstein said, is that it dis
penses with the need for a catheter. It
also subjects the patient to considerably
less radiation.
Synchrotron beams are used in con
junction with an existing method called
digital subtraction angiography, a pro
cess that uses computer technology to
process digital data and subtract
unwanted background information, leav
ing only an image of the blood vessels.
Under the conventional method of dig
ital subtraction, x-rays are taken before
and after the contrast medium is intro
duced, and the two x-rays are compared.
However, since the coronary arteries
move with the beating of the heart, the

two images do not directly superimpose,
resulting in poorer images, according to
Rubenstein.
Taking two images simultaneously,
part of a principle called dichromogra
phy, has been around since 1979, but it
was an unrealized idea until x-rays of
single energies were developed.
Synchrotron beam x-rays are generat
ed by whirling electrons at close to the
speed of light in a particle accelerator
storage ring. The energy lost when the
electrons slow down in the curves mani
fests in parallel rays that can be tuned to
any wavelength.
The two x-ray beams required for digital
subtraction are produced by passing the
beam through crystals that diffract all but
the desired wavelengths, Rubenstein said.
Every element only absorbs x-rays of
a particular wavelength. One wavelength
is set to correspond to the contrast medi
um, and the other is not; one wavelength
is absorbed by the contrast medium, the
other by the body tissues.
After the contrast medium is injected
and allowed to circulate, the two pictures
are taken simultaneously. When the sec
ond is subtracted from the first, the
image of the contrast medium in the
arteries is left and any obstruction is
revealed clearly.
