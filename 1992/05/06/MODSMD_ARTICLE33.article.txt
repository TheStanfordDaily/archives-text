# Researchers clean water with bacteria
## Scientists at environmental research center join forces to fight pollution

The news is both hopeful and grim from
the Stanford-based Western Region Haz
ardous Substance Research Center, one of five
centers established by the Environmental
Protection Agency to address the nationwide
problem of hazardous contaminants.
The good news is that scientists are hopeful
that existing pollution may be abated through
the use of natural, biological processes. How
ever, some areas have been contaminated
beyond repair.
"There's going to be a limitation on the
extent to which we can clean up," said Civil
Engineering Prof. Perry McCarty, director of
the center that brings together scientists from
Stanford and Oregon State University to
focus on cleaning up polluted groundwater.
"The real lesson from all of that is that we
have to prevent the contamination rather
than let it occur. It's very expensive after it
happens," he said.
The University of Tennessee recently esti
mated it would cost between $600 billion and
$1.3 trillion over the next 30 years to clean up
the Superfund sites, which make up more
than 1,000 of the most severely polluted areas
nationwide.
"Even considering all the processes avail
able, we will probably find that a lot of con
tamination we'll be unable to move, no matter
how much we spend," McCarty said.
The contamination of groundwater is a
major problem throughout the country,
according to McCarty. Current groundwater
problems include the seepage of hazardous
chemicals from unlined dumps, leaking stor
age tanks and accidental spills.
"There 1s pollution in many locations," he
said. "In many places the pollution has seeped
down into the soil and contaminated ground
water."
Most of the pollution stems from unen
lightened waste disposal practices from the
past. Many of the Superfund sites were pollut
ed during the years following World War 11,
when the country brimmed with industry,
McCarty explained.
"A lot of synthetic chemicals were made
and there was a broader use of chemicals," he
said. In addition, more land was available for
dumping since the human population was
smaller.
"Now as we develop more and try to build
new cities and schools, these old sites become

places where people want to live, and many
people need to use the groundwater," McCar
ty said. "As we move, the places that once
weren't too harmful are now very harmful."
Groundwater comprises 40 percent of the
drinking water in the United States and is
used heavily in Santa Clara County. Stanford
used groundwater last year, and the city of
Palo Alto is considering switching to it
because of the drought, McCarty said.

'The real lesson from all of
that is that we have to pre
vent the contamination
rather than let it occur.'

The primary group of chemicals targeted
by the center are chlorinated solvents, which
were once widely used for cleaning engines,
aircraft and clothes. "When people have got
ten done with these dirty solvents they would
often just throw them away in dumps and
lagoons," McCarty said. "They've been leech
ing into groundwater ever since."
The center is also addressing another
group of compounds — aeromatic hydrocar
bons. These compounds result largely from
petroleum products, such as gasoline.
Aeromatic hydrocarbons are the soluble
components in gasoline. When gasoline leak
ing from a tank reaches the groundwater,
these chemicals dissolve and are carried away
in the stream.
The chemicals are difficult to reach because
they have seeped so deeply into the ground,
McCarty said. They also tend to absorb onto
the soils, preventing scientists from removing
the contaminants by pumping groundwater
up to the surface.
"The problems are very difficult to
address," he said. "We're finding it's a much
more complex problem than was originally
thought."
McCarty's specialty, and one of the focuses
of the center, is bioremediation — the use of
microorganisms to destroy pollutants.
"We've found that many of the hazardous
chemicals can be destroyed by microorganisms
that are found in groundwaters and soils,"

McCarty said. "We're trying to understand
how they destroy the compounds and how we
might use these microorganisms better to
destroy the components more efficiently."
Some microorganisms feed on the haz
ardous compounds, using them for energy and
growth. Often these microorganisms will
transform the hazardous material into some
thing more benign.
"In so many processes we just move the
contaminants from one place to another,"
McCarty said. "The advantage of microorgan
isms is that they destroy the wastes and con
taminants."
The microorganism that does the initial
transformation may not be able to use the
product, but can usually convert the com
pound into something another animal can use.
"We find it takes communities of organ
isms working together to break compounds
down," McCarty said.
Researchers at the center are attempting to
use bioremediation at St. Joseph, a Superfund
site in Michigan where there are large concen
trations of trichloroethlyene (TCE) and vinyl
chloride in the groundwater.
One set of bacteria break down the TCE
into vinyl chloride, and another set of bacteria
destroy the vinyl chloride, converting it into
harmless products.
"We probably won't be able to clean up all
the contamination to the extent that people
would hope," McCarty said. "This microbio
logical process that we're looking at is just one
process of many that need to be applied."
"Many would like it to be contaminant-free
— but we're saying that in many cases we
don't have the technology to do that," he said.
"We can prevent migration of chemicals, we
can clean up to a certain extent, improve the
contamination greatly, but it's another thing
to eliminate it."
Bioremediation destroys contaminants and
is a natural process.
"We're hoping that it will help in the solu
tion to this problem, but it's not going to be a
panacea," McCarty said. "It has a role and
we're finding what that role will be."
One pleasant surprise is that many haz
ardous chemicals are degrading biologically on
their own over time. "We're trying to under
stand that process better. It may be that in
some locations we don't have to do anything,"
McCarty said.
For example, a fairly sizeable portion of the
trichloroethlyene has disappeared biologically
from the St. Joseph site, he said.
