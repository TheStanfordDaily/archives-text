Don't microwave breast milk
A recent study by Stanford researchers shows that microwav
ing human milk, even at a low setting, can destroy some of its
important disease-fighting capabilities.
Breast-feeding mothers who work outside the home often store
breast milk for feedings when they are away. Using the
microwave to rewarm this milk may be harmful, according to the
study.
Previous studies have shown that heating milk well above
body temperature can break down its antibodies to infectious
agents as well as its lysozymes, or bacteria-digesting enzymes.
In the April issue of Pediatrics, Stanford pediatrician John
Kerner, Jr. and his research team found that compared to
unheated breast milk, microwaved milk lost lysozyme activity,
lost antibodies and fostered the growth of more potentially dis
ease-causing bacteria.
Microwave heating is inherently uneven, and using a
microwave to thaw milk is an especially bad idea since it is likely
to boil some parts of the milk before other parts have liquified.
Stanford Medical Center no longer microwaves any breast
milk.
Three profs join national academy
Three Stanford professors were among 59 scholars elected to
the National Academy of Sciences on Tuesday.
The new Stanford members are Hans C. Andersen, professor
of chemistry and deputy director of the Stanford Center for
Materials Research; George A. Thompson, professor of geo
physics; and Peter M. Vitousek, professor of biological sciences.
The National Academy of Sciences is a private organization of
scientists and engineers dedicated to the furtherance of science
and its use for the general welfare.
Of the 1,651 academy members, 90 are from Stanford and
another four are affiliated with the Hoover Institution.
Doctors study light-activated compounds
Researchers at the Medical School have received a state grant
to transfer the use of light-activated compounds from the labora
tory to the clinic.
Light-activated compounds may be used in the future to treat
cancers and clear clogged arteries.
The compounds are altered forms of porphyrins, chemicals in
the body that aid in the synthesis of hemoglobin, the oxygen-car
rying pigment found in red blood cells. Scientists have long been
interested in porphyrins because they accumulate in cancer tis
sues.
Radiology Prof. Stuart Young and his colleagues have also
determined that porphyrins are attracted to deposits of choles
terol in the arteries.
Because the molecular structure of porphyrins allows them to
bind to certain kinds of metals, radiologists have been interested
in exploring their use as contrast agents that could improve the
clarity of pictures created by magnetic resonance imaging.
Another unique feature of these compounds is that when
exposed to light they resonate, or produce molecular vibrations.
