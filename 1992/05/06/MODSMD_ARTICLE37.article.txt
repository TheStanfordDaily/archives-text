# When East meets West
## Visiting profs program unites music, language 
### Sara Skinner Staff writer 
When Ivana Bozdechova came
to Stanford as a Fulbright Pro
fessor, she brought a new Czech
language program to the Slavic
Department as well as adding
international color to the faculty.
Rail-thin, with high, pro
nounced cheekbones and a soft,
sing-song accent, Bozdechova
said she hopes to impart her cul
ture as she teaches the language.
"I'm very proud of Czech cul
ture and history," she said.
On leave from her position as a
Czechoslovakian language teacher
at Charles University in Prague,
Bozdechova spent her first year as
a Fulbright professor at the Uni
versity of Nebraska in Omaha,
and then was asked to come to
Stanford for this academic year.
Czechoslovakia to California
Bozdechova has been teaching
beginning and intermediate
Czech this year, and designed an
Innovative Academic Course on
Czechoslovakia.
She is using her teaching experi
ences here to further her research
on the "communicative method" of
teaching Czech language.
"We want to use mass media
materials — authentic Czech
materials," Bozdechova said. "We
want to teach grammar, vocabu
lary, through information about
our country to give people an idea
about our nation, our culture."
The communicative method,
she said, will "teach Czech as it's
really spoken" rather than what a
textbook dictates is historically
correct. "We want to prepare our
students for real communication
in the country It has no sense
if you can't use it," she said.
This technique has already
proven effective in English,
French and Russian classes, she
said. She has applied for a grant
to return to Nebraska and work
with colleagues there on text
books and computer programs
for teachers.
If that doesn't work out, she
said she hopes to continue teach
ing and researching. The Slavic
Department at Stanford doesn't
know whether classes in Czech will
continue next year, she said, sim
ply because "there is no money."
The department can only con
tinue the Czech program if it
receives another Czech Fulbright
Professor, Bozdechova speculated.
Due to requests from her lan
guage students, she successfully

proposed an Innovative Academ
ic Course, "Aspects of Culture in
a Changing Czechoslovakia."
In this course, Bozdechova
emphasizes what she calls her
country's three greatest values:
education, literature and music.
The class includes units on
poetry, prose and music. The final
class is titled "Czech Beer As a
Cultural Phenomenon: the Histo
ry of Its Production and Its
Impact on Czech Arts," which
includes a study of taverns and
pubs around Prague.
'More honest, more open'
Although she says "students
are the same all over the world,"
Bozdechova admitted that "stu
dents here at Stanford are more
dedicated. . . . They really study
very hard."
However, Bozdechova said
she is most surprised by how few
people read in the United States.
"I was really shocked by the high
percentage of illiteracy," she
said. "We don't know illiteracy.
Czechs are fa] nation of readers."
On a practical level, she said,
"It's easier to teach here because
the equipment is better and more
accessible" and communication
with other universities is sim
pler.
Education is changing along
with politics in Czechoslovakia,
however. Under communism, stu
dents "had a list of classes and
exams they had to take.... Every
thing was pre-scripted," and
"everything [professors] were sup

posed to teach should agree with
socialism."
"We were taught that the Sovi
et army was there to save our
lives," she said, then sat up
straighter, adding, "It was an
invasion."
Now, she said, "the whole con
cept of modern history is being
re-evaluated."
She said she enjoys how
Americans "are more direct,
more open, more honest."
"We couldn't say what we
were thinking about, " she said.
"People were cautious on a per
sonal level, too. You never knew
who you could meet with."
Upon her return to Czechoslo
vakia, Bozdechova expects to see
the results of the demise of com
munism in her country. "I will go
to a new country," she said.
Linking language and music
This quarter, Bozdechova has
been taking a verse translation
class in the English Department
and has begun working to trans
late local musician Anne
Delaney's music into Czech.
Bozdechova is translating
Delaney's song titled "King of
Hearts," which is dedicated to the
"people of the Velvet Revolution,"
or the democratic revolution.
Delaney hopes to present the song
to Czech leader Vaclav Havel.
Bozdechova explained that
"every Czech is a musician."
According to a popular Czech
saying, "Every Czech is born
with a violin under the pillow."
