# ASSU attacks scheme to cut Green's hours
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night passed a resolution
urging the University not to close Green Library
two hours earlier on weeknights.
The bill came in response to the University's
proposal to close Green Library at 10 p.m. next
year, instead of at midnight. Library administra
tors said Monday that the cuts are almost certain
to go into effect.
Authored by graduate senator Elizabeth Wahl,
the bill also urges the University to "allocate the
necessary funds to maintain its library system at
an adequate level" and consider when students use
the library most if hours must be cut.
In addition, the senate voted to have lawyers
look at the Omnibus Fee Reform bill to decide if it
violates the ASSU's non-profit status.
The bill, proposed two weeks ago, would take
nearly $1 million from ASSU reserve funds and put
most of the money into a one-time refund of $65
per student.
Some involved with the ASSU, however, have
expressed fears that the bill would jeopardize the
group's tax-exempt status. ASSU Financial Man
ager Mike Risch said the bill could be interpreted
as paying a dividend to students — making the
ASSU a for-profit business.
Risch said last week that he had spoken with
auditors from Hood & Strong, the firm that audits
the ASSU, who said the bill would be "hard to
defend" in an audit.
Another bill passed last night will create a com
mittee, headed by Senate Chair Kevin Warsh, to
obtain legal advice on the bill and
report to the senate by their next
meeting May 20.
The senate also certified results
of the spring general election last
night, with one change. Kul Wad
hwa was approved as the last non
voting senator after Sarah Kling,
who had won the number 20 under
graduate seat, resigned because she
was hired as an assistant ASSU
administrative manager.
ASSU bylaws forbid one per
son from holding an elected and
appointed ASSU position at the
same time.
The senate also discussed but
rejected a bill that would have
tied the salary of the elections
commissioner to the percentage
of polling materials used in grad
uate student areas.
Graduate senator Jay Bhat
tacharya, said the lack of polling
sites in areas frequented by gradu
ate students hindered their voting.

According to undergraduate
senator Pamay Bassey, last
night's meeting was the "most
fun, best senate meeting all year."
It was punctuated by a small
paper-ball fight and an unusually
large number of personal insults.
In addition, undergraduate
senator Raphe Beck took what he
called an unofficial undergradu
ate senate poll to find the
"favorite graduate senator."
Beck said the winner was "The
Godfather of Soul, (graduate sen
ator) James Brown."
"I feel good," Brown said.
