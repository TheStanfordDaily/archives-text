### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Terra House is scrambling to sanitize the
"raunchy" residence in time for presidential hope
ful Jerry Brown's Saturday visit to Stanford, dur
ing which he will attend a fund-raising meal in the
dormitory.
"I promised the local (campaign) group Terra
would be clean," said Stanford for Brown club
member Rafe Sagarin, a sophomore in the house.
"There was some concern, it being a co-op and all."
A massive clean-up will be planned for Friday at
tonight's house meeting, and organizers will try to
"draw attention away from uncleanable parts,"
Sagarin said.
Howard Smith, a director of Brown's regional
campaign, said he has attended meetings in the
Terra lounge and"the room is pretty raunchy. The
furniture is in disarray and it's not exactly clean."
But Sagarin played down the cleanliness issue.
"Howard has been out of college too long," he said.
"I don't think Jerry will mind."
Brown, a former California governor, is sched
uled to speak in White Plaza Saturday as part, of an
energy conference. After a quick appearance in
East Palo Alto, he will head to Terra.
Sagarin said tickets for the event will probably
be about $J0 a plate, "which I should stress is less
than Bush's $1,000 a plate" fund
raiser last week.
While he said it makes him
"kind of nervous," specifics on
admission to the meal "are still up
in the air." He said at this point,
everyone is welcome and dona
tions will be taken at the door.
However, he said "we're going
to have to cut it off somewhere"
when food and space run out.
Although the menu is not set,
Smith said it "could be lasagna."
Brown will remain at Terra for
about a half hour, he added.
Supporters will "probably pass
the hat for loose change," Smith
said. "We need all the money we can
get. It's that kind of campaign." He
added that donations will be expect
ed â€” with, of course, a $100 limit.
According to Sagarin, a core
group of six Stanford for Brown
members have been frantically
trying to organize the meal with
only a few days' notice, and many
of the details are still uncertain.

The students are working with
the district campaign committee.
Terra resident assistant Tisha
Clark said people in the dorm are
excited about the news and
echoed the concern about tidi
ness. "We're trying to get the
place presentable," she said.
Although the speech and meal
will coincide with Mikhail Gor
bachev's visit to Stanford,
Sagarin said he is not worried
that Gorbachev will draw atten
tion away from his candidate.
In fact, Brown spokesperson
Beth Hanson said she has "been
trying to arrange an appoint
ment" so the leaders can meet.
But she added that while she has
"put forth a request," she does
not know how feasible such a dis
cussion will be.
Sagarin said that while he
hopes a meeting will take place,
"my fear is that Gorbachev is too
set in his schedule."
But Sagarin said he thinks "they
would have a lot to talk about."
Brown is currently scheduled
to be at Terra at 2:15 p.m. The
White Plaza speech has been
moved from 1:15 to 12:45 p.m.
