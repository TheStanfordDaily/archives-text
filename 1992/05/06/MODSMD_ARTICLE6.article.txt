*There is no concept of'we,' no collective responsibility or kinship that goes
beyond race. We need to make neighborhoods instead of trying to get rich .. . ?
—Kwame Anku

"As the cycle of violence perpet
uates / and tensions increase and
flare ... Why is it when anger
mounts we take out / on whoever
we can ... It's our responsibility
to stop insensitivity ... America,
this is your Call to Arms."
In the wake of the Rodney King
beating verdict, the strong social
and political messages in sopho
more Kwame Anku's music are
reflected in the campus protests.
Whether he is playing expres
sive acoustic guitar or driving a
dance rhythm, Anku said he has
chosen a long-term dedication to
the idea that music can make a
difference.
Anku wrote "Call to Arms"
when he was in high school as a
part of his continuing explo
ration of music with a message.
When the original tape of the
King beating was released in
April 1991, he and The Seven
Principles, the campus band he
was involved in, flew down to
Los Angeles to play at a rally led
by Jesse Jackson on the lawn of
the police station. The group
opened for the rap group Public
Enemy at the gathering.
Anku has since split from the
band to work on his own music.
He helped organize Friday's
rally in front of the Law School.
He said the King beating
proved that "something is dras
tically wrong in our society,"
and since the verdict, people
should be paying even more
attention to those problems.
"There is no concept of 'we,'
no collective responsibility or
kinship that goes beyond race,"
he said. "We need to make neigh
borhoods instead of trying to get
rich so I can have great things."
Although he grew up in a
comfortable, mostly white

neighborhood, he said he initial
ly gave up dreams of being a
rock guitar player because "no
black person was doing it."
Anku said black music has
always been around in some
form, but it wasn't until the
black group Living Colour
gained prominence around 1985
that he realized blacks could be
entertainers on the largest scale.
"Rap music has always
addressed urban issues and
reflected the black life. Rock tar
gets white teens and builds this
image of what white party people
do," he said. "So there is an over
riding stereotype that rap was
black music and rock was white."
But after Living Colour
became popular, these lines
were blurred. White kids started
listening to black music. "They
were being brought into the
black culture and it sparked
their interest," he said.
Anku started writing his own
music in 1989, during his senior
year of high school. He had been
playing the guitar and key
boards for a few years, but it was
loneliness that drove him to
combine his own words with his
tunes. His ideas came from
walks, talks and things he saw
around him.
"It was a strange time in my
life and I was very confused," he
said. "My parents were divorced
and I found myself sitting alone
a lot. I wrote poetry as sort of an
emotional outlet, and then I fit
the music to it."
This loneliness is reflected in
one of his songs, "Love's More
Precious Than Gold": "Sitting
in an empty room again / The
thought scares me that I'm my
own best friend . . . I'm not one
to cry for help / but I wish some
one could see I'm in distress ...
I wish I had a hand to hold /

because love to me is more pre
cious than gold."
When Anku came to Stanford,
he said he faced resentment from
some of the people he left behind.
"A lot of times, the black com
munity feels that when you go to
college, you've sold out, you've
bought into the system," he said.
"But you've got to know how the
system works. If you're on the
inside you can learn how to
change it. If we say nothing, then
nothing will change."
Anku has already seen the
music world from the inside. Next
summer will be his second as an
intern at Los Angeles' MTV stu
dios. He said that based on what
he has learned about the system,
he knows he doesn't fit into the
mainstream rock world.
Rock music "is the best medi
um to reach kids, but they're too
busy banging their heads," he
said. "We've taken a whole group
of people and raised them up to be
bubble gum rockers. Music can be
more than that."
According to Anku, there is too
much empty music. Although
making changes is not as easy as

picking up a guitar, he said, it is
clear what he won't do.
"I'm just not going to get up
and do 'everything is fine' music,"
he said. "I want to prove that you
can incorporate positive lifestyle
and not advocate a sex, drugs and
rock *n' roll mentality."
Anku wants to combine music
with his education. He is now an
African-American Studies major
and wants to apply what he's
learned into what he plays.
He said he wants to create
music that transcends lines of
class and race, music that brings
people together so they can dis
cuss real issues and learn from
each other.
"There are a lot of people who
don't hate anyone, but they are
still ignorant about the things
that are going on with people
right next to them."
Although his convictions are
strong, he still questions himself
in the song "Sanctuary": "As we
walk into the future, we see a pic
ture of uncertainty/ not a woman,
not a man / no one understands /
where we're going to."
Anku said he doesn't have it
all together. He still wrestles with
how he feels about social issues.
He struggles to make his music a
force of change. And he knows
that won't be easy.

*There is no concept of'we,' no collective responsibility or kinship that goes
beyond race. We need to make neighborhoods instead of trying to get rich .. . ?
—Kwame Anku

"As the cycle of violence perpet
uates / and tensions increase and
flare ... Why is it when anger
mounts we take out / on whoever
we can ... It's our responsibility
to stop insensitivity ... America,
this is your Call to Arms."
In the wake of the Rodney King
beating verdict, the strong social
and political messages in sopho
more Kwame Anku's music are
reflected in the campus protests.
Whether he is playing expres
sive acoustic guitar or driving a
dance rhythm, Anku said he has
chosen a long-term dedication to
the idea that music can make a
difference.
Anku wrote "Call to Arms"
when he was in high school as a
part of his continuing explo
ration of music with a message.
When the original tape of the
King beating was released in
April 1991, he and The Seven
Principles, the campus band he
was involved in, flew down to
Los Angeles to play at a rally led
by Jesse Jackson on the lawn of
the police station. The group
opened for the rap group Public
Enemy at the gathering.
Anku has since split from the
band to work on his own music.
He helped organize Friday's
rally in front of the Law School.
He said the King beating
proved that "something is dras
tically wrong in our society,"
and since the verdict, people
should be paying even more
attention to those problems.
"There is no concept of 'we,'
no collective responsibility or
kinship that goes beyond race,"
he said. "We need to make neigh
borhoods instead of trying to get
rich so I can have great things."
Although he grew up in a
comfortable, mostly white

neighborhood, he said he initial
ly gave up dreams of being a
rock guitar player because "no
black person was doing it."
Anku said black music has
always been around in some
form, but it wasn't until the
black group Living Colour
gained prominence around 1985
that he realized blacks could be
entertainers on the largest scale.
"Rap music has always
addressed urban issues and
reflected the black life. Rock tar
gets white teens and builds this
image of what white party people
do," he said. "So there is an over
riding stereotype that rap was
black music and rock was white."
But after Living Colour
became popular, these lines
were blurred. White kids started
listening to black music. "They
were being brought into the
black culture and it sparked
their interest," he said.
Anku started writing his own
music in 1989, during his senior
year of high school. He had been
playing the guitar and key
boards for a few years, but it was
loneliness that drove him to
combine his own words with his
tunes. His ideas came from
walks, talks and things he saw
around him.
"It was a strange time in my
life and I was very confused," he
said. "My parents were divorced
and I found myself sitting alone
a lot. I wrote poetry as sort of an
emotional outlet, and then I fit
the music to it."
This loneliness is reflected in
one of his songs, "Love's More
Precious Than Gold": "Sitting
in an empty room again / The
thought scares me that I'm my
own best friend . . . I'm not one
to cry for help / but I wish some
one could see I'm in distress ...
I wish I had a hand to hold /

Kwame Anku expresses his — and much of the nation's — frustration with racial ten

in front of a police station.
because love to me is more pre
cious than gold."
When Anku came to Stanford,
he said he faced resentment from
some of the people he left behind.
"A lot of times, the black com
munity feels that when you go to
college, you've sold out, you've
bought into the system," he said.
"But you've got to know how the
system works. If you're on the
inside you can learn how to
change it. If we say nothing, then
nothing will change."
Anku has already seen the
music world from the inside. Next
summer will be his second as an
intern at Los Angeles' MTV stu
dios. He said that based on what
he has learned about the system,
he knows he doesn't fit into the
mainstream rock world.
Rock music "is the best medi
um to reach kids, but they're too
busy banging their heads," he
said. "We've taken a whole group
of people and raised them up to be
bubble gum rockers. Music can be
more than that."
According to Anku, there is too
much empty music. Although
making changes is not as easy as

picking up a guitar, he said, it is
clear what he won't do.
"I'm just not going to get up
and do 'everything is fine' music,"
he said. "I want to prove that you
can incorporate positive lifestyle
and not advocate a sex, drugs and
rock *n' roll mentality."
Anku wants to combine music
with his education. He is now an
African-American Studies major
and wants to apply what he's
learned into what he plays.
He said he wants to create
music that transcends lines of
class and race, music that brings
people together so they can dis
cuss real issues and learn from
each other.
"There are a lot of people who
don't hate anyone, but they are
still ignorant about the things
that are going on with people
right next to them."
Although his convictions are
strong, he still questions himself
in the song "Sanctuary": "As we
walk into the future, we see a pic
ture of uncertainty/ not a woman,
not a man / no one understands /
where we're going to."
Anku said he doesn't have it
all together. He still wrestles with
how he feels about social issues.
He struggles to make his music a
force of change. And he knows
that won't be easy.
