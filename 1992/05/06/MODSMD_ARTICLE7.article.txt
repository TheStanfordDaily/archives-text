Fluorescent pink triangles are gain
ing more attention these days, and so
are Stanford's gay, lesbian and bisexual
faculty, staff and students.
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Awareness
Days kicked off last week and will con
clude Saturday with an all-day confer
ence on same-sex relationships.
So far, BGLAD activities have been
very well attended, according to Troy
Gilbert, University adviser to the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Center.
One purpose of the BGLAD activities,

which include workshops, book readings
and concerts, is to educate the communi
ty at large about gay issues. But BGLAD
also aims "to educate and empower our
own [gayl community," Gilbert said.
Multicultural Educator Greg Ricks
said this sense of empowerment proves
important for gay students, because
while he sees an "incredible solidarity
for gays, lesbians and bisexuals" on this
campus, Stanford is "not a Shangri-la or
Mecca for gay students."
"There still is clearly work to be
done," he said.
John Newsome, a gay sophomore, said
despite the efforts made by Residential

Education and the LGBCC Speakers'
Bureau, "some people graduating from
Stanford will still stereotype and say, 'All
blacks'; 'All Mexicans'; 'All gays.' "
Newsome expressed concern about
the myths perpetuated about homosexu
als. "People hear that all homosexuals
practice sodomy, or all homosexuals go
to gay orgies in San Francisco," he said.
"There is no voice to compensate" for
these myths, he added.
Sophomore Rachel Maddow said
ignorance about gay lifestyles may stem
in part from the lack of an academic
