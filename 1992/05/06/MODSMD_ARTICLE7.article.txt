Fluorescent pink triangles are gain
ing more attention these days, and so
are Stanford's gay, lesbian and bisexual
faculty, staff and students.
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Awareness
Days kicked off last week and will con
clude Saturday with an all-day confer
ence on same-sex relationships.
So far, BGLAD activities have been
very well attended, according to Troy
Gilbert, University adviser to the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Center.
One purpose of the BGLAD activities,

which include workshops, book readings
and concerts, is to educate the communi
ty at large about gay issues. But BGLAD
also aims "to educate and empower our
own [gayl community," Gilbert said.
Multicultural Educator Greg Ricks
said this sense of empowerment proves
important for gay students, because
while he sees an "incredible solidarity
for gays, lesbians and bisexuals" on this
campus, Stanford is "not a Shangri-la or
Mecca for gay students."
"There still is clearly work to be
done," he said.
John Newsome, a gay sophomore, said
despite the efforts made by Residential

Education and the LGBCC Speakers'
Bureau, "some people graduating from
Stanford will still stereotype and say, 'All
blacks'; 'All Mexicans'; 'All gays.' "
Newsome expressed concern about
the myths perpetuated about homosexu
als. "People hear that all homosexuals
practice sodomy, or all homosexuals go
to gay orgies in San Francisco," he said.
"There is no voice to compensate" for
these myths, he added.
Sophomore Rachel Maddow said
ignorance about gay lifestyles may stem
in part from the lack of an academic

forum for this subject. Gay-relat
ed issues were best addressed in
SWOPSI courses, she said, but
this program is now being elimi
nated due to budget cuts.
BGLAD organizers said they
specifically organized some
events, such as the relationship
conference, to address issues that
otherwise go unspoken.
A common complaint among
the gay community is the media's
focus on heterosexual relation
ships, said Rob Sherry, a gay
graduate student who said he
plans to attend the workshop.
"The type of advice [on rela
tionships] you tend to hear,
whether it's from Ann Landers or
Dr. Ruth, almost never talks
about gay couples," he said.
This weekend's all-day confer
ence on relationships will address
specific concerns that gay, lesbian
and bisexual people have about
their personal lives â€” such as
domestic partnerships, parenting
and intimacy.
The workshop will help newly
adjusting gay, lesbian and bisexu
al students who may be experienc
ing an "adolescence in terms of
dating," said Sherry, who is also
writing a gay issues and resource
guide for new Stanford students.
Sherry said there is "definitely
a feeling" among both gay and
straight people that the "rules for
gay dating are different" than
those for straight dating.
One BGLAD organizer said he
believes it is important to "bring
gay relationships into visibility"
and to "offer students [homosex
ual] role models" for their own
relationships.
Members of the Bay Area's
gay, lesbian and bisexual commu
nity have been invited to attend
the workshop.
Other upcoming events this
week include tonight's book read
ing by Marvin Liebman, one of
the fathers of the American Con
servative Movement, who came
out publicly two years ago.
Thursday at noon Steve Stern
berg, a Stanford Knight Fellow
who chronicled the challenges of
a person with AIDS for the
Atlanta Constitution, will pre
sent "When AIDS Comes Home:
A Glimpse at The Heart of an
Epidemic."
