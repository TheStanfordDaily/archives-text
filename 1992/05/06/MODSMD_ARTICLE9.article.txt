# Yeah, that's the ticket
## Everyone who entered Gorby ticket lottery gets to see him 
### Kimberly Chrism an Editorial staff 
Everyone was a winner in the
lottery for the 1,500 remaining tick
ets for Mikhail Gorbachev's speech
Saturday at Frost Amphitheater.
About 1,400 students, 100
staff members and 50 faculty
entered the ticket lottery, accord
ing to Mary Bartlett of the Office
of Public Affairs. The planning
committee released 50 more tick
ets than planned "because we
know we're going to get some no
shows," Bartlett said.
"Rather than disappoint some
people by having the lottery, we
decided to do it this way," she
said. "We figured we were so close
that it would be a shame to say no
to just a handful of students."
Under the terms set by the Gor
bachev/USA Foundation, the
tour's sponsor, tickets could be
made available only to Stanford
and local educational communities.
The additional seats were
underwritten by University presi
dent Donald Kennedy's office after
the original 9,000 tickets were
snapped up by Stanford students,
stafT and faculty in four hours.
According to Bartlett, organiz
ers were surprised that the demand
for tickets was not higher last week.
"We were pleasantly surprised
that we were able to offer a ticket to
everyone," she said. "We didn't real
ly know how many we would have,
just as at the very beginning when

we had the original distribution, we
did not know how many to expect."
Tickets can be claimed at the
Tresidder Ticket Office today and
tomorrow between 10 a.m. and 5
p.m.
Any unclaimed tickets will be

'If anyone had a really

â€”Mary Bartlett

distributed on a first-come, first
served basis beginning at 10 a.m.
Friday. These tickets will only be
available to those with Stanford IDs
who have not yet obtained a ticket.
"I think if anyone had a really
strong desire to go to the Gorby
lecture, they had the opportuni
ty," Bartlett said.
Although 10,550 tickets have
been allotted to the Stanford com
munity, only 7,500 chairs will be
available at the event, with the
remainder of seating on the grass.
The gates to Frost Amphitheater
will open at 9:30 a.m. Saturday
for the 11:15 a.m. speech.
Security officers have announced
that cameras and clear plastic water
containers will be allowed at the
speech, but coolers and large bags
will not.
