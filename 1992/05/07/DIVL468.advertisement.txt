Dear Branner 1988^89,
I just looked through your old freshman facebook
and I thought of each of you. I can't believe it was
four years ago that I was sitting with the RA's
memorizing all your names. Soon your faces would
leap off the page and I would be fortunate enough
to spend some time with you. I haven't seen many
of you since that time, but I still think of you. (Yes,
I'm still a sap).
I want to wish you an early "Happy Graduation."
