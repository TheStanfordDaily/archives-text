# 'It was like slamming the door loudly'
## Dorm-room radiators are cacophonies to ears of some students 
### Steve Sherman 
Smelly, noisy steam radiators that turn
dorm rooms into saunas have some students
threatening to take a hammer to the mechan
ical nuisances.
The steam radiators installed in some resi
dences have been the cause of many a sleepless
night â€” and a source of many a complaint to
Operations and Maintenance.
Sophomore Tony Toranto colorfully called
the radiators in Roble Hall "cacophonous crea
tures from hell" because of the way they clat
tered loudly at all hours of the day until they
were finally fixed recently.
During the night, he and his roommate
would be awakened by the clanking, clicking
sounds. Toranto observed that while everyone
in Roble had some similar problems, the
heater is directly under his bed and the noise
in his room "was clearly far and above the
loudest."
Sophomore Robert Taylor, Toranto's room
mate, is on the crew team, and the radiators
were so loud that "he could count on it to wake
him up for practice."
"Basically, I hate my radiators," Toranto
said.

Other students in Roble and Lagunita Court
echoed the complaint. Radiators constantly
clink, clatter and spew stifling heat to no end,
even in the middle of the night, they say.
Whether Toranto and Taylor left the heat
on or turned it off didn't matter. The noise
continued. They even tried to hit it with a
hammer once or twice.
In addition, the heaters also "stunk like a
musty jockstrap," according to Toranto. "Not
that I would know what that smells like."
He said he complained early first quarter
about the noise, but for some reason his
requests were not answered until spring break.
Operations and Maintenance employees with
knowledge about the radiator problems could not
be reached for comment over the last two days.
According to junior Kathy Unruh, a Lagu
nita resident, "I could gripe about those
heaters for hours."
A native of frigid North Dakota, she said
she enjoys a cool room when she's trying to
sleep, an impossibility in the presence of
overzealous radiators.
In the middle of fall quarter, the torture
started for Unruh. "On cue, every night at 7,
they would rattle and creak a little bit. It sort
of sounded like a train was going to come

through my wall," she said.
She said what she hated most about the
noise was the knowledge that the heat would
soon be overtaking her room.
As her room transformed into a "steam
bath," it became harder and harder to sleep.
She tried fiddling with the knob on the heater,
but to no avail.
So Unruh became a woman with a mission.
She started by fdling out fix-it forms in the
dorm's front office, hoping that someone
would come and solve her problem. No
response. She tried again. Still nothing.
"Then I left them a not-so-nice ... but to
the point letter." It read, "If someone doesn't
come over here and fix my heater, my hammer
and I are going to permanently turn it off in a
not-so-conventional manner," she said.
Needless to say, the next morning someone
came to check on Unruh.
The maintenance worker "fiddled with the
knob" for a while, and informed her that the
heat can't be turned off for just one person,
added that Unruh need not worry because
they were planning to turn it all off in the
beginning of March.
After the the heat was finally shut off in
April, Unruh said, she could sleep at last.
