As LA dead are buried, state directs aid
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Families buried victims of the city's
deadly riots and coroners searched gutted buildings for more
remains yesterday while police came under more harsh criticism
for their response to the violence.
Some rank-and-file officers were among the critics, and Mayor
Tom Bradley, visiting the area of destruction, said the force's
response in the early hours was unacceptable.
This week, traffic has returned to gridlock levels, restaurants
have filled and, outside burned neighborhoods, life continues
much as before.
But thousands of armed federal troops and National Guards
men remain on the streets, and scores of residents in the riot-torn
areas have been left homeless and without food stores.
Gov. Pete Wilson announced a pian to direct $20 million to job
training, and he urged Bush to give another $20 million in feder
al money for short-term employment of up to 4,000 people to help
clean up damage.
Bush, criticical of aid, offers help on visit
LOS ANGELES (AP) — President Bush flew to this riot-torn
city yesterday and said he was heartened that "calm has
returned" to Los Angeles. He vowed intensive federal government
help in rebuilding.
He said that when he meets with victims of the riots and com
munity leaders, "I will assure them, as I will all the citizens of Los
Angeles, the federal government is committed to help this city —
to help this city rebuild."
Earlier in Washington, Bush said he was looking for ways to
assure tranquility in the nation's inner cities. He said he was not
satisfied with past government responses — including Great Soci
ety anti-poverty programs.
"I think we can do better," he said at the White House.
But he added, "This is no time to play the blame game."
Administration officials have said that money is not the
answer to urban ills while also trying to defend against accusa
tions that the Reagan and Bush administrations helped foment
urban unrest by trying to cut programs for the poor.
"The fact is, in the past decade spending is up, a number of
programs are up," Bush said. "And yet, let's face it, that has not
solved many of the fundamental problems that plague our cities."
