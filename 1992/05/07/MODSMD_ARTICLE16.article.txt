Proposal to cut hours
at Green Library hurts
quality of education

IN A MOVE that will only erode
the quality of education at
Stanford, library officials plan
to close Green Library two hours
earlier next year.
Under the plan, Green would
stay open until just 10 p.m. Sunday
through Thursday, and would close
early in the evening on weekends.
This cut simply cannot be
allowed to stand. Obviously, the
library's budget planners have not
considered student needs in their
decision-making process — an
omission that has been a continu
ing theme during this year of
painful "restructuring."
The ASSU senate, too, is out
raged at the proposal, which Uni
versity administrators say is almost
certain to be adopted next year.
The senate passed a resolution at
its meeting Tuesday that urges the
University to spend the money nec
essary to maintain its library system
at the current level — and, if hours
must be cut, to consider examining
when students use the library most
before making a final decision.
Most students, especially under
graduates, study after 10 p.m. If
library officials had surveyed stu
dents to determine the time most
convenient to cut, the vast majori
ty would certainly have proposed
the early morning hours.
Stanford's administration has
prided itself on keeping pace with
other schools, even during a time
of massive budget cuts.
But a cut like the one envisioned
for Green — coupled with a drastic
re-scaling of Meyer Library, the
"undergraduate" library whose
name is a misnomer because so
few of them use it — will make
that boast meaningless.
Stanford's library hours already
lag behind those of other schools.
The libraries of most other Ivy

League schools and top state
schools stay open into the early
morning hours.
At Harvard, the two main
undergraduate libraries — Lam
ont and Hilles — are open until 1
a.m. every day except Thursday
and Saturday, when they close at
12 a.m. On Fridays, they close at
10 p.m. Green Library closes at 5
p.m. on Fridays.
Harvard, which has the largest
library system of any institution in
the world, also has more than 100
other libraries, and many of them
are open until 1 a.m. During Har
vard's "reading period," a 10-day
study session similar to Stanford's
Dead Week, libraries are open until
1 a.m. every day.
At the University of Chicago —
where incoming University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper has spent the
last 25 years — Regenstein
Library is open until 1 a.m. Sun
day through Thursday, and until
10 p.m. Friday and Saturday.
And at UC-Berkeley, a school
whose budget has been hit rela
tively harder than Stanford's
because of belt-tightening at the
state level, the main library still
stays open until 12 a.m. Monday
through Thursday.
It is ironic that such drastically
reduced hours are being allowed at
Stanford, which consistently
hypes its commitment to under
graduate education and teaching.
Faculty and staff are not the
people who, for the most part,
study late at night. Undergradu
ates, who lack alternative study
spots, are the most adversely
affected by this plan — and they
are the people who should be the
most upset.
They must communicate that
displeasure to administrators if
this proposal — which was decided
quietly, with little student input —
is to be stopped.
The plan to cut Green's hours
would save about $75,000-
$100,000. But what it saves in dol
lars will pale in comparison to
what it costs students in muted
opportunities.
