SINCE THE VERDICT and the riots
that followed, we have focused most
of our anger on the actions of a few.
For me, the story involves every single one
of us. The consequences of three centuries
of economic subjugation have never been
undone, and the need for radical change
rarely has been more apparent.
We must call upon the federal govern
ment to build up the decimated inner
cities of America just as the Marshall
plan rebuilt the cities of Europe after
World War 11. It doesn't take a rocket sci
entist to see that South Central L.A.
looks like downtown Beirut. All around
the country are similar war zone neigh
borhoods that desperately need help like
the post-war reconstruction efforts.
William Julius Wilson, a black sociolo
gist at the University of Chicago, has
argued that racism can be divided into two
components; historical and contemporary.
For Wilson, contemporary racism is the
prejudice that continues to crop up today,
while historical racism is the impact of
that everyday racism on an entire class of
people over several centuries.
Though contemporary racism is easier
to see and understand — like the police
beating Rodney King or 12 jurors finding
those police innocent — it is the reper
cussions of historical racism that we
must attack if we wish to improve the
lives of those surviving in toxic ghettoes.
If we take Wilson's argument to a logi

cal end, many black Americans could
wake up tomorrow in a world free of prej
udice and they'd still be buried under the
weight of history. They'd live in devastat
ed communities, be schooled in segregat
ed, decaying institutions, employed in
dead-end jobs and under-served by their
hospitals, supermarkets and government.
Just as we make all kinds of prepara
tions for earthquakes here in California,
we must see the foundation missing else
where in society. My fear, however, is
that our country will continue to ignore,
neglect and abuse poor people and use
their expressions of discontent as excuses
for more "law and order" repression.
The whole LAPD affair and trial
seemed like something out of a time
warp. This is not the South in 1951. This
went down in 1991, cosmopolitan L.A.
The jurors were not good ol' boys but
rather people who sounded like they
might live next door (if you happened to
live in a white suburb).
But this was a modern
event — from the beating video to the
integrated riots. The fact is that people
don't need to burn a cross on your lawn to
harbor a monstrous amount of bias
against black people and wreak a lot of
damage in black lives. Ignorance and inac
tion can be as powerful as a lynch mob.
Police inaction may have been the
determining factor in the spread of the
riots. Tuesday's New York Times report-

Ed that a half-hour after the first reports
of violence came in, Los Angeles Police
Chief Daryl Gates managed to find an
hour and a half to attend a political fund
raiser for his own benefit.
During a question-and-answer period
at the end of the fund raiser someone
inquired about the rioting they had just
seen on TV. Gates responded and then
took another 15 minutes of questioning.
Also, the police near the early rioting
were called back and explicitly told not to
respond to any calls about public disor
ders. What could the LAPD have been
planning for the two hours it let chaos
prevail?
What could Gates have possibly been
thinking at his fund raiser when he knew
that on the streets of L.A. people were
being yanked from cars and beaten mer
cilessly?
In 1992 racism doesn't look like the
Klan. It looks like citizens who are blind
and governments which neglect. Racism
is as much about inaction as action. It
looks very much like every one of us who
ignores the suffering borne by people of
color in America and around the world.
