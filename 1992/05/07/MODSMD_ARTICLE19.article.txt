Connections and causes: Where does the King trial lead?

THE KING CASE HAS become a
lightning rod for self-realization
about where we are on many issues
related to multiculturalism in the 19905.
It has touched off a lot of memories in
me, things that have been suppressed or
ignored in my consciousness for years as
I have tried to just keep on keepin' on.
As I watched the beatings again on
TV it startles me to realize this kind of
violence has touched my own life, and I
have not gotten angry about it. . .
An undergraduate friend of mine gets
whacked in the face in San Francisco
last month for no reason other than he
was walking with another man...
Another gay community leader and
gentle soul gets beaten viciously with
pipes so severely he is unrecognizable to
his friends — he lapses into a coma and
dies last week, with the police refusing
to recognize it as a hate crime. . .

An Indian brother goes into a small
Idaho town to do his laundry and gets
knifed by racist thugs who are slashing
his tires...
In my home state of Oregon an
African immigrant is attacked and killed
by skinheads in Portland simply because
'he didn't speak real well'.. .
I myself have been shot at, threat
ened, sent hate notes, been harassed by
police, been denied jobs due to my race or
sexual orientation, harassed by Stanford
supervisors, sent dog shit in the mail and
so on, and this has all been in a relatively
short life with only about 15 years as
someone who speaks his mind publicly.
Despite all of this, I have somehow
managed to inoculate myself from
despair. I just keep on coming back to
the fight, usually stronger, and a little
wiser, each time.
The symptoms of "the war within" —

like instances of sexual assault, child abuse
and rampant self-destruction through
drugs and alcohol — are many and deep.
The connection I see then, when I watch
the King beating and the violence I have
known in my own short life, as well as
these other symptoms, is that this hatred
comes from remarkably similar roots.
The cause of all of this fear and vio
lence lies deep within the core of an
incredibly insecure and paranoid majori
ty (barely) of Americans whose grasp on
a sense of control over the life of this
country is rapidly slipping away.
And I see people in our minority com
munities willing to exploit those fears for
short-term revenge and personal gain.
There are no easy answers to these
feelings. But part of the answer I believe
lies in the willingness of each of us — no
matter what our background— to delve
into our own fears and prejudices, and

then try to go back into our pasts and
heal those broken places where the fears
and prejudices took root.
And when our self-confidence and
power has returned to all of us, it is time
then to raise our voices and shout to the
roof tops that we're mad as hell and
we're not going to take this kind of mas
sive societal destruction anymore.
And those politicians who stand in our
way , and the bigots, and the greedy oppor
tunists, and the people within our own
community who have power but have done
nothing to help heal these divisions that
lead to violence had better get out of the
way because our train is coming through,
it's moving even faster today after the
King aftermath, and it has the power and
strength to transform all of our lives.
