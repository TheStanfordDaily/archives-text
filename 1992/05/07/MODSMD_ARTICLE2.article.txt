# Some teach-ins see lower-than-expected turnout
## 
### John Ford Staff writer 
After days of spirited reaction to the
Rodney King verdict, yesterday's teach
ins on subjects including police brutali
ty and student activism were attended
by what History Prof George Fredrick
son called a "less than enormous" num
ber of students.
The level of attendance ranged from
a "packed house" during the teach-in on
muticulturalism to the group of about
20 students who participated in a stu
dent activism session, organizers said.
Fredrickson, who coordinated a

number of the teach-ins, said the group
of 65 to 70 people who attended Tues
day night's discussion titled "Perspec
tives on Racism" was "not an over
whelming crowd."
The low levels of attendance may
have been "because of the short notice,"
he said, but that did not stop the audi
ence from having a "lively discussion"
on the meanings of racism.
Some faculty felt the publicity has
not been adequate, Political Science
Prof. Terry Karl said, especially consid
ering the number of quality faculty
members who are participating.
The majority of the teach-ins attract-

Ed an average of about 30 to 50 people,
while a select few were very crowded.
Multicultural Educator Greg Ricks said
the teach-in he moderated yesterday
was attended by "an overflow crowd" of
close to 150 students.
But faculty continue to plan activi
ties in response to the verdict. Karl said
a campaign to place a national newspa
per advertisement, which will be in the
form of a petition, has resulted in about
600 signatures and a projected $10,000
to $15,000 in donations.
Karl, one of the faculty members
organizing the effort, said the
results are part of "a wonderful
and empathetic human response
from the community."
Donations, ranging from the
required $25 to as high as $200,
are coming from all over the Uni
versity, according to Karl. Orga
nizers have extended the deadline
for signatures until today at 5 p.m.

The ad is expected to run later
this week and may be in the West
Coast edition of The New York
Times, she said.
Presentations by a group of
five Los Angeles youths are also
being planned for next week.
Ricks said he decided to bring the
group to Stanford after meeting
them in South Central Los Ange
les.
Ricks was in Los Angeles Mon
day and Tuesday on a govern
ment-sponsored trip to evaluate a
potential aid package for the city.
