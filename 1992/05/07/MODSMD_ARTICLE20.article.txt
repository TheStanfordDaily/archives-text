# Reflections on violence hidden in the mundane
## 
### 
I've been a graduate student at Stanford
for four years now. In that time, I have had
some of the most difficult, amusing and
painful experiences of my life — most of
them having nothing to do with academics.
Doctors thought my wife had cancer,
my father had open heart surgery, my
mother had her Carotid artery repaired
and I was at the dinner where Stuart
Reges allegedly paid for alcoholic bever
ages consumed by underage students.
These experiences all affected me in a
very personal way, but recently I was
disturbed by an incident that had noth
ing to do with me at all.
Last quarter I was enrolled in CS3ISA,
a course in parallel computer architec
tures. One of the teaching assistants was a
slightly overweight, generally disheveled
looking graduate student named Andreas
Drexler. Despite his rather unkept appear

ance, he was no more unusual looking
than your typical computer science mqjor.
I would attend the review session he
and the other teaching assistant held
before exams. He was generally soft spo
ken and seemed to have a good, though
somewhat dry, sense of humor. I didn't
really know Andreas Drexler, but what I
knew of him certainly didn't allude to
the violence that he was capable of.
When I read the article about Drexler
in the April 27 Daily, I felt the shock most
people feel when they read about a sense
less tragedy, but I also felt something else.
At first it was a sharp disbelief that
someone I had met could kill another
human being, then take his own life;
then it became a sickening uncertainty,
a nagging sense of wonder about what
people are capable of when pushed
beyond their own limitations.
Finally, the feeling matured into a
dark paranoia about the people around
me — about myself. Do I really know my
friends? Are they the sensible, level
headed people I think they are?

What about me? If pushed, could I
commit crimes, then wonder what came
over me? I realize now that these
thoughts are foolish: I do know my
friends, and I can't imagine ever hurt
ing anyone. But still I wonder.
I wonder if any of Andreas' friends
sensed the moral battle raging in his mind.
I wonder if anyone could have helped him
overcome his demons — if he had revealed
them. I wonder if others who I sit near in
class, pass on the street or meet at a party
are susceptible to the kind of despair that
ultimately consumed Drexler.
I have only limited sympathy for
Drexler — he is a murderer. My sympa
thy is mostly for his victims and their
families. But still I have to wonder.
Do we hear, but not actually listen?
Are we so wrapped up in our own strug
gles that we cannot see the violence that
brews in our peers? Or are the violent
just good actors? I wonder.
