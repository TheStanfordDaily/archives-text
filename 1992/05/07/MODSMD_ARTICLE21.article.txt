# Hatred condemned on important day for Jews
## 
### 
The Hillel Foundation and the Jewish
Student Association at Stanford stand in
solidarity with those who are anguished
by the Rodney King verdict and by the
violence that followed. We protest
racism and oppression of any kind.
Today is Israel's Independence Day,
which marks the attainment of national
independence of the Jewish people. As
we celebrate our own freedom, we regret
the coincidence of this day with Presi
dent Bush's declared day of prayer on
the recent violence.
We therefore dedicate today's celebra
tion of freedom to all those who suffer
from racism and oppression.
