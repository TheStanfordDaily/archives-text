## Women No. 2 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Women's tennis coach Frank Brennan
looks like the cat that just ate the canary. The
draw for next week's 20-team NCAA Cham
pionships was released yesterday and to say
Brennan is pleased is an understatement.
"It couldn't be better if I'd done it myself,"
he said. "I like everything about the draw."
First are the opponents. The No. 2-seeded
Cardinal will face the winner of No. 17 San
Diego and No. 16 Mississippi in round two.
If the seeds hold, No. 6 California will be
next. Although the Bears edged the Cardinal
in their last meeting, Brennan is confident
his squad can do the job.
"We'd like to play them again on our
home courts," he said. "We know their play
ers and can do a good job versus Cal."
No. 3 Texas is a likely semifinal opponent.
The Longhorns are the only team besides
unbeaten Florida and the 20-2 Cardinal to
have fewer than three losses this year.
"Texas is strong everywhere," Brennan
said. "(Longhorn No. 1) Susan Gilchrist is
dangerous. She's a server and volleyer. If you
catch her when her serve is going in, then
she'll be tough."
One of Texas' strengths is doubles. The
veteran pair of Gilchrist and Vickie Paynter
is the top-ranked collegiate duo. The tandem
won the Rolex doubles title in January.
"It would be hard to blank them in dou
bles if it came down to that," Brennan said.
What pleases him most is the teams Stan
ford can't face until the final.
No. 1 Florida heads the top half of the
draw. The Gators will likely meet No. 7
UCLA and either No. 4 Duke or No. 5 Geor
gia. However, Florida has shown it's vulner
able to both the Bruins and Bulldogs.
UCLA knocked Florida out of the NCAA
tourney last year and took the Gators to 5-4
at the National Team Indoors in February.
Georgia also pushed Florida to 5-4 in 1992
and top Dawg Shannan McCarthy beat Lisa
Raymond.
"There are more tough teams in the top
half of the draw," Brennan said.
Besides the outcome of the draw process,
Brennan also likes the scheduling. Host
Stanford was given not only the best site —
Stanford Tennis Stadium — but the best
times. The Cardinal will begin all matches at
3 p.m. The final is Sunday at 1 p.m.
"We get a chance to get into it and it's
good for the crowd," Brennan said. "If our
matches were at 10 a.m., the chances of get
ting a lot fan support are not as good."
