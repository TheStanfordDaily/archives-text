# Solomon blossoms into true Card star
## 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
Senior outfielder Steve Solomon has
struggled for consistency during his four
years with the Stanford Cardinal. This sea
son, with the tight division race and the play
offs on the line, he appears to have found it.
Solomon grew up in a baseball family, so he
has had a lot of support in everything he has
done. Growing up in Los Angeles, he watched
his two older brothers play both in high school
and in college. With their example, baseball
seemed the natural sport to follow.
"We were all pretty active, my parents
included," he said. "There was no pressure
to play, but things have just worked out that
way."
In particular, Solomon's eldest brother
Mike has served as a role model for the way
he has developed. Mike played at Cal State-
Northridge and played in the Seattle
Manners' minor league system for a year.
Solomon sees Mike as his biggest influence.
Even now, Solomon looks to his eldest
brother for support and advice. "He's been
there," he said. "He's done a lot of the
things I'm going through right now. I talk to
him two or three times a week about a game,
a pitcher, school or even personal things."
One thing that Mike experienced that
Solomon will soon encounter is the major
league draft. Solomon will probably be cho
sen somewhere in the middle rounds and
plans to sign with whoever chooses him.
"I'll have to wait until June to find out
where I'll be," he said. "But I plan on walking
through graduation and then hopefully playing
for a couple months (in the minor leagues)."
Although he doesn't care where he plays,
Solomon's favorite team is the New York Yan
kees. "My dad likes the Yankees," he said. "I
grew up listening to him root for them."
If Solomon had not hit the way he has this
season, he would not have seen his name cho
sen by a major league organization in June.
He cites changes in his attitude and his focus
as reasons for his improvement at the plate.
Solomon played two summers in the
Cape Cod League, the best summer league
in the country. He hit .341 there in 1990,
and had high expectations for his junior
year. The added pressure he placed on him
self may have hurt him.
"The last twenty games I went downhill,"
he said. "The pressure of the upcoming
draft and the expectations I had couldn't
have helped." Instead of pursuing the draft
as he had originally decided, Solomon decid
ed to remain at Stanford.

In the past offseason, Solomon did a lot to
help himself prepare for his final year of
Stanford baseball. He played in the Cape
Cod League for a second year and had an
outstanding fall playing in intrasquad
games with the Cardinal.
"It gave me a chance to compete harder
than I would have against outside competi
tion, because I wanted the opportunity to
play every day,"he said. "It got me real con
fident coming into the spring."
After a typically slow start, Solomon has
been knocking the ball all over the park.
Through last Sunday, he is hitting .359 with
nine home runs and 36 runs batted in.
Mental preparation is the area where
Solomon has done the most to improve his hit
ting. "What I do in the on-deck circle has been
the biggest change. The pitcher is trying to get
me out and I'm trying to beat him. I really
focus on the pitcher now and make sure I know
the situation and what I think he'll throw."
His recent power surge is virtually unex
plainable. "I'm in a good groove and I've got
a lot of confidence," he said. "The ball looks
real big up there. Recently balls I've hit well
have been going over, but I haven't con
sciously done anything."
The home runs aren't what pleases
Solomon the most, however. His favorite
play came during the late innings of a game
against the California Golden Bears. With
the score tied, he threw out a man trying to
go from first to third on a single to right
field. The Cardinal eventually lost the game,
but Solomon remembers this play as the
biggest moment of his season.
"It was a big lift at the time," he said of
the throw. "That throw kept the winning
run from reaching third. A homerun is
something everyone sees, but no one sees
the assist unless they were there. That's
what I get the most satisfaction from per
sonally, coming through in a big situation."
Solomon will undoubtedly be facing some
big situations when the Cardinal meets Cal
in a three-game series this weekend. Whoev
er wins the series will be given a place in the
NCAA Regional Tournament.
"Our goal at the beginning of the season
was postseason play, and it's still our goal,"
he said.
When he steps to the plate this weekend,
he will keep in mind a simple philosophy
that he picked up once from his hitting
coach when he was in a slump. "I remember
those words, and ever since, things have
worked out," Solomon said. What were
those words again?
"Just swing hard."
