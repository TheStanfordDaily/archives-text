# The 						legitimacy of the links: Golf passes athletic litmus test
## 
### 
Is golf really a sport? I mean, it doesn't
exactly fit the classical, traditional defi
nition of the word, does it? It doesn't
have a group of athletes lining up across
from one another on the field and duking it
out. There aren't any bone-crushing hits or

high-flying, death-defying, 360 degree slam
dunks. There are no crosscourt volleys or
pitches that barely nick the outside corner
of the plate for a strike. So why do we group
golf with these other things and call it a
sport?
Any lingering doubts I might have had
about golf being a true athletic endeavor

were blown away this weekend when I
watched the Stanford women's golf team
play in the California Collegiate Tourna
ment at the Stanford Golf Course. What
these people do is certainly athletic, just
in a different sense. Competitive golfers
are athletes not because they astound
audiences with sheer physical ability, but
because they are finesse athletes. They
have control — they have the ability to
hit the.ball exactly where they want it to
go, with several obstacles in the way.
No other sport requires someone to
keep his or her level of intensity and con
centration so high for four-and-a-half to
five hours at a time. In football or even
basketball, a player can go to the bench for
a rest, but a golfer can't just wave to the
coach on the sidelines and ask for a break.
When a he or she carries his or her clubs
out to the first tee, the concentration level
can't dip again until the ball falls into the
hole on the 18th. Walking for over 7,000
yards with a bag of clubs on your back in
80-plus degree weather can really drain

someone, and the women played 36 holes
Monday — they were on the course almost
nonstop from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Staying
focused under those conditions is difficult.
An argument can be made that a golfer
spends a majority of the time walking,
standing and thinking — little time is
spent making actual contact with the ball.
But the point to be made here is that he or
she must keep his or her concentration up
and avoid distractions. Walking along a
beautiful course, a golfer must remain
focused on the game; a basketball player
can flop down on a bench and relax.
Another reason a golfer can't afford to let
down is that his or her swing has to remain
perfectly consistent; golf is the ultimate
sport for requiring a steady motion swing
after swing. Any little change can send the
ball snap-hooking off into the trees, and the
score will begin to skyrocket. Golfers can't
smash the ball with all their might each
time. Success doesn't depend on physical
prowess; rather the player who maintains a
consistent swing will come out on top. It is

impossible to attain perfection, so the golfer
must reach instead for consistency.
Parallels can be drawn between golf and
other sports. A lineman will tell you that
nothing can compare to the feeling of lay
ing a thunderous hit on a quarterback. It's
power and force combined with success
that gives an athlete that euphoric feeling.
The same thing holds true when a golfer
crushes a drive. It's like a batter hitting the
ball right on the sweet spot of the bat and
sending it 460 feet over the right field wall.
As in other sports, spectators can have
an effect in golf too. Even 30 people
yelling and applauding a great putt on
the final hole can give a golfer quite a
rush. And just imagine the feeling of
John Daly as he marched up the 18th
fairway at the PGA Championships last
year. It makes a golfer's skin tingle.
Now golf is a friendly sport, so no one is
going to get in another player's face and
yell obscenities when he or she shanks a
shot into the water. Most of the golfers
talk among themselves in between shots

and holes. There isn't the direct competi
tion of other events, and maybe that's why
few people consider it a legitimate sport.
It's a different kind of competition — the
player against the course as he or she tries
to beat par. The game is also unique because
it pits one person against a field of competi
tors. There is a kind of indirect battle going
on between playing partners also; one play
er's concentration can be ruined if another
golfer gets out of trouble in a sandtrap, finds
the green and drains a 30-foot putt for par.
That kind of shot has the same mental
impact as when a team completes a long
bomb for a touchdown or makes a buzzer
beating shot — it gives the player a leg up in
the mental struggle.
So don't write off golf as a nonsport or
a leisurely activity for the country club
folk. Although it is a different kind of
game, it is still a sport that requires an
amazing amount of skill. Stanford's
men's and women's golf teams have some
pretty incredible athletes and should be
congratulated.

An argument can be made that a golfer
spends a majority of the time walking,
standing and thinking — little time is
spent making actual contact with the ball.
But the point to be made here is that he or
she must keep his or her concentration up
and avoid distractions. Walking along a
beautiful course, a golfer must remain
focused on the game; a basketball player
can flop down on a bench and relax.
Another reason a golfer can't afford to let
down is that his or her swing has to remain
perfectly consistent; golf is the ultimate
sport for requiring a steady motion swing
after swing. Any little change can send the
ball snap-hooking off into the trees, and the
score will begin to skyrocket. Golfers can't
smash the ball with all their might each
time. Success doesn't depend on physical
prowess; rather the player who maintains a
consistent swing will come out on top. It is

impossible to attain perfection, so the golfer
must reach instead for consistency.
Parallels can be drawn between golf and
other sports. A lineman will tell you that
nothing can compare to the feeling of lay
ing a thunderous hit on a quarterback. It's
power and force combined with success
that gives an athlete that euphoric feeling.
The same thing holds true when a golfer
crushes a drive. It's like a batter hitting the
ball right on the sweet spot of the bat and
sending it 460 feet over the right field wall.
As in other sports, spectators can have
an effect in golf too. Even 30 people
yelling and applauding a great putt on
the final hole can give a golfer quite a
rush. And just imagine the feeling of
John Daly as he marched up the 18th
fairway at the PGA Championships last
year. It makes a golfer's skin tingle.
Now golf is a friendly sport, so no one is
going to get in another player's face and
yell obscenities when he or she shanks a
shot into the water. Most of the golfers
talk among themselves in between shots

and holes. There isn't the direct competi
tion of other events, and maybe that's why
few people consider it a legitimate sport.
It's a different kind of competition — the
player against the course as he or she tries
to beat par. The game is also unique because
it pits one person against a field of competi
tors. There is a kind of indirect battle going
on between playing partners also; one play
er's concentration can be ruined if another
golfer gets out of trouble in a sandtrap, finds
the green and drains a 30-foot putt for par.
That kind of shot has the same mental
impact as when a team completes a long
bomb for a touchdown or makes a buzzer
beating shot — it gives the player a leg up in
the mental struggle.
So don't write off golf as a nonsport or
a leisurely activity for the country club
folk. Although it is a different kind of
game, it is still a sport that requires an
amazing amount of skill. Stanford's
men's and women's golf teams have some
pretty incredible athletes and should be
congratulated.
