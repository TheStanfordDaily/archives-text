# Keeping things in perspective
## World-class sprinter Chryste Gaines a pre-med at heart 
### Nick Clements Staff writer 
Chryste Gaines is a sprinter. She won the
Texas State Championship in the 200-meter
dash when she was a freshman. She is one of
the top 100-meter sprinters of all time in
the Pacific 10 Conference, one of the best
track and field conferences in the country.
She is favored to win the NCAA Champi
onships in the 100-meter dash after blowing
away the competition a couple weeks ago at
Penn.
"The bigger the meet, the better she com
petes," said Stanford head track and field
coach Brooks Johnson. "She's a competitor."
Chryste Gaines also happens to be a stu
dent. She is majoring in human biology. She
will attend medical school, although she is not
sure when right now.
She tutors students in her spare time. She
thinks she might like to be a pediatrician some
day.
"I love little kids," she said. "I've thought
about teaching, since I've done a lot of tutor
ing."
In an age when athletes who graduate col
lege are seen as the exception and not the rule
by fans and media alike, Gaines has proved
that the phrase "student-athlete" does not
have to be an oxymoron.
"Let's put it this way," Johnson said. "In
track and field you get a bunch of teenagers
running around with half their clothes off.
How important is that in the grand scheme of

things?
"If Chryste doesn't win an Olympic medal,
there will still be such a thing as AIDS ...
there will still be world hunger."
Although Gaines admits that the rigors of
the Stanford premedical core have been
straining at times, her performance has any
thing but diminished on the track as she
winds down her senior year.
A multi-talented athlete who also played
basketball and volleyball in high school,
Gaines came to Stanford with a hamstring
problem that prevented her from training
hard in her top event, the 200-meters.
As a result, she switched to the 100-meter
dash, which is less demanding. By the end of
her freshman year Gaines had set the fresh
man records in both the 100- and 200-meters
with respective times of 11.44 and 24.0 sec
onds.
After winning the Pac-10 100-meter title
her sophomore year, Gaines repeated the feat
last year and went on to take third in the
NCAAs in a wind-aided time of 11.11 sec
onds.
In mid-March Gaines and fellow resident
superstar Jackie Edwards travelled to Indi
anapolis and singlehandedly gave Stanford
women a second place finish in the NCAA
Indoor Championships. Gaines won the 55-
meter dash as she established herself as the
sprinter to beat this year.
Gaines does not lose often. "I don't like to
lose," she said, although she did finish in a
dead heat with USC's Inger Miller in the 100-

meter dash earlier this season in Los Angeles.
Gaines came back to easily defeat Miller at the
Stanford Invite.
Recently, Gaines won the 100-meters at the
Penn Relays, running a school-record 11.17
seconds as she blew away the rest of the field.
Right now Gaines has three meets on her
mind; the Pac-10 Championships in late May
(held in Oregon), the NCAA Championships in
early June (held in Austin, Texas) and the
Olympic Trials in late June (held in New
Orleans). She hopes to qualify for the 100, 200
and the 4XIOO relay team.
"If I'm healthy, I should make the team,"
she said.
If Gaines makes the Olympic team and
travels to Barcelona this summer, she will
hardly be a stranger to Europe. She ran in the
Eight Nations meet in Italy her sophomore
year, placing fifth in the 100-meter dash. Last
summer at the World University Games in
London, Gaines took first in the 100-meters
and also ran on the winning 4XIOO-meter
relay team.
Johnson attributes Gaines* success to her
ability to listen and adapt.
"There are a lot of people who have had the
success she had in high school who aren't will
ing to listen when they get to college," he said.
"She's definitely got her head screwed on
straight. She has a good idea where she's
heading."
All the way to Barcelona, hopefully. But if
she doesn't make it, Dr. Gaines still has a nice
ring to it.

If Gaines makes the Olympic team and
travels to Barcelona this summer, she will
hardly be a stranger to Europe. She ran in the
Eight Nations meet in Italy her sophomore
year, placing fifth in the 100-meter dash. Last
summer at the World University Games in
London, Gaines took first in the 100-meters
and also ran on the winning 4XIOO-meter
relay team.
Johnson attributes Gaines* success to her
ability to listen and adapt.
"There are a lot of people who have had the
success she had in high school who aren't will
ing to listen when they get to college," he said.
"She's definitely got her head screwed on
straight. She has a good idea where she's
heading."
All the way to Barcelona, hopefully. But if
she doesn't make it, Dr. Gaines still has a nice
ring to it.
