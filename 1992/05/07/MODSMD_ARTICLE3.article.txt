School of Earth Sciences officials plan to merge
Applied Earth Sciences and Geology into a single
department, but critics say the change will hurt
the programs without saving much money.
The creation of the new department in 1993 —
tentatively called "Geological and Environmental
Sciences" — is "90 percent sure" to happen,
according to Ruth Sloan, the school's associate
dean for administration.
The plan, which has met with opposition from
several Earth Sciences faculty members, must
first be approved by several University commit
tees, including the Committees on Undergraduate
and Graduate Studies.
Erwin Remson, a professor of applied earth sci
ences, said he strongly opposes the combination of
the departments. "I have invested a great deal of
time in building a successful program," he said. "I
feel it is going to be hurt terribly."
According to Sloan, the idea was first proposed
as part of the school's effort to reduce its budget
by $400,000.
But she said a faculty committee quickly decid
ed that "it wouldn't save a lot of money." Never
theless, the committee retained the idea because
"it made sense administratively," she said.
Sloan estimated that at least 40 percent of fac
ulty members currently have appointments to
both departments. "The combination will be an
administrative improvement," she said.
It will also allow the school to streamline such
processes as admissions and oversight, according
to Applied Earth Sciences Prof. Marco Einaudi.
"The idea has actually been around for a
decade," said Einaudi, who chaired the faculty
committee. "I've maintained all along that the
idea driving this proposal was not to save money,
but rather that we would benefit intellectually.
"Perhaps the idea that the applied sciences
couldn't flourish in traditional departments was
tenable in the past, but that's no longer true,"
Einaudi said. "Departments change with the
times."
However, Remson maintained that combining
the programs would be detrimental.
"I think it's going to kill off a lot of our pro
grams," he said.
"Applied Earth Sciences has been very success
ful in everything. ... It is well respected interna-
