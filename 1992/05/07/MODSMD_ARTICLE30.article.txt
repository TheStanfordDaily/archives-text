## Whirl, slide or wheel into head-spinning amusement

THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY.

The Bay Area provides a wealth of activities for the
academic with limited time hoping to squeeze in an
occasional day of fun and frolic.
Unfortunately, while looking for things to do off
campus, obvious choices like amusement parks often
get overlooked as trivial, adolescent or brainless. They
may be, but they're also the ideal sort of entertainment
to get lost in —after all, they present a perfect oppor
tunity to drop the books and hit the roller coasters.
Malibu Castle and Fun Center
For the thrill seeker with only a few hours to spare,
Malibu Castle and Fun Center, located off Flighway
101 in Redwood City, offers two buildings overflow

ing with assorted entertainments.
On the lot of the main building, the Castle, are
three miniature golf courses, a large batting cage, a
mini bumper-car track and an arcade stocked with
the latest video game hits.
The Malibu Fun Center, also equipped with an
arcade and eating concession, is the home of a mini
raceway, where performance car enthusiasts can try
their hand at racing Formula One race car replicas.
Though slightly cramped for taller patrons, speeding
around the modestly difficult track delivers a wel
come feeling of exhilaration.
While standard gear includes a racing helmet and
t,he purchase of a special driving license, pushing the
replica to its limit seldom places the driver in any real

jeopardy — at worst a momentary
loss of control.
Only a 15-minute drive from the
Stanford campus, Malibu Castle
Fun and Games Center is the ideal
place to burn off mid-week steam.
Open daily from 10 a.m. to 10
p.m., it's also the most accessible.
Great America
Twenty minutes south of cam
pus lies Northern California's
largest amusement park. Located
in Santa Clara, Great America is a
Six Flags style, 100-acre amuse
ment park complete with all of the
standards.

The prime strip of
beach in front of the
Boardwalk in Santa
Cruz must not be for
gotten.

The most popular of the park's
33 rides are the roller coasters. The
Demon, a monstrous steel-framed
coaster, is the park's most consis
tent winner, boasting a loop-to
loop, a dizzying corkscrew turn and
several drops that are sure to leave
your stomach in your mouth.
Close on the Demon's heels is
the recently added Vortex, a stand
up roller coaster, and the Grizzly, a
massive, creaking, wooden-framed
coaster.
Last but not least is the park's
oldest coaster, the Tidal Wave. Its
concept is basic — a massive loop
connected to a track that reaches
for the heavens at either end. But
don't let its simplicity fool you: the
Tidal Wave more than adequately
meets the expectations of the aver
age thrill seeker.
The park is open on weekends
from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. until May
29, when it will open its doors for
daily operation. Though it is an
average of $10 to $20 more expen
sive than Malibu Castle, a trip to
Great America can often be worth
the money spent.
Raging Waters
With hot days ahead, a trip to
Raging Waters in San Jose offers a
unique method of keeping cool.

Located in Lake Cunningham
Regional Park, the six-acre facility
offers more than 30 water slides
and attractions.
The Great White Shark, the
park's premier slide, is perfect for
those up to the challenge of a truly
savage experience. The Speed
Slide, in contrast, easily appeals to
the "Speed Racer" in everyone.
But if you like your slide
straight and steep, the Rampage,
with its plastic sleds, delivers a
hydroplaning experience seldom
seen at other water parks.
After taming the Shark, relax on
a peaceful tour of the slides'
perimeter provided by the Endless
River. Also, in keeping with the
family nature of the park, Raging
Waters offers the toddler-specific
Wacky Water Works.
Raging Waters will open for the
1992 weekend season on May 16,
but won't open for daily patronage
until June 12. A perfect day outing,
Raging Waters offers a refreshing
alternative to the murky depths of
Lake Lagunita.
Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk
If a pleasant scenic drive is as
important as moderately-priced
thrills, then the Beach Boardwalk,
located in Santa Cruz, is an ideal
excursion. It offers the feel of a
traveling carnival, complete with
great rides, games and food.
While the majority of its rides
successfully entertain, no visit is
complete without at least one trip
on the Giant Dipper, a wooden
roller coaster built in 1924. Great
America's Grizzly may take first
place in overall size, but it comes
nowhere close to rivaling the
excitement and thrill of the senior
coaster.
Another feature of the Board
walk is Neptune's Kingdom, a
massive indoor entertainment
center, complete with a game deck,
video arcade, miniature golf and
historical displays.
And the prime strip of beach in
front of the Boardwalk must not be
forgotten. In many respects, its
importance to the Boardwalk rivals
the Big Dipper's.
Despite its distance from cam
pus, Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk
offers the most solid entertainment
value. Avoiding the expensive
entrance fees of Great America and
Raging Waters — not to mention
the unavoidable dullness of Malibu
Castle's location — it provides a
host of options, never forcing them
down visitors' throats.
