# Wolf howls, whale songs mix with people music
## 
### Andrea Parkes Staff writer 
If you happen to be walking by
Frost Amphitheater on Saturday
night, don't be surprised by the
howls of wolves and whales, the
rhythms of Brazil and Africa, the
music of jazz and symphony
trickling into the night — it's just
the Paul Winter Consort bringing
its unique "Earth Music" to Stan
ford.
The Consort, which consists of
five members playing soprano sax,
cello, flute, piano and percussion,
will perform music from a number
of albums, including "Earth: Voic
es of a Planet" and "Wolf Eyes."
In addition, they will play new
material that has not yet been
recorded. They will also impro
vise, drawing inspiration from
Frost's atmosphere and the Cali
fornia weather.
The Consort plays music "in
celebration of life and the commu
nity of all living beings," Winter
said. He added that his music does
not send a particular message
about the environment, but sim
ply celebrates "the beauty of all
creatures."
Perhaps the most unusual ele
ment in the Consort's music is the
use of animal sounds. Winter said
that including animal voices "is a
way to acknowledge that they are
part of that community and
embrace the broader spectrum of
life."
The animal voices Winter

adopts are ones he has had
direct contact with — the idea
came to him in 1968 when he
first heard the sounds of hump
back whales.
Greenpeace expeditions in the
Pacific gave him more familiarity
with whales, and he got his inspi
ration for wolf howls while living
in northern Minnesota.
Other animal sounds used
include the canyon wren from the
Grand Canyon and the virapuru, a
bird from the Amazon, which
Winter said has "the most amaz
ing song I've ever heard."
Winter has had a varied musi
cal history. He first toured with
the Ringling Brothers Circus
Band, as a saxophonist, when he
was 17. The Paul Winter Sextet,
which he formed in college at
Northwestern, was the first jazz
group to perform at the White
House.
The Paul Winter Consort was
formed in 1967, so that, as Winter
said, he "could explore a broader
texture of sound" in his music.
Since that time the group has
received three Grammy nomina
tions and toured much of the
world.
Two craters on the moon arc
even named after Winter's songs
because astronauts took his
"Road" album with them on the
Apollo 15 spaceflight.
Since 1980, the Consort have
been the artists-in-residence at St.

The highly acclaimed "Earth Music" of Paul Winter Consort focuses on the melodies
of the planet as a whole, rather than merely the sounds of cities.
John the Divine in New York, the
world's largest Gothic cathedral
and a "great acoustic space/' Win
ter said.
The group presents any events
it wants about five times a year,
including celebrations of solstices
and equinoxes.

In 1990, the Consort was com
missioned to create "Earth: Voices
of a Planet" as the centerpiece of
the 20th Anniversary Earth Day
Celebration in New York.
Winter has also received two
awards — the Global 500 Award
and the World Environment Day
Award — in recognition of his
musical contribution to environ
mental awareness.
Winter runs his own Living Music

record label from his farm in Litch
field, Connecticut, where he said he
lives "for the woods and fields."
