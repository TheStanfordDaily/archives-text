This isn't about white guilt. Jews don't have
white guilt. Jews have more kinds of guilt
than you've ever heard of — guilt about
leaving lights on, guilt about breaking large bills,
guilt about eating all the little crumb things off
the Entenmann's doughnuts — they even have
some kind of misplaced guilt about food products
containing yeast. But they don't have white guilt.

This is about violence. It's about revolution.
It's about making real sacrifices. Like wearing
black on hot Friday afternoons.
When I watched the riots on the television in
my well-protected dorm lounge, I had mixed feel
ings. Most of me was repulsed and scared and —
like all the politicians who repeat the same plati
tudes the way Phi Delts respond to an "incident"
— "sickened."
But another part of me — I'm still not sure
which one, but I'm sure it was wearing black —
was excited. This other, more demented part of
me hoped the riots would keep going.
My whole life I had these assumptions about
what I could expect from people. I could expect

Method for America
them to laugh politely at my jokes;
I could expect them to eat pizza
with a knife and fork when they
were with their friends' parents; I
could expect them, even if they were
atheists, to spout short, religious
statements whenever 1 sneezed.
And, most of all, I could expcct
them not to steal armfuls of CDs
and tube socks while police just
stood there and watched.
And this sick part of me got a
vicarious thrill out of watching peo
ple taking power, however twisted
and violent the method might be,
into their own hands.
I liked the anarchy. I liked the
rebellion. And I liked the silly way
people run when they have large
appliances strapped onto their
backs. In some weird way, it was
the America I had always envi
sioned.
I was watching people lose their
jobs, their homes and their lives.
And although I knew I shouldn't
have, I felt good in some weird way.
For a second, I felt free.
I think some of this arose
because I experienced my own sub
urban version of looting — in a very

safe, very white way. Let's see, if I
can just remember. . .
It was the summer after my
freshman year, and the CPPC had
just let me down in a big way. So I
filled out an employment card at
Compact Disc World, and knocked
their socks off by quoting Elway
Blues when they asked about my
past criminal record.
Although I got a kick out of
spending my day memorizing
things like the name of the one
black guy in"The Average White
Band," I hated the job. I knew the
fat guy who owned the store was
doing nothing and making all the
money. And the only thing he gave
me was a big, ugly, yellow pin with
my name on it.
So one day — a day so hot I
thought I was in a Spike Lee movie
— I swiped a couple of discs, shoved
a small wad of cash in my pants
and walked right through the door.
I felt like some suburban teenager
from a Joyce Carol Oates story, hop
ing to get arrested so my wealthy,
divorced father would finally pay
attention to me. But it wasn't like
that. I was just frustrated. ..
All right, so I only get a three for
rebellion. But once I got home and
played my brand new, still hot, copy
of the soundtrack to "The Gradu
ate," I wound up pulling a 30 for lip

sine. And, for me, well, it was a
pretty big moment overall.
So when I watched the riots, I
think that part of me came back.
The part that said, "I don't want to
go to law school. I don't want to get
a nine to five job. I don't even want
to fulfill DR 8."
I liked watching everything fall
to pieces before my eyes. Especially
The Gap. I hate The Gap.
And there were plenty of white
guys like me in San Francisco, run
ning from stores with boxes of, well,
loot. It was like America brought in
a substitute teacher for two days
and no one wanted to pass up the
chance to throw spitballs.
But deep inside, I knew if I had
been in San Francisco, I wouldn't
have taken any pocket-T's, not even
black ones.
Because when I hear a bunch of
white people singing along to that
catchy Tracy Chapman song as it
spins on their 5-disc changer, I have
to take a step back.
I realize that these poor people
who are going to rise up are going
to rise up against me. And they're
not going to be carrying acoustic
guitars.
As much as I may empathize
with the rioting, I still have too
much invested in the system to not
feel relieved at the sight of national

guardsmen in L.A. — though I
question the purpose of camouflage
suits in South Central Los Angeles.
And after seeing all the things I
had once placed so much faith in
fall apart, even just for those two
days, I can't trust them any more.
The people in the inner cities
understand power structures far bet
ter than I do. And although the
romantic trope of La Revolution may
appeal to us, neither I nor Ms. Chap
man is going to be thrilled when the
"poor people" get organized.
Somebody's got to do something
soon, or people are going to stop
asking "Why are they burning thei r
own cities?" and start building
those "Escape from New York"
walls somewhere right between the
upper West Side and Harlem.
I wonder how much apartments
cost in London and whether or not
they'd like my accent.
Hey, they went for Terry
Gilliam.

My whole life I had these assumptions about
what I could expect from people. I could expect

them to laugh politely at my jokes;
I could expect them to eat pizza
with a knife and fork when they
were with their friends' parents; I
could expect them, even if they were
atheists, to spout short, religious
statements whenever 1 sneezed.
And, most of all, I could expcct
them not to steal armfuls of CDs
and tube socks while police just
stood there and watched.
And this sick part of me got a
vicarious thrill out of watching peo
ple taking power, however twisted
and violent the method might be,
into their own hands.
I liked the anarchy. I liked the
rebellion. And I liked the silly way
people run when they have large
appliances strapped onto their
backs. In some weird way, it was
the America I had always envi
sioned.
I was watching people lose their
jobs, their homes and their lives.
And although I knew I shouldn't
have, I felt good in some weird way.
For a second, I felt free.
I think some of this arose
because I experienced my own sub
urban version of looting — in a very

safe, very white way. Let's see, if I
can just remember. . .
It was the summer after my
freshman year, and the CPPC had
just let me down in a big way. So I
filled out an employment card at
Compact Disc World, and knocked
their socks off by quoting Elway
Blues when they asked about my
past criminal record.
Although I got a kick out of
spending my day memorizing
things like the name of the one
black guy in"The Average White
Band," I hated the job. I knew the
fat guy who owned the store was
doing nothing and making all the
money. And the only thing he gave
me was a big, ugly, yellow pin with
my name on it.
So one day — a day so hot I
thought I was in a Spike Lee movie
— I swiped a couple of discs, shoved
a small wad of cash in my pants
and walked right through the door.
I felt like some suburban teenager
from a Joyce Carol Oates story, hop
ing to get arrested so my wealthy,
divorced father would finally pay
attention to me. But it wasn't like
that. I was just frustrated. ..
All right, so I only get a three for
rebellion. But once I got home and
played my brand new, still hot, copy
of the soundtrack to "The Gradu
ate," I wound up pulling a 30 for lip

sine. And, for me, well, it was a
pretty big moment overall.
So when I watched the riots, I
think that part of me came back.
The part that said, "I don't want to
go to law school. I don't want to get
a nine to five job. I don't even want
to fulfill DR 8."
I liked watching everything fall
to pieces before my eyes. Especially
The Gap. I hate The Gap.
And there were plenty of white
guys like me in San Francisco, run
ning from stores with boxes of, well,
loot. It was like America brought in
a substitute teacher for two days
and no one wanted to pass up the
chance to throw spitballs.
But deep inside, I knew if I had
been in San Francisco, I wouldn't
have taken any pocket-T's, not even
black ones.
Because when I hear a bunch of
white people singing along to that
catchy Tracy Chapman song as it
spins on their 5-disc changer, I have
to take a step back.
I realize that these poor people
who are going to rise up are going
to rise up against me. And they're
not going to be carrying acoustic
guitars.
As much as I may empathize
with the rioting, I still have too
much invested in the system to not
feel relieved at the sight of national

guardsmen in L.A. — though I
question the purpose of camouflage
suits in South Central Los Angeles.
And after seeing all the things I
had once placed so much faith in
fall apart, even just for those two
days, I can't trust them any more.
The people in the inner cities
understand power structures far bet
ter than I do. And although the
romantic trope of La Revolution may
appeal to us, neither I nor Ms. Chap
man is going to be thrilled when the
"poor people" get organized.
Somebody's got to do something
soon, or people are going to stop
asking "Why are they burning thei r
own cities?" and start building
those "Escape from New York"
walls somewhere right between the
upper West Side and Harlem.
I wonder how much apartments
cost in London and whether or not
they'd like my accent.
Hey, they went for Terry
Gilliam.

Joel Stein thinks this "Rafe" guy
should clean up after himself. His
column will appear here weekly
unless people don't show up and vol
unteer at the Special Olympics this
Saturday afternoon at deGuerre, in
which case he'll be tcx) sad to write.
He does not normally rent this
space out.
This isn't about white guilt. Jews don't have
white guilt. Jews have more kinds of guilt
than you've ever heard of — guilt about
leaving lights on, guilt about breaking large bills,
guilt about eating all the little crumb things off
the Entenmann's doughnuts — they even have
some kind of misplaced guilt about food products
containing yeast. But they don't have white guilt.

This is about violence. It's about revolution.
It's about making real sacrifices. Like wearing
black on hot Friday afternoons.
When I watched the riots on the television in
my well-protected dorm lounge, I had mixed feel
ings. Most of me was repulsed and scared and —
like all the politicians who repeat the same plati
tudes the way Phi Delts respond to an "incident"
— "sickened."
But another part of me — I'm still not sure
which one, but I'm sure it was wearing black —
was excited. This other, more demented part of
me hoped the riots would keep going.

what I could expect from people. I could expect
