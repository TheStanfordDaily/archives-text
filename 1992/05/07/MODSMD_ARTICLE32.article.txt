# It don't sound much like a whisper to me

This isn't about white guilt. Jews don't have
white guilt. Jews have more kinds of guilt
than you've ever heard of — guilt about
leaving lights on, guilt about breaking large bills,
guilt about eating all the little crumb things off
the Entenmann's doughnuts — they even have
some kind of misplaced guilt about food products
containing yeast. But they don't have white guilt.

This is about violence. It's about revolution.
It's about making real sacrifices. Like wearing
black on hot Friday afternoons.
When I watched the riots on the television in
my well-protected dorm lounge, I had mixed feel
ings. Most of me was repulsed and scared and —
like all the politicians who repeat the same plati
tudes the way Phi Delts respond to an "incident"
— "sickened."
But another part of me — I'm still not sure
which one, but I'm sure it was wearing black —
was excited. This other, more demented part of
me hoped the riots would keep going.
My whole life I had these assumptions about
what I could expect from people. I could expect
