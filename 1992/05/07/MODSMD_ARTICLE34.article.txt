# Local 'death metal' group thrashes out growing Bay Area reputation, audience
## 
### Eric Keppler Staff writer 
When a friend of mine heard Erik Moggridge
and the rest of his band, Epidemic, thrashing
away on their latest demo, he compared it to a
milkshake that has so many ingredients that
you can't taste any of them.
You certainly can't taste any melody in Epi
demic's music. Which is fine with lead guitarist
Erik Moggridge.
Epidemic plays what Moggridge refers to as
"death metal," which in this case is comprised
of very percussive, fast guitars and bass, relent
less double-bass drumming, and growling,
angry lyrics. All you taste is "straight-up aggres
sion," Moggridge explains. "We aren't too con
cerned with melody."
You may know Moggridge as "the guy who
works in The Store" in Tresidder, after his
appearance in Gaieties in the fall of 1990.
Moggridge laughs when he thinks about
that. "Yeah, well I kept hearing these rumors
that they were going to come and ask me to play
Axl Rose. I didn't even know what the fuck Gai
eties was." Instead of gyrating around the stage
like Axl, he was merely wheeled out on a cart.
But that was sufficient to make him into a sort
of cult figure on campus.
In fact, if you know Moggridge, it's probably
from his brief foray as an actor. Which is kind
of funny, since he's a hell of a lot better at play
ing the guitar. I asked if he thought there were
very many Stanford students who were into the
death-metal scene. "Well, actually, I think I
know all four of them," he says.
Outside of Stanford, though, Epidemic has
managed to carve out a pretty substantial base
of fan support for themselves in the Bay Area
music scene. Their latest demo, "Extremities

'91," has sold something like 3,500 copies, and
they were just signed by Metal Blade Records,
which means they can finally start making
some money. "Not that I don't like working at
The Store," Moggridge says.

You have to be pretty good musicians to pull
off death metal, and Epidemic are certainly
that. The guitars and bass are nimble and solid,
drummer Bob Cochran is utterly thunderous,
and lead vocalist Carl Fulli sounds really pissed
off about something, which of course is the
desired effect.
Fulli sounds kind of like a cross between
James Hetfield of Metallica and the guy from Sui
cidal Tendencies. Remember the song "Institu
tionalized"? Remember the really fast, complete
ly indecipherable vocal part? Imagine someone
singing that about four octaves lower and you'll
have some idea of what the lyrics sound like.
The only drawback to Fulli's vocals is that
he is so mad that you can't really tell what he is
saying, obscuring some really good lyrics, most
of which were written by Moggridge, and most
of which also sound, well, kind of mad.
Why death metal? "I don't consider myself a
pissed off person," Moggridge says."I just find
morbid, dark things more interesting." He
smiles and takes a bite out of one of those fake
turkey sandwiches they sell at The Store. It's
kind of hard to imagine such a good-natured
guy getting as worked up as Epidemic does.
I guess that's the point of death-metal,
though — a release. And frankly, I'd much rather
listen to this stuff than some of the overpolished,
boring classic rock coming out these days.
Epidemic's followers tend to "slam around
like idiots," Moggridge says with a grin. So if
you ever need a serious release of aggressive
energy, this is a good band to check out.

Epidemic will play at the Stone in San Fran
cisco on Tuesday, May 12, with the Swedish
band Entombed. Tickets can be purchased for
$8 from the band members themselves. Phone
Eric at 327-5450 for more information.

Although he plays guitar for Epidemic, Erik
Moggridge might be more familiar to you as
the friendly face behind the counter in
Tresidder Express.
