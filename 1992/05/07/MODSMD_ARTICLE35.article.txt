## Even technophobes go 'techie' at Tech 
### Ed Heinemann Staff writer 
For the hopelessly fuzzy,
there isn't much anyone can do
to explain anything more tech
nologically advanced than a sta
pler. Mr. Wizard tries, and VTSS
51-52-53 valiantly provides
remedial ed for Stanford's right
brained crowd, but they just
can't bridge the formidable cul
ture gap between Rimbaud and
read-only memory.

Most of the interac
tive exhibits seem
aimed at the Ninja
Turtle set, but that
doesn't dim their
allure for older folk.

The Tech Museum of Inno
vation in San Jose recognizes
that gap, and because it doesn't
waste its efforts trying to jump
across it all at once, it comes as
close as can be hoped to making
technology understandable —
and interesting — for the
technophobic.
The display out front pro
vides the first clue that the Tech,
as it's called, is going to be a lit
tle more than a collection of
IBM punch cards.
A 20-foot-high kinetic sculp
ture, which consists of about 30
billiard balls whizzing along
metal tracks and performing var
ious acrobatic feats, sucks in
kids and adults alike. Passers-by
routinely gawk at the contrap
tion for 10 minutes or more —
and many go inside to see what
else the museum has to offer.
The Tech superficially resem
bles the Exploratorium in San

Francisco in its emphasis on
interactive exhibits, but its focus
is much narrower than the
Exploratorium's attempt to
explain all things scientific. The
Tech, which started as a muse
um to commemorate the inno
vations that spawned Silicon
Valley, is interested in comput
ers and their various offspring,
and the theme makes for a fasci
nating couple of hours.
The Tech seems to operate
on the principle that making
computers and robotics — and
learning — fun is more likely to
erode resistance to them than
being didactic, and in that it suc
ceeds admirably.
At one exhibit, a robot spells
out your name with wooden
blocks. At others, you can take a
high-speed computer-guided
tour of the surface of Mars, use a
robot arm to manipulate various
objects, or design a bicycle and
print a color copy of your
blueprint.
Most of the interactive exhibits
seem aimed at the Ninja Turtle
set, but that doesn't dim their
allure for older folk. I had to
throw a few elbows at 45-year
olds to get a chance to use an
earthquake simulator that lets
you design your own building —
then design your own quake and
watch the building sway, or
crumble to the ground.
For the less interactive
exhibits, the Tech relies on
homey, but entertaining, narra
tives to communicate to the
technologically dysfunctional.
A wall describing the use of
computers in biological engi
neering tells the story of John, a
little boy born without adequate
Human Growth Hormone, and
how computers helped him grow
to normal size. A robot exhibit,
