# Timely 'Our Country' more than just good
## 
### David Goldenberg Staff writer 
Seeing "Our Country's Good/'
the Ram's Head special project
running tonight through Saturday
in Ricker Dining Center, should
prove to be a good opportunity to
not only see a great play, but also
to think about the events of the
past few weeks.
Though this play, written by
Timberlake Wetenbaker in 1988,
is about Australia in the 18th cen
tury, its story of the attempt of an
English lieutenant to put on a
comedy commemorating the
King's birthday using the convicts
as cast members, makes it rele
vant to anyone thinking about jus
tice.

Director len Derwingson, a
senior, originally proposed the
play to Ram's Head in the fall in
order to make a statement about
the power of the theater to trans
form all who come in contact with
it.
But Derwingson and cast mem
bers said they were pleased that
the play's other themes of racism,
domination and torture will allow
them to raise pertinent questions
not only about the Rodney King
verdict, but also about the recent
execution of Robert Alton Harris.
"When I decided to do this play,
it was in protest of the budget cuts
to the Drama Department," Der
wingson said. But she added that
the events of the past week will
transform the play into a larger

statement to spark debate and
communication about the possi
ble solutions that the arts can pro
vide for social ills.
Cast members said they were
excited about the play's timing.
Vince Ricci, a senior, said it will
show the relevance of the arts to
discussion about moral issues.
"Morality is not made in the polit
ical process," he said, "but by
artistic experiences."
Senior Kari Rosenthal, another
cast member, said she hopes "peo
ple think long and hard about this
true story of 1788 and how it
applies to them today."
But this play is not only for
people who are looking for a new
forum to discuss recent events. It
is also a rare opportunity to see a

type of performance not usually
given at Stanford.
The play is performed in the
"presentational style," which Der
wingson said has rarely been used
for Stanford productions. Der
wingson said the play makes a
conscious attempt not to perform
in period costume or to have real
istic sets, and there is no "fourth
wall" between the audience and
the actors.
The play is meant to engage the
audience intellectually as well as
emotionally.
The idea is for the audience not
to leave just having laughed or
cried, but knowing why they
laughed or cried because they have
just been in a "dialogue" with the
actors about what is going on in
the play.
Another unique aspect of the
play's production is its attempt to
incorporate its theme of creating
an understanding between social
classes into the structure of the
play itself.
The play is designed so that
many actors play the parts of both
a convict and an officer.
This should have a probing
effect on the audience, and the
extreme case of Ricci, who plays
an officer in charge of hangings
as well as a bumbling old man,
should be particularly interest
ing.
"I basically lose my mind and
then have to be a funny old guy,"
he said, referring to two scenes
that he must do back-to-back in
the second act.
Watching these transforma
tions should be as hard for the
audience as it is for the actors, and
should prove interesting for view
ers.
"Our Country's Good" won't
be a typical Ram's Head produc
tion. Theatergoers may even come
away wanting to act differently
toward their fellow human beings.

"Our Country's Good" runs
tonight through Saturday at 8
p.m. in Ricker Dining Center.
Student tickets are $5 in White
Plaza, or call 723-0801.
