## The
						diseased pariah, The Dead Guy and the blizzard paperweight 
### Jake Veylupek 
Late June, Wulf and I struggled
to maneuver his futon out of the
dingy flat he had to vacate by noon.
The narrow staircase angled
sharply at one point, and I had no
idea how he planned to get the bed
down to the truck double-parked on
the street below.
It was staircases like this in
buildings like these that caused me
to hate this part of the City, and I
thought Wulf was smart to be mov
ing in with me down on the Penin
sula, regardless of the romance or
necessity involved.
I enjoyed spending the night and
waking morning with him, but
wasn't thrilled that it was now just
the two of us trying to move him
out, mc not particularly brawny
and him being sick and all.
"And why couldn't you get one
of your many admirers to help out
this morning?" I asked, feeling the
pinch of time and fearing that
either Wulf or I was about to drop
the bedding to the street below. Not
that 1 would have minded the
short-cut.
Wulf waited until he had the
futon securely tied into the pickup
before answering, "Tommy's sup
posed to stop by the new house to
help unload, and I've already used
up enough favors from everybody
else this month." Then he added, "I
didn't wear you out, did I?"
Eager to prove that I could play a
convincing butch, I bolted up the
stairs to grab the next piece.
After we loaded the truck, Wulf
pushed the dirty blond bangs off his

sweaty forehead and puffed, "I
think I'll let you drive. You need the
experience with a stick. Besides,
The Dead Guy would rather sit in
my lap for the ride down — that
used to be his favorite spot, after
all."
I didn't think it was a great idea
to flirt with the goddess of manual
transmission in an overloaded, bor
rowed truck on steep city streets,
but figured that Wulf might need to
rest during the ride. For a supposed
ly informed man, I often felt damn

ignorant about the disease, and
here was another good example of
why.
I didn't know how far Wulf
should push his strength, or if that
was an issue this early on. I didn't
know if it would keep Wulf from
wanting another relationship after
The Dead Guy, or how long he
even had left before he would be
dead too.
I didn't know what it would be
like to live with somebody who was
positive, or why the disease made

him more irresistible to me. I won
dered if Wulf thought he needed me
like I thought I needed him. I didn't
know if they would call what we
had just done "safe sex."
The truck stalled twice along the
way, once with a series of lurches at
a busy intersection, unsettling a
box of clothes in the back and near
ly causing Wulf to spill The Dead
Guy's ashes. An officer on a motor
cycle nearby waved her finger at the
pickup and smiled.
"Just your luck," Wulf said.
"Only one person waves at you in
the gayest city there is, and that's a
she-cop."
"Yeah, but it's your jock strap
hanging off the tailgate that got her
attention." I didn't know how else
to respond. I had thought Wulf and
I would get over teasing one anoth
er, but humor seemed to be his way
of dealing with everything.
It was along those lines that he
and The Dead Guy had started Dis
eased Pariah News, their HIV
humor magazine, years ago. (Along
with The Dead Guy's cremation
came a change in title from 'Trusty
Editor' to 'Dusty Deaditor').
Wulf's name was his own cre
ation as well, and when I had asked
him why he changed it from Jack
all he would say was that he didn't
like a first name which fell between
'e' and 'ulate.' Other than that I'd
never know, because he was Wulf,
the six foot, green-eyed, devilish
diseased pariah long before I ever
met him.
Tom was already waiting at the
house by the time the truck jerked
into the driveway. Wulf greeted

him, "Tommy, you should know
we would arrive fashionably late.
You have any trouble finding the
place?"
"Yeah, you fags give about as
good directions as you drive," he
replied, smiling at me with an
expression about as fake as his dye
job. I turned to open the garage
door as Wulf kissed his friend hello.

'The Dead Guy would
rather sit in my lap
for the ride down —
that used to be his
favorite spot, after
all.'

I was glad to have the help moving
Wulf in, but I hoped his friend
wouldn't take this as an invitation
to come over any too often.
The Dead Guy was placed atop
the refrigerator and followed in by
the furniture he had bought five
months after he was told he only
had half a year to live. Before he
died he planned to furnish his and
Wulf's flat using the MasterCard
his credit union was too dumb to
cancel, and to stick them with the
cost of Wulf's inheritance.
He then lived another four years
and ended up paying for most of the
purchases anyway. Life had been
cruel to him in that way.
The set of speakers Tom was
carrying in reminded him, "I want

The Dead Guy's stereo when Wulf
kicks off. I helped her flirt with that
scumball at Macy's to get the floor
model, so it morally belongs to
me."
I didn't care for the way Tom
always called our gay friends "her"
and "she."
Tom and I bequeathed ourselves
most of the possessions as we
moved them into the back bed
room. When Wulf said that the box
o' porn should go to somebody dis
eased, Tom smirked at me. He too
was a diseased pariah.
When all else was moved in,
Wulf carried in The Dead Guy
from the kitchen and placed him
on his yet-to-be-assembled desk.
"What are you ever going to do
with him?" Tom asked.
"Not sure," Wulf said. "I was
thinking of maybe suspending the
ashes in glass paperweights and
giving those to the original sub
scribers of 'DPN.'"
Tom took the heavy, transpar
ent plastic bag out of its cardboard
box and held The Dead Guy up to
the sunlight. I recalled Wulf's earli
er plan to use the ground bits of
charred bone and teeth as snow in
some of those holiday toys one
shakes up to make a blizzard blow
all about the encapsulated scene.
I didn't remind him of it, howev
er; I liked the idea and wanted to
use it later myself, when I had Wulf
to dispose of. The thought comfort
ed me, that I could make Wulf a
surrounding presence about my
house, swirling all around me
whenever I got the urge to shake
him up a bit.
