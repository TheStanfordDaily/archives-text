## Artistic Irish 'Playboys' charms 
### Kiri Zooper 
"The Playboys" is another in a
series of wonderful Irish films
released in the last few years.
Written by Shane Con
naughton, who wrote "My Left
Foot," "The Playboys" traces a few
weeks in the life of Tara McGuire
(Robin Wright of "The Princess

Bride"), a fiery young woman in a
small village who, much to the
affront of the rigid community
around her, refuses to name the
father of her illegitimate child.
The town constable, Brenden
Hegarty (Albert Finney), begs Tara
to marry him, but she refuses,
insisting she has no feelings for
him. In the midst of the fray, the

Playboys, a traveling troupe of
actors, come to town and set up on
the village green. With them
comes lovable Tom Cassidy
(Aidan Quinn).
Determined to keep men and
their expectations from shaping
her life, Tara initially refuses to
take notice of Tom, but warms to
him when he shows affection for
her baby. A romance follows, but
is imperiled when Sergeant Hegar
t/s jealousy pushes him over the
brink.

Ail excellent cast
wrings every last
drop of emotion
from Connaugh ton's
refreshingly strong
script.

Shot entirely on location in
Redhills, County Cavan, Ireland,
"The Playboys" has the same
freshness audiences loved in "My
Left Foot." Giles MacKinnon has
skillfully directed the film, convey
ing both the beauty and the diffi
culty of rural Irish life. The shot
selection is unpretentious but clas
sic; the cinematography is pic
turesque without being overblown.
An excellent cast wrings every
last drop of emotion from Con
naughton's refreshingly strong
script. Wright submits a very tex
tured and sympathetic perfor
mance; she allows us to participate
in Tara's frustration as she battles
the strong traditions that seek to
control her future.
Finney is by turns pathetic and
terrifying, the tension in his per
formance gathering like storm
clouds until it becomes downright
disturbing. Quinn's Tom Cassidy
is the perfect gypsy â€” rootless,
mysterious and boyishly endear
ing. The supporting members of
the cast, particularly the other
Playboys, do much to enrich the
story.
"The Playboys" is not for the
action-adventure crowd. It is, how
ever, a satisfying artistic film that
lovingly addresses both the joys
and hurts of real life.
