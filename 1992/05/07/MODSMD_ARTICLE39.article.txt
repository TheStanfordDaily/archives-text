# 'K2' makes for high-altitude fun
## 
### Travis Farr Staff writer 
Mt. Everest eclipses K2 much more in fame than
in height. A mere 800 feet shorter, K2 is widely
acknowledged to be the toughest mountain to climb
in the world. And that is just what drives two
friends to tackle the Himalayan giant in the new
film "K2."
Taylor Brooks (Michael Biehn) is a wild, unre
formed superyuppie, the district attorney of Seattle
who happens to be an avid mountain climber.
His best and only friend is a physics professor
named Harold Jamison (Matt Craven), a man pulled
in all directions by the demands of his family, his
career and his friend's freewheeling plans.
Both have a lifelong dream of climbing K2, so
when an opportunity presents itself, they both agree
— Taylor immediately, and Harold (whom everyone
calls "H") after convincing his wife.
The expedition gets under way, but is marred by
problems with the native porters and a time crunch
that leads to several tragedies. Despite these setbacks,
though, Taylor and H remain determined to reach the
summit.
The biggest potential pitfall this tough-guy high
adventure film faces is that the characters could
become wholly secondary to the action. Fortunately,
the movie is filled out with real people.

You don't find many quiet types clinging to the
sides of the second-tallest mountain in the world, and
the screenplay's writers are aware of that. All of the
climbers are intense and proud, and watching the
cooperation and clashes of these egos and wills gives
the movie an extra dimension that saves it from
falling into mindlessness.
And the characters are not stainless-steel tough
guys. They all have their weaknesses and breaking
points, and they all get scared. The multi-dimension
ality of the characters is a relief, and, considering
what might have been, a pleasant surprise.
Although the minor characters play important
roles, the axis of the film is the friendship between
Taylor and H. These two very different men gradual
ly reveal their strong, if unlikely, friendship to the
audience.
Their relationship is also more complex than it at
first appears. Though initially it seems as if Taylor
simply bullies his friend onto mountain after moun
tain, H later reveals that he has a deep love of moun
tain climbing and that Taylor's bullying is not the
reason he climbs.
The cinematography in K2 is phenomenal. The
filming brilliantly conveys the dual nature of the
mountains as a beautiful natural setting on one hand
and a deadly danger on the other.
All in all, K2, avoiding many possible pitfalls, is an
entertaining and worthwhile movie.
