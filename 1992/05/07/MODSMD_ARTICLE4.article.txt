# Student groups organize effort to aid L.A. families
## 
### M. Scott Walker 
Answering the call for aid in the after
math of the Los Angeles riots, several stu
dent groups have formed an umbrella
organization called the L.A. Relief Fund.
The Relief Fund is primarily geared
toward families affected by the violence
following the Rodney King verdict, said
sophomore Russell Calleros, co-chair of a
student committee attempting to solicit
corporate donations in the Bay Area.
Groups involved in the effort are the
Asian American Students Association, the
Black Student Union, MEChA and the
Stanford American Indian Organization.
Organizers will send proceeds to the
Los Angeles chapter of the Red Cross,
which will distribute the funds to families
affected by the violence, Calleros said.

Total proceeds for the fund so far are
$538.44, according to Calleros. This
amount consists of donations made at a
dance sponsored by MEChA, a
Chicano/Latino student group, last Satur
day. It also includes food sales by MEChA
and the SAIO at the same event.
Organizers will not give the funds to
the Red Cross until they get more money,
Calleros said, so they can send checks in
$500 to $1000 increments.
The students are "uncertain" about
how long the effort will continue, said
Relief Fund coordinator Luz Herrera, a
freshman. Right now, the organization is
looking for "more ideas on how to do
things," she said. "We're trying to get hold
of different schools and organizations."
A Publicity and Education
Committee, made up of members
of the four organizations, has also
been set up to coordinate the
information effort.
Several methods for getting aid
are being considered. A clothing
drive is a probable course of
action, Herrera said. Preliminary
plans have been made for such a
drive, but no specific details are
available yet.
"A lot of things are in the plan

ning stages," she said.
Faculty are also being asked
for funds. Herrera said Frances
Morales, dean of El Centro Chi
cano, sent electronic mail mes
sages to faculty members late yes
terday but has not received any
response yet.
SAIO is also planning to use
its annual powwow this weekend
to help the relief effort. They will
be performing a blanket dance to
raise money for the cause, fresh
man Paula Dvbdahl said.
The new organization also plans
to hold an open meeting at El Cen
tro Chicano at 7 p.m. Monday to dis
cuss ways to distribute the fUnds.
