## Chapman delves into love, conscience 
### Ari Richter Senior staff writer 
Hidden between the ballyhooed return of
Bruce Springsteen and the anticipation of the
upcoming album from the Black Crowes,
Tracy Chapman quietly re-entered the music
scene last week with her third album, "Mat
ters of the Heart."
But for those who cared to notice, it was a
welcome return of the artist whose debut four
years ago instantly created her own niche in
popular music.
The new album's opening track immedi
ately reminds listeners of the strong social
conscience Chapman's songs have given voice
to in the past. Indeed, the first song even brings
with it an air of the prophetic.
Just one day after the album's release, the
verdict in the Rodney King beating case and the
ensuing violence in Los Angeles provided a
frightening real-life backdrop for the album's
opening track, "Bang, Bang, Bang."
As L.A. Police Chief Daryl Gates delayed
efforts to stem the rioting until after it had
spread out of mostly black neighborhoods,
Chapman's song could have been the sound

track: "If he preys only on his neighbors/ Broth
ers, sisters and friends/ We'll consider it a favoi/
We'll consider justice done/ But if he comes for
you and me/ And we can place a gun in his
hand/ Bang, bang, bang/ We'll shoot him
down."
Chapman is clearly comfortable with such
themes, but she occasionally cuts herself off
before having said enough. Indeed, this ten
dency was perhaps the only weakness of her
first album, where songs such as "Talkin'
About a Revolution" and "Why?" suffered only
from not being developed enough.
"Woman's Work," which closes the first
side of the current album, is similarly flawed.
Writing only 10 lines of lyrics, Chapman only
begins to explore the subject, leaving the lis
tener cheated of a fuller discussion. But where
as such truncated efforts were more the rule
than the exception on the debut album,
"Woman's Work" is the only such tease this
time around.
By contrast, "So" offers a completed thought,
in this case reflecting on those who would
"make a little money/ Off of somebody else's
sweat." The persona of a ruthless profiteer that
Chapman creates would even charge people to

rest, if possible: "For you everything has its
price/ You give nothing away for free/ If silence
were truly golden/1 guess no one could sleep."
Yet while Chapman's social conscience
continues to inspire her work, her artistic
impulse appears to be most inclined to explor
ing love. Though, it can probably be said, she
hasn't yet been able to articulate precisely what
she feels.
Over the course of her three albums, the
songs in this realm have been the most inter
esting, even if not the most successful. In par
ticular, two ideas have been crucial for her: the
enormous commitment and sacrifice neces
sary for love to work and the infrequency of
such success.
Like the first album's "For My Lover,"
whose heroine was willing to endure jail for her
beloved, "Open Arms" describes a lover who'll
be there even if "Every corner you turn/ Trou
ble come your way."
But on "The Love That You Had," the
demands of love are too much for one partner,
and the other is left surprised and alone. "Tell
me what hardened your heart/ Tell me what
turned it to stone/ Tell me what made you for
get/ That you were in love with someone."
