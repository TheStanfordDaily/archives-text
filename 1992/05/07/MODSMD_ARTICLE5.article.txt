This time he's not going to pass them by.
Mikhail Gorbachev will finally view a
Hoover Institution exhibit called "A Cen
tury of Revolutions: Lenin to Gorbachev"
after his Frost Amphitheater speech Sat
urday, a display originally assembled for
his 1990 visit.
Due to scheduling difficulties, he was
unable to see the collection or tour Hoover
then.
Former Secretary of State George
Shultz, a distinguished fellow at Hoover,
will be Gorbachev's official host from
breakfast to dinner Saturday. At 12:15
a.m., they will tour the archive display.
Gorbachev and Shultz will also attend

a luncheon with major deans, professors
and University officials, and perhaps
climb to the top of Hoover Tower for a
panoramic view of Stanford.
Items in the "Century of Revolutions"
collection include:
• A 1912 handwritten letter from Lenin to
his comrades in New York to defend the use
of Communist party funds. Both his party
pseudonym "Lenin" and his real name,
Ulianov, were used to sign the document.
• An autographed copy of Mikhail Gor
bachev's book "Perestroika," with an
inscription to Shult^.
• The final draft of the abdication letter
of Tsar Nicolas 11.
• Turn-of-the-century photo files from
