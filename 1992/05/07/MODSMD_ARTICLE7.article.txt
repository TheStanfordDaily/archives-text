# Renamed 558 brings back the memories

Don't let the legwarmers and
feathered hair scare you.
Yes, they may put an Olivia
Newton John shrine over the fire
place next year, but "Xanadu" —
the renamed 558 Mayfield — is
not officially an early '80s theme
house yet.
"It's more of a running joke,"
said junior Jeremy Nelson, who
will be the social director of the
house next year.
Nelson said the pink Xanadu
fliers around campus advertising
the house were not meant to
emphasize the early '80s theme,
but rather to show that 558 May
field is now self-operating and is
changing its image.
The University approved the
house's self-op status last quar
ter, after residents' complaints
about poor food service. The
seven residents who petitioned to
the Row office for the change will
be running the house next year.
"We're not a bunch of disco
freaks," Nelson said. "We just
wanted a name with character."
Nelson said the name change
was meant to increase the
house's popularity, which has
been declining in the last few
years. "My (draw) group got in
with a 1,366" last year, he said.
"That's the worst it's ever had to
go down."
He said that there were "well
over 100 people" at the open house
Mayfield held Tuesday, but added
that he doesn't know if that was a
result of the "Xanadu" fliers.
Junior Alison Callicoatte, one of
the kitchen managers for next year,
said some people have asked her if
they were really serious about the
early '80s theme. "We're not a
theme house," she said. "You don't
have wear corduroy every day."
The house may play early '80s
music and show the movie
"Xanadu" during events, she said,
but the agenda has not been final
ized yet.

There also won't be any theme
associates and residents will not be
required to go to "programs to learn
about the early '80s," Nelson said.
The name "Xanadu" is not offi
cial yet, either, according to junior
Caroline Dehnert, one of next
year's kitchen managers, since no
one has asked the Board of
Trustees to approve the name
change yet. "It may change next
year, if [the new residents] don't
like the name," she said.
They decided on the name
Xanadu for the house because
"we wanted to turn around the
reputation of the house as a bor
ing place," Nelson said. " '558' is
impersonal. It doesn't have much
character."
Callicoatte said some of the
residents were in a store looking
at old records when they ran
across Olivia Newton John's

"Xanadu" album.
"Then everyone started to get
excited about leg warmers and
everything," Callicoatte said.
But Xanadu wasn't the only
choice. It took "months and
months," of going though names
like "Cuckoo's Nest" — which
was rejected because it was too
depressing — before they hit on
Xanadu, Nelson said.
The other suggestions —
including "The Ski Lodge," Taco
Bell," "Byzantium," "I Prefer
Stucco" and"The Long-Haired
Leaping Gnome Dome" — didn't
quite seem to fit.
But though the early '80s will
not dominate the atmosphere of
the house, there will be one con
cession to the theme — "We're all
going to get our hair feathered
like Dorothy Hamill," Dehnert
said.
