# Renamed 558 brings back the memories

Don't let the legwarmers and
feathered hair scare you.
Yes, they may put an Olivia
Newton John shrine over the fire
place next year, but "Xanadu" —
the renamed 558 Mayfield — is
not officially an early '80s theme
house yet.
"It's more of a running joke,"
said junior Jeremy Nelson, who
will be the social director of the
house next year.
Nelson said the pink Xanadu
fliers around campus advertising
the house were not meant to
emphasize the early '80s theme,
but rather to show that 558 May
field is now self-operating and is
changing its image.
The University approved the
house's self-op status last quar
ter, after residents' complaints
about poor food service. The
seven residents who petitioned to
the Row office for the change will
be running the house next year.
"We're not a bunch of disco
freaks," Nelson said. "We just
wanted a name with character."
Nelson said the name change
was meant to increase the
house's popularity, which has
been declining in the last few
years. "My (draw) group got in
with a 1,366" last year, he said.
