'Simon' is born
Simon Yamawaki Shachter, the baby whose
name was decided in a naming contest among
Serra residents, was born Sunday.
Assoc. Engineering Prof. Ross Shachter, a res
ident fellow of the dormitory, said the baby was
born at 10:37 p.m. at Stanford Hospital.
He weighed 7 pounds, 9 ounces and was 20
inches long, Shachter said.
Ruth Yamawaki Shachter, Simon's mother, said
she and Ross chose the name "Simon" — which they
selected as the winner of a dorm naming contest last
month — over their second choice, "Adam."
The name fit the criteria of the naming contest
because it has meaning in both Hebrew and
Japanese, Ruth said, and it "sounds better with
Shachter" well.
"Somehow, he looked more like a Simon than
an Adam," Ruth said. But, she added: "I don't
know, maybe years from now he'll ask, 'Why did
you name me Simon?' "
No lead in blood of campus kids
Blood samples taken from 50 campus children
have shown no elevated levels of lead, according to
Cowell Student Health Center.
Free, voluntary blood tests were offered last
month after campus health and safety inspectors
found paint with lead levels near the federal defi
nition of "lead-containing" in Escondido Village,
where most campus children live.
Results from 46 blood tests showed less that 5
milligrams of lead per deciliter. Cowell officials

said they do not expect the four remaining tests to
reveal elevated blood levels.
A more sensitive test of interior paint samples
has revealed that samples which had originally
tested positive for lead are actually below the fed
eral definition of lead-containing, and tests of soil
and sand at Escondido Village have shown no ele
vated levels of lead.
Hoover fellowships given
Twelve scholars have won the Hoover Institu
tion's annual postdoctoral National and Peace
Fellowships for the 1992-93 academic year.
The fellowships allow scholars to spend one year
at Hoover to conduct independent research on his
torical and public polity issues of the 20th century.
Since its inception in 1971, the program has
awarded more than 280 fellowships to scholars
from universities in the United States and Cana
da. Stanford faculty members have received more
than 10 percent of the awards.
The National fellows are Debra Aron, Peter Boet
tke, Peter Cramton, Peter Demarzo, Avner Greif,
Joseph Grundfest, Gillian Hadfield, Bronwyn Hall,
Constance Meaney, Sule Ozler and George Tsebelis.
Hilton Root is the Peace fellow.
Grant to support journalists
Stanford has been awarded a three-year, $54,500
grant from the Reader's Digest Foundation to fund
scholarships for graduate students in journalism.
Stanford is one of 15 graduate programs cho
sen to receive the grant.
