FONDO DE CULTURA ECONOMICA
BOOK FAIR - MAY 4 - 8
In celebration of Cinco De Mayo and the expansion of our Spanish Language Section by
a new relationship with Fondo De Cultura Economica (FCE), the Bookstore presents a
week-long Book Fair!
Approximately 300 FCE titles have been added to the Spanish Language Section,
bringing the store's total number of Spanish language titles to more than 1,500. The
arrangement with FCE allows the Bookstore access to an additional 4,000 titles in FCE's
stock which can be special ordered and shipped directly from their new San Diego office
and warehouse without international delays.
The FCE collection contains fiction works as well as non-fiction titles on such diverse
subjects as archeology, economics, history, science, and art.
LOOK FOR OUR SPECIAL DISPLAYS & EXPANDED SELECTION OF
FONDO BOOKS.
FREE COPIES OF FCE JOURNALS, "AZTECA" AND "LA GACETA",
WHILE SUPPLIES LAST
ALSO SEE OUR SPANISH LITERATURE & PRE-COLUMBIAN SECTIONS.
SPECIAL APPEARANCE TODAY, MAY 8 AT 12:15
Rodolfo Pataky, Chief Executive Officer of FCE's San Diego branch,
and Rodolfo Figueroa, San Francisco's Mexican Consul, will make a
presentation on the role of FCE in the U.S. and the significance of this
new relationship.
Music and complimentary refreshments will be provided at today's event.
