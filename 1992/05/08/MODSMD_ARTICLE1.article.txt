# Campus prepares for Gorbachev's return
## Lecture at Frost shouldn't pose security problems 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
When Stanford officials prepared for Mikhail
Gorbachev's visit to campus two years ago, they
anticipated a frenetic scene, with Secret Service
and KGB guards securing building tops and
holding back swarming multitudes.
Tomorrow, they're expecting a smaller and
tamer crowd that should present few security
and preparation problems.
A crowd of 10,500 is expected to attend
Gorbachev's speech at Frost Amphitheater,
according to Events and Services manager
Lois Wagner.
Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, will have a pri
vate breakfast with Hoover Distinguished Fel
low George Shultz before the speech. Following
the event, the Gorbachevs will tour an exhibit at
the Hoover Institution and attend a luncheon in
the former Soviet president's honor.
Since Gorbachev is no longer a head of state,

the Secret Service will not handle security for
the visit as it did in 1990, although Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington said the State
Department will provide some security.
There are no plans for Gorbachev to walk
through campus as he did on his first visit,
which will lessen security's responsibility,
Herrington said.
He added that the openness of Frost — as
opposed to Memorial Auditorium, where Gor
bachev gave his speech in 1990 — will not
cause any additional security problems.
"We used Frost during Centennial for both
the President of Mexico and the Prime Minis
ter of Canada and it worked quite well," Her
rington said.
However, Herrington said he expects
protests by Serbian groups over the racist
remarks allegedly made by former Hoover
director W. Glenn Campbell to Serbian visit
ing scholar Srdjan Trifkovic.
"We've talked to the Serbs and their cause is

Glenn Campbell and Hoover," Herrington said.
But he added that the protest will probably not
cause a security problem.
"We expect they'll limit their activity to
lawful protest," he said.
After the speech, the Gorbachevs will walk
with an entourage including faculty and
Hoover fellows to the circle between Memorial
Auditorium and Hoover Tower, where they
will be greeted by a welcoming committee,
according to Hoover Press Relations represen
tative Michele Horaney.
The Gorbachevs will then tour the Hoover
exhibit "A Century of Revolutions: Lenin to
Gorbachev" with archivist Anne Van Camp.
During the tour, a luncheon honoring Gor
bachev will begin in Stauffer Auditorium.
Horaney said close to 100 Stanford faculty and
staff, Hoover fellows and local executives will
attend.

Chairs, chairs and more chairs — approximately 7,500 of them sit in
naked anticipation of former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's
Saturday lecture at Frost Amphitheater.
