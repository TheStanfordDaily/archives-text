# Campus prepares for Gorbachev's return
## Lecture at Frost shouldn't pose security problems 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
When Stanford officials prepared for Mikhail
Gorbachev's visit to campus two years ago, they
anticipated a frenetic scene, with Secret Service
and KGB guards securing building tops and
holding back swarming multitudes.
Tomorrow, they're expecting a smaller and
tamer crowd that should present few security
and preparation problems.
A crowd of 10,500 is expected to attend
Gorbachev's speech at Frost Amphitheater,
according to Events and Services manager
Lois Wagner.
Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, will have a pri
vate breakfast with Hoover Distinguished Fel
low George Shultz before the speech. Following
the event, the Gorbachevs will tour an exhibit at
the Hoover Institution and attend a luncheon in
the former Soviet president's honor.
Since Gorbachev is no longer a head of state,

the Secret Service will not handle security for
the visit as it did in 1990, although Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington said the State
Department will provide some security.
There are no plans for Gorbachev to walk
through campus as he did on his first visit,
which will lessen security's responsibility,
Herrington said.
He added that the openness of Frost — as
opposed to Memorial Auditorium, where Gor
bachev gave his speech in 1990 — will not
cause any additional security problems.
"We used Frost during Centennial for both
the President of Mexico and the Prime Minis
ter of Canada and it worked quite well," Her
rington said.
However, Herrington said he expects
protests by Serbian groups over the racist
remarks allegedly made by former Hoover
director W. Glenn Campbell to Serbian visit
ing scholar Srdjan Trifkovic.
"We've talked to the Serbs and their cause is

Glenn Campbell and Hoover," Herrington said.
But he added that the protest will probably not
cause a security problem.
"We expect they'll limit their activity to
lawful protest," he said.
After the speech, the Gorbachevs will walk
with an entourage including faculty and
Hoover fellows to the circle between Memorial
Auditorium and Hoover Tower, where they
will be greeted by a welcoming committee,
according to Hoover Press Relations represen
tative Michele Horaney.
The Gorbachevs will then tour the Hoover
exhibit "A Century of Revolutions: Lenin to
Gorbachev" with archivist Anne Van Camp.
During the tour, a luncheon honoring Gor
bachev will begin in Stauffer Auditorium.
Horaney said close to 100 Stanford faculty and
staff, Hoover fellows and local executives will
attend.

Chairs, chairs and more chairs — approximately 7,500 of them sit in
naked anticipation of former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's
Saturday lecture at Frost Amphitheater.
After completing the tour, the
Gorbachevs will arrive at the lun
cheon, where they will greet
those attending in a receiving
line.
Musicians George Alexander
and Paul Shabilin will play Rus
sian folk songs following the
lunch. Shultz will introduce Gor
bachev, who will make brief
remarks and accept gifts.
Address to be televised
About 200 journalists are
expected to cover the event, com
pared with 5,000 when the Gor
bachevs first visited, according to
Stanford News Service represen
tative Peter Rapalus.
Although only 24 journalists
were admitted to Gorbachev's
1990 address at Memorial Audi
torium, all 200 will cover
tomorrow's speech, Rapalus
said.
The coverage will include 16
television cameras, three or
four delegates from Russia and
a few other international jour
nalists.
About 7,500 chairs have been
set up in Frost; the other 3,000
guests will sit on the grass.
Wagner said traffic will be
blocked off at Campus Drive and
Galvez except for individuals
with press credentials or handi
capped licenses.
She added that parking will
be available at the Eucalyptus
lot, the Track House and 855
Serra.
The gates to Frost will open at
9:30 a.m. Saturday for the 11:15
speech.
While in the United States,
Gorbachev plans to visit Chicago,
San Francisco, Atlanta, New
York, Washington and Cam
bridge, according to the Associat

His two-week tour is being
sponsored by the non-profit Gor
bachev Foundation-USA, based
in San Francisco.
