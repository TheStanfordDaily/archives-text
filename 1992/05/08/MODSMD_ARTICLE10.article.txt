Gorbachev: King verdict highlights
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Former Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev said yesterday that the Rodney King beating trial ver
dict and its bloody aftermath should signal Americans that policy
changes are needed.
Speaking to a cheering audience of 4,000, Gorbachev said he
told Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley earlier this week that he
thought the acquittal of four white police officers who beat King,
a black motorist, would eventually be reversed.
"But we also agreed that what happened to that man was a sig
nal that we had to understand," said Gorbachev, who is on a two
week fundraising tour of the country.
" I believe the level of democracy existing in the United States
will make it possible both. . .to draw the lessons from what hap
pened and also to change the policies when necessary," he added.
Crippling German strike ends
BONN, Germany (AP) — Leaders of Germany's unionized
public workers accepted a new government wage proposal Thurs
day, heralding the end to an 11-day strike that crippled mass
transit and left mountains of garbage on the streets.
The government proposal of a 5.4 percent wage hike outpaces
inflation, though it does not meet the demands of workers for
nearly twice that amount.
The strikes by 400,000 public-sector workers in western Ger
many wreaked havoc on bus and rail transit, postal deliveries,
garbage collection, day care, airline service and car rentals.
