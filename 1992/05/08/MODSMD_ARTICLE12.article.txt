## A 						changed America? 
### 
Gorbachev returns to a
country aching for fresh
perspectives on old crises

THERE IS SOMETHING ter
rifying about waking up
from a good dream.
Mikhail Gorbachev's second
Stanford visit, this time as a
rejected leader of a dismembered
empire, is a rough awakening. Mil
lions of Americans must now
watch the revolutionary former
leader pitch a private foundation
like a traveling salesman.
But behind Americans' grimace
at the human drama of a fallen star
is a deeper fear. Coming on the
heels of the Los Angeles riots and
the most deadly civil strife in the
United States for a century, Ameri
cans are facing a resurgence of
uncertainty.
The past years of joyful, tele
vised democratic revolution and
the months of relatively casualty
free war that bloated the American
ego were only the first few minutes
of the marathon, not a victory.
Americans had seen in Gor
bachev a leader with awe-inspiring
chutzpah and a savior from danger
— a man attempting to re-engi
neer an entire society, all the while
reducing the threat of nuclear
catastrophe.
But now he's just a man. And his
country's citizens — many of whom
never liked him or the societal
upheaval he represented — are
writhing beneath the awesome task
of building an efficient economy.
The fading of Gorbachev's inspi
ration for Americans comes at an
auspicious time, but may hold an
important lesson.
Many have criticized President
Bush's limp response to the L.A.
riots. They wanted a Gorbachev,
someone who would inspire and
change America. Yearning for a sav
ior is understandable but dangerous.
To rely on our political leaders
for salvation is to avoid our

responsibility for making democ
racy work.
When Americans watched Gor
bachev's Sinatra doctrine at work
in Eastern Europe — letting them
make revolution their own way —
there were ceaseless happy endings.
Now, the American public strug
gles with let-down after the eupho
ria of ideological victory.
As a political model for the
world, our pride swelled. And the
swift removal of Saddam Hussein
from Kuwait focused awareness on
American power.
America's descent last year into
a deep and long-lasting recession
was enough to begin deflating this
expanded self-image.
The terrifying images of Ameri
can failure that burned on televi
sion screens across the country
last week inflicted a more pro
found wound, however.
For thousands of people in L.A.,
and millions across the country,
the American dream of fair politi
cal representation and economic
security is more of a nightmare.
Stained by wide brush-strokes
of failure — especially after recent
feelings of glory and power — the
nation's spirit suffers. Many yearn
for solutions like those seen on TV
During the swift Persian Gulf
war and the overthrown coup in
what was the Soviet Union, the
American model seemed so right,
so satisfying.
It is poetic that at this moment,
an old American hero is stopping by
for a visit. It will still be a thrill to see
him, and he'll probably say some
thing safe about "the rule of law."
But, if we are lucky, the new
Gorbachev, the human-sized Gor
bachev, will speak to us.
Gorbachev has spoken to his
own people about rebuilding their
wounded spirit after profound fail
ure. He has asked them for indi
vidual initiative. Ironically, he
used Americans as models to
inspire Soviet citizens.
Although the American crisis
pales to that in Gorbachev's coun
try, it is now Americans who could
use his old stump speech.
