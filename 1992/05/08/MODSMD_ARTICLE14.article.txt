## Eastern Europe's dilemma 
### 
FALL 1989 WAS truly a dramatic
period for eastern Europe, as Soli
darnose won a stunning victory in
Poland's first free elections in decades,
followed by the exodus of Germans living
east of the "Iron Curtain" and then the
fall of the communist dictatorships in
East Germany, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia
and finally Romania.
The world's eyes were filled with emo
tion, witnessing the fall of the Berlin
Wall, the symbol of the division of a sin
gle people. The days in which virtually all
of Prague's citizens took to the streets to
claim a freedom which had been taken
from them after the 1968 Soviet invasion
ending Dubcek's "Prague Spring."
The Romanian people's storming of
their nation's capitol after the December,
1991 massacres of Timisoara and
Bucharest led to the fall of megalomaniac
Nicolae Ceaucescu.
But two and a half years have past,
and euphoria has largely given way to
realism, as renown Stanford scholars and
visiting professors alike admit. The simi
larity of the winds of change mask the
differences regarding the various states'
current problems and their strategies for
future success.
Common problems include how to
restructure economies along market
lines, which in the short run will increase
unemployment with shut-downs of non
competitive factories, remove a lot of the

security nets which existed under com
munist rule and erode living standards
with the unfreezing of prices.
Yet each of the former communist-run
states has unique characteristics. Prof.
Bob Hamrdla, a lecturer in German
Studies and International Relations,
identifies the former East Germany's
ability to take advantage of its shared cul
tural and linguistic ties to Europe's most
advanced economic power.
Meanwhile, Hungary has been assist
ed by steps of economic reform taken in
the decades before the 1989 revolutions
and early reform among the leadership,
which allowed a smoother transition to
parliamentary democracy and economic
restructuring, says Visiting Political Sci
ence Professor Elem6r Hankiss.
Psychological problems such as identi
ty crises among the current turbulence
and adjustments to notions of competi
tiveness and variable prices are also of
key importance, say Hamrdla and Stan
ford Emeritus Professor Jan Triska, a
Czech-American.
Poland's current situation is particu
larly grave given the government's deci
sion for swift economic transformation,
says Waldemar Martyniuk, visiting Pol
ish professor in Stanford's Slavic
Department. A much greater emphasis
on the importance of money, and, in the
aftermath of the Solidarnosc union's
revolution, uncertainty over protection

of workers' rights in industries owned
by Western investors have caused con
cern.
Hamrdla, Hankiss, Triska and Mar
tyniuk alike point out the relative ease of
the task of establishing democracy in
Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and
Eastern Germany. Reverend Robert G.
Hamerton-Kelly of Stanford's Center for
International Security and Arms Control
believes that the neo-communists hold on
power in Romania — which survived the
initial "revolution" — is eroding, and
that democratic opposition groups are
now much stronger.
But all five scholars foresee economic
difficulty for Eastern Europe in the near
future, believing that true restructuring
and the establishment of healthy, baK
anced economies and living standards
comparable to their western neighbors
will take "at least one generation."
All agree that the West, which has
shown lukewarm eagerness to help East-;
ern Europe, particularly in Romania's
case, must be more forthcoming in its
assistance if it would like to see this tran-i
sition realized as smoothly as possible. *
