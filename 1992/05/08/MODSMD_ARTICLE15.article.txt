Consider damage to Korean community in LA. aftermath

AMID AMERICA'S OUTRAGE and
violence over the Rodney King
verdict, experts and laymen alike
have often used the phrase, "I condemn
the violence, but I can understand it."
When applied to the broader socio
economic problems of African-Ameri
cans, this statement expresses thought
ful compassion. However, when applied
to the separate problem of African-
American and Korean-American ten
sion, I believe this statement highlights
the insensitivity for the victims of tar
geted racial violence and demonstrates
an incomplete understanding of the
issues.
My parents own a fast-food restau
rant in an African-American community
in Houston. Over the past several years
— well before the furor in Los Angeles
— resentment, open hostility, boycotts

and violence from certain members of
the African-American community
against my parents have escalated with
out any media attention, without a wrin
kle in the system.
In one incident, an African-American
youth, claiming discrimination, shot at
my parents and missed my father's head
by a couple of inches.
The fear and frustration that I saw in
the eyes of my mother and father that
night and the hundreds of similar tales
from other Korean-American business
owners have created a hopeless vacuum.
People may perceive Korean-American
businesses as part of the system, but in
truth, we are only the icon without any
of the power.
In L.A., of the estimated $700 million
in damages, the Korean-American com
munity has lost more than $350 million.

Sixteen hundred Korean-American busi
nesses were either looted or destroyed.
But this tragedy is about more than
numbers; it is about killing the human
spirit.
Many of these Korean-Americans
have struggled, working 18 hours a day,
every day for the past 15 years. Their
hard work, pride and hope all went up in
smoke overnight. Why were the Korean-
Americans singled out? Do you believe
they were all racists?
Despite the incredible damages suf
fered by Korean-Americans, I have been
silent to respect the justifiable anger of
the African-Americans.
My silence was a mistake. Anger is
justified; targeted racial violence is not. I
am sick and tired of hearing about the
"racist Koreans" or "Korean oppres
sors." It is insulting, at best, to explain

targeted violence as the fault of Korean-
American business owners, telling them,
in effect, that they deserved it.
Injustice is injustice. My parents are
not racists, bigots or oppressors. They,
like many other Korean-Americans, are
victims.
There is a fine line between civil dis
obedience and racial violence, and I
believe that not only have the rioters
ignored this difference, many "commen
tators" have also with statements like,
"I condemn the violence, but I can
understand it."
Well, I condemn the violence, and I
cannot understand it. Anyone who pre
tends both to condemn and understand
should rethink what they mean.
