# Calling Terra raunchy harmed "people of dirt"
## 
### 
We wish to object in the strongest
possible language to the Daily's slander
ous characterization of Terra House, a
professional co-op with a strict code of
ethics, as a "raunchy" pit unworthy of a
visit by presidential candidate Jerry
Brown.
We take particular exception to the
referencing of the May 6 article about
Terra as "See RAUNCHY, page 3." We
do not consider "raunchy" an appropri
ate term to describe our home; we prefer
the more politically correct term
"hygienically challenged."
Furthermore, the article's statement
that Terra residents are "scrambling" to
get the house clean in time for Brown's
visit on Saturday is a gross misrepresen
tation. On the contrary, we Terrans are
trying as hard as we can to avoid doing
any extra cleaning.

While many people are under the
impression that "co-op" is an abbrevia
tion for "community opting to blow off
cleaning entirely," Terra is proud of its
tradition of getting well over 50 percent
of its house jobs done weekly. Our house
is sparkling clean for at least eight solid
hours on Sunday night after house jobs
are due.
The semi-clean state of Terra allows
us to commune with nature in a unique
and meaningful way. It's not that we're
dirty, it's that our cleanliness transcends
understanding.
The Daily article was an obvious ploy
by Bush and Clinton supporters to dis
courage people from attending the
Brown dinner. Moreover, The Daily's
invective expresses an intolerance of
alternative lifestyles and a hostility
toward people of dirt that are extremely
destructive to the delicate process of
community-building at Stanford.
Shame on you.
We hope that those thinking of
putting Terra on their draw card will

not be deterred by the Daily's prejudicial
treatment of our fine home. If it's good
enough for Brown, it's good enough for
you.
