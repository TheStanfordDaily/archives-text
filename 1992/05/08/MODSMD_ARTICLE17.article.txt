# Recognition of Zapata moves resident fellows
## 
### 
We would like to thank The Daily for
the laudatory bilingual editorial on Casa
Zapata's 20th anniversary. It moved us.
We have had many differences with The
Daily, and at those times we have been
fast and ready with letters to the editor.
With that same speed, we would now
like to express our appreciation.
Your recognition of our bilingual and
bicultural nature is appreciated. The
past 20 years have not been easy, but
they have been worthwhile.

As the first Resident Fellow Arturo
Pachecho, now Vice President at the
University of Texas at El Paso, remi
nisced Sunday, when Casa Zapata
opened its doors in 1972 there were only
twenty Chicanos living here and not
many more elsewhere.
They were chastised for creating seg
regation. Many of those students now
form an active part of Stanford's Chi
cane nlnmni.
The success of Casa Zapata is due to
committed residents who understand
the concept of the word "familia," and in
particular, our staff of resident assis
tants and theme assistants.
This staff began the year with a dev
astating rape incident that seemed to
painfully set us back to day one; but our
staff never quit and through their hard
labor of love and dedication brought
Casa Zapata back on top.
Gracias staff, gracias Daily.
