# Hoover avoids Campbell incident as it prepares for Gorbachev
## 
### 
Nurturing of racism at
Hoover Institution continues
with a cheerleader of racism, for
.mer director W. Glenn Campbell, still
Hoover's salary and protection.
The issue is being dodged on several
.'related, but separate, topics.
The credibility of Visiting Scholar Srd-
Jan Trifkovic and others, to whom the
racist axioms aimed at Serbs were pre
-sented at a private dinner in February, is
.questioned because Trifkovic has not
released the tape with Campbell's slurs.
It is clear that releasing this tape would
•not make any difference, for the videotape

showing the beating of Rodney King seen
by the whole country did not have any
influence on a jury poisoned by racism.
But releasing it would divert atten
tion to the separate Bubject of the legali
ty of the recording. Hbover Director
John Raisian has established that the
racist remarks were made in the form of
glorifying Nazism and has reprimanded
Campbell for this.
This reprimand is pathetically sym
bolic and not fitting for the crime.
A letter by a Croat nationalist in
Tuesday's Daily claims that Trifkovic
does not document claims he makes on

the history of the Balkans. Contrary to
this nonsense, the capacity in which I
know Trifkovic is from those same talks
documented thoroughly by references
from the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust
to the Encyclopedia Britannica.
The Nazi ideology proponents are
relying on the Serb-bashing media
reporting on the cruel wars in the Balka
ns to imply that it is fine to be racist
against the Serbs. Senior Hoover Fellow
Rita Ricardo-Campbell, Campbell's wife,
boasts of letters of support from Croat
ian community members — as if racism
is justified by support from members of

a nation guilty of war crimes in the past
as well as today.
There has been no condemnation of
Campbell's racism by Hoover officials.
Hoover's director has approached a
member of the Serbian-American com
munity with expressions of concern about
the issue, and I was told that Campbell's
philosophy is "not shared by everybody at
Hoover." Raisian claims that it is not in
his power to fire Campbell.
The underlying concern of Hoover
seems to be that of not spoiling Mikhail
Gorbachev's visit, and the issue of racism
in their house is not that important.

Gorbachev will visit Hoover Saturday,
May 9, the date of victory against
Nazism, and a bunch of hand-picked
journalists with a proven positive atti
tude toward Hoover have been invited.
I hope that at least one of them will
follow his conscience and ask Gorbachev
whether, after his nation lost many mil
lions of lives, he feels comfortable being
hosted by an institution that employs
men like Campbell who glorify Nazism
and the extermination of entire races.
