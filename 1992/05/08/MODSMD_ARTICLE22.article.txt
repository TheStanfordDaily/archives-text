## Card faces Cal in must-win series 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
This year's Big Game was said
really to have "meant some
thing." For the first time in a
whole slew of years, both Stan
ford's and California's football
team were fanked, and postsea
son bowl bids that depended upon
the outcome of the game were on
the line.
There will be a Big Game of
sorts this weekend, or three of
them, actually. Both the Cardinal
and the Bears reside in second
place in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division, and their
three-game series this weekend
may play a huge part in who goes
to an NCAA regional after the
regular season concludes.
"Whoever wins two of three
fin this series!, Cal or Stanford,
it'll be real hard for them not to
finish in second place [in the Six-
PacJ," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess.
However, for the Cardinal to
take those two games, it'll have to
be at the top of its game.
California offers plenty of
firepower from the plate, and
has the leading power hitter in
the conference in the person of
Troy Penix. But just about
everybody on the team is hitting
very well.
"[Cal is] one of the best defen
sive and offensive teams in the
conference," said Marquess.
"Our biggest concern is to hope
fully contain them. We don't
want it to turn into a slugfest,
because if it does, we'll probably
end up on the short end. Starting
pitching will have to come
through for us."
If there is anything that Stan
ford must rely on, the starting
pitching should be it. The Cardi
nal's four starters comprise one
of the best staffs in the nation.
Willie Adams and Rick Helling
have been invited to the Olympic
trials.
Brian Sackinsky was named a
pre-season Ail-American and has
scouts practically drooling with
his fastball. And Jaime Sepeda's
off-speed pitches may be the best
on the team. The only problem is
that every one of them is right
handed. So how does that match
up with California hitters?

"They'll probably start seven
or eight lefties against us," said
Marquess.
That translates into possibly
many hard hit balls to right field.
Fortunately, Stanford does have
a couple of lefties in the bullpen.
Andrew Lorraine looked sharp
last weekend against UCI.A, and
Steve Worrell was taken out of
the mothballs in Monday's game
against Sacramento State and
looked impressive.
"Lorraine looked good," said
Marquess. "And Worrell pitched
well, so we won't be afraid to use
him."
Most likely both will be seen,
possibly more than once. Four of
the conference's best hitters are
Bears, those being Fenix, Matt

Luke, John Zuber and Chris
Clapinski, and all hit from the
left side.
Penix leads the Six-Pac in
homers (17), RBI (69) and slug
ging percentage (.682), Luke
leads in hits (75) and triples (6)
and is second in RBI (47), Zuber
is second in batting average
(.385), and Calpinski is first in
runs scored (53).
On the up side for the Cardi
nal, however, is that it scored 34
runs against the Bruins last
weekend, and hopefully that hit
ting trend will continue against
Cal's sub-par team pitching.
On that note, Jeffrey Ham
monds is reportedly back from
last weekend's foot-injury and
will be starting on Friday.

Freshman Jed Hansen turns a double play against California during the two teams' last series. The Car
dinal hopes to make many similar plays like this weekend as the team faces the Golden Bears in a
series which is crucial for determining postseason berths.
