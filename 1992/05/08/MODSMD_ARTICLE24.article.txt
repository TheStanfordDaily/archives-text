# 'Yes to pay-per-view
## 
### 
Great news, Beaver back
ers! Beginning this fall,
you can tune in to excit
ing Oregon State gridiron
action Saturday ... for as little
as ten dollars!
So ABC Sports told us this
week when they announced
that all Pac-10, P ; g 10 and CFA
teams (read: everybody but
Notre Dame) will have their
games available to cable hold
ers on a pay-per-view basis.
Every game, every Saturday,
nationwide.
This, sports fans, is a cool
deal.
All right, my explanation is
exaggerated, but just a little.
Not every game will be avail
able, but every game being
broadcast anywhere will be
available on pay-per-view
everywhere. And nowadays,
that's virtually the whole lot.
I know what you're saying.
We're already saturated with
college football on the tube. We
don't need any more. Not only
does ABC throw together a
doubleheader every fall Satur
day, but NBC is showing games
and then we've got Raycom,
TNT, ESPN, TBS, EPA . . .
and now pay-per-view?
Why pay ten bucks for a
game, you say, when we've
already got a dozen on for free?
If you're really that hard up to
see Wisconsin battle Wis.-
Green Bay then you should
move back and watch the game
in person with the rest of the
Cheeseheads.
But I say the more games
the better. What's wrong with
letting Michigan fans in the
Bay Area pay to see their
Wolverines? What's wrong
with letting Farmers at Stan
ford-in-Washington pay 10
bucks to see Bill Walsh's home
opener? It may seem like over
saturation to you, but then
you'd rather be out jogging
than woofing down Pizza Hut
and Budweiser with the Bears-
Packers game crunching in the
background. For the now-sali
vating group of weekend couch
potatoes, this could mean three
more glorious hours of atroph
ic immobilization.

We've seen it work profitable
wonders for boxing. In fact, if it
wasn't for pay-per-view we
would never have seen fat, old
thugs like George Foreman and
Larry Holmes fight again. But
we don't stop reaping the bene
fits there. Look at its potential
and I think you'll agree — pay
per-view could be the best thing
since preferential voting.
Two months before ABC
televises its first kickoff, PPV

will make its non-boxing prime
time debut. To compliment its
standard Summer Games cov
erage, NBC will offer an enor
mous pay-per-view package of
almost around-the-clock Oly
mpic action.
Viewers will be able to watch
the event of their choice at any
time by calling up either the
"Red" "White" or "Blue" chan
nel. We won't miss a minute of
Dan (to be) O'Brien and Dave
(settled this summer) Johnson
battling in the decathlon.
At long last, steeplechase fans
won't feel shortchanged. And
hopefully they put all the cheesy
features on the "Mauve" chan
nel or some other one I don't get.
With any luck, PPV will con
tinue to grow (and its cost will
continue to shrink), revolution
izing the sport of weekend veg
etation. PPV could let us pick
from seven simultaneous NFL
games on Sunday afternoons,
or set us free to roam on our
own during the NCAA Tourna
ment. And wouldn't it be great
if hockey went PPV? We could
catch at least ten or twelve
great fights in a row without
being forced to sit through a
single minute of ice action.
Someday soon, fellow
junkies, someday soon.
