If you see members of the
Stanford crew teams viciously
defacing their notebooks today,
don't panic. They're on a mission.
"Today is Beat Cal Day for
us," said women's crew captain
Bonnie Baker. "Wherever we
see the word California today,
we cross it out."
The Stanford men's and
women's crew teams are hop
ing that they can make it Beat
Cal Day, Part II on Saturday at
9 a.m. at Redwood Shores in
the annual Big Row against
California. The meet is critical
for both teams, with the
women battling for second
place in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence and the men hoping to
clinch the second seed going
into the Pac-10 championships
two weeks from now.
"It should be a very close

race," said senior men's crew
member Steve Voorhis. "We
were one second apart at San
Diego, and now we have them
on our home course."
The men are having one of
their best seasons in many
years, running neck and neck
with UCLA, Washington and
California in the Pac-10 race.
"We're really building up for
Cal," said Voorhis. "We know
that if we dominate them, we
could be looking ahead to
nationals."
On the women's side, Stan
ford women's crew assistant
coach Christie May expects a
fierce competition.
"This might be the finest
race we see all year," said May.
"They've really been up for this
race, especially in the last cou
ple of days."
Senior Baker shares the sen
timent: "We're psyched. You
always want to beat Cal."
