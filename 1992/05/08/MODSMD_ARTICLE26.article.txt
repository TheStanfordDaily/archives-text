# Track travels to Texas
## 
### Nick Clements Staff writer 
With the women's victory last
weekend over California firmly
under its belt, the Stanford Track
and Field team will send three ath
letes to the Texas Relays this
weekend in preparation for the
Pacific 10 and NCAA Champi
onships later this spring.
Chryste Gaines, the NCAA
indoor sprint champion in the 55
meter dash, will he running the
100- and 200-meters. Gaines,
whose best time in the 100-meters
is 11.17 seconds, will more than
likely need a time under 11 seconds
to qualify for the Olympic team
when the trials are held in late
June.
Jackie Edwards, the NCAA
indoor long jump champion, will be
competing in the long and triple
jumps after her phenomenal perfor
mance against California last week
end. In that meet, Edwards won the
triple jump and the long jump, and
placed second to Gaines in the 100-
and the 200-meters to account for
21 of Stanford's 83 points.
Freshman Travis Clark will

also be travelling to Texas after
winning the high jump last week
end against the Golden Bears with
a leap of 7 feet.
"He's starting to peak," said
Stanford head track coach Brooks
Johnson. "I think he might hit 7'
4" before the year is out."
Johnson said that next week
end some members of the team
will be at the Modesto Relays,
although who, exactly, those
members will be is up in the air
right now.
"The people who need the meet
the most will be there," said John
son.
What Johnson means is that
several Stanford athletes are still
hoping to qualify for NCAAs,
either provisionally or automati
cally, and could use the meet to hit
qualifying times.
Fred Carter is looking to quali
fy in the 3000-meter steeplechase,
and Gary Stolz in the 5000-
meters. If one or both skips the
Modesto Relays, they still will
have an opportunity to qualify for
NCAAs in the Pac-10 champi
onships, held two weeks from now
in Eugene, Oregon.
