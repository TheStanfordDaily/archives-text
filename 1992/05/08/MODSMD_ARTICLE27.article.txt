# Laxmi Poruri cashes in on big gambles

Laxmi Poruri may not be play
ing with a full deck.
What other collegiate netter
would radically overhaul her
backhand in hopes of being a
more forceful and adaptable com
petitor?
But Poruri's gamble has paid
off in spades as a combination of
physical and mental improve
ments have vaulted the sopho
more to two tournament titles
and a No. 4 collegiate ranking this
season.
"I think Pve made a tremen
dous jump in my game this year,"
said Poruri, who was ranked No.
62 in the preseason poll. "I'm
stronger and faster. I go on the
court with a sense of purpose and
I know what I want to do.
"At times last year, I was con
fused or bored. I didn't want to be
out there. I wandered and didn't
know where I wanted to go."
Part of Poruri's frustration
with the 1991 campaign stemmed
from a self-motivated restructur
ing of her game. She switched
from a two-handed backhand to a
single-winged shot.
"Technically, last year it was a
complete zero," Poruri said. "But
now I'm stronger and have confi
dence in it."
The stroke is still her Achilles
heel, but now it's better armored.
"Players know to hit to my
backhand, but I've made a lot of
progress on it," she said. "I've
been working on the slice and it's
better. I also have more confi
dence in my topspin. I can do it
technically.
"I can hit 1,000 times in prac
tice but its a matter of hitting it in
matches. It's all a confidence
thing."
Poruri's backhand switch is
indicative of her risk-taking
nature. Not many collegiate play
ers would make a radical change
in their game so late in their
development.
But she believed a one-hander
would be better for her game and,
after being dissuaded by junior
coaches for years, made the deci
sion last fall to change.
"She wanted a more versatile
shot that would allow her to be
more aggressive," said coach
Frank Brennan. "She was think

ing of the future, the big picture."
After a rocky freshman year at
No. 5, Poruri — who once beat
Monica Seles in the junior ranks
— was considered by some to be
washed up on the college scene.
But the new, improved Poruri
arrived at the NCAA Champi
onships.
"She played with a lot of confi
dence," Brennan said. "She was
going for balls because she wasn't
thinking so much. Her instincts
had taken over."
While the new backhand has
helped her be more aggressive, it
also reveals Poruri's desire to set
herself apart from her peers. She
wants to be the best possible ten
nis player she can be, not only for
herself, but for her culture.
"(Being Indian) is not some
thing I think about all the time
but it does get noticed by Indi
ans," said Poruri who, after a
recent win, got a congratulatory
letter and telegram from a pro
ducer in India.
"In the last two years, I've
become more proud and knowl
edgeable about my background,"
she said.
As an Indian in a high-profile
sport, Poruri has the opportunity
to provide an athletic role model
for an ethnic group which values
education above all else.
"Many Indians in this country
are doctors or engineers, which is
great and tremendous," she said.
"But I want to show them that
you can be an athlete and still get
respect. I'm not throwing away
my education by doing this.
"I'm not necessarily out to
prove anything but I want to do
something different. I don't want
to be typical. I want to show Indi
ans that if they have talents —
whether they be artistic, athletic
or anything — to pursue them.
Education will always be there."
Having been raised in this
country, Poruri realizes how
strange that message sounds to
most Americans. In the United
States, sports are often put ahead
of schooling.
"In my ethnic group it's the
complete opposite," she said.
In some countries if you don't
enroll in a university right after
secondary school, you won't get
another opportunity for higher
education, Poruri points out. One
of the benefits of the American

system is that a person can go to
college at any age.
"That's a blessing," she said.
"Don't deny another talent. Why
not try it out and if you fail, go
back to school."
Poruri may find herself in that
situation if she turns pro before
she graduates.
"There are a lot of factors I'd
have to consider before making
that decision," she said. "It's not
something I can go over in five
minutes."
But when she does play profes
sionally, she doesn't want to be an

also-ran.
"The pro tour is a very unsta
ble, risky environment," she said.
"There are so many good players.
The probability (of making the
top 10) is not high but you never
know when that element of luck
will be on your side."
Also, Poruri is well aware that
today's best players turned pro at
an early age. Very few, if any, for
mer collegiate players have bro
ken the top 10 on the women's
tour.
"I'd rather be in the game and
take my chances," she said.

That's the way the ball bounces. For Laxmi Poruri, Stanford's No. 2
singles player, it has bounced the right way. This year she has rock
eted from No. 62 to No. 4 in the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate Rankings.
