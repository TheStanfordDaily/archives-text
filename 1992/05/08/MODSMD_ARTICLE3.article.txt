# Much changed since former leader's previous Farm visit

Mikhail Gorbachev will use his
16-day trip through the United
States to define his role as an
"elder statesman," Stanford
scholars say.
When Gorbachev spoke at
Memorial Auditorium two years
ago, he was at his political apex,
and University President Donald
Kennedy described him as "the
architect of a world transforma
tion."
Today, the luster is gone. Gor
bachev finds himself without a
role in his country and can only
hope to influence world events by
"trying to carve out his role as a
statesman," said Political Science
Prof. Condoleezza Rice.
Gorbachev's future role will like
ly be that of "a wise adviser," Eco
nomics Prof. Kenneth Arrow said,
adding that this role may grow as
his successors in the former Soviet
Union find themselves in trouble.
But "his own role as leader as
opposed to elder statesman is
over," Arrow said.
Other scholars agreed that
Gorbachev will never reclaim
actual power in the former Soviet
Union, dismissing a remark Gor

bachev made this week about Gen
eral Charles de Gaulle's return to
power in France, years after he
had been written off politically.
"That's not a realistic dream,"
Dunlop said. "He has already
played his role. The people don't
want him now. ... They had to
pull him out with pliers and he still
entertains the hope that he might
get back in power someday."
Arrow said there is little com
parison between Gorbachev and
the former French president.
"De Gaulle had a way of mak
ing himself come back to power,
because he represented French
identity and leadership to the
French," he said. "But Gorbachev
has a reputation for being indeci
sive. When the country is in dan
ger, they will not be looking back
at him."
But Gorbachev will remain
influential, Arrow added. "It's not
necessary to be a leader to be signif
icant. An elder statesman role ... is
important, too, because of the sway
he could have over public opinion."
Conquest said Gorbachev has
not been "written off" yet. "He
may still have some role," he said.

Gorbachev's address tomorrow

at Frost Amphitheater may actu

out of power, according to Political
Science Prof. Philippe Schmitter.
"He's freer to speak his own
mind," Schmitter said. "He's a
consummate politician and I
think he'll be more inventive,

even more interesting, since he's
not under the normal constraints
of a head of state."
But Political Science Prof.
Alexander Dallin said Gor
