# Much changed since former leader's previous Farm visit

Mikhail Gorbachev will use his
16-day trip through the United
States to define his role as an
"elder statesman," Stanford
scholars say.
When Gorbachev spoke at
Memorial Auditorium two years
ago, he was at his political apex,
and University President Donald
Kennedy described him as "the
architect of a world transforma
tion."
Today, the luster is gone. Gor
bachev finds himself without a
role in his country and can only
hope to influence world events by
"trying to carve out his role as a
statesman," said Political Science
Prof. Condoleezza Rice.
Gorbachev's future role will like
ly be that of "a wise adviser," Eco
nomics Prof. Kenneth Arrow said,
adding that this role may grow as
his successors in the former Soviet
Union find themselves in trouble.
But "his own role as leader as
opposed to elder statesman is
over," Arrow said.
Other scholars agreed that
Gorbachev will never reclaim
actual power in the former Soviet
Union, dismissing a remark Gor

bachev made this week about Gen
eral Charles de Gaulle's return to
power in France, years after he
had been written off politically.
"That's not a realistic dream,"
Dunlop said. "He has already
played his role. The people don't
want him now. ... They had to
pull him out with pliers and he still
entertains the hope that he might
get back in power someday."
Arrow said there is little com
parison between Gorbachev and
the former French president.
"De Gaulle had a way of mak
ing himself come back to power,
because he represented French
identity and leadership to the
French," he said. "But Gorbachev
has a reputation for being indeci
sive. When the country is in dan
ger, they will not be looking back
at him."
But Gorbachev will remain
influential, Arrow added. "It's not
necessary to be a leader to be signif
icant. An elder statesman role ... is
important, too, because of the sway
he could have over public opinion."
Conquest said Gorbachev has
not been "written off" yet. "He
may still have some role," he said.
Tomorrow's address
Gorbachev's address tomorrow

at Frost Amphitheater may actu
ally be more candid because he is
out of power, according to Political
Science Prof. Philippe Schmitter.
"He's freer to speak his own
mind," Schmitter said. "He's a
consummate politician and I
think he'll be more inventive,

even more interesting, since he's
not under the normal constraints
of a head of state."
But Political Science Prof.
Alexander Dallin said Gor
bachev's new role as an "elder

statesman" will not necessarily
make him more candid. "Gor
bachev won't be totally frank,
because it will be embarrassing
for him to talk about his failures,"
he said.
Gorbachev will also "want to
appear loyal to the present gov
ernment. He's not likely to criti
cize it directly," Dallin said.
Arrow said he doesn't expect
much from the speech because Gor
bachev's "previous public com
ments have been so bland. He

makes comments like, *We need to
go slowly' or *We need to be careful.'
"I wish he would make more
definite statements," he said. "He
responds to crises well, but he
doesn't make good public policy.
He tends to waffle."
Hoover Senior Fellow John
Dunlop was even more critical,
saying that students primarily
responded to Gorbachev in 1990
because "he was perceived as a
man of peace." Now, "he can't ful
fill that role. He's looking back,
not forward. Frankly, [his speech]
won't mean much."
'Gorbachev is a celebrity'
Hoover Senior Fellow Robert

Conquest attributed Gorbachev's
warm reception in the U.S. to the
fact that "here, he doesn't have to
inflict policy on anyone."
What Gorbachev says is "high
ly palatable" to Americans, "espe
cially people at Stanford," said
Angelo Codevilla, another Hoover
senior fellow.
"Americans bet an awful lot on
Gorbachev and they are unwilling
to concede that that bet went
sour," he said. "By celebrating
Gorbachev, they're celebrating
themselves."
"Gorbachev is a celebrity," he
added. "People come to see him
because they've seen him on TV.
It's personal curiosity, not an

intellectual curiosity."
Gorbachev remains more pop
ular among Americans than
among Russians, Dallin said.
"We have seen him change the
whole international scene. They
have seen a decline in their stan
dard of living and the decline of
their superpower country to a sec
ond-rate country," he said.
A 'place in history'
But Conquest praised Gor
bachev for seeing that "the old
system didn't work" and for "pre
siding over the transition" of Rus
sia and Eastern Europe.
"He's a transitional figure,
with one foot in the past and one

in the present," Conquest said.
And despite the mistakes Gor
bachev has made, History Prof.
Mark Mancall said he feels the
former president is "not coming
as the defeated leader of a defeat
ed nation, but as a leader of
courage and imagination."
"His place in history is
extremely secure," Arrow added.
Dun lop said, "I've always felt
that the changes he produced
were not what he intended. But
you can't deny that he has played
a key role — perhaps the key role
— in 20th century world politics.
"It wasn't due to his inten
tions, but rather to the man he is
underneath," he said.
