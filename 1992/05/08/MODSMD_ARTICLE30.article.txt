# As King verdict, crisis recede: Can activism last?
##

Anger over the Rodney King verdict will
likely yield to complacency and apathy
rather than a renewed civil rights move
ment, Stanford faculty and students say.
"If history serves us, then people
unfortunately will get relaxed in their
daily life" once the crisis settles, said
Keith Archuleta, director of the Black
Community Services Center.
History Prof. Clayborne Carson, the
director of the Martin Luther King Jr.
Papers Project, agreed. "I think it is going
to be more difficult this time around"
than in the 1960s to generate a civil rights
movement, he said.
Carson expressed frustration with
today's "era of conservatism and

entrenchment" in which "a whole genera
tion of young people have grown up with
out an experience of a reform-oriented
White House. They have no idea what
could be achieved."
"Looking back a generation, I don't
think the attitude of the public at large is
(any longer) in a position to bring the gov
ernment along," History Prof. A 1 Camar
illo said.
Senior Bacardi Jackson, an organizer
of the Black Action Coalition for Justice
— which has responded to the King ver
dict with rallies and protests — said the
emergence of a new civil rights movement
is unlikely because of the lack of strong
black leaders in the nation.
"The black people are ready to be mobi
lized," Jackson said, but no strong leaders
like Martin Luther King or Malcolm X are

coming forward.
Archuleta criticized those who had been
activists in the 1960s and then faded away,
calling them the "big chill" generation.
"Their biggest example of social action
is the 1960s and my reaction is 'what have
you done since the 19605?' "
Still, some expressed hope that a
renewed civil rights movement could
emerge from the debris.
Carson said such a movement would
require a "mtgor shift in public opinion
toward seeing the government as a posi
tive force for social change."
Camarillo said activists must expose
inner-city social problems — such as
racism, violence and the deterioration of
public schools — so that "it looms as a
political issue for both parties."
This type of movement would require

"real concerted action among liberal and
minority advocacy groups," he said.
"There is no precedent for that."
He added that students should play a
role in this campaign by making a "com
mitment ... to keep those issues before
the community."
Jackson said students are unlikely candi
dates to lead a new movement because "stu
dents, a lot of times, are inexperienced."
She said students' role, instead, should
be to call for leadership.
Scholars agreed that episodes like the
riots in Los Angeles will continue to
plague the United States.
"There is going to be continual violence
in black communities," Carson said. "The
only question is whether some of this vio
lence may spill outward and disrupt the
lives of white people."
