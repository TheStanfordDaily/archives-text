# Theta Delts fail to regain house
## Too few pledges mean frat will stay homeless 
### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
Due to a poor Rush and other "unre
solved matters," the Theta Delta Chi
fraternity will not regain its former
house at 675 Lomita next year, Univer
sity officials announced yesterday.
The house — which operated as a
semi self-operative this year — will be
an option in this year's Draw.
Fraternity members voluntarily
gave up the house after last year's Draw
with the stipulation that they be
allowed to return if they successfully
reorganized. Fifty-one students on the
waiting list were assigned to the house
last summer.
The University had asked the Theta

Delts to update their local chapter
bylaws, compose a "statement of pur

of at least 45 members if they wanted to
return to the house.
But the possibility of returning this
year was immediately ruled out because
"they did not meet the 45-person
requirement," said Janyce Prothro,
assistant director of the Row.
Prothro estimated that the fraterni
ty was short of the quota by at least 10
members.
In addition, the University is still
trying to settle other "unresolved mat
ters" with the Theta Delts — including
a debt of approximately $12,000 left by
the fraternity last year, Prothro said.
Communication between the Theta

Delts and the University has been poor,
she said. "When I talked to [the frater
nity members] they basically just said,
'We didn't make [the quota], now just
leave us alone.' "
Members of the fraternity did not
return numerous phone calls yesterday.
The Theta Delts have five years to
reorganize and petition to regain the
house, according to Heather Dunn, pro
gram coordinator at the Office of Stu
dent Activities.
"But there appears to be no pursuit
of the issue (by the fraternity) at this
time," Dunn said.
The fraternity, which has been on
campus since 1903, had difficulty meet-
