# Class explores other 'ways of knowing'

When students write term papers for
a class, "American Indian Ways of
Knowing" this quarter, they won't have

ferent history, focusing on the Native
American perspective of historical
events. On Wednesday, a group of
Native American high schoolers from

Alaska addressed the class (see related

versity of Utah professor discussed the
historical experience of the Yurok tribe.

the past three years, but this is the first
year the students' final projects will be
assembled to create educational material.
"The idea originated through a con
versation I had with a student about
the need to capture the first-person
voices of Native Americans and imple
ment them into early education," Nel
son-Barber said. "Yet the format that
we use at Stanford, consisting of many
