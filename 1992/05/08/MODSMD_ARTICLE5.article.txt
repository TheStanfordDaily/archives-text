# Class explores other 'ways of knowing'
## 
### Liesl Olson Staff writer 
When students write term papers for
a class, "American Indian Ways of
Knowing" this quarter, they won't have
just a grade in mind. Some of their
papers may end up as part of a high
school curriculum.
The class, which attempts to offer stu
dents a fresh view of Native American
issues, consists of mostly guest speakers,
ranging from prominent Native Ameri
can authors to historians and scholars.
Anthropology Lecturer Sharon Nel
son-Barber, who teaches the course, and
her more than 100 students are con

structing "authentic educational mate
rial" for high school history classes,
based on videotapes of the guest lectures
as well as the students' final projects.
"Secondary education is sorely lack
ing in multiculturalism," Nelson-Bar
ber said. "In about fourth grade, stu
dents start learning about the 'discov
ery* of the Americas, like it was an
empty continent. This is a very inade
quate history, which is just reinforced
in high school."
The speakers each present a very dif
ferent history, focusing on the Native
American perspective of historical
events. On Wednesday, a group of
Native American high schoolers from

Alaska addressed the class (see related
story, inside) and two weeks ago, a Uni
versity of Utah professor discussed the
historical experience of the Yurok tribe.
Nelson-Barber has taught the class for
the past three years, but this is the first
year the students' final projects will be
assembled to create educational material.
"The idea originated through a con
versation I had with a student about
the need to capture the first-person
voices of Native Americans and imple
ment them into early education," Nel
son-Barber said. "Yet the format that
we use at Stanford, consisting of many
different guest speakers, is hard
to have at a high school."
The curriculum that Stanford
students are creating will allow
these individual voices to be
heard in a high school setting.
Each student's final project will
expand on an idea presented in
one of the class lectures and focus
on the Native American perspec
tive of this issue.

really gives a thor

Indian population.'

Each project will form one of
the "lessons" in the new curricu
lum. It will be supplemented by a
videotaped clip from one of the
lectures that relates to the stu
dent's topic. Nelson-Barber added
that this curriculum could also be
applicable in elementary and
junior high school history.
"We are encouraging the stu
dents to be creative with their
projects, not to use the typical
methods of teaching," said junior
Erika Zavaleta, one of the class'
teaching assistants. "When
studying Native American histo
ry, it is important to connect the
material with personal experience
rather than studying history as a
separate entity."
Nelson-Barber requires all of
her students to keep a reflective
journal in order to connect their
personal experiences with the
topics discussed in presentations.
"Students often times feel a
strong sense of guilt after hearing
the stories of these Native Ameri
cans. These feelings can be voiced
in a journal," Nelson-Barber said.
"This type of pedagogy would also
be encouraged in the material

we're developing."
The new curriculum is target
ed at high schools in the Bay Area
that the TAs have contacted.
"The actual logistics relating
to the format are kind of nebulous
right now. It really depends on
what comes out of the students'
projects," said senior Maggie Har
rison, a TA. "In the meantime, we
have contacted schools around
the Bpy Area who are helping us
decide what the most useful form
of the curriculum would be."
Harrison said administrators
at one high school she had con
tacted — El Cerrito in the East
Bay — are "definitely interested
in using our material."
The project is targeted for
completion by the end of June so
that it can be used in high schools
by next year.
"We really want this material to
be used during Columbus Day next
year as a reflection on what truly
happened in 1492," Harrison said.
"George Bush is planning a huge
500 th anniversary parade for the
day, which will most likely be met
with protest by people who under
stand what we are trying to say."
The funding for the class'
guest speakers comes from vari
ous groups: the Haas Public Ser
vice Center, the Office of Multi
cultural Development, the ASSU
and Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford.
The continuation of the class
next year depends upon whether
these funds will still be available,
Nelson-Barber said. Budget cuts
— which are affecting all areas of
the University — may force its
cancellation next year, she said.
But if the future of the class
were dependent upon student
feedback, its survival would not
be in question.
"I love this class. It really gives
a thorough look at the U.S. Indi
an population," said freshman
Justin Sears. "I thought I knew a
lot, but it's so different from
what I learned about Native
Americans in grade school and
high school. Before this year, I
didn't have an accurate under
standing at all."

her more than 100 students are con

structing "authentic educational mate
rial" for high school history classes,
based on videotapes of the guest lectures
as well as the students' final projects.
"Secondary education is sorely lack
ing in multiculturalism," Nelson-Bar
ber said. "In about fourth grade, stu
dents start learning about the 'discov
ery* of the Americas, like it was an
empty continent. This is a very inade
quate history, which is just reinforced
in high school."
The speakers each present a very dif
ferent history, focusing on the Native
American perspective of historical
events. On Wednesday, a group of
Native American high schoolers from

Alaska addressed the class (see related
story, inside) and two weeks ago, a Uni
versity of Utah professor discussed the
historical experience of the Yurok tribe.
Nelson-Barber has taught the class for
the past three years, but this is the first
year the students' final projects will be
assembled to create educational material.
"The idea originated through a con
versation I had with a student about
the need to capture the first-person
voices of Native Americans and imple
ment them into early education," Nel
son-Barber said. "Yet the format that
we use at Stanford, consisting of many
different guest speakers, is hard
to have at a high school."
The curriculum that Stanford
students are creating will allow
these individual voices to be
heard in a high school setting.
Each student's final project will
expand on an idea presented in
one of the class lectures and focus
on the Native American perspec
tive of this issue.

Each project will form one of
the "lessons" in the new curricu
lum. It will be supplemented by a
videotaped clip from one of the
lectures that relates to the stu
dent's topic. Nelson-Barber added
that this curriculum could also be
applicable in elementary and
junior high school history.
"We are encouraging the stu
dents to be creative with their
projects, not to use the typical
methods of teaching," said junior
Erika Zavaleta, one of the class'
teaching assistants. "When
studying Native American histo
ry, it is important to connect the
material with personal experience
rather than studying history as a
separate entity."
Nelson-Barber requires all of
her students to keep a reflective
journal in order to connect their
personal experiences with the
topics discussed in presentations.
"Students often times feel a
strong sense of guilt after hearing
the stories of these Native Ameri
cans. These feelings can be voiced
in a journal," Nelson-Barber said.
"This type of pedagogy would also
be encouraged in the material

we're developing."
The new curriculum is target
ed at high schools in the Bay Area
that the TAs have contacted.
"The actual logistics relating
to the format are kind of nebulous
right now. It really depends on
what comes out of the students'
projects," said senior Maggie Har
rison, a TA. "In the meantime, we
have contacted schools around
the Bpy Area who are helping us
decide what the most useful form
of the curriculum would be."
Harrison said administrators
at one high school she had con
tacted — El Cerrito in the East
Bay — are "definitely interested
in using our material."
The project is targeted for
completion by the end of June so
that it can be used in high schools
by next year.
"We really want this material to
be used during Columbus Day next
year as a reflection on what truly
happened in 1492," Harrison said.
"George Bush is planning a huge
500 th anniversary parade for the
day, which will most likely be met
with protest by people who under
stand what we are trying to say."
The funding for the class'
guest speakers comes from vari
ous groups: the Haas Public Ser
vice Center, the Office of Multi
cultural Development, the ASSU
and Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford.
The continuation of the class
next year depends upon whether
these funds will still be available,
Nelson-Barber said. Budget cuts
— which are affecting all areas of
the University — may force its
cancellation next year, she said.
But if the future of the class
were dependent upon student
feedback, its survival would not
be in question.
"I love this class. It really gives
a thorough look at the U.S. Indi
an population," said freshman
Justin Sears. "I thought I knew a
lot, but it's so different from
what I learned about Native
Americans in grade school and
high school. Before this year, I
didn't have an accurate under
standing at all."
