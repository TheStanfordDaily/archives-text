# 'The three-year itch'
## More and more students are getting... divorces? 
### Michael McCarroll Staff writer 
Stanford student couples are divorc
ing in rapidly increasing numbers,
according to local attorneys and ASSU
Legal Counseling Office statistics.
"The student caseload has grown signif
icantly in the past several years," said Linda
Frielson, a Redwood City divorce attorney,
who has handled several Stanford divorces.
The ASSU's legal counseling office has
seen its number of family law cases almost
double in the last three years. In 1987-88
it had 36 family law cases; it handled 62 in
1990-91 and 29 last quarter alone.
Family law cases include custody and
paternity suits and adoption proceedings,
as well as divorces. But Ross Meyers, a
consultant at the Divorce Centers of Cal
ifornia in San Mateo, said "the number of
student divorces has definitely gone up."
The national divorce rate increased
dramatically in the 1980s. But student
divorce rates have risen "as fast or faster
than national averages," Frielson said.
Both Meyers and Frielson said they have
observed a trend toward shorter marriages
among students. "The seven-year itch has
become the three-year itch," Meyers said.
Although- legal counseling office
employees occasionally handle cases of
divorce between undergraduates, the
majority of Stanford cases involve gradu

ate students, according to Jewel Hudson,
a representative of the office.
Associate Dean of Memorial Church
Floyd Thompkins, who counsels many
student couples, attributes the increas
ing divorce rate to "the pressures of
academia and marital problems."
Thompkins called graduate school "a
time of redefining relationships."
"Folks are trying to do second
careers," he said. "With any kind of life
change there are going to be problems of
adjustment."
Students are usually spared several of
the hassles of "real-world" divorces, such
as child custody and community property
battles, Meyers said.
But they are often hit hardest by the
expense of divorce. Increasingly, students
unable to hire expensive private attorneys
instead utilize divorce consultants, who
prepare and process the forms and enable
students to handle their own divorces.
Frielson said few students can afford
her $35-per-hour fee. "The work I do
with Stanford people mostly involves
graduate students who have some worlc
experience," she said.
"Students seldom have the money to
hire attorneys to do all the work," Mey
ers said. "They tend to be more practical,
and see no need to hire an attorney when
most procedures can be worked out with
out one."
