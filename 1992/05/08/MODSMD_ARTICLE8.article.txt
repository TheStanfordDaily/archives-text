# Alaskan students visit Stanford for powwow
## 
### Liesl Olson Staff writer 
From 50 below zero to 80 above, six Native Amer
ican high schoolers are making the climate and cul
ture change from Ruby, Alaska to Stanford, Califor
nia this week.
They arrived Monday night and will be staying
through Saturday to attend the 21st annual Stan
ford powwow, the largest Native American celebra
tion in the country.
Wendell Bruckner — who is originally from Fair
banks, Alaska and graduated from Stanford last
June — teaches the students at the 58-student
school in Ruby, located in the Yukon territory in the
state *8 southwest corner.
Bruckner said he came up with the idea of bring
ing them from the school to the continental United

States in a dream he had during the "nightfall," a
six-month period of no sunlight in Ruby that "makes
people want to get out."
"Most of these kids don't even get out of the
state," Bruckner said. "I really just wanted to blow
their minds."
The students — who range in age from ninth to
12th grade — each contributed $200 for the trip, and
then raised the rest of the money themselves through
fund-raising projects, Bruckner said. They organized
dinners, raffled off a donated sled and helped rebuild
a donated jeep that was then sold for $1,500, he said.
On Wednesday, they were guest speakers in
Anthropology Lecturer Sharon Nelson-Barber's
class, "American Indian Ways of Knowing: 500
Years of Change and Continuity."
