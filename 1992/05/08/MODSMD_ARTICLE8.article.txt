# Alaskan students visit Stanford for powwow
## 
### Liesl Olson Staff writer 
From 50 below zero to 80 above, six Native Amer
ican high schoolers are making the climate and cul
ture change from Ruby, Alaska to Stanford, Califor
nia this week.
They arrived Monday night and will be staying
through Saturday to attend the 21st annual Stan
ford powwow, the largest Native American celebra
tion in the country.
Wendell Bruckner — who is originally from Fair
banks, Alaska and graduated from Stanford last
June — teaches the students at the 58-student
school in Ruby, located in the Yukon territory in the
state *8 southwest corner.
Bruckner said he came up with the idea of bring
ing them from the school to the continental United

States in a dream he had during the "nightfall," a
six-month period of no sunlight in Ruby that "makes
people want to get out."
"Most of these kids don't even get out of the
state," Bruckner said. "I really just wanted to blow
their minds."
The students — who range in age from ninth to
12th grade — each contributed $200 for the trip, and
then raised the rest of the money themselves through
fund-raising projects, Bruckner said. They organized
dinners, raffled off a donated sled and helped rebuild
a donated jeep that was then sold for $1,500, he said.
On Wednesday, they were guest speakers in
Anthropology Lecturer Sharon Nelson-Barber's
class, "American Indian Ways of Knowing: 500
Years of Change and Continuity."

Six high school students (and two chaperones) from Ruby, Alaska, have come to Stanford this week to
attend the Stanford powwow, the largest Native American celebration in the country.
The class examines issues
related to the "discovery" of the
Americas by Western civilization
from a native American perspec
tive. Nelson-Barber said a prime
focus is placed upon histories of
resistance, which challenge the
prevailing idea that Native Amer
icans are "invisible or dead."
The students presented their
continuing way of life through a
slide show, along with commen
tary on everything from Native
American art and sled-making to
the annual Alaskan dog-race, the
Iditerod.
Stanford students' often com
plex and specific questions were
met with direct answers from the
Native American students.
Each of the six students spoke
on an aspect of life in the remote
town of Ruby, often focusing on the
adaptations they must make to live
in temperatures that sometimes
drop to 50 degrees below zero.
"By giving these presenta
tions, the students realize how
much information they really
know and how much they have to
offer," Bruckner said. "They re
think who they are."
The students are visiting Stan
ford until Saturday, staying at
Muwekma-tah-ruk, the Native
American theme house.
Arnold Cappain, one of the
Alaskan students, voiced his
impression of Stanford quite suc
cinctly. "It's so big," he said.
The group is also traveling to
Navaho, Hopi and Zuni reserva
tions in the Southwest.
