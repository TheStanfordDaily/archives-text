# Totenberg blasts Senate on Thomas hearing

### Miranda Doyle Julia Sobrevilla Editorial staff 
Calling the Senate investigation
at which she was forced to testify
"a fool's errand," National Public
Radio reporter Nina Totenberg
last night ridiculed the U.S. Senate
and its judiciary committee.
Totenberg, one of two reporters
who broke the story ol Anita Hill's
accusations of sexual harassment,
refused to cooperate last month
with the committee's investiga
tion into how she had obtained the
leaked FBI report detailing Hill's
accusations.
Last night, Totenberg told an
insider's story of how Capitol Hill
responded to Hill's charges. More
than 500 people crowded into
Kresge Auditorium to hear her
speech.
Totenberg said the FBI report
reached the committee only two
days before the hearing, and
added that two senators on the
committee didn't even know
about the report until they heard
her story on the air.
Totenberg said her 12-minute
story, broadcast Oct. 6, was done
carefully.
"No one — no one — has dis
puted the accuracy or basic truth
of my story," she said.
After the story came out, she
said, the Democrats had a chance
to "set any time frame" for an
investigation — but allowed only
two days.
In that amount of time, a thor
ough investigation "can't be done
by the best investigator in the
world — and I guarantee you the
Senate judiciary committee does
not have the best investigators in
the world," she said.
During the hearings, "the Republi
can strategy was to attack Anita Hill
and the Democratic strategy was
'duck and cover,' to hide under the
table," Totenberg said.
She said the committee made
another mistake by not calling for
mer Equal Employment Opportu
nity Commission employee Angela
Wright, another Thomas accuser.

If Wright had been making an
allegation that was untrue, she
should have been exposed, Toten
berg argued; if not, she should
have been heard.
"Maybe some time in future
years we will find out about the
deals made" during the hearings,
she said.
Totenberg also questioned the
committee's dismissal of Hill's
accusations.
"Who told the truth? I have a
tentative opinion . . . but I don't
know and neither do you," she
said. "The reason you don't know
is the Senate didn't do its job."
After confirming Thomas, the
committee conducted an investi
gation to find out who had leaked
the story to Totenberg.
"When it was over, of course,
the senate had to blame somebody
and it would be moi," Totenberg

joked.
Totenberg said she thought no
lawyer would take the commit
tee's prosecution job "because
they knew it was a fool's errand."
"Well, they found a fool to do
it," she said.
Totenberg said she at first
declined prosecutor Peter Flem
ing's invitation "for a chat." The
committee after subpoenaed Toten
berg to testify.
Fleming had a difficult job dur
ing the investigation because the
revelations "may have been an
embarrassment, but that's all. It
was not a crime," Totenberg said.
She calculated that the prose
cutors logged about 4,000 hours,
costing "about $1 million of tax
payers' money." The news organi
zations also spent $300,000 to
$400,000 on attorneys, according
to Totenberg.

"That's a lot of money for a
fool's errand," she said.
When the investigation's 170-
page report was released Tuesday,
it revealed that "of course, IFlem
ing] couldn't figure out where I
got the story from. The report,
frankly, was stupid," Totenberg
said.
"The man has no idea of how
[journalists] work or what we do,"
she said, comparing the shoddi
ness of Fleming's report to read
ing "a meat inspector's report on
a botany convention."
But the consequences of the
hearing and the investigation
may not be all bad, Totenberg
said.
"Do you really think in the
future if someone has informa
tion they'll give it to the United
States Senate? No. They're going
to give it to me."
