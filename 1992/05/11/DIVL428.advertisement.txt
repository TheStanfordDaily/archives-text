GAYLE GREENE
/ author of
CHANGING THE STORY: FEMINIST FICTION
AND THE TRADITION
GAYLE GREENE is Professor of English at Scripps College. She is cocditor of The Woman & Part: Feminist
Criticism of Shakespeare and Making a Difference: Feminist Literary Criticism. She has published numerous articles
in Novel, Contemporary Literature and Signs.
"What I liked most about this book was its sense of engagement with its material. Greene writes about novels as
though they really matter (which they do) and I have never seen a better or fairer account of the way male critics
have tended to dismiss the women writers of the 1960s and 19705. Although Greene ends on a note of qualified
pessimism, as she surveys some aspects of post-feminism, this is also a curiously cheering book, which reminds us
that literature can change us, and that through it we can change ourselves. So there is a future, after all!"
