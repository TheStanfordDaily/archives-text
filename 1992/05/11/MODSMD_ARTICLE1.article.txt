# Gorbachev makes encore Stanford appearance
## Former president of Soviet Union defends transformation he led 
### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
Returning to campus on Saturday, former Sovi
et President Mikhail Gorbachev delivered a speech
defending his leadership, toured an exhibit of Sovi
et memorabilia at the Hoover Institution and "did
lunch" with University and local officials.
Gorbachev's speech, entitled "The Rule of
Law," was the public highlight of his second visit
to Stanford. Gorbachev first visited the University
in 1990, when he was still head of the USSR.
"As president of a country, I had many powers,
including emergency ones. And more than once,
people tried to make me use them, tried to push me
into an extremist position," Gorbachev told a Frost
Ampitheater crowd of about 9,500 students, facul
ty and staff.
"But I simply could not betray myself," he said,
noting that he was the first leader in recent history
to achieve a "cardinal transformation" of Russian
or Soviet society without significant bloodshed.
Gorbachev is touring seven U.S. cities to garner
support and raise money for his non-profit Gorbachev
Foundation/USA, which was founded to promote
democratic reform in the former Soviet republics.
Demonstrating how quickly he has picked up
capitalist ways, the former communist leader
elicited laughter from the crowd when he plugged
his soon-to-be-published memoirs.
"I've been asked about my motives, my various
positions and decisions, and in my memoirs, I've
tried to answer these questions," he said.
"I hope that when this book appears, you'll be
willing to expend a certain sum of money to
acquire it,"he quipped.
But the lecture was generally serious, as Gor
bachev acknowledged the historical difficulty of
establishing the rule of law in his country.
