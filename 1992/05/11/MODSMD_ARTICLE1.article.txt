# Gorbachev makes encore Stanford appearance
## Former president of Soviet Union defends transformation he led 
### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
Returning to campus on Saturday, former Sovi
et President Mikhail Gorbachev delivered a speech
defending his leadership, toured an exhibit of Sovi
et memorabilia at the Hoover Institution and "did
lunch" with University and local officials.
Gorbachev's speech, entitled "The Rule of
Law," was the public highlight of his second visit
to Stanford. Gorbachev first visited the University
in 1990, when he was still head of the USSR.
"As president of a country, I had many powers,
including emergency ones. And more than once,
people tried to make me use them, tried to push me
into an extremist position," Gorbachev told a Frost
Ampitheater crowd of about 9,500 students, facul
ty and staff.
"But I simply could not betray myself," he said,
noting that he was the first leader in recent history
to achieve a "cardinal transformation" of Russian
or Soviet society without significant bloodshed.
Gorbachev is touring seven U.S. cities to garner
support and raise money for his non-profit Gorbachev
Foundation/USA, which was founded to promote
democratic reform in the former Soviet republics.
Demonstrating how quickly he has picked up
capitalist ways, the former communist leader
elicited laughter from the crowd when he plugged
his soon-to-be-published memoirs.
"I've been asked about my motives, my various
positions and decisions, and in my memoirs, I've
tried to answer these questions," he said.
"I hope that when this book appears, you'll be
willing to expend a certain sum of money to
acquire it,"he quipped.
But the lecture was generally serious, as Gor
bachev acknowledged the historical difficulty of
establishing the rule of law in his country.

speech titled "The Rule of Law" at Frost Amphitheater earlier Saturday.
"Our road ahead to the rule of
law is burdened by our dark her
itage, [by] the distorted attitude of
our society to law .. . the histori
cally conditioned disrespect for
law and our hostility toward those
who are professionally responsible
for the preservation of order."
His talk was briefly interrupted
when two protesters carrying a red
banner and wearing T-shirts that
read "Mao, more than ever,"
marched through the crowd. They
were quickly escorted out of the
audience by security, questioned
by Stanford Police and released.
In his review of the dramatic
changes such as perestroika —
the reform and restructuring of
Soviet society — that swept over
his country during his rule, Gor
bachev defended himself against
critics who called his behavior
"irresolute" during the abortive
coup and breakup of the Soviet
Union in 1991.
"Many [of these people] would
like ... to present themselves as
decisive politicians. But when put
to the test, such decisiveness is
only a flouting of the realities and
violence against the people," Gor
bachev said.
"And this is no longer politics
at all. To me, decisiveness means
sticking to my guns, pursuing
profound transformations at the
center of which lie the liberties of
the individual," he continued.
Following his speech, Gor
bachev was presented with the Law
School's Herman Phleger Visiting
Professorship. The professorship,
established in 1972, provides for
people "of high distinction in the
law" to deliver lectures at Stanford.
While few were surprised by
anything that Gorbachev said,
observers said that he offered a
fresh perspective on his personal
role in the restructuring of the
Soviet Union.
Former U.S. Secretary of State
and Hoover Distinguished Fellow
George Shultz agreed.
"He tried to give us his view of
what had happened in his coun
try," Shultz said. "As he said in a
private exchange, if you have
never lived in a totalitarian soci
ety, you don't appreciate what it
is to live under the rule of law."
After the speech, Gorbachev
and his wife Raisa viewed part of
the Hoover Institution's archives
on the 1917 revolution that creat
ed the USSR, an exhibit they
were to have seen when they first
visited Stanford but skipped for
lack of time. They then had lunch
at Hoover with approximately
140 guests.
Following the luncheon, the
Gorbachevs went to the top of
Hoover Tower and waved at a
small crowd of onlookers stand

Shultz' house where they relaxed
and had a "small dinner party"
before leaving campus at 10 p.m.,
according to Shultz.

Soviet leader addressed a $1,000-
a-plate fundrasing dinner in San
Francisco, also hosted by Schultz.
Gorbachev hopes to raise $3 mil
lion for his foundation during his
two-week tour of the U.S.
The foundation may be head
quartered in the Presidio in San
Francisco, which is slated to
become a National Recreation
Area in 1995, according to the
Associated Press.
Some commented on the irony
of Gorbachev's visit to the
Hoover Institution.
"Hoover was founded on notions
of anti-communism and war, revo
lution and peace and here's the
man, who despite himself, did more
to destroy communism than
Hoover could have ever hoped,"
Rice said. "It's a rather interesting
irony but nonetheless it seems like
some sort of poetic justice."
The Gorbachevs' second visit to
Stanford was significantly more
relaxed than their first, organizers
said, as there were fewer security
concerns and the Gorbachevs were
on a much more flexible schedule.
Overall, Shultz said, "It was a
good visit for Stanford and for
Hoover."
