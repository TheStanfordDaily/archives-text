# Brown says students worried about 'tuition and the future'
## 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Ousted from Terra House
because of University policy, local
campaign planners for presiden
tial candidate Jerry Brown quick
ly relocated to a local church and
went ahead with plans to hold a
fund-raiser Saturday.
Brown, who made a 20-minute
appearance, was surrounded by
supporters as he posed with a baby,
shook hands and signed autographs
before heading for the microphone
to deliver a short speech.
A crowd of about 75 gathered
at the new location, University
Lutheran Church, for the $10
luncheon.
Organizer Mary Sauer said Uni
versity officials told the campaign
Thursday that political fund-raisers
cannot be held on campus, so it was
moved from Terra to the church at
Bowdoin and Stanford Avenue.
"Regardless of where the fund
raiser is held, the campaign must
go on," she said. "We can't con
tinue without funds."
Stanford for Brown club mem
ber Rafe Sagarin, a Terra resi
dent, said he was disappointed by
the change. Only a few students
showed up for the event.
Participants gathered on the
lawn for a meal that included
pizza, fruit and bread. While wait
ing for Brown to arrive, they lis
tened to protest songs that
mocked President Bush.

Brown appeared a little after
2:30 p.m., appearing harried but
honoring requests for autographs
and handshakes.
Brown refused food offered by
organizers. "It's for the people,
not for me," he said.
In a brief interview, Brown said
students are worried about "tuition
and the future." He called for more
federally funded schplarships and
added that "universities need to be
more efficient in cutting costs."
Students' "futures are in jeop
ardy," Brown said. "The big thing
is will there be jobs, will there be
an environment?"
"The truth is that America is
losing its leadership," he contin
ued. "Students ought to be build
ing a new movement."
During his stay at the church,
Brown posed for photos while hold
ing 3-month-old Jordan Shaw, the
daughter of Carolyn Shaw and her
husband Don, who is the Stanford
women's volleyball coach.
Carolyn Shaw said Brown is a
family friend, calling him Jor
dan's "Uncle Jerry."
Brown then gave his short
speech from a sunny spot on the
lawn. "You're all sitting in the
shade. You don't trust the ozone
layer," he joked, echoing a speech
on environmental issues he gave
earlier in White Plaza.
Brown called for full employ
ment, a healthy economy and
decent wages. A country that can
"put a man on the moon and a
missile down an air conditioner
pipe in Iraq" should be able to
employ its citizens, he said.
The conditions that sparked
the riots in Los Angeles exist "in
cities all over this country," he
said, and the United States needs
a "confrontation with the corrupt
status quo" to deal with them.
"There are so many good
things that can be done. We did
them in California," and they
could be done again "if we had the
political will," Brown said.
It is difficult to keep going, he
said, "with opponents piling up
delegates."
When he finished speaking,
Brown quickly made his way back
to his van, greeting a few well
wishers who urged him to contin
ue his campaign.
"Thanks for sticking with it,"
one supporter told him, and a
woman shouted "Good luck,
Jerry. We love you," as he drove
away in his black van.
"He looked tired," Sauer said
after Brown left.
Sagarin said he talked with
Brown briefly at the fund-raiser
and gave him a T-shirt reading,
"No more verdicts of chaos."
Brown voices "a lot of thoughts
that are in my head," Sagarin
said. "Don't count him out. ... I
still think he's for real."
