Exposing homophobia
one step in eradicating
anti-gay discrimination

BGLAD - BISEXUAL, GAY
and Lesbian Awareness
Days — celebrated gay, les
bian and bisexual identities at
Stanford through a melange of
social events that came to a con
clusion yesterday.
These days ought to alert us to
the widespread prevalence of homo
phobic sentiment and violence,
reflected both in societal attitudes
and in the nature of the anti-sodomy
laws in place in this country.
Gays, lesbians and bisexuals are
frequently made the target of hate
violence. Even in San Francisco,
which is probably among the bet
ter places to be if you're gay, a
Stanford undergraduate was
recently hit in the face merely
because he was walking hand in
hand with another man.
•The police often are not very
helpful in protecting the civil liber
ties of gays and lesbians. The treat
ment of gays during the recent
arrests of those who were protest
ing the Rodney King verdict at San
Francisco is a case in point.
Of the hundreds of people who
were arrested on the night of May
1, 19 men identified as gay were
thrown into a separate cell, where
they did not receive food for an
entire day.
Indicative of the quarantine
mentality of the police was a hand
scrawled piece of paper taped to
the metal door of their cell, read
ing "HOMOS."
The general treatment of the
arrested protesters was deplorable
and displayed a blatant disregard for
civil rights; the treatment of gays
and lesbians was outrageous and
flouted any sort of moral standard.
On campus, gay, lesbian and
bisexual activists are often threat
ened with hate messages, which
are left on their answering ma

chines or delivered to them in
passing. The presence of archaic
Puritan values and a hypocritical
sense of moral superiority aired
itself when the domestic partners
housing bill did not pass without
significant opposition.
As we absolutely would not tol
erate racism expressed in a similar
nature, we also should be equally
unwilling to put up with flagrant
displays of homophobia.
During the BGLAD week, for
example, part of a function at the
Coffee House was disrupted by
protestors expressing homophobic
sentiment. Also, fliers placed
around campus announcing pro
grams for the event were defaced.
In 1992, homosexuality is ille
gal in 25 states in this country —
including many Southern states
like Georgia, Mississippi and sur
prisingly, the District of Columbia.
Presidential candidate Bill Clin
ton's home state of Arkansas decrees
consensual sex in private among peo
ple of the same sex to be punishable
by up to one year in prison.
The New Republic notes that
according to the FBI, 107,600
arrests were made for sodomy
nationwide in 1990. What an
appropriate task for that venerable
organization devoted to the preser
vation of internal civil harmony
that hounded civil rights leaders in
the '60s.
Last year, Governor Wilson
vetoed AB 101 — the bill that would
have made it illegal for employers to
discriminate on the basis of sexual
orientation — despite the fact that
it had strong support from the peo
ple of the state.
This bill would have broadened
the scope of already existing legis
lation that enacts similar anti-dis
crimination law along the lines of
race and gender.
For these reasons, events like
BGLAD week become all the more
imperative. Institutionalized dis
crimination and the expression of
individual homophobic sentiment
are contemptible and the hate that
underlies them both must be toler
ated no longer.
