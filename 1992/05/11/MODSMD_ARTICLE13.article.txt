Dimitric's letter full of blatant lies; racist against Croats

IHAVE BEEN following the corre
spondence concerning the Hoover
Institution incident involving former
director W. Glenn Campbell in your
paper for a while now, with increased
feelings of disgust and indignation.
Obviously, this whole story has
deserved much attention because it is
ugly enough: An individual allegedly
made racist comments and another indi
vidual resorted to a dirty little trick of
taping the conversation so that he could
use it for his own dark purposes.
Some of the details are hilarious, such
as Visiting Scholar Srdjan Triflkovic's
refusal to release the tape. Unfortunate
ly, there are very disturbing details as
well: Some letters are completely unac
ceptable, such as the outrageously racist
letter by a certain Rad Dimitric, a "Stan
ford scholar," which appeared in Friday's
issue of The Daily.

I am deeply offended by Dimitric's
statement that Croats are . .a nation
guilty of war crimes in the past as well as
today."
First of all, "Croats" did not kill Jews.
The atrocities in Croatia during World
War II were committed by an extreme
nationalistic fraction, Ustashi, which was
established in power by the German gov
ernment. A large majority of Croatian
people opposed this puppet Nazi regime
â€” not only by refusing to collaborate, but
by participating in the resistance move
ment or hiding and aiding the prosecuted.
My grandfather, who was an innkeep
er in Kordun, helped close to 100 Serbian
and Jewish families to escape to free ter
ritory, to Partisans. His sister, a Partisan
soldier, was killed by Ustashi.
It needs to be stressed that their exam
ples were by no means unique. Even the
main leader of the Partisan movement,

Tito, was a Croat. It hurts me deeply
when Dimitric refers to my people as "a
nation guilty of war crimes"; his state
ment is not only criminally racist, it is a
blatant lie.
Second, it is unbelievable that Dim
itric has the guts to say that this same
Croatian nation is guilty of war crimes
today, in this "cruel war in the Balkans,"
as he himself calls it. In this truly horri
ble and senseless war, it is the Serbian
Chetnik troops and the overwhelmingly
Serbian "Yugoslav People's Army" that
have exterminated tens of thousands of
Croats and Muslims.
An important distinction needs to be
made here: It is not the Serbian nation
that is guilty of these war crimes, but the
murderous extremists supported by Milo
sevic's regime in Belgrade.
Just recently, the Yugoslav Army and
Serbian paramilitary formations bombed

a bridge in Bosnia that was teeming with
refugees, killing the Muslim and Croatian
women and children without any remorse.
And still, the Milosevic propaganda
keeps trying to convince the world that
"Croats are guilty of war crimes today."
What is their guilt? That they refuse to
become absolutely passive victims?
Racism by itself is cruel, horrible and
unacceptable. Racism combined with
intentionally fabricated lies is even
worse. By all fairness, Stanford Universi
ty should not extend the hospitality to
Dimitric any longer.
His outrageous slurs are an insult not
only to the members of the Croatian com
munity here, but to all the students, staff
and faculty who cherish democracy and
truth above all.
