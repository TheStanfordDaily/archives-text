# How can Green library limit hours even more?
## 
### 
I am appalled by the "pretty definite"
plan to curtail the hours of Green
Library â€” a plan that seems to have
originated in a mysterious department
called "Access Services."
Green already has some of the most
limited hours of any research library in
the country.
Scholars who visit here are surprised
to find that it closes its doors at 6 p.m.
on Fridays and Saturdays and doesn't
open its doors until noon on Sundays,
not to mention the early closing times
during vacations and summer. Such lim
ited hours make one wonder about the
University's priorities.
In case you haven't noticed, Green's
services are already in a state of decline.
Pikes of books accumulate for days next
to copy machines, on tan "reshelving"

shelves and on study desks before they
begin the weeks-long journey back to
their proper addresses in the stacks.
This is only the most visible example
of the effects of cuts in the library's
staff.
If Libraries and Information
Resources needs to trim $75-$lOO,OOO
from its budget, why doesn't it axe Vice
President Bob Street? Surely his salary
must be in the ballpark and clearly he
has no understanding of the life of the
mind to propose such cutbacks in week
day library hours.
If Street's superiors allow such poor
judgement to prevail, the University will
only further undermine its alleged com
mitment to students and scholars of the
humanities and social sciences.
I call on all library patrons to raise
your voices now, in loud protest, before
it is too late.
