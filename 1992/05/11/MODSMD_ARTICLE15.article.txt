# Unfair to cry 'racism' when stopped by cops
## 
### 
Recent letters to The Daily have crit
icized police officers, claiming that
minorities are "randomly" stopped and
that these are "racist actions." I
believe, however, that this happens to
all ethnic groups and it is unfair to cry
"racism" because one happens to be a
minority.
Last year, when I lived on campus, I
was walking along Campus Drive late at
night carrying books and computer print
outs, hardly looking like a criminal.
A police officer was driving on the
other side of the street when he suddenly
slowed down and fixed his steely glare on
me. The cruiser whipped around and I
heard the engine racing toward me.
He flipped on the lights, pulled right
up behind me and swiftly got out of the
car.

I asked him if there was a problem,
and he asked where I was coming from.
When I said I had been at the computer
center, he demanded my ID.
I asked him what was going on and he
then told me that someone had reported
a prowler, described only as "a big white
guy" and said I seemed to fit the descrip
tion.
Is this racist? No. Even though I felt
singled out and "guilty until proven inno
cent," the police officer was just doing his
job. But if I were to agree with the logic of
previous letters, then I would suppose I
was a victim of racism right here on the
Stanford campus.
My point is this: The next time you
feel treated unjustly, try to remember it
happens to others as well. I often feel dis
respectfully treated, too.
I've cited one example that is similar
to what others claim is racism. It isn't
always racism — it's usually reality.
