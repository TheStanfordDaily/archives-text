## Order restored, not justice 
### 
Forgive and forget - that's
what President Bush would like us
to do.
Forgive him for his neglect of the
nation's cities, and forget the acquittals of
the four L.A. police officers who beat Rod
ney King. Not once in the speech he gave
Friday after his tour of South-Central Los
Angeles did Bush mention the verdict.
Bush would just as soon have us forget
that verdict — and the fundamental
racial divides present in our society the
verdict represented. The riots, on the
other hand, the president will never allow
us to forget.
Of course, none of this is really sur
prising. Bush, like any good politician,
wants to keep things simple. And law and
order is a much simpler concept than
racial equality.
The absence of law and order is easily
measured: People die; property is
destroyed or stolen. And the riots are
quickly classified as the evil doings of
"hoodlums." Meanwhile, the restoration
of law and order, though often difficult,
follows a basic roadmap: Use whatever
force necessary to return life to normal.
By contrast, the concepts of justice
and equality don't come with a handy lit
mus strip to tell us how we're doing. Yes,
the video tape of King's beating was (we
thought) unequivocal. But it was an
anomaly. Most injustice does not get cap
tured on film.

Part of the difficulty stems from the
subjective nature of justice, which
implies a judgment about fairness. Order,
on the other hand, is an objective quanti
ty; it's easy to mobilize at the first sign of
chaos. And in contrast to the roadmap for
the restoration of order, there is no set
plan for creating justice.
In the past, there have been specific
injustices to target — for instance, the
fact that some people weren't allowed to
vote. In such an example, our energy can
be directed toward a particular goal;
there is an obvious carrot in front of us.
Similarly, if particular laws allow for
racial discrimination, again there's a dis
crete goal to rally around.
But the goals today are not so easily
pinpointed. Consider the following symp
tom of just some of what's wrong (from a
New York Times editorial Thursday):
Black men, though they make up only 6
percent of the nation's population, com
prise 47 percent of the country's prison
population. And about 25 percent of all
young black men are in the criminal jus
tice system at a given point in time, that is,
in jail or prison, on probation or on parole.
No matter how many times these
statistics are read, the dumbfoundedness
doesn't recede. What kind of society do
we live in where one-fourth of any group
of people is not a productive, functioning
segment of that society?
Answers — they're not apparent.

'The atten
tion span is
not so short it
can't remem
ber. We must
not forget.'

Questions — they roll through the mind
unimpeded.
How do we live with ourselves know
ing so many people are failing in or have
been failed by the American experiment?
How do we even begin to improve mat
ters when we can't just hit reset and start
the game again? (Though there is a sense
that the screen is about to flash the
words: "Game Over.")
React. Blame. Spin. Forget. When
Bush toured gutted Los Angeles in his
armored limousine, he must have been
shocked; he must have been hurt — he's
human. Or did he only see "hoodlums"?
Did he only see black "hoodlums"?
Appalled. Tough. Decisive. Forget.
Bush wants new approaches. When will
they come?
Beating. Acquittal. Protest. Riot. Let
ters. Discussion. Continue; don't forget.
The attention span is not so short it can't
remember. We must not forget.
So much needs to be done; no one
knows what exactly — all the more rea
son to try. Now. And then again tomor
row. This happened less than two weeks
ago. The headlines are gone. Order
restored, not justice. We must not forget.

we live in where one-fourth of any group
of people is not a productive, functioning
segment of that society?
Answers — they're not apparent.

'The atten
tion span is
not so short it
can't remem
ber. We must
not forget.'

Questions — they roll through the mind
unimpeded.
How do we live with ourselves know
ing so many people are failing in or have
been failed by the American experiment?
How do we even begin to improve mat
ters when we can't just hit reset and start
the game again? (Though there is a sense
that the screen is about to flash the
words: "Game Over.")
React. Blame. Spin. Forget. When
Bush toured gutted Los Angeles in his
armored limousine, he must have been
shocked; he must have been hurt — he's
human. Or did he only see "hoodlums"?
Did he only see black "hoodlums"?
Appalled. Tough. Decisive. Forget.
Bush wants new approaches. When will
they come?
Beating. Acquittal. Protest. Riot. Let
ters. Discussion. Continue; don't forget.
The attention span is not so short it can't
remember. We must not forget.
So much needs to be done; no one
knows what exactly — all the more rea
son to try. Now. And then again tomor
row. This happened less than two weeks
ago. The headlines are gone. Order
restored, not justice. We must not forget.
