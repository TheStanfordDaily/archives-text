As Mikhail Gorbachev toured a collection of
Russian revolutionary artifacts at the Hoover
Institution Saturday, the leader who resigned
from his post earlier this year seemed most inter
ested in a document written by another Russian
leader forced to give up power.
The document was an annotated final draft of a
statement — issued by Czar Nicholas II during the
1917 revolution — abdicating the throne of Rus
sia, said former U.S. Secretary of State and Hoover
Distinguished Fellow George Shultz.
Shultz said he thought Gorbachev was interest
ed in the document because it illustrated a "missed
opportunity" by the revolutionaries to turn the
country away from totalitarianism.
Hoover Archivist Anne Van Camp, who led the
tour, called the statement "one of the most impor
tant documents we have in our collection."
After the 20-minute tour, Gorbachev attended a
Hoover luncheon with about 140 guests, said
Hoover Director John Raisian. He said Gorbachev
seemed to enjoy the lunch, especially when two
Russian-American musicians played and sang tra
ditional folk songs during dessert.
"The Gorbachevs really got into it," Raisian said.
"They were singing and all of us were clapping."
According to Hoover Deputy Director Charles
Palm, Gorbachev at one point during the tour dis
cussed forming a relationship between Hoover and
the Gorbachev Foundation/USA, a group founded
to work for democratic reform in the former Sovi
et republics. However, he said no specific plans
were made.
"It was just very generally suggested that there
should be cooperation, but there were no details
yet," Palm said.
Raisian said he also had discussed the possibili
ty with Gorbachev of the two organizations work
ing together.
