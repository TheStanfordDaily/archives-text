# Tour of Hoover piques interest of Gorbachevs
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
As Mikhail Gorbachev toured a collection of
Russian revolutionary artifacts at the Hoover
Institution Saturday, the leader who resigned
from his post earlier this year seemed most inter
ested in a document written by another Russian
leader forced to give up power.
The document was an annotated final draft of a
statement — issued by Czar Nicholas II during the
1917 revolution — abdicating the throne of Rus
sia, said former U.S. Secretary of State and Hoover
Distinguished Fellow George Shultz.
Shultz said he thought Gorbachev was interest
ed in the document because it illustrated a "missed
opportunity" by the revolutionaries to turn the
country away from totalitarianism.
Hoover Archivist Anne Van Camp, who led the
tour, called the statement "one of the most impor
tant documents we have in our collection."
After the 20-minute tour, Gorbachev attended a
Hoover luncheon with about 140 guests, said
Hoover Director John Raisian. He said Gorbachev
seemed to enjoy the lunch, especially when two
Russian-American musicians played and sang tra
ditional folk songs during dessert.
"The Gorbachevs really got into it," Raisian said.
"They were singing and all of us were clapping."
According to Hoover Deputy Director Charles
Palm, Gorbachev at one point during the tour dis
cussed forming a relationship between Hoover and
the Gorbachev Foundation/USA, a group founded
to work for democratic reform in the former Sovi
et republics. However, he said no specific plans
were made.
"It was just very generally suggested that there
should be cooperation, but there were no details
yet," Palm said.
Raisian said he also had discussed the possibili
ty with Gorbachev of the two organizations work
ing together.

"We only casually talked about
it, but I talked about it at length
with his wife," Raisian said.
"I think that there's a possibil
ity (of a partnership) in particular
if the Gorbachev Foundation were
to have a presence here on the
West Coast," he added.
Speaking in San Francisco Fri
day, Gorbachev had mentioned
the possibility of locating a Foun
dation office in the Presidio.
At one point on the Hoover
tour, Shultz told Gorbachev he
"could take up residence at
Hoover" if he wanted to work at
the Institution.
Raisa Gorbachev firmly but
jokingly turned down the offer.
"He must first write his own
memoirs, and then work on the
memoirs of others," she said.
Van Camp gave a brief expla
nation of the historical back
ground of each item on the tour.
The Gorbachevs spoke rela
tively little during the tour, com
menting occasionally on the
items. They had little time to
inspect the individual items,
pausing for no more than a few
minutes at even the items they
seemed to like best.
Raisa Gorbachev seemed capti
vated by an illustrated volume of
poetry that was written around
1917 by Nikolai Gumilev, said
Van Camp, who called Gumilev a
"rather important Russian poet."
Mikhail Gorbachev called the
book "a very beautiful volume of
poetry," and said the author "died
as a result of repression."
Gumilev "said all of us are both
saints and thieves," Raisa Gor
bachev said. He wrote "we are
actors in the arena of Lord God,"
she added.
Palm said another item that
piqued Gorbachev's interest was a
map showing distribution sites in
Russia used by the American
Relief Administration, a group
President Herbert Hoover helped
run after World War I. One of the
sites was the town of Gorbachev's
birth. The former Soviet president
knelt down to examine the map,
smiling as he saw his hometown.
Also on display was an original
1920 edition of a book detailing
the history of the secret police in
Russia, and a later edition of the
book published when Gorbachev

was president of the USSR. Gor
bachev, who owns a copy of the
book, said "now everyone may
have it because of glasnost."
According to Van Camp, the
display Gorbachev saw was origi
nally put together two years ago
for the leader's first visit to cam
pus. But Gorbachev did not visit
the Institution then, she said, so
Hoover recreated the exhibit for
Saturday's visit.
Gorbachev was initially sched
uled to visit Hoover two years ago,
but crossed the Institution off his
itinerary just before his arrival on
campus, "because of the tight tim
ing" of his visit, according to Sovi
et officials.

Some called the move political.
Raisian said he thought that when
Gorbachev's schedule became too
cluttered, Hoover — which Raisian
called "an anti-communist organi
zation" — may have been elimi
nated because a visit could have
been "politically uncomfortable."
"It's an incredible turn of
events for us to be talking to a guy
like Gorbachev about commonali
ties. It's striking," he said.
But Raisian said the discussions
show that Gorbachev is a
reformer, not that Hoover has
changed its stance on communism.
"The point is that he did really
accomplish a lot in letting the cat
out of the bag with glasnost,"

Raisian said.
After the tour, the Gorbachevs
signed Hoover's guest book,
copies of Gorbachev's books
owned by the Institution and a
portrait of Gorbachev.
Shultz then presented the Gor
bachevs with gifts. Raisa Gor
bachev was given copies of the
illustrated pages of Gumilev's
poetry book. "Thank you very
much," she said, in English.
Shultz gave Gorbachev a sculp
ture of a snow goose. H. Wheatly
Allen, the artist who created the
statue, told Gorbachev the snow
goose "travels freely — and has
for thousands of years — between
Russia and the United States."

At the luncheon, Raisian gave
Raisa Gorbachev a rare edition of
a book detailing the story of a
Russian diplomat falling in love
with a Spanish official's daughter.
Gorbachev received a square,
brass desk clock from Tiffany's.
After the lunch, Shultz said,
the Gorbachevs went to Hoover
Tower for a "tour of campus from
above." The Gorbachevs then
went to "relax" at Shultz's home,
where Shultz said he and Gor
bachev had "private discussions
and reminiscings" until 10 p.m.,
when Gorbachev left.

Shultz then presented the Gor
bachevs with gifts. Raisa Gor
bachev was given copies of the
illustrated pages of Gumilev's
poetry book. "Thank you very
much," she said, in English.
Shultz gave Gorbachev a sculp
ture of a snow goose. H. Wheatly
Allen, the artist who created the
statue, told Gorbachev the snow
goose "travels freely — and has
for thousands of years — between
Russia and the United States."

At the luncheon, Raisian gave
Raisa Gorbachev a rare edition of
a book detailing the story of a
Russian diplomat falling in love
with a Spanish official's daughter.
Gorbachev received a square,
brass desk clock from Tiffany's.
After the lunch, Shultz said,
the Gorbachevs went to Hoover
Tower for a "tour of campus from
above." The Gorbachevs then
went to "relax" at Shultz's home,
where Shultz said he and Gor
bachev had "private discussions
and reminiscings" until 10 p.m.,
when Gorbachev left.

Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev examine a plaque on display in a Hoover Institution exhibit during their tour Saturday. Titled "Long Live the
Sun," the plaque is a copy of a print presented to Gorbachev during his last visit to Stanford.
As Mikhail Gorbachev toured a collection of
Russian revolutionary artifacts at the Hoover
Institution Saturday, the leader who resigned
from his post earlier this year seemed most inter
ested in a document written by another Russian
leader forced to give up power.
The document was an annotated final draft of a
statement — issued by Czar Nicholas II during the
1917 revolution — abdicating the throne of Rus
sia, said former U.S. Secretary of State and Hoover
Distinguished Fellow George Shultz.
Shultz said he thought Gorbachev was interest
ed in the document because it illustrated a "missed
opportunity" by the revolutionaries to turn the
country away from totalitarianism.
Hoover Archivist Anne Van Camp, who led the
tour, called the statement "one of the most impor
tant documents we have in our collection."
After the 20-minute tour, Gorbachev attended a
Hoover luncheon with about 140 guests, said
Hoover Director John Raisian. He said Gorbachev
seemed to enjoy the lunch, especially when two
Russian-American musicians played and sang tra
ditional folk songs during dessert.
"The Gorbachevs really got into it," Raisian said.
"They were singing and all of us were clapping."
According to Hoover Deputy Director Charles
Palm, Gorbachev at one point during the tour dis
cussed forming a relationship between Hoover and
the Gorbachev Foundation/USA, a group founded
to work for democratic reform in the former Sovi
et republics. However, he said no specific plans
were made.
"It was just very generally suggested that there
should be cooperation, but there were no details
yet," Palm said.
Raisian said he also had discussed the possibili
ty with Gorbachev of the two organizations work
ing together.

"We only casually talked about
it, but I talked about it at length
with his wife," Raisian said.
"I think that there's a possibil
ity (of a partnership) in particular
if the Gorbachev Foundation were
to have a presence here on the
West Coast," he added.
Speaking in San Francisco Fri
day, Gorbachev had mentioned
the possibility of locating a Foun
dation office in the Presidio.
At one point on the Hoover
tour, Shultz told Gorbachev he
"could take up residence at
Hoover" if he wanted to work at
the Institution.
Raisa Gorbachev firmly but
jokingly turned down the offer.
"He must first write his own
memoirs, and then work on the
memoirs of others," she said.
Van Camp gave a brief expla
nation of the historical back
ground of each item on the tour.
The Gorbachevs spoke rela
tively little during the tour, com
menting occasionally on the
items. They had little time to
inspect the individual items,
pausing for no more than a few
minutes at even the items they
seemed to like best.
Raisa Gorbachev seemed capti
vated by an illustrated volume of
poetry that was written around
1917 by Nikolai Gumilev, said
Van Camp, who called Gumilev a
"rather important Russian poet."
Mikhail Gorbachev called the
book "a very beautiful volume of
poetry," and said the author "died
as a result of repression."
Gumilev "said all of us are both
saints and thieves," Raisa Gor
bachev said. He wrote "we are
actors in the arena of Lord God,"
she added.
Palm said another item that
piqued Gorbachev's interest was a
map showing distribution sites in
Russia used by the American
Relief Administration, a group
President Herbert Hoover helped
run after World War I. One of the
sites was the town of Gorbachev's
birth. The former Soviet president
knelt down to examine the map,
smiling as he saw his hometown.
Also on display was an original
1920 edition of a book detailing
the history of the secret police in
Russia, and a later edition of the
book published when Gorbachev

was president of the USSR. Gor
bachev, who owns a copy of the
book, said "now everyone may
have it because of glasnost."
According to Van Camp, the
display Gorbachev saw was origi
nally put together two years ago
for the leader's first visit to cam
pus. But Gorbachev did not visit
the Institution then, she said, so
Hoover recreated the exhibit for
Saturday's visit.
Gorbachev was initially sched
uled to visit Hoover two years ago,
but crossed the Institution off his
itinerary just before his arrival on
campus, "because of the tight tim
ing" of his visit, according to Sovi
et officials.

Some called the move political.
Raisian said he thought that when
Gorbachev's schedule became too
cluttered, Hoover — which Raisian
called "an anti-communist organi
zation" — may have been elimi
nated because a visit could have
been "politically uncomfortable."
"It's an incredible turn of
events for us to be talking to a guy
like Gorbachev about commonali
ties. It's striking," he said.
But Raisian said the discussions
show that Gorbachev is a
reformer, not that Hoover has
changed its stance on communism.
"The point is that he did really
accomplish a lot in letting the cat
out of the bag with glasnost,"

Raisian said.
After the tour, the Gorbachevs
signed Hoover's guest book,
copies of Gorbachev's books
owned by the Institution and a
portrait of Gorbachev.
Shultz then presented the Gor
bachevs with gifts. Raisa Gor
bachev was given copies of the
illustrated pages of Gumilev's
poetry book. "Thank you very
much," she said, in English.
Shultz gave Gorbachev a sculp
