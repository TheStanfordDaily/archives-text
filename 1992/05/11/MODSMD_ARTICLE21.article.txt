# GORBACHEV AT STANFORD
## Few protesters appear at speech Demonstration by Serbian group doesn't materialize 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Unlike the large demonstrations that accompa
nied former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's
first tour of the United States and Stanford, Satur
day's protests were far more subdued.
Only a handful of individuals openly objected to
Gorbachev or his views, and a few others saw the
speech as an opportunity to grab publicity for unre
lated political goals.
In addition, a planned protest by the Serbian-Amer
ican Society over former I loover Institution Director W.
Glenn Campbell's alleged racist remarks was cancelled.
"We had planned to iprotestl, but the organization
felt that this was not the right time because of the pain
of everything going on in Los Angeles," said Father
liade Stokich, president of the Serbian-American Soci
ety. "There is still a very bad feeling about demonstra
tions because of what happened in Los Angeles."
During Gorbachev's last visit to Stanford in 1990,
hundreds of protesters lined Palm Drive, demanding
the independence of the Baltic states.
In addition, hundreds of other people — from the
Eritrean People's Liberation Front to the Coalition
of Nationalist Vietnamese Organizations of North
ern California— gathered at the Oval in 1990, wait
ing for Gorbachev to pass by.
This time, however, the most vocal protesters were
two people who shouted pro-communist slogans during
Gorbachev's speech and carried a red banner as they
marched through the crowd in Frost Amphitheater.

Members of the audience booed and shouted at
the protesters, who were soon escorted out by two
security officers.
The protesters, who said they were affiliated with
a bookstore in Berkeley, were wearing T-shirts that
pictured Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong and
read, "MAO mas que nunca" — "Mao more than
ever." Their banner read, "Phony communism is
dead. Long live real communism."
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Neimeyer said the
protesters were held "briefly in custody," questioned
and then released.
A member of the special events patrol who helped
escort the protesters to the exit said banners were
not allowed in the amphitheater and the protesters
had probably concealed theirs in a backpack. He said
security officers did not consider the protesters dan
gerous because they had no weapons.
After the speech, audience members who left
through the main gate were confronted by the same
two protesters, who were holding up their banner
and yelling slogans such as "Our ideology is Marx
ism, Leninism, Maoism — an ideology that is liber
ating people from Los Angeles to Peru."
Exiting audience members reacted negatively to
the protesters. Shirley Boozer, a staff member at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, was one of
many who confronted them. "You stand for oppres
sion because you don't let others speak," she told
them.
