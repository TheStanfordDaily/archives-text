# GORBACHEV AT STANFORD
## 'The man is not the same man': Gorbachev's symbolism fading 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
The thrill isn't gone yet, but for many
of those attending Mikhail Gorbachev's
speech Saturday it diminished signifi
cantly since his first visit two years ago.
Next to the lines leading into Frost
Amphitheater, people giving away their
tickets cited "indifference" to seeing the
former Soviet president speak.
The attendance at Saturday's speech,
9,500, was about 1,000 below the project
ed capacity in Frost.
History Prof. Barton Bernstein inter
preted the crowd's lukewarm reception

as a response to Gorbachev's loss of
power, which he suggested was formerly
the main attraction for his fans.
In 1990, Gorbachev "was an emblem
of desired change," Bernstein said. "Now
he's an emblem of change once desired."
Political science doctoral candidate
Steve Fish, who spent a year in the Soviet
Union studying the democratic changes
firsthand, said Gorbachev's diminishing
popularity can also be attributed partly to
people's realization that "he wasn't the
democrat that he said he was â€” that peo
ple thought or hoped he was."
"It's becoming clear," Fish said, "that
Yeltsin is much closer to our principles in

the West than Gorbachev ever was." He
said that in the Soviet Union, Gorbachev
was considered by some an "enemy of the
democratic movement."
Joe Corn, a senior lecturer in history
whose specialties include American cul
ture, said the hype surrounding Gor
bachev's 1990 visit to Stanford made it
appear "as if a savior was coming."
But now, he noted, times have
changed. "The man is not the same man.
He does not wear the same hat. His coun
try is not the same country," Corn said.
While Americans love celebrities, Corn
said many are "very fickle in [their] alle
giance to people in politics." He noted

that popularity tends to fluctuate more
for politicians than for those "outside the
realm of real political action."
Celebrities like Madonna, Joe Montana
or movie stars often enjoy more consistent
popularity than politicians, Corn said.
According to Bernstein, "Generally, on
the American world scene, unless one
remains in power, it's easy to be a passing
phenomenon."
But he noted that the "opportunity to
vicariously share in history" may have
drawn some people to Gorbachev's
appearances.
Bernstein said that while people still
want "to identify with him and wish him

well," Gorbachev's magnetism as a sym
bol of power is no longer a strong force.
And although Gorbachev's "voice is won
derful to listen to," the novelty may wear off
as the now-deposed world leader makes
more public appearances, Bernstein said.
American Studies lecturer Richard
Gillam attributed Gorbachev's former
popularity to "America's desperate
search for a symbol that the Cold War
was over."
Now, two years after Gorbachev was
thrust into the spotlight as a hero of
democracy, Gillam said the former Soviet
leader has "had his 15 minutes of fame.
That's essentially it."
