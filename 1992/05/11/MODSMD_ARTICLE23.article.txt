# Waiting in vain for extra tickets
## 
### Holly Hacker Senior staff writer 
Students who woke up early
Friday morning to get unclaimed
Gorbachev tickets found them
selves out of luck, as did several
others who won tickets in a lot
tery but claimed them too late.
Any unclaimed tickets were to
be given away at the Tresidder
Ticket Office at 10 a.m. Friday on
a first-come, first-served basis.
But all remaining tickets were
given to lottery winners the day
before, according to University
Events and Services Director Lois
Wagner.
Wagner said she turned away
about 30 people who were waiting
for tickets when the office opened
at 8 a.m. Friday. Despite signs say
ing that all tickets had been
claimed, another 60 people showed
up between 8:30 a.m. and 10 a.m.
The University had offered an
extra 1,500 tickets last week,
after the original 7,000 provided
for Gorbachev's Frost Amphithe
ater speech were snapped up
within four hours.
About 1,400 students, 100
staff and 50 faculty entered the
lottery last week, according to
Mary Bartlett of the Office of
Public Affairs. She said last week
that the planning committee
decided to issue another 50 tick
ets to accommodate all the partic
ipants, rather than turn away a
small number of people.
Winners were instructed to
pick up their tickets by 5 p.m.
Thursday. Wagner said a total of
1,507 tickets were claimed. Since
the other 43 tickets were designat
ed for lottery winners only, they
were not made available on Friday
— either to those who sought
extra tickets or to the winners who
tried to pick them up late.
Those turned away expressed
frustration and anger. "I really
wanted to see him," said graduate
student Christy Bergman, who
waited an hour and half before
leaving empty-handed.
Bergman said she didn't hear
about the first ticket giveaway
until all the tickets had been
given out and that she was "too
busy" to sign up for the lottery.
Freshman Matt Seidman
learned Friday morning that he
could no longer claim the ticket
he had won in the lottery. "I fig
ured they would hold it,"he said.
However, Wagner said an
announcement in The Daily this
week "clearly stated" the dates
and times when lottery winners
could pick up their tickets.
Seidman said he wasn't going
to watch Gorbachev's speech on
television because "it's nothing
like being there."
Instead, he said, "I'll go to
hear Jerry Brown."
