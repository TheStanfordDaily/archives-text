# Woman meets her benefactor
## Russian won Raisa Gorbachev fellowship to Stanford 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Tatiana Krylova was nervous as she stood
among the special guests at former Secretary of
State George Shultz's breakfast Saturday, wait
ing for Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev to arrive.
After spending a year at Stanford's Graduate
School of Business, preparing concrete plans for
reforming the Russian economy, Krylova was not
only about to meet her former president, but her
personal benefactor.
Krylova is the first recipient of a year-long fellow
ship at Stanford in honor of Raisa Gorbachev, and
Mrs. Gorbachev had a personal hand in her selection.
"This fellowship came through only because of
her personal attention," Krylova said. At their
meeting, she thanked Raisa Gorbachev for her
opportunity, and made plans to meet again once
they were both back in Russia.
"I also told Mr. Gorbachev the whole idea of
the fellowship could not have happened without
the reforms he started," Krylova said.
A Moscow State University economics profes
sor, Krylova was chosen for the prestigious award
last June and since has made extensive plans for
teaching Russian business executives, govern
ment officials and university students how to run
a market economy.
Krylova is "hoping to get an overview of Stan
ford's MBA program as a model" for a new Rus
sian version being planned at Moscow State Uni
versity, she said..
She is also gathering syllabi and textbooks and
attending many classes to help her improve the

method of teaching economics in Russia. The
study of market economy and finance have only
become popular with the reforms of the past few
years, she said.
Krylova said she is also collecting information
for a dictionary of economic terms and a textbook
on corporate finance — a subject, she added, that
has never before been taught in Russia.
When she goes back to Russia this summer,
she will work to reform the economics of the gov
ernment, she said.
One of the largest projects Krylova has undertak
en while at Stanford is creating a seminar to be
taught in Moscow with Assoc. Accounting Prof.
Mark Lang and Asst. Economics Prof. John Litwack.
The seminar, which will last three days, will focus
on different aspects of finance and the changes in the
financial accounting system in Russia, Lang said.
Lang said he thinks Krylova's fellowship has
been educational for both of them. "We've been
working together ever since she came. Technical
ly I guess I'm a mentor," he said.
Krylova said she is "really grateful for this fel
lowship — to be able to study here at this time
because it is very important for the marketization
of my country."
Krylova is the first of three people who will
receive the Raisa Gorbachev Partnership in
Learning fellowship at Stanford University.
Krylova's husband and two young daughters
came with her to Stanford.
"I hope maybe when classes end to have some
days free to get to Golden Gate Park and the zoo,"
she said. "I really would like my daughters to see
the zoo."
