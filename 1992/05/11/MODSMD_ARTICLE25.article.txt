# Ticket scalpers see very slow business
## Prices this time much lower than $1,800 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
For scalpers expecting to take
advantage of the community's
desire to see Mikhail Gorbachev,
Saturday morning's ticket bazaar
brought only disappointment.
The demand for tickets Saturday
was not nearly as high as it was two
years ago, apparently due to Gor
bachev's loss of power and abun
dant seating in Frost Amphitheater,
according to Robert Freelen, vice
president for public affairs.
In 1990, tickets for Gor
bachev's speech in Memorial
Auditorium were reported to have
sold for as much as $1,800 and
some students slept out for more
than two days to get tickets.
Although not all interested
students could get tickets for Sat
urday's speech (see related story
at left), scalpers were not very
successful and some tickets were
even given away.
"The first time there was all
this excitement," said Joyce
Kiefer, who studies the history of
science. "Today people were walk
ing up to me and asking politely,
'Is this the line?' It's almost like
an old friend coming to visit."
Sophomore Atman Shah had an
extra ticket which he said he tried
to sell for a higher sum before a
friend bought it from him for $10.
Shah said he had offers rang
ing from $20 to $40, but eventu
ally decided "the friendship was
worth more than $20."
Junior Anne Copeland sold her
two tickets for $10 and $20. She
said that with the profit she
"won't have to eat University
food service" for a while.
"I just wasn't that interested
in watching him speak in Russian

and getting the English transla
tion. He's just a man," she said.
Yet San Francisco resident
Louis Williams tried for hours to
sell a ticket he had bought for
$40. No one purchased the ticket
from Williams and he ended up
watching the speech.
However, some tried to gain
access to the speech without a
ticket. Several tickets were coun
terfeited for Gorbachev's first
visit, and at least one fake ticket
was confiscated at the entrance to
Frost on Saturday, according to
student ticket takers.
Several students attempted to
sleep out Friday night in order to
obtain the best of the first-come,
first-served seating in Frost, but
Stanford security officers pre
vented them.
A group from Arroyo was sent
away by security guards. They were
told to come back in the morning.
"We came back around 5 a.m.
and they wouldn't let us stand in
line," said freshman Susan Kana
gawa. "The guy didn't let us in
because it was dark. He said, 'You
have to wait until it's daylight,' so
we came back later."
Junior Jenni McClellan and
sophomore Erin Gourley were
first in line. McClellan said they
came at about 5:20 a.m., after
having been sent back to their
dorm the night before.
By 9:45 a.m., an hour and a
half before the speech began, the
rapidly growing line stretched
from Gate 4 of Frost to the Art
Museum.
"I didn't think the line would
be this long this early," freshman
Bill Ferias said.
