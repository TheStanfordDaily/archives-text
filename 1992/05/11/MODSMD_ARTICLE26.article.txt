# T-shirts sell quickly, but not like last time

A number of entrepreneurs
capitalized on Mikhail Gor
bachev's speech Saturday, but
this year's scene didn't compare
to the flea market atmosphere
that surrounded his 1990 visit.
Vendors from Students for East
European Democracy were the
first to set up shop Saturday morn
ing, arriving at Frost at 9 a.m.
"I'm the only person here," said
sophomore Karen Wayland, who
was selling T-shirts for the group.
She said she was "amazed"
that no one else was there, but
added that she was pleased
because she sold 30 of her 40
shirts within half an hour.
SEED had ordered 350 Gor
bachev shirts and came close to
running out of stock by the end of
the day, according to sophomore
Peter Blum, fund-raising director
for the group.

SEED's main competition for
the T-shirt market was the Stan
ford Bookstore, which set up a
display table at 9:45 a.m.
Despite a late start, the Book
store sold almost 400 shirts and
ran out of its most popular style on
Saturday, according to Bookstore
clothing buyer Laura Dowling.
"We got mobbed," she said,
adding that T-shirt sales were
slower earlier in the week.
Although both groups were
happy with their profits, this
year's sales didn't match the
5,900 official commemorative T
shirts sold by the University dur
ing Gorbachev's 1990 visit.
Also competing for spectators'
dollars this year were two vendors
selling imported "babushkas,"
dolls of famous Soviet leaders.
Tony Shlifstein, a former citi
zen of the Soviet Union and cur
rent West Valley Community Col-
lege student, reported selling eight sets
of five dolls at $50 per set.
True capitalists, individual SEED
members bought the commemorative

shirts for $6 from SEED, and then sold
them for $10 Saturday. The profits
made by members will help fund their
summer trips to Eastern Europe,
according to Wayland, who will be
going to Prague.
SEED, which sells T-shirts every
year, decided to print the Gorbachev
shirts after its fee request failed in last

month's ASSU election, according to
Wayland. The T-shirts pictured Gor
bachev's face between images of this
year's ticket design, one printed in
English and the other in Russian.
Russian letters bordered the design,
and spelled out "Gorby comes again
and again," "I like Mikhail" and"I love
Lake Lagunita," Wayland said.
