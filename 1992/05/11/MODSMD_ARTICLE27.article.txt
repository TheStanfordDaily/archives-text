# Former residents of Soviet Union scrutinize Gorbachev speech
## 
### John Ford Staff writer 
For those who have lived in the former
Soviet Union or other communist states,
Mikhail Gorbachev's visit Saturday
evoked a range of emotions similar only
in their intensity.
Gorbachev's legacy seems to have left,
many former Soviet citizens angry and
critical of his policies. But others admire
or sympathize with the former leader.
"Gorbachev is a mental communist.
That is bad," said Sam Kadaner, who left
Leningrad 12 years ago to come to the
United States.
His friend Vladimir Rosenthal, who wait
ed nine more years before joining Kadaner
in the United States, laughed at the remark.
"No, no he is not," Rosenthal said.
Rosenthal, who is currently unem
ployed, believes Gorbachev has done well
for Russia. Asked how most Russians
view Gorbachev, Rosenthal said, "It is

necessary to give the Russian people time
to answer that question. His image will
improve over the years."
Kadaner, whose daughter works at
Stanford and gave him two tickets to the
speech, was more critical of the former
Soviet president.
He brought with him three questions,
written in Russian, which he hoped to
give to Gorbachev. The questions focused
on how Gorbachev felt Russia could avoid
complete economic disaster and why the
former president failed to prevent the
breakup of the Soviet Union.
But Kadaner never got a chance to
give his questions to Gorbachev â€” and
speech left others with
unanswered questions as well.
Jchamme Gheith, a graduate student
and the resident fellow at Slavianskii
Dom, said she was disappointed that Gor
bachev did not evaluate the differences
between Russian and U.S. perspectives
on the rule of law. Russians "don't trust

any laws," Gheith said.
Gheith, who has spent more than two
years living in the Soviet Union, said the
topic was potentially interesting but Gor
bachev "did not touch on the most inter
esting issues."
Tony Shlifstein, a Jewish refugee from
the former Soviet Union, agreed that
Gorbachev did not address the most crit
ical topics.
Shlifstein, who was vending Russian
dolls outside Frost Amphitheater and
could hear some of the speech, said, "I've
heard him many times, and he says the
same thing over and over."
Gorbachev's address "seemed like quite
a defensive speech" and sounded like it was
"targeted to the Russian audience," Gheith
said, adding that most Russians would
have been "pretty cynical" about much of
what Gorbachev said in the speech.
. Gheith also questioned Gorbachev's
treatment of his proposed Novo-Ograevo
treaty, an agreement that would have

given the republics a greater degree of free
dom within the Soviet Union. Gorbachev's
indication that the treaty had popular sup
port was "not true," Gheith said.
Graduate student Jonathon Nigh
swander, the translation editor of Mon
tage, Stanford's Russian/American jour
nal, agreed with many of Gheith's criti
cisms, saying "Gorbachev was dreaming
when he was talking about keeping the
Soviet Union together."
Nighswander, who said he formed "a
pretty negative view" of Gorbachev after
he spent time living in the Soviet Union,
criticized the former leader for "not deal
ing with economic issues" in his speech.
But Owen Liang, a staff member at
the Stanford Medical Center and a for
mer citizen of the People's Republic of
China, defended Gorbachev.
"People realize that the old system
was not a good one," Liang said. "As time
passes, people will like Gorbachev more
and more. In China, fpeoplel like Gor

bachev."
One Slavianskii Dom resident, a native
of the Soviet Union, went much farther
than others in his criticism of Gorbachev.
The resident, who asked not to be identi
fied, said Gorbachev's speech was "anoth
er way for him to make money."
Gorbachev "destroyed a country," he
said. "He created a situation that was
much worse than the one he began with."
And Louis O'Neill, a Stanford graduate
student who spent a year in Russia, said
criticism of Gorbachev is widespread there.
"Most people in Russia hate [Gorbachevl
because he is responsible for the intensifi
cation of their misery," O'Neill said.
Sympathy for Gorbachev is another
common sentiment within the Russian
community at Stanford. "I felt a little bit
sorry for him," said Andrey Ustinov, a
Russian graduate student in the Slavic
department. "He is very powerful and
popular in the United States and unpop
ular in the Soviet Union."
