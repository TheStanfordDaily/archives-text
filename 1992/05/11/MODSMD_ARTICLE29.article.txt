## 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Two black youths shouted "Kill all
the white people" and threw rocks
through a Roble Hall window early Fri
day morning, startling "Kiss Me Kate"
cast members practicing in the dorm's
dining hall, witnesses said.
The 1 a.m. incident began when some
of the musical's approximately 30 par
ticipants heard the shouts outside the
window, according to senior Eric Lee.
When curious cast members turned
around, one of the youths yelled,
"What the fuck are you looking at?"
Lee said. After a few seconds, he added,
a rock came through the window.
"About half the people were really
worried and got down," he said. "The
other half was surprised and not really
sure what was going on."
Lee said a second rock hit the win

dow but did not break it. The youths,
who Lee described as "college-aged or
younger" black males, ran away as two
resident assistants went out "to see
what was going on."
By the time they got outside, howev
er, the youths had turned the corner
between Roble and Lagunita Court,
Lee said. Another man was walking
behind Roble at the time, but Lee said
he was not involved in the incident.
Although one of the rocks landed in
the room, freshman David Cohen said
it did not hit anyone. However, one per
son "got a tiny cut from a shard of
glass," he said.
Roble Resident Fellow Rob Robin
son said several cast members hit the
ground when the rocks were thrown.
"When a hole appears in the window
and you're not sure where it came
from, you drop," he said.
Robinson said he called the police,

who responded quickly.
Two officers examined the window,
but a Stanford Police spokesperson
said that no information is available
about the crime
Robinson said members of the cast
"were really upset right at the time it
happened."
But he emphasized that residents
"don't know who did it. It was a dis
turbing but pretty isolated occurrence
on the Stanford campus."
Robinson said he "can't help but feel
[the incident] was because of the Rod
ney King verdict."
However, he added: "Things have
been really civilized and well thought
out and I think they will continue to be
civilized and well thought out."
Junior Jason Dell played down the
incident. "This is not the biggest deal
in the world," h? said. "It was two
rocks thrown through a window."
