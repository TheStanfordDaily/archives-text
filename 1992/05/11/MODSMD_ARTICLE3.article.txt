Four and a half months after
the Soviet Union ceased to exist,
Mikhail Gorbachev has become
more forthcoming about his role in
the democratization and breakup
of his country â€” but more stub

history, according to scholars who
attended his Saturday speech.
In his introduction, Gorbachev

about "a law-based state," Dunlop
added, "were pretty obvious."

seemed to defend more directly
the political judgements he had
made as president, as he worked

abstraction about it," she said.
Holloway said he found "inter
esting" Gorbachev's two central
explanations for his willingness to

bachev argued that "he had to
work with the party to bring
about any change," Holloway
said, "and that indecisiveness and
