# Gorbachev used speech mostly to justify decisions, scholars say
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
Four and a half months after
the Soviet Union ceased to exist,
Mikhail Gorbachev has become
more forthcoming about his role in
the democratization and breakup
of his country — but more stub
born about defending his place in
history, according to scholars who
attended his Saturday speech.
In his introduction, Gorbachev
said the speech would examine
"the rule of law in the context. . .
of the political changes which
have occurred in the world."
Instead, he used much of the
speech to justify his various politi
cal decisions. His explanations,
though sometimes clarifying, were
often oversimplified, scholars said.
Political Science Prof. Alexan
der Dallin said there was not
much new in the speech. Gor
bachev "was basically repeating
what he had said in other speech
es and interviews," he said.
Hoover Senior Fellow John
Dunlop agreed, saying, "It was
very pleasant but it was largely cer
emonial." Some of his statements
about "a law-based state," Dunlop
added, "were pretty obvious."
Though Political Science Prof.
Condoleezza Rice agreed that the
speech was "pretty straightfor
ward," she said Gorbachev
seemed to defend more directly
the political judgements he had
made as president, as he worked
to change what he referred to as
the "monstrous" Soviet system.

"He's beginning to explain more
and more the processes that were
going on in his own mind as he
undertook these difficulties, rather
than just talking in some broad
abstraction about it," she said.
Holloway said he found "inter
esting" Gorbachev's two central
explanations for his willingness to
shift in the Soviet political winds,
constantly moving between a con
servative and reform stance. Gor
bachev argued that "he had to
work with the party to bring
about any change," Holloway
said, "and that indecisiveness and
putting things off was a way of
buying time and allowing what he
called democratic potential to
grow stronger."
According to Gorbachev, "I
swore to myself [that] for the first
time in my country's history, car
dinal transformations would take
place in a more or less peaceable
form without bloodshed." He said
that many people demanded that
he use his power to either force or
block reform.
"But I simply could not betray
myself," Gorbachev said.
Defense of decisions
According to Dallin, Gorbachev
skillfully used "the art of self-jus
tification" in his speech as he
weaved his own version of history
with the topic of the rule of law.
But Gorbachev's "self-defense
was not fully effective," Dallin
said.
Other scholars said many of his
defenses were successful, and added
that they shed new light on Gor
bachev's decision-making processes
during his tenure as president.
Gail Lapidus, a professor of
Soviet politics at UC-Berkeley,
called the speech "the most
detailed, coherent explanation
and defense of Gorbachev's pro
gram and perestroika, against
charges that he had betrayed the
process he had helped to launch."
Rice pointed to Gorbachev's
view that "had he been more deci
sive he would have blown the pro
cess apart."
She said Gorbachev made a
"spirited defense" of his shifts
from left to right by "saying it
was not indecisiveness, it was
understanding 'politics as the art
of the possible.' "
Such statements are "really
slings and arrows against those
who said he betrayed the process
by being too slow," she said.
Each of the points Gorbachev
made on that topic, Rice added,
were "new elements" in the dis
cussion of his tenure as president.
Oversimplified history
Others were more critical of
Gorbachev's justifications, saying
that his interpretation of Russian
history was oversimplified and
somewhat slanted.
The move to bury the Soviet
Union and create the Common
wealth of Independent States was
done "behind the back of the pres
ident of the country," Gorbachev
bitterly told the crowd in Frost.

But Dunlop said Gorbachev
was merely resentful at "being
relieved of his role" as head of the
Soviet Union.
"He feels he was done badly.
Naturally he doesn't like it,"
Dunlop said.
But "no historical actor is an
appropriate commentator on his
historical role," Dunlop added,
because it would be impossible to
be objective.
Gorbachev also asserted that
the Soviet Union would have
stayed unified if others had not
undercut him. Dallin called this
"a dubious proposition."
Gorbachev portrayed himself
as a consistent ally of democratic
forces, but some scholars said the
issue was more complex than
that, and that Gorbachev often
did not know where he was going.
Dunlop said that rather than
directing events, Gorbachev lost
control. "He was like a surfboard
er — the waves moved him,"
Dunlop said.
According to Lapidus, Gor
bachev's commitment to democ
racy and reform was not as con
sistent as he made it seem.
"His greatest mistake was the
fact that instead of continuing in
the fall of 1990 to throw his sup
port behind Yeltsin and other
democratic forces, he .. . threw
his support and put into his gov
ernment conservative, indeed
reactionary, figures," she said.
Dallin said he found it curious
that Gorbachev was "still suffi
ciently concerned with (his image]
that he finds it necessary even
here in California to talk about it."
'Humorous' book plugs
Twice during his speech, Gor
bachev plugged the book he is cur
rently writing by purposely not
expanding on topics, promising that
the details would be in the book.
"I hope that when this book
appears, you'll be more willing to
expend a certain sum of money to
acquire it,"he said.
Dallin said he thought the two
plugs for the memoirs were accept
able because the purpose of Gor
bachev's tour is raising funds for
his non-profit Gorbachev Founda
tion/USA. He said the plugs were
more "humorous" than offensive,
and added, "He's learning fast."
Rice said she found the plugs a
"charming" part of the speech. "If
we have learned anything about
Gorbachev over the last seven
years, it's that he's uncharacter
istic of people from the Soviet
Union," she said.

Four and a half months after
the Soviet Union ceased to exist,
Mikhail Gorbachev has become
more forthcoming about his role in
the democratization and breakup
of his country — but more stub
born about defending his place in
history, according to scholars who
attended his Saturday speech.
In his introduction, Gorbachev
said the speech would examine
"the rule of law in the context. . .
of the political changes which
have occurred in the world."
Instead, he used much of the
speech to justify his various politi
cal decisions. His explanations,
though sometimes clarifying, were
often oversimplified, scholars said.
Political Science Prof. Alexan
der Dallin said there was not
much new in the speech. Gor
bachev "was basically repeating
what he had said in other speech
es and interviews," he said.
Hoover Senior Fellow John
Dunlop agreed, saying, "It was
very pleasant but it was largely cer
emonial." Some of his statements
about "a law-based state," Dunlop
added, "were pretty obvious."
Though Political Science Prof.
Condoleezza Rice agreed that the
speech was "pretty straightfor
ward," she said Gorbachev
seemed to defend more directly
the political judgements he had
made as president, as he worked
to change what he referred to as
the "monstrous" Soviet system.

"He's beginning to explain more
and more the processes that were
going on in his own mind as he
undertook these difficulties, rather
than just talking in some broad
abstraction about it," she said.
Holloway said he found "inter
esting" Gorbachev's two central
explanations for his willingness to
shift in the Soviet political winds,
constantly moving between a con
servative and reform stance. Gor
bachev argued that "he had to
work with the party to bring
about any change," Holloway
said, "and that indecisiveness and
putting things off was a way of
buying time and allowing what he
called democratic potential to
grow stronger."
According to Gorbachev, "I
swore to myself [that] for the first
time in my country's history, car
dinal transformations would take
place in a more or less peaceable
form without bloodshed." He said
that many people demanded that
he use his power to either force or
block reform.
"But I simply could not betray
myself," Gorbachev said.
Defense of decisions
According to Dallin, Gorbachev
skillfully used "the art of self-jus
tification" in his speech as he
weaved his own version of history
with the topic of the rule of law.
But Gorbachev's "self-defense
was not fully effective," Dallin
said.
Other scholars said many of his
defenses were successful, and added
that they shed new light on Gor
bachev's decision-making processes
during his tenure as president.
Gail Lapidus, a professor of
Soviet politics at UC-Berkeley,
called the speech "the most
detailed, coherent explanation
and defense of Gorbachev's pro
gram and perestroika, against
charges that he had betrayed the
process he had helped to launch."
Rice pointed to Gorbachev's
view that "had he been more deci
sive he would have blown the pro
cess apart."
She said Gorbachev made a
"spirited defense" of his shifts
from left to right by "saying it
was not indecisiveness, it was
understanding 'politics as the art
of the possible.' "
Such statements are "really
slings and arrows against those
who said he betrayed the process
by being too slow," she said.
Each of the points Gorbachev
made on that topic, Rice added,
were "new elements" in the dis
cussion of his tenure as president.
Oversimplified history
Others were more critical of
Gorbachev's justifications, saying
that his interpretation of Russian
history was oversimplified and
somewhat slanted.
The move to bury the Soviet
Union and create the Common
wealth of Independent States was
done "behind the back of the pres
ident of the country," Gorbachev
bitterly told the crowd in Frost.

But Dunlop said Gorbachev
was merely resentful at "being
relieved of his role" as head of the
Soviet Union.
"He feels he was done badly.
Naturally he doesn't like it,"
Dunlop said.
But "no historical actor is an
appropriate commentator on his
historical role," Dunlop added,
because it would be impossible to
be objective.
Gorbachev also asserted that
the Soviet Union would have
stayed unified if others had not
undercut him. Dallin called this
"a dubious proposition."
Gorbachev portrayed himself
as a consistent ally of democratic
forces, but some scholars said the
issue was more complex than
that, and that Gorbachev often
did not know where he was going.
Dunlop said that rather than
directing events, Gorbachev lost
control. "He was like a surfboard
er — the waves moved him,"
Dunlop said.
According to Lapidus, Gor
bachev's commitment to democ
racy and reform was not as con
sistent as he made it seem.
"His greatest mistake was the
fact that instead of continuing in
the fall of 1990 to throw his sup
port behind Yeltsin and other
democratic forces, he .. . threw
his support and put into his gov
ernment conservative, indeed
reactionary, figures," she said.
Dallin said he found it curious
that Gorbachev was "still suffi
ciently concerned with (his image]
that he finds it necessary even
here in California to talk about it."
'Humorous' book plugs
Twice during his speech, Gor
bachev plugged the book he is cur
rently writing by purposely not
expanding on topics, promising that
the details would be in the book.
"I hope that when this book
appears, you'll be more willing to
expend a certain sum of money to
acquire it,"he said.
Dallin said he thought the two
plugs for the memoirs were accept
able because the purpose of Gor
bachev's tour is raising funds for
his non-profit Gorbachev Founda
tion/USA. He said the plugs were
more "humorous" than offensive,
and added, "He's learning fast."
Rice said she found the plugs a
"charming" part of the speech. "If
we have learned anything about
Gorbachev over the last seven
years, it's that he's uncharacter
istic of people from the Soviet
Union," she said.
