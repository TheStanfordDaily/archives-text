## Batters hammer Bears, sweep weekend series Card almost certain to receive postseason berth 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Coming through in the clutch. The proven stars
and the unsung heroes doing what they had to do.
Outstanding performances in must-win situations.
Offense. Defense. Pitching. Intensity. Revenge. This
past weekend's encounters between the Stanford
baseball team and the California Golden Bears had
more intertwining themes than a Charles Dickens
novel.
The Cardinal went into the three-game conference
series needing to take two of three in order to be
assured of a post-season bid. But instead of taking just
two games, Stanford swept all three to counteract
California's sweep of the Cardinal earlier in the sea
son in an act of vengeance that even Ebenezer Scrooge
would be proud of.
Stanford showed lots of intensity in all facets of
play and came from behind several times. The level of
concentration and execution shows the Cardinal to be
peaking at perhaps the best possible time. But of
course the primary importance of the sweep is Stan
ford's secure place in the NCAA's.
"We're gonna be in the regionals, there's no
doubt," said Stanford head coach Mark Marquess.
"We got a real good shot at being co-champs [of the
Pacific 10 Southern Division] and could maybe win it
outright."
In order for the latter to happen, Arizona State
would have to drop two of three to USC in their series,
and then take two from Arizona next weekend. A Car
dinal co-championship with the Wildcats is more like
ly as the Sun Devils would only need to win one in
Tucson to achieve that scenario.
At any rate, Stanford has clinched at least second
in the Six-Pac, and even has an outside shot at host
ing a regional. Stanford's performance in the wins
exhibited the same level of intensity that was seen in

the UCLA games. Consider that Stanford scored 38
runs in the series and had more hits than Oliver Twist
has pocket-watches.
"The hitting has been looking real good lately,"
said Marquess. "It's the pitching that has to get con
sistent."
But the pitching was no problem for the Cardinal
Friday. Stanford's ace Willie Adams started the game
and ended up going the distance for his fifth complete
game and seventh win. Although Adams did allow 13
hits, they came at isolated times, and he was able to
pitch out of jams.
"I think the difference was when [Adams] needed a
big pitch or a big out, he got it," said Marquess.
But the Golden Bears' pitching had a little more
trouble, allowing nine runs on 13 hits, including home
runs to Todd Laßocca, Dusty Allen and Tony Detter.
In the game, Detter went three-for-three with three
runs scored and two doubles to go along with the two
run shot in the top of the fourth. He showed great
offensive power when the Cardinal needed it most.
"[Detter's performance! was real huge," said Mar
quess. "He's a senior, works real hard in practice, he's
paid his dues and it's great for him and for the team
that he's coming through for us down the stretch."
Saturday's starter, Rick Helling has been a little
less consistent in the second half of the season. In just
three-and-two-thirds innings, Helling gave up nine
runs (seven earned). However, Stanford simply
brought in Brian Sackinsky who pitched the remain
der of the game, allowing only one more run while
scattering seven hits. In his performance, Sackinsky
made an excellent statement for his ongoing argu
ment to return to the rotation after being a reliever
and mid-week starter for the past several weeks.
"It has been tough. There have been times I've got
ten a little frustrated," said Sackinsky. "I just felt I
had to wait to get my chance to pitch, and I got it
today."

And again, Stanford jumped all over the California
hurlers faster than you can say David Copperfield,
scoring a season-high 22 runs on 17 hits. Although
Steve Solomon's 15-game hitting streak was broken
the day before, the left-hander came back with some
thing to prove. Solly ended up hitting for the cycle,
going four-for-six, scoring four runs and driving in
five. Mark Skeels also had a superb day, hitting a pair
of homeruns for a total of six RBI. And third-baseman
Detter has another outstanding day, getting four hits
and three RBI.

"I'm seeing the ball well,
and I'm getting some good
pitches to hit," said Detter.
"When you get in a game
like this you know it's gonna
be close, so you gotta keep
scoring runs and you can't
let them back in it."
Sunday, Jamie Sepeda
did his normal dancing
through the raindrops,
showing his uncanny ability
to get himself into dire situ
ations and then pitch him
self out of them. Relief bv

Andrew Lorriane was a bit shaky as he walked more
than his share of batters, including two straight in the
eighth to load the bases with no outs for slugger Troy
Penix. However, Steve Worrell came in and struck out
both Penix and Matt Luke along the way to getting
his first save.
"He pitched great. Steve Worrell has had arm prob
lems his whole career," said Marquess. "But he
pitched great for us Monday and came in for us and
got the save today. He did an outstanding job."
On the offensive side, Stanford was a little fiat at
first, unable to figure out lefty John Zuber. But trail
ing 3-0 in the top of the fifth, the problem was solved.
After back-to-back-to-back singles by Lynch, Better
and Laßocca loaded the bases, Solomon drew a one
out RBI walk, leaving the bases loaded for Dusty Allen
with the Cardinal still trailing by two. But the big
freshman responded by nailing the first pitch he saw

'We're gonna be in the region
als, there's no doubt. We got a
real good shot at being co
champs [of the Pacific 10
Southern Division] and could
maybe win it outright.'

Card Notes

far over the left-center field fence into Never-Never
land. The grand slam gave the Cardinal a 5-3 lead that
would never be relinquished thanks to some insur
ance created by a huge Lynch homer and a manufac
tured run by Laßocca.
On the whole, Laßocca looked very good in his first
starts against big competition. Although he did make
some mistakes in the field, he had big hits in all three
games, filling a hole at the nine spot in the lineup.
And it's performances like Laßocca's which make
Stanford look very imposing for the post-season. Det-

ter's big hits. Outstanding
defense by Allen. Heady
baserunning by Cornell.
Gutsy pitching by Worrell.
Dickens would be proud.
"It's kind of a weird atmo
sphere. Everybody's sens
ing it's coming together,"
said Skeels.
They may have been
through the worst of times,
but the best of times look
like they may be just
around the corner.

Jeffrey Hammonds didn't start Sunday's game to guard
against any impending injuries, but was a late defensive
replacement .... Stanford had eight home runs in the three
games, making 13 in the last six conference games .... Cor
nell laid down one of the prettiest bunts of all time on Sat
urday, not even evoking a throw .... The infield may be set
now with Detter, Laßocca, and Kemper as Marquess wants
to squeeze as much offense as possible into the lineup....
Nate Olmstead looked good in designated hitter duties both
Saturday and Sunday, offering Marquess a switch hitter in
the middle of the order. . . Despite a few more walks, Skeels'
slugging percentage finally overtook his on-base percentage
over the weekend, achieving proper numbers that clean-up
hitters such as California's Penix or BYU's Erik Larsen
would even be proud 0f... . Stanford transfer Brad Brown
was the starter for California on Saturday and gave up six
earned runs in two and two-thirds of an inning.
