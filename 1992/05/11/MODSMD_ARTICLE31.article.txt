# California overpowers crew at Big Row
## 'At times, we felt like we were spinning our wheels out there' 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
The Stanford men's and women's crew
teams came up short to California in the Big
Row at Redwood Shores this weekend, losing
to the Golden Bears in all but one boat divi
sion.
The Cardinal struggled all day with a
vicious crosswind, giving both of Stanford's
varsity boats steering problems in their races.
The women's varsity-eight were able to steer
clear of two lane-marking buoys before drift
ing into the third one, causing a two to three
seconds delay. The Cardinal women finished
five seconds behind California's varsity
women.
"The wind was definitely a factor for us,"
said women's crew head coach Wendy Davis,
"But we can't blame it all on the wind. They
just came out and beat us."

California defeats the Cardinal
in all but one race

"This was not our best race," said women's
crew team captain Bonnie Baker. "We gave it
the best effort we could, but we just couldn't
hold it after the first 1000."
Even Stanford's women's varsity-four,
which led by about two seconds at the midway
point, was not able to hold on to the lead at the
end, losing to the Golden Bears by four seats.
On the men's side, the varsity-eight, fight
ing both the wind and steering problems of
their own, lost by more than a boat length to a
strong California squad.
"The crosswind was a factor â€” we weren't
as smooth as we could have been," said men's

crew member Steve Voorhis. "At times, we felt
like we were spinning our wheels out there."
Voorhis, however, is careful to point out the
positive points Stanford carried away from
Saturday's race.
"Two good things come out of it [the
race]," he said. "One, a loss like that gets you
more fired up for beating Cal at Pac-lOs, and
two, other teams won't be expecting us to do
as well, so we kind of become the dark
horse."
Baker agrees that the loss will motivate the
Cardinal in two weeks.
"We're really ticked off about losing [to Cal
ifornia!, so we especially want to come back
against them at Pac-lOs," she said.
Both teams will now train for the Pacific-10
Championships coming up on May 23. The top
finishers there will go to Cincinnati, Ohio to
compete in the 1992 US Rowing Champi
onships.
