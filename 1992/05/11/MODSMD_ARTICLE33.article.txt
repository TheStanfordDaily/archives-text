### Christopher Meyercord 
At the West Coast Collegiate Cycling
Championships in Davis, Calif., May 2-3,
the Stanford team emerged with an
impressive third-place finish behind Cal-
Poly San Luis Obispo and California. The
team was jubilant with the result after
having entered the weekend in fifth place
in the conference. Thanks to the hard
work and smart riding of Frank Scioscia
and freshman Tracy Timms, the team was
able to surpass UC-Santa Barbara and
UC-Davis to move to third.
The Championships weekend began
with the 16.5 mile, 36-turn Team Time
Trial, which has been Stanford's best
event this year. The women continued to
be dominant, taking second place and
beating the next team by an astounding
one-minute margin. In the men's A divi
sion, the Cardinal team rode to a some-

what disappointing fourth-place finish,
while the two Stanford B teams finished in
a respectable second and ninth places. The
Cardinal remained in fourth place.
The second of three events, the criteri
um, started next as temperatures shot into
the 90's. The race was a one-kilometer loop
with four wide turns and a hairpin, where
competitors rode between 35 and 60 laps
depending on the division. After disap
pointing showings in the lower divisions,
things began to look up for Stanford dur
ing the men's B race.
Dayne Wilcox scored in two primes,

which are mid-race sprints where (yclists
earn points for their team, and he, Baird
Webel and Larry Tsai all finished strongly
as well.
The strength of the Cardinal women
really began to make a difference in the A
event. Halfway through the race, Timms
got into a two-woman breakaway which
led the rest of the way. Aided by the block
ing of her teammates, Timms finished sec
ond while fellow rider Becky Wigglesworth
broke away from her group to finish third
overall.
In the final men's race of the day, Stan
ford narrowly missed scoring points on
several of the intermediate sprint laps,
and it looked as though this might be
another disappointing race. However,
after the last prime, Scioscia launched a
vicious counter-attack, which only one
UCLA rider was able to respond to imme
diately. With teammate Coulter Richard-

son's blocking, Scioscia stayed close to the
Bruin rider until 200 meters from the fin
ish when he summoned one last burst of
speed to move ahead and win. Scioscia
won the Conference Criterium Champi
onship for the second year in a row, while
Richardson came in fourth.
The Cardinal was still in fourth as the
team* took to the foothills for the road race
Sunday. The temperatures were high as
the top two men's divisions and the
women's A began, and all events soon
became races of attrition. In the men's B

division Tim Bradford crossed the line with
a very impressive fourth-place finish and
graduate student Andy Tucker also earned
points for the team by coming in 10th.
In the women's A race, Timms out
sprinted an opponent finish third, thus
earning her the Omnium (overall individ
ual point leader) jersey for the weekend.
Wigglesworth once again finished strong
ly, coming in fifth in her last collegiate
race.
The men's A field had a 56-mile, blaz
ingly fast race, but Scioscia, Richardson
and Bob Myers all earned points for their
team again, enabling the Stanford team to
surpass the host Aggies.
The Cardinal's third-place finish quali
fies them for the National Championships
May 16-17 in Atlanta, Ga. The recent
dominance of Stanford's two A teams
bodes well for Nationals, where the Cardi
nal finished fourth last year.
