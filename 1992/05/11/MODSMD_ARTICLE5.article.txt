# Brown calls for defense cuts to pay for new energy strategy
## 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Presidential candidate Jerry Brown tai
lored his message for environmentalists in
White Plaza Saturday afternoon, calling for
change in the "corrupt status quo" along
with cuts in the defense budget to fund a
national energy efficiency plan.
In an often forceful 15-minute speech to
about 300 people, Brown, a former Califor

nia governor, outlined his views on social
justice and boasted about the success of his
own alternative energy policies in the '70s.
"There's a little energy here," Brown
said, responding to loud cheers of greeting
from the crowd that had jwaited for him in
the hot afternoon sun. "I sure hope the
ozone layer holds for this afternoon,
because I see a lot of melanoma cases here."
Brown's address highlighted the "Ener
gy Futures Fair," which included solar

energy demonstrations and electric cars
among its displays.
Beginning his speech, Brown cited a
recent environmental report that called
California "a window to the future" of
alternative energy "because of policies
adopted by the government in the '70s"
when he was governor.
Brown said he halted the building of
nuclear power plants and supported a tax
credit of 55 percent for anyone buying and

installing solar energy.
The state went from having zero to
16,000 wind turbines while he was gover
nor, but Brown joked that he doesn't like to
talk about wind energy because "people
said, 'There goes Don Quixote with his
windmills.' "
It could save the country $50 billion "if
our next president would eliminate half of
energy use" through increased
efficiency, Brown said.
"Unfortunately, don't hold your
breath," he warned. Although con
servation "would save more money
than Bill Clinton's middle-class tax
cut ... it does step on toes," he
said. "People who sell energy don't
want to see sales reduced by half.
We're up against powerful forces."
He proposed a national "eco
nomic energy strategy," saying he
would cut defense spending to pay
for it."I do say cut the military in
half — put it back where it was
when Reagan took over."
In addressing federal militaiy
spending, Brown alluded to former
Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev's speech in Frost Amphithe
ater, which ended just before
Brown made his appearance.
"The Soviet Union is out of
business and Gorbachev is fund
raising here in Palo Alto," he said.
"So why is Congress appropriat
ing $281 billion for defense?"
The country that was seen as
such a threat "has turned out to
be a basket case," he said, adding
that Americans have "been taken
for a ride" with huge military
expenditures.
Brown also tied in energy policy
with other campaign themes. Politi
cians should "do the right thing and
not what [theyl have been bought

and paid to do," Brown said, linking
the preservation of the environ
ment to the riots in Los Angeles.
"In five years, if we don't put
the money into our cities most of
our military will be guarding the
people in America,"he said,
expressing the disbelief he felt
seeing the military move into Los
Angeles during the unrest after
the Rodney King verdict.
He also sharply criticized con
servatives who say the poor need
more personal responsibility, not
financial assistance. "They need
money, you need money, we all
need money as long as we live in a
capitalist society," he said.
There has "got to be some
vision," he said. "Where there is
no vision the people perish, and
under this administration we are
perishing."
Political elites have lost touch
with the people, and "politics has
become an empty 'Gong Show' of
television commercials," Brown
said. People must send a message
to government, a "critique of the
corrupt status quo."
Returning to his original
theme, Brown concluded his
speech by saying, "You don't
wreck the planet. You don't wreck
the future."
During the speech, audience
members carried signs displaying
Brown's infamous 800 number
and others reading "Clinton =
Bush," "Brown because the status
quo sucks" and the less enthusias
tic "Brown — who the hell else?"

Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev's speech in Frost Amphithe
ater, which ended just before
Brown made his appearance.
"The Soviet Union is out of
business and Gorbachev is fund
raising here in Palo Alto," he said.
"So why is Congress appropriat
ing $281 billion for defense?"
The country that was seen as
such a threat "has turned out to
be a basket case," he said, adding
that Americans have "been taken
for a ride" with huge military
expenditures.
Brown also tied in energy policy
with other campaign themes. Politi
cians should "do the right thing and
not what [theyl have been bought

and paid to do," Brown said, linking
the preservation of the environ
ment to the riots in Los Angeles.
"In five years, if we don't put
the money into our cities most of
our military will be guarding the
people in America,"he said,
expressing the disbelief he felt
seeing the military move into Los
Angeles during the unrest after
the Rodney King verdict.
He also sharply criticized con
servatives who say the poor need
more personal responsibility, not
financial assistance. "They need
money, you need money, we all
need money as long as we live in a
capitalist society," he said.
There has "got to be some
vision," he said. "Where there is
no vision the people perish, and
under this administration we are
perishing."
Political elites have lost touch
with the people, and "politics has
become an empty 'Gong Show' of
television commercials," Brown
said. People must send a message
to government, a "critique of the
corrupt status quo."
Returning to his original
theme, Brown concluded his
speech by saying, "You don't
wreck the planet. You don't wreck
the future."
During the speech, audience
members carried signs displaying
Brown's infamous 800 number
and others reading "Clinton =
Bush," "Brown because the status
quo sucks" and the less enthusias
tic "Brown — who the hell else?"
