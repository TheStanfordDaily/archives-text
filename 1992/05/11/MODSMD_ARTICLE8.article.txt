More than 20,000 people attended
Stanford's 21st annual Powwow this
weekend, and were entertained by
dances, exhibitions and competitions that
highlighted Native American culture.
This year's powwow was "larger than
last year's," said co-coordinator Debora
Norris, a junior.
"The name is getting better every year,"
Norris said, adding that organizers received
support from several different departments
and dormitories to stage the powwow.
The event, held on the soccer fields
near Stanford Stadium, featured Native
American dancers from many regions of
the United States and Canada. Exhibi
tions and competitions involving both
traditional and more modern dances
continued throughout the weekend.
The appeal of the dances among the
observers was evident. Tom Fredericks,

a Menlo Park resident who has attended
the powwow for the past four years, said
he is "very attracted to the wisdom of the
culture."
"I come to get lost in it, particularly
the music," he said. "I find the dancing a

very literal expression."
Most of the 82 booths located around
the central dance tent contained a
diverse assortment of arts, crafts and
foods. Other booths provided informa
tion on a variety of social issues.
Helen Waukazoo, the director of the
Friendship House Association, said these

booths showed the progress that has been
made in the Native American community.
"We have more services available to
American Indian people in the areas of
health, social services and education,"
Waukazoo said.
Among the groups represented were
the American Indian AIDS Institute, the
American Indian Child Resource Center
and the Friendship House.
The main theme of this year's powwow
was "Honoring the Strength and Persis
tence of Native Cultures." Another of the
celebration's themes was the "Seventh
Generation." This prophecy says that after
500 years of submission, Native Americans
will be able to rebuild their nation.
Julius Drum, an actor who appeared
in the film "Thunderheart," was among
those in attendance. Drum said he has
attended the last 12 Stanford Powwows.
"Even after 500 years of oppression, you
can feel the spirit of the people," he said.
