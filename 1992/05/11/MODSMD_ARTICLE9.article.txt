# Tensions reported over change in location of fund-raiser for Brown
## 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Some students in Terra House say
the decision to move presidential hope
ful Jerry Brown's fund-raiser from
their residence has created tension
between them, local campaign organiz
ers and the University.
University officials told organizers
Thursday night that Saturday's func
tion had to be moved out of the co-oper
ative because campus facilities cannot
be used to support partisan politics.
But some Terra residents say they
believe the local campaign supported
moving the event — due to "bad senti
ments" that developed between students
and some of the campaign organizers.
Stanford for Brown club member
Rafe Sagarin said he got a call Thursday
night from Heather Dunn, coordinator
of the Office of Student Activities.
She told him "in no uncertain terms
at all" that the fund-raiser could not be
held at Terra. Sagarin, a Terra resi
dent, said he wished the University had
contacted him earlier.
Being told Thursday night "was
something I was really angry about,"
since the visit was announced in Tues
day's Daily, Sagarin said.
But Nanci Howe, the assistant direc
tor of Tresidder Union, said Dunn's
phone call to Sagarin was made as soon
as the Office of Student Activities
became aware of the event.
Dunn could not be reached for com
ment this weekend.
It is each organization's responsibil
ity to check events with the office,
Howe said, and the policy on political
fund-raisers appears in the student
organization handbook.
According to Howe, fund-raisers for
political candidates are never allowed on
campus, though occasional talks by a
political candidate might be allowed with
the University's permission. She added
that White Plaza is considered a free
speech area, and individuals do not need
permission to gather and speak there.
Howe said a similar incident happened
several years ago when the University
stepped in and halted plans to hold a
fund-raiser benefitting California senator
Alan Cranston at the Faculty Club.
The last-minute change in plans for
Brown's fund-raiser was "unfortunate,"
Howe said, but the group "seemed to
have started planning somewhat late."

"Maybe we should have looked into
it more," Sagarin conceded. "I figured
the only ones I would have to approve it
with were the people in Terra, and they
were psyched."
But some residents were less than
psyched about the event after interacting
with volunteers for the Brown campaign.
Junior Michael Barsa said a sign
reading "Terra for Clinton" he and sev
eral other students brought to Brown's
speech in White Plaza Saturday was
reaction to the rocky relationship.
Barsa said the "impressions some
people in the house got" were that the
local campaign organizers "were look
ing for an excuse to change the venue."
But Sagarin refuted Barsa's theory.
"There was some concern (among Terra
residents) that the local people didn't
want to have it at Terra house, but I
don't think that's true," Sagarin said.
And Tom Sagehorn, a coordinator
for the Brown campaign, said he "sin
cerely regretted that we couldn't do an
event at Terra House."
Sagehorn said he "wanted to recog
nize the efforts of the Stanford stu
dents" because he was impressed with
the work they have done.
Barsa said some Terra residents
were "unhappy with the way some of
the Brown organizers handled the
house change," and that campaign
organizers had made rude comments to
Terra residents.
He added that communication about
the event could have been better and that
"bad sentiments" developed between
Terra residents and one local organizer.
The last-minute change in plans left
supporters scrambling to relocate
Brown's fund-raising luncheon.
Sagehorn said changing locations was
difficult since the campaign organizers
had "only 24 hours for logistics."
The luncheon was moved to Univer
sity Lutheran Church, which is located
at Stanford and Bowdoin Avenues, just
off campus.
Fortunately, Sagarin said, Terra got
the final word about the change at 1 p.m.
Friday — two hours before the sched
uled house clean-up — preventing resi
dents from needlessly doing housework.
Terra residents will continue "to
wallow in our raunchiness," Sagarin
joked, referring to a comment made
Tuesday by a local campaign organizer
who thought the house needed a clean
ing before Brown's visit.
