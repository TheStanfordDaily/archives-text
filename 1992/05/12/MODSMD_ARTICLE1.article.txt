Stanford Law School is plan
ning to cut $1.5 million from its
budget over the next two years,
meaning some students will have
to pay as much as $4,000 a year
more to attend.
Next year, the Law School's
tuition will increase by nearly
$2,000 — from $16,722 to
$18,686. The increase is due to
the University's overall tuition
increase of 9.5 percent, as well as
a $250 hike added by the school.
At the same time, the Law

School's financial aid packages
will become less generous.
Some Law School students
reacted angrily yesterday, saying
the higher costs will have a detri
mental effect on the school's ability
to attract a diverse student body.
Robert Maldonado, a second
year law student, called the price
hike "outrageous" and said it is
"unwarranted for the tuition to
rise so high in one year."
Dave Shebby, a second-year law
student, said the rise in costs is "a
real shame because it will lead to
more people coming who are rich
and can afford it," while hurting

the middle and lower classes.
"This will harm the diversity of
the Law School," Shebby said.
But Law School Dean Paul
Brest said the cuts were made in a
way that will "protect the quality
of life" at the school.
Brest said he was "sorry they
had to [raise tuition and make the
cutsl, but it is part of the overall
program to make ends meet."
He added that he hopes "in the
long run, the school will not only
recover from this but be even
stronger than before."
The tuition increase will help
alleviate the $900,000 cut made

by the University and an addi
tional $600,000 cut by the Law
School itself. Assoc. Dean Frank
Brucato said the rise was "slight
enough not to cause a burden"
while generating enough income
to balance the cuts.
According to Brucato, the
school's self-imposed $600,000
cut is due to "an internal deficit"
largely related to a plot of land in
Arizona given to the school
almost ten years ago. The school
attempted to sell the land, but the
person who bought it defaulted on


Paul Brest
his loan, forcing the school to make
up the difference, Brucato said.
The land was once worth $4
million, Brucato said. Now, with a
recessive economy and a
depressed real estate market, it is
worth $1 million.
Another reason for the internal
cuts is that "expenses IhadJ risen
faster than the income," he said.
A large part of the cuts are
coming out of the school's finan
cial aid budget. The budget will
remain at its current $2 million
level rather than rising by 9.5 per
cent, along with tuition.
According to Brucato, this rep
resents a "change of policy" in the
school's self-help program, which
determines how much money stu

dents have to provide before the
University will give them scholar
ships.
The amount is being raised
from $13,000 to $14,500, mean
ing that students will have to pro
vide an additional $1,500 before
they receive scholarship money
from the school.
Another change will require
students on financial aid to raise
their summer savings by an addi
tional $500, for a total of $2,000
that students must provide in
extra contributions.
Brucato said the school also
altered the way it determines
parental contribution, changing
the method used to calculate the
amount that students who are
dependent on their parents can
receive.
The new formula assumes
dependent students can receive
$500 to $1,000 more from their

parents to go toward their tuition,
according to Brucato.
This adjustment in the parental
contribution does not affect inde
pendent students, Brucato said.

gram will also be affected by the
cuts. The program aids about 10
Law School graduates per year
who are doing low-income public

service work, and thus not able to
easily repay their loan. The cut in
this program will mean that its
participants will receive less
money to repay their loans.
Other cuts include reducing
three to five faculty positions by
attrition over the next two years,
reducing the number of visiting
faculty and cutting by 10 percent
the school's contribution to the
East Palo Alto Community Law
Program, as well as to other stu
dent organizations, Brucato said.
The cuts in the Law School
were determined by a committee
composed of Brest, Brucato, a stu
dent, the law school librarian and
six faculty members. The commit
tee's proposal was submitted to
and accepted by the University in
January.
Sam Cooper, next year's manag
ing editor of the Stanford Law
Review, said cuts force students to

be more careful about their budgets
by "saving money here and there."
Cooper said he sees "no admin
istrative incompetence" behind
the cuts, adding that "in the end,
there wasn't much of a choice."
Mike Kaplan, a second-year
law student, said he is upset by
the fact that the students will be
"paying more but receiving less."
Brucato said he does not think
the tuition increase and financial
aid decrease will affect the num
ber of applicants to the school.
According to Brucato, the
school's tuition is still slightly lower
than its "peer institutions" and the
financial aid program was "always

"Every other school is going

$18,686. The increase is due to
the University's overall tuition
increase of 9.5 percent, as well as
a $250 hike added by the school.
At the same time, the Law

School's financial aid packages
will become less generous.
Some Law School students
reacted angrily yesterday, saying
the higher costs will have a detri
mental effect on the school's ability
to attract a diverse student body.
Robert Maldonado, a second
year law student, called the price
hike "outrageous" and said it is
"unwarranted for the tuition to
rise so high in one year."
Dave Shebby, a second-year law
student, said the rise in costs is "a
real shame because it will lead to
more people coming who are rich
and can afford it," while hurting

the middle and lower classes.
"This will harm the diversity of
the Law School," Shebby said.
But Law School Dean Paul
Brest said the cuts were made in a
way that will "protect the quality
of life" at the school.
Brest said he was "sorry they
had to [raise tuition and make the
cutsl, but it is part of the overall
program to make ends meet."
He added that he hopes "in the
long run, the school will not only
recover from this but be even
stronger than before."
The tuition increase will help
alleviate the $900,000 cut made

by the University and an addi
tional $600,000 cut by the Law
School itself. Assoc. Dean Frank
Brucato said the rise was "slight
enough not to cause a burden"
while generating enough income
to balance the cuts.
According to Brucato, the
school's self-imposed $600,000
cut is due to "an internal deficit"
largely related to a plot of land in
Arizona given to the school
almost ten years ago. The school
attempted to sell the land, but the
person who bought it defaulted on


Paul Brest
his loan, forcing the school to make
up the difference, Brucato said.
The land was once worth $4
million, Brucato said. Now, with a
recessive economy and a
depressed real estate market, it is
worth $1 million.
Another reason for the internal
cuts is that "expenses IhadJ risen
faster than the income," he said.
A large part of the cuts are
coming out of the school's finan
cial aid budget. The budget will
remain at its current $2 million
level rather than rising by 9.5 per
cent, along with tuition.
According to Brucato, this rep
resents a "change of policy" in the
school's self-help program, which
determines how much money stu

dents have to provide before the
University will give them scholar
ships.
The amount is being raised
from $13,000 to $14,500, mean
ing that students will have to pro
vide an additional $1,500 before
they receive scholarship money
from the school.
Another change will require
students on financial aid to raise
their summer savings by an addi
tional $500, for a total of $2,000
that students must provide in
extra contributions.
Brucato said the school also
altered the way it determines
parental contribution, changing
the method used to calculate the
amount that students who are
dependent on their parents can
receive.
The new formula assumes
dependent students can receive
$500 to $1,000 more from their

parents to go toward their tuition,
according to Brucato.
This adjustment in the parental
contribution does not affect inde
pendent students, Brucato said.
The Law School's Public Inter-

est Low Income Forgiveness Pro
gram will also be affected by the
cuts. The program aids about 10
Law School graduates per year
who are doing low-income public

service work, and thus not able to
easily repay their loan. The cut in
this program will mean that its
participants will receive less
money to repay their loans.
Other cuts include reducing
three to five faculty positions by
attrition over the next two years,
reducing the number of visiting
faculty and cutting by 10 percent
the school's contribution to the
East Palo Alto Community Law
Program, as well as to other stu
dent organizations, Brucato said.
The cuts in the Law School
were determined by a committee
composed of Brest, Brucato, a stu
dent, the law school librarian and
six faculty members. The commit
tee's proposal was submitted to
and accepted by the University in
January.
Sam Cooper, next year's manag
ing editor of the Stanford Law
Review, said cuts force students to

be more careful about their budgets
by "saving money here and there."
Cooper said he sees "no admin
istrative incompetence" behind
the cuts, adding that "in the end,
there wasn't much of a choice."
Mike Kaplan, a second-year
law student, said he is upset by
the fact that the students will be
"paying more but receiving less."
Brucato said he does not think
the tuition increase and financial
aid decrease will affect the num
ber of applicants to the school.
According to Brucato, the
school's tuition is still slightly lower
than its "peer institutions" and the
financial aid program was "always
higher" than other programs.
"Every other school is going
through what we've already been
through — they'll do what we've
already done. So, in the long run,
they'll be cutting when we are
