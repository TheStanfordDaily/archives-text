Stanford Law School is plan
ning to cut $1.5 million from its
budget over the next two years,
meaning some students will have
to pay as much as $4,000 a year
more to attend.
Next year, the Law School's
tuition will increase by nearly
$2,000 — from $16,722 to
$18,686. The increase is due to
the University's overall tuition
increase of 9.5 percent, as well as
a $250 hike added by the school.
At the same time, the Law

School's financial aid packages
will become less generous.
Some Law School students
reacted angrily yesterday, saying
the higher costs will have a detri
mental effect on the school's ability
to attract a diverse student body.
Robert Maldonado, a second
year law student, called the price
hike "outrageous" and said it is
"unwarranted for the tuition to
rise so high in one year."
Dave Shebby, a second-year law
student, said the rise in costs is "a
real shame because it will lead to
more people coming who are rich
and can afford it," while hurting

the middle and lower classes.
"This will harm the diversity of
the Law School," Shebby said.
But Law School Dean Paul
Brest said the cuts were made in a
way that will "protect the quality
of life" at the school.
Brest said he was "sorry they
had to [raise tuition and make the
cutsl, but it is part of the overall
program to make ends meet."
He added that he hopes "in the
long run, the school will not only
recover from this but be even
stronger than before."
The tuition increase will help
alleviate the $900,000 cut made

by the University and an addi
tional $600,000 cut by the Law
School itself. Assoc. Dean Frank
Brucato said the rise was "slight
enough not to cause a burden"
while generating enough income
to balance the cuts.
According to Brucato, the
school's self-imposed $600,000
cut is due to "an internal deficit"
largely related to a plot of land in
Arizona given to the school
almost ten years ago. The school
attempted to sell the land, but the
person who bought it defaulted on
