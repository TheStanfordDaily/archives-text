## Poster display addresses Islamic view on social issues 
### Sadat Huq 
While the nation ponders
what presidential candidates
think about welfare, abortion
and race relations, some stu
dents are encouraging people to
consider what Islam has to say
about such issues.
The Stanford Speakers'
Bureau for Islamic Studies has
begun to exhibit a traveling dis
play of Islamic posters in stu
dent residences.
The six informative posters,
currently being displayed in
Hammarskjold, address the
issues of welfare, familial roles,
race relations, drugs and alco
hol, abortion and the Islamic
social system from an Islamic
perspective.

The project was launched
during a presidential election
year to allow students to com
pare the standpoints of candi
dates with those of Islamic cul
ture.
Tarek Echekki, a member of
the Speakers' Bureau, was
involved in the construction of
the posters. He said the display
is intended to contribute to mul
ticulturalism by providing an
alternative way of looking at
issues.
"Multiculturalism shouldn't
be restricted to only ethnic
awareness, but should encom
pass ideological understanding
as well," he said.
Echekki is working with the
Office of Residential Education
in an attempt to display the

posters in other campus resi
dences throughout the year. He
plans to expand the project next
year by creating more displays
with new topics.
The bureau chose Ham
marskjold — Stanford's inter
national theme house — to be
the first host for the display.
Residents approved the
Bureau's request to exhibit the
posters during a recent house
meeting.
Although the display has
only been set up since Sunday
evening, students have already
had positive reactions to the
project. Pat Peterson, a resident
of Hammarskjold, said the
posters "are a good way to edu
cate people about the Islamic
religion."
