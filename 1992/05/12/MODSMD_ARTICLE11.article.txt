# Free counseling available for pregnant women

Several counseling services are available to preg
nant women at Stanford who are considering abortion.
In addition to contraception services, the Contra
ceptive Information Center provides free counseling
that tries to "help the woman figure out what best fits
her circumstances," according to Katie Lipkin, the
center's director.
"We give them the information about what an abor
tion strictly entails," she said. "I don't think it's a
political thing that we do. We're not providing abor
tions, encouraging abortions or discouraging abor
tions."
Cowell Student Health Center gives women who
think they may be pregnant a pregnancy test and — if
it is positive — refers the woman to counselors from
women's care or psychological services. "We try to get
them to think about choices," said Cowell staff physi
cian John Dorman.
Cowell does not perform or pay for abortions. Obstet
rical care is not paid for by Cowell, Dorman said.
He said the number of pregnant women visiting
Cowell has gone down in recent years, from 120 in
1989 to "somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 or 65
positive tests" last year. However, these numbers
include planned pregnancies, since Cowell treats mar

ried and graduate students as well, he said.
The option of adoption "comes up quite rarely,"
Dorman said. "Ironically, we get a lot of requests from
couples that are looking for a baby" and believe intelli
gent students would have good genes.
He estimated that two or three couples call Cowell
each month wanting to adopt children.
Many Stanford students seeking counseling also
visit the Mountain View Crisis Pregnancy Center,
according to its supervisor, Marian Recine. "We don't
believe that abortion is a good option," she said. "But
we respect a woman's choice."
Recine said the center tries to "let women know the
risks involved" and make sure that they don't feel
trapped into having an abortion. "If they choose not to
have an abortion we are there for them with many,
many services," she said.
The Stanford Pregnancy Crisis Network offers
both free pregnancy tests and peer counselors. Dawn
Delaney, director of the Network, said the group pro
vides information about "whatever the woman
requests."
Women who use the service are always referred to
a doctor, she said.
Delaney said she thinks it is important that the Net
work counsel about abortion because "if we didn't discuss
the option there wouldn't be much point to being
around."
