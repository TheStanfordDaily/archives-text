# 740 ask to view their 'work cards'
## Admissions denies access to some information 
### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
More than 740 students asked
to see comments admissions offi
cers wrote about their Stanford
applications by last week's dead
line, according to Asst. Admis
sions Dean Vivian Barry.
The students took advantage
of a recent federal ruling that per
mits students to inspect the usu
ally closely guarded documents.
Of those students, more than
600 have set up half-hour
appointments to view their "work
cards," page-long documents that
contain reader comments and
summaries of teacher recommen
dations, Barry said.
But students, who began view
ing their records in groups of up
to 12 yesterday, are not permitted
to see comments derived from
teacher recommendations.
And those who did not request
to see their work card by May 7
will not get to see them at all,
Barry said. The unrequested
work cards were carted off to a
shredder yesterday morning.

Barry said her office found
records as far back as 1983, but
was unable to locate four work
cards that had been requested.
This reporter — who asked to
see her work card — filed a com
plaint last week with the U.S.
Department of Education about
Stanford's policy that prevents
students from seeing comments
derived from teacher sum
maries.
The department enforces the
Family Education Rights Privacy
Act, the law that allows students
enrolled in a school to inspect the
information the school maintains
about them.
The act was tested last year
when a Harvard alumnus
requested access to the reader
comments about his application.
The department ruled in the
alumnus' favor.
Assoc. General Counsel Iris
Brest, responding to the com
plaint, argued to the department
that students have effectively
surrendered their rights of access
to material derived from teacher
recommendations because the

recommendations were "univer
sally understood to be confiden
tial."
According to Department of
Education regulations, a school
may deny students access to
information only if students have
signed a waiver to that effect.
There is no such waiver on
Stanford applications.
Brest argued that "students
have in fact waived access to those
letters, even though the formali
ties .. . are not adhered to."
Brest also argued that work
cards should not be considered
"education records" because they
are kept separate from the regu
lar student file stored at the Reg
istrar's office, and therefore are
not eligible for inspection by stu
dents.
Harvard University made a
similar argument last year when
the alumnus requested access to
his reader comments.
That ruling prompted students
at college newspapers around the
country, including The Daily, to
request access to their work
cards.
