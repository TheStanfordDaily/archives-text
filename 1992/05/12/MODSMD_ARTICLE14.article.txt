## An unlikely alliance 
### 
AN ALLIANCE between an
anti-communist institu
tion and the former leader
of the Soviet Union? It would
have been laughable not too long
ago.
But Mikhail Gorbachev and
Hoover Institution are currently
discussing the once-unlikely part
nership. Both parties will hopefully
come to the conclusion that they
have much to gain from such a rela
tionship.
Hoover's director and deputy
director both say they discussed
cooperation between the institution
and the Gorbachev Foundation/USA
during Gorbachev's tour Saturday.
The foundation was created to
suppport democratic reform in the
former Soviet republics.
Although no specific partnership
plans were made, the casual conver
sation could bear fruit â€” especially
if Gorbachev sets up a foundation
office in San Francisco's Presidio,

as he has hinted he may do.
A chance to learn first-hand
from the historic statesman who
guided and witnessed the rapid
changes in the Soviet Union is not
to be passed up.
And for Stanford, the association
would confirm that it is still a world
class university despite a reputation
tarnished by the indirect-cost con
troversy and painful budget cuts.
For Gorbachev, access to one of
the largest collections of 20th-cen
tury Russian history outside of
Russia and a group of the country's
pre-eminent experts on interna
tional affairs is certainly enticing.
Through the partnership,
Hoover has a chance to influence
the future of a country considered
an enemy until very recently.
Through ties to Gorbachev and his
foundation, they can contribute
advice as well as resources toward
the restructuring of the newly inde
pendent republics.
