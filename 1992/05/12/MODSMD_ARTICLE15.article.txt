# The 						other Gorbachev
## 
### 
TEN YEARS AGO, it would
have been unthinkable for
the wife of a Soviet leader to
have a fellowship established in her
name so scholars could study corpo
rate finance in the United States.
It would also have been unthink
able for her to receive a standing
ovation at a university in the Unit
ed States.
But this is exactly what Raisa
Gorbachev, former Soviet president
Mikhail Gorbachev's wife, has
accomplished.
Almost 10,000 people stood up
to cheer when former Secretary of
State and Hoover Distinguished
fellow George Shultz introduced
her as the "great woman behind a
great man."
And although this expression
may be a cliche, it is true that Raisa
Gorbachev has changed the stereo
typed image of the Russian peasant
woman. She has a taste for clothes
and perfume, and is a "woman with

a credit card," according to History
Prof. Alexander Dallin.
The Friends of Raisa Foundation,
based in San Francisco, funded the
fellowship. It gives three scholars
from the former Soviet Union the
opportunity of coming to the United
States to do research and course
work in market-related topics.
Raisa Gorbachev was an active
participant in choosing the first
recipient of the fellowship, Tatiana
Krylova. Krylova, a professor of
economics at Moscow State Uni
versity, said the fellowship came
through only because of the per
sonal attention of Raisa Gorbachev.
Raisa Gorbachev's visibility
demonstrates that the vision of the
"woman behind the leader" is
starting to fade. Now the woman is
beside the leader — and, some
times, is the leader.
And although Raisa Gorbachev is
not involved in politics, her visibility
and attitude are positive changes.
