## On doing the right thing 
### 
RECENT EVENTS, from the Rod
ney King verdict to summer job
rejections, have sparked a hundred
doubts in my mind about what it is possi
ble for a person to achieve in a lifetime.
Once again, the campus is quiet. In
the wake of the riots in Los Angeles and
all around the country, I have to wonder:
Is anything going to change? I read the
stories in my Chicano Narrative class.
Works by Paredes, Rivera, Rechy, Cis
neros and others. And their stories are
still the stories of today — stories of
injustice, prejudice and a system that
keeps people down.

Friday night, poet/activist Nikki Giovan
ni explained how it's not what white peo
ple did a hundred years ago that blacks
are angry about. It's what they are doing
now.
My friend has just returned from
travelling and working odd jobs in South
America for half a year. I asked him how
his experiences there have changed him
and his beliefs. He told me that there has
been and always will be suffering,
though sometimes it is not so bad as
other times.
Is that it? Is that the great revelation?
I think about people, their daily lives,
and my own life. What am I going to do
to change the world? For it can certainly
be better. We still have some means to
make it better.

I have always respected people who
dedicate themselves to public service,
and I finally have to ask myself, "Well,
why don't I just drop my major in com
puter science and do that if I think it's so
important? What's stopping me?"
It has become so hard to sort out
what I really want to do from what I
want to do because my parents think it's
a good idea, because it's the "smart"
thing to do and gives me "job security."
As if anything could be a sure thing
these days.
Being seniors, my friends are looking
for jobs. Seeing their difficulty, I think
twice about dropping computer science.
What if I can't support myself? My par
ents aren't always going to be there.
Many of us come to Stanford because
of the unspoken promise that we will
succeed, or at least have a better life than
our parents. For those who come from
the lower class and/or a minority back
ground, these expectations are doubly
important.
For parents, a college education is the
promise that their children will suffer
less from the discrimination and preju
dice they continue to face. It is an affir
mation of their labor if their children can
succeed, and a promise that change will
come.
The pressure is great in choosing a
major or profession and then pursuing it.
It is equally great for those who jeopar-

the world?

better.'

dize their Stanford careers by protesting,
by marching, by taking over buildings.
Usually, people just joke about
parental pressure and expectations. I
suppose it's a given, but small things
build up until they can no longer be
ignored. Just one more thing will make
it all come tumbling down — a failed
midterm, an inconsiderate remark,
riots in LA. And then you feel like you
can't breathe or your heart is being
crushed.
So many times we must choose. Do
the right thing. What is the right thing?
What am I supposed to do with my life?
As Giovanni said so rightly, we didn't
have any say about being born and we're
not going to have any say about dying.
But we can certainly do something in
between.
In the end, I think about what Cather
ine Milton, director of the Haas Public
Service Center, told me over spring
break. She said you have to choose what
will make you happy. And in whatever
field that is, you can make a difference.
For the better.
