Reaction to King verdict in New York suggests hope

THE PEACE WAS deafening in
New York the weekend after the
Rodney King beating verdict.
After viewing the violence in Los Ange
les and taking part in Stanford's initial
march to Palo Alto April 29,1 was
expecting a lot of angry activity as I flew
to New York the next afternoon. There
was none.
Part of the reason why things were
fairly calm is that New Yorkers have
been offered hope over the years. While
receiving a huge amount of national cov
erage for racial incidents in such places
as Howard Beach and Bensonhurst, the
city's court system has also proved effec
tive and fairly unbiased.
In both cases mentioned, white men
manifested their irrational hatred for
blacks in the form of violence. Both
times, they were tried and convicted. For

the most part, they are still in jail, and
while New York was shocked by the
Rodney King verdict there was little vio
lence over the weekend.
There was hope because New York
has demonstrated that it has a con
science. It has shown that it recognizes
that discrimination in any form is a pun
ishable crime. It has had the decency to
investigate highly visible cases and pros
ecute the men at fault. However, many
less visible cases go unnoticed. My friend
Alvin, who is currently vice president of
the Black Students Union at Harvard,
was thrown in the back of a cop car and
questioned at gunpoint about a robbery
he did not commit. In fact, he was not
even in the vicinity of the crime.
But he was black, and letters to Con
gressmen, Assembly members and even
the Mayor of New York did not elicit a

response or investigation.
Despite cases such as this one, New
York has had the decency to show the
country its best moral side in highly visi
ble cases.
Perhaps that was the biggest problem
with the Rodney King verdict. With the
spotlight focused on the United States'
legal system, the jury made the con
scious decision to send a message to the
world: America discriminates and shows
no shame, no conscience whatsoever.
It was not just a group of twelve prej
udiced men and women who delivered
the verdict. It was all of us.
The violence which followed in the
wake of the verdict cannot be viewed as
a reaction against white America.
Whites were not affected. What all of us
witnessed was the internal destruction
of black communities by the very people

who live in them.
It was as if blacks across America
were screaming, "No system is better
than the one which you have given us.
Nothingness is better than hopeless
ness." People who worked their whole
lives to escape the desperateness of ghet
to life were thrust back by those desiring
the same end in life.
Perhaps it is hypocritical of New York
to seize the high moral ground in head
line cases. Perhaps the city should focus
more on accusations which affect
minorities every day. But at least New
York is trying.
Somewhere, this country has a con
science, and if the jury in Los Angeles
will not bear it, then somebody else
must. This is all too painful to watch.
