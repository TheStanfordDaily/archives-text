# Roble incident should not resuscitate hatred
## 
### 
This letter is in response to the inci
dents at Roble at about 1 a.m. Thursday
morning. The cast of the Roble musical
was practicing when a couple of black
youths yelled, "Kill all white people.
What the fuck are you staring at!" and
proceeded to throw two rocks through
the dining hall's windows.
I am not recounting this incident for
sensation. In fact, I was very upset when
Daily reporters arrived soon after the
vandals to cover the story.
I was afraid that the incident would
be sensationalized and filed under the
category of "another black supremacist
violent act."
Over the past week, following the
Rodney King verdict, the black commu
nity, and many other Stanford commu
nities, have rallied to make powerful yet
peaceful statements regarding the prob
lems in our country. Hundreds of people

got together to voice their frustrations
in non-violent, non-destructive manners.
The reason I am so upset about this
random incident is the fact that it alone
could practically destroy the work of all
those people. These youths by one simple
act of throwing rocks into a room could
instill a stereotype of black men as non
thinking violent animals. I hate the fact
that because they rem towards Lagunita
people will assume that they ran into Uja
maa where "all the black radicals live."
I hate the fact that people can now
think that all those letter writing cam
paigns were insignificant because black
men really are just violent men.
This incident seems to verify the
argument that the black men of this
world, the Rodney Kings of this world,
should all be beaten down until they are
willing to cooperate.
I am writing this letter as a black
female at Stanford. I want to express my
concern that this incident will rebuild
the walls of hatred that just were begin
ning to be torn down.
I hope that people will realize that

this was in fact an isolated incident, that
all black men are not violent, that we
don't know enough about the perpetra
tors to understand their rage and that
this incident is not a denial of all the
good that has gone on before it.
