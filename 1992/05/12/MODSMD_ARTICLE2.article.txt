### June Fang Staff writer 
The Rev. Jesse Jackson will speak on
racial violence and Asian-bashing May 20
in Memorial Auditorium as part of Asian-
American Heritage Month.
"He'll probably talk about the violence
toward people of color, generally relating
to the Rodney King verdict," said Keith
Archuleta, director of the Black Communi
ty Services Center. He added that he hopes
Jackson will also speak about Asian-Amer
icans and the economy.
The outspoken civil rights leader, who
ran for president in 1984 and 1988, is
expected to give a speech similar to those
he gave at UC-Berkeley and UCLA, focus
ing on anti-Asian sentiments related to
economic issues between the United

States and Japan.
"He has been doing a lot of speaking on
Asian-bashing," said Cindy Ng, program
director at the Asian American Activities
Center. "He feels that there needs to be a
voice that addresses the issue of the eco
nomic problems in the U.S., other than
blaming Japan or Asian-Americans in this
country."
Certain incidents have brought Asian
bashing to the forefront in recent years, Ng
said. For example, while attending the Cit
rus Bowl last year, UC-Berkeley Chancellor
Chang-lin Tien was allegedly booed with
shouts of "Buy American" from the crowd.
According to Ng, Jackson's speech will
last 45 minutes and will be followed by a
question and answer session. Jackson is
scheduled to speak at 3 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium.
