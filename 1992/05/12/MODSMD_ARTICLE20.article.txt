# Theme houses respond to Rodney King verdict
## 
### 
We wish to express our outrage in
regards to the Rodney King verdict. The
decision was a mockery of justice that
merely reflects the great social injustices
that occur throughout the country. This
is not an isolated case, and it is not
exclusive to African Americans.
All minority and marginalized groups
in this country are subject to the injus
tices of the judicial and social systems.
The verdict affects all of us because it
undeniably shows the entire world the
reality of the "American Dream." This
includes the inequalities in our legal pro

cess, social services, media portrayals,
and political empowerment.
The many rebellions after the verdict
are proof that people are disenfranchised
from the power structure of the country
because they lack fundamental services
and suffer from blatant racial discrimi
nation and social injustices.
While we condemn the violence of the
riots, we also condemn police brutality
and the racist verdict of the Simi valley
jury. We understand that the riots are a
result of pent-up frustrations due to
growing racial, social, and economic divi
sions and inequalities.
We feel that these issues must be
addressed. Ethnic studies curricula, eth
nic related research projects, and the
ethnic theme houses are grounds where
these issues can be discussed and solu
tions formulated.
We all stand together in solidarity to
solve these social problems.
