# Gorbachev addresses problems in former Soviet Union
## 
### 
The following are excerpts from
former Soviet president Mikhail
Gorbachev's speech at Frost
Amphitheater Saturday.
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary Schultz,
ladies and gentlemen, friends:
I am here among you for the second
time at your world-famous university,
whose achievements and whose gradu
ates play such a prominent role in techni
cal research and in the humanities. My
friend, Mr. Schultz, advised me to take as
my theme the role of law, in the context,
of course, of the political changes which
have occurred in the world and above all
in my own country since 1985.
Watershed periods in history may not
be very comfortable for those who live in
them, but they do, as a rule, at least stim
ulate deeper reflection and self-aware
ness. ...
It seems that we today are passing
through just such a period of reflection —
a period of acute sensitivity to human
rights, to the rights of the individual, a
period in which we rethink fundamental
values. One of these values is the
supremacy of law in a governmental sys
tem. This is an essential premise of the
new world order....
I must really mention the dissident
movement, whose influence extended to a
substantial part of the creative intellectu
als, the students, and even to some areas
of the economic and party governmental
apparatus.
External factors also played an
increasingly powerful role in the promo
tion of human rights and a humanistic
dimension as major components of nor

mal international relations, although this
was done also for ideological reasons.
"We can't go on like this." This sen
tence was first pronounced on the evening
before the March 1985 plenum of the
party's central committee, which after the
death of Chemenko were supposed to
elect a new secretary general, meaning in
our traditions a new chief of state. This
was actually the beginning of the new pol
icy which later became known throughout
the world as perestroika. Its purpose was
to end this totalitarian system.
Did the people who took this decision
know what awaited them? Did they real
ize the scale of the task and its conse
quences? Inasmuch as this question is
directed first and foremost at me, I will
say yes, we knew the system, we knew it
inside out. We realized full well how
mighty and monolithic this monster was,
welding together as it did the party
machine and the state structures. One
had to have this knowledge to have any
hope of success.
I'm asked many questions about my
motives, about the reasons for my vari
ous positions and decisions. As you evi
dently will know from reading the press, I
am today working on my memoirs, and
there I try to answer these questions. I'm
going to tell you how I made my choices,
what I had to live through and think
through, how my views evolved through
the very process of perestroika. I hope
that when this book appears, you'll be
willing to expend a certain sum of money
to acquire it. ...
We wanted change, even radical
change, but we remained part of the sys
tem. Therefore, our actions and our deci

sion-making processes could not help but
be effected by the habits learned in our
previous experience. And we had, after all,
to take the realities into consideration.
Politics is the art of the possible, the
emergence of agreed interests through the
process of choice. Any other approach
would be volunteerism or adventur
ism. ...
But under our conditions, [respect for
democracy! was only possible through the
party and with the party's help. This
paradox, as things turned out, contained
a major threat to the cause of perestroika.
The incipient democratic and economic
transformations disclosed such defects in
our society that we soon found ourselves
in an all-encompassing and systemic
social crisis. The reforms engendered
opposition and a political struggle com
menced. ...
By [1988], things had become clear. A
partial reform of one or another piece of
the administrative system would yield
nothing. Everything hinged on the politi
cal system and the de facto omnipotence
of the party apparatus.
Political reform affected the interests
of many, and here I want to stress one
important principle which explains much
of what happened afterwards.
I'm refering to the relationship between
politics and morality. From the very onset
of the crisis, I tried to avoid a violently
explosive resolution of the contradictions.
I swore to myself, that I would do every
thing possible to ensure that, for the first
time in my country's history, cardinal
transformations would take place in a
more or less peaceable form without blood
shed, without the inevitable division of

society, without civil war.
Therefore, I tried to use tactical moves
to gain time, to give the democratic move
ment a chance to get stronger. As presi
dent of a country I had many powers,
including emergency ones. And more
than once people tried to make me use
them, tried to push me into an extremist
position. As is known, this is something
the self-styled committee on the emergen
cy demanded of me during the August
coup. But I simply couls not betray
myself. ...
Even today, my opponents and even
some of my supporters like to call me
irresolute. Many would like to be, or to
seem, or at least would like to present
themselves as decisive politicians. But,
when put to the test, such decisiveness is
only a flouting of the realities and vio
lence against the people. And this is no
longer politics at all
My approach, ultimately, allowed me
to gain time, a very small amount of time
when measured by historical standards
but still enough to build up sufficient
democratic potential in society to act as a
basis for further transformations. ...
Our movement forward to the rule of
law is burdened by our dark heritage, the
discordant attitude of our society to law,
the weakness and even absence of a polit
ical culture in the overwhelming majority
of our people, the historically conditioned
disrespect for law and our hostility
toward those who are professionally
responsible for the preservation of order.
Disrespect for legality was even mani
fested by those who at the end of last
year decided on the fate of the Soviet
Union as a state....

Behind the back of the president of the
country and the heads of the other
sovereign republics, behind the backs of
the Supreme Soviets, three leaders
announced that the union state had ceased
to exist and instead of it was created a
Commonwealth of Independent States.
The country was confronted with a fait
accompli. The events of December 1991
are described in detail in my soon-to-be
published b00k....
Once the formation of the Common
wealth had been at the last moment sanc
tioned by the parliaments of the adhering
states, I accepted this as a reality and
announced my resignation from the pres
idency.
My opinion of what occurred had hot
changed, and I'm not urging that we go
back to the past. But we are now in an
extremely serious crisis of legality, but
there are encouraging signs and tendencies.
I welcome the Russian federative
treaty which was signed at the end of
March. I hope that the integrity of the
multi-ethnic Russian federation will be
retained, and that it will ultimately adopt
a genuinely democratic constitution
which will facilitate resolution of the
enormous problems now confronting
Russia, including its position as successor
state to the Soviet Union....
And I would like to conclude with an
expression of hope and faith that Russia
and the other countries of the Common
wealth, with the support of the world
community, will preserve their democratic
gains and enter the 21st century as civi
lized nations capable of making their own
distinguished contribution to peace and
the progress of humanity. Thank you.

increasingly powerful role in the promo
tion of human rights and a humanistic
dimension as major components of nor

mal international relations, although this
was done also for ideological reasons.
"We can't go on like this." This sen
tence was first pronounced on the evening
before the March 1985 plenum of the
party's central committee, which after the
death of Chemenko were supposed to
elect a new secretary general, meaning in
our traditions a new chief of state. This
was actually the beginning of the new pol
icy which later became known throughout
the world as perestroika. Its purpose was
to end this totalitarian system.
Did the people who took this decision
know what awaited them? Did they real
ize the scale of the task and its conse
quences? Inasmuch as this question is
directed first and foremost at me, I will
say yes, we knew the system, we knew it
inside out. We realized full well how
mighty and monolithic this monster was,
welding together as it did the party
machine and the state structures. One
had to have this knowledge to have any
hope of success.
I'm asked many questions about my
motives, about the reasons for my vari
ous positions and decisions. As you evi
dently will know from reading the press, I
am today working on my memoirs, and
there I try to answer these questions. I'm
going to tell you how I made my choices,
what I had to live through and think
through, how my views evolved through
the very process of perestroika. I hope
that when this book appears, you'll be
willing to expend a certain sum of money
to acquire it. ...
We wanted change, even radical
change, but we remained part of the sys
tem. Therefore, our actions and our deci

sion-making processes could not help but
be effected by the habits learned in our
previous experience. And we had, after all,
to take the realities into consideration.
Politics is the art of the possible, the
emergence of agreed interests through the
process of choice. Any other approach
would be volunteerism or adventur
ism. ...
But under our conditions, [respect for
democracy! was only possible through the
party and with the party's help. This
paradox, as things turned out, contained
a major threat to the cause of perestroika.
The incipient democratic and economic
transformations disclosed such defects in
our society that we soon found ourselves
in an all-encompassing and systemic
social crisis. The reforms engendered
opposition and a political struggle com
menced. ...
By [1988], things had become clear. A
partial reform of one or another piece of
the administrative system would yield
nothing. Everything hinged on the politi
cal system and the de facto omnipotence
of the party apparatus.
Political reform affected the interests
of many, and here I want to stress one
important principle which explains much
of what happened afterwards.
I'm refering to the relationship between
politics and morality. From the very onset
of the crisis, I tried to avoid a violently
explosive resolution of the contradictions.
I swore to myself, that I would do every
thing possible to ensure that, for the first
time in my country's history, cardinal
transformations would take place in a
more or less peaceable form without blood
shed, without the inevitable division of

society, without civil war.
Therefore, I tried to use tactical moves
to gain time, to give the democratic move
ment a chance to get stronger. As presi
dent of a country I had many powers,
including emergency ones. And more
than once people tried to make me use
them, tried to push me into an extremist
position. As is known, this is something
the self-styled committee on the emergen
cy demanded of me during the August
coup. But I simply couls not betray
myself. ...
Even today, my opponents and even
some of my supporters like to call me
irresolute. Many would like to be, or to
seem, or at least would like to present
themselves as decisive politicians. But,
when put to the test, such decisiveness is
only a flouting of the realities and vio
lence against the people. And this is no
longer politics at all
My approach, ultimately, allowed me
to gain time, a very small amount of time
when measured by historical standards
but still enough to build up sufficient
democratic potential in society to act as a
basis for further transformations. ...
Our movement forward to the rule of
law is burdened by our dark heritage, the
discordant attitude of our society to law,
the weakness and even absence of a polit
ical culture in the overwhelming majority
of our people, the historically conditioned
disrespect for law and our hostility
toward those who are professionally
responsible for the preservation of order.
Disrespect for legality was even mani
fested by those who at the end of last
year decided on the fate of the Soviet
Union as a state....

Behind the back of the president of the
country and the heads of the other
sovereign republics, behind the backs of
the Supreme Soviets, three leaders
announced that the union state had ceased
to exist and instead of it was created a
Commonwealth of Independent States.
The country was confronted with a fait
accompli. The events of December 1991
are described in detail in my soon-to-be
published b00k....
Once the formation of the Common
wealth had been at the last moment sanc
tioned by the parliaments of the adhering
states, I accepted this as a reality and
announced my resignation from the pres
idency.
My opinion of what occurred had hot
changed, and I'm not urging that we go
back to the past. But we are now in an
extremely serious crisis of legality, but
there are encouraging signs and tendencies.
I welcome the Russian federative
treaty which was signed at the end of
March. I hope that the integrity of the
multi-ethnic Russian federation will be
retained, and that it will ultimately adopt
a genuinely democratic constitution
which will facilitate resolution of the
enormous problems now confronting
Russia, including its position as successor
state to the Soviet Union....
And I would like to conclude with an
expression of hope and faith that Russia
and the other countries of the Common
wealth, with the support of the world
community, will preserve their democratic
gains and enter the 21st century as civi
lized nations capable of making their own
distinguished contribution to peace and
the progress of humanity. Thank you.
The following are excerpts from
former Soviet president Mikhail
Gorbachev's speech at Frost
Amphitheater Saturday.
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary Schultz,
ladies and gentlemen, friends:
I am here among you for the second
time at your world-famous university,
whose achievements and whose gradu
ates play such a prominent role in techni
cal research and in the humanities. My
friend, Mr. Schultz, advised me to take as
my theme the role of law, in the context,
of course, of the political changes which
have occurred in the world and above all
in my own country since 1985.
Watershed periods in history may not
be very comfortable for those who live in
them, but they do, as a rule, at least stim
ulate deeper reflection and self-aware
ness. ...
It seems that we today are passing
through just such a period of reflection —
a period of acute sensitivity to human
rights, to the rights of the individual, a
period in which we rethink fundamental
values. One of these values is the
supremacy of law in a governmental sys
tem. This is an essential premise of the
new world order....
I must really mention the dissident
movement, whose influence extended to a
substantial part of the creative intellectu
als, the students, and even to some areas
of the economic and party governmental
apparatus.
External factors also played an
increasingly powerful role in the promo
tion of human rights and a humanistic
dimension as major components of nor

mal international relations, although this
was done also for ideological reasons.
