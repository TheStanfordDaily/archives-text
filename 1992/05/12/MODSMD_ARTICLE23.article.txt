## Martha Brockenbrough 'We can't go on like this': Remembering humanity in a handshake 
### 
Mikhail Gorbachev shakes hands
like my father does — shyly and
gently, but firmly.
He's about my father's height — 5
feet 7 inches tall. Their hair is the same
silky gray.
But if someone told me two years or
even a week ago that I would be shaking
Gorbachev's hand and thinking of my
father, I would never have believed it.
When he visited Stanford in 1990,
Gorbachev verged on divinity. And my
father? He's been almost, but not quite,
divine for as long as I can remember.
A lot has changed for Gorbachev in
the two years since he last swept
through Stanford. Once held high as a
symbol of the New World Order, he's
been cut down, even exiled for a time, by
his people.
Now, he's suspended somewhere
between divine and demonic — he's
human.
I felt this acutely when I shook hands
with him Saturday at a luncheon cele
brating his visit.
Gorbachev stood between his wife and
the ruddy, protective former Secretary
of State George Shultz. An earnest-look
ing interpreter with a long Russian
beard leaned tentatively between Gor-

bachev's and Shultz's shoulders, his lips
puckered expectantly.
"I admire your courage and convic
tion," I said to Gorbachev, pausing for
the translation.
He smiled at this.
"You have been an inspiration to me
and to many students in my genera
tion," I said.
With this, Gorbachev took my right
hand in both of his — a politician's
handshake, but so much more real than
I expected.
And then I moved aside to let the
next person in the reception line have
her turn. For the rest of the weekend,
though, my thoughts circled around the
experience.
What does it mean when the being
who changed the world as the president
of the Soviet Union travels to the United
States, in part to defend his record and
sell his book?
What does it mean when the enemy
becomes the friend, and the country I
was trained to hate no longer exists?
Americans are a restless people. We
obsessively create enemies and
heroes — and as quickly as we
build them, we tear them down.

The media feeds the restless beast.
Witness the struggle of the likely Demo
cratic presidential nominee, Bill Clin
ton. After an early inauguration as the
"front-runner," his personal life was
ruthlessly scrutinized in the name of
character.
Now, he is as infamous as he is
famous. And we're no closer to solving
the problems this country faces — prob
lems that surfaced so powerfully two
weeks ago in Los Angeles and other
cities after the four police officers who
brutally beat Rodney King were acquit
ted.
Why were fire and fury so swift to
surface after the verdict?
Surely it wasn't, as our president
claimed, a result of Lyndon Johnson's
social programs of the 1960s — most of
those were systematically dismantled by
Presidents Reagan and Bush.
Logic, though, isn't a strong point for
Bush, himself a fallen hero. Bush
promised to restore peace in Los Ange
les with "whatever force" was neces
sary.
While brute force may have won him
points in the Persian Gulf, it is frighten
ing that he would attempt to win back
the support of his country with the

same tactics.
Blaming our country's problems on
the media and the politicians,
however, breeds the same problem
as the creation and destruction of
heroes: It shifts the focus away from
ourselves.
As Gorbachev said in his speech Sat
urday, we are at a crossroads. "Water
shed periods in history may not be very
comfortable for those who live in them,
but they do, as a rule, at least stimulate
people's reflection and self-awareness,"
he said.
This period of history cannot be very
comfortable for many. AIDS, the reces
sion, rising poverty, drug abuse, racism,
sexism — and most "isms" — make
unpleasant companions.
We must take advantage of the dis
comfort and search our souls for
answers. As Gorbachev said Saturday,
"We can't go on like this."
It is time for those of us who are able
— and that's all of us at Stanford —
to apply our minds, talents and ener
gy to finding solutions to the problems
surrounding us.
Stanford's peaceful protest against

the King beating verdict was a start, for
we — and not the heroes we tend to cre
ate — are the owners of democracy.
But more than speech is needed to '
steer us through this watershed. It is
time for us to turn to those who have
less than we do.
We need to accept, educate and sup
port those who would otherwise fall
through the cracks in the almighty sys
tem.
We need to look less at what we want
to acquire, and more toward what we
want to give.
Ours is a generation straddling the
gorge between hope and disappointment
No single hero has the strength to pull
us all across — if we would even allow .
ourselves to be rescued before, we cruci-,
fied the savior. .: iijjxlj
To make the leap from disappoints
ment to hope, we must remember the
humanity in the handshakes of our
heroes.
Our humanity, our freedom, is the
best thing we have.
It can be enough.
