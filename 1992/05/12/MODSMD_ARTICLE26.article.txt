# Card prepares for postseason
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Despite the recent hot play of the Cardinal, Stan
ford was not chosen as one of the eight sites for
NCAA baseball regionals Monday. Tucson, Ariz.,
home of the Arizona Wildcats, instead was picked as
the site of the West regional, with the NCAA com
mittee obviously believing that the Wildcats will
end up in first place in the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion. Stanford probably fell a game or two short of
hosting, and will most likely go to a non-West
regional to be announced next Monday.
The NCAA in fact chose only one West regional,
while slating two South regionals, not to mention
two others in Florida and another in Mississippi.
While there is unquestionably talent in the South,
the West looks like it may be getting slighted — and
not just the Pac-10 teams. Respected programs such
as Pepperdirte, Long Beach State, and Cal State-
Fullerton were passed up in favor of southern
schools.
In all, three Southeastern Conference teams
were chosen to host regionals as opposed to one
Pac-10 school. The choices may follow the wide
held supposition that the Six-Pac isn't competitive
this year.
"IThe Six-Pac] is not down, we're just very bal
anced," said coach Mark Marquess. "I think we
deserve five bids [to regionals], but we may not get
four. Schools don't want a Six-Pac team to come to
their regional because they know that [the Six-Pac
team] has a shot of taking it."
In the four non-conference games remaining on
Stanford's regular season, Marquess is concentrat
ing on getting the players ready for the postseason.
Starters will probably keep playing in order to stay
sharp, but other players may get at-bats to prepare
them for possible pinch-hitting duties. Pitchers will
also be prepared for the playoffs.
"We'll put the pitchers on pitch counts," Mar
quess said. "We want to get their arms rested for
regionals."
The first of those non-conference games will be
today at 1 p.m. when the Cardinal takes on the Uni
versity of the Pacific Tigers at Billy Hevert Field in
Stockton. Stanford faced Pacific way back on Feb.
12 in a 6-0 win with Jamie Sepeda and Willie Adams
combining for a no-hitter (which reportedly is sta
tistically more prevalent than hitting for the cycle
— kudos to Steve Solomon).
