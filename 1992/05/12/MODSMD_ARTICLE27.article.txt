# Wooding handles problem sets, bunkers
## 
### Tish Williams Staff writer 
Balancing over 10 five-day golf
tournaments each year with a
mechanical engineering major is
not something for the faint of
heart, but Audrey Wooding is
managing her schedule in grand
fashion.
"Stressed? Oh gosh . .. you can
tell?!" Wooding laughed. "I try
not to be too regimented. Well, for
instance, Friday and Saturday
night I did absolutely no work. I
watched Saturday Night Live last
night. . .just vegetating."
Friday and Saturday nights
off? Throw caution to the wind.
But Wooding's somewhat strict
agenda is understandable, consid
ering she spends three to five
hours a day on the golf course
during the spring, the busiest sea
son for the Stanford golfers.
In-between weekly problem
sets, Wooding leaves the Farm
with the team, travelling to such
places as Hawaii, Arizona and
Monterrey for tournaments. Soon
the Cardinal will head back to Ari
zona for the NCAA Champi
onship tournament, Wooding's
last competitive college tourna
ment.
Wooding has been the Cardi
nal's consistent leader this sea
son, contributing to Stanford's
fourth-seed in the NCAA tourney,
as well as placing her on the Pacif
ic 10 First Team, among the best
individual golfers in the nation.
She was an Academic All-Ameri
can as well as honorable mention
Ail-American last year, which she
will equal or surpass this year.
"Audrey is extremely self-moti
vated and manages her time very
well," said women's coach Tim
Baldwin. "A coach wants five
Audreys."
Although golf keeps her on the
run, Wooding stressed that,"it's
really helped shape the person
that I am .... You face a lot of
challenges on your own in golf.
You learn how to deal on your
own, to get through the pressure
times and how to still have fun,"
which all help Wooding in life off
the golf course.

In the regular tournaments in
which Stanford plays, the compe
tition involves three 18-hole
rounds of golf, played in three
days, or two, with two rounds in
one day. The rounds take from
four to five hours, belying the
relaxing, simple image golf has
acquired.
Lugging clubs around the
course, not to mention dealing
with the hills and the heat, can
wear down even the most mental
ly tough athlete. And with so
many different opportunities to
make good, or bad shots, the need
for focus and levelheadedness are
crucial.

You see someone
hit a a bad shot,
and you know they
just want to whale
that club and throw
it like a helicopter.'
— Audrey Wooding

"Golf is different in that
respect," Wooding explained.
"You have so much time to think
about each shot. My friends ask
me how you keep from getting
totally nervous with so much time
to think. You really have to learn
to control your nervousness ...
and frustration. You see someone
hit a a bad shot, and you know
they just want to whale that club
and throw it like a helicopter."
Wooding emphasizes the need
to have fun in tournaments, even
under pressure, which leads to
descriptions of endless practical
jokes played after tournaments.
One instance involved hiding an
innocent octopus in the beds of
her teammates during a tour of
Asia last summer.
"Sometimes (Coach Baldwin)
comes up to me and says 'Audrey,
you've got to stop having so much
fun out there' ... because I'll be
laughing up a storm on the golf

Senior Audrey Wooding has quite a handle on her golf game. The mechanical engi
neering major has laughed and joked her way to the top of the collegiate golfing world
and had a good time doing it. She and the rest of the Stanford women's golf team will
travel to Arizona for the NCAA Championships in two weeks.
