# Wooding handles problem sets, bunkers
## 
### Tish Williams Staff writer 
Balancing over 10 five-day golf
tournaments each year with a
mechanical engineering major is
not something for the faint of
heart, but Audrey Wooding is
managing her schedule in grand
fashion.
"Stressed? Oh gosh . .. you can
tell?!" Wooding laughed. "I try
not to be too regimented. Well, for
instance, Friday and Saturday
night I did absolutely no work. I
watched Saturday Night Live last
night. . .just vegetating."
Friday and Saturday nights
off? Throw caution to the wind.
But Wooding's somewhat strict
agenda is understandable, consid
ering she spends three to five
hours a day on the golf course
during the spring, the busiest sea
son for the Stanford golfers.
In-between weekly problem
sets, Wooding leaves the Farm
with the team, travelling to such
places as Hawaii, Arizona and
Monterrey for tournaments. Soon
the Cardinal will head back to Ari
zona for the NCAA Champi
onship tournament, Wooding's
last competitive college tourna
ment.
Wooding has been the Cardi
nal's consistent leader this sea
son, contributing to Stanford's
fourth-seed in the NCAA tourney,
as well as placing her on the Pacif
ic 10 First Team, among the best
individual golfers in the nation.
She was an Academic All-Ameri
can as well as honorable mention
Ail-American last year, which she
will equal or surpass this year.
"Audrey is extremely self-moti
vated and manages her time very
well," said women's coach Tim
Baldwin. "A coach wants five
Audreys."
Although golf keeps her on the
run, Wooding stressed that,"it's
really helped shape the person
that I am .... You face a lot of
challenges on your own in golf.
You learn how to deal on your
own, to get through the pressure
times and how to still have fun,"
which all help Wooding in life off
the golf course.

In the regular tournaments in
which Stanford plays, the compe
tition involves three 18-hole
rounds of golf, played in three
days, or two, with two rounds in
one day. The rounds take from
four to five hours, belying the
relaxing, simple image golf has
acquired.
Lugging clubs around the
course, not to mention dealing
with the hills and the heat, can
wear down even the most mental
ly tough athlete. And with so
many different opportunities to
make good, or bad shots, the need
for focus and levelheadedness are
crucial.

You see someone
hit a a bad shot,
and you know they
just want to whale
that club and throw
it like a helicopter.'
— Audrey Wooding

"Golf is different in that
respect," Wooding explained.
"You have so much time to think
about each shot. My friends ask
me how you keep from getting
totally nervous with so much time
to think. You really have to learn
to control your nervousness ...
and frustration. You see someone
hit a a bad shot, and you know
they just want to whale that club
and throw it like a helicopter."
Wooding emphasizes the need
to have fun in tournaments, even
under pressure, which leads to
descriptions of endless practical
jokes played after tournaments.
One instance involved hiding an
innocent octopus in the beds of
her teammates during a tour of
Asia last summer.
"Sometimes (Coach Baldwin)
comes up to me and says 'Audrey,
you've got to stop having so much
fun out there' ... because I'll be
laughing up a storm on the golf

Senior Audrey Wooding has quite a handle on her golf game. The mechanical engi
neering major has laughed and joked her way to the top of the collegiate golfing world
and had a good time doing it. She and the rest of the Stanford women's golf team will
travel to Arizona for the NCAA Championships in two weeks.
course," joked Wooding. "We
usually fill the time between
rounds playing practical jokes or
goofing around, because when
you finish you're mentally
exhausted . . . your brain is
fried."
"She's a very lively person
with a really quick and sharp per
sonality," Baldwin said. "Audrey
is a no-nonsense girl that does a
lot of nonsense."
Doing well also makes playing
fun, and Wooding has done plen
ty of that, finishing second indi
vidually in the Pac-10 Champi
onships and second in the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate held last
week on the Stanford course.
"If I'm in a troubled situation
and I find a shot I want to exe
cute, and I execute it, that's when
it's fun," said Wooding. She
explains that golf is not necessar
ily about perfection.
"You don't always have to play
well to win, but just manage your
mistakes. It's not always good
shots after good shots. Everybody
will make mistakes."
Wooding combats all the diffi
culties encountered on the golf
course with a good attitude, a
sense of humor, and a true love
for the sport, which have com
bined to make her one of the best
golfers in the nation. Wooding
insists she wouldn't change a
thing about her Stanford career,
and that the time spent on the
golf course helps her deal with
academics and life on the Farm.
"I do enjoy the solitude of the
game," Wooding said. "Going out
in the evening, when the sun's
going down and the shadows are
long. That relaxation time when
you're by yourself, it's so beauti
ful out there."
Alternating between the driv

ing range and the classroom,
Wooding has learned to keep
everything in perspective, realiz
ing that there are not enough
hours in the day to do all the
studying and golfing that she'd
like to do.
"Finally this last year I decid
ed when I'm at a tournament
that my first priority is golf, and I
can only do so much work,"
Wooding said.
"Sometimes I reward myself
by going to bed before midnight,
or only studying two hours on
one day .... I think people can
vouch for the fact that I can get
stressed."
But underneath all the work,
Wooding jokes that there is a
time when she has to kick back,
and watch Saturday Night Live,
for example.
"There are times when you
have to let your brain just kind of
be," Wooding mused ironically.
"Just be. ... I'm just being. All
the people in my dorm who say
I'm so stressed would just laugh
if they heard that. They'd say
'Just Be?"'
With only one more quarter to
go at Stanford, Wooding will be
taking time out next year to go
pro, competing on mini-tours and
in Europe.
Next summer she hopes to
qualify for the LPGA tour, inten
sifying her golf without scholas
tic pressures.
Heading toward NCAAs in two
weeks, Wooding will golf her final
collegiate rounds on the Karsten
Golf Course.
She jokes that it will not make
her "a changed woman", and that
her last home tournament at
Stanford was more nostalgic for
her.
After a commendable career,
Wooding now will try to put all
her experience into an All-Ameri
can finish, hoping to gain a top
ten spot individually, and "just
be."

In the regular tournaments in
which Stanford plays, the compe
tition involves three 18-hole
rounds of golf, played in three
days, or two, with two rounds in
one day. The rounds take from
four to five hours, belying the
relaxing, simple image golf has
acquired.
Lugging clubs around the
course, not to mention dealing
with the hills and the heat, can
wear down even the most mental
ly tough athlete. And with so
many different opportunities to
make good, or bad shots, the need
for focus and levelheadedness are
crucial.

You see someone
hit a a bad shot,
and you know they
just want to whale
that club and throw
it like a helicopter.'
— Audrey Wooding

"Golf is different in that
respect," Wooding explained.
"You have so much time to think
about each shot. My friends ask
me how you keep from getting
totally nervous with so much time
to think. You really have to learn
to control your nervousness ...
and frustration. You see someone
hit a a bad shot, and you know
they just want to whale that club
and throw it like a helicopter."
Wooding emphasizes the need
to have fun in tournaments, even
under pressure, which leads to
descriptions of endless practical
jokes played after tournaments.
One instance involved hiding an
innocent octopus in the beds of
her teammates during a tour of
Asia last summer.

Senior Audrey Wooding has quite a handle on her golf game. The mechanical engi
neering major has laughed and joked her way to the top of the collegiate golfing world
and had a good time doing it. She and the rest of the Stanford women's golf team will
travel to Arizona for the NCAA Championships in two weeks.
course," joked Wooding. "We
usually fill the time between
rounds playing practical jokes or
goofing around, because when
you finish you're mentally
exhausted . . . your brain is
fried."
"She's a very lively person
with a really quick and sharp per
sonality," Baldwin said. "Audrey
is a no-nonsense girl that does a
lot of nonsense."
Doing well also makes playing
fun, and Wooding has done plen
ty of that, finishing second indi
vidually in the Pac-10 Champi
onships and second in the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate held last
week on the Stanford course.
"If I'm in a troubled situation
and I find a shot I want to exe
cute, and I execute it, that's when
it's fun," said Wooding. She
explains that golf is not necessar
ily about perfection.
"You don't always have to play
well to win, but just manage your
mistakes. It's not always good
shots after good shots. Everybody
will make mistakes."
Wooding combats all the diffi
culties encountered on the golf
course with a good attitude, a
sense of humor, and a true love
for the sport, which have com
bined to make her one of the best
golfers in the nation. Wooding
insists she wouldn't change a
thing about her Stanford career,
and that the time spent on the
golf course helps her deal with
academics and life on the Farm.
"I do enjoy the solitude of the
game," Wooding said. "Going out
in the evening, when the sun's
going down and the shadows are
long. That relaxation time when
you're by yourself, it's so beauti
ful out there."
Alternating between the driv

ing range and the classroom,
Wooding has learned to keep
everything in perspective, realiz
ing that there are not enough
hours in the day to do all the
studying and golfing that she'd
like to do.
"Finally this last year I decid
ed when I'm at a tournament
that my first priority is golf, and I
can only do so much work,"
Wooding said.
"Sometimes I reward myself
by going to bed before midnight,
or only studying two hours on
one day .... I think people can
vouch for the fact that I can get
stressed."
But underneath all the work,
Wooding jokes that there is a
time when she has to kick back,
and watch Saturday Night Live,
for example.
"There are times when you
have to let your brain just kind of
be," Wooding mused ironically.
"Just be. ... I'm just being. All
the people in my dorm who say
I'm so stressed would just laugh
if they heard that. They'd say
'Just Be?"'
With only one more quarter to
go at Stanford, Wooding will be
taking time out next year to go
pro, competing on mini-tours and
in Europe.
Next summer she hopes to
qualify for the LPGA tour, inten
sifying her golf without scholas
tic pressures.
Heading toward NCAAs in two
weeks, Wooding will golf her final
collegiate rounds on the Karsten
Golf Course.
She jokes that it will not make
her "a changed woman", and that
her last home tournament at
Stanford was more nostalgic for
her.
After a commendable career,
Wooding now will try to put all
her experience into an All-Ameri
can finish, hoping to gain a top
ten spot individually, and "just
be."
Balancing over 10 five-day golf
tournaments each year with a
mechanical engineering major is
not something for the faint of
heart, but Audrey Wooding is
managing her schedule in grand
fashion.
"Stressed? Oh gosh . .. you can
tell?!" Wooding laughed. "I try
not to be too regimented. Well, for
instance, Friday and Saturday
night I did absolutely no work. I
watched Saturday Night Live last
night. . .just vegetating."
Friday and Saturday nights
off? Throw caution to the wind.
But Wooding's somewhat strict
agenda is understandable, consid
ering she spends three to five
hours a day on the golf course
during the spring, the busiest sea
son for the Stanford golfers.
In-between weekly problem
sets, Wooding leaves the Farm
with the team, travelling to such
places as Hawaii, Arizona and
Monterrey for tournaments. Soon
the Cardinal will head back to Ari
zona for the NCAA Champi
onship tournament, Wooding's
last competitive college tourna
ment.
Wooding has been the Cardi
nal's consistent leader this sea
son, contributing to Stanford's
fourth-seed in the NCAA tourney,
as well as placing her on the Pacif
ic 10 First Team, among the best
individual golfers in the nation.
She was an Academic All-Ameri
can as well as honorable mention
Ail-American last year, which she
will equal or surpass this year.
"Audrey is extremely self-moti
vated and manages her time very
well," said women's coach Tim
Baldwin. "A coach wants five
Audreys."
Although golf keeps her on the
run, Wooding stressed that,"it's
really helped shape the person
that I am .... You face a lot of
challenges on your own in golf.
You learn how to deal on your
own, to get through the pressure
times and how to still have fun,"
