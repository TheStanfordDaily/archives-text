# Cal talks the talk, Stanford walks the walk
## 
### 
In this crazy, do-or-die baseball sea
son, there is at least one thing that
the Stanford community can take
stock in as a given:
People from California are not all
that intelligent.

That's as in D-U-M, otherwise
known as not smart, but dumb. What
other conclusion could one draw after
being present on the grassy slope
known as Sunken Diamond's student
section last Saturday? One thing that
anyone connected to the rivalry of

Cardinal vs. Bear knows is that noth
ing is ever certain, yet with Cal up 9-7
early in the game, one Berkeley brain
surgeon stood up in an attempt to
rally some golden pride.
Dummy.
To borrow an analogy from Stan
ford track coach Brooks Johnson,
when people come to visit, you don't
let them crap in your living room.
Appropriately enough, the Cardinal
faithful were not about to take any of
this guy's, uh, stuff.
Drowning out his lame attempt at
school spirit, Stanford supporters
shouted cat-calls and insults appropri
ate for the moment. The mental
midget quickly sat down, and the Card
Nine began to take control. Not anoth
er peep was heard as the Stanford bats
came alive to carve out what would
become a 22-10 victory for the home
team. The convincing win helped give
Stanford the confidence to come from
behind the next day and complete a
crucial three-game sweep.

Knowing that last weekend could have
been the last of the season, Stanford
came ready to play and answered
everything that Cal threw at them.

While the Cardinal is now atop the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Divi
sion at 17-13, Cal rests firmly in fifth
with a 14-16 league mark.
Stupid, dumb ol' Bears.
This year's Six-Pac race is close
enough that Cal came into the the
weekend series with hopes of captur
ing first place and the automatic
NCAA bid that comes along with it.
Their only hope now is an at-large bid,
but tradition has it that only four Six-
Pac teams will make it to the postsea
son, and even a Cal student can figure

out that No. 5 is not in the top four.
Thanks for coming Bears ....
The flip-side, of course, is that
Mark Marquess and his boys
look awfully smart these days,
in both style and substance. Knowing
that last weekend could have been the
last of the season, Stanford came
ready to play and answered everything
that Cal threw at them. When the Car
dinal needed pitching, the pitching was
there. When the bats needed to come
