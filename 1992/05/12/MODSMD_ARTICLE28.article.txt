# Cal talks the talk, Stanford walks the walk
## 
### 
In this crazy, do-or-die baseball sea
son, there is at least one thing that
the Stanford community can take
stock in as a given:
People from California are not all
that intelligent.

That's as in D-U-M, otherwise
known as not smart, but dumb. What
other conclusion could one draw after
being present on the grassy slope
known as Sunken Diamond's student
section last Saturday? One thing that
anyone connected to the rivalry of

Cardinal vs. Bear knows is that noth
ing is ever certain, yet with Cal up 9-7
early in the game, one Berkeley brain
surgeon stood up in an attempt to
rally some golden pride.
Dummy.
To borrow an analogy from Stan
ford track coach Brooks Johnson,
when people come to visit, you don't
let them crap in your living room.
Appropriately enough, the Cardinal
faithful were not about to take any of
this guy's, uh, stuff.
Drowning out his lame attempt at
school spirit, Stanford supporters
shouted cat-calls and insults appropri
ate for the moment. The mental
midget quickly sat down, and the Card
Nine began to take control. Not anoth
er peep was heard as the Stanford bats
came alive to carve out what would
become a 22-10 victory for the home
team. The convincing win helped give
Stanford the confidence to come from
behind the next day and complete a
crucial three-game sweep.

Knowing that last weekend could have
been the last of the season, Stanford
came ready to play and answered
everything that Cal threw at them.

While the Cardinal is now atop the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Divi
sion at 17-13, Cal rests firmly in fifth
with a 14-16 league mark.
Stupid, dumb ol' Bears.
This year's Six-Pac race is close
enough that Cal came into the the
weekend series with hopes of captur
ing first place and the automatic
NCAA bid that comes along with it.
Their only hope now is an at-large bid,
but tradition has it that only four Six-
Pac teams will make it to the postsea
son, and even a Cal student can figure

out that No. 5 is not in the top four.
Thanks for coming Bears ....
The flip-side, of course, is that
Mark Marquess and his boys
look awfully smart these days,
in both style and substance. Knowing
that last weekend could have been the
last of the season, Stanford came
ready to play and answered everything
that Cal threw at them. When the Car
dinal needed pitching, the pitching was
there. When the bats needed to come

alive, they did.
It was a series when everybody
— superstars, scrubs, and also
rans — competed at the best of
their ability and helped put on a
show that makes an NCAA title
look more realistic than it has all
season.
This can be said, primarily,
because of the show the Cardinal
bench has put on in the last week.
Consider the heroics of one Steve
Worrell. Reduced to an almost
non-existent role due to elbow
problems over the last three years,
Worrell came out of nowhere to
pitch the final 3.2 innings against
Cal State—Sacramento and nail
down a 5-4 victory, his first in two
years.
The hard throwing southpaw
then secured the sweep of Cal
Sunday by facing the heart of the
Bear line-up in the bottom of the
ninth with two on and no outs,
and then calmly inducing three

Pop-ups for his first save in three
years.
Marquess' fancy managerial
maneuvering brought out the new
along with the old. Like Worrell,
Todd Laßocca had spent most of
this season watching the game.
The talented freshman then got
his first start a week ago and
promptly hit the game winner
against the Hornets. Smart
enough to stick with a good thing,
Marquess kept the kid in the line
up and the shortstop continued to
shine. Looking back over his last
four games, Laßocca is hitting a
cool .571 (8-for-14) with six RBI
and the first home run of his
young Stanford career.
To be sure, the list of heroics
could continue, but the only acco
lade that truly matters belongs to
the whole rather than its parts.
Unlike a certain Bear fan, the Car
dinal was smart enough to know
that talking is best done on the field.
And they have a sweep to prove
it.
