# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
This week's winners are definitely dyna
mite. T and T, actually (pardon the pun).
Tracy Timms and Tony Detter have been
blasting away at their opponents recently —
both have had a big part in their teams' suc
cesses of late. Each has contributed explo
sively on offense to bring victory to the Car
dinal, and we want to recognize those
achievements. Timms of the Stanford
women's cycling team and Detter of the

Pacific 10 Southern Division-leading Stan
ford baseball team are our Athletes of the
Week.
Timms should have been recognized last
week. Her astounding performance actually
came at the West Coast Collegiate Cycling
Championships in Davis, Calif., May 2 and 3,
but we weren't able to give her an award
then. She led the women's team and the
whole cycling team to a third-place finish in
the conference championships with nothing
short of dominant cycling. Individually, she
was the overall individual point leader and
received the coveted Omnium jersey.
Timms raced for the women's team first in
the Team Trial, helping the cyclers to a sec
ond-place finish and beating the next team by
an amazing one minute.
She finished second again in the criterium
on the strength of a powerful breakaway
(with blocking help from her teammates)
which left the rest of the field behind. In the
final race, the grueling road race, she out
sprinted an opponent to the finish line to
come in third.

Detter was the hottest man on a very hot
team this weekend. As the Stanford baseball
team got sweet revenge (and a playoff berth)
by sweeping a three-game series with Cali
fornia, Detter swung the bat with abandon,
garnering eight hits in 12 at-bats, including
going 4-for-5 in Saturday's 22-10 massacre.
He was unstoppable.

To say he did it all this weekend would be
an understatement — he also drove in seven
RBI and scored six runs himself (with one
homer). Throughout the Cardinal's slugfest
series, Detter stood out among the stars.
"[Detter's performance] was real huge,"
said coach Mark Marquess.
Now the baseball team is virtually assured
a postseason spot, thanks in large part to
Detter's contributions.
