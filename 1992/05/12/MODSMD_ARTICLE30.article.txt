# Ultimate season ends in heartrending upset
## 
### Wes Williams 
"It was the best of times, it
was the worst of times." Except
for the part about it being the
best of times, Charles Dickens'
words ring all too true for the
members of the Stanford Men's
Ultimate Team (SMUT).
The first SMUT team, known
affectionately as Team Blood, went
to the Western Collegiate Region
al full of sound and fury. Going
into this weekend's competition,
the Blood was ranked No. 1 nation
ally, sporting a lusty 21-0 record.
"It was as if we were the most
delicious cake. Everybody wanted
a piece of us," said freshman Terry
Cussen.
Unfortunately for Team
Blood, three teams had their cake
and ate it, too, this weekend. The
first SMUT loss came in a flukey,
wind-dominated game against
Santa Barbara. Playing in 40
mile-per-hour gusts, neither
team managed to score upwind,
and the game was effectively won
on the pregame coin toss.
Despite the first-day upset,
Team Blood finished first in its
pool. In semi-finals the next day,
SMUT manhandled the number
four seed, Cal Poly-San Luis

Obispo, 15-5.
Next they faced Oregon.
The only other undefeated
team going into the tournament,
the second-seeded Ducks proved
to be formidable opposition for the
Blood in the championship game.
"Oregon was the finely-honed
killing machine we had anticipat
ed," described Ed Donovan.
The Ducks went up 5-1, shock
ing the snoozing Stanford team.
The Blood struggled to its feet
and brought the game to 8-7
before Oregon closed out the first
half at 9-7. After the half, the
Ducks pulled away, winning the
game 17-13, clinching the first of
two berths to nationals.
Stanford then faced Califor
nia, the winner of the losers'
bracket, in the fined match of the
tournament. The winner of the
game would gain the remaining
nationals berth.
"We were coming off our first
real loss of the season, and Cal
was still heady with the excite
ment of winning three in a row,"
said co-captain Allan Padgett.
A stunned Team Blood lost the
game 9-11, and the top-ranked
team in collegiate ultimate ended
its season and will not compete in
nationals this year.
