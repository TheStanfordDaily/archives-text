# Engineering efficiency for tomorrow's cars

Answering a challenge from
Ford Motor Company to build
the best hybrid electric car, a
group of Stanford students is
working on a new design that
could change the the way Amer
icans transport themselves.
In September, Ford announced
a competition that called for uni
versity students throughout
North America to develop attrac
tive, feasible and efficient hybrid
cars.
About 100 Stanford students,
mostly undergraduate engi
neers, are already working on
their version. SHARP — the
Stanford Hybrid Automobile
Research Project — will convert
a standard 1992 Ford Escort sta
tion wagon into a hybrid-pow
ered machine that runs on both
electricity and gas.
Junior Joel Miller, coordina
tor of the Stanford project, said
SHARP'S goal is to have a drive
able car by the end of the calen
dar year — producing a hybrid
that will look, feel and drive just
like a Ford Escort, but run as
quietly as a bicycle.
Ford donated the car, but
almost all of its working parts
have to come out, said sopho
more Amanda Svensson,
SHARP's fund-raising coordina

tor. The group started stripping
the car last Sunday, she said.
Converting the car will cost
about $200,000. SHARP has to
come up with its own supplies to

rebuild the car, but much of the
equipment is not available on
the market. Those parts will be
custom-built by the students
and put in over the year.

SHARP is depending on dona
tions from companies and dormi
tories to supply all the funds.

This standard 1992 Ford Escort will soon be converted into a hybrid-electric car that runs on both elec
tricity and gasoline. The redesign will be engineered by junior Joel Miller and other undergraduates.
By December, the inside of the
car will be transformed, but the
outside will look exactly like the
old Escort.
In June 1993, the team will
display its model in Detroit. It will
be tested and judged on a list of
performance items such as range,
noise, stability, acceleration, cost
and design. Ford is offering total
prizes of $75,000.
But Miller, a mechanical engi
neering major, said money is not
the reason most students are
involved in the project. Most sim
ply want to be a part of something
that could have a significant
impact, on the auto world and the
environment, he said.
Doug Stukenbork, a Ford
spokesperson, said the primary goal
of the contest is college relations.
"Hopefully this will help us

recruit, to get some top talent," he
said. "But it's obviously a signifi
cant piece of transportation histo
ry. We're bringing students to the
forefront with us."
Hybrid electric cars may soon
replace gas-powered vehicles as a
realistic option until electric cars
are feasible.
Electric cars best meet the
growing demand for quieter, clean
er-burning cars that don't use up
natural resources. But to meet the
standards of gas-powered cars in
distance, acceleration and perfor
mance, the electric car would take
10,000 pounds of batteries.
The hybrid vehicle will require
only 800 pounds of batteries.
Whether gasoline or batteries
power the hybrid's motor, the
wires still send out electric power
to turn the wheels. So, hybrid mod
els have just as much acceleration
and speed as standard gas engines.
A hybrid car is the first step
toward the car of the future.
For trips of less than 60 miles,

a battery powers the electric
motor.
On a longer trip, the gas engine
produces electricity which powers
the electric motor.
After returning home, a stan
dard wall outlet will recharge the
battery and the*car will be ready
to drive again in about six hours.
The hybrid car is easier on the
environment than regular gas
engines. It causes no pollution
unless it uses the gas engine for
longer trips. Since more than 80
percent of all automobile trips are
under 60 miles, most driving will
be pollution-free.
Even on longer trips, the gas
engine runs more efficiently and
causes less pollution than a stan
dard gas engine.
All engines have a certain peak
level of efficiency. Regular motors
are less efficient in the city — when
cars start and stop frequently —
because the speed of the motor is
changing constantly.
The gas engine in SHARP'S vehi

cle can be held at its peak speed even
if the car is changing speed, because
the batteries can compensate for
power changes that are needed.
The hybrid is cost-efficient as
well. Electricity is simply much
cheaper than gasoline. A 15-mile
trip in a hybrid car would cost
about two cents per mile and
cause no pollution, while a gaso
line-powered car, for the same
trip, would cost three times as
much and send about 40 grams of
pollutants into the atmosphere.
For a 200-mile trip, gas cars
cost two times as much and pro
duce twice the pollution.
Stukenbork said Ford must
figure out how to mass-produce
low-emission cars, and fast. By
1998, manufacturers in Califor
nia will be required by law to
make two percent of all the vehi
cles they produce pollution-free.
The most promising solution
to that problem — the electric car
— will not be viable soon enough,
Stukenbork said.
