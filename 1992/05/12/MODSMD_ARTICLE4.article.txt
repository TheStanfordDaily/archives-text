# Engineering efficiency for tomorrow's cars

Answering a challenge from
Ford Motor Company to build
the best hybrid electric car, a
group of Stanford students is
working on a new design that
could change the the way Amer
icans transport themselves.
In September, Ford announced
a competition that called for uni
versity students throughout
North America to develop attrac
tive, feasible and efficient hybrid
cars.
About 100 Stanford students,
mostly undergraduate engi
neers, are already working on
their version. SHARP — the
Stanford Hybrid Automobile
Research Project — will convert
a standard 1992 Ford Escort sta
tion wagon into a hybrid-pow
ered machine that runs on both
electricity and gas.
Junior Joel Miller, coordina
tor of the Stanford project, said
SHARP'S goal is to have a drive
able car by the end of the calen
dar year — producing a hybrid
that will look, feel and drive just
like a Ford Escort, but run as
quietly as a bicycle.
Ford donated the car, but
almost all of its working parts
have to come out, said sopho
more Amanda Svensson,
SHARP's fund-raising coordina

tor. The group started stripping
the car last Sunday, she said.
Converting the car will cost
about $200,000. SHARP has to
come up with its own supplies to

rebuild the car, but much of the
equipment is not available on
the market. Those parts will be
custom-built by the students
and put in over the year.

SHARP is depending on dona
tions from companies and dormi
tories to supply all the funds.

This standard 1992 Ford Escort will soon be converted into a hybrid-electric car that runs on both elec
tricity and gasoline. The redesign will be engineered by junior Joel Miller and other undergraduates.
