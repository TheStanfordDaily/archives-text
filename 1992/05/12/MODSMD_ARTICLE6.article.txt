# Students mobilizing on abortion question
## Issue will influence election, Republican convention, profs say 
### Sara Skinner Staff writer 
Stanford political scientists
predict that a case on abortion
currently before the Supreme
Court will have a major effect on
the presidential election, and
campus groups are gearing up to
influence the case's outcome.
Casey vs. Planned Parenthood
of Southeastern Pennsylvania
tests a state law that puts new
restrictions on the 1973 Roe vs.
Wade abortion ruling. The law
orders minors to get parental con
sent, requires wives to inform
their husbands and imposes a
mandatory 24-hour waiting peri
od for abortions.
A lower federal court upheld
all of the law's provisions except
the spousal notification require
ment. However, in its decision,
the court ruled that abortion is no
longer a fundamental right, indi
cating that state legislatures can
create even steeper obstacles to
abortion as long as they have "leg
islative rationale."
By deciding to review the case
this spring, the Supreme Court
will certainly influence this year's

election, according to Political
Science Prof. Richard Brody.
"It's going to be an important
burden for the Republican Party,
because there's nothing else of
interest at the convention what
soever," Brody said.
Since the Republican candi
dates for president and vice presi
dent are already assumed to be
Bush and Quayle, the "only issue
the public could conceivably be
interested in is abortion," Brody
said. Since the media will cover
the convention, it "will try to
inject some drama into the
event,"he added.
The Republican Party's long
term strength depends on young
voters, whose votes will be heavi
ly influenced by the stand the
party takes on abortion, Brody
said.
He said the Republican Party
had "been gaining strength
among younger Americans" in
the last ten years. That surge has
stopped because of the abortion
issue and the nation's economic
problems, he added.
"The future of the Republican
Party as the majority party at the
popular level depends on their
ability to convince young people,
18 to 25, that they have a flexible
stand on reproductive rights, a
stand these people can feel com
fortable with," Brody said.
Consequently, abortion rights
groups are calling for the
Supreme Court to hand down a
decision before election day in
order to galvanize pro-choice citi
zens for the elections.
Kim Yang, a member of the
Stanford chapter of the National
Women's Political Caucus, said
the case "is really making people
pay more attention to the '92 elec
tions. Abortion rights have
become a bottom-line issue for
many voters, and people are
crossing party lines to vote for the
pro-choice candidate."
Because of the influence the
case will have on elections, the
court is unlikely to use it to over
turn Roe vs. Wade, according to

Brody. Instead, the court will
probably take a "position giving
states power" to decide laws based
on local needs, much like the law
proposed in Pennsylvania, he said.
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall agreed. "If I were a good
Reagan or Bush appointee, I
wouldn't want to embarrass
Bush," he said.
"The presence of this issue is
going to make life tougher for
George Bush than it would nor
mally be," Brody said.
Brody, whose area of expertise
includes citizen politics and public
opinion studies, said "the domi
nant position among Americans is
support for reproductive rights
with some limitations."
This majority is largely silent,
he said, because "in America most
majorities are silent. Not many
Americans participate in active
politics."
Freshman Shana Yansen of the
Pro-Choice Alliance said she
doesn't believe the Supreme Court
will overturn Roe vs. Wade because
"if it's blatantly overturned then
there will be a strong movement [to
get] people mobilized."

"If it's severely eroded, it's
more subtle," she said. "It
decreases the effect on the Ameri
can public."
Marshall said he also expects
the court to decide the case on the
"least important grounds" in order
to leave flexibility for future cases.
Activism on campus
The Women's Center is home
to both the Pro-Choice Alliance
and the Stanford chapter of the
National Women's Political Cau
cus, which is also pro-choice,
according to Women's Center
Director Quynh Tran.
The pro-life movement on cam
pus does not appear to be as orga
nized. According to the Office of
Student Activities, Stanford Stu
dents for Life, a registered group
in previous years, is now inactive,
and no other groups on campus
deal specifically with protecting
abortion rights.
Brooke Butler, campus direc
tor for Campus Crusade for
Christ, said that in the past, stu
dents were involved with local
"rescues" sponsored by Operation
Rescue. However, after that
group went bankrupt and reorga
nized to focus on highly publi
cized media events, smaller res
cues at the local level stopped.
According to Butler, Campus
Crusade discusses abortion in its
dorm panels. "That's one of the
main issues raised," he said. "We
try to give a Christian perspec
tive."
Individual students also write
pro-life letters to congressmen,
Butler said.
The Pro-Choice Alliance has
seen "new faces at every meeting"
this quarter, said Yansen. "People
have been very enthusiastic."
The groups have been
"tabling" in Palo Alto and White
Plaza, selling t-shirts and buttons
and passing out flyers encourag
ing people to write letters.

"What we like to do, actually, is
send letters about the gag rule to
senators," she said, adding that
"periodically, we try to write let
ters to The Daily."
Group members also attended
the San Francisco and Washing
ton, D.C. Marches for Women's
Lives and have sponsored speak
ers about choice and women in
western medicine on campus.
They have also planned a "Choice
Night" featuring Norma McCor
vey, or Jane Roe from Roe vs.
Wade.
The Stanford chapter of the
National Women's Political Cau
cus only supports candidates who
are pro-choice, said Yang, because
the group's platform requires
that they be pro-choice, pro-ERA
and support child care.
Students have become
involved by "walking precincts"
for Anna Eshoo, a pro-choice can
didate, and by working at cam
paign headquarters. They are also
bringing Barbara Boxer to speak
on campus Friday.
