# Students mobilizing on abortion question
## Issue will influence election, Republican convention, profs say

Stanford political scientists
predict that a case on abortion
currently before the Supreme
Court will have a major effect on
the presidential election, and
campus groups are gearing up to
influence the case's outcome.
Casey vs. Planned Parenthood
of Southeastern Pennsylvania
tests a state law that puts new
restrictions on the 1973 Roe vs.
Wade abortion ruling. The law
orders minors to get parental con

Since the Republican candi
dates for president and vice presi
dent are already assumed to be
Bush and Quayle, the "only issue

term strength depends on young
voters, whose votes will be heavi
ly influenced by the stand the
party takes on abortion, Brody
said.
He said the Republican Party
had "been gaining strength
among younger Americans" in
the last ten years. That surge has
stopped because of the abortion
issue and the nation's economic
problems, he added.
