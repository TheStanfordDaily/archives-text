# Janitors call for better conditions
## 
### Luis Orona 
Nine Stanford janitors and four union represen
tatives marched into University President Donald
Kennedy's office yesterday afternoon, asking to
meet with Kennedy to discuss what they say are low
wages and lack of benefits.
The nine workers, who spoke only Spanish, wait
ed quietly until Kennedy stepped out of his office
and was asked for an appointment by union repre
sentative and organizer Ellen Starbird.
"This is the first I've heard of this," Kennedy
said. "Send me a memo and I'll get back to you." He
then walked into a conference room while the jani
tors continued to wait.
The nine present represented the 96 Stanford
janitors in the Service Employees International
Union hired through ACME Janitorial Services to
clean academic and office areas, according to Opera
tions and Maintenance Manager Herbert Fong. All
but two of the 96 are Latino.
The union had reached an impasse in negotia
tions with ACME and wanted Kennedy and the Uni
versity to pressure ACME negotiators to offer a bet
ter contract, Starbird said.
But Kennedy said the union and its negotiations
are not the University's responsibility. "Their bar
gaining rights are with their contracting company,"
he said.
The union's demands include a 10 percent wage
increase and company-paid health insurance for all
janitors.
ACME has proposed a wage freeze for three years
and offers no health insurance benefits, according to
Starbird.
Union President Mike Garcia said two-thirds of
the janitors now pay $70 for health insurance, while
the other third has none. The majority of them are

paid between $5.80 and $7.44 per hour.
Janitors doing the same type of work hired direct
ly by the University make between $9.94 and $12.94
an hour, according to Michael Tathe, a representa
tive of United Stanford Workers.
According to Fong, the University hires night jan
itors through ACME and day janitors through Unit
ed Stanford Workers.
Tathe said the University hires through contrac
tors so "they can pay people of color substandard
wages."
"You can't pretend these people don't work for
Stanford," Starbird said. "It's your bathrooms they
clean and your carpets they vacuum. They're Stan
ford workers."
When Kennedy came out of his conference, the
janitors asked to have a meeting by Friday.
"I don't take deadlines," Kennedy said. "I've
made a commitment to get back to you on this. Now
it's time for this meeting to end."
He then escorted the group out of his office, say
ing his staff would contact the workers by Friday
and he would agree to meet with them once he had
more information on the subject.
Kennedy said he had not heard the janitors' com
plaints before yesterday. However, Starbird said she
and the union have been in contact with Fong since
February and that she had Bent Kennedy a memo
and a fax concerning the issue.
The janitors said they will wait until Friday for
Kennedy to schedule a meeting and, if a meeting is
not set, they will be back in Kennedy's office next
week.
MEChA, the Chicano/Latino student organiza
tion, voted unanimously yesterday to support the
janitors but will not act until they become more
informed, according to Tony Gonzalez, head of the
MEChA fact-finding committee.
