# Ricks to leave for Boston non-profit
## Educator worked to build community 
### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
Greg Ricks, Stanford's first
multicultural educator, an
nounced yesterday that he will
leave the University June 30 to
become Vice President for Edu
cation and Training at City
Year, a non-profit "urban
peace corps" in Boston.
During his three years on
campus, Ricks has worked with

Residential
Education and
the Dean of
Students
Office to build
a more plural
istic Stanford
community.
He has focused
on developing
residence-

based programs to foster critical
thinking and honest discussions
about ethnicity and culture.
"We will miss Greg a great
deal," said Dean of Students
Michael Jackson. "He has
inspired us with his energy, his
love of educating students and
getting them to learn from one
another."
Ricks said that although he
has made advances at Stanford
over the last three years, there
is still much to do.
"When I first came to Stan
ford, I spent long hours listen
ing to students, trying to hear
and feel where they were," he
said. "It was a very polarized

community. . . . Students of
color thought that multicultur
alism was diluting their efforts
to build strong individual com
munities of color, and white
students felt it was not con
necting them."
One of the biggest problems
is students' "zero-sum analy
sis" of multiculturalism, Ricks
said.
"People think that by mak
ing one community strong, you
have to make another weak.
That's not necessarily true.
This is what I mean by 'zero
sum analysis,' and this is what
I've worked to change."
Asst. Dean of Students
Keith Archuleta called Ricks'
departure "a tremendous loss
for the community."
"Greg has done a lot to
define the position (of multi
cultural educator)," Archuleta
said. "When he first came, it
was like trying to put meat on a
skeleton. He concretized a lot
of nebulous ideas in terms of
the position."
A search for Ricks' succes
sor will begin this summer,
according to Ann Porteus,
associate director of Res Ed. It
will likely be open to people
from both within and outside
the University, Jackson said.
Ricks said that although he
probably will not be involved in
the search, he is writing a report
on his experiences. "I hope the


Ricks
search won't begin until the fall, so
students can be involved," he
added.
Stanford students, Ricks said,
are "incredibly receptive, espe
cially when I would meet them on
their own ground. The students
are the leaders on this campus."
Wendy Lack, a sophomore who
has worked closely with Ricks as
the coordinator of Students
Speaking About Race and Cul
ture, said she will remember "the
privilege of watching [Ricks]
empower and inspire almost every
student that crosses his path."
Tina Hua, chair of the Asian
American Students Association,
called Ricks a "super person."
"He's very fair at listening to
people's opinions and leading dis
cussion in a way so that everyone
can express their feelings," Hua
said. "I don't think that he's
replaceable. I'm very sad to see

him go."
Ricks described his position as
"lonely in many ways. It's often
the best of times and the worst of
times."

( I think a lot of stu
dents believed me,
but they did not
believe that I spoke
for the institution.
That was frustrat
ing.'
—Greg Ricks

"I think a lot of students
believed me, but they did not
believe that I spoke for the insti
tution. That was frustrating,
because I do think that the Dean
of Students Office and Res Ed
believe" in multiculturalism, he

said.
Ricks said he has "mixed feel
ings" about leaving Stanford, but
is excited to return to Boston,
where he grew up and has family.
"At City Year, I will be working
with students at risk. Some of
these kids might die. No one at
Stanford is at risk. . . . This
should give balance to my life," he
said.
City Year is a non-profit volun
teer service program in which
teenagers and young adults of dif
ferent races and socioeconomic
backgrounds form an "urban
peace corps" by devoting a year to
helping people in their communi
ties.
In addition to working at City
Year, Ricks is finishing a book
titled "College is not the 13th
Grade" and will be teaching a
course on multicultural leader
ship at Harvard.
Ricks' move to City Year is a
continuation of his efforts to
make public service a focal point

ty on campus.
"The building of community
through multicultural interaction
around community service and

other leadership
opportunities on
the part of stu
dents has been
very gratifying,"
Ricks said.
Tim Stanton,
acting director of
the Haas Center
for Public Service,
expressed regret
at Ricks' depar
ture. "We have
seen the fruits of
Greg's labors in
the way in which
he has gotten so
many people to
work together in a
constructive and
committed way on
important issues,"
Stanton said.

"The Haas Center community
is more multicultural as a result
of the work Greg has done in con
necting students from so many
different backgrounds to its pro
grams," Stanton added.
Nevertheless, there is still much
for the new multicultural educator
to work on, according to Ricks.
"We must look at the diversity

the diversity

the monoliths of
"white," "black"
and "Asian."
Group identity
must not obscure
individuals.'

within our groups and break
down the monoliths of 'white,'
'black' and 'Asian.' Group identi
ty must not obscure individuals,"
he said. "We must move from the
political to the personal."
Ricks also sees an inability
among members of the Stanford
community to recognize the
"interconnectedness of all forms
of oppression."
"People fight
one form of
oppression like
racism or homo
phobia while
ignoring others
like classism or
women's oppres
sion," he said.
Ricks said he
hopes that in the
future, Stan
ford's graduate
schools will
"begin to set
concrete goals
and take an
active part in
becoming part of
the pipeline" for
women and
minority doctor-

al students.
But Ricks said he has been
gratified by the increased aware
ness of multicultural issues at
Stanford.
"I'm pleased that multicultur
alism is on everyone's agenda on
campus. Whether you like it or
you don't, it's everywhere ... in
all communities."
