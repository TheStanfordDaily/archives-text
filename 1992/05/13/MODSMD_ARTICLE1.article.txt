# Ricks to leave for Boston non-profit
## Educator worked to build community 
### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
Greg Ricks, Stanford's first
multicultural educator, an
nounced yesterday that he will
leave the University June 30 to
become Vice President for Edu
cation and Training at City
Year, a non-profit "urban
peace corps" in Boston.
During his three years on
campus, Ricks has worked with

Residential
Education and
the Dean of
Students
Office to build
a more plural
istic Stanford
community.
He has focused
on developing
residence-

based programs to foster critical
thinking and honest discussions
about ethnicity and culture.
"We will miss Greg a great
deal," said Dean of Students
Michael Jackson. "He has
inspired us with his energy, his
love of educating students and
getting them to learn from one
another."
Ricks said that although he
has made advances at Stanford
over the last three years, there
is still much to do.
"When I first came to Stan
ford, I spent long hours listen
ing to students, trying to hear
and feel where they were," he
said. "It was a very polarized

community. . . . Students of
color thought that multicultur
alism was diluting their efforts
to build strong individual com
munities of color, and white
students felt it was not con
necting them."
One of the biggest problems
is students' "zero-sum analy
sis" of multiculturalism, Ricks
said.
"People think that by mak
ing one community strong, you
have to make another weak.
That's not necessarily true.
This is what I mean by 'zero
sum analysis,' and this is what
I've worked to change."
Asst. Dean of Students
Keith Archuleta called Ricks'
departure "a tremendous loss
for the community."
"Greg has done a lot to
define the position (of multi
cultural educator)," Archuleta
said. "When he first came, it
was like trying to put meat on a
skeleton. He concretized a lot
of nebulous ideas in terms of
the position."
A search for Ricks' succes
sor will begin this summer,
according to Ann Porteus,
associate director of Res Ed. It
will likely be open to people
from both within and outside
the University, Jackson said.
Ricks said that although he
probably will not be involved in
the search, he is writing a report
on his experiences. "I hope the
