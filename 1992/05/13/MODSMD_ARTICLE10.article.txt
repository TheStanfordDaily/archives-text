Clinton, Bush roll in primaries
Democratic presidential front-runner Bill Clinton routed Jerry
Brown in the West Virginia and Nebraska primaries Tuesday and
turned increasingly toward his fall campaign for the White House.
Clinton had 75 percent of the West Virginia vote to 12 percent
for Brown with 58 percent of the precincts reporting in a slow
count.
In Nebraska, Clinton had 47 percent to 23 percent for Brown
and 17 percent for uncommitted, with returns counted from
slightly more than half the precincts.
The Arkansas governor, with more than 80 percent of the del
egate strength needed to capture the nomination, appears poised
to clinch his party's prize when California and five other states
close out the primary season June 2.
President Bush, with a lock on renomination, won more than
80 percent of the vote in Republican primaries in West Virginia
and Nebraska.
Obsessed fan still trailing Letterman
NORWALK, Conn. (AP) — An obsessed fan of David Letter
man was ordered yesterday to undergo a psychiatric evaluation
after she was arrested a seventh time for showing up at the talk
show host's house.
"He knew I was coming. . .and he just stood me up," Margaret
Ray shouted from a prison van after her arraignment on a charge
of criminal trespass.
Ray, 40, of Crawford, Colo., told reporters she left two cookies
and an empty bottle of Jack Daniel's whiskey in the foyer of Let
terman's New Canaan house during her visit Monday night.
Court documents listed two cookies in a plastic bag, a nearly
empty whiskey bottle and a priority mail envelope containing
papers among items seized when Ray was arrested.
Letterman, the host of NBC's "Late Night with David Letter
man," once discovered Ray standing in a darkened hallway outside
his bedroom and another time found her sleeping in another bed
room.
He was never harmed in any of the incidents, police said.
Japanese press blacks out bride search
TOKYO (AP) — Japan's crown prince is still searching for a bride,
so newspapers and television stations have quietly agreed to extend a
news blackout on his marriage prospects for another three months.
The mass media first bowed to a request from the Imperial
Household Agency in February to withhold news about Crown
Prince Naruhito's lengthy and keenly followed bridal search.
Palace officials said extensive publicity was scaring away
potential candidates.
The Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association, which
includes newspapers, news agencies and broadcast stations,
agreed to extend the ban through Aug. 12, an association official
said Tuesday.
An Imperial Household Agency refused to comment on how
the search was going for the 32-year-old Naruhito, heir to Japan's
Chrysanthemum Throne.
Until February, the crown prince's search was regular grist for
Japan's weekly magazines and TV entertainment shows.
Reporters often staked out the homes of likely prospects, and
publications competed to expose the names of women rumored to
have met Naruhito, an amateur violist and expert in the history
of marine transport.
