Assigning numbers with
a computer ignores the
charm of familiar ritual

No more lucky charms,
bizarre rituals or tense
waits for a chance to draw
that fateful number.
With the demise of the Draw after
today's last picks, Stanford loses one
of its most colorful traditions. The
age of technology has overtaken an
age of imagination as the University
switches to a computerized system
for assigning housing numbers.
The themes — baseball, the
movies, "Drawland" — are already
two years gone because of budget
cuts, and now the rest will fade
from student memories as well.
The long lines of nervous draw
groups at Tresidder Union, the
cheers and groans, the specter of a
luxurious year in Kimball or a life
in the relatively wretched rooms of
Wilbur — these images will
become part of history as students
instead receive a random number
over the Axess system.
Next year's freshman class will
have four years of guaranteed
housing. But they won't see the
tears, or hear the shouts of joy.
Back when there were Draw
themes, students even won a con
solation prize — which included a
trip to Disneyland one year — for
drawing the worst number.
Like Full Moon on the Quad and
paper fights at Flicks, the Draw is
one of the most memorable
moments of the undergraduate
years. Despite a little extra expense,
the University should reconsider
the move to computerization.
The special character of person
al picks should be retained. But
other Draw proposals currently on
the table are worth implementing.
Starting with next year's fresh
man, every student will get hous
ing — but will have to choose a year
to go "unpreferred." Such a pro
cess will insure that no one ends up

in the best housing year after year.
The current Draw system easily
beats that of many other schools.
For example, UC-Berkeley students
can sign up for the housing lottery
with only one roommate. At anoth
er school, draw groups average their
personal numbers — encouraging
the exclusion of unlucky students.
Of course, the Draw is hardly a
positive experience for everyone.
The tensions created can tear
dorms apart, alienate close friends
and leave a trail of hurt feelings.
Deciding who will be in what
group seems to bring out the worst in
people. And the limits on size oflen
force the exclusion of some students.
Although sensitivity is called
for, it's hard to get around the fact
that, in the final analysis, the deci
sion must be made. Even if draw
groups were allowed to expand,
someone would always get left out.
It is also doubtful that a fairer
process could be devised.
The University is working on a
survey about housing and food ser
vice preferences that explores differ
ent Draw options. One issue to be
addressed is whether there should be
a way to insure that no student ends
up in undesirable housing year after
year due to the luck of the draw.
However, the only way to even
things out would be to allow stu
dents to draw from specific batch
es of numbers. For example, one
year someone might pick from
numbers 1 through 1,000 and the
next year choose a ticket between
1,000 and 2,000.
But such a plan would aggravate a
problem that already crops up for
guaranteed and non-guaranteed stu
dents who would like to live together.
Students with different priority lev
els couldn't be in the same group.
Tuesday afternoon, a student
dressed head-to-toe in green and
pasted a huge four-leaf clover to
his chest before heading to his
turn at the vat of numbers.
If the University goes ahead
with the computerized Draw, such
colorful antics will disappear. And
revising the procedure would be an
equal blow to flexibility and equity.
