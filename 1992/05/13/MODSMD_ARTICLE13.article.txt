## Laughter hid our pain 
### 
HOW CAN I TELL YOU that I love
you when my words betray me? You,
who I have always found so beauti
ful. Would it have helped if I told you?
The depth of your beauty — do you see
what I see or do my flippant comments
scar your self-image?
Hanging out with you, flipping
through magazines. I ogle at the models
— do you perceive a comparison? Do you
retreat under fire, wounded?
People-watching, a favorite pastime of
ours. Who are they? What are they doing?
Where do they come from? Again I ogle,
and sometimes I laugh — "look at the
overweight woman in the tight skirt.
There should be a law!" Am I laughing at
you? Do you retreat under fire, wounded?
You diet. My reaction — "You look
awesome, did you lose weight?" How did
you hear my words? Encouragement? Or
a subtle disdain for your previous appear
ance? Have I wounded you? Do you
retreat under fire?
How often have we laughingly commis
erated about our stress pattern. We
stress, we eat — gaining fleeting moments
of pleasure, and then we wallow in guilt.
We laugh about how at night we both
plan out everything we want to eat the
next day and how we inevitably falter
from our master plan.
We tease each other about our uncan
ny ability to forget the names of people
we met five minutes ago but are able to

remember every modicum of food we ate
in the span of a day, and we laugh.
Your delicate laughter concealed your
pain, I see that now. Thanks to a wrong
turn past the bathroom I was jerked from
my reality into yours.
I heard you. I finally heard you
scream.
DRY HEAVE!! DRY HEAVE!! And
then the purge.
Swimming for answers, I remain in a
world of conjecture. I read, my knee-jerk
reaction to any problem: survey the evi
dence. Swamped with overwhelming
statistics and incident reports and medi
cal and psychological explanations, I con
tinuously return to you and I.
I'm always discharging my "Sensitive
Male Dribble," lines well rehearsed and art
fully espoused. In my personal life, howev
er, how sensitive am I? How aware am I of
the feelings of others? And in my ignorance,
what damage have I helped to wreak?
I believe you trust me. I believe you love
and respect me. But have I battered your
self-image? Has the echo of my passing
remarks helped to spin you out of control?
Power and Control: something I am con
tinually seeking for in my life. Have you
found it in yours? Have you found it in food?
Self-torture? Self-hate? Self-inflicted?
I'm not really sure.
I remember when I starved myself for
football. I wanted to play wide receiver. I
lost 30 pounds. Through my denial of

food I felt as if I gained such strength,
and with the grand approval I received
from friends and coaches I overflowed
with confidence and pride.
With the new coaching staff came a
position change — tight end. I gained the
weight back, plus twenty extra pounds for
good blocking leverage. With the weight
gain, did I lose my power, my strength?
No, not all together. Is it because people
don't continuously judge my worth on the
size of my waistline? I don't know.
You have been my strength for so long,
the rock to which I have turned countless
times. And even when I didn't turn, there
you were at my back supporting my
endeavors. What have I done for you?
What have I done to you?
There is no guilt here, no pity, no
shame, just a desire for an end. I want to
cease being a party to your pain.
I want you to stop finding power
through punishment.
My friend, forgive my simplicities, for
I know none abound. But please, let us
both find courage in ourselves and be
wise enough to instill it in each other.
I want to help.

found it in yours? Have you found it in food?
Self-torture? Self-hate? Self-inflicted?
I'm not really sure.
I remember when I starved myself for
football. I wanted to play wide receiver. I
lost 30 pounds. Through my denial of

food I felt as if I gained such strength,
and with the grand approval I received
from friends and coaches I overflowed
with confidence and pride.
With the new coaching staff came a
position change — tight end. I gained the
weight back, plus twenty extra pounds for
good blocking leverage. With the weight
gain, did I lose my power, my strength?
No, not all together. Is it because people
don't continuously judge my worth on the
size of my waistline? I don't know.
You have been my strength for so long,
the rock to which I have turned countless
times. And even when I didn't turn, there
you were at my back supporting my
endeavors. What have I done for you?
What have I done to you?
There is no guilt here, no pity, no
shame, just a desire for an end. I want to
cease being a party to your pain.
I want you to stop finding power
through punishment.
My friend, forgive my simplicities, for
I know none abound. But please, let us
both find courage in ourselves and be
wise enough to instill it in each other.
I want to help.
