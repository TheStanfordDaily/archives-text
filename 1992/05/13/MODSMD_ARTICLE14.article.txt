Campbell not a racist,
Hoover colleague says
I was shocked and outraged by Visit
ing Scholar Rad Dimitric's irresponsible
letter on the "Campbell incident" in Fri
day's Daily.
I was not present at the dinner at
which W. Glenn Campbell is alleged to
have made objectionable remarks to a vis
iting Serb scholar and I cannot judge the
merits or demerits of the objections raised.
However, I have known Campbell for
about 40 years and have worked closely
with him much of that time. I have never
observed him to behave in an anti-semitic
or racist way, and have never heard him
make anti-semitic or racist remarks. He
is not an anti-semite, a Nazi or a racist.
To call him one solely on the basis of
an ill-reported dinner table conversation
is irresponsible to the extreme. Dimitric
and The Daily should be thoroughly
ashamed of publishing such drivel.

Electric car won't solve
all environment's woes
It is heartening to see the level of
undergraduate enthusiasm for the
SHARP vehicle, as described in the article
titled "Engineering efficiency for tomor
row's cars" in yesterday's Daily. Unfortu
nately, the optimism about environmen
tal protection is somewhat misplaced.
The electricity used to charge hybrid
cars comes from a pollution-emitting
source like oil, coal or nuclear energy.
Energy production from these sources is
not significantly more efficient than
running an internal combustion engine
(used in today's cars).
An enormous loss of electrical energy
occurs during its transmission from the
power plant to the consumer. Further
more, the charging of car batteries caus
es further loss of energy. Hence, the use
of any hybrid car does not seem to allevi

ate environmental problems.
Even an advanced hybrid car, such as
the SHARP car, uses 800 pounds of bat
teries. These batteries contain highly toxic
chemicals which will cause severe waste
disposal problems and environmental
damage when used on a large scale. The
brain power of today's smart undergrad
uate engineers might be better spent on
the development of new technologies for
mass transport than on commercial
interest projects that promote the dan
gerous status quo.

Serb's letter contained
historical inaccuracies
Visiting Scholar Rad Dimitric's letter
in Friday's Daily describes the Croatian
nation as "a nation guilty of war crimes
in the past as well as today." While we
wholeheartedly join condemnations of
racism against the Serbian or any other
nation, we call attention to the fact that
Dimitric's sweeping characterization of
Croats is in itself blatantly racist.
Mentioning "war crimes in the past,"
Dimitric most probably refers to the infa
mous Ustasha regime in Croatia during
the second World War. But Dimitric fails
to mention that the majority of armed
partisans and civilian resistance fighting
this regime were Croats themselves.
Presenting all Croats as "a nation
guilty of war crimes," Dimitric echoes
the Serbian government propaganda
that has been referring to the Croatian
nation as a "genocidal nation" for years
now, and thus has justified in advance
all of the terror perpetrated against that
nation by the ex-Yugoslav army and Ser
bian paramilitary troops.
Dimitric writes that the entire Croat
ian nation also is guilty of war crimes
today. What can one possibly write in
response to this? Not only Croatia, but
Slovania, Bosnia and Herzegovina have
been the targets of the Serbian govern-

ment's military territorial expansionism
that has been condemned internationally.
In his malevolent misrepresentation
of the entire Croatian nation, Dimitric
exhibits open racism. As members of the
Stanford community, we strongly con
demn his statement.

Incident at Roble Hall
racism against whites
Racism is rampant on this campus.
As a white male, I can attest to that. An
article on page nine of Monday's Daily
and a letter to the editor on Tuesday
pointed out the problem perfectly.
To put it simply, just imagine for a
moment the response of The Daily and
the campus had the first sentence of the
article read: "Two white youths shouted
'Kill all the black people' and threw
rocks through. . ."
Mikhail Gorbachev would have taken a
back seat to the type of anti-white propa
ganda all too typical of our campus and
its newspaper. In fact, I would be amazed
if Gorbachev's visit would have fit any
where at all. And you could be assured
that the headline would have mentioned
the words "white," "black" and "racist."
To further confound our senses, the
article ends by quoting a student who has
a categorical disregard to the motivation
and abomination of the incident: "This is
not the biggest deal in the world. It was
two rocks thrown through a window."
Earlier this year, we were all treated
to two weeks of personal persecution of
a particular student who hurled words
against a man who happened to belong
to a "protected" minority.
This weekend, not only were more
severely racist words thrown, but the
physical well-being of those inside was

threatened by rocks crashing through a
window. They were aimed not only at
the residents within, but also at the
entire white population.
The sheer magnitude of this more
recent action drastically overshadows
the prior incident. It is a shame that
some people can actually delegate this
most violent and senseless bigotry to a
response to a court verdict.
But in typical racist fashion, I'm sure
our administration will take no steps to
discern the culprits in this crime, for
this would only defeat their crusade to
instill "pride" and "unity" in intolerance
and reverse discrimination.

USW urges Kennedy to
act in contract dispute
The 94 janitors who clean the Stan
ford campus are in the middle of con
tract negotiations. Their employer is not
Stanford, but ACME, a contractor that
Stanford hires.
This almost exclusively Latino work
force is being offered wage freezes for
the next three years, as well as no
health-insurance coverage. Some of their
current wages are only $5.80 an hour.
Stanford's rhetoric in the past has
always been that this is a contract dis
pute between the workers, their union
and an outside contractor. Just like in
the Webb Ranch controversy, the Uni
versity has some sort of responsibility,
however minimal, to make sure that
workers are not forced to accept sub
standard living conditions.
Once again Stanford must wake up
and assure the community that Latino
workers will not be abused so that Stan
ford can profit from exploited labor.
We ask that University President
Donald Kennedy do whatever the vast
powers of his office holds to give these
workers, what they need to have a
respectable living.
