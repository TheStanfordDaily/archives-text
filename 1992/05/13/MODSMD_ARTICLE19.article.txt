## Baseball wins seventh straight Hot-hitting Detter, sparkling moundwork propel Card 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
In their preparation for regionals, the
Cardinal is showing that it is on a serious
roll. The Stanford baseball team kept up the
intensity of their winning ways by beating
the University of the Pacific Tigers 12-3 in
an impressive show of both offense and
pitching. The non-league win was No. 9
Stanford's (35-20) seventh straight, contin
uing its longest winning streak of the sea
son.
"In non-league games, you just want to
stay hot," Nate Olmstead said.
And the Cardinal did that. Coach Mark
Marquess played most everybody, including
many usual non-starters, and was answered
with plenty of offense. David Holbrook was
an unfamiliar starter in right field while
John Lynch started in left. Jed Hansen got
the nod at shortstop and Olmstead was the
designated hitter for the game. All four
responded to the call by going a collective
nine-for-17 with six RBI.
Tony Detter continued his hitting ways
with two hits including a two-out two-run
home run in the top of the fourth which put
the Cardinal on the board. Nearly every

Baseball

Cardinal 12

Tigers 3

player on the team got a hit as Stanford hit a
cumulative .405 and scored runs in each of
the final six innings. That hot hitting is
reflective of the whole team's performance
lately.
"Hitting is contagious from the team
aspect," Olmstead said. "Once things get
rolling, it can carry itself down through the
lineup. The team can get itself going pretty
quick."
Matt Marenghi started the game for the
Cardinal and looked good through the first
three innings.
However, the freshman right-hander
got touched for three runs in the bottom of
the fourth before being lifted for Tim
Moore, who responded by pitching
through the seventh without allowing a
hit to earn the win. Aaron Dorlarque came
in to pitch the last two innings. In all,
Stanford pitchers allowed only four hits

without an extra-base hit.
Stanford fell behind 2-3 when Pacific
scored their three runs in the fourth. How
ever, the Cardinal regained the lead with
two more runs in the top of the fifth. Olm
stead led off with a single and went to third
one out later on the first of two Hansen dou
bles. Dave Cornell then singled to drive in
Olmstead and Holbrook singled to score
Hansen. From then on, the lead would only
be increased.
"We're going so well as a team," Olmstead
said. "We don't want to lose any of that
momentum."
And that momentum could carry the Car
dinal all the way into regionals. No one is
denying the team's increased intensity, espe
cially when they find themselves losing.
"When we get down [in a game], it's not
the same feeling [as earlier in the year],"
Olmstead said. "We feel we can get back in
the game."
With the increased intensity from the
plate, the stellar performances off the bench,
and the gutty stints on the mound, the Car
dinal looks like a team more than ever before
this season.
"It's strange," Olmstead said. "Every
one's been pulling together."

ever, the Cardinal regained the lead with
two more runs in the top of the fifth. Olm
stead led off with a single and went to third
one out later on the first of two Hansen dou
bles. Dave Cornell then singled to drive in
Olmstead and Holbrook singled to score
Hansen. From then on, the lead would only
be increased.
"We're going so well as a team," Olmstead
said. "We don't want to lose any of that
momentum."
And that momentum could carry the Car
dinal all the way into regionals. No one is
denying the team's increased intensity, espe
cially when they find themselves losing.
"When we get down [in a game], it's not
the same feeling [as earlier in the year],"
Olmstead said. "We feel we can get back in
the game."
With the increased intensity from the
plate, the stellar performances off the bench,
and the gutty stints on the mound, the Car
dinal looks like a team more than ever before
this season.
"It's strange," Olmstead said. "Every
one's been pulling together."

Al Green — Daily file
Chris Kemper raised his average to .333 with his 2-for-4 performance against Pacific yesterday.
The second baseman has started 45 of the Cardinal's 55 games thusfar.
In their preparation for regionals, the
Cardinal is showing that it is on a serious
roll. The Stanford baseball team kept up the
intensity of their winning ways by beating
the University of the Pacific Tigers 12-3 in
an impressive show of both offense and
pitching. The non-league win was No. 9
Stanford's (35-20) seventh straight, contin
uing its longest winning streak of the sea
son.
"In non-league games, you just want to
stay hot," Nate Olmstead said.
And the Cardinal did that. Coach Mark
Marquess played most everybody, including
many usual non-starters, and was answered
with plenty of offense. David Holbrook was
an unfamiliar starter in right field while
John Lynch started in left. Jed Hansen got
the nod at shortstop and Olmstead was the
designated hitter for the game. All four
responded to the call by going a collective
nine-for-17 with six RBI.
Tony Detter continued his hitting ways
with two hits including a two-out two-run
home run in the top of the fourth which put
the Cardinal on the board. Nearly every

Baseball

Cardinal 12

Tigers 3

player on the team got a hit as Stanford hit a
cumulative .405 and scored runs in each of
the final six innings. That hot hitting is
reflective of the whole team's performance
lately.
"Hitting is contagious from the team
aspect," Olmstead said. "Once things get
rolling, it can carry itself down through the
lineup. The team can get itself going pretty
quick."
Matt Marenghi started the game for the
Cardinal and looked good through the first
three innings.
However, the freshman right-hander
got touched for three runs in the bottom of
the fourth before being lifted for Tim
Moore, who responded by pitching
through the seventh without allowing a
hit to earn the win. Aaron Dorlarque came
in to pitch the last two innings. In all,
Stanford pitchers allowed only four hits

without an extra-base hit.
Stanford fell behind 2-3 when Pacific
scored their three runs in the fourth. How
ever, the Cardinal regained the lead with
two more runs in the top of the fifth. Olm
stead led off with a single and went to third
one out later on the first of two Hansen dou
bles. Dave Cornell then singled to drive in
Olmstead and Holbrook singled to score
Hansen. From then on, the lead would only
be increased.
