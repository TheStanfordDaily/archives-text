# Brown to lead Senate next year
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Sophomore Ron Brown was
elected chair of the 23rd ASSU
Senate at the body's first meeting
last night.
Brown, who served on this
year's senate, received 12 votes of
the 20 cast. Brown had run for
Council of Presidents with the
"Independents: A New Era"
slate, which finished second in
last month's election.
Brown said he feels "pretty
good about it. It's good to feel
wanted and loved. It's rewarding."
Brown takes over an office
that is currently redefining its
responsibilities in response to last
month's election of the"I Prefer
Not to Have a COP" slate, which
pledges to abolish the Council of
Presidents.
Kevin Warsh, chair of the
22nd senate, said the job now
involves running the senate's
biweekly meet ings, assigning sen
ators to committees and taking
financial responsibility for the
senate's accounts and employees.
In addition, Warsh said, the chair
has to "strictly enforce the consti
tution and bylaws" of the ASSU.
In addition to more responsibil
ities, the senate chair appears like
ly to have more power next year.
Under a bill written by mem
bers of the new senate, the chair
next year would be the leader of
the ASSU Executive Committee,
which would be the "internal
functioning committee of the sen
ate," according to graduate sena
tor Derek Miyahara, one of the
bill's authors.
The bill, which was presented
to the senate for review last night
and will be voted on at the body's
May 26 meeting, would expand
the current role of the chair, giv
ing the position more oversight of
internal ASSU functions, such as
business and service projects.
Brown said he thinks his main
duties will include running the
group's meetings and directing
administrators to the proper sen
ate committees and ASSU offi
cials for student input.
"The senate chair phone num
ber is one that an administrator
would call for student opinion,"
Brown said. "It's my job to get
those calls to the right people."
But Brown promised he would
not speak to the administration
on behalf of the student body as a
whole, especially since he was not
elected by the student body.
Brown also pledged not to cast
the deciding vote if the senate ties
in a vote on a bill.
In discussion before the vote,
some questioned whether Brown
would be impartial as senate
chair. Brown served as a People's
Platform senator in the outgoing
senate.
Graduate senator Kevin Mur
dock said he thinks it would be

"wise for this body to distance itself
from parties," and said he is con
cerned that electing a chair linked
with a party could hurt the senate.
But Brown said he does not
think the chair has a chance to be
partial. "The chair position is a pret
ty straightforward job," he said.
"The job is not a partisan one."

'The senate chair ...
is one that an
administrator would
call for student
opinion. It's my job
to [direct them] to
the right people.'
—Ron Brown

Seven other candidates ran for
senate chair. Each had five minutes
to give a speech, followed by a five
minute question and answer period.
Ralph Ermoian, a senior, came
in second in the voting, receiving
three votes. Graduate student
Rob Corry and sophomores Silvia
Eerroni, John Hall and Nawwar
Kasrawi each received one vote.
One ballot was left blank.
