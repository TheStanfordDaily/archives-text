Sophomore Ron Brown was
elected chair of the 23rd ASSU
Senate at the body's first meeting
last night.
Brown, who served on this
year's senate, received 12 votes of
the 20 cast. Brown had run for
Council of Presidents with the
"Independents: A New Era"
slate, which finished second in
last month's election.
Brown said he feels "pretty
good about it. It's good to feel
wanted and loved. It's rewarding."
Brown takes over an office
that is currently redefining its
responsibilities in response to last
month's election of the"I Prefer
Not to Have a COP" slate, which
pledges to abolish the Council of
Presidents.
Kevin Warsh, chair of the
22nd senate, said the job now
involves running the senate's
biweekly meet ings, assigning sen
ators to committees and taking
financial responsibility for the
senate's accounts and employees.
In addition, Warsh said, the chair
has to "strictly enforce the consti
tution and bylaws" of the ASSU.
In addition to more responsibil
ities, the senate chair appears like
ly to have more power next year.
Under a bill written by mem
bers of the new senate, the chair
next year would be the leader of
the ASSU Executive Committee,
which would be the "internal
functioning committee of the sen
ate," according to graduate sena
tor Derek Miyahara, one of the
bill's authors.
The bill, which was presented
to the senate for review last night
and will be voted on at the body's
