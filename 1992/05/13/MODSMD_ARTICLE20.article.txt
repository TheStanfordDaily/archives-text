# Bear hunting, and searching for 'EC'
## Writer tracks Yosemite beasts with chocolate chip granola bars 
### 
Exhausted by people whining about mid
terms and problem sets, I slipped away
last week to hunt bears in Yosemite
National Park.
I'm not sure how the bears like it, but for
humans, Yosemite is the perfect place to
escape: far away from precipitous midterm
curves, slide-tackling girlfriends and defensive
backs who don't think your columns are
funny.
But it shouldn't take senioritis and exces
sive testosterone to get you to the nation's
preeminent national park. If you haven't
made the five-hour trek to this granite-carved
valley, you should be immediately deported to
a snooty Ivy League school in the sun-starved
Northeast and forced to play bridge for the
rest of your life.
Yosemite is breath-taking year round, but
most beautiful in the spring. The waterfalls
are full, yet the summer tourist throngs are
still at home. Sparkling wildfiowers dance

across the valley floor. There are cliffs to
climb, hills to hike and vistas to remember for
ever. Best of all are the bears.
Rugged, dangerously playful creatures,
black bears are the true owners of Yosemite.
And who can dislike an animal that sleeps for
half the year?
Before any animal activists skin my hide, I
should clarify my bear hunting. I wasn't hunt
ing bears with a gun (that's illegal in
Yosemite), but with scrumptious chocolate

chip granola bars. My purpose wasn't to kill,
but to make friends with a furry creature. You
can't get any more EC than that.
"The black bears that inhabit this area typ
ically emerge from their winter dens during
the first weeks of April," warns the Yosemite
visitor guide. "With body fat depleted, bears
anxiously seek whatever food is
available. . .Never try to retrieve food taken by
a bear."
I figured the easiest way to meet a bear was
to violate all the rules mandated by the park
service. As soon as I had erected my tent at the
Sunnyside campground, I threw honey-cov
ered granola bars around the inside and scat
tered honey-nut cheerios outside. At night, I
propped open the bear box and left a bear
snack inside, waiting.
Hours later, I awoke in a cold sweat. "I

could smell it, strong and hot
and rank. Sprawling, I looked up
where it loomed and towered
over me like a thunderclap." But
my nightmare was only an old
William Faulkner passage,
inspired by camping mate Chris'
smelly shoes hanging from a tent
pole.
Although the granola was
popular with the squirrels, the
bears didn't bite, and Ranger
Willie threatened to kick me out
of camp. Discouraged, I contin
ued my search at the closest
watering hole, the Mountain
Room Bar, one of three in the
valley.
After a few beers and no bears
I finally recognized the problem:
the valley is so commercialized
that all the bears have either
signed with a corporate protector
or moved far into the hills.
Environmentalist giants
Exxon, Chevron and Dupont
Chemical are three of the biggest
donors to the Yosemite Fund,
dedicated to keeping Yosemite
natural-looking. If John Muir
were exploring today, he would
probably be funded by the fine
folks at Chernobyl Gas and Elec
tric.
Park concessionaire Curry
Company makes millions of dol
lars from the tourists, but the
crowds and cars tend to scare
away the bears, not to mention
the lions and tigers, oh my.
Forced to climb into the back
country, I hiked eight miles for
ward and one straight up, final
ly reaching the top of Half
Dome.
With a Uecker seat at the top
of the world, I still didn't see any
bears, but I was rewarded with
an amazing view and my final
granola bar. The bears will be
there for my next visit, and
they'll still be hungry.
