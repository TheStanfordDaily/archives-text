# Bear hunting, and searching for 'EC'
## Writer tracks Yosemite beasts with chocolate chip granola bars 
### 
Exhausted by people whining about mid
terms and problem sets, I slipped away
last week to hunt bears in Yosemite
National Park.
I'm not sure how the bears like it, but for
humans, Yosemite is the perfect place to
escape: far away from precipitous midterm
curves, slide-tackling girlfriends and defensive
backs who don't think your columns are
funny.
But it shouldn't take senioritis and exces
sive testosterone to get you to the nation's
preeminent national park. If you haven't
made the five-hour trek to this granite-carved
valley, you should be immediately deported to
a snooty Ivy League school in the sun-starved
Northeast and forced to play bridge for the

Yosemite is breath-taking year round, but
most beautiful in the spring. The waterfalls
are full, yet the summer tourist throngs are
still at home. Sparkling wildfiowers dance

Rugged, dangerously playful creatures,
black bears are the true owners of Yosemite.

Yosemite), but with scrumptious chocolate

chip granola bars. My purpose wasn't to kill,
but to make friends with a furry creature. You
can't get any more EC than that.
"The black bears that inhabit this area typ
ically emerge from their winter dens during
the first weeks of April," warns the Yosemite
visitor guide. "With body fat depleted, bears
anxiously seek whatever food is
available. . .Never try to retrieve food taken by
a bear."
I figured the easiest way to meet a bear was
to violate all the rules mandated by the park
service. As soon as I had erected my tent at the
Sunnyside campground, I threw honey-cov
ered granola bars around the inside and scat
tered honey-nut cheerios outside. At night, I
propped open the bear box and left a bear
snack inside, waiting.
Hours later, I awoke in a cold sweat. "I
