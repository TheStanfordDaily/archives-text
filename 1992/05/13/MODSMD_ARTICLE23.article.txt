# One-two punch scores in Texas
## Gaines wins, Edwards qualifies for Olympics at UT Relays 
### Nick Clements Staff writer 
When Chryste Gaines won the national 55-meter
dash title in mid-March at the NCAA Indoor Cham
pionships, all collegiate eyes were on her. After the
Texas Relays this weekend, the whole world is
watching her.
Gaines ran the 100-meter dash in a wind-aided
time of 10.90 seconds this weekend to further ele
vate her stature as one of the top female sprinters
in the world today. Her time was the best American
time this year and the second-best in the world. She
beat out LSU's Ester Jones and Texas' Carletta
Guidry, both of whom beat her in the NCAA Cham
pionships last year when she finished third.
"She has every reason to be confident in making
the team," said head coach Brooks Johnson of
Gaines' quest for making the U.S. Olympic team.
Not only does Gaines have the Pacific 10 Confer
ence and NCAA Championships ahead of her this
spring, but she also is a graduating senior who is
completing her premedical requirements.
"She has a lot of extraneous, peripheral things to
deal with," Johnson said.
Jackie Edwards, who also was competing at the
Texas Relays this weekend, long jumped 21 feet,
four and 3/4 inches to automatically qualify for the
NCAA Championships.
Four of her six jumps were over 21 feet in a
series Johnson called "the best of her life."
Edwards is of Olympic caliber herself — she will

represent her native Bahamas in the 1992
Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.
Freshman Travis Clark, the final Stanford ath
lete down in Texas this weekend, high jumped 6
feet, ten inches to warm up for Pac-10 Champi
onships.
"Freshmen normally hit the wall around this
time," said Johnson, voicing caution about becom
ing overconfident of Clark's chances at Pac-lOs.
"He definitely has prime-time potential, though."
Johnson said that many Stanford athletes who
need extra work before Pac-10 Championships will
be participating in the Modesto Relays this upcom
ing weekend, including Susan Helfter in the 800-
meter and Chrisy Boyd in the intermediate hurdles.
Johnson said that many members of the men and
women's throwing teams will most likely compete
in the Modesto Relays as well.
As for the Pac-10 Championships, Johnson held
back in predicting where the team will fall in over
all standings.
"When we're good, we're very good," he said.
"When we're bad, we're very bad, and that's not
very good."
Card Notes
In other significant developments in Stanford track
and field, Johnson said that he will be retiring next year
as Stanford's head track and field coach. Johnson said
that he has submitted an application as head coach to Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo but has not heard back yet. His offi
cial resignation to Athletic Director Ted Leland will be
offered later this week.
