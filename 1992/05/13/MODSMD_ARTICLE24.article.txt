# Helling wins with fire
## Success of 'Lucky Mistake' no accident 
### Quinn Moo Staff writer 
His mother calls him a lucky mistake.
Varsity baseball coach Mark Marquess calls
him a hard thrower. And opposing batters
call pitcher Rick Helling all kinds of things.
But the soft-spoken, 6-foot-3 215-lb
junior college transfer lets 90 mph scream
ing fastballs do the talking. And lately,
they've said a lot. Enough, in fact, to earn
him an invitation to the 1992 USA Baseball
Team Trials at Millington, Tennessee June
8-14.
"They [Olympic coaches] have got peo
ple watching him all season," coach Mar
quess said. "They've done their homework
on him. Since he faced international com
petition in the Pan Am Games, he has a
better line on it."
Helling pitched for the USA team that
won the bronze medal at the 1991 Pan Am
Games in Havana. This summer, he has
another shot at representing the United
States in Barcelona.
But Rick said he may face some logistical
conflicts due to the extended college season
and finals: "It's going to be hectic. The Col
lege World Series ends the day before trials
start, and I may have to take my finals
early," Helling said.
For now, Helling (8-4, 96*.7 IP, 90 SO) is
honing his pitching for regional competi
tion. He throws heat predominantly, and
mixes in a curve and slider "to keep the bat
ters off-balance."
"He's usually able to come up with big
pitching in a big spot, and can throw the
breaking ball at any time in the count,"
Marquess said.
Beyond sheer physical ability and
nuanced mechanics, Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division pitchers need a certain
psychological approach to take the mound
and hold it against arguably the best hit
ters in the country.
To keep a clear mental approach,
Helling shuts everything out except the
batter. Concentration (or the lack of it) will
make or break a pitcher, he explained.
"Like Dave Stewart said, 'it's tunnel
vision.' I don't hear the crowd out there; all
I do is focus on (catcher Mark Skeels')
glove," he said.
And it helps if pitchers are a little wacky
themselves. Though Helling said he isn't
very superstitious, he admits to a few ritu
als he performs regularly to keep his edge.
He doesn't shave the day before starts, and
always tosses the same warm-pitches in the
same order.
"It's mostly little things that I do," he

said.
About an hour before the game he
stretches for nearly 20 minutes, and
receives a rubdown and massage of his
right arm. Starting pitchers usually throw
over 100 pitches, so flexibility is key.
Helling said he doesn't attempt to strike
every batter out; rather he will look for the
easy ground-out or pop-up. The last thing
he wants to do is duel to full counts with
batters.
"The hitters are so good you don't worry
about dominating batters. Out here you
have ninth hitters who could be hitting
fourth, fifth back East," he said.
But when he needs a big out, he "reach
es back and gets a few extra mph on the
ball. It's the adrenalin that helps me out
there," Helling said.
Helling developed his aggressive, pin
point pitching at Kishwaukee Junior Col
lege in Illinois. He compiled a 7-2 record
with a 1.35 ERA, and struck out 72 batters
in 62 innings.
"I take one batter at a time, one pitch at
a time," he said, because if you look ahead
to the next batter, "then you make mis
takes."
Once his pitches are clicking, Helling
can relax and retire the side. But coach
Marquess said Helling must work on his
consistency from start to start.
"At times (Helling) is inconsistent. He'll
have one or two good outings with control
of all his pitches, then he'll have a bad out
ing. He's pitched well for us," Marquess
said.
Helling faltered in his last start May 9,
giving up seven earned runs to California
in 3.2 innings. Stanford (34-20 overall, 17-
13 conference) eventually won the slugfest
22-10, and swept the three-game series to
take sole possession of first place in the Six-
Pac.
Despite the recent setback, Helling in
his first season on the Farm has adjusted
quickly to the stacked lineups of former
high school All-Americans. He leads the
team in wins with eight, has pitched three
complete games and a shutout.
"Though it's his first year in the pro
gram, he leads by his performance [on the
mound]," Coach Marquess said.
Strangely, Helling said he "doesn't feel
any pressure," while pitching. He said he
plays loose and "hasn't felt nervous since
my freshman year in high school."
A Lucky Mistake
It's surprising that Helling ever felt ner
vous with a baseball in his hand. Born in a
small North Dakota town called Devil's

Lake, he doesn't remember the first time
he picked up a baseball.
The story of how he learned the sandlot
game is charming.
Nine years after Rick's brother Rod was
born, Lorraine Helling became pregnant
unexpectedly. Nine months later, Rick was
born. When his teenage brothers began
playing baseball, Rick toddled after them to

the diamond.
"Rod would hit me ground balls,"
Helling recalled. "They would throw the
ball as hard as they could at me, and I'd
hurt my hands."
But little Ricky matured through child
hood and adolescence, and years later

Flamethrower Rick Helling has stormed into the No. 2 starter position in his first sea
son with the Cardinal.
Helling was voted MVP of both
North Dakota and the surround
ing 8-State Region.
"My mom calls me 'lucky mis
take' sometimes," Rick said.
His parents divorced when
Rick was a youngster, and Helling
said he "saw my mom was going
to need help raising me [by her
self). I became a good kid."
As Rick's pitching progressed,
he told his mother he would trans
fer to West Fargo, 2 and 1/2 hours
away from Lakota High, where he
started varsity for three years.
"If I hadn't moved to 'Fargo, I

wouldn't be where I am today,"
Helling said. He didn't like play
ing the field, so he turned to the
mound.
"The more I played, the more I
began to like pitching," Helling said.
Helling simply overpowered
Fargo's foes, going 15-0 with a 1.81
ERA his senior season. The Fargo
team carried a grueling 65-game
schedule spread over one summer.
The team would play four or five
doubleheaders a week.
"No better way to spend the
summer than that. . . .Our team
was close-knit," Helling said.
Despite his success on the
mound, Helling opted to play foot
ball at University of North Dako
ta. But while playing in the
Legion World Series baseball

game, he had to miss the first two
weeks of practice. He was red
shirted and didn't play a down.
"Not playing, I sat back and
thought about my career. I real
ized that. . .the easier road is
baseball. In baseball you can work
through the minor leagues, in
football it's the NFL or nothing,"
Helling said.
A year later he transferred to
Kishwaukee, and signed with
Stanford in January 1991.
"I've come a long ways. If you
told me that I'd be here four years
ago, when I was in North Dako
ta. .. .I've made a few tough deci
sions and they've worked out, and
hopefully my luck will continue,"
Helling said, then quickly found
some wood to knock.

Helling said.

"I've come a long ways. If you
told me that I'd be here four years
ago, when I was in North Dako

sions and they've worked out, and

Helling said, then quickly found
some wood to knock.
His mother calls him a lucky mistake.
Varsity baseball coach Mark Marquess calls
him a hard thrower. And opposing batters
call pitcher Rick Helling all kinds of things.
But the soft-spoken, 6-foot-3 215-lb
junior college transfer lets 90 mph scream

they've said a lot. Enough, in fact, to earn
him an invitation to the 1992 USA Baseball
Team Trials at Millington, Tennessee June
8-14.
"They [Olympic coaches] have got peo
ple watching him all season," coach Mar
quess said. "They've done their homework
on him. Since he faced international com
petition in the Pan Am Games, he has a
better line on it."
Helling pitched for the USA team that
won the bronze medal at the 1991 Pan Am
Games in Havana. This summer, he has
another shot at representing the United
States in Barcelona.
But Rick said he may face some logistical
conflicts due to the extended college season
and finals: "It's going to be hectic. The Col
lege World Series ends the day before trials
start, and I may have to take my finals
early," Helling said.
For now, Helling (8-4, 96*.7 IP, 90 SO) is
honing his pitching for regional competi
tion. He throws heat predominantly, and
mixes in a curve and slider "to keep the bat
ters off-balance."
"He's usually able to come up with big
pitching in a big spot, and can throw the
breaking ball at any time in the count,"
Marquess said.
Beyond sheer physical ability and
nuanced mechanics, Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division pitchers need a certain
psychological approach to take the mound
and hold it against arguably the best hit
ters in the country.
To keep a clear mental approach,
Helling shuts everything out except the
batter. Concentration (or the lack of it) will
make or break a pitcher, he explained.
"Like Dave Stewart said, 'it's tunnel
vision.' I don't hear the crowd out there; all
I do is focus on (catcher Mark Skeels')
glove," he said.
And it helps if pitchers are a little wacky
themselves. Though Helling said he isn't
very superstitious, he admits to a few ritu
als he performs regularly to keep his edge.
He doesn't shave the day before starts, and
always tosses the same warm-pitches in the
same order.
"It's mostly little things that I do," he

said.
About an hour before the game he
stretches for nearly 20 minutes, and
receives a rubdown and massage of his
right arm. Starting pitchers usually throw
over 100 pitches, so flexibility is key.
Helling said he doesn't attempt to strike
every batter out; rather he will look for the
easy ground-out or pop-up. The last thing
he wants to do is duel to full counts with
batters.
"The hitters are so good you don't worry
about dominating batters. Out here you
have ninth hitters who could be hitting
fourth, fifth back East," he said.
But when he needs a big out, he "reach
es back and gets a few extra mph on the
ball. It's the adrenalin that helps me out
there," Helling said.
Helling developed his aggressive, pin
point pitching at Kishwaukee Junior Col
lege in Illinois. He compiled a 7-2 record
with a 1.35 ERA, and struck out 72 batters
in 62 innings.
"I take one batter at a time, one pitch at
a time," he said, because if you look ahead
to the next batter, "then you make mis
takes."
Once his pitches are clicking, Helling
can relax and retire the side. But coach
Marquess said Helling must work on his
consistency from start to start.
"At times (Helling) is inconsistent. He'll
have one or two good outings with control
of all his pitches, then he'll have a bad out
ing. He's pitched well for us," Marquess
said.
Helling faltered in his last start May 9,
giving up seven earned runs to California
in 3.2 innings. Stanford (34-20 overall, 17-
13 conference) eventually won the slugfest
22-10, and swept the three-game series to
take sole possession of first place in the Six-
Pac.
Despite the recent setback, Helling in
his first season on the Farm has adjusted
quickly to the stacked lineups of former
high school All-Americans. He leads the
team in wins with eight, has pitched three
complete games and a shutout.
"Though it's his first year in the pro
gram, he leads by his performance [on the
mound]," Coach Marquess said.
Strangely, Helling said he "doesn't feel
any pressure," while pitching. He said he
plays loose and "hasn't felt nervous since
my freshman year in high school."
A Lucky Mistake
It's surprising that Helling ever felt ner

game is charming.

Helling simply overpowered

mound, Helling opted to play foot
ball at University of North Dako
ta. But while playing in the
Legion World Series baseball

game, he had to miss the first two
weeks of practice. He was red
shirted and didn't play a down.
"Not playing, I sat back and
thought about my career. I real
ized that. . .the easier road is
baseball. In baseball you can work
through the minor leagues, in
football it's the NFL or nothing,"
Helling said.
A year later he transferred to
Kishwaukee, and signed with
Stanford in January 1991.
"I've come a long ways. If you
told me that I'd be here four years
ago, when I was in North Dako
ta. .. .I've made a few tough deci
sions and they've worked out, and
hopefully my luck will continue,"
Helling said, then quickly found
some wood to knock.
