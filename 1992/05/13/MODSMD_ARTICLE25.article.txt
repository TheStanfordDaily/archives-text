# WOMEN'S TENNIS NCAAs AT STANFORD
## NCAA tourney begins, Florida seeded No. 1 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Almost any team can win the
women's tennis 1992 NCAA Cham
pionships. Unlike previous years,
the tournament will probably be
studded with upsets before the
champion is crowned.
Like last season, the Florida
Gators enter the NCAAs as the
undefeated No. 1 seed. Florida
coach Andy Brandi knows the top
seed is not a cinch for the title.
"I see ourselves as an underdog
here," said Brandi, noting of Stan
ford's home-court advantage.
For the second straight year, the
Cardinal is the No. 2-seeded
defending national champions.
Coach Frank Brennan is optimistic
about his squad's chances, yet rec

ognizes the strength of the Gators.
"It's going to take a Herculean
effort for anyone else to win," Bren
nan said.
Along with Florida and Stan
ford, Texas, Georgia and Duke are
likely to make strong runs at the
title. So with first round matches
starting today, here are capsules of
the top 10 teams.
No. 1 Florida
The Gators have been the top
ranked team all season. They won
the National Indoor Championships
in March and are undefeated.
However, they have been tested
several times. UCLA came within
one match of victory in the Indoors
semifinals; Georgia did the same in
the Southeastern Conference
Championships.
Florida is led by freshman Lisa

Raymond, who spent most of the
season ranked No. 1. However, she
fell to No. 2 after losing to Georgia's
Shannan McCarthy in the South
eastern Conference final.
Coming into NCAAs, the Gators
received some good news: former
No. 2 player Andrea Farley has suf
ficiently recovered from an early
season knee injury to see limited
action.
No. 2 Stanford
The Cardinal team is 20-2 on the
year. While the squad has proven it
didn't deserve its No. 5 preseason
ranking, it hasn't shown itself to be
the favorite for the tourney. In the
Indoors final, Stanford lost 5-3
after splitting its singles matches.
Most recently, the team lost 5-4 to
California.
Since then the Cardinal has got

ten healthier. Kylie Johnson has
recovered from a sore back and
Kristine Kurth appears to have
regained form. Emma Woodhouse
is coming off a hamstring tear.
Stanford's strength is the top of
its lineup. Heather Willens and
Laxmi Poruri form one of the top 1-
2 combinations in the game.
Poruri is likely the best No. 2
player in the country. She is
ranked No. 4 nationally and
reached the semis of the Rolex
Championships.
Because of the parity in women's
college tennis this season, the
NCAA title will likely involve signif
icant doubles matches. Doubles,
however, may be the Cardinal's
weak point.
No. 3 Texas
The 22-2 Longhorns enter
NCAAs with a 12-match winning
streak. They have only lost to Flori
da and UCLA this season and have
a strong veteran squad.
"We have been building the last
couple of years," said Susan
Gilchrist, Texas' No. 1 singles play
er. "[The NCAA field] is more even
ly matched. Stanford and Florida
were more dominating in the past
few years."
Gilchrist and Vickie Paynter are
the Longhorns' and the nation's
top doubles pair. With the doubles
strength, Paynter views the upper
third of the lineup as the key to an
NCAA title for Texas.
"Our strength is the middle and
low part of the lineup," she said.
No. 4 Duke
The 21-3 Blue Devils are a deep
team with four players in or around
the top 50. However, Duke man
aged only one match from Stanford
in the quarterfinals of the Indoors.
Losses to Florida and Texas also dot
the Blue Devils' record.
No. 5 Georgia
The Bulldogs started the year at
No. 2 but suffered several season
ending injuries during the 1992
campaign.
That still leaves the Bulldogs
with some strong players. First and
foremost is Shannan McCarthy,
who is ranked No. 1 in the country.
McCarthy has beaten Florida's
Raymond twice this year to take
over the top singles slot.
Her success versus Raymond
may play a pivotal role in the
NCAAs as the two teams could
clash in the semifinals. Georgia
probably relishes the thought of
facing the Gators, rather than the

Cardinal, in the semis.
In the last five years, the Bulldogs
have been in the Cardinal's half of
the draw — they have also been elim
inated five straight times.
No. 6 California
The Bears have had an up and
down year. They beat Stanford
once and UCLA twice but mixed
that with seven losses. Lisa Albano
is the squad's experienced leader.
She was a singles finalist last year
and will be a key player if Cal is to
make a move to the semifinals or
beyond.
No. 7 UCLA
Always difficult to figure out, the
15-7 Bruins have shown they have
the talent to beat top teams. They
nearly upset Florida at Indoors and
have experience in the NCAAs.
UCLA knocked the top-seeded
Gators out of last season's tourna
ment in the semifinals.
A good sign for the present Bruin
squad is that Iwalarii McCalla is
expected back in the lineup.

No. 8 Arizona
The Wildcats have surged to
their highest ranking ever at No. 8.
Danielle Scott and Banni Redhair
have led the team in dual matches
but the surprise is 16th-ranked Alix
Creek. The Wildcat recently won
the Pacific 10 Conference title,
beating Stanford's Heather Willens
along the way.
No. 9 Arizona State
The 17-7 Sun Devils have two
top-40 players in Krista Amend and
Kori Davidson. One of their most
impressive victories this year was
over California, as the Bears were
coming off their upset of Stanford.
No. 10 Indiana
The Hoosiers have two strong
singles players and the No. 3 dou
bles tandem with Deborah Edel
man and Stephanie Reece. They
have rarely been tested in confer
ence. Indiana defeated Cal at
Indoors but lost to Stanford. Their
two other losses are to Duke and
Arizona.


Tracy Allen — Daily file
Amy Chiminello zeroes in on a forehand groundstroke. The freshman will play the fifth singles slot for
the No. 2 Cardinal.

women's tennis 1992 NCAA Cham

the tournament will probably be

expected back in the lineup.

No. 8 Arizona
The Wildcats have surged to
their highest ranking ever at No. 8.
Danielle Scott and Banni Redhair
have led the team in dual matches
but the surprise is 16th-ranked Alix
Creek. The Wildcat recently won
the Pacific 10 Conference title,
beating Stanford's Heather Willens
along the way.
No. 9 Arizona State
The 17-7 Sun Devils have two
top-40 players in Krista Amend and
Kori Davidson. One of their most
impressive victories this year was
over California, as the Bears were
coming off their upset of Stanford.
No. 10 Indiana
The Hoosiers have two strong
singles players and the No. 3 dou
bles tandem with Deborah Edel
man and Stephanie Reece. They
have rarely been tested in confer
ence. Indiana defeated Cal at
Indoors but lost to Stanford. Their
two other losses are to Duke and
Arizona.


Tracy Allen — Daily file
Amy Chiminello zeroes in on a forehand groundstroke. The freshman will play the fifth singles slot for
the No. 2 Cardinal.

Almost any team can win the
women's tennis 1992 NCAA Cham
pionships. Unlike previous years,
the tournament will probably be
studded with upsets before the
champion is crowned.
Like last season, the Florida
Gators enter the NCAAs as the
undefeated No. 1 seed. Florida
coach Andy Brandi knows the top
seed is not a cinch for the title.
"I see ourselves as an underdog
here," said Brandi, noting of Stan
ford's home-court advantage.
For the second straight year, the
Cardinal is the No. 2-seeded
defending national champions.
Coach Frank Brennan is optimistic
about his squad's chances, yet rec

ognizes the strength of the Gators.
"It's going to take a Herculean
effort for anyone else to win," Bren
nan said.
Along with Florida and Stan
ford, Texas, Georgia and Duke are
likely to make strong runs at the
title. So with first round matches
starting today, here are capsules of
the top 10 teams.
No. 1 Florida
The Gators have been the top
ranked team all season. They won
the National Indoor Championships
in March and are undefeated.
However, they have been tested
several times. UCLA came within
one match of victory in the Indoors
semifinals; Georgia did the same in
the Southeastern Conference
Championships.
Florida is led by freshman Lisa

Raymond, who spent most of the
season ranked No. 1. However, she
fell to No. 2 after losing to Georgia's
Shannan McCarthy in the South
eastern Conference final.
Coming into NCAAs, the Gators
received some good news: former
No. 2 player Andrea Farley has suf
ficiently recovered from an early
season knee injury to see limited
action.
No. 2 Stanford
The Cardinal team is 20-2 on the
year. While the squad has proven it
didn't deserve its No. 5 preseason
ranking, it hasn't shown itself to be
the favorite for the tourney. In the
Indoors final, Stanford lost 5-3
after splitting its singles matches.
Most recently, the team lost 5-4 to
California.
Since then the Cardinal has got

ten healthier. Kylie Johnson has
recovered from a sore back and
Kristine Kurth appears to have
regained form. Emma Woodhouse
is coming off a hamstring tear.
Stanford's strength is the top of
its lineup. Heather Willens and
Laxmi Poruri form one of the top 1-
2 combinations in the game.
Poruri is likely the best No. 2
player in the country. She is
ranked No. 4 nationally and
reached the semis of the Rolex
Championships.
Because of the parity in women's
college tennis this season, the
NCAA title will likely involve signif
icant doubles matches. Doubles,
however, may be the Cardinal's
weak point.
No. 3 Texas
The 22-2 Longhorns enter
NCAAs with a 12-match winning
streak. They have only lost to Flori
da and UCLA this season and have
a strong veteran squad.
"We have been building the last
couple of years," said Susan
Gilchrist, Texas' No. 1 singles play
er. "[The NCAA field] is more even
ly matched. Stanford and Florida
were more dominating in the past
few years."
Gilchrist and Vickie Paynter are
the Longhorns' and the nation's
top doubles pair. With the doubles
strength, Paynter views the upper
third of the lineup as the key to an
NCAA title for Texas.
"Our strength is the middle and
low part of the lineup," she said.
No. 4 Duke
The 21-3 Blue Devils are a deep
team with four players in or around
the top 50. However, Duke man
aged only one match from Stanford
in the quarterfinals of the Indoors.
Losses to Florida and Texas also dot
the Blue Devils' record.
No. 5 Georgia
The Bulldogs started the year at
No. 2 but suffered several season
ending injuries during the 1992
campaign.
That still leaves the Bulldogs
with some strong players. First and
foremost is Shannan McCarthy,
who is ranked No. 1 in the country.
McCarthy has beaten Florida's
Raymond twice this year to take
over the top singles slot.
Her success versus Raymond
may play a pivotal role in the
NCAAs as the two teams could
clash in the semifinals. Georgia
probably relishes the thought of
facing the Gators, rather than the

Cardinal, in the semis.
In the last five years, the Bulldogs
have been in the Cardinal's half of
the draw — they have also been elim
inated five straight times.
No. 6 California
The Bears have had an up and
down year. They beat Stanford
once and UCLA twice but mixed
that with seven losses. Lisa Albano
is the squad's experienced leader.
She was a singles finalist last year
and will be a key player if Cal is to
make a move to the semifinals or
beyond.
No. 7 UCLA
Always difficult to figure out, the
15-7 Bruins have shown they have
the talent to beat top teams. They
nearly upset Florida at Indoors and
have experience in the NCAAs.
UCLA knocked the top-seeded
Gators out of last season's tourna
ment in the semifinals.
A good sign for the present Bruin
squad is that Iwalarii McCalla is
expected back in the lineup.

No. 8 Arizona
The Wildcats have surged to
their highest ranking ever at No. 8.
Danielle Scott and Banni Redhair
have led the team in dual matches
but the surprise is 16th-ranked Alix
Creek. The Wildcat recently won
