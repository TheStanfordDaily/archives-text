# Camaraderie, respect keys coaching success
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Although Frank Brennan has
eight NCAA trophies and a winning
percentage over .900 as head coach of
the Stanford women's tennis team,
he avoids claiming too much credit
for the success of the program.
If it's not him, then what is it?
"Irish luck," deadpans Brennan.
A wry sense of humor is one of the
many characteristics which has
helped him build an unprecedented
tennis dynasty.
Brennan knows tennis and is a
good evaluator of talent and charac
ter. He nurtures team camraderie
and most of all, he has in assistant
coach Lele Forood a person who
understands tennis and people as
well as he does.
"A Frank Brennan and Lele
Forood coached team is more than
twice as good as a Frank Brennan
coached team," Brennan said. "She
knows the game and has a fantastic
way of handling people. She's a very
good detail person, which isn't my
strength."
One thing Forood is especially
good at is developing players,
improving every aspect of their
games. "I know the game very well
and to a receptive ear I can explain
how and why," said Forood, who was
coached by Brennan since she was
10.
She also uses her experiences as a
top 20 pro to evaluate how to take a
person's game to the next level.
"The best players improve their
weak shots and make their good
shots better," Forood said. "Other
wise you'll stagnate."
Laxmi Poruri, the Cardinal's No.
2 singles player, is an athlete who
has the opportunity to take her game
one notch higher. Last year she
switched from a two-handed to one
handed backhand. While she
concentrates on mastering the shot,
Forood envisions the next step —
incorporating the two-fister back
into Poruri's game.
"But you have to know how to use
both shots and when to use them,"
Forood said.
One such situation is when your
opponent hits a short sharply-angled
shot to the backhand side. The entire

court is opened up by this move and,
if your opponent reaches your shot,
all she has to do to is block it down
the line.
In that situation you can't have
the ball coming back. "Some
times you need the extra power to
drill the ball," said Forood, explain
ing that most women can't generate
the necessary racquet head speed
with a one-hander. The extra hand
gives you more power, leverage and
control.
While power considerations are
one difference between successful
coaching of men and women, Bren
nan recognizes a psychological differ
ence between the two.
"Men are ability attributors
whereas women are effort attribu
tors," Brennan said. "If you hypno
tize (Stanford men's No. 1) Alex
O'Brien and ask him why he's a good
player, he'll say its because he's a
great athlete. He's fast and has great
hands.
"If you do the same with (Stan
ford women's No. 1) Heather Willens
she'll say it's because she tries hard
er and practices harder than her
opponents.
"I understand that and know how
to make it work."
A lot of Brennan's understanding
of the complexities of the women's
game stems from his upbringing. His
father was a successful pro instruc
tor.
"He was a great technician and a
good evaluator of talent," Brennan
said. "He spotted Billy Jean King
when she was a chunky high school
student from Long Beach who would
go to Forest Hills (former site of the
U.S. Open) and lose in the first
round every year.
He gave her the confidence she need
ed to be world champion."
In the process, the younger Bren
nan learned a lot about the women's
tennis. He hit with King and other
pros and watched them at women's
tournaments.
I got to know the players, and
through them other players," Bren
nan said. "I stayed in that circle. I
wasn't at the men's tournaments."
Along with his experience with
women players, he enjoys the compa-
ny of women in general.
"I'm not the hunting and fish
ing type," he said. "I like women
and I think I coach them well. I
understand women, if that's pos
sible."
That combination of personali
ty and experience made Brennan
a top candidate for the Stanford
job when Anne Gould left the post
in 1979.
Brennan promptly won five
NCAA titles in the next nine
years. Forood boarded the victory
train in 1988, under unusual cir
cumstances.
A month before school started,
Brennan's assistant opted for
another job and Brennan was left
with a vacancy.
Brennan called Forood and
asked her to take the position

until he could find a permanent
replacement. She didn't exactly
jump at the chance.
"I hadn't been around college
for a long time," Forood said. "I
wasn't sure I was old enough to
want to be around 18-21 year
olds. Also, I hadn't played a lot of
tennis for five years. Did I want to
be back on the court that much?"
Finally, she accepted and has
been with Brennan ever since.
Their relationship is rather
unique in that the assistant is an
equal coach, not a glorified side
kick.
"We trust each other 100 per
cent," Brennan said. "Lele and I
are very close emotionally.
"I think Lele thinks I'm the
greatest coach alive and I think
she's the greatest coach alive."
Forood echoed similar, if not
quite so gushy, sentiments.
"There's tremendous rapport
and confidence," she said. "I don't
doubt him and he doesn't doubt

me.
One such situation which
demonstrated that trust occurred
a few years ago.
In a close match, Brennan was
coaching one doubles pairs and
Forood another. Both contests
were tight but Brennan's finished
first.
The other match was 4-4 in the
third set as Brennan watched
from the tennis office balcony. A
parent of one of the players in the
ongoing match kept hinting that
he should go down on the court
and coach.
"Finally I realized what she
was getting at," Brennan said.
"She couldn't stand it any longer
and asked me why I wasn't down
there. 'Lele's there,' I said. 'But
you're the head coach,' she
replied.
"'Yes, but I've never been in a
doubles semifinal of the U.S.
Open. Lele has.' She got quiet
after that. We went on to win that

match 6-4 in the third."
And Forood backs Brennan's
decisions, too.
Brennan appreciates that sup
port. He said that its sometimes
easy to question yourself after
yelling at a team for playing badly
when they react like they played
great.
"You get back to the hotel and
think, 'Yes, they were awful,' he
said. "Then you start thinking,
'Well, I think they were awful.'
Pretty soon you're thinking,
'Damn it, maybe I was too hard on
them.
"Now, I can have a beer with
Lele and say, 'They were awful.'
She'll agree, 'Yes, they were awful
but the doubles were good.' So
then I can qualify my screaming
with that."
Forood works best on the court
and said the one-on-one con
frontations between coaches and
players is her weakness.
"That's the hardest thing —

telling someone, 'Sorry, you're
No. 4," she said. However, don't
expect Forood to be overly sym pa
thetic to the player's plight.
"When they're shocked at
where they are, I'm a little
shocked that they are shocked. In
my mind, they should be able to
evaluate themselves accurately."
In past years Brennan has
been the one to break the tough
news.
But that occasionally led play
ers to ask Forood to persuade
Brennan to change his mind.
Now the coaches meet the players
together "to emphasize the soli
darity of the decision," Forood
said.
Some players believe they
should start at No. 1 and have a
hard time accepting anything less.
But that hasn't been the case this
year said Forood. The 1992 squad
is relatively low on the ego scale
compared to past contingents.
"This team really fell into

place," Forood said. "There
weren't a lot of egos who wanted
to come in play at the top. Some of
them wanted to work their way
up or adjust to the scenario."
Another reason may be that
almost all the current members
had to compete with Sandra
Birch, Debbie Graham and Teri
Whitlinger for spots in the start
ing lineup. As Forood puts it,
"They came in during the killer
teams."
Those squads won six straight
NCAA titles. Can this team extend
the streak? Both Brennan and
Forood are confident that if the team
plays well, the Cardinal will win.
"By getting in here they've
been asked to join and expected to
maintain a standard," Forood
said.
"They know their teammates
have confidence in them. They
know their teammates can per
form when it counts. They expect
a lot out of each other."
