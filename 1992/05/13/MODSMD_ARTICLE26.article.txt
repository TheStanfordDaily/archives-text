# Camaraderie, respect keys coaching success
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Although Frank Brennan has
eight NCAA trophies and a winning
percentage over .900 as head coach of
the Stanford women's tennis team,
he avoids claiming too much credit
for the success of the program.
If it's not him, then what is it?
"Irish luck," deadpans Brennan.
A wry sense of humor is one of the
many characteristics which has
helped him build an unprecedented
tennis dynasty.
Brennan knows tennis and is a
good evaluator of talent and charac
ter. He nurtures team camraderie
and most of all, he has in assistant
coach Lele Forood a person who
understands tennis and people as
well as he does.
"A Frank Brennan and Lele
Forood coached team is more than
twice as good as a Frank Brennan
coached team," Brennan said. "She
knows the game and has a fantastic
way of handling people. She's a very
good detail person, which isn't my
strength."
One thing Forood is especially
good at is developing players,
improving every aspect of their
games. "I know the game very well
and to a receptive ear I can explain
how and why," said Forood, who was
coached by Brennan since she was
10.
She also uses her experiences as a
top 20 pro to evaluate how to take a
person's game to the next level.
"The best players improve their
weak shots and make their good
shots better," Forood said. "Other
wise you'll stagnate."
Laxmi Poruri, the Cardinal's No.
2 singles player, is an athlete who
has the opportunity to take her game
one notch higher. Last year she
switched from a two-handed to one
handed backhand. While she
concentrates on mastering the shot,
Forood envisions the next step â€”
incorporating the two-fister back
into Poruri's game.
"But you have to know how to use
both shots and when to use them,"
Forood said.
One such situation is when your
opponent hits a short sharply-angled
shot to the backhand side. The entire

court is opened up by this move and,
if your opponent reaches your shot,
all she has to do to is block it down
the line.
In that situation you can't have
the ball coming back. "Some
times you need the extra power to
drill the ball," said Forood, explain
ing that most women can't generate
the necessary racquet head speed
with a one-hander. The extra hand
gives you more power, leverage and
control.
While power considerations are
one difference between successful
coaching of men and women, Bren
nan recognizes a psychological differ
ence between the two.
"Men are ability attributors
whereas women are effort attribu
tors," Brennan said. "If you hypno
tize (Stanford men's No. 1) Alex
O'Brien and ask him why he's a good
player, he'll say its because he's a
great athlete. He's fast and has great
hands.
"If you do the same with (Stan
ford women's No. 1) Heather Willens
she'll say it's because she tries hard
er and practices harder than her
opponents.
"I understand that and know how
to make it work."
A lot of Brennan's understanding
of the complexities of the women's
game stems from his upbringing. His
father was a successful pro instruc
tor.
"He was a great technician and a
good evaluator of talent," Brennan
said. "He spotted Billy Jean King
when she was a chunky high school
student from Long Beach who would
go to Forest Hills (former site of the
U.S. Open) and lose in the first
round every year.
He gave her the confidence she need
ed to be world champion."
In the process, the younger Bren
nan learned a lot about the women's
tennis. He hit with King and other
pros and watched them at women's
tournaments.
I got to know the players, and
through them other players," Bren
nan said. "I stayed in that circle. I
wasn't at the men's tournaments."
Along with his experience with
women players, he enjoys the compa-
