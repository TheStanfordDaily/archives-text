# No. 2 Card prepares for title defense
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
You can tell the NCAA Championships
are just around the corner. During prac
tice, the players are hustling an extra step.
There's a gleam in their eyes, an intensity
and confidence not seen early in the sea
son.
The Stanford women's tennis team is
psyched and ready to fight for a seventh
straight national title.
"Everyone is busting their butts," said
freshman Amy Chiminello. "You look to
the court next to you, see how hard people
are playing and know there's no way
you're going to bag on it."
The last few weeks have shown a step
ping up of practice intensity and a concen
tration on team spirit.
"We had an amazing team meeting
tonight," said senior Kylie Johnson.
"We're all focusing on our own game and
the team as a whole. Everyone is so
pumped."
For Johnson, the NCAAs is familiar
territory. She won all four of her singles
matches at No. 6 her freshman season and
clinched the title for the Cardinal last
year.
The experience helps Johnson stay calm
and convey that to younger members of
the squad.
"You learn what to expect," she said.
"It's not this big question mark."
Chiminello is in her first NCAA Cham
pionships.
"The physical preparation is not much
different (than an individual tournament.)
But mentally it's a different concept," she
said. "You're not just playing for yourself
but a team. It's a great feeling."
Chiminello said the pressures of playing
for a team are less, and more, than the
those of competing for yourself. A loss is
sometimes more difficult to stomach, espe
cially if the team loses 5-4, but you have
the your teammates' support, too.
"Everyone's going to be there," she
said. "You want your game to be the best it
possibly can be."
While all the Cardinal starters are final
ly healthy enough to be in the lineup,
Chiminello is being bumped up to No. 5 in
the singles. With a completely healed
squad she would normally compete in the
sixth slot.
"I've played a lot of (No.) 4 and 5,"
Chiminello said. "I've gotten a lot of good
competition and have won there."
Her game has improved greatly from
mid-season when she lost in the finals of
National Indoors against Florida.
"I was playing OK but my confidence
level wasn't high at all," she said. "Now
I'm a lot more confidence. I feel like I'm
playing my best tennis of the season."

'We're all focusing on
our own game and
the team as a whole.
Everyone is so
pumped.'

The usual No. 5, sophomore Emma
Woodhouse will be playing No. 6. Part of it
is due to a hamstring which has kept her
out of dual matches since March. Another
reason is Chiminello's strong season.
"Amy's playing really well so I think its

a combination," Woodhouse said. She has
her leg wrapped as a precaution but
believes its ready for the stress of everyday
competition.
"I've been building up practice time,"
she said. "I've played more and have been
pushing a little more each day so I build up
stamina.
"Once the tournament starts, I'll be too
excited for it to bother me."
And this year it may be more crucial
than ever for the players to be on top of
their games, mentally and physically.
"A lot of teams are really close this
year," Woodhouse said. "We have to watch
our backs in every round. All the matches
are going to be tight."
Johnson agreed. "We're really concen
trating on the first match. We know we
can't look beyond that," she said.

In last year's NCAAs, Kylle Johnson played a key role for the victorious Cardinal. The
senior and her teammates hope to duplicate their 1991 results.
