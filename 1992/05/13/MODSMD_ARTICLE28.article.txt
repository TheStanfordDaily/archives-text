# WOMEN'S TENNIS NCAAs AT STANFORD
## The
						Artist & The Streetfighter Poruri, Willens have contrasting styles but similar results 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Lurching at the ball, Heather
Willens smacks a two-hand
ed backhand return at her
opponent. Recovering her equi
librium, she scrambles crosscourt
to chase down a forehand.
After several grunting, pound
ing exchanges the Stanford
junior takes the point on her
rival's forced error.
In one fluid movement, Laxmi
Poruri hits a deep arcing fore
hand. She glides around the court
to slice a long graceful backhand.
The Cardinal sophomore mixes in
flat arrow-like groundstrokes and
eventually wins the point on a
silk-soft drop shot.
Although Willens and Poruri
are Stanford's top two sin
gles players, they are any
thing but identical.
"We're polar opposites," Wil
lens said. "She looks like she's
putting no effort into any shot. I
look like I'm putting my life on
the line on every point."
While their playing styles are
different, just as disparate are
their approaches to the game.
A self-described scrapper, Wil
lens takes pleasure in playing,
and winning, ugly.
She hits the touch shots but
will never get points for elegant
shotmaking.
Willens methodically mows
down opponents, nailing them to
the baseline until they hit some
thing short.
Then she steps up and crunch
es a winner. Nothing extraneous,
just whatever it takes to clinch
the point.
In the last year, she has
improved her already steady
game by becoming more consis
tent.
"I'm getting a lot more balls
back than I used to," said Willens
who reduces tennis to the nut
and-bolt essentials — whoever
gets in more shots, wins.
The ability to constantly pro
duce high-percentage tennis is
the key to her victories said coach
Frank Brennan. Willens
methodically pounds away while
her adversaries encounter hot
and cold streaks.
"Most players are like this," he
said while waving his hand up
and down. Drawing a horizontal
line in the air with his finger, he
added, "Heather is like this."
Poruri is more of a tennis
chameleon. Though a strong hit
ter who can sizzle passing shots
by you in a second, she likes to
use all the strokes at her disposal.
"I'm a creative player," she
said. "I don't bang everything
and I don't have one style. I do
what feels right. I use more shots
than most people. It's more fun
to use different shots."
Poruri hits just about every
stroke in the book, and then
some. But she gets into trouble
when she tries to find every possi
ble way to pick apart a player,
instead of just beating them.
With her opponent behind the
baseline, she may take a short
ball and plate a delicate drop shot
crosscourt. After several
exchanges Poruri nets a ground
stroke and sighs in frustration.
She knows that a flat sharply
angled shot instead of the ill
advised drop shot would have
won her the point.
"My problem is that I some
times get too creative and play
stupid instead of just getting the
job done," Poruri said. "I get too
caught up in hitting different
shots instead of doing it because

it works. In a way, I can be a flake
on the court."
She is practicing on mentally
focusing throughout a match but
plays her best when that blends
with her tennis instincts. She
knows what she can do to hurt
people and lets her body go from
there.
"Sometimes in a match I'll
think about music and different
things," Poruri said. "That will
get me into a rhythm and I'll play
well when I'm not thinking
specifically about every shot.
"This year Frank and (assis
tant coach) Lele (Forood) have
helped me," she said. "When I've
gone out to lunch they'll refocus
me and tell me to do what
works."
Poruri holds a 21-1 singles
record this year and her exquisite
shotmaking skills translates to
success in doubles as well. She
and Willens form the Cardinal's
top tandem. The combination of
styles is a strange harmony of
boxing and ballet.
The fourth-ranked pair in the
nation is most effective when Wil
lens takes the ball early and
crushes the return.
As the server comes into net
and tries to dig Willens' bullet off
her shoetops, Poruri slides to the
middle of the court, anticipating a
weak pop-up. When the ball floats
over the net, Poruri is there to
snap the point-winning volley.
Not only does their doubles
game benefit from the contrast
ing but complimentary styles, but
also a close camraderie, which
has grown this season.
"It's nice to have a friend who
can get you up or take over when
things aren't going well," Poruri
said.
"When one's feeling down, the
other gets her motivated."
One of the big incentives for
both of them in 1992 has been a
dream to face each other in the
NCAA singles final.

"Obviously it's a huge dream,"
said Willens, who is ranked No. 3
nationally. "We joke about it all
the time.
"When we're playing and I hit
a winner, she's like, 'Match point,
NCAAs!" she said.
"It's an inspiring thought,"
fourth-ranked Poruri said. "It
makes us more motivated. It's
great for practice matches
because it's fun and gets us
psyched. We really push each
other."
While Willens and Poruri uti
lize the friendly competition to
their advantage, it could easily
have not been the case.
In the fall, they had to battle
each other for the coveted top sin
gles slot and Willens won the
tough three-setter. A little bitter
ness may be expected after the
close match but neither would
allow it.
"I gave her a ride home after
the challenge match if that tells
you anything," Willens said.
"Any good player wouldn't let
it affect them. It definitely is hard
but if you're really friends you
wouldn't let that interfere."
In past years, tension had
developed among some of Stan
ford's best players. Willens and
Poruri recognize that it would be
a detriment to the squad to carry
the rivalry too far.
"We realize our position on the
team," Poruri said. "We want to
contribute as much as possible."
To underscore the group focus,
both Poruri and Willens name
winning the NCAA team title as
their top priority this year.
But in the back of their minds,
they can envision a match for the
singles crown.
"I feel like Laxmi and I are one
and the same," Willens said. "We
have the same goals . . . We'd be
happy for the other person if they
won."
So even with contrasting styles,
they aren't so different after all.


Mimi Kuo — Daily
Cardinal junior Heather Willens
(above) and sophomore Laxmi
Poruri (left) have stamped
Stanford tennis with their own
unique styles. Willens has used
a tough and gritty approach to
carve out a No. 3 national rank
ing. Creativity has long been a
forte of Poruri, the fourth
ranked singles player in the
country. She tests the bound
aries of her game by constantly
trying to add new shots to her
repertoire.The disparate styles
fuse in doubles as the pair has
been ranked in the top five
most of the season.
