## Researcher offers plan to silence noise from the Shoreline Curious atmospheric phenomenon bounces concert music back down towards annoyed Palo Alto neighborhood 
### Nick Strauss 
Stanford students may know it
as a source of summer evening
fun, but to many Palo Alto resi
dents the Shoreline Amphitheater
is a nighttime nuisance.
Noise from the popular concert
venue has been disturbing resi
dents of Palo Alto since Bill Gra
ham Presents opened the facility
in 1986, but a Stanford radio sci
ence researcher says he may have
a simple solution.
Despite the three mile dis
tance, a curious atmospheric phe
nomenon known as a tempera
ture inversion traps sound com
ing from the open air stage and
directs it toward the quiet, wood
ed backyards of Palo Alto.
During the summer months
(ironically, the prime concert sea
son) a layer of dense air will form
over the South Bay at about 1,000
feet altitude.
As sound escapes the
amphitheater, it disperses
upwards into the air until reach
ing this dense layer, which gradu
ally bends or refracts it until it is
headed towards the ground. After
"bouncing off" the inversion
layer, these sound waves touch
ground again in the region
between Interstate 101, Middle
field Road, University Avenue
and the Oregon Expressway.
The sound of a Shoreline con
cert in this area is 10 decibels
louder than the ambient noise
level, a difference we perceive as
twice as loud. New Kids on the
Block and Depeche Mode won the
dubious honor of drawing the
most complaints in the past con
cert season.
After some unsuccessful legal
action, Palo Alto residents turned
to consultants to establish the
nature of the ducting phe
nomenon and search for solu
tions.
The two most effective propos
als are, however, very drastic —
rotating the stage and seating so

that the sound is directed else
where (over the Bay) or complete
ly enclosing the amphitheater
bowl with a stadium-like roof.
Both are prohibitively expensive,
the rotation with a price tag of
about one million dollars and the
dome ten times that.
Stanford radio science
researcher Ivan Linscott says he
believes he has a high-tech solu
tion to solve the problem for a
fraction the cost of other propos
als. He proposes to apply active,
adaptive noise cancellation on an
unprecedented scale to solve the
nagging stray sounds of the
Shoreline.
Sound is a wave composed of
regions of thick and thin air —
compressions and rarefactions —
spreading spherically outward
from a source much like the peaks
and troughs of a wave in water.
By filling in the rarefactions and
emptying the compressions, the
wave's amplitude — or volume —
can be reduced.
Active noise cancellation uses a
computer-generated sound wave to
cancel out the undesired sound in
exactly this way. The generated
wave's compressions match the
target's rarefactions and vice versa.
Generating this out-of-phase
signal is the key to successfully
canceling the offensive sound. For
a number of years, this technique
has been in use to quiet every
thing from heavy machinery to
Lexus luxury cars.
The principles are not new, but
what makes Linscott's proposed
application unusual is its outdoor
location. The special wave must be
very precisely calculated and
aimed to completely cancel the tar
get sound, and the complex acous
tic environment of outdoor set
tings makes this task exceedingly
difficult unless the sound is con
fined to a fairly narrow volume.
Linscott, however, feels that
the rather unique situation of
Shoreline makes ANC practical, if
not simple. All the sound headed

for the annoyed Palo Alto resi
dents passes through a small
area, perhaps twelve feet in diam
eter, located about 1,000 feet up.
Locating microphones near the
stage and placing a cluster of
speakers and amplifiers just out
side the seating perimeter and
aimed up at this sound bottleneck
should solve the problem.
He said a simple computer, no
more powerful than an IBM PC or

Macintosh, could control the
entire system.
If reality were this simple,
nothing else would be needed.
The atmosphere is rather compli
cated, however. Variances in the
inversion layer would change the
degree of refraction imposed on
the sound waves, and turbulence
cells add a scattering effect to the
bending. This dynamic nature
demands adaptive cancellation,

fitting itself to the changing con
ditions.
Microphones, located in the
Palo Alto neighborhoods where
the sound "lands," would feed
back to the computer, which
would then alter the direction,
phase and volume of the canceling
wave it generates.
Surprisingly, Linscott claims
this could all be built using off
the-shelf equipment.

Linscott proposes to study the
possibility of his scheme by play
ing test tones from Shoreline and
analyzing the results in Palo Alto,
thus revealing if the sound duct is
as simple as it seems and if active,
adaptive noise cancellation would
indeed work.
The cost of the whole system —
hardware, design, and construc
tion — could be as little as
$100,000.

about one million dollars and the
dome ten times that.
Stanford radio science
researcher Ivan Linscott says he
believes he has a high-tech solu
tion to solve the problem for a
fraction the cost of other propos
als. He proposes to apply active,
adaptive noise cancellation on an
unprecedented scale to solve the
nagging stray sounds of the
Shoreline.
Sound is a wave composed of
regions of thick and thin air —
compressions and rarefactions —
spreading spherically outward
from a source much like the peaks
and troughs of a wave in water.
By filling in the rarefactions and
emptying the compressions, the
wave's amplitude — or volume —
can be reduced.
Active noise cancellation uses a
computer-generated sound wave to
cancel out the undesired sound in
exactly this way. The generated
wave's compressions match the
target's rarefactions and vice versa.
Generating this out-of-phase
signal is the key to successfully
canceling the offensive sound. For
a number of years, this technique
has been in use to quiet every
thing from heavy machinery to
Lexus luxury cars.
The principles are not new, but
what makes Linscott's proposed
application unusual is its outdoor
location. The special wave must be
very precisely calculated and
aimed to completely cancel the tar
get sound, and the complex acous
tic environment of outdoor set
tings makes this task exceedingly
difficult unless the sound is con
fined to a fairly narrow volume.
Linscott, however, feels that
the rather unique situation of
Shoreline makes ANC practical, if
not simple. All the sound headed

for the annoyed Palo Alto resi
dents passes through a small
area, perhaps twelve feet in diam
eter, located about 1,000 feet up.
Locating microphones near the
stage and placing a cluster of
speakers and amplifiers just out
side the seating perimeter and
aimed up at this sound bottleneck
should solve the problem.
He said a simple computer, no
more powerful than an IBM PC or

Macintosh, could control the
entire system.
If reality were this simple,
nothing else would be needed.
The atmosphere is rather compli
cated, however. Variances in the
inversion layer would change the
degree of refraction imposed on
the sound waves, and turbulence
cells add a scattering effect to the
bending. This dynamic nature
demands adaptive cancellation,

fitting itself to the changing con
ditions.
Microphones, located in the
Palo Alto neighborhoods where
the sound "lands," would feed
back to the computer, which
would then alter the direction,
phase and volume of the canceling
wave it generates.
Surprisingly, Linscott claims
this could all be built using off
the-shelf equipment.

Linscott proposes to study the
possibility of his scheme by play
ing test tones from Shoreline and
analyzing the results in Palo Alto,
thus revealing if the sound duct is
as simple as it seems and if active,
adaptive noise cancellation would
indeed work.
The cost of the whole system —
hardware, design, and construc
tion — could be as little as
$100,000.

Stanford students may know it
as a source of summer evening
fun, but to many Palo Alto resi
dents the Shoreline Amphitheater
is a nighttime nuisance.
Noise from the popular concert
venue has been disturbing resi
dents of Palo Alto since Bill Gra
ham Presents opened the facility
in 1986, but a Stanford radio sci
ence researcher says he may have
a simple solution.
Despite the three mile dis
tance, a curious atmospheric phe
nomenon known as a tempera
ture inversion traps sound com
ing from the open air stage and
directs it toward the quiet, wood
ed backyards of Palo Alto.
During the summer months
(ironically, the prime concert sea
son) a layer of dense air will form
over the South Bay at about 1,000
feet altitude.
As sound escapes the
amphitheater, it disperses
upwards into the air until reach
ing this dense layer, which gradu
ally bends or refracts it until it is
headed towards the ground. After
"bouncing off" the inversion
layer, these sound waves touch
ground again in the region
between Interstate 101, Middle
field Road, University Avenue
and the Oregon Expressway.
The sound of a Shoreline con
cert in this area is 10 decibels
louder than the ambient noise
level, a difference we perceive as
twice as loud. New Kids on the
Block and Depeche Mode won the
dubious honor of drawing the
most complaints in the past con
cert season.
After some unsuccessful legal
action, Palo Alto residents turned
to consultants to establish the
nature of the ducting phe
nomenon and search for solu
tions.
The two most effective propos
als are, however, very drastic —
rotating the stage and seating so

that the sound is directed else
where (over the Bay) or complete
ly enclosing the amphitheater
bowl with a stadium-like roof.
Both are prohibitively expensive,
the rotation with a price tag of
about one million dollars and the
dome ten times that.
