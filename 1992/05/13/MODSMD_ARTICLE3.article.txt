# Sanders goes for shot at gold
## 'The most difficult decision I've ever had to make': All-America swimmer swaps eligibility for funds 
### Brian Egan Editorial Staff 
All-America swimmer Summer
Sanders announced yesterday
that she is giving up her final two
years of collegiate eligibility to
train full-time for the 1992 Sum
mer Olympics.
"This is by far the most diffi
cult decision I've ever had to
make," Sanders said. "It's a real
shame. . .but I feel like there are
certain opportunities that come
about once in a lifetime."
By foregoing her final two
years of National Collegiate Ath
letic Association eligibility,
Sanders will qualify immediately
for funds underwritten by the
United States Olympic Commit
tee and United States Swimming.
She is also free to pursue com
mercial endorsement opportuni
ties, and has already signed with a
representative agency, Advantage
International.
Sanders said she plans to con
tinue her studies at Stanford
after the Olympics.
Stanford women's swimming
coach Richard Quick said he sym
pathizes with Sanders' decision to
leave. Sanders "is in a position
right now that happens only once
every four years, and to very few
swimmers," he said. "We definite
ly support her in her decision."
Sanders becomes the second
Cardinal women's swimming All-
America in the past two years to
leave school early. Last year, sopho

more Janet Evans left the Farm
due to what she felt were restrictive
NCAA practice time regulations.
Sanders, however, stressed that
her decision was not related to the
NCAA practice restrictions. "I
have no problem with [the practice
rules]," she said. "[Evans] proba
bly trains more than anyone else I
know. I knew that if I wanted to
get in more training, I could."

Sanders will forego
her final two years
of eligibility, but

Leland said he was frustrated by
the entire eligibility question.
NCAA rules prohibit collegiate
athletes from receiving most
kinds of funding.
"I wouldn't call the rules
archaic," said Leland, "but I

In her two seasons at Stanford,
Sanders compiled a list of achieve
ments and awards that ranks her
with the greatest swimmers in
Stanford history.
The American record-holder in
both the 200 and 400 meter indi
vidual medley, Sanders was
named NCAA Swimmer of the
Year in 1991 and 1992, her only
two seasons of competition.

This year,
Sanders won
three individual
NCAA titles —
200 IM, 400 IM
and the 200
meter butterfly
— in helping
Stanford win its
first NCAA
women's swim-

ming crown since 1988-89. The
sophomore qualified for the '92
Olympics in all three events, along
with the 100 meter butterfly.
Riimors about Sanders' depar
ture had been circulating ever
since a report published April 28 in
USA Today indicated that the Car
dinal star was considering turning
professional.
Sanders, who was doing alti
tude training in Flagstaff, Ariz, at
the time, said that she made up
her mind while in Arizona. "I was
by myself, and I sat down and
decided what I was going to do. It
was a gut feeling. . . .1 do best

In her two seasons at Stanford,
Sanders compiled a list of achieve
ments and awards that ranks her
with the greatest swimmers in
Stanford history.
The American record-holder in
both the 200 and 400 meter indi
vidual medley, Sanders was
named NCAA Swimmer of the
Year in 1991 and 1992, her only
two seasons of competition.

This year,
Sanders won
three individual
NCAA titles —
200 IM, 400 IM
and the 200
meter butterfly
— in helping
Stanford win its
first NCAA
women's swim-

ming crown since 1988-89. The
sophomore qualified for the '92
Olympics in all three events, along
with the 100 meter butterfly.
Riimors about Sanders' depar
ture had been circulating ever
since a report published April 28 in
USA Today indicated that the Car
dinal star was considering turning
professional.
Sanders, who was doing alti
tude training in Flagstaff, Ariz, at
the time, said that she made up
her mind while in Arizona. "I was
by myself, and I sat down and
decided what I was going to do. It
was a gut feeling. . . .1 do best
when I go with my gut feeling."
