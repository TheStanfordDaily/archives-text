# Sanders goes for shot at gold
## 'The most difficult decision I've ever had to make': All-America swimmer swaps eligibility for funds 
### Brian Egan Editorial Staff 
All-America swimmer Summer
Sanders announced yesterday
that she is giving up her final two
years of collegiate eligibility to
train full-time for the 1992 Sum
mer Olympics.
"This is by far the most diffi
cult decision I've ever had to
make," Sanders said. "It's a real
shame. . .but I feel like there are
certain opportunities that come
about once in a lifetime."
By foregoing her final two
years of National Collegiate Ath

Sanders will qualify immediately
for funds underwritten by the
United States Olympic Commit

Sanders becomes the second
Cardinal women's swimming All-

NCAA practice time regulations.
Sanders, however, stressed that
her decision was not related to the
NCAA practice restrictions. "I
have no problem with [the practice
rules]," she said. "[Evans] proba
bly trains more than anyone else I
know. I knew that if I wanted to
get in more training, I could."
But Athletic Director Ted

Sanders will forego
her final two years
of eligibility, but
plans to continue
her studies here
after the Olympics.

Leland said he was frustrated by
the entire eligibility question.
NCAA rules prohibit collegiate
athletes from receiving most
kinds of funding.
"I wouldn't call the rules
archaic," said Leland, "but I
regret that we can't work better
(with Sanders) through the exist

Quick agreed with Leland.
