: After drinking heavily and passing
ff lout, I usually feel poorly rested
Vy regardless of how long I've been
unciWscious. Is passing out different from
falling asleep? If not, why do I feel so crap
py when I wake up? (Is it just the alcohol
in my system?)
— Missy D.
A: Most people asking a question like
yours would proceed to ask me what
they could do to alleviate the symp
toms of habitual drinking binges. You,
however, seem perfectly content with the
inevitable consequences of your dissipated
lifestyle.
After exhausting the Charlie Brown
Encyclopedia's treasure trove of knowl
edge on the subject of sleep, I consulted
Dr. William Dement and Dr. Alex Clark,
both high honchos at the Sleep Disorders
Clinic at Stanford Medical School.
Passing out, Dement informed me, is
the pharmacological induction of sleep. In
addition to being a social lubricant and
laboratory solvent, alcohol is also a biolog
ical depressant. Hence, the loss of con
sciousness that occurs when you have a
few too many shots of tequila after your
twelve-pack is fairly similar to what hap
pens when you take sleeping pills.
Neither sleeping pills nor alcohol, how
ever, are likely to cause you to pass out
unless you have accumulated a sleep debt,
Dement continued.
Therefore, if you're running on
Twinkies™, No-Doz™ and two hours of fit
ful napping (like far too many of us here at
Stanford), drinking is more likely to
decommission you than if you're getting
ten hours of sleep every night like your
parents.
Other than its cause, the process of
passing out isn't all that different from
the ordinary onset of sleep. The sleep that
results, however, differs in a crucial way.
Alcohol, according to Dr. Clark, tends to
fragment your sleeping period and pre
vent the most restful parts of sleep.
The drunken quasi-coma that follows a
wild night of partying, driving the porce
lain bus and finally crawling off into the
corner to collapse is not as sound as one
might think. The sleep of an intoxicated
person is punctuated by brief periods of
arousal (mental, not sexual — sorry)
which may occur as frequently as once per
minute and last as long as five seconds
each.
These periods of arousal are not quite
wakefulness, as they don't last long
enough to be perceived by the drunken sot
in question. However, the brain activity of
the subject during these "microarousals,"
as monitored on a electroencephalogram
(EEG), is clearly not that of a restfully
sleeping individual.
You might ask, "So what?" After all, if
you stay in bed for ten hours and only

sleep fifty-five seconds out of every
minute, you're still racking up more than
nine hours total slumber. So why is this
drunken sleep less restful than nine hours
of ordinary sack time?
As it turns out, sixty one-minute sleeps
just don't compare to a full hour. A sleep
er undergoes cycles of brain activity that
last a few hours each. The depth of sleep is
most shallow at the beginning and end of
these cycles, and most profound near the
middle.
This deeper sort of sleep — called
"delta sleep" due to the shape of a sleep
er's EEG during this period — is the most
important kind for recovery of higher
mental function and the achievement of
what you might call "restedness."
Unfortunately, if you're only sleeping a
minute or so between arousals, as is the
case when you consume a good deal of
alcohol before sleeping, you never make it
to the delta phase of sleep. Consequently,
you awaken in the morning feeling groggy,
disoriented and cranky — almost as if you
hadn't slept at all.
Which, in some sense, you hadn't.
Incidentally, in response to the
unasked question I alluded to up in the
first paragraph, I don't think that medical
science has discovered a way to help peo
ple sleep well after they pass out. The sit
uation reminds me of a stupid joke that I
will now impose upon the reader:
A patient walks into his doctor's office.
"Vhat zeems to be ze trouble?" he asks
her Teutonically.
"Doctor, it hurts whenever I do like
this," she answers, twisting her arm into
an innovative position behind her back.
"Can you help me?"
"Ja, of course. Don't do like zat any
more." Ba-dump (sssh)!
Hmm ... curious.

Chris Patil can't help it; he was born that
way. Drop questions for him in the Bug
Box, located just outside The Daily offices
near the western entrance of the Storke
Publications Building.
