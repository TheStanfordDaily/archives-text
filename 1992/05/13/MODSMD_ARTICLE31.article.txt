# Rainforests threatened by burning
## Time is running out to save the forests, according to expert 
### Markley Bavinger 
All of the world's tropical rainforests will be destroyed
within 55 years if the current rate of deforestation contin
ues, according to Dr. Norman Myers, an internationally
known expert on the ties between development and the
environment.
In his May 5 lecture at Kresge Auditorium titled "Trop
ical Forests â€” Can Politicians Stop the Burning?" Myers
addressed the effects and causes of mass deforestation and
called for quick action.
"We have a chance to save the rainforest," Myers said,
"and no people in the future will have this chance again. If
we fail, all they will have left is to pick up the pieces."
Half of the world's rainforests have already been
destroyed, but as Myers pointed out, the other half still
remains.
In these remaining forests are some of nature's most
incredible creations, he said. According to Dr. Myers' esti
mates, tropical rainforests hold 70 to 90 percent of the
world's species. The loss of these species will have a great
impact on the course of evolution.
With the extinction of each species, there is also the dan
ger that plants of invaluable medicinal properties are being
lost forever.
Currently, 25 percent of the goods bought in the drug
store owe their creation to "startpoint materials" of rain
forest origin.
It can only be assumed that countless other medical
mysteries have cures growing under the forest's canopy, he
said.
The carbon stored in the biota of the rainforest is
released into the atmosphere in mass quantities when cat
tle ranchers and small scale agriculturalists burn the
forests to clear the land, he said, and these common prac
tices release 30 percent of the world's emissions of carbon
dioxide, contributing to the greenhouse effect.
The tragedy of losing these biological resources has not
been enough to end the destruction. Neither has the profits

from exporting rainforest products which is an industry
worth $22 billion a year.
These are not considerations of the peasants who have
been displaced from the traditional farmlands and who,
Myers said, "feel the need to drive off with their matches
and machetes to the only remaining unpopulated land, the
rainforest."
Rainforest countries account for two thirds of the
world's population growth. These booming populations
result in droves of peasants pushing into the unclaimed
lands of the forest in search for grazing pastures and fields.
These "shifted cultivators," as Myers called them, account
for over half of the forests' destruction.
Land is cheap in these countries and as more and more
peasants push deeper into the forest, hundreds of acres are
lost. Because the soils that remain when rainforests are
destroyed are poor in nutrients, the peasants soon must cut
deeper into the forest searching for arable land.
To make any sort of dent in the destruction, these social
and economic factors must be considered. "This is an
intrinsically non-forest problem that must be addressed in
a non-forest manner," Myers said.
In countries like Madagascar, where the Gross National
Product averages less than $1 a day, strict land-control
policies are not feasible. High levels of foreign debt also con
tribute to the desperation of these countries.
Myers suggested economic assistance and the forgive
ness of foreign debt as possible solutions. By his estimates,
it will take $50 billion to eliminate the motivation of these
people to destroy the forests.
To achieve this goal, Myers encouraged every individual
to make their voice heard with letters to Congress and mon
etary support of conservation groups. He said that by
spreading the word and examining our own actions to
ensure we are not indirectly supporting the deforestation,
we can all do our part.
As Myers said in closing, "We can all shed a tear when
thinking about all of this, but while shedding that tear, let's
go easy on the Kleenex."
