Tests of promising tumor drug begin
Researchers have begun tests with a promising new
compound that they hope will improve radiation treat
ment of tumors.
The medication, called SR 4233, acts by killing the oxy
gen-starved cells that may enable tumors to resist radia
tion therapy and some chemotherapy, according to Radia
tion Oncology Prof. J. Martin Brown.
These oxygen deficient cells convert SR 4233 into a
highly toxic compound, which in turn kills these cells and
enhances the effectiveness of radiotherapy.
The compound had been synthesized for experimental
use in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Tracy at SRI Inter
national of Menlo Park. The compound has no other
known uses and would be relatively inexpensive to manu
facture, according to Tracy.
The current study will test whether the drug is effec
tive and also the optimal dose.
Adults with tumors that conventional radiation thera
py is unlikely to cure are eligible for the study.
Ten patients have already enrolled in the study.
Another 15 to 20 patients are expected to sign up.
Initial clinical testing of SR 4233 is also being conduct
ed at the University of Glasgow in Scotland and Harvard
Medical School. The test is being sponsored by Sterling

Winthrop Inc. of New York, an international manufactur
er of pharmaceuticals and consumer health products.
Tay-Sachs testing today and tomorrow
Personnel from the Northern California Tay-Sachs
Disease Prevention Program will offer free carrier detec
tion testing today and tomorrow.
The blood test takes approximately five minutes and
the results will be mailed to the respondents.
Tay-Sachs Disease is a recessively inherited genetic
disorder which causes destruction of the nervous system,
resulting in rapid deterioration of physical and mental
capabilities.
Being a carrier of Tay-Sachs has no adverse effects on
the health of the individual, but when both parents are
carriers of the Tay-Sachs gene, there is a 1 in 4 chance
with each pregnancy that the child will be born with the
disease.
Carrier rates in the general population are approxi
mately 1 in 150. The American Jewish population has a
particularly high carrier rate of about 1 in 30.
Tests will be offered today and tomorrow at the Old
Union Clubhouse from 11 a.m. - 2 p.m. and tomorrow
from 8-10 a.m. in Room M-112 at the Medical Center and
from 5-7 p.m. in Room 58 at the Business School.
