# Can 'Studs' help students date?
## TV dating show take-off brings Lagunita together 
### Robert Milk 
Freshman Tom KO has a
vision for the University's future.
For anyone who has complained
about dating at Stanford, KO's
ideas to "institutionalize" the pro
cess may be the answer.
Inspired by the popular late
night television show, KO sees
"Studs" as a possible solution to
students' dating woes, as well as a
way to build community.
Although KO's long-term goal
is to coordinate a campus-wide
"Studs" game, he decided to start
with a slightly more manageable
task, and planned a well-received
version of the "Studs" program —
with student contestants — that
premiered last week in Lagunita.
KO, a Naranja resident who
spells his last name with two cap
ital letters, decided that since
"there were so many people
watching the 'Studs' show on TV
every night, I thought that bring
ing the show to the dorms would
be a very positive experience."
The game "is not merely about
six people going on dates," he
said. "It's also about the commu
nity coming together to have fun
watching the show."
The Lagunita "Studs" pro
gram, which drew more than 100
people in Naranja's lounge last
Thursday night, was the success
ful first step in KO's vision.

And, judging from the direc
tion the show took, late-night
television isn't the only place to
find half-baked sexual innuendo
and barroom humor.

freshman Leo Kroonen.
In accordance with the rules of
the television show, Kroonen then
had to guess (blushingly) which
studette had made that comment
about their evening together.
Freshman Emma Luevano,
who introduced herself as being
"turned on by almost any guy,"
was quick to explain that she and
Kroonen had played a video game
in which dueling cavemen
attempted to annihilate each
other.

Luevano said she was excited
at the way the program was
received. "Everyone was cheer
ing," she said. "I've never seen so
many people in this lounge before
— in any lounge. All of Lagunita
was together talking. It was an
extremely unifying experience."
The show was funded by four
of Lagunita's five dorms — Uja
maa, Naranja, Eucalipto and
Granada — from which the six
contestants were chosen.
Like the television show, each
of the three male contestants —
called "studs" — had to arrange
separate dates with the three
female contestants — "studettes"
— before the show. That arrange
ment broke from the format of
the television version of "Studs,"
which always requires two studs
and three studettes.
Nearly all of the studs and
studettes had not been not well
acquainted with each other before
their dates, which ranged from
rollerblading in Palo Alto to a pic
nic on Campus Drive among the
wildflowers.
The first round required the
studs to guess which studette said
a particular statement about
them. Unfortunately, sophomore
Chris "Most likely to wear argyle
underwear" Finnila failed to
guess which studette thought to
herself, "Yikers! I'm going out
with a Young Republican."

Nevertheless, Finnila redeemed
himself by guessing freshman
Kathryn "Speed turns me on"
Johnson as the studette who
exclaimed, "Too bad he lost his
balls!" in reference to a mini-golf
ing mishap.
Freshman Abdi "Most likely to
tan naked on a nude beach"
Soltani had an extremely success
ful first round.
He correctly guessed Johnson
as the studette who said "he rode
his way into her heart," alluding
to the fact that they had to bike to
dinner.
Soltani also guessed freshman
Brandee "Only real men turn me
on" Waite as the studette who
claimed, "After we experienced
pounding rhythms, we were cov

ered with salt."
Waite explained that their date
consisted of a beach trip followed
by an elegant dinner on the Bay.
During the second round, the
studettes revealed their consen
sus opinions of each stud. Kroo
nen, for instance, was voted
"Most likely to pose as a senior at
Full Moon on the Quad" and
"Most likely to serve breakfast in
bed."
Soltani, on the other hand, was
voted the stud "Most likely to be
Cosmo's bachelor of the month"
and "Most likely to use generic
condoms."
Soltani said afterward, "More
dorms should do shows like
'Studs' because you get to meet
some cool people — and get

laughed at. I only regret having
lost."
After the primaiy rounds, in
which the studs collected stick-on
hearts for correct answers, each
of the contestants secretly decided
who they'd most like to go out
with again.
When the results were
revealed, Kroonen and Johnson
were the only ones who picked
each other; they were named
"King Studs" of the show. Their
first date, Kroonen said, had been
"high intensity from beginning to
end. We started at noon and
ended at nine."
"A.m. or p.m?" someone from
the audience shouted.
The two will receive $50 to go
out on their next date.

freshman Leo Kroonen.
In accordance with the rules of
the television show, Kroonen then
had to guess (blushingly) which
studette had made that comment
about their evening together.
Freshman Emma Luevano,
who introduced herself as being
"turned on by almost any guy,"
was quick to explain that she and
Kroonen had played a video game
in which dueling cavemen
attempted to annihilate each
other.

Luevano said she was excited
at the way the program was
received. "Everyone was cheer
ing," she said. "I've never seen so
many people in this lounge before
— in any lounge. All of Lagunita
was together talking. It was an
extremely unifying experience."
The show was funded by four
of Lagunita's five dorms — Uja
maa, Naranja, Eucalipto and
Granada — from which the six
contestants were chosen.
Like the television show, each
of the three male contestants —
called "studs" — had to arrange
separate dates with the three
female contestants — "studettes"
— before the show. That arrange
ment broke from the format of
the television version of "Studs,"
which always requires two studs
and three studettes.
Nearly all of the studs and
studettes had not been not well
acquainted with each other before
their dates, which ranged from
rollerblading in Palo Alto to a pic
nic on Campus Drive among the
wildflowers.
The first round required the
studs to guess which studette said
a particular statement about
them. Unfortunately, sophomore
Chris "Most likely to wear argyle
underwear" Finnila failed to
guess which studette thought to
herself, "Yikers! I'm going out
with a Young Republican."

Nevertheless, Finnila redeemed
himself by guessing freshman
Kathryn "Speed turns me on"
Johnson as the studette who
exclaimed, "Too bad he lost his
balls!" in reference to a mini-golf
ing mishap.
Freshman Abdi "Most likely to
tan naked on a nude beach"
Soltani had an extremely success
ful first round.
He correctly guessed Johnson
as the studette who said "he rode
his way into her heart," alluding
to the fact that they had to bike to
dinner.
Soltani also guessed freshman
Brandee "Only real men turn me
on" Waite as the studette who
claimed, "After we experienced
pounding rhythms, we were cov

ered with salt."
Waite explained that their date
consisted of a beach trip followed
by an elegant dinner on the Bay.
During the second round, the
studettes revealed their consen
sus opinions of each stud. Kroo
nen, for instance, was voted
"Most likely to pose as a senior at
Full Moon on the Quad" and
"Most likely to serve breakfast in
bed."
Soltani, on the other hand, was
voted the stud "Most likely to be
Cosmo's bachelor of the month"
and "Most likely to use generic
condoms."
Soltani said afterward, "More
dorms should do shows like
'Studs' because you get to meet
some cool people — and get

laughed at. I only regret having
lost."
After the primaiy rounds, in
which the studs collected stick-on
hearts for correct answers, each
of the contestants secretly decided
who they'd most like to go out
with again.
When the results were
revealed, Kroonen and Johnson
were the only ones who picked
each other; they were named
"King Studs" of the show. Their
first date, Kroonen said, had been
"high intensity from beginning to
end. We started at noon and
ended at nine."
"A.m. or p.m?" someone from
the audience shouted.
The two will receive $50 to go
out on their next date.

"Studs" Thurs
day in Naranja.
"Studs" is a
take-off of a TV
dating game
intended to
pump life into
the Stanford
social scene.
Freshman Tom KO has a
vision for the University's future.
For anyone who has complained
about dating at Stanford, KO's
ideas to "institutionalize" the pro
cess may be the answer.
Inspired by the popular late
night television show, KO sees
"Studs" as a possible solution to
students' dating woes, as well as a
way to build community.
Although KO's long-term goal
is to coordinate a campus-wide
"Studs" game, he decided to start
with a slightly more manageable
task, and planned a well-received
version of the "Studs" program —
with student contestants — that
premiered last week in Lagunita.
KO, a Naranja resident who
spells his last name with two cap
ital letters, decided that since
"there were so many people
watching the 'Studs' show on TV
every night, I thought that bring
ing the show to the dorms would
be a very positive experience."
The game "is not merely about
six people going on dates," he
said. "It's also about the commu
nity coming together to have fun
watching the show."
The Lagunita "Studs" pro
gram, which drew more than 100
people in Naranja's lounge last
Thursday night, was the success
ful first step in KO's vision.

And, judging from the direc
tion the show took, late-night
television isn't the only place to
find half-baked sexual innuendo
and barroom humor.

senseless like the Neanderthal
that he is!" sophomore Jason Van
