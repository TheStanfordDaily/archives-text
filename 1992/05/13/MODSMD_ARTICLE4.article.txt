# It's just the luck of the Draw
## Students go to bizarre lengths at annual lottery

Clustered around a charred rubber duck,
several men are chanting.
Another group of students sits in a circle,
solemnly rubbing the sacrosanct tummy of a
green Buddha candle.
In front of a green and yellow box, five
women try to glean good vibes from a fern plant.
No, it's not a conference of eclectic religious
sects — just a typical day at the annual housing
lottery, the Draw, in Tresidder Union. Every
year, anxious students go to bizarre lengths to
determine where they will live the following year.
Many students said they were nervous
about their housing prospects, but others
seemed to take it all in stride.
"It's not a matter of whether we want to
live in Kimball or not. We are going to live in
Kimball," said freshman Young Lee, minutes
before drawing his number.
His comments after picking number 1132?

"Okay, so we'll call our rooms Kimball. We'll
pretend, you know, delude ourselves a little,"
Lee said. "After all, it's better than Soto."
Not surprisingly, Kimball Hall and the new
Manzanita residences were the top choices on
most Draw cards, according to Bill Georges,
acting director of the Housing Center.
There were no significant shifts in the rank
ing of the other choices following the "big
three," he said.
The addition of the new residences also means
that 204 more people can be housed next year.
Last year, roughly 3,875 guaranteed and
unguaranteed undergraduates participated in
the Draw. Of that number, 3,540 were
assigned housing, according to Barbara Klein-
Schoder, undergraduate housing supervisor.
About 250 people signed last year's waiting
list and all walk-ons were assigned to resi
dences, according to Georges.
Although next year's freshmen will receive

four years of guaranteed housing,
they will lose out on some Draw
traditions.
Due to budget cuts, participants
in next year's Draw will say goodbye
to colorful mantras and lute-playing
rituals as the Draw is replaced by
Axess, the on-line computer system.
According to Georges, students
will enter their housing choices
directly into the computer
through Axess.
A computer program will then
assign random numbers to students

in the course of a few days. Students
will also use Axess to accept their
assignments or join wait lists.

'There won't be any
excitement. We
won't get to watch
people laugh or cry.'
—Astrid Palmieri

Sophomore Astrid Palmieri
said Axess will take all the fun out
of the Draw.
"There won't be any excite
ment," she said. "We won't get to

watch people laugh or ciy. Using
computers will just take away from
the ambiance of the whole thing."
"What about tradition?" junior
Jake Becker asked. "Computers
make sense, but you don't have
the human factor anymore."
As another consequence of
budget cuts, the Draw has not had
a theme for the past two years.
Previously, Draw themes ranged
from baseball to the movies.
One year, at "Drawland," the
group that drew the worst num
ber received donated tickets to
Disneyland. Without a theme this
year, there won't be any prizes to
take the sting out of choosing
number 5,000.
