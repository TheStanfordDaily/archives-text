# Latvian president stops by Hoover
## Gorbachev criticized in speech 
### John Ford Staff writer 
Just two days after former Sovi
et President Mikhail Gorbachev's
visit, the Hoover Institution yester
day hosted another of the world's
political reformers: Latvian Presi
dent Anatolijs Gorbunovs.
In his short address to a lun
cheon crowd at the Hoover Memo
rial Building, Gorbunovs touched
on a number of the challenges fac
ing his country, including upcom
ing parliamentary elections, main
tenance of a true Latvian ethnici
ty, transition to a market econo
my and the desired withdrawal of
Soviet troops from Latvia.
Gorbunovs, who was elected
president and chairman of the
Supreme Council of the Republic
of Latvia in 1990, encouraged
Western investment in his newly
democratic country.
Speaking in Latvian through a

interpreter, Gorbunovs said:
"Latvia, being a smaller country,
can serve the West as a model for
their attempts to conquer the
markets of the Commonwealth of
Independent States."
One reason for Gorbunovs'
visit, Hoover Senior Fellow
Richard Staar said in an inter
view, was to "awaken interest" in
Latvian economic opportunities.
Besides addressing the econom
ic necessities of his country, Gor
bunovs talked of its current politi
cal problems. Lamenting the
"deliberate Russification of Latvia
organized by the Communist
Party," Gorbunovs spoke of the
need to maintain a national identi
ty "so that [Latvia] will not disap
pear from the world's ethnic map."
In a question and answer ses
sion, Gorbunovs criticized Gor
bachev for not recognizing the
independence of the Baltic states.
Gorbunovs added that although
he has a good relationship with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
it "does not mean that we don't
have contradictions."
Staar said he understood Gob
unovs' wariness of Russia, noting
that the Russian military may be
"thinking in terms of a future war."
Staar added that he was
impressed with Gorbunovs' per
formance.
"I think he's a very good
spokesman for his country," he
said.
As part of his trip to Stanford,
Gorbunovs will meet with two Lat
vians who are currently enrolled in
the Hoover Institution Diplomat
Training Program.
Gorbunovs also plans to meet
with a number of Stanford stu
dents who are concerned with his
country's problems, including stu
dents from the Center for Russian
and East European Studies, the
Graduate School of Business, Stan
ford in Government International
and Students for East European
Democracy.
