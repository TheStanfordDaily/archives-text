# No major budget cuts for Biz School
## 
### Kim McCreery Staff writer 
Despite the University's $43
million shortfall, the Graduate
School of Business has only had
to shave four percent of this
year's working budget, compared
to up to 30 percent in other
schools and departments.
No layoffs are planned and no
academic programs will be lost,
according to Cathy Castillo, direc
tor of news and publications for
the Business School.
Next year's $1,000 tuition hike
is not due to budget shortfalls,
but mirrors past increases, Castil
lo said. Financial aid will be unaf
fected. However, Castillo said

tuition and financial aid may be
significantly affected in future
years.
The Business School has weath
ered the budget crisis well for sev
eral reasons, Castillo said. As a
"formula school," it generates its
own income and runs its own
admissions and financial aid offices.
In addition, the school has not
been hit as hard by two of the main
causes of the University's financial
crisis: earthquake repairs and cuts
in federal funding.
Although being a formula
school has given the Business
School a certain amount of inde
pendence in managing its own
budget, the University has the
final word.
The Business School receives
no general funding from the Uni
versity, but pays a fee each year to
cover expenses for services such as
utilities and grounds maintenance.
The Law and Medical Schools have
similar arrangements.
The University increased the
Business School's fee by about $1
million last year, prompting the
school's four-percent cut.
But instead of trimming aca
demic programs, the school will
simply try to work more efficient
ly, Castillo said.
"We're combining recruiting
trips, eliminating redundant ser
vices, reusing material and things
like that," she said. "We're just
doing everything we can to not
affect the academic programs."
In addition, the number of

executives attending summer pro
grams, currently at 600, may be
increased to raise revenue. While
admitting more students has been
discussed, Castillo said class size
will remain at about 350 next year.
The Business School has also
been able to retain all of its 140
full- and part-time faculty and has
no plans for cuts in the near future.
"The Business School grew rela
tively slowly compared to the rest of
the University," Castillo said. "We
kept the size of the faculty tied veiy
closely to the number of students,
so we haven't had to cut down."
In addition, the Business
School has been able to handle
both earthquake repairs and cuts
in federal funding better than
other sectors of the University.
The Loma Prieta earthquake
caused more than $130 million in
damages to the University and
$7.4 million to the Business
School. Instead of letting the Uni

versity cover the repairs, the
Business School paid for the dam
ages out of its own endowment
and now does not have to con
tribute to general repairs.
And while many departments
are struggling to make up for a 20
percent cut in government research
money, the Business School has
never been dependent on federal
funds.
The Business School has not
only saved itself from budget reduc
tion, but it is offering new courses
and adding a $20 million program.
Despite its four percent budget
cut, the Business School adminis
tration decided to proceed with
plans it had made earlier, instead
of putting them off until later,
Castillo said.
"The things we thought were
important are still important,"
she said. "We will just have to find
new ways to pay for them."
Thanks to a $3 million gift

from the Sloan Foundation, the
Business School is joining with
the School of Engineering next
year to offer the first doctoral
degree in manufacturing in the
United States. The program is
expected to cost about $20 million
over the next 10 years. Most of
the money will come from corpo
rate and alumni gifts.
Most students said they haven't
notice any changes resulting from
the cuts. Many said the $1 million
increase in the school's annual
payment to the University is fair.
"I don't think it's unfair for
any area at Stanford to help out
another area," said first-year stu
dent Ross Jones.
"There needs to be support
from the stronger branches to
help out through a difficult time,"
he added. "I don't think you could
have Stanford Business School
stand alone without the rest of
the University."

schools and departments.
No layoffs are planned and no
academic programs will be lost,
according to Cathy Castillo, direc
tor of news and publications for
the Business School.
Next year's $1,000 tuition hike
is not due to budget shortfalls,
but mirrors past increases, Castil
lo said. Financial aid will be unaf
fected. However, Castillo said

tuition and financial aid may be
significantly affected in future
years.
The Business School has weath
ered the budget crisis well for sev
eral reasons, Castillo said. As a
"formula school," it generates its
own income and runs its own
admissions and financial aid offices.
In addition, the school has not
been hit as hard by two of the main
causes of the University's financial
crisis: earthquake repairs and cuts
in federal funding.
Although being a formula
school has given the Business
School a certain amount of inde
pendence in managing its own
budget, the University has the
final word.
The Business School receives
no general funding from the Uni
versity, but pays a fee each year to
cover expenses for services such as
utilities and grounds maintenance.
The Law and Medical Schools have
similar arrangements.
The University increased the
Business School's fee by about $1
million last year, prompting the
school's four-percent cut.
But instead of trimming aca
demic programs, the school will
simply try to work more efficient
ly, Castillo said.
"We're combining recruiting
trips, eliminating redundant ser
vices, reusing material and things
like that," she said. "We're just
doing everything we can to not
affect the academic programs."
In addition, the number of

executives attending summer pro
grams, currently at 600, may be
increased to raise revenue. While
admitting more students has been
discussed, Castillo said class size
will remain at about 350 next year.
The Business School has also
been able to retain all of its 140
full- and part-time faculty and has
no plans for cuts in the near future.
"The Business School grew rela
tively slowly compared to the rest of
the University," Castillo said. "We
kept the size of the faculty tied veiy
closely to the number of students,
so we haven't had to cut down."
In addition, the Business
School has been able to handle
both earthquake repairs and cuts
in federal funding better than
other sectors of the University.
The Loma Prieta earthquake
caused more than $130 million in
damages to the University and
$7.4 million to the Business
School. Instead of letting the Uni

versity cover the repairs, the
Business School paid for the dam
ages out of its own endowment
and now does not have to con
tribute to general repairs.
And while many departments
are struggling to make up for a 20
percent cut in government research
money, the Business School has
never been dependent on federal
funds.
The Business School has not
only saved itself from budget reduc
tion, but it is offering new courses
and adding a $20 million program.
Despite its four percent budget
cut, the Business School adminis
tration decided to proceed with
plans it had made earlier, instead
of putting them off until later,
Castillo said.
"The things we thought were
important are still important,"
she said. "We will just have to find
new ways to pay for them."
Thanks to a $3 million gift

from the Sloan Foundation, the
Business School is joining with
the School of Engineering next
year to offer the first doctoral
degree in manufacturing in the
United States. The program is
expected to cost about $20 million
over the next 10 years. Most of
the money will come from corpo
rate and alumni gifts.
Most students said they haven't
notice any changes resulting from
the cuts. Many said the $1 million
increase in the school's annual
payment to the University is fair.
"I don't think it's unfair for
any area at Stanford to help out
another area," said first-year stu
dent Ross Jones.
"There needs to be support
from the stronger branches to
help out through a difficult time,"
he added. "I don't think you could
have Stanford Business School
stand alone without the rest of
the University."
