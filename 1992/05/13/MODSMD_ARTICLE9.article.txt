## 
### Holly Hacker Senior staff writer 
Cowell Student Health Center
will begin its anonymous HlV
antibody testing and peer coun
seling program Monday, Cowell
officials said.
The anonymous testing and
peer counseling will be an alterna
tive to confidential testing, in which
a student receives pre- and post
test counseling from a physician
who knows the student's name.
Under the new program, a stu
dent will make an appointment
under a fictitious name to see one
of three peer counselors.
"I just don't know what to
expect in terms of the demand for
this," said Health Promotion Pro
gram Director Carole Pertofsky,
who helped organize the program.
"We don't know whether
there's a whole population who
hasn't come here because they
think (the test result) is going in
their medical record," said Cowell

staff physician John Dorman,
adding that neither anonymous
nor confidential test results
become part of a student's record.
Dorman said he has asked stu
dents who come in for confiden
tial testing whether they would
prefer to be tested anonymously
and counseled by a peer instead of
a physician.
"I've had various responses
ranging from 'Definitely yes' to
'No' to 'Whoever's available
first,' " he said.
According to Pertofsky, one
purpose of the program is "to raise
awareness that getting tested isn't
just for people in a high risk behav
ior group. If anybody has been sex
ually active, they should be tested."
Anonymous testing is available
by appointment only, with test
results available in five to 10 days.
California state law requires all
HIV testing sites to provide both
pre- and post-test counseling.
Each counseling session is typical
ly between 15 and 30 minutes.
