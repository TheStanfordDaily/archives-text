# Plans for housing on Knoll outlined
## 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
Two new undergraduate resi
dences — one a revamped version of
the Suites and the other a Row
style house — will be proposed to
the University Cabinet today by the
Office of Residential Education.
The new dormitories, which
will be located on the Knoll, are
scheduled to open in 1994, pending
the Board of Trustees' approval.
Their planned construction
allowed the University to guaran
tee four years of housing for next
year's freshmen.
Robin Hensley, Res Ed's new
housing coordinator, said an
advisory group had examined the
results of a student housing sur
vey — and analyzed yearly Draw
results — and determined that
students have "a stronger inter
est in suite-type living" than the
University currently meets.
The Suite-style residence
would house about 110-120 stu
dents, while the Row-style resi
dence would house about 60-70,
Hensley said. They would have
separate dining halls, but would
be linked by a common kitchen.
The new houses will not be
environmentally focused, as a
group of students had proposed
earlier in the year. Instead, Hens
ley said, the houses will attempt
to incorporate "environmentally
forward" elements into its design.
Alice Supton, Res Ed's direc
tor, said these elements may
include the use of natural sun
light and energy-efficient build
ing materials, but added that the
plans are not yet finalized.
Res Ed had been hesitant about
recommending an environmentally
focused dorm, Supton said,
because the house would be depen
dent on student interest that may
wane after its construction.
She said that although Res Ed
wanted to be as "environmentally
sensitive as good economics and
the site allows," the office had to
"take a long view."
"The prudent thing to do is be
responsive to student interests, but
also realize that those interests
may change over time," Supton
said.
Hensley said Res Ed is "trying
to do something new" with the
planned Suites' structure by incor
porating some elements of com

munity-based living into the typi
cally individualistic design of
suites.
The new suites, Hensley said,
would consist of "groupings of
individual bedrooms with a small
shared living room," but would
also be "connected in ways that
enhance the ability to build the
community as a whole."
The plans are still in the con
cept stage and may still be modi
fied by the Cabinet and the
trustees before they are
approved, Hensley said.
Supton said Res Ed had recog
nized the unmet demand for
suite-style housing, but was also
concerned about some students'
criticisms that the Suites are not
interactive enough.
On surveys, Supton said, stu
dents indicated that they wanted

more "educational and multicul
tural programming" in the
Suites, as well as more interac
tion with others.
The design of the planned
Suites, she said, would attempt to
bridge that gap by having more
common meeting rooms and a
layout that encourages students
to drop in at others' suites.
The new dorms' shared kitchen,
Hensley said, would be "different
from any we have on campus" by
allowing for more student access
and giving students the "potential
for co-management."
The kitchen would be open to
students — similar to the
arrangement in self-ops and Eat
ing Clubs — and students may
also be able to take a more active
role in determining which meals
are served, Hensley said.
