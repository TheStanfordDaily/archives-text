## Goodbye, Mr. Ricks 
### 
Multicultural educator's
pioneering performance
a difficult act to follow

WHEN THE University's
first multicultural educa
tor announced his decision
to leave Stanford yesterday, many
answered the loss of an inspira
tional community-builder with
disappointment.
As his colleagues praise Greg
Ricks' dedication to encouraging
interaction between racial groups,
they must look to the future and
channel their energies into search
ing for a successor who will best
utilize the foundation Ricks has
erected.
Three years ago, Ricks took on a
primarily conceptual position that
lacked concrete roles and defini
tions. With the goal of establishing
communication with students and
bringing a racially polarized com
munity together, he successfully
"put meat on a skeleton," as Assis
tant Dean of Students Keith
Archuleta said.
Ricks firmly established his role
as a highly visible motivator who
not only spoke to students, but lis
tened to them as well. Through his
Residential Education programs
and the countless hours he spent
talking to students, he was able to
begin breaking down divisive barri
ers between different communities.
While national interracial ten
sions at the time of the Rodney
King verdict tested the success of
Ricks' work, the fruits of his
efforts were evident in Stanford's
response.
The Stanford community coa
lesced recently in the wake of a
national crisis and produced well
organized, peaceful rallies and
marches attended by hundreds of
students of all ethnic groups.
And of course, Ricks was there
from the initial march to the Palo
Alto police station to the teach-ins,
a central figure who inspired and

educated students.
Perhaps Ricks' philosophy is best
embodied in one of his residential
education programs, "Crossing the
Line." This program asks students
to group themselves by various cri
teria, from gender to child abuse
experiences.
"Crossing the Line" shows stu
dents that they derive their identi
ties from a variety of sources
which are not mutually exclusive.
Through residential education
programs and his effectiveness as
an inspirational role model and
advisor, Ricks has set the ground
work for achieving closer relation
ships between ethnic communities.
As Associate Director of Resi
dential Education Ann Porteus
said, "Greg was like no other in his
ability to get different groups con
nected and talking together."
Yet it is questions of identity
provoked by programs like "Cross
ing the Line" that Ricks' successor
will have to address. Ricks himself
said there is still much to be done,
and the next step is to "break
down the monoliths" of large eth
nic categorizations and take a clos
er look at individuals.
A logical starting point for Stan
ford's second multicultural educator
would be to focus on subsets of the
"monolithic" groups and the diversi
ty hidden within categorizations
such as "white," "black" or "Asian."
Ricks also outlined other areas
that he hopes his successor will
tackle, including widening the
scope of multiculturalism.
In addition to racism and homo
phobia, classism and sexism must
also be recognized and dealt with,
Ricks said.
Because budget cuts have limit
ed staff and funds, the new multi
cultural educator will have to be
able to work creatively to maxi
mize resources and protect multi
cultural institutions on campus
from further cuts.
Ricks has left a difficult legacy to
follow. Now the burden is on the Uni
versity to choose a successor who will
continue the progress that he has
achieved in the past three years.
