New York has more than its share of racist incidents

IN RESPONSE TO Greg Siegel's let
ter in Tuesday's Daily suggesting
that New York's mostly silent reac
tion to the Rodney King verdict implies
hope: I am a New Yorker and I remem
ber the white Saint John's students get
ting off after being accused of raping an
African-American woman.
Like the King case, the media
thought it was open and shut; the white
youths admitted to almost everything
except their guilt.
As a New Yorker, I remember Gavin
Cato being crushed to death by a care
lessly driven car in Crown Heights, and
the driver not even being fined.
Cato was an African-American child,
while the driver was of a different eth
nicity.
As a New Yorker, I remember the

Loyal Order of Hiberion being allowed to
prohibit gay, lesbian and bisexual Irish
organizations from marching in the
Saint Patrick's Day parade.
I remember Elenor Bumpers, an
elderly African-American woman
gunned down through her door by police
officers.
I remember the forced sterilizations
of Latino and African-American women
in the '70s.
I remember Patrick Moynihan's
racist report on African-American fami
lies.
I remember the houses burnt down in
Astoria and the racial phone calls pre
ceding the incidents.
I remember riding through the South
Bronx every evening on my way home
from school, I remember the corners

between 97th and 98th Street and Park
Avenue — high income apartment hous
es with garages looking out over a burnt
out lot, shanty town and tenement pro
jects. The line is that sharp, that simple.
When New York is silent, at best it is
because New York is worn out, tired,
internally too hurt to respond and at
worst it is because New York knows
uncurbed, unjustified discrimination is
part of its everyday. New York is not try
ing, New York is numb.
During the Persian Gulf invasion,
100,000 people marched the streets of
San Francisco — that's one-seventh of
its population that got out and got politi
cal.
Many more people disagreed with the
King verdict than with the decision to go
to war.

If one-seventh of New York mobi
lized, even peacefully mobilized — that's
over one million people — injustices like
the King verdict and the system of dis
crimination and violence allowing such
injustices to take place would never
thrive as the status quo of American life.
If, as Siegel suggests, "This is all too
painful to watch," remember that there
are people who don't have the luxury of
lying back and watching.
King doesn't need to watch the video
tape to know the system is messed up.
What needs to happen is less looking
for glimmers of illusionary hope in histo
ries of complacency and more active
restructuring of the situations we all
inherit.
