# Spirituality offers way out of racial animosity
## 
### 
A new poll in the May 11 New York
Times exclusively focused on employ
ment opportunities and police training
as solutions to the problem of rioting
and racial tension.
In that poll, 68 percent of the Ameri
cans surveyed thought that race rela
tions were "bad" and 53 percent thought
there would always be racial discrimina
tion in this country.
Noticeably absent from most of the
dialogue in the media concerning
these issues is a solution, which,
although it may be less than popular
in a modern college setting, neverthe
less holds the only proven hope for an
answer.
It is a spiritual solution to the race
issue. Racism will never be healed unless
and until we overcome our collective fail
ure to recognize the spiritual principle of
the oneness of the human race.

By "spiritual," I mean something that
is grounded in the belief in a higher uni
fying principle, more commonly known
as God.
It really doesn't matter what you call
it. Without the recognition of a higher
"something" that transcends our physi
cal differences, there is no compelling
reason to see other human beings as
equals.
The concept of God, from from being
an irrelevant outdated idea, is the key to
the entire solution.
We make this claim as members of
the Baha'i faith, is a community of some
six million members representing every
nationality and race on the planet.
The unity that exists within such a
diverse group of people is a living exam
ple that the spiritual principle of the
oneness of humanity is not just a Utopi
an ideal, but can be put into practice.
The example of the Baha'i community
demonstrates that the powerful influ
ence of religion cannot be ignored in our
quest for a solution to the national
catastrophe of racism.
