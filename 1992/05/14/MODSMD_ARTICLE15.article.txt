# Message of Christian group degrades queers
## 
### 
Tonight, Campus Crusade for Christ,
Cornerstone, Parakleo and Tabletalk are
sponsoring an "ex-lesbian" speaker in
Kresge Auditorium.
As members of the campus communi
ty, we are appalled that four Stanford
affiliated organizations are sponsoring
"Homosexuality 101," an event that
both implicitly and explicitly degrades
and denigrates gay, lesbian and bisexual
individuals.
While we firmly acknowledge and
respect the First Amendment rights of
the speaker and the organizations
involved, we assert that the sentiments
being conveyed are neither benign nor
educational; rather the "message" is an

assault on queer students, faculty and
staff at Stanford.
Anti-gay religious groups often claim
that they are attacking "homosexuality"
but not the "homosexual."
However, the conception of sexual ori
entation as merely a "lifestyle" or a set
of sexual practices is a misleading and
diminutive representation of lesbian, gay
and bisexual identities.
The individual and her or his sexual
orientation are indivisible. The desire to
exterminate "homosexuality" is there
fore a desire to exterminate "homosexu
als." Undeniably, this aim is bigoted and
hateful.
We encourage all people — straight,
gay, religious, non-religious — to come
to this program and evaluate for them
selves the accuracy of the speaker's
claims and the implications of this ideol
ogy for lesbian, gay and bisexual people.
