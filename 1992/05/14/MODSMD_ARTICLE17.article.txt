## Free speech and hate speech 
### 
£ MAR, YOUR . .. ah, message
I I here. ... I mean your fuckin'
editorial thing in The Daily. . . .
It's fucking bullshit, you're fucked
up. . . . You really are off the deep end,
you fucker."
Some gentle, eloquent soul left this
message on my answering machine
recently. Sadly, he chose not to leave his
name and so I am unable to credit his
engaging criticism of my column.
But if the fellow had been kind enough
to leave his name I wonder if I could nail
him under the recent speech code enact
ed at Stanford. This message was one of
several unpleasant calls I received, and
I'm curious if these anonymous messages
would qualify as protected speech or ver
bal harassment, intellectual discourse or
acts of aggression.
Even if I could nail the guy, I still have
some problems with the revised interpre
tation of the Fundamental Standard. The
new policy is based on a Supreme Court
ruling called "fighting words doctrine."
In simplest terms it states that some
words are sooooo bad that they are equiv
alent to starting a fight.
The problem with hate speech is not
that I'm going to go berserk after the
magic words are uttered, but rather that
I will feel intimidated into inaction.
Another legal principle called the
"hostile work environment" captures the
problem much better for me. In several

court cases, everything from the posting
of nudie calendars to the hanging of con
federate flags has been seen as a violation
of civil rights law. One person's "free
speech" can create an atmosphere so
unpleasant it denies equal opportunity to
work for women or people of color.
What the various groups who bear the
brunt of such hate speech want is equal
opportunity to study and learn at Stan
ford. People can fight racist or sexist
speech with protests, letters and
columns, but no one should have to.
Clearly, free speech is more important
in a university workplace than in the
average office, but the same basic right to
be free from harassment should remain.
Also, the context and target of various
expressions are important to how much
leeway people should have. In a classroom
we probably want as few restrictions on
speech as possible, but what about a
dorm, a hallway or a student's room?
It seems to me that each of these
spaces deserves a different standard. A
dorm — and especially a dorm room — is
like a home, and people have to have
some place on campus they can retire to
and feel secure. People need to be chal
lenged, but not at every waking moment.
Another point is that we don't all have
equal access to free speech. California Gov.
Pete Wilson has numerous opportunities
to make himself heard, gay rights activists
don't. Also, if an expression has a one hun

dred year history, then there really isn't
anything one can say or do that responds
with equal impact. What could a gay man
say in response to "Faggot, I hope you die
of AIDS" that would have the same punch?
A few nasty answering machine mes
sages didn't throw my life into a tailspin,
but I did worry about leaving the dorm
after I got that call. Walking around cam
pus that afternoon I feared someone as
kindhearted as the fellow on my answer
ing machine might try to attack me. Am I
paranoid? Perhaps, but I think that's my
prerogative.
For most students, the Stanford expe
rience is simply an opportunity to learn.
No one should have to fight for a place to
study in peace. Open expression is crucial
to a university and we must create an
atmosphere that fosters robust debate,
but harassment is a reality.
Whether people choose to acknowl
edge it or not, the Fundamental Standard
has always been a speech code. It
demands that Stanford students treat
each other with respect and that's all any
of us want — just a little bit.
