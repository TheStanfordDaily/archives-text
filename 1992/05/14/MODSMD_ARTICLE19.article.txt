## O'Brien set for title run 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
This year, the men's tennis team has established
itself as a pack of fighters who win by gutting out
tough matches, rather than by overwhelming oppo
nents with untouchable talent or skill.
The exception to this generalization is senior
co-captain Alex O'Brien. The three-time All Amer
ican has won tournaments, broken records and
basically dominated his opponents all season. But
this is not to say that O'Brien is not a fighter.
"Alex has the ability to figure out, 'Hey, if I'm
not playing my best, how can I stay in the match?'
He's been around long enough and he is tough
enough to do that," explained head coach Dick
Gould. This is precisely why O'Brien has been so
successful and why he should continue to win
matches when the team begins NCAA Champi
onship competition this weekend in Athens, Ga.
After losing in the semifinals of the NCAA sin
gles competition last year, O'Brien had a success
ful summer in challenger tournament action. The
senior boosted his confidence by winning the ATP
Challenger Pilot Penn Classic in New Haven,
Conn, and playing in several other big-money
tournaments, including the U.S. Open qualifier.
"I started believing that I could really play with
guys at the top level," O'Brien explained. He fol
lowed his summer with a victory at the Volvo All-
America Collegiate tournament in October, which
placed him at the top of the collegiate rankings.
Success has had its price though, as O'Brien
soon found out. "After the summer I thought I
should just kill everyone in collegiate tennis," he
said. "But then I realized that I had to play one
game at a time, just like in every other match."
Being the "guy to beat" all season tested
O'Brien's mental tenacity, but the senior has held
up well, rarely losing his concentration, or a
match. If O'Brien can sustain his mental edge dur
ing the next two weeks, Gould feels that he can
win it all.
"Alex has certainly handled the pressure he
imposed on himself by winning the Volvo. If he
goes out to win the tournament he could be in
trouble, but if he goes out to win a match he'll be

it may not be a real Texas 10-gallon hat, but Amarillo native Alex O'Brien has lofty hopes
for the men's tennis team, expectations worthy of the Lone Star State. Says the senior,
"I definitely think we can win the NCAA Tournament."
fine," Gould said. M He has a great
ability to adapt — he can serve
and volley, he can stay back. He
just has to be mentally alert to be
able to know what to do."
O'Brien also feels his strength
lies in his overall ability to play
the game rather than in one or
two particularly deadly shots.
"I'm really solid all around,"
he explained. "I don't give oppo
nents weaknesses to exploit. I'm
not like Dave Goss (Cardinal vol
leyball All American) talent-wise,
I'm just a solid competitor."
So, although he is hailed as one
of the big guns of collegiate ten
nis, O'Brien considers his
strengths to be similar to those of
his scrappy teammates.
"We're just a bunch of fighters
and we're going to have to pull off
some big matches next week to
win the tournament, but I defi
nitely think we can," he said.
"The team has come a long way."
"I never thought we'd be No. 1
(Stanford was), I never thought
we'd be seeded second going into
NCAAs (Stanford is), and I never
thought we'd win the tourna
ment. Hopefully we'll do that,
too."
O'Brien's title ambitions have
enabled him to take on an effec
tive team leadership role this sea

son. At times, the senior has
become openly frustrated with
the play of his teammates.
O'Brien's doubles partner, sopho
more Chris Cocotos, has often
been on the receiving end of
O'Brien's biting remarks.
"I know it's a nightmare for
Chris sometimes because I'm
really hard on him and he gets
fed up with me. Its just 'cause I
know what he can do," O'Brien
explained. "When he plays his
best tennis we can beat any
one."
Hopefully, the duo will play
their best this weekend. With
three NCAA tournaments and
two national team titles under his
belt, O'Brien's experience should
help him.
"I know what to expect and I
won't try to overreact and play
better than I can." He paused for
a moment, and then continued
softly. "But sometimes, you
know, you get that feeling, like
you can't do anything wrong. I've
gotten that feeling at the tourna
ment for three years now. . .1 just
hope I get that feeling again
soon," he chuckled.
With four long years of Cardi
nal tennis almost behind him, the
American Studies major from
Amarillo, Texas, is ready to move
on.
"I want to reach that next
level. I came into college tennis
and worked my way up," he said.
"Now I just want to go play tour

naments (on the professional
tour) and try to get points."
This is an interesting change of
events for a guy who did not even
have a coach in high school and
never played more than three
times a week until he reached
Stanford.
"I didn't go to those tennis
camps or anything. I basically had
fun and did whatever," he
explained.
"Playing professional tennis
definitely wasn't at the top of my
list of things to do."
But with his acceptance to
Stanford, everything changed. "I
wasn't even going to apply here
because I didn't think I could
make the team. My serve was a
joke and my volleys weren't any
good. But with [Gould and assis
tant coach John Whitlinger's]
help, I got better and better."
Next year, playing tennis for
the Cardinal could become a fam
ily tradition if O'Brien's younger
sister, who will be a freshman at
Stanford next fall, tries out for
the women's team.
While the Stanford star works
his way through the NCAA tour
ney this weekend, his sis' will be
fighting her way through the
Texas State high school tourna
ment.
And when all the competition
is over, maybe the O'Brien
seniors will each have a title to
take with them as they move on
next year.
