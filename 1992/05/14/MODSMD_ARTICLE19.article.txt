## O'Brien set for title run 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
This year, the men's tennis team has established
itself as a pack of fighters who win by gutting out
tough matches, rather than by overwhelming oppo
nents with untouchable talent or skill.
The exception to this generalization is senior
co-captain Alex O'Brien. The three-time All Amer
ican has won tournaments, broken records and
basically dominated his opponents all season. But
this is not to say that O'Brien is not a fighter.
"Alex has the ability to figure out, 'Hey, if I'm
not playing my best, how can I stay in the match?'
He's been around long enough and he is tough
enough to do that," explained head coach Dick
Gould. This is precisely why O'Brien has been so
successful and why he should continue to win
matches when the team begins NCAA Champi
onship competition this weekend in Athens, Ga.
After losing in the semifinals of the NCAA sin
gles competition last year, O'Brien had a success
ful summer in challenger tournament action. The
senior boosted his confidence by winning the ATP
Challenger Pilot Penn Classic in New Haven,
Conn, and playing in several other big-money
tournaments, including the U.S. Open qualifier.
"I started believing that I could really play with
guys at the top level," O'Brien explained. He fol
lowed his summer with a victory at the Volvo All-
America Collegiate tournament in October, which
placed him at the top of the collegiate rankings.
Success has had its price though, as O'Brien
soon found out. "After the summer I thought I
should just kill everyone in collegiate tennis," he
said. "But then I realized that I had to play one
game at a time, just like in every other match."
Being the "guy to beat" all season tested
O'Brien's mental tenacity, but the senior has held
up well, rarely losing his concentration, or a
match. If O'Brien can sustain his mental edge dur
ing the next two weeks, Gould feels that he can
win it all.
"Alex has certainly handled the pressure he
imposed on himself by winning the Volvo. If he
goes out to win the tournament he could be in
trouble, but if he goes out to win a match he'll be

it may not be a real Texas 10-gallon hat, but Amarillo native Alex O'Brien has lofty hopes
for the men's tennis team, expectations worthy of the Lone Star State. Says the senior,
"I definitely think we can win the NCAA Tournament."
