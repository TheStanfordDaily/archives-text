# Looking for local solutions to racial
## Programs for E. Palo Alto are the focus 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
Several Stanford students are
attempting to establish new pro
grams in East Palo Alto to help
the disadvantaged community
and heal some of the divisions
caused by the verdict in the Rod
ney King beating trial.
"We're the beginning of the
next revolution," said Priya Haji,
one of the central organizers of
the Community Action Coalition,
which is organizing programs
ranging from a community cul
tural and educational center to a
voter registration drive.
Haji said she and other orga
nizers saw a need, following the
King verdict, to make long-term
plans for improvement and
change in East Palo Alto.
The goal of the coalition, Haji
said, is to empower the city's
youth and give them access to
additional education.
Other programs the coalition
plans to sponsor include a book
drive, a cleanup day, HIV educa
tion efforts and an expanded Big
Sibling/Little Sibling program,
Haji said.
According to junior TraCy
Clay, one of the organizers of
Stanford's King protest move
ment, the coalition had originally
hoped to use a part of the closed
Ravenswood High School build
ing as the center of its communi
ty service projects.
However, community leaders
in East Palo Alto already have
plans for the site, Clay said, adding
that relations between Stanford
activists and leaders in the city
have traditionally been strained.
In the past, Stanford students
dictated rather than listened,
causing a lot of "bad blood"
between the two communities —

which may be a nagging problem
for the current project, Clay said.
However, a meeting that was
held the Saturday following the
verdict was promising: Haji said
it was attended by several East
Palo Alto community leaders,
and suggestions were made to
establish formal ties between the
community and Stanford.
The goal of the meeting, Haji
said, "was to come in and listen
to what the community wanted
and to match that with what we
had to offer as far as labor and
other things were concerned."
Larry Thompson — the execu
tive director of Links to Positive
People in East Palo Alto and one
of the leaders who attended the
meeting — praised the efforts
made by the coalition so far.
"I certainly think it can work,"
he said, but added: "It's going to

have to be a collaborative effort
between agencies in East Palo
Alto and Stanford students."
Haji hopes to find a final site for
the center by September. The plan
for it includes classes that would
be team-taught by groups of Stan
ford students, and after-school
and enrichment programs such as
tutoring and painting murals.
Classes would run every night
from about 4 p.m. to 9 p.m., and
the topics would range from per
sonal finance to African-Ameri
can history.
Haji said there may also be a
GED program in conjunction
with an already existing program
at the Youth Development Cen
ter in East Palo Alto.
"Our idea is not to undermine
anything anyone else is doing,
but to include" existing pro
grams, Haji said.

Several of the Community
Action Coalition's short-term
programs are already in progress.
A book drive has begun to
build a community library that
will supplement East Palo Alto's
library. Books were collected last
Friday in White Plaza and will be
collected again this Friday. In
addition, boxes have been set up
in dorms and across campus.
The group is storing book dona
tions, which are being accepted
from students, the Bookstore and
other sources, in Ujamaa's Black
Cultural Library. They will be
moved to the Youth Development
Center in East Palo Alto until a
permanent building is found.
A fund-raising campaign
began over the weekend, with
more than $600 raised so far.

About 15 students gather in a Meyer Library room last night to discuss their plans for a possible com
munity cultural center in East Palo Alto. Discussion of the project is one of the many ways the Stan
ford community has responded to the Rodney King beating verdict.
