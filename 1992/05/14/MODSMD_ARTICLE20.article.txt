## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
After six hours Stanford's
opponent in today's second round
was determined. The No. 16 Mis
sissippi Rebels edged the No. 17
San Diego Toreros for the oppor
tunity to face the Cardinal at 3
p.m.
Paloma Collantes started Mis
sissippi off with a 6-2, 6-2 victory
over Laura Richards at No. 1, but
the rest of the lineup was falter
ing.
"When I finished I looked over
at the other courts and we were
down in every one," said Col
lantes, who is ranked No. 6 in the
nation. "But we made some come
backs in a few matches."
With No. 5 Sharla Barone the
only one other Rebel notching a
victory, Mississippi needed to
sweep doubles to advance to the
round of 16 — and did. In both
the No. 2 and No. 3 doubles San
Diego took the first set 7-5 but
could not hang on against the
Rebels.
"Our doubles are much
stronger than before," Collantes
said.

grooved."
