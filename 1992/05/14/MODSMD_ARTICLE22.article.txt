# Summer Sanders: doing it for the money without selling out
## 
### 
Oh no! Summer Sanders is leaving
too? Every time we turn around,
another of our beloved Stanford
star athletes is foregoing his or her ama
teur status. Bob Whitfield did it. Janet
Evans did it. And now Summer?
When the news comes out that an ath
lete is leaving school early to pursue a
professional career in his or her sport,
most people think, "Don't do it! You can't
give up the best years of your life like
this!" For instance, Evans left Palo Alto
last year because she had differences with
coach Richard Quick and the new NCAA
rules which limited the amount of hours
per week an athlete could practice; sever
al people believed she was making a huge
mistake.
Sanders, however, did the right thing
in choosing to give up her eligibility.
Yes, she is leaving for the money. Peo

ple will criticize her for it and say that she
shouldn't be lured away from the experi
ences of collegiate life and the education
al opportunities at Stanford just because
it's a financial windfall for her.
But it's the smartest decision that she
could have made. First, she immediately
qualifies for several monetary awards: a
$1,500-a-month stipend from US Swim

ming; a $2,500 monthly check from the
US Olympic Committee (available for top
medal hopefuls, which Sanders certainly
is); and a $2,500 bonus given to top-eight
finishers in Barcelona.
More importantly, she can accept offers
from companies for paid endorsements
now whereas she couldn't as a collegiate
swimmer due to NCAA regulations.
Sanders' visibility and popularity will
grow from now until the Olympics have
ended, and she is wisely capitalizing on
that to sign contracts now.
If she handles business matters as well
as she handles the media, she should be
very well-off.
One statement that Sanders made
stands out most of all, however.
"I'm going to come back here and fin
ish school," she said.
She will reportedly take off immedi

ately to continue her intense training
regimen for the Olympics, and then after
Barcelona take fall quarter off and return
to school in the winter. She is getting the
best of all worlds — she can travel to the
Olympics, make money from endorse
ments, and still enjoy life as a college stu
dent at Stanford.
The only loser in this situation, it
would seem, is the Stanford women's
swimming program. This is the second
celebrated Olympic swimmer that has
left the program to train, and Sanders
has arguably had even more success than
Evans.
She is the American record holder in
the 200 and 400 meter individual medley,
and she has been named the NCAA
Swimmer of the Year each of the two
years she has competed at the collegiate
level. She is a legitimate, big-time star,

and it will hurt the program for her to be
gone.
But by the same token, Stanford
swimming will benefit from her increased
exposure. Obviously her success will
reflect well on the program and Quick,
and it will bring some good p.r. to the
school as well (especially when she says
she's coming back to finish her studies).
Sanders said it best herself: "I feel
there are options out there for me that
happen once in a lifetime."
This is quite an opportunity for her,
and although Stanford swimming and
the whole community will miss her dear
ly, we wish her the best of luck.

On the converse side, George gave up his
remaining quarter of collegiate eligibility
and has no endorsement contracts what
soever.
