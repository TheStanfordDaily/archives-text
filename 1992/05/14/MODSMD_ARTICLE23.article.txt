# Coast to coast, three men who show long distance dedication

### Nick Clements Staff writer 
It's pretty easy for a middle-distance runner to go
through a successful college career in virtual anonymi
ty. Middle-distance runners don't exactly challenge
Bob Whitfield in physique, and when they train
around campus, they look like any other, um, jogger.
"I'm not a jogger. I'm a runner," said Fred
Carter. "I hate that when people say 'Oh, are you
going JOGGING???"'
Carter, Dave Scudamore, and Gary Stolz are part of
a middle-distance core this year on the Stanford track
and field team that has consistently outrivaled their
opponents, albeit without much attention due to the
relatively low status most fans give track and field.
Carter, who runs the 3000 meter steeplechase,
will be gunning for an NCAA qualifying time at the
Pacific 10 Championships in Eugene, Ore. next

weekend. Scudamore,
who runs the 10,000
meters, has already qual
ified provisionally for
NCAAs and plans to run
faster in Eugene, "the
track capital of the Unit
ed States" according to
Carter. Stolz, who runs
the 5,000 and 10,000

meters, will be attempting to qualify in both events.
Scudamore, a senior majoring in biology and his
tory who is also pre-med, came into Stanford as one
of the top national recruits in cross country. He
quickly established himself as the top freshman in
the conference in cross country. However, he
incurred a stress fracture at the World Cross Coun
try Championships and when he returned for his
sophomore year, he said it was "really a struggle." It
wasn't until the second part of his junior year in
track that "things started coming around."
This year, though, Scudamore scored big at the
Penn Relays when he went out with a fast pack and
ran a provisional qualifying time of 29:21.03 in the
10,000 meters.
"There's a very good chance that it'll be up to
Gary and I to set the pace in Eugene," said Scud
amore. "We work together until the last two laps.
But then, it's pretty much every man for himself."
Carter, as well, has had a somewhat rocky road
during his four years at Stanford. At Pac-10 Cham
pionships his sophomore year, he broke his arm for

'Running is so beneficial to
the mind and body. I don't
think I'll ever give it up.'

the second time in his collegiate career during the
steeplechase. Hoping to regroup for his junior year,
he split his knee open in his first steeplechase event
of the year.
"That's one track season I just wanted to throw
out the window," said Carter.
This year, though, Carter has gotten on track. At
Penn, he ran a personal best in the steeplechase with
a time of 8:54.45. Right now, he is approximately 12
seconds away from qualifying for NCAAs, but he
should have an excellent shot in Eugene. Four ath
letes in the Pac-10 have already qualified automati
cally and three have qualified provisionally, meaning
the race will be very fast.
"Eugene is the place to run," said Carter.
Middle and long-distance runners find themselves
at a crossroads right now in collegiate track and field.
Scholarships and staffing are being continuously cut,
and the scholarships that are available often go to

foreign students who are
older, more experienced,
and come from cultures
that value running as a
sport more than in the
United States.
Carter and Scud
amore hope that Ameri
cans will begin to appreci
ate running as a sport, as

most other countries do. Scudamore said that when
he went to the World Cross Country Championships
in Europe, 240 people watched the live broadcast.
"Part of the reason Americans don't appreciate
track and field is that they're not exposed to it," said
Scudamore. "I know that when I was growing up my
heroes were baseball and basketball players."
The refusal of most Americans to recognize run
ning as a sport is confounding to collegiate runners.
"Every sport consists of running. Running is the
purest sport I can think of," said Carter. "The only
thing that has changed since the beginning of time
in running is the surface of the earth and the shoes."
Carter, who will graduate this spring with a degree
in quantitative economics, says that his passion for
running kept him for quitting the sport long ago.
"One of my goals is to run with a national team.
You have to know when to say when and I'm not
ready yet," he said. "I don't think I'll ever give it up.
Running is so beneficial to the mind and body.
"You just learn to take everything with a grain of
salt and keep on running."

States long-distance runners. The majority of distance scholarships awarded by American universities
now go to foreign athletes.
