## Rites of Passage' adds flair to well-loved sound

If it works, stay with it — but
artists should also evolve and explore.
Amy Ray and Emily Saliers, known
more commonly as the Indigo Girls,
struggled with this paradox when cre
ating their new album, "Rites of Pas
sage."
Saliers said that while the album,
released Tuesday, shows some explo
ration of their sound, they still tried
"to retain [their] heart and soul."
She and Ray "basically kept open
minds" in their approach to the pro
ject. "We listen to a lot of different
kinds of music and the influence is
apparent," Saliers explained.
Once musicians have established a
characteristic sound and name, they
try to convince listeners that they
have a whole new sound — they are
taking risks.
Too often, this "new and
improved" scheme is contrived and
forced, and listeners find themselves
longing for the good ol' days.
At first glance, "Rites of Passage"
seems to be one of the many that falls
into the evolutionary overhaul mold.
"In these 13 grooves lies a new sense
of risk-taking," the press release
promises. True, Indigo Girls fans will
notice the new ethnic and country

music influences and adventur-

ous instrumentation,
such as fiddles and J

Eastern Indian

percus
sion.

However,
Saliers said she

and Ray weren't

seeking out anything as

drastic as an evolution.
"In some of the songs, we took a
different direction and a different

style, but that's just the way it came
out," she said.
In "Rites of Passage," both Saliers
and Ray pursued independent inter
ests. They each come up with the con
cepts for their own songs. After writ
ing them, they collaborate on the final
production.
"Basically, Amy and I thought
about what kind of sound we wanted
for each of our songs, and the people

we wanted to sing and play backups,"
Saliers said.
For example, Ray decided to incor
porate an Irish Celtic influence into
some of her songs.
This folk sound is best reflected in
"Cedar Tree," which also includes the
fiddle work of Lisa Germano com
bined with some impressive acoustic
guitar tracks.
Germano's spirited tracks also add
a new sound to "Three Hits" and "Vir
ginia Woolf."
"Woolf" is a passionate and inspi
rational discussion of mortality that
successfully displays the maturity of
spirit musicians often strive for once
they have established their style and
popularity.
The song presents a comfortable
balance between their familiar style and
experimentations with new sounds.
Perhaps an even more important
balance is present in the song's con
tent. Saliers carefully walks the
tightrope between profundity and
pseudo-intellectualism: "So you know
it's all right/ Life will come, life will
go/ Still you'll find it's all right/ Some
one will get a letter to your soul."

Saliers best explained
this challenge. "We

deal with a lot of
heavy issues in a

light-hearted
way," she said.
i "We hope our

listeners will
take a journey of
their own."

The idea of the jour-

ney, of travel and search
ing, is a characteristic Indigo Girls
theme. "All of our songs are based on
personal experiences," Saliers said,
"especially travel experiences we have
when we're on tour."
Ray wrote "Chicken Man" after she
and Saliers pulled over to a junk shop
off a highway Austin, Texas and had a
conversation with the owner. "She
also wrote about the carnage on the
road," Saliers said. "Amy's really sen
sitive towards animals and it really
bothers us to see roadkill."
"Chicken Man" is an upbeat, driv
ing piece that shows off a country
influence, remaining true to its Texan
roots with a characteristic Southern

sound and riffs on the harmonica.
Another kind of journey — a
spiritual one — is presented in
"Galileo," which reflects the
familiar soul-searching melodies
of the Indigo Girls, backed by
Latin-influenced percussion: "As
the bombshells of my daily fears
explode/ I try to trace them to my
youth/ And then you had to bring
up reincarnation/ Over a couple of

beers the other night."
Amid the exploration and
experimentation, "Love Will Come
to You" seems to be Saliers' asser
tion that they can still do the old
stuff. Saliers described its "inter
twining harmonies and acoustic
character" as "very typical."
Saliers wrote the inspirational
song for a friend who suffered a
"devastating breakup": "I say love
come to you . . . Hoping just
because I spoke the words they're

true/ Because if I offered up a crys
tal ball to look through/ Where
there is now one, there will be
two."
With a dedication to remain
true to the original, Ray takes on a
wonderfully adventurous, throaty
and passionate solo cover of Dire
Straits' "Romeo and Juliet."
Listeners may be caught off
guard by the fact that, since Ray is
performing a Mark Knopfler com
position, she is singing to a
woman.
"Juliet, when we made love we
used to cry ... Julie, I'm so in
love," she belts out, in an irrever
ently courageous move.
"It was really cool because she
set out to sing the song as it was
written," Saliers explained.
The changes in the music per
haps are best traced back to the
production process. Saliers said
many regarded their choice of pro
ducer Peter Collins — of Alice
Cooper and Queensryche fame —
as "out on a limb."
"He was a really great produc
er, and he really set the stage and
direction of this album," Saliers
said, adding that they recorded in
a different studio, which had "an
old, warm feeling."
The Indigo Girls' U.S. tour
kicks off May 22 on the East
Coast, and Saliers said they will
probably head out to the West
Coast, including the Bay Area in
August.
She was open to the suggestion
of a repeat visit to Stanford, after
playing in Memorial Auditorium
two years ago.
"Sure, if the arrangements are
made," she said.
"I love that community."
Saliers seemed to avoid speak
ing in terms of evolution and
change. She skirted the issue of
future plans, saying that Ray
plans to record a solo side project
and she wants to "do some song
writing."
But their next album? "I have
no idea," she said. "Maybe a punk
rock album . .. Just kidding!"
