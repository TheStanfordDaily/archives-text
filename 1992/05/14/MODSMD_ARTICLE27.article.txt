## Rites of Passage' adds flair to well-loved sound

If it works, stay with it — but
artists should also evolve and explore.
Amy Ray and Emily Saliers, known
more commonly as the Indigo Girls,
struggled with this paradox when cre
ating their new album, "Rites of Pas
sage."
Saliers said that while the album,
released Tuesday, shows some explo
ration of their sound, they still tried
"to retain [their] heart and soul."
She and Ray "basically kept open
minds" in their approach to the pro
ject. "We listen to a lot of different
kinds of music and the influence is
apparent," Saliers explained.
Once musicians have established a
characteristic sound and name, they
try to convince listeners that they
have a whole new sound — they are
taking risks.
Too often, this "new and
improved" scheme is contrived and
forced, and listeners find themselves
longing for the good ol' days.
At first glance, "Rites of Passage"
seems to be one of the many that falls
into the evolutionary overhaul mold.
"In these 13 grooves lies a new sense
of risk-taking," the press release
promises. True, Indigo Girls fans will
notice the new ethnic and country

music influences and adventur-

ous instrumentation,
such as fiddles and J

Eastern Indian

percus
sion.

However,
Saliers said she

and Ray weren't

seeking out anything as

drastic as an evolution.
"In some of the songs, we took a
different direction and a different

style, but that's just the way it came
out," she said.
In "Rites of Passage," both Saliers
and Ray pursued independent inter
ests. They each come up with the con
cepts for their own songs. After writ
ing them, they collaborate on the final
production.
"Basically, Amy and I thought
about what kind of sound we wanted
for each of our songs, and the people

we wanted to sing and play backups,"
Saliers said.
For example, Ray decided to incor
porate an Irish Celtic influence into
some of her songs.
This folk sound is best reflected in
"Cedar Tree," which also includes the
fiddle work of Lisa Germano com
bined with some impressive acoustic
guitar tracks.
Germano's spirited tracks also add
a new sound to "Three Hits" and "Vir
ginia Woolf."
"Woolf" is a passionate and inspi
rational discussion of mortality that
successfully displays the maturity of
spirit musicians often strive for once
they have established their style and
popularity.
The song presents a comfortable
balance between their familiar style and
experimentations with new sounds.
Perhaps an even more important
balance is present in the song's con
tent. Saliers carefully walks the
tightrope between profundity and
pseudo-intellectualism: "So you know
it's all right/ Life will come, life will
go/ Still you'll find it's all right/ Some
one will get a letter to your soul."

Saliers best explained
this challenge. "We

deal with a lot of
heavy issues in a

light-hearted
way," she said.
i "We hope our

listeners will
take a journey of
their own."

The idea of the jour-

ney, of travel and search
ing, is a characteristic Indigo Girls
theme. "All of our songs are based on
personal experiences," Saliers said,
"especially travel experiences we have
when we're on tour."
Ray wrote "Chicken Man" after she
and Saliers pulled over to a junk shop
off a highway Austin, Texas and had a
conversation with the owner. "She
also wrote about the carnage on the
road," Saliers said. "Amy's really sen
sitive towards animals and it really
bothers us to see roadkill."
"Chicken Man" is an upbeat, driv
ing piece that shows off a country
influence, remaining true to its Texan
roots with a characteristic Southern


In the last Indigo
Girls concert at
Stanford, Emily
Saliers belts out
some of the vocal
harmonies and vivid
guitar rhythms that
have earned the folk
duo a growing repu
tation.
