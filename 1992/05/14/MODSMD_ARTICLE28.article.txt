# Why should I care about short hair?
## 
### 
The first thing Mikhail Gorbachev said to me
was, "Joel, I can't believe you cut your hair."
All right, maybe not. But a lot of people did
notice.
I had been "wearing my hair low" — as the hip
sters like to say — since my junior year of high
school.
I remember the day I first started growing it out. I
stopped Nick the Barber as he was opening the draw
er to take out his shears — thus gaining several key
seconds to sec the cover of the Playboy he kept hid
den there.

I turned to him and quietly pleaded, "Just leave
the back." He understood.
After six months I looked like Achilles or Ulysses
or the effeminate guy from Color Me Badd. And, sev
eral hundred bottles of conditioner later, I couldn't
help but wonder if it all happened just so I could see
an airbrushed photo of the Landers sisters.
My hair became the center of my inner being, the
first thing people noticed when I walked in a room.
Small children, thinking for a brief moment they
were Southern police officers, asked me why I had
"girl hair."
Security guards followed me around malls, allow
ing me to play the game where I pretend to shove
tube socks down my pants, and instead concentrate
really hard on that thing Catherine Bach did to her
shirts in"The Dukes of Hazzard." They never said
anything.
And everyone thought I smoked pot. I would tell


Joel Stein
Narcissus on Prozac
them I didn't, but they would just
go ahead and tell me about their
own sordid drug experiences any
way.
After a while, I was able to filter
all the information I was given and
make up cool stories about the
time I was so loaded on Quaaludes
that the cocaine kept recrystalizing
while I was trying to freebase.
They usually left me alone after
that.
As a long-haired male, I had
joined a culture. We had heroes.
Real, live, guitar heroes. We had a
history of discrimination. We had
movies and songs and secret hand
shakes we gave each other when
we passed on the street.
And the night Steinbrenner
made Don Mattingly cut his hair,
we all got together and had a good
cry.
But I never owned up to any of
those feelings. Whenever anyone
asked, I told them I grew my hair
out for "aesthetic reasons."
My parents kept asking me why
I was doing it. I told them that God
never gave his son any trouble
about his hair, and that God prob
ably was a pretty upstanding guy.
My parents told me I was Jewish.
It was one of those moments when
I wished I paid attention in
Hebrew school and learned Moses'
dad's name.
So I had no intention of cutting
my hair when I innocently
walked into Hair Internation
al at the beginning of the quarter. I
hadn't gotten a haircut since
November, and I was starting to
see the world as if I were looking
through one of those shoebox dio
ramas.
And there, unbeknownst to me,
waited my Delilah.
She looked harmless enough in
the window. Unlike most hair
dressers, her hair was all right.
'Sblood, I was wrong.
Her method was ingenious. She
told me that this huge "thinning"
scissor wasn't actually doing any
damage.

Just as I was about to question
the logic of her chosen implement
of destruction, she did that thing
they must teach on the first day of
cosmetology school: She began to
distract me.
She started asking about my
major and saying that I already
seemed to speak "English" pretty
well. And then I looked in the mir
ror.
"What's the deal with this wing
thing?"
As I reached back to show her
what I meant, I found out that this
"wing thing" was all that remained
of my four-and-a-half years of
work.
I didn't know what to do. The
guy in the mirror wasn't the guy I
had come to know and love. Mas
turbation would be like cheating
on someone. And that sort of
appealed to me.
The Abbie-Hoffmanesque im
age I had worked so long to culti
vate was gone. Instead, I had the
same hair as Florence Henderson
in the late Brady days. The same
hair as a junior-high school foot
ball player.
And while all these thoughts
were running through my head, I
found myself staring at this enor
mous black-and-white picture of a
happy, short-haired, well-adjusted
Asian boy leaning on the shoul
ders of a particularly buxom-look
ing Nordic woman.
I realized my Long-Haired Guy
Theory — based on personal
observations and the lives of Ric
Ocasek and Eddie Van Halen —
wasn't as scientific as I once
thought.
Because after four-and-a-half
years of public derision, physical
unattractiveness and that dizzy lit
tle headache thing you get when
your ponytail is too tight, I still
wasn't getting any play.
I looked up at Delilah, swal
lowed a big wad of phlegm and
said: "Might as well cut it off."
And I didn't care. For years, I fig
ured I would be destroyed if I ever
got my hair cut. That I would not
do it for a job, I would not do it for
a raise. I would not do it for grad
school, I would not do it for two
women wearing tiger-skin leotards.
But there I was, my head nearly

shorn, surrounded by several man
agers of the haircutting establish
ment, trying to convince me.
I didn't care that some part of
me had died on the floor of that
room. And it had died in a particu
larly unattractive pile of hair
which resembled Cousin Itt more
than I would have liked to admit.
So I sat there stoically, watch
ing myself becoming that "Generic
X" who I had always knew I would
wind up becoming, who I had so
long sought to avoid.
And, ironically, the short
haired guy I saw in the mirror
wasn't nearly as stable as the per
son I had once been. He wasn't as
invulnerable to the changes occur
ring around him. He also looked
younger and had a noticeably larg
er head.
And just before I left, that
happy, well-adjusted Asian boy
walked in and said he had never
got his free haircut in return for
the photo sessions with the Nordic
woman. Minutes later he walked
out, bald as a sea-mammal's
penis. And although I admired
him, in a strange way I was no
longer able to relate.
So now I'm the short-haired
guy, and when I go to eat free food
during Rush, saying things like
"he's a really good guy" or "I think
I can add a lot to the house," peo
ple take me seriously. I'm just one
dangerous step closer to the
Generic X.
Sometimes, when I walk into
the dining hall and see a guv from
the back, I get confused and think
it's me.
Maybe I don't need my hair any
more. Maybe I've learned to
express myself in other ways.
Maybe I've learned to be comfort
able with who I am.
Or maybe I just sold out.
I look back to pictures of myself
all the way from freshman year of
high school up until today, and I
feel like one of those Jim Beam
ads.
I miss the old me. But, then
again, he didn't get laid either.

help but wonder if it all happened just so I could see
an airbrushed photo of the Landers sisters.
My hair became the center of my inner being, the
first thing people noticed when I walked in a room.
Small children, thinking for a brief moment they
were Southern police officers, asked me why I had
"girl hair."
Security guards followed me around malls, allow
ing me to play the game where I pretend to shove
tube socks down my pants, and instead concentrate
really hard on that thing Catherine Bach did to her
shirts in"The Dukes of Hazzard." They never said
anything.
And everyone thought I smoked pot. I would tell


Joel Stein
Narcissus on Prozac
them I didn't, but they would just
go ahead and tell me about their
own sordid drug experiences any
way.
After a while, I was able to filter
all the information I was given and
make up cool stories about the
time I was so loaded on Quaaludes
that the cocaine kept recrystalizing
while I was trying to freebase.
They usually left me alone after
that.
As a long-haired male, I had
joined a culture. We had heroes.
Real, live, guitar heroes. We had a
history of discrimination. We had
movies and songs and secret hand
shakes we gave each other when
we passed on the street.
And the night Steinbrenner
made Don Mattingly cut his hair,
we all got together and had a good
cry.
But I never owned up to any of
those feelings. Whenever anyone
asked, I told them I grew my hair
out for "aesthetic reasons."
My parents kept asking me why
I was doing it. I told them that God
never gave his son any trouble
about his hair, and that God prob
ably was a pretty upstanding guy.
My parents told me I was Jewish.
It was one of those moments when
I wished I paid attention in
Hebrew school and learned Moses'
dad's name.
So I had no intention of cutting
my hair when I innocently
walked into Hair Internation
al at the beginning of the quarter. I
hadn't gotten a haircut since
November, and I was starting to
see the world as if I were looking
through one of those shoebox dio
ramas.
And there, unbeknownst to me,
waited my Delilah.
She looked harmless enough in
the window. Unlike most hair
dressers, her hair was all right.
'Sblood, I was wrong.
Her method was ingenious. She
told me that this huge "thinning"
scissor wasn't actually doing any
damage.

Just as I was about to question
the logic of her chosen implement
of destruction, she did that thing
they must teach on the first day of
cosmetology school: She began to
distract me.
She started asking about my
major and saying that I already
seemed to speak "English" pretty
well. And then I looked in the mir
ror.
"What's the deal with this wing
thing?"
As I reached back to show her
what I meant, I found out that this
"wing thing" was all that remained
of my four-and-a-half years of
work.
I didn't know what to do. The
guy in the mirror wasn't the guy I
had come to know and love. Mas
turbation would be like cheating
on someone. And that sort of
appealed to me.
The Abbie-Hoffmanesque im
age I had worked so long to culti
vate was gone. Instead, I had the
same hair as Florence Henderson
in the late Brady days. The same
hair as a junior-high school foot
ball player.
And while all these thoughts
were running through my head, I
found myself staring at this enor
mous black-and-white picture of a
happy, short-haired, well-adjusted
Asian boy leaning on the shoul
ders of a particularly buxom-look
ing Nordic woman.
I realized my Long-Haired Guy
Theory — based on personal
observations and the lives of Ric
Ocasek and Eddie Van Halen —
wasn't as scientific as I once
thought.
Because after four-and-a-half
years of public derision, physical
unattractiveness and that dizzy lit
tle headache thing you get when
your ponytail is too tight, I still
wasn't getting any play.
I looked up at Delilah, swal
lowed a big wad of phlegm and
said: "Might as well cut it off."
And I didn't care. For years, I fig
ured I would be destroyed if I ever
got my hair cut. That I would not
do it for a job, I would not do it for
a raise. I would not do it for grad
school, I would not do it for two
women wearing tiger-skin leotards.
But there I was, my head nearly

shorn, surrounded by several man
agers of the haircutting establish
ment, trying to convince me.
I didn't care that some part of
me had died on the floor of that
room. And it had died in a particu
larly unattractive pile of hair
which resembled Cousin Itt more
than I would have liked to admit.
So I sat there stoically, watch
ing myself becoming that "Generic
X" who I had always knew I would
wind up becoming, who I had so
long sought to avoid.
And, ironically, the short
haired guy I saw in the mirror
wasn't nearly as stable as the per
son I had once been. He wasn't as
invulnerable to the changes occur
ring around him. He also looked
younger and had a noticeably larg
er head.
And just before I left, that
happy, well-adjusted Asian boy
walked in and said he had never
got his free haircut in return for
the photo sessions with the Nordic
woman. Minutes later he walked
out, bald as a sea-mammal's
penis. And although I admired
him, in a strange way I was no
longer able to relate.
So now I'm the short-haired
guy, and when I go to eat free food
during Rush, saying things like
"he's a really good guy" or "I think
I can add a lot to the house," peo
ple take me seriously. I'm just one
dangerous step closer to the
Generic X.
Sometimes, when I walk into
the dining hall and see a guv from
the back, I get confused and think
it's me.
Maybe I don't need my hair any
more. Maybe I've learned to
express myself in other ways.
Maybe I've learned to be comfort
able with who I am.
Or maybe I just sold out.
I look back to pictures of myself
all the way from freshman year of
high school up until today, and I
feel like one of those Jim Beam
ads.
I miss the old me. But, then
again, he didn't get laid either.

The first thing Mikhail Gorbachev said to me
was, "Joel, I can't believe you cut your hair."
All right, maybe not. But a lot of people did
notice.
I had been "wearing my hair low" — as the hip
sters like to say — since my junior year of high
school.
I remember the day I first started growing it out. I
stopped Nick the Barber as he was opening the draw
er to take out his shears — thus gaining several key
seconds to sec the cover of the Playboy he kept hid
den there.

I turned to him and quietly pleaded, "Just leave
the back." He understood.
After six months I looked like Achilles or Ulysses
or the effeminate guy from Color Me Badd. And, sev

help but wonder if it all happened just so I could see
