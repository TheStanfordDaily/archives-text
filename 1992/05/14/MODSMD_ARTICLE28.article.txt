# Why should I care about short hair?

The first thing Mikhail Gorbachev said to me
was, "Joel, I can't believe you cut your hair."
All right, maybe not. But a lot of people did

or the effeminate guy from Color Me Badd. And, sev
eral hundred bottles of conditioner later, I couldn't
help but wonder if it all happened just so I could see
an airbrushed photo of the Landers sisters.
My hair became the center of my inner being, the
first thing people noticed when I walked in a room.
Small children, thinking for a brief moment they
were Southern police officers, asked me why I had
"girl hair."
Security guards followed me around malls, allow
ing me to play the game where I pretend to shove
tube socks down my pants, and instead concentrate
really hard on that thing Catherine Bach did to her
shirts in"The Dukes of Hazzard." They never said
anything.
And everyone thought I smoked pot. I would tell
