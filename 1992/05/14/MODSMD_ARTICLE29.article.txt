# Talented dancers shine in Spring Migration
## 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
Spring Migration, the Dance Division's
14th annual showcase of choreographic
and performance talent, is a testament to
the strength and high quality of Stanford's
performing arts community.
Judging from the opening night atten
dance last Friday, it's also an event requir
ing advance tickets if you want to catch
the final two shows tomorrow and Satur
day.
Director Tony Morris-Kramer, a lectur
er in the Dance Division, thinks this
year's Spring Migration may be the first
entirely student-choreographed show,
making the event all the more impressive
considering the achievements of the
choreographers and dancers in the various
pieces.
Spring Migration opens with "Water
Rite," set in the Roble Gym Courtyard as
twilight ebbs. Dancers garbed in loose
white outfits weave their way around the
courtyard in a tranquil piece that does
indeed invoke images of water despite the
parched fountain at the center of the
courtyard.
Upon moving into the dance studio,
audience members arc treated to a wide
variety of music, themes and dance styles.
Perhaps the biggest strength of the produc
tion is this variety, since even if you don't
understand or like one piece, the next is
sure to be markedly different.
Perhaps the most impressive of the
dances is Magili Chapman's "Piece — No
Peace," an extraordinarily topical compo
sition examining inner-city violence.
Despite its apparent connection to the
recent violence in Los Angeles, Chapman
says she had been "thinking about it con
ceptually since last summer" and its cur
rent relevance is just "an amazing coinci
dence."
But as she notes, listening to the
music used in the dance (by Take Six, Ice
Cube and Living Colour, among others),
"you feel like (the violence] was going to

happen."
A monologue by Asst. Dean of Stu
dents and Black Community Services
Center director Keith Archuleta highlights
the feeling of tension incorporated into the
entire piece, as does the presence of four
young black men wandering aimlessly
back and forth across the stage.

If you don't understand
or like one piece, the
next is sure to be
markedly different.

Flawlessly performed, "Piece — No
Peace" displays not only technical excel
lence, but a real sense of struggle that car
ries the dance emotionally.
Another piece with a definite message
is . . Can You See?" choreographed by
Angela Jones.
Set in part to Jimi Hendrix's version of
the National Anthem, the dance com
ments on "things in America people don't
see, or (choose to) ignore."
Seething with power, emotion and ath
leticism, Jones' dance, like Chapman's,
invokes images of urban warfare and
oppression, as she and her two co-per
formers dance in costumes emblazoned
with blurred American flags.
Jones has been studying the homeless
and felt creating a dance addressing simi
lar themes was a way to "bring it into what
I was thinking and doing," to go beyond
the statistics and incorporate it into some
thing she loves, namely dance.
Similarly emotive and technically
sound is Jennifer Cullins' "Wings," set to
the soulful music of Black Box's "Every
body Everybody."
"It's about the trials and joys of mother-

daughter relationships," Cullins
said, adding that for her, "excel
lent dancing makes a statement
emotionally.
By that definition, "Wings" is
a spectacular piece, full of con
flict and tension, but heartfelt at
the same time.
Utilizing social dance forms
like one would see in a dance
club, the piece is a pleasure to
watch as well.
Spring Migration also fea
tures two pieces choreographed
by Lily Wang to fulfill require
ments for her Master's degree in
Dance.
While "Getting There" and
"Being There" have a certain
hypnotic quality about them,
they are perhaps the least acces

sible of the works presented.
Still, they do provide provoca
tive imagery and perhaps your
only chance to see Chinese food
incorporated into a dance. The
two pieces are frenetic, yet
retain a sense of rhythm.
Other pieces include the spir
ited "The Bermuda Diagonal" by
Kristin Schrader, Catherine
Valencia's smooth, flowing
"What Goes Down Must Come
Up," the light "I, Bacchante" by
Jill Antonides, and "Nine Pos
tures 4," a demanding display of
body control and strength set
partly in silence, choreographed
by Lea Wolf and her dancers.
As Morris-Kramer aptly puts
it, Spring Migration is perhaps
your best opportunity to see
"excellent high-quality student
choreography," especially before
impending budget cuts hit the
performing arts at Stanford
hard.

As Morris-Kramer aptly puts

choreography," especially before
impending budget cuts hit the
performing arts at Stanford
hard.
Spring Migration, the Dance Division's
14th annual showcase of choreographic
and performance talent, is a testament to
the strength and high quality of Stanford's
performing arts community.
Judging from the opening night atten
dance last Friday, it's also an event requir
ing advance tickets if you want to catch
the final two shows tomorrow and Satur
day.
Director Tony Morris-Kramer, a lectur
er in the Dance Division, thinks this
year's Spring Migration may be the first
entirely student-choreographed show,
making the event all the more impressive
considering the achievements of the
choreographers and dancers in the various
pieces.
Spring Migration opens with "Water
Rite," set in the Roble Gym Courtyard as
twilight ebbs. Dancers garbed in loose
white outfits weave their way around the
courtyard in a tranquil piece that does
indeed invoke images of water despite the
parched fountain at the center of the
courtyard.
Upon moving into the dance studio,
audience members arc treated to a wide
variety of music, themes and dance styles.
Perhaps the biggest strength of the produc
tion is this variety, since even if you don't
understand or like one piece, the next is
sure to be markedly different.
Perhaps the most impressive of the
dances is Magili Chapman's "Piece — No
Peace," an extraordinarily topical compo
sition examining inner-city violence.
Despite its apparent connection to the
recent violence in Los Angeles, Chapman
says she had been "thinking about it con
ceptually since last summer" and its cur
rent relevance is just "an amazing coinci
dence."
But as she notes, listening to the
music used in the dance (by Take Six, Ice
Cube and Living Colour, among others),
"you feel like (the violence] was going to

happen."
A monologue by Asst. Dean of Stu
dents and Black Community Services
Center director Keith Archuleta highlights
the feeling of tension incorporated into the
entire piece, as does the presence of four
young black men wandering aimlessly
back and forth across the stage.

If you don't understand
or like one piece, the
next is sure to be
markedly different.

Flawlessly performed, "Piece — No
Peace" displays not only technical excel
lence, but a real sense of struggle that car
ries the dance emotionally.
Another piece with a definite message
is . . Can You See?" choreographed by
Angela Jones.
Set in part to Jimi Hendrix's version of
the National Anthem, the dance com
ments on "things in America people don't
see, or (choose to) ignore."
Seething with power, emotion and ath
leticism, Jones' dance, like Chapman's,
invokes images of urban warfare and
oppression, as she and her two co-per
formers dance in costumes emblazoned
with blurred American flags.
Jones has been studying the homeless
and felt creating a dance addressing simi
lar themes was a way to "bring it into what
I was thinking and doing," to go beyond
the statistics and incorporate it into some
thing she loves, namely dance.
Similarly emotive and technically
sound is Jennifer Cullins' "Wings," set to
the soulful music of Black Box's "Every
body Everybody."
"It's about the trials and joys of mother-
