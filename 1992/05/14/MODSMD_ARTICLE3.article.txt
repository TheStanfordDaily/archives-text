## Whites' role in response is discussed 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
White identity and the role
of white people in the move
ment for equality were the
focus of a meeting last night in
which many students suggested
education and communication
as remedies for racial problems.
More than thirty people
gathered in Otero's lounge for
the discussion titled "Beyond
Guilt." Some said they were
there because they cannot find
a community or culture in the
same way minority students
can.
"If there was a white theme
house, what would people do
there — eat apple pie?" asked
one student.
Senior Greg Edwards said
that when he was describing
the idea for the discussion, a
woman in the stairway gave
him a dirty look — a look a
black person would not get
when talking about his race's
identity, Edwards said.
Her reaction helped con
vince him that more people
need to think about the roles
of white people and the white
community, Edwards said.
Discussion focused both on
traditional "service" pro
grams, such as tutoring pro
jects and homeless shelters,
along with ways to work on
changing race relations from
within the white community.
Group members suggested
self-education on racial and
political issues, and education
of other white people — both
in their home communities
and at Stanford — as a way
they could make the greatest dif
ference in the fight for equality.
"There are a whole lot of
things that still need to happen in
white communities across the
country," junior Anna Olson said.
"There is still a tremendous

amount of stereotypes, fear and
miscommunication."
Many also expressed resent
ment at what they called a ten
dency of minority communities to
ignore the ideas, suggestions and
actions of whites.
"Where people draw the line
between minority issues and com
munity issues is really screwed,"
freshman Emily Haines said.
Junior Tracy Clay, a black stu

dent and a leading member of the
Black Action Coalition for Justice,
said she attended the meeting
because she wanted to know how
white people feel about race rela
tions.
Clay said she advocated listening
as a path to understanding between
the races. "We all have positions
and opinions but no one ever talks
about their feelings. No one black
or white ever listens," she said.
