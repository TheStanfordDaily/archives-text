## When angst meets New Age Pianist awaits release of his second CD 
### Travis Farr Staff writer 
Metallica is one of his biggest
influences, but you'll find his disk
in the New Age section of the
record store.
It doesn't seem like a contradic
tion to pianist and composer
Michael Halaas. "I have a lot of
cross-over fans from heavy metal,"
says the Stanford senior. "If I had a
guitar and drums, I would play
heavy metal. I prefer the piano, but
it's the same type of thing."
The human biology major, on
the verge of releasing his second
CD, compares his solo piano to
everything from Nine Inch Nails

to the Indigo Girls.
His new CD, "Stare," is the
most recent manifestation of
Halaas' love of expressing himself
through music. He writes to cap
ture a mood, and to help himself
work through things. Because of
the emotional intensity of his writ
ing, he is surprised by listeners
who call his music mellow.
"It's not typical New Age. It's
more serious, more introspective,
and at times a lot more depress
ing," he says.
Halaas usually writes his songs
around a single image or emotion,
reflected in the title of the piece.
His albums also focus on specific
themes: His last album, "No Dis

guises," was about what he calls
authenticity.
According to Halaas, authentic
people are "not trivial; they don't
have fabricated personality traits.
They don't put on big smiley faces
when they're not happy."
"Stare" tackles a different sub
ject. "There are a lot of people who
are blind to people around them.
They have their own interests and
drives, and they're very egocentric.
'Stare' is the opposite of that."
It would seem to be a relevant
message. Halaas thinks that there
is a danger of becoming sheltered
and naive within the safe confines
of campus.
"After you've been here a while,

you either start rejecting this place
or recoiling into it. You become
sheltered and scared of the rest of
the world. My music helps me
focus on the outside, on other peo
ple," Halaas says.
Halaas isn't sure what place
piano will occupy in his life after
college. He plans to go to medical
school, but realizes that the enor
mous time commitment would
take time away from the piano.
"I know I can't go on doing both
forever," he says. His future plans
depend mostly on the success of
"Stare." If the album does well, he
says he will probably put off med
school a few years.
Halaas began composing piano
pieces as a senior in high school.
He had taken a six-year hiatus
from the piano and spent four
years in a heavy metal band.
When a friend talked him into
taking up the piano again, he
didn't have anything to play, so he
began composing for himself.
Friends encouraged him through
out his freshman and sophomore
years, and Halaas produced and
released "No Disguises" at the
beginning of his junior year.
He sent demos of his recording
to various record companies and
was approached by Beachwood.
For the next year or so he will be
promoting the album. As a part of
the promotion, he will be appear
ing in the Bay Area and on cam
pus. His next on-campus concert
will be tomorrow at 8 p.m. in
Braun's Campbell Recital Hall.
Admission is $1 at the door.
Regardless of his future profes
sional success, Halaas will contin
ue to compose and play. "My
music has become so important
me. I can't imagine my life with
out it."

Michael Halaas' new CD, "Stare,"
will soon be available at the Stan
ford Bookstore for $12 and at
Tower Records for more.
