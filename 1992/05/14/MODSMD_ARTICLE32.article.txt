## diminuendo and crescendo Mecca and the Soul Brother 
### Cheo H. Coker 
Beat junkies who peeped Pete Rock and
C.L. Smooth's jeep slammin' "All Souled
Out" EP last summer or witnessed both
m.c.'s catching vocal wreck on Heavy D's
"Don't Curse" already know what the rest
of the nation is bound to find out — these
bruthas have bill payin' skills! It will soon
be impossible to mention N.Y.'s thriving
hardcore scene without inclusion of this
dynamic duo from Mount Vernon, N.Y.
With 18 tracks clockin' in at well over
70 minutes, "Mecca And The Soul Broth
er" is the best complete album to emerge
from the East Coast underground since
ATCQ's "Low End Theory."
While not by any means an imitation
of the latter, Rock and Smooth's collabo
ration is cast from the same mold as the
Tribe's hypnotic masterpiece; it's a rivet
ing mix of jazz/funk horn lines, ass
kickin' beats, flavorful bass lines, rhyth
mically intricate rhyming, and memo
rable cameos by some of rap's best and
brightest (Grand Puba and Heavy D.).
Underlying these essential elements,
however, is a deep socio-political con
science. Black nationalism, ghetto real
ism and views on the music business end
up in mix alongside mellower freestyle
tracks.
"All of my lyrics deal with reality —
something that you can relate to in every
day life," C.L. Smooth said to me in a
recent conversation.
"Basically [the rhyme scenarios] are
something that can really happen, instead
of something that could never be."
While "Return Of The Mecca" and
"For Pete's Sake" are characteristic of the
group's sound (horn lines that effortless
ly slip in and out of the songs, slammin'
beats, dope lyrics), the album doesn't
really pick up until it reaches the third
track, "Ghettos Of The Mind."
Corey's lyrics, matched with Pete's
impeccable production, gets right inside
the mind of a brother strugglin' to stay
afloat in a sea of despair:
"Killin' my own people/I put 'em out of
order/Just like the liquor store scene on
every corner/I'm tryin'/But the kids keep

cryin'/And the bullets keep flyin'/Little
boys on the curb just dyin'."
The song's brutally honest lyrics
somehow find a unique perspective on a
subject that has been covered in songs
from"The Message" to "Love's Gonna
Getcha."
"I'm just putting you in the position of
a young black man imagining, reminisc
ing so to speak," C.L. said.
"There are a lot of things on your mind
that make you say, 'Damn, this shit is
hard! Am I really gonna be successful
comin' out of the ghetto? I already got
one strike against me, I'm black. What
else do I have to do?"
Instead of answering the questions for
the listener, C.L.'s lyrics provoke
thought. "I just wanted the people to
know the ghetto without cursing," he
added.
Black male familial responsibility, a
popular subject in rap (i.e. "Be A Father
To Your Child," "Ghetto Bastard") also
permeates a number of tracks.
Not only "Ghettos," but one of the
album's highlight track's, "They Remi
nisce Over You," deals with men who
have taken care of business. C.L is defi
nitely out to prove that all black fathers
aren't slippin'.
"A lot of fathers in the ghetto are
talked about, 'Oh they worthless, they
don't do shit' — that's not the whole
story man!" C.L. said.
"The real shit is what my father and
grandfather did. . . . That's why I wrote
Reminisce,' to put it out that not all black
men are reneging on their kids. . . . These
are real men, who take their people and
try to put power in defining them."
"They Reminisce Over You (T-ROY)
is dedicated to one of Heavy D's Boyz
who died in a tragic fall almost two years
ago.
The song is notable not only for the
innovative saxophone hook and thumpin'
rhythm track, but also because the lyrics
are so meaningful that the song has a
deeper meaning every time you listen to
it.

C.L. Smooth and Pete Rock, a new hardcore duo from New York, promise to burst
into national prominence in the coming months.
"I basically try very hard to make
the person think and reminisce,"
C.L. said.
"To [make the listener] use
more of his brain than his ear to
reminisce, to think about who he
was as a baby, to grow from a lit
tle boy to a young man."
It wouldn't do this LP justice to
only focus on the aforementioned
tracks. "Straighten It Out," "Act
Like You Know,""The Wig Out,"
and "On And On" are all hardcore
cuts that slam harder than a
week-old heartbreak.
Laid-back maneuvers like
"Skinz' (featuring C.L.'s cousin
Gran Puba Maxwell) and "Lot's of
Lovin" sneak up and snuff the lis
tener from behind. C.L. is the
proverbial "Son of Rakim," drop

pin' mad dope lyrics over Pete's
dense rhythm tracks.
The production technique is
similar to P.E.'s "Noize," except
everything fits perfectly; Pete sits
on the curb adding an occasional
"Woo!" or "Uh-Huh!" from the
side, while horn lines and rhythm
scratches blend so perfectly that
you don't even notice them.
The track of choice, however,
is "Can't Front On Me"; the agi
tated drum track, matched with
C.L.'s angry flow and Pete's side
comments make an unbeatable
combination.
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth are
soon gonna be livin' as fat as the
grooves on this LP.
This album is all that and
more. Stop wastin' your time
reading this article and get this
one on CD, because the group's
actions speak much louder than
my words. Peace!
