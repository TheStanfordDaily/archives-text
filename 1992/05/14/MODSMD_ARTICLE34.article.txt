# Maddalena's serves up artistic Italian dining

Eating is serious business. One of my
high school history teachers once told me
that eating ranked with sex as the two
most pleasurable of human functions.
The class tittered at this. But I wasn't
laughin — I knew better. Food has the
power to make us happy if we manipu
late it creatively.
Which is why a place like Maddale
na's is such a good find. Food at Mad
dalena's is accorded its proper respect.
All the little things are done right — the
food is presented so artistically you
almost don't want to touch it, the
recipes are creative, and the ingredients
are of uniformly high quality, making
the overall experience of eating there
very pleasurable.
Maddalena's is actually two restau
rants. The main dining room is full of
atmosphere, charm, wonderful food and
well-dressed people with enough cash to
shell out $20 for salmon and $23 for filet
mignon, among other traditional conti
nental entrees.
Undoubtedly, the food you get in the
dining room is well worth the price. But
the "Appetizer Bar" adjacent to the main
restaurant serves pasta and other Italian
inspired dishes that are plenty big

enough to be dinner — and are well
within a student budget, ranging from
$6 to $9. The Appetizer Bar also has live
entertainment and features a well
stocked bar tended by owner Fred Mad
dalena himself.
As soon as they brought out the
antipasta I knew we were in for a pretty
unbelievable dinner. First came a moz
zarella and fontina roll served with Roma
tomatoes, roasted red peppers and capers
($4.95), which was nothing short of art

work. It was a combination of mozzarel
la, prosciutto, spinach, fontina blended
with pesto and fontina blended with what
I think were sun-dried tomatoes. Wow.
The only drawback was that it is very
rich, and if you didn't have anyone to
share it with you'd probably be stuffed
before your entree arrived.
The pasta options were varied, and
they all sounded pretty appetizing. Lin
guini Aglio Olio (tossed in olive oil with
hot red pepper) is $5.95, tortellini in a
pesto and cream sauce is $6.95, linguini
with clams $7.95.
We tried a couple of the somewhat
less conventional offerings: lemon and
pepper fettuccine with smoked chicken,
pepper pecans and sage ($8.95) and Cap
pellini Basilica, which is very delicate
pasta (thinner than vermicelli) tossed in
olive oil with prawns, pancetta, Roma
tomatoes, basil and garlic for $7.95.
Lemon, sage and pepper is a cool
combination of spices, but my favorite
was the cappellini. You could trust any
of the pasta dishes, though.
In addition to pasta, Maddalena's
offers a range of pizzas from $6.25 to
$6.95, including one with clams and
fresh garlic. A more exotic menu item is
Prawns Spidini, which is a sort of prawn
and pancetta shishkebab on a bed of
