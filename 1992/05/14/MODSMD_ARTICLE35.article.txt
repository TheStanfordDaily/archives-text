## Realistic 'Waterdance' doesn't miss a beat 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
A woman comes to visit her
lover, who is laid up in a hospital
for a neck injury. Shortly there
after, panting, moaning and tiny
squeals are emitted from behind
the curtains.
But don't become excited just
yet. This scene is the steamiest
"The Waterdance" by writer/direc
tor Neal Jimenez ever gets.
Based on his personal experi
ence, this film is about a man who
loses the use of his lower body after
a hiking accident, and about the
people he encounters during his
hospital stay.
Starring Eric Stoltz as Joel Gar
cia, a character modeled after
Jimenez, "The Waterdance" pre
sents difficult themes without
fishing for sympathy. Tension
between Garcia and his married
girlfriend, Anna (Helen Hunt), is
magnified by the fact he now is
paraplegic. He asks her things like
"How often do you fuck [your hus
band) when you see him?"
Later, when Garcia tearfully
expresses his rage to another
patient in a self-pitying soliloquy,
that patient falls asleep on him.
Garcia laughs out loud, realizing
that he is wallowing in his misfor
tune.
Caustic realism is the strength
of the script and the force that pro
pels "The Waterdance" into the
realm of masterful films. Charac
ters such as Raymond Hill (Wesley
Snipes) and Bloss (William
Forsythe) significantly add to this
realism.
Hill is a black man's nightmare,
one of the few black men on which
many stereotypes are based. A jive
talking, no-good alcoholic failing

at supporting his estranged wife
and young child, Hill is kamikaze
diving into self-destruction.
Snipes brilliantly portrays Hill,
refusing to allow the character's
pathetic side drown his humanity.
Throughout "The Waterdance,"
Hill clings to an idealistic vision of
his family hoping in vain that he,
his wife and his child will reunite
as soon as he leaves the hospital.
As Hill battles with his inability

to "keep up the dance" and to cul
tivate the fortitude necessary for
coping, Bloss lives in serious
denial, embracing a false percep
tion of himself, his accident and
his chances of winning a big law
suit against the man whose expen
sive car hit him.
A motorcycle punk and blue
collar racist, Bloss, for most of
"Waterdance," is the character one
loves to hate. By the end, though,

his vehement affection for Hill
makes him more endearing.
All three of the main actors suc
cessfully portray men who have
disabilities without coming across
as disabled.
Intelligent direction as well as
the first-hand knowledge of
Jimenez are reflected in their act
ing making "The Waterdance" a
moving film that won't be soon
forgotten.
