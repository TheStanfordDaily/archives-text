# Honesty is priority of director Jimenez
## 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
Neal Jimenez saw his first
screenplay, "The River's Edge,"
independently produced while
still an undergraduate at UCLA.
This hit gave a glimpse of
Jimenez's exceptional ability to
capture complicated themes
realistically without overloading
on emotion. In"The Water
dance," his latest project and his
directorial debut, Jimenez
remains true to his talent.
"I wanted to keep things
unsentimental," he said in an
interview. "I wanted to be hon
est about the emotions, but I did
not want to be weepy."
"The Waterdance" was
inspired by a hiking accident
which left Jimenez a paraplegic.
However, he said the personal
nature of the project did not make
it difficult for him. "It was easy
because it was necessary, some
thing I knew I wanted to do."
Although many of the
movie's themes are based on
Jimenez's experience, "The
Waterdance" is not an autobiog
raphy.
The character, Joel Garcia
(Eric Stoltz), possesses qualities
similar to Jimenez's, but "The
Waterdance" tells the stories of
three men attempting to deal
with their new physical condi
tion and with each other.
"We think we made a good
film," he said. "We obviously
aren't going to make $50 mil
lion."
Quality actors such as Stoltz
(who played opposite Cher in
"Mask") and Wesley Snipes,
who plays fellow patient Ray
mond Hill, grace the screen with
their superior performances.
Jimenez purposefully granted all
of the actors the room necessary
for them to do what they do
best. "It was an actors' piece,"
he said.
In one masterfully performed
scene between the main charac
ter, Garcia, and his married girl
friend, Anna (Helen Hunt), the
two attempt to enjoy each
other's company during one of
her hospital visits.
They are playing Scrabble
when suddenly Garcia loses
control and knocks all of the
pieces on the floor. Anna reacts
by jumping up from her chair
and accidentally knocking it

over. She complains about how
she is trying so hard and is giv
ing so much, then grabs an
empty bottle on his nightstand
and says "You need more sham
poo."
A scene that seems too per
fect turns out to be heavily
improvised. The chair falling
was a real accident, according to
Jimenez. Hunt just picked up
her chair and continued acting.
As a director, Jimenez made
naturalness a priority. "We kept
the frame loose to allow for acci
dents," he said.

'It was easy
because it was
necessary, some
thing I knew I
wanted to do.'

Naturalness also was a big
concern, since Stoltz, Snipes
and William Forsythe (who
plays Bloss) all have use of the
lower half of their bodies yet
were playing characters who are
paraplegic.
"Eric stayed in the chair from
the day we hired [him]/'
Jimenez said.
As actors, Jimenez felt that
all three of them were strong. He
said that in spite of the fact that
Snipes has less acting experi
ence than Stoltz, "there is some
thing very real about him. . . .
Wesley is such a natural."
And of Forsythe, Jimenez
said, "Bill was always working
and fighting to find the truth of
his character."
Excellence also manifests
itself in Jimenez's attention to
small detail. Camera angles
show only what a person who
cannot turn his or her neck
could see, and music coming
out of a walkman sounds differ
ent when the headphones are
removed.
Although the realism is the
strength of "The Waterdance,"
Jimenez said only "about 22 per
cent" of the film was taken from
real life. With a slightly devious
look, he added that the steamy
sex scene in the hospital "hap
pened with a friend of mine."
