## Road film leaves normal behind 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
In the vein of "Fried Green Tomatoes" and "Steel
Magnolias/' "Leaving Normal" is one of those "girl"
movies you either love or hate, depending on how
much sentimentality you're willing to allow yourself
to feel in the face of obvious emotional manipula
tion.
Luckily, "Leaving Normal," a wistful yet heart
warming film about two women's search for happi
ness in life, is well worth lowering your sappiness
shield for a quietly solid movie experience.
"Leaving Normal" stars Christine Lahti and Meg
Tilly, two of Hollywood's lesser names who
nonetheless deliver powerful performances. Lahti
plays Darly, a stereotypical brash-and-cynical wait
ress type who leaves Normal, Wyoming to start a
new life in Alaska with Tilly's character, Marianne,
in tow.
Marianne starts out as a much more complex per
sonality than Darly. At age 27, Marianne has had
two rotten husbands, been in the Army, dropped out
of college and nursing school and has lived in more
places than she cares to remember.
Meek and unsure of herself, Marianne unexpect
edly finds herself joining the sympathetic Darly on
her Northern odyssey.
"Leaving Normal" is not so much about "finding
yourself," but more about examining whether a life
is successful even though it never turns out the way
you had hoped or even expected.
Darly and Marianne are two marginal souls.
They both want something better and seem to
deserve it and to be capable of achieving it. Yet their

problem is that they can't figure out what would be
better. They chase an idyllic life without even having
an idea of what it would be like.
Half the film chronicles the women's journey to
Alaska and the truly quirky characters they meet on
the way. These minor characters also seem trapped
in the same wheel-spinning mode as Darly and Mar
ianne, but the film still manages to convey a sense
of hope.
Each of these slightly off-kilter characters, includ
ing a truck driver who writes poetry and cries over
Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath," represents the
ultimate goodness of people, making "Leaving Nor
mal" definitely a warm-fuzzy kind of film.
Once the women reach Alaska, penniless and
unexpectedly homeless save for an old car and trail
er, the characters seem to converge.
The aimless, neurotic Marianne finds happiness
in a stable life and employment up North, and the
stalwart, self-assured Darly aches to pick up and
move on, still searching for something better.
Marianne's transformation is especially delightful,
like watching a beaten animal learn to accept love and
kindness again. And Lahti's climatic scene, in which
Darly shows just how desperate she has become to
move on, wrenches the soul, allowing Lahti to tran
scend her cliched character and show the vulnerabili
ty behind Darly's tough-talking exterior.
Like the rest of "Leaving Normal," the film's con
clusion leaves the audience with an upbeat scene of
optimism tinged with incomplete resolution of
many elements of the characters' lives. It is this
mature treatment of the theme of hope that makes
"Leaving Normal" wonderful â€” for those who like
this type of film.
