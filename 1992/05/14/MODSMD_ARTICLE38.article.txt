# All ends well in 'problem play'
## 
### Russell Hancock 
It is unlikely that "All's Well
That Ends Well" will often be seen
in the modern theater. Critical
appraisal has ranged from labeling
it a "problem comedy" at best to an
"authorial failure" at worst.
It is a rare opportunity, then,
given to the Stanford community
this month — for the Drama
Department is staging one of
Shakespeare's most-cited but lit
tle-used plays, generally under
stood to be one of the lesser works
to flow from the Bard's pen.
In its straightforward plot, a
poor physician's daughter, Helena
(Dawn McMillan), falls passion
ately in love with Bertram, the
Count Rossillion (Gabe Weisert),
who neither returns her love nor
suspects her of it. He leaves for the
French court, and she follows, bent
on winning him. This she accom
plishes by contrivance: in curing
the ailing king (James Loehlin), she
is granted the hand of any man she
chooses.
Bertram, now forced to marry
Helena against his will, flees the
scene, and the play concerns itself
with Helena's furtive pursuit of her
man. To win him back she is
forced to fulfill his outlandish con
ditions, which include stealing the
ring off his finger and bearing his
son.
When by stealth and by craft
she finally wins him, all has
indeed ended well, and we are left
to ponder why there is no other
work of Shakespeare's which in
conception and temper seem so
corrupt as this.
For this cause, perhaps the
most interesting thing about the
Drama Department's staging of
"All's Well" is the choice itself. For
all its shortcomings, the play does
acquire a certain warmth in perfor
mance, and faults that seem glar
ing to an analytic student are not
so apparent to an audience.
But still we wonder why Shake
speare wrote such a strange piece.
Was he sacrificing virtue to conve
nience, or did he mean "All's Well"
to be a strong statement that love
is not governed by reason?
Playgoers who demand answers
to these questions will only find
clues in director Lance Miller's
staging. McMillan's Helena per
forms in a manner that is some

thing between despicable and hero
ic, an ambiguity that perhaps
reflects Miller's own uncertainty.
Weisert plays Bertram evenly, as
the unsympathetic hero that he is.

But still we won
der why Shake
speare wrote such
a strange piece.

Weisert and McMillan receive
adequate support from the sur
rounding cast, including Claudia
Orenstein, who plays the Count
ess as an altogether charming old
lady with the mellow wisdom of
age, and Dan Hunt's elderly Lord
Lafew, a character here played
much better than he reads.
John Wilson's set provides an

austerely composed frame,- the cos
tumes are perfectly fine, although
some will be distracted by the
clump-clumping spurs worn by
Parolles. Karin Roffman's unac
companied violin is an especially
nice touch.
In all, this is a production of
some potential significance. After
all, even the worst Shakespeare is
still, well, Shakespeare. In staging
it, the Drama Department is say
ing that the play is what it is, prob
lems and all.
What's more, there is some sug
gestion here that "All's Well" has
some relevance to the '90s, by
prodding us to consider questions
of gender and role, power and
desire.
It is in this way that the cast
sees success. We cannot change
Shakespeare's motives, or pretend
to understand them,- we don't even
have to say that the play is a pleas
ant one. Making us think is an
accomplishment.
