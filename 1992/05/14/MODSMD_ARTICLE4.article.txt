# Three fraternities miss quotas, but dry Rush called success
## 
### June Fang Staff writer 
Three out of nine housed fraternities
did not meet their pledge quotas after
this year's Rush, according to a report
released yesterday.
Also, fraternity Rush chairs said the
dry Rush policy was successful in its sec
ond year and reaffirmed their decision
not to shorten the three-week process by
a week.
Beta Theta Pi, Theta Xi and Phi Delta
Theta failed to meet their quotas. Accord
ing to Fraternal Affairs Adviser Heather

Dunn, quotas are determined by taking
into account the size of the house and the
number of spaces it can offer each year.
Freshman pledges count as one point
towards meeting the quota, while sopho
more pledges are counted as a half-point.
The Betas, who have been locally
autonomous since they lost their affilia
tion with the national chapter two years
ago, was short by three points. Theta Xi
needed 2.5 points to meet their quota,
and the Phi Delts came up short by only a
half-point.
According to Dunn, "While unhoused
frats have no quotas, most of them try to

maintain a manageable number and an
intimate, friendly size conducive to the
brotherhood they're trying to achieve."
Like last year, dry Rush rules required
all of this year's activities to be alcohol
free. According to fraternity members,
the rules did not have a negative effect on
the process.
"Though people were not sure about
how the parties would go, it ended up
going over well," said IFC Rush chair
Matt Moran. "I don't think dry Rush
turned people away."
He said this year's alcohol-free pro
grams were more carefully planned than

last year's since fraternities had more
time to prepare for them. "We had a year
more to be aware of the consequences of
breaking rules," he said.
For many, the dry Rush policy helped
to keep the focus away from just drinking.
"It takes the pressure off rushees to
drink. Alcohol does not become the main
focus," said Sigma Nu Rush chair Evan
Singer. "It also allows the actives to know
the rushees better.
Kappa Alpha Rush chair Dave Winn
added, "You meet [rushees] better in a
natural environment, rather than when
they're plastered."

According to Singer, dry Rush was also
less financially taxing for the fraternity
and the policy weeded out those who were
just involved for the alcohol.
"A lot of people just go out for the par
ties," Moran said. "We've lost those peo
ple who were not serious in rushing."
Despite previous discussions about
shortening the Rush period to two weeks,
the Interfraternity Council has chosen to
keep it at its traditional three-week length.
"It should stay at three," Singer said.
"It's long, but worth it. It's the future of

Freshman Carina Merrick and junior David Amann began their friendship through an exchange of electronic-mail mes

the same when you meet them," Amann said.
our fraternity."
In past years, there were sever
al movements to limit Rush
because of conflicts with Prospec

tive Freshman Week and the long,
draining process, according to
Dunn.
She said a compromise was
reached between the fraternities
and Dean of Students Michael
Jackson, who had requested the
change, to require all Rush par
ties to be either closed or moved

off campus during Pro Fro week.
"It was agreed that three
weeks was necessary to know
guys and make the appropriate
cuts," Winn said.
Large fraternities have an
especially difficult time introduc
ing all the active members to the
many rushees, said Mo ran.
"For a large fraternity to take a
lot of people you need the time
just to meet everyone," he said
"It's a lot harder in two weeks
than three."
"And its also helpful for small
er fraternities," he added. "Since
each member will have a greater
role in the fraternity and a more
immediate impact, the actives
have to choose carefully."
On the other hand, a longer
Rush also allows the rushees to
decide if the Greek system is for
them.
"By the third week [rushees]
have narrowed down their choices
better — they've figured out what
they want to do," Moran said.
"This keeps depledging lower and
less are dissatisfied."
