# Lennox excels on solo debut

### Chris Patil Staff writer 
Deep in my heart, I knew that Annie Lennox was
much more than just the pretty voice in front of the
Euiythmics, but it's nice to have the reassurance pro
vided by her first solo album, "Diva."
If someone had told me that "Diva" was the Eury
thmics, I would have believed it. The style of the
album is by no means identical to previous Euiyth
mics releases, but it is consistent with the direction in
which they'd been heading in their more recent
albums. It's everything you could want from a break
away album — as good as the old stuff, but brand new.
The best tracks on the album tend to be the more
upbeat ones. "Walking on Broken Glass" initially
seems overbearingly pompous, but nothing Annie
does can avoid having an immense quantity of soul. It
quickly becomes apparent that this infectious track is
no exception.
Another strong selection is "Precious" — no soul
shortage here, either. Like "Broken Glass," it makes
excellent use of a background chorus composed entire
ly of overdubs of Lennox herself. The effect is spiritu
ally akin to Billy Joel's self-accompaniment in"The
Longest Time," although on a less elaborate scale.
Nothing but the best in backup vocals for Annie, I
guess. "If you want something done right, do it your
self." (Here might be a good place to point out that
"diva," in addition to its traditional translation, "god
dess," also means "prima donna").

A third good, fairly upbeat song is "Money Can't
Buy It," referring to — you guessed it. This track is
somewhat schizophrenic: It starts lethargically, but
finishes with a power that you end up wishing Annie
had been able to maintain throughout the whole
piece. The build is supposed to be dramatic, but
doesn't quite work.
The lyrics in the second half of the song are quite
amusing: "Now hear this/Pay attention to me/Cause
I'm a rich white girl and it's plain to see/I've got every
kind of thing that money can buy ..Listeners for
whom this description hits too close to home might
find less humor in the song. Despite a few problems,
"Money" is a quality piece, with a sense of humor I
haven't heard from Lennox since the Eurythmics' "I
Need a Man."
One selection that needs to be appreciated more
for its content than its musical merit is "Keep Young
and Beautiful," a song that looks with sarcastic criti
cism at a woman's concern with maintaining youth
fulness as the process of aging begins. It's a fairly bit
ter number — pretty brave for someone who's been
around long enough for young fans to be talking
about "when Annie was young" in the past tense.
The rest of the songs on "Diva," although not as
memorable as the ones I've mentioned, are definitely
consistent with the atmosphere of the album. The
selections combine to provide a rich, listenable collec
tion which, rather than causing you to mourn the
demise of the Eurythmics, makes you eagerly await
the next Annie Lennox CD.
