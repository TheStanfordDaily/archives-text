# It all began with e-mail...
## Computer messages sparked their friendship 
### Nancy Luxon 
Jerking him about on a string, fresh
man Carina Merrick toyed with junior
David Amann. She stalked him like a game
tracker, omniscient but invisible.
They had met over electronic mail and
then she unwittingly stumbled across his
true identity. When Merrick tired of the
chase and the two met for the first time,
what started out as an odd set of mind
games developed into a strong friendship.
Amann got his first e-mail message from
Merrick after she read an e.e. cummings
poem he had posted in one of his files.
She accessed the file through the "fin
ger" command, which allows people to see
information about other users, then
responded. "When you get mail from Jeho
vah, you gotta answer back," joked
Amann, whose username is "dove." Mer
rick's username is "jehovah."
The rest of their developing friendship
took on an eerie cast when Merrick, by a
freak coincidence, figured out who Amann
was. She seemed to "shadow" him — leaving
him little e-mail messages about places she
saw him and what he was wearing — while
he was left in the dark about her identity.
Although most e-mail activities do not

have the same mystery about them, some
Stanford students have transformed the
system into a social network for communi
cating with friends, developing lasting
friendships — or even initiating romantic
relationships.
"I sat in on a class on existentialism and
overheard [Amann J introducing himself to
someone," Merrick said. She then deduced
that he was the same person she had e
mailed.
"I sent him a message saying that I
liked his Mickey Mouse watch. I was play
ing mind games with him," she said.
"Obviously she was enamored with
me," Amann retorted. "It was kind of
spooky, though, having someone know
your every move."
Even though Merrick's actions had an
eerie feel to them, Amann was not too con
cerned. "I thought it was kind of funny, so
it wasn't like something out of some com
puterized fatal attraction," he said. "It was
more along the lines of a practical joke."
From then on, Merrick kept bumping
into him, inwardly chuckling to herself, and
they e-mailed notes to each other about
what they jokingly termed as "deep stuff."
When they discovered that they
had a lot in common, a friendship
sprung up over the network.
Amann never caught on to who
Merrick really was. "He didn't have
a clue!" Merrick said, laughing.
"I guess I am not one of those

people that burns an impression on
your brain," she added sarcastically.
Eventually, though, Merrick
tired of playing "jehovah" and
they decided to have an unveiling
at the Coffee House.
The meeting had the potential
to be a little tense.
Merrick admitted that she was
nervous, but Amann boasted that
he did not have jittery nerves.
"Oh yeah, you were Mr. Suave,

Joe Cool!" Merrick said.
Both said that it is "weird" to
meet someone in person after
writing them over e-mail. "The
voice you give their letters, that
voice is never the same when you
meet them," Amann explained.
Now, Merrick said, her rela
tionship with Amann is "smooth
sailing." The two students enjoy
talking, spending time together —
and exchanging e-mail messages.
