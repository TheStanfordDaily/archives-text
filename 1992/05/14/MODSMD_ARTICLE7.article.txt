Spacewalking astronauts nab satellite
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Three space shuttle astro
nauts reached up with their gloved hands yesterday and caught a
4 1/2-ton, slowly spinning satellite in a risky but successful effort
to save the craft.
"Got it!" shouted one of the spacewalkers, Pierre Thuot.
"Houston, I think we got a satellite," shuttle commander
Daniel Brandenstein said from inside Endeavour.
At the last minute, there was a hitch in the long salvage effort.
When it came time to release the satellite from the shuttle early today,
the electrical latches did not release at first. On the third try, they did.
"I tell you, that old boy didn't want to go, did he?" said Sam
Gemar of Mission Control. "I'm not sure what happened. This
has been one heck of a day."
Earlier, the spacewalkers had held onto the Intelsat-6 satellite for
11/2 hours — one complete circle of Earth —to steady it while they
attached a bar that could be used as a handle for the shuttle crane.
The satellite had been stuck at a uselessly low altitude for more
than two years.
The crane, operated from inside the cabin, gently lowered the
12-by-17-foot satellite onto a 23,000-pound rocket motor that was
to be used to propel the satellite into its proper altitude.
It was the first three-man spacewalk ever, and NASA's repu
tation as a can-do agency had been riding on it. It was a victory
that NASA needed in its defense of humans in space.
Success had eluded Endeavour's seven-member crew on two
previous days.
