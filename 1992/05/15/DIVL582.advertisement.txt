RRICK, HERRINGTON

Orrick, Hcrrington & Sutcliffe's Financial Service Group is
seeking highly qualified Bachelor's degree candidates of any major
for entry level professional positions as Financial Analysts in our
Los Angeles office.
Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe is the nation's premier bond

each of the last six years. Our practice involves representing
issuers, investment banks and other financial institutions in
connection with both traditional and innovative bond financings
including foreign currency offerings and derivative products.
Analysts work directly with issuers of tax-exempt securities
and other industry professionals (i.e. attorneys, investment
bankers, and other consultants) in performing analyses related to
certain federal tax laws and the structuring of municipal debt
offerings. Successful candidates will gain an understanding of
broadly applicable financial concepts including present value and
cash flow analyses, asset valuation, public debt issue structuring
and the workings of national securities markets. This is a
demanding professional position in which work habits, written and
oral communication skills and analytical skills can be expected to
improve appreciably.
Candidates should possess strong quantitative and analytical
skills, outstanding writing ability, creativity and a commitment to
excellence. Prior exposure to financial concepts is preferred, but
not required if aptitude and willingness to learn are evident. The
ability to work effectively with others is essential. Compensation is
competitive with bonus eligibility based on personal performance
and group profitability. More information is available at the Career
Planning and Placement Center. Cover letters and resumes (no
phone calls please) should be sent as soon as possible to:
