Want to ship your things home?
We Can Help!
□ PACKAGE IT EARLY AND AVOID THE RUSH. We
have all the necessary materials available. (Recycled
boxes — stressed from previous shipments — may be
a false economy.) Do it yourself, or have us do it for
you.
□ PACKAGE IT PROPERLY. Keep the following
standards in mind: Your packages must be able to
withstand:
■ A three foot drop, and
■ A 70 pound load on top of it.
■ Not to exceed 70 pounds in weight.
Carriers will not honor a damage claim if the item is
not properly packed. (Glass items are not insurable for
breakage)
Q NUMBER YOUR BOXES AND INVENTORY THE
CONTENTS. This helps you when unpacking and
avoids insurance hassels. Pick up free inventory sheets
and UPS shipping labels at our store.
□ INSURE IT FOR REPLACEMENT VALUE. The first
$ 100 is free, 60C per $ 100 after that.
□ 10% OFF PACKING SUPPLIES AND UPS CHARGES
with student ID or Pocket Discount Card.
