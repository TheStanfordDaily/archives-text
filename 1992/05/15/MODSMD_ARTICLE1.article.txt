# Protesters convene 'Queer Carnival' before lecture
## 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
Popcorn and face-painting set the festive mood at
yesterday evening's "Queer Carnival," which pre
ceded a controversial presentation on homosexuality
sponsored by four campus Christian organizations.
Several hundred people attended the carnival, which
was held from 6:15 to 7 p.m. in front of Kresge Audito
rium. Pink balloons and armbands were distributed to
participants, who took them into the speech.
Organizer Rachel Maddow said its goal was to pre
sent an "alternative view" to that of speaker Darlene
Bogle, who argued that gays choose their lifestyle
and can change with the help of Jesus Christ.

Queerland, a campus gay rights group, planned
the event. Information tables set up by various cam
pus and community groups offered students differ
ent perspectives on homosexuality and religion.
Organizers also passed out a flier advising
respectful behavior during the evening's activities.
Maddow said the gathering was "less confronta
tional" than expected because "tons of people" in
support of the gay community attended. "Anyone
[anti-gay] who wanted a confrontation would have
been swarmed," she said.

Butler said the Queerland protest did not bother her

at all. "I think it's fine and neat
that they're doing this," she said
earlier in the afternoon.
Butler, who organized the
speech, said she brought Bogle to
campus to offer students "a dif
ferent viewpoint."
"There is no desire in our
hearts to condemn the folks in the
gay lifestyle," said Dorman Fol
lowwill, a pastor at Peninsula
Bible Church, which also co-spon
sored the speaking engagement.
The ralliers were "more than
free to do whatever they want,"
Foliowwill said.
Sophomore Saydeah Howard
said she was "pleasantly surprised"
at the number of students who
came to show support for the gay,
lesbian and bisexual community.
"You don't get this kind of sup
port every day," she said.
Troy Gilbert, the University
advisor for the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center, said
he thinks the strong showing may
encourage more people to "come out
of the closet and fight oppression."
Senior L.K. Tan, a member of
the Christian group Cornerstone,
looked on at the carnival events.
Although Cornerstone was one of

the four speech co-sponsors, Tan
wore a pink armband in support
of the gay community.
"So many people have used
Christianity to condemn gay peo
ple," he said. "I think that's real
ly unfortunate because it's
obscured the message that God
loves everyone."
Carnival organizers, who
began planning the protest about
a week ago, said they wanted to
show a "queer-positive image."
"The idea of the carnival is to
show we're happy to be the way
we are," said one organizer.
"It sounded like a lot more fun
than protesting sour-faced," said
Charles Goldman, who attended
the carnival as a representative of
Stanford Hillel, a Jewish student
organization.
Goldman distributed pink
fliers saying the Jewish commu
nity endorses gay rights. "We rec
ognize there's a diversity of opin
ion, but we're also committed to
supporting all the views," he said.
Three plainclothes police offi
cers were present at the gathering.
An a capella group and string
duet performed along with hula
hoopers, helping to set the carni
val atmosphere.
"I think it's been a real cele
bration of gay, lesbian and bisexu
al people. It's what it was
designed to be," Gilbert said.
