### Grace Lee Staff writer 
Popcorn and face-painting set the festive mood at
yesterday evening's "Queer Carnival," which pre
ceded a controversial presentation on homosexuality
sponsored by four campus Christian organizations.
Several hundred people attended the carnival, which
was held from 6:15 to 7 p.m. in front of Kresge Audito
rium. Pink balloons and armbands were distributed to
participants, who took them into the speech.
Organizer Rachel Maddow said its goal was to pre
sent an "alternative view" to that of speaker Darlene
Bogle, who argued that gays choose their lifestyle
and can change with the help of Jesus Christ.

Queerland, a campus gay rights group, planned
the event. Information tables set up by various cam
pus and community groups offered students differ
ent perspectives on homosexuality and religion.
Organizers also passed out a flier advising
respectful behavior during the evening's activities.
Maddow said the gathering was "less confronta
tional" than expected because "tons of people" in
support of the gay community attended. "Anyone
[anti-gay] who wanted a confrontation would have
been swarmed," she said.
Campus Crusade for Christ staff member Karen
Butler said the Queerland protest did not bother her
