# L.A. youths talk about 'living under siege'
## South-Central residents share their perspective on riots 
### Cheo H. Coker Staff writer 
Members of the Los Angeles Conservation
Corps spoke on the effects of recent riots on
their community in a program at Toyon last
night, addressing the positive changes they
have dedicated themselves to in the aftermath
of the Rodney King verdict.
As a result of the riots, Corps members
have had the opportunity to provide much
needed reconstructive services to the commu
nities in which they live.
"Since the riots, we've cleaned up the mess
and at the same time we've been distributing
food and clothing to people in the communi
ties," said Oscar Garay, who lived in South
Central for 17 years.
Like other members, he saw joining the
group as an opportunity to provide communi
ty service while earning money.
The Los Angeles Conservation Corps is
made up of youth from various racial back
grounds, ages 18 to 23.
The group provides students the opportuni
ty to learn leadership skills and a GED while
they renovate parks, rebuild walkways and
paint over graffiti in residential areas like
Burbank and Beverly Hills.
Having experienced economic disparities
first-hand, group members reacted to the riots
as the inevitable consequence of years of gov
ernmental neglect and growing racial tensions
between the police and black and Latino com
munities.
They said the new-found attention from

the media and the national government has
been overwhelming, but long overdue.
"It seems like it took the riot for money to
start floating in," said Corps member Lawan
da Hart, adding that politicians — eager for
votes — have paid more attention to the prob
lems of the inner cities in recent weeks than
ever before.

"We've gotten several grants, people pump
ing so much money into Los Angeles now that
it's almost blinding," said Corps member
Earnest Verdell.
The group has helped organize and dis
tribute the deluge of supplies coming in from
places like Sears and J.C. Penney.
"I have mixed emotions," Garay said of the
attention. "Like my little sister said, 'It's
about time something like this happened."'
Verdell said so many "fly by night" organi
zations have been campaigning for funds, it
has been hard for groups like the Corps to
receive all of the funds they need.
But the group's longevity will allow them to

realize their mission of providing the ground
work for fundamental change.
"After all of the novelty [of the situation]
wears off, then you can see what established
groups like the Corps can really do," Verdell
said.
According to Multicultural Educator Greg
Ricks, the program's organizer, the talk on
"The Real Deal: Youth Living Under Siege"
not only acknowledged the accomplishments
of the group, but also gave Stanford students
a more realistic view of the riots.
"My first concern was to let these people
know the importance of the contributions
they're making to their community right now,
and that they're not forgotten," Ricks said.
He added that the media has presented a
distorted picture of the riots.
The purpose of the program was to erase
some of these ambiguities by having students
learn "the real deal" from peers who had expe
rienced the riots first-hand, Ricks said.
"We know that it's more than just fires and
more than property damage, it's more than
just looting" he said.
"These students are youth under siege, but
they're making a difference, trying to get an
education, trying to make a life for them
selves."
The Stanford community's reaction to hav
ing the opportunity to meet with the students
has been positive.
"It's good to hear a voice from the commu
nity and not just the media, because the media
gives you a warped picture," freshman Jomo
Graham said.

'We've gotten several
grants, people pumping so
much money into Los
Angeles now that it's
almost blinding.'
