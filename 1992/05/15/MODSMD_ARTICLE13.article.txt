## A 						blow to diversity

Law School budget cuts
threaten to hurt equal
access to law education

THE LAW SCHOOL'S bud
get-cutting plan threatens to
erode the school's present
diversity and discourage law stu
dents from public service careers.
The school plans to raise tuition
10.9 percent — slightly higher
than the 9.5 percent increase in
undergraduate tuition — as well as
make its financial aid packages
less generous.
The plan would do a disservice
to Law School students, but even
more importantly, to potential law
students.
Financial aid cuts make it more
difficult for students to access a
Stanford education, and represent
a direct threat to ethnic diversity.
Since a higher proportion of stu
dents from lower-income families
are non-white, the reduction in
overall aid will likely inhibit diver
sity by discouraging some minority
students from pursuing a Stanford
law degree.
Diversity is the lifeblood of
innovation, and should be priori
tized during even the most severe
budget crisis.
The fact that other law schools
are implementing similar cuts
does not justify them. Rather, it
worsens the situation.
By placing a legal education
even further out of reach, the cuts
only enhance the image of law
schools as elitist, non-inclusive
institutions, and represent a huge
step backward for higher educa
tion.
It is particularly ironic that
these cuts should coincide with the
recent Rodney King verdict.
The acquittal of four white
police officers who were video
taped beating a black motorist
demonstrated to many Americans
that minority issues need to be
addressed within the legal system,

which remains a mostly white
institution.
Although Law School adminis
trators claim the cuts will not
affect the overall number of appli
cants, the demographics of candi
dates will likely change.
The lack of a noticeable decrease
in applicants does not mean that
opportunities won't decrease for
some.
And another of the Law
School's budgetary measures will
likely reduce career opportunities
for its public-service oriented stu
dents — by making it more finan
cially difficult for graduates to
enter those fields.
In the most distressing cut of
all, the Law School decided to
reduce funding to its Public Inter
est Low Income Forgiveness Pro
gram, an exemplary program that
reduces the financial burden of
students who take jobs in the pub
lic service sector.
With tuition on the rise, more
and more students will feel pres
sured to enter higher-paying fields
in order to pay back their loans.
While cuts have to be made
somewhere, it is hard to justify the
cut to this program, which only
aids about 10 students per year as
it is.
Stanford Law School should feel
an obligation to encourage its stu
dents, some of the brightest and
most capable in the world, to put
their talents toward effecting posi
tive change in our troubled society.
The recent outbreaks of vio
lence in Los Angeles and other
cities demonstrate the need for
students to pursue careers that
address real urban problems —
rather than heading straight to
Wall Street to be subsumed by a
Sherman McCoy-esque, "Master of
the Universe" greed.
The high tuition rates of other
institutions, despite what Law
School administrators say, should
not make Stanford's increase any
less disheartening. Indeed, we
should be lamenting a lost chance
to provide a world-class education
to all those who qualify.
