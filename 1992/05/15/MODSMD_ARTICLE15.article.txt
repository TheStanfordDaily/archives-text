## El Salvador — Peace at last? 
### 
SALVADORANS AND PEOPLE
worldwide were horrified when the
army, engaged in massive fighting
with FMLN guerillas in fall 1989, mur
dered six Jesuit priests, their housekeep
er and her daughter in cold blood.
Yet today, there is a widespread feel
ing that, after decades of denial of human
rights and social justice for this tiny,
densely-populated country's majority —
and 12 years of civil war that killed
75,000 and led an estimated million to
flee — a key transformation has occurred
that may finally bring peace.
Political Science Prof. Terry Karl, who
directs Stanford's Center for Latin Amer
ican Studies, sees special significance in
the emotional events of Jan. 16, 1992,
when the peace treaty in El Salvador was
formally signed.
FMLN commanders and President
Alfredo Cristiani, whom she says "sur
prised everyone" by his firmness to sup
port peace, shook hands for the first time.
In San Salvador, where war and carnage
once prevailed, army and rebel leaders
stood in unison, and banners of the
FMLN, the ruling ARENA party and
assassinated Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo
Romero floated together.
Karl emphasizes the key role played by
international actors in the process of nego
tiations, particularly the United Nations,
in pressuring both sides to come to a nego
tiated agreement — a process that would

have been impossible during the Cold War.
Following constitutional amendments
and the army's acquiescence, under gen
uine pressure from the U.S. Congress, to
allowing army reductions, dismantling the
security apparatus and integrating the
FLMN guerillas into the new police force,
the FMLN agreed to lay down its arms.
Observers say they are encouraged by
such moves, although a recent move by
the government to integrate sections of
the security network into the army has
worried many.
The major stumbling block is now the
issue of land reform — how to rectify the
blatantly uneven land distribution: in the
19705, 0.7 and 93 percent of the land
parcels constituted 40 and 30 percent of
cultivated land, respectively.
The resolution of the Salvadoran con
flict contains important lessons for U.S.
foreign policy makers, Karl believes. U.S.
policies supporting of multilateral initia
tives that promote peaceful outcomes may
be more effective than unilateral policies
of promoting militarization and "low
intensity warfare," which often bolstered
"unsavory" allies such as the corrupt,
repressive Salvadoran army, she says.
"Both [the army and the FMLN] killed
many people, but now, there is hope," said
a Stanford employee from northwestern
El Salvador. He stressed the gradual
nature of the peace process, backing Pres
ident Cristiani's stance that "12 years of

war cannot be undone in 24 hours," and
that change may come slower than many
people hungry for justice would like.
Many Salvadorans are now returning
home, despite worries over a recent rise in
banditism — a desperate resort amid frus
tration over high unemployment and diffi
cult living conditions due to the stagnant,
war-torn economy. Recent returnees from
the U.S. tend to be targets, he added.
But optimism remains the prevalent
feeling. Karl, who knew two of the
Jesuits well, and had called them two
days before their death to congratulate
them on their nomination for a presti
gious Stanford award, feels that the out
come of the current peace process would
have heartened them.
"If the priests could see the important
impact that their death had in mobilizing
the Salvadoran left, right and U.S. policy
makers to strive for their own ultimate
goal — a peaceful, just society in El Sal
vador — they would be proud of their
deaths' meaningfulness," Karl says.
"Such an outcome may be of some conso
lation for the enormous loss of life their
country has suffered."
