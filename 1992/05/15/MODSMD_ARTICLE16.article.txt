Coordinator responds to criticism of electric car project

The Stanford Hybrid Automobile
Research Project would like to
thank Lalitesh Katragadda and
Sebastian Simsch for their challenging
questions as to the validity of our pro
ject. Only by bringing such intellectual
stimuli out into the open can the level of
intellect at Stanford grow.
"The electricity used to charge hybrid
cars comes from a pollution-emitting
source like oil, coal or nuclear energy
According to Pacific Gas and Electric's
environmental action department, who
we contacted yesterday, only 26 percent
of PG&E's power comes from fossil fuel
sources, the only sources that emit pol
lution comparable to that of a gas-pow
ered car.
Fossil fuel burned in a power plant
produces only 8 percent of the pollutants
which are produced by a normal gas-pow
ered gas car: hardly comparable! During

off-peak hours, when a hybrid car would
normally be charged, PG&E produces all
its power from non-polluting sources,
such as geothermal and hydro.
"Energy production from these
sources is not significantly more efficient
than running an internal combustion
engine. . .A power plant using fossil
fuel is about 40 percent efficient. A car's
internal combustion engine is 15-20 per
cent efficient. A doubling of efficiency
cannot be deemed "not significant."
Even when burning gasoline, the
SHARP vehicle is 50 percent more effi
cient than a standard automobile.
"An enormous loss of electrical energy
occurs during its transmission from the
power plant to the consumer": According
to PG&E, power transmitted to Stanford
from: the San Francisco power station
loses 0.5 percent, the East Bay power
station loses 1.0 percent and the Moss

Landing power station (near Monterey)
loses 1.2 percent. I wish the SHARP
vehicle suffered such "enormous losses."
. .Batteries contain highly toxic chem
icals which will cause several waste dis
posal problems and environmental dam
age when used on a large scale": Lead-acid
batteries are currently the batteries used
in cars, boats and golf-carts. Battery man
ufacturers make their batteries in a man
ner that allows recycling, since reusing
materials significantly cuts their cost.
"The brain power of today's smart
undergraduate engineers might be better
spent on the development of new technolo
gies for mass transport than on commeri
cal-interest projects that promote the dan
gerous status quo": How many hybrid
cars have you seen out on the highways
of our status quo? Only by building what
the public will drive will our solution
have any effect. We aspire to create an

environmentally friendly vehicle that
someone might actually want to buy.
How can a mechanical engineering
grad student be so utterly misinformed?
Even a Weenie graduate would know ele
mentary efficiency and emissions statis
tics. Rejecting an effort to help the envi
ronment based on the argument that
other problems will still exist is ludi
crous, short-sighted, closed-minded and
very Berkeley-like, to boot.
The brain power of today's smart
graduate engineers and history majors
might be better spent developing other
environmentally friendly technologies,
rather than writing misinformed, argu
mentative letters to The Daily in a des
perate attempt to undermine the work
of more than 100 people.
