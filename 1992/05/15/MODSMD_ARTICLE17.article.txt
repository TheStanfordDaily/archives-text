Let's talk sour grapes.
Let's talk purposeful oppression of
the unlucky.
Let's talk Draw.
Yes, I drew badly, again. In four years
at Stanford I will never live in good
housing. I will never live in a place I
actually wanted to live in. Flo Mo, Stern
(when the food was bad), Manzanita (the
trailers, not the dorm), Terra (for a
quarter) and now, it looks like Wilbur or
Stern again.
Needless to say I'm unhappy. What's
worse, my totals (2,610, 3,921, 2,210)
add up to 8,741, not even enough to get
into the 10,000 club. So I don't even
have a right to complain — except to my
annoyingly lucky friend who lives in
Branner, Toyon and Roble.
But beyond moaning and whining, I

want to suggest a solution, which at this
point won't help me but could help
unlucky students in years to come.
Here's the pitch: Make one year
guaranteed good housing (say 1 to
1,500), one year guaranteed mediocre
housing (from 1,500 to 3,000) and one
year lousy housing (3,000 and up). This
would mean everyone would actually
know what it is like to live in a dorm
without roaches. As of now, that's not
the case.
I know, the legions of the lucky and
the wannabe lucky will say that I got
what I deserved. That's the way the dice
fall, deal with it and quit your bitching.
But somehow I can't see a Manzanita
trailer being worth $20,000 or more a
year.
Housing should be fair, not based
completely on chance. All we want is our
fair shot and a nice room. Just once. Is
that too much to ask?
