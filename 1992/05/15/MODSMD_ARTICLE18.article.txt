# Reader suggests name change: Serbian Daily
## 
### 
Having in mind what has been pub
lished in your paper lately, I humbly
suggest that you change your name from
Stanford Daily to Serbian Daily, or at
least print half of your text in Cyrillic.
If you really have to give space to the
apologists of Serbian fascism, please
show some style and start to print some
of their classical texts. That would serve
both purposes, namely express the Ser
bian point of view and enlighten your
readers as to why the informed part of
the civilized world is up against it.
Here is a partial list of documents for
your convenience: "Nacertanije" by Ilija
Garasanin, "Until Yours or Our Extermi
nation" by Nikola Stojanovic, "Exodus of
Albanians" by Vasa Cubrilovic and "Homo
geneous Serbia" by Steven Moljevic.
From this rich opus I can recommend

two texts to start with: "Homogeneous
Serbia," written in 1941 but by the sim
ple economical language explaining why
and where the war is being waged today;
and "Exodus of Albanians," written in
1937, so detailed and scientific in meth
ods of oppression that it deserves a spe
cial place in the whole story. Just what
can be expected from a prominent Ser
bian academician, and also the terrorist
involved in the assassination of Arch
duke Ferdinand in 1914.
May Saint Sava bless you and other
true friends of Serbia.
