# Speech by 'former lesbian' sparks gay-rights protest
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Pink-clad gay-rights activists
challenged a "former lesbian"
about her belief that homosexuals
choose their "sinful" lifestyle in a
passionate but mostly respectful
exchange last night.
About 600 people, both
activists and supporters of speak
er Darlene Bogle's views, attend
ed "Homosexuality 101." Queer
land, a campus gay-rights organi
zation, held a "Queer Carnival"
outside Kresge Auditorium before
the speech (see related story).
After Bogle's 45-minute talk,
which was sponsored by four cam
pus Christian ministries, both
groups questioned and comment
ed on her statements at an open
microphone.
Pink balloons and armbands
marked the gay-rights support
ers, who frequently applauded
Bogle's speech.
Their response was encouraged
by a Queerland flier stating that
"it would be just plain tacky to boo
or hiss at this bigot. Hell, she's one
of us, anyway. So the first five or
six times she says 'lesbian' or
'homosexual' or, even better,
'sodomize,' let's cheer to celebrate
sexual diversity."
Bogle, a minister who counsels
former homosexuals, spoke about
her own past as a lesbian and her
belief that gay people can become
heterosexual through a relation
ship with Jesus Christ.
She began the speech by

acknowledging the different per
spectives of audience members.
"Pink is my favorite color," she
told the crowd. "The world is big
enough for diverse opinions. I am
not a bigot, not anti-gay and not
homophobic."
The speech centered on Bogle's
own homosexual experiences,
which she said began at a Chris
tian college when she was seven
teen. "I began to deal with the
reality that I was a sexual being.
All of us are sexual beings," she
said, earning a round of applause
from the audience.

Bogle said her homosexuality
was the result of a dysfunctional
home where alcohol and abuse were
common, adding that many of the
former homosexuals she counsels
are also products of abusive homes.
A woman who identified herself
as the mother of a gay man told
Bogle she was offended by the
speech.
"As a parent, I am offended by
the assumption that gay people
are gay because they come from
dysfunctional families," she said.
