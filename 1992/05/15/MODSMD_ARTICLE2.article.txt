# Speech by 'former lesbian' sparks gay-rights protest
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Pink-clad gay-rights activists
challenged a "former lesbian"
about her belief that homosexuals
choose their "sinful" lifestyle in a
passionate but mostly respectful
exchange last night.
About 600 people, both
activists and supporters of speak
er Darlene Bogle's views, attend
ed "Homosexuality 101." Queer
land, a campus gay-rights organi
zation, held a "Queer Carnival"
outside Kresge Auditorium before
the speech (see related story).
After Bogle's 45-minute talk,
which was sponsored by four cam
pus Christian ministries, both
groups questioned and comment
ed on her statements at an open
microphone.
Pink balloons and armbands
marked the gay-rights support
ers, who frequently applauded
Bogle's speech.
Their response was encouraged
by a Queerland flier stating that
"it would be just plain tacky to boo
or hiss at this bigot. Hell, she's one
of us, anyway. So the first five or
six times she says 'lesbian' or
'homosexual' or, even better,
'sodomize,' let's cheer to celebrate
sexual diversity."
Bogle, a minister who counsels
former homosexuals, spoke about
her own past as a lesbian and her
belief that gay people can become
heterosexual through a relation
ship with Jesus Christ.
She began the speech by

acknowledging the different per
spectives of audience members.
"Pink is my favorite color," she
told the crowd. "The world is big
enough for diverse opinions. I am
not a bigot, not anti-gay and not
homophobic."
The speech centered on Bogle's
own homosexual experiences,
which she said began at a Chris
tian college when she was seven
teen. "I began to deal with the
reality that I was a sexual being.
All of us are sexual beings," she
said, earning a round of applause
from the audience.

Bogle said her homosexuality
was the result of a dysfunctional
home where alcohol and abuse were
common, adding that many of the
former homosexuals she counsels
are also products of abusive homes.
A woman who identified herself
as the mother of a gay man told
Bogle she was offended by the
speech.
"As a parent, I am offended by
the assumption that gay people
are gay because they come from
dysfunctional families," she said.
"As a Christian, I am offended by the
judgement that the relationship of my
son and his partner is not morally heal
ing."
Another woman criticized Bogle's
association of homosexuality with
promiscuity and drug abuse.
Other speakers condemned homosexu
ality.
One speaker said that "Christianity is
the only true faith" and "AIDS is a plague
that has been sent by God as a punish
ment" for homosexual behavior.

Bogle responded by saying she agrees
that Christianity is the true faith, but she
does not think AIDS is a punishment.
"I just pray we find a cure," she said.
Bogle said she was involved with a
woman who killed herself, like many
other young homosexuals who "commit
suicide because they do not find accep
tance and a place of healing within the
church."
Because she could not find a place in
the church, Bogle said she hung out in
gay bars, where she faced the threats of
gay-bashers and police raids.
She was actively involved in what she
called the "gay lifestyle" and said she par
ticipated in the first Gay Pride week in
San Francisco.

When she received loud cheers, she
replied, "Thank you for your applause,
but I'm not proud of that."
Bogle said her dialogue with Jesus
Christ allowed her to reject her homosex
uality. "Did I just wake up one morning
and say, 'Whoopee! I am going to be het
erosexual today'? I wish it were that
easy."
"It has been a progressive struggle. I
do not struggle with same-sex attraction"
any more, she said.
Reverend Herb Schmidt, the Lutheran
Campus Pastor, disagreed with Bogle's
assertion that the Bible prohibits homo
sexual relationships.
"Is there anything in the Scriptures
that condemns loving, caring relation

ships between homosexual partners?" he
asked.
"Our sexuality is a gift of God, but
homosexuality is not a gift of God," Bogle
replied. "I could affirm the (homosexual)
person, but not the act."
Activists also pointed out that
although homosexuals felt free to speak
at last night's speech, they would nor
mally have to hide their sexual orienta
tion.
"Some of the people who came to sup
port [Bogle's views] may be feeling
oppressed (by the large number of
activists). But this is the oppression that
gay people experience every day," one
student said.
Bogle said she understood the oppres

sion homosexuals feel because she "spent
17 years going through that same oppres
sion.
"I have a lot of friends who are still in
the gay community. They do not agree
with me and I do not agree with them,"
she said. "I am heterosexual, not because
I go out to do the acts of heterosexuality,
but because God intended us to be male
and female."
Sophomore John Newsome, wearing a
pink and silver tiara, said the speech and
carnival were "the most positive experi
ence" he has had at Stanford.
"People among the queer community,
look around and see how much support
you have in the Stanford community," he
said.

although homosexuals felt free to speak
at last night's speech, they would nor
mally have to hide their sexual orienta
tion.
"Some of the people who came to sup
port [Bogle's views] may be feeling
oppressed (by the large number of
activists). But this is the oppression that
gay people experience every day," one
student said.
Bogle said she understood the oppres

sion homosexuals feel because she "spent
17 years going through that same oppres
sion.
"I have a lot of friends who are still in
the gay community. They do not agree
with me and I do not agree with them,"
she said. "I am heterosexual, not because
I go out to do the acts of heterosexuality,
but because God intended us to be male
and female."
Sophomore John Newsome, wearing a
pink and silver tiara, said the speech and
carnival were "the most positive experi
ence" he has had at Stanford.
"People among the queer community,
look around and see how much support
you have in the Stanford community," he
said.
Pink-clad gay-rights activists
challenged a "former lesbian"
about her belief that homosexuals
choose their "sinful" lifestyle in a
passionate but mostly respectful
exchange last night.
About 600 people, both
activists and supporters of speak
er Darlene Bogle's views, attend
ed "Homosexuality 101." Queer
land, a campus gay-rights organi
zation, held a "Queer Carnival"
outside Kresge Auditorium before
the speech (see related story).
After Bogle's 45-minute talk,
which was sponsored by four cam
pus Christian ministries, both
groups questioned and comment
ed on her statements at an open
microphone.
Pink balloons and armbands
marked the gay-rights support
ers, who frequently applauded
Bogle's speech.
Their response was encouraged
by a Queerland flier stating that
"it would be just plain tacky to boo
or hiss at this bigot. Hell, she's one
of us, anyway. So the first five or
six times she says 'lesbian' or
'homosexual' or, even better,
'sodomize,' let's cheer to celebrate
sexual diversity."
Bogle, a minister who counsels
former homosexuals, spoke about
her own past as a lesbian and her
belief that gay people can become
heterosexual through a relation
ship with Jesus Christ.
She began the speech by

acknowledging the different per
spectives of audience members.
"Pink is my favorite color," she
told the crowd. "The world is big
enough for diverse opinions. I am
not a bigot, not anti-gay and not
homophobic."
The speech centered on Bogle's
own homosexual experiences,
which she said began at a Chris
tian college when she was seven
teen. "I began to deal with the
reality that I was a sexual being.
All of us are sexual beings," she
said, earning a round of applause
from the audience.

Bogle said her homosexuality
was the result of a dysfunctional
home where alcohol and abuse were
common, adding that many of the
former homosexuals she counsels
are also products of abusive homes.
A woman who identified herself
as the mother of a gay man told
Bogle she was offended by the
speech.
"As a parent, I am offended by
the assumption that gay people
are gay because they come from
dysfunctional families," she said.
"As a Christian, I am offended by the
judgement that the relationship of my
son and his partner is not morally heal
ing."
Another woman criticized Bogle's
association of homosexuality with
promiscuity and drug abuse.
Other speakers condemned homosexu
ality.
One speaker said that "Christianity is
the only true faith" and "AIDS is a plague
that has been sent by God as a punish
ment" for homosexual behavior.

Bogle responded by saying she agrees
that Christianity is the true faith, but she
does not think AIDS is a punishment.
"I just pray we find a cure," she said.
Bogle said she was involved with a
woman who killed herself, like many
other young homosexuals who "commit
suicide because they do not find accep
tance and a place of healing within the
church."
Because she could not find a place in
the church, Bogle said she hung out in
gay bars, where she faced the threats of
gay-bashers and police raids.
She was actively involved in what she
called the "gay lifestyle" and said she par
ticipated in the first Gay Pride week in
San Francisco.

When she received loud cheers, she
replied, "Thank you for your applause,
but I'm not proud of that."
Bogle said her dialogue with Jesus
Christ allowed her to reject her homosex
uality. "Did I just wake up one morning
and say, 'Whoopee! I am going to be het
erosexual today'? I wish it were that
easy."
"It has been a progressive struggle. I
do not struggle with same-sex attraction"
any more, she said.
Reverend Herb Schmidt, the Lutheran
Campus Pastor, disagreed with Bogle's
assertion that the Bible prohibits homo
sexual relationships.
"Is there anything in the Scriptures
that condemns loving, caring relation

ships between homosexual partners?" he
asked.
"Our sexuality is a gift of God, but
homosexuality is not a gift of God," Bogle
replied. "I could affirm the (homosexual)
person, but not the act."
Activists also pointed out that
although homosexuals felt free to speak
at last night's speech, they would nor
mally have to hide their sexual orienta
tion.
