"It would be just plain
tacky to boo or hiss at this
bigot. Hell, she's one of us,
anyway. So the first five or
six times she says 'lesbian'
or 'homosexual' or, even bet
ter, 'sodomize,' let's cheer to
celebrate sexual diversity."
â€” A flier circulated by
Queerland, a campus gay
rights group, before Darlene
Bogle's speech last night.
The organization objected to
Bogle's argument that
homosexuality is a choice
she rejected with God's help.
