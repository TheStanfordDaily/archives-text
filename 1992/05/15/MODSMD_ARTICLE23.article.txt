## Women netters humble Rebels in second-round play Card to face Golden Bears in quarterfinal grudge match 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's tennis
team overcame nerves and a red
hot Paloma Collantes to beat Mis
sissippi 5-1 and move on to the
quarterfinals of the NCAA Cham
pionships.
Heather Willens had the mis
fortune of facing Collantes, who
dictated the No. 1 singles match.
After Willens broke her serve in
the first game, Collantes came
back with explosive forehand
groundstrokes.
"She got me in a lot of cross
court rallies, which got her in a
groove," Willens said.
Not only did Collantes estab
lish a rhythm with her forehand
but also exploited one of Willens'
weakest shots — the forehand
groundstroke.
"Keep it away from her back
hand," Collantes said. "That was
what was going through my
mind. Her backhand is better. I
can do more on my forehand."
Colantes, the No. 6 singles
player in the country, quickly
took the first set, 6-1. She domi
nated points so totally that she
rarely had to move to a ball while
she yanked No. 3 Willens back
and forth like a yo-yo.
A point early in the second set
illustrated how much the match
was going Collantes' way. With a
penetrating approach shot, Wil
lens worked her way to net.
From well behind the baseline,
Collantes tossed up a weak lob.
Willens snapped an overhead
crosscourt, only to have Collantes
stab it for a down-the-line win
ner.
Collantes was on such a tear
that even taunts from a few Stan
ford football players didn't phase
her.
"A mosquito flew in my face
and 1 made a funny face," Col
lantes said. Her sour expression
drew a sarcastic response, which
amused the Mississippi sopho
more. "They said, 'Oh yuck!' I
completely lost it," Collantes
said.
However, she continued to win
points as she pushed her second
set lead to 4-0. But then Willens
ended her 10-game drought by
holding serve.
Was that game a sign of a
comeback? Collantes was pre
pared for a battle.
"She has a reputation of being
a fighter," Collantes said. "She
raised the level of her game."
The crowd got behind the Car
dinal junior and she broke Col
lantes' serve to come within two
games. With the momentum
shifting to Willens, she held serve

at love.
At 4-3, Collantes had to shake
off several unforced errors from
the previous game and try to hold
serve.
The Rebel fell behind 30-40.
Willens was one point away from
clawing back from 4-0 to draw
even at 4-4. With momentum and
the crowd on Willens side, it
appeared like the match would go
three sets.
But Collantes smacked a win
ner to pull to deuce and notched
the game, 5-3. She then broke
Willens' serve to win the match,
6-1, 6-4.
Coming off the court, the
Rebel admitted she was surprised
at how well she played.
"I hope I play that well again,"
said Collantes, who added that
Willens' game stacks up well
against hers.
"1 love to play her game, it's a
lot like mine. We both hit hard
from the baseline," she said.
Was Collantes' straight-set
win over Willens at the Ail-Amer
ican Championships in the fall an
indication that she had the Cardi
nal's number? Collantes didn't
think so.

"(At All-American), she was
nervous because it was her home
town. She went to Pacific Pal
isades High and everything," Col
lantes said. "I had already played
a match earlier that day and I was
tired so it was a completely differ
ent match. I played much better
this match," she said.
Willens attempted to throw
the Rebel off her rhythm, but
nothing seemed to disturb Col
lantes.
"I tried to roll it over and slice
but it didn't really work," said
Willens who, though disappoint
ed, was matter-of-fact about the
defeat.
"She just had a great day,"
Willens said. "What's good about
the NCAAs is that it's a new tour
nament tomorrow."
And what's even better for the
Cardinal players is that they will
be there, thanks to a team effort
which offset Willens' loss.
In fact, by the time the junior
finished, fVeshman Amy
Chiminello and senior Kylie
Johnson had clinched victories.
Chiminello described her first
ever NCAA Championships
match as "awesome" and had rea

son to be positive about the con
test. She played a controlled
match to crush Sharla Barone 6-
1, 6-1 in the No. 5 slot.
"I played consistent when I
needed to and hit big shots wh6n
I needed to, rather than hitting
winners and then errors,"
Chiminello said. She fell back on
pre-match rituals to help fend off
any first-time NCAA butterflies.
"I was calm, which was kind of
surprising," Chiminello said. "I
treated it like any other match. I
didn't worry about the other
matches, but just concentrated
on mine. If I don't — and lose,
then I'm not helping the team."
Johnson, the senior co-cap
tain, did feel some nerves, which
she said was typical of the first
match in the tournament. The
feeling that this wasn't the every
day dual match was furthered by
unusual circumstances.
Stanford was scheduled for a 3
p.m. start but the Texas-William
and Mary match was still in
progress. So Johnson took the
No. 3 court while a Longhorn pair
was competing beside her.
"It was strange, having them
next to me. I wanted my team

mates out there," Johnson said.
But the veteran Cardinal was
able to focus on her match and
pull through a 6-2, 7-5 win
against Pascale Piquemal.
Miriuted later, sophomore
Laxmi Poruri wrapped up a 6-3,
6-3 victory over Alison Hill at No.
2 singles.
Even with the 3-1 lead, the
Cardinal could not relax. Kristine
Kurth was down 3-4 in the second
set of her match with Nina Top
per at No. 4.
The Stanford sophomore cap
tured the first set, 6-4.
The second was a see-saw bat
tle that Kurth finally got on top
of at 6-5. However, a tiebreak
seemed imminent as Kurth fell
down 0-40 on her serve.
But a rejuvenated serve-and
volley game pulled her to deuce.
After a few points, it was at
match point and Kurth slammed
the door on Topper with a service
winner.
"My serve is getting better,"
Kurth said. "Eventually I would
like to come to net as often as my
first serve goes in."


Rajiv Chandrasekaran — Daily
Heather Willens cracks a forehand in her No. 1 singles match with Mississippi's Paloma Collantes. Unfortunately for the Cardinal junior,
little was effective against the Rebel. Collantes won 6?1, 6-4. Stanford captured the dual match 5-1.
Kurth has gone back to an
attacking style after losing a few
matches at the end of the regular
season. She was tentative in
those contests because of a fear
that she would reinjure her back.
"Before Pac-lOs I was afraid I
was going to hurt my back. I was
inconsistent," said Kurth, who
rebounded at the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships to beat Ari
zona State's top player, Krista
Amend, and take eventual champi
on, Alix Creek, to a close three sets.
"Before Pac-lOs I just took tons of
painkillers and decided to go for it,"
she said.
Coach Frank Brennan com
mends Kurth's willingness to go
for shots but said sometimes her
competitiveness makes her hurry
points.
"She tends to be an impetuous
young woman," Brennan said.
"She likes to go fast and hit hard.
She's a very good competitor.
She's not the kind you have to
kick in the butt every once in a
while. You have to hold her back
or she'll go wild and crazy."

With Kurth's victory, only the
outcome of Emma Woodhouse's
match was up in the air.
After a torn hamstring kept
her out of the lineup for the last
two and a half months of the sea
son, Woodhouse returned to the
courts to face Ivy Conoley.
Mississippi's No. 6 player
cruised in the first set, benefitting
from Woodhouse errors. But the
Cardinal sophomore regrouped
after the 6-2 first set.
"If you attack, she's the type
of player you can beat," Wood
house said. "What's important is
to keep your errors down because
that's what she feeds off."
When Woodhouse was able to
cut down her mistakes but stay
aggressive, she rolled over Cono
ley, 2-6, 6-4, 6-1.
With the team victory, Stanford
earned a spot in today's quarterfi
nals. The Cardinal meets California
at 3 p.m. The squads split matches
this year. Stanford won 7-2 in a
multiple-rain-delay marathon in
February. A month ago the Bears
upset the Cardinal 5-4.
"A lot of people forget we won
the match at home," Brennan
said. "Now we're home and we'd
like to rectify that last match. The
team is anxious to play Cal."
