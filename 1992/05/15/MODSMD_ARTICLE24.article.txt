Entering the NCAA Champi
onships after a two-and-a-half
month break from tennis could
conceivably be a nerve-racking
experience.
For Emma Woodhouse, how
ever, it proved to be a positive
one yesterday. The sophomore
Cardinal fought her way back
from an early deficit and then
stayed strong, ousting senior
Rebel Ivy Conoley 2-6, 6-4, 6-1.
The wrap on her left leg
was a reminder of the torn
hamstring that has prevented
her from playing since mid
season.
At the beginning of the No. 6
singles match, her lack of time
on the court seemed to be a fac
tor, as she quickly fell to 0-4 in
the first set.
"You could say my shots left
something to be desired," she
said with a rueful smile. "My
opponent was the type of player
that scrambles really hard and
chases down everything until
you make a mistake. In the
beginning my own errors were
crushing me."
Assistant coach Lele Forood
attributed Woodhouse's slow
start to rustiness. "She was
setting points up well, but then
she was missing the clinching
shots," she said.
In addition, the four Advils
Woodhouse took before the
match as pain medication may
have slowed her down a little.
"For the first set, I felt really
weird and I couldn't even think
straight,'' she said.
"Then I think the effects
started to wear off and my head
cleared up for the rest of the
match. I think we'll have to
adjust the dosage for next
time."
Psychologically, she could
also feel the strain. "After not
playing for a while, sometimes
it can get really frustrating.
You don't make the right shot
selections — you wig out and go
for something weird. If you let
it bother you, it will put you in
a bad frame of mind," she said.
Woodhouse did not let this
frustration interfere with her
concentration or her confi
dence during the second set,
however. "I think there were
two turning points in the
match," she said. "At the
beginning of the second set I
started to get back into it;
before that I was just chunder
ing along. Then, after the first
game of the third set, I pretty
much felt I was in control."
The support of the Stanford
fans helped keep her in the

match. "Having the home crowd
is great," she said. "During the
patches where you feel like you
just want to snap a racket, hav
ing people cheering for you
helps calm you down."
After the pivotal second set,
Woodhouse was back in full
form. As she cruised to a 6-1 vic
tory in the third set, she played

aggressively without the un
forced errors that plagued her
earlier in the match. According
to Forood, "It was actually con
structive for Emma to play three
sets. It was like she got two
matches in one."
For the rest of the team,
Woodhouse's victory also meant
early retirement for the evening.

The win brought the overall
match tally to 5-1 in Stanford's
favor, clinching the outcome and
eliminating the need to play dou
bles.
The well-deserved break also
allowed Woodhouse to rest her
leg before her next match, which
will be played this afternoon
against California.

If Kristine Kurth devours opponents anything like she does hoagies
between sets, the sophomore will be difficult to beat. As an appetiz
er, she crunched Mississippi's Nina Topper 6-4, 7-5 in the second
round of the team tournament.
