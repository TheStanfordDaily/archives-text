# Barcelona no place for Laettner
## 90210 wanna-be no match for 'Eastern European thugs' 
### 
There they are. What has been
hailed as the finest basketball
team to ever represent the United
States was finalized earlier this week.
The names read off as plaques you will
find at the Basketball Hall of Fame in
Springfield, Mass. Johnson. Jordan.
Bird. Barkley. Malone. Ewing. Robin
son. Stockton. Pippen. Mullin. Drexler.
Laettner.
Laettner?!?
Wait a minute. These are supposed
to be the best players America has to
offer. The selection committee made
the right choice in keeping with tradi
tion by selecting at least one college
player to be on the squad. But they
chose the wrong one.
Granted, Ijaettner won almost every
major individual award in college bas
ketball this season, and was a great col
lege player. His buzzer beater to give
Duke a one-point victory in the NCAA
semis over Kentucky has a secure place
in NCAA history as one of the greatest
shots ever in the Tournament, and he
certainly has been a clutch player for
Duke in his four seasons in Durham,
N.C. The problem is, though, that he
will not be able to be Mr. Clutch for
USA Basketball. The only thing Laet
tner will be clutching in Barcelona is
the bench while he watches his team
mates inflict damage.
Ijaettner should also be, without a
doubt, a fine professional player in the
NBA. But the international game is a
completely different story. Laettner
simply does not have the muscle to bat
tle with steriod-laden brutes from East
ern Europe, or with Far Eastern sumo
wrestlers in high tops. International

hoops involves force—crashing and
banging under the boards in a widened
key. Even if he goes into a game with
U.S.-walloping Chile 118-32, he still
will be tossed out of the paint faster
than he can break a sweat.

There are many collegians who
would have been more useful towards
the U.S. quest for the gold. Sure, Laet
tner has the Ail-American image with
the Beverly Hills 90210 Sideburns. Put
him next to an unshaven Czech power
forward, however, and there will be no
question as to who'll win the battle
between Beauty and Beast.
Simply put, we need beef. Lots of it.
The U.S. is not merely seeking victory
and the gold medal this summer in
Barcelona. Rather, this is a mission of
total destruction, all-out annihilation.
We don't just want the other countries
to serve sangria to our hoopsters — we
want them to make it. Total acknowl
edgement of superiority is what is at
stake here.
If we bring Laettner in, opponents
will see it as a sign of weakness. A tan
dem of Patrick Ewingand David Robin
son in the post is bound to wear down

any opposing center. But just when the
U.S. is ready to deliver the knock out
punch, we bring in Laettner? No.
How about LSU's Shaquille O'Neal?
Blue Devil fans will say that Laettner
and Shaq both posted equal numbers
when the two teams met in December.
Yet 7-foot-1 Shaq would provide that
certain intangible to the Olympic team
— call it the "intimidation factor" —
that Laettner could not.
Shaq has both the height and the
bulk to make useful minutes out of
garbage time.
The same is true for Alonzo Mourn
ing of Georgetown, who is used to
rough play in the Big East Conference.
Better yet, why not send Byron Hous
ton of Oklahoma State, a 6-8 truck who
can thunder through the lane no mat
ter who stands in his way. Any of these
three would have been better choices
from the college ranks than Laettner.
Don't get me wrong — Laettner is an
excellent basketball player with out
standing ability. It's just that in the
Games he won't be able to utilize his
talent like he did in college or will in the
pros.
A better choice would have been to
tab Laettner for the Games in Atlanta
in 1996. By then, he will be used to the
more rigorous demands of the NBA and
will be prepared for overseas rules. But
at least there is one possible great
advantage to his being on this sum
mer's team, if he chooses to use it: bring
the Cameron Crazies to Spain. They'll
make the foreigners go nuts.

Schwartz is ready to sub for the team if
anyone gets hurt.

Laettner.
Laettner?!?
Wait a minute. These are supposed
to be the best players America has to
offer. The selection committee made
the right choice in keeping with tradi
tion by selecting at least one college
player to be on the squad. But they
chose the wrong one.
Granted, Ijaettner won almost every
major individual award in college bas
ketball this season, and was a great col
lege player. His buzzer beater to give
Duke a one-point victory in the NCAA
semis over Kentucky has a secure place
in NCAA history as one of the greatest
shots ever in the Tournament, and he
certainly has been a clutch player for
Duke in his four seasons in Durham,
N.C. The problem is, though, that he
will not be able to be Mr. Clutch for
USA Basketball. The only thing Laet
tner will be clutching in Barcelona is
the bench while he watches his team
mates inflict damage.
Ijaettner should also be, without a
doubt, a fine professional player in the
NBA. But the international game is a
completely different story. Laettner
simply does not have the muscle to bat
tle with steriod-laden brutes from East
ern Europe, or with Far Eastern sumo
wrestlers in high tops. International

hoops involves force—crashing and
banging under the boards in a widened
key. Even if he goes into a game with
U.S.-walloping Chile 118-32, he still
will be tossed out of the paint faster
than he can break a sweat.

There are many collegians who
would have been more useful towards
the U.S. quest for the gold. Sure, Laet
tner has the Ail-American image with
the Beverly Hills 90210 Sideburns. Put
him next to an unshaven Czech power
forward, however, and there will be no
question as to who'll win the battle
between Beauty and Beast.
Simply put, we need beef. Lots of it.
The U.S. is not merely seeking victory
and the gold medal this summer in
Barcelona. Rather, this is a mission of
total destruction, all-out annihilation.
We don't just want the other countries
to serve sangria to our hoopsters — we
want them to make it. Total acknowl
edgement of superiority is what is at
stake here.
If we bring Laettner in, opponents
will see it as a sign of weakness. A tan
dem of Patrick Ewingand David Robin
son in the post is bound to wear down

any opposing center. But just when the
U.S. is ready to deliver the knock out
punch, we bring in Laettner? No.
How about LSU's Shaquille O'Neal?
Blue Devil fans will say that Laettner
and Shaq both posted equal numbers
when the two teams met in December.
Yet 7-foot-1 Shaq would provide that
certain intangible to the Olympic team
— call it the "intimidation factor" —
that Laettner could not.
Shaq has both the height and the
bulk to make useful minutes out of
garbage time.
The same is true for Alonzo Mourn
ing of Georgetown, who is used to
rough play in the Big East Conference.
Better yet, why not send Byron Hous
ton of Oklahoma State, a 6-8 truck who
can thunder through the lane no mat
ter who stands in his way. Any of these
three would have been better choices
from the college ranks than Laettner.
Don't get me wrong — Laettner is an
excellent basketball player with out
standing ability. It's just that in the
Games he won't be able to utilize his
talent like he did in college or will in the
pros.
A better choice would have been to
tab Laettner for the Games in Atlanta
in 1996. By then, he will be used to the
more rigorous demands of the NBA and
will be prepared for overseas rules. But
at least there is one possible great
advantage to his being on this sum
mer's team, if he chooses to use it: bring
the Cameron Crazies to Spain. They'll
make the foreigners go nuts.

Schwartz is ready to sub for the team if
anyone gets hurt.
