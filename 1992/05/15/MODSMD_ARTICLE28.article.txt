# Men begin NCAA play tomorrow
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
At last, the games begin. The 1992
NCAA Men's Tennis Championships
began this morning in steamy Athens,
Ga. The Cardinal, seeded second behind
USC, received a first-round bye and will
play their first match tomorrow.
For the first five days of competi
tion, players vie for the coveted team
title. After that, individual competi
tion begins in singles and doubles.
Stanford will play the winner of
today's Duke-Miami matchup. The
Cardinal defeated the No. 13 Hurri
canes in a February dual match at
home, 5-1. The 'Canes boast two play
ers in the top 50, No. 34 Dean Cohen
and No. 44 Fredrik Perman. In the
earlier dual match, Cohen defeated
Stanford's Robert Devens at fourth
singles in straight sets while No. 3-
ranked Alex O'Brien defeated Perman
in three sets.
The No. 16 Blue Devils are more of
a mystery team. They are led by No.
33 Geoff Grant and No. 57 David Hall.
Regardless of their opponent on
Saturday, the Cardinal men are ready
to go. "We've got a few nicks and

bruises but we're ready to get out of
here," said head coach Dick Gould
before leaving for Georgia. "Every
one's real excited. You never know
what to expect (at NCAAs)."
For several of the sophomore
starters on the team, this will be their
first trip to the national champi
onships. "I'm not really nervous —
well, a little bit. But I'm also excited,"
Devens said. "I don't think we're the
best team going into the tournament
but on any given day we have the
potential to win. We shouldn't go in
thinking about winning (the tourna
ment), we should just go for that next
(match) win."
Co-captain O'Brien had similar feel
ings. "Obviously we're thinking about
winning the tournament and it is very
important to us, but we're going to
have to fight in every single match."
This will be a bit of a new experi
ence for seniors O'Brien and Jason
Yee. The pair have been members of
two Cardinal teams which totally
dominated their way through the sea
son to national championships. Last
year, the Cardinal also dominated
throughout the season, and the
thought of not winning a fourth con

secutive team title never occurred to
many of the players.
"Last year I thought for sure we'd
win," O'Brien recalled. "So it just goes
to show what can happen down there."
Sophomore Vimal Patel agreed:
"Last year we had the greatest team
ever. Losing the NCAA title never
crossed my mind, and maybe that is
why we lost it."
But lose they did — 5-2 to USC.
This year the top-seeded Trojans and
the third-seeded Bruins have domi
nated the Pacific 10 Conference and
the nation, while the Cardinal has
spent the season trying to catch up.
So the big question remains: can
the Cardinal overcome their Southern
rivals? Sitting in his office Tuesday
afternoon, coach Gould chuckled. "I
just hope we have the opportunity to
find out. It'll be an interesting chal
lenge just to get that far."
Card Notes
Alex O'Brien was just named Volvo
Tennis/Senior Player of the Year for the
western region. The national winner from
the eight regions will be announced later
this month. Meanwhile, Jason Yee
received the Head/Arthur Ashe Sports
manship Award for the western region.
