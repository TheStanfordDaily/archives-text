# Religion vs. homosexuality: Student groups take sides
## 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
For the past few days, several Christian groups have been com
peting with gay-rights advocates for campus attention, posting
fliers that parody each other and even distributing fliers door-to
door in efforts to gain wider audiences.
The controversial speaker being publicized raised the ire of the
gay community last night by espousing the idea that homosexual
ity is a choice — one that people can control with the help of God.
This position, as well as the methods of promotion for the
event — which some found offensive — disturbed many gay stu
dents and motivated them to organize the celebratory pro-gay
gathering outside Kresge Auditorium last night.
But the disparity between the opinions of gay community mem
bers and some religious groups existed before last night's event. It
is a long-standing conflict that has arisen many times at Stanford.
