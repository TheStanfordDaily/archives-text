# Religion vs. homosexuality: Student groups take sides
## 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
For the past few days, several Christian groups have been com
peting with gay-rights advocates for campus attention, posting
fliers that parody each other and even distributing fliers door-to
door in efforts to gain wider audiences.
The controversial speaker being publicized raised the ire of the
gay community last night by espousing the idea that homosexual
ity is a choice — one that people can control with the help of God.
This position, as well as the methods of promotion for the
event — which some found offensive — disturbed many gay stu
dents and motivated them to organize the celebratory pro-gay
gathering outside Kresge Auditorium last night.
But the disparity between the opinions of gay community mem
bers and some religious groups existed before last night's event. It
is a long-standing conflict that has arisen many times at Stanford.
'Not an isolated case'
Earlier this month, a student
requested — and received — a
room change on the basis of reli
gious beliefs that renounce homo
sexuality. University officials did
not condone the request, but they
acknowledged religious beliefs as
a legitimate reason for refusing to
room with someone who is gay.
And gay community members
say incidents like this are not
uncommon at Stanford, despite
significant strides that have been
made on some gay, lesbian and
bisexual issues.

'On the policy level,
it's good. On the per
sonal level there's a
lot to be done.'
—Barney Cheng

"On the policy level, it's good.
On the personal level there's a lot
to be done," said junior Barney
Cheng, the Hammarsjkold House
resident whose roommate refused
to live with him.
Cheng recalled receiving an
obscene message on his answering
machine — targeted at his sexual

orientation — soon after his case
became publicly known on campus.
Although crank calls to openly
gay students do not occur fre
quently, Cheng said his is "not an
isolated case," and the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community
Center also receives such calls on
occasion.
Responses to the gay commu
nity's Needs Assessment Surveys
further evidenced the existence of
anti-gay sentiment — and its reli
gious undertones — on campus.
The surveys, distributed during
winter quarter, were aimed to
more accurately define and meet
the needs of gay, lesbian and bisex
ual students. But they elicited a
larger negative response than
some had anticipated, said LGBCC
coordinator Eleanor Feingold.
Some students wrote "Go to
Hell" on their surveys, she said.
And others stapled articles, clip
pings and sermons denouncing
homosexuality to their responses.
Irreconcilable differences?
Some students say their reli
gious views are irreconcilable with
homosexuality, and cite religious
texts to back up their arguments.
But other religious leaders and gay
individuals believe religious reasons
are just excuses to mask prejudice.
According to Diana Akiyama,
Assoc. Dean of Memorial Church,
no passage in the Christian Bible
explicitly denounces homosexuality.
"If you look for hard and fast
rules (in the original text, which is
Greek) it's pretty hard to prove"

that being gay is wrong, she said.
Translations of the Bible with
phrases explicitly condemning
homosexuality "have been ques
tioned by Biblical scholars,"
Akiyama added.

But Dorman Followwill, pastor
of college students at Peninsula
Bible Church, said, "Biblically
speaking, homosexuality as a
lifestyle is not what God intended."
"To go against the way we were

designed doesn't make a lot of
sense," Followwill said, adding
that the Apostle Paul said homo
sexuality was "against nature."
Despite this conflict, gay, les
bian and bisexual individuals are
still "loved greatly by God," Fol
lowwill said.
This perspective, which many
gay individuals find objectionable,
doesn't surprise sophomore Say
deah Howard, who identifies her
self as a bisexual. "Coming from a
religious background, this is old
news to me," Howard said, adding
that her father is a Southern Bap
tist minister.
"For me, being gay is not a
question of morality. It's natural.
It's normal," Howard said.
But many religions continue to
view homosexuality as unnatural,
and it is only in recent years that
some gay Christians and Jews
have gained acceptance within
their sects, religious leaders say.
For instance, Jewish texts
openly outlaw gay men, and"the
Torah's treatment of male homo
sexuality as a capital offense has
remained enforced until this gen
eration," according to Rabbi Ari
Cartun of Stanford's B'nai B'rith
Hillel Foundation.
However, there is a "great deal
of sympathy" for homosexuals in
Judaism's Reform, Reconstruc
tionist and Conservative move
ments today.
More people are beginning to
view "homosexuality as an orien
tation rather than a perverted
choice of action," he said,

although heterosexuality is still
considered "more optimal" if one
has a choice.

'It's sexual orienta
tion. It's the way
we're born.'
—Cliff Chan

Choice vs. identity
And the issue of choice is one
that arises frequently in the dia
logue between the gay community
and the church.
Yesterday's speaker said she
believed people have a choice
between gay and heterosexual
lifestyles. But some in the gay
community refuted this theory,
saying their sexual orientation
is an integral part of their iden
tity.
Cliff Chan is a Stanford gradu
ate who was involved with Chris
tian groups as an undergraduate
and didn't come out until seven
years after college. "It's really
damaging because a lot of the peo
ple that come with this kind of
message indicate that gay people
can change," Chan said.
"A lot of people want to believe
that. But I think it's pretty
crazy," he said. "It's sexual orien
tation. It's the way we're born.
It's dangerous if people come to
this and think 'If I try hard
enough I can change.'

gathering outside Kresge Auditorium last night.
But the disparity between the opinions of gay community mem
bers and some religious groups existed before last night's event. It
is a long-standing conflict that has arisen many times at Stanford.
'Not an isolated case'
Earlier this month, a student
requested — and received — a
room change on the basis of reli
gious beliefs that renounce homo
sexuality. University officials did
not condone the request, but they
acknowledged religious beliefs as
a legitimate reason for refusing to
room with someone who is gay.
And gay community members
say incidents like this are not
uncommon at Stanford, despite
significant strides that have been
made on some gay, lesbian and
bisexual issues.

'On the policy level,
it's good. On the per
sonal level there's a
lot to be done.'
—Barney Cheng

"On the policy level, it's good.
On the personal level there's a lot
to be done," said junior Barney
Cheng, the Hammarsjkold House
resident whose roommate refused
to live with him.
Cheng recalled receiving an
obscene message on his answering
machine — targeted at his sexual

orientation — soon after his case
became publicly known on campus.
Although crank calls to openly
gay students do not occur fre
quently, Cheng said his is "not an
isolated case," and the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community
Center also receives such calls on
occasion.
Responses to the gay commu
nity's Needs Assessment Surveys
further evidenced the existence of
anti-gay sentiment — and its reli
gious undertones — on campus.
The surveys, distributed during
winter quarter, were aimed to
more accurately define and meet
the needs of gay, lesbian and bisex
ual students. But they elicited a
larger negative response than
some had anticipated, said LGBCC
coordinator Eleanor Feingold.
Some students wrote "Go to
Hell" on their surveys, she said.
And others stapled articles, clip
pings and sermons denouncing
homosexuality to their responses.
Irreconcilable differences?
Some students say their reli
gious views are irreconcilable with
homosexuality, and cite religious
texts to back up their arguments.
But other religious leaders and gay
individuals believe religious reasons
are just excuses to mask prejudice.
According to Diana Akiyama,
Assoc. Dean of Memorial Church,
no passage in the Christian Bible
explicitly denounces homosexuality.
"If you look for hard and fast
rules (in the original text, which is
Greek) it's pretty hard to prove"

that being gay is wrong, she said.
Translations of the Bible with
phrases explicitly condemning
homosexuality "have been ques
tioned by Biblical scholars,"
Akiyama added.

But Dorman Followwill, pastor
of college students at Peninsula
Bible Church, said, "Biblically
speaking, homosexuality as a
lifestyle is not what God intended."
"To go against the way we were

designed doesn't make a lot of
sense," Followwill said, adding
that the Apostle Paul said homo
sexuality was "against nature."
Despite this conflict, gay, les
bian and bisexual individuals are
still "loved greatly by God," Fol
lowwill said.
This perspective, which many
gay individuals find objectionable,
doesn't surprise sophomore Say
deah Howard, who identifies her
self as a bisexual. "Coming from a
religious background, this is old
news to me," Howard said, adding
that her father is a Southern Bap
tist minister.
"For me, being gay is not a
question of morality. It's natural.
It's normal," Howard said.
But many religions continue to
view homosexuality as unnatural,
and it is only in recent years that
some gay Christians and Jews
have gained acceptance within
their sects, religious leaders say.
For instance, Jewish texts
openly outlaw gay men, and"the
Torah's treatment of male homo
sexuality as a capital offense has
remained enforced until this gen
eration," according to Rabbi Ari
Cartun of Stanford's B'nai B'rith
Hillel Foundation.
However, there is a "great deal
of sympathy" for homosexuals in
Judaism's Reform, Reconstruc
tionist and Conservative move
ments today.
More people are beginning to
view "homosexuality as an orien
tation rather than a perverted
choice of action," he said,

although heterosexuality is still
considered "more optimal" if one
has a choice.

'It's sexual orienta
tion. It's the way
we're born.'
—Cliff Chan

Choice vs. identity
And the issue of choice is one
that arises frequently in the dia
logue between the gay community
and the church.
Yesterday's speaker said she
believed people have a choice
between gay and heterosexual
lifestyles. But some in the gay
community refuted this theory,
saying their sexual orientation
is an integral part of their iden
tity.
Cliff Chan is a Stanford gradu
ate who was involved with Chris
tian groups as an undergraduate
and didn't come out until seven
years after college. "It's really
damaging because a lot of the peo
ple that come with this kind of
message indicate that gay people
can change," Chan said.
"A lot of people want to believe
that. But I think it's pretty
crazy," he said. "It's sexual orien
tation. It's the way we're born.
It's dangerous if people come to
this and think 'If I try hard
enough I can change.'

'Former lesbian' Darlene Bogle claims homosexuality is a lifestyle
that is chosen by some, and one which she chose to give up with the
help of God. Gay-rights advocates protested her speech last night
at Kresge Auditorium.
For the past few days, several Christian groups have been com
peting with gay-rights advocates for campus attention, posting
fliers that parody each other and even distributing fliers door-to
door in efforts to gain wider audiences.
The controversial speaker being publicized raised the ire of the
gay community last night by espousing the idea that homosexual
ity is a choice — one that people can control with the help of God.
This position, as well as the methods of promotion for the
event — which some found offensive — disturbed many gay stu
dents and motivated them to organize the celebratory pro-gay
gathering outside Kresge Auditorium last night.
