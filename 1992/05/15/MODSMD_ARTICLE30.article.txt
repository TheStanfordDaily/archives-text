# Track at Modesto in Pac-10 warmup
## 
### Nick Clements Staff write 
Selected members of the Stan
ford track and field team will be
tuning up for the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships this
weekend at the Modesto Relays.
Mike Powell, world record holder
in the long jump, will make his
outdoor seasonal debut in a meet
that Stanford head coach Brooks
Johnson called, "one of the fix
tures on the outdoor supercir
cuit."
Most of the core of the men's
and women's throwing teams will
be at Modesto, hoping to qualify
for the NCAA Championships.
Pat Stowell and Matt Karsevar in
the discus, and Toby Norwood in
the hammer throw, are all look
ing for provisional qualifying
throws. Dave Popejoy, who has
already automatically qualified
for NCAAs in the hammer throw,
needs to improve his personal
best by about two feet to qualify
for the Olympic Trials. His best
throw this season is 208 feet,
three inches.
"It'll be a glorified picnic with
huge men throwing esoteric
medal objects," said men's
throwing coach Jed Goldfried,
who called the Modesto throwing
competitions among "the
strongest in the world." To give
an example of how difficult the
competition is, Pam Dukes, a for
mer Stanford star who competed
in the World Championships last
year, failed to make it to the
finals in last year's discus compe
tition.
The competition will be equal
ly difficult next weekend at Pac
10s, held in Eugene, Ore. Stowell
and Karsevar, in particular, will
have their hands full in the dis
cus. Five athletes have already
qualified for NCAA Champi
onships in their event and three
others have qualified provisional
ly-
Two Cardinal athletes who
definitely will not be at Modesto
are Chryste Gaines and Jackie
Edwards. Gaines, who ran the
second fastest 100-meter dash in
the world this year at the Texas
Relays this past weekend, will

rest in order to prepare for at
least three events next weekend
— the 100-meter dash, the 200-
meter dash, and the 4XIOO
- relay. Edwards, who had
one of the best long jump series
of her life in Texas, will compete
in the long and triple jumps, in
addition to the 4XIOO-meter
relay and probably the 100-meter
dash.
"This is what you call a Mur
phy's law meet, which means if
anything can go wrong, it'll prob
ably go wrong the week before
Pac-lOs," said Stanford middle
distance coach Scott Chisam, cit
ing possible injury as the team's
main reason for resting Gaines
and Edwards. "[Chryste] just
went out and ran the best Ameri
can time this year. She doesn't
have to prove anything to any
body."
Right now, Gaines is head and
shoulders above any other colle
giate sprinter. Although her
10.90 second time in the 100-
meters was wind-aided, it wasn't
wind-aided by much. The maxi
mum back wind allowed by the
NCAA is two meters per second,
and Gaines ran with a back wind
of 2.5 meters per second. With
almost a month to train before
the NCAA Championships in
Austin, Texas, Gaines should
have a shot at the NCAA record
of 10.78 seconds, set by LSU's
Dawn Sowell in 1989.
Other Stanford athletes who
will be at Modesto are Christy
Boyd in the intermediate hur
dles, Kathy Unruh and Travis
Clark in the high jump, Florence
Adu and Anne Lee in the triple
jump, Susan Helfter in the 800-
meters, and Melissa Freeberg in
the 1500-meters.
In other developments, John
son surprised everyone this week
when he announced that he will
be resigning as Stanford's head
track coach this year and is
applying as head coach at Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo. He said
that he will give Stanford Athlet
ic Director Ted Leland a chance
to respond when he officially
resigns today or tomorrow and
will then comment on his reasons
for leaving next week.

ably go wrong the week before
Pac-lOs," said Stanford middle
distance coach Scott Chisam, cit
ing possible injury as the team's
main reason for resting Gaines
and Edwards. "[Chryste] just
went out and ran the best Ameri
can time this year. She doesn't
have to prove anything to any
body."
Right now, Gaines is head and
shoulders above any other colle
giate sprinter. Although her
10.90 second time in the 100-
meters was wind-aided, it wasn't
wind-aided by much. The maxi
mum back wind allowed by the
NCAA is two meters per second,
and Gaines ran with a back wind
of 2.5 meters per second. With
almost a month to train before
the NCAA Championships in
Austin, Texas, Gaines should
have a shot at the NCAA record
of 10.78 seconds, set by LSU's
Dawn Sowell in 1989.
Other Stanford athletes who
will be at Modesto are Christy
Boyd in the intermediate hur
dles, Kathy Unruh and Travis
Clark in the high jump, Florence
Adu and Anne Lee in the triple
jump, Susan Helfter in the 800-
meters, and Melissa Freeberg in
the 1500-meters.
In other developments, John
son surprised everyone this week
when he announced that he will
be resigning as Stanford's head
track coach this year and is
applying as head coach at Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo. He said
that he will give Stanford Athlet
ic Director Ted Leland a chance
to respond when he officially
resigns today or tomorrow and
will then comment on his reasons
for leaving next week.
