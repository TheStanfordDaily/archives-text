# Card nine wrap up regular season
## 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
With their place in the NCAA Region
al Tournament secure, Stanford Baseball
enters this weekend's series against
Santa Clara with clearly defined goals.
The team is looking to nurse its wounds
and preserve its seven-game winning
streak in the process.
Head coach Mark Marquess stressed
the importance of the series for keeping
the club confident, but his focus lies on
next week's regional tournament. Mon
day, the Cardinal will receive the news on 1
which regional they will attend.
"Playing Santa Clara is better than
not playing," he said. "Our main goal is
to stay tuned. We want to play as well as
we can and win, but we won't go over
board."
The three games this weekend could
determine whether or not Stanford goes
into its regional seeded first. Although
these are non-conference games, adding
two or three wins to a 35-20 record could
make a difference.
Stanford will be playing its first
regional game either next Thursday or
Friday. In order to be ready, Marquess
plans to handle the lineup delicately this

weekend against the Broncos.
The starting pitchers will be Willie
Adams Friday, Brian Sackinsky Satur
day, and Jamie Sepeda Sunday. Although
the starting rotation is set, don't look for
any complete games out of the staff this
weekend.
"We want to stay sharp as a team
without overdoing it," Marquess said.
"I'm going to consciously limit the num
ber of pitches they throw and rest any
bumped and bruised players."
In particular, star centerfielder Jeffrey
Hammonds will get the chance to rest his
aching body. Hammonds has been play
ing with nagging injuries all season and
coach Marquess wants him ready for the
regionals.
"I'd say he's doubtful," remarked
Marquess on Hammonds' chances for
playing. "He'll probably play only one
game at the most. The rest will do him
good."
Even without Hammonds, Stanford
should be able to win the series. The
Broncos have struggled this season to a
losing record, dropping a 10-2 decision to
the Cardinal in their only previous con
frontation.
Look for senior outfielder David Cor
nell to light up the opposing pitching.

Cornell transferred to Stanford from
Santa Clara and knows all three of this
weekend's starters.
"They've got strong hitting, but their
pitching is a pretty big question mark,"
Cornell said. "We've just got to keep play
ing well. We should get two wins and
three would be sweet, but we could shoot
ourselves in the foot if we don't play
sharp."
Righthanders Ryan Brust, Bob
Pailthorpe, and Miles Kelly are scheduled
to start for Santa Clara and will find
themselves throwing to a myriad of hot
bats. Steve Solomon has hit .423 over the
last 17 games and is second only to Ham
monds with a .356 average.
The infield of first baseman Dusty
Allen, third baseman Tony Detter, and
shortstop Todd Laßocca have all been
hitting well, especially against California
last weekend. In particular, Allen has hit
five home runs in his last seven games
and looks to continue pounding the ball
today.
The games today (2:30 p.m.) and Sun
day (1 p.m.) will be at Buck Shaw Stadi
um at Santa Clara, with the Saturday
game to be played at Sunken Diamond at
1 p.m. All three games will be aired on
KZSU.
