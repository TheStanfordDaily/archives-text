Prof. William Northway will
lead the Faculty Senate next
year, but he said his main goal
is simply to take it in whatever
direction members want to go.
"I only hope to carry on the
good work of my predecessor,"
History Prof. James Sheehan,
the newly elected senate chair
said. "I mainly see my role as
listening to the faculty, keep
ing the discussion moving and
making sure the senate can
talk about what it wants."
Northway's election was
announced during yesterday's
senate meeting, along with the
four other members of next
year's steering committee â€”
Political Science Profs. Terry
Karl and Stephen Krasner,
History Prof. David Kennedy
and English and Linguistics
Prof. Elizabeth Traugott.
"It will be an exciting year
because we will have a new
president and, eventually, a
new provost," Northway said.
This year's senate has pri
marily focused on the Universi
ty's $43 million deficit-reduc
tion effort, which Northway
said is "something everybody is
hoping to move away from."
The senate was forced to
hold several special meetings

devoted solely to budget issues
during the year.
Another important item for
next year's senate will be "catch
ing up" on business postponed
this year so members could con
centrate on the budget, he said.
"We will need to review the
interdisciplinary programs
that were supposed to be
reviewed this year, as well as
the ones scheduled for next
year," North way said.
The 55-member senate,
which was created in 1968 to
represent the Academic Council,
sets University policy on cur
riculum, academic programs,
admissions and research.
