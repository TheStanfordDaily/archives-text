House Post Office investigation widens
WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal grand jury investigating the
House Post Office is demanding office expense records of the
Ways and Means Committee chairman, two other lawmakers and
the former sergeant-at-arms.
Subpoenas made public yesterday provided the first indication
that the grand jury wants to scrutinize records of House mem
bers. Until now, indictments and convictions focused on embez
zlement and drug sales involving House Post Office employees.
The grand jury sought six years of vouchers for goods and ser
vices submitted by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.; Reps. Austin J.
Murphy and Joseph Kolter, both D-Pa., and former Sergeant-at-
Arms Jack Russ. »
The subpoenas, which covered the six years ending April 15,
also sought information on stamp allotments for House members.
All told, the grand jury issued five subpoenas: one each to the
three members' offices; one to House Clerk Donnald K. Anderson
for records of the three lawmakers and Russ; and one to Sergeant
at-Arms Werner Brandt for records of his office. Brandt replaced
Russ in mid-March.
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said U.S. Attorney
Jay Stephens reduced the request during negotiations with
House lawyers, but he did not reveal the changes.
