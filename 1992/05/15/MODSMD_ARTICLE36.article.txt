'Major progress' in narcolepsy research
Stanford researchers have found that only one of the two genes
previously used to detect narcolepsy is an accurate marker in peo
ple of different races.
The finding should improve the diagnosis of narcolepsy, a
genetically determined sleep disorder, especially in minority
groups.
The finding is believed to be the first major progress towards
identifying the genetic cause of narcolepsy since 1983, when
researchers in Japan discovered a common gene among Japanese
narcoleptic patients.
The research was supported by grants from the National Insti
tutes of Health and by a gift from comedian Joe Piscopo.
New lecture series to debut
A new annual lecture series will begin June 2 with a speech on
the physics of running.
The Distinguished Lecture in Biomechanical Engineering was
initiated by Stanford's Biomechanical Engineering Program to rec
ognize outstanding contributions to biology and medicine by scien
tists and engineers who utilize mechanical engineering approaches.
Thomas McMahon, professor of biology at Harvard, will speak
on "A General Principle for the Physics of Running in Animals"
at 4:15 p.m. in Fairchild Auditorium.
