# Fac Sen votes changes to course drop policy

### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Students can now drop classes until
minutes before their final exam and
replace poor grades when they retake a
class, the Faculty Senate decided yester
day in approving several changes to aca
demic policies.
Under the revised course drop policy,
students will be able to drop classes using
the on-line student access system until
midnight of the last day of dead week.
During finals week, students can sub
mit a written request for a "no credit" to
their professor up to the time the exam
begins, which the professor must honor.
The current policy allows students to
drop classes only up until 24 hours prior
to the beginning of the final exam.
The other revision will allow students
to petition to replace a past grade with a
better one if they retake the class. Only
the most recent grade will appear on their
official transcript.
Students who currently retake a class
have both courses listed on their tran
script — the first time with the original
grade and number of units and the second
time with the most recent grade
and zero units.
"This is essentially the same as
the original policy," said Assoc. Edu
cation Prof. Edward Haertel, chair
of the committee that recommend
ed the change. "It gets us out of the
negotiated 'no credit' arrangement
and encourages faculty to assign
lower grades where warranted."
Although not permitted by cur
rent policy, many professors
honor students' requests for a
negotiated "no credit" instead of
an unsatisfactory grade.
English Prof. Nancy Packer
called the proposal to allow stu
dents to replace grades "very anti
democratic.
"It favors people who have lots
of time and lots of money" to stay
at Stanford and retake courses,
she said.
The change was also criticized
by several faculty as continuing a
lenient system that allows students
to drop classes if they have a poor
grade at the end of the quarter.
"I am struck by the spirit of this
change," said Civil Engineering
Prof. Raymond Levitt.
"It seems to me to send the
wrong signal — that students make
their decisions based upon the
grades they expect to get."
University President Donald
Kennedy, who described the
changes as a "technical revision" of
existing policy, suggested that the
senate consider reexamining the
entire drop deadline policy because
of the "significant number of reser
vations" expressed by faculty mem
bers about the current system.
The committee that proposed
the changes was originally charged
with reexamining the policy, and
some faculty appeared disappoint
ed that more substantial revisions
including setting the deadline
several weeks earlier in the quar
ter — were not recommended.
In other business, the senate
approved two resolutions on tuition
remission, one calling for the feder
al government to maintain the poli
cy and the other asking the Univer

sity to strive to maintain graduate
education if the system is ended.
Tuition remission is the policy
of government reimbursement to
the university through the staff
benefits pool for the tuition of
graduate students involved in
sponsored research.
In the wake of the indirect-cost
controversy, the Office of Man
agement and Budget is studying
the system and considering abol

ishing it in favor of supporting
graduate student tuition through
direct grants.
But because direct grants are
unlikely to fund the same number
of graduate students as the system
of tuition remission, Education and
Sociology Prof. Elizabeth Cohen
warned that "Stanford's ability to
conduct research could really be
threatened in the near future."
