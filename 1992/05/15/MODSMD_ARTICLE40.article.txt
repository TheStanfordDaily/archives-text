# COMMENCEMENT COUNTDOWN 1992
## Taking the tour sitting down A 						guide's-eye view of what vistors hear about the Farm 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
Hello and welcome to Stanford.
I'm your tour guide, and I'll be
leading you on a no-stress, no
effort tour of the campus. I have
only one request to make: I walk
backwards through most of the
tour, and while I've gotten good at
avoiding large, non-moving
things like buildings, I have trou
ble with small children, bicycles,
animals, vehicles and the like.
Please help me out by warning me
when I'm about to hurt myself.
We'll begin our tour at the
front of the Quad, at Memorial
Court. Directly behind you is
Palm Drive, the main entrance to
the University. It's lined with 150
palm trees, which incidentally
aren't indigenous to the region
and must be imported.
As we move through Memorial
Court toward the center of the
Main Quad, it might be good to
give you a quick refresher on
Stanford history.
Jane and Leland Stanford
founded the University in 1885 in
memory of their only son, Leland
Stanford Jr., who died of typhoid
fever one month before his 16th
birthday. Contrary to popular
myth, the Stanfords never offered

the president of Harvard or Yale a
suitcase full of money in exchange
for a building in little Leland's
name.
They built their school on the
site of their 8,200-acre Palo Alto
Stock Farm, where they had
raised championship trotters, a

type of race horse. In their found
ing grant, the Stanfords decreed
that no Stanford land could ever
be sold, and indeed, much of "The
Farm" still remains open land.
We'll stop for a minute in the
center of the Quad. Surrounding
you are the 12 original buildings
of the Inner Quad, the part of the
University that existed when the
school opened in 1891. The 16
Outer Quad buildings and Memo
rial Church were added by 1903.
Today, these buildings house

many of the departments of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences. Most of the technical divi
sions, like physics, engineering
and biology, moved west of the
Quad as their need for larger
research facilities grew.
Memorial Church, directly in
front of you, was built by Jane
Stanford in memory of her hus
band, who died in 1893, only two
years after the University opened.
The church originally had an 80-
foot spire atop it, housing a large
clock and four bells. During the
1906 San Francisco earthquake,
the spire crashed down into the
center of the church, blowing out
the front wall and destroying
most of the building. Miraculous
ly (pun intended), the bells and
clock survived the fall, much like
a Timex. They now stand at the
southwest corner of the Quad and
continue to chime today.
You've probably noticed the
extensive renovation work being
done on the church right now.
Unfortunately, when the church
was rebuilt, the original central
support system was left intact.

stone of the church's main arch

es, slipped an inch out of place.
The crane you see is being used
to remove the roof of the church so
repair work can be done. A Univer
sity engineer described it to me as
having a $25 part break in your car,
but in a way that requires the whole
vehicle to be taken apart to get to it.
The renovation is scheduled to be
completed next fall.
Let's skirt our way around the
fences surrounding the church and
head for the cornerstone, located at

the corner of Building 60. The Stan
fords insisted on laying this first
stone of the University on May 14,
1887, which would have been their
son's 19th birthday.
You're probably wondering what
all these numbered plaques are at
your feet; this is the one question
that just about every tour group
asks. These plaques actually begin
in front of the church, and each one
Ls dedicated by the senior class the
day before Commencement. The
class of 1896 started the tradition,
but '92 through '95 didn't want to
be lefl out, so they placed theirs
retroactively. The plaques will con
tinue around the Inner Quad until

they once again reach the front of
the church in 2403, 512 plaques
later. University President Donald
Kennedy personally counted the
spaces when he was provost in 1980.
Each plaque covers a time cap
sule containing memorabilia chosen
by the senior class. The contents
include things like Stanford IDs,
newspapers, record albums and
even cans of soda, commemorating
the change in the formula of Coca-
Cola.
At this point, the guide attempts
to find a way out of the south side of
the Quad while avoiding fences and
construction equipment. Needless to
say, the 1989 earthquake hit the

University hard. The tour emerges
at the southwest corner of the Quad.
Remember the clock and bells I
told you about earlier from the
Memorial Church spire? Well, this
clock tower contains those original
parts, which until 1967 had been in
a wooden tower behind the church.
We'll head for White Plaza now,
where much of the social activity on
campus takes place. Notice all the
tables set up by various student
groups promoting plays and con
certs, political causes, clubs, sports
and countless other activities.
Sometimes rock bands play in White
Plaza or up on the Tresidder Union
patio, which you can see to your

right.
Behind me is Braun Music Cen
ter, constructed in 1982 to house
the Department of Music. Behind
you to the left is Old Union, former
ly the student union, but now the
student services center. It's the
place we go to stand in line all day at
the beginning of every quarter. But
with Axess, the computerized sys
tem, we don't have to do that any
more. Old Union was built with
funds provided by former U.S. Pres
ident Herbert Hoover, a Stanford
alumnus (Geology, '95).
As we exit White Plaza, back the
same way we came, you'll notice
White Memorial Fountain on your
left. Actually, I didn't even know it
was named that until I became a
tour guide, since everybody (and I
do mean everybody) here calls it
"The Claw." The Claw, like all of
Stanford's fountains, is turned off
to conserve water, but when it's on,
it's a great site for fountain-hop
ping. The Claw is the ultimate foun
tain for hopping, since it sprays in
all directions and it's very easy to
climb.
Every year during Big Game
Week a stuffed bear (usually of the
teddy variety) is impaled upon the
top spike of The Claw by the drum
major of the Stanford Band. The
"Bearial," held on a Monday in late
November, is the kickoff event of
the spirit activities leading up to Big
Game.
On your right is the Stanford
Bookstore, a newly renovated facili
ty that claims to be one of the
largest college bookstores in the
nation. The main level contains
nothing but books, books and more
books. This doesn't even include the
textbooks section in the basement.
A computer store, a cafe, a photo
lab, school and office supplies, plus
everything that's ever had the Stan
ford name stamped on it can also be
found in the Bookstore.
The tour group thoughtfully
points out the kiosk the guide is
about to run into. Despite the fact

this kiosk has always been there, the
guide inevitably heads straight for it
every time.
Curving between the Bookstore
and the Career Planning and Place
ment Center (which used to be the
Bookstore), we head for the front of
Meyer library, one of Stanford's
numerous libraries. Stanford hold
ings include over 5.7 million vol
umes housed in 40 special libraries.
Most libraries contain specialized
holdings — physics, art, law etc. —
but Meyer and Green (the library
over there to the left), are two gen
eral reference libraries. Green is the
largest, with over 1.6 million vol
umes, while Meyer serves as the
instructional and media services
library, computer cluster and an
audio-visual center as well as other
library resources. Next year Meyer
will lose its books, and serve as an
extension to Green Library.
Right next to us is Rodin's "The
Thinker," part of Stanford's Rodin
Collection, the second largest in the
world. While most of the Rodins are
in the B. Gerald Cantor Rodin
Sculpture Garden, next to the Art
Museum, The Thinker was placed
in front of Meyer for, I suppose,
inspirational purposes.
After curving around Green, we
conclude our tour at the foot of
Hoover Tower, one of the buildings
of the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace, a major
research center for social, political
and economic change in the 20th
century. The Tower is primarily a
library, separate from the Universi
ty's holdings. Standing 285 feet tall,
the Tower features an observation
platform that provides an aerial
view of the campus and a substan
tial portion of the Bay Area.
Finally, to your right is Memori
al Hall, a large auditorium built in
1936 with student funds to honor
students and faculty who died in
World War I. The lobby is inscribed
with their names, as well as the

names of those who died in World
War 11, the Korean War and the
Vietnam War.
Mem Aud, as it is commonly
called, features a 200-seat Little
Theater for major Drama Depart
ment productions and a large 1,700-

seat auditorium used for lectures,
religious services, special perform
ing arts events and the weekly Sun
day Flicks, a tradition that involves
movies, paper fights and shouting
at the screen.
If there are no more questions, I'd
like to conclude the tour and wish
you a pleasant stay at Stanford. I'm
walking back to our starting point to
get my bike, so if you're completely
lost, feel free to follow me.

leading you on a no-stress, no
effort tour of the campus. I have
only one request to make: I walk
backwards through most of the
tour, and while I've gotten good at
avoiding large, non-moving
things like buildings, I have trou
ble with small children, bicycles,
animals, vehicles and the like.
Please help me out by warning me
when I'm about to hurt myself.
We'll begin our tour at the
front of the Quad, at Memorial
Court. Directly behind you is
Palm Drive, the main entrance to
the University. It's lined with 150
palm trees, which incidentally
aren't indigenous to the region
and must be imported.
As we move through Memorial
Court toward the center of the
Main Quad, it might be good to
give you a quick refresher on
Stanford history.
Jane and Leland Stanford
founded the University in 1885 in
memory of their only son, Leland
Stanford Jr., who died of typhoid
fever one month before his 16th
birthday. Contrary to popular
myth, the Stanfords never offered

the president of Harvard or Yale a
suitcase full of money in exchange
for a building in little Leland's
name.
They built their school on the
site of their 8,200-acre Palo Alto
Stock Farm, where they had
raised championship trotters, a

type of race horse. In their found
ing grant, the Stanfords decreed
that no Stanford land could ever
be sold, and indeed, much of "The
Farm" still remains open land.
We'll stop for a minute in the
center of the Quad. Surrounding
you are the 12 original buildings
of the Inner Quad, the part of the
University that existed when the
school opened in 1891. The 16
Outer Quad buildings and Memo
rial Church were added by 1903.
Today, these buildings house

many of the departments of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences. Most of the technical divi
sions, like physics, engineering
and biology, moved west of the
Quad as their need for larger
research facilities grew.
Memorial Church, directly in
front of you, was built by Jane
Stanford in memory of her hus
band, who died in 1893, only two
years after the University opened.
The church originally had an 80-
foot spire atop it, housing a large
clock and four bells. During the
1906 San Francisco earthquake,
the spire crashed down into the
center of the church, blowing out
the front wall and destroying
most of the building. Miraculous
ly (pun intended), the bells and
clock survived the fall, much like
a Timex. They now stand at the
southwest corner of the Quad and
continue to chime today.
You've probably noticed the
extensive renovation work being
done on the church right now.
Unfortunately, when the church
was rebuilt, the original central
support system was left intact.

stone of the church's main arch

es, slipped an inch out of place.
The crane you see is being used
to remove the roof of the church so
repair work can be done. A Univer
sity engineer described it to me as
having a $25 part break in your car,
but in a way that requires the whole
vehicle to be taken apart to get to it.
The renovation is scheduled to be
completed next fall.
Let's skirt our way around the
fences surrounding the church and
head for the cornerstone, located at

the corner of Building 60. The Stan
fords insisted on laying this first
stone of the University on May 14,
1887, which would have been their
son's 19th birthday.
You're probably wondering what
all these numbered plaques are at
your feet; this is the one question
that just about every tour group
asks. These plaques actually begin
in front of the church, and each one
Ls dedicated by the senior class the
day before Commencement. The
class of 1896 started the tradition,
but '92 through '95 didn't want to
be lefl out, so they placed theirs
retroactively. The plaques will con
tinue around the Inner Quad until

they once again reach the front of
the church in 2403, 512 plaques
later. University President Donald
Kennedy personally counted the
spaces when he was provost in 1980.
Each plaque covers a time cap
sule containing memorabilia chosen
by the senior class. The contents
include things like Stanford IDs,
newspapers, record albums and
even cans of soda, commemorating
the change in the formula of Coca-
Cola.
At this point, the guide attempts
to find a way out of the south side of
the Quad while avoiding fences and
construction equipment. Needless to
say, the 1989 earthquake hit the

University hard. The tour emerges
at the southwest corner of the Quad.
Remember the clock and bells I
told you about earlier from the
Memorial Church spire? Well, this
clock tower contains those original
parts, which until 1967 had been in
a wooden tower behind the church.
We'll head for White Plaza now,
where much of the social activity on
campus takes place. Notice all the
tables set up by various student
groups promoting plays and con
certs, political causes, clubs, sports
and countless other activities.
Sometimes rock bands play in White
Plaza or up on the Tresidder Union
patio, which you can see to your

right.
Behind me is Braun Music Cen
ter, constructed in 1982 to house
the Department of Music. Behind
you to the left is Old Union, former
ly the student union, but now the
student services center. It's the
place we go to stand in line all day at
the beginning of every quarter. But
with Axess, the computerized sys
tem, we don't have to do that any
more. Old Union was built with
funds provided by former U.S. Pres
ident Herbert Hoover, a Stanford
alumnus (Geology, '95).
As we exit White Plaza, back the
same way we came, you'll notice
White Memorial Fountain on your
left. Actually, I didn't even know it
was named that until I became a
tour guide, since everybody (and I
do mean everybody) here calls it
"The Claw." The Claw, like all of
Stanford's fountains, is turned off
to conserve water, but when it's on,
it's a great site for fountain-hop
ping. The Claw is the ultimate foun
tain for hopping, since it sprays in
all directions and it's very easy to
climb.
Every year during Big Game
Week a stuffed bear (usually of the
teddy variety) is impaled upon the
top spike of The Claw by the drum
major of the Stanford Band. The
"Bearial," held on a Monday in late
November, is the kickoff event of
the spirit activities leading up to Big
Game.
On your right is the Stanford
Bookstore, a newly renovated facili
ty that claims to be one of the
largest college bookstores in the
nation. The main level contains
nothing but books, books and more
books. This doesn't even include the
textbooks section in the basement.
A computer store, a cafe, a photo
lab, school and office supplies, plus
everything that's ever had the Stan
ford name stamped on it can also be
found in the Bookstore.
The tour group thoughtfully
points out the kiosk the guide is
about to run into. Despite the fact

this kiosk has always been there, the
guide inevitably heads straight for it
every time.
Curving between the Bookstore
and the Career Planning and Place
ment Center (which used to be the
Bookstore), we head for the front of
Meyer library, one of Stanford's
numerous libraries. Stanford hold
ings include over 5.7 million vol
umes housed in 40 special libraries.
Most libraries contain specialized
holdings — physics, art, law etc. —
but Meyer and Green (the library
over there to the left), are two gen
eral reference libraries. Green is the
largest, with over 1.6 million vol
umes, while Meyer serves as the
instructional and media services
library, computer cluster and an
audio-visual center as well as other
library resources. Next year Meyer
will lose its books, and serve as an
extension to Green Library.
Right next to us is Rodin's "The
Thinker," part of Stanford's Rodin
Collection, the second largest in the
world. While most of the Rodins are
in the B. Gerald Cantor Rodin
Sculpture Garden, next to the Art
Museum, The Thinker was placed
in front of Meyer for, I suppose,
inspirational purposes.
After curving around Green, we
conclude our tour at the foot of
Hoover Tower, one of the buildings
of the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace, a major
research center for social, political
and economic change in the 20th
century. The Tower is primarily a
library, separate from the Universi
ty's holdings. Standing 285 feet tall,
the Tower features an observation
platform that provides an aerial
view of the campus and a substan
tial portion of the Bay Area.
Finally, to your right is Memori
al Hall, a large auditorium built in
1936 with student funds to honor
students and faculty who died in
World War I. The lobby is inscribed
with their names, as well as the

names of those who died in World
War 11, the Korean War and the
Vietnam War.
Mem Aud, as it is commonly
called, features a 200-seat Little
Theater for major Drama Depart
ment productions and a large 1,700-

seat auditorium used for lectures,
religious services, special perform
ing arts events and the weekly Sun
day Flicks, a tradition that involves
movies, paper fights and shouting
at the screen.
If there are no more questions, I'd
like to conclude the tour and wish
you a pleasant stay at Stanford. I'm
walking back to our starting point to
get my bike, so if you're completely
lost, feel free to follow me.

avoiding large, non-moving
things like buildings, I have trou
ble with small children, bicycles,
animals, vehicles and the like.
Please help me out by warning me
when I'm about to hurt myself.
We'll begin our tour at the
front of the Quad, at Memorial
Court. Directly behind you is
Palm Drive, the main entrance to
the University. It's lined with 150
palm trees, which incidentally
aren't indigenous to the region
and must be imported.
As we move through Memorial
Court toward the center of the
Main Quad, it might be good to
give you a quick refresher on
Stanford history.
Jane and Leland Stanford
founded the University in 1885 in
memory of their only son, Leland
Stanford Jr., who died of typhoid
fever one month before his 16th
birthday. Contrary to popular
myth, the Stanfords never offered

the president of Harvard or Yale a
suitcase full of money in exchange
for a building in little Leland's
name.
They built their school on the
site of their 8,200-acre Palo Alto
Stock Farm, where they had
raised championship trotters, a

type of race horse. In their found
ing grant, the Stanfords decreed
that no Stanford land could ever
be sold, and indeed, much of "The
Farm" still remains open land.
We'll stop for a minute in the
center of the Quad. Surrounding
you are the 12 original buildings
of the Inner Quad, the part of the
University that existed when the
school opened in 1891. The 16
Outer Quad buildings and Memo
rial Church were added by 1903.
Today, these buildings house

many of the departments of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences. Most of the technical divi
sions, like physics, engineering
and biology, moved west of the
Quad as their need for larger
research facilities grew.
Memorial Church, directly in
front of you, was built by Jane
Stanford in memory of her hus
band, who died in 1893, only two
years after the University opened.
The church originally had an 80-
foot spire atop it, housing a large
clock and four bells. During the
1906 San Francisco earthquake,
the spire crashed down into the
center of the church, blowing out
the front wall and destroying
most of the building. Miraculous
ly (pun intended), the bells and
clock survived the fall, much like
a Timex. They now stand at the
southwest corner of the Quad and
continue to chime today.
You've probably noticed the
extensive renovation work being
done on the church right now.
Unfortunately, when the church
was rebuilt, the original central
support system was left intact.

stone of the church's main arch

es, slipped an inch out of place.
The crane you see is being used
to remove the roof of the church so
repair work can be done. A Univer
sity engineer described it to me as
having a $25 part break in your car,
but in a way that requires the whole
vehicle to be taken apart to get to it.
The renovation is scheduled to be
completed next fall.
Let's skirt our way around the
fences surrounding the church and
head for the cornerstone, located at

the corner of Building 60. The Stan
fords insisted on laying this first
stone of the University on May 14,
1887, which would have been their
son's 19th birthday.
You're probably wondering what
all these numbered plaques are at
your feet; this is the one question
that just about every tour group
asks. These plaques actually begin
in front of the church, and each one
Ls dedicated by the senior class the
day before Commencement. The
class of 1896 started the tradition,
but '92 through '95 didn't want to
be lefl out, so they placed theirs
retroactively. The plaques will con
tinue around the Inner Quad until

they once again reach the front of
the church in 2403, 512 plaques
later. University President Donald
Kennedy personally counted the
spaces when he was provost in 1980.
Each plaque covers a time cap
sule containing memorabilia chosen
by the senior class. The contents
include things like Stanford IDs,
newspapers, record albums and
even cans of soda, commemorating
the change in the formula of Coca-
Cola.
At this point, the guide attempts
to find a way out of the south side of
the Quad while avoiding fences and
construction equipment. Needless to
say, the 1989 earthquake hit the

University hard. The tour emerges
at the southwest corner of the Quad.
Remember the clock and bells I
told you about earlier from the
Memorial Church spire? Well, this
clock tower contains those original
parts, which until 1967 had been in
a wooden tower behind the church.
We'll head for White Plaza now,
where much of the social activity on
campus takes place. Notice all the
tables set up by various student
groups promoting plays and con
certs, political causes, clubs, sports
and countless other activities.
Sometimes rock bands play in White
Plaza or up on the Tresidder Union
patio, which you can see to your

right.
Behind me is Braun Music Cen
ter, constructed in 1982 to house
the Department of Music. Behind
you to the left is Old Union, former
ly the student union, but now the
student services center. It's the
place we go to stand in line all day at
the beginning of every quarter. But
with Axess, the computerized sys
tem, we don't have to do that any
more. Old Union was built with
funds provided by former U.S. Pres
ident Herbert Hoover, a Stanford
alumnus (Geology, '95).
As we exit White Plaza, back the
same way we came, you'll notice
White Memorial Fountain on your
left. Actually, I didn't even know it
was named that until I became a
tour guide, since everybody (and I
do mean everybody) here calls it
"The Claw." The Claw, like all of
Stanford's fountains, is turned off
to conserve water, but when it's on,
it's a great site for fountain-hop
ping. The Claw is the ultimate foun
tain for hopping, since it sprays in
all directions and it's very easy to
climb.
Every year during Big Game
Week a stuffed bear (usually of the
teddy variety) is impaled upon the
top spike of The Claw by the drum
major of the Stanford Band. The
"Bearial," held on a Monday in late
November, is the kickoff event of
the spirit activities leading up to Big
Game.
On your right is the Stanford
Bookstore, a newly renovated facili
ty that claims to be one of the
largest college bookstores in the
nation. The main level contains
nothing but books, books and more
books. This doesn't even include the
textbooks section in the basement.
A computer store, a cafe, a photo
lab, school and office supplies, plus
everything that's ever had the Stan
ford name stamped on it can also be
found in the Bookstore.
The tour group thoughtfully
points out the kiosk the guide is
about to run into. Despite the fact

this kiosk has always been there, the
guide inevitably heads straight for it
every time.
Curving between the Bookstore
and the Career Planning and Place
ment Center (which used to be the
Bookstore), we head for the front of
Meyer library, one of Stanford's
numerous libraries. Stanford hold
ings include over 5.7 million vol
umes housed in 40 special libraries.
Most libraries contain specialized
holdings — physics, art, law etc. —
but Meyer and Green (the library
over there to the left), are two gen
eral reference libraries. Green is the
largest, with over 1.6 million vol
umes, while Meyer serves as the
instructional and media services
library, computer cluster and an
audio-visual center as well as other
library resources. Next year Meyer
will lose its books, and serve as an
extension to Green Library.
Right next to us is Rodin's "The
Thinker," part of Stanford's Rodin
Collection, the second largest in the
world. While most of the Rodins are
in the B. Gerald Cantor Rodin
Sculpture Garden, next to the Art
Museum, The Thinker was placed
in front of Meyer for, I suppose,
inspirational purposes.
After curving around Green, we
conclude our tour at the foot of
Hoover Tower, one of the buildings
of the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace, a major
research center for social, political
and economic change in the 20th
century. The Tower is primarily a
library, separate from the Universi
ty's holdings. Standing 285 feet tall,
the Tower features an observation
platform that provides an aerial
view of the campus and a substan
tial portion of the Bay Area.
Finally, to your right is Memori
al Hall, a large auditorium built in
1936 with student funds to honor
students and faculty who died in
World War I. The lobby is inscribed
with their names, as well as the

names of those who died in World
War 11, the Korean War and the
Vietnam War.
Mem Aud, as it is commonly
called, features a 200-seat Little
Theater for major Drama Depart
ment productions and a large 1,700-

seat auditorium used for lectures,
religious services, special perform
ing arts events and the weekly Sun
day Flicks, a tradition that involves
movies, paper fights and shouting
at the screen.
If there are no more questions, I'd
like to conclude the tour and wish
you a pleasant stay at Stanford. I'm
walking back to our starting point to
get my bike, so if you're completely
lost, feel free to follow me.
Hello and welcome to Stanford.
I'm your tour guide, and I'll be
leading you on a no-stress, no
effort tour of the campus. I have
only one request to make: I walk
backwards through most of the
tour, and while I've gotten good at
avoiding large, non-moving
things like buildings, I have trou

animals, vehicles and the like.
