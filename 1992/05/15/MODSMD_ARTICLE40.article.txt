## Taking the tour sitting down A

### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
Hello and welcome to Stanford.
I'm your tour guide, and I'll be
leading you on a no-stress, no
effort tour of the campus. I have
only one request to make: I walk
backwards through most of the
tour, and while I've gotten good at
avoiding large, non-moving
things like buildings, I have trou
ble with small children, bicycles,
animals, vehicles and the like.
Please help me out by warning me
when I'm about to hurt myself.
We'll begin our tour at the
front of the Quad, at Memorial
Court. Directly behind you is
Palm Drive, the main entrance to
the University. It's lined with 150
palm trees, which incidentally
aren't indigenous to the region
and must be imported.
As we move through Memorial
Court toward the center of the
Main Quad, it might be good to
give you a quick refresher on
Stanford history.
Jane and Leland Stanford
founded the University in 1885 in
memory of their only son, Leland
Stanford Jr., who died of typhoid
fever one month before his 16th
birthday. Contrary to popular
myth, the Stanfords never offered

the president of Harvard or Yale a
suitcase full of money in exchange
for a building in little Leland's
name.
They built their school on the
site of their 8,200-acre Palo Alto
Stock Farm, where they had
raised championship trotters, a

type of race horse. In their found
ing grant, the Stanfords decreed
that no Stanford land could ever
be sold, and indeed, much of "The
Farm" still remains open land.
We'll stop for a minute in the
center of the Quad. Surrounding
you are the 12 original buildings
of the Inner Quad, the part of the
University that existed when the
school opened in 1891. The 16
Outer Quad buildings and Memo
rial Church were added by 1903.
Today, these buildings house

many of the departments of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences. Most of the technical divi
sions, like physics, engineering
and biology, moved west of the
Quad as their need for larger
research facilities grew.
Memorial Church, directly in
front of you, was built by Jane
Stanford in memory of her hus
band, who died in 1893, only two
years after the University opened.
The church originally had an 80-
foot spire atop it, housing a large
clock and four bells. During the
1906 San Francisco earthquake,
the spire crashed down into the
center of the church, blowing out
the front wall and destroying
most of the building. Miraculous
ly (pun intended), the bells and
clock survived the fall, much like
a Timex. They now stand at the
southwest corner of the Quad and
continue to chime today.
You've probably noticed the
extensive renovation work being
done on the church right now.
Unfortunately, when the church
was rebuilt, the original central
support system was left intact.
