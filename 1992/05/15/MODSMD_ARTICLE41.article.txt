# Running from the thesis bear
## 'Helen' has a week to write her 50-page tour de force 
### Kristen Schmid Staff writer 
"Helen" is willing to talk, but only anonymously,
about her unwritten honors thesis due in a week.
She seems more scared of her adviser discovering
her procrastination than she is of not finishing at all.
Helen had a nasty surprise a few days ago. She
found out that a 30-50 page draft of her paper is due
next week instead of by graduation, as had been the
assumption that set her pace. She now plans to tack
le the immense project with "late nights — trying
not to think about the whole thing I'll just get it
done and worry about the details later."
Her task seemed even more insurmountable

when she confidently told an asso
ciate that she had already complet
ed the entire experiment. "I just
have to do the write-up," she told
him. But, he replied, "the write-up
is the hardest part."
And then there's her friend who
is already done. "There's a little bit
of pressure there — I see her revis
ing stuff I haven't even started to
write yet."
Helen plans to combat the stress
of next week by "eating a lot, run
ning, talking to my mom, whining,
probably getting mad at my
friends."
Most likely she will be able to
finish. Procrastination is "a typical

pattern — I pull a lot of all-nighters," she says,
adding that she has been known to write a research
paper in two nights.
Since she has already been admitted to graduate
school, Helen says "it's hard to get motivated." She
also doesn't need the thesis to graduate.
Her mom has a laid-back attitude about her
dilemma, Helen says, but her dad is "more stressed
— he can't stand to hear about it so he has to get off
the phone."
"I don't usually get stressed," Helen said. "Other peo
ple are more stressed than I am"
Still, if she doesn't finish, Helen notes, she "wouldn't
have honors, and people wouldn't be thrilled— There'd
be a blank spot in the presentation schedule."
