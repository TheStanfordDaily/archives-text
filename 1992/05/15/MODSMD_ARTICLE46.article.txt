# Graduating in Roble Gym, and other stories
## 
### 
The history of the University's Commence
ment exercises may serve no real purpose
other than being great material for a Stanford
trivia bowl. But what's the difference? Go
ahead — read on and bone up on the Universi
ty's Commencement history...
Where were most Commencements held prior
to 1938? Clue: Its small size became a problem
as enrollment grew.
Memorial Church. From 1938 until 1983
Stanford held Commencement in Frost
Amphitheater; in 1984, the ceremony was
held at Sunken Diamond and in 1985 it moved
to Stanford Stadium.

Did professors and students
always wear robes at Com
mencement?

Where was the first Commencement held?
Roble Gym. According to Fred Glover,
Class of '33 and former executive assistant to
the University president, evergreens and flow
ers decorated what was then a temporary
frame building.
Who was the speaker in 1935, when Com
mencement was held in the Stadium? Clue:
He was a member of the first class that gradu
ated from Stanford, and his wife — also a
Stanford grad — was named Lou Henry.
While a student here, this speaker forgot to
bring the football to the first Big Game.
Former U.S. President Herbert Hoover.
Former Prof. Harold Bacon, Class of '28,
Commencement marshal from 1934-72 and
50-year resident of the white house with the

roses at the corner of Mayfield and Campus
Drive, estimated that more than 15,000
attended the Hoover speech in the 90,000
capacity arena. "A lot left," after Hoover gave
his speech, Bacon said.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was
always a chronic shortage of Commencement
tickets. Why was the University so reluctant to
hold Commencement exercises in the Stadium?
University officials maintained that the
Stadium's atmosphere was wrong for Com
mencement. "It was too big a place," Bacon
said. Frost Amphitheater, on the other hand,
was loved by faculty and students alike; Bacon
called it the "ideal place."
In 1984, however, officials decided to try
Sunken Diamond as a Commencement site.
When that was deemed too small as well, some
faculty and students considered the Oval.
Eventually, though, Stanford Stadium got the
nod because of its virtually unlimited capacity.
By the way, the Graduate School of Busi
ness holds its ceremony in Frost.
How difficult was it to obtain Commencement
tickets before the move to the Stadium ?
Very difficult, according to Bacon. Thou
sands of tickets were denied each year.
Has commencement ever been rained out?
Amazingly, it never has.
Have students always received their diplomas
at department ceremonies?
No. Up until about 12 years ago — during
Richard Lyman's presidency — the University
president awarded the diplomas in the large
ceremony. But the ceremony grew too long.
Acoording to Eric Hutchinson, a chemistry
professor here for 36 years, the ceremony
became cumbersome. "We all fried in Frost
Amphitheater," he said.
Did professors and students always wear robes

at Commencement?
No. According to Gover, the entire class did
not wear caps and gowns until 1906. Students
apparently considered the custom "medieval."
In 1899 a female student started the cap and
gown movement, ordering herself and other
women caps and gowns.
Where was Commencement held 1906-14
when the earthquake damaged Memorial
Church ?
Birge Clark, Class of '14, said his Com
mencement was held in the Auditorium (also
called the Assembly Hall) which currently
houses the Communication Department.
Clark added that in 1906 the University

postponed Commencement until Sept. 15
because of the earthquake.
Has a live band always provided the music for
the ceremony'?
No. Prior to 1906, organ music was used.
Before the late '40s, organ music was piped
into the Amphitheater from Memorial
Church. Then after Music Prof. Herber Nan
ney came here as University organist in 1947,
he played a rented electric organ in the
Amphitheater.
How did The Daily treat Commencement ?

ated from Stanford, and his wife — also a
Stanford grad — was named Lou Henry.
While a student here, this speaker forgot to
bring the football to the first Big Game.
Former U.S. President Herbert Hoover.
Former Prof. Harold Bacon, Class of '28,
Commencement marshal from 1934-72 and
50-year resident of the white house with the

roses at the corner of Mayfield and Campus
Drive, estimated that more than 15,000
attended the Hoover speech in the 90,000
capacity arena. "A lot left," after Hoover gave
his speech, Bacon said.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was
always a chronic shortage of Commencement
tickets. Why was the University so reluctant to
hold Commencement exercises in the Stadium?
University officials maintained that the
Stadium's atmosphere was wrong for Com
mencement. "It was too big a place," Bacon
said. Frost Amphitheater, on the other hand,
was loved by faculty and students alike; Bacon
called it the "ideal place."
In 1984, however, officials decided to try
Sunken Diamond as a Commencement site.
When that was deemed too small as well, some
faculty and students considered the Oval.
Eventually, though, Stanford Stadium got the
nod because of its virtually unlimited capacity.
By the way, the Graduate School of Busi
ness holds its ceremony in Frost.
How difficult was it to obtain Commencement
tickets before the move to the Stadium ?
Very difficult, according to Bacon. Thou
sands of tickets were denied each year.
Has commencement ever been rained out?
Amazingly, it never has.
Have students always received their diplomas
at department ceremonies?
No. Up until about 12 years ago — during
Richard Lyman's presidency — the University
president awarded the diplomas in the large
ceremony. But the ceremony grew too long.
Acoording to Eric Hutchinson, a chemistry
professor here for 36 years, the ceremony
became cumbersome. "We all fried in Frost
Amphitheater," he said.
Did professors and students always wear robes

at Commencement?
No. According to Gover, the entire class did
not wear caps and gowns until 1906. Students
apparently considered the custom "medieval."
In 1899 a female student started the cap and
gown movement, ordering herself and other
women caps and gowns.
Where was Commencement held 1906-14
when the earthquake damaged Memorial
Church ?
Birge Clark, Class of '14, said his Com
mencement was held in the Auditorium (also
called the Assembly Hall) which currently
houses the Communication Department.
Clark added that in 1906 the University

postponed Commencement until Sept. 15
because of the earthquake.
Has a live band always provided the music for
the ceremony'?
No. Prior to 1906, organ music was used.
Before the late '40s, organ music was piped
into the Amphitheater from Memorial
Church. Then after Music Prof. Herber Nan
ney came here as University organist in 1947,
he played a rented electric organ in the
Amphitheater.
How did The Daily treat Commencement ?
Well, in 1941 — back when a year's tuition
