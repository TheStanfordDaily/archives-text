Stanford held Commencement early this year
when President David Starr Jordan cancelled the
remainder of school on account of the Earthquake of
1906.
Jordan told professors to grant students credit
"as though the year's
work was com

pleted." He
also called

immediate "special exami
nations" for students of
"doubtful standing," and added
that "no one should be reported as passed unless the
instructor is certain that such report is deserved."
Jordan said that "Students entitled to degrees on
the basis of the reports received will be granted their
diplomas in due season."
This event marked not only the earliest Com
mencement at Stanford, but the shortest Commence

ment address ever given
by a University president. 1
Which leads us to a dilem
ma worthy of a Book of
Questions: Would you
rather endure a
devastating 8.2
earthquake or a long speech
in the hot sun? Hmmm ...
you might have to think
about that one for a
while.

In his Commencement address, University Presi
dent Ray Wilbur told the graduates, "The University
has given you a diploma, not so much as a certificate
of work done as an admission ticket to new opportu
nities and to new possibilities. After one has entered,
the ticket of admission is of but little value."
Little value? Easy for him to say, back when the
"ticket" didn't cost about $100,000.
Come to think of it, if a diploma is a ticket, do you
think there are diploma scalpers? Imagine their
sales pitch: "Hey! I got bachelors from Stanford. I
got masters from UC-Berkeley. 1 still got one doctor
ate from Yale left, but it's gonna go fast. Who needs
'em?"

The Daily announced the
University will sponsor a free
showing of the movie "Sierra
Nevada" for graduating seniors,

their families and
their friends the
night before Com

, mencement. According to
The Daily, "The Travelogue,
accompanied by background
music and spoken commen
tary, describes spectacular
k scenes in California's high
mountain regions."
Sounds like a party! What

did they plan for after graduation, a sem
inar on tax shelters ? Or maybe a lecture on the latest
census results? Too much excitement for me. ...

The Daily announced that Clark Kerr, chancellor
designate of UC-Berkeley, would give the main
address at the University's Commencement ceremo
ny-
A weenie giving the Commencement address? Nice.
Did they have the UC-Berkeley coach give a half time
speech to the Stanford team during Big Game, too?

After a stray champaign cork almost hit Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy in the face during his
introduction of Commencement speaker Mario
Cuomo, Cuomo joked, "If you want to shoot those
things, take your best shot now and then we'll get on
with it."Cuomo also joked that hot tubs and pina
coladas are two of California's main contributions to
the nation.
Great. Try defending these cracks to your 96-year
old Republican grandfather who's paid for your
entire education and said he wanted to come to Com
mencement "to see what kind of place I sent you to."
On the other hand, Grandpa always could appreci
ate a good pina colada.
