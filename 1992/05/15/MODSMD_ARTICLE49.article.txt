# Student guides show off their campus
## Walking backwards is all in a day's work 
### Kris McNeil 
Tour guides are everywhere on
campus, doing everything from
showing foreign businessmen
Hoover Tower to providing curi
ous prospective freshman their
first glimpse of the University.
In a day's work, these students
walk backwards, point and do
what they seem to love most
about the job — talk about their
school. "I've always been really
proud of Stanford and I love to
talk about it," tour guide senior
John Louie said.
Tour guides are "a very diverse
group, which really reflects well
upon the University," said Louie.
"I've met a lot of great people
through doing this. It's a very
close-knit group."
Though guides have an inten
sive training, they don't always
know everything visitors want to
know.
"You can really only teach peo
ple so many facts," said Joe Piga
to, program coordinator of Guide
and Visitor Service for the '92-'93
school year. "We just want them
to be frank. Don't try to search for
an answer when you don't have
yy
one.
"People really can't expect you
to know everything, but some
times they do, and you need to be
able to deal with that when it hap
pens," he added.
Every tour guide has his or her
own horror stories of individuals
or groups who asked impossibly
trivial or specific questions.
"One group asked me how
many red tiles there were in the
Quad, and another time a man
wouldn't stop asking really specif
ic details of the library's computer
system," said junior Amy Rees,
who has been guiding tours since
April of last year. "Most of the
time you can divert them,
though."
The rigorous program neces

sary to become a tour guide does
not include a class in learning
how to walk backwards. "I did
practice up and down the [Toyon]
halls," Ching said.
"I have had my share of run
ins," Louie added.
Tour guides begin each tour by
asking the visitors if there are any
specific things they would like to
see. "People really want to see dif
ferent parts of the University,"
said Louie. "It's a different tour
each time."
Deciding which facts to inte
grate into a tour is also a personal
stylistic decision. "I just try to
make it interesting," said fresh
man Tristan Ching, who started
guiding tours this quarter.
"No one really cares that there
are 7,000 windows in this build
ing, or that this other building
was built in 1902," she said. "Peo
ple, especially pro fros, are inter
ested in Stanford life, and that's
what they want to hear about."
"I definitely focus more on pro

gram-oriented kinds of things,"
Rees said. "I don't think it does
much good to tell them the stu
dent-faculty ratio if you don't tell
them what classes are like — that
for one class you might have lec
tures three times a week and a
section once a week, and so on."
"I don't tell them how many
books there are in the library or
how many post office boxes there
are," she added.
Ching said her job keeps her in
touch with the outside world. "I
think [students] have a tendency
to get isolated," she said. "When
you always have people coming in
[to the campus] from the outside
it really puts things into perspec
tive."
Ching said she likes conducting
tours with pro fros the best
because "they remind you why
you wanted to come to Stanford in
the first place." Rees agreed. "I
definitely like giving pro fro tours
the most," she said.
Tour guides often join other

guides' tour groups and give fel
low guides a hard time.
"A lot of times other tour
guides will join the tour and make
faces at you, and it's funny
because you have to pretend like
you don't know them," Rees said.
Louie recalled an incident
where one guide walked up to a
fellow guide while he was giving a
tour and whispered, "You were
great last night" loud enough for
everyone to hear.
Most of the guides seem to
agree that the relationships
between people in the group keep
them interested in their job.
"When I was a tour guide that
was definitely one of the things I
liked best," Geil said. "All the peo
ple were so involved and excited
about the school, and were really
amazing."
"That's not an uncommon
experience at Stanford — to be
amazed with people — but they
