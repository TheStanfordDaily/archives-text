# Revisions to judicial charter made; C-15 takes its 'swan song'
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate passed "dilut
ed" revisions to the legislative and
judicial charter yesterday afternoon,
abandoning the controversial attempt
by the Committee of 15 to reduce the
burden of proof.
The amendments slightly alter
the rights of students charged with
misconduct as well as witnesses and
people who initiate complaints.
The most significant change gives
additional rights to victims, includ
ing allowing them to be accompanied
by a person of their choice through
out the judicial process.
"We determined that this is the
best we would be able to do at this
time," said Law Prof. Deborah
Rhode, chair of the Committee of
15. "It is up to the president to
appoint another committee if he
would want to look at this again.
"For the purpose of this com
mittee, this is our swan song,"
she added.
Last fall, the committee pro
posed reducing the burden of proof
in student misconduct cases from
"beyond a reasonable doubt" to
"clear and convincing evidence."
But before the faculty had a
chance to vote on the proposed
amendments, the ASSU Senate
rejected the change to the burden
of proof and only approved minor
alterations to the charter.

'This is our swan
song.'

"The changes to the burden of
proof have been withdrawn in the
wake of student concerns,"
Rhode said.
She told the senate that every
one in her committee approved
the new amendments, except one
member who felt the changes
were now "diluted too much" to
be acceptable.
Senate Chair James Sheehan
called the proposal "much simpli
fied and leaner" when he intro
duced Rhode, and there was little
substantive debate.
Although the ASSU Senate has
already approved the substance of
the amendments, Council of Pres
idents member Beth Morgan said
in an interview that the ASSU
will have to reconsider them
because there have been some
"specific changes to the wording."
"But it will be a pure formality
to have it passed through the
ASSU Senate again," Morgan said.
The amendments also require
the formal approval of University
President Donald Kennedy, who
has said he favors the changes.
