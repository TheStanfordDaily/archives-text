As a former copywriter for a msyor advertising
agency, I cannot possibly overemphasize the
importance of advertising in our society.
What am I saying? Of course I can overemphasize
the importance of advertising in our society. How
about: "Without advertising, every person on Earth

would grow antlers and speak
broken Portuguese."
Ahem. Excuse me if I seem
just a wee bit sarcastic, but
that's how you'd feel if you had
just spent a year of your life
working in an industry whose
major contribution to modern
philosophical thought is
"Where's the Beef?"
To recap: Two years ago I
was a normal, well-adjusted
Stanford senior. Four easy

years of studying linguistics,
the major equivalent of diet soda ("The Degree of a
Lazy Generation"), had left me tanned, relaxed and
ready to get started in a rewarding career.
Unfortunately, I stumbled into advertising, a pro
fession many young writers fall into, lured by the
promise of easy opportunities to write commercials
starring famous ex-human Michael Jackson.
Being in Alaska, however, my agency had none of
the glamorous accounts you associate with advertis
ing. No Budweiser. No Bo Knows. No Calvin Klein's

Obsession For Men Who Have Accents You Would
Normally Associate With A Klingon.
Nope, what we have in Alaska are oil companies,
and their one singular purpose is to convince the
public that they care very, very deeply about the
Earth, notwithstanding the fact that they regularly
drill holes in it, spill oil on it, etc.
Exxon, for instance, has launched a major new

campaign to let the public
know that the Prince
William Sound oil spill
was actually good for the
environment. Years after
the spill, says Exxon, you
can actually see twice as
many salmon as before the
spill, ignoring the fact that
the only reason you're
seeing them is that
they're floating on the
surface.

But as an adver
tising copywriter you're not expected to question
whether the companies you're advertising actually
live up to their claims. No, you simply sit at your
computer, cranking our headline and slogans such
as "Exxon: Greasing Alaska."
Yet strangely, copywriters are highly revered in
the advertising industry. Revered to the point that I
would often get into conservations like:
