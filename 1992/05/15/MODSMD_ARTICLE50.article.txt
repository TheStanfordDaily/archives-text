### ANCHORAGE, ALASKA 
As a former copywriter for a msyor advertising
agency, I cannot possibly overemphasize the
importance of advertising in our society.
What am I saying? Of course I can overemphasize
the importance of advertising in our society. How
about: "Without advertising, every person on Earth

would grow antlers and speak
broken Portuguese."
Ahem. Excuse me if I seem
just a wee bit sarcastic, but
that's how you'd feel if you had
just spent a year of your life
working in an industry whose
major contribution to modern
philosophical thought is
"Where's the Beef?"
To recap: Two years ago I
was a normal, well-adjusted
Stanford senior. Four easy

years of studying linguistics,
the major equivalent of diet soda ("The Degree of a
Lazy Generation"), had left me tanned, relaxed and
ready to get started in a rewarding career.
Unfortunately, I stumbled into advertising, a pro
fession many young writers fall into, lured by the
promise of easy opportunities to write commercials
starring famous ex-human Michael Jackson.
Being in Alaska, however, my agency had none of
the glamorous accounts you associate with advertis
ing. No Budweiser. No Bo Knows. No Calvin Klein's

Obsession For Men Who Have Accents You Would
Normally Associate With A Klingon.
Nope, what we have in Alaska are oil companies,
and their one singular purpose is to convince the
public that they care very, very deeply about the
Earth, notwithstanding the fact that they regularly
drill holes in it, spill oil on it, etc.
Exxon, for instance, has launched a major new

campaign to let the public
know that the Prince
William Sound oil spill
was actually good for the
environment. Years after
the spill, says Exxon, you
can actually see twice as
many salmon as before the
spill, ignoring the fact that
the only reason you're
seeing them is that
they're floating on the
surface.

But as an adver
tising copywriter you're not expected to question
whether the companies you're advertising actually
live up to their claims. No, you simply sit at your
computer, cranking our headline and slogans such
as "Exxon: Greasing Alaska."
Yet strangely, copywriters are highly revered in
the advertising industry. Revered to the point that I
would often get into conservations like:


ANDREW BERKOWITZ

CLIENT: "We need a phrase to
explain our product is new and
improved."
ME: "How about 'New and
improved'?"
CLIENT: "You're brilliant!"
And it went on like this, month
after month, until the arrival of the
world-famous Oscar Mayer
Wienermobile changed my life for
ever. The Wienermobile is a 23-
foot-long hot dog on wheels. A con
verted Ford van, it travels from
state to state publicizing Oscar
Mayer Wieners.
As you might well imagine, the
Wienermobile is the most phallic
object powered by internal com
bustion. Long, skinny and pink,
the Wienermobile could easily be
mistaken in somebody's rear-view
mirror as a giant recreational
penis.
Naturally, when General Foods
came to the agency looking for
Wienermobile publicity, it was I, as
a wiener specialist, who was put in
charge of creating advertising for
its arrival.
So after much thought and
research I devised a brilliant televi
sion commercial that showed film
of the Wienermobile and ended
with the enlightening tag: "It's
Coming!" Simple. To the point.
Oscar Mayer, to put it phallical
ly, went bananas.
We were informed that under
no circumstances could we assert
that the Wienermobile was "Com
ing." It could be "On its way." It
could be "Arriving soon." It could
be "Just around the corner." But

never, ever "Coming!"
Now I ask you: If you were to
see a 23-foot-long, pink wiener,
along with the phrase Its com
ing!" would you have anything but
innocent, G-rated thoughts?
We changed the commercial.
Not a week later, General Foods
sent us a promotional packet filled
with stickers, postcards and other
assorted Wienermobile collectibles.
Of particular interest were the
Wienermobile postcards, because
where in this great nation of ours
did they choose to photograph the
Wienermobile? Why, right in front
of the Washington Monument,
that's where. In front of THE
MOST PHALLIC OBJECT IN
THE FREE WORLD.
A month later I quit my job.
What are the lessons to be
learned here? There are many:
•Without oil companies there
would be no oil, and with no oil it
would be well-nigh impossible to
make a decent Caesar salad;
•There's more to a career than
money and glory. There's also sex
and power, if you can get 'em;
•If you ever see the Wienermo
bile, yell "Sperm alert!" as loud as
you can and then run off snicker
ing; and
•Most of your real education
will take place out in the world, not
in the classroom. In fact, just yes
terday a fellow member of the
Stanford Class of 1990 called me
from work to tell me about his
career, although it was hard to
hear him above the sound of all
those burgers frying.

•Most of your real education
will take place out in the world, not

terday a fellow member of the
Stanford Class of 1990 called me
from work to tell me about his
career, although it was hard to
hear him above the sound of all
those burgers frying.

Former Daily columnist Andrew
Berkowitz graduated in 1990
with a bachelor's in linguistics.
As a former copywriter for a msyor advertising
agency, I cannot possibly overemphasize the
importance of advertising in our society.
What am I saying? Of course I can overemphasize
the importance of advertising in our society. How
about: "Without advertising, every person on Earth

would grow antlers and speak
broken Portuguese."
Ahem. Excuse me if I seem
just a wee bit sarcastic, but
that's how you'd feel if you had
just spent a year of your life
working in an industry whose
major contribution to modern
philosophical thought is
"Where's the Beef?"
To recap: Two years ago I
was a normal, well-adjusted
Stanford senior. Four easy

years of studying linguistics,
the major equivalent of diet soda ("The Degree of a
Lazy Generation"), had left me tanned, relaxed and
ready to get started in a rewarding career.
Unfortunately, I stumbled into advertising, a pro
fession many young writers fall into, lured by the
promise of easy opportunities to write commercials
starring famous ex-human Michael Jackson.
Being in Alaska, however, my agency had none of
the glamorous accounts you associate with advertis
ing. No Budweiser. No Bo Knows. No Calvin Klein's

Obsession For Men Who Have Accents You Would
Normally Associate With A Klingon.
Nope, what we have in Alaska are oil companies,
and their one singular purpose is to convince the
public that they care very, very deeply about the
Earth, notwithstanding the fact that they regularly
drill holes in it, spill oil on it, etc.
Exxon, for instance, has launched a major new

campaign to let the public
know that the Prince
William Sound oil spill
was actually good for the
environment. Years after
the spill, says Exxon, you
can actually see twice as
many salmon as before the
spill, ignoring the fact that
the only reason you're
seeing them is that
they're floating on the
surface.

But as an adver
tising copywriter you're not expected to question
whether the companies you're advertising actually
live up to their claims. No, you simply sit at your
computer, cranking our headline and slogans such
as "Exxon: Greasing Alaska."
Yet strangely, copywriters are highly revered in
the advertising industry. Revered to the point that I
would often get into conservations like:


ANDREW BERKOWITZ

CLIENT: "We need a phrase to
explain our product is new and
improved."
ME: "How about 'New and
improved'?"
CLIENT: "You're brilliant!"
And it went on like this, month
after month, until the arrival of the
world-famous Oscar Mayer
Wienermobile changed my life for
ever. The Wienermobile is a 23-
foot-long hot dog on wheels. A con
verted Ford van, it travels from
state to state publicizing Oscar
Mayer Wieners.
As you might well imagine, the
Wienermobile is the most phallic
object powered by internal com
bustion. Long, skinny and pink,
the Wienermobile could easily be
mistaken in somebody's rear-view
mirror as a giant recreational
penis.
Naturally, when General Foods
came to the agency looking for
Wienermobile publicity, it was I, as
a wiener specialist, who was put in
charge of creating advertising for
its arrival.
So after much thought and
research I devised a brilliant televi
sion commercial that showed film
of the Wienermobile and ended
with the enlightening tag: "It's
Coming!" Simple. To the point.
Oscar Mayer, to put it phallical
ly, went bananas.
We were informed that under
no circumstances could we assert
that the Wienermobile was "Com
ing." It could be "On its way." It
could be "Arriving soon." It could
be "Just around the corner." But

never, ever "Coming!"
Now I ask you: If you were to
see a 23-foot-long, pink wiener,
along with the phrase Its com
ing!" would you have anything but
innocent, G-rated thoughts?
We changed the commercial.
Not a week later, General Foods
sent us a promotional packet filled
with stickers, postcards and other
assorted Wienermobile collectibles.
Of particular interest were the
Wienermobile postcards, because
where in this great nation of ours
did they choose to photograph the
Wienermobile? Why, right in front
of the Washington Monument,
that's where. In front of THE
MOST PHALLIC OBJECT IN
THE FREE WORLD.
A month later I quit my job.
What are the lessons to be
learned here? There are many:
•Without oil companies there
would be no oil, and with no oil it
would be well-nigh impossible to
make a decent Caesar salad;
•There's more to a career than
money and glory. There's also sex
and power, if you can get 'em;
•If you ever see the Wienermo
bile, yell "Sperm alert!" as loud as
you can and then run off snicker
ing; and
•Most of your real education
will take place out in the world, not
in the classroom. In fact, just yes
