# Job-seeking Stanford graduates face the fourth 'R' — recession
## 
### Lydia Lee Staff writer 
After two years of a gloomy economic
climate, people are starting to use the R
word. Recession looms over the heads of
those leaving the shelter of Stanford for
the open air of the free market.
Two independent studies done at
Michigan and Northwestern Universities
reveal that this year's prospects are the
worst in the last two decades, according
to an article in The New York Times.
But Ruth Schneider, director of the
Career Planning and Placement Center
on campus, stressed that Stanford grads
are in demand. "It is a very competitive
job market, but organizations are still
coming to Stanford," she said.
Students have interviewed for posi
tions in everything from software devel
opment to retail marketing. Some typical
job titles include financial analyst,
research assistant, and account execu
tive. Schneider said organizations in
advertising and communications
including journalism— do not normally
recruit, but that the CPPC has binders

with listings of such jobs.
Schneider also mentioned that the ref
erence file service, part of the CPPC, has
sent out 2,000 more files than last year.
She said that part of the increase may be

attributed to greater numbers of stu
dents applying to graduate school.
More graduating seniors are applying
to graduate school as a way of delaying
having to go into the work force, accord
ing to the article in The New York Times.
In response to the circumstances that
some imminent graduates find them

selves in, the CPPC is sponsoring "Job
Connection Day,"the first such event at
Stanford.
The event features many smaller com
panies than the ones that traditionally
recruit on campus. As of Wednesday, 46
organizations who have openings will
have representatives at the event, which
will take place on Monday, May 18.
"I have a sense that people are more
anxious, more willing to network and to
use more resources," said Anne Green
blatt, the public service career counselor
at the CPPC. "It's happening — people
are finding jobs ... it's a question of turn
ing over more stones."
Greenblatt added that smaller science
and engineering companies are doing
really well, as well as health care and
environmental organizations. She said
graduates should target these companies,
which sometimes offer more opportuni
ties.
"It's a challenge to ferret out the small
companies that don't recruit on campus,"
Greenblatt said, citing the Career Action
Center in Palo Alto as a good place to
look.

The CPPC was busiest, in January
and February when people were looking
for internships, said Lucky Gutierrez,
program assistant at the CPPC.
"People are still coming in to look for
internships, but most of the big ones are

gone," said Gutierrez
At the Haas Center for Public Service,
Sue Gray, the clearinghouse coordinator,
said she hasn't seen greater numbers of
seniors come to the center, since the cen
ter doesn't really deal with post-gradu
ates.

But Gray said the annual Public Ser
vice Center Career Faire held earlier this
year was attended by more seniors than
usual.
According to the New York Times
article, the Peace Corps reports receiving
800 telephone inquiries a day on average.
Before January, the average was 250
calls a day.
Gray said the seniors working through
the center have been asking for more
advice than they had before. "Parental
pressure, paying back loans, survival—all
those factors have always been there, but
now they're heightened due to the reces
sion."
"It's always been difficult to find a job
in the public sector," Gray said, "and now
it seems that difficulty is seeping into
other sectors."
"In a job search, people can always
think of reasons why they will fail—
they're too old, too young, they're over or
underqualified. The recession is just
another thing to add to the list," said
Greenblatt. "The challenge is to move
forward, to take risks."
