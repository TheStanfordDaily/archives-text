# Pauling treated for cancer
## But 2-time Nobel winner won't slow down 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
Linus Pauling, a two-time Nobel laure
ate and professor emeritus of chemistry,
said yesterday he has been diagnosed with
prostate cancer.
Since the disease was detected in
December, two months before his 91st
birthday, Pauling has undergone drug
treatments at the Stanford Medical Cen
ter. The treatments have "apparently . ..
been effective," he said.
Pauling said he has been taking flu
tamide, an "anti-hormonal agent" which
inhibits growth of the prostate gland and
suppresses prostate cancer.
The presence of the disease is indicated
by a prostate-specific antigen. According
to Pauling, a test three weeks ago indicat
ed that his antigen production level was
"down to zero."
"Most men develop [prostate cancerl at

age 70," he said, adding that the the large
quantities of vitamin C he has been taking
regularly for the last 26 years may have
delayed the disease's onset.
Pauling has long said vitamin C can
delay the "increased incidence of disease"
that comes with old age.
Following his own advice, Pauling said
he now takes 18,000 milligrams of "pure
crystalline vitamin C" in his orange juice
daily. The recommended daily require
ment is 300 milligrams.
While the diagnosis "has slowed me
down," Pauling said he has written sever
al papers in the last four months. The only
consequence of the disease has been a
backlog of correspondence, he added.
Pauling, who joined the Stanford facul
ty in 1969, no longer has an office on cam
pus and does not teach classes of his own.
But he still attends lectures at Stanford
