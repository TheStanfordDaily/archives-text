# World leaders: U.S. must cure domestic woes
## Would improve world economy 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
World leaders in politics and business, includ
ing three former heads of state, urged the United
States to solve its domestic problems and renew
its commitment to a world leadership role yester
day in the opening of a two-day conference at
Stanford.
" 'To get in shape,' I think, was the prevailing
metaphor," said Political Science Prof. David Hol
loway, one of several faculty members who attend
ed the conference.
It was organized by the Institute for Interna
tional Studies, an umbrella group formed in 1989
to forge links with international leaders and coor
dinate the efforts of Stanford organizations that
focus on international issues.
The leaders — including former Australian
prime minister Bob Hawke, former Costa Rican
president Oscar Arias and Lee Kuan Yew, senior
minister of Singapore — each made 5-10 minute
speeches during a noon luncheon at the Hoover
Institution. Former U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz hosted the event, and University President
Donald Kennedy made remarks later in the day.
Focusing on the topic "The World Economy,"
the leaders emphasized the United States' need to
reinvest in developing its own ailing economy, and
lead the world economy with renewed vigor.
"Sometimes we forget how important and central
the U.S. is to economies and societies around the
world," said History Prof Norman Naimark, who
attended the luncheon. It was closed to the press.
The leaders criticized the United States' huge
budget deficits and protectionist trade policies,
saying they lead to economic stagnation that ulti
mately harms the world economy, Holloway said.
Their argument was that "while the internation
al environment is important, the first step is keeping
your own house in order," said Economics Prof.
John Taylor, another faculty member who attended.
But most of the speakers, Naimark said, were
worried about rumblings of isolationism within
the United States. "Everyone was concerned about
the U.S. withdrawing its efforts, economic and
political, from other parts of the world," he said.
The leaders who attended the conference —
including prominent business figures Yotaro
Kobayashi, the chair of Fuji Xerox, and Dennis
Weatherstone, chair of banking giant J.P. Morgan
— are members of the institute's advisory council.
The institute's first conference at Stanford, in
January 1991, attracted several of the council's
more prominent members, includ
ing former U.S. president Gerald
ford and former West German
chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
And several of the council's
other prominent members —
such as Canadian prime minister
Brian Mulroney, New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley, Italian prime minis
ter Giulio Andreotti and former
Soviet foreign minister Eduard
Shevardnadze — did not attend in
either year.

Walter Falcon, the institute's
director, said "last-minute politi
cal issues" in the countries of
some council members, including
Korean president Roh Tae Woo,
prevented them from attending.
Schmidt, was kept away by health
problems, he added.
But Falcon said he was not dis
appointed by the caliber of the
two dozen leaders who assembled
for this year's conference, saying
they are "a truly powerful group,"
although "perhaps not as well
known politically as some of the
others who visited last year."
Following the luncheon yester
day, the conference continued with

two discussion sessions. The first,
called "Ethnicity, Nationality and
Statehood in the New Era," was
moderated by Holloway and Politi
cal Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice.
"We had an extraordinarily
interesting discussion about the
implications of the rise of ethnic
consciousness" in the world, Hol
loway said.
The discussion, he said, raised
questions "about whether or not
one could think that all ethnic
groups had the right to self-deter
mination," considering that there
are more than 5,000 ethnic
groups in the world and only
about 200 states. The difficult

question posed by the discussion,
Holloway said, was how to
"assure that people can achieve
their goals and aspirations with
out statehood."
The second discussion yester
day, "Science and International
Affairs," was moderated by Sid
ney Drell, deputy director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter. Drell left for Boston shortly
after and could not be reached for
comment.
According to Falcon, the dis
cussion focused on the role and
responsibilities of scientists, the
role of government in science and
nuclear proliferation.

The leaders criticized the United States' huge
budget deficits and protectionist trade policies,
saying they lead to economic stagnation that ulti
mately harms the world economy, Holloway said.
Their argument was that "while the internation
al environment is important, the first step is keeping
your own house in order," said Economics Prof.
John Taylor, another faculty member who attended.
But most of the speakers, Naimark said, were
worried about rumblings of isolationism within
the United States. "Everyone was concerned about
the U.S. withdrawing its efforts, economic and
political, from other parts of the world," he said.
The leaders who attended the conference —
including prominent business figures Yotaro
Kobayashi, the chair of Fuji Xerox, and Dennis
Weatherstone, chair of banking giant J.P. Morgan
— are members of the institute's advisory council.
The institute's first conference at Stanford, in
January 1991, attracted several of the council's
more prominent members, includ
ing former U.S. president Gerald
ford and former West German
chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
And several of the council's
other prominent members —
such as Canadian prime minister
Brian Mulroney, New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley, Italian prime minis
ter Giulio Andreotti and former
Soviet foreign minister Eduard
Shevardnadze — did not attend in
either year.

Walter Falcon, the institute's
director, said "last-minute politi
cal issues" in the countries of
some council members, including
Korean president Roh Tae Woo,
prevented them from attending.
Schmidt, was kept away by health
problems, he added.
But Falcon said he was not dis
appointed by the caliber of the
two dozen leaders who assembled
for this year's conference, saying
they are "a truly powerful group,"
although "perhaps not as well
known politically as some of the
others who visited last year."
Following the luncheon yester
day, the conference continued with

two discussion sessions. The first,
called "Ethnicity, Nationality and
Statehood in the New Era," was
moderated by Holloway and Politi
cal Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice.
"We had an extraordinarily
interesting discussion about the
implications of the rise of ethnic
consciousness" in the world, Hol
loway said.
The discussion, he said, raised
questions "about whether or not
one could think that all ethnic
groups had the right to self-deter
mination," considering that there
are more than 5,000 ethnic
groups in the world and only
about 200 states. The difficult

question posed by the discussion,
Holloway said, was how to
"assure that people can achieve
their goals and aspirations with
out statehood."
The second discussion yester
day, "Science and International
Affairs," was moderated by Sid
ney Drell, deputy director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter. Drell left for Boston shortly
after and could not be reached for
comment.
According to Falcon, the dis
cussion focused on the role and
responsibilities of scientists, the
role of government in science and
nuclear proliferation.
