The FCE collection contains both fiction and non-fiction titles on such diverse sub

these gifted peoples called themselves, tend

BOOKSTORE GAZETTE
BOOKSTORE EXPANDS SPANISH LANGUAGE
SECTION THROUGH NEW RELATIONSHIP
WITH FONDO DE CULTURA ECONOMICA!
In celebration of Cinco de Mayo and the expansion of its Spanish language collection,
the Stanford Bookstore held a week-long book fair to herald its new arrangement with pub
lisher Fondo de Cultura Economica.
One of Latin America's oldest and largest publishing houses, Fondo de Cultura
Economica (FCE) has a new San Diego-based office and warehouse that will allow the
Stanford Bookstore to get books from the publisher quickly and easily.
Approximately 300 FCE titles have been added to the Stanford Bookstore's Spanish
language section, bringing the store's total number of Spanish language titles to more than
1,500. The arrangement with FCE will also give the Bookstore access to an additional 4,000
titles in FCE's stock which can be special ordered and shipped directly from San Diego with
out international delays.
The FCE collection contains both fiction and non-fiction titles on such diverse sub
jects as Archeology, Economics, History, Science and Art.
The Stanford Bookstore looks forward to an excellent relationship with FCE in pro
viding the best selection of Spanish Language titles in the San Francisco Peninsula area.
