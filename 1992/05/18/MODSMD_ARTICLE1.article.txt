# Bookstore perks were 'inappropriate,' review finds
## 'Failure to observe ethical norms' cited; attorney general's investigation widens 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The directors and top managers of the
Stanford Bookstore have not acted fraud
ulently or dishonestly, but have made
serious ethical errors over the past sever
al years, according to a report commis
sioned by the store's board of directors.
The report follows three months of
work by two law firms and an accounting
firm retained by the Bookstore in the
wake of press disclosures about question
able compensation arrangements and
management practices at the store.
Among other things, the report says
the review found that:
• During the last seven years, the
Bookstore has provided Eldon Speed, its
general manager, with seven different
luxury automobiles. For the entire 1990
calendar year, Speed was assigned two
cars, a Cadillac Seville and a Porsche 911.

• Philip Chiaramonte, the store's
assistant manager, was assigned two
company cars that year as well: a Cadillac
Eldorado and a Porsche 911 Turbo, a
vehicle that the Bookstore was leasing for
$1,400 a month.
• The same year, the nonprofit Book
store began paying various contractors
for remodeling work on Chiaramonte's
San Jose home. The tab, which eventual
ly exceeded $200,000, was considered a
loan to Chiaramonte and was approved
by the store's board of directors — but
not until six months after the work had
begun, when the board was first
informed of the construction.
• About $60,000 in Bookstore invest
ment funds were incorrectly transferred
into an employee "investment club"
account managed by then-controller
Patrick McDonald. McDonald, who was
terminated because of his poor handling
of the Bookstore's investment portfolio,

did not correct the error when he discov
ered it.
A copy of the report was made available
Friday to the California Attorney Gener
al's Office, which is investigating the
Bookstore to determine whether the store
has complied with applicable state laws.
The attorney general's investigation
was prompted by a Daily story in early
February that disclosed that the Book
store had for several years been providing
its senior employees with a host of
perquisites unheard of elsewhere in the
industry. The perquisites included the
use of a central California vacation home,
a motor home, a small sailboat and sever

al luxury automobiles.
The vacation home and motor home
are owned by Speed and Chiaramonte,
and are leased back to the Bookstore
through a consulting firm operated by
the two managers.
The report calls the perquisites
"unreasonable" and "inappropriate" and
says the Bookstore's lease agreements
with Speed and Chiaramonte's consulting
firm represent a "failure to observe the
ethical norms of the nonprofit sector."
Responding to recommendations made
in the report, the Bookstore's board
announced Friday that the leases on the
vacation home and motor home would be
terminated and that the Bookstore's "com
pany car program" would be discontinued.
It remains unclear how the vacation
home arrangement will be "unwound,"
as called for in the report. Since 1986, the
Bookstore has paid $179,000 in rent to
Speed and Chiaramonte's consulting
firm for use of the home in Twain Harte,
Calif. The store has also spent more than
$69,000 on furnishings and improve
ments — including a hot tub and satellite
dish — and has paid an additional

$31,800 for property taxes, insurance,
utilities and cleaning.
The report concludes that the Book
store has paid far more to use the house
than it would have had it instead rented a
comparable home in the area from a third
party. One alternative suggested in the
report is for Speed and Chiaramonte's
consulting firm to refund the difference
between what the Bookstore has paid
them and the lease's fair-market value.
The report, which was overseen by an
audit committee working independently
of the store's directors, is highly critical of
the Bookstore's board. While the report
asserts that the board has "satisfied the
minimum acceptable standard of care
required of law," it calls the board's level
of oversight "inappropriate" for a busi
ness enterprise the size of the Bookstore.
The report recommends a major
restructuring of the board and the elec
tion of a new president. Accordingly, the
board last week voted to create three new
committees that will work to write new
bylaws for the corporation, undertake a

thorough examination of the
store's compensation practices
and develop new standards for the
store's investments.
State review continues
The store's reforms appear to
be, at least in part, an attempt to
anticipate any corrective actions
the attorney general's office
would try to impose on the Book
store. It remains unclear whether
the store's reforms will be consid
ered sufficient.
The attorney general's review
had been scheduled to conclude
shortly, but its scope was recently
widened, according to Deputy
Attorney General Jim Schwartz,
and the investigation will likely
take another two months.
"We've expanded what we're
going to do," Schwartz said.
"There are more issues that have
been raised." He would not say
what additional areas his office
was investigating.
The Bookstore's board intends
to retain Speed and Chiaramonte
in their current positions, accord
ing to Law Prof. Robert Weisberg,
a Bookstore director who has
served as the board's spokesper
son for the last several months.
According to Weisberg, the
audit committee that prepared
the report believes that, once the
Bookstore's internal controls are
strengthened, "the benefits of
retaining Speed and Chiaramonte
will . . . outweigh the concerns
about poor judgment" that are
documented in the report.
The audit committee's report,
while very critical of many of the
managers' actions, also includes a
great deal of praise for their
accomplishments at the store.
Managers praised
The report lauds the "excep
tional skill and commitment" of
Speed and Chiaramonte, and
credits the two for turning the
Bookstore into a "remarkable
enterprise" during their tenures.
The report concludes that the
overall levels of compensation
paid to Speed and Chiaramonte
have been "reasonable," but says
several forms of the compensation
were "inappropriate." In 1991,
Speed reported $126,213 in tax
able income; Chiaramonte report
ed $102,077.
In a prepared statement, Speed
and Chiaramonte said the scruti
ny they have received in recent
months has been "excruciatingly
painful," but said they believe a
"more mature" Bookstore will
emerge from the controversy.
What follows are summaries of
several problem areas identified
in the report:
Employee loans
The Bookstore has provided
both Speed and Chiaramonte with
substantial loans for remodeling
their homes in the past decade.
The loans, the report says, do not
appear to have been illegal but do
raise serious ethical problems.
In October 1990, the Bookstore
began paying several contractors

for work and materials in connec
tion with the remodeling of
Chiaramonte's home in San Jose.
By April 1991, when the board of
directors was first informed of the
construction, more than $200,000
in Bookstore funds had been
spent on the remodeling.
After learning of the arrange
ment at its April meeting, the
board approved a $225,000 loan
from the Bookstore to Chiara
monte. A promissory note was
finally signed by Chiaramonte in
June 1991, almost eight months
after the Bookstore had begun
paying for the remodeling work.
The report cites evidence that
loan documents had been pre
pared by Chiaramonte for presen
tation to the board at its Novem
ber 1990 meeting. At that point, it
appears that $50,000 of Book
store money had already been
spent on the remodeling.
The report says that the
remodeling loan was not brought
up at the November meeting,
though, because the discussion
was "entirely devoted" to severe
problems the Bookstore was expe
riencing with its investment port
folio. The problems resulted in
the forced resignation of McDon
ald, the store's conroller, and
eventually led to a loss of $1.8 mil
lion for the store on its invest
ment portfolio.
The long delay in obtaining
board approval for the loan, the
report concludes, was "a substan
tial breach" of Speed and Chiara
monte's management responsibil
ities.
Last month, Chiramonte made
arrangements to refinance the
loan through the Bank of America
and repaid the Bookstore in full.
Speed's loan
Back in 1981, the Bookstore
loaned Speed $60,000 to remodel
his home in Fremont. The board
approved an initial interest rate of
10 percent on the loan, which the
reports says was "substantially"
below market rates for similar
loans at the time.
The report recommends that
the board determine the differ
ence in value between what Speed
would have paid under fair-mar
ket rates and try to recoup that
amount plus the interest the store
would have earned if the unpaid
sum had been invested.
By 1984, the remaining principal
on Speed's loan was $58,000. At

that point, Speed
apparently began
informal talks
with some of the
board members,
including then
president Jack
Friedenthal, a
Stanford law pro
fessor at the time,
about alternatives
to his current

method of paying back the loan.
After some discussion, the
report says, the parties agreed to a
cancellation of the $58,000 loan in
exchange for a 10 percent equity
interest in Speed's home. Under
the agreement — which wasn't
formally approved by the board
until two years later — the Book-

store will get one-tenth of the sale
price when Speed sells his home.
The report says that Speed
believed his home was worth
$400,000 at the time and indicat
ed that 10 percent of the house
was probably not worth $58,000.
But, according to Speed, the
shortfall was deemed acceptable
by one of the directors because
the director thought the value of
Speed's home would be roughly
$1 million by the time he retired.
The home's worth today, how
ever, is only $600,000, according
to the report. Thus, the Book
store's equity-interest in the home
is $60,000 — an increase of only
$2,000 from the time the loan was
canceled seven years ago.
'Erroneous' filings
The report notes that both the
loans to Speed and Chiaramonte

would likely be
considered illegal
if the two man
agers were corpo
rate officers
"within the
meaning of state
corporate law."
For years, the
store has listed
Speed as the chief
executive officer

of the Bookstore and Chiaramonte
as its secretary and treasurer in its
annual filings with the Secretary
of State.
But the report contends that
the filings have been "erroneous"
because neither manager was ever
"expressly elected" by the board
to hold office. Under California

law, either the president of the
corporation or the chair of the
board is considered the chief exec
utive officer, the report says. His
tory Prof. Peter Stansky, the
board's current president, there
fore should have been listed as the
Bookstore's chief executive offi
cer, according to the report.
Nevertheless, the report says,
the incident raises ethical con
cerns: "Both Speed's disburse
ment of over $200,000 in Book
store funds for the benefit of
Chiaramonte without board
approval, and the board's approval
of a substantial loan to an insider,
reflect the same problem as the
Twain Harte house and (motor
home) leases: the Bookstore's fail
ure to observe the ethical norms of
the nonprofit sector."
The Bookstore has no written
or unwritten policy on employee
loans, according to the report. The
report recommends that the store
avoid employee loans in the future,
except in cases of emergency.
The report also notes that doc
uments protecting the Book
store's interest in regard to both
Speed and Chiaramonte's loans
were never filed with the proper
county government offices. The
report draws no conclusion as to
why the documents were not filed.
Company cars
Since 1986, the Bookstore has
provided cars to 11 of its employ
ees. According to the report, the
practice is not governed by any
written policy and has never been
formally considered by the store's

board of directors, even in connec
tion with the overall compensation
levels of Speed and Chiaramonte.
In fact, the report notes, "many
of the directors expressed surprise
at finding out that Bookstore
employees were using cars owned
or leased by the Bookstore."
Speed, the store's general man
ager, currently has use of a 1991
model year Infiniti Q45, which
the store is leasing for $913 a
month.
In the past seven years, Speed
has been provided with six other
cars owned or leased by the Book
store: a 1990 Cadillac Seville, a
1989 Cadillac Fleetwood, a 1988
Acura Legend, a 1985 Buick Elec
tra, a 1987 Porsche 911, and a
1989 Porchse 911.
From December 1986 through
December 1990, Speed appears to
have been regularly assigned two
company cars.
The report lists three vehicles
which have been assigned to Chiara
monte in recent years: a 1990 Cadil
lac Eldorado, a 1987 Porsche 911,
and a 1989 Porsche 911 Turbo.
No formal approval
In recent years, the provision
of vehicles has been considered
compensation to Speed and
Chiaramonte. The effect has been
to raise their salaries by more
than $10,000 a year.
While these increases were
reported on both managers' indi
vidual income taxes, there is no
evidence that the increases were
ever formally approved by the
board of directors, the report says.
In an interview last night,

Weisberg, the board's spokesper
son, said it appeared that Frieden
thal, the board's president until
1988, had been aware of the situ
ation, and that the other directors
deferred to his judgment. Weis
berg said the subject of providing
cars to managers had not been
discussed in the two years since
he has been on the board.
Friedenthal could not be
reached for comment last night.
In addition to Speed and
Chiaramonte, six other current
employees have use of Bookstore
vehicles.
The report concludes that "the
involvement of a nonprofit
employer in the provision of luxu
ry and sports vehicles to employ
ees cannot be reasonable."
According to the report: "The
issue is the manifest impropriety
of the appearance of the transac
tion. The reaction of the public
(and, indeed, of the Bookstore's
directors) upon learning that the
Bookstore was providing employ
ees with luxury vehicles illus
trates the degree to which this
practice offends the institutional
ethics of nonprofit operations."
Vacation home
Since 1986, the Bookstore has
been leasing a central California
vacation home from Colleagues
Management Services, a consult
ing firm owned and operated by
Speed and Chiaramonte, the
store's top two managers.
The report concludes that the
arrangement was not appropriate
for a college bookstore, that it did
not make economic sense, and that
the decision-making process that led
to the arrangement was "flawed."
"A central theme of the mod
ern nonprofit sector, reflected in
law and in ethical precepts, is con
cern about self-dealing and avoid
ance of any appearance of waste
or of improper economic benefit
to insiders," the report says."The
record indicates . . . that the
board was not aware of the impli
cations of this transaction."
Option to buy
The arrangement, the report
says, was approved by the store's
board at a meeting in February
1986. The minutes indicate that
the Bookstore would enter into a
one-year lease with the managers'
consulting firm. At the end of the
first year, the Bookstore would
have the option to purchase the
property, according to the minutes.
The lease was signed by
Chiaramonte on behalf of Col
leagues Management and by
McDonald, the Bookstore's con
troller at the time, on behalf of
the Bookstore. For reasons that
the report does not make clear,
the Bookstore's option to pur
chase is not included in the lease.
The report says there is no evi
dence that the Bookstore's board
reviewed the lease after it had
been signed.
The lease does not specify a
monthly rental amount, but
instead calls for the Bookstore to
make payments on the loans
obtained by Speed and Chiara
monte's consulting firm to
finance the construction of the
two-story, four-bedroom vacation
home. To date, those payments
have totaled $179,000.
The Bookstore also spent more

Beginning in fall 1990, the Stanford Bookstore began paying various contractors for remodeling work done on the San Jose home, shown
above, of Philip Chiaramonte, the store's assistant manager. The tab, which eventually exceeded $200,000, was considered a loan to
Chiaramonte and was approved by the store's board of directors — but not until six months after the work had begun, when the board was
first informed of the construction.
than $73,000 of its funds to fur
nish the home and to purchase a
small sailboat for use in the area.
The report notes that manage
ment never sought approval for
these expenditures.
According to the report, the
house has been used by 28 different
employees during the last six years.
By far, Speed and Chiaramonte
have been the most frequent users.
In addition to serving as a
fringe benefit for the staff, the
arrangement on the vacation
home was intended to supplement
Speed and Chiaramonte's retire
ment plans, the report says. Since
their consulting firm owned the
property and home, they would be
the beneficiaries when the proper
ty was sold, profiting by several
hundred thousand dollars.
The report says that the lease
arrangement appears to have
come about because Friedenthal,
the board president at the time,
feared Speed and Chiaramonte
might leave for higher-paying jobs
elsewhere. Friedenthal, the report
says, was also aware that the man
agers' salaries were already
among the industry's highest.
"It appears that the combina
tion of Professor Friedenthal's
desire to provide Speed and
Chiaramonte with an economic
inducement to stay with the Book
store, other than straight salary,
and the latter's desire to benefit
the Bookstore, led to the vacation
home lease," the report says.
Motor home
In June 1989 the Bookstore
entered into a second lease
arrangement with Speed and Chi
ramonte's consulting firm, this
time for a 27-foot motor home.
Under the terms of the lease, the
Bookstore has been paying Speed

and Chiaramonte's consulting firm
$982.50 per month. More than
$35,000 has been paid thus far.
The report says there is no evi
dence that the store's board of
directors authorized the lease or
was advised of its existence. The
lease was signed by Chiaramonte
on behalf of his and Speed's con
sulting firm, and by McDonald,
the Bookstore's controller at the
time, on behalf of the Bookstore.
The Bookstore's total obligation
on the lease is $70,740.
The report concludes that
management "erred significantly"
by failing to get the board's
approval on the lease.
According to the report, no
records have been kept on the use
of the motor home, but it appears
to have been used by only four
employees, two of whom are Speed
and Chiaramonte. The other two
are Greg Gunn, the store's comput
er programmer, and Scott Frisby,
the store's distribution manager.
Investment club
In addition to managing the
Bookstore's investment portfolio,
McDonald, the store's former con
troller, managed an employee
"investment club" account, which
consisted of employees' personal
funds. Speed, the store's general
manager, was among the employees
involved in the club, the report says.
Early in 1990, $60,000 in Book
store funds were incorrectly credit
ed to the employee account, accord
ing to the report. The report says it
is not clear whether the transfer
occurred as the result of miscom
munication between McDonald
and the store's broker, as McDon
ald has said, or as the result of a
deliberate action of McDonald.
The report notes that "at a min
imum, McDonald did not correct
the error when he discovered it."
The $60,000 that was trans

ferred to the employee account
was apparently lost in the market.
The transfer, the report says, was
discovered by Chiaramonte, the
store's assistant manager, after
McDonald had been terminated
for poor management of the Book
store's investment portfolio.
According to the report,
McDonald has agreed to pay the
lost amount.
Housing program
Since the mid-1980s, the Book
store has assisted several of its
employees in obtaining new homes.
The general pattern has been for
the Bookstore to contribute a sub
stantial fraction of the down pay
ment on the employee's home in
exchange for a percentage of the
home's worth when it is sold.
The report concludes that the
practice may be economically
advantageous to the Bookstore, but
nevertheless raises some concerns.
The store has invested $325,000
in employee homes, yet the practice
was never formally approved by the
board of directors. Some directors
were aware of the practice, while
others knew nothing about it, the
reports says. With the exception of
an arrangement made with Speed,
the store's general manager, none
of the specific housing arrange
ments was reviewed by the board,
according to the report.
The housing assistance pro
gram has been "deficient" in sev
eral ways, the report concludes:
"It does not appear that either
board or management ever adopt
ed a consistent policy regarding
eligibility, maximum amount to
be invested, repayment terms
upon departure, and the like."
The report recommends that
the Bookstore get a professional
evaluation of the existing equity
arrangements and negotiate
adjustments if necessary.
