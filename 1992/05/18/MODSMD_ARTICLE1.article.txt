# Bookstore perks were 'inappropriate,' review finds
## 'Failure to observe ethical norms' cited; attorney general's investigation widens 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The directors and top managers of the
Stanford Bookstore have not acted fraud
ulently or dishonestly, but have made
serious ethical errors over the past sever
al years, according to a report commis
sioned by the store's board of directors.
The report follows three months of
work by two law firms and an accounting
firm retained by the Bookstore in the
wake of press disclosures about question
able compensation arrangements and
management practices at the store.
Among other things, the report says
the review found that:
• During the last seven years, the
Bookstore has provided Eldon Speed, its
general manager, with seven different
luxury automobiles. For the entire 1990
calendar year, Speed was assigned two
cars, a Cadillac Seville and a Porsche 911.

• Philip Chiaramonte, the store's
assistant manager, was assigned two
company cars that year as well: a Cadillac
Eldorado and a Porsche 911 Turbo, a
vehicle that the Bookstore was leasing for
$1,400 a month.
• The same year, the nonprofit Book
store began paying various contractors
for remodeling work on Chiaramonte's
San Jose home. The tab, which eventual
ly exceeded $200,000, was considered a
loan to Chiaramonte and was approved
by the store's board of directors — but
not until six months after the work had
begun, when the board was first
informed of the construction.
• About $60,000 in Bookstore invest
ment funds were incorrectly transferred
into an employee "investment club"
account managed by then-controller
Patrick McDonald. McDonald, who was
terminated because of his poor handling
of the Bookstore's investment portfolio,

did not correct the error when he discov
ered it.
A copy of the report was made available
Friday to the California Attorney Gener
al's Office, which is investigating the
Bookstore to determine whether the store
has complied with applicable state laws.
The attorney general's investigation
was prompted by a Daily story in early
February that disclosed that the Book
store had for several years been providing
its senior employees with a host of
perquisites unheard of elsewhere in the
industry. The perquisites included the
use of a central California vacation home,
a motor home, a small sailboat and sever

al luxury automobiles.
The vacation home and motor home
are owned by Speed and Chiaramonte,
and are leased back to the Bookstore
through a consulting firm operated by
the two managers.
The report calls the perquisites
"unreasonable" and "inappropriate" and
says the Bookstore's lease agreements
with Speed and Chiaramonte's consulting
firm represent a "failure to observe the
ethical norms of the nonprofit sector."
Responding to recommendations made
in the report, the Bookstore's board
announced Friday that the leases on the
vacation home and motor home would be
terminated and that the Bookstore's "com
pany car program" would be discontinued.
It remains unclear how the vacation
home arrangement will be "unwound,"
as called for in the report. Since 1986, the
Bookstore has paid $179,000 in rent to
Speed and Chiaramonte's consulting
firm for use of the home in Twain Harte,
Calif. The store has also spent more than
$69,000 on furnishings and improve
ments — including a hot tub and satellite
dish — and has paid an additional

$31,800 for property taxes, insurance,
utilities and cleaning.
The report concludes that the Book
store has paid far more to use the house
than it would have had it instead rented a
comparable home in the area from a third
party. One alternative suggested in the
report is for Speed and Chiaramonte's
consulting firm to refund the difference
between what the Bookstore has paid
them and the lease's fair-market value.
The report, which was overseen by an
audit committee working independently
of the store's directors, is highly critical of
the Bookstore's board. While the report
asserts that the board has "satisfied the
minimum acceptable standard of care
required of law," it calls the board's level
of oversight "inappropriate" for a busi
ness enterprise the size of the Bookstore.
The report recommends a major
restructuring of the board and the elec
tion of a new president. Accordingly, the
board last week voted to create three new
committees that will work to write new
bylaws for the corporation, undertake a
