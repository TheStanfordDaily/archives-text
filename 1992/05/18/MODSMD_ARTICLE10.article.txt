The Bookstore has spent close to $300,000 dur
ing the last three months on legal and accounting
fees connected with the investigation of its business
practices, according to Law Prof. Robert Weinberg.
Weisberg, a Bookstore director who has been des
ignated as the board's spokesperson, said the expen
ditures represent "a horrifying amount" of money.
But, he said, "that's what these things take."
The review, which has been coordinated by an
audit committee working independently of the
board, has involved two law firms and an account
ing firm.
Weisberg said he expects the legal and account

ing expenses to tail off significantly now that the
committee's report has been released. Several
issues raised in the report, however, are still being
investigated.
The three members of the audit committee
have served without compensation. They are:
• Emeritus Psychology Prof. Albert Hastorf, a
former vice president and provost at Stanford;
• Leslie Luttgens, former president of the
Council on Foundations and a member of the
board of directors of Pacific Telesis Corp., Pacific
Gas & Electric, and McKesson Corp.; and
• Morton Winston, the chair of the audit com
mittee of the Museum of Contemporary Art in
Los Angeles and former president and chief exec
utive officer of Tosco Corp.
