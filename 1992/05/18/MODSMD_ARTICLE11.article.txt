Thai troops fire on demonstrators
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) — Troops opened fire on pro
democracy demonstrators Monday after protests by thousands of
people demanding the prime minister's ouster turned violent, and
the government declared a state of emergency.
Hospital officials and witnesses say at least nine people were
killed and hundreds injured in the unrest.
The shooting occurred at dawn after troops trapped some 20,000
demonstrators on Rajdamnern Avenue, a major thoroughfare where
a student-led uprising erupted in 1973 and toppled a military junta.
Unrest had begun Sunday with a peaceful rally calling for the
resignation of pro-military Prime Minister Suchinda Kraprayoon.
After a night of violent clashes in the heart of the capital,
Suchinda declared a state of emergency in the capital and four
surrounding provinces.
The emergency gives Suchinda wide powers but stops short of
martial law. Authorities banned gatherings of more than 10 peo
ple, clamped curbs on the press and closed schools for three days.
Suchinda, a general who spearheaded a military coup last year,
has been criticized for going back on a pledge not to become prime
minister.
He was appointed to the post in early April by a coalition of
pro-military parties, aggravating growing resentment over
decades of deep military involvement in politics.
Protesters are also angry he is not an elected member of par
liament.
Gen. Thitipong Jetnnuwat told reporters Monday that troops
killed five people including a foreign journalist.
Two foreign reporters and some demonstrators said they saw a
number of wounded and at least six killed by troops.
That was in addition to three deaths reported by hospitals on
Sunday. But a number of witnesses reported seeing others killed,
with some bodies being taken away in army trucks.
