# Participants discuss isolationism's dangers

### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
World leaders, meeting in a conference at Stan
ford, continued their pleas for constructive U.S.
involvement in international affairs Friday, saying
isolationism and protectionism would be a "paradox
and a tragedy."
Bob Hawke, former prime minister of Australia,
said in a speech at the Ford Center that the United
States must not turn its former Cold War allies,
such as Japan and Singapore, into "the enemies of
tomorrow."
Lee Kuan Yew, senior minister of Singapore, also
stressed the need for the United States to maintain
close ties with its neighbors on the Pacific Rim.
"You can't go back — having invented the jumbo
jet and the satellite — to the steamship and two
oceans and be a happy America, semi-isolated from
the rest of the world," he said. "You have got used to
Japanese cars and Singapore-made laptops, and
that's the way to the future."
Hawke and Lee are members of the advisory
council of Stanford's Institute for International
Studies, which held its annual meeting Thursday
and Friday. In their speeches at the meeting's open
ing Thursday, they made similar comments urging
the U.S. to cure its domestic ills and take a firmer
role in leading the world economy.

During the Cold War, Hawke said Friday, the
United States praised countries that adhered to the
principles of the capitalist system, saying they demon
strated "the benefits and correctness" of the system.
It is "absolutely fundamental," Hawke said, that
the United States solve disputes with Japan "not by
walking away from the principles of the past, but by
ensuring that they are continued into the future."
He added that it would be "a paradox and a tragedy"
if the U.S. reneged on its Cold War commitment to
free, multilateral trade.
History Prof. Barton Bernstein, chair of the Inter
national Relations program, said "it's certainly rea
sonable" that the leaders would discourage protec
tionism or other policies that cut into world trade.
But he added that he fears the leaders' expecta
tions may extend beyond "the reduction of trade
barriers and the quest for untrammeled trade" to a
desire for continued U.S. military intervention in
some world conflicts.
Political Science Prof. David Holloway, co-direc
tor of the Center for International Security and
Arms Control, said he favors a multilateral approach
for the United States, in both economic and military
policy.
Military actions, he said, should have the
approval of the United Nations Security Council,
and international trade policies should be anti-pro
tectionist.
