## What a scapegoat 
### 
Why blame L.A. riots on
a dead president and his
plans for a great society?

STRAIGHT FROM THE
blame factory our leadership
has found a scapegoat for the
Los Angeles riots.
It's time to breath a sigh of relief
because it's perfectly clear that
urban ills are because of. . .Lyndon.
Lyndon Johnson, that is. Not to
worry — it's not our fault or that of
the people we elected recently.
And now that we know the prob
lem was spending too much money
and energy, all we have to do to fix
decrepit inner cities is do less. It
won't hurt. . .at least for another
precariously peaceful while. Not to
worry.
Nobody seems to doubt the good
intentions of Lyndon Johnson's
Great Society — not even Marlin
Fitzwater, who, just last week,
traced the bedlam following the
King trial verdict to the slew of leg
islation adopted in the late '60s that
established and extended social ser
vices for the poor and minorities.
The administration backed off
from publicizing that opinion, but
it doesn't seem to have changed its
mind.
The Higher Education Act, col
lege work study, the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act, the
Teacher Corps and the Adult Liter
acy Program were all Great Society
contributions. Strange targets
indeed for the "Education Presi
dent" who promised to devote him
self to better education for all
Americans.
Maybe after the racial and eco
nomic divisiveness of inner cities
comes to the fore we should expect
the president who ran on the
Willie Horton platform to blast the
Voting Rights Act or the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, two eminent
Great Society achievements.
After all, if past attempts to
make America free of hate and

inequality didn't work, why work
harder and pass stronger legisla
tion now?
Last week's "Six Point Action
Plan," touted by Bush as "radical,"
proposes nothing that hasn't been
through committees, caucuses and
compromises before. And a display
of bipartisan support cannot hide
the lack of enthusiasm both parties
share for a package no one seriously
believes will effect lasting changes.
Democrats grumbled that the
effort was too little, but gave up
clamoring for gun control and
extension of unemployment bene
fits in the interests of an unprece
dented compromise. Unfortunate
ly, there's plenty of precedent for
expedient concessions.
Many Republicans feared that
new money spent on social services
to the devastated areas of L.A.
would reward rioters who might
take advantage of an easy path to
government coffers. If this is our
governing logic then perhaps we
could just mete out spankings
instead of prison terms, drug raids
or even loans to rebuild.
Reagan conceded that "poverty
won," and ever since, we've decided
not to worry about a lost cause.
The lowest income group, full-time
working people earning $12,195
and less, increased sharply in the
same 10 years wealth was sup
posed to be trickling down from the
highest income group. In 1992
Ross Perot has $100 million to
spend on a candidacy, and immi
grant-owned South-Central gro
ceries are going belly up.
In recent polls, an overwhelming
majority of Americans feel that the
problems of the big cities are being
mishandled. Few people seem will
ing to dedicate the sort of time and
money that went into the Great
Society, but we need similar educa
tion and job training programs
now. We need determination and
hope once again.
The answers do not lie in blaming
historical standards we haven't been
able to recover, but in putting our
intelligence, laws, energy and money
where our sound bites have been.
