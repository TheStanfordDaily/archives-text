## Don't listen too carefully 
### 
I WAS ALL SET to vote for Barbara
Boxer. It seemed as if every time I saw
her quoted in the paper I agreed with
what she had to say.
So, it was with understandably high
hopes that I went to Kresge Auditorium
Friday to hear her speak. As part of her
campaign for the Senate seat being vacat
ed by Alan Cranston, she came to campus
to address "The Domestic Agenda and
the Future of America."
And, in fact, her speech, though a little
brief, seemed passionate and rather com
pelling. I felt validated. That is, until I
started paying closer attention.
If I hadn't been taking notes, I proba
bly would have walked away thinking the
speech was wonderful. It felt like a good
speech: full of compassion and energy
and let's-take-it-to-'em enthusiasm — all
a politician could hope for, really.
But I did take notes, and looking back,
I wonder just what she said. She reeled
off a lot of statistics — most of them dis
turbing; ergo, things aren't going so well.
And she made a very convincing argu
ment for the need to have more women in
Congress. (You don't have to be Hegel to
make that argument.)
But unless I missed something, she left
out why I should vote for her: Not once
did she describe a specific goal she wanted
to accomplish other than having women
more involved. It was as if her gender was
the only reason to vote for her.

Well, so maybe the speech wasn't that
terrific. I was still determined to be
impressed, so I raced up to her after the
speech, notebook in hand, ready to give
her a shot, a redemption.
I figured I'd give her something to sink
her teeth into; something important to
me as well as something relevant to her
being at Stanford. And on top of it, I'd
ask something she probably wasn't asked
very often, giving her the chance to talk
about something different for a change.
Don't believe the hype. Somehow, the
vacuous response I received wasn't quite
what I had in mind.
Most of Boxer's campaign materials
refer to her record of fighting government
waste. Seeing these words, I immediately
thought: "indirect costs." Which led me to
university research, and that certainly
has to do with the domestic agenda.
Stanford has been at the center of the
indirect-cost controversy, and she came
here to speak; she must have something
to say on the issue. So I ask: "What role
— and how extensive a role — do you see
the federal government playing in sup
port of university research?"
Huh? It was if I had asked her about
eating disorders in Guadeloupe.
"University research is absolutely nec
essary," she began.
You don't say.
"But we have to be sure that there's
no waste."

Whoa! Deep, dude.
So what do we need? "A strong univer
sity research plan with reforms to make
sure nothing is wasted." And, reassuring
ly, such a plan is "not that hard."
Is that the best you can do? Plati
tudes? This is the person I'm supposed to
vote for? I don't care if you weren't
briefed on the subject; if you want to be a
senator, you have to have something to
say — particularly on an issue as vital to
the country as the research performed at
our nation's universities.
You know, as a young journalist, I
often get nervous approaching "impor
tant" people. So, before asking you a
question, I wanted to make sure I
wouldn't waste your time.
You wasted my time. Your answer
showed no creativity, no appreciation for
a fundamental issue, not even an interest
in gaining my vote.
Coming in, my support had been
strong, but I really couldn't articulate
why I was going to vote for you, or why
someone else should vote for you.
Apparently, you couldn't tell me,
either.

ly, such a plan is "not that hard."
Is that the best you can do? Plati
tudes? This is the person I'm supposed to
vote for? I don't care if you weren't
briefed on the subject; if you want to be a
senator, you have to have something to
say — particularly on an issue as vital to
the country as the research performed at
our nation's universities.
You know, as a young journalist, I
often get nervous approaching "impor
tant" people. So, before asking you a
question, I wanted to make sure I
wouldn't waste your time.
You wasted my time. Your answer
showed no creativity, no appreciation for
a fundamental issue, not even an interest
in gaining my vote.
Coming in, my support had been
strong, but I really couldn't articulate
why I was going to vote for you, or why
someone else should vote for you.
Apparently, you couldn't tell me,
either.
