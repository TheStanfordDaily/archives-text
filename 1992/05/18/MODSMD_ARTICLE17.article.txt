Reflections on the King case, media images and violence

Everywhere visions appear
on television and in the print of
countless men and women rampag
ing through their own communities, torch
ing and looting local stores and shops.
"Don't they realize they're destroying
their own neighborhoods?" The ques
tion is innocently asked, but the answer
both startles and shocks the questioner.
Of course the individuals rioting
know they are burning down their own
stores, community markets whose mer
chants probably will not return.
They know that the Korean grocery
store with the broken windows and rav
aged aisles is located on their block; it's
not a Wal-Mart in Topeka, Kansas.
It is insulting everyone's intelligence
to try to rationalize that, if the individu
als in the area just calm down and think
about it, they will realize that the
destruction is wrong and irrational.

The violence that reared its head has
always been around, since the inception of
America. The rape and pillage of all minor
ity groups by the system is a violent act.
The high infant mortality rates, mass
cyclic poverty, hunger, homelessness and
horrid educational opportunities are all
violent acts. The denial of adequate
housing, the glass ceilings of corporate
life, all violent acts, each enforced, pro
tected, and nurtured by the system.
When those subject to constant vio
lence every moment of their lives respond
in kind, people everywhere should not
appear shocked and dismayed by destruc
tion and death, but should analyze the
causes of the violence behind the violence.
But is it only minority groups that are
subject to the violence of the system? Is
the implanting of racist and stereotyped
images into the consciousness of all Ameri
cans by the media, manipulating and con

trolling our thoughts until we cannot rec
ognize our own ideas from those the gov
ernment wants us to think — is this in
itself not a violent and despicable action?
Take for example the Rodney King
verdict and subsequent violence. The
media feeds us solely pictures of blacks
and Hispanics rioting and looting. The
commentaries concerning the riots
decry the animalistic behavior of the
neighborhoods, the supposed blatant
opportunism of all involved.
Because of this slant on news coverage,
we, the public, are deceived into viewing
minorities as brutes and savages, con men
and thieves taking advantage of the ver
dict to act out their true natures. We need
more law enforcement, more jails, stiffer
sentences, the death penalty. Exterminate
the brutes, as Kurtz would say.
When we begin to question the racist
slant of the media in relation to the Rod

ney King travails, we start to see its bloody
fingerprint on other issues as well.
If we could understand the manipula
tion of all our minds at the hands of the
media — part of the Establishment — we
would be able to unite against this bla
tant mental abuse and deception.
But we are so blind that we cannot see
it. We are conditioned to accept the
media at face value, and not to question
the validity and slant of its "news."
When we begin to question the authori
ty we discover that we are the authority
and within ourselves is the power and
potential to change tomorrow's status quo.
Reliance on our own ideas and not the
ideas subconsciously shoved down our
throats is the only way we, as Ameri
cans, can realistically have hope for a
better future.
