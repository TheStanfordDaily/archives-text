# Religion not adequate means to banish hate

### 
In their May 14 letter to The Daily,
Steven Phelps and Paul Khavari implore
us to accept that without a belief in God,
there is no compelling reason to see other
human beings as equal.
On the contrary, throughout history
theists have subjugated others "in the
name of God."
Nobody needs reminding of the hor
rors of Afrikaner apartheid, the Khome
ini regime in Iran, the Holocaust, the
Inquisition. Even here on our own cam
pus, we have Christian groups who
would like to outlaw homosexuality,
because it is an "abomination" accord
ing to their God.
How can there be such hatred from
groups who supposedly all believe in a
"higher unifying principle," as Phelps
and Khavari put it?
A belief in God is by necessity an act
of faith, and therefore subjective. jj e nce

there is no objective or rational method
for deciding the merits of one group's
belief in God over another's.
The theist's justification for his
morality is "because God says so."
Well, tell me, how do we decide whose
God is right? Is it Yahweh, Allah, the
Christian God or some other religion's
incarnation of a higher being?
Unlike theism, which offers only irra
tional postulates based on faith, it is the
acceptance of man as a rational creature
that compels us to see human beings as
equals. We know that we have a com
mon ability to think and to act rational
ly, and we therefore respect and treat
others as our peers.
It is this very ability to use reason
which should form the basis of our
moral system — a system based on rea
son and objectivity, rather than one
based on superstitious whims.
