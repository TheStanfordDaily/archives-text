# Suggestions offered for new residences' design
## 
### 
In response to Thursday's article in
The Daily regarding the planned stu
dent housing for the Knoll site, we
would like to reiterate our reasons for
suggesting that the new residences be
more than "environmentally-forward"
in "elements" of their design.
As a dynamic institution, Stanford
has taken leadership in many areas.
Everything from ethnic theme houses
and multiculturalism to research in
engineering and the natural sciences
suggests that Stanford accepts willingly
the challenge of thinking and acting
innovatively.
We are advocating the extension of
this unofficial policy to the design and
construction of buildings on campus.
At a minimum, both of the new resi
dences should be constructed in an
energy-efficient manner with recycled
and non-toxic materials.

We also propose that the smaller 60-
70 person house be a model residence â€”
incorporating appropriate and efficient
technology as well as being carefully
integrated with the ecology of the site.
Shortsightedness should not prevent
us from reaping the benefits of a com
mitment to principles of sustainability
in the very design of the buildings.
Concern for the Earth and its
biosystem isn't a fad nor a waning
"student interest." We have the chance
to be a model for other universities and
for our community. Stanford must
seize this opportunity!
