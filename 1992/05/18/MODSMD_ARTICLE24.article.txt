# Boxer calls for investment in 'people, jobs, environment'
## Some in audience question candidate's lack of specifics 
### Sara Skinner Staff writer 
Stressing the need for military reductions, environ
mental protection and women in politics, U.S. Con
gresswoman Barbara Boxer addressed students and
community members at Kresge Auditorium Friday.
Boxer delivered a speech titled "The Domestic
Agenda and the Future of America" to an audience
of about 100. Presented by the National Women's
Political Caucus of Stanford, Boxer's speech was a
part of her U.S. Senate campaign.
Rather than use the too-tall podium, she spoke
without notes. And her energetic delivery more than
compensated for her height of approximately 5 feet.
Boxer began by addressing the recent Los Angeles
riots. "We finally saw Bush's 1,000 points of lights
in L.A.," she said.
Boxer said she advocates using the money now
spent on military defense of Japan and Germany to
"invest in our people, our jobs, our environment."
In response to questions about her plans to
reduce the deficit, she said that at least 20 percent of
the military budget cuts should currently go into
reducing the deficit, and up to 50 percent after the
recession is over.
Boxer also said she has worked to preserve the
environment with her National Ocean Protection
Act banning offshore drilling. She told the audience,
"Don't put the environment and economy at odds."
"Cleaning up the environment would create thou
sands of jobs," even though resources will have to be
channeled to train the workers, she said.
Asked to explain bouncing over 400 checks at the
House bank, Boxer said, "I got overdraft protection
in the bank that gives it." She added that people can
look at the "pros and cons" of her candidacy and
decide whom to vote for.

Boxer elicited a standing ovation when she
emphasized that the women in Congress had earned
their right to be there.
She said she hopes to raise the percentage of
women in the Senate, which is currently two out of
100. "It's important because we're running a coun
try, not a country club," she said.
Criticizing Bush for the homogeneity of his staff,
she said, "When everybody sitting around the table
looks the same, we're not getting everybody's views."
Women "bring a perspective that is needed," she
said, especially when discussing issues such as the Free
dom of Choice Act, sexual harassment and child care.
Questioned on whether she considered herself an
outsider, Boxer replied, "Any woman is an outsider."
Boxer also emphasized her pro-choice stance. "We
need someone who's going to go toe to toe with Jesse
Helms.. .to protect a woman's right to choose," she
said.
Although student audience members criticized
Boxer's lack of specifics, many said they generally
supported her ideology.
"Those are all projects that need money," said
another, "and the money needs to come from some
where. Is cutting defense enough? Is it going to have
to come from taxes? Whose taxes?"
Brent Williams, a 1991 Stanford graduate who
attended the speech, said he believes that Boxer
"really understands women's issues."
He said he sees the need to elect women because
"there are certain issues that men just don't get,"
such as reproductive rights. "Maybe we shouldn't be
making the decisions. Maybe women should be mak
ing the decisions."
Anna Eshoo, a local candidate for state Congress
who attended the speech, said that women's "experi
ence needs to be incorporated ... to shape public
policy."
