# For Davis, the revolution continues
## Activist exhorts Kresge crowd to participate in social struggle 
### Cheo H. Coker Staff writer 
The '90s are the perfect time for
women to become "conscious agents" in
transforming their lives and their com
munities, author and activist Angela
Davis said Friday.
As the keynote speaker for Black
Women's Celebration Week, Davis told
an audience filling Kresge Auditorium
that women of color can make a differ
ence despite the various socioeconomic
obstacles facing them.
"We are building bridges to align
ourselves in a cause that will bring
[womenl together across cultural, eth
nic, sexual and class lines," she said.
Davis, currently a professor at UC-
Santa Cruz, said she hasn't completely
forsaken her commitment to the social
struggle in favor of academia.
An excerpt from her autobiography
read during hfer speech says, "Revolu
tion was never an interim thing for me
to do before settling down.. . . When
one commits oneself to the struggle, it
must be for a lifetime."
Davis not only to came to Stanford to
address a the accomplishments of black
women, but also to "assist in the pro
cess of making the questions that will

hopefully lead in the direction of
answers."
She said these answers need to resolve
such issues as the Rodney King verdict
and the lack of historical acknowledge
ment of the progress made by black
women in the struggle for freedom.
"People have to remember that not
only men, but women have been the
victims of police brutality" she said, cit
ing her own experiences with the police.
"Think about the fact that there could
have been a woman [in the position of
King] and how many women have been
there."
Davis also pointed out the long-time
commitment many women of color
have had to the civil rights struggle.
"Women have been at the forefront of
the movement to defend and protect our
brothers for as long as we can remem
ber," she said, making reference to the
anti-lynching efforts of Ida B. Wells.
Davis also said that the King verdict,
despite its racial nature, needs to be
interpreted through other means than
Civil Rights laws.
"Police departments are some of the
biggest perpetrators of hate crimes in
the whole country," she said. "Why
hasn't it occurred to any prosecutor
that those policemen could have been

prosecuted under the California hate
crimes laws?"
Toward the end of her address,
Davis helped lay out a foundation for
the future leaders in the audience.
She urged them to get involved with
forcing fundamental change instead of
succumbing to "the proliferation of
images, slogans, and evocations of politi
cal heroes from the past [that has] become
a surrogate for political action today."
"The 'X' hat does not make the revo
lutionary or the activist," she said.
She also reminded women, who are
often faced with male revolutionary
role models like Malcolm X, that it is
possible to be a woman and foster simi
lar beliefs.
"I am the living proof that a woman
can be influenced by Malcolm X," she
said. "His oratory and his organizing
work played an important role in shap
ing my political consciousness and mov
ing me to action."
After providing her answers for
social change, Davis asked the audience
for their solutions and comments.
"Regardless of your ethnic or cultur
al background, all of us need to think
about what we can do," she said. "I
need you to tell me what to do this time
around, because things have changed."
