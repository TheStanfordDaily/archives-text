# Stanford accounting systems improving, outside firm finds
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Stanford has made progress in implementing
improved internal accounting systems in the wake of
the indirect-cost controversy, an independent
accounting firm reported Friday.
The 78-page report by Arthur Andersen & Co.
reviews the University's efforts to enact a 35-point
program recommended by the firm last July to
"reduce Stanford's risk of noncompliance with appli
cable government regulations."
But the report also said more needs to be done in
a variety of areas, including the hiring of a cost com
pliance support officer and the completion of a new
cost accounting manual.
Chief Financial Officer Peter Van Etten said in a
letter that he was "pleased with this first report" and
acknowledged "a number of areas where we need to
concentrate attention in the coming months."
"There is not a final point when we expect to have
all of the recommendations implemented, but we
hope that many will be completed within the next six
months," Van Etten said in a separate interview.
Friday's "report card" is the first of several "period
ic updates" by Arthur Andersen on Stanford's progress
in upgrading its accounting systems, Van Etten said,
and the next assessment is due in about six months.
The report noted that the ongoing government
audits of Stanford's indirect-cost practices has
slowed the University's progress.

"The implementation process has been severely
impeded by the current need to direct substantial
University personnel and financial resources to
innumerable projects related to pressing govern
ment audit and administrative activities which
Stanford has been required to address on a real-time
basis," the report said.
Van Etten said University and government audi
tors have been working together very closely, and he
added he hopes this report will aid attempts to
resolve the current indirect-cost impasse.
"This report will help as we continue to work
with the Office of Naval Research and the Defense
Contract Audit Agency," Van Etten said. "We will
continue to try to come to some resolution on the
current (indirect-cost) rate for this year and particu
larly for the 1993 fiscal year."
Stanford is currently operating under a provi
sional indirect-cost rate of 55.5 percent, and Univer
sity officials are negotiating with the Navy for a
higher permanent rate.
"I am hopeful we will have something before the
new fiscal year. Given the enormous amount of work
between the DCAA and Stanford during the last
year, we are in a strong position to come to a solu
tion," he added. "It has been a long, slow road, but
we have made some significant progress."
In the report, Arthur Andersen praised, among
other things, Stanford's efforts to reorganize the
University financial offices and the establishment of
new procedures to review allowable indirect costs.
