# 'Jewish Court' settles dispute
## Rabbis ease tensions between Kosher Co-op, caterers 
### Joel Stein Staff writer 
Instead of bringing their disputes in a county
courtroom, members of the Kennedy Kosher Co
op and a small catering firm decided to take their
differences to another forum — the "Jewish
Court."
Consisting of three rabbis, the court met Fri
day to settle a financial dispute between caterers
Dawn Evans and her fiance, graduate student
Jonathan Klein, and the co-op. The parties dis
agreed over a bill for catering during Passover.
The court, called a Bet Din, was presided over
by Rabbi Amy Eilberg, who works for the Stanford
Hospital, along with a rabbi chosen by each side.
Although two of the rabbis were chosen by the
involved parties, Eilberg said "they acted less like
a lawyer and more like a judge. There was no
sense that one rabbi was pushing for one side and
another rabbi pushing for another."
Eilberg said the tradition of the Bet Din goes
back about 2,000 years. "The Torah tells us that
people who had disputes with one another that they
weren't able to resolve went to Moses, who essen
tially had office hours when he would see people."
Both sides agreed to settle their disagreement

at the suggestion of campus Rabbi Ari Cartun.
"The members of the co-op were quite skepti
cal at first," said junior Dave Bianco. "The notion
was just foreign to most of us."
Each side prepared a three to five page descrip
tion of their complaints and presented these
accounts to the court. After the meeting, which
lasted about two hours, the rabbis convened sepa
rately and decided on a compromise solution.
Klein said that although he had been angry
before the Bet Din he has no hard feelings toward
the co-op. "I feel very positive toward them now,"
he said.
Bianco said, "I think everyone went into the
dispute with high strung emotions and the rabbis
did an excellent job of diffusing that. It was really
neat to be able to settle what was essentially a
legal dispute in a Jewish way."
Eilberg agreed that "it worked extraordinarily
well."
"Going to a civil court is generally an adversar
ial experience. That's about 'How much am I
going to get?' and even 'How can I screw the other
guy?' The choice to come to a Bet Din is to move
beyond that, toward interpersonal reconciliation
— and putting the reconciliation in the spiritual
context. We did that."
