## Card wins series, tourney seedings announced today 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
On a beautiful weekend for
baseball, the Cardinal culminated
the 1992 regular season in style,
taking two out of three games
from the University of Santa
Clara Broncos. Winning their
final series means that Stanford
will carry a lot of momentum into
the NCAA Regional Tournament
later this week.
The first and third games of
the season were played at Buck
Shaw Stadium in Santa Clara. On
Friday, Willie Adams befuddled
opposing hitters with his four
pitch repertoire on the way to a 7-
3 victory.
Adams yielded only one run in
six innings, striking out three
and walking two. Junior Steve
Worrell continued to be impres
sive as he threw the last three
innings to earn his second save of
the season.
Although no one stood out, the
offense found ways to score a lot
of runs, an occurrence that has
become a trend lately. Stanford
added eight hits to the seven
walks issued by Bronco pitcher
Matt Brust to push men across
the plate. Tony Detter hit a solo
home run, his sixth of the year.
On Saturday, the Cardinal
returned to Sunken Diamond for
the last home game of the season. It
was also the very last time seniors
David Cornell, David Holbrook,
Chris Kemper, Steve Solomon,
Tony Detter, and Mark Skeels
would play on their home turf.
Obviously looking for some
thing extra, Stanford Baseball
put on one of its best shows of the
year, if not the best. Everything
came together in a game that
symbolized how far they have
come and how far they can go in
the NCAA Tournament.
As starting pitcher Brian Sack
insky strolled out to the mound
for the first inning, one could
sense the near perfection in the

air. The day was hot and there
was not a cloud in sight. The air
was filled with Tony Detter's con
stant chatter at third base.
This is what a winning team
looks like. Constant talking in
support of the pitcher, hustling
back to the dugout at the end of
each inning, and urging on one's
teammates as they approached
the plate all are signs of a team
that has designs on attending the
College World Series in Omaha.
Sackinsky kept the Bronco bat
ters hitless for five innings before
head coach Mark Marquess pulled
him. The only reason he left was
that Marquess limited his pitches
so he will be ready for Regionals.
"I would have liked to stay in
the game," Sackinsky said about
his chance for a no-hitter. "But
under the circumstances, I under
stand that getting rest for Region
als is more important."
In the bottom of the first,
Stanford sent eight men to the
plate. The inning was highlighted
by a three run home run into the
pines in right field by catcher
Mark Skeels. Freshman Jed
Hansen matched him with an
even deeper blast in the second
inning
After chasing starter Miles
Kelly from the game, the Cardinal
pounded a bevy of Bronco pitch
ers for four more runs in the
sixth. Behind the arm of Rick
Helling, who replaced Sackinsky,
the team coasted to a 9-3 win.
For the final contest, Stanford
returned to Santa Clara riding
the crest of a nine-game winning
streak. Averting the sweep, the
Broncos touched starter Jamie
Sepeda for five runs in the first
three innings and cruised to a 9-4
triumph. The Cardinal finished
the regular season with a 37-21
record.
Steve Solomon went three for
five with two doubles, but it was
not enough to overcome four
errors and two wild pitches. "We
played on our heels a little bit

today," senior outfielder David
Cornell said. "We got sloppy
defense and didn't execute well at
the plate."
"The fact is, maybe it's a good
thing," Cornell said. "We know
now what can happen if we don't
get pumped for every game and
we won't be overconfident, just
strongly confident."
Despite the loss, the Cardinal
has won nine of their last 10
games and feels confident heading
into Regionals. Stanford's seed
and destination will be announced
on ESPN today at noon. They will
definitely receive a two seed and
have an outside shot at a one seed
in their regional.
"This is the best we've been
going all year," Cornell said. "I'm
excited about what we can do and
I think we have a good shot, that's
pretty clear. I want to bring home
a championship for the school."

Al Green — Daily
Oops! While the ball scooted past second baseman Chris Kemper in this attempted pickoff Saturday, the Cardinal captured both the game,
9-3, and the series, two games to one, from Santa Clara.
