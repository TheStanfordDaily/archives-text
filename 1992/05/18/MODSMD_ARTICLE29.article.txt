# Men overcome Duke and LSU, face Bruins in semifinals
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
It has not been easy, but the second-seeded
men's tennis team has fought its way to today's
NCAA Championship semifinal match, where they
will face third-seeded UCLA.
Saturday, the Cardinal scrambled out of the
clutches of second-round elimination by coming
back to defeat Duke.
Yesterday in the quarterfinals, the men crushed
Louisiana State, 5-2. The seventh-seeded Tigers
defeated the Pepperdine Waves in the second round
on Saturday.
Cardinal 5, Blue Devils 1
At one point on Saturday afternoon, it appeared
that the Blue Devils, making only their second
team appearance ever at NCAAs, would sweep the
Cardinal right out of the tournament.
Although Alex O'Brien easily defeated Geoff
Grant, 6-0, 6-2, his teammates had no such luck.
Michael Flanagan lost 6-4, 6-2 in a match that head
coach Dick Gould felt "he was definitely capable of
winning."
Then, all at once, Chris Cocotos lost serve at 3-1
in the third set, putting him at 4-4, Robert Devens

lost a set and a break point, Vimal Patel was down
three match points at fifth singles and Jason Yee
was barely hanging on in the sixth singles slot.
"It very easily could've been 5-1 at that point,"
Gould said. "We were just hoping to get to dou
bles."
Cocotos, however, held serve, Devens broke to
win the second set, Patel fought off the match
points, and Yee held and broke serve. The rest,
as they say, is history.
Cocotos won, 7-5, 2-6, 6-4, in a match spotted
with controversial line calls. Cocotos was up 5-4,
30-30 when his opponent, Chris Pressley of Duke,
had a line call overruled, giving the Stanford sopho
more match point. If Cocotos had any butterflies
while playing in the such a crucial game, they cer
tainly weren't apparent.
"The first five games Chris played as well as I've
seen him play all year," Gould said. "That was a key
match."
Devens also won, 3-6, 7-5, 6-1. "I started pretty
slow," he said. "I was surprised at how nervous I
was. At 4-4 in the second set the guys from my (fra
ternity) house started yelling and it got me pumped
up — I started coming in more and playing more
aggressively."
Patel's efforts at fighting off one match point
after the next were rewarded as he won, 4-6, 6-3, 7-

6 (7-4). Yee had an easier time closing out his
match. The two-time Ail-American won in straight
sets, 6-3, 6-4.
Devens' match, the final singles match to finish,
clinched a team victory, and doubles play was can
celled.
"The first one is always kind of tough, getting
your feet wet after being down here for so long
without playing a match," Gould said.
Cardinal 5, Tigers 2
Yesterday's match was also a fairly long battle
for the Cardinal. The team could not quite clinch
the match in singles. O'Brien again handled his
opponent easily. Mario Pacheco had no chance
against the Stanford senior, who beat him 6-2, 6-3.
"I'm just swingin' away and things are going in,"
O'Brien explained. "He was pretty good but not
unbelievable."
Cocotos, at third singles, also won in straight
sets over Janne Holtari, 7-5, 6-4. Patel fought back
again to win in three sets, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 while Yee
cruised by his competition 6-4, 7-5. "Jason's so
relaxed, it's unbelievable," O'Brien said.
Unfortunately, four wins is not enough to clinch
a match. Flanagan's 6-3, 6-0 loss to Egyptian Davis
Cupper Tamer El Sawy gave the Tigers their first
point of the match.
Flanagan had a difficult time explaining his two
consecutive singles losses. "I don't know what the
deal is," the sophomore said. "I've been playing
great for the last month."
One voice of NCAA experience, co-captain
O'Brien, thinks his early-match jitters are now in
the past: "Michael was struggling in singles, but by
now he's into the tournament and ready to go."
Devens' three-setter with Juha Pesola pushed
the match into doubles. Heat cramps at 5-5 in the
third set hindered Devens' play, and he soon lost, 7-
5, 3-6, 7-5.
However, it was Devens' match with Flanagan at
third doubles which clinched the Cardinal's victory.
Barely able to walk, Devens managed to hold serve
but do little else in doubles. Although his partner
did not serve and volley once, Flanagan covered the
court and led the pair to a 6-3, 6-2 victory.
"Michael deserves a lot of credit," Gould praised.
"He had a real good gutty performance."
O'Brien agreed: "Bobby would serve and be
standing there while Michael was covering the
whole court. He was pretty awesome."
Flanagan seemed to enjoy himself. "It was a lot
of fun. I had free reign to go everywhere," he said.
"Besides, everyone gets nervous when they play
someone who's cramping, because they think they
should definitely win."
Devens' cramps seemed to be a result of his play
ing two three-set singles matches and two sets of
doubles in two days under the blazing Georgia sun.
The rest of the team has held up fairly well in
the heat. All of their matches have started at 4:00
EST, when the air is usually beginning to cool.
The first and second doubles matches were sus
pended when Devens and Flanagan won.
In the other quarterfinals matches, top-seeded
USC defeated Kentucky, 5-3 and UCLA crushed

North Carolina, 5-2.
The day's big upset, though, was Notre Dame's
shocking 5-4 win over fourth-seeded, tournament
host Georgia. Since all three Southeastern Confer
ence teams lost in the quarters, this will be the first
year since 1986 in which the SEC does not have a
representative reach at least the semifinals.
Stanford vs. UCLA
This afternoon, the showdown between North
and South will take place at 4:00. The Cardinal and
the Bruins have played each other twice this sea
son, both winning on their home turf.
The Cardinal men are confident that they can
get by the Bruins. "I'm really happy to be playing
them away from home," Flanagan commented. "I
like their lineup — Vimal's playing real well and
Jason should have a good match against (Mark)
Bissell. I'm counting on myself to come out of my
ifole," he chuckled. "And we have really strong dou
bles teams."
O'Brien is also looking forward to his duel with
Mark Knowles, the fourth-ranked player in the
nation. "He's a shot-maker — he can make any
shot from any place on the court. I'm just going to
go out and give him a workout.
"UCLA is the team of the century if they play
well, but we have a shot if we stay in every match."

match."
Devens also won, 3-6, 7-5, 6-1. "I started pretty
slow," he said. "I was surprised at how nervous I
was. At 4-4 in the second set the guys from my (fra
ternity) house started yelling and it got me pumped
up — I started coming in more and playing more
aggressively."
Patel's efforts at fighting off one match point
after the next were rewarded as he won, 4-6, 6-3, 7-

6 (7-4). Yee had an easier time closing out his
match. The two-time Ail-American won in straight
sets, 6-3, 6-4.
Devens' match, the final singles match to finish,
clinched a team victory, and doubles play was can
celled.
"The first one is always kind of tough, getting
your feet wet after being down here for so long
without playing a match," Gould said.
Cardinal 5, Tigers 2
Yesterday's match was also a fairly long battle
for the Cardinal. The team could not quite clinch
the match in singles. O'Brien again handled his
opponent easily. Mario Pacheco had no chance
against the Stanford senior, who beat him 6-2, 6-3.
"I'm just swingin' away and things are going in,"
O'Brien explained. "He was pretty good but not
unbelievable."
Cocotos, at third singles, also won in straight
sets over Janne Holtari, 7-5, 6-4. Patel fought back
again to win in three sets, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 while Yee
cruised by his competition 6-4, 7-5. "Jason's so
relaxed, it's unbelievable," O'Brien said.
Unfortunately, four wins is not enough to clinch
a match. Flanagan's 6-3, 6-0 loss to Egyptian Davis
Cupper Tamer El Sawy gave the Tigers their first
point of the match.
Flanagan had a difficult time explaining his two
consecutive singles losses. "I don't know what the
deal is," the sophomore said. "I've been playing
great for the last month."
One voice of NCAA experience, co-captain
O'Brien, thinks his early-match jitters are now in
the past: "Michael was struggling in singles, but by
now he's into the tournament and ready to go."
Devens' three-setter with Juha Pesola pushed
the match into doubles. Heat cramps at 5-5 in the
third set hindered Devens' play, and he soon lost, 7-
5, 3-6, 7-5.
However, it was Devens' match with Flanagan at
third doubles which clinched the Cardinal's victory.
Barely able to walk, Devens managed to hold serve
but do little else in doubles. Although his partner
did not serve and volley once, Flanagan covered the
court and led the pair to a 6-3, 6-2 victory.
"Michael deserves a lot of credit," Gould praised.
"He had a real good gutty performance."
O'Brien agreed: "Bobby would serve and be
standing there while Michael was covering the
whole court. He was pretty awesome."
Flanagan seemed to enjoy himself. "It was a lot
of fun. I had free reign to go everywhere," he said.
"Besides, everyone gets nervous when they play
someone who's cramping, because they think they
should definitely win."
Devens' cramps seemed to be a result of his play
ing two three-set singles matches and two sets of
doubles in two days under the blazing Georgia sun.
The rest of the team has held up fairly well in
the heat. All of their matches have started at 4:00
EST, when the air is usually beginning to cool.
The first and second doubles matches were sus
pended when Devens and Flanagan won.
In the other quarterfinals matches, top-seeded
USC defeated Kentucky, 5-3 and UCLA crushed

North Carolina, 5-2.
The day's big upset, though, was Notre Dame's
shocking 5-4 win over fourth-seeded, tournament
host Georgia. Since all three Southeastern Confer
ence teams lost in the quarters, this will be the first
year since 1986 in which the SEC does not have a
representative reach at least the semifinals.
Stanford vs. UCLA
This afternoon, the showdown between North
and South will take place at 4:00. The Cardinal and
the Bruins have played each other twice this sea
son, both winning on their home turf.
The Cardinal men are confident that they can
get by the Bruins. "I'm really happy to be playing
them away from home," Flanagan commented. "I
like their lineup — Vimal's playing real well and
Jason should have a good match against (Mark)
Bissell. I'm counting on myself to come out of my
ifole," he chuckled. "And we have really strong dou
bles teams."
O'Brien is also looking forward to his duel with
Mark Knowles, the fourth-ranked player in the
nation. "He's a shot-maker — he can make any
shot from any place on the court. I'm just going to
go out and give him a workout.
"UCLA is the team of the century if they play
well, but we have a shot if we stay in every match."

Alex O'Brien cruised through his two singles matches this weekend. O'Brien is currently ranked No. 3
in the country in singles play.
It has not been easy, but the second-seeded
men's tennis team has fought its way to today's
NCAA Championship semifinal match, where they
will face third-seeded UCLA.
Saturday, the Cardinal scrambled out of the
clutches of second-round elimination by coming
back to defeat Duke.
Yesterday in the quarterfinals, the men crushed
Louisiana State, 5-2. The seventh-seeded Tigers
defeated the Pepperdine Waves in the second round
on Saturday.
Cardinal 5, Blue Devils 1
At one point on Saturday afternoon, it appeared
that the Blue Devils, making only their second
team appearance ever at NCAAs, would sweep the
Cardinal right out of the tournament.
Although Alex O'Brien easily defeated Geoff
Grant, 6-0, 6-2, his teammates had no such luck.
Michael Flanagan lost 6-4, 6-2 in a match that head
coach Dick Gould felt "he was definitely capable of
winning."
Then, all at once, Chris Cocotos lost serve at 3-1
in the third set, putting him at 4-4, Robert Devens

lost a set and a break point, Vimal Patel was down
three match points at fifth singles and Jason Yee
was barely hanging on in the sixth singles slot.
"It very easily could've been 5-1 at that point,"
Gould said. "We were just hoping to get to dou
bles."
Cocotos, however, held serve, Devens broke to
win the second set, Patel fought off the match
points, and Yee held and broke serve. The rest,
as they say, is history.
Cocotos won, 7-5, 2-6, 6-4, in a match spotted
with controversial line calls. Cocotos was up 5-4,
30-30 when his opponent, Chris Pressley of Duke,
had a line call overruled, giving the Stanford sopho
more match point. If Cocotos had any butterflies
while playing in the such a crucial game, they cer
tainly weren't apparent.
"The first five games Chris played as well as I've
seen him play all year," Gould said. "That was a key
match."
Devens also won, 3-6, 7-5, 6-1. "I started pretty
slow," he said. "I was surprised at how nervous I
