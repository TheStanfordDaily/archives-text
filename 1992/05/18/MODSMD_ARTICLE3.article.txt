### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
Calling the next three to four
years a window of "historic"
opportunity, advisers to the Insti
tute for International Studies
urged the institute Friday to
develop concrete policies for influ
encing the shape of the post-Cold
War world.
In the concluding session of
the institute's annual meeting,
former U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz described his
"frustration that this moment
will pass" before the West can
play a role in aiding the transi
tions to democracy of countries in
Eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union.
He said the dissolution of the
Soviet Union provides a chance to
"start fresh," but instead "we're
drifting along," without clear
leadership or concerted policies.
Other members of the insti
tute's advisory council echoed
Shultz's comments Friday. Sir
Geoffrey Howe, former Chancel
lor of the Exchequer in Great
Britain, described the "historic
nature" of the decisions that will
be made in the next few years, and

said the West "needs to be adopt
ing a much more pro-active role."
The institute, he added, "can play
a part in encouraging that."
The institute is an umbrella
group formed in 1989 to forge
links with international leaders
and coordinate the efforts of Stan
ford organizations that focus on
international issues. Its advisory
council, which met Thursday and
Friday, consists of world leaders
in politics, business and academia.
Members who attended this
year's meeting include Oscar
Arias, former president of Costa
Rica; Lee Kuan Yew, senior min
ister of Singapore; Bob Hawke,
former prime minister of Aus
tralia; and Yotaro Kobayashi,
chair and CEO of Fuji Xerox.
Law Prof. Thomas Heller, the
institute's deputy director, said
yesterday that the advisers' rec
ommendations "certainly give us
a push" to direct more of the insti
tute's upcoming research toward
"the question of America's capaci
ty and will" to take a leadership
role in influencing world events.
He said the Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control,
