# Institute urged to play stronger role in shaping policies
## 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
Calling the next three to four
years a window of "historic"
opportunity, advisers to the Insti
tute for International Studies
urged the institute Friday to
develop concrete policies for influ
encing the shape of the post-Cold
War world.
In the concluding session of
the institute's annual meeting,
former U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz described his
"frustration that this moment
will pass" before the West can
play a role in aiding the transi
tions to democracy of countries in
Eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union.
He said the dissolution of the
Soviet Union provides a chance to
"start fresh," but instead "we're
drifting along," without clear
leadership or concerted policies.
Other members of the insti
tute's advisory council echoed
Shultz's comments Friday. Sir
Geoffrey Howe, former Chancel
lor of the Exchequer in Great
Britain, described the "historic
nature" of the decisions that will
be made in the next few years, and

said the West "needs to be adopt
ing a much more pro-active role."
The institute, he added, "can play
a part in encouraging that."
The institute is an umbrella
group formed in 1989 to forge
links with international leaders
and coordinate the efforts of Stan
ford organizations that focus on
international issues. Its advisory
council, which met Thursday and
Friday, consists of world leaders
in politics, business and academia.
Members who attended this
year's meeting include Oscar
Arias, former president of Costa
Rica; Lee Kuan Yew, senior min
ister of Singapore; Bob Hawke,
former prime minister of Aus
tralia; and Yotaro Kobayashi,
chair and CEO of Fuji Xerox.
Law Prof. Thomas Heller, the
institute's deputy director, said
yesterday that the advisers' rec
ommendations "certainly give us
a push" to direct more of the insti
tute's upcoming research toward
"the question of America's capaci
ty and will" to take a leadership
role in influencing world events.
He said the Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control,
one of the Stanford organizations
affiliated with the institute, has
already focused much of its
research on demilitarization and
industrial rehabilitation in the
former Soviet Union — which
will have a concrete impact on
influencing the course of democ
ratization in the former
republics.
But Howe said Friday that, as
a member of Ukraine's Council of
Economic Advisers, he hasn't felt
"any of the waves of [the insti
tute's] thought processes."
What the institute must do
better, he said, is "help manage
the marketing of know-how to
people who are in desperate need
of it — at a very elementary
level."
Heller acknowledged that the
institute must broaden the base
of its influence. One way it hopes
to do that, he said, is by "creating
some special access to leading
members of the press from
around the world, so that these
ideas come to be known at an ear
lier stage in the political process."
Council members who are
active in the press — such as
Andrew Knight, chair of the
British company that owns The
Times of London — will be enlist
ed to help the institute develop
seminars or programs that may
help in disseminating its ideas,
Heller said.
The institute must build con
nections with the press, he said,
"to create a climate of public opin
ion in which if there are political
leaders willing to introduce new
ideas, they reach more than mis
understanding and skepticism
among the public."
Political Science Prof. David
Holloway, co-director of the arms

control center, called the current
world situation "a critical period"
and said "decisions made now can
have a long-term effect."
The challenge for the institute,
Holloway said, is "to provide ideas
and concepts for policy and con
vey those to policy-makers."
A meeting set up by the arms
control center last weekend —
between members of the defense
industry in Russia and their
counterparts in the U.S. — is an

example of efforts the institute
can make to influence policy, Hol
loway said.
At the end of World War 11,
Shultz said in his remarks Friday,
there was a "burst of creativity"
that established the systems that
"we have, in a sense, been depend
ing on for the last 40 years."
A similar burst of creativity is
needed now, he said, "but the
frustrating thing is that we're not
taking advantage of it."

Calling the next three to four
years a window of "historic"
opportunity, advisers to the Insti
tute for International Studies
urged the institute Friday to
develop concrete policies for influ
encing the shape of the post-Cold
War world.
In the concluding session of
the institute's annual meeting,
former U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz described his
"frustration that this moment
will pass" before the West can
play a role in aiding the transi
tions to democracy of countries in
Eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union.
He said the dissolution of the
Soviet Union provides a chance to
"start fresh," but instead "we're
drifting along," without clear
leadership or concerted policies.
Other members of the insti
tute's advisory council echoed
Shultz's comments Friday. Sir
Geoffrey Howe, former Chancel
lor of the Exchequer in Great
Britain, described the "historic
nature" of the decisions that will
be made in the next few years, and

said the West "needs to be adopt
ing a much more pro-active role."
The institute, he added, "can play
a part in encouraging that."
The institute is an umbrella
group formed in 1989 to forge
links with international leaders
and coordinate the efforts of Stan
ford organizations that focus on
international issues. Its advisory
council, which met Thursday and
Friday, consists of world leaders
in politics, business and academia.
Members who attended this
year's meeting include Oscar
Arias, former president of Costa
Rica; Lee Kuan Yew, senior min
ister of Singapore; Bob Hawke,
former prime minister of Aus
tralia; and Yotaro Kobayashi,
chair and CEO of Fuji Xerox.
Law Prof. Thomas Heller, the
institute's deputy director, said
yesterday that the advisers' rec
ommendations "certainly give us
a push" to direct more of the insti
tute's upcoming research toward
"the question of America's capaci
ty and will" to take a leadership
role in influencing world events.
He said the Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control,
one of the Stanford organizations
affiliated with the institute, has
already focused much of its
research on demilitarization and
industrial rehabilitation in the
former Soviet Union — which
will have a concrete impact on
influencing the course of democ
ratization in the former
republics.
But Howe said Friday that, as
a member of Ukraine's Council of
Economic Advisers, he hasn't felt
"any of the waves of [the insti
tute's] thought processes."
What the institute must do
better, he said, is "help manage
the marketing of know-how to
people who are in desperate need
of it — at a very elementary
level."
Heller acknowledged that the
institute must broaden the base
of its influence. One way it hopes
to do that, he said, is by "creating
some special access to leading
members of the press from
around the world, so that these
ideas come to be known at an ear
lier stage in the political process."
Council members who are
active in the press — such as
Andrew Knight, chair of the
British company that owns The
Times of London — will be enlist
ed to help the institute develop
seminars or programs that may
help in disseminating its ideas,
Heller said.
The institute must build con
nections with the press, he said,
"to create a climate of public opin
ion in which if there are political
leaders willing to introduce new
ideas, they reach more than mis
understanding and skepticism
among the public."
Political Science Prof. David
Holloway, co-director of the arms

control center, called the current
world situation "a critical period"
and said "decisions made now can
have a long-term effect."
The challenge for the institute,
Holloway said, is "to provide ideas
and concepts for policy and con
vey those to policy-makers."
A meeting set up by the arms
control center last weekend —
between members of the defense
industry in Russia and their
counterparts in the U.S. — is an

example of efforts the institute
can make to influence policy, Hol
loway said.
At the end of World War 11,
Shultz said in his remarks Friday,
there was a "burst of creativity"
that established the systems that
"we have, in a sense, been depend
ing on for the last 40 years."
A similar burst of creativity is
needed now, he said, "but the
frustrating thing is that we're not
taking advantage of it."
