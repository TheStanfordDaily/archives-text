# The
						End of an Era

### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
rne faces said it all.
Moments after the
Stanford women's
tennis team lost to Texas
5-3 in the NCAA semifi
nals, the Cardinal players
walked off the courts
with expressions ranging
from astonishment to
grief.
Heather Willens had
tears in her eyes. Amy
Chiminello stared ahead
fixedly, face set. With shoul
ders slumped, Kristine
Kurth followed soon after.
The lone senior in the
starting lineup, Kylie

Johnson, was wide-eyed with shock.
After the loss, coach Frank Brennan praised the squad's
effort and its season. He said the team proved a lot by enter
ing the tourney seeded No. 2 after a No. 5 preseason ranking.
"Of course, I'm disappointed," Brennan said. "But the
only way to avoid losing is to not play — and we're going to
play.
"I told the girls that this has been like a fairy tale," he said
of Stanford's six-straight NCAA title streak which ended
with the Texas loss. "It has to end sooner or later. Even Babe
Ruth strikes out every once in a while."
The defeat not only broke Stanford's string of national
crowns but also a 53-home match winning streak.
A subdued Johnson said the squad doesn't focus on win
ning streaks.
"Everyone asks about the streak," she said in quiet tones.
"Which streak? The winning streak? The NCAA streak? The
home-winning streak? Or the when-the-sun-is-shining-and-

the-birds-are-dropping-on
the-courts streak?
"The media keeps
track of all of these but all
we think about is that
we're playing Texas," she
said.
And as No. 1 Flori
da beat No. 3 Texas 5-3 to
win the NCAA Champi
onships Sunday, Poruri
and Willens tried to come
to terms with the defeat.
"Hopefully, we can
recover," Poruri said. "You
take the philosophy that
these things happen. I'm
disappointed but I feel for
tunate that we won it last
year.
"We tried our hearts

out. I'm very proud of the team. We were very poised and com
posed."
Willens echoed similar sentiments but added that they
had to now focus on the singles and doubles competitions
which start today.
"I'll try to forget about the team competition — just swal
low my disappointment."
But it may take some time for the disappointment to fade
as the match was within the Cardinal's grasp. With the con
test deadlocked at 3-3 after singles, doubles was the deciding
factor. There the Longhorns had the edge. Their top pair of
Susan Gilchrist and Vickie Paynter are ranked No. 1 in the
nation.
Doubles has been Stanford's weakness this season. At
the National Team Indoors final in March, the Cardinal
entered doubles having split singles with No. 1 Florida. The
