# The 						End of an Era

### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
rne faces said it all.
Moments after the
Stanford women's
tennis team lost to Texas
5-3 in the NCAA semifi
nals, the Cardinal players
walked off the courts
with expressions ranging
from astonishment to
grief.
Heather Willens had
tears in her eyes. Amy
Chiminello stared ahead
fixedly, face set. With shoul
ders slumped, Kristine
Kurth followed soon after.
The lone senior in the
starting lineup, Kylie

Johnson, was wide-eyed with shock.
After the loss, coach Frank Brennan praised the squad's
effort and its season. He said the team proved a lot by enter
ing the tourney seeded No. 2 after a No. 5 preseason ranking.
"Of course, I'm disappointed," Brennan said. "But the
only way to avoid losing is to not play — and we're going to
play.
"I told the girls that this has been like a fairy tale," he said
of Stanford's six-straight NCAA title streak which ended
with the Texas loss. "It has to end sooner or later. Even Babe
Ruth strikes out every once in a while."
The defeat not only broke Stanford's string of national
crowns but also a 53-home match winning streak.
A subdued Johnson said the squad doesn't focus on win
ning streaks.
"Everyone asks about the streak," she said in quiet tones.
"Which streak? The winning streak? The NCAA streak? The
home-winning streak? Or the when-the-sun-is-shining-and-

the-birds-are-dropping-on
the-courts streak?
"The media keeps
track of all of these but all
we think about is that
we're playing Texas," she
said.
And as No. 1 Flori
da beat No. 3 Texas 5-3 to
win the NCAA Champi
onships Sunday, Poruri
and Willens tried to come
to terms with the defeat.
"Hopefully, we can
recover," Poruri said. "You
take the philosophy that
these things happen. I'm
disappointed but I feel for
tunate that we won it last
year.
"We tried our hearts

out. I'm very proud of the team. We were very poised and com
posed."
Willens echoed similar sentiments but added that they
had to now focus on the singles and doubles competitions
which start today.
"I'll try to forget about the team competition — just swal
low my disappointment."
But it may take some time for the disappointment to fade
as the match was within the Cardinal's grasp. With the con
test deadlocked at 3-3 after singles, doubles was the deciding
factor. There the Longhorns had the edge. Their top pair of
Susan Gilchrist and Vickie Paynter are ranked No. 1 in the
nation.
Doubles has been Stanford's weakness this season. At
the National Team Indoors final in March, the Cardinal
entered doubles having split singles with No. 1 Florida. The

Gators captured wins at No. 1 and 2 doubles
to clinch the match.
Of course, Brennan has been forced to
juggle the tandems because of injuries.
Originally, Kurth and freshman Kim Shas
by were one of the Cardinal's top pairs. But
when a torn knee ligament forced Shasby to
sit out the season, Kurth and Chiminello
teamed at No. 3.
The No. 2 pair of Johnson and Wood
house has faired slightly better. The duo
was set at the beginning of the year but was
slowed by Johnson's back injury and Wood
house's two-and-a-half month layoff due to
a hamstring tear.
So with only Willens and Poruri having
played together all season, Stanford entered
the pivotal three matches.
Brennan's message to the team was sim
ple — take it to the Longhorns.

"I told them to play aggressive, coura
geous doubles," he said. We have to be the
ones to put away the overheads, not throw
up the lobs."
However, all three contests started badly
for the Cardinal. Within minutes, Johnson
and Woodhouse dropped the first set 6-1.
Despite solid play, Willens and Poruri fell a
set behind Gilchrist and Paynter.
The only match that Stanford was up in
was the No. 3 clash, which Kurth and
Chiminello lead 3-1 against Ashley Johnson
and Jackie Moe.
Even that turned sour as the Cardinal
pair couldn't sustain the lead and lost the
set 6-4.
The crisis point arrived as Johnson and
Woodhouse made a quick exit after dropping
a 6-2 second set.
Johnson said the duo's lack of recent
playing time was just one factor in the
defeat. Woodhouse agreed.

"We had played together a lot early in the
season," she said. "I think that would have
stood us in good stead if we had been able to
get a foothold in the match.
"We tried really hard but we just weren't
flowing. They were hitting it where we
weren't expecting. We had opportunities but
we didn't pick the right shots and we missed
some poaches."
But Willens and Poruri were coming
back on court No. 1. Timely returns from
Willens and sparkling volleys from Poruri
propelled the pair over the Longhorns in the
second set.
As the Cardinal's top duo was building
momentum going into the third set, Kurth
and Chiminello were fading rapidly in the
third match.
By the time the score reached 4-0 in favor
of Texas in the second set, Brennan knew

Stanford's chances were growing
dim.
"Until it was 4-0, I really
thought we were going to win it,"
he said
However, Texas kept pressing
and won the march, 6-4, 6-0. As
the Texas team mobbed its No. 3

tandem, the Stanford players
hugged and consoled each other.
The Longhorn victory was set
up bv their three wins in singles
The battle of the day was the
No. 1 single? match, pitting No. 3
Willens against. No. 14 Susan
Gilchrist
Gilchrist, tabbed "Big Sue" by
her teammates, was just that.

The lanky left hander broke Wil
low early and used an overpow
ering serve and volley gaine to
take the fint set, 6-4.
But that's not to say Willens
played badly. Tine and time
again the Stanford junior pinned
the return at Gilchrist's feet,
only to have the Longharn dig it
out Car a drop volley winner.

Willens came back in the sec
ond and found her range on the
passing shots. Gilchrist would
chip a deep approach shot to the
corner and Willens would nail a
down the line forehand — just
out of Gilchrist's reach and just
inside the line.
When Willens was able to keep
the Longhora back, she stepped
up and put more pressure on
Gilchrist's suspect ground
strokes.
But Gilchrist responded. Hav
ing worked on her topspin back
hand this season, she cranked
winners in key situations.
By the third set the capacity
crowd was behind Willens and
the Cardinal had the momentum.
At one point, Gilchrist had hit a
short sit-up volley and Willens
ran it down. While nearly every
one in the stadium — including
Gilchrist — expected Willens to
go crosscourt, she whipped a
hark hand down the line winner.
On the strength of passing shots
like these, Willens built a 5-3
lead.
But Big Sue wasn't going
down without a fight. She clawed
back to 5-4 and saved one match
point with an acrobatic diving
forehand volley which barely
dropped over the net.
As it turned out, that was the
only match point Willens got.
The Texas junior dominated the
net and made several more
miraculous shots to take the last
four games and the match 6-4, 3-
6, 7-5.
After the contest, Brennan
likened it to a heavyweight prize
fight. Willens called it a dead
heat.
"There was no difference,'" she
said. "It was just luck. It was
dead even."
For Willens, the match

marked the third straight day
she's tasted defeat. She lost to
Caifarnia's Lisa Albano in Stan
ford's 5-2 win Saturday. On Fri
day. Mississippi's Palo ma Col
lantes had the Cardinal's num
ber.
Wiliens said she tried not to
think previous losses when she
was playing Gilchrist
"I was trying not to think,"
Wiliens said. "If you think,
you're f—ed. I concentrated on
hitting out and I think I did
that."
The match proved critical as it
narrowed Stanford's lead to 3-2.
Shortly after, Texas tied it up
when Longhorn Jackie Moe shut
the door on Kristine Kurth 2-6,
6-3,6-2.
The Cardinal sophomore
blamed the loss on her lack of
offense in the later sets.
"In the first set I dictated the
points and I played aggressively,*'
Kurth said. "In the second, she
raised the level of her game and I
played really tentative. I just
pushed the ball.
"In the third, I wasn't step
ping into the ball and concentrat
ing. I played right into her hands.
She likes to set up and hit the
crosscourt angles and I let her. I
should have made her move."
The two late losses erased an
early Stanford lead.
Johnson and Woodhouse
started the Cardinal off with two
straight-set victories. Johnson
pasted Kelly Pace 6-1, 6-1.
Woodhouse, rebounding from a
three-set loss to Cal's Veena
Prabhakar Friday, crushed
Texas' Ashley Johnson 6-0, 6-3.
Coming off a hamstring injury,
the Stanford sophomore benefit
ed from Johnson's aggressive
game.
"She hits hard and comes in a

lot, which I-like," Woodhouse
said. -I could feed off her pace
and the points were shorter."
split. Stanford's fortunes took a
turn for the wane when No. 21
Vickie Paynter upset No. 4
Lara Poruri, £4, 7-6 (7-0).
"It was a bad day for me,"
Poruri said. "Shedidnt play fan
tastic or anything — just solid
tennis,"
The off day was a rarity for
Poruri during the regular season.
Her only other kiss was to Flori
da's Holly Lloyd in the final of
the National Indoor Team Cham
pionships in March.
"It was one of the few bad days
I had this year and it was during
NCAAs," Poruri said. "Maybe, it
was the pressure. I feel like I
really let the team down."
But in anglwt —fcch.
Amy Chiminello gutted out a
marathon victory after dropping
the first set 6-1. Chiminello,
ranked No. 71 in the country,
beat No. 57 Carta Cossa by a
score of 1-6, 6-2, 6-2.
The win ended a stellar fresh
man campaign for Chiminello
who racked up a 22-3 dual match
record while playing No. 4
through No. 6 dots during the
season.
Chiminello's comeback set the
stage for the conclusion of
Gilchrist and Wiliens' epic battle.
The Cardinal reached the
semifinals by heating California
5-2 Friday. Wiliens and Poruri
clinched the win with a 6-1, 6-1
victory over Lisa Albano and
Keirsten Alley. Poruri, Johnson
and Kurth notched straight-set
wins while Chiminello came
from behind to beat Lisa Parks
in three sets. Woodhouse lost a
three-setter to Veena Prab
hakar.

up bv their three wins in singles
The battle of the day was the
No. 1 single? match, pitting No. 3
Willens against. No. 14 Susan
Gilchrist
Gilchrist, tabbed "Big Sue" by
her teammates, was just that.

The lanky left hander broke Wil
low early and used an overpow
ering serve and volley gaine to
take the fint set, 6-4.
But that's not to say Willens
played badly. Tine and time
again the Stanford junior pinned
the return at Gilchrist's feet,
only to have the Longharn dig it
out Car a drop volley winner.

Willens came back in the sec
ond and found her range on the
passing shots. Gilchrist would
chip a deep approach shot to the
corner and Willens would nail a
down the line forehand — just
out of Gilchrist's reach and just
inside the line.
When Willens was able to keep
the Longhora back, she stepped
up and put more pressure on
Gilchrist's suspect ground
strokes.
But Gilchrist responded. Hav
ing worked on her topspin back
hand this season, she cranked
winners in key situations.
By the third set the capacity
crowd was behind Willens and
the Cardinal had the momentum.
At one point, Gilchrist had hit a
short sit-up volley and Willens
ran it down. While nearly every
one in the stadium — including
Gilchrist — expected Willens to
go crosscourt, she whipped a
hark hand down the line winner.
On the strength of passing shots
like these, Willens built a 5-3
lead.
But Big Sue wasn't going
down without a fight. She clawed
back to 5-4 and saved one match
point with an acrobatic diving
forehand volley which barely
dropped over the net.
As it turned out, that was the
only match point Willens got.
The Texas junior dominated the
net and made several more
miraculous shots to take the last
four games and the match 6-4, 3-
6, 7-5.
After the contest, Brennan
likened it to a heavyweight prize
fight. Willens called it a dead
heat.
"There was no difference,'" she
said. "It was just luck. It was
dead even."
For Willens, the match

marked the third straight day
she's tasted defeat. She lost to
Caifarnia's Lisa Albano in Stan
ford's 5-2 win Saturday. On Fri
day. Mississippi's Palo ma Col
lantes had the Cardinal's num
ber.
Wiliens said she tried not to
think previous losses when she
was playing Gilchrist
"I was trying not to think,"
Wiliens said. "If you think,
you're f—ed. I concentrated on
hitting out and I think I did
that."
The match proved critical as it
narrowed Stanford's lead to 3-2.
Shortly after, Texas tied it up
when Longhorn Jackie Moe shut
the door on Kristine Kurth 2-6,
6-3,6-2.
The Cardinal sophomore
blamed the loss on her lack of
offense in the later sets.
"In the first set I dictated the
points and I played aggressively,*'
Kurth said. "In the second, she
raised the level of her game and I
played really tentative. I just
pushed the ball.
"In the third, I wasn't step
ping into the ball and concentrat
ing. I played right into her hands.
She likes to set up and hit the
crosscourt angles and I let her. I
should have made her move."
The two late losses erased an
early Stanford lead.
Johnson and Woodhouse
started the Cardinal off with two
straight-set victories. Johnson
pasted Kelly Pace 6-1, 6-1.
Woodhouse, rebounding from a
three-set loss to Cal's Veena
Prabhakar Friday, crushed
Texas' Ashley Johnson 6-0, 6-3.

The off day was a rarity for

Amy Chiminello gutted out a
marathon victory after dropping
the first set 6-1. Chiminello,
ranked No. 71 in the country,
beat No. 57 Carta Cossa by a

The win ended a stellar fresh
man campaign for Chiminello
who racked up a 22-3 dual match
record while playing No. 4
through No. 6 dots during the
season.
Chiminello's comeback set the
stage for the conclusion of
Gilchrist and Wiliens' epic battle.

rne faces said it all.
Moments after the
Stanford women's
tennis team lost to Texas
5-3 in the NCAA semifi
nals, the Cardinal players
walked off the courts
with expressions ranging
from astonishment to
grief.
Heather Willens had
tears in her eyes. Amy
Chiminello stared ahead
fixedly, face set. With shoul
ders slumped, Kristine
Kurth followed soon after.
The lone senior in the
starting lineup, Kylie

Johnson, was wide-eyed with shock.
After the loss, coach Frank Brennan praised the squad's
effort and its season. He said the team proved a lot by enter
ing the tourney seeded No. 2 after a No. 5 preseason ranking.
"Of course, I'm disappointed," Brennan said. "But the
only way to avoid losing is to not play — and we're going to
play.
"I told the girls that this has been like a fairy tale," he said
of Stanford's six-straight NCAA title streak which ended
with the Texas loss. "It has to end sooner or later. Even Babe
Ruth strikes out every once in a while."
The defeat not only broke Stanford's string of national
crowns but also a 53-home match winning streak.
A subdued Johnson said the squad doesn't focus on win
ning streaks.
"Everyone asks about the streak," she said in quiet tones.
"Which streak? The winning streak? The NCAA streak? The
home-winning streak? Or the when-the-sun-is-shining-and-

the-birds-are-dropping-on
the-courts streak?
"The media keeps
track of all of these but all
we think about is that
we're playing Texas," she
said.
And as No. 1 Flori
da beat No. 3 Texas 5-3 to
win the NCAA Champi
onships Sunday, Poruri
and Willens tried to come
to terms with the defeat.
"Hopefully, we can
recover," Poruri said. "You
take the philosophy that
these things happen. I'm
disappointed but I feel for
tunate that we won it last
year.
"We tried our hearts

out. I'm very proud of the team. We were very poised and com
posed."
Willens echoed similar sentiments but added that they
had to now focus on the singles and doubles competitions
which start today.
"I'll try to forget about the team competition — just swal
low my disappointment."
But it may take some time for the disappointment to fade
as the match was within the Cardinal's grasp. With the con
test deadlocked at 3-3 after singles, doubles was the deciding
factor. There the Longhorns had the edge. Their top pair of
Susan Gilchrist and Vickie Paynter are ranked No. 1 in the
nation.
Doubles has been Stanford's weakness this season. At
the National Team Indoors final in March, the Cardinal
entered doubles having split singles with No. 1 Florida. The

Gators captured wins at No. 1 and 2 doubles
to clinch the match.
Of course, Brennan has been forced to
juggle the tandems because of injuries.
Originally, Kurth and freshman Kim Shas
by were one of the Cardinal's top pairs. But
when a torn knee ligament forced Shasby to
sit out the season, Kurth and Chiminello
teamed at No. 3.
The No. 2 pair of Johnson and Wood
house has faired slightly better. The duo
was set at the beginning of the year but was
slowed by Johnson's back injury and Wood
house's two-and-a-half month layoff due to
a hamstring tear.
So with only Willens and Poruri having
played together all season, Stanford entered
the pivotal three matches.
Brennan's message to the team was sim
ple — take it to the Longhorns.

"I told them to play aggressive, coura
geous doubles," he said. We have to be the
ones to put away the overheads, not throw
up the lobs."
However, all three contests started badly
for the Cardinal. Within minutes, Johnson
and Woodhouse dropped the first set 6-1.
Despite solid play, Willens and Poruri fell a
set behind Gilchrist and Paynter.
The only match that Stanford was up in
was the No. 3 clash, which Kurth and
Chiminello lead 3-1 against Ashley Johnson
and Jackie Moe.
Even that turned sour as the Cardinal
pair couldn't sustain the lead and lost the
set 6-4.
The crisis point arrived as Johnson and
Woodhouse made a quick exit after dropping
a 6-2 second set.
Johnson said the duo's lack of recent
playing time was just one factor in the
defeat. Woodhouse agreed.

"We had played together a lot early in the
season," she said. "I think that would have
stood us in good stead if we had been able to
get a foothold in the match.
"We tried really hard but we just weren't
flowing. They were hitting it where we
weren't expecting. We had opportunities but
we didn't pick the right shots and we missed
some poaches."
But Willens and Poruri were coming
back on court No. 1. Timely returns from
Willens and sparkling volleys from Poruri
propelled the pair over the Longhorns in the
second set.
As the Cardinal's top duo was building
momentum going into the third set, Kurth
and Chiminello were fading rapidly in the
third match.
By the time the score reached 4-0 in favor
of Texas in the second set, Brennan knew

Stanford's chances were growing
dim.
"Until it was 4-0, I really
thought we were going to win it,"
he said
However, Texas kept pressing
and won the march, 6-4, 6-0. As
the Texas team mobbed its No. 3

tandem, the Stanford players
hugged and consoled each other.

tennis team lost to Texas
5-3 in the NCAA semifi
nals, the Cardinal players
walked off the courts
with expressions ranging
from astonishment to
grief.
Heather Willens had
tears in her eyes. Amy
Chiminello stared ahead
fixedly, face set. With shoul
ders slumped, Kristine
Kurth followed soon after.
The lone senior in the
starting lineup, Kylie

Johnson, was wide-eyed with shock.
After the loss, coach Frank Brennan praised the squad's
effort and its season. He said the team proved a lot by enter
ing the tourney seeded No. 2 after a No. 5 preseason ranking.
"Of course, I'm disappointed," Brennan said. "But the
only way to avoid losing is to not play — and we're going to
play.
"I told the girls that this has been like a fairy tale," he said
of Stanford's six-straight NCAA title streak which ended
with the Texas loss. "It has to end sooner or later. Even Babe
Ruth strikes out every once in a while."
The defeat not only broke Stanford's string of national
crowns but also a 53-home match winning streak.
A subdued Johnson said the squad doesn't focus on win
ning streaks.
"Everyone asks about the streak," she said in quiet tones.
"Which streak? The winning streak? The NCAA streak? The
home-winning streak? Or the when-the-sun-is-shining-and-

the-birds-are-dropping-on
the-courts streak?
"The media keeps
track of all of these but all
we think about is that
we're playing Texas," she
said.
And as No. 1 Flori
da beat No. 3 Texas 5-3 to
win the NCAA Champi
onships Sunday, Poruri
and Willens tried to come
to terms with the defeat.
"Hopefully, we can
recover," Poruri said. "You
take the philosophy that
these things happen. I'm
disappointed but I feel for
tunate that we won it last
year.
"We tried our hearts

out. I'm very proud of the team. We were very poised and com
posed."
Willens echoed similar sentiments but added that they
had to now focus on the singles and doubles competitions
which start today.
"I'll try to forget about the team competition — just swal
low my disappointment."
But it may take some time for the disappointment to fade
as the match was within the Cardinal's grasp. With the con
test deadlocked at 3-3 after singles, doubles was the deciding
factor. There the Longhorns had the edge. Their top pair of
Susan Gilchrist and Vickie Paynter are ranked No. 1 in the
nation.
Doubles has been Stanford's weakness this season. At
the National Team Indoors final in March, the Cardinal
entered doubles having split singles with No. 1 Florida. The

Gators captured wins at No. 1 and 2 doubles
to clinch the match.
Of course, Brennan has been forced to
juggle the tandems because of injuries.
Originally, Kurth and freshman Kim Shas
by were one of the Cardinal's top pairs. But
when a torn knee ligament forced Shasby to
sit out the season, Kurth and Chiminello
teamed at No. 3.
The No. 2 pair of Johnson and Wood
house has faired slightly better. The duo
was set at the beginning of the year but was
slowed by Johnson's back injury and Wood
house's two-and-a-half month layoff due to
a hamstring tear.
So with only Willens and Poruri having
played together all season, Stanford entered
the pivotal three matches.
Brennan's message to the team was sim
ple — take it to the Longhorns.

"I told them to play aggressive, coura
geous doubles," he said. We have to be the
ones to put away the overheads, not throw
up the lobs."
However, all three contests started badly
for the Cardinal. Within minutes, Johnson
and Woodhouse dropped the first set 6-1.
Despite solid play, Willens and Poruri fell a
set behind Gilchrist and Paynter.
The only match that Stanford was up in
was the No. 3 clash, which Kurth and
Chiminello lead 3-1 against Ashley Johnson
and Jackie Moe.
Even that turned sour as the Cardinal
pair couldn't sustain the lead and lost the
set 6-4.
The crisis point arrived as Johnson and
Woodhouse made a quick exit after dropping
a 6-2 second set.
Johnson said the duo's lack of recent
playing time was just one factor in the
defeat. Woodhouse agreed.

"We had played together a lot early in the
season," she said. "I think that would have
stood us in good stead if we had been able to
get a foothold in the match.
"We tried really hard but we just weren't
flowing. They were hitting it where we
weren't expecting. We had opportunities but
we didn't pick the right shots and we missed
some poaches."
But Willens and Poruri were coming
back on court No. 1. Timely returns from
Willens and sparkling volleys from Poruri
propelled the pair over the Longhorns in the
second set.
As the Cardinal's top duo was building
momentum going into the third set, Kurth
and Chiminello were fading rapidly in the
third match.
By the time the score reached 4-0 in favor
of Texas in the second set, Brennan knew

Stanford's chances were growing
dim.
"Until it was 4-0, I really
thought we were going to win it,"
he said
However, Texas kept pressing
and won the march, 6-4, 6-0. As
the Texas team mobbed its No. 3

tandem, the Stanford players
hugged and consoled each other.
The Longhorn victory was set
up bv their three wins in singles
The battle of the day was the
No. 1 single? match, pitting No. 3
Willens against. No. 14 Susan
Gilchrist
Gilchrist, tabbed "Big Sue" by
her teammates, was just that.

The lanky left hander broke Wil
low early and used an overpow
ering serve and volley gaine to
take the fint set, 6-4.
But that's not to say Willens
played badly. Tine and time
again the Stanford junior pinned
the return at Gilchrist's feet,
only to have the Longharn dig it
out Car a drop volley winner.

Willens came back in the sec
ond and found her range on the
passing shots. Gilchrist would
chip a deep approach shot to the
corner and Willens would nail a
down the line forehand — just
out of Gilchrist's reach and just
inside the line.
When Willens was able to keep
the Longhora back, she stepped
up and put more pressure on
Gilchrist's suspect ground
strokes.
But Gilchrist responded. Hav
ing worked on her topspin back
hand this season, she cranked
winners in key situations.
By the third set the capacity
crowd was behind Willens and
the Cardinal had the momentum.
At one point, Gilchrist had hit a
short sit-up volley and Willens
ran it down. While nearly every
one in the stadium — including
Gilchrist — expected Willens to
go crosscourt, she whipped a
hark hand down the line winner.
On the strength of passing shots
like these, Willens built a 5-3
lead.
But Big Sue wasn't going
down without a fight. She clawed
back to 5-4 and saved one match
point with an acrobatic diving
forehand volley which barely
dropped over the net.
As it turned out, that was the
only match point Willens got.
The Texas junior dominated the
net and made several more
miraculous shots to take the last
four games and the match 6-4, 3-
6, 7-5.
After the contest, Brennan
likened it to a heavyweight prize
fight. Willens called it a dead
heat.
"There was no difference,'" she
said. "It was just luck. It was
dead even."
For Willens, the match

marked the third straight day
she's tasted defeat. She lost to
Caifarnia's Lisa Albano in Stan
ford's 5-2 win Saturday. On Fri
day. Mississippi's Palo ma Col
lantes had the Cardinal's num
ber.
Wiliens said she tried not to
think previous losses when she
was playing Gilchrist
"I was trying not to think,"
Wiliens said. "If you think,
you're f—ed. I concentrated on
hitting out and I think I did
that."
The match proved critical as it
narrowed Stanford's lead to 3-2.
Shortly after, Texas tied it up
when Longhorn Jackie Moe shut
the door on Kristine Kurth 2-6,
6-3,6-2.
The Cardinal sophomore
blamed the loss on her lack of
offense in the later sets.
"In the first set I dictated the
points and I played aggressively,*'
Kurth said. "In the second, she
raised the level of her game and I
played really tentative. I just
pushed the ball.
"In the third, I wasn't step
ping into the ball and concentrat
ing. I played right into her hands.
She likes to set up and hit the
crosscourt angles and I let her. I
should have made her move."
The two late losses erased an
early Stanford lead.
Johnson and Woodhouse
started the Cardinal off with two
straight-set victories. Johnson
pasted Kelly Pace 6-1, 6-1.
Woodhouse, rebounding from a
three-set loss to Cal's Veena
Prabhakar Friday, crushed
Texas' Ashley Johnson 6-0, 6-3.
Coming off a hamstring injury,
the Stanford sophomore benefit
ed from Johnson's aggressive
game.
"She hits hard and comes in a

lot, which I-like," Woodhouse
said. -I could feed off her pace
and the points were shorter."
split. Stanford's fortunes took a
turn for the wane when No. 21
Vickie Paynter upset No. 4
Lara Poruri, £4, 7-6 (7-0).
"It was a bad day for me,"
Poruri said. "Shedidnt play fan
tastic or anything — just solid
tennis,"
The off day was a rarity for
Poruri during the regular season.
Her only other kiss was to Flori
da's Holly Lloyd in the final of
the National Indoor Team Cham
pionships in March.
"It was one of the few bad days
I had this year and it was during
NCAAs," Poruri said. "Maybe, it
was the pressure. I feel like I
really let the team down."
But in anglwt —fcch.
Amy Chiminello gutted out a
marathon victory after dropping
the first set 6-1. Chiminello,
ranked No. 71 in the country,
beat No. 57 Carta Cossa by a
score of 1-6, 6-2, 6-2.
The win ended a stellar fresh
man campaign for Chiminello
who racked up a 22-3 dual match
record while playing No. 4
through No. 6 dots during the
season.
Chiminello's comeback set the
stage for the conclusion of
Gilchrist and Wiliens' epic battle.
The Cardinal reached the
semifinals by heating California
5-2 Friday. Wiliens and Poruri
clinched the win with a 6-1, 6-1
victory over Lisa Albano and
Keirsten Alley. Poruri, Johnson
and Kurth notched straight-set
wins while Chiminello came
from behind to beat Lisa Parks
in three sets. Woodhouse lost a
three-setter to Veena Prab

Willens against. No. 14 Susan
Gilchrist
Gilchrist, tabbed "Big Sue" by
her teammates, was just that.

The lanky left hander broke Wil
low early and used an overpow
ering serve and volley gaine to
take the fint set, 6-4.
But that's not to say Willens
played badly. Tine and time
again the Stanford junior pinned
the return at Gilchrist's feet,
only to have the Longharn dig it
out Car a drop volley winner.

Willens came back in the sec
ond and found her range on the
passing shots. Gilchrist would
chip a deep approach shot to the
corner and Willens would nail a
down the line forehand — just
out of Gilchrist's reach and just
inside the line.
When Willens was able to keep
the Longhora back, she stepped
up and put more pressure on
Gilchrist's suspect ground
strokes.
But Gilchrist responded. Hav
ing worked on her topspin back
hand this season, she cranked
winners in key situations.
By the third set the capacity
crowd was behind Willens and
the Cardinal had the momentum.
At one point, Gilchrist had hit a
short sit-up volley and Willens
ran it down. While nearly every
one in the stadium — including
Gilchrist — expected Willens to
go crosscourt, she whipped a
hark hand down the line winner.
On the strength of passing shots
like these, Willens built a 5-3
lead.
But Big Sue wasn't going
down without a fight. She clawed
back to 5-4 and saved one match
point with an acrobatic diving
forehand volley which barely
dropped over the net.
As it turned out, that was the
only match point Willens got.
The Texas junior dominated the
net and made several more
miraculous shots to take the last
four games and the match 6-4, 3-
6, 7-5.
After the contest, Brennan
likened it to a heavyweight prize
fight. Willens called it a dead
heat.
"There was no difference,'" she
said. "It was just luck. It was
dead even."
For Willens, the match

marked the third straight day
she's tasted defeat. She lost to
Caifarnia's Lisa Albano in Stan
ford's 5-2 win Saturday. On Fri
day. Mississippi's Palo ma Col
lantes had the Cardinal's num
ber.
Wiliens said she tried not to
think previous losses when she
was playing Gilchrist
"I was trying not to think,"
Wiliens said. "If you think,
you're f—ed. I concentrated on
hitting out and I think I did
that."
The match proved critical as it
narrowed Stanford's lead to 3-2.
Shortly after, Texas tied it up
when Longhorn Jackie Moe shut
the door on Kristine Kurth 2-6,
6-3,6-2.
The Cardinal sophomore
blamed the loss on her lack of
offense in the later sets.
"In the first set I dictated the
points and I played aggressively,*'
Kurth said. "In the second, she
raised the level of her game and I
played really tentative. I just
pushed the ball.
"In the third, I wasn't step
ping into the ball and concentrat
ing. I played right into her hands.
She likes to set up and hit the
crosscourt angles and I let her. I
should have made her move."
The two late losses erased an
early Stanford lead.
Johnson and Woodhouse
started the Cardinal off with two
straight-set victories. Johnson
pasted Kelly Pace 6-1, 6-1.
Woodhouse, rebounding from a
three-set loss to Cal's Veena
Prabhakar Friday, crushed
Texas' Ashley Johnson 6-0, 6-3.
Coming off a hamstring injury,
the Stanford sophomore benefit
ed from Johnson's aggressive
game.
"She hits hard and comes in a

lot, which I-like," Woodhouse
said. -I could feed off her pace
and the points were shorter."
split. Stanford's fortunes took a
turn for the wane when No. 21
Vickie Paynter upset No. 4
Lara Poruri, £4, 7-6 (7-0).
"It was a bad day for me,"
Poruri said. "Shedidnt play fan
tastic or anything — just solid
tennis,"
The off day was a rarity for
Poruri during the regular season.
Her only other kiss was to Flori
da's Holly Lloyd in the final of
the National Indoor Team Cham
pionships in March.
"It was one of the few bad days
I had this year and it was during
NCAAs," Poruri said. "Maybe, it
was the pressure. I feel like I
really let the team down."
But in anglwt —fcch.
Amy Chiminello gutted out a
marathon victory after dropping
the first set 6-1. Chiminello,
ranked No. 71 in the country,
beat No. 57 Carta Cossa by a
score of 1-6, 6-2, 6-2.
The win ended a stellar fresh
man campaign for Chiminello
who racked up a 22-3 dual match
record while playing No. 4
through No. 6 dots during the
season.
Chiminello's comeback set the
stage for the conclusion of
Gilchrist and Wiliens' epic battle.
The Cardinal reached the
semifinals by heating California
5-2 Friday. Wiliens and Poruri
clinched the win with a 6-1, 6-1
victory over Lisa Albano and
Keirsten Alley. Poruri, Johnson
and Kurth notched straight-set
wins while Chiminello came
from behind to beat Lisa Parks
in three sets. Woodhouse lost a
three-setter to Veena Prab
hakar.
