# Clark takes high jump at Modesto
## Popejoy nears Olympic qualification with 209'3" toss 
### Nick Clements Staff writer 
With a week to go before the Pacific
10 Conference Championships, Stan
ford Track and Field sent some of its
athletes to the Modesto Relays this
weekend to tune up. The meet was a
treat for fans and competitors alike as
some of the most prominent athletes in
the world turned in top-notch perfor
mances in preparation for the Olympic
Trials.
Sophomore Dave Popejoy turned in
his best performance of his life in the
hammer throw after having been in
somewhat of a rut for the past few
weeks. His throw of 209 feet, three
inches is only two inches away from the
qualifying standard for the Olympic
Trials. It also enabled Popejoy to retake
the Pac-10 lead in the event. Popejoy
wound up making the finals and placing
sixth in one of the most competitive
hammer throw competitions in world.
Two men topped 260 feet in Popejoy's
event, among them NCAA record-hold
er Ken Flax.
Popejoy started out the season with a
bang when he automatically qualified
very early on, but has had difficulty in
continuing his success. He failed to hit
200 feet against California two weeks
ago and was in danger of faltering in his
quest to make the Olympic Trials up
until Saturday.
"It's nice to get in that kind of a
groove before the championships," said
Stanford assistant coach Scott Chisam.
Toby Norwood also came through in
the hammer with a throw of 190 feet.
Norwood, a sophomore who also is on
the football team, figures to contribute
to a formidable 1-2 Cardinal punch in
the future.
Freshman Travis Clark continued to
excel in the high jump as he won the
open event with a leap of six feet, 11 and

3/4 inches. He should be a major factor
in Pac-10 Championships next weekend
in the event.
"He's winning the close ones and
that's not accidental," Chisam said.
"He's certainly years ahead of what
you'd consider normal freshman matu
rity."
Junior Susan Helfter turned in an
800 meter run of 2:09.1 seconds.
"In my opinion that was the best
she's looked since a couple races she
won in January," said Chisam.
Also on hand for the competition
were world long-jump record holder
Mike Powell, who broke 29 feet again
with a wind-aided jump of 29 feet, two
and 1/2 inches, and former 100-meter
dash champion Leroy Burrell, who
came in second with sub-10 second
sprint.
Some of Stanford's star athletes
stayed home in order to avoid injury
before Pac-10 Championships. Seniors
Chryste Gaines and Jackie Edwards,
who figure to score big in Pac-10 and
NCAA Championships, have already
qualified for the NCAA Championships
in their events and weren't in need of a
tune-up meet.
Gaines is on top of the track world
right now after her 10.90 run in the
100-meters ranked her second in the
world for this year.
"The week before Pac-10's anything
can happen," said Chisam, who also is
resting middle-distance runners Dave
Scudamore, Fred Carter, and Gary
Stolz. Chisam said that the middle dis
tance runners, because they have been
training so hard, are finding it difficult
to rest so soon before the meet.
"There have been a lot of arguments
back and forth between them so I know
I'm resting them right," Chisam said.
"They actually start going through
physiological withdrawal. They start
getting addicted to hard exercise."

With appearance fees for world-cal
iber athletes rapidly rising, Chisam said
a star-studded meet like Modesto is
finding it more and more difficult to
stay in the black financially.
"There was a time when with
$20,000 you could get 20 athletes,"
Chisam said. "Now that might get one
athlete."
For athletes like Popejoy and
Helfter, Chisam said the meet was a
much needed confidence-builder.
"This was probably exactly what the
doctor ordered to go into Pac-10 Cham
pionships," he said.

the hammer with a throw of 190 feet.
Norwood, a sophomore who also is on
the football team, figures to contribute
to a formidable 1-2 Cardinal punch in
the future.
Freshman Travis Clark continued to
excel in the high jump as he won the
open event with a leap of six feet, 11 and

3/4 inches. He should be a major factor
in Pac-10 Championships next weekend
in the event.
"He's winning the close ones and
that's not accidental," Chisam said.
"He's certainly years ahead of what
you'd consider normal freshman matu
rity."
Junior Susan Helfter turned in an
800 meter run of 2:09.1 seconds.
"In my opinion that was the best
she's looked since a couple races she
won in January," said Chisam.
Also on hand for the competition
were world long-jump record holder
Mike Powell, who broke 29 feet again
with a wind-aided jump of 29 feet, two
and 1/2 inches, and former 100-meter
dash champion Leroy Burrell, who
came in second with sub-10 second
sprint.
Some of Stanford's star athletes
stayed home in order to avoid injury
before Pac-10 Championships. Seniors
Chryste Gaines and Jackie Edwards,
who figure to score big in Pac-10 and
NCAA Championships, have already
qualified for the NCAA Championships
in their events and weren't in need of a
tune-up meet.
Gaines is on top of the track world
right now after her 10.90 run in the
100-meters ranked her second in the
world for this year.
"The week before Pac-10's anything
can happen," said Chisam, who also is
resting middle-distance runners Dave
Scudamore, Fred Carter, and Gary
Stolz. Chisam said that the middle dis
tance runners, because they have been
training so hard, are finding it difficult
to rest so soon before the meet.
"There have been a lot of arguments
back and forth between them so I know
I'm resting them right," Chisam said.
"They actually start going through
physiological withdrawal. They start
getting addicted to hard exercise."

With appearance fees for world-cal
iber athletes rapidly rising, Chisam said
a star-studded meet like Modesto is
finding it more and more difficult to
stay in the black financially.
"There was a time when with
$20,000 you could get 20 athletes,"
Chisam said. "Now that might get one
athlete."
For athletes like Popejoy and
Helfter, Chisam said the meet was a
much needed confidence-builder.
"This was probably exactly what the
doctor ordered to go into Pac-10 Cham
pionships," he said.
