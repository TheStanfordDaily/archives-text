Second Leadership Conference held
The second student leadership conference was held this Satur
day at Tresidder Cypress Room.
About 40 campus student groups got together to discuss issues
such as identity and community building, according to Council of
Presidents member Benny Sandoval, who organized the event.
Sandoval said the group discussed what can be done to "over
come differences among groups to make Stanford a better place."
Sandoval said that throughout the discussions, the group "was
constantly aware of the fact that big changes are coming next
year: the budget cuts being implemented, a new president, a new
Vice President for Student Resources, no Council of Presidents."
But, Sandoval said, these issues were not directly addressed by
the group.
One of the conclusions of the conference was that "students
will have to take the initiative and somehow make ourselves
heard to the administration," Sandoval said.
A similar conference was held last quarter, though this time no
administrators were present, said Sandoval, who stressed the
importance of continuing with the event.
"I think it was a success and has to continue into the next
years. But I'm not sure how it's going to happen," she said.
Lag's lifeguard chair stolen after four days
A $2,000 lifeguard chair installed on Monday at Lake Laguni
ta was stolen Friday night, according to Coordinator of the Office
of Student affairs Heather Dunn.
But Dunn said she thinks the theft might be a prank, since
only the chair is missing. The ladder and chair support are still
there.
"There's not a big market for lifeguard chairs as far as I
know," Dunn said. "I don't understand why anybody would want
to steal something like a lifeguard chair."
