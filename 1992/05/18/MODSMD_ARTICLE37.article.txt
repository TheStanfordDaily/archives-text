# Small explosion, fire rock 675 Lomita
## Two windows shatter in former Theta Delt house; no injuries reported 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
An electrical fire at 675 Lomita Drive
caused an aerosol can to explode Friday, shat
tering two windows and startling residents of
the former Theta Delt house.
"It was like an earthquake," said senior
Jeremy Friedman, a house resident. "It felt
like a dresser had fallen over."
No one was hurt in the incident, which was
reported to the Stanford fire station at 4:53
p.m. as a "possible explosion."
The noise of the exploding can and breaking
glass attracted the attention of six or seven
members of the Kappa Sigma fraternity, who
were playing basketball on the 675 Lomita court.
They ran through the house telling residents to
get out, according to junior Ken Hoffman.
Hoffman said he entered the room and put
out the fire with a house extinguisher before

the firefighters arrived.
According to Fire Captain Leon Leonard,
an electrical outlet in senior Anne Fleming's
room shorted out, starting the fire. The flames
heated up a can of hair spray, causing a small
explosion.
Hoffman noted that the flames on the dress
er were "mostly from the hair diyer" and were
already as high as the shattered fluorescent bulb
hanging above it when he entered the room.
The carpet had also just started to catch
fire, he added, and after putting out the two
separate fires in the room, he "gave the whole
room an overall shot" with the extinguisher to
make sure all the flames were out.
Upon arrival, firefighters set up a large fan
to blow smoke and extinguisher powder
residue out of the house.
"It's a good thing that can of hair spray
exploded," Fleming said. "It sort of announced
the fire" to the students playing basketball.

Some of her clothes were scorched and others
need dry-cleaning, and her contact lenses were
destroyed.
She said she has been told that University
insurance should cover all her damages.
Leonard said there may be a connection
between the electrical fire and previous elec
trical problems in the house.
Residents in nearby rooms had reported
lights going out to the University earlier in the
week, he said, and an electrician had been out
to the house to check those problems.
An overhead light in outer room of the two
room double had gone out earlier in the day,
but the fire started in the inner room.
University maintenance workers replaced
the fire-damaged outlet and boarded up the
two windows over the weekend.
"There's a lot of force in those cans," said
Leonard. "People don't realize .. . it's like car
rying a bomb around in your purse."
