# Disabled students win housing fight
## University's assigning system should be changed, they say 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
Housing officials decided Friday to
allow two disabled students to live in
the residences of their choice, after
what the students described as two
weeks of University protests that it
would be too expensive.
Sophomore Tony Wagner said offi
cials agreed to install a wooden
wheelchair ramp in the Enchanted
Broccoli Forest house so he can live
there. The University will also likely

modify a shower in
Slavianskii Dom for
senior Adriana Duffy.
Wagner and Duffy
said resolution of their
requests came after
hours of meetings with
Housing officials, and
added that they will
work to change the
process by which the

University assigns housing to disabled
students.
In order to get housing, disabled stu

dents are required to apply for a Draw
exemption.
Disability Resource Center Director
John Asheim said the Housing Office
reversed its position after the center
pressured it, appealing to laws govern
ing access for disabled students.
"The process is what is the problem
here, not the individual decisions,"
Asheim said.
Wagner said the office first
approved, then rejected his request for


Duffy
an exemption from the Draw so
that he could live at EBF. Wagner
then went through the Draw and
drew 1037, a number typically low
enough to place a student in EBF.
He said Housing officials called
him almost immediately to tell
him his Draw number had been
invalidated.
Duffy said the University simi
larly changed its position on her
request to live in Slavianskii, the
Russian and East European
theme house.
Duffy, who studies Russian,
said officials requested that she
live at Storey, where she current
ly lives, and attend the programs
at Slavianskii. She said they cited
the expense of installing a new
shower accessible to her at Sla
vianskii as the reason for her not
being able to move there.
According to Duffy, the approval

came when officials learned that a
first-floor shower could be modified
at an acceptable cost.

'There is a budget
for doing these
things. [The modifi
cations are] going
to work within this
budget.'

According to Associate Hous
ing Director Rodger Whitney,
"There is a budget for doing these
things. [The modifications arej
going to work within this bud
get."
Director of Housing and Food
Services Keith Guy said that
under the office's initial proposal,
Duffy "could take part in the
meals and all of the program
ming" even though there was no

provision for her to live in the
house.
But Duffy argued that an
essential part of the theme house
is the presence of a faculty mem
ber and the ability to use the lan
guage on a daily basis.
Asheim, Wagner and Duffy
said the incidents highlight
inequities in the University's
housing system.
Guy said a University plan for
disabled-student access to resi
dences "needs to be developed"
but declined to comment on the
students' cases.
William Georges, acting direc
tor of the Housing Center, did not
return repeated calls yesterday.
Wagner criticized the Universi
ty's reluctance to exempt an
entire Draw group that contains a
disabled student, saying that the
University will exempt only the
student and a roommate.
The policy isolates disabled
students who find it difficult to be
a part of larger Draw groups,
Wagner said.
