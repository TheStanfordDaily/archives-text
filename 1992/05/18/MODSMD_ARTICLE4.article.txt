# Disabled students win housing fight
## University's assigning system should be changed, they say 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
Housing officials decided Friday to
allow two disabled students to live in
the residences of their choice, after
what the students described as two
weeks of University protests that it
would be too expensive.
Sophomore Tony Wagner said offi
cials agreed to install a wooden
wheelchair ramp in the Enchanted
Broccoli Forest house so he can live
there. The University will also likely

modify a shower in
Slavianskii Dom for
senior Adriana Duffy.
Wagner and Duffy
said resolution of their
requests came after
hours of meetings with
Housing officials, and
added that they will
work to change the
process by which the

University assigns housing to disabled
students.
In order to get housing, disabled stu

dents are required to apply for a Draw
exemption.
Disability Resource Center Director
John Asheim said the Housing Office
reversed its position after the center
pressured it, appealing to laws govern
ing access for disabled students.
"The process is what is the problem
here, not the individual decisions,"
Asheim said.
Wagner said the office first
approved, then rejected his request for


Duffy
