Allegations of disruptive and illegal
behavior during Sigma Nu and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon camping trips will be
investigated soon by the Interfraternity
Council Judicial Board, officials said.

rangers accused fraternity members of
illegal alcohol use, vandalism, littering
and other activities at the Portola State
Park during separate Rush retreats

Director of Student Activities Nanci
Howe said problems of the Greek sys

Judicial Board, and it will meet some
time within the next two weeks to dis
cuss the allegations.
Sigma Nu Rush chair Evan Singer
said that while drinking beer and play

group was approached by park rangers.
Singer said the rangers requested that
they stop playing soccer, because the run

of the redwood trees on the campsite.
Burger's letter said the game "was
immediately stopped when I explained the
environmental issues to the large group."
But he said the contacts with the
SA's culminated "with our having to
douse their fire and command them to
clean up their filthy campsite and go to
bed, at 4 a.m. Sunday."
The letter said there were "at least
five kegs at the site, a parking lot gate
