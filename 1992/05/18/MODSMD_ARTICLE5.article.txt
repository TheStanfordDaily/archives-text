Allegations of disruptive and illegal
behavior during Sigma Nu and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon camping trips will be
investigated soon by the Interfraternity
Council Judicial Board, officials said.
In a letter to the University, park
rangers accused fraternity members of
illegal alcohol use, vandalism, littering
and other activities at the Portola State
Park during separate Rush retreats
April 25.
In the letter, addressed to Dean of
Students Michael Jackson, State Park
Ranger Carl Burger described problems
ranging from "an illegal and boisterous

evening soccer game" to "vomit in the
garbage cans."
"At least most of it was in the
garbage cans," he added.
While Sigma Nu ended their soccer
game after being reprimanded, Burger
said four contacts with the SAEs "found
progressively worsening behavior."
Director of Student Activities Nanci
Howe said problems of the Greek sys
tem are typically handled by the IFC
Judicial Board, and it will meet some
time within the next two weeks to dis
cuss the allegations.
Sigma Nu Rush chair Evan Singer
said that while drinking beer and play
ing soccer at the campsite, the Sigma Nu

group was approached by park rangers.
Singer said the rangers requested that
they stop playing soccer, because the run
ning and kicking was damaging the roots
of the redwood trees on the campsite.
Burger's letter said the game "was
immediately stopped when I explained the
environmental issues to the large group."
But he said the contacts with the
SA's culminated "with our having to
douse their fire and command them to
clean up their filthy campsite and go to
bed, at 4 a.m. Sunday."
The letter said there were "at least
five kegs at the site, a parking lot gate
had been dismantled, the group
could be heard throughout the
rest of the Portola campground,
redwood limbs were being used for
firewood and the parking lot was
strewn with litter."
According SAE president
Allan Thorpe, "When we realized
the ranger's genuine concern, we
acted accordingly and sent most
of the members home." He added
that the fraternity cleaned their
campsite the next morning and
"left it spotless."

Thorpe said the fraternity has
ill ready sent a letter to Jackson to
formally respond to the charges
made against them. He also said
SAE plans to write a letter to the
Park apologizing for the noise level.
Howe said the Judicial Board
will review the accusations to
decide if University policy has
been violated.
In his letter, Burger said he
does not look forward to fraterni
ty retreats in his park.
"LW]e are not a place to party.
Could Jasper Ridge be designated
as an on-campus location where
students can go to throw up,
without having to travel so far?"
he wrote.
