# When 'home' really isn't
## Dormitory environment can increase pressures for students who are gay 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
Most students learn to consider their
dorms "home" soon after arriving at
Stanford. But for many gay, lesbian or
bisexual students, this "home" is not
always the most comfortable place to be.
Anti-gay jokes and comments often
create an atmosphere hostile to gays —
and suspicions concerning a student's
sexuality sometimes blow up into uncom
fortable or even outright discriminatory
confrontations.
In one dorm this year, a climate of high
suspicion was aroused among residents
after one student anonymously wrote on
the bathroom graffiti board that she had a
sexual encounter with another woman.
A small group of students in the same
dorm set fire to fliers advertising speak
ers from the Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Speakers' Bureau.
Harassment in another freshman
dorm prompted a student to request a
new room assignment and move to a dif
ferent residence.
The student was openly questioned
about his sexuality and accused of being
gay. His belongings — including his shoes

and research materials — were thrown
from a third-floor balcony several times
during fall and winter quarter because
some members of his all-male floor sus
pected he was gay.
"Eveiy time I stepped into my dorm, I
dreaded walking up the stairs to go to my
room," he recalled. He also said he devel
oped "erratic" sleeping patterns and would
go to sleep in two shifts of three hours each
in order to avoid his roommates.
"I got zero work done" in that atmo
sphere, he said. "All I did was just sit
there in the lounge, asking God why this
was happening to me."
'There is no protocol'
The freshman who was harassed by
his dormmates eventually moved to a dif
ferent dorm last quarter. But there is no
set policy for dealing with these room
change requests.
"There is no protocol" for resolving
roommate problems, said Director of Res
idential Education Alice Supton, empha
sizing that each room change request is
dealt with on an individual basis. "We
don't have a formulaic response."
