# When 'home' really isn't
## Dormitory environment can increase pressures for students who are gay 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
Most students learn to consider their
dorms "home" soon after arriving at
Stanford. But for many gay, lesbian or
bisexual students, this "home" is not
always the most comfortable place to be.
Anti-gay jokes and comments often
create an atmosphere hostile to gays —
and suspicions concerning a student's
sexuality sometimes blow up into uncom
fortable or even outright discriminatory
confrontations.
In one dorm this year, a climate of high
suspicion was aroused among residents
after one student anonymously wrote on
the bathroom graffiti board that she had a
sexual encounter with another woman.
A small group of students in the same
dorm set fire to fliers advertising speak
ers from the Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Speakers' Bureau.
Harassment in another freshman
dorm prompted a student to request a
new room assignment and move to a dif
ferent residence.
The student was openly questioned
about his sexuality and accused of being
gay. His belongings — including his shoes

and research materials — were thrown
from a third-floor balcony several times
during fall and winter quarter because
some members of his all-male floor sus
pected he was gay.
"Eveiy time I stepped into my dorm, I
dreaded walking up the stairs to go to my
room," he recalled. He also said he devel
oped "erratic" sleeping patterns and would
go to sleep in two shifts of three hours each
in order to avoid his roommates.
"I got zero work done" in that atmo
sphere, he said. "All I did was just sit
there in the lounge, asking God why this
was happening to me."
'There is no protocol'
The freshman who was harassed by
his dormmates eventually moved to a dif
ferent dorm last quarter. But there is no
set policy for dealing with these room
change requests.
"There is no protocol" for resolving
roommate problems, said Director of Res
idential Education Alice Supton, empha
sizing that each room change request is
dealt with on an individual basis. "We
don't have a formulaic response."
And the lack of a standardized
procedure for dealing with these
cases frustrates some gay stu
dents, who view the University's
case-by-case policy as a trivializa
tion of the problem.
"I think there needs to be a
more formal recognition of [gay
housing] problems — some explic
it policy, rather than treating it on
an individual case-by-case basis,"
said sophomore Rachel Maddow.
"We're here and we're a real
issue," Maddow said, adding that
residence problems for gay, les
bian and bisexual students should
not be treated as "incidental."
And graduate student Eleanor
Feingold, coordinator of the Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Community
Center, said she was also discontent
with the lack of a University policy.
"I think we need to do something
radical about housing," she said.
A few students suggested that
incoming freshmen should be able
to choose roommates on the basis
of personal prejudices to avoid
uncomfortable or hostile situa
tions.
But Feingold noted that most
students do not "come out on their
freshman housing applications."
Some entering freshmen do
request to live with a straight
roommate, according to Bill

Georges, acting director of the
Housing Center. But "we wouldn't
honor that kind of request," he
said. "We expect students to be
able to live with students who are
different than they are."
'In-house resolutions'
When conflicts occur between
roommates, the residence staff
will first attempt to resolve the
conflict within the dorm, and
room changes of any kind are
"highly unusual," Supton said,
This year, two gay students
requested room changes through
the Housing Center, and one was
granted his request, Georges said.
Georges said the other request
was denied because the student was
able to work out the conflict within
the dorm. In most cases, "we try to
have the residence staff resolve [the
crisisj in the house," he said.
Roommate conflicts are usually
addressed first by residence assis
tants and the resident fellow of the
dorm. If the problem cannot be
solved at either of these levels, the
residence dean becomes involved.
In some situations, the best
solution may be to encourage
communication among the stu
dents in conflict, Supton said.
But Ann Porteus, associate
director of Residential Education,
said a room change is sometimes the
healthiest solution. "What happens
at individual levels can become so
painful," she said. "We can't say [to
the students], 'You need to stay in

this room together,' " Porteus said.
Levels of tolerance
Anti-gay sentiment in dorms is
not always "expressed in overt
discrimination," Supton said. But
these feelings often manifest in
more subtle ways "at the level of
moral condemnation, exclusion
and dorm gossip."
And tensions seem to run par
ticularly high in all-freshman
dorms and on same-sex halls,
according to officials in Residen
tial Education, who attributed the
difference to disparities in both
experience and level of exposure
to a diversity of lifestyles.
Four-class dorms are "general
ly more tolerant," according to
Angela Rickford, residence dean
of Wilbur Hall.
And Alice Bender, residence
dean of Branner, Kimball and
Toyon halls, agreed. "The tendency
is to find more understanding and
willingness to live and let live," in
dorms where students have been
exposed to different ideas for a
longer period of time, she said.
The one student who received a
room reassignment this year
because of destructive anti-gay sen
timent among his dormmates said
he was "really happy with the demo
graphics" of his new dorm, which is
four-class and has co-ed floors.
Co-ed floors, many students
agree, tend to be more tolerant of
gay, lesbian and bisexual students
than are single-sex floors, a differ

ence that Supton attributed to the
increased "levels of interaction"
afforded by co-ed floors.
Due to student demand, the
Housing Center is trying to con
vert more single-sex floors into co
ed floors, Georges said.
Weighing rights
Some students — such as the
Hammarskjold resident who recent
ly requested a room change because
his roommate was gay — cite reli
gious concerns as their reason for
not living with a gay roommate.
That student's request was
granted, but Supton said Res Ed
had "no blanket policy" to address
these cases, outside of a dedication
to being "sensitive and respon
sive" to students' religious beliefs.
Multicultural Educator Greg
Ricks said that although religious
holdings are important, he "wor
ries about the editing" of these
beliefs — situations in which peo
ple selectively obey their reli
gion's teachings.
For instance, students may
break religious rules prohibiting
alcohol and pre-marital sex, but
adhere strictly to those scriptures
that condemn homosexuality,
Ricks said.
These situations bring up deli
cate situations for Res Ed direc
tors, who must weigh one stu
dent's rights against another's.
"I would want to say to both
[parties involved] 'I validate
you,'" Porteus said.
