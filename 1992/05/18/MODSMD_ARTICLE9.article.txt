# Residents of Roth House say all the stereotypes are wrong

Roth — 34 women living together in a house
without men ... by choice.
Puzzled students have often wondered about the
women who choose to live in the rather enigmatic
residence — who are they, and why are they there?
As Resident Assistant Sharon LaVoy explained,
Roth, the University's only all-female residence, is "a
normal house, not a scary witch haven. It's a beauti
ful house with nice people — it's a cool place to live."
Her positive sentiments about the University
operated, upperclass house were echoed by senior
d'Layne Kerr, a Roth resident. "It's much smaller
than a dorm, so it's tight-knit and you can get to
know a few people really well."
"You don't notice it in a negative way that
there are no men here; I actually like it," Kerr
added. "It's not as anti-social as some places in
Sterling Quad."
The house has been an all-female residence
ever since it was built for the Gamma Phi Beta
sorority in 1909. When the sorority left it in 1944,
when all of the other sorority houses on campus
were also closed, the house was renamed Roth.
LaVoy said Roth will probably never become
coed because "there's enough need for or interest
in all-female housing, and there is lots of all-male
housing because of the fraternities."
Most of the residents live in doubles or triples;
half of them drew guaranteed, half unguaranteed.
LaVoy described Roth as "one of the nicest places
to get unguaranteed," and decided to live there
because she "felt like it was something I hadn't
tried before at Stanford."
Kerr chose to live in the house because "I
heard it was a cool place; a friend from my Draw
group last year recommended it. It's a nice change
of pace — I like it a lot. . . . Roth is the best-kept
secret on campus."

Because she knew so little about Roth, LaVoy said
she didn't have any expectations before moving in.
"I thought it would be nice to live with all
women and I was right," she said. "I'm sure there
are many stereotypes running around [about
Roth residents]. I just haven't heard them."
In actuality, LaVoy says the residents are "just
as much of a mix as anywhere else — there are
sorority women, liberal women, women from dif
ferent states and ethnicities."
Kerr also praised the house's diversity, but
added that she was disappointed because she had
"thought it would be more feminist."

some places in Sterling

"I was looking forward to that," she said. "I
didn't expect such a strong Greek contingent."
Both women cited Roth's location as one of its
high points. "It's on the Row, which is more laid
back and 'come as you are' " than the dorms,
LaVoy said. "There are very different neighbors
— frats, theme houses — so there is a diverse
community to draw from."
"It's in a nice location, yet away enough so that
you're not right there in the middle of every
thing," said Kerr, adding that "the only bad part
about Roth is the Wilbur food service," which is
carted to the house for meals.
Despite the food, Roth residents said they
would recommend living in the house to others.
"It's really supportive — many people like that it
is all women," LaVoy said. "We deal with coed sit
uations all the time; it's nice to have a place where
(only) women will be there."
