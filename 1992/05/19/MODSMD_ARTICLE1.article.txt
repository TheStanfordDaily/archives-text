### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Seated on a throne-like wooden
loveseat covered in red velvet, Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy and his
wife Robin heard both praise and good
natured teasing during a farewell
event last night.
Called "A Stanford Tribute to Don
ald Kennedy," the function in Burnham
Pavilion was attended by more than
200 people. Speakers ranged from for
mer Secretary of State George Shultz to
a group of Stanford varsity athletes.
Kennedy will step down from his
post Aug:~3l. —

The Kennedys received a standing
ovation on the way to their seat, and
during the program the "first couple"
laughed at the jibes pointed their way.
And there were plenty of jibes to go
around.
"Tonight's event will be audited" by
Paul Biddle, joked Bob Murphy, the
announcer for Stanford's football games
and emcee of last night's program.
"Sometime during the proceedings I
will expect a small yacht, some flowers,
or maybe even a toilet seat" as a gift for
Kennedy from Biddle, Murphy added.
Entertainers, including the Fleet
Street Singers and the comedy impro
visation group Spontaneous Genera

tion, performed for the Kennedys.
And Donald Kennedy did his share
of the entertaining as well, singing
"Amphioxus," a song from his profes
sor days, for the audience.
Alumni Association President
William Stone remembered the time
then-Biology Prof. Donald Kennedy
gave him a D-plus in biology at Stan
ford. "It was when Robin Kennedy was
in high school," Stone said.
Calling Kennedy "the grand fro
mage" and "an old fart from the Har
vard class of '52," Stone thanked
Kennedy for being "the best of the best

in so many areas, [including]
accounting."
"Mr. President," Stone said,
"by the authority vested in me by
nobody in particular, I wish you
thanks and Godspeed."
ASSU Senate Chair Kevin
Warsh also chided the outgoing
president,while poking fun at stu
dent government.
"President Kennedy, you
thought you had problems with
your approval ratings. Welcome
to the ASSU," Warsh said.
And Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington said he would
miss the routine he and Kennedy
had established of "Monday
morning reviewing of all the fra
ternity parties featuring music
within five miles of Hoover
House."
But there was a serious tone to
the ceremony too, as speakers
complimented Kennedy on the
way he led Stanford during his
years as president.
Shultz talked of the need for
universities and university presi
dents to play "a world role, as well
as a national or regional role" in

educational and political issues,
and expressed his admiration for
Kennedy as an educational leader
who has played a significant role.
"Donald Kennedy is a happy,
pleasant, gracious, caring and
warm human being," said
Provost Gerald Lieberman. "He
leaves the presidency with Stan
ford being one of the great univer
sities in the world."
"Don and Robin, we're in your
debt for all those years of out
standing service. Thanks," he
added.
Two locations were named
after Kennedy last night. Stone
announced the oak grove outside
Bowman Alumni House will be
called Kennedy Grove, and the
largest room in the Haas Public
Service building, currently under
construction, will be called the
Donald Kennedy Conference
Room.
Council of Presidents member
John Louie told Kennedy, "Stan
ford students really love you and
appreciate your guidance," espe
cially for efforts toward promot
ing a diverse student body and
public service, and success at fund
raising.
"Thank you for taking Stan
ford University into its second
century of excellence," Louie said.
