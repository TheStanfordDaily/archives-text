event last night.
Called "A Stanford Tribute to Don

announcer for Stanford's football games
and emcee of last night's program.
"Sometime during the proceedings I

or maybe even a toilet seat" as a gift for
Kennedy from Biddle, Murphy added.
Entertainers, including the Fleet
Street Singers and the comedy impro

And Donald Kennedy did his share
of the entertaining as well, singing
"Amphioxus," a song from his profes

in high school," Stone said.
Calling Kennedy "the grand fro
mage" and "an old fart from the Har
vard class of '52," Stone thanked
Kennedy for being "the best of the best
