Revised academic policy
undermines credibility
of grades on transcript

POOR GRADES will no
longer strike the same chord
of doom in students' hearts
now that a revision of University
academic policy allows students to,
in effect, edit their transcripts.
But expectations of rising grade
point averages should be weighed
against the dangerous implications
of the new policy. Replacing grades
and pretending a course was never
taken is a dishonest representation
of a student's academic record.
The Faculty Senate decided last
week to allow students to replace
previous grades on their transcripts
when they retake classes — and
only the better grade will appear.
The policy is clearly intended to
reward students who, for various
reasons, may have floundered in a
class, but retake the course in
order to improve their perfor
mance.
But if the University wants to
recognize students who have
shown a commitment to improve
by retaking a class, they should
stick to their original policy of
reporting both grades.
Graduate schools and employers
are usually receptive to evidence
that a student has shown the dedi
cation to retake a course, and they
may actually appreciate seeing vis
ible results of a student's progress.
However, these institutions will
no longer be able to trust the cred
ibility of a Stanford transcript
because the reported grades could
be the result of a class taken once,
twice or any number of times.
Under the new plan, students
will be able to tailor their tran
scripts to their desired GPA — as
long as they have the time and
money to stay long enough.
Another change approved by the
Fac Sen will allow students to drop
classes just minutes before finals,

which is simply a "technical revi
sion" of existing policy, as Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy said.
But any further tinkering with
the drop policy by the Fac Sen is
unwarranted. Some faculty mem
bers have indicated they want to
move the drop deadline back by
several weeks.
The policy should not be changed.
It has allowed students the flexibili
ty to experiment with courses and
stick with them, even though the
courses may not be within their spe
ciality — consistent with Stanford's
ideology of encouraging students to
broaden their perspectives.
The grade replacement policy,
on the other hand, is an overexten
sion of the drop policy's generosity.
While it appears to maintain the
same ideals of encouraging experi
mentation, it does so by sacrificing
an honest evaluation of a student's
performance.
The grade replacement policy
might also appear consistent with
the current "No Credit" policy —
students who get an "NC" have a
similar advantage of courses not
showing up on their transcript.
However, the "No Credit" sys
tem must be maintained to mini
mize negative competition between
students. At schools like UC-
Berkeley, where the threat of the
"F" looms over students, cutthroat
competitiveness hurts the learning
environment and hinders support
ive interactions between students.
While being able to replace
grades may take pressure off stu
dents as well, the policy discour
ages a fair evaluation of students'
performances. '7, ,
If students can edit their tran
scripts as they please, grades will
become merely arbitrary represen
tations that lack credibility.
Grades should not be every
thing, but unfortunately, to many
graduate schools and employers,
they are almost everything.
Stanford prides itself on its rig
orous academic curriculum. The
University cannot risk undermin
ing the validity of its students'
transcripts.
