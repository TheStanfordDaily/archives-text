## Toward building coalitions 
### 
WHEN ANGELA DAVIS spoke in
Kresge last Friday for the culmi
nation of a week celebrating
African-American women, I was honored
to be able to hear her speak.
She reminded us that what happened
to Rodney King happens to women also.
"And in all of this discussion on police
crimes," Davis asks, "how much have we
heard about the sexual assault that is often
a part of the brutality or the crime com
mitted by the policemen against women?"
Davis speaks from her own experience in
jail as well as the case of a Berkeley police
man who molested female recruits.
African-American women have always
come to the aid of their brothers, Davis
says. It was a woman who organized the
protest against lynchings. And yet how
dften have men supported the women?
How many men have?
I remember sitting in the audience
thinking, "There should be more people
here. This is Angela Davis!" Now I'm also
thinking, "Why weren't there more men?"
Davis encourages women not to forget
about themselves and to be aware of self
effacement. Speaking of Supreme Court
Justice Clarence Thomas, she says: "Why
don't we know better?" Why don't we know
better than to assume that just because
someone is a "brother," he will support us?
Davis points out that rap has done a
lot of work in politicizing the youth. But
alongside songs that talk about Martin

Luther King, Jr and Malcolm X are songs
about bitches and ho's.
Perhaps similar criticisms could be made
against women who are in collusion with
the system. However, the number of these
women is much smaller than the number of
men who do not support women's issues.
As Nikki Giovanni advised, we must
find the people (men and women) who
share the same goals that we have and
will work with us. And we must beware of
the fools who will lead us astray.
Too often we think on purely racial
lines. I am bothered by the silent, some
times voiced, belief that Asian-Americans
have not and do not suffer from racism
and thus have no stake in the protest for
justice for Rodney King.
Yes, this is about racism. It is also
about humanity. A mentality that allows
for violence is dangerous to all of us.
From the wife who is beaten by her hus
band, to the women who are harassed at
work, to the men who are killing each
other on the streets. What is the point of
measuring or comparing our suffering?
Isn't it enough that it exists?
Many times this year I have felt dis
heartened by the state of student affairs on
campus. This was one of the reasons why I
applied to be a columnist. I wanted to bring
some understanding and bridge some gaps
that exist between students because we
only see each other superficially.
"As women, there may be greater pos-

sibilities of building alliances and coali
tions," Davis suggests. Racism and sex
ism are closely intertwined. Already
there are groups within communities on
campus to address these issues. Sisters in
Stanford is the organization of African-
American women that brought Davis to
campus. La Chicana Caucus just formed
this year, and Stanford Asian Women has
been around for four years.
Last quarter Quynh Tran, the
Women's Center coordinator, brought
together women from these groups as well
as from the Native American community
to open lines of communication and begin
the process of building a coalition. At a
reception open to all in February, women
began to talk about the specific issues in
their communities and discuss what kinds
of things they had in common.
It is difficult for each of us to juggle
the several interests that bind us to many
communities. But the work is essential if
we are to achieve lasting progress for our
own groups as well as the larger ones that
encompass us all.

Jane would like to encourage interested
people to call the Women's Center to
ensure the continuation of this effort.
