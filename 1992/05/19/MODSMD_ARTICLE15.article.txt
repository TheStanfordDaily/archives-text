Buckley's lecture not intellectually valid discourse

WE FIND IT APPALLING that in
the wake of the Rodney King
verdicts and the aftermath of
violent protests William Buckley is visit
ing Stanford this evening to discuss his
agenda of ultra-conservative politics.
How can someone who dismisses race
as a relevant issue in the curricula of
higher education be endorsed to speak at
our school?
As members of the queer community
at Stanford, we think that Buckley's
visit has serious implications.
Repeatedly, he has attacked colleges
like Stanford for their institutional sup
port of African-American studies, Chi
cano/Latino studies, non-Western cul
ture requirements and other "ethnic"
studies classes, feminist scholarship, gay
and lesbian awareness endeavors, gender
distribution requirements and pro-femi
nist/pro-choice activities.
These programs are threatened by
those who would trivialize their sub
stance by positing them under the rubric
of political correctness.
Buckley uses such irrational reason
ing to preach his conservative politics.
Following the Ujamaa incident two
years ago in which posters were defamed

with racist slurs, he stated in The
National Review:
"The whole race relations drag in
places like Stanford has only the effect
of accentuating the color of a student's
skin, which ought to be irrelevant.. . .
The net effect of the incident was a 244-
page report on race relations which
called for 30 new minority faculty, twice
as many minority graduate students,
twice as many courses on race rela
tions. . . ." (Feb. 19, 1990).
In this article, Buckley undermines
the progress made in ethnic/cultural
studies first by trivializing Ujamaa's
response, as if to suggest that race is not
a salient issue, as if the status quo is
devoid of racism.
Then he discredits the institutional
reforms as a misguided response to
problems that do not exist. This is typi
cal of the ultra-conservative tactic: to
cloak underlying problems behind the
gold lining of the status quo.
Any form of intellectual anti-subordi
nation activity is dismissed as "faddism
and a surrender to ideological war
lordism."
"That a first-rank college should feel
obliged to sponsor 'Gay-Lesbian Aware-

ness Days' suggests the kind of cultural
diffidence that testifies not to tolerance,
but to helplessness." (National Review,
Feb. 19, 1990)
The same rhetoric flows through the
right-wing attacks on feminism, and gay,
lesbian and bisexual awareness.
People in the queer community spend
hours every quarter organizing events,
producing literature and speaking out in
dormitories and classes in the hopes of
educating people and dispelling myths
about homo/bisexuality.
Yet, when a William Buckley comes
and immediately dismisses such work as
political propaganda, we are forced to go
back to step one: defending the need for
such education in the first place and
naming the discrimination and homo
phobia that is rampant in our culture.
As educated queer folk, this is old hat.
We are beyond the point of needing to
convince the University that gay and les
bian awareness and education are essen
tial.
We hold conferences and create class
es on gay relationships, inter
cultural/gay and bisexual dynamics,
queer activism, queer filmmaking and
many more.

To waste our energy on defending the
existence of these is destructive to the
educational process; it limits the diversi
ty of ideas and phenomena to be
explored.
This is Buckley's plan, of course. So
don't be fooled.
Buckley and his old guard are tired;
their ploys to maintain hegemonic ide
ologies are tired. But mostly, they are
anti-intellectual: higher education
should challenge the status quo, identify
what is oppressive and propose models
for change.
Education should not be a tool to
maintain a social order that readily dis
criminates and subjugates real human
beings. What will it take for the conser
vative right-wing to understand the
implications of what it preaches?
If no one showed up tonight, the mes
sage would be damn clear. Until that
happens, though, you can bet we will not
sit around passively listening; we will
question and inform and disagree.

reforms as a misguided response to
problems that do not exist. This is typi
cal of the ultra-conservative tactic: to
cloak underlying problems behind the
gold lining of the status quo.
Any form of intellectual anti-subordi
nation activity is dismissed as "faddism
and a surrender to ideological war
lordism."
"That a first-rank college should feel
obliged to sponsor 'Gay-Lesbian Aware-

ness Days' suggests the kind of cultural
diffidence that testifies not to tolerance,
but to helplessness." (National Review,
Feb. 19, 1990)
The same rhetoric flows through the
right-wing attacks on feminism, and gay,
lesbian and bisexual awareness.
People in the queer community spend
hours every quarter organizing events,
producing literature and speaking out in
dormitories and classes in the hopes of
educating people and dispelling myths
about homo/bisexuality.
Yet, when a William Buckley comes
and immediately dismisses such work as
political propaganda, we are forced to go
back to step one: defending the need for
such education in the first place and
naming the discrimination and homo
phobia that is rampant in our culture.
As educated queer folk, this is old hat.
We are beyond the point of needing to
convince the University that gay and les
bian awareness and education are essen
tial.
We hold conferences and create class
es on gay relationships, inter
cultural/gay and bisexual dynamics,
queer activism, queer filmmaking and
many more.

To waste our energy on defending the
existence of these is destructive to the
educational process; it limits the diversi
ty of ideas and phenomena to be
explored.
This is Buckley's plan, of course. So
don't be fooled.
Buckley and his old guard are tired;
their ploys to maintain hegemonic ide
ologies are tired. But mostly, they are
anti-intellectual: higher education
should challenge the status quo, identify
what is oppressive and propose models
for change.
Education should not be a tool to
maintain a social order that readily dis
criminates and subjugates real human
beings. What will it take for the conser
vative right-wing to understand the
implications of what it preaches?
If no one showed up tonight, the mes
sage would be damn clear. Until that
happens, though, you can bet we will not
sit around passively listening; we will
question and inform and disagree.
