# Presidio should be set aside for native peoples
## 
### 
In the course of a weekend, this cam
pus witnessed the return of Gorbachev
as well as another successful Powwow.
At first glance, these events seem
unrelated — after all, what does a for
mer leader of Russia have in common
with Native American cultures?
Currently, both groups have a vested
interest in an area of land in San Fran
cisco called the Presidio.
The Gorbachev Fund has been offered
part of this land, soon to become unused

federal land when the military pulls out.
This gesture on the part of city, state
and federal officials, however, is yet
another affront and injustice to the
Native American community.
The Muwekma Ohlone people of the
San Francisco Bay Area have survived a
bitter history which has disenfranchised
them from their ancestral lands and
denied them recognition as a distinct
and independent people.
This history includes enslavement in
Mission communities in the early 1800s,
forced removals and stealing of tradition
al lands, cultural desecration and disre
spect of burial grounds and sacred sites.
As a critical pi ocess of their struggle

toward self-determination, the Muwek
ma Ohlone people are currently seeking
federal tribal recognition, along with
more than 30 other California Indian
nations who have been relegated to the
tragic status of "landless Indians."
The Muwekma Ohlone people have
also initiated the effort to regain a por
tion of their original land base, which
includes the Presidio.
Under federal law, this land must be
returned to the original "owners," the
Muwekma Ohlone.
This act of justice will be a significant
step in reversing the policy of genocide
through which many California Indian
peoples have become homeless in their

own homelands.
I support the stated goals of the Gor
bachev Fund, but am adamantly against
the establishment of this or any other »
organization in the Presidio until this
land is returned to the California Indian
Peoples from whom it was taken.
This is the year for healing the
wounds that have been inflicted upon
indigenous peoples, but this healing will
not begin until justice is done.
I encourage everyone to educate them
selves about these issues, become involved
and speak out against the past and pre
sent oppression of indigenous peoples.
