Row director discusses policy issues involving housing conflict

IWAS MISTAKEN in remembering
the part played by religion in Ham
marskjold House's discussions
referred to in the Daily editorial, "A Tale
of Roommates."
While religious beliefs and cultural
differences did arise early in private con
versations, they did not end up being at
all central in later talks, and in how the
matter was resolved.
I apologize for forgetting all that. How
ever, quite apart from the particulars of
this event, the editorial raises questions
that I hope will engage people's thought
ful consideration all over campus:
• Should the University have an offi
cial policy that states an unwillingness
to accommodate, for any reason, housing
preferences (including in-house assign
ments) based on potential roommate's

sexual orientation? Based on any other
characteristics?
• If, for deeply held and substantiated
religious beliefs, a student feels he must
not share a room with another student,
should the first student be made to leave
the housing system?
• For what kinds of issues should the
University intervene in the house's
room assignment policy or process? How
much discretion should the house be
given for working out differences among
its residents? Which kinds of differences,
if any, should require University
involvement in the resolution process?
What outcomes, if any (as contrasted to
processes), should be subject to being
overturned by the University?
• What happens when an attempt to
protect one person's right comes into

conflict with another person's right?
No hierarchy of difference is given in
the statement of the University's State
ment of Nondiscriminatory Policy.
Our hope has been to increase sensitivi
ty to the whole range of human differ
ences, and to encourage students to appre
ciate and respect all that goes into forming
a person's identity — their sex, race, reli
gion, sexual orientation and everything
that makes them who they are.
In general, when conflicts arise, the
best solution is likely to be developed by
the people closest to the problem.
In the case of roommates, we expect
that they first will try to resolve any dif
ficulty they're having.
If that doesn't work, they should
involve the resident assistant and, if
there is one, the resident fellow.

If that doesn't work, they should involve
the residence dean. In student-managed
houses, the house officers are also com
monly involved in working on the problem.
In the Hammarskjold instance, I feel
strongly that the RA and house officers
responded with sensitivity and consider
ation to both of their residents who were
troubled by the issues raised when they
were assigned ty room together.
Both the practical question — is it wise,
or even necessary, to force two people to
live together when there are other spaces
available in the house — and the more
philosophical ones were addressed, the lat
ter with the participation of the whole
house and the leadership of Greg Ricks.
Throughout the process, house lead
ers worked compassionately and respect
fully with both men.

The RA and I met and communicated
by telephone several times as the resolu
tion was being worked out.
Should the University have inter
vened more directly? Should someone
outside the house have rendered a deci
sion on the matter?
Hammarskjold, Stanford's internation
al co-op, has always been one of the most
heterogeneous living groups on campus.
It has also long enjoyed a reputation
for being a great place to live, where all
residents are treated with consideration
and where differences are an accepted
and valued part of daily life.
I think the house has a lot to teach
the rest of us about how to live in a truly
multicultural environment.
