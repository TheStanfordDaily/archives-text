# Electric cars needed for environmental health
## 
### 
This letter is in response to "Electric
car won't solve all environmental woes,"
a letter in the May 13 Daily.
Of course electric cars won't solve all
environmental woes. But I believe that
new technological developments have a
high probability of making electric and

hybrid cars an important component in
cleaning up our environment.
I hope the critics of the electric car
project will start a mass transport project
of their own and attract people who feel
that is where their time is best spent.
I wish success to all those working to
build a cleaner, sustainable world. Not
all of us will succeed, which is why many
diverse efforts are needed.
I hope our critics will extend us the
same good wishes rather than suggest

that there is only one line of action.
