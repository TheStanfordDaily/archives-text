# For single parents, a tough balance act
## Students say University fails to address family needs adequately 
### Carla Martin Staff writer 
Graduate student Donald Barr
carries a beeper while on campus
because he feels safer knowing his
11-year old son can reach him at
any time.
"This way, if he falls down or
hurts himself ... he beeps and I
go to the nearest campus phone,"
explained Barr, who is studying
sociology. "I can be back to Escon
dido Village within five minutes
on my bike."
Fortunately for Barr, the worst
emergency he has been paged for
was a broken toilet. But such con
cerns come with the territory for
students who are single parents.
About 22 single parent families
reside in Escondido Village,
according to Escondido Assistant
Director Carol Nyholm. There are
more single parent students who
live off campus, she said.
While all university students
face the challenge of managing
their own lives and coping with aca
demic and emotional stresses, these
students have to take responsibility
for their children's lives as well.
With the additional responsi
bility come numerous emotional
and financial stresses. Further
more, many parents say the Uni
versity has not dealt with their
unique needs and concerns.
Guilt is a common emotion for
the students, who often cannot
spend as much time as they'd like
with their children.
Ranjini Ramachandran, a
graduate student in statistics,

said she sometimes overcompen
sates when she feels she has
neglected her daughter. "I think
if I didn't feel guilty I wouldn't
try to make it up to her," she said.
"I would like to have a normal
living room," Ramachandran said,
looking around the toy-strewn liv
ing room. Stuffed animals and
bright yellow, red and blue chil
dren's furniture takes the place of
adult tables, chairs and desks.
William Bray, a graduate stu
dent in the School of Education,
said, "Single parents undeniably
have the hardest time of it of any
body on campus." He cared for his
son on his own until last year
because his wife was studying at
Harvard.
The key to managing the task,
Bray said, was being "incredibly
efficient," doing things such as
occasionally bringing his newborn
son along to class in a basket.
Ramachandran has had a
harder time dividing her time
between work, classes and her 2-
year-old daughter, Yasmine.
"I'm at work and classes from
9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and then I come
home and try to spend as much
time as possible with her," she
said. "Then I'm just so tired that
I just want to go to sleep."
For most students, weekends
are a great time to catch up on
work, but not for Ramachandran.
She spends Saturdays and Sun
days looking after her daughter.
"I need to spend the entire week
end with Yasmine," she said.
