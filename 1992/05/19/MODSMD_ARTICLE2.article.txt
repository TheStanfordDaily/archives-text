# For single parents, a tough balance act
## Students say University fails to address family needs adequately 
### Carla Martin Staff writer 
Graduate student Donald Barr
carries a beeper while on campus
because he feels safer knowing his
11-year old son can reach him at
any time.
"This way, if he falls down or
hurts himself ... he beeps and I
go to the nearest campus phone,"
explained Barr, who is studying
sociology. "I can be back to Escon
dido Village within five minutes
on my bike."
Fortunately for Barr, the worst
emergency he has been paged for
was a broken toilet. But such con
cerns come with the territory for
students who are single parents.
About 22 single parent families
reside in Escondido Village,
according to Escondido Assistant
Director Carol Nyholm. There are
more single parent students who
live off campus, she said.
While all university students
face the challenge of managing
their own lives and coping with aca
demic and emotional stresses, these
students have to take responsibility
for their children's lives as well.
With the additional responsi
bility come numerous emotional
and financial stresses. Further
more, many parents say the Uni
versity has not dealt with their
unique needs and concerns.
Guilt is a common emotion for
the students, who often cannot
spend as much time as they'd like
with their children.
Ranjini Ramachandran, a
graduate student in statistics,

said she sometimes overcompen
sates when she feels she has
neglected her daughter. "I think
if I didn't feel guilty I wouldn't
try to make it up to her," she said.
"I would like to have a normal
living room," Ramachandran said,
looking around the toy-strewn liv
ing room. Stuffed animals and
bright yellow, red and blue chil
dren's furniture takes the place of
adult tables, chairs and desks.
William Bray, a graduate stu
dent in the School of Education,
said, "Single parents undeniably
have the hardest time of it of any
body on campus." He cared for his
son on his own until last year
because his wife was studying at
Harvard.
The key to managing the task,
Bray said, was being "incredibly
efficient," doing things such as
occasionally bringing his newborn
son along to class in a basket.
Ramachandran has had a
harder time dividing her time
between work, classes and her 2-
year-old daughter, Yasmine.
"I'm at work and classes from
9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and then I come
home and try to spend as much
time as possible with her," she
said. "Then I'm just so tired that
I just want to go to sleep."
For most students, weekends
are a great time to catch up on
work, but not for Ramachandran.
She spends Saturdays and Sun
days looking after her daughter.
"I need to spend the entire week
end with Yasmine," she said.
Brenda Gentry-Norton, a grad
uate student in the School of Edu
cation, juggles two research pro
jects while meeting class demands
and raising two teenage daugh
ters, Kendra, 18 and Jolanna, 16.
She said sometimes the pres
sure of academics can get to her.
And just as it

would affect
other students'
interactions
with their room
mates, it does
play into her
relationship
with her chil
dren.
"Just because
we're mothers
doesn't make us
not susceptible
to the stress of
our programs,
but when that
happens ... we

apologize and try to make it up,"
Gentry-Norton said.
Virginia Velez, a graduate stu
dent in the School of Education,
finds the Stanford environment
"alienating" for single parents.
"I'm a minority, I'm queer —
it's hard, it's crazy," she said.
Marilyn Hoskins, a licensed clin
ical social worker, works with stu
dent parents out of Escondido Vil
lage about 3 hours a week. Accord
ing to Hoskins, support groups
have been started by single parent
students, but they have broken up
due to a lack of interest or time.
"There are few precious hours

ters on Stanford

per month.

to attend meetings," she
explained.
Counseling and Psychological
Services also provides counseling
for student parents, but they
don't have any specific programs
for single student parents.
"These parents are extremely
efficient and they don't have time
for themselves," said Dr. Alejandro
Martinez at CAPS. He said he tries
to advise students to make that
time — at least an hour every
other day.

Velez said
she finds it
absurd that the
most concrete
help she has
received from
the University
is in the form of
support groups,
which take up
more valuable
time.
"Squeezing
(support
groups) into
your already
sicko schedule

is pretty strange," said Velez.
"It's not about commiserating. I
don't need people to understand
how it feels — I need concrete
help. I need lower rent."
Ramachandran said she finds
her housing situation at the Uni
versity does not fit her lifestyle
and financial needs. "These peo
ple aren't caring" toward single
parents, she said.
All single parent students liv
ing on campus are assigned to
Escondido Village, according to
Nyholm. They are required to
have at least a two-bedroom
apartment.

But Ramachandran said she
doesn't understand why the Uni
versity's Housing Center does not
allow her to save money by shar
ing a room with her daughter.
A two-bedroom apartment at
Escondido costs her $748 per
month. If she had been permitted to
have a one-bedroom apartment, she
would have saved nearly $2,000 a
year. The housing rules also pre
vent her from renting one of the

bedrooms to another student.
William Georges, acting direc
tor of the Housing Center, said
the center has decided that next
year single parents will be able to
rent one-bedroom apartments for
a cost of $686 per month, as
opposed to a two-bedroom, which
will be raised to $767 per month.
"We know that some of them
(single parents) are in tough
financial circumstances," Georges

said. "We've been trying to find
ways to help them."
For students with very young
children, child care is another
expense to contend with.
Full-time child care for infants
at the four centers on Stanford
campus ranges from $750 to $835
per month. It is less for pre-school
ers, ranging from $530 to $610.
According to Nancy Golden,
the director of Children's Center

of the Stanford Community, their
program tries to meet the needs of
parents with lower incomes by
running a parent-cooperative
child program.
Costs are lower if parents work
three to five hours per week,
depending on whether their child
is there part-time or full-time.
Tara Ford, a law student with a
5-year-old daughter, had her daugh
ter at Stanford Arboretum Chil
dren's Center last year and said she
was happy with the arrangements.
Instead of utilizing Stanford's
services, Ramachandran said she
hires a full-time babysitter who
comes to her Escondido apart
ment because she couldn't afford
the prices of Stanford's centers.
A committee called the Gradu
ate Student and Family Services
Group tries to address some of the
concerns parents have. Members
make policy recommendations to
the University.
Chris Griffith, the acting direc
tor at Escondido Village, chairs
this committee, made up of Uni
versity administrators and staff
members who, in their profession
al capacities, come in daily contact
with single parent students.
Griffith said she believes some
solutions can be found within the
University. "I'm not sure we have
looked at the (University) commu
nity enough for resources," she said.
For example, the committee has
been looking into a way to connect
single parent students with non
parent students for babysitting.
But Velez is pessimistic about
the situation at Stanford. "If it
gets to be a detriment more than a
benefit, I'm out of here," she said.
"It's real iffy that I'll graduate
with a Ph.D."

Ranjini Ramachandran, a graduate student in statistics, takes a break to spend time with her daughter,
Yasmine. Students who are single parents often face emotional and financial obstacles more difficult
than those of other students.
