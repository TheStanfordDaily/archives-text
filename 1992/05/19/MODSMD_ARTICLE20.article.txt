# Hillel director clarifies remarks on gay issues
## 
### 
I was quoted in the May 15 Daily as
saying: "The Torah's treatment of male

homosexuality as a capital offense had
remained enforced until this generation."
This is not what I said. First, homo
sexual acts, not male homosexuality, are
what the Torah prohibited.
Second, while Levictus 20:13 con
demns "a man who lies with a man as a
with a woman" to be put to death, no
Jewish religious court has tried a capital
case since at least the year 70 of this era.
In addition, the Jewish legal process put
so many impediments in the way of execufc

ing anyone for any of the capital offences in
the Torah that the Talmud came to label
as any court that executed anyone even
once in 70 years as a "murdering court."
So, while the law remains on the
books, "in force," so to speak, its
"enforcement" has been rendered out of
the realm of possibility. Furthermore,
homosexuality is not a capital offense in
the modern state of Israel.
