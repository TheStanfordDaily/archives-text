## Netters play Notre Dame for championship 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
"Who'da thunk it!"
That was assistant tennis coach John
Whitlinger's first response upon
destroying UCLA, 5-1 in the NCAA
semifinals yesterday.
"I just wanted to get to doubles and
then Vimal (Patel) won, Chris (Cocotos)
went up a break, Michael (Flanagan)
was up 4-0 in the third and Rob (Devens)
broke. I thought 'Geez, can this really be
happening? [The press] is writing about
UCLA being one of the best teams ever."
Yes coach, it really happened. The
Cardinal did not even need a doubles
match to secure a victory over the tour
nament's third-seeded Bruins â€” the
same Bruins who blanked the Cardinal,
6-0, in one hour and fifteen minutes in a
dual match exactly one month ago, and
the same Bruins who have four of their
six starters ranked in the top 50.
"This was one of the best efforts by
Stanford that I've ever seen," said head
coach Dick Gould. Gould, who has led
the Cardinal to 11 NCAA team titles in
his 25 years on the Farm, was sur
prised and thrilled by his team's per
formance.
With senior Ail-American Jason Yee
suffering a stomach flu and Devens
recovering from severe leg cramps, the
usually healthy Cardinal did not appear
to be in peak condition.
"Jason lost quickly (6-3, 6-1) and I
thought 'Oh geez', but then I realized,
wow, (the match] might swing and it
did," he said. "If you'd have told me we'd
win 1,2,3 or 3,4,5 I'd have said you're
crazy, but 1,2,3,4,5!"
Co-captain Alex O'Brien solidly
stomped No. 4-ranked Mark Knowles, 6-
2, 6-4. The Stanford senior defeated
Knowles by an identical score in the
finals of the Pacific 10 Outdoor Champi
onships three weeks ago.
At second singles, Flanagan notched
up his first tournament singles win by
defeating No. 21 Billy Barber 6-3, 0-6, 6-
0. "You can believe we had a very one
sided conversation after that second
set," Gould remarked. "But he complete
ly turned it around and came back to
win."
Chris Cocotos stretched his NCAA
winning streak to 3-0 by defeating a
tough David Nainkin, 3-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-2.
"Nainkin played the best I've seen all
year but Chris stayed with him all the
way," Gould said. "He just kept coming

at him and coming at him. Eventually,
both Barber and Nainkin just wilted.
That's easy to say but hard to do. They
are very fine players."
Devens also had a nail-biting three
setter in the fourth slot against Bill
Behrens, but pulled out a 7-6 (7-4), 3-6,
6-3 win. Three weeks ago, in Ojai,
Behrens defeated the Stanford sopho
more, 6-2, 6-1.
Devens was up 4-1 in the third but
lost his serve, which put him at 4-3.
However, he mustered his forces and
broke back and held serve for the rest of
the match.
"He really put himself in a position to
win after being unable to even walk the
night before," Whitlinger said. "In my
six years (coaching) his was one of the
guttier efforts I've seen."
Patel also avenged an earlier season
loss by crushing Robert Janecek, 6-3, 6-
3. The No. 50iBruin breezed past Patel
6-1, 6-4 at the dual match in Los Ange
les.
"Vimal played great," Whitlinger
said. "He played very smart tennis and
Janecek just didn't have a lot of
answers."
Unfortunately, Yee's opponent at
sixth singles, Fritz Bissell, had all the
answers. Yee was a bit under the weath
er, according to coaches but should be
fine by today. "Jason really didn't play
bad, he just missed Bissell by an inch,"
Whitlinger explained.
Overall, the team put forward a
tremendous performance. "Anyone at
Stanford would've been very proud of
the Cardinal today," Gould said. "The
guys fought for the advantage and when
they got it, they closed out the match.
We played a great team today, a great
team. When the match was over I said,
'Nice goin' guys, but you'd better get
ready for tomorrow.'"
Today should be anything but routine
for the Cardinal. Their opponent is the
tournament's surprise success story.
The 12th-seeded Fighting Irish of Notre
Dame have played out of their minds,
plowing through the other half of the
draw and upsetting fifth-seeded Missis
sippi State, fourth-seeded Georgia and
finally, top-seeded USC en route to their
first NCAA finals appearance since 1959
when they were co-national champions
with Tulane.
Their shocking 5-1 pummelling of the
nation's top-ranked team stunned the
collegiate tennis world yesterday. The
24-3 Irish are led by No. 1-ranked Dave

DiLucia. The senior from Norristown,
Pa. sports a 21-0 record in dual matches.
This season DiLucia and O'Brien have
played twice, each winning once.
According to Whitlinger, DiLucia
should provide just the type of challenge
that O'Brien loves. "Alex has never lost
a match (singles or doubles) in NCAAs
and Dave is undefeated in dual matches.
It'll be a big match, just the kind that
'OB' loves to play."
Like the No. 1 singles competition,
the teams as a whole seem to match up
very well. Notre Dame has a young
team, like the Cardinal, and "their pro
gram is on the build," according to
Gould. Although the Cardinal has
NCAA experience on its side, the Fight
ing Irish have a few extra hours of sleep
on their side.
Whitlinger also voiced another, per
haps more critical concern: "I just hope
that the guys don't think that just
because we're not playing USC we're
going to automatically win. It's going to
be tough, but I'm not here to lose this
thing. We want to bring the champi
onship back home to Stanford, where it
belongs."
Tournament notes
This was the first time since 1986 in
which neither of the semifinal matches went
into doubles. . .Notre Dame is the lowest
ranked team ever to play in the finals since
the team format was adopted in 1977.. ..
Yesterday marked Notre Dame's first win
over USC, they were previously 0-6.. .If the
Cardinal wins today, Stanford will have five
NCAA titles for the year, tying UCLA's five
title record.


Senior Alex O'Brien continues to lead the way as the No. 2 Cardinal strives for a
national title. After crushing UCLA yesterday 5-1, Stanford faces Notre Dame, who
upset USC in the other semifinal, for the championship.
