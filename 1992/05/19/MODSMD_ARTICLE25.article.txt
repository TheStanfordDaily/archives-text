Stanford's No. 2 doubles team of Emma Wood
house and Kylie Johnson capped the first day of
NCAA individual competition with a thrilling
three-set win over Florida's top tandem of Holly
Lloyd and Kay Louthian.
The Cardinal took the first set 6-4 but dropped
the second, 6-3 in the see-saw battle. Stanford went
up a break in the third and Johnson served for the
match at 5-4. After several quick points the senior
crushed a service winner to clinch the victory.
The win salvaged the day for Johnson, who lost
her first round singles match to alphabetical seed
Cinda Gurney of North Carolina.
Heather Willens and Laxmi Poruri reached the
round of 16 yesterday in the singles and doubles
competition. Teammate Kristine Kurth was elimi
nated in the second round of singles.
Poruri, the No. 3 seed, first faced Duke's Julie
Exum. After a 6-2 first set in favor of Poruri, the

Blue Devils' top singles player took a 4-0 lead in the
second set. However, Poruri stormed back, captur
ing six straight games to clinch the match.
In the second round Poruri met California's No.
4 player, Keirsten Alley. The Cardinal cruised in
the first, 6-1, but was forced to gut out a tiebreaker
in the second 7-6 (7-3).
Poruri and Willens combined to knock Exum
and partner Christine Neuman out of the doubles
tourney 6-4, 6-1.
Willens also had a few close sets on the way to a
third round singles berth. She crushed Boston Col
lege's Pam Piorkowski 6-2, 6-0 but then faced Ari
zona's Alix Creek. The Wildcat beat Willens three
weeks ago on the way to the Pacific 10 Conference
crown.
But yesterday's match was different. Willens
edged Creek in a 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 nailbiter.
"I just got my confidence back. I went out and
hit," Willens said.
She said Creek didn't give her as tough a
contest this time around. "She didn't play as
well. She couldn't — she played unbelievable
that tournament," Willens said.
While Stanford's top two singles competi
tors advanced, Kurth was not as fortunate.
The Cardinal sophomore blasted Auburn's
Anna Funderburk 6-4, 6-1 in the first round.
She split sets with Indiana's Stephanie Reece,
but then the Hoosier gained control.
"She was chipping on my second serve and
was getting to the net before I was," Kurth
said. "I didn't really know what to do. I started
to come in on my second serve near the end."
But it was not enough as Reece took the
final set, 6-3.
Today Willens faces William and Mary's
Karen van der Merwe and Poruri meets
Kansas' Eveline Hamers at 9 a.m. Doubles
begin at 3 p.m. All matches are at Stanford
Tennis Stadium.
