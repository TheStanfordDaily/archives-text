# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
In the third set of a collegiate tennis
match, anything can happen. Especially
when the first two sets have been lopsided
wins for the two combatants, the final games
can be nerve-wracking. But this week's Ath
letes of the Week didn't show any signs of
nervousness â€” they just went and pounded
out big, clutch wins. Amy Chiminello and
Vimal Patel came through.

All year Chiminello has been getting
results for Stanford as she compiled a 22-3
overall record and a No. 71 national ranking.
She has played everywhere from the fourth
to the sixth singles spot for the Cardinal.
Chiminello, a freshman from Melrose,
Mass., went 3-0 this weekend in singles
matches at the No. 5 position for Stanford.
Thursday she pummeled Sharla Barone of
Ole Miss 6-1, 6-1, for her first NCAA tour
nament victory. She then showed real guts
in pulling out a three-set win against Cali
fornia's Lisa Parks 4-6, 6-1, 6-2.
But Chiminello displayed non-freshman
maturity Saturday in her match against
Texas' Carla Cossa, the No. 57 player in the
country. Cossa jumped all over Chiminello
in the first set to win easily, 6-1.
As it became clear that every match
would count in the nip-and-tuck battle
with the Longhorns, Chiminello put it all
together.
Knowing that her team needed her and
refusing to bow to the mounting pressure,
she went off on Cossa and won the next two
sets handily 6-2, 6-2.

No less versed in the art of stealing victo
ry from the jaws of three-set defeat is Vimal
Patel. In fact he took things to extremes in
Stanford's match against Duke when he
pulled out a 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) win over Willy
Quest. He saved several match points.
Patel nearly duplicated the feat the next
night against LSU as he defeated Steve
Vasquez 2-6, 6-4, 6-3.

Once again, however, it was in the clutch
contest when Patel really showed his stuff.
Haunted by memories of a 6-0 drubbing by
UCLA in Los Angeles, the Cardinal had a lot
to prove yesterday as they faced the Bruins
in the semifinals.
Patel played one of the smartest matches
of his career as he cruised past Robert
Janecek 6-3, 6-3, to help Stanford to an easy
5-1 win over the third-seeded Bruins.
