# At least they got a chance

Losing has a way of putting things in perspec
tive. Winning is easy because being happy
often takes little energy, but losing always
makes you think. After the women's tennis team
saw the NCAA title leave the Farm for the first time
since 1987, you can bet that every woman on that
team started thinking about what they could have
done differently.
if only I had hit that approach shot. . . if only that
lob had dropped ... if only . . . if only I had won
The coulda-woulda-shoulda syndrome is a natu
ral reaction to the disappointment of failed expecta
tions. Yet, without expectations, there would be no
disappointment. Coming into the season ranked
fifth, some were willing to give the 1991-92 Cardinal
the benefit of the doubt due to their six straight
titles, but few really thought they had what was
needed to bring home lucky number seven. Frank
Brennan and his squad- made believers out of the
tennis world when they put themselves into the
position to once again bring home the national title.
Unlike the majority of the women who play the
game on the collegiate level, the 10 players who
make up the Stanford tennis team gave themselves
the chance to be the best in the land. It hurts that

they came up short, but they were there.
And that is what is important.
It seems like an easy way out to give someone a
pat on the back and tell them "at least >'ou tried", yet
a story came to my ears a day or so ago that makes
me think that having the opportunity to try can be
more special than people give it credit. Losing is bad,
but not being able to compete may be the worst pain
of all.
Consider the case of a certain senior who also
plays baseball. This guy has been with the team
