# At least they got a chance

Losing has a way of putting things in perspec
tive. Winning is easy because being happy
often takes little energy, but losing always
makes you think. After the women's tennis team
saw the NCAA title leave the Farm for the first time
since 1987, you can bet that every woman on that
team started thinking about what they could have
done differently.
if only I had hit that approach shot. . . if only that
lob had dropped ... if only . . . if only I had won
The coulda-woulda-shoulda syndrome is a natu
ral reaction to the disappointment of failed expecta
tions. Yet, without expectations, there would be no
disappointment. Coming into the season ranked
fifth, some were willing to give the 1991-92 Cardinal
the benefit of the doubt due to their six straight
titles, but few really thought they had what was
needed to bring home lucky number seven. Frank
Brennan and his squad- made believers out of the
tennis world when they put themselves into the
position to once again bring home the national title.
Unlike the majority of the women who play the
game on the collegiate level, the 10 players who
make up the Stanford tennis team gave themselves
the chance to be the best in the land. It hurts that

they came up short, but they were there.
And that is what is important.
It seems like an easy way out to give someone a
pat on the back and tell them "at least >'ou tried", yet
a story came to my ears a day or so ago that makes
me think that having the opportunity to try can be
more special than people give it credit. Losing is bad,
but not being able to compete may be the worst pain
of all.
Consider the case of a certain senior who also
plays baseball. This guy has been with the team


T.C.
Hall
since freshman year and has got
ten some at-bats, but it was not
until this season that he heard
opportunity knock. This guy has
made the most out of the playing
time that he was given, and he
now stands as a considerable asset
to the team. Yet instead of worry
ing about how well he will play if
the Cardinal qualifies for the Col
lege World Series in Omaha, Neb.,
he now has to worry if he will even
be in the lineup.
The problem is not disciplinary,
but academic. Yet before anyone
gets the stereotype of the dumb
jock instilled in their brains, it
should be noted that this engineer
ing major has always taken the
"student" part of his student-ath
lete role quite seriously. No, the
problem is not his ability to com
plete his work to satisfaction, but
rather his ability to satisfy who he
is working for â€” his professor.
It appears that post-season
play conflicts with a certain test, a
test that the professor has decided
is important enough to keep our

hero home. This is a test that can
not be taken early, nor taken late.
It cannot be faxed, and if it is not
taken the student in question will
fail the course and not be able to
graduate.
Yes Virginia, there is blackmail
in academia.
Hopefully this is a situation that
will be solved, but what if it is not?
What if, after all these years of
waiting, our baseball friend is
denied the chance to hit the win
ning run? What if his nightmare is
not about what he could have,
would have or should have done
differently, but that he never got a
chance to do it in the first piace?
What would hurt more?
It is with this in mind that I can
look at a picture of Heather Wil
lens crying and feel proud that it
was done at the semi-finals of the
national championships instead of
in front of a TV watching someone
play the game she so badly wanted
for her own. The women's tennis
team has a right to feel sad, but
they must remember what they
are feeling sad about.
Not winning a national cham
pionship is much better than
being denied the dream of ever
playing for one.
