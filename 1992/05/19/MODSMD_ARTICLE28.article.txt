### Mike Langford Staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team
received some slightly surprising
but extremely welcome news yes
terday. As expected, the Cardinal
(37-21) was selected for a spot in a
regional, that being the South II
regional in Tallahassee, Florida.
However, Stanford didn't expect
to be seeded number one in the
regional, which is exactly where
the NCAA placed them.
Beginning Thursday and last
ing through Monday, the South II
regional is being hosted by the
second seeded Florida State Semi
noles (41-18). Seeded third are
the Georgia Bulldogs (35-23);
fourth the Kent State Golden
Flashes (44-11); fifth the Western
Carolina Catamounts (41-19-1);
and sixth the Stetson Hatters
(38-19), who will be the Cardi
nal's first opponent.
"Being seeded first is a real
advantage because first you play a
six seed, then you play a loser [of
a first-round game]," said Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess.
The entire Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division felt simi
lar satisfaction from the choices.
Of the six teams in the Six-Pac,

five were chosen to attend region
als. Arizona (34-21-1) is seeded
first at their home West regional
in Tucson, while cross-state and
conference rival Arizona State
(32-22) will be the fourth seed at
the Midwest regional in Wichita,
Kans.

'Being seeded first
is a real advantage
because first you
play a six seed.'
â€” coach Marquess

UCLA (34-24) is seeded fourth
at the Mideast regional in
Starkville, Miss, and the Califor
nia Golden Bears (34-24) will also
be seeded fourth at the East
regional in Gainesville, Fla.
Washington (37-19) of the Pacific
10 Conference Northern Division
was also selected as a sixth seed in
Tucson.
The only other conference that
will be represented by five teams
at regionals is the Southeastern
conference, those being Louisiana
State, Florida, Mississippi State,
South Carolina, and Georgia.
