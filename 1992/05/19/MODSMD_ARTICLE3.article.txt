# Funds for self-defense class threatened again
## Course may violate nondiscrimination policy

Funding for the popular Self Defense
for Women class is being threatened by
allegations that the class violates the Uni
versity's nondiscrimination policy by
excluding men.
The class, offered through SWOPSI for
the past 12 years, was scheduled to become
a feminist studies course in the fall
because of budget cuts.
But a feminist studies faculty member
says the former Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues class discrimi
nates on the basis of sex, according to
Senior Assoc. Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Carolyn Lougee.
Susan Epstein, coordinator of sexual
assault prevention education, said she
believes Stanford should solve the dilem
ma by making an exception to the policy
for the self-defense class or establishing a

separate course for men.
"Women are not comfortable talking
about personal experiences with men pre
sent," she said.
The Feminist Studies Program offered
to teach the class a few months ago, Epstein
said, and "Humanities and Sciences offered
to fund-raise the approximately $10,000
necessary."
However, Lougee said it is a "primary
issue" that the class not violate Stanford's
Nondiscriminatory Policy.
The policy states that "Stanford Univer
sity admits students of either sex ... to all
the rights, privileges, programs and activi
ties generally accorded or made available to
students at the University. It does not dis
criminate on the basis of sex ... in the
administration of its educational policies."
According to graduate student Kim
Hannula â€” a member of the self-defense
