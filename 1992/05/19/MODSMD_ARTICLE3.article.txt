# Funds for self-defense class threatened again
## Course may violate nondiscrimination policy 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Funding for the popular Self Defense
for Women class is being threatened by
allegations that the class violates the Uni
versity's nondiscrimination policy by
excluding men.
The class, offered through SWOPSI for
the past 12 years, was scheduled to become
a feminist studies course in the fall
because of budget cuts.
But a feminist studies faculty member
says the former Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues class discrimi
nates on the basis of sex, according to
Senior Assoc. Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Carolyn Lougee.
Susan Epstein, coordinator of sexual
assault prevention education, said she
believes Stanford should solve the dilem
ma by making an exception to the policy
for the self-defense class or establishing a

separate course for men.
"Women are not comfortable talking
about personal experiences with men pre
sent," she said.
The Feminist Studies Program offered
to teach the class a few months ago, Epstein
said, and "Humanities and Sciences offered
to fund-raise the approximately $10,000
necessary."
However, Lougee said it is a "primary
issue" that the class not violate Stanford's
Nondiscriminatory Policy.
The policy states that "Stanford Univer
sity admits students of either sex ... to all
the rights, privileges, programs and activi
ties generally accorded or made available to
students at the University. It does not dis
criminate on the basis of sex ... in the
administration of its educational policies."
According to graduate student Kim
Hannula — a member of the self-defense
collective that teaches the course
— the course has never formally

said we exclude men, but just that
it is aimed at women," she said.
"If a group of men showed up for
the class, we would have to let
them take it."
But "if we were to teach a class
aimed at both men and women, it
would become a very different
thing," she added.
"It would mean cutting out the
assertiveness (training) and the
readings."
And Epstein argued that she
would not recommend expanding

the class to men because women
are attacked for a different pur
pose than men — "with the intent
of rape." Also, women's bodies are
different, she said, and unique
self-defense approaches are
required.

requiring every academic course
to be taught by a lecturer or facul
ty member could be another
obstacle to offering the self
defense class through an academ
ic program.
"The class is taught by two
members of a collective. In the
past, there was a faculty sponsor,
but that sponsor did little if any
work," said Epstein. "There is no
need to pay someone to guarantee
the class goes on."
Budget cuts eliminated the

funding for both the course and
the entire Innovative Academic
Courses program. In February, a
group of about 20 students
stormed University President
Donald Kennedy's office and then
interrupted a meeting of the
Board of Trustees in an effort to
ihe University then said it
might be able to offer the course
through the Feminist Studies
Program, a part of Humanities
and Sciences.
Associate Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Anne Peck said
there is funding for the course in
Humanities and Sciences, but
would not specify if the amount
was large enough to cover the cost
of an added lecturer.
Peck said a series of meetings
are being planned to look for solu
tions to the problems facing the

course. Feminist Studies faculty,
Cowell Student Health Center,
the Women's Center Collective
and students will be involved, she
said.
It "would be brutal not to offer
one of the most popular courses
on campi! l ?." snid Epstein. "Over
up every quarter
lor iZ spots."
Annie Luetkemeyer, a sopho
more who was involved in Febru
ary's rally to save the course, said
she was upset at the mere
thought that Self Defense for
Women could be canceled.
"The class for me was incredi
ble," she said. "I can't imagine not
knowing those things and I can't
imagine other people not knowing
those things. The University has
a responsibility and a duty to
female students to pick it up and
offer classes like this."
