# Opponents beware: golfer Begay has arrived on the course
## 
### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
It all started because he
wouldn't stay out of the way.
When his son was six years
old, Notah Begay II needed to
think of something to keep the
youngster from pestering him
and his colleagues on their week
ly business golf trips. Utilizing

his most convenient resource,
Begay handed the boy a golf club;
14 years later, the kid still hasn't
handed it back.
Now, as a sophomore star of
the Stanford Cardinal men's golf
program, Notah Begay 111 looks
back fondly on his days as an
"annoying" sidekick in his home
town of Albuquerque, New Mexi
co. He knows that the spotlight is

trained directly upon him, how
ever, as he and his teammates get
set to do battle this Thursday
through Saturday in the NCAA
Western Regional Champi
onships at the Tucson National
Golf Club in Tucson, Ariz.
While the Cardinal is riding a
hot streak into this week's NCAA
Championship qualifier — one
that earned the squad its first

Pacific-10 Conference Champi
onship in 15 years three weeks
ago and which has placed Stan
ford among collegiate golfs elite
— its top performer has been red
hot since shortly after the team's
1977 crown.
It may be said in all truth that
golf came easily to Notah Begay.
At age eight, two years after
learning the game, he began play
ing in organized tournaments
with some success. Six years
later, at age 14, Begay traveled to
Denver, Colo., for his first nation
al junior tournament and took
home the first-place trophy. He
would duplicate three times in
four attempts that year.
"I had a feeling then that golf
was my sport," Begay said with
typical understatement.
That "feeling" must have
intensified as he enjoyed a pros
perous high school career, win
ning the New Mexico state indi
vidual championship in his junior
year and then defending his title
senior year while leading his
team to the top as well.
However, Begay's story as a
"natural" may not have had its
remarkable continuation here at
Stanford if were not for the
unusual interference of one John
Fields.
Fields, head golf coach at the
University of New Mexico, was
good friends with Begay during
his prep career and was looking
forward to making him an easy
recruit for the local Lobos
team.
In an uncommon act of kind
ness, though, Fields picked up
the phone one day in 1989 and
reached Stanford head coach
Wally Goodwin. He recommend
ed the relatively unheralded
Begay for the Cardinal program
and lauded Begay's academic

achievements as well as his golf
ing accolades.
"I had actually been thinking
of going to a straight golf school
up to that point," Begay said.
"It's good to see some honest peo
ple out there, though, who are
interested in the future of the
individual rather than just that
of their own team."
Begay, who is now studying for
a degree in economics, already
had Cardinal on his mind by the
time Goodwin made a home visit
in 1990, yet the "deal" that
brought him to California was
closed in almost as unusual a
manner as it was opened original
ly. His athletic versatility, which
enabled him to start on his high
school's basketball and soccer
teams, caught Goodwin's eye.
"I never actually saw him play
golf," Goodwin said. "But when I
saw him lead his school's basket
ball team to a second straight
state championship, I saw in
Notah a determination and will
way beyond his years. I knew
then that I wanted him on my
team."
Goodwin's current team —
which features Begay, senior
Christian Cevaer, junior Brad
Lanning, sophomore Casey Mar
tin, and freshman Steve Burdick
— is now aiming for poetic justice
this week in Tucson. If the fifth
seeded Cardinal finishes in the
top nine over the course of the
54-hole tournament, it will earn
the right to advance to the NCAA
Championship Tournament, to
be held June 3-6 in, of all places,
Albuquerque.
"It would mean a lot to play for
the NCAA Championship at
home," Begay said.
It will be no easy task to get
there considering the "home
course advantage" of the Arizona

schools and the presence of many
non-conference Rocky Mountain
schools who will be used to the
mile-high altitude.
He has the perfect name for
his team's present situation, as it
teeters on the edge of greatness:
Begay, whose ancestors were
New Mexico natives and who is
half Native-American himself,
has a first name, "Notah," that is
Navajo for "you're almost there."
In addition to being almost
home for an NCAA Champi
onship bid, Begay is equipped
with the almost-perfect competi
tive attitude. According to Good
win, Begay embodied the Cardi
nal team motto — "If you're not
fired with enthusiasm, you will
be" — when he promised the
coach a victory over former
NCAA Champion Phil Mickelson
at the Pac-10 meet earlier this
month.
"He said, 'I'm going to give
that guy something to remember
me by,'" Goodwin said.
Begay almost has the tools to
turn professional also, which is
his current aspiration after grad
uation. He is "the best putter"
coach Goodwin has ever seen, and
his short game is strong. In fact,
he used his skills just yesterday
in Santa Cruz to shoot the lowest
total — a six-under-par 136 —
through two rounds of the local
U.S. Open qualifier for next
month's PGA major event.
Even if he does not go pro,
however, he has made his mark
on the collegiate golf world in just
two years.
"I don't know if Notah will
make it big in golf, but he's going
to make it big," Goodwin said.
For now, though, other squads
just wish he would give that old
golf club back to his father and
stay out of their way.


Al Green — Daily fiie
Sophomore Notah Begay has had an impact on the Stanford men's golf program from day one. He is a
large part of why the Cardinal heads to NCAA Regionals this weekend as one of the favorites to quali
fy for Nationals.
