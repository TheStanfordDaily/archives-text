While the men's Olympic gymnastics squad
will not be selected until next month, Tim Ryan
and Jair Lynch looked ready to suit up for the
team after their performances at the USA
Championships in Columbus, Ohio last week
end.
Ryan, the 1989 NCAA individual champion,
placed third overall, while Lynch, 1991-92
Pacific 10 Conference Gymnast of the Year,
came in seventh in the 48-man invitational
field.
"The competition was particularly tough this
year, because everyone's gunning for the
Olympic team," said Stanford men's gymnastics
coach Sadao Hamada. "I was pleased with both
[Ryan and Lynch]."
Ryan took first in the rings competition, and
placed third on the high bar. The senior finished
fifth in both the floor exercise and the parallel
bars.

But what impressed Hamada most about
Ryan's performance was his consistency. "Tim
didn't miss in any of his routines," said the
coach. "Ryan was absolutely solid."
Lynch won both the parallel bar and high bar
competitions, but faltered a bit on the rings. Not
to worry, according to Hamada.
"Jair is physically a little weak on the rings
right now," he said. "But he's definitely improv
ing, and should be in good shape for the Trials."
Stanford's Mark Booth rounded out the Car
dinal's performance by finishing fifth on the
vault.
Although the Olympic Trials won't be held
until June 15-16 in Baltimore, the USA Cham
pionship scores of the 18 invited to the Trials
will count towards Olympic Team selection.
Athletes' scores from the two competitions will
be weighted and compared, with 30 percent of
the final number coming from USA Champi
onship scoring.
The top seven overall scorers will constitute
the Olympic squad.
