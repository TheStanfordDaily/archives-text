# Times to run faculty ad criticizing King verdict
## 
### John Ford Staff writer 
Voicing their condemnation of the Rod
ney King beating verdict, more than 700
Stanford faculty and staff have raised
$19,500 for two advertisements in The
New York Times.
The full-page ad decrying police brutality
and racial injustice will first appear in the
East Coast edition of tomorrow's New York
Times, then later in the West Coast edition.
The statement criticizes the verdict in
the Rodney King trial, but treats it as part
of a larger problem in American society.
Political Science Assoc. Prof. Terry Karl,
one of the coordinators for the project, said
the vast number of contributions represent
ed a "wonderful and empathetic human
response from the community." As far as she
knows, no other university has taken similar
action in response to the verdict, Karl said.
But medical student Ben Ortiz, who

heard about the ad on National Public
Radio, said he was appalled that "not one of
those 700 people could think of anything
better to do with their money" than get
their name printed in The New York Times.
"The idea of all this money going to an
adjust boggles my mind," he said. "I'll bet
a lot of community organizers could think
of things to do with $19,000."
Karl defended the ad, saying that
although some good may have come from
giving the money to local communities, it is
"more important to change the realloca
tion of funds" on the national level. Giving
money to the ad and to other causes are not
"mutually exclusive" actions, she added.
Political Science Prof. Lucius Barker
also disagreed, noting that "we are trying
to influence public opinion in order to
influence government policy."
