# Times to run faculty ad criticizing King verdict
## 
### John Ford Staff writer 
Voicing their condemnation of the Rod
ney King beating verdict, more than 700
Stanford faculty and staff have raised
$19,500 for two advertisements in The
New York Times.
The full-page ad decrying police brutality
and racial injustice will first appear in the
East Coast edition of tomorrow's New York
Times, then later in the West Coast edition.
The statement criticizes the verdict in
the Rodney King trial, but treats it as part
of a larger problem in American society.
Political Science Assoc. Prof. Terry Karl,
one of the coordinators for the project, said
the vast number of contributions represent
ed a "wonderful and empathetic human
response from the community." As far as she
knows, no other university has taken similar
action in response to the verdict, Karl said.
But medical student Ben Ortiz, who

heard about the ad on National Public
Radio, said he was appalled that "not one of
those 700 people could think of anything
better to do with their money" than get
their name printed in The New York Times.
"The idea of all this money going to an
adjust boggles my mind," he said. "I'll bet
a lot of community organizers could think
of things to do with $19,000."
Karl defended the ad, saying that
although some good may have come from
giving the money to local communities, it is
"more important to change the realloca
tion of funds" on the national level. Giving
money to the ad and to other causes are not
"mutually exclusive" actions, she added.
Political Science Prof. Lucius Barker
also disagreed, noting that "we are trying
to influence public opinion in order to
influence government policy."
Part of text reads:
"Police brutality and racial bias in
the justice system throw into
sharp relief deep and systemic
problems in the United States:
pervasive racism, the abandon
ment of our cities, the heartless
misallocation of federal and state
funds and the politics of depriva
tion."
The ad takes the form of an
American flag running vertically
on the In place of the 50
stars is a statement written by a
group of faculty members who
coordinated the advertisement,
including Karl, Barker and Politi
cal Science Prof. David Aber
nethy.
The names of the people who
each contributed a minimum of
$25 make up the stripes.
After tomorrow's appearance,
the ad is scheduled to run again in
the West Co&st edition either on
Friday or Monday after the
names of a few last-minute con
tributors are added.
Abernethy, who was on the

advertisement committee, said
the ad "makes a powerful visual
impact."
Remembering Vietnam War
protests in which the American
flag often was seen as a symbol of
aggressiveness, Abernethy said it
"is a positive move to put the flag
on the side of inclusive justice."
The statement in the adver
tisement calls for universities
around the country to address the
issues which have recently been
brought up.
"These problems threaten our
democracy," it says. "They must
be confronted. We call on our col
leagues in other colleges and uni
versities nationwide to address
these issues in their communi
ties."
The final sentence calls on vot
ers to "vote for candidates com
mitted to using our nation's
abundant resources in the service
of justice and equality."
Abernethy said the adver
tisement committee did not
have any candidates for office
in mind when they wrote the
passage, but wanted voters to
"make their own judgements"
on who to support.
