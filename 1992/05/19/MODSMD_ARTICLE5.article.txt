# 'Jane Roe' describes her abortion battle
## Panelists stress need for action to protect rights 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
At 21, Norma McCorvey was
homeless, pregnant and consid
ering suicide until she found two
lawyers looking to challenge
Texas laws prohibiting abortion.
Last night, McCorvey — Jane
Roe in the controversial 1973
Supreme Court case Roe vs.
Wade — shared her personal
nightmare with the mostly
female crowd of about 250 in
Cubberley Auditorium.
Joining her were Stanford
Law Prof. Deborah Rhode, Dr.
Kate O'Hanlan, a subspecialist
in gynecological cancers, and
Colleen Kelly, a volunteer direc
tor of the local chapter of the
California Abortion Rights
Action League.

case, McCorvey is still angry,

For McCorvey, her 23-year
battle with the issue of abortion
began in 1969 in Dallas, Texas.
She had "no money, no job and
nowhere to go," McCorvey said.
McCorvey said she spent five
days living in the women's
lounge of a Dallas bus station,
eating handouts from charitable
passers-by while deciding what

to do about her situation. At
that point she did not even
"know what the word for termi
nating pregnancy was," she said.
Around thus time, two young
lawyers interested in challenging
the status quo on the abortion
issue were looking for a plaintiff,
and McCorvey fit the bill.
Because her father was a
"Jehovah's Witness minister"

and her mother was "a devout
Catholic," McCorvey decided to
protect her anonymity and call
herself Jane Roe, she said.
Since McCorvey "stepped out
of the political closet" in a 1989
documentary and admitted she
had not been raped — before Roe
vs. Wade crying rape was the one
sure way to receive an abortion
— she has received hate mail

and has been shot at, she said.
However, McCorvey said she
felt "like a mountain had been
lifted" from her shoulders. She
now actively supports the pro
choice movement.
Before Roe vs. Wade, 1,000 to
10,000 women died each year
from illegal abortions, according

to Rhode. Today, the figures for
death from legal abortion is 1 in
200,000.
O'Hanlan said that seven
times as many women die from
carrying the baby full term as
from getting a legal abortion.
The panelists also mentioned
the limiting Roe vs. Wade
through legislation and the recent
court cases which are "chipping
away" at the structure of the
1973 decision.

For instance, in 1977 federal
funding was withdrawn from hos
pitals and a law was passed to pre
vent public hospitals from per
forming abortions.
"Men don't get pregnant,"
Kelly said. "They just pass laws."
If the pro-life contingency suc
cessfully strips away the right to
an abortion, O'Hanlan said,
women will mobilize under
ground — by teaching people to
use home abortion kits — in order
to ensure that women from all
socio-economic backgrounds can
have a safe abortion.
"And we will riot," she added
in a low, calm voice.
