# Plans being finalized for Terman annex
## Construction of building to start next March, finish 10 months later 
### Jeff Ota 
A $3.2 million Terman Engineering Building
annex featuring two unusually shaped class
rooms is now in its final planning stages, with
construction scheduled to start in March 1993.
The 10-month project, which will result in
a two-floor, 11,500-square-foot facility, will be
located between Terman and the neighboring
oak grove. It will complement Terman's
design, according to Alette Farrell, planning
manager for the School of Engineering.
She said the plans for the yet-unnamed
building have been revised several times in the
past seven years, but most of the changes
involved cuts in laboratoiy and office space
because the focus of the addition was to pro
vide "case-study classrooms."
Case-study classrooms are innovative semi
circular structures that are especially suited for
manufacturing classes since they allow students

to see each other and encourage discussion.
Farrell said the case-study classrooms have
always been the focus of the plans. Professors
have wanted the classrooms for a long time,
she said, since they currently only exist in the
Graduate School of Business.

Innovative, semi-circular
classrooms are planned.

Each of the two 3,500-square-foot case
study classrooms will seat 70 students. Dwain
Fullerton, a spokesperson for the School of
Engineering, said the format was designed
primarily for management and manufacturing
groups. Open discussion is essential to those
classes, he said.
The most recent version of the plans allows

one classroom to be converted into a perfor
mance hall, which would be available for pub
lic use.
An audio-visual control room will also occu
py the first floor of the building, as both class
rooms will have video cameras, microphones,
and monitors. A "smart products" design lab
oratory, a manufacturing-model laboratory
and a few offices will take up the second floor.
Planning for the structure began seven
years ago, but insufficient funding led to many
revisions and delays. In February, the School
of Engineering Board finally raised enough in
private donations to fund the current project
and approved the concept and site of the
annex. An additional $500,000 was raised to
endow the ongoing operations, maintenance,
and utilities costs of the structure.
Design and construction approvals will be
sought in September, and construction docu
ments should be complete by February 1993.
