# Two decades after her case: 'I felt like I'd been cheated'
## 
### Sara Skinner Staff writer 
Almost 20 years after the
events of her life were the cen
ter of the nation's attention,
Norma McCorvey — Jane Roe
of Roe vs. Wade — still gets
emotional when she speaks
about abortion.
Seated at the Coffee House
with a Dos Equis in her hand,
McCorvey pushed up the
sleeves of her black sweater
and talked adamantly, often
angrily, about her experiences
since Roe . vs. Wade and her
dedication to choice.
Even though she regularly
speaks around the country, she
said last night's speech as a
part of Choice Night brought
knots to her stomach.
"After I leave you folks and
I'm up in my room where no
one can hear me, I turn on the
shower and I cry," McCorvey
said. "That's how I don't have
a black cloud hanging over me
wherever I go."
McCorvey, who has a strong
Texas accent, said she was only
minimally involved in the actu
al trial of Roe vs. Wndo. "T iust
signed the papers
have a copy," she 112 .
The lawyers periodically
called to update her on case
developments, she said, but they
"might as well have been speak
ing Greek. ... I didn't even
know what a plaintiff was."
She had already given birth
and given her child up for adop
tion when she read in the Dal
las paper that the Supreme
Court had ruled in favor of
making abortions legal. Still,
she said that "I felt like I had
been cheated regarding my
reproductive options."
Until 1989, she remained
anonymous except for one
interview for a film documen
tary that was never widely

released. On April 4, 1989, she
was shot and wounded at her
home in a drive-by shooting.
Then she told herself,
"Norma, I think you're out...
you might as well stay out."
She said she has little fear
about being a public figure
because "they're going to find
me anywhere."
"Pro-choice gives you ener
gy," she said, waving her fist.
"Yes!"
Her enthusiasm for the pro
choice movement was apparent
when she saw the poster adver
tising Choice Night that was
hung on the Tresidder staircase.
"Just Say Roe," she said. "I
love it. I want it to take home
with me. That would be so
cool." She said she plans to
hang it on her bedroom wall
along with every button, flyer,
and name tag she has collected
from her speaking engage
ments. "That should fill up all
the blank space," she said,
rolling up the huge poster.
Although she has been the
target of anger in her home
state of Texas, primarily from
clergy, McCorvey said Califor
ninns 1 ive shown "understand
!r ' and far and abn
iiK can of uuty, support."
In her speeches, she describes
not only her attempts to abort,
which included eating peanuts,
drinking castor oil and throwing
herself down the stairs, but also
her thoughts of suicide.
She said she went to a
defunct Dallas clinic looking
for an illegal abortion, and
despite the dried blood and
cockroaches on the floor, still
continued looking for someone
to give her an abortion.
Citing statistics about the
numbers of illegal abortions
performed before Roe v. Wade,
McCorvey said, "Obviously,
abortion will continue whether
it is legal or not."
