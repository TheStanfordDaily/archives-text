Citizens in hotel beaten in Thai crackdown
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) â€” Blood caked the marble floor of
the Royal Hotel's lobby as doctors frantically operated on scores
of gunshot and beating victims after midnight Monday.
At dawn, the hotel's role as a haven ended. Soldiers charged
into the building and dragged out 2,000 Thais who had fled army
gunfire. The troopers kicked down doors, going room to room
through the four-story, 297-room hotel, grabbing protesters and
binding their hands behind them.
With rifle butts and kicks, the soldiers forced them into the
street on their hands and knees and hustled them into military
trucks to be driven away.
Earlier, the wounded were treated atop wooden dining tables
in the hotel and the dead were pushed into a corner to make way
for the living.
At least 18 people have been killed and 380 wounded since an
uprising began Sunday, fueled by rising resentment of military
interference in politics. It was followed by a harsh army crack
down in the worst political violence in Thailand in 16 years.
Troops fired M-16 rifles Monday night at demonstrators out
side the Royal Hotel after they screamed taunts and charged
motorcycles into barricades thrown across Rajdamnern Avenue
to block the protest's advance on the Democracy Monument and
government buildings.
Protest rallies have drawn businessmen, professionals, work
ers, students and academics, and the violence was certain to
polarize Thailand for some time.
