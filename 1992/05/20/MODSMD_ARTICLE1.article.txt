# Phone book surplus won't pay for assault response job
## ASSU deemed too unstable 
### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
Amid fears that the ASSU is "falling apart," University
officials have decided to fund a new $50,000 sexual assault
response position themselves rather than turn money over
to the student government.
Dean of Students Michael Jackson said a proposal to give
the ASSU surplus funds from the Stanford Directory was
dropped in favor of a "more stable plan" — using money
from his office to hire a part-time professional with a mas
ter's degree for two years.
Under a scheme proposed earlier this quarter, the Direc
tory — currently administered by Jackson's office — would
have become an ASSU business project so his office could
avoid paying taxes on the surplus revenues.
Jackson said the sexual assault response professional
will be hired with money freed up when two residence staff
positions were combined.

According to Susan Epstein,
the ASSU's coordinator for sexu
al assault prevention education,
the new person's duties have yet
to be determined. Epstein's full
time position was paid for by a
one-year ASSU special project
which ends next month.
The new position will not be
funded with Directory money
because the administrators
involved "became nervous that
the ASSU was falling apart,"
Epstein said.
The election of the"I Prefer
Not to Have a COP" slate and a
current proposal to distribute
most of the senate's reserves
directly to students made Univer
sity officials "nervous" about giv
ing money to the ASSU, accord
ing to outgoing Council of Presi
dents member John Overdeck.
"The University doubts the
ASSU can handle [the Directory],
and frankly, I don't blame them,"
said Overdeck, who worked with
administrators on the possible
transfer. When the plan was first
proposed, he estimated the phone
book's surplus revenues to be
between $40,000 and $45,000.

Nanci Howe, director of student activities, said her office
was "concerned" about the proposal to give funds to the
ASSU. "We may still transfer the Directory in the future,"
she said. "But at this time, there are just too many ques
tions to answer in too short a time period."
According to Howe, funds from the phone book will con
tinue to be used for Lake Lagunita and other projects. But
the University may have to pay a yet-undetermined
amount of tax on the Directory's surplus funds.
The change in funding for the position will be accompa
nied by some redefinition of roles of people involved in sex-

ual assault prevention and
response, according to adminis
trators.
Jackson said funds from the
Coalition Against Sexual Assault's
$40,000 special fee request — orig
inally intended for hiring someone
to replace Epstein — could be used
instead to increase the profession
al's position to full-time or to hire
a graduate student to support the
new person.
He said the person in the newly
funded position will work closely
with Carol Pertofsky, director of
Cowell's Health Promotion Pro
gram.

According to Epstein, there will
"definitely be a different configu
ration" to the way sexual assault
staffing is set up next year.
She said her responsibilities
may be divided into two or more
peoples' roles: the professional will
likely deal with "coordination of
staff and involvement with Univer
sity policy," while the staff funded
by the special fee will do "the daily
prevention education work."
