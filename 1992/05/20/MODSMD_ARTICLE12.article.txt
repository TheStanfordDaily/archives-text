## A 						new McCarthyism 
### 
Discrimination against
gays highlights urgent
need for civil rights bill

A DIFFERENT KIND OF
McCarthyism seems to be
rearing its ugly head in this
country today — only now the
witch hunt is being aimed at indi
viduals suspected of being homo
sexual instead of "communist."
According to last Thursday's
New York Times, a gay employee
of the Federal Emergency Manage
ment Agency has revealed that he
was coerced into supplying his
superiors with a list of other
homosexual employees.
The fact that this information
was sought to help identify "poten
tial security risks" is preposterous.
The director of the agency, Wal
lace Stickney, chose to defend the
actions of his security team in this
case. What renders this blatant
violation of civil rights shocking is
that it seems to be sanctioned and
condoned publicly.
In another symptomatic incident,
Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt signed leg
islation last week preventing gay stu
dent groups from receiving any pub
lic money. They were also prohibited
from using buildings at state univer
sities for meetings or other purposes.
Homosexuality is also institu
tionally damned in the armed
forces and leads to dismissal.

The argument used by the Pen
tagon for years had been similar to
FEMA's — that gays represented a
security threat. They could be
blackmailed by foreign govern
ments, said the official line.
The Pentagon's discriminatory
policy remains in place despite
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's
recent concession that there is no
reason to believe that gays are
more vulnerable to blackmail than
any one else.
The Defense Department now
emphasizes a long-held position that
"homosexuality is incompatible with

military service." Fighting along
side gay men would sap morale, the
fallacious argument runs.
The Supreme Court, another
revered public institution, views
homosexuality as being akin to
membership in a voluntary organi
zation. If the government's argu
ments are deemed "rational" by
the Court, then discrimination
against gays and lesbians is
allowed to be legally justified.
The process of marking gays in
the work place with the intent to dis
criminate is shameful, and reveals
an inordinate exercise of power.
We need a comprehensive civil
rights bill for gay rights which
would enable victims of discrimi
nation all over the country, in both
the public and private sectors, to
apply for redress.
The scenario around gay rights is
not bleak by any means. As part of a
newly-defined political agenda for
the '90s, gay-rights groups like
Queernation, and its Stanford coun
terpart Queerland, demonstrate
new and effective political tools, like
the use of parody.
The Queerland Carnival last
Thursday, which opposed the
"Homosexuality 101" program's
"former lesbian" speaker, was a
superb non-violent protest. It did
not have the dogmatic flavor that
afflicts so many '60s tactics when
adopted by protesters today.
Many of the pink-balloon-toting
protesters were unwilling to hiss
at opinions they despised. Instead,
they applauded whenever the
speaker used the word "gay,"
throwing the speaker off guard.
And just two days ago, respond
ing to firm pressure from House of
Representatives member Barney
Frank, FEMA claimed to have
destroyed its list of gay employees.
Frank was scheduled to hold a hear
ing on the incident, but has post
poned it temporarily.
Despite the repressive environ
ment that gay, lesbian and bisexual
individuals have to confront daily,
there is also an emerging sense of
hope in audacious strategies that
confront this state of siege.
