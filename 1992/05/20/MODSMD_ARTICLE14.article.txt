## A 						common playing field 
### 
I LOVE FOOTBALL. No, I'm not one
of those fanatical fans who has Astro
Turf for underwear. In fact, I would
be hard-pressed to name all the twenty
some-odd football teams in the NFL.
I love playing football. The sport has
left me with a slew of indelible memories
and a plethora of poignant lessons.
I more than realize that listening to
retired jocks talk about their past "glory"
days is about as riveting as a root canal.
Besides, the stories contain about as
much truth as an issue of the National
Enquirer (anyone want to hear my rendi
tion of how we really beat Notre Dame?).
So, I'll spare you the "scintillating" sen
sationalism and instead delve into the
deeper didactic domain of football.
I often hesitate in telling people I
played football. I guess because I never
know what type of reaction I'll get. Some
view athletes with a flattering sense of
awe, while others seem to view us as mus
cle-brained, anti-academic, coddled, red
scooter-driving mutants who tip-toed
past the admissions dean in our quarter
inch cleats.
Well, the truth is that there are ball
players who fit just about every descrip
tion imaginable. There are the ones who
truly evoke a sense of awe, as does any
one who achieves excellence in their field
(pun intended), and then there are people
like me, who end their career evoking
more of an "aww, shucks — maybe next

life."
The Stanford football team epitomizes
the phrase "mixed bag." We have Latino
and white players, brilliant and academi
cally challenged players. We have conser
vatives and liberals. We even have surfer
dudes from Southern California and
down brothers from Brooklyn, New York.
From this amalgam of students I have
come to one imperative conclusion: Any
one can become a trusted friend; howev
er, under the right set of circumstances,
that same person can become a bitter
enemy. The foremost challenge in life,
therefore, is in looking beyond circum
stance.
I love all the guys on the team. When I
am among them, I am infused with a
unique sense of power, purpose and
potential. Ninety men from strikingly dif
ferent backgrounds, joined together on
common ground struggling for a mutual
goal. Our differences adding to our
strength — a strength believed to be
boundless.
(My extrapolation from this point may
be obvious, but please indulge me.)
I always believed that if we as people
could escape this archaic idea of rugged
individualism — me against them — and
instead pursue an idea of enlightened
self-interest — me with them — our soci
etal potential would also be boundless.
Just as a game involving large men
bumping into each other at high speeds

could bind 90 hearts together, so too
are there numerous issues which can
tie us all together. For example, it is
axiomatic that spending pennies now
on inoculating children would save our
government (us) dollars later in medi
cal costs. However, thousands upon
thousands of kids go without inocula
tions each year.
Do we lack the vision to see our many
common playing fields? It may sound as if
I am spouting dreamy desires, but I real
ly believe in the importance of fantasy.
Dreams are my only guarantees of future
achievement and without them I am
chained to the narrow realm of certitude.
So please allow me to dream on.
The economic and sociological indica
tors for the future of America Eire becom
ing bleak. Our economic and human cap
ital desperately need revitalization. We
must re-conceptualize our idea of self
interest by first understanding our
mutual dependency.
Allow me to end with the hackneyed
words of an old football coach. "TEAM:
Together Everyone Achieves More."

Cory does not advocate a football player
theme house. What are the Delts for?


'The fore
most chal
lenge in life
is in looking
beyond cir
cumstance.'
