Thoughtful voting urged for California Senate race

IAM WRITING in response to Ari
Richter's May 18 column on Senate
candidate Barbara Boxer's recent
visit to Stanford. Richter's rationale for
dropping his support of Boxer strikes me
as somewhat shallow.
First, he argues that Boxer spoke "as
if gender was the only reason to vote for
her." Yet Richter has read Boxer's cam
paign literature. He knows she has taken
strong positions on a variety of issues.
Although so-called "women's issues"
like abortion, domestic violence, child
care and the election of more women to
Congress are central to her campaign,
Boxer has outlined many other "specific
goals," including universal health cover
age, full funding of Head Start, a five
year, 50 percent cut in defense spending
and tougher regulations on automobile
emissions.
Boxer's speech last Friday was 15
minutes long, and it was sponsored by a
number of women's organizations on
campus. It is thoroughly inaccurate to

imply — as Richter did — that such a
short, targeted speech somehow repre
sents Boxer's entire campaign.
Boxer and opponent Leo McCarthy
(and to a lesser extent Mel Levine) agree
on many of the fundamental issues of
this campaign. Both are essentially solid
liberals.
One of the main differences between
Boxer and McCarthy is, in fact, gender.
Boxer's message is not that her gender
is the primary reason to vote for her, but
rather that her gender is an added rea
son to vote for her. And given the fact
that there are 98 men and two women in
the U.S. Senate, electing women is no
small matter.
But is Boxer as qualified as her two
opponents? Based on her less-than
enlightening response to his question on
university research, Richter has decided
that she is not.
He is right to be concerned. Eight
years of Ronald Reagan left many of us
wary of politicians who are not knowl-

edgeable enough to tackle specific issues.
Boxer's poor response is disheartening,
but put her performance into context. She
was in a hurry to get to her next appear
ance and was about to be converged upon
by a group of journalists, aides and sup
porters. Is Richter certain that McCarthy
or Levine would have performed better
given the same circumstances?
As a candidate for the U.S. Senate,
Boxer must be prepared to answer ques
tions on any one of thousands of issues,
from tax plans and interest rates to the
START treaty and nuclear proliferation
to CFC's and global warming.
If Richter was expecting a perfect
candidate, he was bound to be disap
pointed. ALL candidates have to fudge
on the spot. NO ONE gives coherent,
thoughtful answers off-the-cuff all of the
time — McCarthy and Levine included.
None of this is an excuse for a poor
response. Of course Boxer should have
made a better response, and if she
repeatedly comes up with empty answers

like those reported in Richter's column,
she certainly does not deserve Richter's
(or my) vote. A long trail of shallow
answers (Ross Perot comes to mind) is
undoubtedly a cause for concern.
But I have heard Boxer give thought
ful and articulate responses to questions
on a number of occasions, and Richter
himself writes that he has been
impressed with her a number of times.
So why change his mind so abruptly
based on her answer to one question?
Before voting for McCarthy or Levine
based on a single instance, Richter
should be convinced that Barbara Boxer
is regularly uninformed or unprepared.
And he had better be certain that
McCarthy or Levine can consistently
perform better in a similar context.
Michael Jordan missed a couple of key
shots in the playoffs last week. But I still
didn't bet on the Knicks. Did you, Ari?
