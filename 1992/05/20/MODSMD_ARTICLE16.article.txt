						naturalist's worry: Don't feed the bears
## 
### 
I would like to respond to Nat
Cousins' article, "Bear hunting, and
searching for 'EC'" in the May 13 issue
of The Daily.
In his article Cousins says,"I wasn't
hunting bears with a gun (that's illegal
in Yosemite), but with a scrumptious
chocolate chip granola bar. My purpose
wasn't to kill, but to make friends with a
furry creature."
Regardless of how admirable his pur
pose might have been, Cousins might as
well have brought a gun.
Feeding a bear in a National Park is
one of the surest ways to kill that bear.
Once a bear learns that humans are a
good source of food it becomes a problem

bear and will eventually be destroyed.
Luckily, Cousins was not successful
in his hunt, but as a black bear lover I
am angered by the fact that he could
have killed one of these animals.
I hope that from now on, Cousins will
make an effort to protect these animals
he wishes to befriend and take appropri
ate action to prevent them from acquir
ing his camping food.
