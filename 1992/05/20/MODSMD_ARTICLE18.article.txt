# Adulation heaped on Davis is unwarranted

### 
The adulation heaped on Angela
Davis by Daily reporters and columnists
conveniently ignored many of her proud
est accomplishments.
Professor Davis is the 1979 recipient
of the Lenin Peace Prize, was a longtime
member of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party, was twice the Vice-
Presidential candidate of the Communist
Party and has been honored as an enthu

siastic supporter of homicidal revolution
aries in The People's Republics of Cuba,
Mozambique, Vietnam and Berkeley.
And we should be appalled that
William F. Buckley is speaking at Stan
ford because he's an extremist?
