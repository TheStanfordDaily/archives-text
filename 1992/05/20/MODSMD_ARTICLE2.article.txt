# Anti-gay ROTC policy questioned by Kennedy
## Signs ACLU petition 'as individual' 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
University President Don
ald Kennedy has personally
endorsed an American Civil
Liberties Union effort to end
the U.S. military's policy
against admitting gays and les
bians.
Kennedy last week signed a
petition in response to the
ACLU's letter asking universi
ty administrators to examine
whether ROTC's presence on
their campuses is consistent
with their institutions' non
discriminatory policies.
However, Kennedy empha
sized that he "signed as an
individual" and not as a repre
sentative of the University.
"I can't obviously speak for
the entire institution on a mat
ter like this," he said. "We
never do that."
While Stanford does not
have an ROTC program on

campus, it participates in pro
grams based at other local uni
versities, including Santa Clara
University, San Jose State
University and UC-Berkeley.
Stanford also provides
scholarships for ROTC partici
pants and allows the ROTC
program free use of University
facilities.
For example, freshmen and
sophomore Army recruits occa
sionally train on Stanford's
track and in the Foothills,
according to Capt. Chuck Web
ster of the ROTC affiliate at
Santa Clara.
They also attend classes on
campus once a week, he said.
Eleanor Feingold, coordina
tor of the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center,
said she is "very pleased" that
Kennedy signed the ACLU's
petition.
Many of Stanford's gay, les
bian and bisexual students disap
prove of the University sponsor
ing and funding ROTC programs
because they discriminate against
individuals on the basis of sexual
orientation.
Stanford's "Statement of Non-
Discriminatory Policy" says the
University "does not discriminate
. . . in the administration of its
educational policies, admissions
policies, scholarships and loan
programs, and athletic and other
University-administered pro
grams."
While Kennedy's personal
endorsement of the ACLU's stand

does not directly affect the Uni
versity, it does help advance its
efforts, according to ACLU staff
assistant Nancy Tenney.
Feingold said Kennedy's sign
ing the petition is "a small contri
bution to a large cause," adding,
"It would be wonderful to get
Stanford as an institution" to
respond actively to the military's
policy.
The Dean of Students' Work
ing Group on Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Students' Needs plans to
address how Stanford should
respond to the military's policy in
upcoming discussions, according
to Bobbi Braden, the group's
chair.
"It will be one of the major
points of discussion" in the fall,
she said.
