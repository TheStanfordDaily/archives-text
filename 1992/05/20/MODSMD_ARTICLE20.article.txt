## Responding to subtle racism in police force 
### 
Mr. Perozziello asked us to "think"
before we label the police department as
being racist for pulling over or con
fronting people with pigment around
campus when they have done nothing
wrong, because it happens to whites, too.
It is not necessarily us who need to
"think," but you who need to ask: Ask
us what we mean by the accusation of
racism among police.
First of all, I thoroughly agree with your
statement that everyone has to deal with
being wrongly accused. Law breakers do
not wear a scarlet letter for the police to see
who is guilty and who is innocent. They are
bound to confront the innocent at times.
Plenty of cases exist when a police officer
has wrongly confronted a white male as a
criminal only to find he or she has the
wrong person. This is not limited only to
people with pigment, as you pointed out.
However, this is not the issue, but an
oversimplification. We need to make a
comparison at three points. First, how
often people with pigment are wrongly

confronted compared to whites, and sec
ond, under what conditions. Third, and
most important, how each group is
addressed in comparison.
Lacking the statistics of a formal sur
vey, my informal survey of looking to see
who a police officer usually confronts
reveals a disparity. While blacks and
Hispanics make up significantly less
than a majority around campus, they are
significantly the majority of the people I
see being confronted.
You may throw out my observations
for not being scientific enough or being
biased: "I am looking for it." Regardless,
I ask that you observe for yourselves and
draw your own conclusions.
To compare the more important aspect
of differing conditions under which peo
ple are confronted, let's look at how often
people are confronted when an all points
bulletin has not been filed. How often
does an officer single out whites to show
their Stanford ID at Lake Lagunita but
not ask the blacks around? How often are
whites followed through a store to see if
they are stealing something?
Again, I am sure it happens, but not
at the same ratio as the population
breakdown. Under the same conditions,

people with pigment are asked to show
they are not doing something wrong
more often than whites.
Furthermore, it is how people with
pigment are addressed. When an APB
was put out describing a prowler, why is
it that the black — like Cory Booker or
A 1 Joyner — had guns pulled on them
while the white — Eric Perozziello —
did not, when each "fit the description."
Granted, I am sure police have erro
neously pulled a gun on or humiliated
whites, but the number of times it hap
pens to people with pigment far outweighs
their numbers in the population. Why?
You may wish to call this something
other than racist, but you are only beat
ing around the bush. Racism today often
is not as clearcut and blatant as the
racist attitudes and acts in America
through the 19605.
We cannot regularly point to a black
man hanging from a tree to point out
racism at work, but this is not the only
form in which racism manifests itself.
Though we can still point to cross-burnings
and lynchings by American neo-Nazis as
conscious expressions of racism even today,
it is most often subconsciously expressed in
more subtle, but just as powerful, ways.

Police in general stop and hostily
address people with pigment more often
than whites before all the facts have been
gathered. These officers — whether sub
consciously or not — pre-judge different
ly based on one's skin color and act on it.
This is racist, unless pre-judging based
on one's race no longer defines racism.
