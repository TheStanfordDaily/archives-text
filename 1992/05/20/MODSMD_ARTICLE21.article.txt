# Charging for The Daily will help environment

Stanford's commitment to recycling is
commendable. However, it appears that
the misguided focus is on maximizing the
amount of recycled material rather than
minimizing comsumption. A conspicuous
source of waste is The Daily. Spent
copies of the paper litter the grounds and
stuff recycling bins and garbage cans
across the campus each day.
One measure the paper could take to
reduce the problem would be to refuse to
distribute advertising inserts and addi
tional student magazines with the paper.
Those who want to read The Daily usu

ally immediately discard them.
Despite the obvious financial incentives
for The Daily to include them, it should
feel morally compelled to refuse the whole
sale contribution to waste they represent.
Another problem is The Daily's
overdistribution. The root of the problem
is that the paper is free. People who trav
el from place to place often go through
several copies of the paper in a day, dis
carding each to avoid carrying it along.
Others will take a paper from a distri
bution stack, glance at it for a few min
utes and then toss it into a nearby trash
or recycling bin. Clearly if there were
financial incentive to avoid this behavior
it would be less common.
Even a nickle per copy charge would go
a long way toward encouraging reuse. The
price would need to cover the added cost
of installing and maintaining coin-operat
ed newspaper boxes, but the motives for
their use are so compelling that the added
cost and effort are easily worth it.
The Daily's editorial board frequently
takes moral stands on public issues. It is
time for it to let its actions speak along
with its words.
