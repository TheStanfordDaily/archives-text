"The University doubts
the ASSU can handle (the
Stanford Directory], and
frankly, I don't blame
them."
â€” Council of Presidents
member John Overdeck, on
why administrators decided
not to turn over surplus
funds from the phone book
to the ASSU Senate. The
election of "I Prefer Not to
Have a COP" and a bill to
distribute most of the senate
reserves has left them fear
ing that the student govern
ment is too-unstable,
Overdeck said. See story,
