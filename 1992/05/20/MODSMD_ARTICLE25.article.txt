## Andeberhan says he might leave for Harvard 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
Berhane Andeberhan, the Stanford women's soccer coach
for five years, is considering an opportunity to coach the
men's team at Harvard University.
Andeberhan has yet to reach a final decision, but he
expects to make an announcement about it within the next
few days.
"I am currently in the middle of some serious discussions
with both Stanford and Harvard," he said. "I have come close
to making a decision because I don't want to keep either pro
gram waiting."
Before he chooses, though, Andeberhan said he will have
to take into account a number of important factors.
"I will have to talk it over with my wife. I am really deal
ing with two people's lives," he said. "I've got to consider
some personal, family, and professional factors."
Although this information may come as a surprise to
many, Andeberhan said that he has been exploring other
opportunities for a period of many weeks.
"I have been looking at all my options, and the Harvard
job was the one that materialized," he said.
Many of the team members were stunned by the fact that

their coach might leave, but they were also quick to offer him
their best wishes.
"We were all pretty surprised," said sophomore Sarah
Rafanelli. "However we all completely support him because
we understand what he is going through."
Andeberhan originally competed with ninety other appli
cants for the Harvard job, and he found out a few weeks ago
that he was one of a select few still in the running. Last Fri
day he was informed that he had been offered the coaching
spot.
If he does choose to leave Stanford, the team will clearly
lose one of the biggest factors for the resurgence of the
women's program.
When Andeberhan took the Cardinal coaching position in
1987, he inherited a team with a record of three wins, 12
losses, and one tie. Just two years later the squad did a com
plete turnaround en route to a final performance of 13 victo
ries, four defeats, and two ties.
The 1991 campaign was a landmark season for the Cardi
nal as they compiled an impressive record of seventeen wins
and only two losses and finished with a top five national
ranking.
Clearly, Andeberhan's departure could threaten the
future success of the team.

"He's one of the greatest coaches around and I'm not sure
if they could replace him with anyone of similar quality," said
freshman Amanda Tyler.
Rafanelli expressed similar concerns about having to play
under a new coach.
"It might be a little tough to get used to a new coach and
for him to get used to our system in such a short period of
time. I hope Andeberhan doesn't leave. He's done a lot for
our program," she said.
Along with his successful coaching tactics, Andeberhan
has also been instrumental in increasing the squad's finan
cial support from the athletic department.
"Because of our coach's hard work the women's soccer
program has finally received full funding from the school,"
said Rafanelli.
"In addition, he's been pulling for the athletic department
to offer a greater number of scholarships."
Most of the team members are upset that their coach may
leave, and Andeberhan appears reluctant to separate from
them as well.
"Leaving my team is the biggest concern for me," he said.
"It's hard for me to visualize not coaching them next year.
"Whether I stay here or not, I want to make sure the team
is in good shape and continues to go forward."
