# Seniors end career on high note with three rings
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Head tennis coach Dick Gould
refers to seniors Alex O'Brien and
Jason Yee as his "bookends."
O'Brien plays No. 1 and Yee plays
No. 6. In between, are a bunch of
sophomores who do not have the
experience, or often the' consisten
cy, of their elders. Yesterday, the
sophomores carried their share of
the load and helped the seniors

capture one last title before leaving
the Farm.
"This has been an amazing
year," Yee said. "It's been a long
five years and I've been through a
lot with these guys. It's exciting to
finish it off this way. This is all I
came back for this year."
Winning the national title dur
ing their final year of eligibility was
the frosting on the cake of two out
standing Cardinal tennis careers.
The pair has already been part of

national championship teams dur
ing their freshman and sophomore
seasons, but this year's title is dif
ferent because the team did not
overwhelm their opponents with
talent, as past Card squads had.
"When I came in we were the
best at winning big (5-4) matches,"
O'Brien recalled. "That helped us
win NCAAs because we pulled out
matches in the clutch when other
teams couldn't. Our sophomore
year we just totally dominated."
Last year, the Card probably
sported one of the best lineups in
team history. Yet, the national
title eluded them, much to the
team's dismay. Stanford lost to
USC, 5-2, in the semifinals. "I
thought we'd win for sure,"
O'Brien said, "but that just goes to
show, you can never predict
what'll happen."
No one could have predicted the
outcome of this year's tournament,
which probably makes the win
even more special to the seniors,
who thought they would end their
collegiate careers with only two
national titles.
En route to their three NCAA
rings, the pair has made many
impressive showings in post-sea
son play. His freshman year,
O'Brien was a doubles semifinalist
with partner Jeff Tarango.
As sophomores, O'Brien and
Yee, ranked No. 4 in doubles,
reached the quarterfinals of the
doubles draw. During their junior
year, the duo went undefeated in
dual matches and O'Brien reached
the semifinals of the singles draw.
Overall, both seniors could not
be happier right now. "This was
exactly what I wanted to do,"
O'Brien said. "This is a great way to
end."
Yee agreed: "It's been a fun cou
ple of years. This is a great way to
end a tennis career."
