# Poruri advances to NCAA semis as others stumble
## One more singles, two doubles fall 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
No. 3 seed Laxmi Poruri was
the only Stanford women's tennis
player to survive the second day of
individual competition at the
NCAA Championships.
Teammates Heather Willens,
Kylie Johnson and Emma Wood
house were eliminated in middle
round action.
Poruri edged Kansas' Eveline
Hamers in the third round 3-6, 7-
5, 6-3 and squeaked by William
and Mary's Julie Shiflet in the
quarterfinals 7-5, 6-4.
Poruri pressured Shiflet by
attacking her forehand.
"I went to the forehand to open
up the backhand," Poruri said.
"Then I could drop shot and fiddle
around that side."
Besides touch shots, Poruri
beat her opponent with strong
ground strokes.
"The crosscourt shot set her up
to rip the down the line," said
assistant coach Lele Forood. "Shi
flet couldn't cover it."
The Cardinal sophomore avoid
ed making too many errors against
the No. 8 seed. She said consisten
cy was important when playing
Shiflet.
"A lot of players lose to her
because they get impatient," she
said.
"Popeye attacked just enough
and just well enough to win a close
two-setter," Forood said.
No. 1 seed Shannan McCarthy
of Georgia is Poruri's adversary in
today's noon semifinal.
Besides the two singles matches
yesterday, Poruri also had a dou
bles contest. She and Willens met
Miami's Paula Iversen and Mari
ette Verbruggen in the second
round.
The Cardinal pair took an early
3-0 lead but then the contest took
a turn for the worse.
Poruri was fighting exhaustion
and cramps, which had slowed her
at the end of her second singles
match. Also, with all the running
she did during singles, the sopho
more injured her big toe. "It hurts
to move forward, anytime I put
pressure on it," she said. Although
the bloody, swollen digit was
wrapped and Poruri took
painkillers, her mobility was cur
tailed.
'The Hurricanes roared back to
capture the first set, 6-4. Willens
and Poruri again built a 3-0 edge in
the second and again they lost the
lead. Willens tried to rally Poruri

and absorb some of her load by
taking most of the balls up the
middle, but it was to no avail.
Miami won 6-3.
While the loss surprised some of
the Cardinal faithful, even Willens
had difficulty explaining the
defeat.
"I (tried to take more balls) but
there's only so much you can do,"
she said. "I wasn't even playing
well on my half of the court and
then she was in pain . .. I'm not
really sure what happened."
The match ended Willens' sea
son as No. 2 seed Lisa Raymond
had eliminated her in the singles
quarterfinal earlier in the day. The
Stanford junior grabbed an early
break in the first set but the Gator
came back to win 7-5. In the sec
ond, Raymond played virtually
error-free tennis to roll 6-1.
Willens beat William and
Mary's Karen van der Merwe 6-4,
7-5 to advance to the quarterfinals.
While Willens' doubles defeat
finished her season, Johnson's
Stanford career ended when she
and Woodhouse lost to No. 3 seed
Deborah Edelman and Stephanie
Reece of Indiana.
The Cardinal duo played a
tough first set but the Hoosiers
pulled it out, 6-4. In the second,
Johnson and Woodhouse stepped
up their game to take a 5-2 lead.
"They were very sharp —
returned well and came up with
some clutch shots," Forood said.
But, like Willens and Poruri,
they couldn't keep the advantage.
The Indiana tandem swept the
next five games to nail down the
victory, 6-4, 7-5.
"We just didn't put it away,"
Johnson said. "It was a one per
cent difference. We didn't put
away a couple of balls. We needed
to play to win instead of playing
not to lose. We waited for them to
make errors."
As the senior gathered her rac
quets and exited the court, she
realized it was for the final time.
"I walked off and said, 'Oh,'"
she said.
"It makes me want to cry. It's
hard to lose, knowing that it was
the last time out there for real."
Johnson said the Texas match
in the team competition was the
most difficult defeat to swallow.
"The team was for Stanford, for
the crowd and everyone out
there," she said. "So many people
had their hearts in it. I really want
ed it for Stanford."
The pro tour is the next stop for
Johnson, who hopes to spend sev

eral more years playing competi
tive tennis. She's looking forward
to that future but admits she'll
miss the Cardinal.
"I'll still be on a tennis court,
playing tennis but it won't be the
Same," she said.

match. Also, with all the running
she did during singles, the sopho
more injured her big toe. "It hurts
to move forward, anytime I put
pressure on it," she said. Although
the bloody, swollen digit was
wrapped and Poruri took
painkillers, her mobility was cur
tailed.
'The Hurricanes roared back to
capture the first set, 6-4. Willens
and Poruri again built a 3-0 edge in
the second and again they lost the
lead. Willens tried to rally Poruri

and absorb some of her load by
taking most of the balls up the
middle, but it was to no avail.
Miami won 6-3.
While the loss surprised some of
the Cardinal faithful, even Willens
had difficulty explaining the
defeat.
"I (tried to take more balls) but
there's only so much you can do,"
she said. "I wasn't even playing
well on my half of the court and
then she was in pain . .. I'm not
really sure what happened."
The match ended Willens' sea
son as No. 2 seed Lisa Raymond
had eliminated her in the singles
quarterfinal earlier in the day. The
Stanford junior grabbed an early
break in the first set but the Gator
came back to win 7-5. In the sec
ond, Raymond played virtually
error-free tennis to roll 6-1.
Willens beat William and
Mary's Karen van der Merwe 6-4,
7-5 to advance to the quarterfinals.
While Willens' doubles defeat
finished her season, Johnson's
Stanford career ended when she
and Woodhouse lost to No. 3 seed
Deborah Edelman and Stephanie
Reece of Indiana.
The Cardinal duo played a
tough first set but the Hoosiers
pulled it out, 6-4. In the second,
Johnson and Woodhouse stepped
up their game to take a 5-2 lead.
"They were very sharp —
returned well and came up with
some clutch shots," Forood said.
But, like Willens and Poruri,
they couldn't keep the advantage.
The Indiana tandem swept the
next five games to nail down the
victory, 6-4, 7-5.
"We just didn't put it away,"
Johnson said. "It was a one per
cent difference. We didn't put
away a couple of balls. We needed
to play to win instead of playing
not to lose. We waited for them to
make errors."
As the senior gathered her rac
quets and exited the court, she
realized it was for the final time.
"I walked off and said, 'Oh,'"
she said.
"It makes me want to cry. It's
hard to lose, knowing that it was
the last time out there for real."
Johnson said the Texas match
in the team competition was the
most difficult defeat to swallow.
"The team was for Stanford, for
the crowd and everyone out
there," she said. "So many people
had their hearts in it. I really want
ed it for Stanford."
The pro tour is the next stop for
Johnson, who hopes to spend sev

eral more years playing competi
tive tennis. She's looking forward
to that future but admits she'll
miss the Cardinal.
"I'll still be on a tennis court,
playing tennis but it won't be the
Same," she said.
