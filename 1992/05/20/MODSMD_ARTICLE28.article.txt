# Card's No. 2 faces top singles seed
## 
### Amy Howard Staff writer 
And then there was one. After
a gruelling two days of competi
tion in the NCAA singles tourna
ment, the field has been nar
rowed down to the four semifi
nalists, and one player sporting
the Cardinal-and-White has
managed to stay alive.
No. 3 seed sophomore Laxmi
Poruri, the highest-seeded Stan
ford player in the tournament,
will meet the top-ranked player,
Shannan McCarthy, today at
noon at the Stanford Tennis Sta
dium. The winner of the match
will advance to the finals of the
tournament and play the winner
of the Lisa Raymond-Paloma
Collantes duel taking place in the
other half of the draw.
For Poruri, the road to the
semifinals has not been an easy
one. On both Monday and Tues
day, she played two rounds of sin
gles and one round of doubles in
about an eight-hour time period.
Her first singles match yesterday
against Eveline Hamers
stretched to three sets, while her
early afternoon win over Julie
Shiflet (No. 8) was a gritty 7-5, 6-
4 victory.
As her second-round doubles
match began at 4 p.m. yesterday,
she was pushing her physical
limit. Her fatigue, combined
with a badly bruised big toe,
slowed her down on the court and
kept her from playing at top
form.
"I was pretty tired and sore
from the beginning [of the match
with Shiflet]," she said. "After
playing three matches on Mon
day and then playing today, I felt
like a pole. In many ways, this
tournament is just about sur
vival."
Today, Poruri has her work
cut out for her in order to survive
another round. McCarthy, a
senior from the University of
Georgia, is currently ranked No.
1 in the nation. After racking up
a perfect dual match record this
season (26-0), she is looking for
her first Grand Slam title. Yes
terday she celebrated her 22nd
birthday by cruising past
Stephanie Reece 6-0, 6-3, and No.
5 Holly Lloyd 6-3, 6-2.
Since she is not playing in the
doubles tournament, McCarthy's
work load has been considerably
reduced.
"I feel great," she said. "I have
had tough matches, but I haven't

stayed on the court very long,
and I think that will be to my
advantage as the tournament
goes on."
In fact, she has played a total
of 64 games in the past two days
compared with Poruri's 124
games. McCarthy understands
the rigors of the tournament,
however.
Last year she played her quar
terfinal and semifinal matches on
the same day, losing the latter to
Stanford senior and eventual
tournament champion Sandra
Birch. This year, she is looking
forward to a night of rest before
facing Poruri.
Poruri is also counting on a
good night's sleep to rejuvenate
her for the big match.
"The biggest key to the match
will be my feet," she said. "I'm
going to have to move, take the
ball early, and then hit the crap
out of it on every point."
McCarthy is a serve-and-vol
ley player, so another objective
for Poruri will be to play strongly
and keep her off the net.
"Her backhand is worse than
her forehand, but it's not really a
weakness," Poruri explained.
"She usually slices it back deep.
The thing I need to do is come to
the net first. Otherwise, there's
just no way â€” playing the net is
her forte and she loves to be up
there."
McCarthy confirmed Poruri's
analysis of the situation. "My
game is to play aggressively and
get to the net first. I think Laxmi
likes to stay back more. If I play
my type of game plan the way I
like to play, I think it will be
effective."
Poruri also has her share of
weapons, however.
"Laxmi keeps the ball in play
and is super consistent. She has a
very strong forehand," McCarthy
said.
Known for her artistic shots
and creative points, Poruri will
try to match this skill with raw
power to generate a winning
combination.
Poruri also has history on her
side. A Cardinal player has won
the NCAA singles title for the
past three years running: Sandra
Birch won it in 1989 and 1991,
while Debbie Graham did it in
1990. Poruri will either continue
the tradition or go out fighting.
"If I lose 0 and 0 and I play
aggressively I'll be happy. But
I'm not going to lose 0 and 0 play
ing like a schmuck," she said.
