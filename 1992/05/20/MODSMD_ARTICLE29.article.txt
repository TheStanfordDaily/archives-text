# Quadfather leaves impressive legacy

They gave Kareem-Abdul Jabbar a yacht
when he retired from the NBA, but
somehow that didn't seem appropriate
Monday for Donald Kennedy's good-bye gala
in Burnham Pavilion.
Nevertheless, Kennedy deserves at least a
pair of golden running shoes for his Herculean
contributions to Stanford and Stanford athlet
ics. During his tenure Stanford has emerged
as the nation's preeminent academic-athletic
powerhouse. He leaves a legacy of striving for
excellence in all areas of life, from biology, to
bird-watching, to basketball.
In 12 years under Kennedy's leadership,
Stanford has won more national team champi
onships — 31 — than any other college in the
nation. At the same time, Stanford is one of
only a handful of schools never to have been
charged with an NCAA violation.
It is fitting that Kennedy's final year — the
Centennial season — is Stanford's best ever.
With yesterday's 5-0 spanking of Notre Dame
for the men's tennis title, Stanford won its
fifth NCAA championship of 1991-92, eclips
ing the old Stanford record of four (1985-86
and 86-87) and tying UCLA for the most in a
single season. Earlier this year Stanford won
titles in women's basketball, men's and
women's swimming and men's gymnastics.
Additionally, Stanford has shattered its old

mark of NCAA individual championships (16
in 1985-86), winning a record 25 individual
titles: 12 in women's swimming, nine in men's
swimming, two in women's indoor track and
one each in men's fencing and men's gymnas
tics. With team titles in baseball, track and
field, golf and crew and individual titles in ten
nis still at stake, Stanford's championship
march may not be over yet.
How much of Stanford's athletic (and aca
demic) success to attribute to Kennedy is
debatable. Kennedy is an avid Stanford sports
fan, following everything from football, to
fencing, to frisbee.
Frequently he speaks to student-athletes in
the locker room, encouraging them in victory
or defeat. With his well-documented dish
dashes and trim appearance, Kennedy demon

strates the importance of physical fitness in an
intellectual life.
As California's top private school in the
midst of a physical fitness boom, maybe Stan
ford couldn't help but become the Arnold
Schwarzenegger of the NCAA locker room.
Wealthy alumni pumping money into the ath
letic department probably didn't hurt either.
But just as he was criticized in the indirect
cost scandal, Kennedy deserves recognition
for being the man at the helm in a time of
unequaled growth.
When Kennedy replaced Richard Lyman
Oct. 12, 1980, Stanford had won just 10
national championships in the previous 26
years, mostly in men's tennis and water polo.
On both the national and campus level,
women's athletics were largely ignored.
Kennedy's first Big Game was the source of
The Play and a 28-23 Stanford defeat.
But in the next 12 years, Stanford expand
ed its efforts in athletics, attracting some of
the top coaches and student-athletes in the
nation. Most impressive has been the dramat
ic improvement of women's athletics at Stan
ford and Kennedy's 7-4-1 record at Big Game.
Gerhard Casper will have large, sweaty
sneakers to fill as President. Hopefully he will
keep Stanford striding for excellence in all
areas.
