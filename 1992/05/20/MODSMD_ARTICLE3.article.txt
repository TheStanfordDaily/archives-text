# Tennis nets Stanford's fifth title

### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Less than three hours after they stepped
onto the courts yesterday afternoon, the
Cardinal men's tennis team walked off
with the national title.
By virtue of blowing out Notre Dame 5-0 in
the finals, coach Dick Gould and his players
helped Stanford capture its fifth national team
title of the year, tying the record set in 1981-82
by UCLA. The latest Cardinal championship was
also the first shutout since the tournament
began using the current team format in 1977.
"This is just an unbelievable feeling right
now," said senior Alex O'Brien. "It's probably
one of the best wins of my career because we
don't have the most talent."
Yesterday was a dream come true for the

young squad of scrappers. Four of the six starters
are sophomores, many of whom did not even play
at the NCAAs last year. Supposedly a rebuilding
year, the 1991-92 Cardinal has exceeded every
one's expectations and consistently surprised the
competition all year with their drive and deter
mination.
"This is a tremendous tribute to these
guys,"Gould said. "After losing (at the end of the
season to USC and UCLA) in L.A., the guys just
kept comin' back and comin' back.
"Of all the Cardinal teams this year, I doubt if
anyone performed better under pressure than
these guys did during the last two days. This is
really awesome."
Throughout the tournament, Gould stressed
the need to focus on one match at a time and to
treat every day as a fresh start. The players felt
that this emphasis was a key to their success.

'we're not the most talented team in the
country, but we're pretty damn good.'

"Everyone was really fired up after [defeating
UCLA] and we knew that it was important for us
to go out and stay really focused today," senior
Jason Yee explained.
"This was one of the best team efforts. Every
one pulled through in the clutch," O'Brien said.
"Everyone just went for it."
Even coach Gould was doubtful about the way
his team would perform yesterday. "They played
superbly against UCLA," he said. "I just won
dered how the guys would respond, but we had
back-to-back two great matches."
From top to bottom, the men all put in
tremendous performances. Vimal Patel, at fifth
singles, was the first off the court. He easily
defeated Mark Schmidt, 6-0,6-4. Next in line was
No. 6 Yee, who put away Ron Rosas, 6-0, 6-3.
