# Tennis nets Stanford's fifth title
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Less than three hours after they stepped
onto the courts yesterday afternoon, the
Cardinal men's tennis team walked off
with the national title.
By virtue of blowing out Notre Dame 5-0 in
the finals, coach Dick Gould and his players
helped Stanford capture its fifth national team
title of the year, tying the record set in 1981-82
by UCLA. The latest Cardinal championship was
also the first shutout since the tournament
began using the current team format in 1977.
"This is just an unbelievable feeling right
now," said senior Alex O'Brien. "It's probably
one of the best wins of my career because we
don't have the most talent."
Yesterday was a dream come true for the

young squad of scrappers. Four of the six starters
are sophomores, many of whom did not even play
at the NCAAs last year. Supposedly a rebuilding
year, the 1991-92 Cardinal has exceeded every
one's expectations and consistently surprised the
competition all year with their drive and deter
mination.
"This is a tremendous tribute to these
guys,"Gould said. "After losing (at the end of the
season to USC and UCLA) in L.A., the guys just
kept comin' back and comin' back.
"Of all the Cardinal teams this year, I doubt if
anyone performed better under pressure than
these guys did during the last two days. This is
really awesome."
Throughout the tournament, Gould stressed
the need to focus on one match at a time and to
treat every day as a fresh start. The players felt
that this emphasis was a key to their success.

'we're not the most talented team in the
country, but we're pretty damn good.'

"Everyone was really fired up after [defeating
UCLA] and we knew that it was important for us
to go out and stay really focused today," senior
Jason Yee explained.
"This was one of the best team efforts. Every
one pulled through in the clutch," O'Brien said.
"Everyone just went for it."
Even coach Gould was doubtful about the way
his team would perform yesterday. "They played
superbly against UCLA," he said. "I just won
dered how the guys would respond, but we had
back-to-back two great matches."
From top to bottom, the men all put in
tremendous performances. Vimal Patel, at fifth
singles, was the first off the court. He easily
defeated Mark Schmidt, 6-0,6-4. Next in line was
No. 6 Yee, who put away Ron Rosas, 6-0, 6-3.

Alex O'Brien and Billy Wright celebrate their championship as teammates Jason Yee, Vimal Patel, and Roman Sydorak look on. The men's ten
nis team clinched their third title in four years with a convincing 5-0 win over Notre Dame yesterday.
Michael Flanagan only dropped four games en route
to a win over Andy Zurcher at second singles. "He was
pretty tight starting out. I broke him in the first game
and then he let me get up on him and I took advantage of
it,"he explained. Flanagan sailed to a 6-2, 6-2 victory.
" After losing so badly at the beginning of the tourna
ment, to come back and win like this just shows how
tough Michael is," Gould said.
Flanagan also gave credit to the Cardinal faithful
who made the trek down to Georgia. "The fans were just
great all week," he said. "They definitely got in people's
kitchens."
The Cardinal's fourth point came from sophomore
Chris Cocotos, who went undefeated in Athens. At third
singles, Cocotos battled for three sets with Chuck Cole
man before winning 7-5, 5-7, 6-1.
"It was kind of rough but I just kept putting on the
pressure," Cocotos said. "If [Coleman] didn't win, his
team would be in pretty bad shape. He seemed to panic
when I put pressure on him."
Meanwhile, Robert Devens was having a tougher
time in the fourth spot. "I had a rough time getting into
the match," he said. "But then I looked over and saw
that [Yee] and [Patel] had won their first sets 6-0 and I
loosened up. After that, we just all started to roll."
With a 4-0 lead, the Card was definitely on a roll. In
the end, the title-clinching match was a toss up between
O'Brien and Devens, who were simultaneously at match
point.
Devens was receiving on match point when O'Brien
served for the win against Dave DiLucia.
"I didn't know I'd clinched it," O'Brien said. "I
looked down and everyone started running over and I
was like, 'Wow!' Roman (Sydorak) and the guys from
my fraternity were going psycho and all the parents
were cheering."
Meanwhile, Devens, playing on a separate set of
courts heard all the commotion while his opponent was
about to serve his second serve at match point.
"I heard this big yell and the crowd was going crazy,"
he said. "It was pretty awesome."
O'Brien clinched the team victory with a 6-4,3-6,6-3
win over DiLucia, the nation's top-ranked player. "He's
the Man of the Year according to everyone," O'Brien
said. "The pressure was on him to win."
After a solid first set, the Stanford senior let up in the
second and DiLucia took advantage of him. With an
early break for 3-0 in the third set, O'Brien lost serve
but broke back to 5-3 at which point he served for the

win. This final victory gave O'Brien an unprecedented
18-0 career record for his four years of NCAA team com
petition.
"That record is simply amazing," Gould said. "In all
four matches this week Alex played with great rhythm
and patience. He served intelligently, not trying to over
power his opponents but using his serve to set up vol
leys. His versatility is just unbelievable. He's had a great
career."
Yee was happy with his teammates' performances.
"This was just a great week," he said. "To win three
of the four matches in singles is a real tribute to the
work these guys have put in."
Hard work and dedication, rather than an abun
dance of raw talent, was definitely the key to Cardinal
success. "This win is real special for us because we cre
ated so much team unity. We all just stayed in our
matches because that's what we have to do," Cocotos
explained. "We're not going to blow out opponents very
easily. If any guy lets up a little bit you lose. Anything
can go wrong.
"Coach told us to be prepared for doubles because
[Notre Dame] had lots of momentum. They had a big
wave going all week and we just tried to stomp on it. We
may not be a better team, but we pretty much played
better on this day."
After watching guys like John Whitlinger, John
McEnroe and David Wheaton capture 10 titles under
his tutelage, Gould found No. 11 to be just as rewarding.
"I'm as proud of these guys as I've ever been. They're
a great group of competitors who always give their
best," he said. "We're a lot better than I thought we'd be
earlier in the year.
"We're not the most talented team in the country,
but we're pretty damn good."
Individual competition
This afternoon marks the beginning of the second
phase of NCAA competition. In singles, O'Brien and
Flanagan will play opponents from Virginia Common
wealth and Clemson, respectively.
The transition from tonight's celebration to tomor
row's first round is not easy for players.
"It will be hard," O'Brien said. "I'll really have to con
centrate." O'Brien was in the same situation two years
ago when the Cardinal won the team title and he had to
play the following morning.
Tomorrow, doubles play begins. All three doubles
teams— O'Brien-Cocotos, Devens-Flanagan and Yee-
Patel— will compete.
