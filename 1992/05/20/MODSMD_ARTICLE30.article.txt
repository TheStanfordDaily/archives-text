Stanford may not have had anyone place at
NCAAs in wrestling this year, but the team
still has something to boast about.
The National Wrestling Coaches Associa
tion (NWCA) recognized the Cardinal team as
the second-ranked academic grappling team
in the country. Stanford's wrestlers had a

combined 3.30 grade point average this year,
behind only Brigham Young University's 3.36
GPA.
"We get the brightest wrestlers in the
country, and they can't help but continue
that trend here at Stanford," said men's
wrestling coach Chris Horpel.
The Cardinal finished first last year, but
has a higher average this year.
"I was a Stanford student, and I know

what they're up against," Horpel said. "We
try to plan with their academic schedules in
mind."
While the coach is admittedly pleased with
his team's academic success rate, he hopes
that high scores in the classroom will soon
translate into overall improvement in the
program.
"When we're winning NCAAs and winning
this, it'll be an accomplishment," he said.
