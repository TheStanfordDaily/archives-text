A. Every time I get a question like
• this. T have a big decision to
make. Do I ignore the opportunity
for earthy laughs and cheap thrills
and answer a more mature question,
or do 1 throw decency to the wind
and get down in the gutter with the
readership's lowest common denom
inator?
My friends, let this article serve
as my answer.
Before I proceed, however, let's
get some terminology out of the way.
Rather than use the word "fart"
90,000 times in one column, I'll refer
to these odoriferous expulsions as
flatus (rhymes with "fellate us," not
"lattice"), a grand old word used by
the Caesars to mean exactly what it
does now.
Flatus is the result of flatulence,
the presence of excess gas in the
bowels. The first question of interest
to us aspiring flatologists, then, is,
"How does the gas get there in the
first place?"
Most of the gas hanging out in
your alimentary canal gets there
when you swallow air. This usually
happens at the same time that you
swallow food — especially if you
didn't chew it sufficiently before
sending it down the hatch.
The air we breathe (and ingest) is
about 20 percent oxygen and just
over 70 percent nitrogen, and after
traversing several meters of diges
tive tract to be expelled at the anus,
the proportion of these two predom
inant gases stays more or less the
same.
Nitrogen and oxygen are only
part of the story, and by no means
the most interesting. As it turns out,
the other components of intestinal
gas are generated right there in the
intestine. Not, however, by you.
Our diets contain a good deal of
indigestible material — mostly
polysaccharides, like cellulose, which
we can't break down for lack of the
appropriate enzymes. (Cellulose, by
the way, is a key constituent of the
"fiber" that everyone's always
telling you to get more of.)
Even though we can't break down
cellulose, the bacteria dwelling in
our intestines can. In so doing, they
generate gas — mostly carbon diox
ide, which is also a byproduct of
human respiration. These intestinal
flora also produce a good deal of
methane (also known as "marsh
gas") and hydrogen.
The latter two gases are highly

flammable. You may have heard
rumors of individuals who can set
their farts aflame (some in the
housed Greek community, I am told,
may even have had the privilege of
being witness to such an event). This
can in fact happen, thanks entirely
to these two gases.
Despite the explosion risk posed
by hydrogen and methane, they are
otherwise quite inoffensive. In par
ticular, they are completely odorless.
The worst olfactory offenders
issued forth in a flatus are sulfur
compounds, including hydrogen sul-

fide and carbon disulfide, released
when the intestinal flora digest pro
teins and some fat-related com
pounds.
These sulfurous volatiles are pre
sent only in minute concentrations,
but as most of us know only too well,
their odor can be overpowering.
If you wish to avoid flatulence,
you should decrease your intake of
those foods that bacteria can rapidly
decompose before your digestive
enzymes get at them — green veg
etables, starchy foods, broccoli,
cauliflower, cabbage, onions, radish
es and raw apples being especially
culpable in this regard.
Most of these foods are obviously
not ones that you can, or should,
eliminate from your diet. If, howev
er, you are consuming an excess of
one or more of them, you might con
sider decreasing your intake slightly.
After all, you stand to lose noth
ing other than embarrassment and a
singed rear end.
