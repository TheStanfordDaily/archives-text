# Scientists hop aboard yacht race

### Nick Strauss 
It may not have had the televi
sion audience of the Super Bowl,
but the America's Cup was no
less significant a sporting event.
As much a competition between
scientists and engineers as a bat
tle of sailors, the race features
technology more at home on a
stealth fighter than a sailboat.
A new class of boats, designed
especially for the America's Cup,
made its debut in the waters off
San Diego this year. Replacing the
slow and stagnant 12-meter class
boats of past Cup races, the new
lACC — International America's
Cup Class — boats were intended
to both encourage experimenta
tion by designers and produce
fast, high-strung boats, challeng
ing to sail and fun to watch.
The very liberal rule that gov
erns the new class only limits a
few key dimensions — for exam
ple, the length of the boat must
be between 69 and 79 inches, and
width less than 18 inches.
There is also a complex equa
tion that specifies a relationship
between three measurements: sail
area, hull length and displace
ment (overall weight). As one
dimension increases, another
must shrink, and so forth, accord
ing to an intricate relationship.
This grants the designers free
dom to seek the "ideal" hull
shape, sail plan and keel design
for the conditions and tactics
expected. A long thin hull that is
quick in a straight line, like Amer
ica 1 , is not necessarily as agile as a
short, wider one. Rough condi
tions demand different shapes
than do flat glassy seas.
The engineers developing an
lACC boat must refine their hull
form to fit the situation expected,
but not produce a boat so opti
mized for one type of weather that
it is next to useless when the
winds change. That is partially
what eliminated America's Cup
legend Dennis Conner: his boat
Stars and Stripes was unbeatable

in light breezes, but couldn't com
pete in stiffer winds.
Regardless of the shape chosen
for the hull, the designers try to
make it as light as possible. Since
the rule determines the minimum
weight for the boat based on other
design features, weight reduction
is not aimed at producing a lighter
vessel overall, but rather increas-

ing the fraction of weight that can
be placed in the keel.
Located deep underwater, the
keel is a wing-like appendage that
serves to keep the boat upright
despite tons of wind pressure
blowing against the sails. The
more of this "righting moment" a
boat has, the more directly it can
sail into the wind, yielding a
shorter total distance sailed and
making a tremendous difference
in a race.
In the search for light hulls, an
amazing variety of materials was
tried in this year's competition,
everything from wood (the ill
fated Yugoslavian entry) to
carbon fiber composites.
Needless to say, the sails them
selves underwent just as much
scientific scrutiny. Canvas has
long since gone the way of Disco,
and on boats as sensitive as these,
even nylon is pass 6. The norm is
now Kevlar, better known for its
use in bulletproof vests. Some
teams, however, were not satis
fied with mere Kevlar.
The Italian 111 Moro group
experimented with carbon fiber
sails, and America 3 raced with
sails made out of "liquid crystal"
fabric, a secret and mysterious
material that seems to possess
unusual and desirable stiffness
properties.

The most radical experimenta
tion goes on underwater, on the
all-important keel. In looking for
the perfect keel and rudder
shapes, almost every imaginable
combination of underwater sur
faces was tried. Most ended up
looking like a torpedo hanging
from an airplane wing attached
vertically to the boat's bottom.

A new class of boats, designed espe
cially for the America's Cup, made
its debut in the waters off San Diego.

Some teams tried using two sup
ports to the now customary torpe
do-shaped weight.
But no one even pretends to
have found the ideal in this cru
cial area, and it is here that most
future research will likely occur.
Early on, there were some
complaints from skippers and
owners that the new boats were
too radical, almost dangerous.
Once the boats became familiar,
the critics realized that the new
boats are just demanding, light
and agile enough to require dif
ferent tactics from those used
previously.
Now everyone seems very
pleased with the new America's
Cup class. The boats are also very
closely matched, resulting in the
closest America's Cup races ever.
This year the Cup, sailing's "Holy
Grail," was won by Bill Koch's
America 3 over the Italian 111 Moro
de Venezia.
As the boats sail and race more,
the designers learn just as much
as the crews. What worked and
what failed is carefully studied, as
are the ideas and designs of oppo
nents. In three years, at the next
America's Cup, there is a strong
possibility that the races will be
even closer, as the boat designs
evolve further toward their opti
mum.
