# Wasps to fight tree-eating beetles
## Australian stingers may help save Stanford's eucalyptus trees 
### Catherine Ivey Staff writer 
Stanford maintenance officials plan to
enlist an unlikely ally in their fight to end a
wave of tree-eating beetles: Wasps.
Over the past several months, the num
ber of trees around the arboretum and
Stanford Stadium has decreased. This is
because the trees, tazmanian blue gum

eucalyptus globulus, have been invaded by
a beetle that bores into the bark of the tree,
feeds on its tissues, cuts off the tree's
nutrient supply and eventually kills it.
The beetle, known best as the borer bee
tle, has migrated up the state from South
ern California. According to Campus
Grounds Manager Herb Fong, so far about
300-400 trees on the Stanford campus have
been fatally infected and have had to be cut

down.
Although there is no pesticide being
used to kill off the borer beetle, there is
hope of eradicating the beetle. Wasps,
imported from Australia, and currently in
the care of University of California at
Riverside forestry specialists, will be
brought to campus during August and
September. The wasps are believed to be
successful in killing off the borer beetle
when it is in its larvae stage.

'The wasps ... will be far
less numerous than the
endemic wasps and yel
low jackets in the area.'

According to Fong, four different species
of wasps will be introduced into the areas
in which eucalyptus trees are infected.
Each species is partial to a particular stage
of the beetle's larvae cycle, and those con
ducting the experiments will try to deter
mine which species is most successful in
killing the larvae.
Fong hopes the introduction of the
wasps into the infested trees will be accom
panied by a reduction in future deaths to
the eucalyptus trees.
"So far," Fong said, "it is the only type
of control we have."
The beetle has been successful in
destroying many trees because it invades
trees when they are most vulnerable to
attack, after periods of drought or freeze.
Drew Oman, arboretum project manager,
believes that the eucalyptus trees have had
to endure many weather-induced stresses
over the last 100 years.
He also sees the introduction of the
wasp as the sole solution to the beetle epi
demic. But he is not optimistic about its
success or the future of the infected trees.
He envisions the future layout of the
arboretum to be "more open, rather than
less." Plans are already underway for
planting new trees, most likely trees native
to California, to replace the dead ones.
The female borer beetle normally lays
her eggs on diseased or drought-stricken
trees. It is the larvae that are responsible
for sapping the tree of its nutrients.
Signs around the area warn would-be
tree huggers to stay away from the infected
trees. Trees that have been determined to
be over 50 percent dead are labeled with
orange spray paint.
When asked if he saw the introduction
of wasps on campus as a possible health
risk, Fong said: "The wasps that will be
introduced will be far less numerous than
the endemic wasps and yellow jackets in
the area."
He added, reassuringly, that the wasps
"are not out for hamburger or human
flesh."

Drew Oman, arboretum project manager, runs his fingers down the fallen limb of a
damaged eucalyptus tree. After enduring several droughts over the past 100 years,
the trees now face an onslaught of beetles. Oman said the introduction of the wasp is
the only solution to the beetle epidemic.
