# Buckley pans Perot, defends capitalism
## Standing 'O' despite protest 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
National Review editor William Buckley brought
his conservative views to Memorial Auditorium last
night, addressing topics ranging from capital pun
ishment to abortion to problems in the political sys
tem.
Introduced by Hoover Senior Fellow Martin
Anderson as the editor of "one of the most influential
intellectual magazines of the 20th century," Buckley
told the crowd that he expected some opposition to
his views. But he added, "I've experienced rejection
before, and you've been wrong before."
Prior to Buckley's speech, a group of about 10
protestors passed out black arm bands representing
"support of human rights and civil rights," one
protestor said.
Fliers distributed by the campus gay-rights
group Queerland urged audience members to "Just
say 'NO' to misogynist, bigoted and anti-gay
rhetoric in the guise of the 'conservative move
ment' " and to raise their fists instead of applaud-

William Buckley tells a 1000-person crowd in Memorial Auditorium, "I'd sooner be
governed by the first 1,000 names in the Boston phone book than the faculty of Har
vard. Among 1,000 Ph.D.s, there will be 500 who vote for Utopia."
ing Buckley.
However, Buckley received a
standing ovation when he fin
ished his speech.
During his talk, Buckley
emphasized what he views as
problems with the political pro
cess. He said he would discourage
the ignorant from voting, but
would not want the country to be
ruled by an educated elite.
"I'd sooner be governed by the
first 1,000 names in the Boston
phone book than the faculty of
Harvard," he said. "Among 1,000
Ph.D.s, there will be 500 who vote
for Utopia."
Buckley also pointed out the
increasing disparity between the
incomes of the poor and the
wealthy, but said he did not see a
way to make the capitalist system
more "fair."
"Unless you want to take the
position that every one should be
paid equally, fairness is going to
be arbitrary," he said, adding that
redistribution of income through
the tax structure is in itself arbi
trary.
Buckley said he also advocates
the decentralization of the federal
government and the movement of
many social programs to state
governments.
"The basic axiom of American
economics is that money coming
in from Washington is the same
money you just sent to Washing
ton, where it spent an expensive
night out on the town," he said.
Following his speech, Buckley

answered questions posed by
audience members at an open
microphone.
He was twice asked his opinion
on abortion. "Do you believe the
right to terminate a pregnancy
rests with a woman?" one woman
asked.
"Absolutely not," Buckley
replied. "I can't possibly say it's
uniquely the woman's right to
destroy something if I think it is
alive."
Questioners also raised the
issue of capital punishment,
which Buckley said he "strongly
supported" because of its deter
rent effect.
"Those people who argue
against the deterrent effect are
never very clear on the point of
how many people didn't murder
their wives because of capital
punishment," he said.
One audience member asked
Buckley's opinion concerning
Texas businessman Ross Perot's
candidacy.
"My guess is Ross Perot is
going to turn out to be the biggest
political joke in history," he said,
adding that he believes Perot will
lose much of his support once he
takes positions on controversial
issues.
Buckley's appearance was co
sponsored by the Hoover Institu
tion and ASSU Speaker's Bureau.
He attended a dinner at
Hoover with Director John
Raisian, Anderson and Political
Science Prof. David Brady before
the speech. A few students,
including ASSU Senate Chair
Kevin Warsh and Speaker's
Bureau head Ralph Ermoian, also
attended.
