# Homeless local crusader fights New Age religion with essays
## 
### Robert Milk 
Burdened by his stack of newspapers, the tall,
gaunt figure silently slipped into the safety of the
night shadows. The beams from the Palo Alto street
lights were useless against the black void which
became the homeless man's only shelter.
Security was assured, however, only until the ever
victorious rays of morning warmed the streets with
life. Joe Euclid would rise to continue his crusade
against the evils caused by psychic new-age religions.
Commonly seen posting bulletins and attending
lectures at Stanford, Euclid says he has dedicated his
life to proving the dangers of metaphysical manipula
tion. He believes that this misuse of psychic power can
subconsciously influence people to commit crimes.
"I'm on a mission," said Euclid who has quietly
become an enigma at Stanford. "There is a pattern
in the bizarre disasters and senseless crimes that
occur. The fact that they occur in a pattern serves to
prove that there is a system of cause and effect
which is invisible and involves metaphysics."
The mystery of Euclid's most famous trademark
— his stack of newspapers — is thus easily
explained.
Most of the papers are clips of "bizarre disasters
and senseless crimes," he said. "I am able to make do

with the newspapers as my input."
The rest of the papers are remnants of essays he
has sold in Palo Alto over the last decade.
Euclid's methods primarily involve written anti
metaphysical propaganda in the form of short
essays. "I write coincidence stories saying, 'Here are
two bizarre disasters that happened,' " he said.
"When they fit into the overall pattern it means that
there is a system of cause and effect at work.
"I stand on the sidewalk (of Palo Alto) and sell my
articles. On campus, I put up my articles on the bul
letin boards, but there is a problem with people tak
ing them down," he said, explaining that he has to
constantly repost the articles. "They stay up in some
departments longer than others.
"If I was doing better financially I would be more
able to hand them out or to make ten copies and put
them in the mailboxes," he said. "As it is, I'm getting
by on three or four dollars a day and I can only
afford to make a few copies."
Both the pursuit of his crusade and the atmo
sphere at Stanford have kept Euclid in high gear
nonetheless. "I value my life at Stanford," he said,
"because it enables me to know what's going on in
the world. It's valuable and stimulating learning."
