# Homeless local crusader fights New Age religion with essays
## 
### Robert Milk 
Burdened by his stack of newspapers, the tall,
gaunt figure silently slipped into the safety of the
night shadows. The beams from the Palo Alto street
lights were useless against the black void which
became the homeless man's only shelter.
Security was assured, however, only until the ever
victorious rays of morning warmed the streets with
life. Joe Euclid would rise to continue his crusade
against the evils caused by psychic new-age religions.
Commonly seen posting bulletins and attending
lectures at Stanford, Euclid says he has dedicated his
life to proving the dangers of metaphysical manipula
tion. He believes that this misuse of psychic power can
subconsciously influence people to commit crimes.
"I'm on a mission," said Euclid who has quietly
become an enigma at Stanford. "There is a pattern
in the bizarre disasters and senseless crimes that
occur. The fact that they occur in a pattern serves to
prove that there is a system of cause and effect
which is invisible and involves metaphysics."
The mystery of Euclid's most famous trademark
— his stack of newspapers — is thus easily
explained.
Most of the papers are clips of "bizarre disasters
and senseless crimes," he said. "I am able to make do

with the newspapers as my input."
The rest of the papers are remnants of essays he
has sold in Palo Alto over the last decade.
Euclid's methods primarily involve written anti
metaphysical propaganda in the form of short
essays. "I write coincidence stories saying, 'Here are
two bizarre disasters that happened,' " he said.
"When they fit into the overall pattern it means that
there is a system of cause and effect at work.
"I stand on the sidewalk (of Palo Alto) and sell my
articles. On campus, I put up my articles on the bul
letin boards, but there is a problem with people tak
ing them down," he said, explaining that he has to
constantly repost the articles. "They stay up in some
departments longer than others.
"If I was doing better financially I would be more
able to hand them out or to make ten copies and put
them in the mailboxes," he said. "As it is, I'm getting
by on three or four dollars a day and I can only
afford to make a few copies."
Both the pursuit of his crusade and the atmo
sphere at Stanford have kept Euclid in high gear
nonetheless. "I value my life at Stanford," he said,
"because it enables me to know what's going on in
the world. It's valuable and stimulating learning."

Joe Euclid says he's on a mission against evil, the patterns of which can be observed in newspapers.
He supports himself by selling essays he writes on the topic.
Euclid enjoys attending many of the
public lectures held on campus. "Most of
the things that I go to stimulate me into
writing something," he said.
For instance, Euclid attended former
Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev's
speech. "I took notes and wrote up a
sheet of his quotes which was very high
grade as something to sell on the side
walk," he said.
Euclid said he has been homeless ever
since his camper was stolen in 1985. "I
was comfortable living in my camper. I
had it parked on a back street behind a
shopping mall," he said, adding that very
little money was necessary to subsist.
"Without my camper, it is involuntary
that I don't have a door to close and lock
at night," he said.
Euclid said his current situation is
largely a result of restrictions imposed on
him by the Conservatorship for the Men
tally Incompetent. This government
agency, Euclid said, "goes down to the
judge and gets a psychiatrist who says,
'He's mentally incompetent.'
"The idea is that if I were allowed to
make a decision for myself, I would get in

trouble," he explained.
Euclid said the government has black
listed him. "There is a problem with the
Conservatorship going around and giving
me bad job recommendations," he said. "I
thus cannot live any better than this. So
it's not a realistic option for me to secure
a better condition."
He said he resents the control the gov
ernment has exerted on him through the
Conservatorship's declaration. He was
never allowed to have a say in the pro
cess, Euclid said.
"I am tired of being treated as an
object of control. This is not your theory
of citizenship."
Euclid, who said he graduated from
MIT with a physics degree, has always
been entranced by the theories of meta
physics.
His graduate school education in neu
rophysiology at Northwestern University
was funded under a grant from the Pub
lic Health Service in 1968, he said.
"When I was drafted in 1969, I pulled
a fraud on the Selective Service system
and got deferment," a plan which forced
Euclid to drop out of Northwestern after
one year.
He first came to California in January
of 1978. Upon arriving at Palo Alto,
Euclid said, "I went directly to the Tem
porary Help Agency and I got a clerical

job at Stanford. It was both nice and
interesting."
He explained he was able to find
employment then because the Conserva
torship's blacklisting hadn't come into
effect yet.
"But I was new in California, and my
heart was set upon traveling around," he
said. "I moved around the state until I
had spent all of my savings."
Euclid returned to the Stanford area
in 1982 without money or a job.
Throughout his travels in California,
Euclid had been exposed to a vast array of
"New Age" religions. He "witnessed
mind reading and thought projection
through the occult," he said.
Euclid reanalyzed his previous
employment at Stanford and concluded
that "those psychics used thought projec

tion through the occult to get me to run
away from my previous job."
But according to Euclid, not all psy
chics are bad. Because they have the
potential to use their powers for evil pur
poses, however, he believes they are dan
gerous.
He said that through his crusade, he
strives for a "change in society to a much
nicer thing, where everyone is polite and
nice."
Euclid said he has a plan to "bring the
crime rate down. There are people out
there that hear voices which tell them to
do something violent.
"We would have something on TV that
says, 'If you hear spirit voices and they
tell you to do something wrong, then call
us," he explained. "We tell them 'Hey,
you're all right! You don't have to do any
thing wrong.'
"However, you can't just have a little
10-minute conversation with them and
then forget about them. You have to have
a lot of staff to get back to them again and
again," he added.
Euclid explained that this program is
just a tiny step in fighting the crimes of
the world. He attributes violence to
another cause as well: "In this society, we
don't have enough places for people to go
and hang out.
"We've finally arrived at the classic

example that when people are idle they go
out and get in trouble," he said. "Espe
cially if they are receiving negative psy
chic messages."
Euclid's theory infers that most people
are truly good at heart, yet unfortunately
are easily vulnerable to the evils of soci
ety.
"Try arguing back against your inner
voice," he recommended. "I call this 'sub
jective mentalism.' You might find that
obeying your inner voice is not always the
best thing."
Euclid said he believes his cause
achieves extra strength because it has the
support of God. "God's plan is extremely
elaborate as to deal with the psychics," he
said. "The overall scheme is step by step."
Euclid explained his optimistic vision
of the future by labeling himself a
"humanist." He asked, "If the future is
goodness, what is the title? Why not use
the term 'humanism' to refer to the
future being good?"
Euclid's philosophy is best marked by
his powerful belief in humankind. He
refuses to give up on his crusade.
He writes in one of his essays, "Still,
some 20 or 30 years are needed for get
ting to a whole society of True Godliness
by the Correct Formula. Then, everyone
will be good to each other. An Abundance
of Goodness!"
