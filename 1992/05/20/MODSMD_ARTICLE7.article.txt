# History repeats itself in activists' struggles

In the wake of the Rodney
King verdict, many in the Stan
ford community say it is ironic
that civil rights activists' goals
today are hardly different from
the ones they fought for more
than 25 years ago.
Stanford students were part of
the movement from the begin
ning. They were among the first
college students who organized
voter registration drives in the
Mississippi "Freedom Summer"
of 1963, and returned hoping to
work with the East Palo Alto com
munity for better race relations.
But activists expressed disap
pointment and frustration that
the same issues that motivated
the protests of the '60s still need
to be addressed today.
"We have come full cycle," said
senior Priya Haji, a member of
the Community Action Coalition,
which formed in response to the
Rodney King verdict. Like their
predecessors in the '60s, the
coalition is concentrating its
efforts on improving conditions
in East Palo Alto.
The civil rights movements of
the '60s and the '90s are striking
ly similar, activists said. The pri
mary differences seem to be in the
visibility of the movement and the

clarity of its tasks.
A report compiled in response
to the 1965 Watts riots is "as use
ful a guide today as it was then"
because none of its recommenda
tions were implemented at the
time, said Robert Brown, a profes
sor of religion at Stanford during
the 19605.
History Prof. Clayborne Car
son, director of the Martin Luther
King Papers Project, called the
continuing problems in our inner
cities and civil rights status "a sin
of neglect."
The problems of today's soci
ety, Carson said, stem from inac
tion by people outside the black
community.
"Black leaders have been talk
ing about these things for the past
25 to 30 years .. . but no one has
been listening," he said.
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody cited the "divided govern
ment" in the United States over
the last two decades. "There is a
substantial and widespread feel
ing that the system is not respon
sive," he said.
Repeating the past
Haji and her colleagues are
attempting to work around that
system with traditional marches
and rallies, as well as more con
crete efforts in voter registration
and outreach in the East Palo

Alto community.
The coalition is trying to estab
lish "a community center that
would also be an educational cen
ter [and which would] re-energize
youth in East Palo Alto," Haji
said.
This effort is modeled on
Nairobi College, an institution
established in East Palo Alto dur
ing the '60s and accredited as a
junior college.
The college is "an inspirational
parallel model for us," Haji said.
Another effort that is reminis
cent of '60s activism is the voter
registration campaign.
"The issue of the right to vote
for black people intruded on what
was very much a white campus,"
Brown said.
But although the right to vote

is now assured, members of com
munities like East Palo Alto still
"don't have any faith in the sys
tem whatsoever," said junior
George McKinney, who leads the
Community Action Coalition's
voter registration effort.
Voter registration is essential,
he said, because "what is funda
mentally out of sync is that people
do not have control" over their
communities. And while some may
criticize the voting process, it is
necessary to work with it to what
ever extent possible to bring about
the desired changes, he added.
A difference of 30 years
Given the same cause and
many of the same methods, differ
ences between the tumultuous
'60s and the current decade
appear to be largely ones of visi
bility and clarity.
According to Law Prof. Robert
Weisberg, there has been "very
little energy behind the civil
rights activities over the last 15
years."
But Bob Beyers, who directed
the Stanford News Service for
almost three decades before leav
ing in 1988, noted that studies of
Stanford's activism in the '60s
show that only about 15 percent
of students were actively involved
