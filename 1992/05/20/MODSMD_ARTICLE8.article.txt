Thai protests widen; 21 killed
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) — Pro-democracy protests broke
out across Thailand on Tuesday despite the bloody government
crackdown on demonstrators in the capital that left at least 21
people dead, hundreds hurt and thousands detained.
Prime Minister Suchinda Kraprayoon defended his govern
ment's use of force and gave no sign of heeding the protesters'
demand that he step down.
In language reminiscent of the Cold War, he charged in a tele
vised speech that Communists were secretly plotting to over
throw the Thai monarchy.
Ten of thousands of protesters thronged the nation's largest
university, in northeastern Bangkok, and demonstrations in 13
provinces drew tens of thousands more. "Dog Su, get out!" some
cried, referring to Suchinda.
In the streets of Bangkok, protesters knelt to pray at sites
where others had been wounded or killed by soldiers.
Earlier Tuesday, troops fired M-16s into the air to disperse
thousands of people massed on a river bridge. The protesters fled
into streets and alleys.
Troops stormed a hotel where thousands of terrified and
injured protesters had taken refuge Monday night. The soldiers
rounded up 2,000 demonstrators and herded them into flatbed
trucks, kicking and prodding them with rifle butts.
Altogether, officials announced that more than 3,000
protesters, including pro-democracy leader Chamlong Srimuang,
had been arrested in Bangkok.
As part of the crackdown, Thai media have been ordered to
exercise self-censorship.
As darkness fell Tuesday, troops backed by armored transport
vehicles succeeded in maintaining an uneasy quiet.
Officials contacted at seven city hospitals said 16 people h?td
died and 431 others had been treated for injuries since the
protests began Sunday night.
Bush's Thai policy attacked
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Bush administration is under fire
for not taking a stronger stand against deadly military repression
in Thailand.
The Defense Department said yesterday that U.S. combat
troops would drop out of U.S.-Thai maneuvers today, but that
troops involved in medical assistance, well-drilling and other
humanitarian efforts will continue working with the Thai mili
tary.
The military maneuvers, dubbed "Cobra Gold," were to
include some 20,000 soldiers and featured a joint amphibious
landing. The maneuvers began April 26 and had been scheduled
to last until June 15.
Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., chair of the House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, called for stronger
condemnation and a total withdrawal from the maneuvers.
Solarz said Thai Prime Minister Suchinda Krayapoon, a gen
eral who is not an elected member of parliament, should step
down "in the interest of restoring peace."
"If we appear at the moment when the blood of the Thai peo
ple has been shed by a rapacious and totally repressive regime to
be on the side of the government, it is likely to damage our rela
tionship with the Thai people for many years to come," Solarz
said.
Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.1., chair of the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee, called for "an immediate end to government use
of force against demonstrators," a lifting of a state of emergency
which has expanded military powers in Thailand and release of all
prisoners.
Pentagon spokesperson Pete Williams played down the signifi
cance of the U.S. pullout, saying, "We just think it makes com
mon sense in a time of problems in Bangkok not to have pictures
of U.S. forces storming the beaches in Thailand."
"The fundamental nature of the relationship doesn't change,"
he said.
