# Bar codes to be put on library books
## Swifter 'supermarket' checkout by fall in some libraries 
### A run Paul 
In a move that will make checking out
a library book much easier, Stanford's
libraries will begin bar coding their col
lections this week.
Starting in the fall, the Engineering
and Physics libraries will be the first to
offer the new service, which should save
students time in checking out and
searching for books, and save library
staff time in inventory and tracking
library materials.
Like the bar codes used in supermar
kets, the new system will use lasers to
record computerized information about
the library materials.
Barcoding will also prepare Universi
ty libraries for an automated circulation
procedure, eliminating the time-con
suming process of filling out separate
cards for eveiy book checked out.
The circulation updates will be imple
mented at libraries throughout campus
according to a schedule that targets a
few libraries at a time. Completion of the
last phase of implementation is tenta
tively scheduled for January 1994.

According to Meyer Library director
Karen Nagy, the bar coding system will
permit library staffs to keep more accu
rate inventories of the collections, as
well as helping keep track of which
materials are used more often.
The circulation component is one
part of the NOTIS system, the overall
library system gradually being imple
mented at Stanford, according to Steven
Gass, director of the Terman Engineer
ing Library.
NOTIS is an integrated library sys
tem developed at Northwestern and
used by universities across the country.
"Implementation of the NOTIS circu
lation module is an immense project,
requiring well-coordinated efforts of
staff and resources," Nagy said.
"Staff throughout the organization
are very eager to have our automated
circulation system up and running
because of the enhancements to patron
services and collection management
tools it will provide," she added.
The estimated annual cost of imple
menting the components of the NOTIS
system is $1.1 million a year, according to

Nagy. Approximately $750,000 of this
budget has come from reallocations with
in the library system, with some contri
butions coming from the Law and Hoover
Libraries. The rest of the funds are from
an allocation made by the provost.
Barcoding will also help with the allo
cation of library funds to purchase new
materials, Nagy said .
The work required to bar code all of
the items in the Stanford University
Libraries System is immense, according
to Gass, who said there is a possibility
that the Engineering and Physics
Libraries may close for a few hours a day
during the upcoming summer.
He said his library would probably
request volunteers to help place bar
codes on books.
Barcoding will also allow students to
consult Socrates, the online University
database, to see if books have been
checked out.
"It'll be quicker than it is now, and
more convenient," said Yeou Tsai, a sec
ond-year engineering graduate student
and regular patron at the Engineering
Library.
