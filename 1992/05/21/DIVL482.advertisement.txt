KEPLER'S PRESENTS
Ben Okri
reading from
The Famished Road
winner of the 1991 Booker Prize
Britain's most prestigious literary award
"Okri's way of building his animistic universe is nothing short of astonishing ... By
opening the book, you are not so much reading a story as entering a different definition
of mental space. Whether you start reading it for prose styles, or for its visions, or to get
a look-in the sorts of tragedies and comedies and calumnies and kindnesses this author
sees as making up the corner of Nigeria he grew up in, the way Okri explodes it all
together is overwhelming." â€” New Statesman
