# ASSU Senate rejects bill to distribute its reserves
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
In its final meeting, the outgo
ing ASSU Senate last night did
away with two bills that would
each have effectively given stu
dents about $800,000 from ASSU
reserve accounts.
The senate did not consider the
Omnibus Fee Reform bill, which
would have taken the reserve
money and given it to students as
a one-time, $65 refund. Since this
senate will not meet again, the bill
is dead.
Senators also rejected a
replacement bill that would have
used $864,015 in reserves to elim

inate student ASSU fees for the
next two quarters.
In addition, Council of Presi
dents member John Overdeck
delivered a "State of the Associa
tion" address and the senate
approved a constitutional amend
ment for next year's spring ballot.
The Omnibus bill was rejected
because lawyers said it may vio
late the ASSU's tax exempt status
because the checks could be seen
as a sort of dividend, making the
ASSU a for-profit corporation.
A memo issued by Michael
Kroon, an attorney the ASSU con
sulted about the bill, said "the fact
that the economic source of the
funds is the ASSU's business

operations would make such a
refund look like a dividend of
earnings, which is prohibited."
Instead of the Omnibus
reform, the senate considered but
rejected another bill that would
have taken almost half of the
ASSU reserves to offset the
approximately $35 quarterly stu
dent fee for fall and winter quar
ters next year.
In his memo, Kroon said that
such a proposal would probably
not violate the ASSU's not-for
profit status.
Undergraduate senator Peter
Thiel, who authored both reform
bills, said that if the senate did not
pass the second bill the reserve
cash would likely be wasted.
"If we don't spend the money,
other people will try to get it,"
Thiel said. "The administration is
cutting. It would love to get their
hands on the pot 01 money.
"They'll cut student-related
programs and run to the ASSU
and tell us to fund [them]. It cre
ates all sorts of perverse incen
tives," he said.
But ASSU Financial Manager
Mike Risch said losing the reserve
funds would take needed money
from the ASSU. Risch questioned
the ability of the senate to operate
without interest from the
reserves.
"We already spend more than
we collect, and [if the bill passes]
we won't be collecting," he said.
"This will mean great cutting
back."
The bill, which needed a two
thirds vote to pass, failed by a 9-8
vote.
Besides considering the reserve
spending bills, the senate last
night heard the quarterly "State
of the Association" address, deliv
ered by COP member John
Overdeck. He talked about the
COP's accomplishments in the
past year and set goals for the stu
dent government to work on in
