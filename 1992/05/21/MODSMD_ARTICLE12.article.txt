Shredding student work
cards indicates secrecy
and distrust of students

THE UNIVERSITY'S DECI
SION to shred most of the
student admission work
cards it has on file was a heavy
handed move that revealed a grudg
ing desire to comply with the letter
of the law, but hardly its spirit.
The document-shredding comes
on the heels of a court ruling that
said work cards are part of stu
dents' educational records and
therefore must be shown to them
upon request.
The ruling was based on the Fam
ily Educational Rights Privacy Act,
which states that students must be
allowed complete access to their edu
cational records. An educational
record is defined in the act as any
thing "personally definable and
maintained by the university," which
clearly would include work cards.
The University apparently
believes that giving students their
legal right to view the work cards
poses a problem, and has decided
to eliminate it, a \& Oliver North.
The University's actions tram
ple on the law's intent. The dead
line for work card requests came
less than two months after the ini
tial few began pouring in.
And in a move that may not
even have complied with the bare
minimum of the law, the Universi
ty decided to block out the teacher
comments portion of the card.
Doing so is questionable under
the act, and robbed students of the
chance to see much of the admis
sions office's arguments. The sec
tions that were blocked out were
not discrete sections that merely
listed teacher comments. Instead,
admissions officers' arguments to
admit students were incorporated
into an analysis of those com
ments.
The open reluctance of the Uni
versity to share information

makes one wonder exactly what is
being hidden. The obsession with
keeping information inside Old
Union was so great that the Uni
versity prevented students from
photocopying their own cards.
There was scant effort to inform
students overseas of the opportu
nity to view their cards, let alone
the many students on campus who
didn't find out about the chance to
see their cards until the deadline
had passed.
Considering the obvious stu
dent interest in the work cards,
the University's stance is distress
ing. More than 600 students
requested to see their cards, and
much of the talk on campus for the
past few weeks has revolved
around the cards.
The admissions office has
argued that if the documents
became public, admissions staffers
might feel inhibited from express
ing their true thoughts on the
cards. But that argument falls flat:
Students realize that some of the
criticisms on their cards might be
uncomfortable â€” and if they don't,
it is hardly up to the administra
tion to worry about it.
Students are not interested in
the cards to see what a particular
individual wrote about them, but
to see the impression they made on
the admissions office.
The admissions office should not
be concerned with protecting
themselves. Instead, they should
continue to critically evaluate the
students, and should give students
the chance to look at that criticism.
Viewing the work cards provides
students with a unique opportuni
ty to understand how others per
ceived them in the application pro
cedure. It is a lesson that would be
valuable in future applications and
interviews, not to mention daily
interaction with classmates and
faculty.
But the way the University
chose to handle the situation sim
ply does a disservice to students,
and undermines the credibility of
those who attempt to hide infor
mation.
