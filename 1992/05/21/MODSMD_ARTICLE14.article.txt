## Confessions of an Oreo 
### 
WHAT HAPPENS when you pass
another black soul? Is there eye
contact, a nod or nothing at all?
You pass and barely pause to recognize
each other. Sometimes you do smile
knowingly, even an occasional hello, but
you rarely cut too deep and never, never
raise race.
Half of the black folk who come
through Stanford will graduate with no
particular connection to black people.
Every African-American who doesn't par
ticipate in the black community is a
resource lost. We all have skills, knowl
edge and energy that can contribute to our
mutual well being, and we are too small a
nation to afford losing anyone. There are
too many battles to be fought to risk our
brightest to assimilated uncaring.
More importantly though, Stanford
may be the last place for a lost soul to
learn the value of a black community.
Every student who remains estranged
from other blacks will likely always be an
outsider. The inability to be comfortable,
see beauty and love other black folk is a
fiercely isolating and alienating experi
ence. Ultimately, I think it results in a
form of self-loathing. This is a brutal bur
den to bear and it takes its toll in frac
tured identities and unreconciled lives.
You are a part of this generation that
has come of age disconnected from other
black people. You were birthed into white
ness, with neighborhoods, friends and

barbers unlike you. Your schools were
white. You listen to white music. Your
relationships are with white girls and
boys. Whiteness is your language, and
you are fluent.
I am reminded of the Marlon Riggs
documentary "Tongues Untied," in
which a group of gay black men are car
rying a banner that states; "Black men
loving black men: a revolutionary act."
The trauma and solution for these men
are similar to that of all the isolated
blacks, straight or gay. We must break
the cycle of invisibility that allows us to
glance through each other. We must see
potential for meaningful relationships
and cultivate it feverishly.
The banner-slogan could easily be
expanded to "black people loving black
people; a revolutionary act." Simply, to
love ourselves, we must be able to love
one another.
You have never known black people, but
they know you. If you walk into the party,
the spotlight will hit you. So you don't go
to the party. You don't go to the BSU meet
ing. You skip the chillout. Of course none
of it is really all that conscious.
No black person should be forced to
feel comfortable with other blacks, but
my guess is that were it easier, many of
the miscellaneous would move to the core
community. Perhaps what is needed is a
sort of radicalizing experience or ideolo
gy-

'I was birthed
into white
society and
living in Uj
cut the umbil
ical cord.'

For me, Ujamaa had that sort of
impact. I was birthed into white society
and living in Uj cut the umbilical cord. It
is only within Uj that I have finally
become comfortable in black settings.
Still, we need more than Uj to help folk
because each year the chemistry of the
house changes, and more significantly,
each individual is at a different place in
his or her life.
In eras past, light-skinned blacks
sometimes identified as white for the
privileges it accorded them. In contempo
rary times the phenomenon has taken on
new (and possibly more insidious) forms.
To pass as white today, black folk need
only talk the talk and walk the walk of
whiteness. Passing has become a trick of
culture, not color. To roll with force as a
community and a nation we absolutely
cannot let this 10th of the talented pass
away.
What happens to an Oreo deferred?
Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun or
does it explode?
