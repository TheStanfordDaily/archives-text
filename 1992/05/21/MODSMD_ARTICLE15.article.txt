Business students react to King verdict, aftermath

WE, THE UNDERSIGNED 193
students at the Stanford Univer
sity Graduate School of Busi
ness, have watched with sadness and dis
may the recent events related to the Rod
ney King trial in Los Angeles.
We are shocked by the inability of the
United States justice system to uphold
the rights of the individual, minority or
not, in what appears to be an obvious use
of excessive police force.
We believe the result was a failure to
produce a just and fair verdict.
Moreover, we are dismayed by the
apparent insensitivity to the many preju
dices associated with the trial.
While we do not condone the acts of
violence and destruction which have fol
lowed in the wake of the trial's outcome,
as future business leaders we are con
cerned by the strong divisive forces that
seem embedded in our society.
The events occur at a time when eco
nomic hardship has divided the nation;
more significantly, they are symptoms of
a larger and more serious problem that
affects all Americans.

In the 19605, civil rights legislation
was enacted that mandated that all peo
ple, regardless of race or socioeconomic
status, had the right to expect equal
opportunity and social justice within our
society and that these rights were pro
tected by our Constitution.
Symbolically, the civil rights legisla
tion was also a statement by society that
prejudice of any type would not be toler
ated in this country.
Unfortunately, some in our society
never embraced the spirit of these words.
Although the legislation articulated a
clear objective of fairness, justice and
equal opportunity, the process to achieve
this vision of social integration was never
fully understood nor effectively estab
lished.
Certainly, over the years, we have
observed a systematic deterioration of
programs that were at least headed in the
right direction and that provided a pro
cess by which different socioeconomic
elements in our society could work
together to develop a better understand
ing, a level of trust and respect.

The events in Los Angeles, both in and
outside of the courtroom, are a painful
reminder of how little we have accom
plished over the years. Our inability to
achieve real equality of opportunity and
real solutions to social problems poten
tially threatens our status as a global
competitor.
If we are to maintain and improve our
current competitive position, we must
raise the standard of education for all
those who will participate in the work
place.
All parts of society, regardless of race
or socioeconomic status, share the same
basic desires for their and their children's
future.
If we are to bring change and, ulti
mately, harmony to our democratic sys
tem the solution lies in educating our
selves about our differences and, more
importantly, our similarities.
The responsibility of creating this
forum lies in all of our hands â€” individu
als, businesses and government. Given
that we have invested our futures in busi
ness, we believe that business leaders and

their organizations should share in the
responsibility for issues of social welfare
and equality.
This needs to be demonstrated
through a commitment to the develop
ment and allocation of the human and
financial resources required to address
these issues.
We are in the age of a global business
economy. We cannot participate effec
tively in this environment if we do not
possess the attitudes and systems that
promote understanding and tolerance for
diversity at home.
In order to compete effectively, we will
need to capitalize on the competitive
advantage that our cultural and racial
diversity offers.
While the events in Los Angeles are
tragic, they also represent an opportunity
to stop blaming each other and start mov
ing forward in ways that will benefit us
all.
