# Electric cars still not environment friendly
## 
### 
We would like to thank Joel Miller for
his response to our letter "Electric car
won't solve all environmental woes."
Unfortunately, the technical arguments
he brings forward are incomplete and
misleading.
. . only 26 percent of PG&E's power
comes from fossil fuel sources": Accord
ing to Electric Power Annual 90, January
1992 (a federal document), 56 percent of
national electrical energy comes from
coal, 13 percent from oil and natural gas
(= 69 percent from fossil fuels), 21 per
cent from nuclear power and 10 percent
from hydro sources. It is not helpful to
look only at the local figures, since the

hybrid car will not be used only locally.
The same is true for the transmission
of electrical energy. . . power transmit
ted to Stanford from the Moss landing
power station (near Monterey) loses 1.2
percent": The loss of electrical energy in
California, according to the California
Energy Commission, is about 10 percent.
The national figure is higher, because of
a lower population density outside Cali
fornia.
"Battery manufacturers make their
batteries in a manner that allows recy
cling, since reusing materials signifi
cantly cuts their costs": True, but the
very same cost consideration keeps them
from recycling both the lead that is dis
solved in the acid and the lead sulfate
contained in used batteries.
The disposal of these toxic chemicals
may create unknown problems in the

future.
"A power plant using fossil fuel is
about 40percent efficient. A car's internal
combustion engine is 15-20 percent effi
cient": Transmission losses are about 10
percent, battery charging another 10 per
cent and electrical engine and transmis
sion losses amount to 20 percent (accord
ing to John M. Fowler, "Energy and the
environment"). Considering these fig
ures, the net efficiency of an electric car is
around 25 percent.
Besides these details, we would like to
suggest a more holistic way of thinking
about transportation.
The issue of individual transportation,
i.e. the automobile, raises questions such
as the following ones: The possession of a
car is socially exclusive (especially when
viewed on a global scale), the production
and disposal of cars is environmentally

problematic for both the hybrid car and
the gas car and the space consumption of
highways has grown out of proportion in
most urban areas.
Unfortunately, these questions have
remained unaddressed; research money
goes to the refinement of the status quo
instead of to the development of radical
ly new ways of transportation, i.e.
cheaper and faster mass transport sys
tems.
We do not criticize the development of
new technology nor the effort of the peo
ple involved; we would only like to criti
cize the unqualified use of the "environ
mentally clean" label for hybrid cars.
