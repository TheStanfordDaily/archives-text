## Netmen win 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
After all the celebration and hoopla sur
rounding the men's tennis team's 12th NCAA
team title, Alex O'Brien and Michael Flanagan
had little trouble getting back down to business
for the individual singles competition.
Yesterday, the Cardinal's two representatives
in the singles draw won their first round match
es. O'Brien, seeded third, easily crushed Virginia
Commonwealth's Fredrik Eliasson, 6-0, 6-2.
"[Eliasson] wasn't of the caliber of players
that Alex has been playing lately," said assis
tant coach John Whitlinger.
"There's often a tendency to let down but Alex
didn't. He just did his job and got off the court. It
was a nice match for him considering what he
has been through over the last few days."
O'Brien credited his coaches with helping
him stay focused. "Whit and [head coach Dick
Gould] were on my case [about staying focused].
I started off pretty well: I was ready to go, and
they didn't want me to let down at all."
Flanagan had a tougher time with Clemson's
Greg Seilkop. He came back from a 0-6 first set
drubbing to win the next two sets, 6-2, 7-5.
"Michael didn't play his best but he kept his
mind on what he was doing," said Gould. "He'll
have-to play better tomorrow though."
Today's match against host Georgia's top
player, Wade McGuire, promises to be a "loud
and noisy" challenge for Flanagan, according to
Gould. With a hometown crowd and a big serve,
McGuire should be a formidable opponent for
the Stanford sophomore.
O'Brien's second round match today also will
be tough. He faces Donny Isaak of Drake. Isaak
transferred to Drake from USC this year, so he
and O'Brien have had many run-ins over the
years. Like O'Brien, Isaak reached the semifi
nals of the individual NCAA draw last year.
"llsaak's] a heck of a player," Whitlinger
said. "It will be a battle. That's probably the
toughest second round match [in the draw]."
O'Brien agreed with his coach. "Donny's
good — he's a great competitor, and runs lots of
balls down. It'll be a tough match, but that's
what this tournament is all about."
In doubles, Flanagan and partner Rob Devens
should have a close match against Louisiana
State's Tamer El Sawy and Mario Pacheco.
"LSU will be tough but [Flanagan and Devens]
have beat some tough teams," Whitlinger
remarked. "They're feisty competitors."
O'Brien and Chris Cocotos, seeded second,
will face Carlos Fleming and Paul Garvin of
Kansas while Jason Yee and Vimal Patel will
take on Mississippi State's Daniel Courcol and
Laurent Miquelard.
