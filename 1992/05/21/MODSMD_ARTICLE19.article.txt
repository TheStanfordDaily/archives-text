# Fifth-year gridders lost in coach shuffle
## 
### 
Ihate to be a downer during
such a good week for Stanford
athletics, but this is a story
that definitely should be told.
I should say in the beginning
that this will be a somewhat one
sided account — Athletic Director
Ted Leland never returned any
calls, so I don't know his side of
the story. If you're curious, I
guess you'll have to ask him for
his viewpoint yourself.

Senior Vince Otoupal came to
Stanford in the fall of 1988 with
high hopes. The former Out
standing Linebacker of the Year
in the North Puget Sound League
from Seattle, Wash., joined the
Cardinal football team with a
decent chance of starting for the
team someday. Then-coach Jack
Elway ran a five-year program,
meaning that fifth-senior players
were welcomed on the squad.
Otoupal chose to redshirt his first
year thinking that, with an extra
year to learn the system, he would
perhaps soon earn a starting spot.
The problem began when
Elway left and Denny Green came
in as head coach.
Green wanted to change
Elway's system and run a four
year program in which every foot
ball player would graduate in four
years and only special players
would be allowed to redshirt and
take a fifth year. The constantly
improving Otoupal felt he would
receive another year, so he didn't
really worry about it.
"Projected to see extensive play
ing time at linebacker .... A hard
hitting player who has an excellent
shot at starting," the 1990 Football
Media Guide said about the 6-foot
3, 230-pound Otoupal.
"Projected to see extensive
playing time at right outside
linebacker .... A hard-hitting
player who will be a valuable asset
to the Cardinal defense in *91,"
said the '91 Media Guide.
As a key player on special

teams and the main backup for
starters Ron George and Dave
Garnett, Otoupal played in all but
one game since he redshirted. He
started against Washington State
in 1989 and recorded 9.5 tackles.
In spring of 1990 Otoupal had
a meeting with Green to discuss
the future.
"He told me that if I had a good
season, I had a good chance of
being invited back (for his final
year of eligibility)," Otoupal said.
In that final year (1991), he
played in all 11 games and tallied
20 unassisted tackles, five assisted
tackles and one fumble recovery —
after the Aloha Bowl he felt that he
had had a good year, and frankly,
he expected to be invited back.
But when Green headed for
Minnesota, he left behind a list of
players that were not to be invited
back, and Otoupal's name was on
it. The next thing he knew, he
was off the team. No meetings, no
chance to redeem himself.
"They (the coaches) told me
that they needed my scholar
ship," Otoupal said. "They over
recruited and decided I wasn't
worth having around. I have no
idea why they picked me."
Otoupal wasn't left out to dry
completely, however. He is able to
finish his final year of school
because he has been awarded a
medical scholarship for 1992-93.
A team can give a medical scholar
ship to an injured player without
counting it as a normal football
scholarship for NCAA purposes.
But that isn't the issue that
disturbs Otoupal.
"My class had one year less to
play football under this system,"
he said.
In other words, the Stanford
football department and the Ath
letic Department reneged on their
word. Otoupal heard promise
after promise that he had a good
shot at another year, and then he
had the rug pulled out from under
him without warning. And he's
not the only one. Steve Smith,
Kevin Puk and Beckett Hinckley
also were not asked back — and
none of them knew about being
cut beforehand.
Otoupal is quick to defend Bill
Walsh and the present staff from
criticism.

"I don't have a problem with
coach Walsh or anyone there
now," he said.
"They were just handed a
sheet of paper with some names
on it, and they followed Green's
suggestions. My problem is with
the previous coaches and the
department."
And there is quite a problem.
Stanford football and the Athletic
Department made a commitment
to those players, and for Green to

let them go without any discus
sion or explanation is despicable.
Some of the blame must also go to
the Athletic Department and
Leland for not respecting these
players.
In the 1992 Stanford Spring
Football Guide, Otoupal, Smith,
Hinckley and Puk are listed as
"Lettermen Lost."
Denny Green and the Athletic
Department lost more than let
termen — they lost a lot of
respect.
