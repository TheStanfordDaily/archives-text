# Senate to fund two years of wilderness trips for students

### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Newly arrived Stanford stu
dents will be able take trips to
the wilderness or participate in
public service projects thanks
to a $74,047 bill passed by the
ASSU Senate last night.
The approval of the First
Year Trips Program, scheduled
to start in 1993, will allow fresh
men, transfer students and
first-year graduate students to
participate in three-to-five-day
trips during orientation.
Students can choose to go on
wilderness expeditions —
including one where partici
pants will climb Half Dome in
Yosemite National Park — or
perform public service in a for
mat similar to the Alternative
Spring Break program.
The senate will pay for two
years of trips. At the beginning
of the 1993-94 school year, a
pilot program will include 200

students. The next year, about
750 students will be able to
participate.
According to Greg Sheff, a
coordinator of the program,
students will have to pay about
$85 each for the outings.
However, Sheff said students
will be accepted on a need-blind
basis and "heavy financial aid"
will be available for those who
cannot afford the fee.
Sheff said the program can
not start until 1993 because
student interns need to be
trained to run the trips.
The proposal met with opposi
tion from some senators, who felt
it was too expensive or wanted
the program to get funding from
an ASSU special fee request.
However, the bill — which
undergraduate senator Travis
Katz called "one of the best stu
dent initiatives I've seer
through the senate in the two
years I've been involved in the
ASSU" — passed by a 15-4 vote.
