## Georgia senior to face second-seeded Lisa Raymond of Florida 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
In the NCAA semifinal between Stanford's
Laxmi Poruri and Georgia's Shannan McCarthy,
the match boiled down to who played better on big
points and who wanted the victory more.
In both those categories McCarthy came out on
top, as she did in the final score, 6-2, 6-3.
The Bulldog senior broke Poruri's serve early and
often in the first set. McCarthy grabbed a 4-1 lead
on the strength of a potent attacking game. She kept
the ball deep on Poruri's backhand and when the
sophomore replied with a short shot, McCarthy
charged the net.
"That's effective against me, that's for sure,"
Poruri said of the penetrating shots to her backhand
wing. "She hits with a lot of topspin so its heavy but
its not real powerful."
Poruri explained that the topspin was difficult to
handle because it forced her to make contact with
the ball at shoulder level, rather than waist level, so
she couldn't generate much pace on the reply.
"It's hard to do anything with it because its not in
your hitting zone," she said.
However, Poruri had opportunities to keep the
set close. She was up 40-15 on one of the service
games she lost.
McCarthy had a few concentration lapses as well.
In the sixth game, McCarthy missed several first
serves and double-faulted at break point to give
Poruri the game.
That seemed to spark the Cardinal as she began
to attack off her first serve in the next game. Poruri
put away a volley and ripped a forehand crosscourt
winner to lead 40-15.
Then McCarthy jumped on Poruri's second serve
and ended the point with a forehand down-the-line
winner. The Bulldog saved another game point with
a topspin lob that Poruri couldn't reach.
The Cardinal tried to return the favor but the lob
wasn't deep enough and McCarthy crushed it to
reach break point. After a forehand winner, the
senior had a 5-2 lead.
"I had a lot of chances at 40-15 but I didn't play
tough on those points," Poruri said. "She's a good
player. She's at another level than most players.
When you have chances, you've got to take them. If
you mess them up, you won't get anymore."
With McCarthy serving for the set, Poruri took a
0-30 edge. But the net was increasingly becoming the
domain of the Bulldog as she relentlessly assailed
Poruri's backhand. Twice, Poruri lobs fell short and
McCarthy pulled out the game and the set, 6-2.
"I approached to the backhand to force her to
come over it and pass me," McCarthy said. "Overall,
that put some pressure on her."
Throughout the set, the physical and mental toll

that the singles and doubles tourneys had taken on
Poruri showed.
"I was more tired than usual... but that's not my
excuse for losing," Poruri said. "When I had chances
I just blew them. It was more mental than physical.

'When I had chances I just
blew them. It was more men
tal than physical.'

"This whole week I've had to really pump myself up.
It takes more, especially after the emotion of the team
tournament, to psych myself up (for individuals)."
Stanford coach Frank Brennan agreed with
Poruri's assessment.
"It was more mental," he said. "When it was for
the team, there was no question of motivation. She
probably thought, 'The team lost. I've got finals in a
few weeks. I've got individuals? OK.' Probably more
than anyone else on the team, she has that conflict."
Of course, the lower intensity level cost her yes
terday.
"She was lacking energy and enthusiasm," Bren

nan said. "You need that to win. She picked it up in
the second set."
However, in the first game of the second set,
Poruri only managed to get in one first serve.
McCarthy aggressively attacked the second serve
and broke Poruri.
Continuing to serve Poruri's backhand,
McCarthy held serve and Poruri returned the favor
while doing some serve and volleying of her own.
Finding some success with coming to net, Poruri
used the strategy to break McCarthy's serve and
pull even at 2-2. The Georgian roared back and out
played Poruri in three of the next four games to
come within one game of victory.
Poruri won the first point with one of her patent
ed drop shots. That particular stroke isn't usually as
effective against McCarthy as it is against a baselin
er because the serve-and-volleyer is already moving
forward to the net and can reach more short balls.
Poruri missed a volley wide on the next point and
was passed by a blistering forehand crosscourt pass
ing shot.
At 15-30, Poruri jammed McCarthy with a deep
serve to her forehand and the Bulldog netted the
