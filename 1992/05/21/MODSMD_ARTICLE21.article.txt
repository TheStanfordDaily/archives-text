# No. 6 Hatters: No tea party for Card nine
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Today the ninth-ranked, No. 1-seeded Stanford
Cardinal baseball team vaults into the postseason by
taking on the infamous Stetson Hatters in the first
round of the South II regional in Talahassee, Fla.
The Hatters, who made their way into the play
offs as the Trans American Conference Tourna
ment Champions, own an impressive regular sea
son record of 38-19 against such vaunted confer
ence rivals as Florida International, Mercer, Sam
ford and Centenary.
The Hatters do not possess loads of individual
talent, with the exception of one. Senior shortstop
Wes Weger was projected by Baseball America as
the sixth best collegiate shortstop in the nation, and
provides much of the Hatter offense from the plate.
In other action at the regional today, home
team Florida State takes on Western Carolina, and
Georgia plays Kent State.
Florida State (41-18)
The Seminoles of the Atlantic Coast Conference
looked in the preseason to be very similar to the
Cardinal in that they possessed great pitching and
little offense. However, unlike the Cardinal, the
prognostication proved to be true. Florida State's
pitching remained dominant and the offense
remained quiet for most of the season, while Stan
ford's offense gained momentum throughout the
year as the pitching slumped at times.
Georgia (35-23)
The Bulldogs are one of five teams to go to
regionals from the Southeastern Conference, and
one of three from the Eastern Division of the con
ference. Georgia was not expected to be a factor in
the SEC race, but exceeded all expectations by beat
ing out conference foes Tennessee and Auburn for
a spot. Perhaps the Bulldog's most talented players
is outfielder Ray Suplee, and the teams sports an
excellent pitcher in lefthander Stan Payne.
Kent State (44-11)
The Golden Flashes achieved the postseason by
virtue of their first Mid-American Conference title
since 1964. Kent State, like many teams in the
South II regional, is very deep in pitching, featur
ing a trio of outstanding arms: Cale Jacobs, Bill
Underwood and John Grimm. In addition, the
Golden Flashes have one of the best third basemen
in the nation in Mike Gulan — who figures to be a
high draft choice in June — and a very talented
shortstop, freshman Ryan Beeney — who was one
of the top recruits in the nation.
Western Carolina (41-19-1)
The Catamounts of the Southern Conference
shouldn't be too much of a match for the Semi
noles in round one. However, Western Carolina
does have three excellent players in senior third
baseman Matt Raleigh, outfielder Joey Cox and
sophomore pitcher Phil Grundy.
The Cardinal-Hatters game will begin at 8 a.m.
Pacific Time and will be broadcast by KZSU.
