## Men capture 12th NCAA title during 'rebuilding year' 
### 
The Cardinal's Tuesday afternoon 5-0 blowout over 12th
seeded Notre Dame proved that it takes more than just tal
ent to win a national championship.
The men's tennis team, dominated by sophomores, used
their drive, determination and never-say-die attitude to dis
prove critics and columnists around the country who
claimed that 1991-92 would be a rebuilding year for the Car
dinal.
Not only was this victory the first shutout in the men's
finals since the tournament began using a team format in
1977, but it also marked Stanford's fifth NCAA team title in
66 days. With it, the Cardinal tied UCLA's 1981-82 national
record for the most team titles in one year.
The Stanford men only needed to play one doubles match
en route to their title. The squad has now won 12 NCAA
team crowns under head coach Dick Gould.
Wins in this year's tourney over No. 16 Duke, No. 9 LSU,
No. 6 UCLA and finally No. 10 Notre Dame bring the No. 2
Cardinal's 16-year NCAA dual match record to 49-4.
Senior co-captain Alex O'Brien ends his NCAA team com

petition career with an unprecedented 18-0 record in his four
years of tournament play. Is this coincidence? Luck? Great
karma?
"You know, I played that first match (last week) and I got
that feeling that I couldn't be beat," O'Brien said. "I didn't
think about the streak, I didn't think about any of that. I just
went out and played. I guess I just want to win so badly. . . ."
O'Brien was not the only one who wanted to win the title.
En route to the championship, virtually every player beat am
opponent that he had never beaten before. Many of these vic
tories came in the semifinals against UCLA, where sopho
more Rob Devens said everyone "just played out of their
minds."
When the pressure was on, the men came through. With
out a handful of national big guns to lead the way, the young
scrappers capitalized on opportunities and as coach Gould
said, "just kept comin' back and comin' back."
If they keep up this attitude, they should be comin' back
with No. 13 in the not-so-distant future.
