# Kennedy tells CIV class of 'State of Earth'
## 
### Steve Sherman 
Students in one CIV class had
an unusual guest lecturer yester
day: University President Donald
Kennedy.
Kennedy, a biologist, spoke on
the "State of the Earth" in lectur
er Barry Katz's Values, Technolo
gy, Science and Society CIV class
— "no small task for 50 minutes,"
according to Kennedy.
Katz said Kennedy's visit
"wasn't simply a one-shot visit
from a star," but that the lecture
was one in a series on the environ
ment being carried on in his class.
This lecture was one of the last
for "President Kennedy," and one
of the first in 12 years for "Pro
fessor Kennedy," Katz said.
Kennedy said it was a great
pleasure to get the chance to give
the lecture, but that Katz had
"never quite billed it as job
retraining."
The lecture focused on the fac
tors that decide the state of the
Earth and the factors needed to
reach an equilibrium.
Kennedy compared the diffi
culty of running an equilibrium
society with that of running an
equilibrium university. "We try to
live within the level of the endow
ment," he said, but when that is

not possible, "we go over budget
for the shortest time, and then go
back to a balanced budget. That's
what we'll try to do."
He said that equilibrium
depends on three factors — popula
tion, resources and environment.
The world population, Kennedy
said, is quickly approaching about
5.5 billion, and the chances are
slim that it will level off at any
thing less than 10 billion.
He also said the world has been
using up its resources much
faster than they are being replen
ished.
The environment is an impor
tant factor in assessing the state
of the earth, Kennedy said, men
tioning global warming and the
preservation of diverse species as
some problems it faces. He also
cited the world's use of resources
again as a factor in these issues.
Kennedy proposed internation
al agreements as possible solutions
to the environmental crisis.
The treaties would need to be
"as firm as arms control treaties,"
he said. The developed countries
of the world will just have to give
up some of their advancements in
order to reduce the use of
resources, Kennedy said, and
until then the earth will keep
deteriorating.
