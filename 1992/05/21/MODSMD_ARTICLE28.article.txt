## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY Dining in North Beach The 						allure of exquisite Italian dining beckons

Every time I decide to go up to San
Francisco, I tell myself that, this time,
I'm going to do something different. But
usually I end up beating the same path
over Russian Hill into North Beach,
home to one of the best collections of
Italian restaurants in the known world.
The coolest thing to do in North
Beach is walk up and down Columbus,
taking in the attitude, ethnicity and
urbanity, along with the odor of garlic
and basil. Well, no, actually the coolest

thing about North Beach is that you car
step into just about any Italian restau
rant within a block of Columbus Street
and expect a memorable dinner.
Cafe Michelangelo is a small,
unpretentious little place with a pretty
standard but appealing menu. For $9-
$12 you can get a variety of pasta
shapes in tomato, pesto or a cream
sauce, or pick from a variety of seafood
and chicken dishes.
The gnocchi (potato dumplings)
were good, and the Tortellini Michelan-

gelo, in a cream sauce with prosciutto,
black pepper and garlic, were even bet
ter.
As far as the other pasta options are
concerned, the pesto sauce didn't have
enough garlic bite to it, so you'd be bet
ter off with the cream sauce (the same
excellent sauce they use for the Tortelli
ni Michelangelo), or the tomato sauce if
you are a fat-o-phobe.
Salads, which range from $3 to $5,
are good and big — big enough to be eas
ily splittable.
Around the corner from Cafe
Michelangelo on Union Street is Little
City Antipasti Bar. Little City offers a
pretty exciting departure from standard
Italian fare. Head chef Lisa Heck
endorf's creations are more accurately
described as Italian-influenced than
Italian.
Some of the coolest things on the
menu are antipasti. The grilled marinat
ed prawns with black bean and corn
salad for $5.75 are amazing. Other
antipasti include a cajun mixed grill of
andouille sausage, prawns and chicken
wings with a black-eyed pea and bell
pepper salad, and — best of all — baked
brie and roasted garlic.
Choosing a few appetizers to share
might be the best way to go at Little City.
But the pasta dishes and entrees are pret
ty interesting in their own right, and are
all under $11. The penne rigate with
grilled eggplant, tomatoes, spinach, feta
and oregano is especially good.
Caffe Sport is on Green Street just a
block off Columbus. I was really excited
to try this place. Caffe Sport has won a
bunch of awards and stuff, and I'd
peered into it before and it looked kind
of quirky and cool. Besides, the wait to
get in is always impossibly long, so it
must be good, right?
So up we went at 5:30 p.m. on a
weekday, successfully avoiding the usual
crowd. We took our seats prepared to
indulge. Our waiter handed us our
menus, which were actually xeroxed
copies of a letter from some food maga
zine saying they were nominated as one
of the 50 best restaurants in the country.
On the other side was the menu
itself, priced to reflect the fact that they
could afford to charge $17-$25 for pasta
dishes now that they were one of the 50
best restaurants in the country. Kind of
a pretentious menu (both sides of it) but
if they could back it up. . . .
The loaf of bread that came with our

drinks was lousy and
even a little stale. Uh
oh. I mean, if a restau
rant doesn't care
enough about your
business to bring you
decent bread — well,
let's just say I was start
ing to worry that maybe
Caffe Sport was going to
be a letdown.
Yup. The pasta with
pesto sauce was good,
but it wasn't 17 bucks
good. And the ciuppino
wasn't good at all, espe
cially for a place that
bills itself as a seafood
restaurant. Normally
ciuppino is a tomato
base seafood soup. At
Caffe Sport it is a few
clams, some prawns,
and a whole lot of cala
mari and octopus cov-

ered in an exceedingly average tomato
sauce. For 23 bucks? Come on.
When we left, there were already people
lining up well outside the door. Whatever.
The sad thing is, Caffe Sport was probably
pretty damn good a couple of years ago
when they won the award. But winning
an award like that secures you a guar
anteed clientele of yuppies who don't
know any better and who will line up
around the block every weekend to
impress their friends.
Meanwhile, back out on Columbus
and just a few doors up from Cafe
Michelangelo is The Gold Spike. The
best thing about The Spike is that the
pseudo-gourmands lined up out the
door to get to Caffe Sport would never
set foot in the grungy confines of this
place.
Here is where the locals eat, usually
a reliable indicator of a quality restau
rant.
Its the kind of place where you don't
have to feel self-conscious about scrap
ing the sauce up off your plate with a
crust of bread. Lots of cool Italian accent
floating out of the kitchen along with
the aroma of Italian spices.
The interior hasn't been painted
since the '50s. Dollar bills are taped to
the ceiling. Big, gaudy wooden ducks
and pictures of 1950s baseball heroes
on the wall.
And of course the obligatory red-and
white checked tablecloths and dim
lighting. You get the idea.
Definitely the best deal at The Gold

Spike is the $12.95 family-style six
course dinner. It commences with
minestrone soup, not exactly nouvelle
cuisine, but very good in a kind of
hearty, satisfying way.
Soup is followed by a green salad and
an antipasto. The antipasto is actually a
couple slices of salami and some pickle
chips that came straight out of a Nal
ley's jar. Very in character. But the bread
is awesome, so you can eat that instead
while you wait for the main course.
A platter of pasta and your entree
arrive at the same time. The Gold Spike's
menu contains some of the old standbys
that have long since disappeared from the
more chic restaurants around North
Beach. The chicken cacciatore is really
nice, and the eggplant parmigiana is
about as good as I've ever had.
The pasta was, predictably, cooked a
little longer than it needed to be, but al
dente just wouldn't have tasted quite
right in a place like this.
And for dessert: good ol' spumoni ice
cream.
Basically, the Gold Spike is a living
specimen of the wonderful breed of Ital
ian restaurant that lives in the Ameri
can collective unconscious.
