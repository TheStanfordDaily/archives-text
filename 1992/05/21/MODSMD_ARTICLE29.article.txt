# Oooh, baby—I was a a fool to apply here
## 
### 
My parents told mc they wouldn't let me
apply to schools on the West Coast. I was
never clear on exactly why they made that
stipulation. Maybe they were afraid I would strike
gold, marry a stripper and never come home.
Then I whipped out a U.S. News and World
Report and showed them that Stanford was empiri
cally, objectively and conclusively the very best
school in the country. From there it was pretty easy
to empirically, objectively and conclusively convince
them that I had absolutely no chance of getting in.

So they grudgingly let mc apply here. But not to
Berkeley.
After finishing my application during play
rehearsal, I brought it home to the parents for
spelling corrections.
"You're not really going to hand this in, are you?"
I knew this wasn't a good sign.
Then my parents slowly turned toward me and
gave me that twisted Jack Nicholson smile —
assured that I was taking that one last crucial step
away from the talented and busty Carol Doda.
These were the memories parading around in my
mind when I marched in the admission office to look
at my Work Card — the so-called "inter-office
memo" commenting upon the merits and demerits
of my application. The one they made sure to tell us
we were "never meant to see."
If that isn't an invitation to look, then I don't

know what to make of that flimsy little
lock my parents had installed on their bed
room door.
Like everyone else in the crowded room,
I was oddly nervous. Only the reason they
were nervous was because Dean Jean
might have mentioned the embarrassing
"B" they got in gym in ninth grade due to
"feminine problems." My concerns were
much more serious.
Everyone else had already gotten their
Work Cards. They started to make me ner
vous, asking questions like "What does
'poss. Nob. laur.' mean?' " Meanwhile, my
card was nowhere in sight.
My mind started to reel. "If they made a
mistake, can they send me home? Can
they send me to U. Penn? What if U. Penn
made a mistake? What does Dean Jean
look like naked?"
Finally it came. The word "swim" was
circled with a big red marker. A "swim" is
hip, '90s admission lingo for someone who
really shouldn't get in, but whose name
would make one of those cute, thematic
Branner rooms. So I swam. I probably
swam the English Channel and back.
Then I read further. The comments flew
out of the Work Card and swirled around
my head like the plot of a badly produced
Shakespearean comedy. Only I couldn't
tell who was in drag and who wasn't.
"He could drive you crazy."
"Not appropriate."
"It all depends on your perspective."
"Hormonal overdrive."
And what really hurt — more than call
ing me annoying or inappropriate, more
than the Nietzschean deconstruction of
my careful hermeneutics, even more than
their clairvoyant appraisal of my stifled
future sex life — was the overwhelming
sense of whimsy displayed by these three
giddy Fates of Academia.
There were two — yes, two — smiley
faces drawn on my card.
I was out to kill.
But before I got up and demanded to

know exactly who had drawn the little bald
guy with the tongue sticking out, I read the
three words that broke my fragile little
heart almost as much as the perennial fail
ure of the Great Pumpkin:
"Not especially funny."
I had learned to live with "annoying." I
had learned to live with sexual frustration.
But I had always prided myself on being
able to make people laugh at other people's
misfortunes, no matter how painful or life
debilitating they may be.
But before I wrote that angry letter
where I tell Dean Jean what she can do
with her "Bravo," I demanded to see my
application. Actually, I asked nicely. But it
worked.
In answer to the incriminating question
"Is there anything else we should know
about you?" the feisty lad of 17 had kindly
provided the "Top Ten Other Things You
Should Know About Joel Stein," which
included, "Babes will be coming in and out
of the room so often it'll seem like the bus
depot across the street from Barbazon."
I started to see where they were coming
from.
To be honest, there was nothing like
able in the snotty, lecherous teenager teem
ing out of my application. I wouldn't have
even thrown him a kickboard.
And I knew that in some strange way, I
had forced myself to try to live up to the image
on that application. Maybe I even prevented
myself from having beautiful, meaningful
sex. Or maybe it was just a bad haircut.
Dismayed, swimming and about to
leave the office, I started to skim the rest of
my essay:
"I was using humour [sic] as a crutch;
trying to hide some of my insecurities
behind a barrage of jokes instead of facing
my fears. It wasn't to the point where I
couldn't open up and be honest with peo
ple, but it sometimes prevented me from
getting closer with them. More often, it
prevented me from getting closer to
myself."
What a snotty little brat. No wonder he
didn't get laid.
