# Oooh, baby—I was a a fool to apply here
## 
### 
My parents told mc they wouldn't let me
apply to schools on the West Coast. I was
never clear on exactly why they made that
stipulation. Maybe they were afraid I would strike
gold, marry a stripper and never come home.
Then I whipped out a U.S. News and World
Report and showed them that Stanford was empiri
cally, objectively and conclusively the very best
school in the country. From there it was pretty easy
to empirically, objectively and conclusively convince
them that I had absolutely no chance of getting in.

So they grudgingly let mc apply here. But not to
Berkeley.
After finishing my application during play
rehearsal, I brought it home to the parents for
spelling corrections.
"You're not really going to hand this in, are you?"
I knew this wasn't a good sign.
Then my parents slowly turned toward me and
gave me that twisted Jack Nicholson smile —
assured that I was taking that one last crucial step
away from the talented and busty Carol Doda.
These were the memories parading around in my
mind when I marched in the admission office to look
at my Work Card — the so-called "inter-office
memo" commenting upon the merits and demerits
of my application. The one they made sure to tell us
we were "never meant to see."
If that isn't an invitation to look, then I don't
