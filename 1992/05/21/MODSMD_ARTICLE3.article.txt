# '91 fund raising second highest despite decline

Stanford was among just a few top fund-raising schools to
see a drop in donations last year, falling 11 percent from the
previous year.
Despite the $22.3 million decrease, Stanford was still the
second-best fund-raiser in the nation last year, according to
the Chronicle of Higher Education. Among colleges national
ly, only Harvard raised more money â€” and Harvard's total
also declined last year, falling by 8 percent.
Nationally, private giving to colleges rose by 4 percent in
the 1990-91 fiscal year. Factoring inflation, schools regis
tered a very slight decrease in donations overall.
Although Stanford's decline exceeded the national aver
age, Communication Director Elizabeth Sloan said officials at
the Office of Development are not worried.
"It's well within normal fluctuation," she said.
Stanford raised $202 million in 1989-90 and fell to $181 mil
lion last year. Among the top 20 in fund raising, only four other
schools saw their totals decline, according to the Chronicle.
There were many reasons for the drop, Sloan said, and all
were predictable.
Because the last fiscal year was the height of the indirect
cost controversy, she said "the negative publicity could have
hurt us on the margin."
But Sloan added that while some donors were justifiably con
cerned, the controversy was "not at the top of the list" of reasons.
During 1989-90, Stanford was "in the middle" of its five
year Centennial Campaign, where Stanford's "best, closest
donors pledged," she said.
The economy was in a better condition and people's dis
posable incomes were higher, she said, while last year the
economy worsened and fund raising wasn't as intense near
the end of the campaign.
"We don't compare notes," with other universities, she
said, but "we all did well during the economic boom, and all
felt the recession."
However, officials at some other schools said the recession
has not hit them as hard.
