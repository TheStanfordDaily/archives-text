# '91 fund raising second highest despite decline
## 
### Anush Yegyazarian Staff writer 
Stanford was among just a few top fund-raising schools to
see a drop in donations last year, falling 11 percent from the
previous year.
Despite the $22.3 million decrease, Stanford was still the
second-best fund-raiser in the nation last year, according to
the Chronicle of Higher Education. Among colleges national
ly, only Harvard raised more money — and Harvard's total
also declined last year, falling by 8 percent.
Nationally, private giving to colleges rose by 4 percent in
the 1990-91 fiscal year. Factoring inflation, schools regis
tered a very slight decrease in donations overall.
Although Stanford's decline exceeded the national aver
age, Communication Director Elizabeth Sloan said officials at
the Office of Development are not worried.
"It's well within normal fluctuation," she said.
Stanford raised $202 million in 1989-90 and fell to $181 mil
lion last year. Among the top 20 in fund raising, only four other
schools saw their totals decline, according to the Chronicle.
There were many reasons for the drop, Sloan said, and all
were predictable.
Because the last fiscal year was the height of the indirect
cost controversy, she said "the negative publicity could have
hurt us on the margin."
But Sloan added that while some donors were justifiably con
cerned, the controversy was "not at the top of the list" of reasons.
During 1989-90, Stanford was "in the middle" of its five
year Centennial Campaign, where Stanford's "best, closest
donors pledged," she said.
The economy was in a better condition and people's dis
posable incomes were higher, she said, while last year the
economy worsened and fund raising wasn't as intense near
the end of the campaign.
"We don't compare notes," with other universities, she
said, but "we all did well during the economic boom, and all
felt the recession."
However, officials at some other schools said the recession
has not hit them as hard.
Rice University's acting director of annual funds, Jan
Shapley, said that Rice's dona
tions have "gone right on up"
despite the recession.
"We had increased publicity
due to the economic summit that
was held [at Rice]," she said.
"That had a big effect."
In addition, Shapley said,
Money Magazine rated Rice as the
"best buy" in higher education,
which resulted in more applicants
and national attention.

Shapley added that Texas
hasn't "felt the crunch as much as
the rest of the U.S."
Donations also have risen at
Cornell, where the school is in the
midst of a five-year fund-raising
campaign, according to Inge
Reichenbach, Cornell's director of
university development.
Still, after tripling efforts, Cor
nell has seen an increase of only
10 percent this year, Reichenbach
said. One reason for the less
than-expected rise, she said, is
that some alumni — especially
those in the real estate field —
may not be able to donate as

much because of the economy.
According to Sloan, no matter
how much money a university
raises each year, it does not auto
matically translate into improve
ments in student life or an insti
tution's fiscal health.
"Not very much of the $1.3 bil
lion raised in the campaign made
it into the operating budget,"
Sloan said.
The money tends to be restrict
ed to items on the featured objec
tives list, including more money
for athletic endowment and
endowed professorships, she said.
And for information about
improvements in student life,
Sloan said it is much better to
look at endowment totals and
endowment for faculty appoint
ments.
"That touches student life and
the quality of education," she
said. Stanford gained almost 90
professorships and $43 million in
endowed scholarships during the
Centennial Campaign, according
to Sloan.
But the money from the five
year campaign didn't do much to
help Stanford's fiscal problems,
she said, because gift funds are
often restricted to certain projects.
Some endowments may actual
ly cost money. For example, when
the University receives money for
new facilities it usually has to pick
up the cost of maintenance. The
University is currently consider
ing a plan to require endowments
for facilities to include the costs of
upkeep.
"We're beginning to endow
buildings for operations and
maintenance," Sloan said, but
"it's tough money to raise."
"Donors want their money to
make a difference, to see their
money have an impact," she said.
"It takes a close friendship and a
long relationship to make donors
understand the financial dynam
ics of why money like that is so
important."
