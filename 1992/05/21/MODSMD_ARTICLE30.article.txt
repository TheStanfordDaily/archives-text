# 'Death of the Last Black Man...'
## Cryptic play explores fate of black Americans 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
If you're into the esoteric, "The
Death of the Last Black Man in
the Whole Entire World" is a
must-see.
Written by Suzan-Lori Parks,
the play takes an unconventional
approach to presenting black his
tory and the fate of black people.
It depends heavily on symbol
ism and allusion to black folklore
and African legend to introduce to
the audience the concept of black
history continually being "killed
off" — stolen, buried and denied
— by white society.
The play's main character is
the last black man on earth —
Black Man with Watermelon, who
has died and is hovering in some
sort of limbo state between life
and the Promised Land. He tries
to reach the Promised Land, but is
prevented from doing so by the
spirits of black culture.
The show's director, Drama
Prof. Harry Elam, said that "before
[Black Man] dies, he has to pass
his legacy to his wife."
Elam added that the spirits
"keep sending him back to her"
until he completes this task. By
not fulfilling his duty, Black Man
with Watermelon, played by
junior Clark Jackson, is failing "to
take control of his history and his
fate," Elam said.
The spirits tell Black Man and
his wife, Black Woman with Fried

Drumstick, played by Palo Alto
resident Viera Whye: "You've got
to write [your history] down and
hide it under a rock" over and over
and over and over.
Repetition is an integral part of
"The Death of the Last Black
Man." The meaning is inter
spersed throughout the play in bits
of dialogue, and due to the use of
heavy Black Vernacular English, it
is imperative that critical lines be
repeated so an audience unfamil
iar with BVE can understand the
play.
Unfortunately, the language is
one of the biggest barriers to com
prehending "The Death of the
Last Black Man." According to
Elam, Parks intended the language
"to work almost as a musical
score."
Parks felt the dialogue was "the
theatrical equivalent of a jazz riff,"
and like jazz, it does not follow a
traditional pattern and it utilizes
repetition, Elam added.
Yet Parks' avant-garde style of
repeating phrases and playing
with words only becomes confus
ing, especially with her use of
BVE. Some of the dialect appears
to be contrived. For instance,
Parks' occasional use of triple neg
atives and the non-systematic use
of the copula and copula-absence
made it increasingly difficult to
follow the action.

screens hanging from the ceiling.
All of this — music, acting,
background, imagery — leaves the
viewer with an overwhelming
sense of black struggle and black
history regardless of the difficulties
presented by the script.

Repetition is an integral part of
"The Death of the Last Black
Man." The meaning is inter

of dialogue, and due to the use of
heavy Black Vernacular English, it
is imperative that critical lines be
repeated so an audience unfamil

play.
Unfortunately, the language is
one of the biggest barriers to com
prehending "The Death of the
Last Black Man." According to
Elam, Parks intended the language
"to work almost as a musical
score."
Parks felt the dialogue was "the
theatrical equivalent of a jazz riff,"
and like jazz, it does not follow a
traditional pattern and it utilizes
repetition, Elam added.
Yet Parks' avant-garde style of
repeating phrases and playing
with words only becomes confus
ing, especially with her use of
BVE. Some of the dialect appears
to be contrived. For instance,
Parks' occasional use of triple neg
atives and the non-systematic use
of the copula and copula-absence
made it increasingly difficult to
follow the action.

If you're into the esoteric, "The
Death of the Last Black Man in
the Whole Entire World" is a
must-see.
Written by Suzan-Lori Parks,
the play takes an unconventional
approach to presenting black his
tory and the fate of black people.
It depends heavily on symbol
ism and allusion to black folklore
and African legend to introduce to
the audience the concept of black
history continually being "killed
off" — stolen, buried and denied
— by white society.
The play's main character is
the last black man on earth —
Black Man with Watermelon, who
has died and is hovering in some
sort of limbo state between life
and the Promised Land. He tries
to reach the Promised Land, but is
prevented from doing so by the
spirits of black culture.
The show's director, Drama
Prof. Harry Elam, said that "before
[Black Man] dies, he has to pass
his legacy to his wife."
Elam added that the spirits
"keep sending him back to her"
until he completes this task. By
not fulfilling his duty, Black Man
with Watermelon, played by
junior Clark Jackson, is failing "to
take control of his history and his
fate," Elam said.
