# Exhibits at Santa Clara museum powerful
## Photos, crayon drawings portray complexities of life in Central America 
### Ed Heinemann Staff writer 
On my way into the de Saisset Museum in
Santa Clara, I decided to stop at the front desk
and ask the man behind it a little bit about the
place. He seemed the jovial sort, with his
twitching grin and arms crossed loosely over
his chest, and I was in a jovial enough mood
myself to take him up on his offering of cheer.
The man jabbered brightly for several min
utes about the various wonders the museum
had in store for me, and only slowed slightly to
tell me that the featured exhibit, "Guatemalan
Guernica: Children of War," might be difficult
to take standing up.
So much for my dose of sunshine. I wasn't
only suddenly depressed, but befuddled as well:
What was this man, standing here frightening
off patrons with the specter of the pain they
would feel in a gallery downstairs, so damn
happy about?
It took me an hour or so of mind-wiggling
exhibits to realize that the incongruity of the
man's demeanor with his message made more
sense than any consistent reaction possibly
could.
From the first exhibit, a series of pho
tographs of modem descendents of the ancient
Maya, to the last, crayon pictures by children
forced to flee civil war in Guatemala, the muse
um's images present despair and exhilaration
hand-in-hand, and make it hard to imagine
that they were ever separable.
The Mayan photographs, which occupy
almost the entire upper level of the museum,
provide less of an immediate jolt than a stark,
but emotionally intricate, collective portrait.
Mac Duff Everton, an American, spent the
greater part of 20 years on Mexico's Yucatan
Peninsula, living in Mayan villages and chroni
cling the effect of 20th-century technology on

the ancient civilization, and the effort shows.
Each photograph, generally of one of Ever
ton's friends involved in a daily routine, is
accompanied by a short piece of text — in
English and Spanish, appropriately enough —
describing the person and his or her activity.

The museum's images pre
sent despair and exhilara
tion hand-in-hand, and
make it hard to imagine that
they were ever separable.

The captions can be a bit chatty — "Here's
Diego. We once got drunk together," and the
like — but that's almost part of their charm,
and their power: The sense that the photogra
pher genuinely knows his subjects, that he isn't
invading their cultural space, but sharing it,
makes the project both legitimate and emotion
ally accessible.
What emerges from the photographs them
selves is a subtle, but undeniable sense of humor
and life amidst grinding poverty and cultural tur
moil. In one photo, a shirtless man standing in
front of his hut swats at his smiling child, the
beginning of a grin curling his own dour lips.
In another, a married couple stares stolidly
at the camera as a television glimmers in the
foreground, with a large cross and a guitar
hanging on the wall behind them. The odd
hybrid of Spanish, Mayan and American cul
tures that their hut has become isn't so much
lost on the pair as it is irrelevant to them; a
white man's irony, not theirs.

The strength of the exhibit, ultimately, is
that the Maya come across not as downtrodden
heroes, or mysterious, noble savages, but peo
ple, with flaws and strengths, and that speaks
volumes for the photographer.
Downstairs, past the requisite — but admit
tedly captivating and well-presented — collec
tion of Santa Clara historical memorabilia, and
a room of surprisingly worthwhile contempo
rary paintings, are the children's drawings. 1
was able to stand up, despite the man's warn
ing, but I was anything but settled when I
walked out.
The drawings, collected in Mexican refugee
camps in 1985, are noticeably short on flowers
and smiling suns. Most show helicopters drop
ping bombs and soldiers in camouflage shoot
ing people. Bullets drip out of guns in crooked
lines and cause physiologically unlikely
wounds just like American boys' second-grade
war fantasies, but these are no fantasies.
On one picture, a girl writes that she is waiting
for her mama and papa, who are already dead.
The stick figure representing the girl has no smile
or frown on its face, but her feelings are clear The
girl, tiny and bent, stands next to a giant, loom
ing soldier, whose gun points at her head.
Yet the color and shading of the crayons
occasionally shines with a certain vigor. And
these children have, after all, given their feel
ings a voice (if this isn't art, then what is?). And
poems interspersed with the drawings express
hope for a hopeless land.
And when I walk out past the man at the
front desk, Mayan and Guatemalan faces in my
head, I want to smile and groan, and to tell the
man at the desk I understand him now.

The museum's images pre
sent despair and exhilara
tion hand-in-hand, and
make it hard to imagine that
they were ever separable.

The captions can be a bit chatty — "Here's
Diego. We once got drunk together," and the
like — but that's almost part of their charm,
and their power: The sense that the photogra
pher genuinely knows his subjects, that he isn't
invading their cultural space, but sharing it,
makes the project both legitimate and emotion
ally accessible.
What emerges from the photographs them
selves is a subtle, but undeniable sense of humor
and life amidst grinding poverty and cultural tur
moil. In one photo, a shirtless man standing in
front of his hut swats at his smiling child, the
beginning of a grin curling his own dour lips.
In another, a married couple stares stolidly
at the camera as a television glimmers in the
foreground, with a large cross and a guitar
hanging on the wall behind them. The odd
hybrid of Spanish, Mayan and American cul
tures that their hut has become isn't so much
lost on the pair as it is irrelevant to them; a
white man's irony, not theirs.

The strength of the exhibit, ultimately, is
that the Maya come across not as downtrodden
heroes, or mysterious, noble savages, but peo
ple, with flaws and strengths, and that speaks
volumes for the photographer.
Downstairs, past the requisite — but admit

a room of surprisingly worthwhile contempo

The drawings, collected in Mexican refugee
camps in 1985, are noticeably short on flowers

war fantasies, but these are no fantasies.

And when I walk out past the man at the
front desk, Mayan and Guatemalan faces in my
head, I want to smile and groan, and to tell the
man at the desk I understand him now.

On my way into the de Saisset Museum in
Santa Clara, I decided to stop at the front desk
and ask the man behind it a little bit about the
place. He seemed the jovial sort, with his
twitching grin and arms crossed loosely over
his chest, and I was in a jovial enough mood
myself to take him up on his offering of cheer.
The man jabbered brightly for several min
utes about the various wonders the museum
had in store for me, and only slowed slightly to
tell me that the featured exhibit, "Guatemalan
Guernica: Children of War," might be difficult
to take standing up.
So much for my dose of sunshine. I wasn't
only suddenly depressed, but befuddled as well:
What was this man, standing here frightening
off patrons with the specter of the pain they
would feel in a gallery downstairs, so damn
happy about?
It took me an hour or so of mind-wiggling
exhibits to realize that the incongruity of the
man's demeanor with his message made more
sense than any consistent reaction possibly
could.
From the first exhibit, a series of pho
tographs of modem descendents of the ancient
Maya, to the last, crayon pictures by children
forced to flee civil war in Guatemala, the muse
um's images present despair and exhilaration
hand-in-hand, and make it hard to imagine
that they were ever separable.
The Mayan photographs, which occupy
almost the entire upper level of the museum,
provide less of an immediate jolt than a stark,
but emotionally intricate, collective portrait.
Mac Duff Everton, an American, spent the
greater part of 20 years on Mexico's Yucatan
Peninsula, living in Mayan villages and chroni
cling the effect of 20th-century technology on

the ancient civilization, and the effort shows.
Each photograph, generally of one of Ever
ton's friends involved in a daily routine, is
accompanied by a short piece of text — in
English and Spanish, appropriately enough —
describing the person and his or her activity.
