## Beaux Arts Trio lives up to its name on new CD 
### Russell Hancock 
When the Beaux Arts Trio came to Stan
ford last October, they played to 400 empty
seats in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
But the 300 people who were there were
treated to definitive Haydn, delightful
Brahms and some unusually absorbing
Faure. They left feeling somehow changed by
what they had witnessed.
Apparently Stanford folks haven't heard
that this is the Beaux Arts Trio. Where cham
ber music is heard or performed they are a
household word.
Saying they are the leading piano trio in
the world is like saying the Pacific Ocean is
one of the largest bodies of water.
There is no award they have not received
in 35 years, no part of trio literature left
unrecorded. People recognize them in air
ports, even.
This month's Philips release is a fine place
to start developing an acquaintance with the
work of these masters.
In a pairing of Smetana and Mendelssohn,
the violin-cello-piano trio provide abundant
evidence of why they are universally regarded
as the touchstone of excellence in this most
intimate of musical forms. Music like this
stirs a sense of elation so strong that one
almost feels improved by it.
Alert and sensitive, the Mendelssohn is
marked by an unusually sure sense of pace.
Menahem Pressler's fingers twinkle away on
the piano, and in a live performance, you will
readily see how the twinkle in his hands is
latched securely to the twinkle in his eyes.
The man is positively ebullient, elf-like in
comportment; you would think him utterly
incapable of producing angst in the Smetana

were it not for the fact that he produces it,
magician-like, with a flurry of grimaces,
pouts and goldfish contortions, though none
of these renders his face less cherubic.

Saying they are the lead
ing piano trio in the
world is like saying the
Pacific Ocean is one of
the largest bodies of
water.

Isodore Cohen's violin and Peter Wiley's
cello exchange angst for mischief on the disc,
in volatile and exuberant alternation. There
is no sense between them of power in
reserve.
Yet there is neither any sense of passion
unbridled. This CD presents a profoundly
affecting statement of complete artistic con
trol.
Allegro energico e con fuoco, molto allegro
quasi presto, meno presto, tranquillo assai â€”
these tempo markings are followed to the let
ter.
The raised eyebrow, the stem glare cast
from Cohen to Wiley were, of course, inter
esting and apparent in that intimate atmo
sphere at Dinkelspiel last fall. Listeners, on
the other hand, will appreciate these big
things on this marvelous new release, even
though they cannot possibly view the little
things that produce them.
