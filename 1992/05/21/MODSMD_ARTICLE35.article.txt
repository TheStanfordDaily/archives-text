# Movie
## Intriguing 'Alien 3' trades piercing suspense for low-tech 
### Chris Shuttles worth Staff writer 
As the summer movie season officially
kicks into gear this Memorial Day week
end, "Alien'/' which opens tomorrow,
leads off the string of eagerly anticipated
blockbusters that will dazzle or disappoint
audiences for the next three months.
Unfortunately, diehard "Alien" fans,
who've been starved for the next install
ment in the saga of Lt. Ellen Ripley
(Sigourney Weaver) will probably be let
down by the new film.
To be sure, "Alien'" is an enjoyable piece
of cinema, eminently watchable and not
without its share of thrills. But, ironically,

what makes "Alien'" a good film is what
will probably turn off its built-in audience.
There are no weapons at all in this edi
tion of the war against sinister eight-foot,
acid-blooded, man-eating space creatures
who follow Ripley around like a plague.
Unlike the action-packed "Aliens," the
special effects certainly aren't the star of
this show.
"Alien 1 " thankfully also avoids the use
of the in-your-face "Boo!" tactic so com
mon in other films of this genre. You
know, it gets all quiet and the character on
screen starts to look nervous, when all of a
sudden the screen fills with the bogeyman
and the Dolby stereo blasts your eardrums.
Decidedly low-tech, the film instead

evokes a constant state of tension and its
niftiest effect is the final chase sequence
shown from the Alien's point of view as it
scampers along walls and ceilings. The
film would have benefited from greater use
of this device.
In this episode (which is almost assured
ly the last), Ripley's spacecraft crash lands
on an abandoned prison planet inhabited
by 25 "double Y" prisoners — mostly mur
derers and rapists — who chose to stay
behind after the colony was evacuated.
They've found God, and the intrusion
of Ripley ("the first temptation they've
had") disrupts their order, as does the
beastie that inevitably makes it appear
ance and wreaks havoc.

Symbolically, Ripley is one of the three
aliens invoked by the title, since she is as
much an intruder as the creature and its
offspring. Weaver's shaved head and a lit
eral symbiosis with the creature completes
the not-so-subtle connection.
While Weaver once again is an engaging
presence on the screen, the attempt by the
filmmakers to invest Ripley with depth
and complexity only muddles the charac
ter. One moment she's mourning the loss
of her surrogate daughter from the previ
ous film, the next she's stupidly saunter
ing alone through the penal colony, and
later she's engaged in a completely gratu
itous and pointless sexual relationship
with the colony's doctor (Charles Dance).

She's especially grating when the script
calls for her to wax inspirational. Instead
she sounds ridiculously insincere, espe
cially when contrasted with the outstand
ing Charles S. Dutton, who plays the spir
itual leader of the colony. Most of the cast
started as stage actors — several, including
Weaver and Dutton, have been nominated
for Tony Awards — and they give solid
performances despite their bald heads,
which make it hard to tell who is who.
The do-or-die test for this film, howev
er, is your willingness to accept the finale.
Without giving it away, suffice to say that
"Terminator 2" director lames Cameron
could probably get "Alien " brought up on
Honor Code violations.
