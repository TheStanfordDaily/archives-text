## Beautiful film probes lives of black women 
### Kiri Zooper 
Julie Dash should be proud. After
several difficult years of indepen
dent filmmaking, the UCLA film
graduate has finally come into the
respect she deserves with "Daugh
ters of the Dust."
Dash produced, wrote and
directed this stunningly original
film about a West African family
living on the Sea Islands off the Car
olinas at the turn of the century.
And, happily, the film has already
met with a tremendous amount of
critical acclaim.
"Daughters of the Dust" traces a
few days in the lives of the Peazant
family, four generations of African-
Americans struggling with tensions
between the pains of the past and
the questions of the future.
At the film's opening, the family
members are preparing to move to the
mainland and begin "a new life." The
film follows the Peazants' personal
struggles as, on the eve of their depar
ture, they seek to define a middle
ground between clinging to the past
and betraying their African heritage.
Using a relatively unknown cast

of fantastic talent, Dash's script lets
the story unfold in a leisurely and
impressionistic way, with little
attention to the usual narrative con
ventions. Respecting the intelligence
of her audience, Dash leaves some
things to the imagination.
Dash's pictures say as much as
her words. This film is the work of a
visual poet. Each image is carefully
created, uniquely executed, fresh,
strong and very original.
Perhaps the most amazing thing
about "Daughters of the Dust" is
that it melds such tremendous visu
al impact with a remarkably sensi
tive storyline. Here are die concerns
of African-American women as they
have rarely, if ever, been addressed
on film.
Better yet, diese concerns are pre
sented from the perspective of a
female African-American filmmak
er — issues of independence, interra
cial romance, marriage, rape, loyal
ty, motherhood, self-determination
and religion. .
There is strength in these
women, and dignity. They are very

real, and Dash's tender script allows us
access to their emotions and the magic of
their interactions with one another.
Perhaps the only negative thing about
"Daughters in the Dust" is the hell Dash had
to endure to get it produced. Despite her
growing reputation as an original new direc
tor, she was unable to obtain financing from
traditional sources.

Studio heads said they loved her award
winning work, but refused to cut her a deal.
Funds for "Daughters of the Dust" were
painstakingly acquired from PBS, the
National Endowment for the Arts and pri
vate investors.
Hopefully the day is not far off when
women of all races will have equal opportu
nities to tell their stories with Hollywood
money.
One way or another, films like "Daugh
ters of the Dust" are the kind that need to be
made and need to be supported by the view
ing public.
