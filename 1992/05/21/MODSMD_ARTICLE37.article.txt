# Improv group strives to go beyond one-liners
## 
### Rosario Rodriguez 
Stammering, stuttering, slur
ring — your face turns red as eyes
bore through your soul expecting
wit, clarity and total control.
This is the nightmare that all
who go on stage deal with at some
point. Leaving practiced theatrics
behind, the Stanford Improvisors
(The Simps) must handle this
traumatic experience weekly.
Spawned from Drama Depart
ment class taught by Patricia
Ryan, The Simps perform
throughout the Stanford campus
and the Bay Area, most recently
showing up at Monday's tribute to
University President Donald
Kennedy. They enacted a golf
scene in which the Kennedys had
to wrap their arms around the
improvisors' torsos. The skit, bol
stered by Don's mad gesticula
tions, was a riot.
Though the skit was short, it was
not inundated with quick one-liners
as one might expect. "We're very
much interested in fun, but not nec
essarily cheap laughs," said Adam
Tobin, a member of the Simps.
"Stand-up comedians don't make
good improv," added Patricia Ryan.
The Stanford Improvisors
became charter members of an
international improv organization
— founded by improv pioneer
Keith Johnstone — last fall. John
stone's approach centers around
two methods, narrative improv
and Theatresports.™
Theatresports™ involve teams
of performers competing against
each other in "Olympic style" to
determine the "winner." As Tobin
pointed out, however, "it's really
clear that it's more important to
have good scenes than to win or
lose." He added that often a team

will loan players to the other team.
The Stanford Improvisors com
pete amongst themselves or
against their nemesis, Bay Area
Theatresports™ (BATS). This Fri
day, May 22, eight Simps will once
again compete against BATS in
San Francisco. At stake is their
equivalent to the Axe, what Tobin
describes as a "rubber chicken
crossed with a baseball bat."
Although in the past Stanford
has never lost the trophy, this
time things could be very different
for our heroes, since they face an
all-star cast of improvisors who
have taught and performed for up
to 15 years. "In the past we've only

played the workshop players,
those who are learning," said
Tobin. "We've never played the
ringers."
But next weekend, May 27-29,
all 25 Simps will return to the
Farm to perform on more familiar
ground — a great opportunity to
catch them if you can't make it up
to the City.
Although Ryan has taught
improv for 15 years, no formal
Stanford group existed until the
fall of 1991, when the Simps
applied to be a voluntary student
organization and members of The
atresports.™ The Simps were the
first university group to join the

organization.
Since then they have dedicated
themselves to teaching and learn
ing improv. Just to be included in
the group, one has to complete a
course taught by Ryan and then
audition.
Beyond the requirements, what
does it take to be a good improvi
sor? A player must be "courageous
enough to fail," according to Ryan.
"If you're not making mistakes
you're not doing improv."
Ryan hopes the group will
develop further through the years.
"We hope that improv can become
an important force in undergradu
ate arts," she said.
