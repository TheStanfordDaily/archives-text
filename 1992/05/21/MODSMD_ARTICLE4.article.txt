# Jackson fires up Mem Aud
## Exhorts students to lead generation of change 
### Sara Skinner Staff writer 
With his characteristically fiery oratory, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson urged students to reach
beyond racial differences to solve the nation's
social and economic problems in a two-hour
speech yesterday.
Jackson addressed a multiracial crowd of
about 1,700 in Memorial Auditorium, mixing
whispers, shouts and dramatic pauses to rouse
the audience. Frequent applause, bursts of laugh
ter and several standing ovations greeted his
efforts.
At the conclusion of the speech, Jackson asked
audience members to get voter registration forms
at the front of the auditorium and then led the
crowd in a chant of "Keep hope alive" and South
African dance steps.

The solution to the nation's problems, Jackson
said, lies with the young. "When young America
comes alive, you have transforming power," he
said.
"I challenge you today at Stanford to take the
lead," he said. "You have the power to put forth a
20-year plan" that includes Head Start, daycare,
education, job training and prenatal care.
When he was young Martin Luther King Jr.
told him to go to seminary, Jackson said, although
he was ready to join the civil rights marchers.
He gave similar advice yesterday, telling stu
dents to "get ready to engage in the struggle for
the rest of your life." That way, when they "go up
to bat" they will carry "a baseball bat instead of a
toothpick."
He also told students not to believe their race
