# Jackson fires up Mem Aud
## Exhorts students to lead generation of change 
### Sara Skinner Staff writer 
With his characteristically fiery oratory, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson urged students to reach
beyond racial differences to solve the nation's
social and economic problems in a two-hour
speech yesterday.
Jackson addressed a multiracial crowd of
about 1,700 in Memorial Auditorium, mixing
whispers, shouts and dramatic pauses to rouse
the audience. Frequent applause, bursts of laugh
ter and several standing ovations greeted his
efforts.
At the conclusion of the speech, Jackson asked
audience members to get voter registration forms
at the front of the auditorium and then led the
crowd in a chant of "Keep hope alive" and South
African dance steps.

The solution to the nation's problems, Jackson
said, lies with the young. "When young America
comes alive, you have transforming power," he
said.
"I challenge you today at Stanford to take the
lead," he said. "You have the power to put forth a
20-year plan" that includes Head Start, daycare,
education, job training and prenatal care.
When he was young Martin Luther King Jr.
told him to go to seminary, Jackson said, although
he was ready to join the civil rights marchers.
He gave similar advice yesterday, telling stu
dents to "get ready to engage in the struggle for
the rest of your life." That way, when they "go up
to bat" they will carry "a baseball bat instead of a
toothpick."
He also told students not to believe their race

or ethnic group held a monopoly on
pain and suffering. "Because you
go to Stanford, you have a multi
cultural education — you ought to
know better," Jackson said.
He chronicled the history of
racism in the United States,
describing not only the exclusion
of blacks but also Jewish, Chinese
and Japanese people.
"It is just as wrong to lock the
Haitians out in 1992," he said. He
also urged students to "appreciate
the burden your neighbor has
borne to make America America."
Talking about the Rodney King
beating, Jackson said "the aberra
tion was not the beating, it was
the camera." He described several
incidents of police violence. "We
must end police brutality, all the
time, everywhere," he added.
"I must judge people by their
response to people who are beaten
and dying," Jackson said. The
three black men who reached out
to save a truck driver attacked in
the riots "are the stars in that
story because they had the char-^

acter," he said.
Jackson said he is helping plan
a "national day of protest" on June
19, which will include multicultur
al sessions, marches and rallies.
Jackson criticized President
Bush's trade mission to Japan sev
eral times during his speech.
"Bush led an expedition to
Japan for international affirma
tive action," he said. "It was so
convoluted (that) when he
thought about, it he choked on
spaghetti."
After laughter from the crowd
died down, Jackson went on to
explain that the United States is
responsible for the decision to
defend Japan, and for manufac
turing "bombers" instead of "tele
visions, cars and radios."
"We're the best in the world at
making what ain't nobody buying
— big stuff" such as weapons,
Jackson said.
As part of the peace settle
ments concluding World War 11,
the United States and its allies
restricted Japan's military spend
ing to 1 percent of its gross nation
al product.
Even though the United States
"set the terms" after World War
11, Jackson said, in the face of eco

nomic problems Americans blame
other nations. "When we panic,
we look for scapegoats," he said.
However, Jackson pointed out
that U.S. companies often own
businesses in other nations.
"The Taiwanese do not own
Nike in Taiwan," he said. "We
turn on them like they sneaked
up and took our jobs. It's not
true."
Jackson said the United States
should let Japan and Germany
"defend themselves. We need the
money."
"Let's put those defense work
ers back to work building America
from the inside out," he said.
The United States should also
follow the Japanese example of
"paying teachers what they pay
their doctors and lawyers" and
researching "useful products," like
high speed trains instead of space
ships, he said.
To make these changes, Jack
son said, leadership is necessary.
"Bush won't do any better," he
said sarcastically. "Quayle
doesn't know any better."
Amid laughter from the audi
ence, he added, "One of the bene
fits I get from Quayle is that he
keeps my self-confidence high."
