# In The Garden
## Magical Rodin collection inspires ritual, romance 
### Molly Valim 
A dry breeze sweeps across the almost deserted campus as
dusk on this spring vacation afternoon. Alone on their mis
sion, 19 women ascend the steps in the Rodin Sculpture Gar
den and assemble together in a line.
High above their heads sits "The Thinker," just one com
ponent of the mysterious and foreboding "Gates of Hell." On
the count of three, they bend over slowly, and all that can be
seen are 19 paper crescents attached to the 19 rear ends.
The participants in this strange ritual are members of the
Women's Novice Crew team, and as a part of their initiation they
were asked by the Varsity team to "moon" the Rodin garden.
It is unlikely that such purposes for Stanford's Rodin
Sculpture Garden were thought of at the time of its dedica
tion in May 1984. The second largest concentration of sculp
tures by Auguste Rodin in the world, and the largest collec
tion outdoors, the garden took four years to build and spans
exactly one acre.
Although others contributed, the majority of sculptures
are the gifts of the donor after whom the Garden derives its
official name, the B. Gerald Cantor Rodin Sculpture Garden.
Before the Stanford Museum's closing due to the 1989
earthquake, the Western Terrace's link to the Rodin Rotun
da of the Museum allowed visitors to enter and learn about
the sculptures they had just viewed outside.
The ways in which the Rodin Garden has been put to use
by the Stanford community appear to be endless. Several
classes are held there, including certain French courses,
drawing courses and Art Prof. Albert Elsen's class on the
Rodin sculptures themselves.
Receptions, weddings, reunions, picnics and memorials
have all found their way into the Garden as well.
Other less formal events also are held at the Garden.
Often many students are seen studying there, apparently
finding it a sunny alternative to Meyer Library. Students
and faculty alike see it as an optimal site to eat lunch, and
both staff and patients at the Stanford Hospital frequently
make the trip over to the Garden as well.

as a "must-see" on their itinerary.
Last week during his visit, former
Soviet president Mikhail Gor
bachev was given a tour through
the Garden.
Over the years, the Rodin
Sculpture Garden has acquired
another — and to many equally
important — role beyond being
home to a magnificent art collec
tion.
The Rodin Sculpture Garden
has surpassed the often less-than

picturesquely-full Lake Lagunita
as the ultimate site for romantic
interludes on the Stanford cam
pus.
A tablecloth, grapes, aged
cheese, crackers and sparkling
beverages, all packed neatly into a
picnic basket, comprise Stanford
students' recommended recipe for
a memorable evening among the
sculptures.
Anniversary celebrations,
birthday surprises, fraternity and
sorority events and even first
dates all have found their place on
the picnic tables and benches sur
rounding the Garden.
Freshman Mike Winnick

received advice from a knowledge
able upperclassman concerning
the Garden's appeal. He said he
was told by a fraternity brother,
"Take a girl you are interested in
to the Garden for a romantic pic
nic dinner."
He also was advised to make
sure and go late, sometime
around 11 p.m., because "all of
the (Garden's outdoor) lights
click off at midnight." For these
people, the Garden has opened
up a new option besides the pos
sible "CoHo and Flicks" evening
out.
Perhaps the most striking
aspect of the Garden is the fact

that there are no fences and no
walls surrounding it, and no
guards to protect the Garden
from harm.
It is open to all the world 24
hours a day, seven days a week,
365 days a year. It is the only cul
tural site at Stanford that is free
to everyone all of the time.
Freshman Eloise Lawrence
may have summed up the Gar
den's appeal best when she said,
"It's beautiful and magnificent. I
first went to see it as a Pro Fro,
and it was half of the reason I
came here."
"To me, the Garden was Stan
ford," she added.

have all found their way into the Garden as well.
Other less formal events also are held at the Garden.
Often many students are seen studying there, apparently
finding it a sunny alternative to Meyer Library. Students
and faculty alike see it as an optimal site to eat lunch, and
both staff and patients at the Stanford Hospital frequently
make the trip over to the Garden as well.
Visitors to the campus appear to have designated the Garden

Peter Gremett, a visitor from San Jose State University, gets a close-up shot of the
"Gates of Hell," the centerpiece of the collection in the Rodin Sculpture Garden.
as a "must-see" on their itinerary.
Last week during his visit, former
Soviet president Mikhail Gor
bachev was given a tour through
the Garden.
Over the years, the Rodin
Sculpture Garden has acquired
another — and to many equally
important — role beyond being
home to a magnificent art collec
tion.
The Rodin Sculpture Garden
has surpassed the often less-than

picturesquely-full Lake Lagunita
as the ultimate site for romantic
interludes on the Stanford cam
pus.
A tablecloth, grapes, aged
cheese, crackers and sparkling
beverages, all packed neatly into a
picnic basket, comprise Stanford
students' recommended recipe for
a memorable evening among the
sculptures.
Anniversary celebrations,
birthday surprises, fraternity and
sorority events and even first
dates all have found their place on
the picnic tables and benches sur
rounding the Garden.
Freshman Mike Winnick

received advice from a knowledge
able upperclassman concerning
the Garden's appeal. He said he
was told by a fraternity brother,
"Take a girl you are interested in
to the Garden for a romantic pic
nic dinner."
He also was advised to make
sure and go late, sometime
around 11 p.m., because "all of
the (Garden's outdoor) lights
click off at midnight." For these
people, the Garden has opened
up a new option besides the pos
sible "CoHo and Flicks" evening
out.
Perhaps the most striking
aspect of the Garden is the fact

that there are no fences and no
walls surrounding it, and no
guards to protect the Garden
from harm.
It is open to all the world 24
hours a day, seven days a week,
365 days a year. It is the only cul
tural site at Stanford that is free
to everyone all of the time.
Freshman Eloise Lawrence
may have summed up the Gar
den's appeal best when she said,
"It's beautiful and magnificent. I
first went to see it as a Pro Fro,
and it was half of the reason I
came here."
"To me, the Garden was Stan
ford," she added.
