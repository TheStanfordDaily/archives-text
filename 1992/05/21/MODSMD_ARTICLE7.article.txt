Thai king lectures general, opposition leader
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) â€” Pressured by the nation's
revered king, a humbled Prime Minister Suchinda Kraprayoon
promised Thursday to back democratic reforms after the army
failed to crush demonstrations against military dominance of the
government.
Suchinda also announced he was freeing opposition leader
Chamlong Srimuang and thousands of other people arrested since
mass anti-government rallies turned violent on Sunday night.
National television showed King Bhumibol Adulyadej lectur
ing Suchinda and Chamlong as they knelt before him at the royal
palace. Suchinda and Chamlong then addressed the nation
together, pledging to cooperate in finding a peaceful solution to
the crisis, which left at least 40 dead and 600 wounded.
Suchinda freed Chamlong for the meeting with the king.
Thousands of soldiers, supported by armored personnel carri
ers and jeeps mounted with machine guns, shot, beat and chased
protesters for three days but could not stamp out demonstrations
demanding Suchinda's resignation. Protesters were angry that
Suchinda, a former military chief who led a coup last year, was
appointed prime minister.
