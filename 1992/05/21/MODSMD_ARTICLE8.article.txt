# Woman earns guys' respect in H20 polo
## 
### Joelle Linder Staff writer 
As bodies rise to the surface
and race to the opposite end of
the pool, one player's long,
blonde, slightly green-tinted
ponytail hangs out from under
neath the blue cap.
In the mad skirmish to take
control of the bright yellow
water polo ball, sophomore Lynn
Dungan proves different from
the rest of the team members â€”
she's the only woman in the all
male, advanced water polo class.
On the surface, spectators see
water polo as just swimming,
ball passing, goal shooting and
more swimming. But dive below,
and the game is full of kicking,
scratching and grabbing.
Players will grab hold of
bathing suits or even hold down
arms so an opponent can't swim
away, Dungan said in a soft-spo
ken voice that contrasts with
her muscular swimmer's body.
If a player is seen holding
someone down, she said, he or
she can get kicked out of the
game. "So, in order not to get
caught, it can get pretty rough
under the surface," Dungan said.
Do the men play as rough
with her as with the other play
ers? There was no contact
between her and the others at
the beginning of the quarter,
she said, but that is changing.
"The contact that is normal
in water polo is coming out
more," Dungan said. The
added roughness is bubbling

up as the men feel more com
fortable with her in the water
and realize that she is a capable
polo player, she added.
"I think I had to prove
myself in the beginning," Dun
gan explained. Sometimes the
men don't pass the ball to her
as much, she said, which "is
probably good" sometimes
since she has a weaker arm
compared to some of the men.
Dungan spoke of times when
she and one of the men on the
team would be open for a pass
and the ball would be thrown to
the man. However, this is sim
ply the "thrower's judgement
call," since he wants to get the
ball to the strongest player.
While her game isn't as pow
erful as the men's, Dungan said
the men have become more com
fortable having her there
because she can keep up with the
swimming and knows the game.
She's learned a lot from the
other players and used her new
skills and aggressiveness on
Stanford's women's water polo
club team.
At a recent women's tourna
ment where she played a field
position, she said she realized
that her game had become
much more aggressive than
before she had taken the
advanced class.
"I had to tone it down a little
bit," she said. "The game goes
so much faster with guys." It's
much rougher because of the
strength difference, which
"really matters when you're the
only girl playing with all guys."
Many times, Dungan said,
she'd rather pass than try to make
goals because her throw isn't as
powerful or as fast as the men's.
While many of the men have
helped her improve her game, she
said, "a few, you can tell, don't real
ly like having a girl in the pool."
She said that because these playei s
tend to have been on varsity water
polo teams, they get frustrated
when she does something wrong.

One of her teammates, senior
Alan Haynie, said he's had similar
experiences with the "hard-core"
players.
"Sometimes they are pretty
obnoxious," Haynie said. "Some
times they are upset when other
people don't play as well as they do."
In the beginning of the quar
ter, Haynie said, he was also hav
ing difficulties in the game.
"Some people are really good. I
wasn't as good as them and I felt
that they resented it."
Dungan "definitely doesn't play
as well as they do, but neither do
I," Hainie said. She doesn't always
make goal shots when she has the
chance, he said, but at the same

time she will be able to take the
ball away when people don't expect
her to.
"There might be an open posi
tion and she would just smack the
ball and run with it,"he said.
Haynie said when the men on
the other team go up against Dun
gan, they say to themselves, "Oh,
I have time to think a little bit."
They don't hold the ball as
carefully when she's guarding
them, he said.
It would be to the other team's
advantage to play tough with
Dungan, Haynie said, adding that
"you have to be just as rough with
everyone, or else you lose the ball
or make a mistake."
