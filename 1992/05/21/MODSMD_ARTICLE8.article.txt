# Woman earns guys' respect in H20 polo

As bodies rise to the surface
and race to the opposite end of
the pool, one player's long,
blonde, slightly green-tinted
ponytail hangs out from under
neath the blue cap.
In the mad skirmish to take
control of the bright yellow
water polo ball, sophomore Lynn
Dungan proves different from
the rest of the team members â€”
she's the only woman in the all
male, advanced water polo class.
On the surface, spectators see
water polo as just swimming,
ball passing, goal shooting and
more swimming. But dive below,
and the game is full of kicking,
scratching and grabbing.
Players will grab hold of
bathing suits or even hold down
arms so an opponent can't swim
away, Dungan said in a soft-spo
ken voice that contrasts with
her muscular swimmer's body.
If a player is seen holding
someone down, she said, he or
she can get kicked out of the
game. "So, in order not to get
caught, it can get pretty rough
under the surface," Dungan said.
Do the men play as rough
with her as with the other play
ers? There was no contact
between her and the others at
the beginning of the quarter,
she said, but that is changing.
"The contact that is normal
in water polo is coming out
more," Dungan said. The
added roughness is bubbling

up as the men feel more com
fortable with her in the water
and realize that she is a capable
polo player, she added.
"I think I had to prove
myself in the beginning," Dun
gan explained. Sometimes the
men don't pass the ball to her
as much, she said, which "is
probably good" sometimes
since she has a weaker arm
compared to some of the men.
Dungan spoke of times when
she and one of the men on the
team would be open for a pass
and the ball would be thrown to
the man. However, this is sim
ply the "thrower's judgement
call," since he wants to get the
ball to the strongest player.
While her game isn't as pow
erful as the men's, Dungan said
the men have become more com
fortable having her there
because she can keep up with the
swimming and knows the game.
She's learned a lot from the
other players and used her new
skills and aggressiveness on
Stanford's women's water polo
club team.
At a recent women's tourna
ment where she played a field
position, she said she realized
that her game had become
much more aggressive than
before she had taken the
advanced class.
"I had to tone it down a little
bit," she said. "The game goes
so much faster with guys." It's
much rougher because of the
strength difference, which
