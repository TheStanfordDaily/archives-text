# Ballet's color and culture continue

The thunder of feet, tracing intricate pat
terns in unison on the dance mat, shakes
Roble Gym.
Women dancers glide by with their arms
outstretched, holding up the ends of their
white, weblike dresses. Adroitly clutching
black lace fans in their right hands, they bal
ance their upper bodies perfectly. Some
dance with candles on their heads; all move
as if on wheels, prim ballerinas in a huge
music box.
The men wear white pants and gusyaberas,
white shirts that are the only male formal

apparel in the hot and humid Mexican coastal
state of Veracruz. With their hats, they aggra
vate imaginary flames under the feet of the
women, who then reciprocate with their fans.
Once in a while the high-pitched trill of
enthusiasm — or a loud whisper reminding
others where to step next — drifts over the
music, which is often drowned out by the
clamor of feet. Couples form, then break up.
Some of the dancers zip about with faces of
intense concentration, others with looks of
pure bliss.
This March dress rehearsal is preparing
the dancers for the upcoming Ballet Folk
lorico Concierto de la Primavera. This year's
performance — held today and tomorrow in

Dinkelspiel Auditorium — is called Car
naval en Veracruz, and celebrates the pres
ence of other cultures in the Mexican dance
tradition. The performance also includes
dances from Veracruz, Cuba, and Brazil.
The performance is the annual pinnacle
for the group, which recent Stanford gradu
ate Felix Cuevas calls one of the
Chicano/Latino community's strongest tra
ditions. "Ballet Folkorico has a cult follow
ing at Stanford," says Cuevas, one of several

Angeles and written by Director
Susie Cashion and several group
members.
The eight-hour-a-week practices
can be intense, but sophomore
Diana Cardenas said performance
is "a natural high" that "makes all
the practice worth it." And for fifth
year senior Moira O'Brien Hernan
dez, "It's most wonderful when you
have a receptive audience."
Many dancers agree that Jalis
co, the danoe featured at the major
ity of the group's performances
throughout the year — is the most
tiring dance performed. Jalisco is
characterized by heavy, multicol
ored dresses and vigorous skirt
movements. However, the compli
cated footwork and balance needed
for Veracruz makes it the most
challenging, dancers said.
The Cuban dances featured in
this year's show are more sensual
than the stately Veracruz. During
the dress rehearsal, couples touch
each other, undulating and swing
ing their hips suggestively.
Decked out in a rainbow of colors,
a procession of dancers streams
by, and one male dancer twists so
fluidly he appears to have no
bones in his body.
As one dance ends and another
begins, sophomore Jorge Solis and
junior Cindy Avitia run out to join
the other couples. She chides him
for not being ready — Solis is still
tucking his shirt into his pants.
Later, during the Mambo, Solis
holds another dancer high in the
air. The recorded music stops

briefly but the dancers maintain
the rhythm. Some of the dancers,
stealing off stage after their seg
ments, laugh about missed steps.
Gerardo Silva, who graduated in
1988, advises the group afler they
finish. "If someone falls, play along
with it,"the alumnus said. "You
might save the moment by whatev
er you do," he said.
Of course, not all performances
go according to plan. Senior Elise
Langlois recalls changing from a
salsa outfit to a more traditional
dress for a dance "where you turn
and the skirts flare all the way out
so you can see everything under
neath them." She forgot to
change out of the little red salsa
underwear into long white fluffy
bloomers, and a friend told her
that "she could see me all the way
at the very back of the audience."
According to junior Amy
Kostishack, a show requires an
average of four changes. Depend
ing on the region, dancers may
have from two minutes to half an
hour to switch costumes. "We sit
there backstage and dress peo
ple," Langlois said.
Langlois says her favorite part of
being a member is "getting to be
part of the entire production, from
learning the dances to helping make
the set to helping make the cos
tumes, and you learn so much about
all the different aspects of the dance,
which isn't just performing."
Langlois, who first took the
"Mexican Dance and Culture"
class her freshman year, said "I
learned more in that class about
culture than I did anywhere else."
Learning a dance straight from
the source adds depth to the perfor
mance. This summer Moira Her

nandez, a five year veteran, and her
sister Annie, along with five other
dancers, attended a seven day con
ference in the capital of Veracruz.
There they learned from a master
of Veracruz dancing and videotaped
classes, night-time performances
and scenes around town. "We tried
to get a feel for the community, the
sense of being in Veracruz, to bring
back to the group," said Annie Her
nandez, who is a four-year veteran
of the dance group.
For three days they toured the
port city of Veracruz, where they
saw performances in the square.
"That was really special because
we actually got to see how the
dances were meant to be done,"
she said, adding that Cashion has
taught the group that the dances'
beauty lie in their original form.
Besides the footwork, they
strove to bring back the attitude,
Annie Hernandez said. The
women must act confident and
reserved, and should carry their
bodies in a relaxed manner. "Your
feet are doing all this heavy-duty
work," she said, "but it's so hot
and humid in Veracruz that you
cannot do anything else with the
rest of your body."
The main dance featured from
their journey is the carnival dance
Pajaro Carpintero ("Woodpecker").
This year's show is "a monu
mental feat," that includes 60
people, some of whom are actors
from outside the dancing troupe,
Cuevas said. This scale is now
possible because the performing
group has doubled to more than
45 during the last few years.
Such growth has elevated the
tensions among the dancers, some
group members say. Since begin

ning dancers with two quarter's
experience may move into the per
forming group without auditions,
the group's size has increased
unchecked and a wide variety of
abilities have been placed together.
"There are different needs that
weren't being met," Annie Her
nandez said. "I think that could
have been avoided by having an
intermediate group and having
auditions to keep the performing
group's good size to work with."
With two-thirds of this year's
performing group comprised of
beginners, "It's hard to find a
pace. . .to make everyone happy,"
said Hernandez.
Heavy competition for dances
also affected group dynamics, the
Hernandez sisters said. "The
group has changed a lot and we
just weren't prepared to deal with
it," Langlois noted.
Amid these changes, positive
bonding experiences continue to
enrich life as a ballet member.
During a videotaped dress
rehearsal of "Salsa Chicana," Lan
glois had to replace the partner of
Daniel Luna, who was a senior at
the time. "There was one part
where the woman was supposed to
jump down ... and he is supposed
to kick over her head" she said.
"And of course," she said sarcas
tically, "being the woman I am, I
had a problem with that, so I poked
my head up — and I got smacked
in the face with a knee and my nose
got broken. And being the nice,
wonderful man that Daniel is, he
came over to see me all the time
because he breaks my nose.
"We started to get to know
each other, we started to date,
and now we're getting married!"

With two-thirds of this year's

"And of course," she said sarcas

The eight-hour-a-week practices

Diana Cardenas said performance
is "a natural high" that "makes all

Many dancers agree that Jalis
co, the danoe featured at the major

throughout the year — is the most
tiring dance performed. Jalisco is
characterized by heavy, multicol
ored dresses and vigorous skirt
movements. However, the compli

each other, undulating and swing

As one dance ends and another

junior Cindy Avitia run out to join
the other couples. She chides him
for not being ready — Solis is still
tucking his shirt into his pants.
Later, during the Mambo, Solis
holds another dancer high in the

briefly but the dancers maintain

stealing off stage after their seg

Gerardo Silva, who graduated in
1988, advises the group afler they
finish. "If someone falls, play along
with it,"the alumnus said. "You
might save the moment by whatev
er you do," he said.
Of course, not all performances
go according to plan. Senior Elise
Langlois recalls changing from a
salsa outfit to a more traditional
dress for a dance "where you turn
and the skirts flare all the way out
so you can see everything under
neath them." She forgot to
change out of the little red salsa
underwear into long white fluffy
bloomers, and a friend told her
that "she could see me all the way
at the very back of the audience."
According to junior Amy
Kostishack, a show requires an
average of four changes. Depend
ing on the region, dancers may
have from two minutes to half an
hour to switch costumes. "We sit
there backstage and dress peo
ple," Langlois said.
Langlois says her favorite part of
being a member is "getting to be
part of the entire production, from
learning the dances to helping make
the set to helping make the cos
tumes, and you learn so much about
all the different aspects of the dance,
which isn't just performing."
Langlois, who first took the
"Mexican Dance and Culture"
class her freshman year, said "I
learned more in that class about
culture than I did anywhere else."
Learning a dance straight from
the source adds depth to the perfor
mance. This summer Moira Her

nandez, a five year veteran, and her
sister Annie, along with five other
dancers, attended a seven day con
ference in the capital of Veracruz.
There they learned from a master
of Veracruz dancing and videotaped
classes, night-time performances
and scenes around town. "We tried
to get a feel for the community, the
sense of being in Veracruz, to bring
back to the group," said Annie Her
nandez, who is a four-year veteran
of the dance group.
For three days they toured the
port city of Veracruz, where they
saw performances in the square.
"That was really special because
we actually got to see how the
dances were meant to be done,"
she said, adding that Cashion has
taught the group that the dances'
beauty lie in their original form.
Besides the footwork, they
strove to bring back the attitude,
Annie Hernandez said. The
women must act confident and
reserved, and should carry their
bodies in a relaxed manner. "Your
feet are doing all this heavy-duty
work," she said, "but it's so hot
and humid in Veracruz that you
cannot do anything else with the
rest of your body."
The main dance featured from
their journey is the carnival dance
Pajaro Carpintero ("Woodpecker").
This year's show is "a monu
mental feat," that includes 60
people, some of whom are actors
from outside the dancing troupe,
Cuevas said. This scale is now
possible because the performing
group has doubled to more than
45 during the last few years.
Such growth has elevated the
tensions among the dancers, some
group members say. Since begin

ning dancers with two quarter's
experience may move into the per
forming group without auditions,
the group's size has increased
unchecked and a wide variety of
abilities have been placed together.
"There are different needs that
weren't being met," Annie Her
nandez said. "I think that could
have been avoided by having an
intermediate group and having
auditions to keep the performing
group's good size to work with."

to get a feel for the community, the
sense of being in Veracruz, to bring
back to the group," said Annie Her
nandez, who is a four-year veteran
of the dance group.
For three days they toured the
port city of Veracruz, where they
saw performances in the square.
"That was really special because
we actually got to see how the
dances were meant to be done,"
she said, adding that Cashion has
taught the group that the dances'
beauty lie in their original form.
Besides the footwork, they
strove to bring back the attitude,
Annie Hernandez said. The
women must act confident and
reserved, and should carry their
bodies in a relaxed manner. "Your
feet are doing all this heavy-duty
work," she said, "but it's so hot
and humid in Veracruz that you
cannot do anything else with the
rest of your body."
The main dance featured from
their journey is the carnival dance
Pajaro Carpintero ("Woodpecker").
This year's show is "a monu
mental feat," that includes 60
people, some of whom are actors
from outside the dancing troupe,
Cuevas said. This scale is now
possible because the performing
group has doubled to more than
45 during the last few years.
Such growth has elevated the
tensions among the dancers, some
group members say. Since begin

ning dancers with two quarter's
experience may move into the per
forming group without auditions,
the group's size has increased
unchecked and a wide variety of
abilities have been placed together.
"There are different needs that
weren't being met," Annie Her
nandez said. "I think that could
have been avoided by having an
intermediate group and having
auditions to keep the performing
group's good size to work with."
With two-thirds of this year's
performing group comprised of
beginners, "It's hard to find a
pace. . .to make everyone happy,"
said Hernandez.
Heavy competition for dances
also affected group dynamics, the
Hernandez sisters said. "The
group has changed a lot and we
just weren't prepared to deal with
it," Langlois noted.
Amid these changes, positive
bonding experiences continue to
enrich life as a ballet member.
During a videotaped dress
rehearsal of "Salsa Chicana," Lan
glois had to replace the partner of
Daniel Luna, who was a senior at
the time. "There was one part
where the woman was supposed to
jump down ... and he is supposed
to kick over her head" she said.
"And of course," she said sarcas
tically, "being the woman I am, I
had a problem with that, so I poked
my head up — and I got smacked
in the face with a knee and my nose
got broken. And being the nice,
wonderful man that Daniel is, he
came over to see me all the time
because he breaks my nose.
"We started to get to know
each other, we started to date,
and now we're getting married!"
