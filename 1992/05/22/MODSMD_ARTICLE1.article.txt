The thunder of feet, tracing intricate pat
terns in unison on the dance mat, shakes
Roble Gym.
Women dancers glide by with their arms
outstretched, holding up the ends of their
white, weblike dresses. Adroitly clutching
black lace fans in their right hands, they bal

music box.
The men wear white pants and gusyaberas,
white shirts that are the only male formal

apparel in the hot and humid Mexican coastal
state of Veracruz. With their hats, they aggra
vate imaginary flames under the feet of the
women, who then reciprocate with their fans.
Once in a while the high-pitched trill of
enthusiasm — or a loud whisper reminding
others where to step next — drifts over the
music, which is often drowned out by the
clamor of feet. Couples form, then break up.
Some of the dancers zip about with faces of
intense concentration, others with looks of
pure bliss.

performance — held today and tomorrow in

Dinkelspiel Auditorium — is called Car

tradition. The performance also includes
dances from Veracruz, Cuba, and Brazil.
The performance is the annual pinnacle
for the group, which recent Stanford gradu
ate Felix Cuevas calls one of the
Chicano/Latino community's strongest tra
ditions. "Ballet Folkorico has a cult follow
ing at Stanford," says Cuevas, one of several
alumni who still dance with the group.
