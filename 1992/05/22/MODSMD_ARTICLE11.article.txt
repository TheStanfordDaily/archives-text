An open-door policy on
women's self-defense
class may be most fair

SELF DEFENSE for Women,
by definition and design, is a
course specifically geared
toward females. It should continue
to serve women without compro
mising its content or format.
The class should be made avail
able to men, in compliance with the
University's Nondiscriminatory
Policy. However, the original goals
that an all-female environment was
to achieve should not be sacrificed.
Self Defense for Women has
been offered through SWOPSI for
the last 12 years. With SWOPSI
falling victim to the budget axe,
the Feminist Studies Program
offered to fund the class.
This closer association with the
University has brought to the fore
front questions about the course's
apparent discrimination against
men which have threatened fund
ing for the class.
Although the class does not explic
itly exclude men, its content and
nature render men outsiders and
spectators. To effectively address
issues of rape and sexual assault, the
class can hardly provide a completely
sympathetic atmosphere to males.
And men probably understand
this.
Those men who wish to enroll in
the class should realize that it was
created with very geQtJer-ppecific
goals in mind — with issues of
rape and sexual harassment as a
few of its prime focuses. The phys
ical self-defense training sessions
were developed for the female
body's strengths and weaknesses.
And instructors admit that the
class is "aimed at women."
Given these considerations, how
many men will flock eagerly to a
class called Self Defense for
Women? The numbers are hardly
likely to be staggering, since the
class inevitably emphasizes fight

ing skills — to be used against
male rapists.
But if the men demonstrate a
strong and sincere interest in tak
ing the class despite the strong fac
tors opposing their full participa
tion, they should certainly not be
discouraged solely because of their
gender. However, some women feel
they would not be able to fully ben
efit from the class in the presence
of men.
Striking with frighteningly dead
ly force at a punching bag (surro
gate for a potential male attacker),
yelling "No!" at the top of their
lungs and recounting devastating
personal experiences are by them
selves sufficiently challenging.
The class is intended to provide
a safe environment where such
expressions are not inhibited. And
it has done so for thousands of
women over the past 12 years.
It should not stop doing so just
because someone has asked,
"What about men?"
The response to questions of
discrimination and exclusion will
greatly influence the future of the
class, and class organizers should
consider these issues carefully.
Such practices are rarely tolerated
at Stanford.
An attempt to circumvent the
University's Nondiscriminatory
Policy does not seem necessary or
fair to those individuals — men or
women — who sincerely wish to
take the class.
Nevertheless, no compromises
need to be made. The class should
be offered unedited — in its origi
nal form, with its original intent —
to all interested students.
Men who are willing to take a class
intended for women, and women
who are willing to take the class in
the presence of men are both sure to
gain a more complete understanding
of themselves and each other.
Self Defense for Women must
continue to foster a comfortable,
productive environment for all its
students, male or female without
sacrificing its ultimate goal in
mind — empowerment against the
dangers of sexual assault.
