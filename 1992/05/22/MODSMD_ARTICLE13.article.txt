INTERNATIONALLY-RENOWNED
nature photographer Galen Rowell,
author of My Tibet, engaged an audi
ence which filled Memorial Auditorium
last winter, speaking out against the
massive human rights violations and cul
tural and environmental destruction
which has taken place in Tibet since the
Chinese invasion.
The Chinese army, using the pretext
of "abolishing exploitation of man by
man" and bringing "progress" to "back
ward" Tibet, occupied Tibet in the early
19505, and mercilessly squashed a
Tibetan uprising in 1959. This led to the
slaughter of 1.2 million Tibetans. Others
starved after the Chinese replaced tradi
tional barley with wheat, an environmen
tally unsuitable crop, causing a famine.
Hundreds of thousands more fled to
India, including the revered spiritual
leader, the Dalai Lama.
All of the 6,000 Buddhist temples
have been destroyed, except for a handful
which have been preserved to show
tourists. Massive deforestation has
occurred, and wild species, exhaustively
hunted, have virtually disappeared. The
Chinese are currently building the Yam
drok Tso Hydroelectric Plant on one of
Tibet's most sacred lakes.
After the occupation, Tibet was frag
mented as the eastern Amdo and Kham
regions were incorporated into neighbor
ing Chinese provinces. Tibetans may

soon become a minority in their own
land, risking ethnic and cultural dilution,
as China's majority Han population
receives material incentives to live and
work in Tibet.
Friends of Tibet at Stanford, a student
group which has organized events such
as Galen Rowell's presentation, attempts
to educate people at Stanford and
throughout the Bay Area about the
endangered Tibetan culture and the envi
ronmental degradation and human
rights violations in Tibet. The group's
leader, graduate student Michael Bach
mann, emphasizes that while the Tibetan
Buddhist culture was well adapted to the
environment before the invasion, Chi
nese agricultural policy there now basi
cally disregards it.
Many Chinese students at Stanford
have joined the Tibetans in denouncing
the Chinese authorities' human rights
abuses since the June 4, 1989 crackdown
at Beijing's Tienanmen Square. But Uni
versity employee Pema Tashi stresses
that ending the Chinese army's
widespread arrests, tortures and mur
ders in Tibet is not enough. "We are a dis
tinct people, and among our rights is the
right to govern ourselves," she said.
"Tibet has a unique, rich culture, lan
guage and religion, and has a right to
maintain it," independent of Tibet's
hotly-debated legal status, says Allen
Wallace, a doctoral student of Stanford's

Religious Studies department. The
extinction of the Tibetan culture "would
be a tragedy, not only for Tibetans, but
for the whole world," adds Wallace, a for
mer Buddhist monk who taught a SWOP
SI class on Tibetan culture last quarter.
A Tibetan artist teaching in the Bay
Area described emotionally moving
scenes from his recent visit to Tibet's
capital, Lhasa. He viewed desecrated
temples and art, and talked with lamas
who had been imprisoned and tortured
for pleading with tourists to denounce
Chinese abuses. He also witnessed a mis
information campaign carried out by the
Chinese, and the detention of a tourist
for giving out pictures of the Dalai Lama.
Tibet's future is uncertain, but the
eternal optimism of the Dalai Lama, recip
ient of the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize, has
heartened many. Through groups such as
Friends of Tibet, perhaps local awareness
can be increased. But only a dramatic
change in the philosophy of the Chinese
leadership, or much stronger pressure
from as-of-yet lukewarm foreign powers to
reproach China, can help Tibetans fulfill
their dream of self-determination, and
avoid the extinction of their culture that
Allen Wallace and so many others fear.


'Tibet has a
unique, rich
culture, lan
guage and
religion, and
has a right to
maintain it.'
