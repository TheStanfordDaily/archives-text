## University policy on anti-gay acts not clear enough 
### 
This letter is in response to the May
18 Daily story "When 'home' real
ly isn't."
Homophobia in high schools runs
deep and strong. Many high schools are
filled with the social pressure to "prove"
one's heterosexuality, first by intoler
ance, then by violence.
Colleges should not be ivory towers
filled only with discussion of academic
issues, nor should they be places of
social indoctrination. However colleges
should be places where study can take
place in peace, and conflict should be
conducted in an intellectual arena.
This is not intellectual conflict
between fellow students; this is harass
ment and assault.
I came to Stanford believing that I
was escaping the violence of the cities,
where differences in color, ideas and val
ues all too quickly translate from the
head to the fist.
I believe that many students come to

Stanford expecting intellectual, but not
physical conflict.
All of Stanford should then be angry
against students who "set fire to fliers
advertising speakers from the Bisexual,
Gay and Lesbian Speakers' Bureau."
All of Stanford should then be outraged
when a fellow student has "his belongings
— including his shoes and research mate
rials ... thrown from a third floor balcony
several times during fall and winter quar
ter because some members of his all-male
floor suspected he was gay."
All of Stanford should be ashamed of
itself when that student must live in
fear, saying, "Every time 1 stepped into
my dorm, I dreaded walking up the
stairs to go to my room. ... All I did was
just stand in there in the lounge, asking
God why this was happening to me."
It is sad that any human being should
have to live in fear. It is intolerable that
such a condition should exist here at
Stanford.

The role of a university is not social
indoctrination, and Stanford should not
play moral policeman. But there is a dif
ference between promoting intellectual
growth by allowing free speech and turn
ing a blind eye to students violating each
others' legal and civil rights.
There is a difference between debate
and harassment. Open intellectual dis
course and understanding does not occur
in an atmosphere of potential violence —
where one group can openly impose its
will through fear.
The University's ambiguous, non-com
mital attitude is unacceptable. If the Uni
versity wishes to include homosexuality
within the concept of multiculturalism,
then it should make it clear that gay
bashing and harassment is not acceptable
behavior and that the burden of guilt lies
with the gay-bashers, not their victims.
If eliminating all-frosh dorms will
help relieve the tension, then the Uni
versity should consider this option.

The homophobic students who set
fire to gay-related fliers, or those who
destroy a student's property should not
be permitted to rest easy, believing that
their actions will be tolerated.
Students should also assume the
responsibility for creating a truly toler
ant environment within their dorms.
If we cannot leave our prejudices and
hates at the doorstep, then every possible
avenue of communication — from the Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Speakers' Bureau,
to innovative programs such as "Crossing
the Line" — must be opened up in the
hope that it will lead to self-confrontation,
open-forum discussion and a mature
understanding that anti-gay attitudes and
hostility are as destructive as racism.
The perpetuation of an anti-gay atmo
sphere at Stanford should mean that
some of us never grew up, and never left
high school.
