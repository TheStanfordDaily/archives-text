# Grad senators criticize ASSU outdoor trip plan
## 
### 
The ASSU Senate did something
incredibly stupid at its May 20 meeting.
Normally, that would not come as any
surprise. But this time the senate did
something incredibly stupid with $74,407
of our money. It approved an outdoor
trips program for incoming students.
An outdoor trips program is a won
derful idea. However, the proposal that
the ASSU Senate passed Wednesday
night had little to do with outdoor trips,
and a lot to do with paying huge salaries
to a few students.
ASSU contributions of $74,407 will
enable 100 new students to go on out
door trips beginning September 1993
and September 1994. An additional 100
students each year would have the
opportunity to go on a public service

trip.
For the two-year pilot program
involving a total of 400 participating stu
dents, who pay an additional $86 each,
the total cost is $108,807. That's
$272.02 per student.
Remember that half of the 400 students
are doing public service. Does it really cost
$272.02 per student to do public service?
So why is the cost so hi'-n? Well, the
initial capital investment of $13,687
doesn't seem unreasonable, although we
are not sure why they need a $2,200 Mac
intosh computer to organize outdoor trips.
Maybe the $54,020 in salaries divided
among four students has something to
do with it. Those students would be on
the payroll for an entire year (October
1992 - September 1993) before the first
trip is scheduled to take place.
Does it really take an entire year to
plan a camping trip for 100 people?
If we want an outdoor trips program for
incoming students, we can do it without

creating four more high paying positions
in an ASSU with already bloated salaries
