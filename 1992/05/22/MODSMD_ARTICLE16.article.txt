# Buckley misquoted in fliers from Queerland
## 
### 
Queerland has sunk to an all-time low
of intellectual dishonesty in its protest of
the May 19 William F. Buckley Jr. speech.
Before the speech, members of the group
distributed flyers entitled "Where does
Buckley stand?" to the audience members.
Queerland prominently quoted Buck
ley as saying, " 'If we are to understand
the grimy question, it comes down to
this: Blacks produce a much heavier per
centage of welfare clients, of unem-

ployed, and of criminals, than whites.
Therefore, any measure that has the
effect of reducing the incidence of rela
tive black population is to be welcomed.'
(National Review, Dec. 30, 1988, p. 62)."
We read the National Review article
in question (and we encourage you to do
the same). In the full context of the arti
cle, Buckley is actually paraphrasing
another person's argument in favor of
abortion. Indeed, Buckley goes on to
refute this argument, not stand for it!
However, Buckley's views, no matter
what we think of them, are not the fun
damental issue. The issue is the willful
destruction of facts in order to achieve
Queerland's politically correct ends. As
long as groups are able to misrepresent
facts in this way, there can be no ratio
nal debate.
