Doubts about sincerity
of environmental efforts
George Bush's announcement that he
will attend the earth summit is yet another
example of politicians jumping on the envi
ronmentalist bandwagon, ignoring both
scientific evidence and individual rights.
The environmentalist movement has a
long record of ignoring rational standards
of evidence. On the flimsiest evidence,
and in some cases with no evidence at all,
environmentalists have promoted dooms
day stories about global warming, a new
ice age and ozone depletion.

They have used such stories to pro
mote environmental legislation encroach
ing on everyone's freedom and hurting
everyone's standard of living. The earth
summit will probably lead to even worse
such legislation all over the globe.
Those who are motivated by legiti
mate environmental concerns should
realize that the free market and private
property rights are the only true protec
tors of the environment.
A private owner has a strong incentive
to maintain his property in good condition,
since his ability to use it in the future
depends on such maintenance; a user of
"public property" has no such incentive.
Government regulation is not a solu

tion to environmental problems; as the
environmental record of Eastern Europe
shows, government regulation creates
the problem.
Several past letters in the Daily men
tioned Ayn Rand's view of environmen
talism. Unfortunately, the letter pur
porting to represent Rand's view demon
strated little understanding of her ideas.
It implied that Rand regarded all envi
ronmentalists as haters of human life.
But the exact opposite is true. Rand
regarded environmentalism as one of the
most pernicious contemporary move
ments, precisely because most people
calling themselves environmentalists are
motivated by legitimate concerns for

preserving clean air, water and scenic
wilderness areas as a means of further
ing human life and enjoyment.
The danger of environmentalism is
that it distorts these legitimate con
cerns, using them to dupe people into
supporting a movement whose leaders
have entirely different motives.
Legitimate environmental concerns
can only be solved by accepting a philos
ophy, like Ayn Rand's, that makes it
possible to address these concerns ratio
nally.
