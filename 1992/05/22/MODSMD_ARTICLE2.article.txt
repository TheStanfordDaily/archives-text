# No center site, but coalition continues

### June Fang Staff writer 
Despite a delay in its plans for
a new community center in East
Palo Alto, the Stanford Commu
nity Action Coalition will still be
continuing its project to help with
neighborhood development.
The coalition, a group of stu
dents created in response to the
verdict in Rodney King beating
case, is organizing a clean-up of
the EPA Youth Development
Center this weekend.
The group had originally hoped
to use part of the closed

Ravenswood high school facilities
as a center for its community pro
jects. However, according to EPA
council member Nevida Butler, the
site is scheduled to be torn down.
Butler said there are potential
health hazards in using the build
ing. "There's a good possibility
that asbestos may be present,"
she added.
Coalition member Tracy Clay,
a junior, said there was a need to
create a centralized location in
EPA where people could come
together. The plans for the pro
posed community center include a
community library, classes and

possible sports facilities, she said.
Junior Erika Zavaleta, one of
the group's organizers, said the
coalition is currently looking for
other sites and hopes to find a per
manent one by fall. "I'm optimistic
that we are going to be able to find
another site, though," she said.
She added that the high school
would have been an ideal location
because its facilities include a
library and classrooms which
could have housed the coalition's
collected books and provide space
for future classes.
Freshman coalition member
Priya Haji said the group's goals

did not depend on the specific site,
adding that members will contin
ue creating plans for the center.
"The objective is to be con
structive and inclusive. It was not
designed to be exclusionary or
paternalistic in its methods or ide
als," she added. "It's . . . reclaim
ing our community, our history
and our future," Haji said.
Zavaleta said that the group
has "joined up with grass roots
organizations in EPA," in an
effort to improve relations with
the community.
