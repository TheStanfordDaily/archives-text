## Batters top Hatters in 12-inning contest 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
It looks like nothing is going to come
easy for the Stanford baseball team in the
postseason.
Behind some incredible defense and
some even more incredible pitching, the
Cardinal overcame the surprisingly pesky
Stetson Hatters by a score of 2-1 in a 12-
inning marathon. But it wasn't without a
little patience and a lot of effort.
The game featured some clutch perfor
mances on several counts. Willie Adams
delivered his regularly excellent outing.
Todd Laßocca provided some unbelievable
play at shortstop. Steve Worrell came
through with excellent relief pitching. And
Steve Solomon once again provided the
offensive punch needed.
On a hit and run with one out in the bot
tom of the 12th, Solomon hit a 2-2 pitch for
a single off reliever Javier Gomez to drive in
Jeffrey Hammonds from second, breaking
the six-inning-old 1-1 tie. It was Solomon's
second RBI of the game, accounting for all
of Stanford's runs.
The beginning of the game was quite
proper — that being an Adams strikeout.
The game was a pitching battle from start
to end. Stetson's Larry Hingle and Stan
ford's Adams, both invitees to the Olympic
team trials, turned in excellent perfor
mances. In his seven and two-thirds

innings of work, Hingle pitched to only
seven batters over the minimum, and in his
eight and two-thirds innings, Adams only to
six.
And the amazing thing is that Adams
didn't even have his best stuff. As some
times happens, the sophomore right-han
der's curveball didn't have its normally
sweeping break, but fortunately, his fast
ball looked good.
"Willie cannot pitch his best and still be
in the game," Esquer said. "He was really
able to place his fastball today, especially
high in the zone to get some swing
throughs and pop-ups."
The Hatter and Cardinal replacements
were equally effective. Gomez relieved Hin
gle in the eighth and struck out three of the
first five batters he faced. In the bottom of
the tenth, Stanford threatened when it
loaded the bases with one out, but Gomez
induced pop-ups from Mark Skeels and
Dusty Allen.
"We didn't execute," Esquer said. "We'd
get guys on base, but then we couldn't score
them."
On the Stanford side, Worrell was even
better. The left-handed junior relieved
Adams with two on and two out in the
ninth, and provided three and a third
innings of nearly perfect relief. After allow
ing an infield hit to the first batter he faced,

Steve Worrell, coming on strong in recent weeks, pitched the final 3-1/3 scoreless innings yesterday to pick up the vic
tory as Stanford downed Stetson in NCAA regional play.
But Worrell couldn't have done
what he did without the defense
provided by shortstop Laßocca. In
crucial situations, Laßocca came
up with incredible plays. With
runners on first and second, the
freshman saved at least one run
by diving for a sharp grounder
and keeping it in the infield. In
successive innings, Laßocca
showed off his superior range and
arm in highlight-film plays.
"Laßocca is a guy who, whether
he's playing in the first game of
[the NCAA play-offs] or a game in
the sand lot, he's gonna give it his
all," Esquer said. "His range is so
good, he gets to balls many guys
wouldn't make a play on, and his
arm is so good he makes close
plays where most shortstops
wouldn't have a shot."
The Hatters were the first to
strike when they plated a run in the
third. Chris Thomas led off the
inning trotting down to first after
getting hit by Adams. After Chris
Hannum sacrificed Thomas to sec
ond, David Ferreira hit a two-out
single off the right field wall to

drive in the run. However, that
would be Stetson's only run.
Stanford tied things up in the
sixth when, with two out, Cornell
singled to right, advanced to second
on a Hingle wild pitch, and scored
on Solomon's RBI single to right.
The Cardinal will play its sec
ond game of the regional today
against the third-seeded Georgia
Bulldogs, who lost yesterday to
the Kent State Golden Flashes.
