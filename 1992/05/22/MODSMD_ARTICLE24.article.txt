### Brian Border Staff writer 
The Stanford women's soccer team
can breathe a sigh of relief after receiving
a bit of good news yesterday.
Head soccer coach Berhane Andeber
han chose to remain on the Farm for
another year and decline the opportunity
to become the men's coach at Harvard
University.
"Andeberhan informed me that he has
decided to stay at Stanford, and we
couldn't be more pleased," said associate
athletic director Cheryl Levick.
His team also expressed joy after
learning about Ins decision.

According to junior Jen Potok, "We
were all prepared to support him if he
left, but we are happy he stayed."
While many of his players were
stunned by the possibility of their
coach's departure, athletic director Ted
Leland did not seem surprised by the sit
uation.
"When you have a quality coaching
staff like we have, other people are going
to be interested in him," he said. "It
comes with being a successful coach."
Andeberhan's announcement marks
the end of a period of several weeks spent
exploring other options in the soccer
world. ,
"Coaching a minor sport is not the

most secure business," Andeberhan said.
"I was just trying to project into the
future and look at all the possibilities."
Although the coach cited a number of
personal and professional factors in
reaching his decision, a pledge for
increased support from the athletic
department proved to be a major swaying
point.
Along with an enhanced budget, the
department has promised to give out
more scholarships to the soccer pro
gram.
"With the deteriorating economy, a lot
of players have been reluctant to come to
Stanford when there have been better
opportunities for financial support at

other schools," he said.
"But as long as we have this kind of
commitment from the athletic depart
ment, and as long as I feel secure in my
job, I'll stay here indefinitely."
Now that Andeberhan has settled his
future, he will be able to refocus his con
centration on the upcoming soccer sea
son.
After achieving an impressive record
of 17 wins and two losses last year, the
team is progressing towards their goal of
winning a national championship.
"Once I made the decision, there's no
looking back," he said.
"We have to go right back to practicing
hard again."
