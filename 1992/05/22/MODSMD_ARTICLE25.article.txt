# Card netters advance in NCAA competition
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
The dream-like winning
streak of the men's tennis team
finally took a little dive yesterday
as one singles player and one dou
bles team were eliminated from
the NCAA individual competition
in Athens, Ga. All was not lost
however, as one singles player
and the other two doubles teams
did advance to the round of 16.
Michael Flanagan fell to Geor
gia's No. 1 player, Wade
McGuire, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3. Flanagan
had set point in the first set and
had breaks at 2-1 and 3-2 in the
second set but could not pull out
a win.
In doubles, Flanagan and part
ner Rob Devens "got outclassed
by a very good team," according
to head coach Dick Gould. "We
were never really into that
match." The Stanford sopho
mores lost, 6-2, 6-2, to Louisiana
State's top team of Tamer El
Sawy and Mario Pacheco.
On the positive side, Alex
O'Brien crushed Drake's Donny
Isaak, 6-3, 6-4. In the past, Isaak
has often dragged O'Brien to
three sets. "Today went great,"
O'Brien said. "The match was a
lot closer than it sounds." Both
players broke serve several times
but it was O'Brien who came out
on top.
"He's a grinder, he just grinds
out every point," said the senior
three-time Ail-American. "Some
times I was pushing the ball
instead of hitting it. I just played
a little bit better than he did."
In doubles action, O'Brien and
partner Chris Cocotos advanced,
as did Jason Yee and Vimal Patel.
O'Brien and Cocotos shot down
the Jayhawks' Carlos Fleming
;m<l Paul Garvin, 6-1, 6-7 (2-7), 6-
1. The Kansas pair only had a
chance when O'Brien and Coco
tos relaxed in the second set.
"They were cruisin' along and
got lazy and it cost them the sec
ond set," Gould said.
O'Brien took most of the cred
it for this minor diversion. "Chris
played pretty well," he said. Up 4-
2 in the second, O'Brien lost
serve twice and then was broken
in the first game of the third set.
However, the Cardinal pair came
back to win six straight. "We
came back when it counted and

that's what is important,"
O'Brien said.
Yee and Patel closed in for the
win much more quickly, dropping
only four games to Mississippi
State's Daniel Courcol and Lau
rent Miquelard.
"[Courcol and Miquelard 1 are
two good singles players but they
don't have much concept of dou
bles," Gould said.
Despite battling a nagging
virus all week, Yee hung in the
match and helped Patel put the
Bulldogs away, 6-2, 6-2.
Today, the pair should have a
much tougher time as they face
the tournament's top seeded pair,
Brian MacPhie and Jon Leach of
USC. This could be Yee's last
match of his Stanford career so
he undoubtedly will not give up
easily.
"This will be a tough match,"
Patel said. "We'll see what hap
pens. We really, really want to
win this bad."
Also this afternoon, second
seeded Cocotos and O'Brien will
face a pair from either Oklahoma
or Arkansas.
This morning, in singles
action, O'Brien will take on Bay
Area rival, Matt Lucena of Cali
fornia. The pair are 1-1 in con
tests this season. In their last
meeting — which was the Cardi
nal's last dual match of the sea
son — Lucena won on his home
turf, 6-1, 6-4.
"I'm looking forward to a little
revenge," O'Brien said. "Last
time he was on his home courts
but these are like my home
courts. He's been on a roll and
I'm a little tired, so I'll just have
to go out and make him hit balls."
