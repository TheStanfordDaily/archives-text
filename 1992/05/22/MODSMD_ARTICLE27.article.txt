# Stanford sports guru predicts hazy future
## 
### 
Prophecy: Blazers over the
Bulls in seven.
Philosophy: After MVP
Michael takes the Bulls to a 3-2
lead, Mr. Quayle will remind him
that his non-nuclear family
lifestyle is a symptom of deterio
rating American mores. Air Jor
dan, persuaded that the Bulls
winning another NBA title would
propagandize a "valueless" way
of life, will convince his team
mates to tank games six and
seven.
Prophecy: Loma Prieta II
will rock the Farm this October,
causing more extensive, costly
damage. Yet an elated President
Casper will find legitimization
for his yearning to hike tuition
costs and throw a party on the
Hoover lawn.
Philosophy: Coincidentally,
the A's will sweep the Giants in
the '92 World Series.
Prophecy: The Sacramento
Kings will make Cardinal great
Adam Keefe their first round
draft choice.
Philosophy: Unfortunately,
the Kings need a wide body to
bang around on the low blocks,
and Keefe could be the latest
promising rookie to fall into the
NBA's Bermuda Triangle. So get
a good look at our hero when his
picture flashes up on the draft
day screen . . . you may never see
him again.
Prophecy: The New York
Giants' decision to submit to
AIDS tests as a team will soon
become standard practice in pro
fessional sports.
Philosophy: With hope, this
— the sports world's first, tangi
ble response to the Magic John
son and Arthur Ashe revelations
— will not be the last.
Prophecy: The Big Three
shoe companies will soon refuse
to allow their athlete clients to
become affiliated with any par
ticular country, in fear of alien
ating overseas consumers. As a
result, the 1996 Atlanta
Olympiad will be canceled in
favor of the separate Nike Festi
val, Reebok Games and Converse
Invitational.
Philosophy: Yes, the compe
tition will be a bit lacking, but
the quality of commercials will
never be higher. And while we
may miss out on the flag waving,

remember Atlanta didn't have
Mars Blackmon, Sinbad and
Larry Johnson's Grandmama
lined up as emcees.
Prophecy: Shaquille O'Neal
will sign with the Orlando Magic
within days.
Philosophy: Move over
Mickey. After first insisting that
he wanted to play in Los Angeles,
O'Neal will decide that Central
Florida will suit his endorsement

needs just fine. The Disney folk
are drooling. Tomorrowland is
ancient history. Say hello to
Shaq Land, graced by the Snack
Shaq, the Shaq Mountain roller
coaster, the Smack Shaq bumper
cars and toy stores with Disney's
latest novelty: Shaq in the Box.
Prophecy: The Cardinal
hardballers will storm through
the Tallahassee regional to the
College World Series, and then
bring home their third national
title in six years.
Philosophy: After a record
sixth NCAA Championship ban
ner makes its way to the Farm,
Sports Illustrated & Co. will real
ize there's more to Stanford ath
letics than Bill Walsh and
Tommy Vardell.
The national (and local) media
will recognize the architect of the
program — the man who not only
was behind the six titles, but also
landed coach Walsh, hung on to
Mike Montgomery, kept boosters
interested when "Stanford" and
"scandal" nearly became synony
mous, and moved student seats
back to the 50 yard-line — and
hail Ted Leland as one of the
finest athletic directors in the
country. (And we don't even need
two motorhomes and a mansion
in the Mother Lode to keep him
here.)

Kevin Jeffery sometimes wishes it
was apropos for sports colum
nists to whine about their sex life,
too.
