# Track winds down season in Pac-10 Championships
## 
### Nick Clements Staff writer 
For Stanford track and field staff and athletes
alike, Eugene, Ore., is the end of the road this year.
The Cardinal will make their trip northward to
compete in their last team meet of the season, the
Pacific 10 Conference Championships. Stanford
head track and field coach Brooks Johnson, who
recently announced that he will be resigning but has
not yet cited his reasons for leaving Stanford, will
most likely be coaching in his last Pac-10 meet. And
for many Stanford athletes, the meet will most like
ly be their last chance to qualify for the NCAA
Championships in June.
As a team, the Cardinal has had a somewhat
rocky road this spring. Short on athletic scholar
ships, Johnson has had to regroup and focus instead
on individual performances.
The move worked in mid-March, when Stanford
only sent two athletes to the women's NCAA Indoor
Championships in Indianapolis, Chryste Gaines and
Jackie Edwards. Gaines won the 55-meter dash,
while Edwards won the long jump and took third in
the triple jump. Their individual marks were so far
and above everyone else's that they gave the women
a second place finish in the end, beating out other
teams who sent up to 12 athletes to the meet.
Gaines and Edwards find themselves in the spot
light again as they lead the Cardinal into battle for
one last time.
"Chryste and Jackie will be the headliners," said
Assistant Head Coach Scott Chisam, who added that
Gaines and Edwards probably won't be able to sin
gle-handedly capture this meet the way they did in
mid-March due to the scoring process.
Gaines, who recently ran the second fastest time
in the 100-meter dash in the world for this year, will
be competing against another top NCAA sprinter,
USC's Inger Miller. The two finished in a dead heat
down in Los Angeles at the beginning of the season,
but Gaines came back to easily defeat Miller at the
Stanford Invite in late March.
"I know all the USC people think [Miller] is going
to blow Chryste away," Chisam said. Right now,
Miller's best time in the 100-meter dash is 11.14 sec
onds, which she ran recently at the Modesto Relays.
Gaines' world-class time, which she ran at the Texas
Relays, was a wind-aided 10.90 seconds.

Edwards, who is one of the top favorites in the
long and triple jumps, will also be running in the
4XIOO-meter relay with Ali Callicoatte, Rhonda
Oliver, and Gaines. The relay team has qualified
provisionally, but still needs an automatic berth for
the NCAA Championships. If needed, Gaines and
Edwards will also run in the mile relay.
Hammer thrower Dave Popejoy, who recently
broke out of a rut in a big way at Modesto with a
throw of 209 feet, three inches (two inches away
from qualifying for the Olympic Trials), is the
top-ranked hammer thrower in the Pac-10 right
now.
Popejoy and Toby Norwood, whose throw of 190
feet at Modesto established him as a dangerous com
petitor in the Pac-10, constitute the Cardinal's best
throwing core. Pat Stowell and Matt Karsevar, who
both throw the discus, also figure to score in the top
10 this weekend.
Fred Carter in the 3,000-meter steeplechase,
Gary Stolz in the 5,000- and 10,000-meters, Dave
Scudamore in the 10,000-meters and Alex Accetta in
the 800 and 1,500-meters constitute the men's other
strength, middle distance. Scudamore has qualified
provisionally for the NCAA Championships, while
Carter and Stolz have outstanding chances of quali
fying for NCAAs if their races are as fast as expect
ed.
"It's really kind of a thrower's-distance runner's
meet on the men's side, along with freshman sensa
tion Travis Clark," Chisam said. Clark, a high
jumper who has cleared seven feet, has come on
strong at the end of the season and will probably
score in the top five.
On the women's side, Susan Helfter in the 800-
meters, Andrea Garner in the 10,000-meters and
Melissa Freeberg in the 1,500-meters constitute the
Cardinal's distance core. Debbie Templeton in the
discus and javelin and Dana Weeks and Anne Lee in
the triple-jump also figure to place.
Although teams are allowed one athlete per
event, the Cardinal will only be sending those ath
letes who have achieved Pac-10 qualifying stan
dards. Chisam said that Stanford's decision not to
send every possible athlete is mostly economic.
"We don't feel it's a wise expenditure of Stanford
money to take along athletes just for experience,"
Chisam said. "That's been a Stanford policy for
years."

"I know all the USC people think [Miller] is going
to blow Chryste away," Chisam said. Right now,
Miller's best time in the 100-meter dash is 11.14 sec
onds, which she ran recently at the Modesto Relays.
Gaines' world-class time, which she ran at the Texas
Relays, was a wind-aided 10.90 seconds.

Edwards, who is one of the top favorites in the
long and triple jumps, will also be running in the
4XIOO-meter relay with Ali Callicoatte, Rhonda
Oliver, and Gaines. The relay team has qualified
provisionally, but still needs an automatic berth for
the NCAA Championships. If needed, Gaines and
Edwards will also run in the mile relay.
Hammer thrower Dave Popejoy, who recently
broke out of a rut in a big way at Modesto with a
throw of 209 feet, three inches (two inches away
from qualifying for the Olympic Trials), is the
top-ranked hammer thrower in the Pac-10 right
now.
Popejoy and Toby Norwood, whose throw of 190
feet at Modesto established him as a dangerous com
petitor in the Pac-10, constitute the Cardinal's best
throwing core. Pat Stowell and Matt Karsevar, who
both throw the discus, also figure to score in the top
10 this weekend.
Fred Carter in the 3,000-meter steeplechase,
Gary Stolz in the 5,000- and 10,000-meters, Dave
Scudamore in the 10,000-meters and Alex Accetta in
the 800 and 1,500-meters constitute the men's other
strength, middle distance. Scudamore has qualified
provisionally for the NCAA Championships, while
Carter and Stolz have outstanding chances of quali
fying for NCAAs if their races are as fast as expect
ed.
"It's really kind of a thrower's-distance runner's
meet on the men's side, along with freshman sensa
tion Travis Clark," Chisam said. Clark, a high
jumper who has cleared seven feet, has come on
strong at the end of the season and will probably
score in the top five.
On the women's side, Susan Helfter in the 800-
meters, Andrea Garner in the 10,000-meters and
Melissa Freeberg in the 1,500-meters constitute the
Cardinal's distance core. Debbie Templeton in the
discus and javelin and Dana Weeks and Anne Lee in
the triple-jump also figure to place.
Although teams are allowed one athlete per
event, the Cardinal will only be sending those ath
letes who have achieved Pac-10 qualifying stan
dards. Chisam said that Stanford's decision not to
send every possible athlete is mostly economic.
"We don't feel it's a wise expenditure of Stanford
money to take along athletes just for experience,"
Chisam said. "That's been a Stanford policy for
years."

Fred Carter strains while finishing up another steeplechase event. Carter and the rest of the Stanford
track and field squad will head to Eugene, Ore., this weekend for the Pac-10 Championships.
For Stanford track and field staff and athletes
alike, Eugene, Ore., is the end of the road this year.
The Cardinal will make their trip northward to
compete in their last team meet of the season, the
Pacific 10 Conference Championships. Stanford
head track and field coach Brooks Johnson, who
recently announced that he will be resigning but has
not yet cited his reasons for leaving Stanford, will
most likely be coaching in his last Pac-10 meet. And
for many Stanford athletes, the meet will most like
ly be their last chance to qualify for the NCAA
Championships in June.
As a team, the Cardinal has had a somewhat
rocky road this spring. Short on athletic scholar
ships, Johnson has had to regroup and focus instead
on individual performances.
The move worked in mid-March, when Stanford
only sent two athletes to the women's NCAA Indoor
Championships in Indianapolis, Chryste Gaines and
Jackie Edwards. Gaines won the 55-meter dash,
while Edwards won the long jump and took third in
the triple jump. Their individual marks were so far
and above everyone else's that they gave the women
a second place finish in the end, beating out other
teams who sent up to 12 athletes to the meet.
Gaines and Edwards find themselves in the spot
light again as they lead the Cardinal into battle for
one last time.
"Chryste and Jackie will be the headliners," said
Assistant Head Coach Scott Chisam, who added that
Gaines and Edwards probably won't be able to sin
gle-handedly capture this meet the way they did in
mid-March due to the scoring process.
Gaines, who recently ran the second fastest time
in the 100-meter dash in the world for this year, will
be competing against another top NCAA sprinter,
USC's Inger Miller. The two finished in a dead heat
down in Los Angeles at the beginning of the season,
but Gaines came back to easily defeat Miller at the
Stanford Invite in late March.
"I know all the USC people think [Miller] is going
to blow Chryste away," Chisam said. Right now,
Miller's best time in the 100-meter dash is 11.14 sec
