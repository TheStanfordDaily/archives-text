# Perot's popularity pondered by profs

### Karen Jordan 
The popularity of billionaire
presidential candidate Ross Perot
reflected in an L.A. Times poll
yesterday stems from voter disil
lusionment with the political pro
cess, Stanford professors say.
Californians favor Perot over
President Bush and Arkansas
Governor Bill Clinton in a project
ed November election, according
to the report, based on a telephone
poll of more than 1,000 voters.
The Times listed Perot leading
in California with 39 percent of
the vote, over 26 percent for Bill
Clinton and 25 percent for Presi
dent George Bush.
Some political science profes
sors attributed Perot's success to
dissatisfaction with the current
candidates. Political Science Prof.
Richard Fagen said that Perot's
popularity stems from the public's
dissatisfaction with candidates
who ignore important issues.
"I think that Perot seems to be
striking a responsive chord, not

just in people who are sick and
tired of political incumbents, but
in people who are sick and tired of
the lack of attention to serious
questions we face," said Fagen.
"We not only have a disaffection
with President Bush and Bill Clin
ton, we also have the expectation
that someone else will be better,
based on [the public's] ignorance of
his stance [on issues]," he added.
This agreed with the Times
poll, which reported that most
voters like Perot because he rep
resents change.
However, Political Science Prof.
Terry Moe attributed Perot's pop
ularity to the general public's igno
rance of the candidate.
"The fact is that most people
don't know anything about him,"
he said. "The real question is
whether he can hang on to that
popularity once people have an
accurate picture of who he is and
what he stands for."
