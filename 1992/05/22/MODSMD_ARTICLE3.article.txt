# Perot's popularity pondered by profs
## 
### Karen Jordan 
The popularity of billionaire
presidential candidate Ross Perot
reflected in an L.A. Times poll
yesterday stems from voter disil
lusionment with the political pro
cess, Stanford professors say.
Californians favor Perot over
President Bush and Arkansas
Governor Bill Clinton in a project
ed November election, according
to the report, based on a telephone
poll of more than 1,000 voters.
The Times listed Perot leading
in California with 39 percent of
the vote, over 26 percent for Bill
Clinton and 25 percent for Presi
dent George Bush.
Some political science profes
sors attributed Perot's success to
dissatisfaction with the current
candidates. Political Science Prof.
Richard Fagen said that Perot's
popularity stems from the public's
dissatisfaction with candidates
who ignore important issues.
"I think that Perot seems to be
striking a responsive chord, not

just in people who are sick and
tired of political incumbents, but
in people who are sick and tired of
the lack of attention to serious
questions we face," said Fagen.
"We not only have a disaffection
with President Bush and Bill Clin
ton, we also have the expectation
that someone else will be better,
based on [the public's] ignorance of
his stance [on issues]," he added.
This agreed with the Times
poll, which reported that most
voters like Perot because he rep
resents change.
However, Political Science Prof.
Terry Moe attributed Perot's pop
ularity to the general public's igno
rance of the candidate.
"The fact is that most people
don't know anything about him,"
he said. "The real question is
whether he can hang on to that
popularity once people have an
accurate picture of who he is and
what he stands for."
Political Science Prof. Susan
Okin agreed, adding that "no one
knows what he thinks yet about
anything much."

But most voters do not realize
the implications of electing an
unknown, independent candidate
like Perot, said Political Science
Prof. David Abernethy.
"I think that Perot would be the
weakest of the three in terms of his
ability to gain support from the
House," said Abernethy. "Perot
would be the only case where there
would be no incentive for either
Ibranch of Congress! to support

him," he said.
However, Hoover senior fellow
and Political Science chair John Fer
ejohn said Perot has received an
"unprecedented level of support" for
an independent candidate.
His independent popularity may
stem from the fact that Perot is an
"anti-media candidate," said Fagen.
"He's refusing to play the media's
game, and I think that people are
attracted to him for that reason."
Fagen said Perot's refusal to
participate in the controversy over
Vice President Dan Quayle's criti
cism of television's single mother,
Murphy Brown, has also helped
Perot's image.
"I think people are finding
[that) attractive and refreshing,"
he said.
Although Perot has not received
as much negative media attention
as the other candidates, several
professors said they don't believe
his newness will put Perot in office.
"I think that he has extremely
little chance of winning in Novem
ber, but I could be wrong," Okin
said.
