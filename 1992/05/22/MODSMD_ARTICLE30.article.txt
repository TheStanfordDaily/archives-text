# Crew seeks Cal blood

### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
The Stanford men's and
women's crew teams wrap up the
1992 regular season at Sacramen
to this Saturday in the Pacific
Coast Rowing Championships.
The varsity men are seeded
fourth, behind UCLA, Washing
ton, and California. The women
are third-seeded, behind Washing
ton and California.
"I really think we're ready,"
said senior women's crew member
Lise Schickel. "This has been a
fantastic season for us. We really
have surprised ourselves."
The women come to the end of
what has been a successful sea
son, highlighted by a win at home
against UC-Davis, taking the
third-best time in the Potomac
Championships, and now possess
ing the third seed in the Pacific
Coast Championships.
The men will be helped this Sat
urday by the return of team mem
ber Zander Packard, previously
sidelined with a leg injury which
forced him to miss action most of
this season. The team has also

brought up Rob Taylor from the
junior varsity stroke position to
man the number four seat in the
varsity boat. They will attempt to
bring home the league title Satur
day, but most members of the
men's and women's teams have a
second goal: to avenge the dual
meet loss to California in the Big
Row two weeks ago.
"Oh my God, there are no
words for it," Schickel said. "We
want to kill Cal."
Steve Voorhis, senior men's
crew member, shares the senti
ment: "Yeah, we'd really, really
like to beat Cal."
According to Voorhis, the
men's team has an extra motiva
tion in the drive to best California
this weekend.
"They [Cal] were real
unsportsmanlike at Big Row, so
there will be some talking going
on if we're rowing side by side,"
Voorhis said.
"We're going to go all-out in
this race," Voorhis said. "For the
seniors, it's our last race, so we go
out there ready to pull like we've
never pulled before. It should be a
race to remember."
