Three held hostage in San Bernadino
SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) - Two gunmen held a
woman and two little girls hostage yesterday but freed three
other youngsters after 13 hours, authorities said.
"We don't know why they let them go," police spokeswoman
Lynn Leßoy said. "The children are fine."
The freed children, all girls, were ages 1, 2 and 12, Leßoy said. A
21-year-old woman and girls ages 2 and 4 remained captive Thursday
afternoon in the house, across the street from an elementary school.
The gunmen had robbed the residents of one home, tied them
up, then fled with a 12-year-old girl into the home where the
standoff began shortly after dawn.
Dinasour bone found in Colorado
DENVER (AP) — An amateur paleontologist discouraged
because he couldn't find a job was walking his dog with his head
down when he discovered a rare bone from a Tyrannosauraus rex.
"Paleontologists look for years and don't find anything," said
Charles Fickle.
Kenneth Carpenter, a paleontologist with the Denver Museum
of Natural History, said the 20-pound shin bone was a rare find
because it provided proof that Tyrannosauraus rex roamed as far
south as Colorado.
Fickle, 30, calls himself an amateur paleontologist.
