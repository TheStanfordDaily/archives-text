# Baraka addresses Malcolm X legacy
## King verdict, riots a call to increased activism 'Struggle is nothing new to us — nor is victory' 
### Cheo H. Coker Staff writer 
In the wake of the Los Angeles
riots sparked by the verdict in the
Rodney King trial, noted activist
and author Amiri Baraka spoke
last night at Cubberley Auditori
um as the keynote speaker for the
Black Student Union's Malcolm X
week.
Speaking to an audience of
about 50 students, Baraka called
the L.A. rioters "freedom fight
ers," while calling for the death of
racism and self-empowerment for
African-Americans.

'Anyone who is
happy with the
status quo is
either a fool or a
racist.'
— Amiri Baraka

He alluded to the myth of the
"phoenix rising from the ashes,"
in reference to the several politi
cal movements spurred by the
riots.
"And so it is that vicious cruel
ty of U.S. imperialism has bat
tered us into semi-consciousness
again, and the black bird begins to
rise," he said.
Blacks were not the only ones
to participate in the rioting, he
added, saying that Chicanos,
Asian-Americans and impover
ished whites also rioted after the
decision. "Anyone who is happy
with the status quo is either a fool
or a racist," he said.
Baraka noted that there is an
important need to maintain the
atmosphere spurred by the riots
because it encourages nationwide
activism.
"We must seize the time, and
use this new aggressive stance in
the mass democratic revolution
ary movement to call once again
for self-determination for the
Afro-American nation," he said.

"We [as black people] have
never been able to express our
will, our humanity, our opinion in
this slave constructed society," he
said. "America has never been a
democracy — to say it has been is
an insult to all people of color,
women, and poor immigrants."
Baraka said the King verdict
only solidified his belief that there
is a third-class citizenship for
America's disenfranchised.
"The [riots] are proof that we
are an oppressed nation" he said.
"We are not, nor have ever been,
treated as U.S. citizens with all of
the rights guaranteed by the Con
stitution."
He called the verdict a restate
ment of the 1857 Dred Scott deci
sion, in which Supreme Court
Justice Roger B. Taney stated
that blacks possessed "no rights
any white person is bound to
respect."
The four policemen "were
demonstrating the relation of the
U.S. state to its Afro-American
people on television — that's
what you call educational TV,"
Baraka said, drawing supportive
laughter from the crowd.
Baraka said his solution to the
problem is similar to the solution
Malcolm X suggested prior to his
assassination. Malcolm X wanted
to present the United Nations
with a human rights referendum,
condemning the United States for
violating the human rights of its
people of color, he said.
Baraka also called for a "trans
formation of the U.S. Constitu
tion into an instrument of the rev
olutionary people's democracy."
"Struggle is not new to us, nor is
victory. [Black people] are the old
est humans on the planet," he said.
For the second half of the pro
gram, Baraka presented the audi
ence with an "activist's commit
ment" — guidelines for political
activism in the post Malcolm X /
Martin Luther King era.
Baraka called for the abolish
ment of racist icons, the account
ability of the media for racist state
ments, anti-racism laws on a local
and national level, and citizen-con
trolled police review boards.
As long as people tolerate racism,
it will continue to pose a problem in

society, he said, adding that he
urged active opposition to racism.
"No one is asking you to stran
gle anybody, throw a bomb or
break a window" he said. "Just
call someone or send a postcard
saying that you disagree."
He continued, "Like Frederick
Douglas said, find out the exact
amount of injustice any people is
willing to accept., and you find out

the exact amount of injustice they
will receive."
In his conclusion, Baraka said
he wanted students to uphold the
memory of Malcolm X, resisting
all "co-optation, commercializa
tion, and misuse of [his image].
"You must define what Mal
colm meant, uphold his memory,
live like Malcolm, and raise the
same questions," Baraka said.
