# Students support janitors' demands

### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
Student groups have become
involved in negotiations between
ACME Janitorial Services, union
members and the University to
meet janitors' demands for higher
wages and better benefits.
Senior Josie Saldana, a member
of MEChA — a Chicano/Latino stu
dent group — said that members of
the Asian American Student Asso
ciation, the Black Student Union,
the Stanford American Indian
Organization and MEChA met
with janitors in a town meeting
held at El Centro Chicano yester
day to discuss the negotiations.
For more than a month, repre
sentatives of ACME and leaders of
the Service Employees Internation
al Union have been negotiating.
They met in San Mateo last night.
According to Ellen Starbird, a
union representative and organiz
er, the mtyority of SEIU workers
hired through ACME to clean
academic and office areas on cam
pus receive low wages and no
health insurance.
The University is not investi
gating allegations of unfair pay
practices made by the union at the
moment, Operations and Mainte
nance Manager Herbert Fong
said. He added that he is only
keeping informed of the relations
between ACME and the union.

"What I am concerned about is
that your garbage cans are empty
and your trash is hauled away,"
he said.
University President Donald
Kennedy's office is talking to the
Employee Relations Office and
the Legal Office, Fong said. If the
workers decide to strike and
ACME is not able to provide the
janitorial service, there will be
"deep, intense discussions to
ensure that we do receive the ser
vices we paid for," he added.
Kennedy could not be reached
for comment.
The student groups that met
yesterday at El Centro came up
with a four-part plan to involve
themselves in behalf of the work
ers, Saldana said.
First, she said the groups
intend to publicize the economic
plight of the workers by contact
ing newspapers and circulating
petitions in White Plaza. They
then plan to contact Kennedy and
Fong by writing letters urging
them to insist on a fair wage for
the workers.
Next week the students hope
to meet with the University and
express their concern, Saldana
said. They will hold a rally as a
show of support for the workers,
she said.
"Before school is out, pressure
on the administration has to
come from the students," she
added.
Starbird agreed, adding,
"Community and student support
is critical at this point. It's your
money that they're spending."
According to Union President
Mike Garcia, ACME janitors cur
rently receive a wage between
$5.80 and $7.44 per hour. Workers
who were employed before 1986 —
about 20 percent of the janitors —
receive the higher wage and are
allowed to purchase health insur
ance from the company.
Insurance costs $258 per
month, $198 of which is paid by
ACME. The remainder of the
money must come from the jani
tors and their families.

'It's your money
that they're
spending.'

According to graduate student
Carrie Bramen, a member of Stu
dents for a Fair Contract, SELA
opened negotiations by asking
that the workers' contribution be
reduced to $20 per month and
that wages be increased across
the board by 10 percent.
Yesterday, ACME pushed a
proposal on the table that would
pay workers hired after May 30
only $5.50 per hour, Starbird
said. The company argued that
meeting the demands of the
union would damage its ability to
compete with companies that
don't hire unionized workers.
