# ASSU OKs student group fees
## 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate, meeting for the last time
Wednesday night, approved annual funding for stu
dent groups and publications amid questions about
fee recommendations made by the ASSU Appropria
tions Committee.
In a meeting that lasted until 2:00 a.m., the sen
ate allocated $70,792 in Program Board funds to 36
student groups. The senate also approved $20,435 in
Publications Board funds to 18 student publications
and $34,993 in Community Service Board funds to
17 groups.
While the community service allocations passed
without debate, the other two bills sparked some
heated exchanges, with some senators questioning
the motives of the ASSU Appropriations Committee.
Debate over the program board allocations cen
tered around charges made by undergraduate sena
tor Jason Snyder that gay, lesbian and bisexual
groups had their fee requests unfairly reduced by the
Appropriations Committee.
"There seems to be some kind of ideological cur
rents" determining the fee recommendations for the
gay, lesbian and bisexual groups, Snyder said.
But graduate senator Peter Thiel, who is chair
man of the committee, said "the average group" that
sought funding through the Program Board had its
fees lowered in committee.
Eleven out of 36 groups had their fees reduced in

committee. Four of the 11 groups that had their fees
reduced were gay, lesbian and bisexual organizations.
Graduate senator Robert Lodenkamper, a com
mittee member, said some of the groups that sought
funding were similar in nature, and therefore had
their fee requests lowered. For example, Lodenkam
per said the Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance of
Stanford and another group, BGLAS Women, over
lap and should have applied as one group for funding.
Amendments to increase funding for BGLAS failed
to get the two-thirds majority needed to pass. Snyder
then urged the senate to "vote no" on the funding and
let the bill go to the new senate for consideration at its
meeting Tuesday, but the bill passed 13-5.
Debate on Publications Board allocations cen
tered around The Stanford Review, which had its
funding request raised by the Appropriations Com
mittee. The committee raised the Review's alloca
tion from the Pub Board's suggestion of no money,
proposing to give the Review $1,000 in summer dis
cretionary funds and $3,600 annual funding.
Thiel, who founded the Review, said the commit
tee raised the Review's fee request because the fee
had been unfairly lowered by the Pub Board. The
board "has consistently had an ideological agenda to
defund the Stanford Review," Thiel said, adding that
his committee had simply tried to eliminate that bias
by increasing the Review's fee.
Graduate senator Larry Augustin also said he
thought the Pub Board was biased against the
Review. However, Augustin object
ed to the Appropriations Commit
tee's changes to the bill, saying the
committee's move was even more
biased than that of the Pub Board.
Of the 17 groups that applied
for annual funding, the Review
was the only organization that

had its Program Board recom
mendation raised.
The Pub Board bill failed an
initial vote, but was reintroduced
by undergraduate senator Ron
Brown. Graduate senator James
Vera then amended the bill, giv
ing the Review a total of $4,000 —
$3,000 of it annual funding —
and reinstating the original Pub
Board recommendations for all
other groups. The amended bill
passed 11-5.
