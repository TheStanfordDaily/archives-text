## Ron Brown will seek to improve communication and efficiency next year 
### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
Braving the barrage of typical
ASSU meeting activities — paper
fights, insults, body slams and
pizza deliveries — sophomore
Ronald Brown was voted,last
week, into what will be the
ASSU's most powerful position.
As next year's newly elected
ASSU Senate Chair, Brown said
he will focus on improving the
lines of communication between
senators and maximizing efficien
cy in meetings.
"I would like, first off, to
change the facilitation skills of the
ASSU. It is very important that
the senators talk to each other
outside of the meetings," he said.
"It is a given thing that certain
people will have certain [oppos
ing] ideologies. However, we need
[to] realize that the arguments
that result eat away at our pre
cious time in meetings," he said.
"We need to resolve or discuss
those things outside of the meet
ings and come . .. with a clear
head."
Brown, who is originally from
Seattle, Washington, has
immersed himself in a variety of
activities this year. He is both a
member and an officer of the
Kappa Sigma fraternity, and a
member of the junior varsity
lacrosse team and the Black Stu
dent Union.
Brown's career in student gov
ernment began before he came to
Stanford. "I was always involved
in the student government at my
school," he said. "I've always
liked the idea of students having a
positive impact on the adminis
tration.
"When I came to Stanford, I
saw the senate as a sure-fire way
of doing just that. I also talked to
many people who were involved in
the ASSU, and they really helped
to firm my decision to join,"
Brown said.
He said his desire to run for

senate chair stemmed from his
defeat in his campaign for the
Council of Presidents as a mem
ber of the "Independents: A New
Era" slate.
"Losing that race really fired
me up to do something else for the
ASSU. I think it has worked out
well," he added.
If he had a choice between the
two jobs, however, Brown said
that he would choose the COP.
"I think I would choose the
COP job because I really love
working with people," he said. "I
enjoyed the three other members
of my COP slate and I'm going to
miss working with them as a
unit."
Brown said he feels that the
position of Senate Chair has spe
cific needs that were "not particu
larly met in past years."
He said that "the chair needs
to regain some sense of fairness
and a willingness to talk to people.
Everyone has different ideas and
perspectives and we need to foster
those ideas as best we can."
One of Brown's main concerns
will be graduate student issues,
he said, adding that he hopes to
bring many of their problems and
needs to light next year.
"If I could pass any bill next
year, it would definitely have to
do with the concerns of graduate
students. I would like to bring
SUNet to Escondido Village. I
would really like some sort of tan
gible result in this area," he said.
Two of the best things Brown
has experienced during his under
graduate senate work are primari
ly connected with student projects.
Brown said he "enjoyed thor
oughly the establishment of the
Wilderness Project," an Orienta
tion camping activity for first
year students which the outgoing
senate approved Wednesday
night. "This will really give stu
dents a chance to gather together
and meet new people, even before
their Stanford career begins."
The creation and selection of

the Financial Aid Advocacy Office
was also very rewarding, he said.
"We chose wonderful people for
the job and they have really shone
through in their efforts," he said.
Brown describes himself as a
"good listener. I think that my lis
tening skills are the most out
standing part of my character.
I've heard a lot of strange things
from a lot of strange people. I
mean, living in a fraternity, work
ing for the ASSU, and helping
with the BSU, one really comes
across some different personali
ties," he said.
"I get to hear what a lot of peo
ple are thinking outside of their
normal activities. You really get a
feel for how different people view
that world. You have to make
careful observations regarding
who is right and who do you vote
with. It's very difficult."
Brown said the hardest part of
listening, however, is having to
deal with frustration.
"I hear everyday that the
ASSU doesn't do anything," he
said. "Honestly, there are prob
lems with the ASSU that need to
be fixed, and we really do need to

get back to the students, but we
are working hard now and we will
continue to work hard into the
future."
He said he hopes that one day,
when people are faced with
answering the question on the
election ballot regarding whether
the ASSU benefits students, they
will be prompted to think of
"maybe four or five" things the
ASSU has done in the past year.
Because of the election of the
"I Prefer Not to Have a COP"
slate, Brown said he feels that the
COP will not be a salary position
for a while.
"It really depends on the
changing views of the student
body, but I think that it is very
likely that the students will not
trust the COP with a salary for
quite some time," he said.
Brown said he identifies him
self most with the character of
Spiderman, since both he and Spi
derman are basically normal guys
who undergo strange and amaz
ing circumstances.
"He's basically just your aver
age Joe or PeW. Yeah, I like Spi
derman," he said.
