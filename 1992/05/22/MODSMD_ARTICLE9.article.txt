# Black law students examine values in the wake of verdict
## King aftermath evokes sense of responsibility to justice 
### Leta Hong Fincher Staff writer 
Some black law students are
re-examining their future roles as
officers in the judicial system
because of the acquittal in the
Rodney King beating case and its
aftermath.
For these students, the Rodney
King verdict was yet another
demonstration of society's fear
and harassment of black men. To
combat these pervasive stereo
types, some said they feel a greater
sense of obligation to be seen as
representatives of their race.
Teddy Adams, a first year law
student on the executive commit
tee of the Black Law Students
Association, said he sometimes
found it difficult to be in a posi
tion of such responsibility, but he
never felt "really overwhelmed."
"I feel like I've had all these
chances and all these abilities
given to me for some reason that I
feel obligated, and I'd feel I was
shirking my responsibility to
myself and to my family, and to
everyone else who's come before
me and who will come after me, if
I didn't do the best I can to try to
improve things," Adams said.
Scott Hudson, a first year law
student, said he was confronted
by a crisis when he witnessed
some of the televised rioting in
San Francisco following the Rod

ney King verdict.
"I changed my perspective so
much . . . from just watching it on
the news and being out here in
law school and in my dorm room,"
Hudson said.
A sense of isolation as a law
student in an "ivory tower" con
trasted sharply with his feelings
about "watching people's anger
just come to the surface and take
them over," he said.

'The bias is being
administered piece
meal ... like if you
went to a wall and
every day you
chipped a piece off.'

Bret Williams, co-president of
the Stanford Law Association, said
that the Rodney King verdict
reminded him that racism is even
more prevalent than he had
thought. But he said he still refuses
to "choose sides in the racial battle."
"My skin is not a problem for
me," he said. "And it's a shame
that in situations it has been made
a problem for me. I refuse to allow
it to happen again, because I am
who I am, and for me to have some

body say something to me and [for]
me to get upset and go home and
think about it is ridiculous."
Haywood Gilliam, a member of
the executive committee of the
Black Law Students Association,
said in order to move forward, the
students cannot dwell on the dis
crimination of the past.
Gilliam said that although all
of the 51 black law students have
experienced the pain of discrimi
nation, the most important thing
is not to dwell on that pain.
"I don't think any of us [black
men] can say we've never been
bugged by the police or harassed.
It's what being a black man in
American society is," he said.
"But for me, I think it's almost
self-indulgent to get bogged down
in that and convince myself in so
many ways the system is trying to
beat me down."
"I don't necessarily need the
therapy of knowing why things
have happened to me," Gilliam
said. "The why is almost unim
portant — it's like, what is the job
we're facing right now?"
Many of the students attribut
ed the verdict to racism inherent
in the judicial system.
Williams said the verdict by the
jurors in Simi Valley, where the
Rodney King trial took place, was
probably not intentionally racist
but instead the result of internal,
subconscious biases.

"You look at results and the
results show clear bias," Williams
said. "But then you go talk to people
actually administering justice, and
they never see it happening because
the bias is being administered piece
meal — day by day in little stretches
— like if you went to a wall and
every day you chipped a piece off.
"Nobody would see you break
ing down that wall. But six
months later, the wall's broken
down, and people are saying, 'who

busted the wall?' " he added.
"And that's what may be hap
pening in the legal system, this
daily chipping away at blacks, peo
ple of color, poor people, chipping
away at their rights, chipping
away at their lives," Williams said.
Williams said the racism is not
unique to the judicial system, but
is inherent in American society. He
said he routinely encountered sub
tle racial tension even at Stanford.
"You talk to your white friends

[at StanfordJ, and some of your
black friends show up. You might
feel a little uncomfortable," he said.
"Or you're talking to your white
friends. Some of their white friends
show up and all of a sudden, they
don't really know you as well."
Hudson said he thinks legal
education needs to change in
order to force future judges and
lawyers to grapple with issues of

assume positions of power.
"I think that's a huge problem
in our criminal justice system
today, that masses of African
Americans and are being
paraded in front of these courts
and they're beingjudged by judges
who have no idea what their day
to-day lives are like," he said.
Williams said he did not
believe that changing the law
school curriculum to add classes
on race would do much to combat
racism, which is caused more by
internal biases than by lack of
education.

Students Association, which he
said is organizing an "Adopt a
School" program to tutor children
at schools near Palo Alto. The
association will also lead a voter
registration drive at the begin
ning of the fall quarter, he said.
Given the vast numbers of
young black men who go to prison
instead of going to college, and
given the low self-esteem of many
black children, these law students
said they felt compelled to be visible
role models, and to be accessible to
others less fortunate than they.

feel obligated, and I'd feel I was
shirking my responsibility to
myself and to my family, and to
everyone else who's come before
me and who will come after me, if
I didn't do the best I can to try to
improve things," Adams said.
Scott Hudson, a first year law
student, said he was confronted
by a crisis when he witnessed
some of the televised rioting in
San Francisco following the Rod

ney King verdict.
"I changed my perspective so
much . . . from just watching it on
the news and being out here in
law school and in my dorm room,"
Hudson said.
A sense of isolation as a law
student in an "ivory tower" con
trasted sharply with his feelings
about "watching people's anger
just come to the surface and take
them over," he said.

Bret Williams, co-president of
the Stanford Law Association, said
that the Rodney King verdict
reminded him that racism is even
more prevalent than he had
thought. But he said he still refuses
to "choose sides in the racial battle."
"My skin is not a problem for
me," he said. "And it's a shame
that in situations it has been made
a problem for me. I refuse to allow
it to happen again, because I am
who I am, and for me to have some

body say something to me and [for]
me to get upset and go home and
think about it is ridiculous."
Haywood Gilliam, a member of
the executive committee of the
Black Law Students Association,
said in order to move forward, the
students cannot dwell on the dis
crimination of the past.
Gilliam said that although all
of the 51 black law students have
experienced the pain of discrimi
nation, the most important thing
is not to dwell on that pain.
"I don't think any of us [black
men] can say we've never been
bugged by the police or harassed.
It's what being a black man in
American society is," he said.
"But for me, I think it's almost
self-indulgent to get bogged down
in that and convince myself in so
many ways the system is trying to
beat me down."
"I don't necessarily need the
therapy of knowing why things
have happened to me," Gilliam
said. "The why is almost unim
portant — it's like, what is the job
we're facing right now?"
Many of the students attribut
ed the verdict to racism inherent
in the judicial system.
Williams said the verdict by the
jurors in Simi Valley, where the
Rodney King trial took place, was
probably not intentionally racist
but instead the result of internal,
subconscious biases.

"You look at results and the
results show clear bias," Williams
said. "But then you go talk to people
actually administering justice, and
they never see it happening because
the bias is being administered piece
meal — day by day in little stretches
— like if you went to a wall and
every day you chipped a piece off.
"Nobody would see you break
ing down that wall. But six
months later, the wall's broken
down, and people are saying, 'who

busted the wall?' " he added.
"And that's what may be hap
pening in the legal system, this
daily chipping away at blacks, peo
ple of color, poor people, chipping
away at their rights, chipping
away at their lives," Williams said.
Williams said the racism is not
unique to the judicial system, but
is inherent in American society. He
said he routinely encountered sub
tle racial tension even at Stanford.
"You talk to your white friends

[at StanfordJ, and some of your
black friends show up. You might
feel a little uncomfortable," he said.
"Or you're talking to your white
friends. Some of their white friends
show up and all of a sudden, they
don't really know you as well."
Hudson said he thinks legal
education needs to change in
order to force future judges and
lawyers to grapple with issues of

race, class and gender before they
assume positions of power.
"I think that's a huge problem
in our criminal justice system
today, that masses of African
Americans and are being
paraded in front of these courts
and they're beingjudged by judges
who have no idea what their day
to-day lives are like," he said.
Williams said he did not
believe that changing the law
school curriculum to add classes
on race would do much to combat
racism, which is caused more by
internal biases than by lack of
education.
Gillam said the Black Law
Students Association, which he
said is organizing an "Adopt a
School" program to tutor children
at schools near Palo Alto. The
association will also lead a voter
registration drive at the begin
ning of the fall quarter, he said.
Given the vast numbers of
young black men who go to prison
instead of going to college, and
given the low self-esteem of many
black children, these law students
said they felt compelled to be visible
role models, and to be accessible to
others less fortunate than they.
Some black law students are
re-examining their future roles as
officers in the judicial system
because of the acquittal in the
Rodney King beating case and its
aftermath.
For these students, the Rodney
King verdict was yet another
demonstration of society's fear
and harassment of black men. To
combat these pervasive stereo
types, some said they feel a greater
sense of obligation to be seen as
representatives of their race.
Teddy Adams, a first year law
student on the executive commit
tee of the Black Law Students
Association, said he sometimes
found it difficult to be in a posi
tion of such responsibility, but he
never felt "really overwhelmed."
"I feel like I've had all these
chances and all these abilities
given to me for some reason that I
feel obligated, and I'd feel I was
shirking my responsibility to
myself and to my family, and to
