The story, flaws and all, of the
renowned psychologist who probed the
nature-verses-nurture conflict of bright
children — a study that continues
today, some seventy years later.
Lewis Terman was an elitist. He
believed that intelligence was
inherited. He originated the
Stanford'Binet 1Q test. He
desperately wanted to prove that the
gifted didn't suffer from "early ripe,
early rot" In 1921 he launched his
pioneering study of the origin and
outcome of bright children. He
gathered up more than 1,500 California kids with IQs of 135 or
higher, and he followed them for the rest of
their lives.
Terman's pioneering study of the gifted continues today.
With unprecedented access to the classified files and to some of
the Terman Kids themselves — almost half of whom arc still
alive — author Joel Shurkin tells what happened to the study
and to the people. He probes the problem, examines the
consequences, and recounts the human stories behind
Terman's sometimes skewed but always significant study. The
Termites, as these gifted peoples called themselves, tend to live
longer, work more happily, cope better, and stay healthier than
the average. Joel N. Shurkin lives in Ben Lomond, California,
teaches journalism at Stanford University, and is a Stanford
News Service science writer.
