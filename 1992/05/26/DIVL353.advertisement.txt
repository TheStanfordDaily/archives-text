ThinkQf It As
Cross 1 !™

The principle: the more ways you have of learning
something, the better you'll understand it. Academic types
call this "multi-modal learning." At Kaplan lest Prep, we
call it cross-training for the mind.
At Kaplan, we integrate more different learning ap
proaches than any other program. When you train for the
MCAT with us, you'll have access to live classes, audio
reinforcements, academic and strategy clinics, home study
notes and individual tutoring. You'll take practice tests that
run the gamut from topic drills to full-length released
exams, from taped self-tests to a simulated MCAT complete
with tickets, timing and proctors.
With this kind of training, no wonder Kaplan produces
more top MCAT scores and prepares more med school
candidates than all other courses combined.
