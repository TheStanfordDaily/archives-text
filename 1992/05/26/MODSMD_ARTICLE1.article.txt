# Kennedy had 'Vision,' was a brash fund-raiser
## During last decade, Stanford's academic repuation, international ties expanded 
### June Cohen Julie Makinen Senior staff writers 
Physically, financially, aca
demically and interna
tionally, the Kennedy
years were ones of growth
and expansion for Stanford.
Since University President
Donald Kennedy took over in
1980, the construction of such
state-of-the-art facilities as the
Center for Integrated Systems
have paved the way for innova
tive academic programs, which
in turn increased Stanford's
prestige both nationally and
internationally.
"There's no doubt that in the
last 10 or 12 years Stanford has
gone from being a top American
university to being one of the
greatest universities in the
world," said Charles Hill, a
senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution.
While the seeds for much of
this expansion were planted in
the '60s and '70s, Kennedy
helped bring them to fruition.
"Kennedy always had a vision
of what the University could
be," said Herbert Lindenberger,
interim director of the Humani
ties Center. "Although often

that vision was controversial,
you couldn't deny that he had
vision."
And Elizabeth Sloan, director
of communications in the Office
of Development, agreed.
"Don took a central role from
the beginning, articulating the
vision of Stanford and then help
ing us to refine the vision into
development objectives," she
said.
Despite recent budget
cuts, the 1980s were a
period of substantial
economic growth for
Stanford.

During Donald Kennedy's tenure as University president, Stanford has seen unprecedented growth
and expansion. "Stanford has gone from being a top American university to being one of the great
est universities in the world," said Charles Hill, a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution.

$60 million to over $180 million.
Research volume has expanded
from $114 million to $295 million,
and both the operating and non
operating < budgets have grown at
least 5 percent annually.
But perhaps the most impres
sive measure of Stanford's fiscal
health under Kennedy was the
Centennial Campaign — called by
many the most successful fund
raising endeavor ever undertaken
in the history of higher education.
Between 1987 and 1992, Stanford
raised about $1,269 billion for
everything from new equipment
and buildings to endowed profes
sorships and student financial aid.

Despite the success of the Cen
tennial Campaign, the University
found itself with a $43 million
deficit last year, largely as a result
of the federal government's deci
sion to cut Stanford's indirect
cost rate from 72 to 55.5 percent.
Other contributing factors
were a slower-than-projected
growth in sponsored research
activity and lower yields on
""investments.
But the budget cuts will not
eradicate the long-lasting
improvements made possible by
the Centennial Campaign, orga
nizers say. The funds raised by
the campaign were primarily slat
ed for long-term projects such as
science facilities, professorships,
strengthening the humanities
and improving undergraduate
education.
Kennedy's flair for fund rais
ing was central to the campaign,
according to University officials.
"The Centennial Campaign
was made easier, was made possi
ble, because Don is the kind of per
son he is," said Richard Bennett,
associate campaign director. "He
thought about it early on — way
back in '82 he was thinking about
the objectives of the campaign like
support for undergraduates, the
humanities, the faculty and sci
ence buildings. He had vision."
"Not only was he a good articu
lator of the vision but he was will
ing and able to go out and ask for
large sums of money in a very per
suasive, compelling, professional
way," said Sloan. "I think it's rare
to find both those abilities resi
dent in one person."

Although some goals of the
campaign — like the $180 million
Near West Campus plan for sci
ence buildings, funding for Meyer
Library and support for student
residences — went unmet, Sloan
called the project "enormously
successful by any measure."
Kennedy's enthusiasm and
knowledge of the University made
him a "very effective fund-raiser,"
Bennett said.
"He's mentally very quick and
he can pick up on somebody's sig
nals when they don't like a partic
ular idea," Bennett said. "He's
quick to reach back into his head
and say, 'Forget about that [idea],
how about this?' "
Hill agreed that Kennedy's
"dynamic personality" and fund
raising ability were his greatest
strengths.
"When Donald Kennedy is in a
room, you cannot ignore him —
and that's important," he said.
The Centennial Celebra
tion did more than just
raise funds for the Uni
versity's expansion. The
four celebrations held overseas —
in London, Mexico City, Toronto
and Hong Kong — were testa
ments to Stanford's growing
international presence.
"Education for this new world
begins with international educa
tion," Kennedy told alumni at the
third international event, held in
Toronto in March 1990. He out
lined plans to increase the repre
sentation of international stu
dents at Stanford and expand
overseas campuses.
Until the mid- to late-'Bos,
Stanford's overseas centers were
highly Eurocentric and somewhat
isolationist — "they were really
enclaves of American students
and American faculty and they
did not have a lot of interaction,"
Kennedy said.
But the 1989 opening of the
Stanford Japan Center in Kyoto
and the 1990 debut of the center
in Santiago, Chile broke this
mold.
With Kennedy's support and
enthusiasm — in 1986 he told
Japanese reporters that Stanford
will be "looking westward for. its
second hundred years" — the
Japan Center, consisting of the
Stanford Center for Technology
and Innovation and the Kyoto
Program in Japanese Studies,
established the University as a
permanent entity in Asia.
"It is hard to say, but I think
that the overseas campuses con
tribute more to Stanford's aca
demic prestige than they used to,"
Kennedy said. "In Oxford, Paris,
Kyoto, Berlin, there are tighter
relationships between the Stan
ford overseas campuses and local
academics. They tend much more
to be centers of political economy
than high culture, which helps
the quality of the academic inter
action."
In Kyoto, for instance, Stan
ford researchers conduct joint pro
jects with Japanese economists
and scientists.
The Santiago campus provides
Stanford an entry point into anoth
er global region — one that is just
beginning to burgeon academically,
according to Kodolfo Stavenhagen,
a visiting professor with the Insti
tute for International Studies.
"After a decade of dark ages,"
many Latin American countries
are returning to civilian govern
ments, Stavenhagen said. "There

are improved possibilities of
expanding academic institutions
there, and [Latin American schol
ars] need full support of their col
leagues in the United States."
Stanford's program in Latin
American Studies has gained in
prominence over the past few
years and is one of the best in the
United States, Stavenhagen said.
While each program
and overseas campus
is an end in itself,
Kennedy also sees
them as means to a greater goal —
answering the challenge issued by
former U.S. Secretary of State
and Hoover Distinguished Fellow
George Shultz to become a "world
university."
Shultz, who has attracted
countless world leaders to campus
in the years since his return, has
been credited — perhaps even
more than Kennedy — with
putting Stanford on the map.
With extensive international
contacts and a stately presence that
commands respect, Shultz played a
leading role in the creation of the
Institute for International Studies,
an umbrella organization that
coordinates Stanford's many inter
national efforts and creates links
among academic, business and pol
icy-making groups.
"George has set the right target
out there," Kennedy said. "Some
body has got to be the first world
university — why not you? And I
think that the lIS gives us the
right organizational structure."
The institute, which was estab
lished in 1989, boasts an advisory
council of well-known world lead
ers, including former Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias; Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney;
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley; and
Yotaro Kobayashi, chair and CEO
of Fuji Xerox.

Law Prof. Tom Heller, director
of Overseas Studies and deputy
director of the institute, said its
main role is "coming up with
mechanisms that allow Stanford's
research capacities to be merged
with people in business and gov
ernment who are in positions to
introduce some of these ideas into
the flow of policy making."
And History Prof. Norman
Naimark, director of the Center
for Russian and East European
Studies, agreed. lIS encourages
Stanford scholars to work "closely
with the academic communities"
in Eastern Europe, Naimark said.
"They desperately need help —
their infrastructure is falling
apart. They need concrete help."
It is in these metamorphosiz
ing Eastern European com
munities that Stanford and
Hoover scholars have had the
most high-profile influence in the
past few years.
Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin both consulted
Hoover scholars on economic poli

cy, and the think tank rose to
great international prominence in
the wake of the Soviet coup last
summer.
"Hoover is enormously well
known, its archive, its collection
activities, its curatorial work, and
in many places its academic stud
ies are very well-known and
respected," Kennedy said.
"I remember when George
Shultz, as secretary of state, first
met Gorbachev in Moscow," Hill
said. "Gorbachev held in his hand a
copy of ("New Ideas for the '80s,")
a Hoover book, and said, 'I know all
about you and your ideas.' "
The two campus visits by Gor
bachev in the past three years
made headlines nationwide, and
reflect the increased international
prominence the University and
Hoover have attained.
"By coming here, Gorbachev
gave Hoover and Stanford pres
tige," Hill said. But more impor
tantly, "Their prestige led Gor
bachev to come here."
In addition to expansion inter
nationally, strengthening the
humanities at home was
another University initiative
in the '80s.
"The humanities at Stanford
are stronger than they've ever
been," said English Prof. Herbert
Lindenberger, interim director of
the Humanities Center.
The center, which was one of
Kennedy's first initiatives, offers
one-year fellowships to humanities
faculty from Stanford and else
where so they can conduct research.
As the first university-based
research center in the country, it
was the first in a string of additions
to Stanford's humanities program.
During the last 12 years,
majors in Feminist Studies and
Symbolic Systems have been
added. Interdisciplinary programs
in Jewish Studies, the History of
Science, Medieval Studies and
other areas have been founded or
expanded. Continuing Studies,
which offers courses to faculty,
staff and community members,
was also started.
On the science side, Earth Sys
tems, a new interdisciplinary
major approved this year,
approaches environmental studies
from several directions, providing
students with a solid grounding in
physical and biological sciences, as
well as public policy.
Through the Centennial Cam
paign, 37 chairs and $7.7 million
in graduate fellowships were
added to the school of Humanities
and Sciences. Another $11.3 mil
lion was raised for interdisci
plinary programs.
Other projects, including the
Center for Chicano Research and
the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers
Project, further contributed to the
elevation of the humanities.
"The improvement in Stan
ford's humanities can be seen in
our rise to the top of the rankings
in the departments of History,
English, Linguistics and other
areas," said Ewart Thomas, dean
of Humanities and Sciences, cit
ing Stanford's high rankings in a
recent U.S. News and World
Report article on the nation's top
graduate programs.
Stanford has also topped the
magazine's rankings of under
graduate programs several times
in recent years.
"This handful of programs is a
sample that proves that there has
been a dramatic improvement in
outsiders' perception of our human
ities departments," Thomas said.
Several faculty members
praised Kennedy's work on behalf

of the humanities.
"Kennedy was instrumental in
pushing Jewish Studies forward,"
said Arnold Eisen, director of the
program. "It was another step in
making Stanford more cosmopoli
tan and more multicultural,
something [Kennedy] supports
very much."
English Prof. Diane Middle
brook, a former fellow at the cen
ter who is also actively involved in
the Feminist Studies program,
praised Kennedy's support of
interdisciplinary programs.
"Kennedy's model of Human
Biology led to the development of
other interdisciplinary pro
grams," Middlebrook said.
But History Prof. Clay Carson,
director of the King Papers Pro
ject, said that while Kennedy
played an "important role" in
helping to establish the project,
more work is still needed to
strengthen the humanities at
Stanford.
"I would have hoped more
could have been done," said Car
son. "[Kennedy] was sincere in
his belief that the humanities
should be of equal strength com
pared to say, engineering, in
terms of national prestige. But I
don't know if his desire to do that
has really affected policies."
Carson called the departments
of History and Afro-American

Studies "undersized."
"I have to question, relative to
the other large components of the
University: has there been a seri
ous allocation of resources?" Car
son said.
Hill echoed Carson's senti
ments.
"I think that there can be more
attention paid to humanities as a
whole and its stature within the
University," he said.
Kennedy, although he cites
"strengthening of the humanities
departments" as a major accom
plishment during his time here,
recognizes some of the faculty dis
content.
The humanities, he said, "are
better at Stanford, but there is
still a sense on the part of the
humanities faculty that there is a
disparity here that favors the sci
ences."
In addition to the expansion of
academic programs, Kennedy's
tenure as president was marked
by the creation of major new
facilities and a doubling of the Uni
versity's physical plant value.
At the Medical School, several
large construction projects were
begun in the '80s, including the
Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal and the Beckman Center for

Former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz and University President Donald Kennedy are credited
with bringing world leaders to campus and helping to boost Stanford's international reputation. During
the Centennial Celebration Sept. 29, Kennedy and Shultz met with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mul
roney, at left, and Mexican President Carlos Salinas, at right, to discuss the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
Molecular and Genetic Medicine.
In addition, the Hospital Mod
ernization Project refurbished
Stanford Hospital at a cost of
more than $150 million.
Several large student residence
complexes were also completed,
including Governor's Corner,
Sterling Quad, the Suites, Rains
Houses, Kimball Hall and Man
zanita 11. Two other undergradu
ate residences are planned, which
will be located on the Knoll and
are schedule to open in 1994.
Nearly 2,000 spaces have been
added to University housing dur
ing Kennedy's tenure, allowing
the University to deliver on its
long-delayed pledge to provide
four years of guaranteed housing
for all undergraduates. The
pledge will begin with next year's
freshmen.
Other projects included the
construction of the Tennis Stadi
um, the Ford Center, Sweet Hall,
Littlefield Center at the Business
School, the Center for Integrated
Systems and Braun Music Cen
ter. The Rodin Sculpture Garden
was installed and the Red Barn
was restored.
But "Near West Campus,"
Stanford's most ambitious build
ing project, was repeatedly down
scaled and delayed.
In the early '80s, Kennedy,
lamenting nearly 20 years of
"capital starvation" of American
universities after the federal gov
ernment stopped financing the
construction of research facilities,

called for "the transformation of
the shantytown west of the Quad
into a real Stanford center for sci
ence and engineering."
The $250 million, 41-acre
transformation, which became
known as the Near West Campus
project, aimed to construct four
major research facilities, refur
bish old labs and expand several
existing buildings. But after the
1989 earthquake, that figure was
downsized to $180 million and
then $140 million, as funds were
diverted for earthquake repairs.
Kennedy called the problems
with Near West "disappointing."
In addition to the earthquake,
impending cuts in the indirect
cost rate also limited the project,
Kennedy said.
By the end of the Centennial
Campaign, only $90 million and
two buildings — the Gilbert Biol
ogy Center and the Keck Science
Building — had been raised.
Green Earth Sciences Building is
currently under construction, but
the Advanced Materials Research
Building has been considerably
downsized and remains on the
drawing board.
Despite the disappointments of
Near West, former Provost James
Rosse said he believes Stanford
will be "reasonably well-endowed
in facilities for a long time."
"If federal support policies for
research had continued, I would
have been very unhappy about
not being able to carry [Near
West] out," said Rosse.
"But given the changes, I am
glad we were able to get it stopped
in time before the University
faced even bigger financial diffi
culties."

"Kennedy's model of Human
Biology led to the development of
other interdisciplinary pro
grams," Middlebrook said.
But History Prof. Clay Carson,
director of the King Papers Pro
ject, said that while Kennedy
played an "important role" in
helping to establish the project,
more work is still needed to
strengthen the humanities at
Stanford.
"I would have hoped more
could have been done," said Car
son. "[Kennedy] was sincere in
his belief that the humanities
should be of equal strength com
pared to say, engineering, in
terms of national prestige. But I
don't know if his desire to do that
has really affected policies."
Carson called the departments
of History and Afro-American

Studies "undersized."
"I have to question, relative to
the other large components of the
University: has there been a seri
ous allocation of resources?" Car
son said.
Hill echoed Carson's senti
ments.
"I think that there can be more
attention paid to humanities as a
whole and its stature within the
University," he said.
Kennedy, although he cites
"strengthening of the humanities
departments" as a major accom
plishment during his time here,
recognizes some of the faculty dis
content.
The humanities, he said, "are
better at Stanford, but there is
still a sense on the part of the
humanities faculty that there is a
disparity here that favors the sci
ences."
In addition to the expansion of
academic programs, Kennedy's
tenure as president was marked
by the creation of major new
facilities and a doubling of the Uni
versity's physical plant value.
At the Medical School, several
large construction projects were
begun in the '80s, including the
Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal and the Beckman Center for

Former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz and University President Donald Kennedy are credited
with bringing world leaders to campus and helping to boost Stanford's international reputation. During
the Centennial Celebration Sept. 29, Kennedy and Shultz met with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mul
roney, at left, and Mexican President Carlos Salinas, at right, to discuss the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
Molecular and Genetic Medicine.
In addition, the Hospital Mod
ernization Project refurbished
Stanford Hospital at a cost of
more than $150 million.
Several large student residence
complexes were also completed,
including Governor's Corner,
Sterling Quad, the Suites, Rains
Houses, Kimball Hall and Man
zanita 11. Two other undergradu
ate residences are planned, which
will be located on the Knoll and
are schedule to open in 1994.
Nearly 2,000 spaces have been
added to University housing dur
ing Kennedy's tenure, allowing
the University to deliver on its
long-delayed pledge to provide
four years of guaranteed housing
for all undergraduates. The
pledge will begin with next year's
freshmen.
Other projects included the
construction of the Tennis Stadi
um, the Ford Center, Sweet Hall,
Littlefield Center at the Business
School, the Center for Integrated
Systems and Braun Music Cen
ter. The Rodin Sculpture Garden
was installed and the Red Barn
was restored.
But "Near West Campus,"
Stanford's most ambitious build
ing project, was repeatedly down
scaled and delayed.
In the early '80s, Kennedy,
lamenting nearly 20 years of
"capital starvation" of American
universities after the federal gov
ernment stopped financing the
construction of research facilities,

called for "the transformation of
the shantytown west of the Quad
into a real Stanford center for sci
ence and engineering."
The $250 million, 41-acre
transformation, which became
known as the Near West Campus
project, aimed to construct four
major research facilities, refur
bish old labs and expand several
existing buildings. But after the
1989 earthquake, that figure was
downsized to $180 million and
then $140 million, as funds were
diverted for earthquake repairs.
Kennedy called the problems
with Near West "disappointing."
In addition to the earthquake,
impending cuts in the indirect
cost rate also limited the project,
Kennedy said.
By the end of the Centennial
Campaign, only $90 million and
two buildings — the Gilbert Biol
ogy Center and the Keck Science
Building — had been raised.
Green Earth Sciences Building is
currently under construction, but
the Advanced Materials Research
Building has been considerably
downsized and remains on the
drawing board.
Despite the disappointments of
Near West, former Provost James
Rosse said he believes Stanford
will be "reasonably well-endowed
in facilities for a long time."
"If federal support policies for
research had continued, I would
have been very unhappy about
not being able to carry [Near
West] out," said Rosse.
"But given the changes, I am
glad we were able to get it stopped
in time before the University
faced even bigger financial diffi
culties."

Long-time Stanford donor Cecil Green breaks ground in October for
the Green Earth Sciences Building, as University President Donald
Kennedy looks on.
Physically, financially, aca
demically and interna
tionally, the Kennedy
years were ones of growth
and expansion for Stanford.
Since University President
Donald Kennedy took over in
1980, the construction of such
state-of-the-art facilities as the
Center for Integrated Systems
have paved the way for innova
tive academic programs, which
in turn increased Stanford's
prestige both nationally and
internationally.
"There's no doubt that in the
last 10 or 12 years Stanford has
gone from being a top American
university to being one of the
greatest universities in the
world," said Charles Hill, a
senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution.
While the seeds for much of
this expansion were planted in
the '60s and '70s, Kennedy
helped bring them to fruition.
"Kennedy always had a vision
of what the University could
be," said Herbert Lindenberger,
interim director of the Humani
ties Center. "Although often

that vision was controversial,
you couldn't deny that he had
vision."
And Elizabeth Sloan, director
of communications in the Office
of Development, agreed.
"Don took a central role from
the beginning, articulating the
vision of Stanford and then help
ing us to refine the vision into
development objectives," she
said.
Despite recent budget
cuts, the 1980s were a
period of substantial
economic growth for
Stanford.

$60 million to over $180 million.
Research volume has expanded
from $114 million to $295 million,
and both the operating and non
operating < budgets have grown at
least 5 percent annually.
But perhaps the most impres
sive measure of Stanford's fiscal
health under Kennedy was the
Centennial Campaign — called by
many the most successful fund
raising endeavor ever undertaken
in the history of higher education.
Between 1987 and 1992, Stanford
raised about $1,269 billion for
everything from new equipment
and buildings to endowed profes
sorships and student financial aid.

Despite the success of the Cen
tennial Campaign, the University
found itself with a $43 million
deficit last year, largely as a result
of the federal government's deci
sion to cut Stanford's indirect
cost rate from 72 to 55.5 percent.
Other contributing factors
were a slower-than-projected
growth in sponsored research
activity and lower yields on
""investments.
But the budget cuts will not
eradicate the long-lasting
improvements made possible by
the Centennial Campaign, orga
nizers say. The funds raised by
the campaign were primarily slat
ed for long-term projects such as
science facilities, professorships,
strengthening the humanities
and improving undergraduate
education.
Kennedy's flair for fund rais
ing was central to the campaign,
according to University officials.
"The Centennial Campaign
was made easier, was made possi
ble, because Don is the kind of per
son he is," said Richard Bennett,
associate campaign director. "He
thought about it early on — way
back in '82 he was thinking about
the objectives of the campaign like
support for undergraduates, the
humanities, the faculty and sci
ence buildings. He had vision."
"Not only was he a good articu
lator of the vision but he was will
ing and able to go out and ask for
large sums of money in a very per
suasive, compelling, professional
way," said Sloan. "I think it's rare
to find both those abilities resi
dent in one person."

Although some goals of the
campaign — like the $180 million
Near West Campus plan for sci
ence buildings, funding for Meyer
Library and support for student
residences — went unmet, Sloan
called the project "enormously
successful by any measure."
Kennedy's enthusiasm and
knowledge of the University made
him a "very effective fund-raiser,"
Bennett said.
"He's mentally very quick and
he can pick up on somebody's sig
nals when they don't like a partic
ular idea," Bennett said. "He's
quick to reach back into his head
and say, 'Forget about that [idea],
how about this?' "
Hill agreed that Kennedy's
"dynamic personality" and fund
raising ability were his greatest
strengths.
"When Donald Kennedy is in a
room, you cannot ignore him —
and that's important," he said.
The Centennial Celebra
tion did more than just
raise funds for the Uni
versity's expansion. The
four celebrations held overseas —
in London, Mexico City, Toronto
and Hong Kong — were testa
ments to Stanford's growing
international presence.
"Education for this new world
begins with international educa
tion," Kennedy told alumni at the
third international event, held in
Toronto in March 1990. He out
lined plans to increase the repre
sentation of international stu
dents at Stanford and expand
overseas campuses.
Until the mid- to late-'Bos,
Stanford's overseas centers were
highly Eurocentric and somewhat
isolationist — "they were really
enclaves of American students
and American faculty and they
did not have a lot of interaction,"
Kennedy said.
But the 1989 opening of the
Stanford Japan Center in Kyoto
and the 1990 debut of the center
in Santiago, Chile broke this
mold.
With Kennedy's support and
enthusiasm — in 1986 he told
Japanese reporters that Stanford
will be "looking westward for. its
second hundred years" — the
Japan Center, consisting of the
Stanford Center for Technology
and Innovation and the Kyoto
Program in Japanese Studies,
established the University as a
permanent entity in Asia.
"It is hard to say, but I think
that the overseas campuses con
tribute more to Stanford's aca
demic prestige than they used to,"
Kennedy said. "In Oxford, Paris,
Kyoto, Berlin, there are tighter
relationships between the Stan
ford overseas campuses and local
academics. They tend much more
to be centers of political economy
than high culture, which helps
the quality of the academic inter
action."
In Kyoto, for instance, Stan
ford researchers conduct joint pro
jects with Japanese economists
and scientists.
The Santiago campus provides
Stanford an entry point into anoth
er global region — one that is just
beginning to burgeon academically,
according to Kodolfo Stavenhagen,
a visiting professor with the Insti
tute for International Studies.
"After a decade of dark ages,"
many Latin American countries
are returning to civilian govern
ments, Stavenhagen said. "There

are improved possibilities of
expanding academic institutions
there, and [Latin American schol
ars] need full support of their col
leagues in the United States."
Stanford's program in Latin
American Studies has gained in
prominence over the past few
years and is one of the best in the
United States, Stavenhagen said.
While each program
and overseas campus
is an end in itself,
Kennedy also sees
them as means to a greater goal —
answering the challenge issued by
former U.S. Secretary of State
and Hoover Distinguished Fellow
George Shultz to become a "world
university."
Shultz, who has attracted
countless world leaders to campus
in the years since his return, has
been credited — perhaps even
more than Kennedy — with
putting Stanford on the map.
With extensive international
contacts and a stately presence that
commands respect, Shultz played a
leading role in the creation of the
Institute for International Studies,
an umbrella organization that
coordinates Stanford's many inter
national efforts and creates links
among academic, business and pol
icy-making groups.
"George has set the right target
out there," Kennedy said. "Some
body has got to be the first world
university — why not you? And I
think that the lIS gives us the
right organizational structure."
The institute, which was estab
lished in 1989, boasts an advisory
council of well-known world lead
ers, including former Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias; Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney;
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley; and
Yotaro Kobayashi, chair and CEO
of Fuji Xerox.

Law Prof. Tom Heller, director
of Overseas Studies and deputy
director of the institute, said its
main role is "coming up with
mechanisms that allow Stanford's
research capacities to be merged
with people in business and gov
ernment who are in positions to
introduce some of these ideas into
the flow of policy making."
And History Prof. Norman
Naimark, director of the Center
for Russian and East European
Studies, agreed. lIS encourages
Stanford scholars to work "closely
with the academic communities"
in Eastern Europe, Naimark said.
"They desperately need help —
their infrastructure is falling
apart. They need concrete help."
It is in these metamorphosiz
ing Eastern European com
munities that Stanford and
Hoover scholars have had the
most high-profile influence in the
past few years.
Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin both consulted
Hoover scholars on economic poli

cy, and the think tank rose to
great international prominence in
the wake of the Soviet coup last
summer.
"Hoover is enormously well
known, its archive, its collection
activities, its curatorial work, and
in many places its academic stud
ies are very well-known and
respected," Kennedy said.
"I remember when George
Shultz, as secretary of state, first
met Gorbachev in Moscow," Hill
said. "Gorbachev held in his hand a
copy of ("New Ideas for the '80s,")
a Hoover book, and said, 'I know all
about you and your ideas.' "
The two campus visits by Gor
bachev in the past three years
made headlines nationwide, and
reflect the increased international
prominence the University and
Hoover have attained.
"By coming here, Gorbachev
gave Hoover and Stanford pres
tige," Hill said. But more impor
tantly, "Their prestige led Gor
bachev to come here."
In addition to expansion inter
nationally, strengthening the
humanities at home was
another University initiative
in the '80s.
"The humanities at Stanford
are stronger than they've ever
been," said English Prof. Herbert
Lindenberger, interim director of
the Humanities Center.
The center, which was one of
Kennedy's first initiatives, offers
one-year fellowships to humanities
faculty from Stanford and else
where so they can conduct research.
As the first university-based
research center in the country, it
was the first in a string of additions
to Stanford's humanities program.
During the last 12 years,
majors in Feminist Studies and
Symbolic Systems have been
added. Interdisciplinary programs
in Jewish Studies, the History of
Science, Medieval Studies and
other areas have been founded or
expanded. Continuing Studies,
which offers courses to faculty,
staff and community members,
was also started.
On the science side, Earth Sys
tems, a new interdisciplinary
major approved this year,
approaches environmental studies
from several directions, providing
students with a solid grounding in
physical and biological sciences, as
well as public policy.
Through the Centennial Cam
paign, 37 chairs and $7.7 million
in graduate fellowships were
added to the school of Humanities
and Sciences. Another $11.3 mil
lion was raised for interdisci
plinary programs.
Other projects, including the
Center for Chicano Research and
the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers
Project, further contributed to the
elevation of the humanities.
"The improvement in Stan
ford's humanities can be seen in
our rise to the top of the rankings
in the departments of History,
English, Linguistics and other
areas," said Ewart Thomas, dean
of Humanities and Sciences, cit
ing Stanford's high rankings in a
recent U.S. News and World
Report article on the nation's top
graduate programs.
Stanford has also topped the
magazine's rankings of under
graduate programs several times
in recent years.
"This handful of programs is a
sample that proves that there has
been a dramatic improvement in
outsiders' perception of our human
ities departments," Thomas said.
Several faculty members
praised Kennedy's work on behalf

of the humanities.
"Kennedy was instrumental in
pushing Jewish Studies forward,"
said Arnold Eisen, director of the
program. "It was another step in
making Stanford more cosmopoli
tan and more multicultural,
something [Kennedy] supports
very much."
English Prof. Diane Middle
brook, a former fellow at the cen
ter who is also actively involved in
the Feminist Studies program,
praised Kennedy's support of
interdisciplinary programs.
"Kennedy's model of Human
Biology led to the development of
other interdisciplinary pro
grams," Middlebrook said.
But History Prof. Clay Carson,
director of the King Papers Pro
ject, said that while Kennedy
played an "important role" in
helping to establish the project,
more work is still needed to
strengthen the humanities at
Stanford.
"I would have hoped more
could have been done," said Car
son. "[Kennedy] was sincere in
his belief that the humanities
should be of equal strength com
pared to say, engineering, in
terms of national prestige. But I
don't know if his desire to do that

of History and Afro-American

Studies "undersized."
"I have to question, relative to

Hill echoed Carson's senti

among academic, business and pol
icy-making groups.
"George has set the right target
out there," Kennedy said. "Some
body has got to be the first world
university — why not you? And I
think that the lIS gives us the
right organizational structure."
The institute, which was estab
lished in 1989, boasts an advisory
council of well-known world lead
ers, including former Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias; Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney;
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley; and
Yotaro Kobayashi, chair and CEO
of Fuji Xerox.

Law Prof. Tom Heller, director
of Overseas Studies and deputy
director of the institute, said its
main role is "coming up with
mechanisms that allow Stanford's
research capacities to be merged
with people in business and gov
ernment who are in positions to
introduce some of these ideas into
the flow of policy making."
And History Prof. Norman
Naimark, director of the Center
for Russian and East European
Studies, agreed. lIS encourages
Stanford scholars to work "closely
with the academic communities"
in Eastern Europe, Naimark said.
"They desperately need help —
their infrastructure is falling
apart. They need concrete help."
It is in these metamorphosiz
ing Eastern European com
munities that Stanford and
Hoover scholars have had the
most high-profile influence in the
past few years.
Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin both consulted
Hoover scholars on economic poli

cy, and the think tank rose to
great international prominence in
the wake of the Soviet coup last
summer.
"Hoover is enormously well
known, its archive, its collection
activities, its curatorial work, and
in many places its academic stud
ies are very well-known and
respected," Kennedy said.
"I remember when George
Shultz, as secretary of state, first
met Gorbachev in Moscow," Hill
said. "Gorbachev held in his hand a
copy of ("New Ideas for the '80s,")
a Hoover book, and said, 'I know all
about you and your ideas.' "
The two campus visits by Gor
bachev in the past three years
made headlines nationwide, and
reflect the increased international
prominence the University and
Hoover have attained.
"By coming here, Gorbachev
gave Hoover and Stanford pres
tige," Hill said. But more impor
tantly, "Their prestige led Gor
bachev to come here."
In addition to expansion inter
nationally, strengthening the
humanities at home was
another University initiative
in the '80s.
"The humanities at Stanford
are stronger than they've ever
been," said English Prof. Herbert
Lindenberger, interim director of
the Humanities Center.
The center, which was one of
Kennedy's first initiatives, offers
one-year fellowships to humanities
faculty from Stanford and else
where so they can conduct research.
As the first university-based
research center in the country, it
was the first in a string of additions
to Stanford's humanities program.
During the last 12 years,
majors in Feminist Studies and
Symbolic Systems have been
added. Interdisciplinary programs
in Jewish Studies, the History of
Science, Medieval Studies and
other areas have been founded or
expanded. Continuing Studies,
which offers courses to faculty,
staff and community members,
was also started.
On the science side, Earth Sys
tems, a new interdisciplinary
major approved this year,
approaches environmental studies
from several directions, providing
students with a solid grounding in
physical and biological sciences, as
well as public policy.
Through the Centennial Cam
paign, 37 chairs and $7.7 million
in graduate fellowships were
added to the school of Humanities
and Sciences. Another $11.3 mil
lion was raised for interdisci
plinary programs.
Other projects, including the
Center for Chicano Research and
the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers
Project, further contributed to the
elevation of the humanities.
"The improvement in Stan
ford's humanities can be seen in
our rise to the top of the rankings
in the departments of History,
English, Linguistics and other
areas," said Ewart Thomas, dean
of Humanities and Sciences, cit
ing Stanford's high rankings in a
recent U.S. News and World
Report article on the nation's top
graduate programs.
Stanford has also topped the
magazine's rankings of under
graduate programs several times
in recent years.
"This handful of programs is a
sample that proves that there has
been a dramatic improvement in
outsiders' perception of our human
ities departments," Thomas said.
Several faculty members
praised Kennedy's work on behalf

of the humanities.
"Kennedy was instrumental in
pushing Jewish Studies forward,"
said Arnold Eisen, director of the
program. "It was another step in
making Stanford more cosmopoli
tan and more multicultural,
something [Kennedy] supports
very much."
English Prof. Diane Middle
brook, a former fellow at the cen
ter who is also actively involved in
the Feminist Studies program,
praised Kennedy's support of
interdisciplinary programs.
"Kennedy's model of Human
Biology led to the development of
other interdisciplinary pro
grams," Middlebrook said.
But History Prof. Clay Carson,
director of the King Papers Pro
ject, said that while Kennedy
played an "important role" in
helping to establish the project,
more work is still needed to
strengthen the humanities at
Stanford.
"I would have hoped more
could have been done," said Car
son. "[Kennedy] was sincere in
his belief that the humanities
should be of equal strength com
pared to say, engineering, in
terms of national prestige. But I
don't know if his desire to do that
has really affected policies."
Carson called the departments
of History and Afro-American

Studies "undersized."
"I have to question, relative to
the other large components of the
University: has there been a seri
ous allocation of resources?" Car
son said.
Hill echoed Carson's senti
ments.
"I think that there can be more
attention paid to humanities as a
whole and its stature within the
University," he said.
Kennedy, although he cites
"strengthening of the humanities
departments" as a major accom
plishment during his time here,
recognizes some of the faculty dis
content.
The humanities, he said, "are
better at Stanford, but there is
still a sense on the part of the
humanities faculty that there is a
disparity here that favors the sci
ences."
In addition to the expansion of
academic programs, Kennedy's
tenure as president was marked
by the creation of major new
facilities and a doubling of the Uni
versity's physical plant value.
At the Medical School, several
large construction projects were
begun in the '80s, including the
Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal and the Beckman Center for

Molecular and Genetic Medicine.
In addition, the Hospital Mod
ernization Project refurbished
Stanford Hospital at a cost of
more than $150 million.
Several large student residence
complexes were also completed,
including Governor's Corner,
Sterling Quad, the Suites, Rains
Houses, Kimball Hall and Man
zanita 11. Two other undergradu
ate residences are planned, which
will be located on the Knoll and
are schedule to open in 1994.
Nearly 2,000 spaces have been
added to University housing dur
ing Kennedy's tenure, allowing
the University to deliver on its
long-delayed pledge to provide
four years of guaranteed housing
for all undergraduates. The
pledge will begin with next year's
freshmen.
Other projects included the
construction of the Tennis Stadi
um, the Ford Center, Sweet Hall,
Littlefield Center at the Business
School, the Center for Integrated
Systems and Braun Music Cen
ter. The Rodin Sculpture Garden
was installed and the Red Barn
was restored.
But "Near West Campus,"
Stanford's most ambitious build
ing project, was repeatedly down
scaled and delayed.
In the early '80s, Kennedy,
lamenting nearly 20 years of
"capital starvation" of American
universities after the federal gov
ernment stopped financing the
construction of research facilities,

called for "the transformation of
the shantytown west of the Quad
into a real Stanford center for sci
ence and engineering."
The $250 million, 41-acre
transformation, which became
known as the Near West Campus
project, aimed to construct four
major research facilities, refur
bish old labs and expand several
existing buildings. But after the
1989 earthquake, that figure was
downsized to $180 million and
then $140 million, as funds were
diverted for earthquake repairs.
Kennedy called the problems
with Near West "disappointing."
In addition to the earthquake,
impending cuts in the indirect
cost rate also limited the project,
Kennedy said.
By the end of the Centennial
Campaign, only $90 million and
two buildings — the Gilbert Biol
ogy Center and the Keck Science
Building — had been raised.
Green Earth Sciences Building is
currently under construction, but
the Advanced Materials Research
Building has been considerably
downsized and remains on the
drawing board.
Despite the disappointments of
Near West, former Provost James
Rosse said he believes Stanford
will be "reasonably well-endowed
in facilities for a long time."
"If federal support policies for
research had continued, I would
have been very unhappy about
not being able to carry [Near
West] out," said Rosse.
"But given the changes, I am
glad we were able to get it stopped
in time before the University
faced even bigger financial diffi
culties."

Long-time Stanford donor Cecil Green breaks ground in October for
the Green Earth Sciences Building, as University President Donald
Kennedy looks on.
Physically, financially, aca
demically and interna
tionally, the Kennedy
years were ones of growth
and expansion for Stanford.
Since University President
Donald Kennedy took over in
1980, the construction of such
state-of-the-art facilities as the
Center for Integrated Systems
have paved the way for innova
tive academic programs, which
in turn increased Stanford's
prestige both nationally and
internationally.
"There's no doubt that in the
last 10 or 12 years Stanford has
gone from being a top American
university to being one of the
greatest universities in the
world," said Charles Hill, a
senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution.
While the seeds for much of
this expansion were planted in
the '60s and '70s, Kennedy
helped bring them to fruition.
"Kennedy always had a vision
of what the University could
be," said Herbert Lindenberger,
interim director of the Humani
ties Center. "Although often

that vision was controversial,
you couldn't deny that he had
vision."
And Elizabeth Sloan, director
of communications in the Office
of Development, agreed.
"Don took a central role from
the beginning, articulating the
vision of Stanford and then help
ing us to refine the vision into

said.
Despite recent budget
cuts, the 1980s were a
period of substantial
economic growth for
Stanford.

$60 million to over $180 million.
Research volume has expanded
from $114 million to $295 million,
and both the operating and non
operating < budgets have grown at
least 5 percent annually.
But perhaps the most impres
sive measure of Stanford's fiscal
health under Kennedy was the
Centennial Campaign — called by
many the most successful fund
raising endeavor ever undertaken
in the history of higher education.
Between 1987 and 1992, Stanford
raised about $1,269 billion for
everything from new equipment
and buildings to endowed profes
sorships and student financial aid.

Despite the success of the Cen
tennial Campaign, the University
found itself with a $43 million
deficit last year, largely as a result
of the federal government's deci
sion to cut Stanford's indirect
cost rate from 72 to 55.5 percent.
Other contributing factors
were a slower-than-projected
growth in sponsored research
activity and lower yields on
""investments.
But the budget cuts will not
eradicate the long-lasting
improvements made possible by
the Centennial Campaign, orga
nizers say. The funds raised by
the campaign were primarily slat
ed for long-term projects such as
science facilities, professorships,
strengthening the humanities
and improving undergraduate
education.
Kennedy's flair for fund rais
ing was central to the campaign,
according to University officials.
"The Centennial Campaign
was made easier, was made possi
ble, because Don is the kind of per
son he is," said Richard Bennett,
associate campaign director. "He
thought about it early on — way
back in '82 he was thinking about
the objectives of the campaign like
support for undergraduates, the
humanities, the faculty and sci
ence buildings. He had vision."
"Not only was he a good articu
lator of the vision but he was will
ing and able to go out and ask for
large sums of money in a very per
suasive, compelling, professional
way," said Sloan. "I think it's rare
to find both those abilities resi
dent in one person."

Although some goals of the
campaign — like the $180 million
Near West Campus plan for sci
ence buildings, funding for Meyer
Library and support for student
residences — went unmet, Sloan
called the project "enormously
successful by any measure."
Kennedy's enthusiasm and
knowledge of the University made
him a "very effective fund-raiser,"
Bennett said.
"He's mentally very quick and
he can pick up on somebody's sig
nals when they don't like a partic
ular idea," Bennett said. "He's
quick to reach back into his head
and say, 'Forget about that [idea],
how about this?' "
Hill agreed that Kennedy's
"dynamic personality" and fund
raising ability were his greatest
strengths.
"When Donald Kennedy is in a
room, you cannot ignore him —
and that's important," he said.
The Centennial Celebra
tion did more than just
raise funds for the Uni
versity's expansion. The
four celebrations held overseas —
in London, Mexico City, Toronto
and Hong Kong — were testa
ments to Stanford's growing
international presence.
"Education for this new world
begins with international educa
tion," Kennedy told alumni at the
third international event, held in
Toronto in March 1990. He out
lined plans to increase the repre
sentation of international stu
dents at Stanford and expand
overseas campuses.
Until the mid- to late-'Bos,
Stanford's overseas centers were
highly Eurocentric and somewhat
isolationist — "they were really
enclaves of American students
and American faculty and they
did not have a lot of interaction,"
Kennedy said.
But the 1989 opening of the
Stanford Japan Center in Kyoto
and the 1990 debut of the center
in Santiago, Chile broke this
mold.
With Kennedy's support and
enthusiasm — in 1986 he told
Japanese reporters that Stanford
will be "looking westward for. its
second hundred years" — the
Japan Center, consisting of the
Stanford Center for Technology
and Innovation and the Kyoto
Program in Japanese Studies,
established the University as a
permanent entity in Asia.
"It is hard to say, but I think
that the overseas campuses con
tribute more to Stanford's aca
demic prestige than they used to,"
Kennedy said. "In Oxford, Paris,
Kyoto, Berlin, there are tighter
relationships between the Stan
ford overseas campuses and local
academics. They tend much more
to be centers of political economy
than high culture, which helps
the quality of the academic inter
action."
In Kyoto, for instance, Stan
ford researchers conduct joint pro
jects with Japanese economists
and scientists.
The Santiago campus provides
Stanford an entry point into anoth
er global region — one that is just
beginning to burgeon academically,
according to Kodolfo Stavenhagen,
a visiting professor with the Insti
tute for International Studies.
"After a decade of dark ages,"
many Latin American countries
are returning to civilian govern
ments, Stavenhagen said. "There

are improved possibilities of
expanding academic institutions
there, and [Latin American schol
ars] need full support of their col
leagues in the United States."
Stanford's program in Latin
American Studies has gained in
prominence over the past few
years and is one of the best in the
United States, Stavenhagen said.
While each program
and overseas campus
is an end in itself,
Kennedy also sees
them as means to a greater goal —
answering the challenge issued by
former U.S. Secretary of State
and Hoover Distinguished Fellow
George Shultz to become a "world
university."
Shultz, who has attracted
countless world leaders to campus
in the years since his return, has
been credited — perhaps even
more than Kennedy — with
putting Stanford on the map.
With extensive international
contacts and a stately presence that
commands respect, Shultz played a
leading role in the creation of the
Institute for International Studies,
an umbrella organization that
coordinates Stanford's many inter
national efforts and creates links
among academic, business and pol
icy-making groups.
"George has set the right target
out there," Kennedy said. "Some
body has got to be the first world
university — why not you? And I
think that the lIS gives us the
right organizational structure."
The institute, which was estab
lished in 1989, boasts an advisory
council of well-known world lead
ers, including former Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias; Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney;
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley; and
Yotaro Kobayashi, chair and CEO
of Fuji Xerox.

Law Prof. Tom Heller, director
of Overseas Studies and deputy
director of the institute, said its
main role is "coming up with
mechanisms that allow Stanford's
research capacities to be merged
with people in business and gov
ernment who are in positions to
introduce some of these ideas into
the flow of policy making."
And History Prof. Norman
Naimark, director of the Center
for Russian and East European
Studies, agreed. lIS encourages
Stanford scholars to work "closely
with the academic communities"
in Eastern Europe, Naimark said.
"They desperately need help —
their infrastructure is falling
apart. They need concrete help."
It is in these metamorphosiz
ing Eastern European com
munities that Stanford and
Hoover scholars have had the
most high-profile influence in the
past few years.
Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin both consulted
Hoover scholars on economic poli

cy, and the think tank rose to
great international prominence in
the wake of the Soviet coup last
summer.
"Hoover is enormously well
known, its archive, its collection
activities, its curatorial work, and
in many places its academic stud
ies are very well-known and
respected," Kennedy said.
"I remember when George
Shultz, as secretary of state, first
met Gorbachev in Moscow," Hill
said. "Gorbachev held in his hand a
copy of ("New Ideas for the '80s,")
a Hoover book, and said, 'I know all
about you and your ideas.' "
The two campus visits by Gor
bachev in the past three years
made headlines nationwide, and
reflect the increased international
prominence the University and
Hoover have attained.
"By coming here, Gorbachev
gave Hoover and Stanford pres
tige," Hill said. But more impor
tantly, "Their prestige led Gor
bachev to come here."
In addition to expansion inter
nationally, strengthening the
humanities at home was
another University initiative
in the '80s.
"The humanities at Stanford
are stronger than they've ever
been," said English Prof. Herbert
Lindenberger, interim director of
the Humanities Center.
The center, which was one of
Kennedy's first initiatives, offers
one-year fellowships to humanities
faculty from Stanford and else
where so they can conduct research.
As the first university-based
research center in the country, it
was the first in a string of additions
to Stanford's humanities program.
During the last 12 years,
majors in Feminist Studies and
Symbolic Systems have been
added. Interdisciplinary programs
in Jewish Studies, the History of
Science, Medieval Studies and
other areas have been founded or
expanded. Continuing Studies,
which offers courses to faculty,

was also started.
On the science side, Earth Sys
tems, a new interdisciplinary
major approved this year,
approaches environmental studies

well as public policy.
Through the Centennial Cam

and Sciences. Another $11.3 mil
lion was raised for interdisci
plinary programs.
Other projects, including the
Center for Chicano Research and
the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers
Project, further contributed to the
elevation of the humanities.
"The improvement in Stan
ford's humanities can be seen in
our rise to the top of the rankings
in the departments of History,
English, Linguistics and other
areas," said Ewart Thomas, dean
of Humanities and Sciences, cit
ing Stanford's high rankings in a

Stanford has also topped the
magazine's rankings of under
graduate programs several times

eradicate the long-lasting
improvements made possible by
the Centennial Campaign, orga
nizers say. The funds raised by
the campaign were primarily slat
ed for long-term projects such as
science facilities, professorships,
strengthening the humanities
and improving undergraduate
education.
Kennedy's flair for fund rais
ing was central to the campaign,
according to University officials.
"The Centennial Campaign
was made easier, was made possi
ble, because Don is the kind of per
son he is," said Richard Bennett,
associate campaign director. "He
thought about it early on — way
back in '82 he was thinking about
the objectives of the campaign like
support for undergraduates, the
humanities, the faculty and sci
ence buildings. He had vision."
"Not only was he a good articu
lator of the vision but he was will
ing and able to go out and ask for
large sums of money in a very per
suasive, compelling, professional
way," said Sloan. "I think it's rare
to find both those abilities resi
dent in one person."

Although some goals of the
campaign — like the $180 million
Near West Campus plan for sci
ence buildings, funding for Meyer
Library and support for student
residences — went unmet, Sloan
called the project "enormously
successful by any measure."
Kennedy's enthusiasm and
knowledge of the University made
him a "very effective fund-raiser,"
Bennett said.
"He's mentally very quick and
he can pick up on somebody's sig
nals when they don't like a partic
ular idea," Bennett said. "He's
quick to reach back into his head
and say, 'Forget about that [idea],
how about this?' "
Hill agreed that Kennedy's
"dynamic personality" and fund
raising ability were his greatest
strengths.
"When Donald Kennedy is in a
room, you cannot ignore him —
and that's important," he said.
The Centennial Celebra
tion did more than just
raise funds for the Uni
versity's expansion. The
four celebrations held overseas —
in London, Mexico City, Toronto
and Hong Kong — were testa
ments to Stanford's growing
international presence.
"Education for this new world
begins with international educa
tion," Kennedy told alumni at the
third international event, held in
Toronto in March 1990. He out
lined plans to increase the repre
sentation of international stu
dents at Stanford and expand
overseas campuses.
Until the mid- to late-'Bos,
Stanford's overseas centers were
highly Eurocentric and somewhat
isolationist — "they were really
enclaves of American students
and American faculty and they
did not have a lot of interaction,"
Kennedy said.
But the 1989 opening of the
Stanford Japan Center in Kyoto
and the 1990 debut of the center
in Santiago, Chile broke this
mold.
With Kennedy's support and
enthusiasm — in 1986 he told
Japanese reporters that Stanford
will be "looking westward for. its
second hundred years" — the
Japan Center, consisting of the
Stanford Center for Technology
and Innovation and the Kyoto
Program in Japanese Studies,
established the University as a
permanent entity in Asia.
"It is hard to say, but I think
that the overseas campuses con
tribute more to Stanford's aca
demic prestige than they used to,"
Kennedy said. "In Oxford, Paris,
Kyoto, Berlin, there are tighter
relationships between the Stan
ford overseas campuses and local
academics. They tend much more
to be centers of political economy
than high culture, which helps
the quality of the academic inter
action."
In Kyoto, for instance, Stan
ford researchers conduct joint pro
jects with Japanese economists
and scientists.
The Santiago campus provides
Stanford an entry point into anoth
er global region — one that is just
beginning to burgeon academically,
according to Kodolfo Stavenhagen,
a visiting professor with the Insti
tute for International Studies.
"After a decade of dark ages,"
many Latin American countries
are returning to civilian govern
ments, Stavenhagen said. "There

are improved possibilities of
expanding academic institutions
there, and [Latin American schol
ars] need full support of their col
leagues in the United States."
Stanford's program in Latin
American Studies has gained in
prominence over the past few
years and is one of the best in the
United States, Stavenhagen said.
While each program
and overseas campus
is an end in itself,
Kennedy also sees
them as means to a greater goal —
answering the challenge issued by
former U.S. Secretary of State
and Hoover Distinguished Fellow
George Shultz to become a "world
university."
Shultz, who has attracted
countless world leaders to campus
in the years since his return, has
been credited — perhaps even
more than Kennedy — with
putting Stanford on the map.
With extensive international
contacts and a stately presence that
commands respect, Shultz played a
leading role in the creation of the
Institute for International Studies,
an umbrella organization that
coordinates Stanford's many inter
national efforts and creates links
among academic, business and pol
icy-making groups.
"George has set the right target
out there," Kennedy said. "Some
body has got to be the first world
university — why not you? And I
think that the lIS gives us the
right organizational structure."
The institute, which was estab
lished in 1989, boasts an advisory
council of well-known world lead
ers, including former Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias; Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney;
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley; and
Yotaro Kobayashi, chair and CEO
of Fuji Xerox.

Law Prof. Tom Heller, director
of Overseas Studies and deputy
director of the institute, said its
main role is "coming up with
mechanisms that allow Stanford's
research capacities to be merged
with people in business and gov
ernment who are in positions to
introduce some of these ideas into
the flow of policy making."
And History Prof. Norman
Naimark, director of the Center
for Russian and East European
Studies, agreed. lIS encourages
Stanford scholars to work "closely
with the academic communities"
in Eastern Europe, Naimark said.
"They desperately need help —
their infrastructure is falling
apart. They need concrete help."
It is in these metamorphosiz
ing Eastern European com
munities that Stanford and
Hoover scholars have had the
most high-profile influence in the
past few years.
Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin both consulted
Hoover scholars on economic poli

cy, and the think tank rose to
great international prominence in
the wake of the Soviet coup last
summer.
"Hoover is enormously well
known, its archive, its collection
activities, its curatorial work, and
in many places its academic stud
ies are very well-known and
respected," Kennedy said.
"I remember when George
Shultz, as secretary of state, first
met Gorbachev in Moscow," Hill
said. "Gorbachev held in his hand a
copy of ("New Ideas for the '80s,")
a Hoover book, and said, 'I know all
about you and your ideas.' "
The two campus visits by Gor
bachev in the past three years
made headlines nationwide, and
reflect the increased international
prominence the University and
Hoover have attained.
"By coming here, Gorbachev
gave Hoover and Stanford pres
tige," Hill said. But more impor
tantly, "Their prestige led Gor
bachev to come here."
In addition to expansion inter
nationally, strengthening the
humanities at home was
another University initiative
in the '80s.
"The humanities at Stanford
are stronger than they've ever
been," said English Prof. Herbert
Lindenberger, interim director of
the Humanities Center.
The center, which was one of
Kennedy's first initiatives, offers
one-year fellowships to humanities
faculty from Stanford and else
where so they can conduct research.
As the first university-based
research center in the country, it
was the first in a string of additions
to Stanford's humanities program.
During the last 12 years,
majors in Feminist Studies and
Symbolic Systems have been
added. Interdisciplinary programs
in Jewish Studies, the History of
Science, Medieval Studies and
other areas have been founded or
expanded. Continuing Studies,
which offers courses to faculty,
staff and community members,
was also started.
On the science side, Earth Sys
tems, a new interdisciplinary
major approved this year,
approaches environmental studies
from several directions, providing
students with a solid grounding in
physical and biological sciences, as
well as public policy.
Through the Centennial Cam
paign, 37 chairs and $7.7 million
in graduate fellowships were
added to the school of Humanities
and Sciences. Another $11.3 mil
lion was raised for interdisci
plinary programs.
Other projects, including the
Center for Chicano Research and
the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers
Project, further contributed to the
elevation of the humanities.
"The improvement in Stan
ford's humanities can be seen in
our rise to the top of the rankings
in the departments of History,
English, Linguistics and other
areas," said Ewart Thomas, dean
of Humanities and Sciences, cit
ing Stanford's high rankings in a
recent U.S. News and World
Report article on the nation's top
graduate programs.
Stanford has also topped the
magazine's rankings of under
graduate programs several times
in recent years.
"This handful of programs is a
sample that proves that there has
been a dramatic improvement in
outsiders' perception of our human
ities departments," Thomas said.
Several faculty members
praised Kennedy's work on behalf

of the humanities.
"Kennedy was instrumental in
pushing Jewish Studies forward,"
said Arnold Eisen, director of the
program. "It was another step in
making Stanford more cosmopoli
tan and more multicultural,
something [Kennedy] supports
very much."
English Prof. Diane Middle
brook, a former fellow at the cen
ter who is also actively involved in
the Feminist Studies program,
praised Kennedy's support of
interdisciplinary programs.
"Kennedy's model of Human
Biology led to the development of
other interdisciplinary pro
grams," Middlebrook said.
But History Prof. Clay Carson,
director of the King Papers Pro
ject, said that while Kennedy
played an "important role" in
helping to establish the project,
more work is still needed to
strengthen the humanities at
Stanford.
"I would have hoped more
could have been done," said Car
son. "[Kennedy] was sincere in
his belief that the humanities
should be of equal strength com
pared to say, engineering, in
terms of national prestige. But I
don't know if his desire to do that
has really affected policies."
Carson called the departments
of History and Afro-American

Studies "undersized."
"I have to question, relative to
the other large components of the
University: has there been a seri
ous allocation of resources?" Car
son said.
Hill echoed Carson's senti
ments.
"I think that there can be more
attention paid to humanities as a
whole and its stature within the
University," he said.
Kennedy, although he cites
"strengthening of the humanities
departments" as a major accom
plishment during his time here,
recognizes some of the faculty dis
content.
The humanities, he said, "are
better at Stanford, but there is
still a sense on the part of the
humanities faculty that there is a
disparity here that favors the sci
ences."
In addition to the expansion of
academic programs, Kennedy's
tenure as president was marked
by the creation of major new
facilities and a doubling of the Uni
versity's physical plant value.
At the Medical School, several
large construction projects were
begun in the '80s, including the
Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal and the Beckman Center for

Molecular and Genetic Medicine.
In addition, the Hospital Mod
ernization Project refurbished
Stanford Hospital at a cost of
more than $150 million.
Several large student residence
complexes were also completed,
including Governor's Corner,
Sterling Quad, the Suites, Rains
Houses, Kimball Hall and Man
zanita 11. Two other undergradu
ate residences are planned, which
will be located on the Knoll and
are schedule to open in 1994.
Nearly 2,000 spaces have been
added to University housing dur
ing Kennedy's tenure, allowing
the University to deliver on its
long-delayed pledge to provide
four years of guaranteed housing
for all undergraduates. The
pledge will begin with next year's
freshmen.
Other projects included the
construction of the Tennis Stadi
um, the Ford Center, Sweet Hall,
Littlefield Center at the Business
School, the Center for Integrated
Systems and Braun Music Cen
ter. The Rodin Sculpture Garden
was installed and the Red Barn
was restored.
But "Near West Campus,"
Stanford's most ambitious build
ing project, was repeatedly down
scaled and delayed.
In the early '80s, Kennedy,
lamenting nearly 20 years of
"capital starvation" of American
universities after the federal gov
ernment stopped financing the
construction of research facilities,

called for "the transformation of
the shantytown west of the Quad
into a real Stanford center for sci
ence and engineering."
The $250 million, 41-acre
transformation, which became
known as the Near West Campus
project, aimed to construct four
major research facilities, refur
bish old labs and expand several
existing buildings. But after the
1989 earthquake, that figure was
downsized to $180 million and
then $140 million, as funds were
diverted for earthquake repairs.
Kennedy called the problems
with Near West "disappointing."
In addition to the earthquake,
impending cuts in the indirect
cost rate also limited the project,
Kennedy said.
By the end of the Centennial
Campaign, only $90 million and
two buildings — the Gilbert Biol
ogy Center and the Keck Science
Building — had been raised.
Green Earth Sciences Building is
currently under construction, but
the Advanced Materials Research
Building has been considerably
downsized and remains on the
drawing board.
Despite the disappointments of
Near West, former Provost James
Rosse said he believes Stanford
will be "reasonably well-endowed
in facilities for a long time."
"If federal support policies for
research had continued, I would
have been very unhappy about
not being able to carry [Near
West] out," said Rosse.
"But given the changes, I am
glad we were able to get it stopped
in time before the University
faced even bigger financial diffi
culties."

Long-time Stanford donor Cecil Green breaks ground in October for
the Green Earth Sciences Building, as University President Donald
Kennedy looks on.
Physically, financially, aca
demically and interna
tionally, the Kennedy
years were ones of growth
and expansion for Stanford.
Since University President
Donald Kennedy took over in
1980, the construction of such
state-of-the-art facilities as the
Center for Integrated Systems
have paved the way for innova
tive academic programs, which
in turn increased Stanford's
prestige both nationally and
internationally.
"There's no doubt that in the
last 10 or 12 years Stanford has
gone from being a top American
university to being one of the
greatest universities in the
world," said Charles Hill, a
senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution.
While the seeds for much of
this expansion were planted in
the '60s and '70s, Kennedy
helped bring them to fruition.
"Kennedy always had a vision
of what the University could
be," said Herbert Lindenberger,
interim director of the Humani
ties Center. "Although often

that vision was controversial,
you couldn't deny that he had
vision."
And Elizabeth Sloan, director
of communications in the Office
of Development, agreed.
"Don took a central role from
the beginning, articulating the
vision of Stanford and then help
ing us to refine the vision into
development objectives," she
said.
Despite recent budget
cuts, the 1980s were a
period of substantial
economic growth for
Stanford.

$60 million to over $180 million.
Research volume has expanded
from $114 million to $295 million,
and both the operating and non
operating < budgets have grown at
least 5 percent annually.
But perhaps the most impres
sive measure of Stanford's fiscal
health under Kennedy was the
Centennial Campaign — called by
many the most successful fund
raising endeavor ever undertaken
in the history of higher education.
Between 1987 and 1992, Stanford
raised about $1,269 billion for
everything from new equipment
and buildings to endowed profes
sorships and student financial aid.

Despite the success of the Cen
tennial Campaign, the University
found itself with a $43 million
deficit last year, largely as a result
of the federal government's deci
sion to cut Stanford's indirect
cost rate from 72 to 55.5 percent.
Other contributing factors
were a slower-than-projected
growth in sponsored research
activity and lower yields on
""investments.
But the budget cuts will not
eradicate the long-lasting
improvements made possible by
the Centennial Campaign, orga
nizers say. The funds raised by
the campaign were primarily slat
ed for long-term projects such as
science facilities, professorships,
strengthening the humanities
and improving undergraduate
education.
Kennedy's flair for fund rais

according to University officials.
"The Centennial Campaign

and the 1990 debut of the center
in Santiago, Chile broke this
mold.
With Kennedy's support and
enthusiasm — in 1986 he told
Japanese reporters that Stanford

said. "Gorbachev held in his hand a

The two campus visits by Gor
bachev in the past three years
made headlines nationwide, and
reflect the increased international
prominence the University and
Hoover have attained.
"By coming here, Gorbachev
gave Hoover and Stanford pres

ter. The Rodin Sculpture Garden
was installed and the Red Barn
was restored.
But "Near West Campus,"
Stanford's most ambitious build
ing project, was repeatedly down
scaled and delayed.
In the early '80s, Kennedy,
lamenting nearly 20 years of
"capital starvation" of American
universities after the federal gov
ernment stopped financing the
construction of research facilities,

called for "the transformation of
the shantytown west of the Quad
into a real Stanford center for sci
ence and engineering."
The $250 million, 41-acre
transformation, which became
known as the Near West Campus
project, aimed to construct four
major research facilities, refur
bish old labs and expand several
existing buildings. But after the
1989 earthquake, that figure was
downsized to $180 million and
then $140 million, as funds were
diverted for earthquake repairs.
Kennedy called the problems
with Near West "disappointing."
In addition to the earthquake,
impending cuts in the indirect
cost rate also limited the project,
Kennedy said.
By the end of the Centennial
Campaign, only $90 million and
two buildings — the Gilbert Biol
ogy Center and the Keck Science
Building — had been raised.
Green Earth Sciences Building is
currently under construction, but
the Advanced Materials Research
Building has been considerably
downsized and remains on the
drawing board.
Despite the disappointments of
Near West, former Provost James
Rosse said he believes Stanford
will be "reasonably well-endowed
in facilities for a long time."
"If federal support policies for
research had continued, I would
have been very unhappy about
not being able to carry [Near
West] out," said Rosse.
"But given the changes, I am
glad we were able to get it stopped
in time before the University
faced even bigger financial diffi
culties."

Long-time Stanford donor Cecil Green breaks ground in October for
the Green Earth Sciences Building, as University President Donald
Kennedy looks on.
Physically, financially, aca
demically and interna
tionally, the Kennedy
years were ones of growth
and expansion for Stanford.
Since University President
Donald Kennedy took over in
1980, the construction of such
state-of-the-art facilities as the
Center for Integrated Systems
have paved the way for innova
tive academic programs, which
in turn increased Stanford's
prestige both nationally and
internationally.
"There's no doubt that in the
last 10 or 12 years Stanford has
gone from being a top American
university to being one of the
greatest universities in the
world," said Charles Hill, a
senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution.
While the seeds for much of
this expansion were planted in
the '60s and '70s, Kennedy
helped bring them to fruition.
"Kennedy always had a vision
of what the University could
be," said Herbert Lindenberger,
interim director of the Humani
ties Center. "Although often

that vision was controversial,
you couldn't deny that he had
vision."
And Elizabeth Sloan, director
of communications in the Office
of Development, agreed.
"Don took a central role from
the beginning, articulating the
vision of Stanford and then help
ing us to refine the vision into
development objectives," she
said.
Despite recent budget
cuts, the 1980s were a
period of substantial
economic growth for
Stanford.
Over the last 12 years, Stan
ford's endowment nearly quadru

During Donald Kennedy's tenure as University president, Stanford has seen unprecedented growth
and expansion. "Stanford has gone from being a top American university to being one of the great

$60 million to over $180 million.
Research volume has expanded
from $114 million to $295 million,
and both the operating and non
operating < budgets have grown at
least 5 percent annually.
But perhaps the most impres
sive measure of Stanford's fiscal
health under Kennedy was the
Centennial Campaign — called by
many the most successful fund
raising endeavor ever undertaken
in the history of higher education.
Between 1987 and 1992, Stanford
raised about $1,269 billion for
everything from new equipment
and buildings to endowed profes
sorships and student financial aid.

Despite the success of the Cen
tennial Campaign, the University
found itself with a $43 million
deficit last year, largely as a result
of the federal government's deci
sion to cut Stanford's indirect
cost rate from 72 to 55.5 percent.
Other contributing factors
were a slower-than-projected
growth in sponsored research
activity and lower yields on
""investments.
But the budget cuts will not
eradicate the long-lasting
improvements made possible by
the Centennial Campaign, orga
nizers say. The funds raised by
the campaign were primarily slat
ed for long-term projects such as
science facilities, professorships,
strengthening the humanities
and improving undergraduate
education.
Kennedy's flair for fund rais
ing was central to the campaign,
according to University officials.
"The Centennial Campaign
was made easier, was made possi
ble, because Don is the kind of per
son he is," said Richard Bennett,
associate campaign director. "He
thought about it early on — way
back in '82 he was thinking about
the objectives of the campaign like
support for undergraduates, the
humanities, the faculty and sci
ence buildings. He had vision."
"Not only was he a good articu
lator of the vision but he was will
ing and able to go out and ask for
large sums of money in a very per
suasive, compelling, professional
way," said Sloan. "I think it's rare
to find both those abilities resi
dent in one person."

Although some goals of the
campaign — like the $180 million
Near West Campus plan for sci
ence buildings, funding for Meyer
Library and support for student
residences — went unmet, Sloan
called the project "enormously
successful by any measure."
Kennedy's enthusiasm and
knowledge of the University made
him a "very effective fund-raiser,"
Bennett said.
"He's mentally very quick and
he can pick up on somebody's sig
nals when they don't like a partic
ular idea," Bennett said. "He's
quick to reach back into his head
and say, 'Forget about that [idea],
how about this?' "
Hill agreed that Kennedy's
"dynamic personality" and fund
raising ability were his greatest
strengths.
"When Donald Kennedy is in a
room, you cannot ignore him —
and that's important," he said.
The Centennial Celebra
tion did more than just
raise funds for the Uni
versity's expansion. The
four celebrations held overseas —
in London, Mexico City, Toronto
and Hong Kong — were testa
ments to Stanford's growing
international presence.
"Education for this new world
begins with international educa
tion," Kennedy told alumni at the
third international event, held in
Toronto in March 1990. He out
lined plans to increase the repre
sentation of international stu
dents at Stanford and expand
overseas campuses.
Until the mid- to late-'Bos,
Stanford's overseas centers were
highly Eurocentric and somewhat
isolationist — "they were really
enclaves of American students
and American faculty and they
did not have a lot of interaction,"
Kennedy said.
But the 1989 opening of the
Stanford Japan Center in Kyoto
and the 1990 debut of the center
in Santiago, Chile broke this
mold.
With Kennedy's support and
enthusiasm — in 1986 he told
Japanese reporters that Stanford
will be "looking westward for. its
second hundred years" — the
Japan Center, consisting of the
Stanford Center for Technology
and Innovation and the Kyoto
Program in Japanese Studies,
established the University as a
permanent entity in Asia.
"It is hard to say, but I think
that the overseas campuses con
tribute more to Stanford's aca
demic prestige than they used to,"
Kennedy said. "In Oxford, Paris,
Kyoto, Berlin, there are tighter
relationships between the Stan
ford overseas campuses and local
academics. They tend much more
to be centers of political economy
than high culture, which helps
the quality of the academic inter
action."
In Kyoto, for instance, Stan
ford researchers conduct joint pro
jects with Japanese economists
and scientists.
The Santiago campus provides
Stanford an entry point into anoth
er global region — one that is just
beginning to burgeon academically,
according to Kodolfo Stavenhagen,
a visiting professor with the Insti
tute for International Studies.
"After a decade of dark ages,"
many Latin American countries
are returning to civilian govern
ments, Stavenhagen said. "There

are improved possibilities of
expanding academic institutions
there, and [Latin American schol
ars] need full support of their col
leagues in the United States."
Stanford's program in Latin
American Studies has gained in
prominence over the past few
years and is one of the best in the
United States, Stavenhagen said.
While each program
and overseas campus
is an end in itself,
Kennedy also sees
them as means to a greater goal —
answering the challenge issued by
former U.S. Secretary of State
and Hoover Distinguished Fellow
George Shultz to become a "world
university."
Shultz, who has attracted
countless world leaders to campus
in the years since his return, has
been credited — perhaps even
more than Kennedy — with
putting Stanford on the map.
With extensive international
contacts and a stately presence that
commands respect, Shultz played a
leading role in the creation of the
Institute for International Studies,
an umbrella organization that
coordinates Stanford's many inter
national efforts and creates links
among academic, business and pol
icy-making groups.
"George has set the right target
out there," Kennedy said. "Some
body has got to be the first world
university — why not you? And I
think that the lIS gives us the
right organizational structure."
The institute, which was estab
lished in 1989, boasts an advisory
council of well-known world lead
ers, including former Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias; Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney;
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley; and
Yotaro Kobayashi, chair and CEO
of Fuji Xerox.

Law Prof. Tom Heller, director
of Overseas Studies and deputy
director of the institute, said its
main role is "coming up with
mechanisms that allow Stanford's
research capacities to be merged
with people in business and gov
ernment who are in positions to
introduce some of these ideas into
the flow of policy making."
And History Prof. Norman
Naimark, director of the Center
for Russian and East European
Studies, agreed. lIS encourages
Stanford scholars to work "closely
with the academic communities"
in Eastern Europe, Naimark said.
"They desperately need help —
their infrastructure is falling
apart. They need concrete help."
It is in these metamorphosiz
ing Eastern European com
munities that Stanford and
Hoover scholars have had the
most high-profile influence in the
past few years.
Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin both consulted
Hoover scholars on economic poli

cy, and the think tank rose to
great international prominence in
the wake of the Soviet coup last
summer.
"Hoover is enormously well
known, its archive, its collection
activities, its curatorial work, and
in many places its academic stud
ies are very well-known and
respected," Kennedy said.
"I remember when George
Shultz, as secretary of state, first
met Gorbachev in Moscow," Hill
said. "Gorbachev held in his hand a
copy of ("New Ideas for the '80s,")
a Hoover book, and said, 'I know all
about you and your ideas.' "
The two campus visits by Gor
bachev in the past three years
made headlines nationwide, and
reflect the increased international
prominence the University and
Hoover have attained.
"By coming here, Gorbachev
gave Hoover and Stanford pres
tige," Hill said. But more impor
tantly, "Their prestige led Gor
bachev to come here."
In addition to expansion inter
nationally, strengthening the
humanities at home was
another University initiative
in the '80s.
"The humanities at Stanford
are stronger than they've ever
been," said English Prof. Herbert
Lindenberger, interim director of
the Humanities Center.
The center, which was one of
Kennedy's first initiatives, offers
one-year fellowships to humanities
faculty from Stanford and else
where so they can conduct research.
As the first university-based
research center in the country, it
was the first in a string of additions
to Stanford's humanities program.
During the last 12 years,
majors in Feminist Studies and
Symbolic Systems have been
added. Interdisciplinary programs
in Jewish Studies, the History of
Science, Medieval Studies and
other areas have been founded or
expanded. Continuing Studies,
which offers courses to faculty,
staff and community members,
was also started.
On the science side, Earth Sys
tems, a new interdisciplinary
major approved this year,
approaches environmental studies
from several directions, providing
students with a solid grounding in
physical and biological sciences, as
well as public policy.
Through the Centennial Cam
paign, 37 chairs and $7.7 million
in graduate fellowships were
added to the school of Humanities
and Sciences. Another $11.3 mil
lion was raised for interdisci
plinary programs.
Other projects, including the
Center for Chicano Research and
the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers
Project, further contributed to the
elevation of the humanities.
"The improvement in Stan
ford's humanities can be seen in
our rise to the top of the rankings
in the departments of History,
English, Linguistics and other
areas," said Ewart Thomas, dean
of Humanities and Sciences, cit
ing Stanford's high rankings in a
recent U.S. News and World
Report article on the nation's top
graduate programs.
Stanford has also topped the
magazine's rankings of under
graduate programs several times
in recent years.
"This handful of programs is a
sample that proves that there has
been a dramatic improvement in
outsiders' perception of our human
ities departments," Thomas said.
Several faculty members
praised Kennedy's work on behalf

of the humanities.
"Kennedy was instrumental in
pushing Jewish Studies forward,"
said Arnold Eisen, director of the
program. "It was another step in
making Stanford more cosmopoli
tan and more multicultural,
something [Kennedy] supports
very much."
English Prof. Diane Middle
brook, a former fellow at the cen
ter who is also actively involved in
the Feminist Studies program,
praised Kennedy's support of
interdisciplinary programs.
"Kennedy's model of Human
Biology led to the development of
other interdisciplinary pro
grams," Middlebrook said.
But History Prof. Clay Carson,
director of the King Papers Pro
ject, said that while Kennedy
played an "important role" in
helping to establish the project,
more work is still needed to
strengthen the humanities at
Stanford.
"I would have hoped more
could have been done," said Car
son. "[Kennedy] was sincere in
his belief that the humanities
should be of equal strength com
pared to say, engineering, in
terms of national prestige. But I
don't know if his desire to do that
has really affected policies."
Carson called the departments
of History and Afro-American

Studies "undersized."
"I have to question, relative to
the other large components of the
University: has there been a seri
ous allocation of resources?" Car
son said.
Hill echoed Carson's senti
ments.
"I think that there can be more
attention paid to humanities as a
whole and its stature within the
University," he said.
Kennedy, although he cites
"strengthening of the humanities
departments" as a major accom
plishment during his time here,
recognizes some of the faculty dis
content.
The humanities, he said, "are
better at Stanford, but there is
still a sense on the part of the
humanities faculty that there is a
disparity here that favors the sci
ences."
In addition to the expansion of
academic programs, Kennedy's
tenure as president was marked
by the creation of major new
facilities and a doubling of the Uni
versity's physical plant value.
At the Medical School, several
large construction projects were
begun in the '80s, including the
Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal and the Beckman Center for
