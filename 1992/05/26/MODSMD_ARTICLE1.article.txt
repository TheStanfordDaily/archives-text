Physically, financially, aca
demically and interna
tionally, the Kennedy
years were ones of growth
and expansion for Stanford.

Donald Kennedy took over in
1980, the construction of such
state-of-the-art facilities as the
Center for Integrated Systems
have paved the way for innova

prestige both nationally and
internationally.
"There's no doubt that in the
last 10 or 12 years Stanford has
gone from being a top American
university to being one of the
greatest universities in the
world," said Charles Hill, a
senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution.
While the seeds for much of
this expansion were planted in
the '60s and '70s, Kennedy
helped bring them to fruition.
"Kennedy always had a vision
of what the University could
be," said Herbert Lindenberger,
interim director of the Humani
ties Center. "Although often

that vision was controversial,
you couldn't deny that he had
vision."
And Elizabeth Sloan, director
of communications in the Office
of Development, agreed.
"Don took a central role from
the beginning, articulating the
vision of Stanford and then help
ing us to refine the vision into
development objectives," she
said.
Despite recent budget
cuts, the 1980s were a
period of substantial
economic growth for
Stanford.
