Cutting campus's slim
links with ROTC won't
send any message now

IN THE EARLY 19705, Stanford
protestors pushed the ROTC off
campus. As the campus embodi
ment of the US. government's inter
vention in southeast Asia, the
Reserve Officers' Training Corps
was a close and easy target for
demonstrations against America's
war in Vietnam. Under intense pres
sure, the ROTC was forced to leave.
Today, campuses across the Unit
ed States are again dissociating
themselves from the ROTC. This
time, the issue is anti-gay discrimi
nation within the U.S. military.
Stanford, though, has already
played that trump card. When the
ROTC's headquarters disappeared,
so did Stanford's willingness to tol
erate ROTC classes on campus.
Since then, the dozens of Stan
ford students who each year
receive ROTC scholarships must
commute to UC-Berkeley or Santa
Clara University to complete their
military requirements.
Still, when University President
Donald Kennedy signed an American
Civil Liberties Union petition earlier
this month criticizing the military
and the ROTC for banning gays and
lesbians, a debate on the ROTC's
role on campus was rekindled.
The U.S. military explicitly bans
homosexuals from entering the mili
tary, and routinely expels gay and les
bian soldiers who are "discovered."
Kennedy signed the petition as
"an individual," and there was no
mention of Stanford's particular
situation — that the ROTC was
already kicked off campus.
Next fall, the Dean of Students'
Working Group on Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Students' Needs will
recommend, as "one of the major
points of discussion," what Stan
ford should do to combat the mili
tary's anti-gay policies.
Stanford's current ties to the

ROTC are tenuous, and severing
them would be a blunt method to
gain only marginal benefit.
About the only time you see
ROTC students on campus is when
they are doing their Remedial
Physical Training, military jargon
for jogging and calisthenics.
The University certainly would
not ban students from using
Wilbur field as they wish, so this is
a dead end.
The University might also rule
that no ROTC students can use a
University classroom after-hours
as an occasional meeting place.
But regulating which student
groups can and cannot meet in
open University facilities, even for
the important political point of
acting against the military's overt
discrimination, would reek of ideo
logical heavy-handedness.
Stanford might also consider
refusing to accept ROTC scholar
ships for students. But the idea of
preventing hard-working students
from attending Stanford to make a
symbolic jab at a bad Pentagon pol
icy is absurd, not to mention hypo
critical, given Stanford's heavy
reliance on federal research dollars.
The Pentagon's policy of discrim
ination is blunt: "Homosexuality is
incompatible with military service."
And the government's justifica
tions are varied.
• Gays and lesbians can't be
trusted with secrets, one argu
ment goes. Once a foreign agent
threatens to "out" Sergeant Sally
or Private Paul, fear of being
expelled from the military will
turn them into self-serving loose
cannons.
• "Fags" are too "girly" for com
bat, says another explanation.
America's national security is too
important to put on their backs.
• And finally, which restrooms
would they use? "Morale" would be
sapped by showering with gays,
some argue.
These hoaky cloaks for bigotry
should be attacked through public
pressure on elected officials and
the federal government — not the
ROTC students on campus.
