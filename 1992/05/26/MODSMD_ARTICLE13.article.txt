## Towards a resolution... 
### 
I CAME INTO this job of column writ
ing with many specific ideas and
beliefs in my head. But much has hap
pened over the course of fourteen weeks.
I feel like I know so little about the world.
I only know what I have experienced or been
exposed to. That is my reality. And thus
come the difficulties of others unfamiliar
with my background to understand me, and
sometimes for me to understand them.
They say that the one thing you know
is that you'll never know, and that every
thing changes. Just when you think you
do know something, something else hap
pens that turns it around.
But it's not even what you learn in
class or by being at Stanford that chal
lenges us so much as just talking to peo
ple. Or it's life. It's the tough moments.
Sometimes the world seems to blow up.
Like when I watched American Pictures
and heard children explain how they eat
dirt to keep from starving. Like when I
walked into St. Anthony's soup kitchen in
San Francisco's Tenderloin and passed an
endless line of men waiting to enter. Like
when I realized the condition of people's
lives in Los Angeles. In East Palo Alto. The
tremendous gulf between our realities.
I think about my brother. I didn't talk
to him for several weeks after our argu
ment about the role of the government
and homelessness. I thought, "How can I
still care about him when there is this
fundamental difference between us?"

Later I asked his fiancee if he was still
mad at me, and she told me he wasn't and
that he'd asked the same thing. When I
finally talked to him, it was all right. It
was silently understood that he was still
my brother and I was still his sister.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that
things just go on, despite our differences.
I still believe that there are many things
wrong in this world, but right now I'd
rather tackle the problems instead of the
people as adversaries.
I am sure that sometimes the two can't
be separated and a certain amount of
work must go into changing people's opin
ions and misperceptions. But, again, it's
not a simple matter of taking sides. And
yet I still catch myself doing it at times.
I showed my columns to a close friend
from out of town recently. It was difficult
to discover that we didn't believe in the
same things anymore. It has been a chal
lenge to reconcile with that knowledge
and to rethink my own beliefs.
I can't profess any truths. I can only
share my thoughts in this on-going pro
cess of life and try to do what I think is
good and right.
In this last column, I would like to
share this poem called "Resolution:"
How is it, my friend,/that we two foes
return to share/the same space, and/how
is it/that I by desire look fully/on your
face,/tasting the memories/without dark

ness and shudders,/without my
shelter/flying up like /startled birds at
your presence./ Three years have passed,
my/small self within,/the child I once
was, caught/in the moment of horror,
having/trusted/the outstretched hand of
you,/a man with pebbles/in his shoes.
I opened a hole/in the warm, dark silt of
my soul/for the seed/of desire/you offered
but never gave/except shells./ I've lived
here,/sheltered by the tenuous/flutter of
wings,/hiding from the fault,/the poten
tial eruption/of this world ./Only—
How could I grow/beneath the feather
sky, my friend,/my heart/matching/the
wings of birds/beating above my head./ I
released the child that I was/back into the
world with you/and you—/you from your
own silent wall/welcomed me/with bowed
head. I/saw the skitterish /flutter of wings
in your eyes, and/how I laugh! you/under
stood my tears/with pained lines at the
corners/of your mouth.
How is it, my friend,/that we are almost
like children again.

This is Jane's final column

you'll never
know.'
