## Women need more than a mere room of their own 
### 
CCT T ELLQ '" HE ADDRESSED me
I lin a tone one would use
J- JLtowards a little girl at a carni
val who just dropped her ice cream cone.
We converged right in the gully of a
small path covered with pits and danger
ously loose gravel.
He may have been perfectly harmless
a man, miles from anywhere, on a
walk looking for the same solitaiy and
rambling experience I was. But on the
path, he stopped and turned his body
towards me and his head tilted unnatu
rally to the left.
I headed off an hour earlier with
some water, my pen and journal to do
some mountain biking and writing on
the dusty, hot paths that wind between
the thistles and oaks.
When I got on the trail, my first
thought was, "This is so incredible." My
second thought was, "Oh God, I'm on
this isolated path alone ... a potential
victim."
I angrily dismissed this second
thought, telling myself to enjoy the

sheer pleasure of my surroundings. But
I encountered this man and ended up
writing along the side of a busy road.
The beautiful views of the foothills
and reservoirs are not to be appreciated
intimately by people like me — women.
A man on a mountain bike rode by me,
smiling from the inside out. I wonder if
he realizes that the solitude with which
he enjoyed his ride is a privilege?
I thought of Virginia Woolfs "A
Room of One's Own," when she wrote
about each woman needing her space to
write. But if women need rooms of their
own to write, they also need a world out
side to explore, to grow as writers and
human beings.
Unfortunately, I cannot step out of
my room without a heavy coat of trepi
dation that I, too, may become another
tragic stoiy that loving fathers tell their
daughters before they go away to college.
Women may be making progress in
many spheres, but any woman can be
made to feel powerless should she (heav
ens forbids!) be alone in an isolated area.

1 get so angry because I love being alone
in the outdoors, but 90 percent of the
times I make an attempt at achieving
solitude my plans are squelched by fear.
The other 10 percent of the time,
when my plans that are actually carried
out, they are tainted by a feeling that
someone is behind me or by fear of men
who approach me with their prying
questions about my age and name.
Unlike Thoreau, I cannot walk alone
in the woods for four hours a day. Solo
backpacking trips, bike rides, jogs past
dark, road trips — these have all been
vetoed because of the very real concern
for safety. This wall around my freedom
affects me in many tangible ways, as it
also shapes women's realities globally.
I hate to end on such a negative
indictment, so I'll pose the question:
What can we do? Men, if you see a
woman traveling alone, don't ask her
personal questions no matter how
benign they may seem. For some reason,
men think that a woman alone is an
open invitation to conversation.

If you see a woman being hassled by a
stranger, stick around until you've veri
fied that she is safe or, better yet, help
her out. Unfortunately, to a woman
alone, every man is a potential rapist. So
even though you have good intentions,
try to keep this in mind when approach
ing a woman whom you do not know.
Women, you know as well as I do that
fear of rape and harassment sucks. We
can't eliminate the fear, but we can
build up a good defense against it. Take
a self defense course to learn assertive
ness skills as well as physical self
defense.
Also, if a man is harassing you even
in the subtlest manner, tell him that his
questions or advances are making you
uncomfortable.
As to mountain biking alone, I don't
really have an answer. I use well-trafficked
trails for safety, but for now, my "road less
traveled" has a big, glaring detour sign
blocking it.
