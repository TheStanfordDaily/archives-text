# Letter on trips program misrepresents the facts
## 
### 
The letter in Friday's Daily in opposi
tion to the newly created First Year
Trips program egregiously misrepresent
ed the facts.
Most notable is the omission that, in
addition to running trips for incoming
students, the funds establish a year
round outdoor program. Beginning this
fall, the program will run camping, back
packing and climbing trips open to all
students.
The program will train instructors for
leading both first-year trips and outings
during the year, as well as support stu
dents with outdoors experience in taking
novices into the wilderness.
Equipment purchased by the program

will be available year round for use on
these outings.
The two-year pilot program involves
at least 500 students on first-year trips,
possibly hundreds more if the first year
runs smoothly.
In addition, there will be at least 100
volunteer instructors, and with a conser
vative goal of sending out one small out
ing of 10 every other weekend of the
quarter, that's another 400 students for
a total of 1,000.
This is two and a half times the num
ber put forth in the letter. And this is
the pilot program!
Each participant pays for his or her
own trip. Of course it doesn't cost
$272.02 per person to do public service.
A weekend public service trip will cost
about $40 for food, shelter and trans
portation.
A five-day outing to the High Sierra

will cost about $160. To attribute the
total funding to the first two years' par
ticipants is to ignore the costs and the
challenge of beginning a new program.
The $54,020 for salaries covers two
years of a half-time staff director (not a
student) at $17,000 per year (no bene
fits), one student during the academic
year for 10 hours/week and two during
the summer for 20 hours/week, with stu
dents receiving $8 per hour.
These are hardly "high-paying posi
tions" or "huge salaries." All instructors
will be volunteers.
The paid staff will teach instructors
enough to make trips safe, settle endless
logistical details with University offi
cials, scout trips, clean and repair gear,
arrange transportation and food, etc.
From our experience with the very
popular, all-volunteer Outdoor Educa
tion Program at Stanford, and in speak

ing with similar organizations at Dart
mouth, Princeton and UCSF, this is a
minimal staff for the job.
The ASSU contributions of $74,407
establish a First Year Trips and year
round outdoor program that has a
chance of growing and existing into the
future.
