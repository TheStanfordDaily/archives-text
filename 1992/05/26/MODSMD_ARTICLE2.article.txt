# Berlin conference marks growing international role
## European research center being planned 
### Scott McCormack Staff writer 
BERLIN — As a sign of what may be an
expanding role for overseas campuses,
more than 30 scholars from East and West
gathered for a symposium at the Stanford
Berlin Study Center on Saturday to grap
ple with the burgeoning problems of a post-
Cold War Europe.
The conference comes as Stanford's
Institute for International Studies consid
ers opening a new European research cen
ter in Berlin modeled after its Stanford
Japan Center based at Kyoto University.
The new center, which is still in the
early planning stages, would be the next
phase of the University's plans to "beef up

research" and expand its overseas links,
according to Nancy Okimoto, associate
director of the institute.
The conference — which was attended
by Americans and Europeans from
academia, government, business and the
media — was a natural outgrowth of that
effort, she added.
Law Prof. Thomar H»IW, deputy direr*
tor of the institute and director of Overseas
Studies, said the aim of Saturday's confer
ence was "to insert Stanford in Berlin as a
long-term actor into the intellectual and
political community" of Germany.
The new center in Berlin, Heller said,
"would use the same kinds of features as
Japan. Having a center like Kyoto that
combines . . . research and outreach would

make sense in Europe."
Since its opening in 1989, the Japan
Center has been a magnet for research and
academic exchange between Stanford and
Japanese scholars and businesses.
History Prof. Norman Naimark, direc
tor of the Center for Russian and Eastern
European Studies, said he welcomed the
plans to develop a European research cen

ter, and added that Berlin is "a particularly
good place" for its location.
"It's very close to Eastern Europe and
linked with what's going on there," he said.
Heller said the new center might not
necessarily be a direct part of the current
Berlin Study Center and that it would be a
"University-wide" program, not just Over
seas Studies.
According to Karen Kramer, director of
Stanford in Berlin, Saturday's conference
brought "together really articulate people
from the East who have reflected on and
experienced these problems first-hand with
analysts and specialists from Stanford who
have not experienced them, but have stud
ied them in-depth."
The conference, co-sponsored by Stan-


Stanford seeks to
be a 'long-term
actor' in the 'intel
lectual and politi
cal community' of
Germany.
