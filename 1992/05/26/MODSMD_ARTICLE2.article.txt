# Berlin conference marks growing international role
## European research center being planned 
### Scott McCormack Staff writer 
BERLIN — As a sign of what may be an
expanding role for overseas campuses,
more than 30 scholars from East and West
gathered for a symposium at the Stanford
Berlin Study Center on Saturday to grap
ple with the burgeoning problems of a post-
Cold War Europe.
The conference comes as Stanford's
Institute for International Studies consid
ers opening a new European research cen
ter in Berlin modeled after its Stanford
Japan Center based at Kyoto University.
The new center, which is still in the
early planning stages, would be the next
phase of the University's plans to "beef up

research" and expand its overseas links,
according to Nancy Okimoto, associate
director of the institute.
The conference — which was attended
by Americans and Europeans from
academia, government, business and the
media — was a natural outgrowth of that
effort, she added.
Law Prof. Thomar H»IW, deputy direr*
tor of the institute and director of Overseas
Studies, said the aim of Saturday's confer
ence was "to insert Stanford in Berlin as a
long-term actor into the intellectual and
political community" of Germany.
The new center in Berlin, Heller said,
"would use the same kinds of features as
Japan. Having a center like Kyoto that
combines . . . research and outreach would

make sense in Europe."
Since its opening in 1989, the Japan
Center has been a magnet for research and
academic exchange between Stanford and
Japanese scholars and businesses.
History Prof. Norman Naimark, direc
tor of the Center for Russian and Eastern
European Studies, said he welcomed the
plans to develop a European research cen

ter, and added that Berlin is "a particularly
good place" for its location.
"It's very close to Eastern Europe and
linked with what's going on there," he said.
Heller said the new center might not
necessarily be a direct part of the current
Berlin Study Center and that it would be a
"University-wide" program, not just Over
seas Studies.
According to Karen Kramer, director of
Stanford in Berlin, Saturday's conference
brought "together really articulate people
from the East who have reflected on and
experienced these problems first-hand with
analysts and specialists from Stanford who
have not experienced them, but have stud
ied them in-depth."
The conference, co-sponsored by Stan-


Stanford seeks to
be a 'long-term
actor' in the 'intel
lectual and politi
cal community' of
Germany.
— Thomas Heller
ford in Berlin and the institute,
was the second of a newly
launched annual series called the
"Stanford Berlin Symposium on
Transition in Europe."
One of the most difficult prob
lems that conference organizers
face, Kramer said, is simply keep
ing pace with the rapidly shifting
geopolitical situation in Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet
Union.
"Keeping up thematically with
all the changes is a real difficul
ty," she said, adding that the
planning time has to be kept very
short — otherwise, the selected
topic may be made obsolete by
new developments.
Political Science Prof. Stephen
Krasner said the conference
allowed him to "really get a feei
for what people are thinking"
about particular issues.
For example, Krasner said,
participants' extreme pessimism
about the situation in the former
Soviet Union is "something I
would not have gotten from read
ing the Financial Times or The
New York Times."
The symposium allows Stan
ford researchers to get a sense of
the human element behind the
issues they study, participants
said.
"People dealing with these
issues in Palo Alto only rarely
meet these kinds of people,"
Kramer said.
Krasner added that his experi
ence at the conference will help

him add "a depth of solidity" to
his lectures at Stanford.
Mechthild Kupper, a journalist
from the German newspaper Der
Tagespiegel, said that as a major
American institution located in
Berlin, Stanford was the ideal
host of such a conference.
"The scope is just much bigger
when you are Stanford," Kupper
said. "A German university would
have had to make an enormous
effort to put on the same type of
conference."
Kupper added that as "a self
sufficient little island in the
West" that has been catapulted
"to the capital of the East," Berlin
provided the perfect setting.
The city acts as a bridge between
East and West, Naimark said,
which makes it "a good geographi
cal, intellectual center for thinking
about the past and the present."
"Berlin is the easiest place to
bring people from East and West
together," said junior Kathleen
Weldon. "It is a microcosm for the
changes going on all over Europe.
West Berlin is definitely a west
ern city — it's got the neon. But
in many ways the eastern part is
just not as developed. Berlin is
not one city yet."
In addition to the staff of the
Berlin Center and the institute,
four Stanford students currently
studying in Berlin assisted in
organizing the conference and
will spend the coming weeks con
densing the proceedings into a
publication.
"It was really interesting to see
how something like this is set up .
. . and what these people do,"
Weldon said. "It is sort of like see
ing an I.R. major in action."

ers opening a new European research cen
ter in Berlin modeled after its Stanford
Japan Center based at Kyoto University.
The new center, which is still in the
early planning stages, would be the next
phase of the University's plans to "beef up

research" and expand its overseas links,
according to Nancy Okimoto, associate
director of the institute.
The conference — which was attended
by Americans and Europeans from
academia, government, business and the
media — was a natural outgrowth of that
effort, she added.
Law Prof. Thomar H»IW, deputy direr*
tor of the institute and director of Overseas
Studies, said the aim of Saturday's confer
ence was "to insert Stanford in Berlin as a
long-term actor into the intellectual and
political community" of Germany.
The new center in Berlin, Heller said,
"would use the same kinds of features as
Japan. Having a center like Kyoto that
combines . . . research and outreach would

make sense in Europe."
Since its opening in 1989, the Japan
Center has been a magnet for research and
academic exchange between Stanford and
Japanese scholars and businesses.
History Prof. Norman Naimark, direc
tor of the Center for Russian and Eastern
European Studies, said he welcomed the
plans to develop a European research cen

ter, and added that Berlin is "a particularly
good place" for its location.
"It's very close to Eastern Europe and
linked with what's going on there," he said.
Heller said the new center might not
necessarily be a direct part of the current
Berlin Study Center and that it would be a
"University-wide" program, not just Over
seas Studies.
According to Karen Kramer, director of
Stanford in Berlin, Saturday's conference
brought "together really articulate people
from the East who have reflected on and
experienced these problems first-hand with
analysts and specialists from Stanford who
have not experienced them, but have stud
ied them in-depth."
The conference, co-sponsored by Stan-


Stanford seeks to
be a 'long-term
actor' in the 'intel
lectual and politi
cal community' of
Germany.

ford in Berlin and the institute,
was the second of a newly
launched annual series called the
"Stanford Berlin Symposium on
Transition in Europe."
One of the most difficult prob
lems that conference organizers
face, Kramer said, is simply keep
ing pace with the rapidly shifting
geopolitical situation in Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet
Union.
"Keeping up thematically with
all the changes is a real difficul
ty," she said, adding that the
planning time has to be kept very
short — otherwise, the selected
topic may be made obsolete by
new developments.
Political Science Prof. Stephen
Krasner said the conference
allowed him to "really get a feei
for what people are thinking"
about particular issues.
For example, Krasner said,
participants' extreme pessimism
about the situation in the former
Soviet Union is "something I
would not have gotten from read
ing the Financial Times or The
New York Times."
The symposium allows Stan
ford researchers to get a sense of
the human element behind the
issues they study, participants
said.
"People dealing with these
issues in Palo Alto only rarely
meet these kinds of people,"
Kramer said.
Krasner added that his experi
ence at the conference will help

him add "a depth of solidity" to
his lectures at Stanford.
Mechthild Kupper, a journalist
from the German newspaper Der
Tagespiegel, said that as a major
American institution located in
Berlin, Stanford was the ideal
host of such a conference.
"The scope is just much bigger
when you are Stanford," Kupper
said. "A German university would
have had to make an enormous
effort to put on the same type of
conference."
Kupper added that as "a self
sufficient little island in the
West" that has been catapulted
"to the capital of the East," Berlin
provided the perfect setting.
The city acts as a bridge between
East and West, Naimark said,
which makes it "a good geographi
cal, intellectual center for thinking
about the past and the present."
"Berlin is the easiest place to
bring people from East and West
together," said junior Kathleen
Weldon. "It is a microcosm for the
changes going on all over Europe.
West Berlin is definitely a west
ern city — it's got the neon. But
in many ways the eastern part is
just not as developed. Berlin is
not one city yet."
In addition to the staff of the
Berlin Center and the institute,
four Stanford students currently
studying in Berlin assisted in
organizing the conference and
will spend the coming weeks con
densing the proceedings into a
publication.
"It was really interesting to see
how something like this is set up .
. . and what these people do,"
Weldon said. "It is sort of like see
ing an I.R. major in action."
BERLIN — As a sign of what may be an
expanding role for overseas campuses,
more than 30 scholars from East and West
gathered for a symposium at the Stanford
Berlin Study Center on Saturday to grap
ple with the burgeoning problems of a post-
Cold War Europe.

ter in Berlin modeled after its Stanford
