## Season ends as Card falls in regionals 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
You can call it's Sudden Saturday, or perhaps
the Nightmare of the 23rd. Among other things,
the members of the Stanford baseball team are sim
ply calling it the end of the line.
At first, things looked good. The Cardinal defeat
ed and eliminated the Georgia Bulldogs 7-3 Friday
behind an excellent pitching performance by Rick
Helling, and entered Saturday, the third day of the
South II regional, 2-0 and in the driver's seat. But
then, disaster.
In the morning game, the No. 1-seeded and
ninth-ranked Stanford was shut-out by the fifth
seeded and unranked Western Carolina Cata
mounts 5-0. This put the Cardinal in the unenvi
able position of having to face the home team, sec
ond-seeded and fourteenth-ranked Florida State in
a night game.
Facing elimination themselves, the Seminoles
played with an incredible intensity as they rolled to
a 9-4 win and an opportunity to face the Cata
mounts in a double-header for the regional champi
onship and a chance to go to the College World
Series.
But for Stanford, the loss meant that they would
be home for finals.
"We played to the best of our ability all season,"
said senior left-fielder Dave Cornell, "and today it
just didn't come together."
Friday, however, it looked like it was going to be
another story.
Helling pitched a complete game masterpiece,

allowing only three runs on eight hits, walking two
and striking out six. Meanwhile, the Cardinal bats
were anything but silent. Jeffrey Hammonds led
the way by going a perfect five-for-five on the day
with a double and two runs scored.
Dusty Allen hit a monstrous three-run homerun
in the eighth, clearing a 30-foot high fence in right
field. The opposite field shot was estimated at over
400 feet.
After the game, coach Mark Marquess was opti
mistic.
"I have to like our chances," Marquess said.
"We're 2-0 and playing real well right now."
The Cardinal was indeed looking good. Stan
ford's third starter, Brian Sackinsky, was most def
initely better than any other team's third starter,
and a Cardinal win would advance it to the finals
where it would have to beat their opponent once.
The Cardinal preseason All-American and likely
high-round draft-pick Sackinsky in one of the

biggest games of his career would cruise against
anything the Western Carolina Catamounts could
offer. Right? Wrong.
While Sackinsky did pitch decently, it wasn't
nearly as good as the performance of his counter
part, Patrick Kendrick. In fact, Kendrick shut out
the Cardinal on only six hits, all singles in a com
plete game performance. The Cardinal looked
exactly like what all the preseason reports said —
some pitching, little hitting.
"We started to press [from the plate]," said assis
tant coach David Esquer. "The bats were trying to
do too much. And because of that, five innings of
good pitching [on behalf of the Catamounts] snow
balled into nine innings."
Kendrick did come up with the big outs when he
needed them. The Cardinal stranded seven in the
game, with at least one in six different innings.

David Cornell celebrates with his teammates after scoring a run. The Cardinal baseball team didn't have
a whole lot to cheer about after being eliminated from the NCAA Baseball Regionals following back-to
back losses. Stanford lost to 5-0 to Western Carolina and then 9-4 to Florida State.
