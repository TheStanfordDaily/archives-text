Call it a comeback.
For the 13th-ranked Stanford Cardinal
men's golf team, the 1992 campaign
almost came to a premature close this
weekend before a

seventh-place fin
ish saved their sea
son at the NCAA
Western Regional
qualifier in Tuc
son, Ariz.
Needing a top
nine finish among
19 invitees from
Districts 7 and 8 to
advance in post
season play, the
Pacific 10 Confer
ence Champion

Cardinal hit the links at National Golf
Course Friday in seventh place after one
day of competition, only to return to the
clubhouse in the lowly 12th position. That
night, head coach Wally Goodwin deter
mined that a team meeting was in order so
that he could gather his charges' ideas on
how to emerge from their malaise.
Goodwin came into his conference with
the notion that nothing less than a three
or four-under-par team showing from the
Cardinal Saturday would enable the squad

'We beat every team
we could have possi
bly caught after
falling so far behind
Friday.'
— coach Wally Goodwin

to leapfrog the three places necessary to
continue its season. Translated into indi
vidual performances, Goodwin's plan
called for each Stanford golfer to finish the
final 18 holes at a one-under-par clip.
However, after getting the Cardinal to
aim for his prescribed goals, Goodwin

changed his mina
after walking the
course early Satur
day morning.
"I walked the
entire course," Good
win said, "and I judged
from the pin place
ments and the fairway
and green conditions
that an even par day
from the team would
probably get it done."
Luckily, Cardinal

team members did
not hear their coach's toned-down expec
tations. Instead, they hit the course with
unprecedented determination and easily
extended their season.
Stanford's five-under-par 283 Saturday
total was the second-lowest on the course
that day — only homestanding Arizona,
who would go on to win the event, would
score lower.
The Cardinal's fantastic finish saw
three golfers finish with Good
winian one-under 71s and one,
sophomore Notah Begay, card a
two-under 70.
"More than ever before, this
was a team effort," Goodwin
said.
"We beat every team we could
have possibly caught after falling
so far behind Friday."
Sophomore Casey Martin and
senior Christian Cevaer were
"low-men" for the Cardinal, as

their individual 216 tallies
earned them even-pars for the
54-hole tourney. Freshman
Steve Burdick continued to pro
vide hope for the long-term
future of the club, as he shot a
two-over 218 over three days.
Junior Brad Lanning followed
with a 220, while Begay suffered
through a 79 round Friday
before bouncing back with the
aforementioned 70 to salvage a
three-day sum of 221.
The linksters will now travel
to Albuquerque, N.M., to partici
pate as one of 30 teams at the
NCAA Championship meet June
3-6.
