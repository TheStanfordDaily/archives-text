# O'Brien gets some respect at Nationals
## 
### 
After a year of quiet turmoil, William Alexan
der O'Brien finally let himself smile. No more
worries of experience wasted. No more
thoughts of money lost. No more questing for
respect.
Now was the time to be happy, and Alex knew it.
Receiving serve holding triple match point on
Georgia's Wade McGuire, the man known
simply as "OB" had realized his dream was
about to be fulfilled and could no longer hold it back.
With ESPN letting the nation watch, O'Brien's lips
followed his soaring spirits and he grinned a win
ning grin. He had made it, the smile told us; he had
won.
Seconds later Alex O'Brien was the 1992 NCAA
men's singles tennis champion. Hours later he

teamed with Chris Cocotos to win the doubles. With
Stanford having wrapped up the team title last
week, O'Brien thus became the first person to win
The Triple since Cardinal player-turned-assistant
coach John Whitlinger turned the trick in 1974.
For anyone who knows Alex, it is hard not to
share in his joy. Now an NCAA record 40-5 in cham
pionship play, O'Brien has more than worked for
his goals, he has suffered for them.
Coming off an All-America freshman year despite
playing most of the season with a rotary cuff injury
that gave him one of the weakest serves in the col
lege game, OB had to watch as the Jared and John
show came to the Farm. Two of the nation's top
juniors, Jared Palmer and John Stark were deemed
the future of Cardinal tennis, and in terms of pub
licity everyone else got left in the dust. When any
body spoke of Stanford tennis it was "Jared this"
and "John that" and if they had the time, "yeah,
and O'Brien too."
Alex kept his mouth shut, but it bothered him.
WTiilS the press hounded hisyyoungeri r teammatfes, 1
O'Brien just kept on winning and waiting for his
time in the sun. That time probably should have
come last year when he spent the entire season at
No. 1, but he was still denied his due when everyone
in the known press world — including his own
school paper — refused to acknowledge O'Brien's
tennis talents even though he kept beating Palmer
and Stark in challenge matches and at tourna
ments.
They would say that John was still suffering
from a hurt foot and that Jared was just off that
day. They would forget that John was perfectly
healthy and that one of the things that makes OB
such a great player is that he rarely has off days.
When Palmer and Stark left for the pro ranks in
1991, things should have gotten better for O'Brien,
but instead they were made worse. In what seemed
like a continuing story of one-upmanship, John and
Jared got to have all the fun while Alex had to stay
behind. They got the chance at the big money and
the experience of the next level as OB stayed in
school and continued to write English papers.
It did not seem fair. You go to school for an edu
cation, but you get that education in order to get a

good job and be successful in life. If
you can do that early, why not go?
But he did not go. On the strong
advice of his parents and friends,
OB decided to stay at Stanford and
thus endured a summer of'9l that
included giving up the pay check
from a pro tournament he won in
Connecticut. He did not go, but he
returned this year a little more bit
ter than when he had left.
True to his nature, he kept
most of his feelings sealed away

from the general public. Yet you
could tell he wasn't happy, and
every now and then it would come
out: he had no one to hit with; he
was losing ground to his friends
who were already on the tour; he
could be making money ... yes, he
understood the gains of remaining
a college student, but was it the
right choice?
That question swirled around
in his head countless times as he
watched old friends and former
teammates win professional
matches and begin their careers.
He watched and he waited; hoping
for the day when it would be his
turn to reap the fruit of his talents

and make all his labor and mental
strain worthwhile.
That day finally came last Sun
day. McGuire went deep and OB
went up — straight to the colle
giate pinnacle of the sport he loves.
No more pain, no more bitterness.
Just the pure pleasure of finally
being recognized as the best tennis
player in the land.
Keep smiling 08. You deserve
it.

Chip Hall thanks everyone for
reading and wishes all graduating
seniors the best of luck while won
dering why we were all in such a
hurry to get out in the first place.
