# Individuals shine but teams falter at track and field Pac-10s
## 
### Nick Clements Staff writer 
For Stanford track and field's NCAA hopefuls,
track-crazed Eugene, Ore., was just the site they
needed for the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships.
"There will not be a better overall track meet in
the nation this year, except for the Olympic Trials,"
said Stanford assistant coach Scott Chisam. "In a
non-Olympic year, this would be the finest competi
tion of the year."
As a team, the Cardinal did not fare particularly

well, placing ninth on the men's side and seventh on
the women's side. Individually, though, Stanford
managed to place several athletes in the top five.
Sophomore Dave Popejoy turned in one of the
finest performances of the meet in the hammer
throw with a toss of 216 feet, easily winning his
event. The throw qualifies him for the Olympic Tri
als and ranks him third in the NCAAs, right behind
his longtime friend Kevin McMahon from George
town. Both will compete for the NCAA crown in
about two weeks at Texas-Austin, where Popejoy
hopes to better his mark in order to receive funding
for the Olympic Trials.

Sophomore Toby Norwood completed the men's
hammer one-two punch, placing fifth with a throw
of 194 feet, six inches.
"These guys are still young so they'll be in every
body's face in the future," Chisam said.
Junior Pat Stowell also turned in a big perfor
mance for men's throwing, placing fifth in the discus
with a throw of 177 feet.
Senior Chryste Gaines turned in yet another
world-class race, racing to a win in the 100-meter
dash to win her third straight Pac-10 title in a wind
aided time of 10.94 seconds. The back-wind of 2.06
meters per second was barely over the 2 meters per
second mark allowed for record purposes.
A native Texan, Gaines will be returning home
when she competes in the NCAA Championships.
She set the state record in the 200-meters her senior
year in high school at UT-Austin.
"She'll be a foreigner as far as her school goes, but
people will realize she's a Texan at heart," Chisam
said.
Gaines came back in the 200-meters to take sec
ond to USC's Inger Miller, whom she beat in the
100. Her time of 22.63 seconds was easily a personal
best. Junior Rhonda Oliver came in fourth in the
same event, running what Chisam said was "her
finest race at Stanford."
Senior Jackie Edwards, who is almost certainly
Barcelona-bound this summer along with Gaines,
leaped 21 feet, eight and one-half inches to win the
long jump. She came back the next day to set a school
record in the triple jump, leaping 43 feet, four and
one-quarter inches. She wound up taking second as
UCLA's Roshanda Glenn beat her by 3/4 of an inch.
"It'll take 44 plus to win NCAAs, and Jackie can
certainly do that," Chisam said.
Freshman Travis Clark took fourth place in the
high jump, clearing seven feet, one-half inches. Five
of the top six high jump finishers in the Pac-10 will
return next year.
"Travis certainly looked like a junior, so we'll
have him for three more senior seasons," Chisam
said. Clark, who missed half the season with a stress
fracture in his foot, will almost certainly qualify for

NCAAs next year, barring injury.
Men's middle distance turned in solid perfor
mances, particularly in the 10,000-meters. Junior
Gary Stolz took third with a personal best time of
29:36.48, while senior Dave Scudamore took sixth
with a time of 30:07.76.
"Gary's time would have won in six out of the last
seven years, so it was an outstanding race," Chisam

'Gary's time would have won in
six out of the last seven years,
so it was an outstanding race'
— coach Scott Chisam

said. "It's always good to be up in Eugene. They real
ly appreciate track up there, and you can tell they're
a knowledgeable crowd."
Chisam said that Scudamore was running ill and
had a temperature of 102 degrees the night after his
race, but should be ready for the NCAA Champi
onships. Currently, Scudamore is ranked 11th in the
country right now and looks almost certain to make
the final-16 cut.
Senior Fred Carter ran a lifetime best 8:54.12 in
the 3000-meter steeplechase to take eighth place,
falling about 12 seconds short of the NCAA auto
matic qualifying time. His last opportunity to quali
fy will probably be the Bruce Jenner Meet next
weekend, which world long-jump record holder Mike
Powell will attend.
Junior Susan Helfter rounded out Stanford's
middle-distance attack, placing fifth in the 800-
meters in a time of 2:11.21.
Chisam said that one of the highlights of the meet
was when Popejoy and Edwards took a victory lap
together Friday. The lap was probably the first
Popejoy has run in a meet all year.
"Jackie had to wait up for Dave a couple times,"
he said. "She was nice to him."

onships. Currently, Scudamore is ranked 11th in the
country right now and looks almost certain to make
the final-16 cut.
Senior Fred Carter ran a lifetime best 8:54.12 in
the 3000-meter steeplechase to take eighth place,
falling about 12 seconds short of the NCAA auto
matic qualifying time. His last opportunity to quali
fy will probably be the Bruce Jenner Meet next
weekend, which world long-jump record holder Mike
Powell will attend.
Junior Susan Helfter rounded out Stanford's
middle-distance attack, placing fifth in the 800-
meters in a time of 2:11.21.
Chisam said that one of the highlights of the meet
was when Popejoy and Edwards took a victory lap
together Friday. The lap was probably the first
Popejoy has run in a meet all year.
"Jackie had to wait up for Dave a couple times,"
he said. "She was nice to him."

Dave Popejoy launches another throw for Stanford. Popejoy threw a personal-best 216 feet to easily
win his event at the Track Pac-10 championships. The throw qualifes him for the Olympic trials and
ranks him third overall In the NCAA.
For Stanford track and field's NCAA hopefuls,
track-crazed Eugene, Ore., was just the site they
needed for the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships.
"There will not be a better overall track meet in
the nation this year, except for the Olympic Trials,"
said Stanford assistant coach Scott Chisam. "In a
non-Olympic year, this would be the finest competi
tion of the year."
As a team, the Cardinal did not fare particularly

well, placing ninth on the men's side and seventh on
the women's side. Individually, though, Stanford
managed to place several athletes in the top five.
Sophomore Dave Popejoy turned in one of the
finest performances of the meet in the hammer
throw with a toss of 216 feet, easily winning his
event. The throw qualifies him for the Olympic Tri
als and ranks him third in the NCAAs, right behind
his longtime friend Kevin McMahon from George
town. Both will compete for the NCAA crown in
about two weeks at Texas-Austin, where Popejoy
hopes to better his mark in order to receive funding
for the Olympic Trials.

Sophomore Toby Norwood completed the men's
hammer one-two punch, placing fifth with a throw
of 194 feet, six inches.
"These guys are still young so they'll be in every
body's face in the future," Chisam said.
Junior Pat Stowell also turned in a big perfor
mance for men's throwing, placing fifth in the discus
with a throw of 177 feet.
Senior Chryste Gaines turned in yet another
world-class race, racing to a win in the 100-meter
dash to win her third straight Pac-10 title in a wind
aided time of 10.94 seconds. The back-wind of 2.06
meters per second was barely over the 2 meters per
second mark allowed for record purposes.
A native Texan, Gaines will be returning home
when she competes in the NCAA Championships.
She set the state record in the 200-meters her senior
year in high school at UT-Austin.
"She'll be a foreigner as far as her school goes, but
people will realize she's a Texan at heart," Chisam
said.
Gaines came back in the 200-meters to take sec
ond to USC's Inger Miller, whom she beat in the
100. Her time of 22.63 seconds was easily a personal
best. Junior Rhonda Oliver came in fourth in the
same event, running what Chisam said was "her
finest race at Stanford."
Senior Jackie Edwards, who is almost certainly
Barcelona-bound this summer along with Gaines,
leaped 21 feet, eight and one-half inches to win the
long jump. She came back the next day to set a school
record in the triple jump, leaping 43 feet, four and
one-quarter inches. She wound up taking second as
UCLA's Roshanda Glenn beat her by 3/4 of an inch.
"It'll take 44 plus to win NCAAs, and Jackie can
certainly do that," Chisam said.
Freshman Travis Clark took fourth place in the
high jump, clearing seven feet, one-half inches. Five
of the top six high jump finishers in the Pac-10 will
return next year.
"Travis certainly looked like a junior, so we'll
have him for three more senior seasons," Chisam
said. Clark, who missed half the season with a stress
fracture in his foot, will almost certainly qualify for

NCAAs next year, barring injury.
Men's middle distance turned in solid perfor
mances, particularly in the 10,000-meters. Junior
Gary Stolz took third with a personal best time of
29:36.48, while senior Dave Scudamore took sixth
with a time of 30:07.76.
"Gary's time would have won in six out of the last
seven years, so it was an outstanding race," Chisam

six out of the last seven years,

— coach Scott Chisam

said. "It's always good to be up in Eugene. They real
ly appreciate track up there, and you can tell they're
a knowledgeable crowd."
Chisam said that Scudamore was running ill and
had a temperature of 102 degrees the night after his
race, but should be ready for the NCAA Champi
onships. Currently, Scudamore is ranked 11th in the
country right now and looks almost certain to make
the final-16 cut.
