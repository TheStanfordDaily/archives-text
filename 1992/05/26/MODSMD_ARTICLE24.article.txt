What a difference a day makes. Or in the
case of the Stanford women's crew, what a dif
ference two weeks make.
After being dominated by California in the
Big Row two weeks ago, the varsity women's
crew bounced back to edge the Golden Bears
for second place in the Pacific 10 champi
onships this Saturday, falling short only to
league champion Washington.
The second-place finish earned the Cardi
nal a spot at the national championships in
Cincinnati, Ohio, but the Cardinal will not
attend due to the absence of team captain
Bonnie Baker, who will compete in the
Women's Crew Olympic Trials in New Jersey
next weekend.
"Stanford just has a way of doing that to
Cal," said women's crew head coach Wendy
Davis. "Stanford athletes seem to find a way
to beat them when it matters."
A strong headwind made rowing difficult
for all competitors on Saturday. Washington

posted a winning time of 6 minutes, 59 sec
onds in the final heat, followed by Stanford at
7:10 and California at 7:11.
"We had a close race [with California] all the
way," Davis said, "but we really pulled it out in
the end. They know how sweet a win over Cal
is."
• Borrowing a page from Thelma and Louise,
the Cardinal women turned to their coach
before receiving their medals and yelled, "Dar
lin', did we cause that?"

On the men's side, the Stanford varsity
boat took fourth place in a highly competitive
final heat. Washington won again in the men's
division to sweep the competition in the
eights, followed by UCLA, California, and
Stanford.
"We rowed a pretty good race," said Steve
Voorhis, senior member of the men's crew.
"They just came out stronger than us."
The men's crew ends their 1992 season
after surprising many teams on the west
coast, even themselves, while building a solid
base for the future.
"I'm really impressed with how much we've
improved over the season," Voorhis said.
"Next year we have guys coming up from JV
and frosh that should help us out quite a bit."
The men's frosh team took third in their
division, and the junior varsity finished sev
enth in their bracket.
Among the women, Stanford's varsity four
took fourth in their race. The women also
nabbed fourth in the second novice division,
and captured tenth in the first novice competi
tion.
