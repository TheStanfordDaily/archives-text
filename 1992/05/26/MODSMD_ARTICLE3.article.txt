## Cites NEA politics

Long-time Stanford professor
Wallace Stegner rejected a
National Medal for the Arts last
week, charging that the federal
agency that grants the awards,
the NEA, is being stifled by
"political censorship."
"You can't conduct arts with
censors sitting back," Stegner
said in a telephone interview yes
terday."I believe in government
support for the arts, but arts
should be autonomous."
Stegner, a Stanford professor
for 27 years and the founder of
its acclaimed Creative Writing
program, said he received a call
from the National Endowment
for the Arts telling him he was
one of the recipients of the medal
in early May.
At first, Stegner said, he was
"flattered at the notion" of
receiving the medal, and consid
ered accepting it.
But "the more I thought
about it, the less I thought about
it," said Stegner, who received a
$40,000 fellowship from the
NEA in 1990.
The 83-year-old Pulitzer
Prize-winner rejected the medal
— which he would have received
from President Bush in July —
in a letter to the NEA late last
week.
In his letter, Stegner said he
couldn't accept the award
because he was "troubled by the
political controls placed on the
agency."
"The government played into
pressures of the far right," Steg
ner said.
"People like Patrick
Buchanan and Jesse Helms have
been attacking it for a long time,
and the administration played
into the pressure."
Brad Owens, a lecturer in the
Creative Writing program, said
