# Stegner rejects award
## Cites NEA politics 
### Julia Sobrevilla Editorial staff 
Long-time Stanford professor
Wallace Stegner rejected a
National Medal for the Arts last
week, charging that the federal
agency that grants the awards,
the NEA, is being stifled by
"political censorship."
"You can't conduct arts with
censors sitting back," Stegner
said in a telephone interview yes
terday."I believe in government
support for the arts, but arts
should be autonomous."
Stegner, a Stanford professor
for 27 years and the founder of
its acclaimed Creative Writing
program, said he received a call
from the National Endowment
for the Arts telling him he was
one of the recipients of the medal
in early May.
At first, Stegner said, he was
"flattered at the notion" of
receiving the medal, and consid
ered accepting it.
But "the more I thought
about it, the less I thought about
it," said Stegner, who received a
$40,000 fellowship from the
NEA in 1990.
The 83-year-old Pulitzer
Prize-winner rejected the medal
— which he would have received
from President Bush in July —
in a letter to the NEA late last
week.
In his letter, Stegner said he
couldn't accept the award
because he was "troubled by the
political controls placed on the
agency."
"The government played into
pressures of the far right," Steg
ner said.
"People like Patrick
Buchanan and Jesse Helms have
been attacking it for a long time,
and the administration played
into the pressure."
Brad Owens, a lecturer in the
Creative Writing program, said
he was "thrilled" when he heard
that Stegner had rejected the
medal.
Owens said that "from afar, I
always considered [Stegner]
very conservative, and the fact
that he is turning down the
medal will make people think
and question the way the NEA
is being run."
Stegner said his rejection of
the medal is not a criticism of
the NEA, but of the govern
ment.
"The Endowment is not what
I'm protesting," he said. "I'm
protesting the administration."
Although Stegner said he has
not always agreed with the
NEA's grants, he said he did
support the freedom it had to
operate in the past.
"The [NEA's] record has
been very good until recently,"
he said.
"This does not mean that
every grant has been a good
grant, but I do like the idea that
[the grants have] been made
with no pressure."
John Frohnmayer, former
director of the NEA and a 1964
Stanford graduate, was forced
to resign in February after
receiving continuous criticism
from conservatives.
Anne-Imelda Radice replaced
Frohnmayer May 1, and Stegner
said he believes she was
appointed with a "very clear
political purpose."
"It seems to me that this is a
politically dominated group

now," Stegner said. "They're
under the gun and more or less
helpless now."
Stegner said the administra
tion "should appoint a non-par
tisan person and let them do
their job without interfering.
The artists themselves
should be making the deci
sions."
Stegner is the second person
ality to turn down this year's
NEA medal.
Two weeks ago, Tony-award
winning composer Stephen
Sondheim rejected the medal.
But unlike Sondheim, who
did not grant interviews after
spurning the NEA, Stegner
said he intends to make the
reasons for his decision pub
licly known.
"I don't want to make a big
thing out of this, but I don't
want to keep it under the bush,"
Stegner said.
In addition to teaching at
Stanford, Stegner has published
28 books. In 1972, he received
the Pulitzer prize for "Angle of
Repose," and in 1976 he won
the National Book award for
"Spectator Bird."
The Creative Writing pro
gram he created and directed
until his retirement in 1971 has
included authors such as Ray
mond Carver, Scott Turow,
Larry McMurtry and Robert
Stone.
The NEA medal is awarded to
12 personalities annually.
The president chooses the
recipients from a list of 24 nom
inated by the NEA.
The medals have been award
ed since 1985 at the White
House.

said in a telephone interview yes
terday."I believe in government
support for the arts, but arts
should be autonomous."
Stegner, a Stanford professor
for 27 years and the founder of
its acclaimed Creative Writing
program, said he received a call
from the National Endowment
for the Arts telling him he was
one of the recipients of the medal
in early May.
At first, Stegner said, he was
"flattered at the notion" of
receiving the medal, and consid
ered accepting it.
But "the more I thought
about it, the less I thought about
it," said Stegner, who received a
$40,000 fellowship from the
NEA in 1990.
The 83-year-old Pulitzer
Prize-winner rejected the medal
— which he would have received
from President Bush in July —
in a letter to the NEA late last
week.
In his letter, Stegner said he
couldn't accept the award
because he was "troubled by the
political controls placed on the
agency."
"The government played into
pressures of the far right," Steg
ner said.
"People like Patrick
Buchanan and Jesse Helms have
been attacking it for a long time,
and the administration played
into the pressure."
Brad Owens, a lecturer in the
Creative Writing program, said
he was "thrilled" when he heard
that Stegner had rejected the
medal.
Owens said that "from afar, I
always considered [Stegner]
very conservative, and the fact
that he is turning down the
medal will make people think
and question the way the NEA
is being run."
Stegner said his rejection of
the medal is not a criticism of
the NEA, but of the govern
ment.
"The Endowment is not what
I'm protesting," he said. "I'm
protesting the administration."
Although Stegner said he has
not always agreed with the
NEA's grants, he said he did
support the freedom it had to
operate in the past.
"The [NEA's] record has
been very good until recently,"
he said.
"This does not mean that
every grant has been a good
grant, but I do like the idea that
[the grants have] been made
with no pressure."
John Frohnmayer, former
director of the NEA and a 1964
Stanford graduate, was forced
to resign in February after
receiving continuous criticism
from conservatives.
Anne-Imelda Radice replaced
Frohnmayer May 1, and Stegner
said he believes she was
appointed with a "very clear
political purpose."
"It seems to me that this is a
politically dominated group

now," Stegner said. "They're
under the gun and more or less
helpless now."
Stegner said the administra
tion "should appoint a non-par
tisan person and let them do
their job without interfering.
The artists themselves
should be making the deci
sions."
Stegner is the second person
ality to turn down this year's
NEA medal.
Two weeks ago, Tony-award
winning composer Stephen
Sondheim rejected the medal.
But unlike Sondheim, who
did not grant interviews after
spurning the NEA, Stegner
said he intends to make the
reasons for his decision pub
licly known.
"I don't want to make a big
thing out of this, but I don't
want to keep it under the bush,"
Stegner said.
In addition to teaching at
Stanford, Stegner has published
28 books. In 1972, he received
the Pulitzer prize for "Angle of
Repose," and in 1976 he won
the National Book award for
"Spectator Bird."
The Creative Writing pro
gram he created and directed
until his retirement in 1971 has
included authors such as Ray
mond Carver, Scott Turow,
Larry McMurtry and Robert
Stone.
The NEA medal is awarded to
12 personalities annually.
The president chooses the
recipients from a list of 24 nom
inated by the NEA.
The medals have been award
ed since 1985 at the White
House.
