# Kimball tops Draw; 96 percent housed
## Row less popular, domestic partners up 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
With two new undergraduate
residences on the way, nearly
every student who entered the
Draw received housing this year,
according to housing officials.
Kimball Hall continued as the
most popular dormitory overall,
while the new Manzanita II
dorms were among the top five for
both men and women.
Ninety-six percent of students
were assigned housing through
the Draw this year — an increase
of 5 percent from last year — and
housing officials said students
who join the waiting list are near
ly assured of receiving housing by
fall quarter.
But housing officials said they
were concerned by the drop in
popularity of several Row and
special priority houses.
Some of the houses were in
such low demand that a few
unguaranteed students who drew
very poorly were assigned to them
even when they didn't request it,
according to Bill Georges, acting
director of the Housing Center.
In particular, he said, the
Enchanted Broccoli Forest and
Phi Sig — which each drew at
about 4,600 for men without pri
ority — had "a significant prob
lem" luring students.
Georges said he expects the
houses that weren't in demand
this year to "work harder" next

year to "reach out to students and
inform them about their houses."
The houses' residents will have
to visit dorms — especially fresh
men dorms — before the Draw to
"talk about their houses,"
Georges said.
The housing office will work to
increase the houses' visibility by
organizing an expanded Row
Faire next year, Georges added.
But overall, he said, this year's
Draw went "very smoothly" and
he was pleased with its results.
As the University prepares to
begin its four-year guaranteed
housing pledge for next year's
freshmen, Georges said the hous
ing office is "really just about
where we want to be." He added
that it was "unexpected" that the
number of unassigned students
fell so much from last year.
This year, only 159 students
were unassigned after the Draw,
while 329 students were unas
signed after last year's Draw. The
number unassigned this year
includes 45 students who could
have been assigned but made
picky choices, according to Barb
Kline-Schoder, undergraduate
housing supervisor.
Undergraduate men with
numbers on or below 4,733 and
women on or below 4,714 have
been assigned on-campus hous
ing. Each of those cutoffs are
lower than last year's by several
