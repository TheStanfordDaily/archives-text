# Kimball tops Draw; 96 percent housed
## Row less popular, domestic partners up 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
With two new undergraduate
residences on the way, nearly
every student who entered the
Draw received housing this year,
according to housing officials.
Kimball Hall continued as the
most popular dormitory overall,
while the new Manzanita II
dorms were among the top five for
both men and women.
Ninety-six percent of students
were assigned housing through
the Draw this year — an increase
of 5 percent from last year — and
housing officials said students
who join the waiting list are near
ly assured of receiving housing by
fall quarter.
But housing officials said they
were concerned by the drop in
popularity of several Row and
special priority houses.
Some of the houses were in
such low demand that a few
unguaranteed students who drew
very poorly were assigned to them
even when they didn't request it,
according to Bill Georges, acting
director of the Housing Center.
In particular, he said, the
Enchanted Broccoli Forest and
Phi Sig — which each drew at
about 4,600 for men without pri
ority — had "a significant prob
lem" luring students.
Georges said he expects the
houses that weren't in demand
this year to "work harder" next

year to "reach out to students and
inform them about their houses."
The houses' residents will have
to visit dorms — especially fresh
men dorms — before the Draw to
"talk about their houses,"
Georges said.
The housing office will work to
increase the houses' visibility by
organizing an expanded Row
Faire next year, Georges added.
But overall, he said, this year's
Draw went "very smoothly" and
he was pleased with its results.
As the University prepares to
begin its four-year guaranteed
housing pledge for next year's
freshmen, Georges said the hous
ing office is "really just about
where we want to be." He added
that it was "unexpected" that the
number of unassigned students
fell so much from last year.
This year, only 159 students
were unassigned after the Draw,
while 329 students were unas
signed after last year's Draw. The
number unassigned this year
includes 45 students who could
have been assigned but made
picky choices, according to Barb
Kline-Schoder, undergraduate
housing supervisor.
Undergraduate men with
numbers on or below 4,733 and
women on or below 4,714 have
been assigned on-campus hous
ing. Each of those cutoffs are
lower than last year's by several
hundred.
In their separate lottery, grad
uate students' housing cutoffs
were 1,548 for men and 2,142 for
women. About 800 students who
entered the graduate Draw were
not assigned housing — an
increase of about 100 from last
year, Georges said.
There were two reasons for the
increase, he said. The first is that
about 150 more graduate students
applied for housing this year
because the University began
admitting more graduate students
as a budget-cutting measure.

558 Mayfield's
'Xanadu' campaign
helped the house
boost its popularity,
residents said.

The second, Georges said, is
that the housing office instituted
a "procedural change" this year in
which it withheld about 50 spaces
from the graduate housing pool.
The spaces will be assigned to
graduate students who are admit
ted late over the summer. These
students, "through no fault of
their own," are unable to enter
the regular lottery, Georges said.
The number of domestic part
ners assigned to housing increased
from about 60 to 100 this year,
Georges said. The domestic part

ners policy, implemented two
years ago, awarded housing and
other benefits to same-sex cou
ples, as well as to opposite-sex
unmarried couples.
Although it attracted some
controversy when it went into
effect — and some worried that
same-sex couples would be the
target of discrimination and hos
tility — Georges said couples have
had "no problems at all."
"People were just concerned
about the unknown," Georges
said. "But when students move
into housing, we find there's no
difference between students."
Undergraduate Draw results
show that 558 Mayfield rose dra
matically in popularity this year.
After drawing in the mid-thou
sands last year, it was the most
sought-after house among women
this year, at 205, and was fifth
among men, at 720.
Housing officials and residents
attributed the increase in the
house's popularity to its
switchover to self-op status and
its pre-Draw advertising cam
paign, which billed it as the
"Xanadu" early '80s theme house.
As a self-op, the house will have
an open kitchen next year, which
added to its popularity, Kline-
Schoder said. And residents said
the "Xanadu" campaign, which
drew attention to 558 Mayfield by
announcing through fliers that it
would become an early '80s theme
house next year, also helped
"I think that had a lot to do
with it," said junior Daniel Liber
man, the house's financial man
ager. "It encouraged people to
come in and check the house out,
and I think they liked the tours."
He said the early '80s theme

year. "If anything, it will be a
joke," Liberman said. "We'll just
have some fun with it."
In a budget-motivated Draw
change, the housing office will no
longer allow students to enter the
waiting list after the school year
begins, Georges said.
Previously, students could
enter the waiting list before they
left for the summer and during
each quarter. But once students
arrive this year, Georges said,
"they should expect to stay in that
house. They can't come back in
the fall and try to get reassigned."

Because of budget
cuts, students will no

the waiting list after

The move will save money by
allowing the office to cut staffers,
Georges said. Since budget cuts
began, the office has cut more
than 30 percent of its staff —
three full-time people and one
quarter of another person's

There were two reasons for the
increase, he said. The first is that
about 150 more graduate students
applied for housing this year
because the University began
admitting more graduate students
as a budget-cutting measure.

558 Mayfield's
'Xanadu' campaign
helped the house
boost its popularity,
residents said.

The second, Georges said, is
that the housing office instituted
a "procedural change" this year in
which it withheld about 50 spaces
from the graduate housing pool.
The spaces will be assigned to
graduate students who are admit
ted late over the summer. These
students, "through no fault of
their own," are unable to enter
the regular lottery, Georges said.
The number of domestic part
ners assigned to housing increased
from about 60 to 100 this year,
Georges said. The domestic part

ners policy, implemented two
years ago, awarded housing and
other benefits to same-sex cou
ples, as well as to opposite-sex
unmarried couples.
Although it attracted some
controversy when it went into
effect — and some worried that
same-sex couples would be the
target of discrimination and hos
tility — Georges said couples have
had "no problems at all."
"People were just concerned
about the unknown," Georges
said. "But when students move
into housing, we find there's no
difference between students."
Undergraduate Draw results
show that 558 Mayfield rose dra
matically in popularity this year.
After drawing in the mid-thou
sands last year, it was the most
sought-after house among women
this year, at 205, and was fifth
among men, at 720.
Housing officials and residents
attributed the increase in the
house's popularity to its
switchover to self-op status and
its pre-Draw advertising cam
paign, which billed it as the
"Xanadu" early '80s theme house.
As a self-op, the house will have
an open kitchen next year, which
added to its popularity, Kline-
Schoder said. And residents said
the "Xanadu" campaign, which
drew attention to 558 Mayfield by
announcing through fliers that it
would become an early '80s theme
house next year, also helped
"I think that had a lot to do
with it," said junior Daniel Liber
man, the house's financial man
ager. "It encouraged people to
come in and check the house out,
and I think they liked the tours."
He said the early '80s theme

will not be an extremely rigorous
part of dorm programming next
year. "If anything, it will be a
joke," Liberman said. "We'll just
have some fun with it."
In a budget-motivated Draw
change, the housing office will no
longer allow students to enter the
waiting list after the school year
begins, Georges said.
Previously, students could
enter the waiting list before they
left for the summer and during
each quarter. But once students
arrive this year, Georges said,
"they should expect to stay in that
house. They can't come back in
the fall and try to get reassigned."

Because of budget
cuts, students will no
longer be able to enter
the waiting list after
the school year begins.

The move will save money by
allowing the office to cut staffers,
Georges said. Since budget cuts
began, the office has cut more
than 30 percent of its staff —
three full-time people and one
quarter of another person's
hours.
With two new undergraduate
residences on the way, nearly
every student who entered the
Draw received housing this year,
according to housing officials.
Kimball Hall continued as the
most popular dormitory overall,
while the new Manzanita II
dorms were among the top five for
both men and women.
Ninety-six percent of students
were assigned housing through
the Draw this year — an increase
of 5 percent from last year — and
housing officials said students
who join the waiting list are near
ly assured of receiving housing by
fall quarter.
But housing officials said they
were concerned by the drop in
popularity of several Row and
special priority houses.
Some of the houses were in
such low demand that a few
unguaranteed students who drew
very poorly were assigned to them
even when they didn't request it,
according to Bill Georges, acting
director of the Housing Center.
In particular, he said, the
Enchanted Broccoli Forest and
Phi Sig — which each drew at
about 4,600 for men without pri
ority — had "a significant prob
lem" luring students.
Georges said he expects the
houses that weren't in demand
this year to "work harder" next

year to "reach out to students and
inform them about their houses."
The houses' residents will have
to visit dorms — especially fresh
men dorms — before the Draw to
"talk about their houses,"
Georges said.
The housing office will work to
increase the houses' visibility by
organizing an expanded Row
Faire next year, Georges added.
But overall, he said, this year's
Draw went "very smoothly" and
he was pleased with its results.
As the University prepares to
begin its four-year guaranteed
housing pledge for next year's
freshmen, Georges said the hous
ing office is "really just about
where we want to be." He added
that it was "unexpected" that the
number of unassigned students
fell so much from last year.
This year, only 159 students
were unassigned after the Draw,
while 329 students were unas
signed after last year's Draw. The
number unassigned this year
includes 45 students who could
have been assigned but made
picky choices, according to Barb
Kline-Schoder, undergraduate
housing supervisor.
Undergraduate men with
numbers on or below 4,733 and
women on or below 4,714 have
been assigned on-campus hous
ing. Each of those cutoffs are
lower than last year's by several
hundred.
In their separate lottery, grad
uate students' housing cutoffs
were 1,548 for men and 2,142 for
women. About 800 students who
entered the graduate Draw were
not assigned housing — an
increase of about 100 from last
year, Georges said.

about 150 more graduate students
