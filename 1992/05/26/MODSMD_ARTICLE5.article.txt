# O'Brien wins The Triple — first since '74

### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Alex O'Brien and Jason Yee
could not have asked for a more
perfect ending to their collegiate
tennis careers. No, this is not in
reference to the surprising
national team title that they
won last Tuesday. This is about
their appearance, on opposite
sides of the net, in the individual
doubles final Sunday after
O'Brien had just won the indi
vidual singles title.

O'Brien and partner Chris
Cocotos, seeded second, bowled
over one opponent after the next
to reach the finals while Yee and
partner Vimal Patel came out of
nowhere, upsetting several
nationally ranked teams, to
claim their spot in the finals.
By defeating his teammates,
7-6 (7-4), 6-4, O'Brien became
the first player since John
Whitlinger, now Stanford's assis
tant coach, to win The Triple —
the team, individual singles and
doubles titles. Whitlinger, who

played for the Cardinal under
coach Dick Gould, swept the
NCAA titles in 1974.
"Chris and Alex proved that
they're No. 1 in the country and
Vimal and Jason proved that
they're right up there too,"
Gould said.
To win the second of the three
titles, in singles, O'Brien defeat
ed Georgia's top player, Wade
McGuire, in front of 3,500 bark
ing Bulldog fans.
McGuire "was really ner
vous," O'Brien said. "He wanted

to impress the hometown crowd.
I played pretty smart but noth
ing great."
"Nothing great" was enough
to earn him a 6-3, 6-2 champi
-1 onship win over the local favorite.
Although O'Brien made it seem
easy, defeating McGuire was no
simple task. Luckily, O'Brien
stole an early lead, attacking
McGuire's second serve merci
lessly. Under pressure, McGuire
made many careless, unforced
errors, including three double
faults in the final game.
Before reaching the finals,
O'Brien had big wins over Matt
Lucena from California, 6-3, 6-2,
Roland Thornquist of North
Carolina, 4-6, 6-2, 7-6 (7-3) and
second-seeded Jose Luis Noriega
from San Diego, 6-0, 6-3.
His win in the semifinals was
perhaps his best match of the tour
nament. Losing only four points in
the first set, he crushed Noriega,
who had taken O'Brien to a 7-5
third set match (which O'Brien
won) earlier in the season.
With the singles title under
his belt, O'Brien only had one
more task to complete. Teaming
up with Cocotos, he increased
