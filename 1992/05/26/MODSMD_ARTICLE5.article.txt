# O'Brien wins The Triple — first since '74
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Alex O'Brien and Jason Yee
could not have asked for a more
perfect ending to their collegiate
tennis careers. No, this is not in
reference to the surprising
national team title that they
won last Tuesday. This is about
their appearance, on opposite
sides of the net, in the individual
doubles final Sunday after
O'Brien had just won the indi
vidual singles title.

O'Brien and partner Chris
Cocotos, seeded second, bowled
over one opponent after the next
to reach the finals while Yee and
partner Vimal Patel came out of
nowhere, upsetting several
nationally ranked teams, to
claim their spot in the finals.
By defeating his teammates,
7-6 (7-4), 6-4, O'Brien became
the first player since John
Whitlinger, now Stanford's assis
tant coach, to win The Triple —
the team, individual singles and
doubles titles. Whitlinger, who

played for the Cardinal under
coach Dick Gould, swept the
NCAA titles in 1974.
"Chris and Alex proved that
they're No. 1 in the country and
Vimal and Jason proved that
they're right up there too,"
Gould said.
To win the second of the three
titles, in singles, O'Brien defeat
ed Georgia's top player, Wade
McGuire, in front of 3,500 bark
ing Bulldog fans.
McGuire "was really ner
vous," O'Brien said. "He wanted

to impress the hometown crowd.
I played pretty smart but noth
ing great."
"Nothing great" was enough
to earn him a 6-3, 6-2 champi
-1 onship win over the local favorite.
Although O'Brien made it seem
easy, defeating McGuire was no
simple task. Luckily, O'Brien
stole an early lead, attacking
McGuire's second serve merci
lessly. Under pressure, McGuire
made many careless, unforced
errors, including three double
faults in the final game.
Before reaching the finals,
O'Brien had big wins over Matt
Lucena from California, 6-3, 6-2,
Roland Thornquist of North
Carolina, 4-6, 6-2, 7-6 (7-3) and
second-seeded Jose Luis Noriega
from San Diego, 6-0, 6-3.
His win in the semifinals was
perhaps his best match of the tour
nament. Losing only four points in
the first set, he crushed Noriega,
who had taken O'Brien to a 7-5
third set match (which O'Brien
won) earlier in the season.
With the singles title under
his belt, O'Brien only had one
more task to complete. Teaming
up with Cocotos, he increased

his overall NCAA tournament
record to 40-5. Friday's victims
were a pair from Oklahoma, who
fell 6-1, 6-0.
Meanwhile, teammates Patel
and Yee were busy eliminating the
tournament's top-seeded Jon
Leach and Brian MacPhie of USC.
This remarkable match should
not have even taken place, as the
Stanford pair was not supposed to
have a spot in the doubles draw.
They were the last team from the
region to receive a bid.
Their 5-7, 6-3, 6-2 victory had
coach Gould shaking his head in
wonder. "They played unbeliev
ably," he said. "Today was just
unreal." MacPhie had an elbow
injury that gave the Trojans'
armor a weak spot.
Patel and Yee's persistence put
them in the quarterfinals against
Thornquist and his partner,
Chris Mumford. Despite a slow
start, the Cardinal prevailed
again, 2-6, 6-4, 6-4.
"That was our toughest match
of all because the guys were really
solid so we had to come up with
big shots," Patel said. "That
match gave us a lot of confidence."
A few hours later, they took on
an "outstanding TCU team,"
according to Gould. However, the
Cardinal roll continued as Patel

and Yee won, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-3).
Cocotos and O'Brien also had a
tight first match Saturday. They
squeaked by USC's David Ekerot
and Andras Lanyi, 7-6 (10-8), 6-4.
The victory was highlighted by
Cocotos's big plays.
Cocotos "just did everything
well," O'Brien said. "He always
seemed to come up with great
shots on big points."
This nerve-wracking win was
followed by an easy breeze past
San Diego State's Jeff Belioli and
Chris Numbers, 6-3, 6-3.
So, the unimaginable had hap
pened. An all-Stanford final.
"This is a phenomenal end to a
phenomenal year," Gould said.
"It was a pretty big surprise to
play our teammates," O'Brien
said, "but after we saw them play
and played them we knew why
they got to the finals. It was
almost like playing a challenge
match except it was the finals of
NCAAs. . . . Pretty important
challenge match," he chuckled.
All week, Patel said, he had
been trying to put in an extra effort
for his partner because he "wanted
Jason to go out on a high note."
With their 7-6 (7-4), 6-4, victo
ry, Cocotos and O'Brien claimed
the national title and O'Brien
broke Whitlinger's record.
"This is a dream come true,
that's for sure," O'Brien said. "I
couldn't ask for anything more
except to have my 12-page paper
finished."

lessly. Under pressure, McGuire
made many careless, unforced
errors, including three double
faults in the final game.
Before reaching the finals,
O'Brien had big wins over Matt
Lucena from California, 6-3, 6-2,
Roland Thornquist of North
Carolina, 4-6, 6-2, 7-6 (7-3) and
second-seeded Jose Luis Noriega
from San Diego, 6-0, 6-3.
His win in the semifinals was
perhaps his best match of the tour
nament. Losing only four points in
the first set, he crushed Noriega,
who had taken O'Brien to a 7-5
third set match (which O'Brien
won) earlier in the season.
With the singles title under
his belt, O'Brien only had one
more task to complete. Teaming
up with Cocotos, he increased

his overall NCAA tournament
record to 40-5. Friday's victims
were a pair from Oklahoma, who
fell 6-1, 6-0.
Meanwhile, teammates Patel
and Yee were busy eliminating the
tournament's top-seeded Jon
Leach and Brian MacPhie of USC.
This remarkable match should
not have even taken place, as the
Stanford pair was not supposed to
have a spot in the doubles draw.
They were the last team from the
region to receive a bid.
Their 5-7, 6-3, 6-2 victory had
coach Gould shaking his head in
wonder. "They played unbeliev
ably," he said. "Today was just
unreal." MacPhie had an elbow
injury that gave the Trojans'
armor a weak spot.
Patel and Yee's persistence put
them in the quarterfinals against
Thornquist and his partner,
Chris Mumford. Despite a slow
start, the Cardinal prevailed
again, 2-6, 6-4, 6-4.
"That was our toughest match
of all because the guys were really
solid so we had to come up with
big shots," Patel said. "That
match gave us a lot of confidence."
A few hours later, they took on
an "outstanding TCU team,"
according to Gould. However, the
Cardinal roll continued as Patel

and Yee won, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-3).
Cocotos and O'Brien also had a
tight first match Saturday. They
squeaked by USC's David Ekerot
and Andras Lanyi, 7-6 (10-8), 6-4.
The victory was highlighted by
Cocotos's big plays.
Cocotos "just did everything
well," O'Brien said. "He always
seemed to come up with great
shots on big points."
This nerve-wracking win was
followed by an easy breeze past
San Diego State's Jeff Belioli and
Chris Numbers, 6-3, 6-3.
So, the unimaginable had hap
pened. An all-Stanford final.
"This is a phenomenal end to a
phenomenal year," Gould said.
"It was a pretty big surprise to
play our teammates," O'Brien
said, "but after we saw them play
and played them we knew why
they got to the finals. It was
almost like playing a challenge
match except it was the finals of
NCAAs. . . . Pretty important
challenge match," he chuckled.
All week, Patel said, he had
been trying to put in an extra effort
for his partner because he "wanted
Jason to go out on a high note."
With their 7-6 (7-4), 6-4, victo
ry, Cocotos and O'Brien claimed
the national title and O'Brien
broke Whitlinger's record.
"This is a dream come true,
that's for sure," O'Brien said. "I
couldn't ask for anything more
except to have my 12-page paper
finished."
Alex O'Brien and Jason Yee
could not have asked for a more
perfect ending to their collegiate
tennis careers. No, this is not in
reference to the surprising
national team title that they
won last Tuesday. This is about
their appearance, on opposite
sides of the net, in the individual
doubles final Sunday after
O'Brien had just won the indi
vidual singles title.

O'Brien and partner Chris
Cocotos, seeded second, bowled
over one opponent after the next
to reach the finals while Yee and
partner Vimal Patel came out of
nowhere, upsetting several
nationally ranked teams, to
claim their spot in the finals.
By defeating his teammates,
7-6 (7-4), 6-4, O'Brien became
the first player since John
Whitlinger, now Stanford's assis
tant coach, to win The Triple —
the team, individual singles and
doubles titles. Whitlinger, who

played for the Cardinal under
coach Dick Gould, swept the
NCAA titles in 1974.
"Chris and Alex proved that
they're No. 1 in the country and
Vimal and Jason proved that
they're right up there too,"
Gould said.
To win the second of the three
titles, in singles, O'Brien defeat
ed Georgia's top player, Wade
McGuire, in front of 3,500 bark
ing Bulldog fans.
McGuire "was really ner
vous," O'Brien said. "He wanted

to impress the hometown crowd.
I played pretty smart but noth
ing great."
"Nothing great" was enough
to earn him a 6-3, 6-2 champi
-1 onship win over the local favorite.
Although O'Brien made it seem
easy, defeating McGuire was no
simple task. Luckily, O'Brien
stole an early lead, attacking
McGuire's second serve merci
