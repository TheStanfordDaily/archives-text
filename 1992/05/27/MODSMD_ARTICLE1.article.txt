# Two ASSU committees take over COP's duties
## Brown, Miyahara to chair top student bodies 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
The new ASSU Senate last night
approved a plan to operate next year's stu
dent government without a Council of
Presidents.
The system divides two of the COP's
main responsibilities — managing the
ASSU's internal affairs and acting as a
liaison between the University and stu
dents — between two ASSU committees.
Under the new plan, the internal busi
ness of the ASSU, such as "oversight of
business and service projects," will be
assumed by the ASSU Executive Commit
tee, which will be led by senate chair Ron
Brown.
The University Relations Committee
will "serve as a liaison between the senate
and other elements of the University" and
will coordinate ASSU activities "in the
University policy-making structure" next
year, according to the plan.
Graduate senator Derek Miyahara, one
of the plan's authors, was elected last
night to lead the committee.
Miyahara said he is unsure what his
exact role will be because the job is so new,
but he thinks his main role will be to serve
as "a medium for [transmitting] student
opinion" to the administration.
Miyahara said he plans to avoid acting
as the sole student representative, and will
consult, with other senators before com
municating with administrators.
"There are a great number of con

stituencies on this campus and the idea
that one person could represent all of
them is a fallacy," he said.
According to the plan, Miyahara — as
chair of the University Relations Commit
tee — will also assume the role of the
deputy senate chair.
The committee will also include mem
bers of each of the ASSU standing com
mittees and the senate chair as a non-vot
ing member. The committee replaces the
old ASSU Steering Committee.
The changes had to be put in place after
the victory of the"I Prefer Not to Have a
COP" slate in the spring election. The Pre
fer slate pledged to do away with the COP
by amending the ASSU constitution next
year. Meanwhile, it will not assume the
office's responsibilities, instead refusing to
work.
The plan approved last night will stand
until the senate's second winter quarter
meeting next year. At that time, the body
will appraise the new system's perfor
mance and vote whether to continue it.
Miyahara said that because the system
is new, it will be some time before its effec
tiveness can be judged.
"We're just experimenting," Miyahara
said. "We have no idea how this thing is
going to work now."
The new plan also shifted the oversight
of the ASSU financial manager and ASSU
business projects, like Flicks, from the COP
to the Budget and Finance Committee. The
