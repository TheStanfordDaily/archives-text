## A 						degree in service 
### 
Diploma from Stanford
is the perfect start for a
career in public service

IN HIS MEMORIAL Auditori
um speech last week, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson challenged Stan
ford students to "take the lead" in
"transforming" America through
public service. Jackson urged his
audience to "put forth a 20-year
plan" designed to overcome the
nation's social, economic and
racial problems.
On June 14, the members of the
class of 1992 will embark on vari
ous "20-year plans" of their own.
Graduation is an opportunity for
seniors to transform their lives —
and the lives of others — using the
benefits of a Stanford education.
Contrary to popular belief, a
diploma from Stanford is worth
much more than lucrative career
opportunities. It represents four
(or more) years of awareness and
experience in various fields of pub
lic service, as well as one of the
best educations available.
At Stanford, public service is as
inevitable as Cultures, Ideas and
Values classes, and a lot more fun.
From the Haas Center to White
Plaza to the Row, diverse opportu
nities for involvement are every
where on campus.
In fact, it would be difficult to
imagine a student graduating from
Stanford without having been
involved in a service-oriented orga
nization or project. Like Ciy Resi
dential Education and distribution
requirements, service is an inte
gral part of a Stanford education.
But as the government makes
increasingly severe cuts in social ser
vices, and the job market becomes
increasingly competitive, seniors
should consider turning on-campus
service projects into life-long careers.
While careers in public service
may seem logistically impractical
or financially prohibitive, they are
in fact neither. Many of today's

most influential service organiza
tions originated on college cam
puses, springing from the minds of
college students.
As a freshman at Stanford, recent
graduate Michael Canul founded
Project Motivation, a program
designed to encourage Mexican-
American high school and junior
high students to attend college.
When he graduated last year,
Canul received a two-year fellow
ship to continue his activities on a
larger scale. He is currently devel
oping programs similar to Project
Motivation at Bay Area schools.
Wendy Koop developed Teach
for America as part of a senior pro
ject at Princeton. The program,
modeled after the Peace Corps,
gives college students without
teaching credentials the opportu
nity to instruct students in rural
and inner-city schools. After grad
uation, Koop put the project into
effect in her community, later
expanding it to the national level.
Daniel Bao, Stanford class of
1990, is the director and founder
of Oakland's Condom Resource
Center, a non-profit organization
committed to preventing AIDS
through education. While at Stan
ford, Bao founded Ye Olde Safer
Sex Shoppe and organized the
first-ever Condom Rating Contest,
now an integral part of National
Condom Week.
But social and economic prob
lems are not unique to the United
States. Opportunities for careers
in service are also ripe abroad.
Matt Welch is one of six UC-
Santa Barbara grads who in 1991
started an English-language news
paper in Prague, Czechoslovakia
— copies of which are distributed
free to Czech schools for use in
English classes. The group met
while writing for their college
newspaper, The Daily Nexus.
Although the names of these stu
dents are unfamiliar to many, their
achievements are far-reaching.
There is still much to be done
before Jackson's challenge is met,
and Stanford graduates are
uniquely qualified to do it.
