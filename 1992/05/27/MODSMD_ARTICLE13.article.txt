# Cory Booker
## Looking out my window 
### 
From my window —
I saw an elderly Asian woman driving
her car. She cut me off before the last
light. In my moment of anger what did I
see? ELDERLY ASIAN WOMAN. These
feelings I cannot deny.
From her window —
What does she see? My angry stare? or
a YOUNG BLACK MALE?
It's late, and I bang on the keys of this
Daily computer for the last time. I feel a
sense of urgency.
I want to say something.
That's how I began, you know; after
five years at Stanford I felt as if I learned
so much, that I could now endeavor to
teach, inspire and enrich a community
with my profound pontifications.
But by my second column, as I raised
my noble pen to address the issue of date
rape, I realized that the person holding it
wasn't so noble after all.
With this issue as with so many oth
ers, a dash of sincere introspection has
revealed to me a dangerous gap — a gap
between my beliefs and my actions.
So for me, my columns became an
opportunity to look inward for answers
instead of outward for acclaim.
It has become a poignant ritual each
week. Sunday night from 11 p.m. until 4
a.m., 5 a.m. or even later.

I sit and mull over in my mind the
issue, my beliefs, my actions, my person
al experiences, my feelings and so on.
It's funny, but with so many of these
issues I already felt I had established the
"Cory Booker Party Line" — "Respect
women," "Gays are OK, too," "Black peo
ple need justice," etc.
However, I have come to realize that
these lines of mine are shallow manifes
tations of acceptance without internal
ization.
I may truly believe these catchy phras
es of mine — equality, peace, under
standing — but until these words and
beliefs are actualized, I am a danger to
myself.
So, from my window —
What do I see?
I see racists.
I see sexist people.
Still I look closer . . .
What do I see?
I see people steeped in hypocrisy.
I see injustice abounding.
Closer, closer I look . . .
What do I see?
I see myself.
So as my ambition rages, as I seek to
change the world —
Where shall I begin?
Shall I deny the world's problems?
Shall I deny my problems?
It has been my personal struggles that
have made me strong.

Struggling to find my identity.
Struggling with the pain of loss, fail
ure.
Struggling with private pains, often
too difficult to mention. From all of this,
I have grown stronger.
Denial is too costly.
I am a religious person, I make no
bones about that, and I have faith that if
I take more opportunities like this one to
sincerely look inward, my ability to reach
out will be greatly improved.
Thank you for reading my words, this
exercise has been invaluable. It has been
both cathartic and meditative, but most
importantly, it has been transformative.
God bless you all.
Please allow me a final note on the eve
of my graduation ... To my friends and
family who have watched me be continu
ally busy and stressed for five years: I am
sorry I've often given you the short end of
the time stick.
You have made it all possible and
worthwhile. Thank you for your love and
patience.
I am truly blessed.

Cory is a co-terminal student in sociolo
gy; this is his last column.
