BSU leader confronts the multiculturalism backlash

Ever since my freshman year, I
have listened to Stanford students
complain about multicultural edu
cation; now it's my turn to comment on
the complaints.
First and foremost, I don't think Res
idential Education has shoved anything
down residents' throats. Most of the pro
gramming that occurs in dorms have
general-interest themes.
I don't remember anyone lecturing on
the necessity of affirmative action or the
changing identity of African-Americans.
If Res Ed were truly forcing multicul
turalism, then I would think that a
mandatory visit to all of the theme hous
es would be an appropriate vehicle, and I
am referring to academic themes as well.
Or maybe there would be weekly pre
sentations showing the oppression of
blacks in our history, beginning with the
exclusion of our citizenship in the Con
stitution. (If you are unaware, blacks
were designated as three-fifths of a citi
zen in our, or should I say your, found
ing document.)
Most students have never been to a
theme house, let alone a program in one
of those dorms, and yet they claim that

its mere existence accounts for some
injustice to them. Why don't you and
Rodney King compare your experiences
and see how they measure up?
To be honest, as a black student, I
feel that Stanford can do much more to
fulfill their agenda. The Fire Within, for
example, was a healthy program which I
believe was misunderstood by many
white students.
I felt that the speeches, while very
bold, were quite empowering. They high
lighted the oppression as well as tri
umphs of the American past and illus
trated the speakers' connections to their
past which inspired them to seek the
needed changes for the future.
The presentation, in general, was a
discussion of history from the excluded
and undesired perspective â€” that of the
disadvantaged.
If some white students felt guilty, I
wonder why. I only feel guilty about
things which I had some role in either
creating or maintaining.
Those students who did not like the
program because they felt uncomfort
able should question why they felt that
way, and whether or not they want to

change that.
I believe that being uncomfortable is
one necessary aspect of exploring differ
ence in any environment.
Consider how I as a black woman feel
every day here at Stanford, surrounded
by white people and learning more about
white history.
Consider how I feel when contribu
tions and writings of African-Americans
are belittled in supposedly enlightened
and inclusive curriculums.
When was the last time that the
accomplishments of anyone but white
people were heralded at this university?
(For fairness, I must exclude any pro
grams put on by student of color groups.)
Yet this country is built upon the
struggles and contributions of numerous
cultures.
Every time you listen to Madonna,
watch television, read Aristotle or hit a
high-five shooting hoops, you are shar
ing in the bounty of African-American
heritage and culture.
I want you, Stanford, to know the
complete American past and present,
which includes African-American lead
ers, intellectuals and artists as well as

those of the mainstream.
Both William Buckley and Amiri
Baraka were at Stanford last week. I
would be willing to guess that most
Stanford students do not know who
Baraka is, but most have vague ideas
about Buckley.
If we want to consider ourselves
among the most educated, we should
know both, because they have made sig
nificant contributions to our society.
The truth about our environment is
simple: For those who don't want multi
culturalism, you don't have it, and for
those who do, you have it too.
Stanford only presents the opportuni
ty for exposure to different cultures and
experiences; the rest is up to you.
Are you the future leaders (scary
thought) of America up to the challenge
of giving and expecting the respect of all
Americans, not just the privileged few?
If you are, then start acting like it,
and if you are not, stop your complain
ing and continue to suck on your silver
spoon. Or is that your thumb?
