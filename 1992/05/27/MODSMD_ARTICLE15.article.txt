# Contributor justifies spending money for ad
## 
### 
In the May 19th Daily, medical stu
dent Ben Ortiz criticized the actions of
700 people who contributed to a New
York Times ad protesting the King beat
ing verdict.
Evidently, he believes they were moti
vated by the urge to get their names in
print, for which purpose they wasted
money that could have been better
spent.
As one of the people he so gratuitous
ly insulted, I feel I have more insight on
these matters than he does.

First of all, it is not true that "not one of
those 700 people could think of anything
better to do with their money."
Many of us did quite a bit in response to
the tragedy of the King verdict and the vio
lence that followed. The ad contributions
were over and above these other things.
Secondly, Ortiz overestimates what
the money involved could have done if
utilized differently.
Most of us contributed $25, which
won't do much to fight injustice no mat
ter how it's spent.
The combined contributions can't
really do much more.
The total $19,000 sounds like a lot,
but spread it among more than just a
few people and it doesn't go far.

It might keep a couple poor families
going for a year, but that wouldn't help
the rest of South-Central Los Angeles.
How far it would go in supporting the
education of the average Stanford medi
cal student, I don't know.
So why is Ortiz "appalled"?
Those of us who contributed the
money thought we were doing some
thing good.
I still think so. No one believes it is
enough to save the world, but perhaps it
will help open a few people's eyes.
Ortiz should save his outrage for
those whose bigotry and neglect caused
the recent violence.
