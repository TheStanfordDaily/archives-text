## Richards trades court for course 
### Tish Williams Staff writer 
Martha Richards has great
memories of her high school and
college careers, the highlights of
which brought her to Stanford as
one of the top three recruits in the
nation in her sport. They also saw
her as a member of a national
champion collegiate team.
With credentials like these
Richards should have total confi
dence going into the NCAA
women's golf championships held
this week in Arizona.
But her credentials are in bas
ketball.
Coming to Stanford as the top
high school shooting guard in the
country, Richards decided to play
basketball and golf, both of which
she played in high school. In her
sophomore year the Cardinal won
the national championship in
women's basketball, realizing all
the dreams and expectations
Richards had envisioned of colle
giate basketball.
Fortunately for the women's
golf team, however, Richards' on
the-court experience in basketball
didn't live up to her hopes or
potential. Richards never got the
playing time that would have been
expected, and ended up playing
post against Val Whiting in prac
tice, getting out of her element as a
shooting guard.
At the end of her junior year
"the decision was made" for
Richards to concentrate exclusive
ly on golf, a sudden and surprise
move for Richards.
"My basketball career is over
with and that's fine," Richards
said. "I'm just a little bitter about
the way it was handled, but I'm
very fortunate to be playing golf at
Stanford."
Putting the basketball season
behind, Richards competed in the
spring season with the golf squad,
earning a spot to join the Cardinal
at the NCAA Championships. She
went into the tournament ranked
450 th in the nation, but pulled off
a miracle, coming in 40th out of
102 golfers.
"I could see all that ability com
ing, and I was just hoping it might
happen at NCAAs, which it did,"
coach Tim Baldwin said. "We fin
ished sixth because of her, instead
of probably thirteenth or four
teenth."
And Richards hasn't looked
back since.
Trading in her high-tops for
golf shoes, Richards has been par
ticipating in a race against time.
She is trying to gain the experience
that is so crucial in golf in order to
catch up with other collegiate
golfers who have been competing
since they were 10 or 12.
"I can show Martha a shot only
once, and she can duplicate it,"
Baldwin said. "The only thing she
really lacks is tournament experi
ence. But as for her future ... a
year from now Martha Richards
will be able to play with any player
in the country, and that includes
the top pros."
The potential is obviously there
for Richards, who has dropped her
stroke average by five strokes since
last season, ranking her 58 nation

ally among collegiate golfers.
Richards has been on fire this
spring season, finishing no worse
than eighth individually in any
tournament, as well as finishing
seventh in the Pacific 10 Champi
onships.
But the transition from basket
ball to golf has understandably
been a strange one, going from a
contact sport to one which involves
the utmost concentration with less
emphasis on athletic power than
on skill and experience. The sports
also have very different images in
the sports community, but
Richards will readily attest to the
difficulty of golf.
"(Golf) is not the leisurely,
recreational sport that it's made
out to be," Richards stressed. "I've
seen some of the best athletes
humbled down at the driving
range. I have to get my game ready
for tournaments, not just get the
ball airborne.
"My friends give me a hard time
when I say that I've had a really
tough practice. I'm not winded,
aerobically, but I'm stressed out.
To sit there for three hours and hit
shot after shot .... I'm mentally
drained."
It is the mental challenge of golf,
including concentration, focus and
psychological endurance, that
Martha has been working on in the
past year, readying for a spot as one
of the best collegiate golfers.
"The biggest transition from
basketball to golf was learning how
to concentrate for four hours
I'd hit the fourteenth hole and all

hell would break loose," Richards
grinned, remembering the good
old days.
Since then, she has focused on
pre-shot technique that helps her
concentrate on each individual
stroke, pulling her game together.
She enjoys the progress she's mak
ing, picking up new techniques
and managing the mental chal
lenges of 18 holes of golf.
"The best part is learning new
shots and being able to execute
them," she said. "To say 'I've prac
ticed this shot, I'm trying it' and to
have it work. Then you've done it
in a pressure situation and as
(coach Baldwin) says 'you've got it
in your bag."'
But there is that little problem
of temper flare-ups, which can be
understood, remembering that
Richards started out on the bas
ketball courts.
"Getting my aggressiveness — I
like to call it that, not temper —
under control has been the hardest
part for me, mentally," Richards
laughed. "In basketball you can
run down to the end of the court
and throw an elbow or something."
That's all under control, howev
er. Not to assume that she doesn't
get angry on the course, but just
that she knows how to handle situ
ations like a golfer, not a basket
ball player.
"I still have my days when I'd
like to break a club," Richards
said. "I think it'd be a good little
invention to have a bunch of old
clubs, after each hole, just to
smash against a tree."

As for basketball, Richards still
plays every day, shooting hoops in
pickup games with her friends,
who were there for her during the
transition period. She gets out her
frustration on the basketball court
and keeps herself in shape for the
golf course.
"Her strength is still her bas
ketball," Baldwin said. "She still
plays basketball every day, some
thing that I really encourage,
maintaining her superior athletic
ability, speed and coordination,
which enable her to hit shots that
other people just can't hit."
Richards is the first to admit
that she misses basketball, but says
she has no doubts about the posi
tive atmosphere of the women's
golf team and coach Baldwin.
"I'm done with basketball,"
Richards stressed. "I do miss the
game. . . the crowd cheering, going
out for warm ups, having your
name announced. But now golf is
my thing .... I like golf in com
parison to basketball because your
score speaks for itself. "
And so far this year, she has
gotten the good scores, giving
coach Baldwin the confidence to
foresee a top-10 individual finish
for Richards this week at NCAA's.
Richards hopes to go pro after
one more year of developing her
game. Possibly by the beginning of
her pro career she'll have some
new memories of athletic achieve
ment, of number-one rankings and
national championships.
Only these will be on the golf
course, on her terms.

golf shoes, Richards has been par
ticipating in a race against time.
She is trying to gain the experience
that is so crucial in golf in order to
catch up with other collegiate
golfers who have been competing
since they were 10 or 12.
"I can show Martha a shot only
once, and she can duplicate it,"
Baldwin said. "The only thing she
really lacks is tournament experi
ence. But as for her future ... a
year from now Martha Richards
will be able to play with any player
in the country, and that includes
the top pros."
The potential is obviously there
for Richards, who has dropped her
stroke average by five strokes since
last season, ranking her 58 nation

ally among collegiate golfers.
Richards has been on fire this
spring season, finishing no worse
than eighth individually in any
tournament, as well as finishing
seventh in the Pacific 10 Champi
onships.
But the transition from basket
ball to golf has understandably
been a strange one, going from a
contact sport to one which involves
the utmost concentration with less
emphasis on athletic power than
on skill and experience. The sports
also have very different images in
the sports community, but
Richards will readily attest to the
difficulty of golf.
"(Golf) is not the leisurely,
recreational sport that it's made
out to be," Richards stressed. "I've
seen some of the best athletes
humbled down at the driving
range. I have to get my game ready
for tournaments, not just get the
ball airborne.
"My friends give me a hard time
when I say that I've had a really
tough practice. I'm not winded,
aerobically, but I'm stressed out.
To sit there for three hours and hit
shot after shot .... I'm mentally
drained."
It is the mental challenge of golf,
including concentration, focus and
psychological endurance, that
Martha has been working on in the
past year, readying for a spot as one
of the best collegiate golfers.
"The biggest transition from
basketball to golf was learning how
to concentrate for four hours
I'd hit the fourteenth hole and all

hell would break loose," Richards
grinned, remembering the good
old days.
Since then, she has focused on
pre-shot technique that helps her
concentrate on each individual
stroke, pulling her game together.
She enjoys the progress she's mak
ing, picking up new techniques
and managing the mental chal
lenges of 18 holes of golf.
"The best part is learning new
shots and being able to execute
them," she said. "To say 'I've prac
ticed this shot, I'm trying it' and to
have it work. Then you've done it
in a pressure situation and as
(coach Baldwin) says 'you've got it
in your bag."'
But there is that little problem
of temper flare-ups, which can be
understood, remembering that
Richards started out on the bas
ketball courts.
"Getting my aggressiveness — I
like to call it that, not temper —
under control has been the hardest
part for me, mentally," Richards
laughed. "In basketball you can
run down to the end of the court
and throw an elbow or something."
That's all under control, howev
er. Not to assume that she doesn't
get angry on the course, but just
that she knows how to handle situ
ations like a golfer, not a basket
ball player.
"I still have my days when I'd
like to break a club," Richards
said. "I think it'd be a good little
invention to have a bunch of old
clubs, after each hole, just to
smash against a tree."

As for basketball, Richards still
plays every day, shooting hoops in
pickup games with her friends,
who were there for her during the
transition period. She gets out her
frustration on the basketball court
and keeps herself in shape for the
golf course.
"Her strength is still her bas
ketball," Baldwin said. "She still
plays basketball every day, some
thing that I really encourage,
maintaining her superior athletic
ability, speed and coordination,
which enable her to hit shots that
other people just can't hit."
Richards is the first to admit
that she misses basketball, but says
she has no doubts about the posi
tive atmosphere of the women's
golf team and coach Baldwin.
"I'm done with basketball,"
Richards stressed. "I do miss the
game. . . the crowd cheering, going
out for warm ups, having your
name announced. But now golf is
my thing .... I like golf in com
parison to basketball because your
score speaks for itself. "
And so far this year, she has
gotten the good scores, giving
coach Baldwin the confidence to
foresee a top-10 individual finish
for Richards this week at NCAA's.
Richards hopes to go pro after
one more year of developing her
game. Possibly by the beginning of
her pro career she'll have some
new memories of athletic achieve
ment, of number-one rankings and
national championships.
Only these will be on the golf
course, on her terms.

After initially tackling two sports, Martha Richards now concentrates solely on golf. She is competing
in the NCAA Championships this week in Tempe, Ariz.
Martha Richards has great
memories of her high school and
college careers, the highlights of
which brought her to Stanford as
one of the top three recruits in the
nation in her sport. They also saw
her as a member of a national
champion collegiate team.
With credentials like these
Richards should have total confi
dence going into the NCAA
women's golf championships held
this week in Arizona.
But her credentials are in bas
ketball.
Coming to Stanford as the top
high school shooting guard in the
country, Richards decided to play
basketball and golf, both of which
she played in high school. In her
sophomore year the Cardinal won
the national championship in
women's basketball, realizing all
the dreams and expectations
Richards had envisioned of colle
giate basketball.
Fortunately for the women's
golf team, however, Richards' on
the-court experience in basketball
didn't live up to her hopes or
potential. Richards never got the
playing time that would have been
expected, and ended up playing
post against Val Whiting in prac
tice, getting out of her element as a
shooting guard.
At the end of her junior year
"the decision was made" for
Richards to concentrate exclusive
ly on golf, a sudden and surprise
move for Richards.
"My basketball career is over
with and that's fine," Richards
said. "I'm just a little bitter about
the way it was handled, but I'm
very fortunate to be playing golf at
Stanford."
Putting the basketball season
behind, Richards competed in the
spring season with the golf squad,
earning a spot to join the Cardinal
at the NCAA Championships. She
went into the tournament ranked
450 th in the nation, but pulled off
a miracle, coming in 40th out of
102 golfers.
"I could see all that ability com
ing, and I was just hoping it might
happen at NCAAs, which it did,"
coach Tim Baldwin said. "We fin
ished sixth because of her, instead
of probably thirteenth or four
teenth."
And Richards hasn't looked
back since.
