# Golfers head to NCAA Tourney
## 
### Tish Williams Staff writer 
Putting aside Dead Week
and finals worries, the Stanford
women's golf team has only one
objective today: to start out
with a bang. If the Cardinal fin
ishes the first round of the
NCAA Championships in the
money, then prospects are good
for a top-three finish, coach
Tim Baldwin said.
NCAA tournament play
begins today on the challenging
Karsten Golf Course, the home
course of Arizona State, with
Stanford entered as the fourth
seed against some of the best
teams ever featured in the tour
nament.
"Arizona and San Jose State
both have the best teams
they've ever had," Baldwin
said. "So do we, and Georgia
too. All the top teams in the
nation have their best teams
ever."
Arizona's amazing squad
leads the field in the rankings,
with San Jose State close
behind and Georgia one slot
ahead of the Cardinal in third.
This week will feature some
top-notch golf, and with a little
luck Stanford will be right up
there with the best.
The Stanford squad changes
each tournament, but this week
will include the same players
who played in the Cardinal's
last competition, providing
something of a sense of stabili
ty.
The Cardinal five will be led
by Audrey Wooding in the num
ber one spot, followed by Adele
Moore, Martha Richards,
Melinda Daniels and freshman
Amy Lawrence.
Wooding and Richards
played solidly all spring and are
both in the running for a top
ten individual finish. Moore led
the Cardinal during the fall sea
son, but lost the number-one
spot this spring and hopes to
bounce back this week.

Jose State have the

Daniels and Lawrence had
exceptional final rounds in the
last tournament before
NCAA's, giving them momen
tum for this week's champi
onships.
Stanford has demonstrated
that it is a serious threat to
both Arizona and San Jose
State so far this spring, compet
ing against both powerhouses
of the Far West region in earli
er tournaments. The only pos
sible problem for the Cardinal
could be a slow start, allowing
the leaders to slip away.
"My only hope is that Ari
zona and San Jose State don't
come out of the blocks really
hot," Baldwin said. "Then our
team will be able to apply some
pressure."
Stanford is one of the most
consistent teams in the nation,
but the top two teams have
been known to come out with
phenomenal first rounds, leav
ing the Cardinal to play catch
up.
"We've shown that on any
given day we're good enough to
beat them, but we've got to play
four days," junior Martha
Richards said.
According to Baldwin, Stan
ford has benefitted from a
tough season's play, as this
year the Far West region
undoubtedly dominates the
golfing hierarchy. Of the top 12
teams featured in this week's
tourney, six come from the Far
West, teams that Stanford has
been playing all year.
Coach Baldwin is hoping for
a highly respectable top-five
finish, with the possibility of a
top-three performance as ideal.
