A freshman was removed from his dor
mitory last week after being implicated in
several thefts, according to Angela Rick
ford, residence dean for Stern and Wilbur
Halls.
Rickford said the student is under
investigation by Stanford Police regarding
theft of compact discs from dormmates in
Donner as well as from residents of
Larkin, an adjacent dorm. He was moved
to a guest cottage in Governor's Corner
last week.
According to Stanford Police Sgt.
Richard Tipton, the thefts occurred May
19 and were reported to the police the next
day. He said the police presented a report
on the case to the District Attorney yester
day and expect the DA to file charges
against the student today.
Tipton said police will not release the
student's name until charges are filed.
Donner Resident Fellow Linda Paulson
said she contacted the police after several
students told her about the thefts. "Once

they figured out [the thefts] had hap
pened, they came to me and ... we called
the police," she said.
According to Rickford, the student
admitted to committing the thefts and try
ing to resell the CDs to local stores in an
interview with her late last week.
The student came under suspicion
because "he did not really [try to resell the
discs] in a very clandestine manner. ... I
don't think he's a seasoned thief," Rick
ford said.
Paulson said the student apparently did
not force his way into dorm rooms during
the burglaries. "A lot of doors in dorms are
left open," she said.
Freshman Felice Wu said six CDs were
stolen from her room during lunch time
Tuesday, when she left her door unlocked.
Wu said she was "very, very angry"
when she discovered the theft. "It was real
ly frustrating and when I found out it was
someone in the dorm, it was nauseating."
Six students were listed as victims in
the police log.
