# Senior bids fond farewell to Stanford
## 
### 
My earliest perceptions of Stanford
were shaped by athletic events.
Games on the Farm sparked my
childhood interest in athletics — I want
ed to be the next John Elway or Keith
Jones — but more importantly they
addicted me to Stanford University.
I attended my first Stanford game in
September, 1978, when Bill Walsh's foot
ball team hosted the fierce Oklahoma
Sooners.
Although Stanford lost 35-29, I was
hooked by sun-splashed Stanford Stadi
um, Steve Dils' dazzling passing and the
truly incomparable Stanford band. In the
past 14 years I have missed only a handful
of games (out of the country twice, violin
camp, soccer tournament, pneumonia and
Paul Wiggin play calling are my excused
absences). As a Stanford brat I was an
occasional ball-boy for the basketball team
and a cheap-seat regular at Sunken Dia
mond. But soon my carefree childhood
days will end and I will be paying the full
fare ticket price of a Stanford alumnus.
My final 18 days at Stanford will be
filled with anxiety, excitement and
agony. This is the campus where I was
born, constructed my first sand castles,
confessed my first love and faced my first
failure. Leaving is even more difficult
than writing this, my final Daily column.
As I graduate from the Farm, many of
my fondest memories — the Toyon Quad
from Hell, Sociology 5, bad white wine
with good friends — have nothing to do
with Stanford sports. But as a Cardinal
fanatic, sports reporter and the intramu
ral sports director, much of my time has
been spent in the athletic department.
When I dream of Stanford, I envision a
grassy playground where the sun will
always shine.

As a Daily sports columnist I've had
the opportunity to observe and randomly
comment on Stanford sports. Although
at least one flanker and one chemistry
graduate student, neither with a sense of
humor, would like to serve me to a hun
gry bear, I've enjoyed writing this col
umn and sharing my visions. My memo
ries of Stanford sports successes the past
four years:
The tennis teams won six team titles.
The women's basketball team and amaz
ing Jennifer Azzi toppled defending

champion Tennessee 85-71 to spring
onto the national scene and went on to
win the first of many titles.
The men's basketball team repeated
the Miracle at Maples, ambushing Ari
zona after trailing 21-4. The Cardinal
went on to break a 47-year jinx by reach
ing the NCAA Tournament, then
returned this year thanks to senior Adam
Keefe.
A tough-nosed guy named Tommy
Vardell scored four touchdowns, giving
the football team its first road win since
1987 in a stunning 36-31 triumph over
No. 1 Notre Dame. Tuan Van Le blocked
a point-blank field goal to save the Axe.
Two years later, The Play was avenged in

12 sweet seconds at Berkeley's Memorial
Stadium.
The women's soccer team improved
from 4-10-4 in 1987 to shoot for a nation
al title in 1993. The Betas banded around
Chris Toft to win an IM title in 1991.
There are too many stories to remember
them all.
Stanford has won so many NCAA
titles that the memories bleed. In five
years I won't be able to recall when I
watched the men's volleyball team play
UCLA in Pauley Pavilion for the NCAA
title. Fortunately, I'll probably forget
that we lost. Selective memory is always
a winner.
The memories that will not fade are
the special people I've met along the way.
Tight end/Daily columnist Cory Booker
made a great touchdown catch in some
football game that I've all but forgotten
and is famous for being a Rhodes Schol
ar, but I will remember him for his per
sonal compassion, dorm massage work
shops and entertaining play on the IM
basketball courts.
Michele Sullivan competed in soccer,
bicycling and crew at Stanford, and
would have been a star in roller-blading if
there were a team. To me, she is more an
important lesson in intensity, dedication
and liberty.
Although I was originally attracted by
the awesome athletics, it is the people —
whether punters, pianists or painters —
that make Stanford unforgettable.
Good-bye.

Nat Cousins is a graduating senior in
political science. The true zenith of his
athletic career (thank you Laura Wilkes)
will be winning the IM 2-on-2 coed bas
ketball title this week.

My earliest perceptions of Stanford
were shaped by athletic events.
Games on the Farm sparked my
childhood interest in athletics — I want
ed to be the next John Elway or Keith
Jones — but more importantly they
addicted me to Stanford University.
I attended my first Stanford game in
September, 1978, when Bill Walsh's foot
ball team hosted the fierce Oklahoma
Sooners.
Although Stanford lost 35-29, I was
hooked by sun-splashed Stanford Stadi
um, Steve Dils' dazzling passing and the
truly incomparable Stanford band. In the
past 14 years I have missed only a handful
of games (out of the country twice, violin
camp, soccer tournament, pneumonia and
Paul Wiggin play calling are my excused
absences). As a Stanford brat I was an
occasional ball-boy for the basketball team
and a cheap-seat regular at Sunken Dia
mond. But soon my carefree childhood
days will end and I will be paying the full
fare ticket price of a Stanford alumnus.
My final 18 days at Stanford will be
filled with anxiety, excitement and
agony. This is the campus where I was
born, constructed my first sand castles,
confessed my first love and faced my first
failure. Leaving is even more difficult
than writing this, my final Daily column.
As I graduate from the Farm, many of
my fondest memories — the Toyon Quad
from Hell, Sociology 5, bad white wine
with good friends — have nothing to do
with Stanford sports. But as a Cardinal
fanatic, sports reporter and the intramu
ral sports director, much of my time has
been spent in the athletic department.
When I dream of Stanford, I envision a
grassy playground where the sun will
always shine.

As a Daily sports columnist I've had
the opportunity to observe and randomly
comment on Stanford sports. Although
at least one flanker and one chemistry
graduate student, neither with a sense of
humor, would like to serve me to a hun
gry bear, I've enjoyed writing this col
umn and sharing my visions. My memo
ries of Stanford sports successes the past
four years:
The tennis teams won six team titles.
The women's basketball team and amaz
ing Jennifer Azzi toppled defending

champion Tennessee 85-71 to spring
onto the national scene and went on to
win the first of many titles.
The men's basketball team repeated
the Miracle at Maples, ambushing Ari
zona after trailing 21-4. The Cardinal
went on to break a 47-year jinx by reach
ing the NCAA Tournament, then
returned this year thanks to senior Adam
Keefe.
A tough-nosed guy named Tommy
Vardell scored four touchdowns, giving
the football team its first road win since
1987 in a stunning 36-31 triumph over
No. 1 Notre Dame. Tuan Van Le blocked
a point-blank field goal to save the Axe.
Two years later, The Play was avenged in

12 sweet seconds at Berkeley's Memorial
Stadium.
The women's soccer team improved
from 4-10-4 in 1987 to shoot for a nation
al title in 1993. The Betas banded around
Chris Toft to win an IM title in 1991.
There are too many stories to remember
them all.
Stanford has won so many NCAA
titles that the memories bleed. In five
years I won't be able to recall when I
watched the men's volleyball team play
UCLA in Pauley Pavilion for the NCAA
title. Fortunately, I'll probably forget
that we lost. Selective memory is always
a winner.
The memories that will not fade are
the special people I've met along the way.
Tight end/Daily columnist Cory Booker
made a great touchdown catch in some
football game that I've all but forgotten
and is famous for being a Rhodes Schol
ar, but I will remember him for his per
sonal compassion, dorm massage work
shops and entertaining play on the IM
basketball courts.
Michele Sullivan competed in soccer,
bicycling and crew at Stanford, and
would have been a star in roller-blading if
there were a team. To me, she is more an
important lesson in intensity, dedication
and liberty.
Although I was originally attracted by
the awesome athletics, it is the people —
whether punters, pianists or painters —
that make Stanford unforgettable.
Good-bye.

Nat Cousins is a graduating senior in
political science. The true zenith of his
athletic career (thank you Laura Wilkes)
will be winning the IM 2-on-2 coed bas
ketball title this week.
