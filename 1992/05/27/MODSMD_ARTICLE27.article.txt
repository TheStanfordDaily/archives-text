VZV • when their surroundings are
corner? For example, if I put a soda or
beer can in the freezer, will it chill
faster than if I had put it in the
fridge? Also, why do metal containers
get colder in the fridge than plastic
ones?
— Mr. Heat Miser
A. Thanks for your question,
• Heat. I've often wondered what
it would be like to be a fuzzy, and
your confusion on this elementary
issue gives me some idea.
To confer something of the trans
parency of this issue to you, I'll haz
ard a guess that you're the right
brain type and begin my answer with
some intuitive reasons why I must
answer your first question in the
affirmative.
If the rate of cooling (i.e., the rate
of heat energy flow from a warm body
to a colder one) were independent of
the temperature difference between
an object and its surroundings, the
following would all be true:
• It would be as safe for you to
swim buck naked in the North Sea as
it was for me to do so in, say, Lake
Lag last night;
• The physics demonstration
(which you probably missed while
taking Gender Studies and Anthro
pology classes) in which a professor
plunges a rubber ball into liquid
nitrogen and then smashes it against
a wall would be impractical, because
the ball would take a really long time
to freeze; and
• A beer would chill just as fast in
the refrigerator as it would it the
freezer.
None of these examples sound
real, of course, because the rate of
heat flow from one object to another
is dependent on the temperature dif
ference between the two objects in
question.
The engineers among the reader
ship will be titillated to know that
this dependence is expressed simply
by a petite equation known to the
sages as Fourier's Law. (Yes, the
Fourier, the same Frog responsible
for those lovely transforms that so
many EEs will learn to love and hate
over the next few years.) Fourier's
Law states, concisely enough, that
Q = KAAT
L
where Q, the rate of heat transfer
between two bodies, is related to K,
the conductance (of the beer can, for
example); A, the area of the can; L,
the thickness of the can walls — and
AT, the temperature difference
between the bodies.

The beer can question posed by
this week's generous contributor is
easily framed in terms of Fourier's
Law. Suppose you have two identical
cans of Bergermeister, both initially
at room temperature, and you put
one in the fridge and the other in the
freezer. Since K, A, and L are the
same for both cans, and AT is larger
between kitchen and freezer than
between kitchen and fridge, the beer
you put next to the popsicles will chill
more rapidly — voila! better living
through science.
This approach is not without its
hazards, however. If you forget the
beer in the freezer, it will eventually
freeze, rupture the can and give you a
chance to find out first-hand why
Barley'n'Hops Ripple will never be
Flavor of the Month.
Fortuitously, Fourier's Law also
has something to say about why
chilled metal cans feel cooler to the
touch than plastic containers of the
same temperature.
(Note: Despite Mr. Miser's some
what misleading query, metal con
tainers do not "get colder in the
fridge" than plastic ones. A fairly
straightforward argument invoking
the Second Law of Thermodynamics
tells us that given enough time,
everything in a refrigeration com
partment will equilibrate to the same
n
Here, the difference between our
two hypothetical cans is not AT but
K, the conductance of the container
walls. Because plastic has a signifi
cantly lower heat conductance than
metal, the rate of heat flow from your
hand to a plastic container will be
slower. Ergo, it doesn't feel as cold.

Chris Pcitil knows nothing else about
beer because he is underage. Next
week is the last Bug for three and a
half months, so you 'd better hurry up
and get your questions into the Bug
Box, located just outside The Daily
offices — or remain confused all
summer.
