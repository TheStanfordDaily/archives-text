# Students advocate ecological housing
## Eco-house group shifts focus from theme house to reform of building standards 
### Markley Bavinger 
A student group championing sustain
able living on campus is working with the
University to incorporate environmental
ly conscious building practices in all new
construction.
Originally begun to convince adminis
trators to construct an eco-house on the
Knoll site, the group suffered a setback
earlier this month when a University
housing panel did not recommend the
theme house be created.
The group was promoting an eco-house
including built-in composting and recy
cling facilities requiring continuous
maintenance by residents.
Despite the negative recommendation,
the group has helped to write an amend
ment to the Knoll site's development
plans changing Stanford's building policy
to require environmentally conscious
design in new campus construction.
This amendment approved by Facili
ties Project Management mandates that
each residence incorporate design ele
ments which use resources efficiently, are
conducive to community building and
allow for the application of appropriate
technology. Such technology includes
efficient heating, lighting and water sys
tems along with effective day lighting and
energy efficient superwindows.
If these new standards had been in
place during the construction of Kimball
Hall, more attention might have been
placed on the building's energy efficiency,
according to Myia Johnson, head of the
eco-house group.
Kimball's plans did not incorporate
some basic energy design principles, she
said, such as maximizing the number of
south-facing windows to allow for direct
solar heating and constructing heat-stor
ing walls to improve insulation.
The group continues to advocate that
the University go beyond these standards
in the development of the proposed Knoll
site row house. In addition, the group is
trying to show the University there is stu
dent interest to warrant an environmen
tal theme. Ideally, this house will serve as
an educational model of minimum impact
living practices, Johnson said.
Such a house is meant to "create
spaces that are more conducive to learn
ing ways of living more gently on this
planet," Johnson said. It would also serve
as a center for the research, demonstra
tion and education of self-reliant living
practices.
Such houses are found at several other
colleges and universities. At these institu
tions, students independently investigate
and implement new technologies in their
homes.
For example, California State Poly
technic University is building a 16-acre
facility called the Institute for Regenera
tive Studies.
This building will come complete with
gardens to supply food and solar paneling
and other alternative energy sources to

meet the energy requirements of the 90
residents. The facility will also regulate
its own thermal environment and recycle
its own waste.
In 1978, Humboldt State University
1 1 _ l. 1 1

leased a house sched
uled for demolition to
a group of students
who have since trans
formed it into the
Campus Center for
Appropriate Technol
ogy.
This laboratory home
showcases minimum
impact appliances and
systems,such as a
clock powered by a
potato and a student-

built solar oven capable of reaching 300
degrees.
A publication produced by the Hum
boldt students describes their home as
"more than just a demonstration of
appropriate technologies. It is an embodi
ment of appropriate technology philoso
phy, a realization of the finiteness of the
natural resource supplies most funda
mental to daily life."

'[The eco-house is
meant to] create spaces
that are more conducive
to learning ways of liv
ing more gently on this
planet.'

If the Knoll site is used for a project
like this, funding for house projects may
come from public enterprises and private
businesses, Johnson said, which have
been quick to support efforts at other uni-

versities by do
nating resources
and research
materials.
While awaiting
the fate of the
row house, group
members are cur
rently collaborat
ing with profes
sors from Stan
ford and other
universities on
plans to begin a

focus group next year.
The focus group will be involved in
activities that explore the practices and
technologies of sustainable living, John
son said.
Plans for the focus group include con
tinued involvement with the planning of
student housing, research into the prac
tices and meanings of sustainability and
the development of outreach activities.

This amendment approved by Facili
ties Project Management mandates that
each residence incorporate design ele
ments which use resources efficiently, are
conducive to community building and
allow for the application of appropriate
technology. Such technology includes
efficient heating, lighting and water sys
tems along with effective day lighting and
energy efficient superwindows.
If these new standards had been in
place during the construction of Kimball
Hall, more attention might have been
placed on the building's energy efficiency,
according to Myia Johnson, head of the
eco-house group.
Kimball's plans did not incorporate
some basic energy design principles, she
said, such as maximizing the number of
south-facing windows to allow for direct
solar heating and constructing heat-stor
ing walls to improve insulation.
The group continues to advocate that
the University go beyond these standards
in the development of the proposed Knoll
site row house. In addition, the group is
trying to show the University there is stu
dent interest to warrant an environmen
tal theme. Ideally, this house will serve as
an educational model of minimum impact
living practices, Johnson said.
Such a house is meant to "create
spaces that are more conducive to learn
ing ways of living more gently on this
planet," Johnson said. It would also serve
as a center for the research, demonstra
tion and education of self-reliant living
practices.
Such houses are found at several other
colleges and universities. At these institu
tions, students independently investigate
and implement new technologies in their
homes.
For example, California State Poly
technic University is building a 16-acre
facility called the Institute for Regenera
tive Studies.
This building will come complete with
gardens to supply food and solar paneling
and other alternative energy sources to

meet the energy requirements of the 90
residents. The facility will also regulate
its own thermal environment and recycle
its own waste.
In 1978, Humboldt State University

leased a house sched
uled for demolition to
a group of students
who have since trans
formed it into the
Campus Center for
Appropriate Technol
ogy.
This laboratory home
showcases minimum
impact appliances and
systems,such as a
clock powered by a
potato and a student-

built solar oven capable of reaching 300
degrees.
A publication produced by the Hum
boldt students describes their home as
"more than just a demonstration of
appropriate technologies. It is an embodi
ment of appropriate technology philoso
phy, a realization of the finiteness of the
natural resource supplies most funda
mental to daily life."

'[The eco-house is
meant to] create spaces
that are more conducive
to learning ways of liv
ing more gently on this
planet.'

If the Knoll site is used for a project
like this, funding for house projects may
come from public enterprises and private
businesses, Johnson said, which have
been quick to support efforts at other uni-

versities by do
nating resources
and research
materials.
While awaiting
the fate of the
row house, group
members are cur
rently collaborat
ing with profes
sors from Stan
ford and other
universities on
plans to begin a

focus group next year.
The focus group will be involved in
activities that explore the practices and
technologies of sustainable living, John
son said.
Plans for the focus group include con
tinued involvement with the planning of
student housing, research into the prac
tices and meanings of sustainability and
the development of outreach activities.

Senior Myia Johnson looks over the Knoll site, where new student residences are
slated to be built. Johnson's group helped to write an amendment to Stanford's
building policy requiring environmentally conscious design in new campus con
struction.
