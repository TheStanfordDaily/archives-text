# Changing the face of Stanford
## Kennedy leaves behind legacy of multiculturalism 
### Michael Friedly Senior staff writer 
On the evening of Sept. 28,
1988, two drunken white
students living in East
Lagunita pinned a defaced
poster of Beethoven to the door of a
black student's room in Ujamaa. The
picture had been transformed into a
crude caricature of a black man, with
the stereotypical large lips and afro.
The two white students only meant
the poster to be a joke. They had earli
er that day engaged in a conversation
with the black student on whether
Beethoven had African roots, and their
caricature was apparently intended
only to add their final word to the con
versation.
But the poster, of course, had a very
different effect the next day when the
black student opened his door. Ujamaa
quickly became embroiled in an ugly
flare-up of racial tension, as another
poster — this one with the word "nig
ger" scrawled across it — appeared in
Ujamaa, supposedly the safe haven for
African-Americans on campus.
Although the now-famous "Ujamaa
incident" was not a typical example of

racial relations at Stanford, it never
theless defined much of the campus
discussion in the years to come. It also
presented University President Don
ald Kennedy with an enormous hurdle
to overcome in his goal of creating a
multicultural community at Stanford.
During his 12 years as president,
Kennedy was a prominent leader of
the multicultural movement, as he
tried to encourage the growth of racial
understanding but at the same time
restrain the ambitions of more pro
gressive students. But he modestly
credits himself only as a supporter,
rather than a leader, of the movement.
"I don't think Don was asked to
bring multiculturalism," says Greg

Ricks, Residential Education's multi
cultural educator. "I don't think Don
was asked to bring public service. . . .
But he was able to get his personal
agenda across."
Kennedy had faced hurdles like the
Ujamaa incident before, and he met
this one with the same approach, with
his personal interaction with students
and with his eloquent words that chal
lenged Stanford to overcome its diffi
culties and meet its goals.
This had been the approach that he
used as he argued for the change from
Western Culture to CIV, encouraged
the work of the University Committee
on Minority Issues and struggled to
implement change in the midst of bud
get cutbacks.
He immediately met with students
after the second, more volatile poster
appeared in Ujamaa in an attempt to
calm the racial animosity that had
bubbled to the surface. And in
response to the request of the students
he met that day, he wrote what they
hoped would be a "thoughtful paper"
on racial relations at Stanford.
His approach in his "Reflections on

Protesters who took over University President Donald Kennedy's office in 1989 demanded Kennedy move more swiftly
to implement requests that ranged from hiring an Asian-American tenure-track professor to rescinding a recently
announced tuition hike. Fifty-four students were arrested on account of the protest, the impact of which is still debated.

a Racial Understanding," as in
much of his administration, was
even-handed, as he tried to reduce
the tensions and promote under
standing among the represented
races at Stanford. He has consis
tently positioned himself as one of
many leaders of the multicultural
movement, but one who seeks to
encourage racial understanding
and at the same time temper rad
ical political agendas.
"We are among the few places
in this country in which it may be
possible to test the workability of
the multicultural existence that
will, ready or not, be the life of
Californians and Americans in
the twenty-first century,"
Kennedy wrote in his essay,
which was printed in The Daily.
"We are exposing . . . ourselves to
the risk of misunderstanding and
even, when sensitivities are vio
lated as they occasionally will be,
hostility."

While he condemned the insen
sitivity shown in the Ujamaa inci
dent, he also warned against the
dangers of dogmatism.
"Time and again we have seen
the promotion of racial under
standing linked to a more focused
— and less broadly understood
and accepted — political agenda,"
Kennedy wrote. "That kind of
load is probably too heavy for a
delicate structure to bear all at
once."
Kennedy is the first to
admit that he doesn't
deserve all the credit for
many of the multicultur
al changes at Stanford during the
past 12 years.
"I do believe I gave it support,"
he says."I also tried to give it
some restraints. From time to
time I indicated a worry that mul
ticulturalism would become a
kind of political ideology of its
own."
Keith Archuleta, director of

the Black Community Services
Center, says that nevertheless,
Kennedy should receive credit for
the changes made during his
tenure.
"John F. Kennedy didn't build
any spaceships or train any astro
nauts, but he did get credit for
sending someone to the moon. It's
the same with President
Kennedy," Archuleta says. "As a
university president, he did what
he could do, which was to create a
vision."
The Ujamaa incident provided
a somewhat representative
glimpse into Kennedy's leader
ship style in the multicultural
movement at Stanford. Through
out his administration, Kennedy
has ventured to meet with stu
dents to hear their concerns and
has set the tone for discussion in
public statements such as his
"Reflections on a Racial Under
standing."
"He's not afraid to roll up his
sleeves and sit down on the floor

and talk to students," says Dean
of Students Michael Jackson.
"He was very much a support
er, especially of the different com
munities," says former Black Stu
dent Union chair Bacardi Jack
son. "He met with us every quar
ter he was here."
"You know he cared about stu
dents," says Ricks. "You know he
cared about humanity. . . . Don
Kennedy was driven by values
and not by dollars."
As president, Kennedy has con
sistently warned against extremi
ty on both sides of the struggle
and campaigned for open dialogue
and debate. Multiculturalism,
according to Kennedy, should not
be characterized by the alienation
of communities, polarized debate
and extreme tactics. "Creative
experimentation with intermedi
ates is, in my judgment, more
promising," he wrote in his essay.
Many administrators and fac
ulty view Kennedy as the symbol
ic leader of the multicultural
movement at Stanford. According
to Archuleta, Kennedy is the
"moral, spiritual leader" of multi
culturalism, in large part because
he set the tone for the struggle.
"He set in motion serious
attention to the issues of multi
culturalism," says Sharon Parker,
director of the Office of Multicul
tural Development. "I wouldn't
be here if it were not for Don
Kennedy's leadership on multi
culturalism."
Says History Prof. A 1 Camaril
lo, "I think that on the whole his
very vocal leadership on the ques
tion of the importance of multi
culturalism ... is a critical, very
fundamental contribution to this
University."
But Kennedy gives himself
far less credit for the
multicultural movement
than his colleagues do,
instead calling multiculturalism a
result of "institutional momen
tum."
"My own belief is that this was
a direction Stanford was taking,
was inclined to take, because of
where it was in the world and
because of a spiritual direction
that I think is alive here without
encouragement," Kennedy says.
"But I do think sometimes that
the task of leadership is to reflect
the best values of the community
back to itself and to provide a con
stant reminder about those values
in the direction of the institu
tion."
By many standards, the Uni
versity has moved a long way
from the time when Kennedy first
came on the scene as Stanford's
president, although the pace and
direction of change has been criti
cized from all sides.
Many of his early years as pres
ident set the stage for the move
ment as multiculturalism began
to gain momentum. But it was
only in the late 1980s that the
movement began to effect dra
matic change and gain nationwide
attention.
The ground-breaking 1989
report of the University Commit
tee on Minority Issues established
the model for change at Stanford,
as it set forth 117 concrete recom
mendations for the University to
implement. The committee spent
18 months studying the environ
ment at Stanford for people of
color, and concluded that the Uni
versity had a long way to go to
make sure all communities felt
comfortable.
"What UCMI did was it did an
incredible investigatory study of
this place, ... of disempowered
people," Ricks says.

Kennedy encouraged the work
of the UCMI, at one point assur
ing Camariilo, its chair, that he
should alert the president's office
if the committee needed addition
al resources.
"It is that type of concrete sup
port" that characterized Kennedy's
administration, Camariilo says.
"He gave a very sincere response to
the UCMI."
"I was happy to see the
UCMI," says Bacardi Jackson,
who served on the UCMI annual
review panel. But "I think a lot
more has to be done around that
report."
Jackson was one of many stu
dents, faculty and staff who pres
sured Kennedy to immediately
implement the UCMI's recom
mendations. However, the Uni
versity's emphasis in the last sev
eral years on budget cuts and indi
rect costs issues stalled much of
the progress.
When asked what fac
tors in his life influ
enced him to involve
himself in a move
ment for multiculturalism,
Kennedy quickly replies, "Stan
ford."
He consistently deflects atten
tion from himself, instead focus
ing on the institution.
"I think it's always terribly dif
ficult when good things happen to
determine whether they hap
pened because of things in the air
or the water or because people in
leadership made good decisions,"
Kennedy says.
For Kennedy, it was simply a
matter of "watching change hap
pen and realizing what a good
thing it is."
In an attempt to explain the
shaping of his values, Kennedy
suddenly drops his jovial
demeanor as he quietly contem
plates his upbringing and his
development over the course of
his 60 years.
"I had a childhood fairly typical
for its time," he thoughtfully
explains, saying that his perspec
tive at the time was "very nar
row."

"My parents were enlightened
but not liberal," Kennedys says. But
"when you grow up you develop
greater understanding of people."
"Most of my lessons in terms of
what is possible come from watch
ing the terrific people at Stan
ford," he quietly says."I didn't
bring anything to the party.
Maybe an instinct for acceptance,
but that's all."
The UCMI report was not
the only area in which
multicultural changes
were made. Other issues
such as the adoption of the
domestic partners housing privi
leges and the amendment of the
Fundamental Standard also dra
matically changed Stanford dur
ing Kennedy's years.
Although Kennedy had little to
do with some of these issues, he
still is alternately credited and
blamed for their accomplishment.
The 1990 Fundamental Stan
dard amendment added a clause
that prohibited hate speech
directed at an individual that
would discriminate "on the basis
of sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or
national or ethnic origin."
The amendment never crossed
Kennedy's desk, but he is still
viewed by many as a leader of the
multicultural movement that
brought it about.
Although he was viewed as
responsible, Kennedy disagreed
with the changes made to the
Fundamental Standard. "I would
have preferred not to legislate in
that area," Kennedy says."I
would probably not have
approved it."
The diversification of the stu
dent body has been one of the
most visible changes in the Uni
versity over the past 10 years, and
Kennedy's appointee Jean Fetter,
former director of undergraduate
admissions, deserves much of the
credit for this progress.
The Asian-American student
population at Stanford, in partic
ular, rose dramatically during

Kennedy's reign, from only 7.3
percent in the incoming 1982
class to 24 percent of the latest
admitted class. Mexican-Ameri
can admittances similarly
increased, from 7.4 percent of the
1979 class to almost 10 percent of
the 1991 incoming class.
Black student enrollment
increased from 7.6 percent in
1979 to over 10 percent in 1988,
but has since declined to its previ
ous level, reflecting a nationwide
decrease in African-American col
lege applicants.
"The increase in Asian-Ameri
cans came about through an
increase in applications and a
greater degree of sensitivity in the
admissions office," Fetter says.
Kennedy "was very encourag
ing to me when I first took on the
job," Fetter says."It was rather

implicit encouragement than
explicit."
"Both Don and [former
Provost James Rosse] were sup
porters and cheerleaders in the
work of admissions," she says.
But according to Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson, the chal
lenge now for Stanford is "moving
from having diversity with
respect to numbers to diversity
with respect to programs."
Fetter agrees. "The easy part is
to change the number at Stan
ford," she says."The hard part is
to build the communities."
Curriculum development
was one of the first areas
in which multicultural
advocates say that Stan
ford began to make substantial
progress during Kennedy's years.
The 1988 change from the
Western Culture requirements to
the more inclusive Cultures, Ideas
and Values was the most visible
development, as Stanford became

the focus of a national debate over
the future of Western education.
Kennedy took a visible role in
campaigning for the changes and
in justifying them after the final
decision was made. He even par
ticipated in a nationally televised
debate against then-Education
Secretary William Bennett, who
argued that the adoption of CIV
constituted the "trashing of West
ern Culture."
"This is a political agenda. This
is not an intellectual agenda,"
Bennett argued. "Stanford's deci
sion . . . was not a product of
enlightened debate but rather an
unfortunate capitulation to pres
sure politics and intimidation."
"I thought (CIV) had a persua
sive list of academic arguments in
its favor that had nothing whatev
er to do with multiculturalism on
campus of with any progressive
political agenda," Kennedy says.
"I thought it had everything to do
with facing up to present reality
about where the major institu
tions and ideas in this society
today had come from.
-i ,m¥ A lot of people thought I was
supporting a social agenda," he
says."I wasn't at all. I thought I
was supporting good education."
"We need to make the contri
butions and the experiences of
ethnic and religious minorities
part of a whole variety of courses
that deal, in one way or another,
with contemporary society,"
Kennedy wrote in 1989.
According to Dinesh D'Souza
— the author of "Illiberal Educa
tion" who has been highly critical
of the change to CIV — Kennedy
and other university presidents
"consistently acquiesce in these
demands (from radical students),
abdicating their responsibility to
both the students and the institu
tion itself."
But others feel that the change
to CIV was not enough to remedy
the unnecessary bias toward
Western Culture. CIV is simply "a
name change," according to for
mer Black Student Union Chair
Bacardi Jackson. "There still is
not an emphasis on those other
cultures in CIV."
Jackson says she blames
Kennedy in part for the failure to
enact a more progressive change.
"He always told us that all the
decisions were up to the Faculty
Senate, but the president sets the
tone," she says.
But Camarillo, the UCMI
chair, disagrees.
Kennedy "stuck his neck out
real far on [CIVI and took a lot of
criticism," Camarillo says. But
"he stuck to his guns [since it
wasj an important direction that
Stanford was going in terms of
curricular development."
But because of his leader
ship in the movement,
Kennedy has been the
target of criticism from
both the right and the left during
his time at Stanford.
For the political right,
Kennedy is the instigator of a
flawed program of multicultural
ism. But according to the left, he
has not done enough to foster
racial diversity and understand
ing.
The difference between
Kennedy's multicultural vision of
Stanford and that of more pro
gressive students was clear dur
ing an Orientation program in
Memorial Auditorium on Septem
ber 22, 1989. The occasion fea
tured a speech by Kennedy and
one by Ingrid Nava, a member of
that year's Council of Presidents
who had participated in the
takeover of Kennedy's office the
year before.
Fifty-five students had been
arrested the previous spring as
they seized Kennedy's office,

demanding a face-to-face meeting
with the president as he decided
how to implement the UCMI rec
ommendations. The students also
demanded the creation of a Dis
crimination Grievance Board, and
the hiring of both a full-time Chi
cano community dean and a pro
fessor of Asian-American history.
The takeover put the students
in direct conflict with Kennedy, as
he decided to bring in the police to
settle the conflict. All the stu
dents were arrested and charged
with trespassing. Kennedy, mean
while, was heavily criticized for
relying on the police rather than
direct negotiation.
Kennedy, seeking to temper the
enthusiasm for radical actions
demonstrated in the takeover, told
the incoming freshmen and trans
fer students during his next Ori
entation speech that they should
"harbor a healthy mistrust" of
"correct politics" before adopting
a political ideology at Stanford.
"In response to all those who
will invite you to adopt their agen
das and their values, you should
ask hard questions, make them
prove everything twice and then
decide," he said.
Nava, however, sought to over
come what she saw as Kennedy's
bureaucratic resistance by exhort
ing the new students to rally
behind the progressive politics of
the People's Platform, the domi
nant campus political party.
"There comes a time to take
courageous and bold action," she
said in her speech, adding that the
takeover of Kennedy's office had
brought a "creative tension" to
campus.
"My commitment to making
things better on this campus led
me to participate in the takeover
of President Kennedy's office,"
Nava said.
She compared the struggle at
Stanford to that of the civil rights
era, describing a Greensboro,
N.C. incident in which four black
college freshmen protested segre
gation by sitting in at a lunch
counter. "If four students in 1960
did all of that, think of what
mountains your class can move."
While Nava sought to rally stu
dents behind an agenda for social
justice, Kennedy sought to main
tain open discourse on campus.
"There is room at Stanford for
the expression of opinion, even if
it is distasteful or misguided
about general matters of race, or
ethnicity, or religion, or gender or
sexual preference," he told the
audience.
Kennedy needed "to make rad
ical changes rather than the slow
changes that are really not notice
able," former BSU chair Bacardi
Jackson says.
But many of Kennedy's
troubles have come at the
hands of Stanford's polit
ical right. Consistently,
conservatives on campus have
faulted Kennedy for capitulating
to the demands of the progressive
students.
"Diversity, shmiversity," com
plains Hoover Senior Research
Fellow Charles Hill. "Diversity is
in many ways opposite to the
word university. You want to
have a universe of knowledge.
You want to have all its parts
influence or interact with each
other.
"The danger in diversity," he
explains, "is it resulting in frag
mentation — with a bunch of dif
ferent groups running off into
their separate corners and eating
their native foods, instead of
forming a more coherent whole."
To David Sacks, managing edi
tor of the Stanford Review, multi
culturalism is "a massive social
engineering project synthesizing
Maoism, feminism, environmen

talism, collectivism, '60s radical
ism, Jesse Jackson and liberal
guilt."
In a recent analysis of the
Kennedy years printed in the
Review, Sacks attacks the presi
dent as a "limousine liberal" who
"has embraced radical chic not
because of a well defined political
agenda of his own, but because
... his idea of leadership is surf
ing on the crest of trendiness."
According to Hill, the Universi
ty can improve itself "by banning
two words — multiculturalism
and diversity. We have enough
diversity. We don't have to talk
about it as if we were bereft of it,
or as if that's all we care about.
"If I hear one more word about
(diversity) I'm going to scream,"
he says.
One of the main areas in
which little progress
has been made is the
representation of peo
ple of color among the faculty.
According to the Office of Multi
cultural Development, only 8 per
cent of almost 900 tenured faculty
members belong to a minority
group. Only 9.3 percent of these

faculty members are women.
"In terms of pure numbers, we
proved to be more successful in
the student and staff arenas than
with the faculty," Rosse says.
"I think we have the potential
to be the vanguard," says multi
cultural educator Ricks. But "we
ain't the vanguard when it comes
to the faculty."
"I think Kennedy's support
has been significant, but I think
the faculty lags behind," says
Archuleta, the black community's
dean. "The problem lies within
the departments, with the deans
and the faculty not making the
commitment to multicultural
ism."
"We have increased [the num
bers of faculty of color] slightly
during our time here," Kennedy
says frankly. "But it is not satis
factory.
"We have not done enough our
selves to be certain that we are
looking in the right places,
appointing aggressively and tak
ing every step we can to succeed in
what is a very thin market," he
says. "With respect to minority
faculty, we are not doing badly in
comparison to other institutions,
but all institutions are doing
badly.
"I don't think you are going to
see any immediate dramatic
improvement, but I think there
will be improvement," Kennedy
admitted.

"The faculty has grown signifi
cantly older," Kennedy says. "We
need to find ways of bringing the
average age down and making
sure there are lots of opportunities
for people coming into the system
with new ideas."
Ricks agrees with Kennedy's
suggestion to reduce the average
age of the faculty. "It would open
up the doors to a lot of people," he
says.
"The kinds of things we were
able to do will have a payoff,"
Rosse says."The faculty culture is
hard to manage and it is slow to
change. It takes a lot to accom
plish change, but once it does
change it is hard to go back."
"My sense is that there are
more and more faculty who have
now invested in (multicultural)
curriculum development," says
Cecelia Burciaga, a former affir
mative action officer.
Continued budget cuts and
a new president leave the
future of multicultural
ism in doubt. Many facul
ty and students express concern
that the achievements of the past
could be forgotten in the upcom-

ing years.
"I have a lot of worries," Bac
ardi Jackson muses. "I'm very
concerned" that incoming Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper
has different priorities, she says.
"I think he will not be an advocate
for the students of color."
But according to Burciaga,
"Casper by himself cannot dis
mount it nor mount it" because
multiculturalism is now institu
tionalized at Stanford.
Despite the uncertainty,
"Stanford continues to be in the
vanguard of that movement," for
multiculturalism, says Parker, of
the Office of Multicultural Devel
opment. "Don facilitated Stanford
being in the vanguard. He could
have been the kind of person who
let things wash over him."
But Kennedy "is a leader, so he
did what is expected and neces
sary for a leader to do, .. .to face
the hard issues and to wrestle
with them.
"We are helping to set the
trend and define the movement of
multiculturalism" for other uni
versities to follow, Parker says.
"I think there is a problem
when Stanford compares itself to
other universities because it
makes us stagnate," Bacardi
Jackson says. "We still have a
long way to go. We should com
pare ourselves to what is right,
not to what other universities are
doing."

GB Manriquez — Daily
On the evening of Sept. 28,
1988, two drunken white
students living in East
Lagunita pinned a defaced
poster of Beethoven to the door of a
black student's room in Ujamaa. The
picture had been transformed into a
crude caricature of a black man, with
the stereotypical large lips and afro.
The two white students only meant
the poster to be a joke. They had earli
er that day engaged in a conversation
with the black student on whether
Beethoven had African roots, and their
caricature was apparently intended
only to add their final word to the con
versation.
But the poster, of course, had a very
different effect the next day when the
black student opened his door. Ujamaa
quickly became embroiled in an ugly
flare-up of racial tension, as another
poster — this one with the word "nig
ger" scrawled across it — appeared in
Ujamaa, supposedly the safe haven for
African-Americans on campus.
Although the now-famous "Ujamaa
incident" was not a typical example of

racial relations at Stanford, it never
theless defined much of the campus
discussion in the years to come. It also
presented University President Don

to overcome in his goal of creating a

During his 12 years as president,
Kennedy was a prominent leader of
the multicultural movement, as he
tried to encourage the growth of racial

Kennedy wrote. "That kind of

Kennedy is the first to
admit that he doesn't
deserve all the credit for
many of the multicultur

"John F. Kennedy didn't build
any spaceships or train any astro
nauts, but he did get credit for
sending someone to the moon. It's
the same with President
Kennedy," Archuleta says. "As a
university president, he did what
he could do, which was to create a
vision."
The Ujamaa incident provided
a somewhat representative
glimpse into Kennedy's leader
ship style in the multicultural
movement at Stanford. Through
out his administration, Kennedy
has ventured to meet with stu
dents to hear their concerns and
has set the tone for discussion in
public statements such as his
"Reflections on a Racial Under
standing."
"He's not afraid to roll up his
sleeves and sit down on the floor

and talk to students," says Dean
of Students Michael Jackson.
"He was very much a support
er, especially of the different com
munities," says former Black Stu
dent Union chair Bacardi Jack
son. "He met with us every quar
ter he was here."
"You know he cared about stu
dents," says Ricks. "You know he
cared about humanity. . . . Don
Kennedy was driven by values
and not by dollars."
As president, Kennedy has con
sistently warned against extremi
ty on both sides of the struggle
and campaigned for open dialogue
and debate. Multiculturalism,
according to Kennedy, should not
be characterized by the alienation
of communities, polarized debate
and extreme tactics. "Creative
experimentation with intermedi
ates is, in my judgment, more
promising," he wrote in his essay.
Many administrators and fac
ulty view Kennedy as the symbol
ic leader of the multicultural
movement at Stanford. According
to Archuleta, Kennedy is the
"moral, spiritual leader" of multi
culturalism, in large part because
he set the tone for the struggle.
"He set in motion serious
attention to the issues of multi
culturalism," says Sharon Parker,
director of the Office of Multicul
tural Development. "I wouldn't
be here if it were not for Don
Kennedy's leadership on multi
culturalism."
Says History Prof. A 1 Camaril
lo, "I think that on the whole his
very vocal leadership on the ques
tion of the importance of multi
culturalism ... is a critical, very
fundamental contribution to this
University."
But Kennedy gives himself
far less credit for the
multicultural movement
than his colleagues do,
instead calling multiculturalism a
result of "institutional momen
tum."
"My own belief is that this was
a direction Stanford was taking,
was inclined to take, because of
where it was in the world and
because of a spiritual direction
that I think is alive here without
encouragement," Kennedy says.
"But I do think sometimes that
the task of leadership is to reflect
the best values of the community
back to itself and to provide a con
stant reminder about those values
in the direction of the institu
tion."
By many standards, the Uni
versity has moved a long way
from the time when Kennedy first
came on the scene as Stanford's
president, although the pace and
direction of change has been criti
cized from all sides.
Many of his early years as pres
ident set the stage for the move
ment as multiculturalism began
to gain momentum. But it was
only in the late 1980s that the
movement began to effect dra
matic change and gain nationwide
attention.
The ground-breaking 1989
report of the University Commit
tee on Minority Issues established
the model for change at Stanford,
as it set forth 117 concrete recom
mendations for the University to
implement. The committee spent
18 months studying the environ
ment at Stanford for people of
color, and concluded that the Uni
versity had a long way to go to
make sure all communities felt
comfortable.
"What UCMI did was it did an
incredible investigatory study of
this place, ... of disempowered
people," Ricks says.

Kennedy encouraged the work
of the UCMI, at one point assur
ing Camariilo, its chair, that he
should alert the president's office
if the committee needed addition
al resources.
"It is that type of concrete sup
port" that characterized Kennedy's
administration, Camariilo says.
"He gave a very sincere response to
the UCMI."
"I was happy to see the
UCMI," says Bacardi Jackson,
who served on the UCMI annual
review panel. But "I think a lot
more has to be done around that
report."
Jackson was one of many stu
dents, faculty and staff who pres
sured Kennedy to immediately
implement the UCMI's recom
mendations. However, the Uni
versity's emphasis in the last sev
eral years on budget cuts and indi
rect costs issues stalled much of
the progress.
When asked what fac
tors in his life influ
enced him to involve
himself in a move
ment for multiculturalism,
Kennedy quickly replies, "Stan
ford."
He consistently deflects atten
tion from himself, instead focus
ing on the institution.
"I think it's always terribly dif
ficult when good things happen to
determine whether they hap
pened because of things in the air
or the water or because people in
leadership made good decisions,"
Kennedy says.
For Kennedy, it was simply a
matter of "watching change hap
pen and realizing what a good
thing it is."
In an attempt to explain the
shaping of his values, Kennedy
suddenly drops his jovial
demeanor as he quietly contem
plates his upbringing and his
development over the course of
his 60 years.
"I had a childhood fairly typical
for its time," he thoughtfully
explains, saying that his perspec
tive at the time was "very nar
row."

"My parents were enlightened
but not liberal," Kennedys says. But
"when you grow up you develop
greater understanding of people."
"Most of my lessons in terms of
what is possible come from watch
ing the terrific people at Stan
ford," he quietly says."I didn't
bring anything to the party.
Maybe an instinct for acceptance,
but that's all."
The UCMI report was not
the only area in which
multicultural changes
were made. Other issues
such as the adoption of the
domestic partners housing privi
leges and the amendment of the
Fundamental Standard also dra
matically changed Stanford dur
ing Kennedy's years.
Although Kennedy had little to
do with some of these issues, he
still is alternately credited and
blamed for their accomplishment.
The 1990 Fundamental Stan
dard amendment added a clause
that prohibited hate speech
directed at an individual that
would discriminate "on the basis
of sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or
national or ethnic origin."
The amendment never crossed
Kennedy's desk, but he is still
viewed by many as a leader of the
multicultural movement that
brought it about.
Although he was viewed as
responsible, Kennedy disagreed
with the changes made to the
Fundamental Standard. "I would
have preferred not to legislate in
that area," Kennedy says."I
would probably not have
approved it."
The diversification of the stu
dent body has been one of the
most visible changes in the Uni
versity over the past 10 years, and
Kennedy's appointee Jean Fetter,
former director of undergraduate
admissions, deserves much of the
credit for this progress.
The Asian-American student
population at Stanford, in partic
ular, rose dramatically during

Kennedy's reign, from only 7.3
percent in the incoming 1982
class to 24 percent of the latest
admitted class. Mexican-Ameri
can admittances similarly
increased, from 7.4 percent of the
1979 class to almost 10 percent of
the 1991 incoming class.
Black student enrollment
increased from 7.6 percent in
1979 to over 10 percent in 1988,
but has since declined to its previ
ous level, reflecting a nationwide
decrease in African-American col
lege applicants.
"The increase in Asian-Ameri
cans came about through an
increase in applications and a
greater degree of sensitivity in the
admissions office," Fetter says.
Kennedy "was very encourag
ing to me when I first took on the
job," Fetter says."It was rather

implicit encouragement than
explicit."
"Both Don and [former
Provost James Rosse] were sup
porters and cheerleaders in the
work of admissions," she says.
But according to Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson, the chal
lenge now for Stanford is "moving
from having diversity with
respect to numbers to diversity
with respect to programs."
Fetter agrees. "The easy part is
to change the number at Stan
ford," she says."The hard part is
to build the communities."
Curriculum development
was one of the first areas
in which multicultural
advocates say that Stan
ford began to make substantial
progress during Kennedy's years.
The 1988 change from the
Western Culture requirements to
the more inclusive Cultures, Ideas
and Values was the most visible
development, as Stanford became

the focus of a national debate over
the future of Western education.
Kennedy took a visible role in
campaigning for the changes and
in justifying them after the final
decision was made. He even par
ticipated in a nationally televised
debate against then-Education
Secretary William Bennett, who
argued that the adoption of CIV
constituted the "trashing of West
ern Culture."
"This is a political agenda. This
is not an intellectual agenda,"
Bennett argued. "Stanford's deci
sion . . . was not a product of
enlightened debate but rather an
unfortunate capitulation to pres
sure politics and intimidation."
"I thought (CIV) had a persua
sive list of academic arguments in
its favor that had nothing whatev
er to do with multiculturalism on
campus of with any progressive
political agenda," Kennedy says.
"I thought it had everything to do
with facing up to present reality
about where the major institu
tions and ideas in this society
today had come from.
-i ,m¥ A lot of people thought I was
supporting a social agenda," he
says."I wasn't at all. I thought I
was supporting good education."
"We need to make the contri
butions and the experiences of
ethnic and religious minorities
part of a whole variety of courses
that deal, in one way or another,
with contemporary society,"
Kennedy wrote in 1989.
According to Dinesh D'Souza
— the author of "Illiberal Educa
tion" who has been highly critical
of the change to CIV — Kennedy
and other university presidents
"consistently acquiesce in these
demands (from radical students),
abdicating their responsibility to
both the students and the institu
tion itself."
But others feel that the change
to CIV was not enough to remedy
the unnecessary bias toward
Western Culture. CIV is simply "a
name change," according to for
mer Black Student Union Chair
Bacardi Jackson. "There still is
not an emphasis on those other
cultures in CIV."
Jackson says she blames
Kennedy in part for the failure to
enact a more progressive change.
"He always told us that all the
decisions were up to the Faculty
Senate, but the president sets the
tone," she says.
But Camarillo, the UCMI
chair, disagrees.
Kennedy "stuck his neck out
real far on [CIVI and took a lot of
criticism," Camarillo says. But
"he stuck to his guns [since it
wasj an important direction that
Stanford was going in terms of
curricular development."
But because of his leader
ship in the movement,
Kennedy has been the
target of criticism from
both the right and the left during
his time at Stanford.
For the political right,
Kennedy is the instigator of a
flawed program of multicultural
ism. But according to the left, he
has not done enough to foster
racial diversity and understand
ing.
The difference between
Kennedy's multicultural vision of
Stanford and that of more pro
gressive students was clear dur
ing an Orientation program in
Memorial Auditorium on Septem
ber 22, 1989. The occasion fea
tured a speech by Kennedy and
one by Ingrid Nava, a member of
that year's Council of Presidents
who had participated in the
takeover of Kennedy's office the
year before.
Fifty-five students had been
arrested the previous spring as
they seized Kennedy's office,

demanding a face-to-face meeting
with the president as he decided
how to implement the UCMI rec
ommendations. The students also
demanded the creation of a Dis
crimination Grievance Board, and
the hiring of both a full-time Chi
cano community dean and a pro
fessor of Asian-American history.
The takeover put the students
in direct conflict with Kennedy, as
he decided to bring in the police to
settle the conflict. All the stu
dents were arrested and charged
with trespassing. Kennedy, mean
while, was heavily criticized for
relying on the police rather than
direct negotiation.
Kennedy, seeking to temper the
enthusiasm for radical actions
demonstrated in the takeover, told
the incoming freshmen and trans
fer students during his next Ori
entation speech that they should
"harbor a healthy mistrust" of
"correct politics" before adopting
a political ideology at Stanford.
"In response to all those who
will invite you to adopt their agen
das and their values, you should
ask hard questions, make them
prove everything twice and then
decide," he said.
Nava, however, sought to over
come what she saw as Kennedy's
bureaucratic resistance by exhort
ing the new students to rally
behind the progressive politics of
the People's Platform, the domi
nant campus political party.
"There comes a time to take
courageous and bold action," she
said in her speech, adding that the
takeover of Kennedy's office had
brought a "creative tension" to
campus.
"My commitment to making
things better on this campus led
me to participate in the takeover
of President Kennedy's office,"
Nava said.
She compared the struggle at
Stanford to that of the civil rights
era, describing a Greensboro,
N.C. incident in which four black
college freshmen protested segre
gation by sitting in at a lunch
counter. "If four students in 1960
did all of that, think of what
mountains your class can move."
While Nava sought to rally stu
dents behind an agenda for social
justice, Kennedy sought to main
tain open discourse on campus.
"There is room at Stanford for
the expression of opinion, even if
it is distasteful or misguided
about general matters of race, or
ethnicity, or religion, or gender or
sexual preference," he told the
audience.
Kennedy needed "to make rad
ical changes rather than the slow
changes that are really not notice
able," former BSU chair Bacardi
Jackson says.
But many of Kennedy's
troubles have come at the
hands of Stanford's polit
ical right. Consistently,
conservatives on campus have
faulted Kennedy for capitulating
to the demands of the progressive
students.
"Diversity, shmiversity," com
plains Hoover Senior Research
Fellow Charles Hill. "Diversity is
in many ways opposite to the
word university. You want to
have a universe of knowledge.
You want to have all its parts
influence or interact with each
other.
"The danger in diversity," he
explains, "is it resulting in frag
mentation — with a bunch of dif
ferent groups running off into
their separate corners and eating
their native foods, instead of
forming a more coherent whole."
To David Sacks, managing edi
tor of the Stanford Review, multi
culturalism is "a massive social
engineering project synthesizing
Maoism, feminism, environmen

talism, collectivism, '60s radical
ism, Jesse Jackson and liberal
guilt."
In a recent analysis of the
Kennedy years printed in the
Review, Sacks attacks the presi
dent as a "limousine liberal" who
"has embraced radical chic not
because of a well defined political
agenda of his own, but because
... his idea of leadership is surf
ing on the crest of trendiness."
According to Hill, the Universi
ty can improve itself "by banning
two words — multiculturalism
and diversity. We have enough
diversity. We don't have to talk
about it as if we were bereft of it,
or as if that's all we care about.
"If I hear one more word about
(diversity) I'm going to scream,"
he says.
One of the main areas in
which little progress
has been made is the
representation of peo
ple of color among the faculty.
According to the Office of Multi
cultural Development, only 8 per
cent of almost 900 tenured faculty
members belong to a minority
group. Only 9.3 percent of these

faculty members are women.
"In terms of pure numbers, we
proved to be more successful in
the student and staff arenas than
with the faculty," Rosse says.
"I think we have the potential
to be the vanguard," says multi
cultural educator Ricks. But "we
ain't the vanguard when it comes
to the faculty."
"I think Kennedy's support
has been significant, but I think
the faculty lags behind," says
Archuleta, the black community's
dean. "The problem lies within
the departments, with the deans
and the faculty not making the
commitment to multicultural
ism."
"We have increased [the num
bers of faculty of color] slightly
during our time here," Kennedy
says frankly. "But it is not satis
factory.
"We have not done enough our
selves to be certain that we are
looking in the right places,
appointing aggressively and tak
ing every step we can to succeed in
what is a very thin market," he
says. "With respect to minority
faculty, we are not doing badly in
comparison to other institutions,
but all institutions are doing
badly.
"I don't think you are going to
see any immediate dramatic
improvement, but I think there
will be improvement," Kennedy
admitted.

"The faculty has grown signifi
cantly older," Kennedy says. "We
need to find ways of bringing the
average age down and making
sure there are lots of opportunities
for people coming into the system
with new ideas."
Ricks agrees with Kennedy's
suggestion to reduce the average
age of the faculty. "It would open
up the doors to a lot of people," he
says.
"The kinds of things we were
able to do will have a payoff,"
Rosse says."The faculty culture is
hard to manage and it is slow to
change. It takes a lot to accom
plish change, but once it does
change it is hard to go back."
"My sense is that there are
more and more faculty who have
now invested in (multicultural)
curriculum development," says
Cecelia Burciaga, a former affir
mative action officer.
Continued budget cuts and
a new president leave the
future of multicultural
ism in doubt. Many facul
ty and students express concern
that the achievements of the past
could be forgotten in the upcom-

ing years.
"I have a lot of worries," Bac
ardi Jackson muses. "I'm very
concerned" that incoming Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper
has different priorities, she says.
"I think he will not be an advocate
for the students of color."
But according to Burciaga,
"Casper by himself cannot dis
mount it nor mount it" because
multiculturalism is now institu
tionalized at Stanford.
Despite the uncertainty,
"Stanford continues to be in the
vanguard of that movement," for
multiculturalism, says Parker, of
the Office of Multicultural Devel
opment. "Don facilitated Stanford
being in the vanguard. He could
have been the kind of person who
let things wash over him."
But Kennedy "is a leader, so he
did what is expected and neces
sary for a leader to do, .. .to face
the hard issues and to wrestle
with them.
"We are helping to set the
trend and define the movement of
multiculturalism" for other uni
versities to follow, Parker says.
"I think there is a problem
when Stanford compares itself to
other universities because it
makes us stagnate," Bacardi
Jackson says. "We still have a
long way to go. We should com
pare ourselves to what is right,
not to what other universities are
doing."

GB Manriquez — Daily
On the evening of Sept. 28,
1988, two drunken white
students living in East
Lagunita pinned a defaced
poster of Beethoven to the door of a
black student's room in Ujamaa. The
picture had been transformed into a
crude caricature of a black man, with
the stereotypical large lips and afro.
The two white students only meant
the poster to be a joke. They had earli
er that day engaged in a conversation
with the black student on whether
Beethoven had African roots, and their
caricature was apparently intended
only to add their final word to the con
versation.
But the poster, of course, had a very
different effect the next day when the
black student opened his door. Ujamaa
quickly became embroiled in an ugly
flare-up of racial tension, as another
poster — this one with the word "nig
ger" scrawled across it — appeared in
Ujamaa, supposedly the safe haven for
African-Americans on campus.
Although the now-famous "Ujamaa
incident" was not a typical example of

racial relations at Stanford, it never
theless defined much of the campus
discussion in the years to come. It also
presented University President Don
ald Kennedy with an enormous hurdle
to overcome in his goal of creating a
multicultural community at Stanford.
During his 12 years as president,
Kennedy was a prominent leader of
the multicultural movement, as he
tried to encourage the growth of racial
understanding but at the same time
restrain the ambitions of more pro
gressive students. But he modestly
credits himself only as a supporter,
rather than a leader, of the movement.
"I don't think Don was asked to
bring multiculturalism," says Greg

Ricks, Residential Education's multi
cultural educator. "I don't think Don
was asked to bring public service. . . .
But he was able to get his personal
agenda across."
Kennedy had faced hurdles like the
Ujamaa incident before, and he met
this one with the same approach, with
his personal interaction with students
and with his eloquent words that chal
lenged Stanford to overcome its diffi
culties and meet its goals.
This had been the approach that he
used as he argued for the change from
Western Culture to CIV, encouraged
the work of the University Committee
on Minority Issues and struggled to
implement change in the midst of bud
get cutbacks.
He immediately met with students
after the second, more volatile poster
appeared in Ujamaa in an attempt to
calm the racial animosity that had
bubbled to the surface. And in
response to the request of the students
he met that day, he wrote what they
hoped would be a "thoughtful paper"
on racial relations at Stanford.
His approach in his "Reflections on

Protesters who took over University President Donald Kennedy's office in 1989 demanded Kennedy move more swiftly
to implement requests that ranged from hiring an Asian-American tenure-track professor to rescinding a recently
announced tuition hike. Fifty-four students were arrested on account of the protest, the impact of which is still debated.

a Racial Understanding," as in
much of his administration, was
even-handed, as he tried to reduce
the tensions and promote under
standing among the represented
races at Stanford. He has consis
tently positioned himself as one of
many leaders of the multicultural
movement, but one who seeks to
encourage racial understanding
and at the same time temper rad
ical political agendas.
"We are among the few places
in this country in which it may be
possible to test the workability of
the multicultural existence that
will, ready or not, be the life of
Californians and Americans in
the twenty-first century,"
Kennedy wrote in his essay,
which was printed in The Daily.
"We are exposing . . . ourselves to
the risk of misunderstanding and
even, when sensitivities are vio
lated as they occasionally will be,
hostility."

While he condemned the insen
sitivity shown in the Ujamaa inci
dent, he also warned against the
dangers of dogmatism.
"Time and again we have seen
the promotion of racial under
standing linked to a more focused
— and less broadly understood
and accepted — political agenda,"
Kennedy wrote. "That kind of
load is probably too heavy for a
delicate structure to bear all at
once."
Kennedy is the first to
admit that he doesn't
deserve all the credit for
many of the multicultur
al changes at Stanford during the
past 12 years.
"I do believe I gave it support,"
he says."I also tried to give it
some restraints. From time to
time I indicated a worry that mul
ticulturalism would become a
kind of political ideology of its
own."
Keith Archuleta, director of

the Black Community Services
Center, says that nevertheless,
Kennedy should receive credit for
the changes made during his
tenure.
"John F. Kennedy didn't build
any spaceships or train any astro
nauts, but he did get credit for
sending someone to the moon. It's
the same with President
Kennedy," Archuleta says. "As a
university president, he did what
he could do, which was to create a
vision."
The Ujamaa incident provided
a somewhat representative
glimpse into Kennedy's leader
ship style in the multicultural
movement at Stanford. Through
out his administration, Kennedy
has ventured to meet with stu
dents to hear their concerns and
has set the tone for discussion in
public statements such as his
"Reflections on a Racial Under
standing."
"He's not afraid to roll up his
sleeves and sit down on the floor

and talk to students," says Dean
of Students Michael Jackson.
"He was very much a support
er, especially of the different com
munities," says former Black Stu
dent Union chair Bacardi Jack
son. "He met with us every quar
ter he was here."
"You know he cared about stu
dents," says Ricks. "You know he
cared about humanity. . . . Don
Kennedy was driven by values
and not by dollars."
As president, Kennedy has con
sistently warned against extremi
ty on both sides of the struggle
and campaigned for open dialogue
and debate. Multiculturalism,
according to Kennedy, should not
be characterized by the alienation
of communities, polarized debate
and extreme tactics. "Creative
experimentation with intermedi
ates is, in my judgment, more
promising," he wrote in his essay.
Many administrators and fac
ulty view Kennedy as the symbol
ic leader of the multicultural
movement at Stanford. According
to Archuleta, Kennedy is the
"moral, spiritual leader" of multi
culturalism, in large part because
he set the tone for the struggle.
"He set in motion serious
attention to the issues of multi
culturalism," says Sharon Parker,
director of the Office of Multicul
tural Development. "I wouldn't
be here if it were not for Don
Kennedy's leadership on multi
culturalism."
Says History Prof. A 1 Camaril
lo, "I think that on the whole his
very vocal leadership on the ques
tion of the importance of multi
culturalism ... is a critical, very
fundamental contribution to this
University."
But Kennedy gives himself
far less credit for the
multicultural movement
than his colleagues do,
instead calling multiculturalism a
result of "institutional momen
tum."
"My own belief is that this was
a direction Stanford was taking,
was inclined to take, because of
where it was in the world and
because of a spiritual direction
that I think is alive here without
encouragement," Kennedy says.
"But I do think sometimes that
the task of leadership is to reflect
the best values of the community
back to itself and to provide a con
stant reminder about those values
in the direction of the institu
tion."
By many standards, the Uni
versity has moved a long way
from the time when Kennedy first
came on the scene as Stanford's
president, although the pace and
direction of change has been criti
cized from all sides.
Many of his early years as pres
ident set the stage for the move
ment as multiculturalism began
to gain momentum. But it was
only in the late 1980s that the
movement began to effect dra
matic change and gain nationwide
attention.
The ground-breaking 1989
report of the University Commit
tee on Minority Issues established
the model for change at Stanford,
as it set forth 117 concrete recom
mendations for the University to
implement. The committee spent
18 months studying the environ
ment at Stanford for people of
color, and concluded that the Uni
versity had a long way to go to
make sure all communities felt
comfortable.
"What UCMI did was it did an
incredible investigatory study of
this place, ... of disempowered
people," Ricks says.

Kennedy encouraged the work
of the UCMI, at one point assur
ing Camariilo, its chair, that he
should alert the president's office
if the committee needed addition
al resources.
"It is that type of concrete sup
port" that characterized Kennedy's
administration, Camariilo says.
"He gave a very sincere response to
the UCMI."
"I was happy to see the
UCMI," says Bacardi Jackson,
who served on the UCMI annual
review panel. But "I think a lot
more has to be done around that
report."
Jackson was one of many stu
dents, faculty and staff who pres
sured Kennedy to immediately
implement the UCMI's recom
mendations. However, the Uni
versity's emphasis in the last sev
eral years on budget cuts and indi
rect costs issues stalled much of
the progress.
When asked what fac
tors in his life influ
enced him to involve
himself in a move
ment for multiculturalism,
Kennedy quickly replies, "Stan
ford."
He consistently deflects atten
tion from himself, instead focus
ing on the institution.
"I think it's always terribly dif
ficult when good things happen to
determine whether they hap
pened because of things in the air
or the water or because people in
leadership made good decisions,"
Kennedy says.
For Kennedy, it was simply a
matter of "watching change hap
pen and realizing what a good
thing it is."
In an attempt to explain the
shaping of his values, Kennedy
suddenly drops his jovial
demeanor as he quietly contem
plates his upbringing and his
development over the course of
his 60 years.
"I had a childhood fairly typical
for its time," he thoughtfully
explains, saying that his perspec
tive at the time was "very nar
row."

"My parents were enlightened
but not liberal," Kennedys says. But
"when you grow up you develop
greater understanding of people."
"Most of my lessons in terms of
what is possible come from watch
ing the terrific people at Stan
ford," he quietly says."I didn't
bring anything to the party.
Maybe an instinct for acceptance,
but that's all."
The UCMI report was not
the only area in which
multicultural changes
were made. Other issues
such as the adoption of the
domestic partners housing privi
leges and the amendment of the
Fundamental Standard also dra
matically changed Stanford dur
ing Kennedy's years.
Although Kennedy had little to
do with some of these issues, he
still is alternately credited and
blamed for their accomplishment.
The 1990 Fundamental Stan
dard amendment added a clause
that prohibited hate speech
directed at an individual that
would discriminate "on the basis
of sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or
national or ethnic origin."
The amendment never crossed
Kennedy's desk, but he is still
viewed by many as a leader of the
multicultural movement that
brought it about.
Although he was viewed as
responsible, Kennedy disagreed
with the changes made to the
Fundamental Standard. "I would
have preferred not to legislate in
that area," Kennedy says."I
would probably not have
approved it."
The diversification of the stu
dent body has been one of the
most visible changes in the Uni
versity over the past 10 years, and
Kennedy's appointee Jean Fetter,
former director of undergraduate
admissions, deserves much of the
credit for this progress.
The Asian-American student
population at Stanford, in partic
ular, rose dramatically during

Kennedy's reign, from only 7.3
percent in the incoming 1982
class to 24 percent of the latest
admitted class. Mexican-Ameri
can admittances similarly
increased, from 7.4 percent of the
1979 class to almost 10 percent of
the 1991 incoming class.
Black student enrollment
increased from 7.6 percent in
1979 to over 10 percent in 1988,
but has since declined to its previ
ous level, reflecting a nationwide
decrease in African-American col
lege applicants.
"The increase in Asian-Ameri
cans came about through an
increase in applications and a
greater degree of sensitivity in the
admissions office," Fetter says.
Kennedy "was very encourag
ing to me when I first took on the
job," Fetter says."It was rather

implicit encouragement than
explicit."
"Both Don and [former
Provost James Rosse] were sup
porters and cheerleaders in the
work of admissions," she says.
But according to Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson, the chal
lenge now for Stanford is "moving
from having diversity with
respect to numbers to diversity
with respect to programs."
Fetter agrees. "The easy part is
to change the number at Stan
ford," she says."The hard part is
to build the communities."
Curriculum development
was one of the first areas
in which multicultural
advocates say that Stan
ford began to make substantial
progress during Kennedy's years.
The 1988 change from the
Western Culture requirements to
the more inclusive Cultures, Ideas
and Values was the most visible
development, as Stanford became

the focus of a national debate over
the future of Western education.
Kennedy took a visible role in
campaigning for the changes and
in justifying them after the final
decision was made. He even par
ticipated in a nationally televised
debate against then-Education
Secretary William Bennett, who
argued that the adoption of CIV
constituted the "trashing of West
ern Culture."
"This is a political agenda. This
is not an intellectual agenda,"
Bennett argued. "Stanford's deci
sion . . . was not a product of
enlightened debate but rather an
unfortunate capitulation to pres
sure politics and intimidation."
"I thought (CIV) had a persua
sive list of academic arguments in
its favor that had nothing whatev
er to do with multiculturalism on
campus of with any progressive
political agenda," Kennedy says.
"I thought it had everything to do
with facing up to present reality
about where the major institu
tions and ideas in this society
today had come from.
-i ,m¥ A lot of people thought I was
supporting a social agenda," he
says."I wasn't at all. I thought I
was supporting good education."
"We need to make the contri
butions and the experiences of
ethnic and religious minorities
part of a whole variety of courses
that deal, in one way or another,
with contemporary society,"
Kennedy wrote in 1989.
According to Dinesh D'Souza
— the author of "Illiberal Educa
tion" who has been highly critical
of the change to CIV — Kennedy
and other university presidents
"consistently acquiesce in these
demands (from radical students),
abdicating their responsibility to
both the students and the institu
tion itself."
But others feel that the change
to CIV was not enough to remedy
the unnecessary bias toward
Western Culture. CIV is simply "a
name change," according to for
mer Black Student Union Chair
Bacardi Jackson. "There still is
not an emphasis on those other
cultures in CIV."
Jackson says she blames
Kennedy in part for the failure to
enact a more progressive change.
"He always told us that all the
decisions were up to the Faculty
Senate, but the president sets the
tone," she says.
But Camarillo, the UCMI
chair, disagrees.
Kennedy "stuck his neck out
real far on [CIVI and took a lot of
criticism," Camarillo says. But
"he stuck to his guns [since it
wasj an important direction that
Stanford was going in terms of
curricular development."
But because of his leader
ship in the movement,
Kennedy has been the
target of criticism from
both the right and the left during
his time at Stanford.
For the political right,
Kennedy is the instigator of a
flawed program of multicultural
ism. But according to the left, he
has not done enough to foster
racial diversity and understand
ing.
The difference between
Kennedy's multicultural vision of
Stanford and that of more pro
gressive students was clear dur
ing an Orientation program in
Memorial Auditorium on Septem
ber 22, 1989. The occasion fea
tured a speech by Kennedy and
one by Ingrid Nava, a member of
that year's Council of Presidents
who had participated in the
takeover of Kennedy's office the
year before.
Fifty-five students had been
arrested the previous spring as
they seized Kennedy's office,

demanding a face-to-face meeting
with the president as he decided
how to implement the UCMI rec
ommendations. The students also
demanded the creation of a Dis
crimination Grievance Board, and
the hiring of both a full-time Chi
cano community dean and a pro
fessor of Asian-American history.
The takeover put the students
in direct conflict with Kennedy, as
he decided to bring in the police to
settle the conflict. All the stu
dents were arrested and charged
with trespassing. Kennedy, mean
while, was heavily criticized for
relying on the police rather than
direct negotiation.
Kennedy, seeking to temper the
enthusiasm for radical actions
demonstrated in the takeover, told
the incoming freshmen and trans
fer students during his next Ori
entation speech that they should
"harbor a healthy mistrust" of
"correct politics" before adopting
a political ideology at Stanford.
"In response to all those who
will invite you to adopt their agen
das and their values, you should
ask hard questions, make them
prove everything twice and then
decide," he said.
Nava, however, sought to over
come what she saw as Kennedy's
bureaucratic resistance by exhort
ing the new students to rally
behind the progressive politics of
the People's Platform, the domi
nant campus political party.
"There comes a time to take
courageous and bold action," she
said in her speech, adding that the
takeover of Kennedy's office had
brought a "creative tension" to
campus.
"My commitment to making
things better on this campus led
me to participate in the takeover
of President Kennedy's office,"
Nava said.
She compared the struggle at
Stanford to that of the civil rights
era, describing a Greensboro,
N.C. incident in which four black
college freshmen protested segre
gation by sitting in at a lunch
counter. "If four students in 1960
did all of that, think of what
mountains your class can move."
While Nava sought to rally stu
dents behind an agenda for social
justice, Kennedy sought to main
tain open discourse on campus.
"There is room at Stanford for
the expression of opinion, even if
it is distasteful or misguided
about general matters of race, or
ethnicity, or religion, or gender or
sexual preference," he told the
audience.
Kennedy needed "to make rad
ical changes rather than the slow
changes that are really not notice
able," former BSU chair Bacardi
Jackson says.
But many of Kennedy's
troubles have come at the
hands of Stanford's polit
ical right. Consistently,
conservatives on campus have
faulted Kennedy for capitulating
to the demands of the progressive
students.
"Diversity, shmiversity," com
plains Hoover Senior Research
Fellow Charles Hill. "Diversity is
in many ways opposite to the
word university. You want to
have a universe of knowledge.
You want to have all its parts
influence or interact with each
other.
"The danger in diversity," he
explains, "is it resulting in frag
mentation — with a bunch of dif
ferent groups running off into
their separate corners and eating
their native foods, instead of
forming a more coherent whole."
To David Sacks, managing edi
tor of the Stanford Review, multi
culturalism is "a massive social
engineering project synthesizing
Maoism, feminism, environmen

talism, collectivism, '60s radical
ism, Jesse Jackson and liberal
guilt."
In a recent analysis of the
Kennedy years printed in the
Review, Sacks attacks the presi
dent as a "limousine liberal" who
"has embraced radical chic not
because of a well defined political
agenda of his own, but because
... his idea of leadership is surf
ing on the crest of trendiness."
According to Hill, the Universi
ty can improve itself "by banning
two words — multiculturalism
and diversity. We have enough
diversity. We don't have to talk
about it as if we were bereft of it,
or as if that's all we care about.
"If I hear one more word about
(diversity) I'm going to scream,"
he says.
One of the main areas in
which little progress
has been made is the
representation of peo
ple of color among the faculty.
According to the Office of Multi
cultural Development, only 8 per
cent of almost 900 tenured faculty
members belong to a minority
group. Only 9.3 percent of these

faculty members are women.
"In terms of pure numbers, we
proved to be more successful in
the student and staff arenas than
with the faculty," Rosse says.
"I think we have the potential
to be the vanguard," says multi
cultural educator Ricks. But "we
ain't the vanguard when it comes
to the faculty."
"I think Kennedy's support
has been significant, but I think
the faculty lags behind," says
Archuleta, the black community's
dean. "The problem lies within
the departments, with the deans
and the faculty not making the
commitment to multicultural
ism."
"We have increased [the num
bers of faculty of color] slightly
during our time here," Kennedy
says frankly. "But it is not satis
factory.
"We have not done enough our
selves to be certain that we are
looking in the right places,
appointing aggressively and tak
ing every step we can to succeed in
what is a very thin market," he
says. "With respect to minority
faculty, we are not doing badly in
comparison to other institutions,
but all institutions are doing
badly.
"I don't think you are going to
see any immediate dramatic
improvement, but I think there
will be improvement," Kennedy
admitted.

"The faculty has grown signifi
cantly older," Kennedy says. "We
need to find ways of bringing the
average age down and making
sure there are lots of opportunities
for people coming into the system
with new ideas."
Ricks agrees with Kennedy's
suggestion to reduce the average
age of the faculty. "It would open
up the doors to a lot of people," he
says.
"The kinds of things we were
able to do will have a payoff,"
Rosse says."The faculty culture is
hard to manage and it is slow to
change. It takes a lot to accom
plish change, but once it does
change it is hard to go back."
"My sense is that there are
more and more faculty who have
now invested in (multicultural)
curriculum development," says
Cecelia Burciaga, a former affir
mative action officer.
Continued budget cuts and
a new president leave the
future of multicultural
ism in doubt. Many facul
ty and students express concern
that the achievements of the past
could be forgotten in the upcom-

ing years.
"I have a lot of worries," Bac
ardi Jackson muses. "I'm very
concerned" that incoming Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper
has different priorities, she says.
"I think he will not be an advocate
for the students of color."
But according to Burciaga,
"Casper by himself cannot dis
mount it nor mount it" because
multiculturalism is now institu
tionalized at Stanford.
Despite the uncertainty,
"Stanford continues to be in the
vanguard of that movement," for
multiculturalism, says Parker, of
the Office of Multicultural Devel
opment. "Don facilitated Stanford
being in the vanguard. He could
have been the kind of person who
let things wash over him."
But Kennedy "is a leader, so he
did what is expected and neces
sary for a leader to do, .. .to face
the hard issues and to wrestle
with them.
"We are helping to set the
trend and define the movement of
multiculturalism" for other uni
versities to follow, Parker says.
"I think there is a problem
when Stanford compares itself to
other universities because it
makes us stagnate," Bacardi
Jackson says. "We still have a
long way to go. We should com
pare ourselves to what is right,
not to what other universities are
doing."

GB Manriquez — Daily
On the evening of Sept. 28,
1988, two drunken white
students living in East
Lagunita pinned a defaced
poster of Beethoven to the door of a
black student's room in Ujamaa. The
picture had been transformed into a
crude caricature of a black man, with
the stereotypical large lips and afro.
The two white students only meant
the poster to be a joke. They had earli
er that day engaged in a conversation
with the black student on whether
Beethoven had African roots, and their
caricature was apparently intended
only to add their final word to the con
versation.
But the poster, of course, had a very
different effect the next day when the
black student opened his door. Ujamaa
quickly became embroiled in an ugly
flare-up of racial tension, as another
poster — this one with the word "nig
ger" scrawled across it — appeared in
Ujamaa, supposedly the safe haven for
African-Americans on campus.
Although the now-famous "Ujamaa
incident" was not a typical example of

racial relations at Stanford, it never
theless defined much of the campus
discussion in the years to come. It also
presented University President Don
ald Kennedy with an enormous hurdle
to overcome in his goal of creating a
multicultural community at Stanford.
During his 12 years as president,
Kennedy was a prominent leader of
the multicultural movement, as he
tried to encourage the growth of racial
understanding but at the same time
restrain the ambitions of more pro
gressive students. But he modestly
credits himself only as a supporter,
rather than a leader, of the movement.
"I don't think Don was asked to
bring multiculturalism," says Greg

Ricks, Residential Education's multi
cultural educator. "I don't think Don
was asked to bring public service. . . .
But he was able to get his personal
agenda across."
Kennedy had faced hurdles like the
Ujamaa incident before, and he met
this one with the same approach, with
his personal interaction with students
and with his eloquent words that chal
lenged Stanford to overcome its diffi
culties and meet its goals.
This had been the approach that he
used as he argued for the change from
Western Culture to CIV, encouraged
the work of the University Committee
on Minority Issues and struggled to
implement change in the midst of bud
get cutbacks.
He immediately met with students
after the second, more volatile poster
appeared in Ujamaa in an attempt to
calm the racial animosity that had
bubbled to the surface. And in
response to the request of the students
he met that day, he wrote what they
hoped would be a "thoughtful paper"
on racial relations at Stanford.
His approach in his "Reflections on


Chris Eisenberg— Daily file
Protesters who took over University President Donald Kennedy's office in 1989 demanded Kennedy move more swiftly
to implement requests that ranged from hiring an Asian-American tenure-track professor to rescinding a recently
announced tuition hike. Fifty-four students were arrested on account of the protest, the impact of which is still debated.

a Racial Understanding," as in
much of his administration, was
even-handed, as he tried to reduce
the tensions and promote under
standing among the represented
races at Stanford. He has consis
tently positioned himself as one of
many leaders of the multicultural
movement, but one who seeks to
encourage racial understanding
and at the same time temper rad
ical political agendas.
"We are among the few places
in this country in which it may be
possible to test the workability of
the multicultural existence that
will, ready or not, be the life of
Californians and Americans in
the twenty-first century,"
Kennedy wrote in his essay,
which was printed in The Daily.
"We are exposing . . . ourselves to
the risk of misunderstanding and
even, when sensitivities are vio
lated as they occasionally will be,
hostility."

While he condemned the insen
sitivity shown in the Ujamaa inci
dent, he also warned against the
dangers of dogmatism.
"Time and again we have seen
the promotion of racial under
standing linked to a more focused
— and less broadly understood
and accepted — political agenda,"
Kennedy wrote. "That kind of
load is probably too heavy for a
delicate structure to bear all at
once."
Kennedy is the first to
admit that he doesn't
deserve all the credit for
many of the multicultur
al changes at Stanford during the
past 12 years.
"I do believe I gave it support,"
he says."I also tried to give it
some restraints. From time to
time I indicated a worry that mul
ticulturalism would become a
kind of political ideology of its
own."
Keith Archuleta, director of

the Black Community Services
Center, says that nevertheless,
Kennedy should receive credit for
the changes made during his
tenure.
"John F. Kennedy didn't build
any spaceships or train any astro
nauts, but he did get credit for
sending someone to the moon. It's
the same with President
Kennedy," Archuleta says. "As a
university president, he did what
he could do, which was to create a
vision."
The Ujamaa incident provided
a somewhat representative
glimpse into Kennedy's leader
ship style in the multicultural
movement at Stanford. Through
out his administration, Kennedy
has ventured to meet with stu
dents to hear their concerns and
has set the tone for discussion in
public statements such as his
"Reflections on a Racial Under
standing."
"He's not afraid to roll up his
sleeves and sit down on the floor

and talk to students," says Dean
of Students Michael Jackson.
"He was very much a support
er, especially of the different com
munities," says former Black Stu
dent Union chair Bacardi Jack
son. "He met with us every quar
ter he was here."
"You know he cared about stu
dents," says Ricks. "You know he
cared about humanity. . . . Don
Kennedy was driven by values
and not by dollars."
As president, Kennedy has con
sistently warned against extremi
ty on both sides of the struggle
and campaigned for open dialogue
and debate. Multiculturalism,
according to Kennedy, should not
be characterized by the alienation
of communities, polarized debate
and extreme tactics. "Creative
experimentation with intermedi
ates is, in my judgment, more
promising," he wrote in his essay.
Many administrators and fac
ulty view Kennedy as the symbol
ic leader of the multicultural
movement at Stanford. According
to Archuleta, Kennedy is the
"moral, spiritual leader" of multi
culturalism, in large part because
he set the tone for the struggle.
"He set in motion serious
attention to the issues of multi
culturalism," says Sharon Parker,
director of the Office of Multicul
tural Development. "I wouldn't
be here if it were not for Don
Kennedy's leadership on multi
culturalism."
Says History Prof. A 1 Camaril
lo, "I think that on the whole his
very vocal leadership on the ques
tion of the importance of multi
culturalism ... is a critical, very
fundamental contribution to this
University."
But Kennedy gives himself
far less credit for the
multicultural movement
than his colleagues do,
instead calling multiculturalism a
result of "institutional momen
tum."
"My own belief is that this was
a direction Stanford was taking,
was inclined to take, because of
where it was in the world and
because of a spiritual direction
that I think is alive here without
encouragement," Kennedy says.
"But I do think sometimes that
the task of leadership is to reflect
the best values of the community
back to itself and to provide a con
stant reminder about those values
in the direction of the institu
tion."
By many standards, the Uni
versity has moved a long way
from the time when Kennedy first
came on the scene as Stanford's
president, although the pace and
direction of change has been criti
cized from all sides.
Many of his early years as pres
ident set the stage for the move
ment as multiculturalism began
to gain momentum. But it was
only in the late 1980s that the
movement began to effect dra
matic change and gain nationwide
attention.
The ground-breaking 1989
report of the University Commit
tee on Minority Issues established
the model for change at Stanford,
as it set forth 117 concrete recom
mendations for the University to
implement. The committee spent
18 months studying the environ
ment at Stanford for people of
color, and concluded that the Uni
versity had a long way to go to
make sure all communities felt
comfortable.
"What UCMI did was it did an
incredible investigatory study of
this place, ... of disempowered
people," Ricks says.

Kennedy encouraged the work
of the UCMI, at one point assur
ing Camariilo, its chair, that he
should alert the president's office
if the committee needed addition
al resources.
"It is that type of concrete sup
port" that characterized Kennedy's
administration, Camariilo says.
"He gave a very sincere response to
the UCMI."
"I was happy to see the
UCMI," says Bacardi Jackson,
who served on the UCMI annual
review panel. But "I think a lot
more has to be done around that
report."
Jackson was one of many stu
dents, faculty and staff who pres
sured Kennedy to immediately
implement the UCMI's recom
mendations. However, the Uni
versity's emphasis in the last sev
eral years on budget cuts and indi
rect costs issues stalled much of
the progress.
When asked what fac
tors in his life influ
enced him to involve
himself in a move
ment for multiculturalism,
Kennedy quickly replies, "Stan
ford."
He consistently deflects atten
tion from himself, instead focus
ing on the institution.
"I think it's always terribly dif
ficult when good things happen to
determine whether they hap
pened because of things in the air
or the water or because people in
leadership made good decisions,"
Kennedy says.
For Kennedy, it was simply a
matter of "watching change hap
pen and realizing what a good
thing it is."
In an attempt to explain the
shaping of his values, Kennedy
suddenly drops his jovial
demeanor as he quietly contem
plates his upbringing and his
development over the course of
his 60 years.
"I had a childhood fairly typical
for its time," he thoughtfully
explains, saying that his perspec
tive at the time was "very nar
row."

"My parents were enlightened
but not liberal," Kennedys says. But
"when you grow up you develop
greater understanding of people."
"Most of my lessons in terms of
what is possible come from watch
ing the terrific people at Stan
ford," he quietly says."I didn't
bring anything to the party.
Maybe an instinct for acceptance,
but that's all."
The UCMI report was not
the only area in which
multicultural changes
were made. Other issues
such as the adoption of the
domestic partners housing privi
leges and the amendment of the
Fundamental Standard also dra
matically changed Stanford dur
ing Kennedy's years.
Although Kennedy had little to
do with some of these issues, he
still is alternately credited and
blamed for their accomplishment.
The 1990 Fundamental Stan
dard amendment added a clause
that prohibited hate speech
directed at an individual that
would discriminate "on the basis
of sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or
national or ethnic origin."
The amendment never crossed
Kennedy's desk, but he is still
viewed by many as a leader of the
multicultural movement that
brought it about.
Although he was viewed as
responsible, Kennedy disagreed
with the changes made to the
Fundamental Standard. "I would
have preferred not to legislate in
that area," Kennedy says."I
would probably not have
approved it."
The diversification of the stu
dent body has been one of the
most visible changes in the Uni
versity over the past 10 years, and
Kennedy's appointee Jean Fetter,
former director of undergraduate
admissions, deserves much of the
credit for this progress.

Kennedy's reign, from only 7.3
percent in the incoming 1982
class to 24 percent of the latest
admitted class. Mexican-Ameri
can admittances similarly
increased, from 7.4 percent of the
1979 class to almost 10 percent of
the 1991 incoming class.
Black student enrollment
increased from 7.6 percent in
1979 to over 10 percent in 1988,
but has since declined to its previ
ous level, reflecting a nationwide
decrease in African-American col
lege applicants.
"The increase in Asian-Ameri
cans came about through an
increase in applications and a
greater degree of sensitivity in the
admissions office," Fetter says.
Kennedy "was very encourag
ing to me when I first took on the
job," Fetter says."It was rather

implicit encouragement than
explicit."
"Both Don and [former
Provost James Rosse] were sup
porters and cheerleaders in the
work of admissions," she says.
But according to Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson, the chal
lenge now for Stanford is "moving
from having diversity with
respect to numbers to diversity
with respect to programs."
Fetter agrees. "The easy part is
to change the number at Stan
ford," she says."The hard part is
to build the communities."
Curriculum development
was one of the first areas
in which multicultural
advocates say that Stan
ford began to make substantial
progress during Kennedy's years.
The 1988 change from the
Western Culture requirements to
the more inclusive Cultures, Ideas
and Values was the most visible
development, as Stanford became

the focus of a national debate over
the future of Western education.
Kennedy took a visible role in
campaigning for the changes and
in justifying them after the final
decision was made. He even par
ticipated in a nationally televised
debate against then-Education
Secretary William Bennett, who
argued that the adoption of CIV
constituted the "trashing of West
ern Culture."
"This is a political agenda. This
is not an intellectual agenda,"
Bennett argued. "Stanford's deci
sion . . . was not a product of
enlightened debate but rather an
unfortunate capitulation to pres
sure politics and intimidation."
"I thought (CIV) had a persua
sive list of academic arguments in
its favor that had nothing whatev
er to do with multiculturalism on
campus of with any progressive
political agenda," Kennedy says.
"I thought it had everything to do
with facing up to present reality
about where the major institu
tions and ideas in this society
today had come from.
-i ,m¥ A lot of people thought I was
supporting a social agenda," he
says."I wasn't at all. I thought I
was supporting good education."
"We need to make the contri
butions and the experiences of
ethnic and religious minorities
part of a whole variety of courses
that deal, in one way or another,
with contemporary society,"
Kennedy wrote in 1989.
According to Dinesh D'Souza
— the author of "Illiberal Educa
tion" who has been highly critical
of the change to CIV — Kennedy
and other university presidents
"consistently acquiesce in these
demands (from radical students),
abdicating their responsibility to
both the students and the institu
tion itself."
But others feel that the change
to CIV was not enough to remedy
the unnecessary bias toward
Western Culture. CIV is simply "a
name change," according to for
mer Black Student Union Chair
Bacardi Jackson. "There still is
not an emphasis on those other
cultures in CIV."
Jackson says she blames
Kennedy in part for the failure to
enact a more progressive change.
"He always told us that all the
decisions were up to the Faculty
Senate, but the president sets the
tone," she says.
But Camarillo, the UCMI
chair, disagrees.
Kennedy "stuck his neck out
real far on [CIVI and took a lot of
criticism," Camarillo says. But
"he stuck to his guns [since it
wasj an important direction that
Stanford was going in terms of
curricular development."
But because of his leader
ship in the movement,
Kennedy has been the
target of criticism from
both the right and the left during
his time at Stanford.
For the political right,
Kennedy is the instigator of a
flawed program of multicultural
ism. But according to the left, he
has not done enough to foster
racial diversity and understand
ing.
The difference between
Kennedy's multicultural vision of
Stanford and that of more pro
gressive students was clear dur
ing an Orientation program in
Memorial Auditorium on Septem
ber 22, 1989. The occasion fea
tured a speech by Kennedy and
one by Ingrid Nava, a member of
that year's Council of Presidents
who had participated in the
takeover of Kennedy's office the
year before.
Fifty-five students had been
arrested the previous spring as
they seized Kennedy's office,

demanding a face-to-face meeting
with the president as he decided
how to implement the UCMI rec
ommendations. The students also
demanded the creation of a Dis
crimination Grievance Board, and
the hiring of both a full-time Chi
cano community dean and a pro
fessor of Asian-American history.
The takeover put the students
in direct conflict with Kennedy, as
he decided to bring in the police to
settle the conflict. All the stu
dents were arrested and charged
with trespassing. Kennedy, mean
while, was heavily criticized for
relying on the police rather than
direct negotiation.
Kennedy, seeking to temper the
enthusiasm for radical actions
demonstrated in the takeover, told
the incoming freshmen and trans
fer students during his next Ori
entation speech that they should
"harbor a healthy mistrust" of
"correct politics" before adopting
a political ideology at Stanford.
"In response to all those who
will invite you to adopt their agen
das and their values, you should
ask hard questions, make them
prove everything twice and then
decide," he said.
Nava, however, sought to over
come what she saw as Kennedy's
bureaucratic resistance by exhort
ing the new students to rally
behind the progressive politics of
the People's Platform, the domi
nant campus political party.
"There comes a time to take
courageous and bold action," she
said in her speech, adding that the
takeover of Kennedy's office had
brought a "creative tension" to
campus.
"My commitment to making
things better on this campus led
me to participate in the takeover
of President Kennedy's office,"
Nava said.
She compared the struggle at
Stanford to that of the civil rights
era, describing a Greensboro,
N.C. incident in which four black
college freshmen protested segre
gation by sitting in at a lunch
counter. "If four students in 1960
did all of that, think of what
mountains your class can move."
While Nava sought to rally stu
dents behind an agenda for social
justice, Kennedy sought to main
tain open discourse on campus.
"There is room at Stanford for
the expression of opinion, even if
it is distasteful or misguided
about general matters of race, or
ethnicity, or religion, or gender or
sexual preference," he told the
audience.
Kennedy needed "to make rad
ical changes rather than the slow
changes that are really not notice
able," former BSU chair Bacardi
Jackson says.
But many of Kennedy's
troubles have come at the
hands of Stanford's polit
ical right. Consistently,
conservatives on campus have
faulted Kennedy for capitulating
to the demands of the progressive
students.
"Diversity, shmiversity," com
plains Hoover Senior Research
Fellow Charles Hill. "Diversity is
in many ways opposite to the
word university. You want to
have a universe of knowledge.
You want to have all its parts
influence or interact with each
other.
"The danger in diversity," he
explains, "is it resulting in frag
mentation — with a bunch of dif
ferent groups running off into
their separate corners and eating
their native foods, instead of
forming a more coherent whole."
To David Sacks, managing edi
tor of the Stanford Review, multi
culturalism is "a massive social
engineering project synthesizing
Maoism, feminism, environmen

talism, collectivism, '60s radical
ism, Jesse Jackson and liberal
guilt."
In a recent analysis of the
Kennedy years printed in the
Review, Sacks attacks the presi
dent as a "limousine liberal" who
"has embraced radical chic not
because of a well defined political
agenda of his own, but because
... his idea of leadership is surf
ing on the crest of trendiness."
According to Hill, the Universi
ty can improve itself "by banning
two words — multiculturalism
and diversity. We have enough
diversity. We don't have to talk
about it as if we were bereft of it,
or as if that's all we care about.
"If I hear one more word about
(diversity) I'm going to scream,"
he says.
One of the main areas in
which little progress
has been made is the
representation of peo
ple of color among the faculty.
According to the Office of Multi
cultural Development, only 8 per
cent of almost 900 tenured faculty
members belong to a minority
group. Only 9.3 percent of these

faculty members are women.
"In terms of pure numbers, we
proved to be more successful in
the student and staff arenas than
with the faculty," Rosse says.
"I think we have the potential
to be the vanguard," says multi
cultural educator Ricks. But "we
ain't the vanguard when it comes
to the faculty."
"I think Kennedy's support
has been significant, but I think
the faculty lags behind," says
Archuleta, the black community's
dean. "The problem lies within
the departments, with the deans
and the faculty not making the
commitment to multicultural
ism."
"We have increased [the num
bers of faculty of color] slightly
during our time here," Kennedy
says frankly. "But it is not satis
factory.
"We have not done enough our
selves to be certain that we are
looking in the right places,
appointing aggressively and tak
ing every step we can to succeed in
what is a very thin market," he
says. "With respect to minority
faculty, we are not doing badly in
comparison to other institutions,
but all institutions are doing
badly.
"I don't think you are going to
see any immediate dramatic
improvement, but I think there
will be improvement," Kennedy
admitted.

"The faculty has grown signifi
cantly older," Kennedy says. "We
need to find ways of bringing the
average age down and making
sure there are lots of opportunities
for people coming into the system
with new ideas."
Ricks agrees with Kennedy's
suggestion to reduce the average
age of the faculty. "It would open
up the doors to a lot of people," he
says.
"The kinds of things we were
able to do will have a payoff,"
Rosse says."The faculty culture is
hard to manage and it is slow to
change. It takes a lot to accom
plish change, but once it does
change it is hard to go back."
"My sense is that there are
more and more faculty who have
now invested in (multicultural)
curriculum development," says
Cecelia Burciaga, a former affir
mative action officer.
Continued budget cuts and
a new president leave the
future of multicultural
ism in doubt. Many facul
ty and students express concern
that the achievements of the past
could be forgotten in the upcom-

ing years.
"I have a lot of worries," Bac
ardi Jackson muses. "I'm very
concerned" that incoming Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper
has different priorities, she says.
"I think he will not be an advocate
for the students of color."
But according to Burciaga,
"Casper by himself cannot dis
mount it nor mount it" because
multiculturalism is now institu
tionalized at Stanford.
Despite the uncertainty,
"Stanford continues to be in the
vanguard of that movement," for
multiculturalism, says Parker, of
the Office of Multicultural Devel
opment. "Don facilitated Stanford
being in the vanguard. He could
have been the kind of person who
let things wash over him."
But Kennedy "is a leader, so he
did what is expected and neces
sary for a leader to do, .. .to face
the hard issues and to wrestle
with them.
"We are helping to set the
trend and define the movement of
multiculturalism" for other uni
versities to follow, Parker says.
"I think there is a problem
when Stanford compares itself to
other universities because it
makes us stagnate," Bacardi
Jackson says. "We still have a
long way to go. We should com
pare ourselves to what is right,
not to what other universities are
doing."

GB Manriquez — Daily
On the evening of Sept. 28,
1988, two drunken white
students living in East
Lagunita pinned a defaced
poster of Beethoven to the door of a
black student's room in Ujamaa. The
picture had been transformed into a
crude caricature of a black man, with
the stereotypical large lips and afro.
The two white students only meant
the poster to be a joke. They had earli
er that day engaged in a conversation
with the black student on whether
Beethoven had African roots, and their
caricature was apparently intended
only to add their final word to the con
versation.
But the poster, of course, had a very
different effect the next day when the
black student opened his door. Ujamaa
quickly became embroiled in an ugly
flare-up of racial tension, as another
poster — this one with the word "nig
ger" scrawled across it — appeared in
Ujamaa, supposedly the safe haven for
African-Americans on campus.
Although the now-famous "Ujamaa
incident" was not a typical example of

racial relations at Stanford, it never
theless defined much of the campus
discussion in the years to come. It also
presented University President Don
ald Kennedy with an enormous hurdle
to overcome in his goal of creating a
multicultural community at Stanford.
During his 12 years as president,
Kennedy was a prominent leader of
the multicultural movement, as he
tried to encourage the growth of racial
understanding but at the same time
restrain the ambitions of more pro
gressive students. But he modestly
credits himself only as a supporter,
rather than a leader, of the movement.
"I don't think Don was asked to
bring multiculturalism," says Greg

Ricks, Residential Education's multi
cultural educator. "I don't think Don
was asked to bring public service. . . .
But he was able to get his personal
agenda across."
Kennedy had faced hurdles like the
Ujamaa incident before, and he met
this one with the same approach, with
his personal interaction with students
and with his eloquent words that chal
lenged Stanford to overcome its diffi
culties and meet its goals.
This had been the approach that he
used as he argued for the change from
Western Culture to CIV, encouraged
the work of the University Committee
on Minority Issues and struggled to
implement change in the midst of bud
get cutbacks.
He immediately met with students
after the second, more volatile poster
appeared in Ujamaa in an attempt to
calm the racial animosity that had
bubbled to the surface. And in
response to the request of the students
he met that day, he wrote what they
hoped would be a "thoughtful paper"
on racial relations at Stanford.
His approach in his "Reflections on


Chris Eisenberg— Daily file
Protesters who took over University President Donald Kennedy's office in 1989 demanded Kennedy move more swiftly
to implement requests that ranged from hiring an Asian-American tenure-track professor to rescinding a recently
announced tuition hike. Fifty-four students were arrested on account of the protest, the impact of which is still debated.

Multiculturalism
Second in a
four-part series

News analysis
Left: Fliers defaced in the "Uja
maa incident" fueled the free
vs. protected speech debate on

the adoption of a Fundamental
Standard interpretation that
outlawed certain types of
speech. Right: University Presi

August, 1991.

a Racial Understanding," as in
much of his administration, was
even-handed, as he tried to reduce
the tensions and promote under
standing among the represented
races at Stanford. He has consis
tently positioned himself as one of
many leaders of the multicultural
movement, but one who seeks to
encourage racial understanding
and at the same time temper rad
ical political agendas.
"We are among the few places
in this country in which it may be
possible to test the workability of
the multicultural existence that
will, ready or not, be the life of
Californians and Americans in
the twenty-first century,"
Kennedy wrote in his essay,
which was printed in The Daily.
"We are exposing . . . ourselves to
the risk of misunderstanding and
even, when sensitivities are vio
lated as they occasionally will be,
hostility."

While he condemned the insen
sitivity shown in the Ujamaa inci
dent, he also warned against the
dangers of dogmatism.
"Time and again we have seen
the promotion of racial under
standing linked to a more focused
— and less broadly understood
and accepted — political agenda,"
Kennedy wrote. "That kind of
load is probably too heavy for a
delicate structure to bear all at
once."
Kennedy is the first to
admit that he doesn't
deserve all the credit for
many of the multicultur
al changes at Stanford during the
past 12 years.
"I do believe I gave it support,"
he says."I also tried to give it
some restraints. From time to
time I indicated a worry that mul
ticulturalism would become a
kind of political ideology of its
own."
Keith Archuleta, director of

the Black Community Services
Center, says that nevertheless,
Kennedy should receive credit for
the changes made during his
tenure.
"John F. Kennedy didn't build
any spaceships or train any astro
nauts, but he did get credit for
sending someone to the moon. It's
the same with President
Kennedy," Archuleta says. "As a
university president, he did what
he could do, which was to create a
vision."
The Ujamaa incident provided
a somewhat representative
glimpse into Kennedy's leader
ship style in the multicultural
movement at Stanford. Through
out his administration, Kennedy
has ventured to meet with stu
dents to hear their concerns and
has set the tone for discussion in
public statements such as his
"Reflections on a Racial Under
standing."
"He's not afraid to roll up his
sleeves and sit down on the floor

and talk to students," says Dean
of Students Michael Jackson.
"He was very much a support
er, especially of the different com
munities," says former Black Stu
dent Union chair Bacardi Jack
son. "He met with us every quar
ter he was here."
"You know he cared about stu
dents," says Ricks. "You know he
cared about humanity. . . . Don
Kennedy was driven by values
and not by dollars."
As president, Kennedy has con
sistently warned against extremi
ty on both sides of the struggle
and campaigned for open dialogue
and debate. Multiculturalism,
according to Kennedy, should not
be characterized by the alienation
of communities, polarized debate
and extreme tactics. "Creative
experimentation with intermedi
ates is, in my judgment, more
promising," he wrote in his essay.
Many administrators and fac
ulty view Kennedy as the symbol
ic leader of the multicultural
movement at Stanford. According
to Archuleta, Kennedy is the
"moral, spiritual leader" of multi
culturalism, in large part because
he set the tone for the struggle.
"He set in motion serious
attention to the issues of multi
culturalism," says Sharon Parker,
director of the Office of Multicul
tural Development. "I wouldn't
be here if it were not for Don
Kennedy's leadership on multi
culturalism."
Says History Prof. A 1 Camaril
lo, "I think that on the whole his
very vocal leadership on the ques
tion of the importance of multi
culturalism ... is a critical, very
fundamental contribution to this
University."
But Kennedy gives himself
far less credit for the
multicultural movement
than his colleagues do,
instead calling multiculturalism a
result of "institutional momen
tum."
"My own belief is that this was
a direction Stanford was taking,
was inclined to take, because of
where it was in the world and
because of a spiritual direction
that I think is alive here without
encouragement," Kennedy says.
"But I do think sometimes that
the task of leadership is to reflect
the best values of the community
back to itself and to provide a con
stant reminder about those values
in the direction of the institu
tion."
By many standards, the Uni
versity has moved a long way
from the time when Kennedy first
came on the scene as Stanford's
president, although the pace and
direction of change has been criti
cized from all sides.
Many of his early years as pres
ident set the stage for the move
ment as multiculturalism began
to gain momentum. But it was
only in the late 1980s that the
movement began to effect dra
matic change and gain nationwide
attention.
The ground-breaking 1989
report of the University Commit
tee on Minority Issues established
the model for change at Stanford,
as it set forth 117 concrete recom
mendations for the University to
implement. The committee spent
18 months studying the environ
ment at Stanford for people of
color, and concluded that the Uni
versity had a long way to go to
make sure all communities felt
comfortable.
"What UCMI did was it did an
incredible investigatory study of
this place, ... of disempowered
people," Ricks says.

Kennedy encouraged the work
of the UCMI, at one point assur
ing Camariilo, its chair, that he
should alert the president's office
if the committee needed addition
al resources.
"It is that type of concrete sup
port" that characterized Kennedy's
administration, Camariilo says.
"He gave a very sincere response to
the UCMI."
"I was happy to see the
UCMI," says Bacardi Jackson,
who served on the UCMI annual
review panel. But "I think a lot
more has to be done around that
report."
Jackson was one of many stu
dents, faculty and staff who pres
sured Kennedy to immediately
implement the UCMI's recom
mendations. However, the Uni
versity's emphasis in the last sev
eral years on budget cuts and indi
rect costs issues stalled much of
the progress.
When asked what fac
tors in his life influ
enced him to involve
himself in a move
ment for multiculturalism,
Kennedy quickly replies, "Stan
ford."
He consistently deflects atten
tion from himself, instead focus
ing on the institution.
"I think it's always terribly dif
ficult when good things happen to
determine whether they hap
pened because of things in the air
or the water or because people in
leadership made good decisions,"
Kennedy says.
For Kennedy, it was simply a
matter of "watching change hap
pen and realizing what a good
thing it is."
In an attempt to explain the
shaping of his values, Kennedy
suddenly drops his jovial
demeanor as he quietly contem
plates his upbringing and his
development over the course of
his 60 years.
"I had a childhood fairly typical
for its time," he thoughtfully
explains, saying that his perspec
tive at the time was "very nar
row."

"My parents were enlightened
but not liberal," Kennedys says. But
"when you grow up you develop
greater understanding of people."
"Most of my lessons in terms of
what is possible come from watch
ing the terrific people at Stan
ford," he quietly says."I didn't
bring anything to the party.
Maybe an instinct for acceptance,
but that's all."
The UCMI report was not
the only area in which
multicultural changes
were made. Other issues
such as the adoption of the
domestic partners housing privi
leges and the amendment of the
Fundamental Standard also dra
matically changed Stanford dur
ing Kennedy's years.
Although Kennedy had little to
do with some of these issues, he
still is alternately credited and
blamed for their accomplishment.
The 1990 Fundamental Stan
dard amendment added a clause
that prohibited hate speech
directed at an individual that
would discriminate "on the basis
of sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or
national or ethnic origin."
The amendment never crossed
Kennedy's desk, but he is still
viewed by many as a leader of the
multicultural movement that
brought it about.
Although he was viewed as
responsible, Kennedy disagreed
with the changes made to the
Fundamental Standard. "I would
have preferred not to legislate in
that area," Kennedy says."I
would probably not have
approved it."
The diversification of the stu
dent body has been one of the
most visible changes in the Uni
versity over the past 10 years, and
Kennedy's appointee Jean Fetter,
former director of undergraduate
admissions, deserves much of the
credit for this progress.
The Asian-American student
population at Stanford, in partic
ular, rose dramatically during

GB Manrique* — Daily
Kennedy's reign, from only 7.3
percent in the incoming 1982
class to 24 percent of the latest
admitted class. Mexican-Ameri
can admittances similarly
increased, from 7.4 percent of the
1979 class to almost 10 percent of
the 1991 incoming class.
Black student enrollment
increased from 7.6 percent in
1979 to over 10 percent in 1988,
but has since declined to its previ
ous level, reflecting a nationwide
decrease in African-American col
lege applicants.
"The increase in Asian-Ameri
cans came about through an
increase in applications and a
greater degree of sensitivity in the
admissions office," Fetter says.
Kennedy "was very encourag
ing to me when I first took on the
job," Fetter says."It was rather

implicit encouragement than
explicit."
"Both Don and [former
Provost James Rosse] were sup
porters and cheerleaders in the
work of admissions," she says.
But according to Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson, the chal
lenge now for Stanford is "moving
from having diversity with
respect to numbers to diversity
with respect to programs."
Fetter agrees. "The easy part is
to change the number at Stan
ford," she says."The hard part is
to build the communities."
Curriculum development
was one of the first areas
in which multicultural
advocates say that Stan
ford began to make substantial
progress during Kennedy's years.
The 1988 change from the
Western Culture requirements to
the more inclusive Cultures, Ideas
and Values was the most visible
development, as Stanford became

the focus of a national debate over
the future of Western education.
Kennedy took a visible role in
campaigning for the changes and
in justifying them after the final
decision was made. He even par
ticipated in a nationally televised
debate against then-Education
Secretary William Bennett, who
argued that the adoption of CIV
constituted the "trashing of West
ern Culture."
"This is a political agenda. This
is not an intellectual agenda,"
Bennett argued. "Stanford's deci
sion . . . was not a product of
enlightened debate but rather an
unfortunate capitulation to pres
sure politics and intimidation."
"I thought (CIV) had a persua
sive list of academic arguments in
its favor that had nothing whatev
er to do with multiculturalism on
campus of with any progressive
political agenda," Kennedy says.
"I thought it had everything to do
with facing up to present reality
about where the major institu
tions and ideas in this society
today had come from.
-i ,m¥ A lot of people thought I was
supporting a social agenda," he
says."I wasn't at all. I thought I
was supporting good education."
"We need to make the contri
butions and the experiences of
ethnic and religious minorities
part of a whole variety of courses
that deal, in one way or another,
with contemporary society,"
Kennedy wrote in 1989.
According to Dinesh D'Souza
— the author of "Illiberal Educa
tion" who has been highly critical
of the change to CIV — Kennedy
and other university presidents
"consistently acquiesce in these
demands (from radical students),
abdicating their responsibility to
both the students and the institu
tion itself."
But others feel that the change
to CIV was not enough to remedy
the unnecessary bias toward
Western Culture. CIV is simply "a
name change," according to for
mer Black Student Union Chair
Bacardi Jackson. "There still is
not an emphasis on those other
cultures in CIV."
Jackson says she blames
Kennedy in part for the failure to
enact a more progressive change.
"He always told us that all the
decisions were up to the Faculty
Senate, but the president sets the
tone," she says.
But Camarillo, the UCMI
chair, disagrees.
Kennedy "stuck his neck out
real far on [CIVI and took a lot of
criticism," Camarillo says. But
"he stuck to his guns [since it
wasj an important direction that
Stanford was going in terms of
curricular development."
But because of his leader
ship in the movement,
Kennedy has been the
target of criticism from
both the right and the left during
his time at Stanford.
For the political right,
Kennedy is the instigator of a
flawed program of multicultural
ism. But according to the left, he
has not done enough to foster
racial diversity and understand
ing.
The difference between
Kennedy's multicultural vision of
Stanford and that of more pro
gressive students was clear dur
ing an Orientation program in
Memorial Auditorium on Septem
ber 22, 1989. The occasion fea
tured a speech by Kennedy and
one by Ingrid Nava, a member of
that year's Council of Presidents
who had participated in the
takeover of Kennedy's office the
year before.
Fifty-five students had been
arrested the previous spring as
they seized Kennedy's office,

demanding a face-to-face meeting
with the president as he decided
how to implement the UCMI rec
ommendations. The students also
demanded the creation of a Dis
crimination Grievance Board, and
the hiring of both a full-time Chi
cano community dean and a pro
fessor of Asian-American history.
The takeover put the students
in direct conflict with Kennedy, as
he decided to bring in the police to
settle the conflict. All the stu
dents were arrested and charged
with trespassing. Kennedy, mean
while, was heavily criticized for
relying on the police rather than
direct negotiation.
Kennedy, seeking to temper the
enthusiasm for radical actions
demonstrated in the takeover, told
the incoming freshmen and trans
fer students during his next Ori
entation speech that they should
"harbor a healthy mistrust" of
"correct politics" before adopting
a political ideology at Stanford.
"In response to all those who
will invite you to adopt their agen
das and their values, you should
ask hard questions, make them
prove everything twice and then
decide," he said.
Nava, however, sought to over
come what she saw as Kennedy's
bureaucratic resistance by exhort
ing the new students to rally
behind the progressive politics of
the People's Platform, the domi
nant campus political party.
"There comes a time to take
courageous and bold action," she
said in her speech, adding that the
takeover of Kennedy's office had
brought a "creative tension" to
campus.
"My commitment to making
things better on this campus led
me to participate in the takeover
of President Kennedy's office,"
Nava said.
She compared the struggle at
Stanford to that of the civil rights
era, describing a Greensboro,
N.C. incident in which four black
college freshmen protested segre
gation by sitting in at a lunch
counter. "If four students in 1960
did all of that, think of what
mountains your class can move."
While Nava sought to rally stu
dents behind an agenda for social
justice, Kennedy sought to main
tain open discourse on campus.
"There is room at Stanford for
the expression of opinion, even if
it is distasteful or misguided
about general matters of race, or
ethnicity, or religion, or gender or
sexual preference," he told the
audience.
Kennedy needed "to make rad
ical changes rather than the slow
changes that are really not notice
able," former BSU chair Bacardi
Jackson says.
But many of Kennedy's
troubles have come at the
hands of Stanford's polit
ical right. Consistently,
conservatives on campus have
faulted Kennedy for capitulating
to the demands of the progressive
students.
"Diversity, shmiversity," com
plains Hoover Senior Research
Fellow Charles Hill. "Diversity is
in many ways opposite to the

You want to have all its parts
influence or interact with each

"The danger in diversity," he
explains, "is it resulting in frag
mentation — with a bunch of dif
ferent groups running off into
their separate corners and eating
their native foods, instead of
forming a more coherent whole."
To David Sacks, managing edi
tor of the Stanford Review, multi
culturalism is "a massive social
engineering project synthesizing
Maoism, feminism, environmen

talism, collectivism, '60s radical
ism, Jesse Jackson and liberal
guilt."
In a recent analysis of the
Kennedy years printed in the
Review, Sacks attacks the presi
dent as a "limousine liberal" who
"has embraced radical chic not
because of a well defined political
agenda of his own, but because
... his idea of leadership is surf
ing on the crest of trendiness."
According to Hill, the Universi
ty can improve itself "by banning
two words — multiculturalism
and diversity. We have enough
diversity. We don't have to talk
about it as if we were bereft of it,
or as if that's all we care about.
"If I hear one more word about
(diversity) I'm going to scream,"
he says.
One of the main areas in
which little progress
has been made is the
representation of peo
ple of color among the faculty.
According to the Office of Multi
cultural Development, only 8 per
cent of almost 900 tenured faculty
members belong to a minority
group. Only 9.3 percent of these

faculty members are women.
"In terms of pure numbers, we
proved to be more successful in
the student and staff arenas than
with the faculty," Rosse says.
"I think we have the potential
to be the vanguard," says multi
cultural educator Ricks. But "we
ain't the vanguard when it comes
to the faculty."
"I think Kennedy's support
has been significant, but I think
the faculty lags behind," says
Archuleta, the black community's
dean. "The problem lies within
the departments, with the deans
and the faculty not making the
commitment to multicultural
ism."
"We have increased [the num
bers of faculty of color] slightly
during our time here," Kennedy
says frankly. "But it is not satis
factory.
"We have not done enough our
selves to be certain that we are
looking in the right places,
appointing aggressively and tak
ing every step we can to succeed in
what is a very thin market," he
says. "With respect to minority
faculty, we are not doing badly in
comparison to other institutions,
but all institutions are doing
badly.
"I don't think you are going to
see any immediate dramatic
improvement, but I think there
will be improvement," Kennedy
admitted.

"The faculty has grown signifi
cantly older," Kennedy says. "We
need to find ways of bringing the
average age down and making
sure there are lots of opportunities
for people coming into the system
with new ideas."
Ricks agrees with Kennedy's
suggestion to reduce the average
age of the faculty. "It would open
up the doors to a lot of people," he
says.
"The kinds of things we were
able to do will have a payoff,"
Rosse says."The faculty culture is
hard to manage and it is slow to
change. It takes a lot to accom
plish change, but once it does
change it is hard to go back."
"My sense is that there are
more and more faculty who have
now invested in (multicultural)
curriculum development," says
Cecelia Burciaga, a former affir
mative action officer.
Continued budget cuts and
a new president leave the
future of multicultural
ism in doubt. Many facul
ty and students express concern
that the achievements of the past
could be forgotten in the upcom-

ing years.
"I have a lot of worries," Bac
ardi Jackson muses. "I'm very
concerned" that incoming Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper
has different priorities, she says.
"I think he will not be an advocate
for the students of color."
But according to Burciaga,
"Casper by himself cannot dis
mount it nor mount it" because
multiculturalism is now institu
tionalized at Stanford.
Despite the uncertainty,
"Stanford continues to be in the
vanguard of that movement," for
multiculturalism, says Parker, of
the Office of Multicultural Devel
opment. "Don facilitated Stanford
being in the vanguard. He could
have been the kind of person who
let things wash over him."
But Kennedy "is a leader, so he
did what is expected and neces
sary for a leader to do, .. .to face
the hard issues and to wrestle
with them.
"We are helping to set the
trend and define the movement of
multiculturalism" for other uni
versities to follow, Parker says.
"I think there is a problem
when Stanford compares itself to
other universities because it
makes us stagnate," Bacardi
Jackson says. "We still have a
long way to go. We should com
pare ourselves to what is right,
not to what other universities are
doing."

GB Manriquez — Daily
On the evening of Sept. 28,
1988, two drunken white
students living in East
Lagunita pinned a defaced
poster of Beethoven to the door of a
black student's room in Ujamaa. The
picture had been transformed into a
crude caricature of a black man, with
the stereotypical large lips and afro.
The two white students only meant
the poster to be a joke. They had earli
er that day engaged in a conversation
with the black student on whether
Beethoven had African roots, and their
caricature was apparently intended
only to add their final word to the con
versation.
But the poster, of course, had a very
different effect the next day when the
black student opened his door. Ujamaa
quickly became embroiled in an ugly
flare-up of racial tension, as another
poster — this one with the word "nig
ger" scrawled across it — appeared in
Ujamaa, supposedly the safe haven for
African-Americans on campus.
Although the now-famous "Ujamaa
incident" was not a typical example of

racial relations at Stanford, it never
theless defined much of the campus
discussion in the years to come. It also
presented University President Don
ald Kennedy with an enormous hurdle
to overcome in his goal of creating a
multicultural community at Stanford.
During his 12 years as president,
Kennedy was a prominent leader of
the multicultural movement, as he
tried to encourage the growth of racial
understanding but at the same time
restrain the ambitions of more pro
gressive students. But he modestly
credits himself only as a supporter,
rather than a leader, of the movement.
"I don't think Don was asked to
bring multiculturalism," says Greg

Ricks, Residential Education's multi
cultural educator. "I don't think Don
was asked to bring public service. . . .
But he was able to get his personal
agenda across."
Kennedy had faced hurdles like the
Ujamaa incident before, and he met
this one with the same approach, with
his personal interaction with students
and with his eloquent words that chal
lenged Stanford to overcome its diffi
culties and meet its goals.
This had been the approach that he
used as he argued for the change from
Western Culture to CIV, encouraged
the work of the University Committee
on Minority Issues and struggled to
implement change in the midst of bud
get cutbacks.
He immediately met with students
after the second, more volatile poster
appeared in Ujamaa in an attempt to
calm the racial animosity that had
bubbled to the surface. And in
response to the request of the students
he met that day, he wrote what they
hoped would be a "thoughtful paper"
on racial relations at Stanford.
His approach in his "Reflections on


Chris Eisenberg— Daily file
Protesters who took over University President Donald Kennedy's office in 1989 demanded Kennedy move more swiftly
to implement requests that ranged from hiring an Asian-American tenure-track professor to rescinding a recently
announced tuition hike. Fifty-four students were arrested on account of the protest, the impact of which is still debated.

Multiculturalism

News analysis

speech. Right: University Presi

August, 1991.

a Racial Understanding," as in
much of his administration, was
even-handed, as he tried to reduce
the tensions and promote under
standing among the represented
races at Stanford. He has consis
tently positioned himself as one of
many leaders of the multicultural
movement, but one who seeks to
encourage racial understanding
and at the same time temper rad
ical political agendas.
"We are among the few places
in this country in which it may be
possible to test the workability of
the multicultural existence that
will, ready or not, be the life of
Californians and Americans in
the twenty-first century,"
Kennedy wrote in his essay,
which was printed in The Daily.
"We are exposing . . . ourselves to
the risk of misunderstanding and
even, when sensitivities are vio
lated as they occasionally will be,
hostility."

While he condemned the insen
sitivity shown in the Ujamaa inci
dent, he also warned against the
dangers of dogmatism.
"Time and again we have seen
the promotion of racial under
standing linked to a more focused
— and less broadly understood
and accepted — political agenda,"
Kennedy wrote. "That kind of
load is probably too heavy for a
delicate structure to bear all at
once."
Kennedy is the first to
admit that he doesn't
deserve all the credit for
many of the multicultur
al changes at Stanford during the
past 12 years.
"I do believe I gave it support,"
he says."I also tried to give it
some restraints. From time to
time I indicated a worry that mul
ticulturalism would become a
kind of political ideology of its
own."
Keith Archuleta, director of

the Black Community Services
Center, says that nevertheless,
Kennedy should receive credit for
the changes made during his
tenure.
"John F. Kennedy didn't build
any spaceships or train any astro
nauts, but he did get credit for
sending someone to the moon. It's
the same with President
Kennedy," Archuleta says. "As a
university president, he did what
he could do, which was to create a
vision."
The Ujamaa incident provided
a somewhat representative
glimpse into Kennedy's leader
ship style in the multicultural
movement at Stanford. Through
out his administration, Kennedy
has ventured to meet with stu
dents to hear their concerns and
has set the tone for discussion in
public statements such as his
"Reflections on a Racial Under
standing."
"He's not afraid to roll up his
sleeves and sit down on the floor

and talk to students," says Dean
of Students Michael Jackson.
"He was very much a support
er, especially of the different com
munities," says former Black Stu
dent Union chair Bacardi Jack
son. "He met with us every quar
ter he was here."
"You know he cared about stu
dents," says Ricks. "You know he
cared about humanity. . . . Don
Kennedy was driven by values
and not by dollars."
As president, Kennedy has con
sistently warned against extremi
ty on both sides of the struggle
and campaigned for open dialogue
and debate. Multiculturalism,
according to Kennedy, should not
be characterized by the alienation
of communities, polarized debate
and extreme tactics. "Creative
experimentation with intermedi
ates is, in my judgment, more
promising," he wrote in his essay.
Many administrators and fac
ulty view Kennedy as the symbol
ic leader of the multicultural
movement at Stanford. According
to Archuleta, Kennedy is the
"moral, spiritual leader" of multi
culturalism, in large part because
he set the tone for the struggle.
"He set in motion serious
attention to the issues of multi
culturalism," says Sharon Parker,
director of the Office of Multicul
tural Development. "I wouldn't
be here if it were not for Don
Kennedy's leadership on multi
culturalism."
Says History Prof. A 1 Camaril
lo, "I think that on the whole his
very vocal leadership on the ques
tion of the importance of multi
culturalism ... is a critical, very
fundamental contribution to this
University."
But Kennedy gives himself
far less credit for the
multicultural movement
than his colleagues do,
instead calling multiculturalism a
result of "institutional momen
tum."
"My own belief is that this was
a direction Stanford was taking,
was inclined to take, because of
where it was in the world and
because of a spiritual direction
that I think is alive here without
encouragement," Kennedy says.
"But I do think sometimes that
the task of leadership is to reflect
the best values of the community
back to itself and to provide a con
stant reminder about those values
in the direction of the institu
tion."
By many standards, the Uni
versity has moved a long way
from the time when Kennedy first
came on the scene as Stanford's
president, although the pace and
direction of change has been criti
cized from all sides.
Many of his early years as pres
ident set the stage for the move
ment as multiculturalism began
to gain momentum. But it was
only in the late 1980s that the
movement began to effect dra
matic change and gain nationwide
attention.
The ground-breaking 1989
report of the University Commit
tee on Minority Issues established
the model for change at Stanford,
as it set forth 117 concrete recom
mendations for the University to
implement. The committee spent
18 months studying the environ
ment at Stanford for people of
color, and concluded that the Uni
versity had a long way to go to
make sure all communities felt
comfortable.
"What UCMI did was it did an
incredible investigatory study of
this place, ... of disempowered
people," Ricks says.

Kennedy encouraged the work
of the UCMI, at one point assur
ing Camariilo, its chair, that he
should alert the president's office
if the committee needed addition
al resources.
"It is that type of concrete sup
port" that characterized Kennedy's
administration, Camariilo says.
"He gave a very sincere response to
the UCMI."
"I was happy to see the
UCMI," says Bacardi Jackson,
who served on the UCMI annual
review panel. But "I think a lot
more has to be done around that
report."
Jackson was one of many stu
dents, faculty and staff who pres
sured Kennedy to immediately
implement the UCMI's recom
mendations. However, the Uni
versity's emphasis in the last sev
eral years on budget cuts and indi
rect costs issues stalled much of
the progress.
When asked what fac
tors in his life influ
enced him to involve
himself in a move
ment for multiculturalism,
Kennedy quickly replies, "Stan
ford."
He consistently deflects atten
tion from himself, instead focus
ing on the institution.
"I think it's always terribly dif
ficult when good things happen to
determine whether they hap
pened because of things in the air
or the water or because people in
leadership made good decisions,"
Kennedy says.
For Kennedy, it was simply a
matter of "watching change hap
pen and realizing what a good
thing it is."
In an attempt to explain the
shaping of his values, Kennedy
suddenly drops his jovial
demeanor as he quietly contem
plates his upbringing and his
development over the course of
his 60 years.
"I had a childhood fairly typical
for its time," he thoughtfully
explains, saying that his perspec
tive at the time was "very nar
row."

"My parents were enlightened
but not liberal," Kennedys says. But
"when you grow up you develop
greater understanding of people."
"Most of my lessons in terms of
what is possible come from watch
ing the terrific people at Stan
ford," he quietly says."I didn't
bring anything to the party.
Maybe an instinct for acceptance,
but that's all."
The UCMI report was not
the only area in which
multicultural changes
were made. Other issues
such as the adoption of the
domestic partners housing privi
leges and the amendment of the
Fundamental Standard also dra
matically changed Stanford dur
ing Kennedy's years.
Although Kennedy had little to
do with some of these issues, he
still is alternately credited and
blamed for their accomplishment.
The 1990 Fundamental Stan
dard amendment added a clause
that prohibited hate speech
directed at an individual that
would discriminate "on the basis
of sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or
national or ethnic origin."
The amendment never crossed
Kennedy's desk, but he is still
viewed by many as a leader of the
multicultural movement that
brought it about.
Although he was viewed as
responsible, Kennedy disagreed
with the changes made to the
Fundamental Standard. "I would
have preferred not to legislate in
that area," Kennedy says."I
would probably not have
approved it."
The diversification of the stu
dent body has been one of the
most visible changes in the Uni
versity over the past 10 years, and
Kennedy's appointee Jean Fetter,
former director of undergraduate
admissions, deserves much of the
credit for this progress.
The Asian-American student
population at Stanford, in partic
ular, rose dramatically during

Kennedy's reign, from only 7.3
percent in the incoming 1982
class to 24 percent of the latest
admitted class. Mexican-Ameri
can admittances similarly
increased, from 7.4 percent of the
1979 class to almost 10 percent of
the 1991 incoming class.
Black student enrollment
increased from 7.6 percent in
1979 to over 10 percent in 1988,
but has since declined to its previ
ous level, reflecting a nationwide
decrease in African-American col
lege applicants.
"The increase in Asian-Ameri
cans came about through an
increase in applications and a
greater degree of sensitivity in the
admissions office," Fetter says.
Kennedy "was very encourag
ing to me when I first took on the
job," Fetter says."It was rather

implicit encouragement than
explicit."
"Both Don and [former
Provost James Rosse] were sup
porters and cheerleaders in the
work of admissions," she says.
But according to Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson, the chal
lenge now for Stanford is "moving
from having diversity with
respect to numbers to diversity
with respect to programs."
Fetter agrees. "The easy part is
to change the number at Stan
ford," she says."The hard part is
to build the communities."
Curriculum development
was one of the first areas
in which multicultural
advocates say that Stan
ford began to make substantial
progress during Kennedy's years.
The 1988 change from the
Western Culture requirements to
the more inclusive Cultures, Ideas
and Values was the most visible
development, as Stanford became

the focus of a national debate over
the future of Western education.
Kennedy took a visible role in
campaigning for the changes and
in justifying them after the final
decision was made. He even par
ticipated in a nationally televised
debate against then-Education
Secretary William Bennett, who
argued that the adoption of CIV
constituted the "trashing of West
ern Culture."
"This is a political agenda. This
is not an intellectual agenda,"
Bennett argued. "Stanford's deci
sion . . . was not a product of
enlightened debate but rather an
unfortunate capitulation to pres
sure politics and intimidation."
"I thought (CIV) had a persua
sive list of academic arguments in
its favor that had nothing whatev
er to do with multiculturalism on
campus of with any progressive
political agenda," Kennedy says.
"I thought it had everything to do
with facing up to present reality
about where the major institu
tions and ideas in this society
today had come from.
-i ,m¥ A lot of people thought I was
supporting a social agenda," he
says."I wasn't at all. I thought I
was supporting good education."
"We need to make the contri
butions and the experiences of
ethnic and religious minorities
part of a whole variety of courses
that deal, in one way or another,
with contemporary society,"
Kennedy wrote in 1989.
According to Dinesh D'Souza
— the author of "Illiberal Educa
tion" who has been highly critical
of the change to CIV — Kennedy
and other university presidents
"consistently acquiesce in these
demands (from radical students),
abdicating their responsibility to
both the students and the institu
tion itself."
But others feel that the change
to CIV was not enough to remedy
the unnecessary bias toward
Western Culture. CIV is simply "a
name change," according to for
mer Black Student Union Chair
Bacardi Jackson. "There still is
not an emphasis on those other
cultures in CIV."
Jackson says she blames
Kennedy in part for the failure to
enact a more progressive change.
"He always told us that all the
decisions were up to the Faculty
Senate, but the president sets the
tone," she says.
But Camarillo, the UCMI
chair, disagrees.
Kennedy "stuck his neck out
real far on [CIVI and took a lot of
criticism," Camarillo says. But
"he stuck to his guns [since it
wasj an important direction that
Stanford was going in terms of
curricular development."
But because of his leader
ship in the movement,
Kennedy has been the
target of criticism from
both the right and the left during
his time at Stanford.
For the political right,
Kennedy is the instigator of a
flawed program of multicultural
ism. But according to the left, he
has not done enough to foster
racial diversity and understand
ing.
The difference between
Kennedy's multicultural vision of
Stanford and that of more pro
gressive students was clear dur
ing an Orientation program in
Memorial Auditorium on Septem
ber 22, 1989. The occasion fea
tured a speech by Kennedy and
one by Ingrid Nava, a member of
that year's Council of Presidents
who had participated in the
takeover of Kennedy's office the
year before.
Fifty-five students had been
arrested the previous spring as
they seized Kennedy's office,

demanding a face-to-face meeting
with the president as he decided
how to implement the UCMI rec
ommendations. The students also
demanded the creation of a Dis
crimination Grievance Board, and
the hiring of both a full-time Chi
cano community dean and a pro
fessor of Asian-American history.
The takeover put the students
in direct conflict with Kennedy, as
he decided to bring in the police to
settle the conflict. All the stu
dents were arrested and charged
with trespassing. Kennedy, mean
while, was heavily criticized for
relying on the police rather than
direct negotiation.
Kennedy, seeking to temper the
enthusiasm for radical actions
demonstrated in the takeover, told
the incoming freshmen and trans
fer students during his next Ori
entation speech that they should
"harbor a healthy mistrust" of
"correct politics" before adopting
a political ideology at Stanford.
"In response to all those who
will invite you to adopt their agen
das and their values, you should
ask hard questions, make them
prove everything twice and then
decide," he said.
Nava, however, sought to over
come what she saw as Kennedy's
bureaucratic resistance by exhort
ing the new students to rally
behind the progressive politics of
the People's Platform, the domi
nant campus political party.
"There comes a time to take
courageous and bold action," she
said in her speech, adding that the
takeover of Kennedy's office had
brought a "creative tension" to
campus.
"My commitment to making
things better on this campus led
me to participate in the takeover
of President Kennedy's office,"
Nava said.
She compared the struggle at
Stanford to that of the civil rights
era, describing a Greensboro,
N.C. incident in which four black
college freshmen protested segre
gation by sitting in at a lunch
counter. "If four students in 1960
did all of that, think of what
mountains your class can move."
While Nava sought to rally stu
dents behind an agenda for social
justice, Kennedy sought to main
tain open discourse on campus.
"There is room at Stanford for
the expression of opinion, even if
it is distasteful or misguided
about general matters of race, or
ethnicity, or religion, or gender or
sexual preference," he told the
audience.
Kennedy needed "to make rad
ical changes rather than the slow
changes that are really not notice
able," former BSU chair Bacardi
Jackson says.
But many of Kennedy's
troubles have come at the
hands of Stanford's polit
ical right. Consistently,
conservatives on campus have
faulted Kennedy for capitulating
to the demands of the progressive
students.
"Diversity, shmiversity," com
plains Hoover Senior Research
Fellow Charles Hill. "Diversity is
in many ways opposite to the
word university. You want to
have a universe of knowledge.
You want to have all its parts
influence or interact with each
other.
"The danger in diversity," he
explains, "is it resulting in frag
mentation — with a bunch of dif
ferent groups running off into
their separate corners and eating
their native foods, instead of
forming a more coherent whole."
To David Sacks, managing edi
tor of the Stanford Review, multi
culturalism is "a massive social
engineering project synthesizing
Maoism, feminism, environmen

talism, collectivism, '60s radical
ism, Jesse Jackson and liberal
guilt."
In a recent analysis of the
Kennedy years printed in the
Review, Sacks attacks the presi
dent as a "limousine liberal" who
"has embraced radical chic not
because of a well defined political
agenda of his own, but because
... his idea of leadership is surf
ing on the crest of trendiness."
According to Hill, the Universi
ty can improve itself "by banning
two words — multiculturalism
and diversity. We have enough
diversity. We don't have to talk
about it as if we were bereft of it,
or as if that's all we care about.
"If I hear one more word about
(diversity) I'm going to scream,"
he says.
One of the main areas in
which little progress
has been made is the
representation of peo
ple of color among the faculty.
According to the Office of Multi
cultural Development, only 8 per
cent of almost 900 tenured faculty
members belong to a minority
group. Only 9.3 percent of these

faculty members are women.
"In terms of pure numbers, we
proved to be more successful in
the student and staff arenas than
with the faculty," Rosse says.
"I think we have the potential
to be the vanguard," says multi
cultural educator Ricks. But "we
ain't the vanguard when it comes
to the faculty."
"I think Kennedy's support
has been significant, but I think
the faculty lags behind," says
Archuleta, the black community's
dean. "The problem lies within
the departments, with the deans
and the faculty not making the
commitment to multicultural
ism."
"We have increased [the num
bers of faculty of color] slightly
during our time here," Kennedy
says frankly. "But it is not satis
factory.
"We have not done enough our
selves to be certain that we are
looking in the right places,
appointing aggressively and tak
ing every step we can to succeed in
what is a very thin market," he
says. "With respect to minority
faculty, we are not doing badly in
comparison to other institutions,
but all institutions are doing
badly.
"I don't think you are going to
see any immediate dramatic
improvement, but I think there
will be improvement," Kennedy
admitted.

"The faculty has grown signifi
cantly older," Kennedy says. "We
need to find ways of bringing the
average age down and making
sure there are lots of opportunities
for people coming into the system
with new ideas."
Ricks agrees with Kennedy's
suggestion to reduce the average
age of the faculty. "It would open
up the doors to a lot of people," he
says.
"The kinds of things we were
able to do will have a payoff,"
Rosse says."The faculty culture is
hard to manage and it is slow to
change. It takes a lot to accom
plish change, but once it does
change it is hard to go back."
"My sense is that there are
more and more faculty who have
now invested in (multicultural)
curriculum development," says
Cecelia Burciaga, a former affir
mative action officer.
Continued budget cuts and
a new president leave the
future of multicultural
ism in doubt. Many facul
ty and students express concern
that the achievements of the past
could be forgotten in the upcom-

ing years.
"I have a lot of worries," Bac
ardi Jackson muses. "I'm very
concerned" that incoming Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper
has different priorities, she says.
"I think he will not be an advocate
for the students of color."
But according to Burciaga,
"Casper by himself cannot dis
mount it nor mount it" because
multiculturalism is now institu
tionalized at Stanford.
Despite the uncertainty,
"Stanford continues to be in the
vanguard of that movement," for
multiculturalism, says Parker, of
the Office of Multicultural Devel
opment. "Don facilitated Stanford
being in the vanguard. He could
have been the kind of person who
let things wash over him."
But Kennedy "is a leader, so he

sary for a leader to do, .. .to face
the hard issues and to wrestle
with them.
"We are helping to set the
trend and define the movement of
multiculturalism" for other uni
versities to follow, Parker says.
"I think there is a problem
when Stanford compares itself to
other universities because it
makes us stagnate," Bacardi

long way to go. We should com
pare ourselves to what is right,
not to what other universities are

GB Manriquez — Daily
On the evening of Sept. 28,
1988, two drunken white
students living in East
Lagunita pinned a defaced
poster of Beethoven to the door of a
black student's room in Ujamaa. The
picture had been transformed into a
crude caricature of a black man, with
the stereotypical large lips and afro.
The two white students only meant
the poster to be a joke. They had earli
er that day engaged in a conversation
with the black student on whether
Beethoven had African roots, and their
caricature was apparently intended
only to add their final word to the con
versation.
But the poster, of course, had a very
different effect the next day when the
black student opened his door. Ujamaa
quickly became embroiled in an ugly
flare-up of racial tension, as another
poster — this one with the word "nig
ger" scrawled across it — appeared in
Ujamaa, supposedly the safe haven for
African-Americans on campus.
Although the now-famous "Ujamaa
incident" was not a typical example of

racial relations at Stanford, it never
theless defined much of the campus
discussion in the years to come. It also
presented University President Don
ald Kennedy with an enormous hurdle
to overcome in his goal of creating a
multicultural community at Stanford.
During his 12 years as president,
Kennedy was a prominent leader of
the multicultural movement, as he
tried to encourage the growth of racial
understanding but at the same time
restrain the ambitions of more pro
gressive students. But he modestly
credits himself only as a supporter,
rather than a leader, of the movement.
"I don't think Don was asked to
bring multiculturalism," says Greg

Ricks, Residential Education's multi
cultural educator. "I don't think Don
was asked to bring public service. . . .
But he was able to get his personal
agenda across."
Kennedy had faced hurdles like the
Ujamaa incident before, and he met
this one with the same approach, with
his personal interaction with students
and with his eloquent words that chal
lenged Stanford to overcome its diffi
culties and meet its goals.
This had been the approach that he
used as he argued for the change from
Western Culture to CIV, encouraged
the work of the University Committee
on Minority Issues and struggled to
implement change in the midst of bud
get cutbacks.
He immediately met with students
after the second, more volatile poster
appeared in Ujamaa in an attempt to
calm the racial animosity that had
bubbled to the surface. And in
response to the request of the students
he met that day, he wrote what they
hoped would be a "thoughtful paper"
on racial relations at Stanford.
His approach in his "Reflections on

Protesters who took over University President Donald Kennedy's office in 1989 demanded Kennedy move more swiftly
to implement requests that ranged from hiring an Asian-American tenure-track professor to rescinding a recently
announced tuition hike. Fifty-four students were arrested on account of the protest, the impact of which is still debated.

a Racial Understanding," as in
much of his administration, was
even-handed, as he tried to reduce
the tensions and promote under
standing among the represented
races at Stanford. He has consis
tently positioned himself as one of
many leaders of the multicultural
movement, but one who seeks to
encourage racial understanding
and at the same time temper rad
ical political agendas.
"We are among the few places
in this country in which it may be
possible to test the workability of
the multicultural existence that
will, ready or not, be the life of
Californians and Americans in
the twenty-first century,"
Kennedy wrote in his essay,
which was printed in The Daily.
"We are exposing . . . ourselves to
the risk of misunderstanding and
even, when sensitivities are vio
lated as they occasionally will be,
hostility."

While he condemned the insen
sitivity shown in the Ujamaa inci
dent, he also warned against the
dangers of dogmatism.
"Time and again we have seen
the promotion of racial under
standing linked to a more focused
— and less broadly understood
and accepted — political agenda,"
Kennedy wrote. "That kind of
load is probably too heavy for a
delicate structure to bear all at
once."
Kennedy is the first to
admit that he doesn't
deserve all the credit for
many of the multicultur
al changes at Stanford during the
past 12 years.
"I do believe I gave it support,"
he says."I also tried to give it
some restraints. From time to
time I indicated a worry that mul
ticulturalism would become a
kind of political ideology of its
own."
Keith Archuleta, director of

the Black Community Services
Center, says that nevertheless,
Kennedy should receive credit for
the changes made during his
tenure.
"John F. Kennedy didn't build
any spaceships or train any astro
nauts, but he did get credit for
sending someone to the moon. It's
the same with President
Kennedy," Archuleta says. "As a
university president, he did what
he could do, which was to create a
vision."
The Ujamaa incident provided
a somewhat representative
glimpse into Kennedy's leader
ship style in the multicultural
movement at Stanford. Through
out his administration, Kennedy
has ventured to meet with stu
dents to hear their concerns and
has set the tone for discussion in
public statements such as his
"Reflections on a Racial Under
standing."
"He's not afraid to roll up his
sleeves and sit down on the floor

and talk to students," says Dean
of Students Michael Jackson.
"He was very much a support
er, especially of the different com
munities," says former Black Stu
dent Union chair Bacardi Jack
son. "He met with us every quar
ter he was here."
"You know he cared about stu
dents," says Ricks. "You know he
cared about humanity. . . . Don
Kennedy was driven by values
and not by dollars."
As president, Kennedy has con
sistently warned against extremi
ty on both sides of the struggle
and campaigned for open dialogue
and debate. Multiculturalism,
according to Kennedy, should not
be characterized by the alienation
of communities, polarized debate
and extreme tactics. "Creative
experimentation with intermedi
ates is, in my judgment, more
promising," he wrote in his essay.
Many administrators and fac
ulty view Kennedy as the symbol
ic leader of the multicultural
movement at Stanford. According
to Archuleta, Kennedy is the
"moral, spiritual leader" of multi
culturalism, in large part because
he set the tone for the struggle.
"He set in motion serious
attention to the issues of multi
culturalism," says Sharon Parker,
director of the Office of Multicul
tural Development. "I wouldn't
be here if it were not for Don
Kennedy's leadership on multi
culturalism."
Says History Prof. A 1 Camaril
lo, "I think that on the whole his
very vocal leadership on the ques
tion of the importance of multi
culturalism ... is a critical, very
fundamental contribution to this
University."
But Kennedy gives himself
far less credit for the
multicultural movement
than his colleagues do,
instead calling multiculturalism a
result of "institutional momen
tum."
"My own belief is that this was
a direction Stanford was taking,
was inclined to take, because of
where it was in the world and
because of a spiritual direction
that I think is alive here without
encouragement," Kennedy says.
"But I do think sometimes that
the task of leadership is to reflect
the best values of the community
back to itself and to provide a con
stant reminder about those values
in the direction of the institu
tion."
By many standards, the Uni
versity has moved a long way
from the time when Kennedy first
came on the scene as Stanford's
president, although the pace and
direction of change has been criti
cized from all sides.
Many of his early years as pres
ident set the stage for the move
ment as multiculturalism began
to gain momentum. But it was
only in the late 1980s that the
movement began to effect dra
matic change and gain nationwide
attention.
The ground-breaking 1989
report of the University Commit
tee on Minority Issues established
the model for change at Stanford,
as it set forth 117 concrete recom
mendations for the University to
implement. The committee spent
18 months studying the environ
ment at Stanford for people of
color, and concluded that the Uni
versity had a long way to go to
make sure all communities felt
comfortable.
"What UCMI did was it did an
incredible investigatory study of
this place, ... of disempowered
people," Ricks says.

Kennedy encouraged the work
of the UCMI, at one point assur
ing Camariilo, its chair, that he
should alert the president's office
if the committee needed addition
al resources.
"It is that type of concrete sup
port" that characterized Kennedy's
administration, Camariilo says.
"He gave a very sincere response to
the UCMI."
"I was happy to see the
UCMI," says Bacardi Jackson,
who served on the UCMI annual
review panel. But "I think a lot
more has to be done around that
report."
Jackson was one of many stu
dents, faculty and staff who pres
sured Kennedy to immediately
implement the UCMI's recom
mendations. However, the Uni
versity's emphasis in the last sev
eral years on budget cuts and indi
rect costs issues stalled much of
the progress.
When asked what fac
tors in his life influ
enced him to involve
himself in a move
ment for multiculturalism,
Kennedy quickly replies, "Stan
ford."
He consistently deflects atten
tion from himself, instead focus
ing on the institution.
"I think it's always terribly dif
ficult when good things happen to
determine whether they hap
pened because of things in the air
or the water or because people in
leadership made good decisions,"
Kennedy says.
For Kennedy, it was simply a
matter of "watching change hap
pen and realizing what a good
thing it is."
In an attempt to explain the
shaping of his values, Kennedy
suddenly drops his jovial
demeanor as he quietly contem
plates his upbringing and his
development over the course of
his 60 years.
"I had a childhood fairly typical
for its time," he thoughtfully
explains, saying that his perspec
tive at the time was "very nar
row."

"My parents were enlightened
but not liberal," Kennedys says. But
"when you grow up you develop
greater understanding of people."
"Most of my lessons in terms of
what is possible come from watch
ing the terrific people at Stan
ford," he quietly says."I didn't
bring anything to the party.
Maybe an instinct for acceptance,
but that's all."
The UCMI report was not
the only area in which
multicultural changes
were made. Other issues
such as the adoption of the
domestic partners housing privi
leges and the amendment of the
Fundamental Standard also dra
matically changed Stanford dur
ing Kennedy's years.
Although Kennedy had little to
do with some of these issues, he
still is alternately credited and
blamed for their accomplishment.
The 1990 Fundamental Stan
dard amendment added a clause
that prohibited hate speech
directed at an individual that
would discriminate "on the basis
of sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or
national or ethnic origin."
The amendment never crossed
Kennedy's desk, but he is still
viewed by many as a leader of the
multicultural movement that
brought it about.
Although he was viewed as
responsible, Kennedy disagreed
with the changes made to the
Fundamental Standard. "I would
have preferred not to legislate in
that area," Kennedy says."I
would probably not have
approved it."
The diversification of the stu
dent body has been one of the
most visible changes in the Uni
versity over the past 10 years, and
Kennedy's appointee Jean Fetter,
former director of undergraduate
admissions, deserves much of the
credit for this progress.
The Asian-American student
population at Stanford, in partic
ular, rose dramatically during

GB Manrique* — Daily
Kennedy's reign, from only 7.3
percent in the incoming 1982
class to 24 percent of the latest
admitted class. Mexican-Ameri
can admittances similarly
increased, from 7.4 percent of the
1979 class to almost 10 percent of
the 1991 incoming class.
Black student enrollment
increased from 7.6 percent in
1979 to over 10 percent in 1988,
but has since declined to its previ
ous level, reflecting a nationwide
decrease in African-American col
lege applicants.
"The increase in Asian-Ameri
cans came about through an
increase in applications and a
greater degree of sensitivity in the
admissions office," Fetter says.
Kennedy "was very encourag
ing to me when I first took on the
job," Fetter says."It was rather

implicit encouragement than
explicit."
"Both Don and [former
Provost James Rosse] were sup
porters and cheerleaders in the
work of admissions," she says.
But according to Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson, the chal
lenge now for Stanford is "moving
from having diversity with
respect to numbers to diversity
with respect to programs."
Fetter agrees. "The easy part is
to change the number at Stan
ford," she says."The hard part is
to build the communities."
Curriculum development
was one of the first areas
in which multicultural
advocates say that Stan
ford began to make substantial
progress during Kennedy's years.
The 1988 change from the
Western Culture requirements to
the more inclusive Cultures, Ideas
and Values was the most visible
development, as Stanford became

the focus of a national debate over
the future of Western education.
Kennedy took a visible role in
campaigning for the changes and
in justifying them after the final
decision was made. He even par
ticipated in a nationally televised
debate against then-Education
Secretary William Bennett, who
argued that the adoption of CIV
constituted the "trashing of West
ern Culture."
"This is a political agenda. This
is not an intellectual agenda,"
Bennett argued. "Stanford's deci
sion . . . was not a product of
enlightened debate but rather an
unfortunate capitulation to pres
sure politics and intimidation."
"I thought (CIV) had a persua
sive list of academic arguments in
its favor that had nothing whatev
er to do with multiculturalism on
campus of with any progressive
political agenda," Kennedy says.
"I thought it had everything to do
with facing up to present reality
about where the major institu
tions and ideas in this society
today had come from.
-i ,m¥ A lot of people thought I was
supporting a social agenda," he
says."I wasn't at all. I thought I
was supporting good education."
"We need to make the contri
butions and the experiences of
ethnic and religious minorities
part of a whole variety of courses
that deal, in one way or another,
with contemporary society,"
Kennedy wrote in 1989.
According to Dinesh D'Souza
— the author of "Illiberal Educa
tion" who has been highly critical
of the change to CIV — Kennedy
and other university presidents
"consistently acquiesce in these
demands (from radical students),
abdicating their responsibility to
both the students and the institu
tion itself."
But others feel that the change
to CIV was not enough to remedy
the unnecessary bias toward
Western Culture. CIV is simply "a
name change," according to for
mer Black Student Union Chair
Bacardi Jackson. "There still is
not an emphasis on those other
cultures in CIV."
Jackson says she blames
Kennedy in part for the failure to
enact a more progressive change.
"He always told us that all the
decisions were up to the Faculty
Senate, but the president sets the
tone," she says.
But Camarillo, the UCMI
chair, disagrees.
Kennedy "stuck his neck out
real far on [CIVI and took a lot of
criticism," Camarillo says. But
"he stuck to his guns [since it
wasj an important direction that
Stanford was going in terms of
curricular development."
But because of his leader
ship in the movement,
Kennedy has been the
target of criticism from
both the right and the left during
his time at Stanford.
For the political right,
Kennedy is the instigator of a
flawed program of multicultural
ism. But according to the left, he
has not done enough to foster
racial diversity and understand
ing.
The difference between
Kennedy's multicultural vision of
Stanford and that of more pro
gressive students was clear dur
ing an Orientation program in
Memorial Auditorium on Septem
ber 22, 1989. The occasion fea
tured a speech by Kennedy and
one by Ingrid Nava, a member of
that year's Council of Presidents
who had participated in the
takeover of Kennedy's office the
year before.
Fifty-five students had been
arrested the previous spring as
they seized Kennedy's office,

demanding a face-to-face meeting
with the president as he decided
how to implement the UCMI rec
ommendations. The students also
demanded the creation of a Dis
crimination Grievance Board, and
the hiring of both a full-time Chi
cano community dean and a pro
fessor of Asian-American history.
The takeover put the students
in direct conflict with Kennedy, as
he decided to bring in the police to
settle the conflict. All the stu
dents were arrested and charged
with trespassing. Kennedy, mean
while, was heavily criticized for
relying on the police rather than
direct negotiation.
Kennedy, seeking to temper the
enthusiasm for radical actions
demonstrated in the takeover, told
the incoming freshmen and trans
fer students during his next Ori
entation speech that they should
"harbor a healthy mistrust" of
"correct politics" before adopting
a political ideology at Stanford.
"In response to all those who
will invite you to adopt their agen
das and their values, you should
ask hard questions, make them
prove everything twice and then
decide," he said.
Nava, however, sought to over
come what she saw as Kennedy's
bureaucratic resistance by exhort
ing the new students to rally
behind the progressive politics of
the People's Platform, the domi
nant campus political party.
"There comes a time to take
courageous and bold action," she
said in her speech, adding that the
takeover of Kennedy's office had
brought a "creative tension" to
campus.
"My commitment to making
things better on this campus led
me to participate in the takeover
of President Kennedy's office,"
Nava said.
She compared the struggle at
Stanford to that of the civil rights
era, describing a Greensboro,
N.C. incident in which four black
college freshmen protested segre
gation by sitting in at a lunch
counter. "If four students in 1960
did all of that, think of what
mountains your class can move."
While Nava sought to rally stu
dents behind an agenda for social
justice, Kennedy sought to main
tain open discourse on campus.
"There is room at Stanford for
the expression of opinion, even if
it is distasteful or misguided
about general matters of race, or
ethnicity, or religion, or gender or
sexual preference," he told the
audience.
Kennedy needed "to make rad
ical changes rather than the slow
changes that are really not notice
able," former BSU chair Bacardi
Jackson says.
But many of Kennedy's
troubles have come at the
hands of Stanford's polit
ical right. Consistently,
conservatives on campus have
faulted Kennedy for capitulating
to the demands of the progressive
students.
"Diversity, shmiversity," com
plains Hoover Senior Research
Fellow Charles Hill. "Diversity is
in many ways opposite to the
word university. You want to
have a universe of knowledge.
You want to have all its parts
influence or interact with each
other.
"The danger in diversity," he
explains, "is it resulting in frag
mentation — with a bunch of dif
ferent groups running off into
their separate corners and eating
their native foods, instead of
forming a more coherent whole."
To David Sacks, managing edi
tor of the Stanford Review, multi
culturalism is "a massive social
engineering project synthesizing
Maoism, feminism, environmen

talism, collectivism, '60s radical
ism, Jesse Jackson and liberal
guilt."
In a recent analysis of the
Kennedy years printed in the
Review, Sacks attacks the presi
dent as a "limousine liberal" who
"has embraced radical chic not
because of a well defined political
agenda of his own, but because
... his idea of leadership is surf
ing on the crest of trendiness."
According to Hill, the Universi
ty can improve itself "by banning
two words — multiculturalism
and diversity. We have enough
diversity. We don't have to talk
about it as if we were bereft of it,
or as if that's all we care about.
"If I hear one more word about
(diversity) I'm going to scream,"
he says.
One of the main areas in
which little progress
has been made is the
representation of peo
ple of color among the faculty.
According to the Office of Multi
cultural Development, only 8 per
cent of almost 900 tenured faculty
members belong to a minority
group. Only 9.3 percent of these

faculty members are women.
"In terms of pure numbers, we
proved to be more successful in
the student and staff arenas than
with the faculty," Rosse says.
"I think we have the potential
to be the vanguard," says multi
cultural educator Ricks. But "we
ain't the vanguard when it comes
to the faculty."
"I think Kennedy's support
has been significant, but I think
the faculty lags behind," says
Archuleta, the black community's
dean. "The problem lies within
the departments, with the deans
and the faculty not making the
commitment to multicultural
ism."
"We have increased [the num
bers of faculty of color] slightly
during our time here," Kennedy
says frankly. "But it is not satis
factory.
"We have not done enough our
selves to be certain that we are
looking in the right places,
appointing aggressively and tak
ing every step we can to succeed in
what is a very thin market," he
says. "With respect to minority
faculty, we are not doing badly in
comparison to other institutions,
but all institutions are doing
badly.
"I don't think you are going to
see any immediate dramatic
improvement, but I think there
will be improvement," Kennedy
admitted.

"The faculty has grown signifi
cantly older," Kennedy says. "We
need to find ways of bringing the
average age down and making
sure there are lots of opportunities
for people coming into the system
with new ideas."
Ricks agrees with Kennedy's
suggestion to reduce the average
age of the faculty. "It would open
up the doors to a lot of people," he
says.
"The kinds of things we were
able to do will have a payoff,"
Rosse says."The faculty culture is
hard to manage and it is slow to
change. It takes a lot to accom
plish change, but once it does
change it is hard to go back."
"My sense is that there are
more and more faculty who have
now invested in (multicultural)
curriculum development," says
Cecelia Burciaga, a former affir
mative action officer.
Continued budget cuts and
a new president leave the
future of multicultural
ism in doubt. Many facul
ty and students express concern
that the achievements of the past
could be forgotten in the upcom-

ing years.
"I have a lot of worries," Bac
ardi Jackson muses. "I'm very
concerned" that incoming Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper
has different priorities, she says.
"I think he will not be an advocate
for the students of color."
But according to Burciaga,
"Casper by himself cannot dis
mount it nor mount it" because
multiculturalism is now institu
tionalized at Stanford.
Despite the uncertainty,
"Stanford continues to be in the
vanguard of that movement," for
multiculturalism, says Parker, of
the Office of Multicultural Devel
opment. "Don facilitated Stanford
being in the vanguard. He could
have been the kind of person who
let things wash over him."
But Kennedy "is a leader, so he
did what is expected and neces
sary for a leader to do, .. .to face
the hard issues and to wrestle
with them.
"We are helping to set the
trend and define the movement of
multiculturalism" for other uni
versities to follow, Parker says.
"I think there is a problem
when Stanford compares itself to
other universities because it
makes us stagnate," Bacardi
Jackson says. "We still have a
long way to go. We should com
pare ourselves to what is right,
not to what other universities are
doing."

GB Manriquez — Daily
On the evening of Sept. 28,
1988, two drunken white
students living in East
Lagunita pinned a defaced
poster of Beethoven to the door of a
black student's room in Ujamaa. The
picture had been transformed into a
crude caricature of a black man, with
the stereotypical large lips and afro.
The two white students only meant
the poster to be a joke. They had earli
er that day engaged in a conversation
with the black student on whether
Beethoven had African roots, and their
caricature was apparently intended
only to add their final word to the con
versation.
But the poster, of course, had a very
different effect the next day when the
black student opened his door. Ujamaa
quickly became embroiled in an ugly
flare-up of racial tension, as another
poster — this one with the word "nig
ger" scrawled across it — appeared in
Ujamaa, supposedly the safe haven for
African-Americans on campus.
Although the now-famous "Ujamaa
incident" was not a typical example of

racial relations at Stanford, it never
theless defined much of the campus
discussion in the years to come. It also
presented University President Don

to overcome in his goal of creating a
multicultural community at Stanford.
During his 12 years as president,
Kennedy was a prominent leader of
the multicultural movement, as he
tried to encourage the growth of racial

the same with President
Kennedy," Archuleta says. "As a
university president, he did what
he could do, which was to create a
vision."
The Ujamaa incident provided
a somewhat representative
glimpse into Kennedy's leader
ship style in the multicultural
movement at Stanford. Through
out his administration, Kennedy
has ventured to meet with stu
dents to hear their concerns and
has set the tone for discussion in
public statements such as his
"Reflections on a Racial Under
standing."
"He's not afraid to roll up his
sleeves and sit down on the floor

and talk to students," says Dean
of Students Michael Jackson.
"He was very much a support
er, especially of the different com
munities," says former Black Stu
dent Union chair Bacardi Jack
son. "He met with us every quar
ter he was here."
"You know he cared about stu
dents," says Ricks. "You know he
cared about humanity. . . . Don
Kennedy was driven by values
and not by dollars."
As president, Kennedy has con
sistently warned against extremi
ty on both sides of the struggle
and campaigned for open dialogue
and debate. Multiculturalism,
according to Kennedy, should not
be characterized by the alienation
of communities, polarized debate
and extreme tactics. "Creative
experimentation with intermedi
ates is, in my judgment, more
promising," he wrote in his essay.
Many administrators and fac
ulty view Kennedy as the symbol
ic leader of the multicultural
movement at Stanford. According
to Archuleta, Kennedy is the
"moral, spiritual leader" of multi
culturalism, in large part because
he set the tone for the struggle.
"He set in motion serious
attention to the issues of multi
culturalism," says Sharon Parker,
director of the Office of Multicul
tural Development. "I wouldn't
be here if it were not for Don
Kennedy's leadership on multi
culturalism."
Says History Prof. A 1 Camaril
lo, "I think that on the whole his
very vocal leadership on the ques
tion of the importance of multi
culturalism ... is a critical, very
fundamental contribution to this
University."
But Kennedy gives himself
far less credit for the
multicultural movement
than his colleagues do,
instead calling multiculturalism a
result of "institutional momen
tum."
"My own belief is that this was
a direction Stanford was taking,
was inclined to take, because of
where it was in the world and
because of a spiritual direction
that I think is alive here without
encouragement," Kennedy says.
"But I do think sometimes that
the task of leadership is to reflect
the best values of the community
back to itself and to provide a con
stant reminder about those values
in the direction of the institu
tion."
By many standards, the Uni
versity has moved a long way
from the time when Kennedy first
came on the scene as Stanford's
president, although the pace and
direction of change has been criti
cized from all sides.
Many of his early years as pres
ident set the stage for the move
ment as multiculturalism began
to gain momentum. But it was
only in the late 1980s that the
movement began to effect dra
matic change and gain nationwide
attention.
The ground-breaking 1989
report of the University Commit
tee on Minority Issues established
the model for change at Stanford,
as it set forth 117 concrete recom
mendations for the University to
implement. The committee spent
18 months studying the environ
ment at Stanford for people of
color, and concluded that the Uni
versity had a long way to go to
make sure all communities felt
comfortable.
"What UCMI did was it did an
incredible investigatory study of
this place, ... of disempowered
people," Ricks says.

Kennedy encouraged the work
of the UCMI, at one point assur
ing Camariilo, its chair, that he
should alert the president's office
if the committee needed addition
al resources.
"It is that type of concrete sup
port" that characterized Kennedy's
administration, Camariilo says.
"He gave a very sincere response to
the UCMI."
"I was happy to see the
UCMI," says Bacardi Jackson,
who served on the UCMI annual
review panel. But "I think a lot
more has to be done around that
report."
Jackson was one of many stu
dents, faculty and staff who pres
sured Kennedy to immediately
implement the UCMI's recom
mendations. However, the Uni
versity's emphasis in the last sev
eral years on budget cuts and indi
rect costs issues stalled much of
the progress.
When asked what fac
tors in his life influ
enced him to involve
himself in a move
ment for multiculturalism,
Kennedy quickly replies, "Stan
ford."
He consistently deflects atten
tion from himself, instead focus
ing on the institution.
"I think it's always terribly dif
ficult when good things happen to
determine whether they hap
pened because of things in the air
or the water or because people in
leadership made good decisions,"
Kennedy says.
For Kennedy, it was simply a
matter of "watching change hap
pen and realizing what a good
thing it is."
In an attempt to explain the
shaping of his values, Kennedy
suddenly drops his jovial
demeanor as he quietly contem
plates his upbringing and his
development over the course of
his 60 years.
"I had a childhood fairly typical
for its time," he thoughtfully
explains, saying that his perspec
tive at the time was "very nar
row."

"My parents were enlightened
but not liberal," Kennedys says. But
"when you grow up you develop
greater understanding of people."
"Most of my lessons in terms of
what is possible come from watch
ing the terrific people at Stan
ford," he quietly says."I didn't
bring anything to the party.
Maybe an instinct for acceptance,
but that's all."
The UCMI report was not
the only area in which
multicultural changes
were made. Other issues
such as the adoption of the
domestic partners housing privi
leges and the amendment of the
Fundamental Standard also dra
matically changed Stanford dur
ing Kennedy's years.
Although Kennedy had little to
do with some of these issues, he
still is alternately credited and
blamed for their accomplishment.
The 1990 Fundamental Stan
dard amendment added a clause
that prohibited hate speech
directed at an individual that
would discriminate "on the basis
of sex, race, color, handicap, reli
gion, sexual orientation, or
national or ethnic origin."
The amendment never crossed
Kennedy's desk, but he is still
viewed by many as a leader of the
multicultural movement that
brought it about.
Although he was viewed as
responsible, Kennedy disagreed
with the changes made to the
Fundamental Standard. "I would
have preferred not to legislate in
that area," Kennedy says."I
would probably not have
approved it."
The diversification of the stu
dent body has been one of the
most visible changes in the Uni
versity over the past 10 years, and
Kennedy's appointee Jean Fetter,
former director of undergraduate
admissions, deserves much of the
credit for this progress.

population at Stanford, in partic
ular, rose dramatically during

Kennedy's reign, from only 7.3
percent in the incoming 1982
class to 24 percent of the latest
admitted class. Mexican-Ameri
can admittances similarly
increased, from 7.4 percent of the
1979 class to almost 10 percent of
the 1991 incoming class.
Black student enrollment
increased from 7.6 percent in
1979 to over 10 percent in 1988,
but has since declined to its previ
ous level, reflecting a nationwide
decrease in African-American col
lege applicants.
"The increase in Asian-Ameri
cans came about through an
increase in applications and a
greater degree of sensitivity in the
admissions office," Fetter says.
Kennedy "was very encourag
ing to me when I first took on the
job," Fetter says."It was rather

implicit encouragement than
explicit."
"Both Don and [former
Provost James Rosse] were sup
porters and cheerleaders in the
work of admissions," she says.
But according to Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson, the chal
lenge now for Stanford is "moving
from having diversity with
respect to numbers to diversity
with respect to programs."
Fetter agrees. "The easy part is
to change the number at Stan
ford," she says."The hard part is
to build the communities."
Curriculum development
was one of the first areas
in which multicultural
advocates say that Stan
ford began to make substantial
progress during Kennedy's years.
The 1988 change from the
Western Culture requirements to
the more inclusive Cultures, Ideas
and Values was the most visible
development, as Stanford became

the focus of a national debate over
the future of Western education.
Kennedy took a visible role in
campaigning for the changes and
in justifying them after the final
decision was made. He even par
ticipated in a nationally televised
debate against then-Education
Secretary William Bennett, who
argued that the adoption of CIV
constituted the "trashing of West
ern Culture."
"This is a political agenda. This
is not an intellectual agenda,"
Bennett argued. "Stanford's deci
sion . . . was not a product of
enlightened debate but rather an
unfortunate capitulation to pres
sure politics and intimidation."
"I thought (CIV) had a persua
sive list of academic arguments in
its favor that had nothing whatev
er to do with multiculturalism on
campus of with any progressive
political agenda," Kennedy says.
"I thought it had everything to do
with facing up to present reality
about where the major institu
tions and ideas in this society
today had come from.
-i ,m¥ A lot of people thought I was
supporting a social agenda," he
says."I wasn't at all. I thought I
was supporting good education."
"We need to make the contri
butions and the experiences of
ethnic and religious minorities
part of a whole variety of courses
that deal, in one way or another,
with contemporary society,"
Kennedy wrote in 1989.
According to Dinesh D'Souza
— the author of "Illiberal Educa
tion" who has been highly critical
of the change to CIV — Kennedy
and other university presidents
"consistently acquiesce in these
demands (from radical students),
abdicating their responsibility to
both the students and the institu
tion itself."
But others feel that the change
to CIV was not enough to remedy
the unnecessary bias toward
Western Culture. CIV is simply "a
name change," according to for
mer Black Student Union Chair
Bacardi Jackson. "There still is
not an emphasis on those other
cultures in CIV."
Jackson says she blames
Kennedy in part for the failure to
enact a more progressive change.
"He always told us that all the
decisions were up to the Faculty
Senate, but the president sets the
tone," she says.
But Camarillo, the UCMI
chair, disagrees.
Kennedy "stuck his neck out
real far on [CIVI and took a lot of
criticism," Camarillo says. But
"he stuck to his guns [since it
wasj an important direction that
Stanford was going in terms of
curricular development."
But because of his leader
ship in the movement,
Kennedy has been the
target of criticism from
both the right and the left during
his time at Stanford.
For the political right,
Kennedy is the instigator of a
flawed program of multicultural
ism. But according to the left, he
has not done enough to foster
racial diversity and understand
ing.
The difference between
Kennedy's multicultural vision of
Stanford and that of more pro
gressive students was clear dur
ing an Orientation program in
Memorial Auditorium on Septem
ber 22, 1989. The occasion fea
tured a speech by Kennedy and
one by Ingrid Nava, a member of
that year's Council of Presidents
who had participated in the
takeover of Kennedy's office the
year before.
Fifty-five students had been
arrested the previous spring as
they seized Kennedy's office,

demanding a face-to-face meeting
with the president as he decided
how to implement the UCMI rec
ommendations. The students also
demanded the creation of a Dis
crimination Grievance Board, and
the hiring of both a full-time Chi
cano community dean and a pro
fessor of Asian-American history.
The takeover put the students
in direct conflict with Kennedy, as
he decided to bring in the police to
settle the conflict. All the stu
dents were arrested and charged
with trespassing. Kennedy, mean
while, was heavily criticized for
relying on the police rather than
direct negotiation.
Kennedy, seeking to temper the
enthusiasm for radical actions
demonstrated in the takeover, told
the incoming freshmen and trans
fer students during his next Ori
entation speech that they should
"harbor a healthy mistrust" of
"correct politics" before adopting
a political ideology at Stanford.
"In response to all those who
will invite you to adopt their agen
das and their values, you should
ask hard questions, make them
prove everything twice and then
decide," he said.
Nava, however, sought to over
come what she saw as Kennedy's
bureaucratic resistance by exhort
ing the new students to rally
behind the progressive politics of
the People's Platform, the domi
nant campus political party.
"There comes a time to take
courageous and bold action," she
said in her speech, adding that the
takeover of Kennedy's office had
brought a "creative tension" to
campus.
"My commitment to making
things better on this campus led
me to participate in the takeover
of President Kennedy's office,"
Nava said.
She compared the struggle at
Stanford to that of the civil rights
era, describing a Greensboro,
N.C. incident in which four black
college freshmen protested segre
gation by sitting in at a lunch
counter. "If four students in 1960
did all of that, think of what
mountains your class can move."
While Nava sought to rally stu
dents behind an agenda for social
justice, Kennedy sought to main
tain open discourse on campus.
"There is room at Stanford for
the expression of opinion, even if
it is distasteful or misguided
about general matters of race, or
ethnicity, or religion, or gender or
sexual preference," he told the
audience.
Kennedy needed "to make rad
ical changes rather than the slow
changes that are really not notice
able," former BSU chair Bacardi
Jackson says.
But many of Kennedy's
troubles have come at the
hands of Stanford's polit
ical right. Consistently,
conservatives on campus have
faulted Kennedy for capitulating
to the demands of the progressive
students.
"Diversity, shmiversity," com
plains Hoover Senior Research
Fellow Charles Hill. "Diversity is
in many ways opposite to the
word university. You want to
have a universe of knowledge.
You want to have all its parts
influence or interact with each
other.
"The danger in diversity," he
explains, "is it resulting in frag
mentation — with a bunch of dif
ferent groups running off into
their separate corners and eating
their native foods, instead of
forming a more coherent whole."
To David Sacks, managing edi
tor of the Stanford Review, multi
culturalism is "a massive social
engineering project synthesizing
Maoism, feminism, environmen

talism, collectivism, '60s radical
ism, Jesse Jackson and liberal
guilt."
In a recent analysis of the
Kennedy years printed in the
Review, Sacks attacks the presi
dent as a "limousine liberal" who
"has embraced radical chic not
because of a well defined political
agenda of his own, but because
... his idea of leadership is surf
ing on the crest of trendiness."
According to Hill, the Universi
ty can improve itself "by banning
two words — multiculturalism
and diversity. We have enough
diversity. We don't have to talk
about it as if we were bereft of it,
or as if that's all we care about.
"If I hear one more word about
(diversity) I'm going to scream,"
he says.
One of the main areas in
which little progress
has been made is the
representation of peo
ple of color among the faculty.
According to the Office of Multi
cultural Development, only 8 per
cent of almost 900 tenured faculty
members belong to a minority
group. Only 9.3 percent of these

faculty members are women.
"In terms of pure numbers, we
proved to be more successful in
the student and staff arenas than
with the faculty," Rosse says.
"I think we have the potential
to be the vanguard," says multi
cultural educator Ricks. But "we
ain't the vanguard when it comes
to the faculty."
"I think Kennedy's support
has been significant, but I think
the faculty lags behind," says
Archuleta, the black community's
dean. "The problem lies within
the departments, with the deans
and the faculty not making the
commitment to multicultural
ism."
"We have increased [the num
bers of faculty of color] slightly
during our time here," Kennedy
says frankly. "But it is not satis
factory.
"We have not done enough our
selves to be certain that we are
looking in the right places,
appointing aggressively and tak
ing every step we can to succeed in
what is a very thin market," he
says. "With respect to minority
faculty, we are not doing badly in
comparison to other institutions,
but all institutions are doing
badly.
"I don't think you are going to
see any immediate dramatic
improvement, but I think there
will be improvement," Kennedy
admitted.

"The faculty has grown signifi
cantly older," Kennedy says. "We
need to find ways of bringing the
average age down and making
sure there are lots of opportunities
for people coming into the system
with new ideas."
Ricks agrees with Kennedy's
suggestion to reduce the average
age of the faculty. "It would open
up the doors to a lot of people," he
says.
"The kinds of things we were
able to do will have a payoff,"
Rosse says."The faculty culture is
hard to manage and it is slow to
change. It takes a lot to accom
plish change, but once it does
change it is hard to go back."
"My sense is that there are
more and more faculty who have
now invested in (multicultural)
curriculum development," says
Cecelia Burciaga, a former affir
mative action officer.
Continued budget cuts and
a new president leave the
future of multicultural
ism in doubt. Many facul
ty and students express concern
that the achievements of the past
could be forgotten in the upcom-

ing years.
"I have a lot of worries," Bac
ardi Jackson muses. "I'm very
concerned" that incoming Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper
has different priorities, she says.
"I think he will not be an advocate
for the students of color."
But according to Burciaga,
"Casper by himself cannot dis
mount it nor mount it" because
multiculturalism is now institu
tionalized at Stanford.
Despite the uncertainty,
"Stanford continues to be in the
vanguard of that movement," for
multiculturalism, says Parker, of
the Office of Multicultural Devel
opment. "Don facilitated Stanford
being in the vanguard. He could
have been the kind of person who
let things wash over him."
But Kennedy "is a leader, so he
did what is expected and neces
sary for a leader to do, .. .to face
the hard issues and to wrestle
with them.
"We are helping to set the
trend and define the movement of
multiculturalism" for other uni
versities to follow, Parker says.
"I think there is a problem
when Stanford compares itself to
other universities because it
makes us stagnate," Bacardi
Jackson says. "We still have a
long way to go. We should com
pare ourselves to what is right,
not to what other universities are
doing."
