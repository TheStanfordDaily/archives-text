# Changing the face of Stanford
## Kennedy leaves behind legacy of multiculturalism 
### Michael Friedly Senior staff writer 
On the evening of Sept. 28,
1988, two drunken white
students living in East
Lagunita pinned a defaced
poster of Beethoven to the door of a
black student's room in Ujamaa. The
picture had been transformed into a
crude caricature of a black man, with
the stereotypical large lips and afro.
The two white students only meant
the poster to be a joke. They had earli
er that day engaged in a conversation
with the black student on whether
Beethoven had African roots, and their
caricature was apparently intended
only to add their final word to the con
versation.
But the poster, of course, had a very
different effect the next day when the
black student opened his door. Ujamaa
quickly became embroiled in an ugly
flare-up of racial tension, as another
poster — this one with the word "nig
ger" scrawled across it — appeared in
Ujamaa, supposedly the safe haven for
African-Americans on campus.
Although the now-famous "Ujamaa
incident" was not a typical example of

racial relations at Stanford, it never
theless defined much of the campus
discussion in the years to come. It also
presented University President Don
ald Kennedy with an enormous hurdle
to overcome in his goal of creating a
multicultural community at Stanford.
During his 12 years as president,
Kennedy was a prominent leader of
the multicultural movement, as he
tried to encourage the growth of racial
understanding but at the same time
restrain the ambitions of more pro
gressive students. But he modestly
credits himself only as a supporter,
rather than a leader, of the movement.
"I don't think Don was asked to
bring multiculturalism," says Greg

Ricks, Residential Education's multi
cultural educator. "I don't think Don
was asked to bring public service. . . .
But he was able to get his personal
agenda across."
Kennedy had faced hurdles like the
Ujamaa incident before, and he met
this one with the same approach, with
his personal interaction with students
and with his eloquent words that chal
lenged Stanford to overcome its diffi
culties and meet its goals.
This had been the approach that he
used as he argued for the change from
Western Culture to CIV, encouraged
the work of the University Committee
on Minority Issues and struggled to
implement change in the midst of bud
get cutbacks.
He immediately met with students
after the second, more volatile poster
appeared in Ujamaa in an attempt to
calm the racial animosity that had
bubbled to the surface. And in
response to the request of the students
he met that day, he wrote what they
hoped would be a "thoughtful paper"
on racial relations at Stanford.
His approach in his "Reflections on

Protesters who took over University President Donald Kennedy's office in 1989 demanded Kennedy move more swiftly
to implement requests that ranged from hiring an Asian-American tenure-track professor to rescinding a recently
announced tuition hike. Fifty-four students were arrested on account of the protest, the impact of which is still debated.
