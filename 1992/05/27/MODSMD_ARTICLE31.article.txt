## 
### Lydia Lee Staff writer 
Stressing the need for positive images
of Asian-Americans in the media, sever
al prominent community members
talked, danced and joked their way
through a celebration of "Asian/Pacific
Islander Heritage Month" last night in
Kresge Auditorium.
"Voices for Change: Strengthening
Asian American Images in the '90s"
highlighted the many and disparate
fields of Asian-American achievement.
Dale Minami, the civil rights expert
and attorney who won the case granting
reparations to Japanese-Americans
interned during World War 11, opened
the event.
He discussed the history of racial
stereotypes that continue to pervade the
public consciousness today.
Early images were of "despicable,
contemptible . . . mongrel hordes" of
Chinese, according to Minami.
He pointed out that the term "yel
low journalism" was coined during the
beginning of the Japanese intern
ment.
Today, he said, there is a revival of
anti-Japanese sentiment, which the
media promotes through "blatant pan
dering to deeply held racist senti

merits."
Minami, who was introduced as an
attorney, a teacher and a model for the
"Asian/Pacific Islander Men Calendar,"
joked about the notoriety he has gained
for the latter.
"My fear is, when I die, my tombstone
will read 'Dale Minami, Mr. June.' " He
added that this reputation is testament
to how important the media is in the cre
ation of images.
Media images, Minami said, "define
reality for those who have little contact
with Asian-Americans."
"There is a flowering of Asian/Pacific
Islander artists" who are defining that
identity for themselves, but also for the
American public, Minami said.
"Art is a necessity ... a political act,"
he added.
Later in the program, when Korean-
American comedian Margaret Cho drew
attention to Asian-American stereo
types in the media and on the street, the
multi-ethnic crowd roared with recogni
tion.
"I didn't study theater for 12 years to
say, 'Rambo, NO!"' Cho said, referring
to her experience with auditions.
Continuing her commentary on
Asian stereotyping, Cho said that dur
ing a recent visit to the South, she was
called "chink."

Cho responded, "Chink? I'm Korean.
I'm a gook. If you're going to be racist,
you might as well get your terminology
straight."
B.D. Wong, an Asian-American actor
who made his Broadway debut in "M.
Butterfly," shared a personal narrative
about growing up Asian-American.
"On TV, there is no realistic repre
sentation of Asians as Americans," he
said. On television, "our barometer of
all that is American" is represented by
Caucasians, Wong said wryly.
Wong described himself as being
afflicted with "racial anorexia" as a
young person.
"I convinced myself I was white,"
said Wong, explaining that just as
anorexia convinces a person that thin
ness will cure all their problems, he
thought being white would solve his
problems.
Wong said he feels it is "a noble and
important quest" to keep children from
feeling as he did.
Kulingtang Arts, members of the
artists-in-residence program at Stan
ford, also performed in the celebration
last night.
Presenting a blend of American and
Pilipino aesthetics, the group performed
several instrumental works and two
dances.
