Clinton takes Kentucky
(AP) — Bill Clinton won primaries in Kentucky
and his home state of Arkansas yesterday and bid
for an Idaho triumph as he drove toward the Demo
cratic presidential nomination. Ross Perot also
flashed his appeal as "uncommitted" voters turned
out in strength in Republican and Democratic races.
Clinton seemed on track for clinching his
party's nomination next week, when California
and five other states close out the primary season.
President Bush, his renomination secure, was
winning primaries in all three states in a race long
since drained of suspense.
But the prospect of a three-way general elec
tion campaign in a year of voter unrest made the
uncommitted showing all the more striking. That
was particularly true in Kentucky, where Perot
supporters were urged in advance to use the
uncommitted line to register their support for the
Texas billionaire.
In the Democratic race in Kentucky, the
Arkansas governor won 56 percent of the vote, to
28 percent for uncommitted in final returns. A
fading Jerry Brown polled 8 percent.
With 56 percent of Arkansas precincts report
ing, Clinton had 68 percent. Uncommitted polled
18 percent and Brown had 11.
In Republican presidential balloting, Bush had

74 percent in Kentucky to 26 percent for uncom
mitted. Conservative rival Patrick Buchanan was
not on the ballot.
In Arkansas, with 40 percent of the precincts
reporting, Bush was leading for 87 percent to
Buchanan's 13 percent.
Black teens reject mainstream
NEW YORK (AP) — Black leaders such as Jesse
Jackson or Magic Johnson are no more effective
than President Bush in reaching urban black teen
agers, who would rather die than be ostracized for
discussing drugs or safe sex, a study found.
The study found that the teen-agers — who
describe themselves as members of the "hip-hop
generation" after the rap-influenced music popu
lar in the inner city — reject mainstream black
culture as thoroughly as they reject white culture.
"Inner-city teens would be delighted to meet
their favorite NBA star if he came to their school
to speak against drugs," said the study, released
yesterday. "But they would discount the appear
ance as 'playing the game' — performing one of
the obligations of celebrity."
The two-year, $100,000 study, called "Reaching
the Hip-Hop Generation," was done by Ivan Juzang
and colleagues at MEE Productions, a black-owned
market-research firm in Philadelphia.
