# Thief pilfers goodies from Stern
## Blueberry muffin fan finds cash registers empty 
### Peter Robison Julia Sobrevilla Editorial staff 
About $100 worth of items —
including cereal, five dozen blue
berry muffins and two Coca-Cola
wall clocks — were stolen from
Stern Hall's Food Service office
over the weekend by a "selective"
thief, Food Service managers
said.
The thief is also suspected of
"playing at" the cash registers in
Stern's dining hall, but made
away with no cash because none is
kept in the registers at night,
according to Karen Aow, Stern

late night manager.
Stern Food Service employees
reported the theft to Stanford
Police shortly after they arrived
for work at 6 a.m. yesterday
morning and discovered "glass
everywhere" because one of the
office windows had been broken,
Aow said.
Other than the broken win
dow, there was no evidence of the
crime, she said.
Whoever stole the cereal,
muffins and clocks was "pretty
neat about it," said Roger
Toguchi, assistant food service
manager in Stern.
He said the crime must have

occurred between 7:30 p.m. Sun
day night, when Stern Food Ser
vice closed, and 6 a.m. yesterday
morning, when workers arrived.
According to Toguchi, Food
Service employees "laughed
about" how "selective" the thief
was after they realized that he
took only blueberry muffins,
although other kinds were avail
able.
Aow said Stern's Food Service
is not planning to do anything "in
particular" to prevent thefts in
the future, other than making
"sure everything's locked."
Stanford Police could not be
reached for comment.
