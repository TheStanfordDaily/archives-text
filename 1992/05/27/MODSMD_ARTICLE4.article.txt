# Beating the college student's budget woes
## Students swap sperm for cash 
### Angie Chuang Editorial staff 
Watching "Debbie Does Dal
las" is all in a day's work for
one Stanford student. This
porn classic and other similar
flicks are provided by his
employers for inspiration.
"Jack" works twice a week,
for approximately 20 minutes.
He earns $70 a week for the
fruits — or seeds, rather — of his
labor as a sperm donor for Palo
Alto's California Cryobank.
Karen Fox, manager of the
cryobank, said most of their
donors are Stanford students.
Because the anonymity of
donors is carefully protected, she
could not release the number of
students involved, and Jack's
real name could not be revealed.

donors — Stanford and UC-Berke
ley in the north, and UCLA and
USC in the south, according to
Rhonda Wilken, director of market
ing in the Los Angeles central office.
Jack said donating sperm was a
childhood dream for him, "like
wanting to be a fireman."
"For some reason, ever since I
heard that this process was possi
ble, I thought it was a neat idea,"
he said.
Of course, Jack had to face the
moral questions associated with
biologically fathering children he
would never know."It was a very
hard decision," he said.
His final decision was based on
his philosophy that a child's
parentage is determined "by who
raises him or her rather than the
biological factors. And I knew
that these children would go to
families who wanted them."
He does not foresee someday
wondering about children who
look like him. "At least I hope not
— there are plenty of kids who
look like me," he said.
Jack explained that he will not
view the children who share his
genes as his own. "They belong to
the family who is raising them,"
he said.
Tough criteria
Fox said most potential donors
hear about the cryobank through
the phone book or their ever-pre
sent ad, "Healthy Men Needed,"

in The Daily's classifieds. Some of
their publicity is also through
word-of-mouth, Fox said.
Potential donors are primarily
screened through a preliminary
semen analysis, which measures
sperm count and motility. Fox
said these standards are "much
higher than normal," since many
of the sperm recipients have prob
lems with infertility.
Once the donor passes this initial
test, they are given a complete phys
ical examination and fill out forms
about their family's genetic history.
Although intelligence and
physical appearance would seem
like they would be natural factors
in selection, Wilken said these
characteristics influence a "small
percentage" of the process.
They "don't give donors IQ
tests," she said, but "the fact that
all of our donors must be current
ly attending or have completed
two years in a four-year university
pretty much takes care of that."
A potential donor's physical
features are noticed by the inter
viewer, but Wilken said appear
ance factors very marginally into
the selection.
"What's appealing to me may
not be appealing to you," she
explained. "But if someone has six
toes and we know about it, they are
not going to be in the program."
However, there is a height
requirement — a minimum of 5
feet, 9 inches — for donors. "Clients
simply don't choose donors who are
shorter than that," Wilken
explained.
She said the cryobank accepts 13
to 15 percent of potential donors.

A day on the job
On a typical workday, Jack said
he shows up at the ayobank and is
given his sample bottle, which
"looks like a urinalysis cup." A stick
er signifying his ethnicity is put on
the cup "so they don't mess up."
He goes into one of the collec
tion rooms, which he said looks
like a small bathroom with a sink,
chair and television set. Various
appropriate "stimuli" are provid
ed, such as magazines and movies.
"You choose your form of
entertainment, do your business,
fill the cup and that's pretty much
it," Jack said.
However, it's not always that
easy. "You can't get too involved
in the movie or anything because
if you don't pay attention you can
miss," Jack said — and missing
the cup means no pay.
Once he turns in the donation,
the cryobank puts it in a vial and
it undergoes a slow-freezing pro
cess. The vials are stored in liquid
nitrogen at one hundred and
ninety-six degrees below zero.
Kept at this temperature, the
sperm will last indefinitely.
Jack gets $35 per donation, but
only if he produces enough and
with a high enough sperm count.
Like most men who work for the
cryobank, Jack donates twice a
week. At 20 minutes a shot, his
salary equals about $105 an hour.
As long as he remains healthy,
he is eligible to donate until 10
women are impregnated with his
sperm.
He said he is using his bi-week
ly paychecks to pay for his expens
es at Stanford and saving the rest.

The other side of the vial
When a woman decides to
become a client/recipient, she starts
by filling out an "account contract"
with the cryobank's main office in
Los Angeles, Fox said.
The client then works with a
"genetic counselor" to evaluate her
"medical information and genetic
interests," according to Fox.
The client chooses from a cata
log that lists each donor by an
identification number, height,
weight, hair, eye color, ethnicity
and interests.
The genetic counselor has pho
tos of all the donors, but clients
cannot view the pictures them
selves. The counselors use them
to aid women who want to find a
close match for their husbands.
Then the vials are ordered and
shipped, and the implantation pro
cess is performed. Jack said if the
donor wishes, he will be told when
a client has been impregnated by
his sperm, but nothing more.
Jack said he likes his job
because it is "convenient."
"It's something that's going to
happen anyway — might as well
get paid for it,"he said.
The only complaint he's had
was not with the job itself, but
with the pornography provided by
the cryobank. But his concerns
were immediately met, Jack said.
"I thought one of the movies
was misogynistic and offensive to
women," he said. "So I told Karen
(Fox) and she took it out right
away."
Jack also described the job as the
ultimate study break — it's "total
stress relief," he said with a smile.
