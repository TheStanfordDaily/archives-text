# Energy Sec. Watkins whirls through SLAC
## 
### Grace Lee Staff writer 
On a trip through the Bay Area,
U.S. Secretary of Energy James
Watkins toured the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center for two hours
yesterday, but a SLAC representa
tive said he was unsure whether
Watkins' apparently positive reac
tion to the facility "will translate
into future support for SLAC."
Watkins' tour of SLAC — his
first visit to the center — was
intended to "better inform" him
about SLAC, said Michael Rior
dan, assistant to SLAC director
Burton Richter.
The visit was arranged earlier
this year, before a panel of physi
cists released a report in April that
suggested SLAC's future could be
threatened if a particularly pes
simistic federal budget scenario
plays out. Congress is currently
reassessing funding for high-ener
gy physics research nationwide.
The High Energy Physics Advi
sory Panel, which makes recom
mendations to Congress, exam
ined three different scenarios.
In the worst-case scenario,

SLAC's accelerator facilities
would be shut down by September
1995 and plans to build the "B
factory," a proposed center for
matter and anti-matter research,
would be temporarily suspended.
Riordan said the purpose of the
tour, as it was originally planned,
was "unrelated to budget cuts."
But the possible cuts were dis
cussed during Watkins' visit,
Richter said.
Riordan, who also went on the
tour, said he thought Watkins "was
impressed with SLAC," but added
that he was uncertain whether this
reaction "will translate into future
support for SLAC."
SLAC Assoc. Director Kaye
Lathrop said yesterday's tour was
"especially useful" for showing
Watkins the plans for the $150
million B-factory, which has the
support of California Gov. Pete
Wilson.
"I think it's very important
that the Secretary (of Energy]
understand the unique work that
is done here," Riordan said.
"It was very useful to have
[Watkinsl see" SLAC, Richter
said.
