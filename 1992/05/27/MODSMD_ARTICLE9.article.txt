"Diversity, shmiversity...
The danger in diversity is it
resulting in fragmentation —
with a bunch of different
groups running off into their
separate corners and eating
their native foods, instead of
forming a more coherent
whole."
— Hoover Senior Research
Fellow Charles Hill, on
multiculturalism. See story,
