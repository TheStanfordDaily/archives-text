KEPLER'S PRESE
Richard Price
discussing
Clockers
Richard Price was just 24 when his first
novel, The Wanderers, caused a literary
sensation upon its publication in 1974.
Bloodbrothers and two other novels
followed, but over the past few years Price
has become one of Hollywood's most
successful and admired screenwriters. The
Color of Money — for which he received
an Academy Award nomination—and
Sea of Love are just two of his credits, and
in the spring and fall of 1992 Robert De
Niio will star in two new movies based on
Price's screenplays. Tonight Richard Price
will read from Clockers, an electrifying and
profoundly affecting novel which depicts
the lives of cops and drug dealers trying to
survive in the harrowing but vital
landscape of the American inner city.
