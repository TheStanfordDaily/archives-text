# Controversy's glare scorched Kennedy
## The
						politics of indirect costs proved too hot for Stanford's eighth president

To attack an institution, congression
al subcommittees have learned, one
must find an individual to serve as
the target.
Stanford's point man — and the person
who came to be most closely tied to the indi
rect-cost controversy — was University
President Donald Kennedy.
Through the crisis, Kennedy was por
trayed as a president who failed to keep
watch over his accountants, allowing federal
research funds to be spent on furnishings
and flowers for his home and upkeep of a
University yacht.
"It is a natural reflex to personalize
things and simplify complex issues," said
Doyle McManus, a reporter in the Los Ange
les Times Washington bureau and a member
of Stanford's Board of Trustees. U.S. Rep.
John Dingell "promoted stories that Donald

Kennedy was buying sheets and that gets
more circulation," McManus said. "It fits
more easily into the paradigm of journalistic
scandal."
As the harshest criticism focused upon
him, Kennedy took on the role of embattled
defender of the University, eventually
accepting responsibility for what occurred
and submitting his resignation.
For the past 18 months, indirect costs, a

standard but relatively unknown method of
financing research at universities nation
wide, has been transformed into a buzzword
for the accounting errors that permitted
such extravagance.
Through the intense publicity, people
previously unfamiliar with the intricacies of
federally sponsored research have learned a
great deal as they watched the indirect-cost
rate plummet and the University's budget
deficit grow larger and larger.
But while some took the time to under
stand the details — and separate the facts
from the exaggerated half-truths — of what
has become known as the indirect-cost con
troversy, others did not.
For many, the headlines warning that
Stanford had overcharged the government
hundreds of millions of dollars told the story.
As flashy revelations dominated the cover
age, the public image of Stanford suffered.
