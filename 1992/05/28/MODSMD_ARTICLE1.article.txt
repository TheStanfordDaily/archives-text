# Controversy's glare scorched Kennedy
## The 						politics of indirect costs proved too hot for Stanford's eighth president 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
To attack an institution, congression
al subcommittees have learned, one
must find an individual to serve as
the target.
Stanford's point man — and the person
who came to be most closely tied to the indi
rect-cost controversy — was University
President Donald Kennedy.
Through the crisis, Kennedy was por
trayed as a president who failed to keep
watch over his accountants, allowing federal
research funds to be spent on furnishings
and flowers for his home and upkeep of a
University yacht.
"It is a natural reflex to personalize
things and simplify complex issues," said
Doyle McManus, a reporter in the Los Ange
les Times Washington bureau and a member
of Stanford's Board of Trustees. U.S. Rep.
John Dingell "promoted stories that Donald

Kennedy was buying sheets and that gets
more circulation," McManus said. "It fits
more easily into the paradigm of journalistic
scandal."
As the harshest criticism focused upon
him, Kennedy took on the role of embattled
defender of the University, eventually
accepting responsibility for what occurred
and submitting his resignation.
For the past 18 months, indirect costs, a

standard but relatively unknown method of
financing research at universities nation
wide, has been transformed into a buzzword
for the accounting errors that permitted
such extravagance.
Through the intense publicity, people
previously unfamiliar with the intricacies of
federally sponsored research have learned a
great deal as they watched the indirect-cost
rate plummet and the University's budget
deficit grow larger and larger.
But while some took the time to under
stand the details — and separate the facts
from the exaggerated half-truths — of what
has become known as the indirect-cost con
troversy, others did not.
For many, the headlines warning that
Stanford had overcharged the government
hundreds of millions of dollars told the story.
As flashy revelations dominated the cover
age, the public image of Stanford suffered.

The
Kennedy
Years
Indirect Costs
Third in a
four-part series

News analysis
Yet, despite the painful financial
legacy, many higher education
experts say the University has come
through the controversy with little
permanent damage to its reputa
tion.
Stanford was merely the first —
and most publicized — target in
what has become a nationwide
campaign to reexamine the system
of indirect costs and the extent to
which the federal government
funds higher education.
But as Kennedy leaves office in
August, the damage to his reputa
tion will not be so easy to repair as
questions remain over how he
handled the controversy.
Although a president cannot be
expected to know of every individ
ual financial transaction, many
within the University say
Kennedy was warned of what was
coming and had ample opportuni
ty to prevent the worst of it.
But at the same time, it is easy
for critics to look back and say
something different should have
been done.
And even if Kennedy or others
had taken a different approach to
the controversy, it might not have
had a real effect on what eventu
ally transpired.
Stanford's indirect-cost rate
began to receive heightened
scrutiny in the fall of 1990
after on-campus Navy regu
lator Paul Biddle began loudly
accusing the Navy and the Uni
versity of having negotiated
"cozy" cost accounting agree
ments.
Indirect costs, as everyone on
campus has grown to learn, are
the expenses associated with
research that cannot be attribut
ed to any particular project, such
as utilities and building mainte
nance.
After the initial reports of
wrongdoing, government auditors
began searching through the
records for inappropriate expens
es to leak, and the University's
rate was knocked down from 74
percent to 70 percent during the
winter of last year as the media
played up every new allegation.
After what was widely thought
to be a disastrous hearing before
the House Subcommitee on Over
sight and Investigations on Stan
ford's indirect-cost practices, the

Navy unilaterally canceled almost
100 cost accounting agreements
and slashed the University's rate
to 55.5 percent in April 1991.
Biddle continued his stream of
accusations through the summer
and following fall, suggesting the
University had overcharged the
government more than $300 mil
lion during the 1980s. He also
filed a qui tarn suit seeking per
sonal reward for the alleged over
billing.
Since then, Biddle has left
Stanford, and the University has
argued that a few isolated mis
takes among three million trans
actions do not indicate a
widespread pattern of abuse.
Subsequent investigations at

other universities have shown
that Stanford was not alone, and
there is also a growing belief that,
at some point, the University's
indirect-cost rate will be increased
back to a level close to the approx
imate actual expenses.
What appear to be the
most obvious mis
takes made in the
controversy were the
first ones. Few expected the con
troversy to snowball into what it
became.
When allegations of indirect
cost overcharges first surfaced in
September 1990, Kennedy was
quick to dismiss them.

He told the Faculty Senate
that the local headlines alleging
Stanford had overcharged the
government $300 million were
"imaginative," laughing that they
were "enough to send trustees off
to their cardiologists."
"I do not expect a discovery of
any wrongdoing on our part,"
Kennedy said at the time.
But, as most people involved in
the controversy generally
acknowledge, these hasty denials
ended up doing little to help Stan
ford's credibility when several of
the more glamorous allegations
were proven true.
"I think that early in the pro
cess we should have withheld all
judgments until we got a really

good external audit of the situa
tion," Kennedy said in a recent
interview. "I think there were
some early statements that in ret
rospect now reflect a little more
confidence than was justified at
the time."
Like a presidential candidate
whose denials of the past lead to
heightened scrutiny, Kennedy's
bold proclamations encouraged
the media — with the help of con
gressional subcommittee leaks —
to seek out the most egregious
past accounting mistakes.
"Once the press got off on a
feeding frenzy, there was no way
to get reason into the discussion,"
said Dean of Research Robert
Byer. "It was not unlike the polit
ical debate now."
The zenith of that frenzy was
probably the "investigative"
report by the ABC news program
"20/20," which focused on the
glamorous revelations and
ignored the long-term research
issues.
Time Senior Editor Paul Witte
man, who worked in the maga
zine's San Francisco bureau until
last year, said Kennedy "probably
misunderstood initially the level
to which the media were interest
ed in the story, but he quickly fig
ured it out."
There is little consensus about
whether the controversy could
have been minimized if Kennedy
had admitted at least a possibility
of wrongdoing at the outset.
"Given the circumstances we
were in — given the rather
unlikely accident of the arrival of
Paul Biddle [as on-campus Navy
regulator], given the rather
unlikely accident that there
would be a story in Science
about the so-called revolt of the
Stanford faculty over indirect
costs, given the interest of the
[House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations] — I
don't think that the result could
have been completely forestalled
or that it could have been made a

lot milder," Kennedy said.
But the controversial and out
spoken Biddle insists he would
not have been so aggressive if
Kennedy's response had been less
"challenging and arrogant."
"Stanford, by the manner in
which it reacted, could have been
like the Harvard Medical School
or MIT and not been so much of a
rallying point," Biddle said.
Yet despite his assertions to
the contrary, Biddle was a media
hound, always willing to offer his
opinion on a new revelation; he
has subsequently become a con
gressional candidate.
In light of these characteris
tics, it is likely that the University
might only have provoked more
attacks from Biddle if it had
admitted that the allegations
were at least partially true.
In the end, it was the presti
gious stature of Stanford that
grabbed the attention.
"If the [congressional] subcom
mittee had chosen to launch an
investigation of Wake Forest, it
wouldn't have made headlines.
But everyone's heard of Stan
ford," said Hoover senior research
fellow Charles Hill.
It was, in effect, an attempt by
Biddle and the congressional sub
commitee to disparage a highly
regarded institution, and Stan
ford took the brunt of the publici
ty-
While Kennedy probably could
not have stopped the controversy
once it began, many point to the
fact that indirect costs was an
issue that should have been
addressed years earlier.
Although indirect costs
did not emerge as a com
mon topic of conversa
tion for most on the
Stanford campus until 18 months
ago, many researchers had been
warning the administration about
the dramatic rise in the Universi
ty's rate for years.
"Faculty Senate people were
saying that the overhead was too
high," said Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy, senate chair in
1981-82. Kennedy should have
"listened more carefully, earlier."
In 1980, Stanford's indirect
cost rate was 58 percent. It rose to
74 percent by 1990, and the Uni
versity requested a rate of 78 per
cent for 1991.
"We were sticking out like a
sore thumb," said Education and
Sociology Prof. Elizabeth Cohen,
chair of this year's senate com
mittee on research. "Our worst
fears were confirmed, and the
administration should have lis
tened to the faculty warnings
about the indirect-cost rate."
Kennedy acknowledges he
should have acted sooner to con
trol the rising rate. "I think I was
not quick enough to recognize the
depth of faculty discontent about
the indirect-cost rate in a timely
fashion and do something more
hard-edged to restrain the rate,"
he said.
But Kennedy also insists that
Stanford was no different than
other universities in aggressively
seeking reimbursement for indi
rect costs.
"For the private research uni
versities that are the most active
players, [the indirect-cost rates]
form a fairly tightly clustered dis
tribution of which Stanford was
near but not quite at the top," he
said. "What I think is fair to say is
that we were in the spectrum of
institutions among the most
active in the pursuit of what we
considered our legitimate inter
ests."
The facts appear to bear
Kennedy out. Harvard Medical
School and MIT also had indirect

cost rates in the range of 70 to 80
percent, and, like Stanford, their
rates subsequently have been hit
hard by the Office of Naval
Research.
In fact, a congressional hearing
held last January found a "sys
temic" problem in the way univer
sities allegedly overbill the gov
ernment for indirect costs.
When looking at the other
prestigious universities investi
gated for indirect-cost over
charges, though, it is quickly
apparent that no other school
faced the same level of heightened
publicity. Perhaps because of its
country club image or simply
because of the presence of Paul
Biddle, Stanford was clearly sin
gled out for special scrutiny, and
Kennedy's reputation, rightly or
wrongly, has suffered for it.
ATfter the early allega
tions of huge over
charges, government
auditors began search
ing for examples of inappropriate
or unallowable costs.
The first revelation came in

December 1990, when govern
ment auditors discovered the Uni
versity had been charging the
depreciation of a yacht to indirect
costs.
The 65-foot yacht Victoria — a
donation that was not even locat
ed on campus — had been inad
vertently included in a cost pool,
and it came to symbolize the sup
posed extravagant abuses of the
University.
As it became clear that Stan
ford was the designated target,
Kennedy became the figure who
was attacked. Records of his offi
cial residence, Hoover House,
were carefully examined, and
costs related to flowers, bedsheets
and a wedding reception received
heavy publicity.
"Part of the Dingell subcom
mittee staff strategy and their
friends in the media was to make
it look as though some of these
expenditures in indirect-cost
pools were expenditures that
somehow sponsored a high
lifestyle on the part of the presi

University President Donald Kennedy, in the photo at left, testifies on Stanford's indi
rect-cost practices last March before the powerful Rep. John Dingell, above, and his
House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. "The record today does you
and the University no credit," Dingell told Kennedy at the end of a scathing address
during the hearing.
dent and his wife," Kennedy said.
"There were those unbelievably
tasteless cartoons in the San Jose
Mercury News.
"That is not fun for fairly sen
sitive people with children to look
at. It is also not fair," he added.
Kennedy was the person called
to defend Stanford before the
House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations and the
powerful John Dingell, a Michi
gan Democrat.
The subcommittee is well
known for grabbing headlines
through orchestrated attempts to
embarrass public figures and rev
elations of startling new allega
tions, and the Stanford hearing
succeeded in all respects.
"Don mishandled the Dingell
hearings, but almost anyone
would have," McManus said."The
hearing is designed to spotlight a
chosen villain. Nobody could come
out looking good."
Yet Kennedy says the impres
sion most people get from the
hearing is not from watching the
tape of his testimony but from
reading the press reports. "When
people look at the tape of the
hearing, they come away with a
very different impression," he
said.
Nevertheless, not everyone
watched the hearing. People's
impressions of Kennedy and
Stanford were formed through
the media, and little of the cover
age was designed to make the
University look good.
From the first days of the
controversy, the media
reported what was happen
ing leak by leak — and
almost all of the information was
coming from the government.
Many have suggested that the
problem was one of Stanford's
public relations and its dealings
with the media.
"I think the media learned that
when important institutions are
in trouble, people get interested in
it and it sells newspapers,"
Kennedy said. "And I think we
experienced some piling on."
But Kennedy admitted that "if
there hadn't been a problem,
there wouldn't have been media
attention."
Even if the media was accu
rately reporting what it knew, all
that was being covered was the
government's side of the story
through anonymous sources,
while the University did little to
answer back.
"You don't fight allegations
with counterpublicity," said
Robert Freelen, Stanford's vice
president for public affairs, in a
recent interview. "You fight alle
gations with facts.
"It doesn't serve you well to
make more allegations without
facts to back them up," Freelen
added. "The accuser always has
the advantage in this type of situ
ation."
Others also defend Stanford's
handling of the controversy, say
ing little can be done in that type
of situation.
Kennedy "handled indirect
costs as well as any president
could have," said Trustee Henry
Muller, managing editor of Time

magazine. "It's too easy in retro
spect to say what could have been
done."
But Bob Beyers, the former
long-time director of the Stanford
News Service, said the University
should have been more open in
dealing with the controversy.
"I cannot imagine a more
unfortunate series of decisions
than those taken after the initial
inquiry of Congressman Dingell
because they saw the inquiry as
something routine," Beyers said.
"The way they handled indirect
costs was the classic way not to
handle irVormation that should
go to the public."
Now, when it is perhaps too
late, the tide has turned in the
media. Where editorials once lam
basted Kennedy for extravagance,
they now praise the nation's uni
versity research system and urge
that the government protect it.
But the changing perspective is
no longer on the front pages, and
the impressions of Stanford's
indirect-cost practices have
already had their effect on both
its reputation and, more perma
nently, that of Kennedy.
As the days of spectacular
headlines wind down and
the controversy enters
its protracted legal stage,
many are now looking back on the
last 18 months and assessing the
damage — both financial and rep
utational.
There is no question that Stan
ford's short-term reputation has
suffered as a result of the endless
negative publicity. Countless sto
ries have already emphasized the
handful of glamorous accounting
mistakes and created an image of
a country club university that

sought to defraud the govern
ment.
"It was a collision of two cul
tures," McManus said. "Within
the University, Kennedy's hon
esty and Stanford's good faith are
taken for granted; if something

has gone wrong, we assume it was
a good faith error.
"Go up to Capital Hill, though,
and there are assumptions about
greed and duplicity," McManus
added.
"In the end, all of higher edu-

cation is being damaged," said for
mer Provost James Rosse, who
resigned in April to head Freedom
Newspapers, Inc. "The fact that
Stanford was prominent during
the process probably affects Stan
ford more than others.
"But I do not detect any partic
ular singling out of Stanford (out
side the University) as much as
one might think," Rosse added.
Dean of Research Byer said the
investigation of Stanford's indi
rect costs was merely one part of a
larger attack on higher education.
"The indirect-cost controversy
was just a symptom of the prob
lem. The government is saving
money by trying to skimp on
expenses and not pay the average
cost of research," Byer said. "This
is part of a discussion on
how this country will choose to
invest in its future.
"In the long run, it will not
hurt Stanford more than others,"
he added.
Two more objective ways to
measure the effects on the Uni
versity's reputation are fund rais
ing and admissions.
Last year was the final one in
Stanford's $1.1 billion Centennial
Campaign, and, despite the fact
that the ultimate total exceeded
expectations, there was still some
effect.
"We'll probably never know to
what extent the indirect-cost con
troversy hurt us," said Elizabeth
Sloan, director of communica
tions for the Office of Develop
ment.
"But most donors know that
that was inflated. We tried to do a
good job communicating our posi
tion on that issue."
The effect on admissions is also
difficult to gauge. The worst of
the coverage came in the first
three months of 1991 — just after
applications were due for the fol
lowing year's class.
While the hearing and the
drastic reduction in the Universi
ty's cost rate came just as
prospective freshmen were mak
ing their final selection, the effect
seemed minimal, as fewer stu

dents were accepted from the wait
list than in previous years.
"My gut feeling is that it had
some small effect, but I couldn't
support that with numbers," said
Jean Fetter, former director of
undergraduate admissions.

Ultimately, most believe that
Stanford is a strong enough insti
tution that such a controversy
will do no permanent damage.
"The mark it leaves on the
University will be quite transient.
People make very different judg
ments about things in the light of
subsequent events," Kennedy
said. "As time goes on and the
scandalous assertions fade and a
more measured view comes to be
part of conventional wisdom, I
think Stanford will be just fine."
But, many people say, the
effects on Kennedy's reputation
are not so easily dismissed.
Whenever Kennedy's
name appears in
print these days, it is
followed by a phrase
like, "who resigned last August
because of allegations of over
billing for research overhead."
He is seemingly inseparable
from the controversy, despite the
fact that as University president
he had little to do with indirect
costs.
In a letter to The New York
Times last November, Kennedy
warned of a "computer virus"
loose at the newspaper that auto
matically included mention of the
indirect-cost controversy with any
story mentioning either Kennedy
or Stanford, including an article
about a polygamous doctor at the
Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal.
"If you think Don Kennedy
knew anything about the intrica
cies of indirect costs at the outset
of the whole mess, you're crazy,"
said Emeritus Psychology Prof.
Albert Hastorf, Kennedy's first
provost. "He should have let oth
ers share responsibility for that
issue."
Cohen, chair of the senate com
mittee on research, agreed that
Kennedy knew little about the
problem, but said as boss he had
to be accountable.
"I don't blame Donald
Kennedy. I blame the administra
tive style," Cohen said. "But it
happened on his watch, and he

had to bear responsibility for it.
"That's why one might not
want to be a university presi
dent," she added.
Although he might not want to
admit it, friends of Kennedy say
he was deeply affected by the
repeated charges directed against
him.
"How much has it hurt him as
a person? It was a deep wound,
but a wound that I think has
healed," Rosse said.
"He has recovered from it, and
I think he is now a stronger per
son. But it was a serious person
al trauma."
Kennedy said he recognizes he
is tied to the controversy and
accepts it, saying that what he
thinks of himself is more impor
tant than what others say.
"There will be some people
who lost interest in this whole
business the day after the yacht
and flowers who may still associ
ate that with me. That is just
something I will have to live with,
and it doesn't bother me," he said.
"I don't have a problem with how
I see myself.
"I know I made some mistakes.
I know that I made some good
decisions. ... I don't have the
feeling about myself that there is
some tarnish there," Kennedy
added.
How people view Kennedy may
very well depend on how closely
they look. The cursory glance at
the most recent headlines will
connect him to the controversy,
but a thorough examination will
likely include indirect costs as
only one event in 12 years of var
ied accomplishments.
The financial legacy, however,
may not be so easy to overlook.
The abrupt reduction in
indirect-cost reimburse
ment has devastated the
University's finances,
costing as much as $30 million per
year.
Stanford is now completing a
painful $43 million budget-cut
ting process, and many academic
programs and administrative
staff support have been slashed.
The budget problems do not
end there.
The system of tuition remis
sion — a method of financing the
tuition of graduate students
involved in sponsored research

through indirect costs — is cur
rently being threatened, and
many believe it will end in the
next two years.
If researchers were forced to
charge graduate student tuition
on their direct research grant, it
is likely that fewer graduate stu-»
dents would be funded and up to
25 percent might be replaced with
cheaper post-doctoral students.
The reduced indirect-cost rate
has also "cost us one new science
building per year in the last two
years," said Byer. Until the Uni
versity and Navy negotiate a n r
rate, the same financial prouxems
will continue.
Of course, two years from now
the University's fiscal situation
could improve if it wins its legal
appeal of last year's abrupt rate
reduction by the Navy.
But Kennedy will not leave
Stanford with all of the indirect
cost issues unresolved.
Things such as a Defense Con
tract Audit Agency study claiming
that Stanford overcharged the gov
ernment by at least $310 million
during the 1980s have been dis
credited, as most observers agree
that the cost agreements signed
during the decade are valid, bind
ing contracts.
In additipn, one of the people
disciplined by the Navy for negoti
ating the allegedly "cozy" cost
accounting agreements with
Stanford has subsequently been
returned to his job.
An expensive overhaul of the
University's internal cost
accounting systems has begun,
and the six-month report card
indicates progress is being made.
Kennedy said he has, in fact,
decided to "leave the runway as
clear as it can possibly be" for
incoming University President
Gerhard Casper.
Perhaps that was the way
Kennedy eventually chose to han
dle this entire controversy.
Some important mistakes were
made early on, and, once the
unstoppable barrage of publicity
began, Kennedy accepted respon
sibility for the institution.
"If you are seen as the person
with oversight when a problem
occurs, it is difficult to set that
aside," said Freelen. "He could
have easily tried to point fingers
at other people, but it was most
honorable to take the blame."

Indirect Costs
Third in a
four-part series

News analysis
Yet, despite the painful financial
legacy, many higher education
experts say the University has come
through the controversy with little
permanent damage to its reputa
tion.
Stanford was merely the first —
and most publicized — target in
what has become a nationwide
campaign to reexamine the system
of indirect costs and the extent to
which the federal government
funds higher education.
But as Kennedy leaves office in
August, the damage to his reputa
tion will not be so easy to repair as
questions remain over how he
handled the controversy.
Although a president cannot be
expected to know of every individ
ual financial transaction, many
within the University say
Kennedy was warned of what was
coming and had ample opportuni
ty to prevent the worst of it.
But at the same time, it is easy
for critics to look back and say
something different should have
been done.
And even if Kennedy or others
had taken a different approach to
the controversy, it might not have
had a real effect on what eventu
ally transpired.
Stanford's indirect-cost rate
began to receive heightened
scrutiny in the fall of 1990
after on-campus Navy regu
lator Paul Biddle began loudly
accusing the Navy and the Uni
versity of having negotiated
"cozy" cost accounting agree
ments.
Indirect costs, as everyone on
campus has grown to learn, are
the expenses associated with
research that cannot be attribut
ed to any particular project, such
as utilities and building mainte
nance.
After the initial reports of
wrongdoing, government auditors
began searching through the
records for inappropriate expens
es to leak, and the University's
rate was knocked down from 74
percent to 70 percent during the
winter of last year as the media
played up every new allegation.
After what was widely thought
to be a disastrous hearing before
the House Subcommitee on Over
sight and Investigations on Stan
ford's indirect-cost practices, the

Navy unilaterally canceled almost
100 cost accounting agreements
and slashed the University's rate
to 55.5 percent in April 1991.
Biddle continued his stream of
accusations through the summer
and following fall, suggesting the
University had overcharged the
government more than $300 mil
lion during the 1980s. He also
filed a qui tarn suit seeking per
sonal reward for the alleged over
billing.
Since then, Biddle has left
Stanford, and the University has
argued that a few isolated mis
takes among three million trans
actions do not indicate a
widespread pattern of abuse.
Subsequent investigations at

other universities have shown
that Stanford was not alone, and
there is also a growing belief that,
at some point, the University's
indirect-cost rate will be increased
back to a level close to the approx
imate actual expenses.
What appear to be the
most obvious mis
takes made in the
controversy were the
first ones. Few expected the con
troversy to snowball into what it
became.
When allegations of indirect
cost overcharges first surfaced in
September 1990, Kennedy was
quick to dismiss them.

He told the Faculty Senate
that the local headlines alleging
Stanford had overcharged the
government $300 million were
"imaginative," laughing that they
were "enough to send trustees off
to their cardiologists."
"I do not expect a discovery of
any wrongdoing on our part,"
Kennedy said at the time.
But, as most people involved in
the controversy generally
acknowledge, these hasty denials
ended up doing little to help Stan
ford's credibility when several of
the more glamorous allegations
were proven true.
"I think that early in the pro
cess we should have withheld all
judgments until we got a really

good external audit of the situa
tion," Kennedy said in a recent
interview. "I think there were
some early statements that in ret
rospect now reflect a little more
confidence than was justified at
the time."
Like a presidential candidate
whose denials of the past lead to
heightened scrutiny, Kennedy's
bold proclamations encouraged
the media — with the help of con
gressional subcommittee leaks —
to seek out the most egregious
past accounting mistakes.
"Once the press got off on a
feeding frenzy, there was no way
to get reason into the discussion,"
said Dean of Research Robert
Byer. "It was not unlike the polit
ical debate now."
The zenith of that frenzy was
probably the "investigative"
report by the ABC news program
"20/20," which focused on the
glamorous revelations and
ignored the long-term research
issues.
Time Senior Editor Paul Witte
man, who worked in the maga
zine's San Francisco bureau until
last year, said Kennedy "probably
misunderstood initially the level
to which the media were interest
ed in the story, but he quickly fig
ured it out."
There is little consensus about
whether the controversy could
have been minimized if Kennedy
had admitted at least a possibility
of wrongdoing at the outset.
"Given the circumstances we
were in — given the rather
unlikely accident of the arrival of
Paul Biddle [as on-campus Navy
regulator], given the rather
unlikely accident that there
would be a story in Science
about the so-called revolt of the
Stanford faculty over indirect
costs, given the interest of the
[House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations] — I
don't think that the result could
have been completely forestalled
or that it could have been made a

lot milder," Kennedy said.
But the controversial and out
spoken Biddle insists he would
not have been so aggressive if
Kennedy's response had been less
"challenging and arrogant."
"Stanford, by the manner in
which it reacted, could have been
like the Harvard Medical School
or MIT and not been so much of a
rallying point," Biddle said.
Yet despite his assertions to
the contrary, Biddle was a media
hound, always willing to offer his
opinion on a new revelation; he
has subsequently become a con
gressional candidate.
In light of these characteris
tics, it is likely that the University
might only have provoked more
attacks from Biddle if it had
admitted that the allegations
were at least partially true.
In the end, it was the presti
gious stature of Stanford that
grabbed the attention.
"If the [congressional] subcom
mittee had chosen to launch an
investigation of Wake Forest, it
wouldn't have made headlines.
But everyone's heard of Stan
ford," said Hoover senior research
fellow Charles Hill.
It was, in effect, an attempt by
Biddle and the congressional sub
commitee to disparage a highly
regarded institution, and Stan
ford took the brunt of the publici
ty-
While Kennedy probably could
not have stopped the controversy
once it began, many point to the
fact that indirect costs was an
issue that should have been
addressed years earlier.
Although indirect costs
did not emerge as a com
mon topic of conversa
tion for most on the
Stanford campus until 18 months
ago, many researchers had been
warning the administration about
the dramatic rise in the Universi
ty's rate for years.
"Faculty Senate people were
saying that the overhead was too
high," said Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy, senate chair in
1981-82. Kennedy should have
"listened more carefully, earlier."
In 1980, Stanford's indirect
cost rate was 58 percent. It rose to
74 percent by 1990, and the Uni
versity requested a rate of 78 per
cent for 1991.
"We were sticking out like a
sore thumb," said Education and
Sociology Prof. Elizabeth Cohen,
chair of this year's senate com
mittee on research. "Our worst
fears were confirmed, and the
administration should have lis
tened to the faculty warnings
about the indirect-cost rate."
Kennedy acknowledges he
should have acted sooner to con
trol the rising rate. "I think I was
not quick enough to recognize the
depth of faculty discontent about
the indirect-cost rate in a timely
fashion and do something more
hard-edged to restrain the rate,"
he said.
But Kennedy also insists that
Stanford was no different than
other universities in aggressively
seeking reimbursement for indi
rect costs.
"For the private research uni
versities that are the most active
players, [the indirect-cost rates]
form a fairly tightly clustered dis
tribution of which Stanford was
near but not quite at the top," he
said. "What I think is fair to say is
that we were in the spectrum of
institutions among the most
active in the pursuit of what we
considered our legitimate inter
ests."
The facts appear to bear
Kennedy out. Harvard Medical
School and MIT also had indirect

cost rates in the range of 70 to 80
percent, and, like Stanford, their
rates subsequently have been hit
hard by the Office of Naval
Research.
In fact, a congressional hearing
held last January found a "sys
temic" problem in the way univer
sities allegedly overbill the gov
ernment for indirect costs.
When looking at the other
prestigious universities investi
gated for indirect-cost over
charges, though, it is quickly
apparent that no other school
faced the same level of heightened
publicity. Perhaps because of its
country club image or simply
because of the presence of Paul
Biddle, Stanford was clearly sin
gled out for special scrutiny, and
Kennedy's reputation, rightly or
wrongly, has suffered for it.
ATfter the early allega
tions of huge over
charges, government
auditors began search
ing for examples of inappropriate
or unallowable costs.
The first revelation came in

December 1990, when govern
ment auditors discovered the Uni
versity had been charging the
depreciation of a yacht to indirect
costs.
The 65-foot yacht Victoria — a
donation that was not even locat
ed on campus — had been inad
vertently included in a cost pool,
and it came to symbolize the sup
posed extravagant abuses of the
University.
As it became clear that Stan
ford was the designated target,
Kennedy became the figure who
was attacked. Records of his offi
cial residence, Hoover House,
were carefully examined, and
costs related to flowers, bedsheets
and a wedding reception received
heavy publicity.
"Part of the Dingell subcom
mittee staff strategy and their
friends in the media was to make
it look as though some of these
expenditures in indirect-cost
pools were expenditures that
somehow sponsored a high
lifestyle on the part of the presi

University President Donald Kennedy, in the photo at left, testifies on Stanford's indi
rect-cost practices last March before the powerful Rep. John Dingell, above, and his
House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. "The record today does you
and the University no credit," Dingell told Kennedy at the end of a scathing address
during the hearing.
dent and his wife," Kennedy said.
"There were those unbelievably
tasteless cartoons in the San Jose
Mercury News.
"That is not fun for fairly sen
sitive people with children to look
at. It is also not fair," he added.
Kennedy was the person called
to defend Stanford before the
House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations and the
powerful John Dingell, a Michi
gan Democrat.
The subcommittee is well
known for grabbing headlines
through orchestrated attempts to
embarrass public figures and rev
elations of startling new allega
tions, and the Stanford hearing
succeeded in all respects.
"Don mishandled the Dingell
hearings, but almost anyone
would have," McManus said."The
hearing is designed to spotlight a
chosen villain. Nobody could come
out looking good."
Yet Kennedy says the impres
sion most people get from the
hearing is not from watching the
tape of his testimony but from
reading the press reports. "When
people look at the tape of the
hearing, they come away with a
very different impression," he
said.
Nevertheless, not everyone
watched the hearing. People's
impressions of Kennedy and
Stanford were formed through
the media, and little of the cover
age was designed to make the
University look good.
From the first days of the
controversy, the media
reported what was happen
ing leak by leak — and
almost all of the information was
coming from the government.
Many have suggested that the
problem was one of Stanford's
public relations and its dealings
with the media.
"I think the media learned that
when important institutions are
in trouble, people get interested in
it and it sells newspapers,"
Kennedy said. "And I think we
experienced some piling on."
But Kennedy admitted that "if
there hadn't been a problem,
there wouldn't have been media
attention."
Even if the media was accu
rately reporting what it knew, all
that was being covered was the
government's side of the story
through anonymous sources,
while the University did little to
answer back.
"You don't fight allegations
with counterpublicity," said
Robert Freelen, Stanford's vice
president for public affairs, in a
recent interview. "You fight alle
gations with facts.
"It doesn't serve you well to
make more allegations without
facts to back them up," Freelen
added. "The accuser always has
the advantage in this type of situ
ation."
Others also defend Stanford's
handling of the controversy, say
ing little can be done in that type
of situation.
Kennedy "handled indirect
costs as well as any president
could have," said Trustee Henry
Muller, managing editor of Time

magazine. "It's too easy in retro
spect to say what could have been
done."
But Bob Beyers, the former
long-time director of the Stanford
News Service, said the University
should have been more open in
dealing with the controversy.
"I cannot imagine a more
unfortunate series of decisions
than those taken after the initial
inquiry of Congressman Dingell
because they saw the inquiry as
something routine," Beyers said.
"The way they handled indirect
costs was the classic way not to
handle irVormation that should
go to the public."
Now, when it is perhaps too
late, the tide has turned in the
media. Where editorials once lam
basted Kennedy for extravagance,
they now praise the nation's uni
versity research system and urge
that the government protect it.
But the changing perspective is
no longer on the front pages, and
the impressions of Stanford's
indirect-cost practices have
already had their effect on both
its reputation and, more perma
nently, that of Kennedy.
As the days of spectacular
headlines wind down and
the controversy enters
its protracted legal stage,
many are now looking back on the
last 18 months and assessing the
damage — both financial and rep
utational.
There is no question that Stan
ford's short-term reputation has
suffered as a result of the endless
negative publicity. Countless sto
ries have already emphasized the
handful of glamorous accounting
mistakes and created an image of
a country club university that

sought to defraud the govern
ment.
"It was a collision of two cul
tures," McManus said. "Within
the University, Kennedy's hon
esty and Stanford's good faith are
taken for granted; if something

has gone wrong, we assume it was
a good faith error.
"Go up to Capital Hill, though,
and there are assumptions about
greed and duplicity," McManus
added.
"In the end, all of higher edu-

cation is being damaged," said for
mer Provost James Rosse, who
resigned in April to head Freedom
Newspapers, Inc. "The fact that
Stanford was prominent during
the process probably affects Stan
ford more than others.
"But I do not detect any partic
ular singling out of Stanford (out
side the University) as much as
one might think," Rosse added.
Dean of Research Byer said the
investigation of Stanford's indi
rect costs was merely one part of a
larger attack on higher education.
"The indirect-cost controversy
was just a symptom of the prob
lem. The government is saving
money by trying to skimp on
expenses and not pay the average
cost of research," Byer said. "This
is part of a discussion on
how this country will choose to
invest in its future.
"In the long run, it will not
hurt Stanford more than others,"
he added.
Two more objective ways to
measure the effects on the Uni
versity's reputation are fund rais
ing and admissions.
Last year was the final one in
Stanford's $1.1 billion Centennial
Campaign, and, despite the fact
that the ultimate total exceeded
expectations, there was still some
effect.
"We'll probably never know to
what extent the indirect-cost con
troversy hurt us," said Elizabeth
Sloan, director of communica
tions for the Office of Develop
ment.
"But most donors know that
that was inflated. We tried to do a
good job communicating our posi
tion on that issue."
The effect on admissions is also
difficult to gauge. The worst of
the coverage came in the first
three months of 1991 — just after
applications were due for the fol
lowing year's class.
While the hearing and the
drastic reduction in the Universi
ty's cost rate came just as
prospective freshmen were mak
ing their final selection, the effect
seemed minimal, as fewer stu

dents were accepted from the wait
list than in previous years.
"My gut feeling is that it had
some small effect, but I couldn't
support that with numbers," said
Jean Fetter, former director of
undergraduate admissions.

Ultimately, most believe that
Stanford is a strong enough insti
tution that such a controversy
will do no permanent damage.
"The mark it leaves on the
University will be quite transient.
People make very different judg
ments about things in the light of
subsequent events," Kennedy
said. "As time goes on and the
scandalous assertions fade and a
more measured view comes to be
part of conventional wisdom, I
think Stanford will be just fine."
But, many people say, the
effects on Kennedy's reputation
are not so easily dismissed.
Whenever Kennedy's
name appears in
print these days, it is
followed by a phrase
like, "who resigned last August
because of allegations of over
billing for research overhead."
He is seemingly inseparable
from the controversy, despite the
fact that as University president
he had little to do with indirect
costs.
In a letter to The New York
Times last November, Kennedy
warned of a "computer virus"
loose at the newspaper that auto
matically included mention of the
indirect-cost controversy with any
story mentioning either Kennedy
or Stanford, including an article
about a polygamous doctor at the
Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal.
"If you think Don Kennedy
knew anything about the intrica
cies of indirect costs at the outset
of the whole mess, you're crazy,"
said Emeritus Psychology Prof.
Albert Hastorf, Kennedy's first
provost. "He should have let oth
ers share responsibility for that
issue."
Cohen, chair of the senate com
mittee on research, agreed that
Kennedy knew little about the
problem, but said as boss he had
to be accountable.
"I don't blame Donald
Kennedy. I blame the administra
tive style," Cohen said. "But it
happened on his watch, and he

had to bear responsibility for it.
"That's why one might not
want to be a university presi
dent," she added.
Although he might not want to
admit it, friends of Kennedy say
he was deeply affected by the
repeated charges directed against
him.
"How much has it hurt him as
a person? It was a deep wound,
but a wound that I think has
healed," Rosse said.
"He has recovered from it, and
I think he is now a stronger per
son. But it was a serious person
al trauma."
Kennedy said he recognizes he
is tied to the controversy and
accepts it, saying that what he
thinks of himself is more impor
tant than what others say.
"There will be some people
who lost interest in this whole
business the day after the yacht
and flowers who may still associ
ate that with me. That is just
something I will have to live with,
and it doesn't bother me," he said.
"I don't have a problem with how
I see myself.
"I know I made some mistakes.
I know that I made some good
decisions. ... I don't have the
feeling about myself that there is
some tarnish there," Kennedy
added.
How people view Kennedy may
very well depend on how closely
they look. The cursory glance at
the most recent headlines will
connect him to the controversy,
but a thorough examination will
likely include indirect costs as
only one event in 12 years of var
ied accomplishments.
The financial legacy, however,
may not be so easy to overlook.
The abrupt reduction in
indirect-cost reimburse
ment has devastated the
University's finances,
costing as much as $30 million per
year.
Stanford is now completing a
painful $43 million budget-cut
ting process, and many academic
programs and administrative
staff support have been slashed.
The budget problems do not
end there.
The system of tuition remis
sion — a method of financing the
tuition of graduate students
involved in sponsored research

through indirect costs — is cur
rently being threatened, and
many believe it will end in the
next two years.
If researchers were forced to
charge graduate student tuition
on their direct research grant, it
is likely that fewer graduate stu-»
dents would be funded and up to
25 percent might be replaced with
cheaper post-doctoral students.
The reduced indirect-cost rate
has also "cost us one new science
building per year in the last two
years," said Byer. Until the Uni
versity and Navy negotiate a n r
rate, the same financial prouxems
will continue.
Of course, two years from now
the University's fiscal situation
could improve if it wins its legal
appeal of last year's abrupt rate
reduction by the Navy.
But Kennedy will not leave
Stanford with all of the indirect
cost issues unresolved.
Things such as a Defense Con
tract Audit Agency study claiming
that Stanford overcharged the gov
ernment by at least $310 million
during the 1980s have been dis
credited, as most observers agree
that the cost agreements signed
during the decade are valid, bind
ing contracts.
In additipn, one of the people
disciplined by the Navy for negoti
ating the allegedly "cozy" cost
accounting agreements with
Stanford has subsequently been
returned to his job.
An expensive overhaul of the
University's internal cost
accounting systems has begun,
and the six-month report card
indicates progress is being made.
Kennedy said he has, in fact,
decided to "leave the runway as
clear as it can possibly be" for
incoming University President
Gerhard Casper.
Perhaps that was the way
Kennedy eventually chose to han
dle this entire controversy.
Some important mistakes were
made early on, and, once the
unstoppable barrage of publicity
began, Kennedy accepted respon
sibility for the institution.
"If you are seen as the person
with oversight when a problem
occurs, it is difficult to set that
aside," said Freelen. "He could
have easily tried to point fingers
at other people, but it was most
honorable to take the blame."

Kennedy, with Board of Trustees President James Gaither at his side, speaks to reporters about his
resignation as Stanford president last July.
To attack an institution, congression
al subcommittees have learned, one
must find an individual to serve as
the target.
Stanford's point man — and the person
who came to be most closely tied to the indi
rect-cost controversy — was University
President Donald Kennedy.
Through the crisis, Kennedy was por
trayed as a president who failed to keep
watch over his accountants, allowing federal
research funds to be spent on furnishings
and flowers for his home and upkeep of a
University yacht.
"It is a natural reflex to personalize
things and simplify complex issues," said
Doyle McManus, a reporter in the Los Ange
les Times Washington bureau and a member
of Stanford's Board of Trustees. U.S. Rep.
John Dingell "promoted stories that Donald

Kennedy was buying sheets and that gets
more circulation," McManus said. "It fits
more easily into the paradigm of journalistic
scandal."
As the harshest criticism focused upon
him, Kennedy took on the role of embattled
defender of the University, eventually
accepting responsibility for what occurred
and submitting his resignation.
For the past 18 months, indirect costs, a

standard but relatively unknown method of
financing research at universities nation
wide, has been transformed into a buzzword
for the accounting errors that permitted
such extravagance.
Through the intense publicity, people
previously unfamiliar with the intricacies of
federally sponsored research have learned a
great deal as they watched the indirect-cost
rate plummet and the University's budget
deficit grow larger and larger.
But while some took the time to under
stand the details — and separate the facts
from the exaggerated half-truths — of what
has become known as the indirect-cost con
troversy, others did not.
For many, the headlines warning that
Stanford had overcharged the government
hundreds of millions of dollars told the story.
As flashy revelations dominated the cover
age, the public image of Stanford suffered.

Years
Indirect Costs
Third in a
four-part series

News analysis
Yet, despite the painful financial
legacy, many higher education
experts say the University has come
through the controversy with little
permanent damage to its reputa
tion.
Stanford was merely the first —
and most publicized — target in
what has become a nationwide
campaign to reexamine the system
of indirect costs and the extent to
which the federal government
funds higher education.
But as Kennedy leaves office in
August, the damage to his reputa
tion will not be so easy to repair as
questions remain over how he
handled the controversy.
Although a president cannot be
expected to know of every individ
ual financial transaction, many
within the University say
Kennedy was warned of what was
coming and had ample opportuni
ty to prevent the worst of it.
But at the same time, it is easy
for critics to look back and say
something different should have
been done.
And even if Kennedy or others
had taken a different approach to
the controversy, it might not have
had a real effect on what eventu
ally transpired.
Stanford's indirect-cost rate
began to receive heightened
scrutiny in the fall of 1990
after on-campus Navy regu
lator Paul Biddle began loudly
accusing the Navy and the Uni
versity of having negotiated
"cozy" cost accounting agree
ments.
Indirect costs, as everyone on
campus has grown to learn, are
the expenses associated with
research that cannot be attribut
ed to any particular project, such
as utilities and building mainte
nance.
After the initial reports of
wrongdoing, government auditors
began searching through the
records for inappropriate expens
es to leak, and the University's
rate was knocked down from 74
percent to 70 percent during the
winter of last year as the media
played up every new allegation.
After what was widely thought
to be a disastrous hearing before
the House Subcommitee on Over
sight and Investigations on Stan
ford's indirect-cost practices, the

Navy unilaterally canceled almost
100 cost accounting agreements
and slashed the University's rate
to 55.5 percent in April 1991.
Biddle continued his stream of
accusations through the summer
and following fall, suggesting the
University had overcharged the
government more than $300 mil
lion during the 1980s. He also
filed a qui tarn suit seeking per
sonal reward for the alleged over
billing.
Since then, Biddle has left
Stanford, and the University has
argued that a few isolated mis
takes among three million trans
actions do not indicate a
widespread pattern of abuse.
Subsequent investigations at

other universities have shown
that Stanford was not alone, and
there is also a growing belief that,
at some point, the University's
indirect-cost rate will be increased
back to a level close to the approx
imate actual expenses.
What appear to be the
most obvious mis
takes made in the
controversy were the
first ones. Few expected the con
troversy to snowball into what it
became.
When allegations of indirect
cost overcharges first surfaced in
September 1990, Kennedy was
quick to dismiss them.

He told the Faculty Senate
that the local headlines alleging
Stanford had overcharged the
government $300 million were
"imaginative," laughing that they
were "enough to send trustees off
to their cardiologists."
"I do not expect a discovery of
any wrongdoing on our part,"
Kennedy said at the time.
But, as most people involved in
the controversy generally
acknowledge, these hasty denials
ended up doing little to help Stan
ford's credibility when several of
the more glamorous allegations
were proven true.
"I think that early in the pro
cess we should have withheld all
judgments until we got a really

good external audit of the situa
tion," Kennedy said in a recent
interview. "I think there were
some early statements that in ret
rospect now reflect a little more
confidence than was justified at
the time."
Like a presidential candidate
whose denials of the past lead to
heightened scrutiny, Kennedy's
bold proclamations encouraged
the media — with the help of con
gressional subcommittee leaks —
to seek out the most egregious
past accounting mistakes.
"Once the press got off on a
feeding frenzy, there was no way
to get reason into the discussion,"
said Dean of Research Robert
Byer. "It was not unlike the polit
ical debate now."
The zenith of that frenzy was
probably the "investigative"
report by the ABC news program
"20/20," which focused on the
glamorous revelations and
ignored the long-term research
issues.
Time Senior Editor Paul Witte
man, who worked in the maga
zine's San Francisco bureau until
last year, said Kennedy "probably
misunderstood initially the level
to which the media were interest
ed in the story, but he quickly fig
ured it out."
There is little consensus about
whether the controversy could
have been minimized if Kennedy
had admitted at least a possibility
of wrongdoing at the outset.
"Given the circumstances we
were in — given the rather
unlikely accident of the arrival of
Paul Biddle [as on-campus Navy
regulator], given the rather
unlikely accident that there
would be a story in Science
about the so-called revolt of the
Stanford faculty over indirect
costs, given the interest of the
[House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations] — I
don't think that the result could
have been completely forestalled
or that it could have been made a

lot milder," Kennedy said.
But the controversial and out
spoken Biddle insists he would
not have been so aggressive if
Kennedy's response had been less
"challenging and arrogant."
"Stanford, by the manner in
which it reacted, could have been
like the Harvard Medical School
or MIT and not been so much of a
rallying point," Biddle said.
Yet despite his assertions to
the contrary, Biddle was a media
hound, always willing to offer his
opinion on a new revelation; he
has subsequently become a con
gressional candidate.
In light of these characteris
tics, it is likely that the University
might only have provoked more
attacks from Biddle if it had
admitted that the allegations
were at least partially true.
In the end, it was the presti
gious stature of Stanford that
grabbed the attention.
"If the [congressional] subcom
mittee had chosen to launch an
investigation of Wake Forest, it
wouldn't have made headlines.
But everyone's heard of Stan
ford," said Hoover senior research
fellow Charles Hill.
It was, in effect, an attempt by
Biddle and the congressional sub
commitee to disparage a highly
regarded institution, and Stan
ford took the brunt of the publici
ty-
While Kennedy probably could
not have stopped the controversy
once it began, many point to the
fact that indirect costs was an
issue that should have been
addressed years earlier.
Although indirect costs
did not emerge as a com
mon topic of conversa
tion for most on the
Stanford campus until 18 months
ago, many researchers had been
warning the administration about
the dramatic rise in the Universi
ty's rate for years.
"Faculty Senate people were
saying that the overhead was too
high," said Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy, senate chair in
1981-82. Kennedy should have
"listened more carefully, earlier."
In 1980, Stanford's indirect
cost rate was 58 percent. It rose to
74 percent by 1990, and the Uni
versity requested a rate of 78 per
cent for 1991.
"We were sticking out like a
sore thumb," said Education and
Sociology Prof. Elizabeth Cohen,
chair of this year's senate com
mittee on research. "Our worst
fears were confirmed, and the
administration should have lis
tened to the faculty warnings
about the indirect-cost rate."
Kennedy acknowledges he
should have acted sooner to con
trol the rising rate. "I think I was
not quick enough to recognize the
depth of faculty discontent about
the indirect-cost rate in a timely
fashion and do something more
hard-edged to restrain the rate,"
he said.
But Kennedy also insists that
Stanford was no different than
other universities in aggressively
seeking reimbursement for indi
rect costs.
"For the private research uni
versities that are the most active
players, [the indirect-cost rates]
form a fairly tightly clustered dis
tribution of which Stanford was
near but not quite at the top," he
said. "What I think is fair to say is
that we were in the spectrum of
institutions among the most
active in the pursuit of what we
considered our legitimate inter
ests."
The facts appear to bear
Kennedy out. Harvard Medical
School and MIT also had indirect

cost rates in the range of 70 to 80
percent, and, like Stanford, their
rates subsequently have been hit
hard by the Office of Naval
Research.
In fact, a congressional hearing
held last January found a "sys
temic" problem in the way univer
sities allegedly overbill the gov
ernment for indirect costs.
When looking at the other
prestigious universities investi
gated for indirect-cost over
charges, though, it is quickly
apparent that no other school
faced the same level of heightened
publicity. Perhaps because of its
country club image or simply
because of the presence of Paul
Biddle, Stanford was clearly sin
gled out for special scrutiny, and
Kennedy's reputation, rightly or
wrongly, has suffered for it.
ATfter the early allega
tions of huge over
charges, government
auditors began search
ing for examples of inappropriate
or unallowable costs.
The first revelation came in

December 1990, when govern
ment auditors discovered the Uni
versity had been charging the
depreciation of a yacht to indirect
costs.
The 65-foot yacht Victoria — a
donation that was not even locat
ed on campus — had been inad
vertently included in a cost pool,
and it came to symbolize the sup
posed extravagant abuses of the
University.
As it became clear that Stan
ford was the designated target,
Kennedy became the figure who
was attacked. Records of his offi
cial residence, Hoover House,
were carefully examined, and
costs related to flowers, bedsheets
and a wedding reception received
heavy publicity.
"Part of the Dingell subcom
mittee staff strategy and their
friends in the media was to make
it look as though some of these
expenditures in indirect-cost
pools were expenditures that
somehow sponsored a high
lifestyle on the part of the presi

House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. "The record today does you

during the hearing.
dent and his wife," Kennedy said.
"There were those unbelievably
tasteless cartoons in the San Jose
Mercury News.
"That is not fun for fairly sen
sitive people with children to look
at. It is also not fair," he added.
Kennedy was the person called
to defend Stanford before the
House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations and the
powerful John Dingell, a Michi
gan Democrat.
The subcommittee is well
known for grabbing headlines
through orchestrated attempts to
embarrass public figures and rev
elations of startling new allega
tions, and the Stanford hearing
succeeded in all respects.
"Don mishandled the Dingell
hearings, but almost anyone
would have," McManus said."The
hearing is designed to spotlight a
chosen villain. Nobody could come
out looking good."
Yet Kennedy says the impres
sion most people get from the
hearing is not from watching the
tape of his testimony but from
reading the press reports. "When
people look at the tape of the
hearing, they come away with a
very different impression," he
said.
Nevertheless, not everyone
watched the hearing. People's
impressions of Kennedy and
Stanford were formed through
the media, and little of the cover
age was designed to make the
University look good.
From the first days of the
controversy, the media
reported what was happen
ing leak by leak — and
almost all of the information was
coming from the government.
Many have suggested that the
problem was one of Stanford's
public relations and its dealings
with the media.
"I think the media learned that
when important institutions are
in trouble, people get interested in
it and it sells newspapers,"
Kennedy said. "And I think we
experienced some piling on."
But Kennedy admitted that "if
there hadn't been a problem,
there wouldn't have been media
attention."
Even if the media was accu
rately reporting what it knew, all
that was being covered was the
government's side of the story
through anonymous sources,
while the University did little to
answer back.
"You don't fight allegations
with counterpublicity," said
Robert Freelen, Stanford's vice
president for public affairs, in a
recent interview. "You fight alle
gations with facts.
"It doesn't serve you well to
make more allegations without
facts to back them up," Freelen
added. "The accuser always has
the advantage in this type of situ
ation."
Others also defend Stanford's
handling of the controversy, say
ing little can be done in that type
of situation.
Kennedy "handled indirect
costs as well as any president
could have," said Trustee Henry
Muller, managing editor of Time

magazine. "It's too easy in retro
spect to say what could have been
done."
But Bob Beyers, the former
long-time director of the Stanford
News Service, said the University
should have been more open in
dealing with the controversy.
"I cannot imagine a more
unfortunate series of decisions
than those taken after the initial
inquiry of Congressman Dingell
because they saw the inquiry as
something routine," Beyers said.
"The way they handled indirect
costs was the classic way not to
handle irVormation that should
go to the public."
Now, when it is perhaps too
late, the tide has turned in the
media. Where editorials once lam
basted Kennedy for extravagance,
they now praise the nation's uni
versity research system and urge
that the government protect it.
But the changing perspective is
no longer on the front pages, and
the impressions of Stanford's
indirect-cost practices have
already had their effect on both
its reputation and, more perma
nently, that of Kennedy.
As the days of spectacular
headlines wind down and
the controversy enters
its protracted legal stage,
many are now looking back on the
last 18 months and assessing the
damage — both financial and rep
utational.
There is no question that Stan
ford's short-term reputation has
suffered as a result of the endless
negative publicity. Countless sto
ries have already emphasized the
handful of glamorous accounting
mistakes and created an image of
a country club university that

sought to defraud the govern
ment.
"It was a collision of two cul
tures," McManus said. "Within
the University, Kennedy's hon
esty and Stanford's good faith are
taken for granted; if something

has gone wrong, we assume it was
a good faith error.
"Go up to Capital Hill, though,
and there are assumptions about
greed and duplicity," McManus
added.
"In the end, all of higher edu-

cation is being damaged," said for
mer Provost James Rosse, who
resigned in April to head Freedom
Newspapers, Inc. "The fact that
Stanford was prominent during
the process probably affects Stan
ford more than others.
"But I do not detect any partic
ular singling out of Stanford (out
side the University) as much as
one might think," Rosse added.
Dean of Research Byer said the
investigation of Stanford's indi
rect costs was merely one part of a
larger attack on higher education.
"The indirect-cost controversy
was just a symptom of the prob
lem. The government is saving
money by trying to skimp on
expenses and not pay the average
cost of research," Byer said. "This
is part of a discussion on
how this country will choose to
invest in its future.
"In the long run, it will not
hurt Stanford more than others,"
he added.
Two more objective ways to
measure the effects on the Uni
versity's reputation are fund rais
ing and admissions.
Last year was the final one in
Stanford's $1.1 billion Centennial
Campaign, and, despite the fact
that the ultimate total exceeded
expectations, there was still some
effect.
"We'll probably never know to
what extent the indirect-cost con
troversy hurt us," said Elizabeth
Sloan, director of communica
tions for the Office of Develop
ment.
"But most donors know that
that was inflated. We tried to do a
good job communicating our posi
tion on that issue."
The effect on admissions is also
difficult to gauge. The worst of
the coverage came in the first
three months of 1991 — just after
applications were due for the fol
lowing year's class.
While the hearing and the
drastic reduction in the Universi
ty's cost rate came just as
prospective freshmen were mak
ing their final selection, the effect
seemed minimal, as fewer stu

dents were accepted from the wait
list than in previous years.
"My gut feeling is that it had
some small effect, but I couldn't
support that with numbers," said
Jean Fetter, former director of
undergraduate admissions.

Ultimately, most believe that
Stanford is a strong enough insti
tution that such a controversy
will do no permanent damage.
"The mark it leaves on the
University will be quite transient.
People make very different judg
ments about things in the light of
subsequent events," Kennedy
said. "As time goes on and the
scandalous assertions fade and a
more measured view comes to be
part of conventional wisdom, I
think Stanford will be just fine."
But, many people say, the
effects on Kennedy's reputation
are not so easily dismissed.
Whenever Kennedy's
name appears in
print these days, it is
followed by a phrase
like, "who resigned last August
because of allegations of over
billing for research overhead."
He is seemingly inseparable
from the controversy, despite the
fact that as University president
he had little to do with indirect
costs.
In a letter to The New York
Times last November, Kennedy
warned of a "computer virus"
loose at the newspaper that auto
matically included mention of the
indirect-cost controversy with any
story mentioning either Kennedy
or Stanford, including an article
about a polygamous doctor at the
Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal.
"If you think Don Kennedy
knew anything about the intrica
cies of indirect costs at the outset
of the whole mess, you're crazy,"
said Emeritus Psychology Prof.
Albert Hastorf, Kennedy's first
provost. "He should have let oth
ers share responsibility for that
issue."
Cohen, chair of the senate com
mittee on research, agreed that
Kennedy knew little about the
problem, but said as boss he had
to be accountable.
"I don't blame Donald
Kennedy. I blame the administra
tive style," Cohen said. "But it
happened on his watch, and he

had to bear responsibility for it.
"That's why one might not
want to be a university presi
dent," she added.
Although he might not want to
admit it, friends of Kennedy say
he was deeply affected by the
repeated charges directed against
him.
"How much has it hurt him as
a person? It was a deep wound,
but a wound that I think has
healed," Rosse said.
"He has recovered from it, and
I think he is now a stronger per
son. But it was a serious person
al trauma."
Kennedy said he recognizes he
is tied to the controversy and
accepts it, saying that what he
thinks of himself is more impor
tant than what others say.
"There will be some people
who lost interest in this whole
business the day after the yacht
and flowers who may still associ
ate that with me. That is just
something I will have to live with,
and it doesn't bother me," he said.
"I don't have a problem with how
I see myself.
"I know I made some mistakes.
I know that I made some good
decisions. ... I don't have the
feeling about myself that there is
some tarnish there," Kennedy
added.
How people view Kennedy may
very well depend on how closely
they look. The cursory glance at
the most recent headlines will
connect him to the controversy,
but a thorough examination will
likely include indirect costs as
only one event in 12 years of var
ied accomplishments.
The financial legacy, however,
may not be so easy to overlook.
The abrupt reduction in
indirect-cost reimburse
ment has devastated the
University's finances,
costing as much as $30 million per
year.
Stanford is now completing a
painful $43 million budget-cut
ting process, and many academic
programs and administrative
staff support have been slashed.
The budget problems do not
end there.
The system of tuition remis
sion — a method of financing the
tuition of graduate students
involved in sponsored research

through indirect costs — is cur
rently being threatened, and
many believe it will end in the
next two years.
If researchers were forced to
charge graduate student tuition
on their direct research grant, it
is likely that fewer graduate stu-»
dents would be funded and up to
25 percent might be replaced with
cheaper post-doctoral students.
The reduced indirect-cost rate
has also "cost us one new science
building per year in the last two
years," said Byer. Until the Uni
versity and Navy negotiate a n r
rate, the same financial prouxems
will continue.
Of course, two years from now
the University's fiscal situation
could improve if it wins its legal
appeal of last year's abrupt rate
reduction by the Navy.
But Kennedy will not leave
Stanford with all of the indirect
cost issues unresolved.
Things such as a Defense Con
tract Audit Agency study claiming
that Stanford overcharged the gov
ernment by at least $310 million
during the 1980s have been dis
credited, as most observers agree
that the cost agreements signed
during the decade are valid, bind
ing contracts.
In additipn, one of the people
disciplined by the Navy for negoti
ating the allegedly "cozy" cost
accounting agreements with
Stanford has subsequently been
returned to his job.
An expensive overhaul of the
University's internal cost
accounting systems has begun,
and the six-month report card
indicates progress is being made.
Kennedy said he has, in fact,
decided to "leave the runway as
clear as it can possibly be" for
incoming University President
Gerhard Casper.
Perhaps that was the way
Kennedy eventually chose to han
dle this entire controversy.
Some important mistakes were
made early on, and, once the
unstoppable barrage of publicity
began, Kennedy accepted respon
sibility for the institution.
"If you are seen as the person
with oversight when a problem
occurs, it is difficult to set that
aside," said Freelen. "He could
have easily tried to point fingers
at other people, but it was most
honorable to take the blame."

Kennedy, with Board of Trustees President James Gaither at his side, speaks to reporters about his
resignation as Stanford president last July.
To attack an institution, congression
al subcommittees have learned, one
must find an individual to serve as
the target.
Stanford's point man — and the person
who came to be most closely tied to the indi
rect-cost controversy — was University
President Donald Kennedy.
Through the crisis, Kennedy was por
trayed as a president who failed to keep
watch over his accountants, allowing federal
research funds to be spent on furnishings
and flowers for his home and upkeep of a
University yacht.
"It is a natural reflex to personalize
things and simplify complex issues," said
Doyle McManus, a reporter in the Los Ange
les Times Washington bureau and a member
of Stanford's Board of Trustees. U.S. Rep.
John Dingell "promoted stories that Donald

Kennedy was buying sheets and that gets
more circulation," McManus said. "It fits
more easily into the paradigm of journalistic
scandal."
As the harshest criticism focused upon
him, Kennedy took on the role of embattled
defender of the University, eventually
accepting responsibility for what occurred
and submitting his resignation.
For the past 18 months, indirect costs, a

standard but relatively unknown method of
financing research at universities nation
wide, has been transformed into a buzzword
for the accounting errors that permitted
such extravagance.
Through the intense publicity, people
previously unfamiliar with the intricacies of
federally sponsored research have learned a
great deal as they watched the indirect-cost
rate plummet and the University's budget
deficit grow larger and larger.
But while some took the time to under
stand the details — and separate the facts
from the exaggerated half-truths — of what
has become known as the indirect-cost con
troversy, others did not.
For many, the headlines warning that
Stanford had overcharged the government
hundreds of millions of dollars told the story.
As flashy revelations dominated the cover
age, the public image of Stanford suffered.

Years
Indirect Costs
Third in a
four-part series

News analysis
Yet, despite the painful financial
legacy, many higher education
experts say the University has come
through the controversy with little
permanent damage to its reputa
tion.
Stanford was merely the first —
and most publicized — target in
what has become a nationwide
campaign to reexamine the system
of indirect costs and the extent to
which the federal government
funds higher education.
But as Kennedy leaves office in
August, the damage to his reputa
tion will not be so easy to repair as
questions remain over how he
handled the controversy.
Although a president cannot be
expected to know of every individ
ual financial transaction, many
within the University say
Kennedy was warned of what was
coming and had ample opportuni
ty to prevent the worst of it.
But at the same time, it is easy
for critics to look back and say
something different should have
been done.
And even if Kennedy or others
had taken a different approach to
the controversy, it might not have
had a real effect on what eventu
ally transpired.
Stanford's indirect-cost rate
began to receive heightened
scrutiny in the fall of 1990
after on-campus Navy regu
lator Paul Biddle began loudly
accusing the Navy and the Uni
versity of having negotiated
"cozy" cost accounting agree
ments.
Indirect costs, as everyone on
campus has grown to learn, are
the expenses associated with
research that cannot be attribut
ed to any particular project, such
as utilities and building mainte
nance.
After the initial reports of
wrongdoing, government auditors
began searching through the
records for inappropriate expens
es to leak, and the University's
rate was knocked down from 74
percent to 70 percent during the
winter of last year as the media
played up every new allegation.
After what was widely thought
to be a disastrous hearing before
the House Subcommitee on Over
sight and Investigations on Stan
ford's indirect-cost practices, the

Navy unilaterally canceled almost
100 cost accounting agreements
and slashed the University's rate
to 55.5 percent in April 1991.
Biddle continued his stream of
accusations through the summer
and following fall, suggesting the
University had overcharged the
government more than $300 mil
lion during the 1980s. He also
filed a qui tarn suit seeking per
sonal reward for the alleged over
billing.
Since then, Biddle has left
Stanford, and the University has
argued that a few isolated mis
takes among three million trans
actions do not indicate a
widespread pattern of abuse.
Subsequent investigations at

other universities have shown
that Stanford was not alone, and
there is also a growing belief that,
at some point, the University's
indirect-cost rate will be increased
back to a level close to the approx
imate actual expenses.
What appear to be the
most obvious mis
takes made in the
controversy were the
first ones. Few expected the con
troversy to snowball into what it
became.
When allegations of indirect
cost overcharges first surfaced in
September 1990, Kennedy was
quick to dismiss them.

He told the Faculty Senate
that the local headlines alleging
Stanford had overcharged the
government $300 million were
"imaginative," laughing that they
were "enough to send trustees off
to their cardiologists."
"I do not expect a discovery of
any wrongdoing on our part,"
Kennedy said at the time.
But, as most people involved in
the controversy generally
acknowledge, these hasty denials
ended up doing little to help Stan
ford's credibility when several of
the more glamorous allegations
were proven true.
"I think that early in the pro
cess we should have withheld all
judgments until we got a really

good external audit of the situa
tion," Kennedy said in a recent
interview. "I think there were
some early statements that in ret
rospect now reflect a little more
confidence than was justified at
the time."
Like a presidential candidate
whose denials of the past lead to
heightened scrutiny, Kennedy's
bold proclamations encouraged
the media — with the help of con
gressional subcommittee leaks —
to seek out the most egregious
past accounting mistakes.
"Once the press got off on a
feeding frenzy, there was no way
to get reason into the discussion,"
said Dean of Research Robert
Byer. "It was not unlike the polit
ical debate now."
The zenith of that frenzy was
probably the "investigative"
report by the ABC news program
"20/20," which focused on the
glamorous revelations and
ignored the long-term research
issues.
Time Senior Editor Paul Witte
man, who worked in the maga
zine's San Francisco bureau until
last year, said Kennedy "probably
misunderstood initially the level
to which the media were interest
ed in the story, but he quickly fig
ured it out."
There is little consensus about
whether the controversy could
have been minimized if Kennedy
had admitted at least a possibility
of wrongdoing at the outset.
"Given the circumstances we
were in — given the rather
unlikely accident of the arrival of
Paul Biddle [as on-campus Navy
regulator], given the rather
unlikely accident that there
would be a story in Science
about the so-called revolt of the
Stanford faculty over indirect
costs, given the interest of the
[House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations] — I
don't think that the result could
have been completely forestalled
or that it could have been made a

lot milder," Kennedy said.
But the controversial and out
spoken Biddle insists he would
not have been so aggressive if
Kennedy's response had been less
"challenging and arrogant."
"Stanford, by the manner in
which it reacted, could have been
like the Harvard Medical School
or MIT and not been so much of a
rallying point," Biddle said.
Yet despite his assertions to
the contrary, Biddle was a media
hound, always willing to offer his
opinion on a new revelation; he
has subsequently become a con
gressional candidate.
In light of these characteris
tics, it is likely that the University
might only have provoked more
attacks from Biddle if it had
admitted that the allegations
were at least partially true.
In the end, it was the presti
gious stature of Stanford that
grabbed the attention.
"If the [congressional] subcom
mittee had chosen to launch an
investigation of Wake Forest, it
wouldn't have made headlines.
But everyone's heard of Stan
ford," said Hoover senior research
fellow Charles Hill.
It was, in effect, an attempt by
Biddle and the congressional sub
commitee to disparage a highly
regarded institution, and Stan
ford took the brunt of the publici
ty-
While Kennedy probably could
not have stopped the controversy
once it began, many point to the
fact that indirect costs was an
issue that should have been
addressed years earlier.
Although indirect costs
did not emerge as a com
mon topic of conversa
tion for most on the
Stanford campus until 18 months
ago, many researchers had been
warning the administration about
the dramatic rise in the Universi
ty's rate for years.
"Faculty Senate people were
saying that the overhead was too
high," said Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy, senate chair in
1981-82. Kennedy should have
"listened more carefully, earlier."
In 1980, Stanford's indirect
cost rate was 58 percent. It rose to
74 percent by 1990, and the Uni
versity requested a rate of 78 per
cent for 1991.
"We were sticking out like a
sore thumb," said Education and
Sociology Prof. Elizabeth Cohen,
chair of this year's senate com
mittee on research. "Our worst
fears were confirmed, and the
administration should have lis
tened to the faculty warnings
about the indirect-cost rate."
Kennedy acknowledges he
should have acted sooner to con
trol the rising rate. "I think I was
not quick enough to recognize the
depth of faculty discontent about
the indirect-cost rate in a timely
fashion and do something more
hard-edged to restrain the rate,"
he said.
But Kennedy also insists that
Stanford was no different than
other universities in aggressively
seeking reimbursement for indi
rect costs.
"For the private research uni
versities that are the most active
players, [the indirect-cost rates]
form a fairly tightly clustered dis
tribution of which Stanford was
near but not quite at the top," he
said. "What I think is fair to say is
that we were in the spectrum of
institutions among the most
active in the pursuit of what we
considered our legitimate inter
ests."
The facts appear to bear
Kennedy out. Harvard Medical
School and MIT also had indirect

cost rates in the range of 70 to 80
percent, and, like Stanford, their
rates subsequently have been hit
hard by the Office of Naval
Research.
In fact, a congressional hearing
held last January found a "sys
temic" problem in the way univer
sities allegedly overbill the gov
ernment for indirect costs.
When looking at the other
prestigious universities investi
gated for indirect-cost over
charges, though, it is quickly
apparent that no other school
faced the same level of heightened
publicity. Perhaps because of its
country club image or simply
because of the presence of Paul
Biddle, Stanford was clearly sin
gled out for special scrutiny, and
Kennedy's reputation, rightly or
wrongly, has suffered for it.
ATfter the early allega
tions of huge over
charges, government
auditors began search
ing for examples of inappropriate
or unallowable costs.
The first revelation came in

December 1990, when govern
ment auditors discovered the Uni
versity had been charging the
depreciation of a yacht to indirect
costs.
The 65-foot yacht Victoria — a
donation that was not even locat
ed on campus — had been inad
vertently included in a cost pool,
and it came to symbolize the sup
posed extravagant abuses of the

As it became clear that Stan
ford was the designated target,
Kennedy became the figure who

were carefully examined, and
costs related to flowers, bedsheets
and a wedding reception received
heavy publicity.

Kennedy was the person called
to defend Stanford before the
House Subcommittee on Over

powerful John Dingell, a Michi
gan Democrat.
The subcommittee is well
known for grabbing headlines
through orchestrated attempts to
embarrass public figures and rev

tions, and the Stanford hearing
succeeded in all respects.
"Don mishandled the Dingell
hearings, but almost anyone

reading the press reports. "When

very different impression," he
said.
Nevertheless, not everyone
watched the hearing. People's
impressions of Kennedy and
Stanford were formed through
the media, and little of the cover
age was designed to make the
University look good.
From the first days of the
controversy, the media
reported what was happen

Many have suggested that the
problem was one of Stanford's
public relations and its dealings
with the media.
"I think the media learned that

in trouble, people get interested in

Kennedy said. "And I think we
experienced some piling on."

Even if the media was accu

Kennedy "handled indirect

But Bob Beyers, the former
long-time director of the Stanford

should have been more open in
dealing with the controversy.
"I cannot imagine a more
unfortunate series of decisions
than those taken after the initial
inquiry of Congressman Dingell
because they saw the inquiry as
something routine," Beyers said.
"The way they handled indirect
costs was the classic way not to
handle irVormation that should
go to the public."
Now, when it is perhaps too
late, the tide has turned in the
media. Where editorials once lam
basted Kennedy for extravagance,
they now praise the nation's uni
versity research system and urge
that the government protect it.
But the changing perspective is
no longer on the front pages, and
the impressions of Stanford's
indirect-cost practices have
already had their effect on both
its reputation and, more perma
nently, that of Kennedy.
As the days of spectacular
headlines wind down and
the controversy enters
its protracted legal stage,
many are now looking back on the
last 18 months and assessing the
damage — both financial and rep
utational.
There is no question that Stan
ford's short-term reputation has
suffered as a result of the endless
negative publicity. Countless sto
ries have already emphasized the
handful of glamorous accounting
mistakes and created an image of
a country club university that

sought to defraud the govern
ment.
"It was a collision of two cul
tures," McManus said. "Within
the University, Kennedy's hon
esty and Stanford's good faith are
taken for granted; if something

has gone wrong, we assume it was
a good faith error.
"Go up to Capital Hill, though,
and there are assumptions about
greed and duplicity," McManus
added.
"In the end, all of higher edu-

cation is being damaged," said for
mer Provost James Rosse, who
resigned in April to head Freedom
Newspapers, Inc. "The fact that
Stanford was prominent during
the process probably affects Stan
ford more than others.
"But I do not detect any partic
ular singling out of Stanford (out
side the University) as much as
one might think," Rosse added.
Dean of Research Byer said the
investigation of Stanford's indi
rect costs was merely one part of a
larger attack on higher education.
"The indirect-cost controversy
was just a symptom of the prob
lem. The government is saving
money by trying to skimp on
expenses and not pay the average
cost of research," Byer said. "This
is part of a discussion on
how this country will choose to
invest in its future.
"In the long run, it will not
hurt Stanford more than others,"
he added.
Two more objective ways to
measure the effects on the Uni
versity's reputation are fund rais
ing and admissions.
Last year was the final one in
Stanford's $1.1 billion Centennial
Campaign, and, despite the fact
that the ultimate total exceeded
expectations, there was still some
effect.
"We'll probably never know to
what extent the indirect-cost con
troversy hurt us," said Elizabeth
Sloan, director of communica
tions for the Office of Develop
ment.
"But most donors know that
that was inflated. We tried to do a
good job communicating our posi
tion on that issue."
The effect on admissions is also
difficult to gauge. The worst of
the coverage came in the first
three months of 1991 — just after
applications were due for the fol
lowing year's class.
While the hearing and the
drastic reduction in the Universi
ty's cost rate came just as
prospective freshmen were mak
ing their final selection, the effect
seemed minimal, as fewer stu

dents were accepted from the wait
list than in previous years.
"My gut feeling is that it had
some small effect, but I couldn't
support that with numbers," said
Jean Fetter, former director of
undergraduate admissions.

Ultimately, most believe that
Stanford is a strong enough insti
tution that such a controversy
will do no permanent damage.
"The mark it leaves on the
University will be quite transient.
People make very different judg
ments about things in the light of
subsequent events," Kennedy
said. "As time goes on and the
scandalous assertions fade and a
more measured view comes to be
part of conventional wisdom, I
think Stanford will be just fine."
But, many people say, the
effects on Kennedy's reputation
are not so easily dismissed.
Whenever Kennedy's
name appears in
print these days, it is
followed by a phrase
like, "who resigned last August
because of allegations of over
billing for research overhead."
He is seemingly inseparable
from the controversy, despite the
fact that as University president
he had little to do with indirect
costs.
In a letter to The New York
Times last November, Kennedy
warned of a "computer virus"
loose at the newspaper that auto
matically included mention of the
indirect-cost controversy with any
story mentioning either Kennedy
or Stanford, including an article
about a polygamous doctor at the
Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal.
"If you think Don Kennedy
knew anything about the intrica
cies of indirect costs at the outset
of the whole mess, you're crazy,"
said Emeritus Psychology Prof.
Albert Hastorf, Kennedy's first
provost. "He should have let oth
ers share responsibility for that
issue."
Cohen, chair of the senate com
mittee on research, agreed that
Kennedy knew little about the
problem, but said as boss he had
to be accountable.
"I don't blame Donald
Kennedy. I blame the administra
tive style," Cohen said. "But it
happened on his watch, and he

had to bear responsibility for it.
"That's why one might not
want to be a university presi
dent," she added.
Although he might not want to
admit it, friends of Kennedy say
he was deeply affected by the
repeated charges directed against
him.
"How much has it hurt him as
a person? It was a deep wound,
but a wound that I think has
healed," Rosse said.
"He has recovered from it, and
I think he is now a stronger per
son. But it was a serious person
al trauma."
Kennedy said he recognizes he
is tied to the controversy and
accepts it, saying that what he
thinks of himself is more impor
tant than what others say.
"There will be some people
who lost interest in this whole
business the day after the yacht
and flowers who may still associ
ate that with me. That is just
something I will have to live with,
and it doesn't bother me," he said.
"I don't have a problem with how
I see myself.
"I know I made some mistakes.
I know that I made some good
decisions. ... I don't have the
feeling about myself that there is
some tarnish there," Kennedy
added.
How people view Kennedy may
very well depend on how closely
they look. The cursory glance at
the most recent headlines will
connect him to the controversy,
but a thorough examination will
likely include indirect costs as
only one event in 12 years of var
ied accomplishments.
The financial legacy, however,
may not be so easy to overlook.
The abrupt reduction in
indirect-cost reimburse
ment has devastated the
University's finances,
costing as much as $30 million per
year.
Stanford is now completing a
painful $43 million budget-cut
ting process, and many academic
programs and administrative
staff support have been slashed.
The budget problems do not
end there.
The system of tuition remis
sion — a method of financing the
tuition of graduate students
involved in sponsored research

through indirect costs — is cur
rently being threatened, and
many believe it will end in the
next two years.
If researchers were forced to
charge graduate student tuition
on their direct research grant, it
is likely that fewer graduate stu-»
dents would be funded and up to
25 percent might be replaced with
cheaper post-doctoral students.
The reduced indirect-cost rate
has also "cost us one new science
building per year in the last two
years," said Byer. Until the Uni
versity and Navy negotiate a n r
rate, the same financial prouxems
will continue.
Of course, two years from now
the University's fiscal situation
could improve if it wins its legal
appeal of last year's abrupt rate
reduction by the Navy.
But Kennedy will not leave
Stanford with all of the indirect
cost issues unresolved.
Things such as a Defense Con
tract Audit Agency study claiming
that Stanford overcharged the gov
ernment by at least $310 million
during the 1980s have been dis
credited, as most observers agree
that the cost agreements signed
during the decade are valid, bind
ing contracts.
In additipn, one of the people
disciplined by the Navy for negoti
ating the allegedly "cozy" cost
accounting agreements with
Stanford has subsequently been
returned to his job.
An expensive overhaul of the
University's internal cost
accounting systems has begun,
and the six-month report card
indicates progress is being made.
Kennedy said he has, in fact,
decided to "leave the runway as
clear as it can possibly be" for
incoming University President
Gerhard Casper.
Perhaps that was the way
Kennedy eventually chose to han
dle this entire controversy.
Some important mistakes were
made early on, and, once the
unstoppable barrage of publicity
began, Kennedy accepted respon
sibility for the institution.
"If you are seen as the person
with oversight when a problem
occurs, it is difficult to set that
aside," said Freelen. "He could
have easily tried to point fingers
at other people, but it was most
honorable to take the blame."

Kennedy, with Board of Trustees President James Gaither at his side, speaks to reporters about his
resignation as Stanford president last July.
To attack an institution, congression
al subcommittees have learned, one
must find an individual to serve as
the target.
Stanford's point man — and the person
who came to be most closely tied to the indi
rect-cost controversy — was University
President Donald Kennedy.
Through the crisis, Kennedy was por
trayed as a president who failed to keep
watch over his accountants, allowing federal
research funds to be spent on furnishings
and flowers for his home and upkeep of a
University yacht.
"It is a natural reflex to personalize
things and simplify complex issues," said
Doyle McManus, a reporter in the Los Ange
les Times Washington bureau and a member
of Stanford's Board of Trustees. U.S. Rep.
John Dingell "promoted stories that Donald

Kennedy was buying sheets and that gets
more circulation," McManus said. "It fits
more easily into the paradigm of journalistic
scandal."
As the harshest criticism focused upon
him, Kennedy took on the role of embattled
defender of the University, eventually
accepting responsibility for what occurred
and submitting his resignation.
For the past 18 months, indirect costs, a

standard but relatively unknown method of
financing research at universities nation
wide, has been transformed into a buzzword
for the accounting errors that permitted
such extravagance.
Through the intense publicity, people
previously unfamiliar with the intricacies of
federally sponsored research have learned a
great deal as they watched the indirect-cost
rate plummet and the University's budget
deficit grow larger and larger.
But while some took the time to under
stand the details — and separate the facts
from the exaggerated half-truths — of what
has become known as the indirect-cost con
troversy, others did not.
For many, the headlines warning that
Stanford had overcharged the government
hundreds of millions of dollars told the story.
As flashy revelations dominated the cover
age, the public image of Stanford suffered.

Years
Indirect Costs
Third in a
four-part series

News analysis
Yet, despite the painful financial
legacy, many higher education
experts say the University has come
through the controversy with little
permanent damage to its reputa
tion.
Stanford was merely the first —
and most publicized — target in
what has become a nationwide
campaign to reexamine the system
of indirect costs and the extent to
which the federal government
funds higher education.
But as Kennedy leaves office in
August, the damage to his reputa
tion will not be so easy to repair as
questions remain over how he
handled the controversy.
Although a president cannot be
expected to know of every individ
ual financial transaction, many
within the University say
Kennedy was warned of what was
coming and had ample opportuni
ty to prevent the worst of it.
But at the same time, it is easy
for critics to look back and say
something different should have
been done.
And even if Kennedy or others
had taken a different approach to
the controversy, it might not have
had a real effect on what eventu
ally transpired.
Stanford's indirect-cost rate
began to receive heightened
scrutiny in the fall of 1990
after on-campus Navy regu
lator Paul Biddle began loudly
accusing the Navy and the Uni
versity of having negotiated
"cozy" cost accounting agree
ments.
Indirect costs, as everyone on
campus has grown to learn, are
the expenses associated with
research that cannot be attribut
ed to any particular project, such
as utilities and building mainte
nance.
After the initial reports of
wrongdoing, government auditors
began searching through the
records for inappropriate expens
es to leak, and the University's
rate was knocked down from 74
percent to 70 percent during the
winter of last year as the media
played up every new allegation.
After what was widely thought
to be a disastrous hearing before
the House Subcommitee on Over
sight and Investigations on Stan
ford's indirect-cost practices, the

Navy unilaterally canceled almost
100 cost accounting agreements
and slashed the University's rate
to 55.5 percent in April 1991.
Biddle continued his stream of
accusations through the summer
and following fall, suggesting the
University had overcharged the
government more than $300 mil
lion during the 1980s. He also
filed a qui tarn suit seeking per
sonal reward for the alleged over
billing.
Since then, Biddle has left
Stanford, and the University has
argued that a few isolated mis
takes among three million trans
actions do not indicate a
widespread pattern of abuse.
Subsequent investigations at

other universities have shown
that Stanford was not alone, and
there is also a growing belief that,
at some point, the University's
indirect-cost rate will be increased
back to a level close to the approx
imate actual expenses.
What appear to be the
most obvious mis
takes made in the
controversy were the
first ones. Few expected the con
troversy to snowball into what it
became.
When allegations of indirect
cost overcharges first surfaced in
September 1990, Kennedy was
quick to dismiss them.

He told the Faculty Senate
that the local headlines alleging
Stanford had overcharged the
government $300 million were
"imaginative," laughing that they
were "enough to send trustees off
to their cardiologists."
"I do not expect a discovery of
any wrongdoing on our part,"
Kennedy said at the time.
But, as most people involved in
the controversy generally
acknowledge, these hasty denials
ended up doing little to help Stan
ford's credibility when several of
the more glamorous allegations
were proven true.
"I think that early in the pro
cess we should have withheld all
judgments until we got a really

good external audit of the situa
tion," Kennedy said in a recent
interview. "I think there were
some early statements that in ret
rospect now reflect a little more
confidence than was justified at
the time."
Like a presidential candidate
whose denials of the past lead to
heightened scrutiny, Kennedy's
bold proclamations encouraged
the media — with the help of con
gressional subcommittee leaks —
to seek out the most egregious
past accounting mistakes.
"Once the press got off on a
feeding frenzy, there was no way
to get reason into the discussion,"
said Dean of Research Robert
Byer. "It was not unlike the polit
ical debate now."
The zenith of that frenzy was
probably the "investigative"
report by the ABC news program
"20/20," which focused on the
glamorous revelations and
ignored the long-term research
issues.
Time Senior Editor Paul Witte
man, who worked in the maga
zine's San Francisco bureau until
last year, said Kennedy "probably
misunderstood initially the level
to which the media were interest
ed in the story, but he quickly fig
ured it out."
There is little consensus about
whether the controversy could
have been minimized if Kennedy
had admitted at least a possibility
of wrongdoing at the outset.
"Given the circumstances we
were in — given the rather
unlikely accident of the arrival of
Paul Biddle [as on-campus Navy
regulator], given the rather
unlikely accident that there
would be a story in Science
about the so-called revolt of the
Stanford faculty over indirect
costs, given the interest of the
[House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations] — I
don't think that the result could
have been completely forestalled
or that it could have been made a

lot milder," Kennedy said.
But the controversial and out
spoken Biddle insists he would
not have been so aggressive if
Kennedy's response had been less
"challenging and arrogant."
"Stanford, by the manner in
which it reacted, could have been
like the Harvard Medical School
or MIT and not been so much of a
rallying point," Biddle said.
Yet despite his assertions to
the contrary, Biddle was a media
hound, always willing to offer his
opinion on a new revelation; he
has subsequently become a con
gressional candidate.
In light of these characteris
tics, it is likely that the University
might only have provoked more
attacks from Biddle if it had
admitted that the allegations
were at least partially true.
In the end, it was the presti
gious stature of Stanford that
grabbed the attention.
"If the [congressional] subcom
mittee had chosen to launch an
investigation of Wake Forest, it
wouldn't have made headlines.
But everyone's heard of Stan
ford," said Hoover senior research
fellow Charles Hill.
It was, in effect, an attempt by
Biddle and the congressional sub
commitee to disparage a highly
regarded institution, and Stan
ford took the brunt of the publici
ty-
While Kennedy probably could
not have stopped the controversy
once it began, many point to the
fact that indirect costs was an
issue that should have been
addressed years earlier.
Although indirect costs
did not emerge as a com
mon topic of conversa
tion for most on the
Stanford campus until 18 months
ago, many researchers had been
warning the administration about
the dramatic rise in the Universi
ty's rate for years.
"Faculty Senate people were
saying that the overhead was too
high," said Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy, senate chair in
1981-82. Kennedy should have
"listened more carefully, earlier."
In 1980, Stanford's indirect
cost rate was 58 percent. It rose to
74 percent by 1990, and the Uni
versity requested a rate of 78 per
cent for 1991.
"We were sticking out like a
sore thumb," said Education and
Sociology Prof. Elizabeth Cohen,
chair of this year's senate com
mittee on research. "Our worst
fears were confirmed, and the
administration should have lis
tened to the faculty warnings
about the indirect-cost rate."
Kennedy acknowledges he
should have acted sooner to con
trol the rising rate. "I think I was
not quick enough to recognize the
depth of faculty discontent about
the indirect-cost rate in a timely
fashion and do something more
hard-edged to restrain the rate,"
he said.
But Kennedy also insists that
Stanford was no different than
other universities in aggressively
seeking reimbursement for indi
rect costs.
"For the private research uni
versities that are the most active
players, [the indirect-cost rates]
form a fairly tightly clustered dis
tribution of which Stanford was
near but not quite at the top," he
said. "What I think is fair to say is
that we were in the spectrum of
institutions among the most
active in the pursuit of what we
considered our legitimate inter
ests."
The facts appear to bear
Kennedy out. Harvard Medical
School and MIT also had indirect

cost rates in the range of 70 to 80
percent, and, like Stanford, their
rates subsequently have been hit
hard by the Office of Naval
Research.
In fact, a congressional hearing
held last January found a "sys
temic" problem in the way univer
sities allegedly overbill the gov
ernment for indirect costs.
When looking at the other
prestigious universities investi
gated for indirect-cost over
charges, though, it is quickly
apparent that no other school
faced the same level of heightened
publicity. Perhaps because of its
country club image or simply
because of the presence of Paul
Biddle, Stanford was clearly sin
gled out for special scrutiny, and
Kennedy's reputation, rightly or
wrongly, has suffered for it.
ATfter the early allega
tions of huge over
charges, government
auditors began search
ing for examples of inappropriate
or unallowable costs.
The first revelation came in

December 1990, when govern
ment auditors discovered the Uni
versity had been charging the
depreciation of a yacht to indirect
costs.
The 65-foot yacht Victoria — a
donation that was not even locat
ed on campus — had been inad
vertently included in a cost pool,
and it came to symbolize the sup
posed extravagant abuses of the
University.
As it became clear that Stan
ford was the designated target,
Kennedy became the figure who
was attacked. Records of his offi
cial residence, Hoover House,
were carefully examined, and
costs related to flowers, bedsheets
and a wedding reception received
heavy publicity.
"Part of the Dingell subcom
mittee staff strategy and their
friends in the media was to make
it look as though some of these
expenditures in indirect-cost
pools were expenditures that
somehow sponsored a high
lifestyle on the part of the presi

House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. "The record today does you
and the University no credit," Dingell told Kennedy at the end of a scathing address
during the hearing.
dent and his wife," Kennedy said.
"There were those unbelievably
tasteless cartoons in the San Jose
Mercury News.
"That is not fun for fairly sen
sitive people with children to look
at. It is also not fair," he added.
Kennedy was the person called
to defend Stanford before the
House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations and the
powerful John Dingell, a Michi
gan Democrat.
The subcommittee is well
known for grabbing headlines
through orchestrated attempts to
embarrass public figures and rev
elations of startling new allega
tions, and the Stanford hearing
succeeded in all respects.
"Don mishandled the Dingell
hearings, but almost anyone
would have," McManus said."The
hearing is designed to spotlight a
chosen villain. Nobody could come
out looking good."
Yet Kennedy says the impres
sion most people get from the
hearing is not from watching the
tape of his testimony but from
reading the press reports. "When
people look at the tape of the
hearing, they come away with a
very different impression," he
said.
Nevertheless, not everyone
watched the hearing. People's
impressions of Kennedy and
Stanford were formed through
the media, and little of the cover
age was designed to make the
University look good.
From the first days of the
controversy, the media
reported what was happen
ing leak by leak — and
almost all of the information was
coming from the government.
Many have suggested that the
problem was one of Stanford's
public relations and its dealings
with the media.
"I think the media learned that
when important institutions are
in trouble, people get interested in
it and it sells newspapers,"
Kennedy said. "And I think we
experienced some piling on."
But Kennedy admitted that "if
there hadn't been a problem,
there wouldn't have been media
attention."
Even if the media was accu
rately reporting what it knew, all
that was being covered was the
government's side of the story
through anonymous sources,
while the University did little to
answer back.
"You don't fight allegations
with counterpublicity," said
Robert Freelen, Stanford's vice
president for public affairs, in a
recent interview. "You fight alle
gations with facts.
"It doesn't serve you well to
make more allegations without
facts to back them up," Freelen
added. "The accuser always has
the advantage in this type of situ
ation."
Others also defend Stanford's
handling of the controversy, say
ing little can be done in that type
of situation.
Kennedy "handled indirect
costs as well as any president
could have," said Trustee Henry
Muller, managing editor of Time

magazine. "It's too easy in retro
spect to say what could have been
done."
But Bob Beyers, the former
long-time director of the Stanford
News Service, said the University
should have been more open in
dealing with the controversy.
"I cannot imagine a more
unfortunate series of decisions
than those taken after the initial
inquiry of Congressman Dingell
because they saw the inquiry as
something routine," Beyers said.
"The way they handled indirect
costs was the classic way not to
handle irVormation that should
go to the public."
Now, when it is perhaps too
late, the tide has turned in the
media. Where editorials once lam
basted Kennedy for extravagance,
they now praise the nation's uni
versity research system and urge
that the government protect it.
But the changing perspective is
no longer on the front pages, and
the impressions of Stanford's
indirect-cost practices have
already had their effect on both
its reputation and, more perma
nently, that of Kennedy.
As the days of spectacular
headlines wind down and
the controversy enters
its protracted legal stage,
many are now looking back on the
last 18 months and assessing the
damage — both financial and rep
utational.
There is no question that Stan
ford's short-term reputation has
suffered as a result of the endless
negative publicity. Countless sto
ries have already emphasized the
handful of glamorous accounting
mistakes and created an image of
a country club university that

sought to defraud the govern
ment.
"It was a collision of two cul
tures," McManus said. "Within

taken for granted; if something

has gone wrong, we assume it was
a good faith error.
"Go up to Capital Hill, though,
and there are assumptions about
greed and duplicity," McManus
added.
"In the end, all of higher edu-

cation is being damaged," said for
mer Provost James Rosse, who
resigned in April to head Freedom

larger attack on higher education.
"The indirect-cost controversy
was just a symptom of the prob

money by trying to skimp on

cost of research," Byer said. "This
is part of a discussion on
how this country will choose to
invest in its future.
"In the long run, it will not
hurt Stanford more than others,"
he added.
Two more objective ways to
measure the effects on the Uni
versity's reputation are fund rais
ing and admissions.
Last year was the final one in
Stanford's $1.1 billion Centennial
Campaign, and, despite the fact
that the ultimate total exceeded
expectations, there was still some
effect.
"We'll probably never know to
what extent the indirect-cost con
troversy hurt us," said Elizabeth

"But most donors know that
that was inflated. We tried to do a
good job communicating our posi
tion on that issue."
The effect on admissions is also
difficult to gauge. The worst of
the coverage came in the first
three months of 1991 — just after
applications were due for the fol
lowing year's class.
While the hearing and the
drastic reduction in the Universi

prospective freshmen were mak

seemed minimal, as fewer stu

mittee on research, agreed that
Kennedy knew little about the
problem, but said as boss he had
to be accountable.
"I don't blame Donald
Kennedy. I blame the administra
tive style," Cohen said. "But it
happened on his watch, and he

had to bear responsibility for it.
"That's why one might not
want to be a university presi
dent," she added.
Although he might not want to
admit it, friends of Kennedy say
he was deeply affected by the
repeated charges directed against
him.
"How much has it hurt him as
a person? It was a deep wound,
but a wound that I think has
healed," Rosse said.
"He has recovered from it, and
I think he is now a stronger per
son. But it was a serious person
al trauma."
Kennedy said he recognizes he
is tied to the controversy and
accepts it, saying that what he
thinks of himself is more impor
tant than what others say.
"There will be some people
who lost interest in this whole
business the day after the yacht
and flowers who may still associ
ate that with me. That is just
something I will have to live with,
and it doesn't bother me," he said.
"I don't have a problem with how
I see myself.
"I know I made some mistakes.
I know that I made some good
decisions. ... I don't have the
feeling about myself that there is
some tarnish there," Kennedy
added.
How people view Kennedy may
very well depend on how closely
they look. The cursory glance at
the most recent headlines will
connect him to the controversy,
but a thorough examination will
likely include indirect costs as
only one event in 12 years of var
ied accomplishments.
The financial legacy, however,
may not be so easy to overlook.
The abrupt reduction in
indirect-cost reimburse
ment has devastated the
University's finances,
costing as much as $30 million per
year.
Stanford is now completing a
painful $43 million budget-cut
ting process, and many academic
programs and administrative
staff support have been slashed.
The budget problems do not
end there.
The system of tuition remis
sion — a method of financing the
tuition of graduate students
involved in sponsored research

through indirect costs — is cur
rently being threatened, and
many believe it will end in the
next two years.
If researchers were forced to
charge graduate student tuition
on their direct research grant, it
is likely that fewer graduate stu-»
dents would be funded and up to
25 percent might be replaced with
cheaper post-doctoral students.
The reduced indirect-cost rate
has also "cost us one new science
building per year in the last two
years," said Byer. Until the Uni
versity and Navy negotiate a n r
rate, the same financial prouxems
will continue.
Of course, two years from now
the University's fiscal situation
could improve if it wins its legal
appeal of last year's abrupt rate
reduction by the Navy.
But Kennedy will not leave
Stanford with all of the indirect
cost issues unresolved.
Things such as a Defense Con
tract Audit Agency study claiming
that Stanford overcharged the gov
ernment by at least $310 million
during the 1980s have been dis
credited, as most observers agree
that the cost agreements signed
during the decade are valid, bind
ing contracts.
In additipn, one of the people
disciplined by the Navy for negoti
ating the allegedly "cozy" cost
accounting agreements with
Stanford has subsequently been
returned to his job.
An expensive overhaul of the
University's internal cost
accounting systems has begun,
and the six-month report card
indicates progress is being made.
Kennedy said he has, in fact,
decided to "leave the runway as
clear as it can possibly be" for
incoming University President
Gerhard Casper.
Perhaps that was the way
Kennedy eventually chose to han
dle this entire controversy.
Some important mistakes were
made early on, and, once the
unstoppable barrage of publicity
began, Kennedy accepted respon
sibility for the institution.
"If you are seen as the person
with oversight when a problem
occurs, it is difficult to set that
aside," said Freelen. "He could
have easily tried to point fingers
at other people, but it was most
honorable to take the blame."

Kennedy, with Board of Trustees President James Gaither at his side, speaks to reporters about his
resignation as Stanford president last July.
To attack an institution, congression
al subcommittees have learned, one
must find an individual to serve as
the target.
Stanford's point man — and the person
who came to be most closely tied to the indi
rect-cost controversy — was University
President Donald Kennedy.
Through the crisis, Kennedy was por
trayed as a president who failed to keep
watch over his accountants, allowing federal
research funds to be spent on furnishings
and flowers for his home and upkeep of a
University yacht.
"It is a natural reflex to personalize
things and simplify complex issues," said
Doyle McManus, a reporter in the Los Ange
les Times Washington bureau and a member
of Stanford's Board of Trustees. U.S. Rep.
John Dingell "promoted stories that Donald

Kennedy was buying sheets and that gets
more circulation," McManus said. "It fits
more easily into the paradigm of journalistic
scandal."
As the harshest criticism focused upon
him, Kennedy took on the role of embattled
defender of the University, eventually
accepting responsibility for what occurred
and submitting his resignation.
For the past 18 months, indirect costs, a

standard but relatively unknown method of
financing research at universities nation
wide, has been transformed into a buzzword
for the accounting errors that permitted
such extravagance.
Through the intense publicity, people
previously unfamiliar with the intricacies of
federally sponsored research have learned a
great deal as they watched the indirect-cost
rate plummet and the University's budget
deficit grow larger and larger.
But while some took the time to under
stand the details — and separate the facts
from the exaggerated half-truths — of what
has become known as the indirect-cost con
troversy, others did not.
For many, the headlines warning that
Stanford had overcharged the government
hundreds of millions of dollars told the story.
As flashy revelations dominated the cover
age, the public image of Stanford suffered.

Years
Indirect Costs
Third in a
four-part series

News analysis
Yet, despite the painful financial
legacy, many higher education
experts say the University has come
through the controversy with little
permanent damage to its reputa
tion.
Stanford was merely the first —
and most publicized — target in
what has become a nationwide
campaign to reexamine the system
of indirect costs and the extent to
which the federal government
funds higher education.
But as Kennedy leaves office in
August, the damage to his reputa
tion will not be so easy to repair as
questions remain over how he
handled the controversy.
Although a president cannot be
expected to know of every individ
ual financial transaction, many
within the University say
Kennedy was warned of what was
coming and had ample opportuni
ty to prevent the worst of it.
But at the same time, it is easy
for critics to look back and say
something different should have
been done.
And even if Kennedy or others
had taken a different approach to
the controversy, it might not have
had a real effect on what eventu
ally transpired.
Stanford's indirect-cost rate
began to receive heightened
scrutiny in the fall of 1990
after on-campus Navy regu
lator Paul Biddle began loudly
accusing the Navy and the Uni
versity of having negotiated
"cozy" cost accounting agree
ments.
Indirect costs, as everyone on
campus has grown to learn, are
the expenses associated with
research that cannot be attribut
ed to any particular project, such
as utilities and building mainte
nance.
After the initial reports of
wrongdoing, government auditors
began searching through the
records for inappropriate expens
es to leak, and the University's
rate was knocked down from 74
percent to 70 percent during the
winter of last year as the media
played up every new allegation.
After what was widely thought
to be a disastrous hearing before
the House Subcommitee on Over
sight and Investigations on Stan
ford's indirect-cost practices, the

Navy unilaterally canceled almost
100 cost accounting agreements
and slashed the University's rate
to 55.5 percent in April 1991.
Biddle continued his stream of
accusations through the summer
and following fall, suggesting the
University had overcharged the
government more than $300 mil
lion during the 1980s. He also
filed a qui tarn suit seeking per
sonal reward for the alleged over
billing.
Since then, Biddle has left
Stanford, and the University has
argued that a few isolated mis
takes among three million trans
actions do not indicate a
widespread pattern of abuse.
Subsequent investigations at

other universities have shown
that Stanford was not alone, and
there is also a growing belief that,
at some point, the University's
indirect-cost rate will be increased
back to a level close to the approx
imate actual expenses.
What appear to be the
most obvious mis
takes made in the
controversy were the
first ones. Few expected the con
troversy to snowball into what it
became.
When allegations of indirect
cost overcharges first surfaced in
September 1990, Kennedy was
quick to dismiss them.

He told the Faculty Senate
that the local headlines alleging
Stanford had overcharged the
government $300 million were
"imaginative," laughing that they
were "enough to send trustees off
to their cardiologists."
"I do not expect a discovery of
any wrongdoing on our part,"
Kennedy said at the time.
But, as most people involved in
the controversy generally
acknowledge, these hasty denials
ended up doing little to help Stan
ford's credibility when several of
the more glamorous allegations
were proven true.
"I think that early in the pro
cess we should have withheld all
judgments until we got a really

good external audit of the situa
tion," Kennedy said in a recent
interview. "I think there were
some early statements that in ret
rospect now reflect a little more
confidence than was justified at
the time."
Like a presidential candidate
whose denials of the past lead to
heightened scrutiny, Kennedy's
bold proclamations encouraged
the media — with the help of con
gressional subcommittee leaks —
to seek out the most egregious
past accounting mistakes.
"Once the press got off on a
feeding frenzy, there was no way
to get reason into the discussion,"
said Dean of Research Robert
Byer. "It was not unlike the polit
ical debate now."
The zenith of that frenzy was
probably the "investigative"
report by the ABC news program
"20/20," which focused on the
glamorous revelations and
ignored the long-term research
issues.
Time Senior Editor Paul Witte
man, who worked in the maga
zine's San Francisco bureau until
last year, said Kennedy "probably
misunderstood initially the level
to which the media were interest
ed in the story, but he quickly fig
ured it out."
There is little consensus about
whether the controversy could
have been minimized if Kennedy
had admitted at least a possibility
of wrongdoing at the outset.
"Given the circumstances we
were in — given the rather
unlikely accident of the arrival of
Paul Biddle [as on-campus Navy
regulator], given the rather
unlikely accident that there
would be a story in Science
about the so-called revolt of the
Stanford faculty over indirect
costs, given the interest of the
[House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations] — I
don't think that the result could
have been completely forestalled
or that it could have been made a

lot milder," Kennedy said.
But the controversial and out
spoken Biddle insists he would
not have been so aggressive if
Kennedy's response had been less
"challenging and arrogant."
"Stanford, by the manner in
which it reacted, could have been
like the Harvard Medical School
or MIT and not been so much of a
rallying point," Biddle said.
Yet despite his assertions to
the contrary, Biddle was a media
hound, always willing to offer his
opinion on a new revelation; he
has subsequently become a con
gressional candidate.
In light of these characteris
tics, it is likely that the University
might only have provoked more
attacks from Biddle if it had
admitted that the allegations
were at least partially true.
In the end, it was the presti
gious stature of Stanford that
grabbed the attention.
"If the [congressional] subcom
mittee had chosen to launch an
investigation of Wake Forest, it
wouldn't have made headlines.
But everyone's heard of Stan
ford," said Hoover senior research
fellow Charles Hill.
It was, in effect, an attempt by
Biddle and the congressional sub
commitee to disparage a highly
regarded institution, and Stan
ford took the brunt of the publici
ty-
While Kennedy probably could
not have stopped the controversy
once it began, many point to the
fact that indirect costs was an
issue that should have been
addressed years earlier.
Although indirect costs
did not emerge as a com
mon topic of conversa
tion for most on the
Stanford campus until 18 months
ago, many researchers had been
warning the administration about
the dramatic rise in the Universi
ty's rate for years.
"Faculty Senate people were
saying that the overhead was too
high," said Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy, senate chair in
1981-82. Kennedy should have
"listened more carefully, earlier."
In 1980, Stanford's indirect
cost rate was 58 percent. It rose to
74 percent by 1990, and the Uni
versity requested a rate of 78 per
cent for 1991.
"We were sticking out like a
sore thumb," said Education and
Sociology Prof. Elizabeth Cohen,
chair of this year's senate com
mittee on research. "Our worst
fears were confirmed, and the
administration should have lis
tened to the faculty warnings
about the indirect-cost rate."
Kennedy acknowledges he
should have acted sooner to con
trol the rising rate. "I think I was
not quick enough to recognize the
depth of faculty discontent about
the indirect-cost rate in a timely
fashion and do something more
hard-edged to restrain the rate,"
he said.
But Kennedy also insists that
Stanford was no different than
other universities in aggressively
seeking reimbursement for indi
rect costs.
"For the private research uni
versities that are the most active
players, [the indirect-cost rates]
form a fairly tightly clustered dis
tribution of which Stanford was
near but not quite at the top," he
said. "What I think is fair to say is
that we were in the spectrum of
institutions among the most
active in the pursuit of what we
considered our legitimate inter
ests."
The facts appear to bear
Kennedy out. Harvard Medical
School and MIT also had indirect

cost rates in the range of 70 to 80
percent, and, like Stanford, their
rates subsequently have been hit
hard by the Office of Naval
Research.
In fact, a congressional hearing
held last January found a "sys
temic" problem in the way univer
sities allegedly overbill the gov
ernment for indirect costs.
When looking at the other
prestigious universities investi
gated for indirect-cost over
charges, though, it is quickly
apparent that no other school
faced the same level of heightened
publicity. Perhaps because of its
country club image or simply
because of the presence of Paul
Biddle, Stanford was clearly sin
gled out for special scrutiny, and
Kennedy's reputation, rightly or
wrongly, has suffered for it.
ATfter the early allega
tions of huge over
charges, government
auditors began search
ing for examples of inappropriate
or unallowable costs.
The first revelation came in

December 1990, when govern
ment auditors discovered the Uni
versity had been charging the
depreciation of a yacht to indirect
costs.
The 65-foot yacht Victoria — a
donation that was not even locat
ed on campus — had been inad
vertently included in a cost pool,
and it came to symbolize the sup
posed extravagant abuses of the
University.
As it became clear that Stan
ford was the designated target,
Kennedy became the figure who
was attacked. Records of his offi
cial residence, Hoover House,
were carefully examined, and
costs related to flowers, bedsheets
and a wedding reception received
heavy publicity.
"Part of the Dingell subcom
mittee staff strategy and their
friends in the media was to make
it look as though some of these
expenditures in indirect-cost
pools were expenditures that
somehow sponsored a high
lifestyle on the part of the presi

rect-cost practices last March before the powerful Rep. John Dingell, above, and his
House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. "The record today does you
and the University no credit," Dingell told Kennedy at the end of a scathing address
during the hearing.
dent and his wife," Kennedy said.
"There were those unbelievably
tasteless cartoons in the San Jose
Mercury News.
"That is not fun for fairly sen
sitive people with children to look
at. It is also not fair," he added.
Kennedy was the person called
to defend Stanford before the
House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations and the
powerful John Dingell, a Michi
gan Democrat.
The subcommittee is well
known for grabbing headlines
through orchestrated attempts to
embarrass public figures and rev
elations of startling new allega
tions, and the Stanford hearing
succeeded in all respects.
"Don mishandled the Dingell
hearings, but almost anyone
would have," McManus said."The
hearing is designed to spotlight a
chosen villain. Nobody could come
out looking good."
Yet Kennedy says the impres
sion most people get from the
hearing is not from watching the
tape of his testimony but from
reading the press reports. "When
people look at the tape of the
hearing, they come away with a
very different impression," he
said.
Nevertheless, not everyone
watched the hearing. People's
impressions of Kennedy and
Stanford were formed through
the media, and little of the cover
age was designed to make the
University look good.
From the first days of the
controversy, the media
reported what was happen
ing leak by leak — and
almost all of the information was
coming from the government.
Many have suggested that the
problem was one of Stanford's
public relations and its dealings
with the media.
"I think the media learned that
when important institutions are
in trouble, people get interested in
it and it sells newspapers,"
Kennedy said. "And I think we
experienced some piling on."
But Kennedy admitted that "if
there hadn't been a problem,
there wouldn't have been media
attention."
Even if the media was accu
rately reporting what it knew, all
that was being covered was the
government's side of the story
through anonymous sources,
while the University did little to
answer back.
"You don't fight allegations
with counterpublicity," said
Robert Freelen, Stanford's vice
president for public affairs, in a
recent interview. "You fight alle
gations with facts.
"It doesn't serve you well to
make more allegations without
facts to back them up," Freelen
added. "The accuser always has
the advantage in this type of situ
ation."
Others also defend Stanford's
handling of the controversy, say
ing little can be done in that type
of situation.
Kennedy "handled indirect
costs as well as any president
could have," said Trustee Henry
Muller, managing editor of Time

magazine. "It's too easy in retro
spect to say what could have been
done."
But Bob Beyers, the former
long-time director of the Stanford
News Service, said the University
should have been more open in
dealing with the controversy.
"I cannot imagine a more
unfortunate series of decisions
than those taken after the initial
inquiry of Congressman Dingell
because they saw the inquiry as
something routine," Beyers said.
"The way they handled indirect
costs was the classic way not to
handle irVormation that should
go to the public."
Now, when it is perhaps too
late, the tide has turned in the
media. Where editorials once lam
basted Kennedy for extravagance,
they now praise the nation's uni
versity research system and urge
that the government protect it.
But the changing perspective is
no longer on the front pages, and
the impressions of Stanford's
indirect-cost practices have
already had their effect on both
its reputation and, more perma
nently, that of Kennedy.
As the days of spectacular
headlines wind down and
the controversy enters
its protracted legal stage,
many are now looking back on the
last 18 months and assessing the
damage — both financial and rep
utational.
There is no question that Stan
ford's short-term reputation has
suffered as a result of the endless
negative publicity. Countless sto
ries have already emphasized the
handful of glamorous accounting
mistakes and created an image of
a country club university that

sought to defraud the govern
ment.
"It was a collision of two cul
tures," McManus said. "Within
the University, Kennedy's hon
esty and Stanford's good faith are
taken for granted; if something

has gone wrong, we assume it was
a good faith error.
"Go up to Capital Hill, though,
and there are assumptions about
greed and duplicity," McManus
added.
"In the end, all of higher edu-

cation is being damaged," said for
mer Provost James Rosse, who
resigned in April to head Freedom
Newspapers, Inc. "The fact that
Stanford was prominent during
the process probably affects Stan
ford more than others.
"But I do not detect any partic
ular singling out of Stanford (out
side the University) as much as
one might think," Rosse added.
Dean of Research Byer said the
investigation of Stanford's indi
rect costs was merely one part of a
larger attack on higher education.
"The indirect-cost controversy
was just a symptom of the prob
lem. The government is saving
money by trying to skimp on
expenses and not pay the average
cost of research," Byer said. "This
is part of a discussion on
how this country will choose to
invest in its future.
"In the long run, it will not
hurt Stanford more than others,"
he added.
Two more objective ways to
measure the effects on the Uni
versity's reputation are fund rais
ing and admissions.
Last year was the final one in
Stanford's $1.1 billion Centennial
Campaign, and, despite the fact
that the ultimate total exceeded
expectations, there was still some
effect.
"We'll probably never know to
what extent the indirect-cost con
troversy hurt us," said Elizabeth
Sloan, director of communica
tions for the Office of Develop
ment.
"But most donors know that
that was inflated. We tried to do a
good job communicating our posi
tion on that issue."
The effect on admissions is also
difficult to gauge. The worst of
the coverage came in the first
three months of 1991 — just after
applications were due for the fol
lowing year's class.
While the hearing and the
drastic reduction in the Universi
ty's cost rate came just as
prospective freshmen were mak
ing their final selection, the effect
seemed minimal, as fewer stu

dents were accepted from the wait
list than in previous years.
"My gut feeling is that it had
some small effect, but I couldn't
support that with numbers," said
Jean Fetter, former director of
undergraduate admissions.

Ultimately, most believe that
Stanford is a strong enough insti
tution that such a controversy
will do no permanent damage.
"The mark it leaves on the
University will be quite transient.
People make very different judg
ments about things in the light of
subsequent events," Kennedy
said. "As time goes on and the
scandalous assertions fade and a
more measured view comes to be
part of conventional wisdom, I
think Stanford will be just fine."
But, many people say, the
effects on Kennedy's reputation
are not so easily dismissed.
Whenever Kennedy's
name appears in
print these days, it is
followed by a phrase
like, "who resigned last August
because of allegations of over
billing for research overhead."
He is seemingly inseparable
from the controversy, despite the
fact that as University president
he had little to do with indirect
costs.
In a letter to The New York
Times last November, Kennedy
warned of a "computer virus"
loose at the newspaper that auto
matically included mention of the
indirect-cost controversy with any
story mentioning either Kennedy
or Stanford, including an article
about a polygamous doctor at the
Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal.
"If you think Don Kennedy
knew anything about the intrica
cies of indirect costs at the outset
of the whole mess, you're crazy,"
said Emeritus Psychology Prof.
Albert Hastorf, Kennedy's first
provost. "He should have let oth
ers share responsibility for that
issue."
Cohen, chair of the senate com
mittee on research, agreed that
Kennedy knew little about the
problem, but said as boss he had
to be accountable.
"I don't blame Donald
Kennedy. I blame the administra
tive style," Cohen said. "But it
happened on his watch, and he

had to bear responsibility for it.
"That's why one might not
want to be a university presi
dent," she added.
Although he might not want to
admit it, friends of Kennedy say
he was deeply affected by the
repeated charges directed against
him.
"How much has it hurt him as
a person? It was a deep wound,
but a wound that I think has
healed," Rosse said.
"He has recovered from it, and
I think he is now a stronger per
son. But it was a serious person
al trauma."
Kennedy said he recognizes he
is tied to the controversy and
accepts it, saying that what he
thinks of himself is more impor
tant than what others say.
"There will be some people
who lost interest in this whole
business the day after the yacht
and flowers who may still associ
ate that with me. That is just
something I will have to live with,
and it doesn't bother me," he said.
"I don't have a problem with how
I see myself.
"I know I made some mistakes.
I know that I made some good
decisions. ... I don't have the
feeling about myself that there is
some tarnish there," Kennedy
added.
How people view Kennedy may
very well depend on how closely
they look. The cursory glance at
the most recent headlines will
connect him to the controversy,
but a thorough examination will
likely include indirect costs as
only one event in 12 years of var
ied accomplishments.
The financial legacy, however,
may not be so easy to overlook.
The abrupt reduction in
indirect-cost reimburse
ment has devastated the
University's finances,
costing as much as $30 million per
year.
Stanford is now completing a
painful $43 million budget-cut
ting process, and many academic
programs and administrative
staff support have been slashed.
The budget problems do not
end there.
The system of tuition remis
sion — a method of financing the
tuition of graduate students
involved in sponsored research

through indirect costs — is cur
rently being threatened, and
many believe it will end in the
next two years.
If researchers were forced to
charge graduate student tuition
on their direct research grant, it
is likely that fewer graduate stu-»
dents would be funded and up to
25 percent might be replaced with
cheaper post-doctoral students.
The reduced indirect-cost rate
has also "cost us one new science
building per year in the last two
years," said Byer. Until the Uni
versity and Navy negotiate a n r
rate, the same financial prouxems
will continue.
Of course, two years from now
the University's fiscal situation
could improve if it wins its legal
appeal of last year's abrupt rate
reduction by the Navy.
But Kennedy will not leave
Stanford with all of the indirect
cost issues unresolved.
Things such as a Defense Con
tract Audit Agency study claiming
that Stanford overcharged the gov
ernment by at least $310 million
during the 1980s have been dis
credited, as most observers agree
that the cost agreements signed
during the decade are valid, bind
ing contracts.
In additipn, one of the people
disciplined by the Navy for negoti
ating the allegedly "cozy" cost
accounting agreements with
Stanford has subsequently been
returned to his job.
An expensive overhaul of the
University's internal cost
accounting systems has begun,
and the six-month report card
indicates progress is being made.
Kennedy said he has, in fact,
decided to "leave the runway as
clear as it can possibly be" for
incoming University President
Gerhard Casper.
Perhaps that was the way
Kennedy eventually chose to han
dle this entire controversy.
Some important mistakes were
made early on, and, once the
unstoppable barrage of publicity
began, Kennedy accepted respon
sibility for the institution.
"If you are seen as the person
with oversight when a problem
occurs, it is difficult to set that
aside," said Freelen. "He could
have easily tried to point fingers
at other people, but it was most
honorable to take the blame."

Doyle McManus, a reporter in the Los Ange
les Times Washington bureau and a member
of Stanford's Board of Trustees. U.S. Rep.
John Dingell "promoted stories that Donald

Kennedy was buying sheets and that gets
more circulation," McManus said. "It fits
more easily into the paradigm of journalistic
scandal."
As the harshest criticism focused upon
him, Kennedy took on the role of embattled
defender of the University, eventually
accepting responsibility for what occurred
and submitting his resignation.
For the past 18 months, indirect costs, a

standard but relatively unknown method of
financing research at universities nation
wide, has been transformed into a buzzword
for the accounting errors that permitted
such extravagance.
Through the intense publicity, people
previously unfamiliar with the intricacies of
federally sponsored research have learned a
great deal as they watched the indirect-cost
rate plummet and the University's budget
deficit grow larger and larger.
But while some took the time to under
stand the details — and separate the facts
from the exaggerated half-truths — of what
has become known as the indirect-cost con
troversy, others did not.
For many, the headlines warning that
Stanford had overcharged the government
hundreds of millions of dollars told the story.
As flashy revelations dominated the cover
age, the public image of Stanford suffered.

The
Kennedy
Years
Indirect Costs
Third in a
four-part series

News analysis
Yet, despite the painful financial
legacy, many higher education
experts say the University has come
through the controversy with little
permanent damage to its reputa
tion.
Stanford was merely the first —
and most publicized — target in
what has become a nationwide
campaign to reexamine the system
of indirect costs and the extent to
which the federal government
funds higher education.
But as Kennedy leaves office in
August, the damage to his reputa
tion will not be so easy to repair as
questions remain over how he
handled the controversy.
Although a president cannot be
expected to know of every individ
ual financial transaction, many
within the University say
Kennedy was warned of what was
coming and had ample opportuni
ty to prevent the worst of it.
But at the same time, it is easy
for critics to look back and say
something different should have
been done.
And even if Kennedy or others
had taken a different approach to
the controversy, it might not have
had a real effect on what eventu
ally transpired.
Stanford's indirect-cost rate
began to receive heightened
scrutiny in the fall of 1990
after on-campus Navy regu
lator Paul Biddle began loudly
accusing the Navy and the Uni
versity of having negotiated
"cozy" cost accounting agree
ments.
Indirect costs, as everyone on
campus has grown to learn, are
the expenses associated with
research that cannot be attribut
ed to any particular project, such
as utilities and building mainte
nance.
After the initial reports of
wrongdoing, government auditors
began searching through the
records for inappropriate expens
es to leak, and the University's
rate was knocked down from 74
percent to 70 percent during the
winter of last year as the media
played up every new allegation.
After what was widely thought
to be a disastrous hearing before
the House Subcommitee on Over
sight and Investigations on Stan
ford's indirect-cost practices, the

Navy unilaterally canceled almost
100 cost accounting agreements
and slashed the University's rate
to 55.5 percent in April 1991.
Biddle continued his stream of
accusations through the summer
and following fall, suggesting the
University had overcharged the
government more than $300 mil
lion during the 1980s. He also
filed a qui tarn suit seeking per
sonal reward for the alleged over
billing.
Since then, Biddle has left
Stanford, and the University has
argued that a few isolated mis
takes among three million trans
actions do not indicate a
widespread pattern of abuse.
Subsequent investigations at

other universities have shown
that Stanford was not alone, and
there is also a growing belief that,
at some point, the University's
indirect-cost rate will be increased
back to a level close to the approx
imate actual expenses.
What appear to be the
most obvious mis
takes made in the
controversy were the
first ones. Few expected the con
troversy to snowball into what it
became.
When allegations of indirect
cost overcharges first surfaced in
September 1990, Kennedy was
quick to dismiss them.

He told the Faculty Senate
that the local headlines alleging
Stanford had overcharged the
government $300 million were
"imaginative," laughing that they
were "enough to send trustees off
to their cardiologists."
"I do not expect a discovery of
any wrongdoing on our part,"
Kennedy said at the time.
But, as most people involved in
the controversy generally
acknowledge, these hasty denials
ended up doing little to help Stan
ford's credibility when several of
the more glamorous allegations
were proven true.
"I think that early in the pro
cess we should have withheld all
judgments until we got a really

good external audit of the situa
tion," Kennedy said in a recent
interview. "I think there were
some early statements that in ret
rospect now reflect a little more
confidence than was justified at
the time."
Like a presidential candidate
whose denials of the past lead to
heightened scrutiny, Kennedy's
bold proclamations encouraged
the media — with the help of con
gressional subcommittee leaks —
to seek out the most egregious
past accounting mistakes.
"Once the press got off on a
feeding frenzy, there was no way
to get reason into the discussion,"
said Dean of Research Robert
Byer. "It was not unlike the polit
ical debate now."
The zenith of that frenzy was
probably the "investigative"
report by the ABC news program
"20/20," which focused on the
glamorous revelations and
ignored the long-term research
issues.
Time Senior Editor Paul Witte
man, who worked in the maga
zine's San Francisco bureau until
last year, said Kennedy "probably
misunderstood initially the level
to which the media were interest
ed in the story, but he quickly fig
ured it out."
There is little consensus about
whether the controversy could
have been minimized if Kennedy
had admitted at least a possibility
of wrongdoing at the outset.
"Given the circumstances we
were in — given the rather
unlikely accident of the arrival of
Paul Biddle [as on-campus Navy
regulator], given the rather
unlikely accident that there
would be a story in Science
about the so-called revolt of the
Stanford faculty over indirect
costs, given the interest of the
[House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations] — I
don't think that the result could
have been completely forestalled
or that it could have been made a

lot milder," Kennedy said.
But the controversial and out
spoken Biddle insists he would
not have been so aggressive if
Kennedy's response had been less
"challenging and arrogant."
"Stanford, by the manner in
which it reacted, could have been
like the Harvard Medical School
or MIT and not been so much of a
rallying point," Biddle said.
Yet despite his assertions to
the contrary, Biddle was a media
hound, always willing to offer his
opinion on a new revelation; he
has subsequently become a con
gressional candidate.
In light of these characteris
tics, it is likely that the University
might only have provoked more
attacks from Biddle if it had
admitted that the allegations
were at least partially true.
In the end, it was the presti
gious stature of Stanford that
grabbed the attention.
"If the [congressional] subcom
mittee had chosen to launch an
investigation of Wake Forest, it
wouldn't have made headlines.
But everyone's heard of Stan
ford," said Hoover senior research
fellow Charles Hill.
It was, in effect, an attempt by
Biddle and the congressional sub
commitee to disparage a highly
regarded institution, and Stan
ford took the brunt of the publici
ty-
While Kennedy probably could
not have stopped the controversy
once it began, many point to the
fact that indirect costs was an
issue that should have been
addressed years earlier.
Although indirect costs
did not emerge as a com
mon topic of conversa
tion for most on the
Stanford campus until 18 months
ago, many researchers had been
warning the administration about
the dramatic rise in the Universi
ty's rate for years.
"Faculty Senate people were
saying that the overhead was too
high," said Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy, senate chair in
1981-82. Kennedy should have
"listened more carefully, earlier."
In 1980, Stanford's indirect
cost rate was 58 percent. It rose to
74 percent by 1990, and the Uni
versity requested a rate of 78 per
cent for 1991.
"We were sticking out like a
sore thumb," said Education and
Sociology Prof. Elizabeth Cohen,
chair of this year's senate com
mittee on research. "Our worst
fears were confirmed, and the
administration should have lis
tened to the faculty warnings
about the indirect-cost rate."
Kennedy acknowledges he
should have acted sooner to con
trol the rising rate. "I think I was
not quick enough to recognize the
depth of faculty discontent about
the indirect-cost rate in a timely
fashion and do something more
hard-edged to restrain the rate,"
he said.
But Kennedy also insists that
Stanford was no different than
other universities in aggressively
seeking reimbursement for indi
rect costs.
"For the private research uni
versities that are the most active
players, [the indirect-cost rates]
form a fairly tightly clustered dis
tribution of which Stanford was
near but not quite at the top," he
said. "What I think is fair to say is
that we were in the spectrum of
institutions among the most
active in the pursuit of what we
considered our legitimate inter
ests."
The facts appear to bear
Kennedy out. Harvard Medical
School and MIT also had indirect

cost rates in the range of 70 to 80
percent, and, like Stanford, their
rates subsequently have been hit
hard by the Office of Naval
Research.
In fact, a congressional hearing
held last January found a "sys
temic" problem in the way univer
sities allegedly overbill the gov
ernment for indirect costs.
When looking at the other
prestigious universities investi
gated for indirect-cost over
charges, though, it is quickly
apparent that no other school
faced the same level of heightened
publicity. Perhaps because of its
country club image or simply
because of the presence of Paul
Biddle, Stanford was clearly sin
gled out for special scrutiny, and
Kennedy's reputation, rightly or
wrongly, has suffered for it.
ATfter the early allega
tions of huge over
charges, government
auditors began search
ing for examples of inappropriate
or unallowable costs.
The first revelation came in

December 1990, when govern
ment auditors discovered the Uni
versity had been charging the
depreciation of a yacht to indirect
costs.
The 65-foot yacht Victoria — a
donation that was not even locat
ed on campus — had been inad
vertently included in a cost pool,
and it came to symbolize the sup
posed extravagant abuses of the
University.
As it became clear that Stan
ford was the designated target,
Kennedy became the figure who
was attacked. Records of his offi
cial residence, Hoover House,
were carefully examined, and
costs related to flowers, bedsheets
and a wedding reception received
heavy publicity.
"Part of the Dingell subcom
mittee staff strategy and their
friends in the media was to make
it look as though some of these
expenditures in indirect-cost
pools were expenditures that
somehow sponsored a high
lifestyle on the part of the presi



Damian Martiefka — Daily file
University President Donald Kennedy, in the photo at left, testifies on Stanford's indi
rect-cost practices last March before the powerful Rep. John Dingell, above, and his
House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. "The record today does you
and the University no credit," Dingell told Kennedy at the end of a scathing address
during the hearing.
dent and his wife," Kennedy said.
"There were those unbelievably
tasteless cartoons in the San Jose
Mercury News.
"That is not fun for fairly sen
sitive people with children to look
at. It is also not fair," he added.
Kennedy was the person called
to defend Stanford before the
House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations and the
powerful John Dingell, a Michi
gan Democrat.
The subcommittee is well
known for grabbing headlines
through orchestrated attempts to
embarrass public figures and rev
elations of startling new allega
tions, and the Stanford hearing
succeeded in all respects.
"Don mishandled the Dingell
hearings, but almost anyone
would have," McManus said."The
hearing is designed to spotlight a
chosen villain. Nobody could come
out looking good."
Yet Kennedy says the impres
sion most people get from the
hearing is not from watching the
tape of his testimony but from
reading the press reports. "When
people look at the tape of the
hearing, they come away with a
very different impression," he
said.
Nevertheless, not everyone
watched the hearing. People's
impressions of Kennedy and
Stanford were formed through
the media, and little of the cover
age was designed to make the
University look good.
From the first days of the
controversy, the media
reported what was happen
ing leak by leak — and
almost all of the information was
coming from the government.
Many have suggested that the
problem was one of Stanford's
public relations and its dealings
with the media.
"I think the media learned that
when important institutions are
in trouble, people get interested in
it and it sells newspapers,"
Kennedy said. "And I think we
experienced some piling on."
But Kennedy admitted that "if
there hadn't been a problem,
there wouldn't have been media
attention."
Even if the media was accu
rately reporting what it knew, all
that was being covered was the
government's side of the story
through anonymous sources,
while the University did little to
answer back.
"You don't fight allegations
with counterpublicity," said
Robert Freelen, Stanford's vice
president for public affairs, in a
recent interview. "You fight alle
gations with facts.
"It doesn't serve you well to
make more allegations without
facts to back them up," Freelen
added. "The accuser always has
the advantage in this type of situ
ation."
Others also defend Stanford's
handling of the controversy, say
ing little can be done in that type
of situation.
Kennedy "handled indirect
costs as well as any president
could have," said Trustee Henry
Muller, managing editor of Time

magazine. "It's too easy in retro
spect to say what could have been
done."
But Bob Beyers, the former
long-time director of the Stanford
News Service, said the University
should have been more open in
dealing with the controversy.
"I cannot imagine a more
unfortunate series of decisions
than those taken after the initial
inquiry of Congressman Dingell
because they saw the inquiry as
something routine," Beyers said.
"The way they handled indirect
costs was the classic way not to
handle irVormation that should
go to the public."
Now, when it is perhaps too
late, the tide has turned in the
media. Where editorials once lam
basted Kennedy for extravagance,
they now praise the nation's uni
versity research system and urge
that the government protect it.
But the changing perspective is
no longer on the front pages, and
the impressions of Stanford's
indirect-cost practices have
already had their effect on both
its reputation and, more perma
nently, that of Kennedy.
As the days of spectacular
headlines wind down and
the controversy enters
its protracted legal stage,
many are now looking back on the
last 18 months and assessing the
damage — both financial and rep
utational.
There is no question that Stan
ford's short-term reputation has
suffered as a result of the endless
negative publicity. Countless sto
ries have already emphasized the
handful of glamorous accounting
mistakes and created an image of
a country club university that

sought to defraud the govern
ment.
"It was a collision of two cul
tures," McManus said. "Within
the University, Kennedy's hon
esty and Stanford's good faith are
taken for granted; if something

has gone wrong, we assume it was
a good faith error.
"Go up to Capital Hill, though,
and there are assumptions about
greed and duplicity," McManus
added.
"In the end, all of higher edu-

cation is being damaged," said for
mer Provost James Rosse, who
resigned in April to head Freedom
Newspapers, Inc. "The fact that
Stanford was prominent during
the process probably affects Stan
ford more than others.
"But I do not detect any partic
ular singling out of Stanford (out
side the University) as much as
one might think," Rosse added.
Dean of Research Byer said the
investigation of Stanford's indi
rect costs was merely one part of a
larger attack on higher education.
"The indirect-cost controversy
was just a symptom of the prob
lem. The government is saving
money by trying to skimp on
expenses and not pay the average
cost of research," Byer said. "This
is part of a discussion on
how this country will choose to
invest in its future.
"In the long run, it will not
hurt Stanford more than others,"
he added.
Two more objective ways to
measure the effects on the Uni
versity's reputation are fund rais
ing and admissions.
Last year was the final one in
Stanford's $1.1 billion Centennial
Campaign, and, despite the fact
that the ultimate total exceeded
expectations, there was still some
effect.
"We'll probably never know to
what extent the indirect-cost con
troversy hurt us," said Elizabeth
Sloan, director of communica
tions for the Office of Develop
ment.
"But most donors know that
that was inflated. We tried to do a
good job communicating our posi
tion on that issue."
The effect on admissions is also
difficult to gauge. The worst of
the coverage came in the first
three months of 1991 — just after
applications were due for the fol
lowing year's class.
While the hearing and the
drastic reduction in the Universi
ty's cost rate came just as
prospective freshmen were mak
ing their final selection, the effect
seemed minimal, as fewer stu

dents were accepted from the wait
list than in previous years.
"My gut feeling is that it had
some small effect, but I couldn't
support that with numbers," said
Jean Fetter, former director of
undergraduate admissions.

Ultimately, most believe that
Stanford is a strong enough insti
tution that such a controversy
will do no permanent damage.
"The mark it leaves on the
University will be quite transient.
People make very different judg
ments about things in the light of
subsequent events," Kennedy
said. "As time goes on and the
scandalous assertions fade and a
more measured view comes to be
part of conventional wisdom, I
think Stanford will be just fine."
But, many people say, the
effects on Kennedy's reputation
are not so easily dismissed.
Whenever Kennedy's
name appears in
print these days, it is
followed by a phrase
like, "who resigned last August
because of allegations of over
billing for research overhead."
He is seemingly inseparable
from the controversy, despite the
fact that as University president
he had little to do with indirect
costs.
In a letter to The New York
Times last November, Kennedy
warned of a "computer virus"
loose at the newspaper that auto
matically included mention of the
indirect-cost controversy with any
story mentioning either Kennedy
or Stanford, including an article
about a polygamous doctor at the
Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal.
"If you think Don Kennedy
knew anything about the intrica
cies of indirect costs at the outset
of the whole mess, you're crazy,"
said Emeritus Psychology Prof.
Albert Hastorf, Kennedy's first
provost. "He should have let oth
ers share responsibility for that
issue."
Cohen, chair of the senate com
mittee on research, agreed that
Kennedy knew little about the
problem, but said as boss he had
to be accountable.
"I don't blame Donald
Kennedy. I blame the administra
tive style," Cohen said. "But it
happened on his watch, and he

had to bear responsibility for it.
"That's why one might not
want to be a university presi
dent," she added.
Although he might not want to
admit it, friends of Kennedy say
he was deeply affected by the
repeated charges directed against
him.
"How much has it hurt him as
a person? It was a deep wound,
but a wound that I think has
healed," Rosse said.
"He has recovered from it, and
I think he is now a stronger per
son. But it was a serious person
al trauma."
Kennedy said he recognizes he
is tied to the controversy and
accepts it, saying that what he
thinks of himself is more impor
tant than what others say.
"There will be some people
who lost interest in this whole
business the day after the yacht
and flowers who may still associ
ate that with me. That is just
something I will have to live with,
and it doesn't bother me," he said.
"I don't have a problem with how
I see myself.
"I know I made some mistakes.
I know that I made some good
decisions. ... I don't have the
feeling about myself that there is
some tarnish there," Kennedy
added.
How people view Kennedy may
very well depend on how closely
they look. The cursory glance at
the most recent headlines will
connect him to the controversy,
but a thorough examination will
likely include indirect costs as
only one event in 12 years of var
ied accomplishments.
The financial legacy, however,
may not be so easy to overlook.
The abrupt reduction in
indirect-cost reimburse
ment has devastated the
University's finances,
costing as much as $30 million per
year.
Stanford is now completing a
painful $43 million budget-cut
ting process, and many academic
programs and administrative
staff support have been slashed.
The budget problems do not
end there.
The system of tuition remis
sion — a method of financing the
tuition of graduate students
involved in sponsored research

through indirect costs — is cur
rently being threatened, and
many believe it will end in the
next two years.
If researchers were forced to
charge graduate student tuition
on their direct research grant, it
is likely that fewer graduate stu-»
dents would be funded and up to
25 percent might be replaced with
cheaper post-doctoral students.
The reduced indirect-cost rate
has also "cost us one new science
building per year in the last two
years," said Byer. Until the Uni
versity and Navy negotiate a n r
rate, the same financial prouxems
will continue.
Of course, two years from now
the University's fiscal situation
could improve if it wins its legal
appeal of last year's abrupt rate
reduction by the Navy.
But Kennedy will not leave
Stanford with all of the indirect
cost issues unresolved.
Things such as a Defense Con
tract Audit Agency study claiming
that Stanford overcharged the gov
ernment by at least $310 million
during the 1980s have been dis
credited, as most observers agree
that the cost agreements signed
during the decade are valid, bind
ing contracts.
In additipn, one of the people
disciplined by the Navy for negoti
ating the allegedly "cozy" cost
accounting agreements with
Stanford has subsequently been
returned to his job.
An expensive overhaul of the
University's internal cost
accounting systems has begun,
and the six-month report card
indicates progress is being made.
Kennedy said he has, in fact,
decided to "leave the runway as
clear as it can possibly be" for
incoming University President
Gerhard Casper.
Perhaps that was the way
Kennedy eventually chose to han
dle this entire controversy.
Some important mistakes were
made early on, and, once the
unstoppable barrage of publicity
began, Kennedy accepted respon
sibility for the institution.
"If you are seen as the person
with oversight when a problem
occurs, it is difficult to set that
aside," said Freelen. "He could
have easily tried to point fingers
at other people, but it was most
honorable to take the blame."

To attack an institution, congression
al subcommittees have learned, one
must find an individual to serve as
the target.
Stanford's point man — and the person
who came to be most closely tied to the indi
rect-cost controversy — was University
President Donald Kennedy.
Through the crisis, Kennedy was por
trayed as a president who failed to keep
watch over his accountants, allowing federal
research funds to be spent on furnishings
and flowers for his home and upkeep of a
University yacht.
"It is a natural reflex to personalize
things and simplify complex issues," said
Doyle McManus, a reporter in the Los Ange

Years
Indirect Costs
Third in a
four-part series

News analysis
Yet, despite the painful financial
legacy, many higher education
experts say the University has come
through the controversy with little
permanent damage to its reputa
tion.
Stanford was merely the first —
and most publicized — target in
what has become a nationwide
campaign to reexamine the system
of indirect costs and the extent to
which the federal government
funds higher education.
But as Kennedy leaves office in
August, the damage to his reputa
tion will not be so easy to repair as
questions remain over how he
handled the controversy.
Although a president cannot be
expected to know of every individ
ual financial transaction, many
within the University say
Kennedy was warned of what was
coming and had ample opportuni
ty to prevent the worst of it.
But at the same time, it is easy
for critics to look back and say
something different should have
been done.
And even if Kennedy or others
had taken a different approach to
the controversy, it might not have
had a real effect on what eventu
ally transpired.
Stanford's indirect-cost rate
began to receive heightened
scrutiny in the fall of 1990
after on-campus Navy regu
lator Paul Biddle began loudly
accusing the Navy and the Uni
versity of having negotiated
"cozy" cost accounting agree
ments.
Indirect costs, as everyone on
campus has grown to learn, are
the expenses associated with
research that cannot be attribut
ed to any particular project, such
as utilities and building mainte
nance.
After the initial reports of
wrongdoing, government auditors
began searching through the
records for inappropriate expens
es to leak, and the University's
rate was knocked down from 74
percent to 70 percent during the
winter of last year as the media
played up every new allegation.
After what was widely thought
to be a disastrous hearing before
the House Subcommitee on Over
sight and Investigations on Stan
ford's indirect-cost practices, the

Navy unilaterally canceled almost
100 cost accounting agreements
and slashed the University's rate
to 55.5 percent in April 1991.
Biddle continued his stream of
accusations through the summer
and following fall, suggesting the
University had overcharged the
government more than $300 mil
lion during the 1980s. He also
filed a qui tarn suit seeking per
sonal reward for the alleged over
billing.
Since then, Biddle has left
Stanford, and the University has
argued that a few isolated mis
takes among three million trans
actions do not indicate a
widespread pattern of abuse.
Subsequent investigations at

other universities have shown
that Stanford was not alone, and
there is also a growing belief that,
at some point, the University's
indirect-cost rate will be increased
back to a level close to the approx
imate actual expenses.
What appear to be the
most obvious mis
takes made in the
controversy were the
first ones. Few expected the con
troversy to snowball into what it
became.
When allegations of indirect
cost overcharges first surfaced in
September 1990, Kennedy was
quick to dismiss them.

He told the Faculty Senate
that the local headlines alleging
Stanford had overcharged the
government $300 million were
"imaginative," laughing that they
were "enough to send trustees off
to their cardiologists."
"I do not expect a discovery of
any wrongdoing on our part,"
Kennedy said at the time.
But, as most people involved in
the controversy generally
acknowledge, these hasty denials
ended up doing little to help Stan
ford's credibility when several of
the more glamorous allegations
were proven true.
"I think that early in the pro
cess we should have withheld all
judgments until we got a really

good external audit of the situa
tion," Kennedy said in a recent
interview. "I think there were
some early statements that in ret
rospect now reflect a little more
confidence than was justified at
the time."
Like a presidential candidate
whose denials of the past lead to
heightened scrutiny, Kennedy's
bold proclamations encouraged
the media — with the help of con
gressional subcommittee leaks —
to seek out the most egregious
past accounting mistakes.
"Once the press got off on a
feeding frenzy, there was no way
to get reason into the discussion,"
said Dean of Research Robert
Byer. "It was not unlike the polit
ical debate now."
The zenith of that frenzy was
probably the "investigative"
report by the ABC news program
"20/20," which focused on the
glamorous revelations and
ignored the long-term research
issues.
Time Senior Editor Paul Witte
man, who worked in the maga
zine's San Francisco bureau until
last year, said Kennedy "probably
misunderstood initially the level
to which the media were interest
ed in the story, but he quickly fig
ured it out."
There is little consensus about
whether the controversy could
have been minimized if Kennedy
had admitted at least a possibility
of wrongdoing at the outset.
"Given the circumstances we
were in — given the rather
unlikely accident of the arrival of
Paul Biddle [as on-campus Navy
regulator], given the rather
unlikely accident that there
would be a story in Science
about the so-called revolt of the
Stanford faculty over indirect
costs, given the interest of the
[House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations] — I
don't think that the result could
have been completely forestalled
or that it could have been made a

lot milder," Kennedy said.
But the controversial and out
spoken Biddle insists he would
not have been so aggressive if
Kennedy's response had been less
"challenging and arrogant."
"Stanford, by the manner in
which it reacted, could have been
like the Harvard Medical School
or MIT and not been so much of a
rallying point," Biddle said.
Yet despite his assertions to
the contrary, Biddle was a media
hound, always willing to offer his
opinion on a new revelation; he
has subsequently become a con
gressional candidate.
In light of these characteris
tics, it is likely that the University
might only have provoked more
attacks from Biddle if it had
admitted that the allegations
were at least partially true.
In the end, it was the presti
gious stature of Stanford that
grabbed the attention.
"If the [congressional] subcom
mittee had chosen to launch an
investigation of Wake Forest, it
wouldn't have made headlines.
But everyone's heard of Stan
ford," said Hoover senior research
fellow Charles Hill.
It was, in effect, an attempt by
Biddle and the congressional sub
commitee to disparage a highly
regarded institution, and Stan
ford took the brunt of the publici
ty-
While Kennedy probably could
not have stopped the controversy
once it began, many point to the
fact that indirect costs was an
issue that should have been
addressed years earlier.
Although indirect costs
did not emerge as a com
mon topic of conversa
tion for most on the
Stanford campus until 18 months
ago, many researchers had been
warning the administration about
the dramatic rise in the Universi
ty's rate for years.
"Faculty Senate people were
saying that the overhead was too
high," said Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy, senate chair in
1981-82. Kennedy should have
"listened more carefully, earlier."
In 1980, Stanford's indirect
cost rate was 58 percent. It rose to
74 percent by 1990, and the Uni
versity requested a rate of 78 per
cent for 1991.
"We were sticking out like a
sore thumb," said Education and
Sociology Prof. Elizabeth Cohen,
chair of this year's senate com
mittee on research. "Our worst
fears were confirmed, and the
administration should have lis
tened to the faculty warnings
about the indirect-cost rate."
Kennedy acknowledges he
should have acted sooner to con
trol the rising rate. "I think I was
not quick enough to recognize the
depth of faculty discontent about
the indirect-cost rate in a timely
fashion and do something more
hard-edged to restrain the rate,"
he said.
But Kennedy also insists that
Stanford was no different than
other universities in aggressively
seeking reimbursement for indi
rect costs.
"For the private research uni
versities that are the most active
players, [the indirect-cost rates]
form a fairly tightly clustered dis
tribution of which Stanford was
near but not quite at the top," he
said. "What I think is fair to say is
that we were in the spectrum of
institutions among the most
active in the pursuit of what we
considered our legitimate inter
ests."
The facts appear to bear
Kennedy out. Harvard Medical
School and MIT also had indirect

cost rates in the range of 70 to 80
percent, and, like Stanford, their
rates subsequently have been hit
hard by the Office of Naval
Research.
In fact, a congressional hearing
held last January found a "sys
temic" problem in the way univer
sities allegedly overbill the gov
ernment for indirect costs.
When looking at the other
prestigious universities investi
gated for indirect-cost over
charges, though, it is quickly
apparent that no other school
faced the same level of heightened
publicity. Perhaps because of its
country club image or simply
because of the presence of Paul
Biddle, Stanford was clearly sin
gled out for special scrutiny, and
Kennedy's reputation, rightly or
wrongly, has suffered for it.
ATfter the early allega
tions of huge over
charges, government
auditors began search
ing for examples of inappropriate
or unallowable costs.
The first revelation came in

December 1990, when govern
ment auditors discovered the Uni
versity had been charging the
depreciation of a yacht to indirect
costs.
The 65-foot yacht Victoria — a
donation that was not even locat
ed on campus — had been inad
vertently included in a cost pool,
and it came to symbolize the sup
posed extravagant abuses of the
University.
As it became clear that Stan
ford was the designated target,
Kennedy became the figure who
was attacked. Records of his offi
cial residence, Hoover House,
were carefully examined, and
costs related to flowers, bedsheets
and a wedding reception received
heavy publicity.
"Part of the Dingell subcom
mittee staff strategy and their
friends in the media was to make
it look as though some of these
expenditures in indirect-cost
pools were expenditures that
somehow sponsored a high
lifestyle on the part of the presi

University President Donald Kennedy, in the photo at left, testifies on Stanford's indi
rect-cost practices last March before the powerful Rep. John Dingell, above, and his
House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. "The record today does you
and the University no credit," Dingell told Kennedy at the end of a scathing address
during the hearing.
dent and his wife," Kennedy said.
"There were those unbelievably
tasteless cartoons in the San Jose
Mercury News.
"That is not fun for fairly sen
sitive people with children to look
at. It is also not fair," he added.
Kennedy was the person called
to defend Stanford before the
House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations and the
powerful John Dingell, a Michi
gan Democrat.
The subcommittee is well
known for grabbing headlines
through orchestrated attempts to
embarrass public figures and rev
elations of startling new allega
tions, and the Stanford hearing
succeeded in all respects.
"Don mishandled the Dingell
hearings, but almost anyone
would have," McManus said."The
hearing is designed to spotlight a
chosen villain. Nobody could come
out looking good."
Yet Kennedy says the impres
sion most people get from the
hearing is not from watching the
tape of his testimony but from
reading the press reports. "When
people look at the tape of the
hearing, they come away with a
very different impression," he
said.
Nevertheless, not everyone
watched the hearing. People's
impressions of Kennedy and
Stanford were formed through
the media, and little of the cover
age was designed to make the
University look good.
From the first days of the
controversy, the media
reported what was happen
ing leak by leak — and
almost all of the information was
coming from the government.
Many have suggested that the
problem was one of Stanford's
public relations and its dealings
with the media.
"I think the media learned that
when important institutions are
in trouble, people get interested in
it and it sells newspapers,"
Kennedy said. "And I think we
experienced some piling on."
But Kennedy admitted that "if
there hadn't been a problem,
there wouldn't have been media
attention."
Even if the media was accu
rately reporting what it knew, all
that was being covered was the
government's side of the story
through anonymous sources,
while the University did little to
answer back.
"You don't fight allegations
with counterpublicity," said
Robert Freelen, Stanford's vice
president for public affairs, in a
recent interview. "You fight alle
gations with facts.
"It doesn't serve you well to
make more allegations without
facts to back them up," Freelen
added. "The accuser always has
the advantage in this type of situ
ation."
Others also defend Stanford's
handling of the controversy, say
ing little can be done in that type
of situation.
Kennedy "handled indirect
costs as well as any president
could have," said Trustee Henry
Muller, managing editor of Time

magazine. "It's too easy in retro
spect to say what could have been
done."
But Bob Beyers, the former
long-time director of the Stanford
News Service, said the University
should have been more open in
dealing with the controversy.
"I cannot imagine a more
unfortunate series of decisions
than those taken after the initial
inquiry of Congressman Dingell
because they saw the inquiry as
something routine," Beyers said.
"The way they handled indirect
costs was the classic way not to
handle irVormation that should
go to the public."
Now, when it is perhaps too
late, the tide has turned in the
media. Where editorials once lam
basted Kennedy for extravagance,
they now praise the nation's uni
versity research system and urge
that the government protect it.
But the changing perspective is
no longer on the front pages, and
the impressions of Stanford's
indirect-cost practices have
already had their effect on both
its reputation and, more perma
nently, that of Kennedy.
As the days of spectacular
headlines wind down and
the controversy enters
its protracted legal stage,
many are now looking back on the
last 18 months and assessing the
damage — both financial and rep
utational.
There is no question that Stan
ford's short-term reputation has
suffered as a result of the endless
negative publicity. Countless sto
ries have already emphasized the
handful of glamorous accounting
mistakes and created an image of
a country club university that

sought to defraud the govern
ment.
"It was a collision of two cul
tures," McManus said. "Within
the University, Kennedy's hon
esty and Stanford's good faith are
taken for granted; if something

has gone wrong, we assume it was
a good faith error.
"Go up to Capital Hill, though,
and there are assumptions about
greed and duplicity," McManus
added.
"In the end, all of higher edu-

cation is being damaged," said for
mer Provost James Rosse, who
resigned in April to head Freedom
Newspapers, Inc. "The fact that
Stanford was prominent during
the process probably affects Stan
ford more than others.
"But I do not detect any partic
ular singling out of Stanford (out
side the University) as much as
one might think," Rosse added.
Dean of Research Byer said the
investigation of Stanford's indi
rect costs was merely one part of a
larger attack on higher education.
"The indirect-cost controversy
was just a symptom of the prob
lem. The government is saving
money by trying to skimp on
expenses and not pay the average
cost of research," Byer said. "This
is part of a discussion on
how this country will choose to
invest in its future.
"In the long run, it will not
hurt Stanford more than others,"
he added.
Two more objective ways to
measure the effects on the Uni
versity's reputation are fund rais
ing and admissions.
Last year was the final one in
Stanford's $1.1 billion Centennial
Campaign, and, despite the fact
that the ultimate total exceeded
expectations, there was still some
effect.
"We'll probably never know to
what extent the indirect-cost con
troversy hurt us," said Elizabeth
Sloan, director of communica
tions for the Office of Develop
ment.
"But most donors know that
that was inflated. We tried to do a
good job communicating our posi
tion on that issue."
The effect on admissions is also
difficult to gauge. The worst of
the coverage came in the first
three months of 1991 — just after
applications were due for the fol
lowing year's class.
While the hearing and the
drastic reduction in the Universi
ty's cost rate came just as
prospective freshmen were mak
ing their final selection, the effect
seemed minimal, as fewer stu

dents were accepted from the wait
list than in previous years.
"My gut feeling is that it had
some small effect, but I couldn't
support that with numbers," said
Jean Fetter, former director of
undergraduate admissions.

Ultimately, most believe that
Stanford is a strong enough insti
tution that such a controversy
will do no permanent damage.
"The mark it leaves on the
University will be quite transient.
People make very different judg
ments about things in the light of
subsequent events," Kennedy
said. "As time goes on and the
scandalous assertions fade and a
more measured view comes to be
part of conventional wisdom, I
think Stanford will be just fine."
But, many people say, the
effects on Kennedy's reputation
are not so easily dismissed.
Whenever Kennedy's
name appears in
print these days, it is
followed by a phrase
like, "who resigned last August
because of allegations of over
billing for research overhead."
He is seemingly inseparable
from the controversy, despite the
fact that as University president
he had little to do with indirect
costs.
In a letter to The New York
Times last November, Kennedy
warned of a "computer virus"
loose at the newspaper that auto
matically included mention of the
indirect-cost controversy with any
story mentioning either Kennedy
or Stanford, including an article
about a polygamous doctor at the
Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal.
"If you think Don Kennedy
knew anything about the intrica
cies of indirect costs at the outset
of the whole mess, you're crazy,"
said Emeritus Psychology Prof.
Albert Hastorf, Kennedy's first
provost. "He should have let oth
ers share responsibility for that
issue."
Cohen, chair of the senate com
mittee on research, agreed that
Kennedy knew little about the
problem, but said as boss he had
to be accountable.
"I don't blame Donald
Kennedy. I blame the administra
tive style," Cohen said. "But it
happened on his watch, and he

had to bear responsibility for it.
"That's why one might not
want to be a university presi
dent," she added.
Although he might not want to
admit it, friends of Kennedy say
he was deeply affected by the
repeated charges directed against
him.
"How much has it hurt him as
a person? It was a deep wound,
but a wound that I think has
healed," Rosse said.
"He has recovered from it, and
I think he is now a stronger per
son. But it was a serious person
al trauma."
Kennedy said he recognizes he
is tied to the controversy and
accepts it, saying that what he
thinks of himself is more impor
tant than what others say.
"There will be some people
who lost interest in this whole
business the day after the yacht
and flowers who may still associ
ate that with me. That is just
something I will have to live with,
and it doesn't bother me," he said.
"I don't have a problem with how
I see myself.
"I know I made some mistakes.
I know that I made some good
decisions. ... I don't have the
feeling about myself that there is
some tarnish there," Kennedy
added.
How people view Kennedy may
very well depend on how closely
they look. The cursory glance at
the most recent headlines will
connect him to the controversy,
but a thorough examination will
likely include indirect costs as
only one event in 12 years of var
ied accomplishments.
The financial legacy, however,
may not be so easy to overlook.
The abrupt reduction in
indirect-cost reimburse
ment has devastated the
University's finances,
costing as much as $30 million per
year.
Stanford is now completing a
painful $43 million budget-cut
ting process, and many academic
programs and administrative
staff support have been slashed.
The budget problems do not
end there.
The system of tuition remis
sion — a method of financing the
tuition of graduate students
involved in sponsored research

through indirect costs — is cur
rently being threatened, and
many believe it will end in the
next two years.
If researchers were forced to
charge graduate student tuition
on their direct research grant, it
is likely that fewer graduate stu-»
dents would be funded and up to
25 percent might be replaced with
cheaper post-doctoral students.
The reduced indirect-cost rate
has also "cost us one new science
building per year in the last two
years," said Byer. Until the Uni
versity and Navy negotiate a n r
rate, the same financial prouxems
will continue.
Of course, two years from now
the University's fiscal situation
could improve if it wins its legal
appeal of last year's abrupt rate
reduction by the Navy.
But Kennedy will not leave
Stanford with all of the indirect
cost issues unresolved.
Things such as a Defense Con
tract Audit Agency study claiming
that Stanford overcharged the gov
ernment by at least $310 million
during the 1980s have been dis
credited, as most observers agree
that the cost agreements signed
during the decade are valid, bind
ing contracts.
In additipn, one of the people
disciplined by the Navy for negoti
ating the allegedly "cozy" cost
accounting agreements with
Stanford has subsequently been
returned to his job.
An expensive overhaul of the
University's internal cost
accounting systems has begun,
and the six-month report card
indicates progress is being made.
Kennedy said he has, in fact,
decided to "leave the runway as
clear as it can possibly be" for
incoming University President
Gerhard Casper.
Perhaps that was the way
Kennedy eventually chose to han
dle this entire controversy.
Some important mistakes were
made early on, and, once the
unstoppable barrage of publicity
began, Kennedy accepted respon
sibility for the institution.
"If you are seen as the person
with oversight when a problem
occurs, it is difficult to set that
aside," said Freelen. "He could
have easily tried to point fingers
at other people, but it was most
honorable to take the blame."
