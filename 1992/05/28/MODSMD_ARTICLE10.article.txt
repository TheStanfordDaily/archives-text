Sikh violence kills 15 in India
AMRITSAR, India (AP) — At least 15 people were killed
Wednesday in shootings blamed on Sikh separatists, who also
claimed responsibility for beheading a radio executive who was
kidnapped last week.
Most of the shooting victims were Hindu, police said.
At least 1,000 people have been killed this year in secession
related violence in northern Punjab state, where Sikhs are fight
ing to break from the Hindu-dominated federal government.
The headless body of Mohan Lai Manchanda, a senior official
of state-run All India Radio, was found in Mehmoodpur, about 30
miles of the Punjab capital, police said. The head was found about
six miles away.
Sikh rebels had threatened to kill him unless All India Radio
substituted the Punjabi language for Hindi in its local broadcasts.
In northwest Punjab, militants shot dead five Hindu business
men riding in two cars, said Sanjeev Gupta, a senior police official.
LA riots change American image in Korea
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Lee Soo-yul, 35, was to have been
married on Sunday, but the bride's family canceled the wedding.
They said they didn't want their only daughter moving to California.
According to Lee, the bride's parents said the Los Angeles riots
last month had soured their image of America as a land of oppor
tunity. Their daughter would be safer staying in Korea, they said.
The riots and pictures of Koreans with rifles on store roofs
exposed a dark side to Korean emigration that disturbed Koreans
at home. It has made them increasingly critical of those who went
to the United States.
The U.S. Embassy said visa applications to the United States
dipped this month for the first time since 1988.
"The perception of America has changed," said Helen Choi, a
teacher with relatives in Los Angeles. "We used to believe it was
a land of opportunity, of milk and honey.
