Inheritance trial postponed
A trial to decide if Stanford will receive an
inheritance of up to $97 million was postponed for
three months at a Los Angeles hearing yesterday.
Senior University Counsels Carol Swenson and
Michael Vartain represented Stanford in the
hearing, which Swenson described as a "very
short appearance."
The judge granted Stanford and the Los Ange
les County Museum a continuance until August
31 to gather information, Swenson said.
Stanford and the museum are potential benefi
ciaries of Christian Scientist Bliss Napp's wife and
sister. Napp wrote a biography of Mary Baker
Eddy, the founder of the Christian Science Church.
The will stipulates that unless the church pub
lishes the book by 1993, Stanford and the muse
um will receive the inheritance.
The church published the book last year, but
the University and the museum claim it did not
fulfill the conditions of the will because the book
is not available at all the church's libraries.
An initial hearing took place in February to

decide whether the Church had complied with the
will's conditions. At the time, an extension was
granted to the University and the museum.
