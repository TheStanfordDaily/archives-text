## Economic diversity 
### 
In spite of appearances,
class differences impact
student lives concretely

IN ITS FERVOR to examine
issues of inequality, Stanford
has taken pride in its efforts to
increase awareness of racism, sex
ism and homophobia.
However, in the University's
microcosmic world, socioeconomic
class differences are often over
looked.
Stanford students interact on an
apparently equal surface of eco
nomic equality. The quality of stu
dents' housing reflects their luck of
the Draw, not their income bracket.
Financial aid is rarely discussed.
Money simply isn't an issue the
way it is in the "real world."
While this lack of attention to
class issues creates a refreshingly
level playing field in which stu
dents do not have to be judged or
labeled by their economic situa
tion, class differences are manifest
in less visible forms.
In the shiny, happy world of
Stanfordland, people tend to ignore
the fact that a substantial number
of students stop out, transfer or
drop out because their families can
no longer afford the cost of a pri
vate school education.
The Financial Aids Office fur
ther masks this reality by giving
students the false impression that
the office will ensure that they can
stay for four years.
Many of the students who can
not continue at Stanford do get
financial aid — but it is often not
enough. Some are from middle
class families that have "too much"
money to get substantial aid but
too little to pay for the expenses.
But at an even more latent level
than financial aid problems: Class
differences often place social con
straints on lower-income students.
These students know all too well
the discomfort of not being able to
afford to go out to an expensive

restaurant with friends. In a
wealthy community like Palo Alto
— a veritable haven of high-priced
restaurants and stores — this
problem is intensified.
Because Stanford does have a
higher proportion of upper middle
class students, being rich becomes
the expected norm from both with
in and outside the University.
Since class differences don't
seem to exist at Stanford, people
do not realize that some students'
participation in the life of the insti
tution is crippled due to the struc
tural limitations that the lack of
finance imposes.
Joining the Greek system, for
instance, requires a swollen bank
account. Even unhoused fraternities
and sororities charge substantial
amounts for their membership dues.
Although these groups offer
scholarships for those who cannot
afford the fees, many not feel com
fortable asking for financial help
and risk being stigmatized because
of their economic situation.
Furthermore, full participation
in a Greek organization entails the
substantial extra costs of formals,
road trips and other activities not
covered by the membership fee.
The question of how to
approach class differences at Stan
ford is a tricky issue.
Those with privilege need to be
aware of the fact that many stu
dents deal with the effects of
financial constraints every day,
and that not everyone at Stanford
is rich.
Yet making an issue out of class
differences will bring uncomfort
able attention to students from
lower-income families who like the
fact that, at Stanford, they can
establish and identity beyond their
socioeconomic situation.
While these conflicting approach
es to the class question offer no con
crete solutions, a certain level of
awareness and sensitivity on the
part of the members of the Stanford
community to often-ignored eco
nomic differences could bring the
University closer to achieving its
multicultural goals.
