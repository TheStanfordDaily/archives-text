## Reflection on a flying circus 
### 
AT ONE POINT in my life I wanted to
be President. You know, I spoke well,
cared about the big issues, got along
with people and wanted to save the world.
Well, my fifteen minutes and fourteen
columns are up, and I know there's one
job I'm not gonna get after graaviation.
I guess I still aspire to greatness, but
under very different terms. Once I imag
ined I could be the great off-white (Tan?
Brown? Ecru?) hope of America. But in
these last few years I've been to ally
turned off by po! itic* l .
More importantly, it has become
increasingly clear tc me that I can't regu
late my behavior now for fear of reper
cussions later. I've got to be true to
myself and hope that the rest of the world
can deal when the time comes.
Of course, that's easier said than done.
But part of the appeal of writing such
damning columns is that I can't back
down in 30 years and lie that something
didn't happen.
At the same time, I know that expos
ing myself in such personal ways is ulti
mately a reflection of an enormous
amount of privilege. It's always been a
joke in my family that the only way I
could rebel would be to join the Young
Republicans and come home with a brief
case at my side. Even in a situation as ter
rifying as that, my friends and family
would probably still love me.
Also, my secrets are really not that

dramatic or traumatic. I've led a fairly
cushy life and though I may have spoken
a few unspeakables, most people carry
around much deeper, darker secrets than
any of the things I've chosen to share.
I do wish I had written a few funny
pieces, though. I can't begin to imagine
what people who have never met me
think of me. I must seem like the most
angry and serious fellow on the planet —
which I am of course, but still. It's one
thing to be the most hated man on cam
pus, but the most serious .. . ouch!
Also, for all of my indignation at get
ting crank calls, there was a sick delight I
took in receiving them. Knowing that I
had struck a nerve, even a hateful one,
was deeply satisfying on some level.
I guess part of the satisfaction in writ
ing a column is the feedback one gets.
Each week people glared at me in Tresid
der was a week I knew I was making my
voice heard.
Some feedback was downright
strange, though. One person complained
to me that I was using my column as a
soapbox to preach my opinions. This left
me wondering what the hell else a col
umn was meant to be.
Other interesting comments included
the range of interpretations people got
out of what I've said. It's become very
clear to me that the reader is as impor
tant in creating the meaning of a text as
the writer. People have repeatedly dis

agreed with things in my columns that
I'm convinced I hadn't even hinted at.
One fellow recently took issue with some
of my "anti-Israel" comments, which is
funny 'cause I've never said a word about
Israel.
Still, I'm actually surprised at how few
people do heap scorn or praise. So I really
am thankful to all the folk who have writ
ten or approached me to gripe or agree.
Finally, though each of these columns
bears my name, I owe an incredible debt
to my main squeeze, Danzy Senna. More
than anyone else, she helped me create,
think through, edit and finalize these
columns. I wrote these words each
Thursday, but the line between my ideas
and hers is never clear.
Final shout outs go to my editor
Anand, whatever remains of the tribe
and all the bros of B-wing along with my
family in Uj, Seattle, the Bay Area, L.A.,
Madison and Nueva York, without whom
I'd be nada.

In the immortal words of Monty Python:
If you've had half as much fun reading
these columns as I've had writing them,
then I've had twice as much fun as you.
Peace.

Also, for all of my indignation at get
ting crank calls, there was a sick delight I
took in receiving them. Knowing that I
had struck a nerve, even a hateful one,
was deeply satisfying on some level.
I guess part of the satisfaction in writ
ing a column is the feedback one gets.
Each week people glared at me in Tresid
der was a week I knew I was making my
voice heard.
Some feedback was downright
strange, though. One person complained
to me that I was using my column as a
soapbox to preach my opinions. This left
me wondering what the hell else a col
umn was meant to be.
Other interesting comments included
the range of interpretations people got
out of what I've said. It's become very
clear to me that the reader is as impor
tant in creating the meaning of a text as
the writer. People have repeatedly dis

agreed with things in my columns that
I'm convinced I hadn't even hinted at.
One fellow recently took issue with some
of my "anti-Israel" comments, which is
funny 'cause I've never said a word about
Israel.
Still, I'm actually surprised at how few
people do heap scorn or praise. So I really
am thankful to all the folk who have writ
ten or approached me to gripe or agree.
Finally, though each of these columns
bears my name, I owe an incredible debt
to my main squeeze, Danzy Senna. More
than anyone else, she helped me create,
think through, edit and finalize these
columns. I wrote these words each
Thursday, but the line between my ideas
and hers is never clear.
Final shout outs go to my editor
Anand, whatever remains of the tribe
and all the bros of B-wing along with my
family in Uj, Seattle, the Bay Area, L.A.,
Madison and Nueva York, without whom
I'd be nada.

In the immortal words of Monty Python:
If you've had half as much fun reading
these columns as I've had writing them,
then I've had twice as much fun as you.
Peace.
